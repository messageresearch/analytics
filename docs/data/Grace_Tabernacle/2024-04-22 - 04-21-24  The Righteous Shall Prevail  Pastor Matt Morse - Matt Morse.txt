long to be home and be with your family and friends and you know our church is our family and it's just we had a real wonderful time sure appreciate the the prayers and and everybody looking out after things and we heard so many compliments on the on the church and you know brother Joe said something about the way the service has gone he said you know that's a real sign of a good church is when the pastor's gone they still have church you know it's um it's just a sign that things are done right and so we just appreciate the Lord and that's that's what we really want is just to be pleasing unto the Lord and sure enjoyed being able to take some time with with my wife that was the first time that we went on a trip by our in six years and so we were really enjoyed it and had to block my kids number numbers on my phone so they stop trying to call I got a report on my phone y'all get those little reports it said your phone time was down 187% last week I said well Glory I might just screenshot that and save it it just just a reminder your phone time was down but but man we just sure glad to be home and we had you know plenty of time to sit and just to just to you know just to read and spend time the Lord Lord even and you know sometimes it's good just to get away and find a quiet place and that may be dangerous for me you leave me too too long by myself with the Bible and and I won't I won't I won't hold youall long this morning but you just you just get a lot of good stuff you know and you really just find the leading of the Lord but I really appreciate our brothers and brother Joe and brother Andrew speaking on the services and and uh just every every person I heard from it was just tremendous so God bless you and appreciate them ministering and all of you the work that you do and you love the Lord this morning amen we just just so thankful we have a prayer request says remember Brother David Gates has been down for four days asking for prayer and also for Emanuel and Leah the sick this morning and then for my nephew and and niece Seth and Anna they're having their baby today and so we just pray for Hannah that the Lord would be with her supp may may be here by now may here in a few hours so they just ask for prayers so we just want to remember them this morning if you have a need on your heart just lift your hand to the Lord and let's make it known to him and let's just pray together gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord Lord we're so thankful of all that you done for us Lord how Mighty that you are and Lord a never failing God and Lord how little that we feel Lord as we look across this great world that you created Lord a place for our dwelling and Lord a place that we could have fellowship and Dominion Lord we're so thankful for all that you've done for us Lord what a privileged people that we are in this hour Lord to be able to have a relationship with you and Lord I pray Lord that you would meet each one this morning Lord I pray you would anoint this word God I pray Lord that you would be merciful unto us Lord forgive us of our shortcomings Lord the mistakes that we make in our flesh but Lord may you come in a mighty way this morning God let your spirit be made known amongst your children and Lord I pray You' meet each need those that are sick you touch their bodies lift them up Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we just want to invite you to the scripture and we're going to read out of the book of Psalms in the 37th chapter and I just couldn't get away from this and I had actually quoted something out of it in a few uh weeks ago and and and over the past few weeks in study I just keep uh into this scripture and and and David paints quite a picture here of showing a righteous man a good man and a and and an evil man so uh but I just want to read out of 37th chapter and the first verse and we'll just read on on down that Bas is really uh Bassy up here I don't know if there's a you can fix that but uh we're going to read psalms 371 Bible says fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed how many say Amen to that Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord and trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noon day rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass but cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yay Thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be in other words a little while you won't even be able to find the wicked he said but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace but us ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word and now we could read that scripture and say we had church this morning didn't isn't that good he said in a little while you'll look for the wicked and you'll not even find them but the meek they'll inherit the earth now you know you Bible readers that's the very scripture that Jesus quoted in Matthew the 5th chapter he said blessed are the meek when he preached The Sermon on the Mount blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth and I want to speak this morning on the righteous shall Prevail the righteous shall Prevail I had spent uh uh time and just in thought and prayer and you know I I think of the feelings and things that we get in this in this flesh and uh brother Mark it just seems like sometimes it's an overwhelming feeling and I don't know about y'all but if you ever looked at everybody else and thought everybody was doing good but you it just seemed like everybody it just seems like everything's going good for them but it ain't going good for you or everything works out for them but it don't work out for you and everything they everything they touch it just it just does right but it don't work out for you and you know sometimes it just seems like we get overwhelmed and in in our in in our in our life and jobs maybe get overwhelming and families overwhelming and church overwhelming and just seems like it's just constant on every hand and and and you know you don't have to look very far to find wickedness this is this is something that uh you can look across the street and you see wickedness you go down the town it's wickedness it just everywhere you seem uh everywhere you go it just seems like it's wickedness on every hand and and often times it looks like that wickedness is what is rewarded it looks as though uh you know the wicked they they they they're they they get the riches and the wickedness and they and they they live these great lives and prosperous lives and it looks like why would why would God reward all the wicked and then those that are struggling and those that are trying to do right and trying to serve the Lord and and and then they're not rewarded but the Wicked Man is the one rewarded and so this is a way that it looks like often through our through our own uh eyes but let me prophesy something to you this morning and I believe I have a right to because it's a scripture but the prosperity of the wicked shall cease and the glory of the righteous shall Prevail somebody say Amen that it won't be long and the prosperity of the wicked it'll not it'll no longer be but but the but the glory of the righteous it'll Prevail over it and I thought isn't it something that this word Prevail brother Wesley to Prevail means to prove more powerful than an than an opposing force or to become Victorious so in order to Prevail over something there has to be an opposing force in order to be able to say I'm going to Prevail there has to be opposition in order to Prevail there has to be something something there had to be something to Prevail over there would have to be a trial or there'd have to be a test or or there' had to be a battle or there had to be a struggle there had to be something that you would go through in order to Prevail you can put your own you can put your own problem in that in that in that saying that what is it that I had to Prevail over we all have things that we had to Prevail over we all have trials we all have have test and we all have pressures and we all have we all have seasons in our life that we go through great things but but friends when you come to a season of great trial know this this morning that when you're in a season of great trial that that's the very season of overcoming see in order to be a prevailer in order to be an overcomer in order to have over in order to overcome something in order to Prevail over something then you had to be in a season of trial in order to have a season of overcoming you have to have a season of pressure a season of test in order to have a season of prevailing or a season overcoming so instead of looking at it like there's too much pressure or there's too many problems or or or people get mad or there's too many fusses I I know it's easy to look around the church and it's easy to look around one another and find all the problems and all the negatives and all what this one said about this one or what this person did to you and I thought what it's such a weakness of the Flesh of of of Christianity I it's so sad to look and see men that are supposed to be men of God and I'm going get in trouble but but women that are supposed to be women of God and it don't take just a little thing and they'll they'll go from being a great leader to being a little bit of nobody and they'll go trashing and and mouthing and get so upset at one another and why because it's just the it's the weakness of the human flesh it's the weakness of their walk with God it's the missing things in their life with God and they allow the pressures and the things of this life to so pressure them down that they're not living the life of an overcomer but it it's just a life of pressure and it's a life of beat down it's a life of beat up and they lash out at one another and and you try to do something good for the Lord and then Satan comes and and he's trying to do something against you to stop and and if we ain't careful it allows us to get so worked up in our spirit but what we ought to do is listen what the prophet said he said don't worry about all those S these pressures and he says but see he said just when you start to do something good he said then you're going to see trouble coming he said so then that's just the devil trying to upset the program of God we find it in our individual life we find it in our church world we find it in our natural Affairs you find it everywhere he said so then we can know that when we're getting ready to do right wrong is always present somebody say Amen you want to do something for the Lord you lo and behold somebody's going to do something to upset you or somebody's going to say something or or Satan's going to bring some Spirit right in the middle of what you're trying to do for God to try to upset you or try to knock you off your direction or or try to take you out of the program of God that you would back up and say well it ain't worth it anyhow and why well there a was no reward that came from it anyhow why it was more worth it was more trouble than it was worth what it's the devil trying to upset the program of God something that God has called you to do and put on your heart to do but he's doing all that he can to upset the program of God he said but the way to overcome that how many wants to know it he said the way to overcome that is to think in your heart which way God would have you to go and which is the best way and then stay with that way the way to overcome it is to find the way that God would have you to go the best way and stay with God's way so what did God lead you to do what did God put on your heart to do what is God dealing with you to do find God's way and stay with God's way don't let the pressures and the problem I can't help but I'm here this morning but you can't let all the things that are built up take you out of the path that God has started you down now this came from a message that brother Ram was speaking he was speaking on Israel when they were caught on the mountain how many members of the story Jehoshaphat brother Joe had preached on it a few weeks ago and how that they were caught up on a mountain and the enemy was around them and they had no way and they had no way out they had no way to food or water here they were trapped up in this way and but's preaching on them being in this situation he said but in that great hour of frustration the Lord spoke and he spoke to a little Prophet that was standing nearby and he said stand still and see the salvation of God you'll not have to fight this battle he said and as long as they were together in praying it was God's battle he said and I think that applies the same thing tonight in this great hour where the great church people and the great churches are stewing and fussing with each other denominational barriers breaking us apart and we battle from this side and that side it's time to stand still for it's God's battle it's not ours to begin with God wants us to stand still and when God gets ready to do anything he usually commands his people to stand still isn't that opposite of the way we think we get in the middle of something we get anxious and try to figure out a way to fix it we get in a little bit of a trial or something that's going on you tell you what I'll go get a hold of them I I I'll whoop them into shape I I'll I'll correct that I'll work on that let me just take matters into my own hands but that ain't the way God instructs us to do it he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord when there's a great battle on when there's a great trial on He commands his people brother said God commands his people to stand still it ain't a request of God it's a command of God stand still and let God be God if you want to overcome you think about it we're living in this age of prevailing an age of overcoming you know what the Bible says there will be Overcomers in this age that's why I believe there'll be Overcomers you know what that means by tomorrow you may as well just say there's going to be great tests in this age there's going to be great trials in this age there's going to be great pressures in this age because there will be Overcomers but if you're going to overcome see you must have something to overcome if you're going to be a Victor you must have an opposition if you're going to have achievement then you must have a challenge there's got to be things that we overcome you say well what's the great challenge of today how many knows that what we're living in today brother would say it like this he said we're living in a great hour of drought it's a great this is the age that we live in he said we all know we're very aware that there is a great spiritual drought in the land today spiritually speaking and you know it was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of Christ would be so when you look in this world brother Mark and you see this great spiritual drought that is going on in the land in the middle of a spiritual drought the Bride of Jesus Christ is rejoicing you say well why is she rejoicing because the spiritual drought is a sign of the coming of the Lord so instead of getting discouraged because there's a lack of of spiritual food instead of getting discouraged because people are going their own way and they and they they have all their own directions and things instead of getting discouraged for living in this age we ought to be encouraged that the prophet of God said but in a spiritual drought he said it's it will only come before the second coming of Christ would be so it makes me feel good to know this morning that when you see this drought it's a sign of the coming of the Lord when you see this drought it's a sign that just around the corner that the wicked will be no more and the and the bride of Christ shall Prevail and the righteous shall be lifted again this is the age that we live in the Bible said there will come a famine in the land and it won't be a famine for bread alone but it'll be a famine for the hearing of the word of God and brother brandham said and that day is now it ain't something that we're waiting on but we're living in the day where there's a famine for the hearing of the word of God it was it's not a natural drought but it's a spiritual drought that's what Jesus said he said man shall not live by bread alone but man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God but right in the middle of a famine where people are starving for the word of God in the middle of a famine there's a famine in the land how many believe that say Amen when people are starving for truth they're starving for the word they're starving for leadership they're starving for Direction they're starving for guidance they're starving for an they ain't got nowhere to turn and in the middle of a famine here David is showing us something about the seed of almighty God as he shows this contrast of a of a wicked man and a good man and it begins to speak of these two men he said but the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall last forever and they shall not be ashamed in the evil time but in the days of famine they shall be satisfied that makes me want to shout over this building here David said there's a wicked man and there's a good man and the wicked are going to do wicked things and the good men are going to do good things and it look it's going to look like that the wicked are the one that's prospering but don't you worry about it because there's coming a time that the wicked will be no more and then the just man he'll Prevail over all things and you don't have to worry about it for God is going to send a famine upon the land but in the days of famine the good man shall be sh satisfied the good man shall be fed the good man he'll survive the famine the wicked David said he in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked Shall Perish the famine wasn't sent for you glory to God the famine was sent for the wicked he said the good men will be satisfied but the Wicked Will perish The Good Men God but the wicked they're going to fall he said the Wicked Man he'll borrow and pay not again but the righteous man shows mercy and he gives for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off for the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and He delighted in his way the good man you say well what a you know I brother Matt I I went through some rough times lately I don't know that I'm a good man all at all but you realize here that David when he talks about this good man he says even that good man sometimes he'll fall I love this I love this Psalm he said sometimes the good man he'll even fall short he said but when though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down here he's talking about the Wicked Man being cut off he'll be cut off from the earth he'll starve in the middle of the famine but the good man he may fall you may look at the good man and say he ain't no different than the wicked man but he's a good man but he fell he said but he shall not utterly be cast down that word utterly cast down means to be hurled away or throwed away so it's here that's an action that you would use your hand to do he would not be hurled away he will not be thrown away he will not be cast down the good man though he fall he will not be thrown in the trash he he won't be thrown away he said but what God will do is the Lord will uphold him with his hand I thought isn't it something the same hand that would throw away and the same hand that would cut off the wicked David said but the Lord will uphold him with his hand he upholds him he'll lift him back to his place he'll raise him up he'll give him a place of rest a place to lean on oh my can you imagine friends that the hand of God is what's upholding you in the time whenever you were fallen in the time whenever the pressures of Life had you took you down to such a state that you didn't know how you were going to go through tomorrow but here the very hands of the Creator became your place of rest the hands of the Creator God came the place that you were leaning on when you didn't feel like you could go another day but it was in the hand of the creator that established you and set you upright he said he'll uphold you should not be cast down but he'll uphold you David goes on to say he said I've been young he said but now I'm old you think about the life of David here a man that that lived 70 something maybe or a little over 70 years but Mark in his in his time of his life he saw many things he saw nations rise and Nations fall he saw kingdoms rise and and kingdoms fall he saw great Kings become nothing he saw little boys become great Kings he seen great battles he's seen great victories he seen great defeats he seen the richest of the rich he seen the poorest of the poor he lived in tents he slept with sheep he lived in the greatest Palace of all of Israel David seen many things he said I was young and now I'm old but there's one thing that I've never seen he said I have never seen the righteous forsaken and I've never seen God's seed begging bread there's a lot I've seen but never seen God's children ever forsake Him and his seed they've never beged bread don't you realize friends that in the middle of a famine David said this bread is freely given by the righteous man it's freely given by God unto you and it ain't something that you have to beg for all you had to do is receive it it ain't something you had to go beg God for but God saw that a famine was coming before you ever walked on this Earth he said and in the time in famine I'll provide bread that my seed will be satisfied his seed they don't beg for bread God saw it before it ever took place he saw the needs of the people you know today it seems like my goodness I feel like preaching in here today it seems like all the work and the effort is for Natural Things it seems like all the work is for natural food but do you realize this morning that your spiritual food is just matter of fact it's it's more important but but at least it's just as important to feed the spiritual man as the natural man it's important to feed the spiritual food is for the spiritual man natural food is for the natural man and so here David says we had to be fed and here he but God he the righteous man he'll never make you beg bread you say where is this bread that we could feed on and be satisfied you remember when Jesus was coming out from capernium that day and these men that had followed him he had just fed 5,000 over on the bank a river bank and they had saw this great miracle and they came seeking after him and Jesus when he saw him he said you don't seek me because of the Miracles he said you seek me because you ate bread and you were filled see they were after the natural thing you're only following me because I gave you food you only follow me because I fed your bellies you you only follow me because I because I gave you a little bit that so he said but but but but you it's because you ate the Loaves and were're filled and you're and here Jesus starts to to preach this he says but you're laboring for the wrong meat and he says but labor not for the meat which perish but for the meat that endureth unto everlasting life listen what Jesus is saying labor for the meat that a man can eat of in other words labor for the food that a man can eat of and he shall never die you think about where that is in the scripture here's what this is what Jesus is talking about labor for the food that a man could eat of and never die where do we find that in Genesis the first chapter remember when Jesus or when God put the tree in the garden he said in the midst of the garden there was two trees one was the Tree of Life the other was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the Tree of Life a man could eat of and he would never die now watch Jesus as he speaks of this he said labor for the meat that a man could eat of and not die I thought isn't it something that these are the same words that Satan uses whenever he goes to deceive Eve he says that you can eat of this tree and thou shalt surely not die you can eat of this and in other words he may as well to said it like this you can eat of this tree and live because you won't not you'll not die you can eat I thought it was something that here Satan he led Eve to a deceitful Fruit by using God's Own word he said eat of this fruit Thou shalt not die eat of this fruit and you shall have life I thought isn't that the way the devil is he's always done that all the way till today we see the same thing the same the same offering of the devil Satan uses God's promises to deceive men they got these great Cathedrals and great uh uh great denominational systems around the world that'll say well join my church and God will bless you support my Ministry and God will bless you help me help me do this God's going to bless you see they use God's promises you're you're going to live forever and you're going to prosper and you ain't going to have to worry about nothing God's going to bless you why they're using God's promise this is Satan's trick to use God's promise for his own agenda to use God's promise to build up his own kingdom but let me ask you this what gives a man a right to use the promise of God for his own purpose he has no right for the Bible said there's only one place you can eat of a tree that you can eat of and have life and and then this is what Jesus said he said now you said where you going to get it Jesus said labor for for the meat that you can that that will endure under everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you so here what Jesus says he said there's a meat that will bring life and it'll be given to you by the son of man so there ain't but one place to get it ain't nobody else has it to offer he said there's a meat that'll bring life and it'll be given by the son of man oh friends think about it this morning that the meat of eternal life is in the possession of the son of man and Jesus said and he'll give it unto you listen as he begin to speak this to them but Mark they had no understanding of what he was saying and they said well our fathers ate Mana in he in the desert it was written that God would give them bread from Heaven to eat and Jesus said unto them he said Moses did not give you bread from Heaven he said but my father gives you the true bread from Heaven other words that was just me to satisfy your natural body for a few days it ain't going to be here it it don't Mount to nothing he said but my father gives you a true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth GL into the world the bread of God is he it wasn't a coriander seed it wasn't a a little uh honey wafer it wasn't a little uh communion bread but the bread of God was the person of Jesus Christ he said it's he that cometh down from heaven and giveth life into the world he said and unto them ever more give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst it was the children 's bread I am the bread of life I I'm offering it freely I'm giving it to the children let me tell you this children's bread brother Joe it just wasn't for the Jews there was a gentile one one time a gentile woman that went to Jesus and he fed her a little bit of it remember when she said my daughter needs to be healed he said but it's the children's bread it's not to be given to the dogs she said but even the dogs can have some of the crumbs off the master's table he said you said correctly and her daughter was healed that very hour so it it wasn't a matter you didn't have to be an Israelite to get the children's bread he said see it was given unto them freely freely brother Mark how did she receive it because she worshiped him she called him Lord she she called him what he was to her and and you realize that that same bread that she fed on is the same bread that they fed on in the days of the prophets it's the same bread they fed on in the days of Jesus the Same bread in the days of Paul it was the same bread in the days of the disciples and the apostles and that same bread has sustained this church church for 2,000 years and we're still feeding on it today I know there's a world of people that's trying to come up with a new gospel to get people to come to church and there's a world of people that try to come up with new program to keep people in church and keep their young people excited and on fire for God but let me tell you friends the same bread that they were feeding on 2,000 years ago it's brought the church all the way to now and it'll take it into a rapture we don't need a new bread some new food some some new church some new religion some new program some way to keep keep people in church what we need is the bread of life which is the person of Jesus Christ to be minister to the people and broken from the pullit that people could take it and feed on it and become the life of Jesus Christ it's what strengthened the church in the time of famine they shall be satisfied it's what's leading us but remember preaches this message called spiritual food in due season you think all the way down to where we are through all the history comes down to a prophet and and and he's preaching this messes spiritual food in due season and then this message at the end of it he has a prayer line this woman comes up to the prayer line and he begins to discern discern her and he says you know he says how do you do he said well this woman you've had female trouble and some things he said and you're nervous it's just the age to get nervous you've had complications of all kinds he said but you have a desire too and that's to receive the Holy Ghost he said that that's what what it is do you believe have you confessed everything she said yeah he said will you believe if I lay my hands and ask God to do it that the Holy Ghost will come she said yes sir he said let's pray now notice this bread of life he said it would be given by the son of man notice that who's really given this bread he says Dear God I lay my hands upon this woman in the apostolic form and I ask that she receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ may she receive it he said now don't doubt it it belongs to you it's yours it's the children's bread he said now you had a little funny feeling when I said female trouble didn't you yeah he said because that's what you had too now you just believe that you're going to be all right now and go thanking the Lord why because it was the children's bread see that children's bread brother Mark it brought healing it brought salvation it brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost you realize it was the son of man that gave bread in in in Jesus's Earthly Ministry now we we know that whenever whenever Christ would come we see him in these different offices the the Bible would tell us that there was an office of the son of man he would come as a Son of God he would come as a son of David on in the Millennium he said so but brother ra said but regardless son of man Son of God Son of David he said it's the same man all the time it's just like a father son Holy Ghost the office of God he was God the father he became God the son and he had to be God the Holy Ghost he said it wasn't three Gods it was one God with three manifestations or three attributes of the same God and so here just like the woman that met him in his Earthly Ministry and she came to him and called him Lord said while he was in his son of man Ministry but then he would be as Son of God and then he would be as son of David he said but it it was the same man all the time so brother Mark that means it didn't matter if it was 2,000 years ago it didn't matter if it was a 2,000 years from now it's the same bread giver and it's the same then and it's the same bread Giver now the same one that gave it in the in the days of Jesus Earthly Ministry is the same one that's feeding the church today and David said and he speaking of God God is ever merciful and he lendeth and his seed is blessed see it's the it's the same God no matter what office he's in he's the same bread Giver he's the same one feeding his church David says so depart from Evil and do good and dwell forever more even those that look like they were evil and wicked and all that David said so here's a way out depart from Evil and do good and and dwell forever more depart depart from evil and do good and in the famine you'll be satisfied depart from Evil and do good and then a time of drought there shall come a a spiritual rain up on the seat of God and you'll still be satisfied depart from Evil and do good listen while this was the promise to the church today that God said I will restore sayeth the Lord those that were that were falling the tree had been eaten down remember what Joel said it would been eaten down the pomor can canker wor the Locust of the caterpillar he had ate it down till there wasn't hardly anything left but God promised I would restore that same joy as he prophesied he would prophesy of the reign of God that would come upon the Earth David says depart from Evil do good and be satisfied I think of this famine I got a few more minutes we're just now getting started I think of this famine and how here we are living in this age of famine you look around the world today and I it kind of took my mind back to the story in Second Kings and and and I I'll just read this little part but the Bible says now jehoram the son of Ahab he worked evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and his mother but he put away the image of baale that his father had made but nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat which he made Israel to send and he departed not there from here see je jehoram brother Mark he had an opportunity when he came into the office of being a king to do to set things right he had an opportunity to to take the things that his father had built up and all all these other things and he had opportunity to set it straight in Israel but the Bible says he'd done away with part of it but he left the other part said so when he done it he he cleaved under the sins of jeroboam now I don't go into this but how many are you familiar with the sins of jeroboam the the sins of Jer what jeroboam done is when he came into the kingdom he was the man that said that that it's too far to go Worship in Jerusalem so we're going to make it easier on the people to worship God so we're make an easier way that you can be okay with God and we're to make it easier to be a believer after all we got we got to make room for those you know it's kind of hard to to to be a to be able to labor for the Lord and it's kind of hard to pray and you know and have a prayer closet anymore and it's kind of hard to go to church and make your way to the house of God and so you know what we're going to make a little bit different program to make it easier to go ahead and be able to call yourself a Christian so you can sleep better at night and feel like you're doing the right thing and so what Jared Bo boam did is he he took two calves and he said he said you don't have to go all the way to Jerusalem to worship he said I'm going to put one calf over in Dan and and I'm going to put the other calf over over in bethl now you know bethl which meant the house of God dam was a place of judgment so in the place of judgment he put a golden calf in the house of God he put a golden calf he said and this is going to be the place of your worship so Lo and look upon the gods that led you out of out of Egypt he made a place for the people to worship now notice how clever that he was because Jobo and brother Mark not only did he establish uh putting calves in the place of worship but but but whenever he done that he he literally took the name of God out of the church cuz no longer was it Jehovah God no longer was it Jehovah that brought us out of out of Egypt but but this is the god this golden calf God this is this is the deity that brought you out so he literally removed the name of God from the church and now the people they went the Bible says it caused all of Israel to sin because it was easier to go to Dan it was easier you but you notice how close that he kept it because the Bible says that jerob I wasn't going to get into him but the Bible says that jeroboam that he actually kept he actually established a priesthood I thought isn't it something that the priesthood that he established he established from the same way that Moses had said that a priesthood ought to be established he he established a priesthood he ordered people to come down and make sacrifices and do you know brother Wesley that the sacrifices they made were made the exact same way that God told Moses to tell the people to make a sacrifice so whenever jeroboam made these places of worship he made them so close to the way that God said to do it but the only problem was is they they they established priesthood they had a church they had a sacrifice they had a priest they just didn't have no God I thought isn't it something that's the way a lot of people get that's where this world is today they got churches they've got a priesthood they've got pull pits they come to church they Shout with everybody they oh they shout Jesus and raise their hand Dance all over the building and speak in tongues but they got all of that but they had no God see put all it was all there sacrifice was there good preacher was there good singing good worship but there was no God friends let me tell you something I'd rather be in a p bar worshiping God than to be in the biggest cathedral in the world without God I'd rather have a church with 200 Spirit-filled people than 10,000 people that didn't have the spirit of God see established a place it was easier to worship God we don't want that kind of church I want a church with God in it we ain't replacing god with something else I want a church with God in it sure we worship God but we worship God cuz God's in it we ain't replacing with some uh some Grandpa God that makes everybody feel good so that they'll keep coming back to church friends it a I ain't worried about you coming here I'm worried about you getting right with God and being able being able to make a Rapture and your soul being okay with God when you meet God one day that's our desire so let's make a place make a place easier to worship make it where everybody can fit in isn't that the church world have you seen the the division of of of the the the Methodist churches lately that it's just a great it's all over the news of how that they're dividing because one will accept homosexual preachers and and then the other one won't and one will allow these kind and so the the churches are divided now there's a second third and fourth and fifth of them because of the the the way they're that some won't accept it in some wood is it something just to we just want to make everybody welcome we want to make room for everybody well there is room for everybody at the altar there's room for everybody there but it ain't room for sin see we got to make a place that was true worship it was sin to put another God in the place of God it was a sin it was idolatry so the Bible says here this is that's a little background of what's causing what's happening in in Israel with jehoram the Bible says he he kept the the the the ways of jeroboam and it came to pass when Ahab died that the king of Moab came against Israel remember Moab and Ahab Ahab was a great king had great military so so they would never go against Ahab because of the power that he had to with the Nations and so but they saw that Ahab was gone and it looked like it was easier to go in so now new king come in the Bible says here come Moab they rebelled against the king of Israel and jehoram he went out to Samaria he numbered all of Israel he went to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and he and he said the king of Moab is rebelled against me will you go with me against Moab in battle he said I am as Thou Art my people as thy people and he said well which way shall we go up and he answered and they he said let's go through the Wilderness of Edom so here what brother Mark what they're doing is they're building a unified body of people so they so they come in and they're they're trying to make a union so he comes he said let's go to Edom we'll get another king and another Army there and then we'll be able to face Moab let's go get somebody else on our side and then we'll be able to face Moab let's build up our army a little bit more then we'll go then we'll be able to face them and so they went out and they bu bued up and the Bible says the king of Israel and Judah and Edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and then they got there and there was no water for the host and the cattle that followed them and the king of Israel said alas the Lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab look at the place that all of Israel had gotten to the leaders look where they had led them they LED all the great armies of all these Israel armies and they LED them to the brink of Destruction and finally but Mark after all of this all this I don't have time to go through it all but all these dealings that when you can read part in Chronicles and second Kings it goes a little more detail but but all of this that they had that they had done and they LED them finally all the decisions they made brother wesy finally there was a voice of wisdom that spoke a man finally says he says is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of him is there a Prophet somewhere that we could inquire of the Lord by him I thought my after trying after asking everybody what we ought to do finally somebody got got enough sense to say but is there a prophet in the land that we could inquire of him of what the will of God really is is there not a prophet that would give us an answer that would that would give us a real Direction everybody has a direction that we ought to go every everybody has an opinion where what we ought to do in this situation everybody has a way to handle it but is there not a prophet in the land that we could inquire of that the Lord would give us the right direction to go a voice of wisdom spoke and so finally he he asked him and I love this cuz the Bible said can I I'm just I'm just I'm just feeling home I love it because the Bible said and one of the Servants of the king of Israel answered it wasn't a great man that had the answer it was a little servant it wasn't some great some great potentate that said oh King I know where we'll go for the end the Bible says but one of the servants says there is a prophet his name's Elisha I thought yeah I wish I knew the servant's name that when they're all asking is there not a prophet somewhere but it took a little servant this little nobody was down there in the army they got they goty he got forced to be in the army proba didn't even want to be there forced to serve the king here he was a little slave of the king and that little slave went along with him in battle he didn't even want to be in the position they were in he didn't want to be in that condition they were in brother wesy but when they got in trouble and they said is are not a prophet that little servant said I may not know a lot oh King but I know who the prophet is I may not know all the answers but I know who the prophet is and his name's Elisha and matter of fact I know where he lives I know how to get a hold of him it took a servant to say there's a there's a Prophet by the name of Elisha he was the one he he was the one that glory to God I feel good this he he said he was the one that poured water over the hands of Elijah he's a great prophet see brother brother Mark here was the problem here they were overwhelmed in the desert with no water in the middle of a you could you could call it a drought cuz they had no water in the place that they were the enemy was banded against them they had nowhere to turn brother Bobby and then here Elisha the prophet would come and when Elisha spoke the answer that he came he said well sayeth the Lord make this Valley full of ditches what an odd answer we're in the middle of a drought we're thirsting to death we are are C we we we we can't hardly go another day and survive and the prophet that they inquired of gave them an answer and said dig a bunch of ditches from one end of this Valley to the other make the valley full of ditches can you imagine that answer and we're out here in the middle of a desert and you're and we're asking for water we're asking for something to qu our thirst and your answer is for me to dig ditches your answer for me is to do is to take a shovel and a and a pickax and a hammer and go to chunk and rock and and pile I wonder how many would look at that and say I'm not following after that well I don't even make sense why why would somebody tell you to go out and after all I can I can prove it to you by science that if you're if you're out of water and you're about to thirst to death that digg in a d ditch and sweating and all that that's going to make it quicker for you to die this I I can prove it to you this is bad advice you know what they did brother Mark they obeyed the Lord the Bible says they went to dig in the ditches I thought isn't it as they went to digging ditches do you realize that the whole time that they dug there was never a single sign of Deliverance hello somebody the whole time that they dug brother wesy there were here there there was not one sign of water every shovel full there was never a sign of water every Rock they threw out there was never a sign of water there was not nothing there some Supernatural happening every time they dug something there was a little drop and there was a little drop they dug and dug and dug and they saw no water you say well what you know how easy it would have been to give up digging you how many how many ever felt that way I trying to commit my life to God but there ain't nothing moving I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to get get on on the on the right path but there ain't nothing moving I'm trying to commit everything the Lord but but there ain't no sensation there there ain't no feeling I all that that I'm trying to do everything but I'm getting nothing out of it there was no there was no proof there was no there was no proof of water you say well what they do all they could go on was thus sayeth the Lord this is what Elisha said he said for thus sayeth the Lord You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain but the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink that both you and your cattle and your Beast for Mar and the Bible said and then Elisha said and this is just a light thing in the sight of the Lord for he will also deliver the moabites into your hands think about it every enemy every the very thing that would that would cause all of the problem that was going on all all this trial these were men listen friends these were men that allowed the sins of jeroboam to remain in Israel these were men that if you looked at them and said well the Judgment of God ought to be struck on them and they should never they should never be out of that but you realize but they're not the one that they're not the one that placed that calf there and God had mercy upon them and he looked at them they're not the one that that that that put them themselves and they just followed some bad advice man I'm G to preach a minute but they just followed some bad advice and it got him into that situation he said but God but God saw him there he said you you'll not see it but thus sayith the Lord he'll bring you out here there's many today that are preparing they prepare for a feeling they're preparing for a refilling of the Holy Ghost they want to be filled up with God you realize that sometimes our lives they get so filled with many things but empty of the spirit of God you say well what do you do when it gets like that when you start digging what do you do when my life's so filled with many things but it but I just can't break through anymore you start digging well what do you dig out brother man well the more you dig out the more room for God there is so if you say well how much do I dig well let me ask you this how much God do you want how how long should I dig well how how much God do you want in you anyway what kind of relationship with God do you want to have what you just keep digging the more room you dig or the more you dig the more room for the supernatural the more you dig the more room for the Holy Ghost you realize they just kept digging and digging to make room for water you think of this they followed a compass into trouble brother Joe they didn't they they followed a a leading into that the compass but you realize that that Compass I I don't have time to get into this but that Compass It could only guide them in geographical things it it was an Earthly compass what they needed was a spiritual Compass see the natural Compass took them only so far to where they were in trouble and then they had to find another Compass so see they they the Bible says they followed a compass for seven days they wound up defeated they were on the brink of Destruction they were in the middle of a drought what that Compass did for seven days is it brought all the kings together in one unified cause and it led them into a drought into a famine and it took the spirit of Elijah to bring them out of it I thought isn't that the way it was in the days of of Second Kings and and brother Mark in the days today it's the same I thought isn't that odd that they followed a compass for seven days you ever think about the church history and look where we've came since the time of Jesus Christ you you go all through the history and I I won't I've got pages of it but but you can in in the 1500s when when Martin Luther raised up and he put the the 95 thesis on on the on the on the the Wittenberg door and and then and then we go we see how that he translated the the New Testament into a German Bible and then and then three years later William tendel he he makes he makes another Bible in the English trans translation they're they're trying to get the word of God out you listen what they're they're following a compass Through the Ages and God is using these men but you notice as as these things begin to grow and the Bible begins to be printed and people get it that all of a sudden just because they're doing something good don't mean that Satan ain't there trying to upset the program of God so here are these Great Men of God that are doing good things but I'm Mark and they're trying to to follow the lord and they're they're following but you notice what happened to the church over this time you see so many great men John Smith when he raised up in 1609 he formed the Baptist Church 1735 George Whitefield was converted to Christ he became one of the greatest evangelist that the world had ever seen John Wesley in 1738 he was he was converted it's what started the the work of the Methodist Church after that and then we we see as As Time continued to go on in 1870 the Vatican listen all this is happening in history as these churches are being formed and leaders are starting these works but the and then in 1870 the Vatican Council comes out and announces that the church or the the pope is now infallible just like God so in 1870 no longer was he just a figurehead but he became infallible so that means whatever word that he says from now on it's going to be God speaking so you see how that the churches and it just seems to kind of finger off in so many different directions 1872 Jehovah's Witness started 1906 the isza Street Revival lunch a Pentecostal movement in 1914 the Assemblies of God denomination was founded everybody's looking for a place or they're looking for a place to to worship they're looking for a direction they're looking for the leadership of God everybody's looking for the right answer centuries of time brother Mark referred to by the theological world as a modern era premodern era Middle Ages late ancient era 2,000 years have gone by but now 2 years later we come to a place of this Great Famine where we would have a full revelation of what the Bible prophesies of the age that we're living in it was never prophesied that it would be until now but it was prophesied it would be here this is what Paul said remember I'm just going to quote this but Paul said but in the ages to come he might show you mighty things so Paul knew that there was coming ages after after Christ had had left the Earth he said there's coming ages Revelations the second and third chapter the whole entire chapters actually talk about the ages that are coming from the time of Christ unto the unto the angel of the church I speak this you know all all the way through both he says but notice as these Ages come the world calls them era the world calls them time periods but but Paul said there's ages that are coming butam said now he said we see these seven Church ages that we've gone through but notice what the purpose of the revelation of this was today but said it wasn't sent to destroy people let me tell you why that God would send the spirit of Elijah in the age that we live in he said see it was wasn't sent to destroy people it was sent as a message of Mercy to turn people back to God he said now these little messages out of the Book of Revelation they are directed to the church he said I wish everyone would bear this in mind that they are not directed towards anybody's religion or any other motive only just to be my best of knowledge to the reading and the explaining of the word of God it's not to push through selfish motive it's not directed towards anybody or any individual or anybody's church or anybody's religion but the reason listen now but the reason that I like to teach on this Revelation here at the Tabernacle being my own church why I feel like I'm home and I know that I kind of give my sheep the kind of diet that I think they need a't that something here stands a prophet of God they're starting all kinds of churches they're preaching all kinds of doctrines he said but look where we came from here's where we are and here's where we're going and the reason that I'm feeding this to this church is because I feel like my sheep need a certain kind of diet see we're not but Mark we're not trying to be famous that's why we eat on this diet we're not trying to be to fit in into denomination that's why we feed on this diet we're not trying to build some great church or be established or to get the world to recognize who we are or to recognize us as some great movement that's why we're feeding on this diet said I feed on them because they need that kind of I thought they need that kind of diet I thought they needed it there's a people brother Mark that needs a that need a special kind of die you know why we're not preparing to stay we're preparing for a Rapture that's why we're not preparing to fit in the world we're preparing to leave the world that's why the food's a little bit different that's why when sometimes when people come they say well them people man they get into some stuff I never heard before it's a special diet it's prepared for a certain kind of people say what kind of people in the time of famine God's people will be satisfied there's going to be something that God has prepared for his children in the last day that'll take them through the famine that is upon the land that's why we preach the message brother Mar it's the same message Paul preached even when he didn't have a full revelation of it but here the brother man would come and say I preach what Paul preached and that same message today is still feeding the church since the time of Christ you think about it in the seven and I'm I'm closing in the since the time of Christ in the middle through these seven Church ages you think about what has happened what these churches and these men I didn't go through them all but but but these these men these the the all through 2,000 years that have got ideas and theologies and they all came from different groups but you realize that they followed a compass that led them right into the middle of leod deia I thought that was something in Second Kings they followed a compass seven days now we've seen the church World follow follow a compass through seven Church ages and it brought them right into the middle of leod DEA what is it it's a spiritual drought it's a famine in the land it's a hunger and a thirst for the word of God they follow the compass and what they done is they went out you think think about it in the middle of all this they form what is called the the the the uh the the the the fellowship of churches or or they United together with the the World Council of churches they United together with these great fellowships and great councils and and they became more concerned with with whose card their name was on and how many members they had and they they got more concerned with the wrong things even though they were unified and they came together for a unified cause they came right into the middle of leod deia all unified together and still in the middle of a drought and still in the middle of a famine and I thank God that somebody had enough wisdom to say but is there a prophet in the land that can find us a word of the Lord and I thank God that there's still a servant here to say in the middle of a famine in the middle of a drought in the middle of failure there somebody we can look to that still has the answer many find their s here brother Mah they followed the wrong compass and it led them to they man let me tell you friends people's spiritual Compass is so messed up they can't even find their way to church anymore their Compass gets so messed up they can't find their way to prayer meeting they can't find their way on their knees before God their their worldly Compass has taken over it can't they can't ain't no time to have a relationship with God ain't no the the compass don't don't give them the leading that God would give this worldly Compass has led people to an intellectual gospel into an intellectual relationship with God you realize God never called for that he didn't call for an intellectual relationship he called for a spiritual relationship wasn't an intellectual understanding it was a spiritual understanding it wasn't intellectual knowledge it was a spiritual knowledge but you see the situations people are in you find out they've used the wrong Compass think about it even even Earthly things you think about you take a magnetic compass how many of you ever used a compass as the music players want to come you take a compass you realize that a compass you can take a compass and it'll still fail you you you say well what would cause a a compass to to malfunction you well it works off the off the magnetic field of the Earth so you could take a compass and you know I thought this was such a such a true statement said but a natural Compass it can malfunction because it could possibly caused by external influences or another magnetic field that would draw it in the wrong direction is't that something an external influence God gave us a compass but sometimes that Compass sometimes if you get the if you get to use in a worldly Compass you get to use in a a church Compass or something some some denomination Compass you could hold that but external influence it could it gets off they go this way that way objects they fall they go wrong way they you realize that when they were these Earthly objects fail but the mark thing because that's what we've relied on these great things that great churches that people relied on but it led them into a famine LED them into a drought but you realize that whenever your compass fails I want to let me just ask you this how many's ever wound up somewhere you didn't intend on be it see because sometimes we take the wrong Compass can just be real sometimes you get the wrong compass and you get to fall on the wrong that leads you down past you don't mean to go down places you shouldn't go you wind up how in the world I ever get hear external forces just pulling pulls it out but what we need is we need a different kind of compass that ain't EarthBound see that Earthly Compass you can make the best one it can be goldplated put diamond bezel it'll still get off so there has to be a compass something that we can look to brother Mark that don't ever get off said see so what God done is God put something in the heavens that just can't fail you go outside tonight brother Mark and you get to looking up in the sky you'll find that you'll find that load star they call it the Post Star the North Star you can go out and any of you ever studied the Stars I always I I've been a bit of that guilty of that myself but you go out on the Big Dipper and you take the last two stars of it you can run you a straight line from the end of those and you'll see on the on the The Little Dipper the the very last star in the handle of it that's the North Star you can always find it whenever you find that it don't matter it don't matter where you're lost anywhere in the northern hemisphere you can see the North Star and it remains true and the reason it remains true is because it sits in the a in the axis of the center of the Earth from the rotation of the earth and so because it sits in the axis it don't matter anywhere in the hemisphere that you look up it's always going to be North so don't matter if you're in Colorado it don't matter if you're over there in China anywhere in the northern hemisphere you can always see the North Star said see so no matter where the Earth is turning brother B said no matter where the Earth is turning the North Star always remains it points towards north it's the only true star he said it's an extreme North Star and it gives you your direction so even when your Earthly Compass will fail you but that can never fail he said and that's what Christ is to you if you want to go to heaven if you want to be saved if you want to be filled with the spirit of God if you want to be Christlike Christ is your North Star if you're lost don't take a Creed he's your North Star he's your way he's your direction and if you'll take him as your North Star then it absolutely places the Holy Spirit as your compass the Holy Spirit becomes your compass It'll point you to the North Star if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can't help but point you to Christ and Christ is the word that's the only way you'll ever find your way back many are lost in the wilderness brother Mark but if you ever look to that he said it'll lead you back all kinds of stars you realize you realize why you can't pick another star why can't you pick another star that's in the little dier let me tell you why brother wesy because as the Earth is rotating and you look at that star that star one day it'll be over here and the next day it'll be over here the next day it'll be down here but because the one is in the center of the axis it never moves and always remains North the other's kind of changing it kind of changes the direction where you would look but the North Start it'll never change say see so you can look at all the other stars and say well that one's shining so maybe I'll go after it a little while but you'll wind up somewhere else this is an easy experiment just go outside and find a star and start walking so man go after this one a little bit that one's shining you got somewhere else but you got to get somewhere where you're absolutely established he say so Christ is our North Star and the compass always points that way and if you're really saved and you really only one and the really only way you can be saved is through Christ the Holy Spirit be in your compass he will guide you right straight to the word he said that's wonderful the word and the Christ is one both of them the selfsame he is your North Star and if he is your North Star he'll become your absolute as you stand to your feet this morning see as far as a a natural Compass brother Mark they' take you as far as it could take you they had to turn to a spiritual one they turn the prophet Elisha he said thus sayth the Lord make a valley full of ditches and then God will come and save you your animals will be fed you'll be fed in this time of famine and nevertheless that's just a light thing for the Lord to feed you but I'll defeat your enemy and so they dug and dug and dug and the Bible says that all of a sudden after they dug this that when they dug to the place that God thought it was enough they dug out but Mark if you want to get anywhere with God you dig they dug out until it was enough and then the Bible said and then there was water God flooded the valley let me tell you what the valley did it was so much water they drank and that great Army of Moab they came up over the mountain and they looked down in the valley and the Bible says when they looked at the valley that the sun Shone on the water in such a way that the water looked red and the moabites said well it's blood they've all gotten a fight and they they've all destroyed theel we don't need weapons let's just go gather the spoils the battle's over so that great moabit Army walked right down into the valley full of ditches and the children of God brother Mark that was restored the ones that had turned to the words of Elisha the one they had they had forgot about all their own Direction and their own questions and and they they had turned their heart back to what Elisha said they took their weapons in their hand and they slew every moabit they slew every enemy they slew every thing that would come against their family you realize what Moab wanted they wanted to destroy their homes they wanted to destroy the fathers they wanted to destroy their families their churches everything they stood for they wanted to tear them down to nothing but God gave them the power to overcome their enemy you say brother man what I got to do this morning if you want to overcome go dig a ditch what I got to dig you dig everything out well well brother you know I've been going to church a long time do I got a dig yeah you still got a dig well I'm a deacon in the church do I got a dig yeah you got a dig well well I'm a p Pastor in the church do I got to dig yeah you really got to dig everybody dig it out and make more room for God if you want God in your life dig out what don't belong there and allow God to have a place if there's something in your life you want free of this morning dig it out and make room for God throw it out somewhere and make room for God it takes a total surrender it takes a becoming a nobody but said that's what the thing of it is he said when there you want to have nothing having nothing so you can depend on your own self anything you can do it takes a complete toal surrender of your weaknesses unto God and say here I am I have nothing no ability I can trust in he said and God will take always a nobody and make them a somebody said what about the big somebodies that are already somebodies there ain't no room for them there's room for them tell you what the prophet said he said if you're a somebody what you ought to do is just become a nobody and then let God make you a real somebody so no matter who we are dig it out total surrenderance he said that's what it takes it takes it takes taking everything out they God always he said consider the apostles he take bypass the Nobles and the educated and the celebrities and he found a bunch of nobodies and he made some bodies he used them said this is what we do say what do we do brother the Mark we take when we surrender to God you dig things out of your life what is that it's a sign of surrenderance Lord I don't know where it came from but I don't want it no more how many say that this morning I wonder if somebody lift their hands say brother may let me dig things out of my life Lord I I don't know where it came let me lift my hands with you this morning Lord I I don't know where it came from I don't know how it got there but Lord can let me just dig it out how many how many take the shovel and just dig it out maybe just lift your hand to the Lord say Lord I pray you take it this morning let me make a little bit more room for you God let you have a place to dwell this morning that I could be filled and satisfied in the time of a famine a total surrenderance everybody said let me tell you what will happen he said when you surrender to God he said that's what Paul done Paul was a scholarly man he but he forgot everything he knew in order to know Christ Paul said I'm determined to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified he became a nobody he wasn't a know it all he was a no nothing he was a nobody he said I don't know nothing except Jesus Christ and God used him in a mighty way because he was committed to surrendering fully unto God but said think about this how many knows this today that God has enough power to overcome how many believes that God can he can destroy every enemy he can defeat every battle he's he's an omnipotent God how many believes that say Amen let me tell you what the prophet of God said he said if you'll take a man that is total surrendered that man is omnipotent just like God is a man that is totally surrendered is omnipotent think about it we believe God is but what about you overcoming he said if you'll totally surrender you're omnipotent that's what Jesus said in the Book of Mark he said ask anything in my name and it shall be given unto you they become om nied brother Braham said when you surrender your life fully he'll come in fully but until you surrender he can't come in fully so surrender every thought surrender your thinking Surrender Your Life Surrender Your all surrender your prestige surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost that's what he's here to do what he's here to do fill you to surrender to God may we just Lift Our Lord the
