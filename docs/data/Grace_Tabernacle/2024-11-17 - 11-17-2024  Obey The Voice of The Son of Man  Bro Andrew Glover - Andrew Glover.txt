we just pray the Lord's richest blessings upon brother Xavier and Sister Jordan amen this new chapter their lives and amen how many's thankful for what God's doing for the young people amen amen I believe the Lord is raising up trophies and testimonies of what this message does and amen we sure love him this morning St John chapter 5 and verse 21 the Bible here says for as the father raiseth up the dead and qu quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but he hath committed all judgment unto the son somebody say the son that all men should honor the son even as th as they honor the father for he that honth not the son honth not the Father which hath sent him so the father hath sent the son verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath Everlasting in life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life I love to hear a prophet of God read that scripture one time he stops he says now rub that out if you can amen you can't rub that promise out it's an eternal promise verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man somebody say because he is the Son of Man Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth now watch this they that had done good unto the resurrection of life and they that had done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now in the Book of Revelations the 10th chapter Revelations chapter 10 another scripture Here We Know by heart this morning in Revelations chapter 10 in verse number 7 amen we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen Revelations chapter 10 and verse number seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished or should be filled as Heath declar to his servants the prophets now one other place I want to look is in Luke chapter 17 St Luke chapter 17 how many's thankful this morning for the message of the hour amen St Luke chapter 17 and verse number 30 St Luke 17 in verse number 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed I love what the prophet of God says or Jesus Christ is made manifest in his people we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today I want to uh by the help of the Lord from those passages of scripture I want to speak to you today on this thought of obeying the voice of the son of man obey the voice of the son of man uh some time ago I came across a quote where the prophet of God was saying and he was speaking to the people and he actually says this phrase he said now see he's just using my voice and I began to study that in the 1956 I want to read this quote just to lay a foundation 1956 in the message Faith Charlotte North Carolina he says now I'm going to ask you all to be reverent just as reverent as you can you say now brother brandom what are you talking about you're just stalling he said well I am exactly see I'm waiting for that angel of the Lord to come that's exactly right I don't know none of you and how could how could I do anything I can't it's him I can't do it even when he comes unless your faith operates it it's not me see I cannot see Visions unless it's your faith that does it sure he said now God's Will by Divine gift he said the only thing I do is just keep yielding myself and as I get myself completely yielded to the holy spirit amen then he starts talking amen when I when I linger and I wait on the angel of the Lord to come and I get myself completely yielded to the Holy Spirit then he starts talking it's not me he is using my voice see it's not me it's him that's just exactly what the scripture says so amen therefore this morning we have to make a declaration as a church we believe that God still speaks I know a lot of denominations don't but as the Church of the Living God this morning we believe that God still has a voice and he is still able to speak he said now and if you hear a voice speaking to you he said that's God because it copes with the scripture if it doesn't then there's some kind of a wrong voice that's speaking to you amen but the right voice will tell you to follow the rules of the Bible so if it's a scriptural voice that voice will tell you Amen to follow the rules of the Bible he said no sprinkling no pouring no falsely amen come right straight out and follow the rules of the Bible now we all know this morning that God Amen has spokesmen and God sends amen men to speak on his behalf in Hebrews chap 12 and verse 25 the Bible said see that you refuse not him amen that speaketh for if they Escape not who refused him that spake on the earth and how much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven look at this word speaketh it means to articulate sounds it means to declare one's mind amen by speech or by sound now when you start talking about sounds if you study the message you know am then that there's actually two types of sounds amen there is a certain sound amen and then there is an uncertain sound Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 14:8 he said if the trumpet give an uncertain sound amen then who shall prepare himself for the battle amen so there is a sound there is a trumpet amen which is announcing a b a battle Revelation 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice amen as of a trumpet the seven Church ages brother man picks this up he said now a trumpet is an announcement he said Gab at the coming of the Lord shall sound a trumpet amen of God this was God's trumpet blowing in other words he's fixing to announce amen the Eternal destination of the world so when now now when that trumpet sounds it's bringing forth an announcement amen but that announcement is connected to a destination he said a trumpet what is it get ready I'm going to give you the revelation of Jesus Christ to give to the church amen I will speak to you and what will be the destination of the world Amen is for those who receive amen and those who reject see a trumpet of God attention every man amen when the trumpet blows he grabs his sword he stands to a place of attention amen if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound amen then who shall prepare himself for the War I just want to say this to you this morning amen that there is a sounding of a gospel trumpet amen that is announcing the destination of the world Amen but what's going to determine the destination amen is the attitude towards the voice that is speaking amen the Revelation that will determine your destination I'll say this morning we are not listening to any kind of trumpet we are listening to a gospel trumpet and the prophet of God said oh you can go ahead and take that uncertain sound if you want to amen but I like the gospel trumpet amen because that gives a certain sound he said what is the gospel trumpet amen it's the good news amen that's right that he's here now amen and there's nothing uncertain about it amen let me sound the gospel trumpet to you this morning amen that Jesus Christ is not in a grave in Jerusalem amen and neither is he in a grave in Jeffersonville amen but he is alive and he is well this morning and he is right here in Grace Tabernacle Amen in the power of his resurrection in the form of the Holy Ghost to minister to every need Amen to deliver every heart listen I'll tell you what when we hear this trumpet it ain't time to tuck tail and run it's time to draw our sword amen and face this devil we are not a bunch of sissies we are not a bunch of pansies amen but we are warriors who have been called amen by the voice of God in this age to stand Amen on the word of God listen Malachi 4 was promised to come in this age and he was was not coming Amen to bring peace he was coming to declare war amen a true prophet of God is not sent amen or not man-made amen but a true prophet of God is God sent and I find it amazing that God Amen from the beginning from Eden brother says from Eden amen and since Eden has kept his voice alive amen through the prophets amen all the way from Eden Amen to now amen The Voice of God has never died that's powerful he has kept it alive through the prophets brother said watch he said when the devil F he silenced Abel he said God raised up se he said and the same voice think about this the same voice that spoke in Eden amen is speaking here this morning you say the same voice amen how many voices does God have amen he has one voice amen that sounds to many Waters listen and this morning the voice of God Amen is not weak the voice of God is Not powerless amen but the voice of God still has the authority Amen to speak and when he speaks things begin to shake I say oh God this morning amen come in our Sunday morning service and begin to speak to our young people begin to speak to our homes begin to speak to our family listen when God begins to speak things begin to shake let me just say this it is very important Amen to believe that God Amen sent someone to speak amen it's very important to believe that God sent him amen that speaketh amen now watch this and to receive him you say to receive him well the works of God Amen is believing and receiving on he whom God has sent remember said the Dark Ages amen the word somebody shout the word was almost entirely amen lost to the people amen but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word amen was lost because organization amen tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word he said they could no longer speak for God he said but then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word amen for his day amen the people who took his Revelation from God listen they became amen the living of read and known of all men for their generation and when the Methodist failed amen God raised up others and so it has gone on Amen through the years until in this last day oh God there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age listen God raised up Luther and they spoke for God he raised up Wesley and they spoke for God he raised up Pentecost and they spoke for God but the minute they went towards organization was the minute God left them but he couldn't let his voice die amen because his voice has been alive since Eden and it's still speaking this morning well let me say this amen the seventh angel in a physical Corporal body is not on the earth amen but the voice is still here so there has been a transfer amen of the voice in this age listen amen the voice that was in the prophet has now come into the prophecy listen I can say to you this morning you are not a voiceless people you are not a silenced people you have received the message of the hour you are saying the same thing that a prophet has already said you know what I say I say there is an authority upon you that's why the devil's trying to paralyze your vocal cords that's why he trying to paralyze your praise because he knows you're more than just a bunch of church members in a Sunday morning service but you are a prophetic class of people the devil knows the voice of God that was all the way back in Eden it's right here in this building this morning and you are in position to speak the word of God and go forward listen there's a final voice to the final age listen if there's a final voice and there's a final age then there's got to be a final people come on Church there's got to be a final people and you are the final people who are the written Epistles listen you are the Revelation in flesh he said when you get the Living Word in you you to have the Living God in you because the word Here Is God When It's Made flesh in you see made spirit and life in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life amen then you are a living example when the word of God goes into your flesh and gets into your faith and it becomes life then you are a living example let me say this I want you to remember this it is important Amen to receive somebody say receive receive it is important to believe somebody say believe amen it is important to receive and to believe he that speaketh but it is also important to obey somebody say obey amen the voice so you believe the voice you receive the voice but you got to obey the voice in Exodus chapter 23 you will see that they were instructed Amen to believe the angel a to receive the angel and to believe the angel and to obey the angel it was more than just acknowledging there was an angel but they had to receive the angel they had to believe the angel but if they was going to receive the blessing of the appearing of the Angel they had to obey the angel he said behold I sent Exodus 23:20 behold I sent an angel before thee Amen to keep keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression watch for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak now watch here's the blessing brother Bobby that I will be an enemy unto thine

of this Bible has returned in the Church of the Living God he's here to take away sickness he's here to bless the bread he's here to bless the water he's here to cut off the enemies listen because we're not a disobedient people you say obedience well the Bible said behold is better to obey than sacrifice you say obedience obedience is very important Church you know what brother said he said obedience is the best that's right obedience is very important he said obedience is the best I love this one obedience unlocks the supernatural my goodness in Genesis 22:15 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abram Out of Heaven the second time and said behold myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou H has done this thing and H has not withheld thy son amen thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and then multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore listen and thy seed amen shall possess the gates of his enemies are y'all hearing me Abraham's obedience un oh God it unlocked a supernatural blessing upon his seed which was Isaac listen friends today we are still reaping the benefits of Abraham's obedience thousands of years later because it unlocked a blessing on the seat of Isaac oh can I say something to your parents amen your obedience is going to unlock a blessing on them babies your obedience will unlock a blessing upon your household amen but I tell you what Disobedience will do it'll block the blessings of God it'll shut off the supernatural I say oh God amen give us an obedient Spirit you say well I don't think obedience matters amen can I say this Amen in the middle of the time that you're having to struggle to obey it don't look like much but when you get years down the road and you look back and you see amen because of that simple obedience I am a blessed man I was preaching one time amen out in Oklahom at Bryce Collins and brother Merl Applegate was sitting there some of y'all probably know Merl am then his brother wendle one of his song leaders there actually is Jonathan Martin's father-in-law Loris Daddy and I sitting there preaching and all of a sudden I was just preaching along and brother brother David he had just told me the day before he said brother Andrew he said there was never a time when I was raising my kids that church was a question in my mind I said well I believe that he said no he said we lived I think it was two hours amen away from py Oklahoma they'd come out of some situations in church trouble and false doctrines and things he said our church was 2 hours he said I had to get up at 3:00 in the morning and be at the post office for work he said but Wednesday night never was an option now it might get tight here but we might as well preach he said Wednesday night never was an option he said if we left work and drove to church he said I would sleep on the way back home get to the house go in change and go to work and it just dawned on me amen today his daughters are married to preachers amen all his grandbabies are in the house of God are you all hearing me amen they lost his son a few years ago in a tragic accident amen but he standing on the shores of Glory a been waiting on their arrival you know what I say to you I say don't you let some lukewarm leoty and devil amen convince you amen that obeying the word of God is out of style I'll say you can never go wrong by obeying the word of God yes sometimes you may have to struggle and sometimes you may have to do without but but you know what I say amen I say on the other side when you see the blessings of God upon your babies and upon your grand babies you'll shout the Hallelujah to Eternity that you obeyed the word of God in the face of Leon toy and influence yes sir amen obedience is what God wants listen byy seed amen shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice B said when God called Moses he didn't want to go those prophets had such things to do that it was a hard thing to do he said they didn't want to go out and be scorned at they wanted to have fellowship and go in with the rest of them and go along with Brothers he said I forget what prophet it was that said I don't want to do this in other words but my whole heart will catch a fire because God has spoken and I must deliver it he said whether they liked it whether they crucified him whether they stoned him whatever they did amen God had spoken his heart and he must say it now listen not to be different but to be obedient so when a prophet begin to speak he was not saying things he meant to be different Brother David he was saying things to be obedient because obedience is better than sacrifice he said God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice he was their action now watch a prophet bring this from the prophet into the prophecy he said give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God to their every action and move is thus saith the Lord right amen they will walk in that Shak kind Glory he said I will show you a messiah amen an anointed one of God Amen now watch this standing somebody say standing standing upon the Earth listen the signs of of God Amen they're always overlooked and brother said one of the one of God's signs amen is the coming of a prophet he said now listen the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time see they Overlook it they never get it amen L their eyes are open to see it now watch this amen those who are elected to see it amen they do see it but the are y'all ready for this the coming of a prophet was the sign that God is ready to speak cuz God ain't going to speak amen if the prophet wouldn't be on the earth now remember he wouldn't be on the earth unless God was ready to speak there would not be a prophet on the earth brother Carter unless God was ready to speak he said that's the way he speaks amen through those channels now you all know when a prophet comes amen there is a sign amen and there is a voice remember said listen he wants an audience he wants somebody amen that's going to listen to what he is going to say he said now the sign is an alert to attract the attention of the people that the word is getting ready to speak when you see the sign it is an announcement that there's a voice that's behind that sign listen the sign is not your focus it's the voice behind the sign that you are elected to hear many will see the sign but only the elected amen will hear the voice can I say this to you and the voice is the word and the word is God oh church can I say it like this we had to move a few years ago and you give me some Liberty if that's okay we had a move a few years ago believe the sign believe the sign get buper stickers amen get on her get our t-shirts believe this time and look where that is today amen it's a bunch of reprobates on a computer a been fighting against God's message and I studied one day I studied one day brother man and I read where the prophet of God said he said now look what he said he said see the sign and believe the voice I said oh my goodness right there where they missed it amen they were too focused on the sign and they built everything on the sign that they never heard the voice listen you can get out of line with a sign amen but the voice will bring the sign into balance with the of God you know what I say to you this morning I say thank God for the sign but I'm not a sign Seeker I am a voice believer it's the voice of the bridegroom it's the voice of my beloved I hear his voice and his voice has called me from the confusion of Leota and it set me up on a rock hallelujah I wasn't just elected to see the sign I was elected to hear the voice but said look he said Abraham was elected to hear that that voice he said and when he heard that voice he obeyed The Voice look what the voice said now now you all say it's hard look what Abraham heard come out from amongst your people Abraham all right they're the thing of it is they're doubters and they're unbelievers and they'll have you in the same fix amen come on out and separate yourself and live for me what is it leave all your conscience and senses behind you and open up your mind and remember it's me come live with me amen God brother said God is calling every Seed of Abraham this morning to the same kind of a life the great battle is on now worldwide amen God wants his children separating thems from what from see taste feel smell hear imagination conscience memory reason affection everything open up your mind and let the word come in amen and March with the word that's the real Soldier the real Soldier is a seat of Abraham who can separate from the five outer senses and the five inner senses and they can put on their marching shoes they can get their sword in their hand they can get the breastplate of righteousness on listen and they can march with a word you can walk with a word on the good days you can walk with the word on the bad days because why you are an obedient Soldier soier who has heard the trumpet sound in the greatest battle that has ever been fought and it has released an anointing upon you but that anointing is a word anointing which says the word must be obeyed I'll say this amen is this okay the principle of obedience it was actually established all the way back in the book of St John Chapter 2 when Jesus was at a wedding amen and they ran out of wine and they needed some wine so all they had was water you know what the Bible says the Bible said that that that they told him to bring the water to Jesus they looked at the water and brother Wesley they said this is just water but his mother was standing there you know what she said unto the servants she said whatever he saith unto you just do it whatever he tells you to do just do it she said look brother said that's still good teaching tonight that's a teaching amen whatever God says to do do it he said that's still good teaching tonight whatever he saith unto you do it if he tells you to make ready for death then you get ready if he tells you you're going to get well then you believe it if he tells you that you're healed you are whatever he says to do do it and if you disbelieve it it's sin now it's real easy to obey the easy things amen but sometimes we got to get down to where the rubber hits the road and Obey things that are contrary to our wants and our flesh and our opinions come on church amen but God has so blessed this generation that he sent us instructions to an age through the angel messenger of that age look in 1 Corinthians 15:1 the Bible said Brethren I declare unto you that the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received look and we're in ye stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain look at verse three for I delivered somebody say delivered for I delivered unto you it feels good in here this morning I deliver unto you first of all not some but all that which also received how that Christ died for your sins are sins according to the scripture look at this word delivered it means to give into the hands of another it means to give over into one's power or use it means to deliver to one something to keep it means to use to take care of Brother David this one blew my mind it means to deliver verbally so when something is delivered it's delivered verbally 1947 the very first tape that we have brother's opening statement is this brother Mark he says we're getting some new gadgets now amen for recording right the very I know that me I'm the guy okay I know that some say well that's silly that's not silly Church a I'll say this to you that's a blessing that God so loved this generation that at the time that the seventh angel would be upon the Earth and he would begin to declare the Revelation that was going to determine the destination of the entire world it would not just be spoken for brother so and so to interpret it would not be spoken for brother so and so amen because he was on a log and huny with brother brandom no it was put verbally on take listen that's why today we don't have to follow whatever man says we got our own books and we got our own tapes and we can go in our own bedrooms and turn on them tapes and we can hear what a prophet delivered verbally well I feel like preaching on that point he said the only thing I can do is deliver the message just like he told me you say well that's crazy is it the problem God said it's up to the spokesman he said now that Jesus died God's covenant and raised again he said then the same spirit that was on him is in the church and it promised by God that it would be to the end of the world oh god brother Wesley the same voice that was speaking and Eden is speaking here this morning God promised it would be here until the end of the world listen it's up to you to receive it well I receive that what a prophet said is the voice of God to this generation you said well that's crazy brother B said it's he said God is Duty bound to send it it's up to you to receive it whether you want it or not see God pokes his religion down nobody's throat God pokes his religion down nobody's throat he said the preacher might do it amen but God does it well we might as well say Amen to that point amen cuz some of you all set through some po con sessions amen just poking poking poking poking well I don't like to be poked amen I like to be preached too is that okay amen preach the word oh God it's like somebody get up and they ain't study they ain't prepared they ain't labored before the presence of God and they think because they got a microphone everybody ought to be shouting and Swinging From sh he man I'll shout if I want to just preach and leave me alone but if you want me to shout amen say something I can shout about if you want me to dance then preach the message I don't respond to anything I am an eagle and the only thing I respond to is the voice of the bridegroom that has been revealed to the seventh angel yall know it's the truth they been poking poking and then come this way amen no just do what a prophet did and preach the message when Paul the first church age messenger came he said I delivered unto you first of all that which also received look at this word received it means not not to withhold obedience it is by the instruction of teachers now I know people say well we're in the bright age and we don't need no teaching well that's a Pentecostal shuck idea come on that's a amen amen somebody say well if you teach the word that ain't inspired according to who come on can I preach according to who all right not according to brother brandom because he said preaching catches The Sinner he said but teaching positionally places the believer and you cannot rightly have faith until positionally you know what you are you know what I say I say sometimes we need some good oldfashioned teaching Services sir we're not a bunch of Pentecostal babies that's got to shout on the music all the time and dance on the air no we want some word we want some substance come on you say well you're getting out there well can I just show you something you can have the Holy Ghost and not know how to pay your ti you can have the Holy Ghost and not know how to dress come on church you can have the Holy Ghost amen and not know how to have church order in a service but thank God there was a voice of the son of man that was revealed in this age that brought some teaching to the house of God brother said Ean half an ear let him hear I'll just go ahead and get that devil out of the room right now I believe in Holy Ghost teaching I don't believe it's uninspired or intellectual or a bunch of refrigerated sermons come on I believe it's the word of God and I think what we ought to do is get back to doing what a prophet somebody say well amen amen I'm getting trouble how do we judge inspiration you know how I judge inspiration by the effect of the word on the people listen there's guys can out preach me I know that outshout me out dance me I know that but at the end of the day can we stay with a prophet when we're in the middle of the B ble can we stand with the prophet when everybody's walking away I say God give us some soldiers who will be obedient to the voice I say God give us some Mamas and some daddies who will be more than just church members but they will be Warriors in the greatest battle that has ever been fought and when the rubber hits the road they'll stand with the prophet of God come on Mama and Daddy when your baby looks at and says that's how a style you can say but I see the blessing that's going to be on you down the road so I'm going to stand with the message of the hour they say well that ain't inspired I I'm Hing I feel good this morning I've come to conclusion there's a lot of guys that would think brother BR wasn't inspired y'all know how he preached the Rapture sermon y'all know how he done it he stood by a table in a banquet and preached the revelation of the Rapture right he wasn't preaching like I am right now he wasn't running all over the building and sweating he was standing there but he was inspired because he was the voice of God said he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit not the man the spirit said to the church it may be that Millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him if you're is open to the word if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you my goodness so it's not the work of a man it's the work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your heart to receive it then you won't get the Revelation now brother goes on to say like this he says the only way to receive the things delivered from God is by the spirit of God now in Romans chapter 8 and verse 6 for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace I just want to make sure we're all on the same page I believe in Inspiration I believe in the anointing I believe it the way a prophet taught it because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not subject to the law of God and neither indeed can be say said someday he's coming and those that are in Christ will God bring with him when he comes see it's all a spiritual revealed truth and it's laying right there look and it takes a spiritual mind to catch it that's right he said a spiritual mind to catch it how many can testify listen what the pr of God says he said rest on that through the rest of the day but it takes a spiritual mind a how many's ever been in service and something was said and when it was you walked out and said I don't have a clue what that meant I don't understand it but you driving down the road or you out in the field or doing something Brother Kyle and all of a sudden that Revelation struck you and you said oh I see it I called it you know what that is that's because you don't have a carnal mind you have a spiritual mind and you've not Shackled that mind down with denominational filters look what the prop of God said he said we are hoping this morning that there is no carnal Minds Among Us that there is a spiritual mind Among Us that we could understand amen what the father is trying to get to us here listen the only thing that can catch the revelation of this word amen is a spiritual mind you say preacher what are you saying I'm saying that it seems the spiritual mind is becoming numb in the age we're living in now yall know what I'm talking about you see so much false and so much false and so much listen amen somebody get up and they they tell something and there's all kinds of loopholes in it and then all of a sudden you watch somebody's spirit amen they hear some false interpretation or some false discernment or some false prophecy amen now watch every time you go to tell something that person puts us uh uh how do I say puts a wall up amen because they've been hurt by one they say I won't be hurt by another let me say this that's the devil trying to numb your spiritual mind because only the spiritual mind can catch the word teachings of this day listen this message is full of more than just prayer lines it's full of more than just discernments it is full of word it is full of teachings you know what I say I say it's time to tear open the books it's time to break open the tapes again and get back in the message of the hour and begin to teach things until there comes a strength upon the body of Jesus Christ you say preacher you lost your mind no I've got a spiritual mind and I'll say this can I give you just a simple illustration amen of of a word teaching how many knows a prophet preach has spoken words Original Seed six- hour servon broke it up in three parts I ain't going that long this morning but he says in there he said there were three seeds swn he said there was a denominational seed which was swn by Billy Graham he said there was a Pentecostal seed which would be swn by o Roberts he said but then there was a word seed which would be the entire Bible and it would be sown by the seventh angel now today by revelation we can say the seventh angel is a man named William brandom but look the only the spiritual mind can understand that look what Paul said he said the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so these word teachings that's laying in this message underneath the voice of the seventh angel it is foolishness to the world to the carnal to the Natural but to the elect of God it's Eagle food come on Church you didn't hear from your theophany on baptism and titles you didn't hear from your theophany Amen on women preachers or tongues is the evidence but when you heard the word for your hour said you heard the eagle scream he said you left the other thing and you come to this he said what is this it's the eagle food you heard from your theophany well if you want to go to church and have a good time and I'll say it like this we got to say something that our theophany agrees with our theophany does not agree with denominational teaching or psychology amen or a better approach to fix Devils our theophany agrees with Mark 16 they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall re come on Church they shall take the word of God listen neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned B said in adoption part one he said how many receive the promise of the Holy Spirit oh aren't you glad you're in the land how many's got the Holy Ghost he said aren't you glad you're in the land you're over here now and you're eating the old corn see eating the strong things of God so you're no longer just eating bottles come on now anden you're no longer just eating Gaga food or I mean what what is the food what is it mashed up pears and apples and ban come on aen Becca you didn't take a a pouch in there to Kyle this morning and say here's your breakfast he's a grown man he's not ready to eat a pouch or eat a bottle he's ready to meal come on church because he's matured to the time he can take it listen friends I think it's time if we're going to claim the message let's come to a place we can take the message come on let's come a place we can feed on every word fully he said you come over here and you're eating the strong things of God and you got a clear understanding I love this part brother brother Morgan your spiritual mind is all UNM muddled up amen hallelujah you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and are persuaded that he is able to keep that which you've committed to him against that day oh that's the one that's the one Paul was talking to your spiritual mind is all un muddled up you know what I'm talking about amen that spiritual mind gets muddled up it gets it gets all muddled down and full of Muddy Waters and well they call it brain fog amen but you know what I say I say there is a bomb in Gilead there is a food in the house of God Brother David these things belong to the church brother said the things that are revealed of God they belong to the Church of God but the things that are secret they belong unto the Lord oh God he said your mind is all UNM I don't know about you but I just praying and I just said yesterday as I was reading that I said Lord amen give every member of the church a spiritual mind from the oldest to the youngest I may say Lord give me a spiritual mind well five of you Lord give me a spiritual mind I don't want the carnal mind I'm tired of the carnal mind come on the carnal mind has you up one day and down the next in one week and out the next amen but a spiritual mind brother Jared brings you to a stability it don't matter what you're going through you have separated from the five outer senses and the five inner senses that are trying to muddle up your spiritual mind and has brought you to a clear understanding Hallelujah that's why on a good day I know I'm a Son of God and on a bad day sister Joyce I still know I'm a Son of God because I've come out of the old land I'm in the new land I've got a clear mind I can eat the strong things of God come on young people that's what will help you with the devil every day is eating the strong things of God now he said you cannot understand it until it's revealed to you he said the whole thing is built upon spiritual Revelation you've got to hear and then recognize and then act here on here recognize and act it's revealed to some and not to others one man can read Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever look at this same scripture read by two different men one man can read it and the carnal mind will say well in a way he is but the spiritual mind will say in every way he is I hope this okay that's amen and Jesus gave a commission and says go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them that believe the carnal mind will say well that was for the apostles but the spiritual mind will say he's the same yesterday today and forever I love this brother Joe into all the world and I a part of it Hallelujah the caral oh God the carnal mind will never include you in the revelation of the word of God but the spiritual mind will not just oh God Hallelujah the carnal mind just sees Malachi 4 and all they see is God and Elijah but the spiritual mind Sees God sending Elijah to Andrew Glover the spiritual mind Sees God sending Elijah to Chloe Reynolds you know why because the spiritual mind has been unbundled by the Holy Ghost and we've got the ability to feed on the strong things of God hallelujah I tell that devil get out of my way come on you know what I say I say start eating until you get some strength you can stand up and face that devil and say a few years ago devil you could wreck my mind you could wreck my spirit you could wreck my faith but today I know who I am I'm over in the land of inheritance I'm feeding on the word of God Hallelujah like Billy Paul said that man come in there said two men read the same book said one man got done reading it closed the book said I'll never read nothing else he looked up at him he said why he said that man called me a chicken the other man said funny thing is that man called me an eagle they read the same book come on Church they read the same words by the same Prophet by the same lingo by the same language by the same Kentucky accent but at the end of the book there was a whole different change you know why because one had a carnal mind and one had a spiritual mind I say oh Satan I defeat you this morning th filthy devil of a carnal mind that would try to block the blessings of God off of the Church of God I rebuke you in the name of Jesus I say Lord bring us a spiritual mind you know when you stop praising is when you take your spiritual mind and you get a carnal mind about situation you know when you stop believing God is the minute you trade the spiritual mind for a carnal mind and start trying to work things have you know what I say this morning I say throw away the carnal mind and get you a holy ghost filled spiritual mind that can believe God for everything that he said brother Wesley how I don't know but my mind is UN muddled and God is able He's Able what are you saying I'm saying we're living in the age or the Bible that has been wrote in symbols I'm running out of time has been wrote in symbols the spiritual mind is catching yeah it's catching the reality or the revelation of those symbols Daniel 2 verse 33 his legs was of iron his feet was a part of iron and a part of clay thou sawest till a stone brother Matt there was a stone that was cut out without hands which smoke the image amen let's just let's just take a minute and read that okay Daniel 2:31 thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent it stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was of fine gold Daniel 2:32 of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay listen now th Solace till that a stone was cut out without hands with smoy image upon his feet that were of iron and Clay look and break them to Pieces somebody say that with me and break them to Pieces but there was a stone said now look did you notice right there when we brought out where that last great conference were Cru with five nations of the East and Eisenhower the leader the five nations of the West represented and the 10 toes of the image that would not mix and kusf took his shoe off and beat it he said the spiritual mind would pick that up right quick see he beat it on the desk see they will not mix now look I love this quote now the next thing is the coming of the stone so brother K the devil don't mind if you understand the tin toes amen but just don't catch the revelation of that stone he said there was a stone that was shoot out of the mountain without hands look and it rolled into the Gentile Kingdom till it will be finished and just before that time oh God and just before that time he's going to send this Angel to what church to Sodom no to the lukor no he sent it to the elected the called out Church what kind of sign did he show the same thing he did here last night amen God Elohim manifested in the person of the Holy Ghost in his church Hallelujah I feel like shouting on the next thing amen was the stone that come rolling out the mountain he said that ought to send us a million miles in the sky with shouts and Praises of his glory you say preacher why does that excite you because that stone is our lord Jesus christall God have mercy he said look the word of God always attracts that spiritual mind I'm going somewhere because it's the mind of Christ in you that knows that word is true when you get the spiritual mind of Christ in you it knows that word amen regardless of what anybody says that word right that word is true so the carnal mind it can catch the scientific advancements of the day but the spiritual mind catches the spiritual advancements of the day look here in Third Exodus I hope this okay he said I hope the spiritual mind can catch it he said I'm sure you do but I wonder out there anyhow you can't visit every nation but you can send tapes to it God will have some way to catch that mind out there where that seed is solded right oh Church the mind of Christ is solded in the Church of the Living God he said and as soon as that light strikes it brother claps his hands together once it's gone it takes life now let me say this if there is a seat in your soul God will find that seed it don't matter how he does it just be thankful that he did it y'all ever heard of a brother mckimm from West Virginia irvil mckimm he's an ity brother there brother irvil told me one time he said but Andrew he said I was working in the post office he said I was going by the trash can one day and he said I seen this man toss something in the trash can and he kept on walking he said now the odest thing is something would speak to my heart and say go check that trash can now some of y'all was looking at me kind of like what in the world are you talking about well that's kind of how I was thinking a trash can he said I walked over there and he said I reached in there and it was a seven Church age book he said I picked that book up he said open it he said it began to answer every question I had I love what brother said he but Andrew what was one man's trash was another Man's Treasure are you hearing me what was one man's trash was another man's treasure listen if there's a seed in there it's got to come forth if there's a seed with a spiritual mind listen God is going to have some oh God hallelujah God is going to have somebody on the earth in the age that we're living in to catch what he's doing in this dispensation come on Church y'all know what I'm talking about amen God set the devil up come on God hello God set the devil up he pre-arranged this from before the foundation of the world he already had somebody on the earth that had the secret seed in their soul that when the word would begin to be revealed they would catch [Music] it he said like the woman at the well there it is you say the woman at the well he said yeah she was looking for the manifestation of the promised word that had been circling for 400 years now watch quickly what did he do he said look see there was a Cay in there that come to life he said why she was looking for the manifestation of the word 400 years since Malachi they had no prophets and here was a man that manifested to be a prophet quickly she know that was something yeah she said sir I perceive oh God yeah I perceive you are a prophet she said we know that when the Messiah cometh he's going to be that's going to be what he does can I just go ahead and say it and he looked at her and said I am he that speaks God I am he that speaks to you come on speaks I am he that speaks to you obey the voice of the son I am he listen he begin to speak to her he begin to declare something to her oh God he begin to declare what was in God's mind about her to her I am he that speaks to you now now he can reveal himself now look she has already received him he is now on the inside see he can make himself known listen she had five husbands and the one she was with right then wasn't her husband what when he begin to speak when he begin to articulate sounds when he begin to tell her things that nobody else knew but her she be to receive the voice that she was hearing you know what he said he said give me a drink brother Bobby that voice said give me a drink she didn't look at it and say let me think about it no she dropped her water bucket right she gave him a drink and she ran into the city what are you saying I'm saying the protag God said if God sends you the messenger and vindicates it by the signs he was a messenger sent from God then it's up to the to obey this messenger they must obey the messenger and have respects unto that messenger now let me just say this the evidence of obedience was not quoting what Moses said about the token the evidence of obedience was applying the blood as Moses said he said now look obedience if the token was not displayed then the Covenant was not effective see it must be because if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe he said see though you be circumcised though you join though you are baptized you done all these things like that that still ain't the token the Holy Ghost remember says like this he says obey don't just come this far I'm I'm tying this together don't just come this far and say I believe the message no you obey the messenger he said you come into Christ you saywell I believe every word said brother brandom that's good but that's just being able to read see take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you and when I see that I will pass over you y'all imagine if you go read Exodus 12 it's a it's a very powerful reading I'm not going to read it for the sake of time but read it and all the instructions yes sir he didn't just say Wesley didn't just say go get your lamb and slap some blood above the door no there's all kinds eat it this way roast you with herbs do this do that do all these things right and if the father would have cut corners on one thing if he would have changed one thing the death things would have come right through that house and took the first born yes sir are you with me look at Noah he receives the instructions to build the ark you know what he does he has to build it to the dimensions come on church if Noah would have been out there this has always been a quote that amazes me brother Wesley is Noah being a carpenter brother said Noah was a carpenter he said he took the dimensions and he went to work now let me just ask y'all something what Carpenter do you know that takes a set of plans and don't try to change him come on I grew up with a carpenter I never saw my grandfather get a set of plans and say well you know what that's exactly what we'll do he always looked at it and said we could do this we could change it's human nature but Noah was bringing deliverance and if he would have changed one thing on that Ark brother it would have went to the bottom of the waters but because Noah was in the hands of God and he was a mouthpiece for God he was an agent of Deliverance on the earth he had to stay underneath the instructions of The Voice was here let me say this to you Moses went out there Noah went out there and they obeyed God and because of their obedience it brought a blessing yes it brought a blessing upon the homes it brought a blessing upon Noah's family but can I say this to you this morning church how many says Lord if you did it for Abraham if you did it for Moses if you did it for Noah then I believe you can do it for me you can do it for my family you can do it for my babies you can do it for my church and the only thing will bring it is obedience you say what are you saying I'm saying the message is Christ it's the anointed word you say well brother Andrew I think the message is a better thought let me say this as plain as I know how the message is not a better thought the message is the only thought obedience to the voice I'm GNA close on this obedience to the voice causes you to surrender surrender your own thoughts I knew it' get quiet on that point obedience to the voice actually causes you to surrender your own thoughts look at Second Corinthians 10:5 casting down the imaginations and every High thing you know imagination are real you know that and imaginations will have you imagine and people don't like you come on God they'll have you imagin and people don't like you and them imaginations will make you treat people that really love you like dirt all right well it's Sunday morning we might as well preach brother Bon you get to imagining well somebody didn't like me and somebody don't come on Church you know it's the truth imaginations are real but they're devils and they need to come subject to the word of God come on Church well brother so and so I tell you what I I'm going to pick up Morgan he's got big shoulders he can take it I tell you what I go that church but brother Morgan don't like me and he's the Deacon I walked by him three times and he didn't even shake my hand amen I'll tell you what I think he's been talking to somebody about me I don't think he likes me I'm not going to go back because the Deacon don't like me and the whole time Morgan have this on his mind and that on his mind amen come on Church you know what well I tell you right now brother M he just don't like me cuz and sister so and so she don't like me it's a devil it's a devil of imagination and I tell you what that imaginations do they will muddle up your spiritual mind and you'll sit in the house of God and you'll sit there and try to fix so and so and this one don't like me and she don't like me and I'm not a part of this and I was left out of that you know what I say I say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ we rebuke that ungodly carnal imagine in mind and we say give us a spiritual mind well the way he looked and the way she looked it's like years ago hom longor told me he said somebody got after me amen they said he must not like us every time he comes to preach amen because he looks at the wall now y'all know Homer I better leave that out he said Andrew they actually thought I was crazy cuz I just looked at the wall he said I didn't even think nothing about it he said I said nervous he said I couldn't hardly look at nobody he said so I just looked at the wall now you're laughing at [Music] that well I might as well just bog down and preach here cuz every time brother Matt deals with something it's CA somebody told somebody told somebody woo glory to God can I stay are you hearing me and in reality it's not somebody told somebody it's he that speaks it's he that speaks because he went into his office and he waited and he leave angered and he sat there and he spent time away from his wife and babies to find the mind of God and he that speaks come in the room and said tie back to that and say that and speak that and he come appropriate and he punched that devil square in the face but because that devil just happened to be on you oh come on Church it begin to interpret the word of God and begin to say well Matt talk to brother so and so because so and so talk to sister so and so hey you know what I say I say kick that thing out of the house of God and bring back the spiritual mind to believe God still has the ability to walk through the doors of Grace Tabernacle and speak the situations have we got so C in our thinking that we think a man sitting together trying to arrange a sermon I say it's he that speaks is speaking here today and if you will hear his voice there will be a blessing upon your life you will rebuke that old critical devil rebuke that gossiping devil rebuke that imagination devil rebuke it this morning rebuke it you've controlled me as long as you're going to control me yes sir you've controlled my fellowship as long as you're going to control it thank you Lord well if I would just raise my hands and I would just praise God if I would just worship God somebody's going to thank because they know and they saw and they heard as Dave Siler says I'm done preaching I'm just having fun now and they thought and they heard and they said I can't praise God I can't raise my hand I just got to sit here because they know everything about me and they were looking at me and was it ever dawned on you that there's someone that knows everything about every one of us right there's actually someone who knows everything about everybody in this room he don't have a finite mind oh god brother Travis he has an infinite mind and you'll let some finite mind or some critical person stop you from praising God because they know some mistake in your past well let me just say this God knows everything about every one of us and he still blesses us well glory to God he knows our shortcoming he knows our downfalls he knows our mistakes and he still blesses us and he still provides for us you know what I say I say I refuse to let imaginations control the thinking of this son of God any longer I know I was a wreck I know I made mistakes but hey guess what I met Jesus I met the king of kings and he changed my life and he saved my soul yeah you remember when but God don't because it's in the blood Blood cast down those imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God let our musicians come and bring it into captivity bring it into captivity amen every thought to The Obedience right of Christ I could preach here for another hour yes sir every fault every fault right not some of them a few of them see when you let a carnal mind control You by imaginations he'll control you by your thoughts and your thoughts will go in places they should never be sorry Morgan I'm back he didn't shake my hand and he didn't speak to me he didn't hold the door for me he held it for so and so and he walked by me and didn't look and I think we ought to pray for our deacons amen I think we ought to pray for brother Morgan brother I think brother Phil I think we ought to pray for our deacons yes sir stood in the prayer line the other day and man come up to me he said brother Andrew he said he said I'm a deacon in my church and he said to be honest with you I'm about done I said brother really he said yeah he said I'm about done I said where do you go to church and he told me and I know what the Pastor is going through and I know what his wife is going through and the sicknesses in their body he said brother Ander he said I'm just so so tired he said I'm just I'm just wore out he said this problem and that problem and that situation and just as clear as I'm talking to you the spirit of the Lord just spoke through me and said it's C you know everything and you still have to go to church and act like everything's okay and sister Nish I watched the power of God come right on that man he didn't fall out the floor but I seen it with these eyes I seen the power of God begin to refresh him now I'm just going to I'm just going to preach here for a [Music] second sometimes you can know a lot about situations and it'll wear you out but you got to stay in your position and I say God bless these deacons I say God bless these men I say that from my heart to stand their faith like they do but that carnal mind will say well this and that but no the spiritual mind that's un muddled will say you know what them are men of God and they got a lot on them they got a lot of pressures they got a lot of burdens you know what they just didn't see me God bless them let's go have church spiritual mind can fix a lot in the church spiritual mind can carnal mind says well she shouldn't be doing that because of this and he shouldn't be doing that because of that they shouldn't be doing that because of that they but the spiritual mind will say God I know I've made a mess and if you could use me in my mess you can bless somebody else in their situation I'm going to pray the Bess but I'm feeling good right now I'm going to pray the when do we stop praying the blessings of God on people I pray God bless you John sister Lee I pray God bless you I pray he give you everything you want Brother David I pray he bless you you see a spiritual brother Charles I pray bless you bless your family bless everything about you spiritual mind unmuted eating the strong things of God forgetting the past and bringing those thoughts into captivity listen I'm out of time this morning I want you to stand your feet with us he that speaks I believe God still speaks and I believe he can still fix situations and I believe a spiritual mind will catch will catch it I believe it how many believes it with me spiritual mind will fix a lot you know I've heard people say it and I probably said it myself so Heavenly minded no earthly good you ever heard that that statement but you know brother Joel in the hour and day we're living in I think that's a bless blessing just to get so Heavenly minded woo brother that you just forget all the problems and all the situations and obey the voice see I'll tell you why the devil don't want your mind clear because he knows when this word comes forth it's not your pastor it's not the Evangelist it's not the visiting Minister it's the word and he speaks and the devil knows if he can get your mind so muddled up that when that word goes to speak and that word's bouncing against a carnal mind but if the Holy Ghost can just come in and just move that carnal mind out when that word starts coming forth there's a reception there oh I don't know about you today I say Lord Give Me That kind of mind give me that kind of mind Lord bring every thought thought how many can say Lord every thought brother should look up on the fields now and see what hour we're living in come to life let the life that was in Christ come in you the mind you say oh I think I think this you ain't got no fault coming you let the faults that was in Christ be in you and that's the word see another place free thinking I do my own thinking you ain't got no thought coming what will you do with this Jesus called Christ you ain't no free thinker there is no free thinking let the mind that was in Christ be in you how many say Lord make me like blind Bemus who got a new thought brother said he sit there by the highways side begging he said but then all of a sudden brother Noah he begin to think a new thought he begin to think this is my hour of Deliverance this is my time and the delivering Angel come right by his way the Lord Jesus touched him brother Amos had left him like that he was made whole instantly made whole church I believe God still speaks I believe God speaks right here in this assembly how many can raise your hand and say I'm a witness God speaks to me brother Roy we're Witnesses God can still speak and fix situations let's bow our hearts together this evening this morning he still speaks I wonder this this morning how many finds yourself like Peter you're out there on that water you've told all night you're weary you're tired been fishing all night and ain't caught nothing and then this Stranger Comes Walking By and he looks at you and he speaks to you because God speaks and he looks at you and he says now let down thy net again you see the First Time Peter kind of looked at him he said we've toed all night Lord and caught nothing we've been out here fishing see Peter was a fisherman he knew how to catch fish but that night he was at the end of human ability he was at the end of his human understanding on how to catch fish and a supernatural voice walked by and looked over at him and said let down thy net again and Peter Give the Lord all of his reasons but I love these next words he said but Lord at Thy word I'll let down my net again in other words Lord that's your voice that's speaking to me I'll give it one more chance Lord I'll obey your voice I've heard it I believe it I receive it now I'm going to obey it and he let down his net and the fish like to broke his net because this time it was under the voice of creation I wondered this morning with every head bowed every eye closed you say brander I'm like that I'm at the end I'm weary I'm tired this carnal mind these thoughts are driving me insane beaten against my spirit beaten against my praise will you receive the word of the Lord this morning God bless you there sis God bless you brother God bless you God bless you over there sis God bless you buddy he sees your hand God bless you young man he sees your hand God bless you there brother Ander this morning I want to obey his voice I want to let down my net one more time I'm going to try once

taxing their mind Lord situations father I know how Lord the situations happen and and Lord as soon as something happens imagination tries to take over and Lord we begin to imagine what's going to happen in the future we begin to imagine the outcome we begin to imagine what's going to take place imaginations begin to run wild Lord oh we already have this happen we already have that happen Lord as I was just talking to someone the other day and they were talking about what what an age of Technology we live in of how that we get a simple pain in our body and we get our cell phones out we look it up and they said the the just a just kind of lighthearted told me they said I look this up and well in just a few minutes I was pled my funeral and I thought oh God is't that so true Lord imaginations father imaginations running wild Lord but today dear God by the power of the Holy Ghost I bring this congregation in your presence Lord and as Paul said we cast down imagination and every thought and every High thing that tries to exalt itself against the knowledge of God and we bring every thought into captivity and The Obedience of Jesus Christ father I pray this morning Lord as your Prophet did he would stand there in paralyze and look at people he would say oh I see you're the nervous type oh there it is you're real you're real weary and you're spiritual heavy oh this has happened oh yeah that's it it's because you're oh that's it you you cross Bridges before you get to them oh God I pray this morning Lord that the same angel that stood there with the prophet of God as he stood there and lingered and lingered and lingered and waited and waited father waiting on your angel to come until he could get himself completely out of the way and then your angel begin to take over and speak through him dear God I pray this morning by the power of the Holy Ghost May the angel of God come right here in Grace Tabernacle today and Lord for every nervous spirit I pray the peace of God hallelujah that pastors all understanding would bring such a peace upon that heart father I pray for every nervousness Lord I rebuke in the name of Jesus Lord forever I just can't get away from it this morning Lord every demon that's trying to control and lead people by imaginations I rebuke it in the name of Jesus I pray the power of the Holy Ghost would bring that imagination separate separated from the heart of your child this morning Lord father may we take a hold of faith of super sense and step out this morning Lord and say I don't know how but it's going to work out I refuse to live my life under underneath this pressure of imaginations Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord we love you this morning Minister to your children this morning I pray in Jesus name in Jesus name give myself

me you know this morning I was just thinking as they play that softly I was just thinking how many's got situations in here you're facing Spirit Lord just Dro this on my heart situations you're facing and really you don't know how it's going to work out you remember the prophet of God was over there in Finland and he was walking down the road and he come up there and there was that boy laying in the street laying there Dead Brother B said he looked around he said there was the trees he said there was the mountain he said there was the vision he said I got to thinking there for a second sister Eve said I got to thinking Lord what's going to happen here he said but then I begin to remember the vision he said two years ago over in the Homeland Lord you told me this was going to take place now I'm saying this for a reason he said then all of a sudden that I begin to remember the vision and he said the peace of God just begin to settle on me and brother Mark I love these words he said the situation under [Music] control wooo amen I don't know about you this morning but I'd take that and i' I'd wave that the devil's face I'd say devil did you hear that the situations under control under whose control not mine the Lord's he said I laid my hand on him I said If this boy ain't up off the ground in five minutes I'm a false prophet he said five minutes a boy was up on his feet praising God totally made well thank you Lord you know what brought that piece sister shakina he remembered the vision he remembered what was told him in the Homeland in the Homeland there was going to be a situation but there was going to be under control Well church and living God can I tell you what your Homeland is it's the message of the hour remember the vision that God give you in the Homeland and whenever you come up against that situation look at Square in the face and say it's under control devil you ain't going to make me a free thinker you ain't going to control me by my imagination I ain't going to cross Bridges before I get to him the Holy Ghost is in control of my life he's in control of my future he holds my tomorrow he holds my next week he holds my next Hallelujah he holds

Situation's under control it is this morning it's under control Church my life is not my own to you I Bel Lord I give myself I give myself to you I Give Myself Away thank you Lord oh I give myself away so you can use me I give myself [Applause] away I give myself away so you can use me my life is not my own my life is not my own to you I belong I myself give myself to you I say my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you I say my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you I give myself away [Music] I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me amen is that not the truth this morning amen how many say that I I'm glad to have a voice that I can hear the Bible said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says I'm just glad to have an ear to be able to hear that voice brother jar we I'm thankful I'm thankful for a voice that speaks amen the a voice that can give Direction that's what we that's what we always look for and all the technolog is trying to give you a voice to help you through every aspect of your life but I thank God that we have a voice that that that can answer every question he always he always knows the answer he knows which way we should turn in the direction that we ought to go and knows what we need to hear and I believe we've heard that voice this morning amen you believe that this morning you know the other the other day I was asked uh Sarah she was in the kitchen I as a husband you know how you lose things and and things they move inanimate objects move in my house and I hollered over at Sarah in a nice way I said Sarah where's my shoes and my phone spoke up and it said I cannot help you with that and Sarah sounds like Siri or something you know and I thought you know that Siri don't have the answer to everything no matter what you ask I can't help with this I can't help with that I'm limited in my ability to help but but my wife knew right where it was I thought you know that's the way it is with the Lord he knows where he knows where every Everything is everything in your life that's missing he knows where the missing pieces are he knows where you got to go to find it he knows how to put it together and I believe that if we'll hear the voice of God a brother told me the other day in service and or after the service he said you know some people was kind of picking on him about a prophet and I said you know I found an answer to that I said when somebody says anything about a prophet if I first off I say are you a Christian and and you know you you know if you'll get an answer if they don't reply yes to that well then they're it's a silly conversation from that point with you need to find Christ first then we'll worry about the rest of it but but yeah I'm a Christian would you believe in Prophecy well you can't be a Christian and not believe in Prophecy see because it's all through the scripture well you know if and if well I I don't know if I believe in that said well you know it's odd that the same Bible scripture that said that God sent a prophet is the same one that he said sent an evangelist and sent a pastor and sent a teacher and sent an apostle for the perfecting of the Saints so if he so if he's God at all and you can believe that God could send a pastor to help you through your current situation how many still believe that that God can give you a pastor that would help you how many believes he could give you an evangelist that could that could pick you up whenever you're down and bring a word from the Lord to lift you how many believes he sends Apostles and Setter in orders into into lands and to do missionary work see so if God can do all those things well then it's the same verse of scripture so see it's a but all all of it is is that we separated because of our carnal thinking but a spiritual mind said says it's all the same voice speaking Paul said it was a gift there's a diversity of gifts God gave some each of these he said but see it's the same voice of God all along isn't that wonderful it's hard for us to think that way because we look at each other in our flesh and to think that the same voice that spoke through a prophet can speak through my brother but you realize that that Prophet had brothers and sisters and and family members that probably said the same thing how could God speak through him just like we do one another but I believe that God speaks through us I believe he speaks to us he spoke through my brother this morning and he spoke to my heart and I believe that I thank God that I have a hear or an ear to hear the voice of God are you so thankful for it this morning amen want somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning isn't it wonderful to be able to recognize Truth key of D will I've been changed I've been he I've been free I've been delivered I I found joy I found so much gra amazing
