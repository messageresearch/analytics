[40:52] honor to be here with you this evening I
[40:56] want to go go to the Book of Matthew
[40:57] chapter 14 we're going to look at verse
[40:59] 22 and then we're going to I want to
[41:02] read to you a statement out of question
[41:04] and answers in
[41:07] 1964 Matthew Chapter 14 verse
[41:11] 22 i' like to speak to you this
[41:14] evening something very simple something
[41:16] just to encourage your faith for a few
[41:18] minutes tonight on stepping out of the
[41:21] boat Matthew chapter
[41:23] 14 and straightway Jesus strange as
[41:26] disciples to go into a ship and to go
[41:30] before him and to the other side while
[41:32] he sent the multitudes away and when he
[41:35] had sent the multitudes away he went up
[41:38] into a mountain apart to pray and when
[41:41] the evening was come he was there alone
[41:45] but the ship now was in the midst of the
[41:47] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[41:53] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of of
[41:56] the night now remember because they've
[41:58] come under Roman dictatorship they
[42:00] actually divided the watches of the
[42:02] night into fourth and the fourth one is
[42:05] the last watch of the night which runs
[42:07] from around 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. so
[42:10] it's the darkest moment of the night and
[42:14] the Bible says in the Fourth Watch of
[42:16] the night Jesus went unto them walking
[42:19] on the sea and when the disciples saw
[42:22] him walking on the sea they were
[42:23] troubled saying it's a spirit
[42:26] and they cried out for fear but straight
[42:30] way Jesus spake unto them saying be of
[42:35] good cheer it is I Be not
[42:39] Afraid and pet Peter answered him and
[42:42] said
[42:43] Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[42:49] on the water and Jesus said not 500
[42:53] scriptures not 500 quotes
[42:56] but he gives him one word sometimes all
[42:59] we need to be able to overcome is just
[43:02] one word and he said come and when Peter
[43:06] was come down out of the ship he walked
[43:09] on the water to go to Jesus let's just
[43:13] buy our hearts tonight if we could just
[43:14] to ask the Lord to bless the reading of
[43:16] the word bless our service this evening
[43:19] Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord
[43:21] to be able to come and be gathered
[43:23] together in your name tonight and Lord
[43:25] we just look to you now and ask that you
[43:28] would just come and Minister To Us by
[43:30] Your Word you see the things tonight
[43:32] Lord that is Upon My Heart Lord the
[43:34] Simplicity of it I pray Lord that it
[43:36] would build faith in the heart of your
[43:38] people we know Lord that when you come
[43:41] by great things can happen so help us
[43:43] tonight Lord to take our humanity and
[43:46] our mortality may we surrender it to you
[43:49] Lord that you could have your way and
[43:51] that your will would be done I ask now
[43:53] Lord that you would take control of this
[43:55] service May the Holy Spirit Come may you
[43:58] just bring Liberty among us tonight
[44:00] bless our gathering together we'll give
[44:02] you the Praise In The Name Of The Lord
[44:04] Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God
[44:07] bless you tonight you can be
[44:09] seated I'm going to read to you a
[44:11] statement out of questions and answers
[44:13] 1964 where the Prophet is actually
[44:16] dealing with this this thought tonight
[44:19] of looking at Peter stepping out of the
[44:21] boat and he's talking about the human
[44:24] part of our um genetic makeup of who we
[44:27] are and he said there's actually six
[44:30] senses in the human body because he is
[44:33] the number of six in the Bible he was
[44:36] created on the sixth day he is the
[44:38] number six he's got SE taste SM feel
[44:43] smell hear and then Faith now listen to
[44:47] the way he says this his faith sets his
[44:50] destination his faith sets his
[44:54] destination where he's headed for for
[44:56] and now Faith is the substance faith is
[45:00] the substance of things hope for the
[45:03] evidence of things you do not see taste
[45:06] feel smell or hear but by faith when he
[45:10] catches the word I love this quote by
[45:14] faith when he catches the word it sends
[45:17] him into a dimension that makes it so
[45:20] real to him till it's just as good as
[45:24] he's got it in his hand he knows it's
[45:27] going to happen we know because of the
[45:30] day that we're living in and the time
[45:32] period that we're living in now that our
[45:34] faith is going to be tested more than it
[45:36] ever has in the history of the world no
[45:39] other people that has ever served God
[45:42] people that has had to live for God has
[45:44] had to deal with so much demonic
[45:46] influence as what we deal with in this
[45:49] day and we realize because of the faith
[45:52] that we Proclaim we realize that our
[45:54] belief today is is truly going to be
[45:56] tested and Satan is going to send every
[46:00] demon that he can and we know that he's
[46:03] going to send every imp every disease
[46:06] every sickness everything that he hell
[46:08] has to offer he's going to send it
[46:11] against us because of the day that we
[46:12] live in now and we see the effects of
[46:15] that today because of the turmoil the
[46:18] turmoil that's taking place not only in
[46:20] our nation but even around the world
[46:22] that there's wars and rumors of wars
[46:25] there's all time of things that's going
[46:27] on people's minds are scattered all
[46:29] types of sicknesses disease that's
[46:31] plaguing not only our nation that's plag
[46:34] in our world and not only do we see it
[46:36] upon the global scene we see it upon the
[46:39] national scene today as the bomb has
[46:41] went off upon the Border people's
[46:43] nervous about it being a holiday weekend
[46:46] what what type of terrorism what is that
[46:48] what is Terrorism it's Satan sending the
[46:51] spirit of fear to try to get people
[46:54] captivated of what's going to happen in
[46:56] the day that we're living in but I'll
[46:58] remind you that Jesus has not given us
[47:01] the spirit of fear but he's given us the
[47:04] spirit of peace and joy and of a sound
[47:07] mind so Satan is going to do everything
[47:10] he can to keep our minds running all
[47:12] kinds of directions and I thought of
[47:15] this dealing living in a day where we
[47:17] deal with so much trouble we deal with
[47:19] so much stress that's going on all types
[47:22] of sicknesses people sick all the time
[47:24] and I thought about this tonight and I
[47:26] know this is going to hit you strange
[47:28] it's going to kind of hit your mind odd
[47:30] but just give me a few minutes before
[47:32] you judge it but whenever I think about
[47:35] sicknesses troubles diseases things that
[47:38] plagues Humanity many of the very things
[47:40] that's going on in the world when I was
[47:42] young I never would have dreamed that
[47:44] many of the things that the people of
[47:46] the world deal with that we as
[47:48] Christians deal with the same thing we
[47:49] got trouble in our homes trouble in our
[47:51] families trouble in our churches many of
[47:54] the same things that plagues human
[47:56] plagues us as Christians because of the
[47:58] type of life that we live in our mortal
[48:00] realm but you realize because we live in
[48:03] this type of a world we will be affected
[48:06] by but I thought about this today as I
[48:09] was studying this and I thought I'll
[48:10] just present it to you in this way I
[48:14] personally and I know this is going to
[48:15] sound so strange but I personally would
[48:18] love to have the ability to be able to
[48:21] walk on
[48:24] water I told you was going to hit you
[48:26] strange I would love to have the ability
[48:29] to be able to walk on water now when I
[48:32] say that you think that may sound crazy
[48:35] but I just want to preface it with this
[48:38] tonight I'm not talking about a river
[48:40] I'm not talking about a lake I'm not
[48:43] talking about a pond I'm talking about
[48:45] life itself and many different places
[48:48] the prophet would take and he would show
[48:50] us that life is like a sea and he tells
[48:54] us that a sea is unstable that a sea is
[48:58] uncertain and that's the way that life
[49:00] is and the way that the sea is many
[49:03] times that's the way our life is
[49:05] sometimes there's waves sometimes
[49:07] there's calm Waters sometimes there
[49:10] tumultous sometimes it's trouble Waters
[49:13] but remember it is uncertain the way
[49:15] that life is and it's always moving
[49:18] water is always moving and it's being
[49:21] tossed to and fro and brother Ram says a
[49:23] lot of times upon the sea that a storm
[49:26] will come up upon the waters and a storm
[49:28] will cause the waters to go into a
[49:31] frenzy and the wind will come down and
[49:33] whip up on top of the sea and it'll
[49:35] cause that sea to become unstable and
[49:38] that's the age that we're living in now
[49:41] it is a day of uncertainty it's an age
[49:44] of uncertainty and because we're living
[49:46] in this kind of a day I want to have the
[49:49] ability whenever life is a wave and it's
[49:52] all types of tumultous problems and
[49:54] sickness and troubles and diseases I
[49:57] want to personally have the ability to
[49:59] be able to walk on that water we know
[50:01] that David tells us in the Book of
[50:03] Psalms chapter 27 he says that we are
[50:06] going to come into a day where it's
[50:08] going to be a time of trouble and
[50:11] brothers sisters those things is not
[50:13] things that are to be we are living in
[50:15] that day it is a day of trouble and
[50:18] there has never been troubles like there
[50:21] is today there has never been more
[50:23] problems than what you and I are dealing
[50:25] with now and I want to tell you tonight
[50:27] and I trust that this can move on even
[50:29] on end to the New Year we're coming to
[50:31] the end now as the holiday season is
[50:34] here but I want to tell you we cannot
[50:36] expect for 2024 if the Lord will carar
[50:40] or 2025 if the Lord would carry we
[50:43] cannot expect the Seas to be calm you
[50:46] cannot expect to have calm Waters you
[50:49] cannot expect those days of calm Waters
[50:52] of being able just to float along sit
[50:55] around around the church for a few weeks
[50:57] few months few years and somehow make it
[50:59] I want to tell you if you stay in the
[51:01] house of God you're going to be tried
[51:04] every service that you C because if
[51:06] Satan can't keep you from coming here
[51:08] he'll do everything he can to keep your
[51:10] mind tore up keep your spirit tore up
[51:13] keep the church tore up he'll try to all
[51:16] take everything in the service the
[51:17] instruments the song reading whatever it
[51:19] might be to try to keep our mind on
[51:22] everything but the word of God the seeds
[51:24] will no longer be calm the days of calm
[51:28] Waters it is over as a matter of fact
[51:30] it's going to get worse and worse and
[51:33] worse it's because we're living in a day
[51:36] of contrary our government is contrary
[51:39] the people of the world is contrary the
[51:41] waters are rough the waves are high say
[51:44] Amen somebody people themselves are
[51:47] unstable psychiatrist are trying to find
[51:51] psychiatrist doctors are trying to look
[51:53] for doctors because they don't know who
[51:55] they are and they're trying to face
[51:57] things that they're not qualified to be
[51:59] able to face because it's not natural
[52:02] sicknesses that people are dealing with
[52:05] but it's demon out of hell that is
[52:07] coming against them that is plaguing
[52:09] their minds and plaguing their spirit
[52:11] and doctors and psychiatrists themselves
[52:13] are dealing with many of other things
[52:15] and they don't know where to turn oh but
[52:18] thank God we may be pled with that but
[52:20] we got a place to turn tonight we've got
[52:23] somebody that can Hallelujah somebody
[52:26] that can help us in the middle of
[52:27] trouble and the middle of a storm we got
[52:30] somewhere that we can
[52:32] go the doctors don't have the answer
[52:35] your government don't have the answer
[52:37] Donald Trump don't have the answer Joe
[52:40] Biden certainly ain't got the answer he
[52:42] don't even know who he is but you and I
[52:45] know who the answer is and the answer is
[52:48] Christ with nobody else can help you and
[52:51] nobody else can take you and Lead You
[52:53] Out Jesus said I'll be with is you even
[52:56] in you amen until the end of the
[53:00] world I want to have the ability to walk
[53:04] on water I'm talking about trouble I'm
[53:07] talking about stress I want to have the
[53:10] ability to walk over sicknesses walk
[53:13] over cancer walk over diabetes walk over
[53:16] back trouble head trouble family trouble
[53:19] Church trouble I want to have the
[53:21] ability to walk on the water we may not
[53:24] be able to stop stop the waves we may
[53:26] not be able to stop the storms but if I
[53:29] could walk on the water I'm not going to
[53:31] ask God to calm the waters Jo Lord just
[53:34] give me the ability to walk on
[53:37] it I don't want to be tossed like the
[53:40] rest of the world I don't want to walk
[53:42] and be sunk like the rest of the world I
[53:45] want to walk over what other people are
[53:48] sinking in amen I want to walk amen what
[53:53] other people fall here I want have the
[53:55] ability to be able to walk on
[53:58] it well why sink to the bottom when you
[54:02] got power to walk on it why sink when
[54:05] you know the one that created the water
[54:07] why sink when you know the one that God
[54:10] gave the authority to give you the power
[54:12] to be able to walk over why put up with
[54:15] it when you can walk over
[54:18] it and our setting tonight is that kind
[54:21] of a
[54:22] situation once again it's a tremendous
[54:25] storm on the Sea of Galilee and the Sea
[54:29] of Galilee has some of the greatest
[54:31] storms in the Middle East and the
[54:34] disciples happen to be in the boat and
[54:37] they're Crossing this sea and now they
[54:39] have left and they've been in the water
[54:42] oh my what would just be just a little
[54:44] trip to be able to get across but
[54:47] because of the water moving because of
[54:50] the Waves being so high that the
[54:52] disciples what would only take a few
[54:54] minutes it's taken them most of the
[54:56] night and now here they are in the midst
[54:59] of the waters and they can't make it by
[55:02] themselves to the other
[55:04] side I'll just say it again you can't
[55:08] make it by yourself to the other side it
[55:12] is the darkest hour the prophet tells us
[55:15] it is the fourth watch anybody hear me I
[55:18] said it's the darkest time it's the
[55:20] darkest age it's the darkest hour and
[55:22] here the storm is coming against God's
[55:25] people here is God's elect oh I hope
[55:28] you're hearing me tonight this is God's
[55:31] elect that is in this boat these ain't
[55:33] just another fishermen these ain't just
[55:35] another people that Satan is coming
[55:37] against these are the disciples whom
[55:40] Jesus loves these are the on Amen who's
[55:43] been handpicked by Jesus those that he
[55:46] cares about those that he loves that's
[55:49] the ones that's in the
[55:52] boat the storm did not come from Jesus
[55:55] Jesus this is not Jesus that's causing
[55:59] these problems anybody hearing me I said
[56:02] the world's problems ain't caused by the
[56:04] Lord don't make him the author of it
[56:07] don't make my daddy the author of
[56:09] tornadoes don't make him the author of
[56:11] hurricane that ain't God's doing that's
[56:13] the devil's
[56:16] doing Jesus is not trying to see how
[56:20] much Faith they have he's not testing
[56:23] them but the author of this storm the
[56:25] prophet tells us and it is I be not
[56:28] afraid it is the devil so he's taking an
[56:31] advantage he sees an opportunity that
[56:34] the disciples has now went into this
[56:36] boat and they've left Jesus behind and
[56:39] Jesus ain't there and Satan has tried
[56:42] his best you know as long as Jesus was
[56:44] with them Satan has sent was all types
[56:46] of storms upon the sea and whenever the
[56:49] storm would come up the storm would
[56:51] always fail because Jesus was with them
[56:54] whenever Jesus is there the wind begins
[56:57] to cease to move amen and the water can
[57:00] go calm so as long as Jesus is there he
[57:03] can speak to the wind he can speak to
[57:05] the waves he can stop it but now here's
[57:07] the men that Jesus has chosen these are
[57:10] handpicked disciples they are his
[57:13] elected and Satan has called he has seen
[57:16] them as they have now went without Jesus
[57:18] being in the ship the disciples are
[57:21] crossing the water and brother R said
[57:24] they left Jesus is
[57:25] behind remember they are not Crossing
[57:29] this water by their own
[57:33] choosing they are not crossing the water
[57:37] because they decided to do this this is
[57:39] not something that they come together
[57:41] and then you know they consult well I
[57:43] think what we'll do is we're going to do
[57:44] it our way this is not their decision
[57:47] this ain't even their
[57:49] will Jesus is the one that told them to
[57:52] get into the boat Hallelujah
[57:55] I said if Jesus is the one that calls us
[57:58] he'll take care of us when we get there
[58:00] amen so they are crossing this water and
[58:03] when the waters were so choppy and they
[58:05] got so rough and Peter and the disciples
[58:08] many of being fishermen they've been
[58:10] upon that se their entire life but
[58:12] they've never come into waves like this
[58:14] they've never seen oh my in their whole
[58:17] life they have never seen trouble the
[58:20] way they're seeing it now and the
[58:21] prophet said they got scared right we
[58:25] can't look down at
[58:26] them we cannot look down at them one bad
[58:30] report from the doctor we get scared
[58:32] first sign of the flu we get scared
[58:35] first sign of a cough we get scared what
[58:37] is it it's Satan causing the tumultous
[58:40] waters to be able to raise up what does
[58:43] it cause among us fear notice he says in
[58:47] 1961 when all hopes was gone and the
[58:50] little boat was pitched like a bottle
[58:52] stoer out there when 10,000
[58:56] Devils when 10,000 Devils of the sea
[59:00] swore they would drown that night cuz
[59:03] they'd gone off without him and that's
[59:05] exactly listen That's what Satan says
[59:09] today so Satan is saying the same thing
[59:12] today as what he said whenever he seen
[59:16] the disciples without Jesus and here you
[59:18] and I are living upon the waters and
[59:21] he's telling the same thing to us as
[59:23] what he said that day
[59:26] what is he saying about these he knows
[59:29] they're a threat to his kingdom he knows
[59:31] they've been casting they have been
[59:33] commissioned and given authority to cast
[59:35] out devils and they know Satan knows
[59:39] they are a threat to his
[59:40] kingdom and may I say for you that
[59:43] believe the word you that stand for the
[59:45] word of this day you are a threat
[59:48] against every devil out of hell and
[59:50] Satan will do everything he can to try
[59:52] to stop you he'll cause waves of
[59:55] sickness he'll cause waves of
[59:57] discouragement he'll cause waves of
[59:59] Doubt to come by to do what try to get
[1:00:01] you to
[1:00:04] fear Satan knows if I can get the
[1:00:07] disciples to fear if I can shake him up
[1:00:12] just enough and I can stir up enough
[1:00:14] fear he knows that as long as fear is
[1:00:18] present that faith is
[1:00:21] paralyzed no matter how much Faith they
[1:00:24] have no matter how much word they have
[1:00:26] no matter how much truth they have if an
[1:00:29] individual possesses some type of a fear
[1:00:32] faith and fear are opposite to one
[1:00:34] another faith cannot move in the
[1:00:37] presence of fear do you know that Satan
[1:00:40] can't stop our God he can't stop his
[1:00:43] word he can't stop truth he can't stop
[1:00:46] it from being revealed amen Satan can't
[1:00:48] stop God and I want to tell you as long
[1:00:51] as you believe that he can't stop you
[1:00:53] either
[1:00:56] but if we allow a little bit of fear to
[1:00:59] come up it paralyzes and it handcuffs
[1:01:02] Faith so he catches them oh think about
[1:01:06] your life he catches them at a
[1:01:08] vulnerable moment he catches them at a
[1:01:11] weak spot when you're down when you're a
[1:01:14] little bit
[1:01:17] discouraged he uses sicknesses and
[1:01:19] diseases to bring fear and despair to
[1:01:23] try to make us doubt God and try to get
[1:01:25] your faith to doubt God's word he'll put
[1:01:27] a devil on every wave that is around you
[1:01:31] the prophet tells us in perfect Faith he
[1:01:33] said there was a demon that was riding
[1:01:35] on every wave every wave and I want to
[1:01:38] tell you in life every wave that comes
[1:01:40] by your home every way that comes by the
[1:01:43] church it's Satan trying to cause a
[1:01:45] panic and a fear to come upon us to
[1:01:48] paralyze our
[1:01:49] faith think about it he will do
[1:01:52] everything he can to sink your boat sir
[1:01:57] but I want to tell you what Satan don't
[1:01:59] know is is when he sent the disciples
[1:02:02] out the Bible said he went into a high
[1:02:04] mountain apart to pray and while they
[1:02:06] was yet on the scene he was watching
[1:02:08] over that
[1:02:10] boat Hallelujah they may have been a
[1:02:13] long ways away they may have been seven
[1:02:15] angels away but I want to tell just as
[1:02:18] clear as he can see them in Ephesus he
[1:02:21] can see them in Samara theara
[1:02:23] Philadelphia all the way over until Lea
[1:02:27] in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:02:30] night
[1:02:31] Hallelujah and whenever he sees the boat
[1:02:34] taken on water and he sees the boat
[1:02:37] filling up Jesus don't remain where he
[1:02:41] was but he fulfills his promise that
[1:02:44] I'll be a present help during the time
[1:02:46] of trouble and here come Jesus walking
[1:02:49] over every demon he come walking over
[1:02:52] every wave he come walk walking over
[1:02:54] every trouble hey man he come walking
[1:02:57] right down to where they was at you know
[1:03:00] why he's watching over
[1:03:03] them sir here's my message just for a
[1:03:06] moment
[1:03:08] aloh we can either sit in this
[1:03:12] boat or you can get up and walk on the
[1:03:16] water now listen I can't think of
[1:03:20] nothing better and I think about this
[1:03:22] for my church as well I can't think of
[1:03:25] nothing better that I would want but not
[1:03:28] just a pastor walking on water not just
[1:03:31] Ministry walking on water but I can't
[1:03:33] think of nothing better than a whole
[1:03:35] church walking on
[1:03:37] water can you imagine that you possess a
[1:03:41] church that has the ability amen
[1:03:44] whenever Trouble Comes and Trials Come
[1:03:47] they've got the ability Amen to walk on
[1:03:50] the water a whole body a whole church
[1:03:53] even young people moms and dads walking
[1:03:56] on the
[1:03:57] [Applause]

[1:04:19] more listen I'm going to say this and I
[1:04:22] don't say this to be negative God knows
[1:04:24] my heart I don't but do you
[1:04:26] realize God has brought us to the place
[1:04:29] where we ain't got no
[1:04:33] choice you have no choice whether you
[1:04:36] want to walk on it or
[1:04:38] not let me tell you why this nation is
[1:04:41] going
[1:04:42] down so here is Peter and he says Lord I
[1:04:47] wherever you're at that's where I want
[1:04:50] to be at I want to walk on what you're
[1:04:53] walking on
[1:04:54] so Peter looks up and sees the Living
[1:04:59] Word he sees the message of the hour he
[1:05:03] sees the living Christ and he says
[1:05:06] that's what I want to be that's what I
[1:05:08] want to do the same way man the same
[1:05:10] works that you're doing Lord I want to
[1:05:12] do the same thing that you're
[1:05:15] doing but how in the world can we do it
[1:05:19] if we don't call to him amen Jesus
[1:05:24] walks on the water and Peter says Lord
[1:05:27] if that's you just B me to come and
[1:05:30] Jesus brother all Peter needed to hear
[1:05:34] was one
[1:05:35] word let me ask you what do you need to
[1:05:39] hear is it going to be a special serice
[1:05:42] on service on Sunday morning is it going
[1:05:44] to be a special meeting that you have
[1:05:46] certain special preacher that comes by

[1:06:02] you need to be able to hear oh my what
[1:06:06] has to happen to get your attention
[1:06:10] think about it does the nation have to

[1:06:14] to come in where it shuts the government
[1:06:16] down it shuts the everything down and
[1:06:17] they hardly no food left what's got to
[1:06:20] happen in
[1:06:22] 2024 to get your attention
[1:06:25] seriously what else would have to happen
[1:06:28] to wake us up how bad does it have to
[1:06:31] get how how tall does the waves have to
[1:06:35] get I don't want to offend you but I got
[1:06:37] to say this it's one thing to come and
[1:06:40] sit on the boat but it takes somebody
[1:06:44] that's moving into a dimension that has
[1:06:47] seen by F AI H that has moved to a
[1:06:50] sphere that has put them in another
[1:06:52] dimension that they know that that
[1:06:54] whenever they step out of that boat
[1:06:55] they're going to walk on the water I
[1:06:58] want to tell you I know I understand
[1:07:00] it's one thing that's set in the boat
[1:07:03] but the problem is we got too many
[1:07:04] people hunkered down the
[1:07:06] boat they're laying in the bottom of the
[1:07:08] boat they're laying in the bottom of the
[1:07:10] boat how can you walk on the water if
[1:07:13] you never stand
[1:07:16] up let me tell you why people Hunker in
[1:07:18] the boat they got more confidence in
[1:07:20] temporal than they do
[1:07:22] eternal
[1:07:24] absolutely it don't take a spiritual
[1:07:26] person to sit in
[1:07:28] boats come on anybody can do that
[1:07:32] anybody can go to church anybody can sit
[1:07:34] on a Pew anybody can pack a Bible R
[1:07:37] anybody can carry message books anybody
[1:07:39] can put a picture on the wall come up
[1:07:41] but it takes somebody who is serious
[1:07:43] with God that when the boat is rocking
[1:07:45] and it's Topsy tury and it looks like
[1:07:47] it's going to go over and about that
[1:07:49] time everybody else is hugging on the
[1:07:51] boat but not you you're standing up in
[1:07:53] the middle of the that ball you're
[1:07:54] standing right up in the middle of
[1:07:56] Hallelujah everything else is going on
[1:07:58] there you are standing in the
[1:08:02] ball I'm talking about standing in the
[1:08:05] middle of a test standing in the middle
[1:08:07] of trouble standing in the middle of
[1:08:08] sickness you're going to stand up and
[1:08:10] say Lord if that be you did me to come
[1:08:14] and walk on the
[1:08:18] water
[1:08:20] why why David S why do you you think
[1:08:24] sometimes the safest place is in the
[1:08:29] boat I wrote that for
[1:08:32] me why do we put more
[1:08:35] faith in boats than we do Walking With
[1:08:38] Jesus I I know why because it feels like
[1:08:43] because it's
[1:08:44] natural and we can put our hands on it
[1:08:48] feel so real feel so real I know this
[1:08:52] water's in my hands
[1:08:54] I can feel it but do you realize that
[1:08:57] faith is more real than that bottle in
[1:09:00] your
[1:09:03] hand faith is
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:08] substance Faith ain't a substance it's
[1:09:11] the
[1:09:13] substance faith is just as tangible as
[1:09:17] this platform that I'm standing on you
[1:09:20] realize what happens is we put Faith
[1:09:23] listen now we put more faith in material
[1:09:26] things than we do
[1:09:28] Jesus we put Faith in natural
[1:09:32] things like bank
[1:09:34] accounts good jobs nice homes nice cars
[1:09:40] family friends those are things to be
[1:09:42] valued but what's more important than
[1:09:45] any of that walking on
[1:09:47] water do you realize your faith can
[1:09:51] never be tested the way that it needs to
[1:09:54] be tested if you're just a boat
[1:09:57] sitter if that's all we do is just
[1:09:59] hunker down the boat how can we be what
[1:10:02] the word has ordained us to be if we're
[1:10:04] just sitting in the boat Peter would
[1:10:06] have never walked on the water had he
[1:10:08] had his hands on the boat do not let the
[1:10:11] devil talk you into staying in a sinking
[1:10:14] boat don't allow him to tell you that
[1:10:17] this world's going to continue to go on
[1:10:19] and good old USA is going to March oh no
[1:10:21] it's not it's already been propes side
[1:10:24] by the last Vision it'll be nothing but
[1:10:26] caters and Ashes don't stay in the boat
[1:10:28] the boat's
[1:10:32] sinking I think the safest place is
[1:10:34] Walking With
[1:10:35] Jesus the safest place ain't the boat
[1:10:39] safest place ain't security of the world
[1:10:41] the safest place ain't your comfort zone
[1:10:43] the safest place ain't Le osia it ain't
[1:10:45] the church it's walking on
[1:10:48] water how many times do we get hunkered
[1:10:51] down to the boat and a billow comes up
[1:10:53] and hits the side of that boat and M
[1:10:55] turns the boat around slaps that you're
[1:10:57] soaking wet you don't know what's going
[1:10:59] on you don't know when the next one's
[1:11:00] going to hit and you got your head down
[1:11:02] the boat you got your eyes closed and
[1:11:04] you got your hands on that
[1:11:07] wood and all you're doing is is hanging
[1:11:11] on and putting up with whatever comes
[1:11:14] against the
[1:11:15] boat let me say it like this you're only
[1:11:18] dealing with what Satan's handing out
[1:11:22] which means you're on the defense
[1:11:24] and you're not on the
[1:11:26] offense you're hoping it gets better I
[1:11:29] hope this gets better I hope our nation
[1:11:31] gets better it's not going to the
[1:11:34] prophet said you could put an Abraham
[1:11:36] Lincoln on every corner he said she
[1:11:38] Ascend her day of Grace 1959 the prophet
[1:11:41] said I predict either America will
[1:11:43] accept the word or they reject it and I
[1:11:45] predict that she will reject it ain't
[1:11:47] going to get better Oh Glory ain't
[1:11:50] coming back but oh glory is coming back
[1:11:54] hey man Oh Glory the stakes ain't coming
[1:11:57] back but the king of glory he's coming
[1:12:01] [Applause]
[1:12:07] back I've been guilty of holding on to
[1:12:09] the boat can you handle that I've been
[1:12:12] guilty of hanging on I've been guilty of
[1:12:15] hoping the storm goes away preach
[1:12:18] somebody I need more than hope I need
[1:12:21] more than a hope so I need a faith to
[1:12:24] stand up yes sir and step out the
[1:12:29] boat we get so much confidence in this
[1:12:31] boat I'm just preaching we get so much
[1:12:35] confidence in the boat you know what we
[1:12:36] do we start bailing
[1:12:39] water because we're trying to save that
[1:12:42] which we
[1:12:43] feel I know I'll feel better if I get
[1:12:47] some of this water out my boat so we
[1:12:49] start bailing water because if I can
[1:12:52] save this boat
[1:12:54] if I can save this boat I got the
[1:12:57] ability to save
[1:13:00] myself anybody hear
[1:13:02] me so we think by human
[1:13:05] abilities that we can save ourselves if
[1:13:09] we can tread enough water if I can just
[1:13:12] pray enough if I can fast enough if I
[1:13:16] can read enough if I can clean myself up
[1:13:19] and stop doing this and stop doing that
[1:13:21] I can get myself good up I can get
[1:13:23] enough water out of this
[1:13:26] boat you'll never do
[1:13:28] it
[1:13:30] amen because it's going to take more
[1:13:32] than your
[1:13:34] abilities listen to me it's going to
[1:13:36] take more than human ability it's going
[1:13:39] to take a six sense to get us out of
[1:13:41] here you believe that we will die if we
[1:13:45] continue to sit in the boat you know why
[1:13:48] there's more water coming in than what
[1:13:50] you can bail out it's impossible to keep
[1:13:53] the bat to float without faith it's not
[1:13:55] going to do it it's let me tell you what
[1:13:56] I mean by that you cannot go into the
[1:13:58] Rapture without
[1:14:00] faith what the prophet say it was
[1:14:02] rapturing
[1:14:04] Faith but he didn't just preach
[1:14:06] rapturing Faith he also preached
[1:14:08] rapturing
[1:14:12] Grace you know what Grace is it ain't
[1:14:14] got nothing to do with you it ain't got
[1:14:16] nothing your abilities it ain't how big
[1:14:18] your bucket is it Ain how big your Bor
[1:14:20] is it has everything to do with what
[1:14:22] Jesus can do for you Grace is a free
[1:14:25] gift from what he's gave to
[1:14:28] you I say we need to stand up say Lord
[1:14:31] if that's
[1:14:32] you the ores are
[1:14:34] broke the boat's filling up the prophet
[1:14:37] said the sails is broke amen and
[1:14:40] people's hanging onto the boat I believe
[1:14:43] we're living in a time as I heard the
[1:14:46] prophet say it today in perfect Faith he
[1:14:48] said that the bride's recognizing who
[1:14:50] she is it's time for the bride to stand
[1:14:53] up in the middle of this boat and step
[1:14:56] out it's time that we let this faith
[1:15:00] that we've been hearing preached about
[1:15:01] and talked about and reading about it's
[1:15:04] time for that faith not to just be
[1:15:06] dormant Faith but it's got to be active
[1:15:08] Faith it's time we let our faith amen
[1:15:11] put it into action and get out the boat
[1:15:14] and start
[1:15:15] walking it's
[1:15:17] imperative it's
[1:15:19] imperative if it's no longer safe our
[1:15:23] families ain't safe our children ain't
[1:15:26] safe come on the ORS is broke you can't
[1:15:29] move the storm ain't going away there's
[1:15:33] only one
[1:15:34] answer step out the
[1:15:38] boat
[1:15:40] understand when Peter sees
[1:15:43] Jesus listen to
[1:15:45] this it's set up in such a
[1:15:49] way that whenever Peter looks and he's
[1:15:52] got to have his eyes focused because the
[1:15:55] first thing he thinks is is the way you
[1:15:58] and I think which is his Humanity they
[1:16:01] think it's a spirit but there must have
[1:16:04] been something about Peter's faith that
[1:16:07] when Peter is looking at this figure
[1:16:10] that is on the water that something
[1:16:12] happens to him and his eyes becomes
[1:16:17] illuminated in the middle of the night
[1:16:19] in the fourth watch when it's the
[1:16:22] darkest time his eyes become illuminated
[1:16:25] and he believes this is Jesus so in the
[1:16:28] darkest time Peter sees him in the time
[1:16:32] of trouble when the waves is coming
[1:16:34] against him Peter opens his eyes and he
[1:16:37] sees who it is listen now after he
[1:16:42] recognizes who's
[1:16:45] here after he recognizes who's here the
[1:16:49] Mighty God is unveiled before us it is
[1:16:53] the rising of the sun when he recognizes
[1:16:57] who it is this Revelation did something
[1:17:00] to him it literally causes an Awakening
[1:17:04] inside of Peter when Peter's eyes
[1:17:06] becomes illuminated something happens on
[1:17:09] the inside of Peter and it actually
[1:17:12] takes and his faith is moved into
[1:17:14] another dimension it's moved into a
[1:17:16] higher sphere where it moves Peter to
[1:17:22] speak
[1:17:23] he ain't crying he ain't balling he
[1:17:26] ain't whimpering he speaks look friends
[1:17:30] this is where we're at today faith has
[1:17:32] been restored by the message of Malachi
[1:17:34] 4 it's in this day that God is calling
[1:17:37] us to a higher realm than what we ever
[1:17:39] have been and we cannot sit in the boat
[1:17:41] and keep our eyes upon on way come on
[1:17:43] somebody we cannot sit here and keep our
[1:17:46] eyes on trouble and our eyes on
[1:17:48] sicknesses I'm letting you know Jesus
[1:17:50] has been watching over you he's watched
[1:17:52] over you since the day you was born he
[1:17:54] watched over you when you was just an
[1:17:56] adolescent he watched over you when you
[1:17:58] sat on the bar stol and he's still
[1:18:00] watching over you
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:05] today he's done his part he's done his
[1:18:10] part he's been with you he's protected
[1:18:12] you he's kept his hand up you he's done
[1:18:15] his part but now Peter Peter you've got
[1:18:20] to look and let your faith come to
[1:18:23] recognition let there be an Awakening on
[1:18:25] the inside to pull you to a higher
[1:18:30] sphere we need to let this
[1:18:32] space that we've been hearing since we
[1:18:34] was
[1:18:36] children to allow this
[1:18:38] Revelation to be put into action it's
[1:18:42] time that we step out of this boat and
[1:18:44] start walking on things that's troubled
[1:18:46] us walk on things that scared us
[1:18:49] something within Peter raises up listen
[1:18:52] to me
[1:18:54] the
[1:18:55] storm the
[1:18:57] storm that he had his hands on the
[1:18:59] bottom of the boat but now he's not in
[1:19:02] the Bott boat the wave that would bring
[1:19:05] fear to his Spirit now Peter is moved
[1:19:10] and it causes him to stand up and Peter
[1:19:13] is moved from just being a boat sitter
[1:19:17] till now he's going to say
[1:19:20] something Hallelujah
[1:19:23] the storm has moved his faith to where
[1:19:26] he feels he can say something he could
[1:19:30] ask anything in his name something moves
[1:19:35] him that's what we need to do we need to
[1:19:39] open up our mouths and start speaking
[1:19:41] what needs we
[1:19:44] have we got to get so fed up with
[1:19:46] bailing water that it moves our faith
[1:19:49] into action it moves us into that sphere
[1:19:52] that Commission of speech amen and I
[1:19:55] want to tell you Peter says Lord
[1:19:59] Lord
[1:20:01] ruler
[1:20:03] Messiah if that's you bid me to come on
[1:20:07] the water let me tell you what I like
[1:20:10] about this story in the middle of the
[1:20:12] greatest waves and the greatest trouble
[1:20:16] Jesus didn't remain quiet aren't you
[1:20:19] glad he don't remain silent in the
[1:20:21] middle of the storm Jesus didn't remain
[1:20:23] quiet in the middle of troublesome
[1:20:24] Waters but it was during that time oh my
[1:20:27] it didn't take 50 Scriptures it didn't
[1:20:29] take 50 quotes all it took was one word
[1:20:31] from Jesus Christ think about that the
[1:20:33] word Christ give Peter The Authority
[1:20:37] they get all he needed was one
[1:20:41] word and it give him a present tense
[1:20:44] Authority where Peter can step out of
[1:20:46] this smoke come right on out here at
[1:20:47] Peter friends I hope you can hear it
[1:20:49] tonight I believe that he's calling to
[1:20:51] you and I from the midst of the waters
[1:20:54] he's calling to bid me come come right
[1:20:56] on out here come on young person come on
[1:20:59] Mama come on well I've got this many
[1:21:01] mistakes I've done this wrong come on
[1:21:03] out here on the
[1:21:05] water if you've been sick come on if
[1:21:08] you've been down come on if you've been
[1:21:10] depressed come on out here on the water
[1:21:12] and walk with me a little
[1:21:16] while I can see Peter I can see him in
[1:21:20] my mind I can see that that boat it's
[1:21:23] moving just as much as it ever did it
[1:21:26] didn't stop the waves it didn't stop the
[1:21:29] water it didn't stop the boat from
[1:21:30] filling up Peter standing in the middle
[1:21:33] of this boat yes
[1:21:35] sir and about that time Peter gets on
[1:21:38] the side that boat and he goes
[1:21:43] to feels like a board down there come on
[1:21:47] somebody feels like a board down there
[1:21:50] don't feel like water to me I've been on
[1:21:53] water I'm swim in water I'm sinking
[1:21:56] water but I'm not sinking
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:04] now Brother David I I know Jesus can do
[1:22:07] it but this is me I mean I know brother
[1:22:09] Ram can speak to but this is me I mean I
[1:22:13] know the pastor can the ministry can but
[1:22:15] this is me you've already
[1:22:19] sunk you've already sunk that's your
[1:22:22] mindset that you've already sunk that is
[1:22:24] not Faith it's not hope so it's not
[1:22:28] maybe it's not a might be faith is the
[1:22:32] substance something's solid something's
[1:22:35] anchored something's moving it ain't
[1:22:38] hoping that I walk it ain't hoping that
[1:22:40] it happens Jesus said to come and I'm
[1:22:46] coming had Peter questioned the water he
[1:22:49] would have never have stepped out but
[1:22:52] I'm telling telling you it pulls Peter
[1:22:54] into a higher realm than see tastes feel
[1:22:56] smelling here and now he's moving by
[1:22:59] that six sense that's why he puts his
[1:23:01] leg over the
[1:23:04] boat had Peter had some of our thinking
[1:23:08] well I mean what if it don't happen it
[1:23:10] ain't with that
[1:23:12] thought what if I don't make the
[1:23:15] Rapture what if I'm Not Elected what if
[1:23:19] I'm not
[1:23:20] predestinated your faith has got to be
[1:23:23] anchored in the revelation of the hour
[1:23:25] that nobody else if nobody else in this
[1:23:28] building is going to get out of this
[1:23:30] boat I don't care if there ain't one
[1:23:32] more person there may not be one more
[1:23:34] teenager there may not be one more
[1:23:36] preacher but I want to tell you I myself
[1:23:39] are not staying in this boat if this
[1:23:41] boat's going down I'm not staying here
[1:23:43] if the world is falling apart I'm not
[1:23:45] falling apart with it I'm stepping out
[1:23:48] of
[1:23:50] all I want everybody to make it but
[1:23:53] there's one person I got to make sure
[1:23:55] that he makes it it ain't my mom it
[1:23:57] ain't my dad it ain't my brother but
[1:23:59] it's me oh Lord that's standing in the
[1:24:01] need of prayer I want to step out of
[1:24:03] this
[1:24:08] boat the storm didn't change at all
[1:24:12] listen to me listen to this thought the
[1:24:16] storm didn't change nothing on the
[1:24:18] outside but when it comes to Peter it
[1:24:21] changed something on the
[1:24:24] that authority of Jesus's word it pulls
[1:24:28] Peter to a higher
[1:24:29] Dimension it caused him to be raptured
[1:24:35] up back about it he was caught up the
[1:24:40] word pulls him into a sphere where all
[1:24:43] things are possible to him that believes
[1:24:47] he went beyond his senses feelings
[1:24:50] emotions human ability human efforts
[1:24:54] preach with me right there and it sent
[1:24:56] him into a dimension of faith that
[1:24:58] allowed him to do the
[1:25:00] supernal don't you see that is your
[1:25:03] Bible tonight that is your entire Bible
[1:25:07] it's full of the very same things the
[1:25:09] faith of Abraham that can call those
[1:25:11] things which were not as though they
[1:25:14] were that's the faith that Simpson had
[1:25:16] when he picked up the dry bone of an ass
[1:25:18] and he killed 500 philistin listen it
[1:25:21] took that same faith to pull him into a
[1:25:23] sphere that's the same faith that David
[1:25:25] had when David come against the Giant
[1:25:27] when he faced him that day that's the
[1:25:29] faith that Shamar had and I want to tell
[1:25:31] if that's the faith they had and faith
[1:25:33] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:36] what kind of Faith you think you're
[1:25:38] going to have living in this Dark Age
[1:25:40] it'll do the same thing for
[1:25:44] you circumstances don't matter odds
[1:25:48] don't matter how far the boat sunk into
[1:25:50] the water don't matter it it don't
[1:25:52] matter how outnumbered you are it don't
[1:25:54] matter how big the waves are don't
[1:25:57] matter how hot the fire
[1:25:59] is Faith
[1:26:02] believes it looks to the Divine promise
[1:26:04] of God that's right I'm going to tell
[1:26:07] you something you stand up in a boat
[1:26:10] you'll get everybody's attention in the
[1:26:13] church you'll get everybody in your
[1:26:14] family attention you confess you're a
[1:26:17] Believer and watch what happens you say
[1:26:19] you're sold out you say you believe God
[1:26:21] you say that you're going to be anchored
[1:26:23] in Christ and I'm going to tell you
[1:26:24] people are going to think you're
[1:26:27] crazy you tell people you're going to be
[1:26:29] a water Walker and don't see if they
[1:26:31] don't think you're crazy you'll be
[1:26:33] called Fanatics Holy Rollers come on but
[1:26:37] the difference is when you heard him say
[1:26:40] come it didn't matter who else said what
[1:26:43] let the naysayers say whatever they want
[1:26:45] to let the let the Fanatics say what
[1:26:47] they want to let the carnal mind say
[1:26:50] what they want to let everybody else El
[1:26:52] but when you hear the word to you
[1:26:54] personally and Jesus speaks to you and
[1:26:56] something inside of you takes and it
[1:26:58] reverberates what's been said to you
[1:27:00] you'll say yes Lord I'm going to walk
[1:27:02] with
[1:27:03] you that's the way denominations look at
[1:27:06] you when you walk out of their
[1:27:08] boats come on when you won't put your
[1:27:11] name on their book they're going to look
[1:27:12] at you that way even people around the
[1:27:15] message will look at you
[1:27:16] strange well who do you think you are
[1:27:18] you young whipping snapping preacher
[1:27:20] we've been preaching this for 45 years
[1:27:22] we've had this revival and that Revival
[1:27:24] and we preached this and that who do you
[1:27:25] think you are coming around our boats I
[1:27:27] mean our church telling us how to get
[1:27:29] out of the boat we've been building this
[1:27:31] boat for 45 years we don't need your
[1:27:33] help I don't want in your boat I want
[1:27:35] out of your
[1:27:37] boat I went
[1:27:39] out I'm afraid that's where people's
[1:27:41] missed it at we know quotes we know
[1:27:44] scriptures we know seals we know
[1:27:46] Thunders we know pulls but what good
[1:27:49] does mechanics do you if you're faith is
[1:27:52] not pulled into that
[1:27:54] Dimension to put it into
[1:27:57] action what good does it do if it's not
[1:28:01] put into action you realize I
[1:28:04] wonder some people comes around the
[1:28:07] message that they don't just walk
[1:28:10] Catholic boats for message
[1:28:11] boats or Baptist boats for message boats
[1:28:15] come on
[1:28:16] somebody Peter puts his foot out there
[1:28:18] and that thing bobing back and forth
[1:28:21] listen to me he didn't try to figure it
[1:28:22] all out he didn't wait until he's able
[1:28:25] to quote all Ten Commandments without
[1:28:26] missing one word preach with me as a
[1:28:29] matter of fact the prophet tells us in
[1:28:31] perfect Faith he never even
[1:28:35] thought are you hearing me in other
[1:28:38] words his intellect did not
[1:28:41] comprehend so God in faith moves up into
[1:28:45] Peter it bypasses his thinking because
[1:28:48] the prophet said if he would have
[1:28:50] thought he'd went right back to that
[1:28:51] boat so his Oh Glory Faith bypasses
[1:28:55] human thoughts and human abilities and
[1:28:58] human understanding H2O it's water you
[1:29:00] can't walk on water water can't be
[1:29:02] walked upon come on but I want to tell
[1:29:05] you his eyes is declaring that it can't
[1:29:07] be
[1:29:09] done amen it declared it can't be
[1:29:12] done so we don't try to figure it out he
[1:29:15] simply believes that all things are
[1:29:17] possible he had already heard Jesus say
[1:29:20] that where I am
[1:29:23] you may be
[1:29:25] also what do I got to do take him at his
[1:29:28] word can you imagine for somebody to
[1:29:30] step out on the word without fear
[1:29:32] without doubt without questioning God
[1:29:34] that just simply that is the Walk of
[1:29:36] faith that we can possess let's stand
[1:29:39] our feet
[1:29:40] tonight
[1:29:42] Hallelujah there's a real that you and I
[1:29:44] can walk in tonight where all things are
[1:29:47] possible brother and sisters we cannot
[1:29:50] afford just a set up around and hope
[1:29:53] somebody else gets up and walks on water
[1:29:55] and been encourage yous to be able to do
[1:29:57] it listen to me be the one that does it
[1:30:01] take the initiative to yourself that if
[1:30:04] nobody else in this building is going to
[1:30:05] walk on it Lord let it be me just B me
[1:30:09] to come Lord if you're going to send a
[1:30:12] Revival I don't want you to start with
[1:30:14] the ministry or the deacons or any
[1:30:15] office start with me tonight send the
[1:30:18] fire down upon me Lord and let me stick
[1:30:21] my foot out the water and I just start
[1:30:23] walking on it can you imagine here this
[1:30:26] man is he's got his eyes fixed Upon
[1:30:29] Jesus and I'm going to tell you as long
[1:30:32] as you keep your eyes on the promise and
[1:30:35] your eyes on the word and your eyes on
[1:30:37] Christ you'll walk on the water but the
[1:30:39] moment you get it on human ability and
[1:30:41] you start looking at how big the waves
[1:30:43] are and you start looking at how deep
[1:30:45] the water is you're going to start
[1:30:46] sinking Peter oh God help us can we bow
[1:30:49] our hearts
[1:30:50] tonight I know this has been simple
[1:30:53] tonight but God help us God help us may
[1:30:58] there be somebody in this place
[1:31:00] tonight that takes the initiative Lord
[1:31:03] if that' be you just bid me to walk on
[1:31:06] the water tonight I don't know what
[1:31:08] you're dealing with I don't know what
[1:31:09] troubles you got but I want to tell you
[1:31:12] that your faith can pull you into a
[1:31:14] higher realm to set you into a place
[1:31:17] where you can walk on what other people
[1:31:19] sinking you simply have to have a
[1:31:23] perfect face you got a perfect God you
[1:31:26] got a perfect word you got the word of
[1:31:29] God for this day what do you need that
[1:31:32] word to become an action not stationary
[1:31:36] not just understanding not intellectual
[1:31:38] knowledge but let that word become so
[1:31:40] real that you got your eyes fixed on the
[1:31:43] word keep your eyes on the promise keep
[1:31:45] your eye on Jesus Heavenly Father Lord
[1:31:49] I'm aware of the Simplicity tonight
[1:31:53] but I hear your Prophet say today in
[1:31:54] perfect faith when he was talking about
[1:31:57] Peter walking on the water he said now
[1:32:00] you're preaching bride material bride
[1:32:04] material because it's not intellect it's
[1:32:07] not head knowledge it's not something we
[1:32:09] read from the book but bride material is
[1:32:12] a faith that is put into action where
[1:32:15] it's both Dynamics and mechanics
[1:32:17] together that begins to move in the
[1:32:20] Supernatural will begin to
[1:32:23] perform I pray tonight Lord may this
[1:32:27] congregation Lord I pray may it not just
[1:32:30] be the ministry but I pray for the body
[1:32:34] may we be Water Walkers
[1:32:36] tonight Lord we see you in your word in
[1:32:40] this Dark Age Lord where the Prophet
[1:32:42] tells us that the Le osia was completely
[1:32:44] blackened out it's the last watch but we
[1:32:48] know Lord It's darkest just before the
[1:32:50] dawn and we know know tonight Lord that
[1:32:52] you're watching over us you've not left
[1:32:55] us here in this day by
[1:32:57] ourselves but you're walking over us
[1:32:59] tonight Lord you're watching us every
[1:33:02] move we make every time we pray every

[1:33:14] help me to walk on things Lord God Lord
[1:33:18] help me not to get to the place where I
[1:33:20] get so stressed out so down Lord that it
[1:33:23] pulls my spirit but I pray
[1:33:27] Lord help me to be more than just a

[1:49:28] just because he
[1:49:35] lives how many say we have a life worth
[1:49:38] living my what a I know Brother David
[1:49:41] said it was simple but what a powerful
[1:49:43] message those that walk on water I
[1:49:46] thought while he was preaching that I I
[1:49:48] can't help myself and you know the Bible
[1:49:49] says when the word Goes Forth it's food
[1:49:52] to the eater and or it's bread bread to
[1:49:54] the eater and and seed to the soar and
[1:49:56] so I I get to hearing him preaching I
[1:49:58] got thinking about that that water
[1:50:00] Strider you know the all the other
[1:50:02] insects they can't walk on water like
[1:50:03] the water Strider can and the scientist
[1:50:06] says well why can they walk on it when
[1:50:07] nothing else cares he said well because
[1:50:09] they don't have the weight of the other
[1:50:11] insects I thought isn't that something
[1:50:12] that Paul would tell the Believers to
[1:50:14] lay aside every weight and the sin that
[1:50:17] would so easily beset us I thought what
[1:50:18] is God trying to do but make us have the
[1:50:21] ability to walk from one dimension into
[1:50:23] the other I thought that's something and
[1:50:24] they gave him the name the water strier
[1:50:27] I thank God tonight that we're some
[1:50:29] water striders is it isn't that a
[1:50:31] peculiar name The Strider The Strider I
[1:50:34] thought you know you know that that's
[1:50:35] what God made us he made us and gave us
[1:50:37] the ability to walk but when I when I
[1:50:39] saw that I thought you know why they
[1:50:41] call him a Strider a Strider means it's
[1:50:43] one that takes decisive steps in a
[1:50:46] specified Direction well that's what
[1:50:48] God's called us to do I've took a
[1:50:50] decisive step I want know how many
[1:50:52] tonight can say I have decided to follow
[1:50:55] Jesus I've made a decisive step in a
[1:50:58] particular direction a want somebody
