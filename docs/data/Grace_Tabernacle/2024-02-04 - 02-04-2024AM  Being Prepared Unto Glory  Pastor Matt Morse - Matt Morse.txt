move and and what all he has in store we have a a prayer request it says please pray for uh kalissa uh for a safe and successful uh C-section delivery on Tuesday and prayers for a healthy baby just want to remember them in prayer and it said for for David Paul and kalissa but I don't think David Paul's having a c-section so we're just going to pray the Lord will be with sister kalissa in that

and wives here with us this morning they've been watching the services uh online and uh just trust it's been a blessing to you haven't haven't had the opportunity to shake their hand but I've been able to uh be a a witness to them and many phone conversations that we've had and and I invited them to come and be a part of the service here this morning brother Ben and his wife are getting getting baptized today and we actually have five right now that are getting baptized this afternoon so uh we just we just look forward to to that and I believe there's just something special about a people that uh that come and give their heart to the Lord amen so the Bible says there's joy in the presence of the Angels when a sinner is saved amen I don't know about you but it brings joy to my heart when somebody wants to give their heart to the Lord and uh so we we look forward to uh what we have today in the communion service this evening so uh we we have a lot uh that is going on today so we just trust the Lord we want to welcome uh uh sister Susan I don't know where she is but I knew she was here I can't see she's hiding back there in the back y'all turn around look at her don't want to embarrass her U her and her family but uh they just moved uh back home from Texas they've been lived for several years out of state and and they made this their home church so we want to welcome her and her family this morning may God bless you and I I'll welcome you appreciate you for being amen for the Lord bringing you here amen this is this is really low I don't know if you can help that out a little bit and may be just on these but but we just uh uh appreciate what God is doing and we want to welcome each one of those her her daughters and sons are scattered around the building and Jodie and and Kenzie back there and Jacob and Jace and Jack and they're just scattered all over the building it just touches my heart to see them here this morning amen they just always have a special place in my heart and I trust that the Lord would be able to use us in in Fellowship together to be able to help one another amen and I believe that's what it's all about amen so we just we want to uh just go to the word this morning we're going to read out of Romans in the ninth chapter and we'll start in the sixth verse and we'll read through the 16th verse brother Matt it's been a while since I saw you and God bless you you're and your wife and and I I don't know I I baptized him a few years ago about about four three or four years ago and so it's sure good to see you this morning I remember his wife was singing with the girls and and and sure sure has a wonderful Voice singing and I told the girl she has a high soprano voice we don't really have anybody here that has that so it's sure good to see you see you again God bless y'all me we want to read Romans the 9th chapter we'll start in the sixth verse and we're going to read through the 16th verse and uh and there's uh the Lord just kind of put this on my heart it's been a few weeks ago and U but but uh but we've had some ministers and and in and and so we just had the opportunity to get to this but the sixth verse the Bible says this is Apostle Paul not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they called children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come to Sarah she shall have a son and not only this but when when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her that the Elder Shall Serve the younger here Paul's laying this out and establishing that before that these children were ever even born that God was speaking to their mother he says see it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger so is showing us that God knew something about them that their mama didn't know about them he knew something about them before they were ever born he knew what they would be he knew how that they would grow up he knew how uh that their that their life would be in the direction that they would go he said so he said to her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated he said what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God in other words is God unfair that he would choose one over another he said God forbid he said for he has said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but it's of God that showeth Mercy somebody say Amen we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats and I want to speak on this subject this morning on being prepared unto Glory prepared unto Glory here Paul is speaking this and uh and we'll uh just jump right in here this morning and for the sake of time but here he is speaking this and uh as he is going through and he's he's speaking of the election of God or the purpose of God in our life and how many how many realize that you whenever you belong to God that you always belong to God Amen we I know we preach that and we but we want it established in the hearts of people that that that that were not just uh that we we didn't just happen up on this but we but we are by the election of God and God has a purpose for your life how many believes that there there's a purpose that God has for your life and you know what I think of this subject of election and the subject of God's purpose it always takes my mind back to the Book of Ruth and and how that that that the story of this young lady how many's read that lately when the the story of this young lady and how uh that that she had she had left out of or she had gone out into uh or married in in in Naomi's son and and Naomi's children had both passed away and and and and she had followed Naomi back into Bethlehem remember how the story had started out they had a famine in the land and they all all of her family had gone out and the sons had married after a little bit of sickness came the sons had passed on and now here was Naomi and two daughters-in-law and and and but but the Lord had brought a time when Naomi would go back into this land of Bethlehem and we realized that when Ruth had gone back in there that brother Mark that this was this story but said it was more than a love story most of us read it as it's a great love story and the theologians they say well it was a love story even many of them would say today that it don't even belong in the Bible it's just a it's just a love story he said but see but God wouldn't put nothing in the Bible that wasn't inspired see so when it when it was put there it was something that was inspired by God and he said it was matter of fact it was one of the most outstanding books that God had accepted to be able to be put in the Bible and the reason it was put in there is because it was inspired because there was a hidden revelation in it and and when you catch that hidden revelation or the real meaning it brings you close to God and so here we see this story brother Mark it wasn't just a love story it wasn't just that that this that she just uh happened to meet this it isn't something to a fairy tale about but but we realize that there that this story of Ruth is actually a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ today and I mean if you read through this story you'll find this to be the case that that that is such a perfect type of us but in the story of Ruth there are four parts to the story of Ruth there was a decision a labor and then rest and then reward those are the four parts as the story would break down and so the very life of a Believer we go through them same stages we come to a stage in our life there's a stage of decision there's a there's a Time of Labor there's a time of rest and then there's a time when you'd receed the Crown of Life and so we see this play out in this story of Ruth can I just kind of just go through this just just to lay a foundation this morning but when you see this laid out here Ruth was leaving and she was coming with Naomi y'all remember how the Naomi was going back into Bethlehem or in into Judea and the Bible says it was during Harvest Time and she would she would go back and and the reason she was going back brother Mark is because she was searching for something here she was searching for food and searching for uh satisfaction and she would she would go back into this town of Bethlehem and and and the Bible says as they went into this place that she called new or Naomi being an old lady and she called upon Ruth and she said go find somewhere that we can have food and go so she went out to glean it and to look for a field to glean it and I thought isn't it something that that Naomi didn't direct her to a field she said well you you just got you got to find food and so here Ruth just like each one of us she went out and she was searching for something that would be her satisfying portion she was searching for something that was would satisfy the hungering and the thirsting that was in our body and and brother Charles just like each one of us done she she went out I thought can you imagine Ruth that she went out Brother David and she went out searching for this that she passed by many fields and maybe she came by one and she sat down on the on the on the on the bench down there and she sat in this field and she looked but there was just something about it that she wasn't satisfied with the field and she went maybe a little bit farther and then she came by another field and by they had nice fences down the down the way and maybe some stone walls down there and it looked real good and there were there were a lot of of Reapers out in the field but there was just something about it that that it didn't draw her there was no attraction to her it it was something that didn't satisfy the longing that was in her heart brother Marshall she just kept on going she went border after border as she went along the journey searching for a place that she could find food and a place that she could find satisfaction a place that she could find rest and the Bible said all of a sudden as she came up on this field that belonged to Boaz that she just so happened up on this field I thought isn't it something that after all this walking and all this journey that God would put a field in her path that would satisfy the very hunger that was in her soul it was her satisfying portion as she was searching brother thearrow and she came by this field of Boaz all of a sudden there was something inside her that Drew her to the field of Boaz something pulled her to the field of Boaz friends it wasn't an accident that she came to this field but there was something on the inside of her that Drew her to this place she had been many places she went by many places but something inside her it drew her to this place you say what was it brother Matt that Drew her to the field of Boaz let me tell you what it was I'll make it easy for you it was the Divine Purpose of almighty God it was something on the inside of her it was God's purpose and the Very plan that he had for her life it wasn't in the city that she was born in it wasn't in the household that she was born under it wasn't the name that she was born to it wasn't her old husband but when she came by the field that belonged to Boaz there was something inside her that pulled her into that place it was the Divine Purpose of God you realiz you realize it didn't matter how far you go in this life it don't matter how many stops that you make along the road it do matter how many churches that you went to it don't matter how many denominations that you belong to but all of a sudden there'll come a time that there's something that you'll find that will satisfy the longing that is in your heart you see when God has a purpose for you isn't it something that God's purpose for her life had to come to pass all the circumstan I Won't Go the whole story but all the circumstances in her life happened that God's purpose would be able to come to pass do you realize that that's the same thing with every one of us today when God has a purpose somebody say this with me when God has a purpose then it must come to pass see that's God's purpose for us brother said God's purpose can never be defeated he said there's nothing can defeat it he said so happy that we ought to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present nor things to come there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no death there's no Peril there's nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God somebody let that get established in your heart this morning that there ain't nothing in this world that could separate you from God's purpose he said what God has imagined in his mind and what he's purposed in his heart to bring to pass there's no demon somebody say no demon there's no power there's no there's nothing that can separate you from God's Great Immortal and Eternal plan we could establish our lives on that one point Brother David that God's purpose can never be defeated can somebody say that with me God's purpose can never be defeated that's how you establish your life you watch how here she was brother Mark she didn't even know what was going on something pulled her and she went into this field and all of a sudden while she was out there gending in the field here comes a man that the Bible would recognized him as the lord of the Harvest his name was Boaz and brother Mark when he came into the field and he laid eyes on her something in his heart reached out and he and he fell in love with her and he he came over to where she was and he began to show her what her true identity was remember the words that he spoke to her he said don't don't you go glean in any other field cuz everything you'll have need of is right here you don't have to worry about going out there and searching for something else and and digging in in some field somewhere and trying to find something to get by cuz everything your heart ever desires you'll find in this field he was the lord of the Harvest brother Mark it was his field he had the to give it and when he laid eyes on her he said everything that you have need of is laying in this place you stay in this field you you men y'all keep your hands off of her don't don't tamper with her there's a purpose for her life you realize brother Mark as he began to speak to her he revealed a purpose in her that she didn't even understand you realize that she didn't know Boaz was in love with her she didn't know it was love at first sight to him but there was a purpose in her he began to reveal she didn't even understand it it's what happened to every one of us as God begin to to feel us and he give us his word and you come come around and and you begin to dig into the word of God and brother Mark you'll glean a little bit here and glean a little there and you realize as God begins to speak to your heart the purpose that he has for you begins to be revealed even when you don't understand it he's revealing it little at a time you and then and then notice what she done just like every one of us done she turned the Bible says she turned and looked at him and she said why have I found Grace in thy sight what did I do differently than anybody else why would you give Grace unto me why have I found Grace in thy sight Mar then she goes back to Naomi and the Bible says that Naomi she be to tell Naomi everything that had happened you realize Naomi whenever Naomi heard it what did he tell you I could just hear what did he tell you he said stay in the field what did he tell you he said that he he he told the men not to not to not to bother with me and he oh oh don't you realize what's happening she begin to sh tell her brother B says see what was he said Naomi was the type of the Old Testament Church so she took her back to the law brother Mark and she began to explain to her that there's something more that there was meaning behind what he was doing that there was something more to it of him just giving her a little bit of barley but she took her back all the way in the Old Testament or or or or the Old Law of Moses and and may she begin to write or or to speak to her about it and say you know this is how God had ordered it that that if you would lose a a husband or or he would fall by the wayside that that would be a redeemer that would come maybe you got might lost and you gotten dead but there could be a kinsman redeemer that would come and he could purchase and he could take all your own debt and he could take you to be his wife and he he could raise children under thy name in order to restore you back to your rightful place and she began to preach to her the message of a kinsman redeemer and brother brother Mark you notice as she began to speak it to her her true identity began to be unveiled and God's purpose for the life of Ruth was unveiled and Y y'all know the rest of the story they they met they fell in love and and she went down she went down that night in the Harvest Flo I got to get to my message but she went down and she laid down his at his feet and and he covered her up with his cloak and and to let her know that she had been accepted and then he went down before the town and he married her and he made her his wife and no longer was she under the headship of Naomi but she came under the headship of Boaz here think about Naomi being this Old Testament leader he saids see notice notice brother Mark but but what caused it to happen is because where she was gleaning see where you're gleaning makes all the difference you you realize they went into Bethlehem they how manyan knows what Bethlehem means it means the bread of life and that's what happens when you come to the message of the hour you've been gleaning you've been you may have been searching for a place to glean but when you come to this message and you begin to glean out of it and you realize that that God's message it's Jesus Christ it's the very bread of life and when you begin to glean out of it notice because she was gleaning out of the right field that she met the lord of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest he wasn't in every field going around looking for somebody that could bring over to his field but he was the Lord over his own field and because she was gleaning in the right field she met the lord of the Harvest and it changed her whole life she glean that's what we do we'll glean brother Mah by bye bye we come in and we found the field that God had led us to you didn't find it by chance you did it wasn't an accident that you came to this field it wasn't an accident that this message was witnessed unto you but it was the very Divine Purpose of almighty God that you would be able to glean and you took a little bite here and a little bite there and your identity be to be revealed here and a little bit there until finally one day you met the very one that made the field the lord of the Harvest and he took her to be his own that's the same thing that we that happened to us today what what was it that brought you to this message anyhow most most people well well my mama my mama's one that may become or my friend they introduced me or or something else brought me but I can tell you what the Bible says how many believes the Bible he said Paul said the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ it was the law that brought us here that we might be justified by faith but after faith is come we are no longer under the school Master see Naomi is the one that brought root to that place but whenever but whenever she met Boaz she she came under a different headship and Paul says see this law was our school Master we we've been raised up under this we've been it didn't matter where where you had heard it from but but we took this scripture and we were raised up into it but then one day you met the lord of the Harvest and Paul said and now we've justified by faith and after faith has come we're no longer under the school master I could preach a message on that this morning after faith has come friends after faith has come we're no longer bound by law after faith has come we're not bound by tradition after faith has come you're not bound by denominationalism after faith has come you're no longer bound by Superstition after faith has come you ain't Bound by feelings or emotion or confusion or fear cuz Faith has come unto thee we're no longer living under bondage because faith has come don't you you realize this whole world but the mar they're living in a state of bondage they're bound they're Bound by fear they're Bound By by Spirits they're Bound by addictions they're they're so bound up but the Bible says that God has not given us the spirit of fear he G us the spir of power and of love and of a sound mind therefore as Believers we're not living in a state of fear brother West we ain't going around looking and wondering what's going to happen to us tomorrow and I hope that God is able to bring us out and my goodness I hope God can get a hold of the government and I hope God can give us a good president that we can make it through to another day we don't live like that because we're Believers we're not living in a state of fear we're living in a state of rest that's what we've been preaching on the nature of Elohim that's where we're resting today brother Cody we're resting on the promise of almighty God we're resting on the promise of Elohim you realize that Boaz he gave her a promise I'll finish the work he said you you just go back home and in a few days I'll I'll take care of everything and I I I'll make it all good she went back to Naomi and Naomi said don't you worry you rest my daughter for the man that told you that he'll never rest until he gets finished with what he said he would do we can rest in it we're resting in elohim's promise brother Mark it's a promise of life not death it's a promise of Liberty not bondage it's a promise of freedom and a promise of Faith a promise of Grace it's a promise of Resurrection people may make fun of you but that's okay just rest in the promise they may mock you but you know what I'm just resting in the promise they can pick on you for it I'm just resting in the promise you mean y'all still believe in a Rapture yeah I'm just resting in the promise you mean God is still a Healer yeah I'm just resting in the promise why are why are you still sick well I I can't explain that but I'm just resting in the promise I'm not relying on my symptoms I'm not relying on My Five Senses but I'm relying on my six sense the Super S it's a sense of faith I'm resting in the promise of God we're still resting how many's resting in it today but said that's what job did he was resting on the promise you realize they made fun of job for what he believed his family come by everything that he had it had fell apart his barns had burned down his Fields had been burned he lost his crops he lost his livestock he lost his children he and then the people had come by and they be to ridicule him and make fun of him because he was still standing there his own wife she said why don't you just Curse God and die he said you speak like a foolish woman his friends come by and see you must have done something wrong job but look at the condition that you're in but you realize that it wasn't nothing that he done wrong but said he was the best man of his day and God chose him to be tested and tried whenever Satan would come by he said I'll make him curse you to your face and he done everything he could but he couldn't make him Curse God that's right why because he rested in the promise of God he said he was rested in elohim's promise he said after the skin works the or though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God he was resting in eloh him it didn't matter what comes brother Mark I'm resting in the promise of Elohim he said see he rested in it it didn't matter what come his way and one day he saw the Fulfillment of it you remember in Matthew the 27th chapter whenever the Saints resurrected and they went into the city he said in my flesh I'll see God out of the Grave he came and saw and fulfilled the very thing that he was resting in my what a glorious promise isn't that wonderful that the re the resurrection of the saints of God his wife said Curse God and but he rested in the promise of Elohim you know why brother Mark because job had a revelation that those other men didn't have he had a revelation that life with God was better than life without God that'll preach right there yes sir he had a revelation it didn't matter what had gone on in his life but he knew life with God was better than life without God I wonder how many say that today here a man that had balls on his skin he was sitting on an ash Heap everything around him had fell down he had never done nothing to God it wasn't because of his failures here was a man that had made sacrif like he was supposed to but after everything failed he still knew that life with God was better than life without God right and he rested in his promise how many say that today life with God is better than life without God he went to his grave brother Mark resting on that same promise he and he became one of the most blessed men That Ever Walked he received a double portion of everything that he had lost isn't it something because life with God I'm I'm I'm just going to preach on it a minute cuz life with God is better than life without God let me just tell you something that'll help you this morning life with God is better than life without God if you don't believe me go ask Samson what it was like when he didn't have God when he when he put God aside and and he wound up laying his head in the lap of the Lila and he lost his strength and he lost his eyesight and he was put up and publicly humiliated life with God is better than life without God see whenever God came and he went out he said Lord restore unto me my faith and that God gave him his strength back and he took 30,000 of the Philistines with him why because life with God is better than life without God if you don't believe me ask Gideon what it was like when he was hiding behind a wine press and he was a coward and he would hide from his duty because that's what it's like when you don't have God but when the angel of the Lord came by his way he gave him the strength to be the judge over all of Israel because life with God is better than life without God go ask Apostle Paul he was a murderer an out killing Christian but whenever he met the angel of the Lord when he met him on the road he said it is I the Lord Jesus brother Mark it changed his whole commission he became the very Prophet to the gentile people because life with God is better than life without God life with god brother Mar it don't matter what the old life is it may be filled let me tell you what it is I don't I don't have to guess I know what it is it's death it's sorrow it's addiction it's drug addiction it's alcohol addiction it's divorce it's family problem it's family trouble it's chaos it's Darkness it's it's adultery it's all the filth of the things of the world it's life without God but life with God will bring peace to your family life with God it'll bring peace to your home it'll bring peace to your life it'll take the habits that you have and it'll put them aside and deliver you from the things of sin life with God is better than life without God you can't do it without God let me just make it simple for you you can't do it without God that's the problem with the world today everybody wants to go to church without God they want to be Christians without God they they don't want that real life of Holiness living on the inside they just they just want the status of saying I'm I go to church and I do my duty and I pay my tithe and my offerings and I show up on time but they don't want to do it with God let me tell you life with God is better than life without God you know Mark TW once said he said see I quit he said quitting smoking is easy I know CU I've done it a thousand times is't that the truth said I've done it a thousand see life with God is better than life without God it's hard to do it without God but with God it's it's different with God you say why why is it different with God let me tell you this one time with God it takes the very desire away can I read this in the scripture James says it like this he said let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God don't can't be tempted with evil neither does he tempt any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed now that word lust it come from the Greek word epithumia which means desire every man that sins or is tempted he's drawn away by his own desire said see So then whenever this desire has conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished it'll bring forth death but see that ain't the end of the story see because Temptation comes to us all you can't you can't help but Temptation we're all tempted and tried but listen what the Bible says he said but blessed is the man that endureth Temptation somebody say amen amen for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised promised to them that love him is't that something that hear that God would blessed is the man that endureth Temptation you say well brother man how do I Endure Temptation let me tell you how you'll do it with God you'll never endure it without God you'll have to do it with God the only way to overcome sin is with God the only way to overcome addiction is with God the only way to have a True Deliverance is with God but the Bible says With God all things are possible with god brother Mark think about it with God the very things that you use as a crutch become your testimony that's the difference with God isn't it something that you get around get around people well brother Matt I you know you you you find people they'll get arrested and they'll getting some I just feel like preaching this morning y'all thank you for the Liberty but but when they they'll get arrested or something well man what' you do what happened well man I got I got out there drinking I got drunk a little bit I didn't even know what I was doing when I done it see it's the crutch why why why was you slapping around on your wife well I didn't know what I was doing it was the alcohol doing it wasn't me it was just that alcohol or the drugs or the pills that I was taking see it's it's a crutch it's always a crutch why are you in this shape well it's this addiction why are you in this shape well it was my daddy and it was the way I was raised and you know it his father before him is a way I was whatever people can use for a crutch and it become brother Mark it's what they lean on it's their it's it's what they it's it's their explanation for every wrong thing in their life it's the crutch isn't that something wouldn't it be nice just to get rid of the crutch this morning wouldn't it be nice just to be able to lean on God and take the crutch and throw it away and and say Lord I don't want to have life without God I want to have life with you just to throw the crutch aside there was a there was a man one time down at the at the Robinson Memorial Coliseum how many remember this testimony he went down there to a meeting and he came out there on crutches he was a crippled man he sold pencils down on the steps down there in little Ro and he would sell pencils to to make a little extra money he was a beggar he went into one of brother Brown's meetings he came up in the prayer line and that crippled man when he came up there they they he prayed for him and he went out and he healed him that next day next time they come back they were still in the same meeting that man they had been hopping around for all those years on crutches brother Wesley he stood out there and he was being a beggar and he was begging for pencils when they went by the next day he said that man had the crutch in his hand and he had a sign on the top of it he said these old babies used to support me he said but now I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms of Jesus but Mark what happened is what used to be his crutch became his testimony it's the very thing that used to hold me down the very thing that used to make me a beggar the thing that caused me to go through this life and be a failure has became my testimony that God Almighty is able to change my situation he's able to change your life he can take addiction out of your life he's a deliverer he can take alcohol he can take drugs he it don't matter what it is he can take lust he can take every Spirit out of your life and it can become your testimony this morning his crutch became his testim it don't matter what your T what your what Your crutch is God can make it your testimony man I feel like preacher this morning it don't matter what what it is that got you dragging in here but God can take it and make it your testimony this morning my the very thing that you have to have oh I got to have it I'm addicted to it I got to have it to get through I don't know why I'm here friends but I got to have it to get through another day won't you replace it with Jesus let him take you day by day I got to have it I can't go to sleep without it let's replace it with almighty God and let him take it from you and he'll give you the most peaceful sleep you ever had when you meet Jesus your crutch becomes your testimony somebody say it with me life with God is better than life without God you say well brother man how do you include god well here's the answer you include the word of God in your life how do you include him your prayer it stops becoming a speech and it becomes real it becomes conversation it's called communion Fellowship it's not just words it ain't just something that you repeat if you want God in your life how do you include God you seek guidance of God everything that you do you you you you you you you you ask God to guide you you follow the way that God would want you to go remember when David he brought the ark back into Israel it was a good thing how he knows that it was a good thing that was on his heart to bring it back to Israel but the prophet said but what he did is he just didn't do it the right way because the Bible the order of the scripture was that the ark was to be carried upon the shoulders of the Levites but but he came out and they put the Ark on a new car and they went back and you realize what it caused it caused death to come into the camp and here a man there was a sincere man he lost his life trying to keep it from hitting the ground when the C hit a bumpy Rock and went to turn over and here that man in his own sincerity but he lost his life because it wasn't done the way that God said to do it say see so so so we want to we want to do this and follow the ways of God brother says see so don't matter what you do in this life there are five musts how many want to hear them when you want to do something for the Lord there are five must these things must happen he said here's your five musts it's got to be this way first whatever you do it must be in God's time or in God's season so it couldn't be out of season second it had to be according to God's word friend this is good because if somebody gives you advice or Direction and it didn't Accord with to the word well then you know it didn't come from the Lord so you can always take it back to the word and see if it come from the Lord or not he says see and then the third thing is it must be through the man that God chose right God chooses you to do so he may have me do something he don't have you do God God didn't make everybody Pastor he didn't make everybody evangelist he did he didn't make everybody Apostle he did he didn't make he see he uses us for different purpose the diversity of gifts Paul called it you see it must be the man that God chose but if God is going to do something listen friends think about the age that we're in if God is going to do something these are the must he said see then it must come to the prophet first that's Amos 3:7 if you want to read it the Bible says surely the Lord God will do nothing unless he first would would reveal it to his servants the prophets so if it's going to be if if it's God going to do it it'll be first revealed to his servants the prophets and then the fifth thing is the prophet must be Vindicated by the word so it couldn't be there's many prophets that have raed that have raised up and said well I got a word from the Lord but the prophet wasn't Vindicated by the word it wasn't wasn't Vindicated by God so even though they may had a word from the Lord but the mar but it end up bringing failure see that's what's happened today he says it don't matter see people are really sincere but it doesn't matter how sincere you are when you try to do a god a service outside of the way that God provided his way it then then then we always mess it up even even if we're sincere we'll still mess it up remember when balum went down and remember God told bam don't go into the city but then then all the men talked him into it and he so he went but it wasn't because God sent him it was because they talked him into it he said see notice and whenever he went because the men talked him into it he done it contrary to what God Said and it became a curse instead of being a Revival isn't that something to go out and do something for the Lord and it be a curse instead of a Revival see that's why we do that's why we want to take things back to the word and that's why we want to we want to do everything according to the word of God but you notice what David done brother Mark he never consulted the word and it caused death to come to this man that was sincere and but said see now watch what happened he said there he said there everything was right their emotion their religious emotion it was great their intentions were great their Crusade was great their singing was great their dancing was great their shouting was great the music was great for they had the ark with them but what good is an ark without God right think about it he said what good is an ark without God it ain't nothing but a box filled with two tablets of stone what good is it without God what good it's a wooden box with with tables of stone he said that's the way it is whenever we come before the Lord today we want to do a service for the Lord I know we're having a communion service tonight he said that's like taking communion and being baptized what good does it do to be baptized if you hadn't first repented what good does it do to take communion and become a hypocrite if you don't live the laugh and believe the rest of God's word but take part of it and not rest of it it shows that there's something wrong but brother Mark but we come to take it you know me tell you why we take it because we believe the word of God right and and God has ordained it for this time and we and we live the life of a Christian can I just take a minute here I wasn't going to preach a service on communion but you realize the Bible tells us there's two reasons why a person should not partake in communion how many how many knows what they are there's two scriptural reasons to not take part of communion one was that a person was unrepentant and the other was that that they weren't born again so a man that wasn't born again he was a unregenerated or how the every you say that word but but but he but he wasn't born again and never gave his life to the Lord and the other was that he had unconfessed sin and he was unrepented that's the only two things that would stop you from taking communion so we come as Believers brother Mark we we we repent we're baptized we we we live the the word of God with all of our heart and and that don't mean you don't make mistakes every one of us do raise your hand if you don't make mistakes I didn't see a lot of hand hands go up so we're all in the same we're all in the same crowd we all make mistakes we all fail we all live in the same flesh you almost raised your hand some of you I don't I don't trick people and i s i I would have quickly corrected it but we all make mistakes so that that's not it but it's unconfessed sin something that that's in our life that's been built up that we're hiding but but confess it and make it right before the Lord don't don't miss out on communion because there's something in your life just make it right with the Lord it ain't something you got to go put on Facebook and tell everybody everything you ever done we ain't Catholics you ain't you ain't got to come to the priest and pour out everything to the priest and tell them every but but you can go to the high priest and you can pour everything out to him and say Here's Where I here's what I've had in my life and Lord I asked you to take it from me and just believe the whole word amen and come and and be a part of the service the Bible says we do that we do that in in remembrance of the Lord Jesus Remember when he came that was the The Last Supper that he had that's whenever Jesus had given this order here he was about to be taken and be crucified and hung on calvary's Cross but he came to the last supper and he and he broke the the bread with the disciples and took the wine he said do this in remembrance of me in other words brother Mark it was a it's a time of remembering the this supper this communion brother Wesley it's Tak it's the Lord's table it's taken part when you it's not just something that we go through as a ritual or tradition that that's what that's that's what that's what men have made it but let me ask you this what good is it if God isn't in it the whole church world does communion you realize that's one of the only things that that that every denomination does that they take communion in some way that it didn't matter what what what part of Christianity they were they take communion in some way but what good is it if God isn't in it see there's there's a right way brother Mark it was that we would that we would be that we would be right with God and and we would come and You' take the the bread and the wine it was a type of the body of Christ in the blood of Jesus he said I'm going to the cross and they're going to they're going to take my life he said but you just do this and remember it's whenever you come to the Lord's table and you sit down and and and you begin to feed on the bread it's as if you were sitting there with the Lord Jesus that day and he was breaking bread before his disciples saying remember what I've done for you come and have fellowship with me come and have communion with me and come and gather around the Lord's table and let's have Fellowship together and and to remember the things that God has done for us it isn't just a ritual or something that we're doing but let me tell you brother marrow if God isn't in it it ain't nothing but stale bread and fermented grapes it ain't there ain't nothing to it at all but because God is in it it ain't no different than you were sitting there that day and God was breaking bread before you isn't this something in the sincerity you realize what it is is the the all through the scripture can I just take a minute here we're about to have communion all through the scripture these fathers would go down and make sacrifices for their children and and when it started they were sincere and they laid their hands on the sacrifices and they watched the blood leave out of these animals and and they made this sacrifice for their own salvation for their sins but after a while that sacrifice became just a tradition and when Jesus came he would tell them it's it's just a tradition that you made but there had to be a real sacrifice that would come you realize that's the same thing it is that's taking communion but Mark when you take a hold of that bread he said this is my body that ain't no different than the real sincerity of those fathers that day when they would lay that sacrifice down and they would feel the blood leave the body why it was a sincere act to be able to go before God and have forgiveness for their sins and see how God stood on their behalf that's what it is to me to be able to take communion is to put your hands on the sacrifice that God has made for you and remember all that he has done he said for this one sacrifice once and for all it's the body of the Lord Jesus he said do this and remembrance of me isn't what the Bible says I know I got off my message a little bit Bible says we are to acknowledge God in all our ways you know what that means that means in every action brother Joe the decisions that we make and the things that we do that we need to make God the center of it God must he must hold the place of the highest importance in our life you said well brother man I don't I don't know if I can include God I don't I beg the differ I don't know if I can include God let me tell you why I know you can include god brother West did because God included you right that's why you can include him because he included you this is the same God brother Mark that chose Ruth when she lived in another land and he ordained her life all the way to the field of Bo West where she where where where where the very genealogy of Joseph would come from the the where we see Jesus's name in the Bible you see you see it was all ordained of God this is the same God that that had ordained job to be able to to be able to to be able to stand whenever he told Satan you'll never be able to cause him to curse me why because God knew Job he knew the very things job would do he knew Job would never fail he knew Job wouldn't be able to curse God in that way is the same God that knew Jeremiah that told him I knew you before I knitted you together in your mother's womb God included you before your ever born don't you realize friends that same God that chose them is the same God that chose you he's the same God that knew them he's the same God that knew you the same God that formed Jeremiah he's the same God that formed you and the Bible says he called you and he elected you and you see what it was he said it was the very God you say what was it he turned my life around didn't me tell you where people mess up is they say well my life turned around because I decided I wanted to do better no friend that ain't it I made a decision I'm going my life's going to be better and I'm going to start serving the Lord no that ain't it well I was sitting around the house and I got to thinking wouldn't it be better if I was a Christian no that ain't it it had nothing to do with your own thoughts he had everything to do with God it was God that knew you it was God that formed you it was God that called you Paul said it was God that elected you before the foundation of the world brother R said he said it was what God did what God called you had no will to call Glory to God he said you could have no desire to call because your nature was completely contrary to it but God by election he called you and he turned you around and he set your affections towards Christ and the things above he said how could we turn that down cuz God is the one that called you God that's one that that set your heart it's God that established you it's God that brought you here it's not an accident that you're sitting in this church this morning it's God that brought you here I know people say well you messed up here and you went the wrong way here and you went the wrong direction but it's God that is in control of our life it's God's purpose that bring you back to the message of the hour that he could feed you he could satisfy you he'd be your satisfying portion he said God by election called you it was God that turned you around listen this is what Paul preached how many knows that to be the truth that was Paul's message he said he preached the lecture he said according to election might stand you realize when Paul preached this message I got a few minutes to close when Paul y'all just get with me just a few minutes when Paul went to preach this message butar it was in the days of Jesus in the time or they had just came through whenever the phares would talk about how they were born of Abraham's seed and they'd carry that on there they'd carry that out and let everybody know I can track my lineage all the way back to Abraham I know who my daddy and his daddy and they had all this seed line everything figured out to where they they felt like they were special people this is whenever Paul would come and speak these words you know why brother Mar because they were the chosen of God because they were the natural Seed of Abraham no wonder they hated Paul Paul said but they that are not all Israel which are of Israel he said not because they're of the Seed of Abraham are they children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called notice why he's saying this because Abraham had more children than Isaac see see so just being a son of Abraham or of the lineage of Abraham it would never do anything why would it be different if you come through ishmail or if you came through Isaac why would it matter the difference it still come from the seed line of Abraham so Paul says so that it can't be that he said for it was an Isaac only the seed of Isaac was the seed even called in the natural lineage he says Esau couldn't be the the natural image of Abraham he said see so it's not the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promis are the one that are kind of for seed so here Paul took the very genealogy of Abraham I wish I had time to do it this morning but he took the very genealogy of Abraham and proed to them that that couldn't be the reason that made them children of God he said see so it wasn't of the flesh but it was of the seed or or the promise that you were kind of proceed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Becca had conceived by one Our Father Isaac he said he came to him according to election might stand out of works of him that calleth but he was said unto her the elders Shall Serve the younger Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated he said what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid so then it is not of him that willth listen he said it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but it is of god that showeth mercy and then Paul would go on and preach this wonderful message brother Mark he would say he he said has the Potter not have power power over the clay how are we the vessel he but what vessel looks at the potter and says why have you made me this way what vessel looks at the potter and said you know what I don't want to be that kind of a pot I I want to be something that you drink out of I want to be a bowl that or whatever kind of pot but he said but the vessel can't say to the Potter why have you made me this for it's in the Potter's hands it's the Potter that made you he's the one that formed you he's the one that caused you to be born to the mother that you were born to friends it wasn't an accident that you were in this life an accident that you're here this morning but it was the Potter having power over the clay he said it was a Potter that done it he made one vessel of Honor another Of Dishonor that God think of it he said if God willing to show his wrath would make power and make his power known he endured with Longs suffering the vessels of Wrath that would fit it for Destruction how would God make a vessel of Wrath that were fitted to destruction think about the same way God would predestinate you what a paradox that is that you're a free moral agent but you're predestinated you're a free moral agian and you you can make all the the choices and you can make this decision like Ruth that Ruth had to make but still yet but but you're elected of God what a paradox that seems to be but think about when the Bible makes it plain he says but God predestinated by forn knowledge see God knew knew who you were God knew what you would do God he couldn't even be God if he wasn't Eternal if God if God didn't know this service would be here this morning friends don't you realize it may catch men off guard but it don't catch God off guard he knew where we'd be this morning he knew who wouldd be sitting here he knew we'd be having communion he knew the people that'd be baptized today it didn't catch God off guard he said see God had made it this way he said he would see brother Mark he he would he would make a a vessel that way because God knew what they would be he would make a vessel of Wrath that would be fitted to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he have prepared unto Glory isn't it something that God would make you brother Mark that he could make known The Riches of his glory the reward he would make known The Riches of his glory unto the vessels of Mercy that's what I see when I look across this building this morning vessels of Mercy we all have failures but we're vessels of Mercy you know sometimes you could take a you could take a glass you go down to a flea market you buy a glass or something down there brother Mark there ain't no tell them what people's drank out of it you don't know you can look all back and you know I know everybody likes them old Fire King cup some of the the brothers them old old old timey ones or whatever but but but way they carry and all that some but but you know there ain't no telling what people could have been an old man had that down there and drank whiskey out of it every morning you don't have no idea what they put in it but whenever you got it you took it and you washed it you Sanctified it you know how you Sanctified you get get that old don't do that no more but you put it in the dishwasher and you push on brother Mark and that hot water comes around and them little Tide Pods they got to start doing is that what you use no the Pod some kind of pod and that pod starts doing its work and bleaches out the cup it sanctifies it that you could put in something that is satisfying to you see when God makes the vessel it's a vessel of Mercy you he uses it even though it may had some junk in it at one time but God made it for another purpose it may may we put put all kinds of stuff in it but God made it for another purpose we're vessels of Mercy amen look around this morning that's what you're looking at vess of Mercy let me tell you what the Bible says and I'm going to hurry and close Bible says God is a merciful god says so therefore be merciful as your father in Heaven is merciful isn't that the nature of a Believer right you know why we give Mercy brother Mar because Mercy produces Mercy he says judge not that you be not judged condemn not that you be not condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you but listen how it was given in good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall men give to your bosom you ever thought about that what the Bible said good measure press down shaking together running over you take a basket and he said this is how God will give you you take a basket it wasn't just Loosely pulling pouring in some seeds in there said but it'd be poured in there and it would be shaken and pressed down and press down to where every part of it would be filled brother Mark and still yet it'd be running over in other words when God would give you he'd give you till there wasn't no more there wasn't one empty space there wasn't there was one place in there but the mark that wasn't filled but God he said it's shaken and it's pressed down and and it's good measure and it's overflowing this is what God wants to give unto you is that something that's how God says that you'll receive I don't know about you but that makes me that makes me want to do something for the Lord he says see for what you give out the same measure that you meet or the same measure that you give out is what will be measured unto you again that that's a scripture to live by in other words if you give Mercy you you want to give Mercy like you want to receive Mercy you want to give judgment like you want to receive judgment you want to give Grace like you want to receive Grace you want to give offering like you want to receive offering you give praise like you want to receive praise think about it how you give is how you receive that's a God that's a Godly principle The Go the principle of sewing and reaping you realize how many say that this morning a Godly principle it's a god some everybody say it Godly principle the so the law of swing and reaping the Bible says be not deceived God is Not mock whatever a man Seth he shall also reap if he swws to the flesh he'll reach corruption if he SWS to the spirit he'll reap everlasting life in other words brother Mark whatever is planted will be made manifest but I'm going to tell you something that ain't just for you but it goes for God too glory to God I feel like preaching we're we're we're ready to close but that goes for God too it's a law of sewing and reaping you know what that means that whatever God put in you then God has the ability to bring out if God put something in you then God ain't just done with it but he's going to bring it to pass let me tell you something about God God has a way to get it out of you it don't matter how long it's been there God has a way to get it out of you and there ain't no one thing the devil can do to stop it he'll send spirits to keep it down he'll send malice and anger and jealousy and everything that he can to keep you from coming to pass or to keep you from from coming to your full potential but let me tell you a secret the devil will never keep you from being a son or a daughter of God God has a way of getting out of you what God put in you don't you realize friends there's a place you can be with God that the devil can't touch brother said that's what the Bible says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your red Redemption the devil can't even touch you he said you're sealed in there you're beneath the blood you can't go no more out because you're a part of God's family you're sealed by the Holy Spirit the Devil Couldn't get you even if he had to for you are dead your old husband is dead you're buried the life is hid in God through Jesus Christ and you're sealed by the Holy Ghost how is he going to get to you think about it that's where people are worried the devil's going to get me he's going to take me out of church he's going to destroy my family he's going to lead me into these things he said how is he going to get to you glory to God that ain't all of it and how are you going to get out I know they say that all the time but it ain't bu of nonsense well this person this person left the message ain't nobody ever left the message let me tell you friends that you can't leave something that you're not a part of if it ever if you're ever in it you ain't leaving out of it it's something on the inside of you it changes you and he said you're sealed in this message is the Seal of God it's the very life of Jesus Christ that comes into the heart a Believer and that turns you amen into what God has called you to be there's people all around it they'll go Every Which Way but that don't concern me the Bible says in the days of Paul there was Believers and there was unbelievers and he waited until all the unbelievers were gone and after the unbelievers were gone then the Holy Ghost fell on the rest of them that were there those that remain they receive the very seal of almighty God let me tell you it don't fase me cuz people want to go to it let them say what they want to say let them go where they want to go but I'm going to stand on the promise of Elohim that God has made in this hour there's a place that you can be that the devil can't touch you right God listen he can't touch you it don't matter matter what he does he can never touch you let me tell you what B said he said see you're sealed in by the Holy Ghost how's he going to get to you he said you can't get out and the devil can't get in right think about it you can't get out you hearing me you can't get out because you're sealed in and the devil can't get in he said why because you're a new creation not to a denomination but to the word word you're a creation of the word of God my a't that powerful somebody say that with me I'm a creation of the word your creation of the word of God said see this is God's word and he and he's made it for us I I don't have time to finish won't you stand your feet as a music players will come this morning you are creation of the word of God think about it you can't get out and the devil can't get in Praise the Lord a't that something that makes me me feel good this morning amen that God would elect a people but Mark let me let me tell you what's happen is why people are running so too and fro is because they never really got in yet right that don't mean that they can't I I believe if there if there's if there's breath in a body there's still hope I stand on that amen I I cry for Mercy for everybody I stand on that but if they ever get in if they ever get in this place that I'm preaching about this morning sir they can't get out right it's something locked in in it's a place isn't it something a resting place brother Mark that you can get with God you know what God does because of that seed that's on the inside of you they may have been buried there a long time but God has a way of bringing what's in you out isn't that something I wish I had time to preach it this morning you remember you remember that old story that the the auctioneer was going down and they had an Old Violin come up there they got up there and they here's an Old Violin in and people looked at and the auctioner went to auction off he said he anybody give a dollar dollar now two $2 doll now three they're going to auction it off and after a little bit this this old man that was sitting in the crowd he came up there and he picked the Old Violin up and brother Wesley looked it over and he got to wiping the dust off of it he get he went to pluck it on the string and held it up to his ear and turnning those little Keys tune it in just right took the old bow and took some arzin out of the case and put a little rosin on and torqu the string just right put that violin up to his cheek and held it and got the playing on it but Mark every chord that he struck it be to sing out through the auditorium see what what happened is that as it begin to sing out is the most beautiful song that you ever heard played it was the it was the best tune violin a handmade that was made by a master Craftsman and here as he begin to play it that auctioner picked the microphone back up he said who give give a th000 he said anybody got a th000 a th000 now two somebody give me a th000 now two 2,000 now 3 3,000 3,000 and a four and a four and a th000 now five somebody give five we're on the wrong side of 10 somebody give more why because something happened that's right they heard what was in it see said what happened it was in the hands of the master and the master he was the one that built it and he knew how to get out of it what was in it so that's the way that God done with you is brother Mark he whenever he gets a hold of your life it may not be tuned up just right you may come to the church this morning you may be so Out Of Tune you may have some broken strings you may be have dust all over your life but when the master gets a hold of it and he starts to play he can get something out of you that you never thought would come out of you and all of a sudden you begin to speak a different way you sing a different way you praise God a different way why because he has a way the master knows how to get out of you he's the one that made you he created you he formed you in his own image and Brother David Paul he can take you and he can play a tune with your life that nobody ever dream dream they would ever hear and all of a sudden you become a person of value let me tell you why you don't feel that way this morning you don't feel like you're worth anything you know why because your life it's been it's been shattered you've been through a lot of stuff you feel unworthy it's the gospel truth I'm preaching to somebody you feel I'm worthy but let me tell you in the scripture you ain't the only person ever felt that way cuz that's the way Peter was whenever Jesus came to him and Peter called him you notice what Peter said he said get thee away from me Lord for I am a sin man he was unworthy when the angel of the Lord came to Isaiah that day remember he said the angel came down and he began to call Isaiah Isaiah said oh Lord he said I'm a man with unclean lips and I live amongst the people that are unclean but one of the Angels he went over and he took a coal of fire off of the off of The Altar and he came over and he touched his lips with that coal of fire and brother weson when he touched it he said he said your iniquity has been removed from thee by a't it something into the very when he touched him the Bible says it was a live coal it wasn't like a charcoal like we use but it was a stone a live Stone then there something he took that red hot stone and everywhere that it touched it cleanses let me tell you this that's what brother M say he said this is what Jesus was he said he was a Lively Stone he said he was the the stone that the builders rejected but he became the chief Corner Stone they disallowed him he's a precious stone but he's become a Lively Stone this morning and everything that he touches is healed think about it everyone that touches the stone is healed he's a Lively Stone brother Mark it don't matter what part of your life that you need help in if you'll if you'll let this Stone get a hold of it it'll it'll fix it every part of our life brother Mark you say I'm unclean so was Isaiah I'm unclean so was Peter you notice what happened after the co of fire touched his lips brother Wesley it changed his confession then when the Lord said I need somebody to go Isaiah jumped up he said oh Lord send me send me oh Lord amen a man that was unclean but he said send me God has a way to get out of you what he put in you let's just bow our heads together this morning say brother M you've been speaking to my heart I'm going to give you an invitation this morning say there I know there's something in me that's and I'm living far below my potential can anybody confess to that and raise your hand God sees your hands God bless every one of you brothers sisters God I'm living below my potential but Lord there's things in my life Lord I here we're going to have a communion service this evening Lord I want to give it all to you Lord I'm laying it down at the altar Lord I want to I want to lay it aside this morning and let you get out of me what you put in me Lord Jesus Lord how wonderful that you are Lord God you see the hands around the building God knowing that every one of us Lord we could look at our life and find our own flaws but I thank you Lord that you're you're greater than my own as that brother said last night even we look at our own self we can condemn oursel but you're greater than that we lord we we we know oursel we but we just come before you this morning Lord God we lay our life down before thee Oh God God I ask you Lord that you would touch every part of my life Lord as as Isaiah that day Lord and you come and sent the Angel by the way Lord I pray You' send that same Angel this morning God as your word is being ministered Lord that you would come and and touch each believer Lord let us leave this place Lord let us lay everything aside Lord God that be we could be one with you God here's some Lord they haven't known you in a long time lord hadn't served you Lord her life may been going the wrong way but God you brought us to this place this morning to speak this very message and I know you were dealing with hearts Lord you pulled me several directions this this morning God I ask you Lord that you would touch every one of them Lord give them the courage to be able to lay their life down God that the very seed that's laying on the inside of them may there been some water today God that has gone forth that that seed would be able to press out of their life Lord we just give you the glory for all you do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen can you sing take this whole world Amen you can take this whole world but give me Jesus you can take this whole world but give me Jesus you

Jesus I won't turn back I won't turn back amen won't you Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning I isn't he wonderful amen we just as we get ready to close the service we're having our baptism this afternoon now I don't know what the the weather is doing out there we uh spoke with brother Ben um about using their baptism if if need be but we're going to try to go down to the river and and be baptized and those that that can and just the just the Lord the Lord willing and but we're going we're going to make make it happen one way or another and you know let me tell you something about baptism that that Philip and the unic when he went down that day they went down Brother David Paul and they passed by this old ditch on the side of the road and after testifying to him about Jesus Christ he said well here's water what prevents me didn't really matter what where the water was it didn't matter if you put it in a baptism pool or put it in a bathtub or put it in a river I know a lot of people think got to be in a certain place but it ain't like that at all wherever he said here's water and Philip got down he back baptizing What mattered is that he repented to God and his heart he was making his heart right with the Lord and then and then he then he went down and had baptism I maybe I just want to invite you as we close this morning those that are W to be baptized I know we we had a couple and the Lord just put it on my heart uh uh a few weeks ago when the couple had asked to be baptized and and brother Ben and his wife and and to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and I just felt like there'd be more of them I don't know who was there with me but the Lord just pressed on my heart that that that wasn't the only ones and so I um I whoever I was there with I don't remember who it was but um but but the Lord just put it on my heart and I told him I I really believe there's more than that I don't believe that's the the only ones I just really felt something special uh about this this particular time so if we don't care I don't want to put you on the spot but just so we can pray together if those of you that are going to get baptized today maybe just come up with us and and uh the stand up in the front and we just want to just invite you if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus just Christ I don't know a better day than today and if there's something that you you know some that are looking for a renewal in their life and uh but we just we don't ever want to get in the way of that or hinder it uh but we just want God's will in your life amen and so uh we just want to support but maybe as a body of Believers we want to pray for these and and knowing that they're doing uh something special in their life and this is a moment that God has turned us around and and brother Mark I I believe that God this same God that he has the ability Brother David to take what he put in in you and bring it out of you he he's got the ability to take you there there's potential in you that that you haven't reached and brother Wesley we we just want to reach our full potential this morning amen so let's just bow our heads and pray for these as we go gracious Heavenly Father Lord here are these Believers Lord that have come forward today and Lord that have a desire in their heart Lord to to further their walk with you and Lord here every story is a different story Lord but God here you've been dealing with their hearts and Lord we just ask you this morning Lord that that God that the very purpose that you have given us would come to pass and God here they surrendering to the call in their life Lord and and God I ask you this morning Lord that we would do everything according to Thy word Lord that's our will Lord though sometimes we mess it up and sometimes we we don't do everything just perfect Lord sometimes I I don't say everything just right but Lord I pray that you'd be merciful to me Lord and and forgive my own ignorance Lord and but God I ask that you would help our brothers and sisters this morning and God as we go down to be baptized Lord that according to Thy word and God that your spirit would fall upon each one of them Lord that they would be sealed into a place with you that they can't get out of Lord a place that the devil can't get in and Lord we'll just give you the glory Lord as we come back tonight together in a communion service Lord we just look forward Lord to have communion with you and Lord I ask you as we go from this place Lord our our brother Marcus Lord that was sick in his body Lord I pray you would touch his body Lord as we go from this place now and we give you glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen may God bless you this morning we're going to try to be down at the poh hat Landing uh somewhere between 3 and 4:00 and the brothers will keep an eye on the weather and try to get a break there and do that and and if not we'll we'll we'll let
