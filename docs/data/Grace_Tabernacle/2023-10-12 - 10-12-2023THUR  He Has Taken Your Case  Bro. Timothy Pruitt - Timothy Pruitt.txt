believe he's worthy of our worship worthy of Our Praise I feel honor to be here with you tonight and and we're thankful to be serving the lord together in the time that we're living in I believe we're in the closing moments of time amen we're about to step into eternity and U not something to be afraid afraid of for the believer and I believe we're Believers here tonight brother Brandon would say it like that said we're living in a terrible time he said a terrible time for the unbeliever but he said it's a most wonderful time for the believer cuz we're right at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I I'm I'm looking forward to that day I ask you to pray for me especially tonight there nothing like the Lord just laying something on your heart right at the last moments and just kind of cramming and throwing it all together and it's kind of like riding a new horse you don't know if you're going to get bucked off or not but amen we we're just here to serve our Lord and we want to be conscious of what he wants and how he wants to operate and so we just let him have his way amen amen Lamentations 3 and verse 55 says I called upon thy name oh Lord out of the low dungeon and thou has heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at My Cry th drwest near in the day that I called upon thee thou said us fear not oh Lord thou H has pleaded the causes of my soul and thou Hast redeemed my life I don't read I want to read verse 58 and the Amplified for a moment oh Lord Lord you have pleaded my soul's cause you have guided my way and you have protected me you have rescued and redeem my life 59 says oh Lord thou H has seen my wrong judge thou my cause thou has seen all their Vengeance and all their imaginations against me thou has heard their reproach oh Lord and all their imaginations against me the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day behold they're sitting down and they're rising up I am their music and again I like to read this verse verse 63 and the Amplified look at their sitting and their Rising their actions and secret counsels I am their mocking song the subject of their ridicule verse 64 Render unto them a recompense O Lord according to the works of their hand give them sorrow of heart thy curses unto them persecute and Destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the Lord amen we let you be seated this [Music] evening as I was driving up here these words and I'd like to speak to you on these words he has taken your case just taking your case these words were running through my mind and you know it's kind of pushing it out ping it out cuz I've been been living a very very busy life we just got through with our meetings and and had a lot of people left over taking care of them and then preached last night at home and and then on the road today to he so then we got to head back home for the weekend cuz I'm leaving for Europe next week so got a lot going on and so you start feeling something but yet you try to say well Lord I I got a lot of things I've already got ready you know but the Lord sometimes he just pushes you into a place and so I I know better than to resist that voice and but I I I reading here and looking upon this thought amen the Lord I called upon thy name oh Lord out of a low dungeon and thou heard my voice I I'm so thankful that we have a God who hears our voice and hears our call amen that we're not just crying out into the air or just going up into the through the ceiling sometimes it feels that way but God hears our cry and it says you drew near the day that I called thee amen and thou said us fear not oh Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my soul and verse 59 he says judge thou my cause and and we we we can look in John chap 14 and verse 16 and he said I will pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and I I got to look into at this word comforter and this comforter means also a helper or an advocate or in modern transl in modern translations but in the original Greek it means someone who is summoned or called to one side especially in order to help someone who pleads another cause before another's cause before a judge it is a counsel for defense a legal assistant an advocate an intercessor and I'm so thankful we serve a God who knows how to intercede on our behalf when we're sick he knows what it was like to be sick when we're under pressure he knows what it's like to be under pressure when when we're going through trials of life he already knows cuz he was ATT tempted in all things so knows exactly what it's like to walk in a human body he knows what it's like to face the Mind battles that you'll face today or the pressures he knows what it's like for friends to leave you and people to turn against you and all kinds of things to happen because he came down in order to take on our cause and take on our case brother BR would say it like this he said Christ took me in and he took now I'm I'm his child look what he was for us he in his riches became poor that in his poverty we might become rich in his immortality he became flesh that he might take on our sickness amen and in his sickness we might have health in all my sins he was sinless but he came and he took my sins that I might be sinless he became me that I might become him in heaven amen he stands as mine and your representative tonight then God doesn't look at us he looks at our representative amen he looks at Christ who standing in our standad representing us before the father he said you ever had a court trial the representative he stands as our eternity our attorney pleading our standing to plead our calls he knows he knows to do any better than he does who knows how to do any better than he does when he's the very son of the father standing in the presence of God to plead our cause if we confess if we're Sinners tonight he will plead your cause if you'll confess your sins being Rich he became poor and through his poverty we have made we have been made rich rich in what money no rich in Heavenly blessings rich and spiritual things who who we who were once poor now have become rich through his poverty amen he stripped himself he humiliated himself and he come out and that Great Divine one from above and humiliation he came down and brought himself down humbled himself in a body of Flesh to walk among men hearing the cursing hearing the swearing feeling the pain of sickness feeling death upon him and through all that not because he had to not because he had to but because love Drew him to it and he has done all of that and became sick and had trouble you say was he sick certainly didn't he make his own thing himself his own statement he said won't they say to me physician heal yourself sure he bore our sicknesses he bore our griefs he bore our sins and he bore our sorrow Hallelujah and he is there pleading our crosss and he is taking our case amen I don't know if you're sick tonight you have a god who's taking your case I don't know if you got all your friends against you tonight you have a god who's taking your case I don't know if you have all kind of troubles or what kind of Trials you're going through you're not standing the you're not fighting the case of LA but you have an attorney amen I'm not talking about somebody down in Little Rock some hot shot attorney somewhere I'm talking about the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he has taken your case Hallelujah you know if you committed a crime and you're going to be tried you know in a federal court and you knew that if they found you guilty you was going to die you was going to an electric chair or to a gas chamber or some public educ execution they was going to have for you maybe hung or something Lynch whatever the penalty was you know that you had that was what you was going to go through if you were found guilty but you knew you know you were guilty and you must die and if you don't get some eternity to represent you you who can get you out of that trouble you'd want the best attorney that you can have amen if I know I'm facing a death penalty I'm not going to try to find the public attorney or the City attorney no I the best one I can get amen getting an attorney that was good a shrewd attorney You' feel that your case maybe was a you can relax a little bit because you had the right man on the job the right attorney but still there would be a question would this attorney be able to change the judge's idea or change the jury's mind about you and if that attorney was a shrewd speaking and knowing the laws could change that and complete your case and prove that you should live but yet in all of is great Authority and his great speech and the impression he can put upon the jury or the judge you might get to relax for a few minutes but still there would be a question in your mind can he do it can he say the right words can he make the right case can it plead my cause would I be innocent when I leave here would I have life when I leave here you would have that thought that that worry in your mind but he said in this case in this case the judge has become your attorney amen the one who could have said guilty the one who can say go to hell the one that could put you in prison he came down and he became your attorney he became what you needed for your moment in your life hallelujah amen if you're a sinner tonight there's an eternity for you that can take that sin and wipe it off Hallelujah if you're sick tonight there's an attorney here that can take you back to the word and say by his stri you are here amen amen if you can just get him to take your case there's no attorney could do it but God became man God became man there wasn't a man on the earth that could get you out of your sin get you out of your nonsense get you out of the wrongs that you have done but God God became man the very one who could judge you became the one who stood for [Applause] you the very one to put you in prison and put you in hell and say you've done it you deserve it it's the very one that says not guilty [Music] Hall I think about the woman that was caught in the very Act of adultery and they had the law that was there there that said she should die but here come the one that fulfilled the law amen the law stood as a judge but he stood as her attorney he came to fulfill it now the judge became the attorney and he standing before them and he begins to write in the sand I don't know maybe maybe maybe you don't know what he was writing I believe that he was writing their sins reminding them they needed just as much grace as she needed it amen and he wrote it and one rock began to fall after another and one accuser walked away after another and pretty soon he looked up and he said woman where is thy accusers they were all gone he had come and taken her case amen he took it so far he said woman where is our accuser she said father master I have none he said neither do I accuse thee go and send no more Hallelujah that's exactly what he did for us the Bride of Jesus Christ we were all born in sin all sh in iniquity all going down to a devil's hell and the law said we should go but he stepped in our path and he said this one's not guilty this one's not guilty this one's not guilty this one's not guilty I have wrote it all out in this place the judge himself became our eternity Hallelujah prise the Lord hallelujah he took the justice of his own law in his own hands and paid the price how much more secure should we be Jesus Paid It All when that devil wants to come to you and bring up your past and your past failures and your past mistakes and the things man wants to hold over your head you need to look at that say Jesus Paid It all he paid for my sin he paid for my mistakes he paid from my he took it and he put it in his blood to be remembered no [Applause] more Hallelujah he sent his own life back to us as a comforter as an attorney as a as an advocate he took our sin he became both judge jury and attorney oh my that sounds like a rig case to me he pleaded our case he found guilty by his we he found guilty by his own law he come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary he took his sin and he took it upon himself and he died and he paid the price and shed his blood and he gave it back as his own token his own life while we are perfectly the case is [Applause] dismissed come on now you remember when you heard those words somebody you bunch of drunk some of a bunch of druggies some amen I don't know we just had a couple coming in our church here here a few years ago and they begin to realize you know very quickly hey not every these people that was in this church wasn't always ho wasn't always saved wasn't always Justified wasn't always sanctified no it took just as much blood from me that boy that was raised on a message Pew never did any drugs never did any drinking never did none of that stuff but it took just as much blood to write on my case and say this Miss has a did a drug or an alcoholic or a prostitute and that blood is still in effect to I don't care what kind of sh you in I don't care where you're at tonight there is a judge who can become your t [Applause] he's pleading our case we were found guilty by the law the law said we should have died the law said we should have paid for it but he came and took our place he took our sin he took it upon himself the case is dismissed there is now no more sin to believer hey the Devils always want to remind you of your past you need to start telling them devil I don't even have a [Applause] pass hell hell got all kinds of things you know they got a big old list of what you maybe used to but that that ain't you no more they got the wrong man that old man's dead I got a new man that's [Applause] living hallelujah amen the eternal the attorney came down in this day and showed himself Among Us he came down in a pillar of fire and hung over a prophet I Still Believe We believe that right he hung over a prophet amen and he stood there in Houston as he would begin to speak about the gift that was in his life now he wasn't going to go up there but the angel told him to cuz the angel wanted him to realize hey I got to I got to have a place a moment here that I can show the world I'm with you and he came down and took the case is Jesus A Healer or is he not is brother a Divine healer or is he not you know the questions that going on and brother brother BW took the question and he and he just asked one simple question Dr best got all tied up why because he wasn't ready for it he wasn't ready for it and here here brother brand sitting all the way in the back and he his mind was just to sit there he said but all of a sudden he heard that same world he heard that same world and and down he said it's time for me to go he said his wife said don't go his brother said don't go he said well the angel told me to so he goes down it begins to speak and all of a sudden that world came down and a man had been taking photographs of of a Dr B with his finger and Dr Bosworth face and all of that he gets up and snaps a picture we hang in our churches we have it in our wallets hey that's more than just a picture that picture ain't just about a man that picture is about a light above a man that vindicates who the man was amen what was it he was coming down to show I have come down to take the case glory amen they go back and they go to develop the pictures and you know they go into the dark room and they bring it out one BL blank one blank that's blank blank all these pictures of of him with his finger in his face not one of them was developed glory and all of a sudden he said the man about had a heart attack cuz there's brother Brandon with that Pillar of Fire over his head I thought oh God that's exactly how God does it the devil had every kind of picture in Hell hanging of me as a sinner hanging of you as a drug head hanging of you as this that the other every kind of sin every kind of SL he took self with he done it all and all of a sudden

this praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make a boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me he took my case he heard me and he delivered me amen from all my fears all right now from all my fears and they that looked on him and were lightened in their faces were not ashamed uhh you read that I I was going to preach that tonight so I just dropping this in for free Joel chapter 2 he says it twice my people shall never be ashamed yeah right yeah I got to look at that word as shame that means dried [Applause] up I thought it meant bashful yeah it means that too but there's also a double mean it means dried up look what he said right before he said I'm going to send the former and the latter rain that's right and he said my my my Vats is going to be full of oil and wine and my floor is going to be full of wheat I'm going to have a harvest and my word will be fulfilled there will be people for a Rapture amen you you you get to looking at that real closely and you'll find out why he is saying that and why the canor why the palor why all that happened was because those people the people that were supposed to be over the wine Gardens and the wine presses and all that they had allowed it to happen that's true they had allowed the vine to W wither they allowed the praise to go down he said but I'm going to send the rain cuz I'm going to have a far Harvest and my floors are going to be full of Wheat and my Vats are going to be full of oil and wine we know what wheat is is the word of God we know what oil and wine is a stimulation of Revelation it's both word and spirit Spirit and truth this is what he's saying my people will never be ashamed cuz I'm going to take the cause amen this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles many can say all all I like how God uses that little free letter word he don't just list all of the troubles he just says all there brother he don't he don't say I'm the Lord God that sugar diabetes high blood pressure Co cancer he said I'm the Lord God that heal it can be a word this long and it'll fit in three letters amen it can be trouble this long and you can't describe it and you g got words to put to it but it'll go in all amen because he'll take up your cause the angel of the Lord encamp around about them that fear Him and deliver them oh taste and see the Lord is good and bless blessed is the man that trusteth in him Amen on down amen the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliver them out of all all their troubles the Lord is not unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such me of a contrite spirit many are the reflections of the righteous but the Lord deliver him out of Heaven yes sir oh I got to look at that broken heart the other day and I I got to stud in on the broken heart and the cracks and the things that's there and I found in Japan they got this they got this way of doing things that when a clay Vestal falls on the floor you might be walking to your mama's your mama's back with her favorite dish and going over to the seat mess around and drop it trip over something it falls and cracks and crumbles and looks impossible to put together but they they take it and they actually put it all together by using gold man some of them vessels actually become even more beautiful than what the former was the latter is more more greater than the former actually they become worth more because of the gold that lines all the cracks I thought oh God that's exactly what you done you found me in a broken condition as we read I called into him out of a horrible pit in a broken place in a broken condition some of you tonight are broken in your spirit you're broken in your life you're broken in your finances you're broken in all kinds of ways but God has come to take your call Hallelujah and he's going to put you back together and it won't be a bunch of TR a bunch of ho but it's going to fill it with deity but go will be shining out of your [Applause] life Lord thank you Lord incredible how they how they do that I don't think I got the picture before them no more but it's incredible what they look like you ask me later I'll tell you what they call it but they take they take those vessels I don't care what size how what what what shape it doesn't matter what color and they just fill them and they put them all together using gold and the latter becomes more more more worth more more valuable than the former estate hello somebody amen the Lord when I got a lot of cracks well let him feel it with himself don't feel your cracks with your pride and some self Spirit or some religious spirit you know I'm okay I'm all right no why don't you let God come to mold around that vessel and fill it with gold fill it with deity he says here he said that see there see he said see he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment but has passed from Death un life there is the Case Case dismiss huah there ain't nothing greater than going to a court and all of a sudden the judge looks at this and says this is all you got come on now this is all you got on this guy this is all the charges you got well it don't even hold you can't hold water with what you got case dismissed oh that's a feeling right there when Earthly jge and look at your penalty Wonder was some offsuit or something I've had it done before somebody tried to sue you over some friendless thing and go before the judge and he says case dismiss hey there's a feeling that Wells up on the inside there something begins to Bubble Up because you've been under a lot of pressure you've been under a lot of Heartache you've been under a lot of Torment because of this but the judge looks you and in the eye and says they don't have enough they don't have enough for you there's nothing that can hold you in court can't thism well that's a little thing when the judge of almighty God looked at our life and and say devil is this all you got is this all you got on my child it ain't enough Hallelujah and rightous his own blood not guilty anymore [Applause] dismiss no more case to it oh Lord hallelujah no more case to it the tokens been applied thank you Lord death begins to Smite against the door that has the token it has no control buddy I love that right there oh yeah it has no control the token is applied only the token is recognized he did that so the token could come to the Token was God's own life and when God made the first man he made him a son and the son was so corrupt he listened to his wife instead of God and the woman listened to the devil instead of her husband and when they did that that they corrupted together that brought a pollution to the whole world and they have to now bring children to the world and the fruit of the midst of the tree cannot be touched and when it was they brought sin upon themselves and the whole human race that was born was now born in sin there's no way to come out other than that and then God came down there is the only way to get him back that's the only way to get back a son how can he do it when his all law on law stood there and said he's condemned but the father himself became one of us see he offered a substitute and he put a woolly lamb skin over them but he said this is only prophesied of what's to come amen we know what it was like David had lust in his heart and he would repent before God but that lust still remained because the blood of that sacrifice could not take the case it could cover the case it could it could apply covering over but the sin was still there yes I want you to understand something taking the case means case dismissed it means there ain't no sin no more it ain't just a covering over there that's you know you can put a covering over this phone and you say you try to say all you want to the phone's not there but it's still there amen it's just a covering of that's what the lamb the wooded lamb did it put a covering over lust it put a covering over temper it put a covering over adultery but it was still there but when this lamb came Hallelujah why why was it still there because the life of that lamb could not come back into the worshiper he couldn't take the case he could cover it but he couldn't take it but this man came this one came out of heaven and he robed himself in humanity and it so defied human reasoning that they looked at him said there's no way this could be God there's no way this could be here if thou be if thou be if th the devil looked at him and Di he knew how great God was God would come and wrap himself in a little tiny blood Z yes be born in a virgin womb he come forth you know his first words on Earth you know what Jesus's first words were on Earth true come on somebody just like you he didn't come speaking in tongues and authority and all that no sir he come why it was Jehovah running down the streets it was Jehovah skinning his knees it was Jehovah with a headache it was Jehovah sitting on the side of the rock wondering where all of is who was going to leave him next he went through it all why cuz he come to take your casaste not just to cover it not just to put a cover and ab bandid over no he come to acknow to he come that this blood can be broke and the life of that blood could come back on the believer Hallelujah and now we're not living in the days of having the Holy Ghost and we still got sin in our life and we still commit adul no sir you ain't got the Holy Ghost come on now that's a teaching now going around well I got the Holy Ghost cuz I believe the I believe the message but you still

there's a God who's here to take your [Applause] care hey I know all about it come on he hears your cry oh May somebody cried this reason why changed about 2 hours or hour and a half before the service I don't know but I know one time this this first of this year I was in a real tough situation financially and I'm trying to figure how I'm going to do it what I'm going to do and I'm crying out to the Lord because God has spoke to a man by the name of Ron Spencer when I was about to jump off into some business one time he didn't know nothing about it I went to see him very short part of this condensed version and I went to see him he didn't know nothing about it and he comes to me and he said the Lord spoke to me and he said tell you not to go into business he said I am going to take care of him he is my servant thank you Lord so I backed out of everything and I walked away from it all had had what I thought was a good opportunity but God saw something different CU he knew where I could be tested and tried at right so just this year my wife has has to go in for MRI and there's health problems is starting to pile up and bills and all that kind of stuff and then other issues is going on and I I'm in my office crying out God do You Hear My Cry do you know what I'm going through I believe you do Lord but just help me stay in the place that you have predetermined me to be don't let me get out of my place don't let me get out of my spot to where where you want me I I want to stay where your your will is where because I know if I stay in his will he's got my calls oh somebody amen if I stay where God wants me then he will take care of me that's why my my dad was a young man he wouldn't let anybody ever ask me are you a preacher he don't ask him that don't even put that in his mind he said because man don't make a man a preacher right I know that's a problem right now we got is a lot of man-made preachers pastor called Daddy called but not God call that's why we got all the nonsense we got going on but if God calls you got to take care of [Applause] if God calls you God to open the doors you ain't got to kick them down you ain't got to push them down you ain't got to blow down you ain't got to do nothing God will open the door if your God called that was free anyway I'm crying out to God it's on a Sunday after I got there leading to singing I got up led to singing I boy inside I was deflated but I said I'm going to still pray praise God I don't care if I'm about to declare bankrupt you I'm going to praise God I'm just going to give him glory so I left the pull pit went to the office and I fell on my knees and crying out to God on Monday morning my wife would walk with my daughter and daughter-in-law down this road to just take a little walk she'd come back by the mailbox the mail hadn't even run yet which we figured out later and she brings in this little card and it's a card addressed to me and I open it up and says thank you for being used of God you you don't know how many times you've helped us and sending quotes and scriptures and this that and the other he said I I we just want to give you a little token of our appreciation I flopped the check over and it was not just enough it was more than [Music] enough and I got to realize here I was crying on Sunday the ma the check was already in the [Applause] [Music] mailbox already saw it coming before it got there he already took up my t before I even knew I had a case before I even knew I was about to go through a valley and a trouble and a situation here I am saying Lord help me help me help me he said hey boy go to the mailbox it's already been provided for you I thought oh God tonight what would it be if you would realize it's already in the mailbox you need hear it's already here you need Joy it's already here you need Deliverance it's already here go to the mailbox go open up the joy of Salvation go pop the top off of the W of stimulation of Revelation and let God come and touch your heart like never [Applause] [Music] before he's taking your case you make this personal tonight because it's real easy sometimes to see God well he help that one here to take your case everybody say my case my case amen we see here life could come now upon a worshiper my there's so many things we can go through let's go on down here brother BR would talk about this about the sacrifice he said he said see that sacrifice that laid upon that altar that worshipper had to walk up there Abel he had to walk up there and hack at his throat and blood was few all over he said what was it going on he said the worshipper had to be identified with the sacrifice so the sacrifice could take his CA in his case this is exactly how people don't they they want the they want the lamb but they don't want to identify on they don't want blood all over them they don't want a messy birth and I don't care how you skim it slice it dice it cut it up and put it on a barbecue if you want the New Birth it's a mess it ain't no confession and just profess and say I believe the message no sir that is not the new birth amen amen that's why we got a lot of rotten eggs because we're taking an intellectual conception instead of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal that comes on the inside he's the comforter the guide that shall lead you into all truth a't going to know all truth unless you got the GU to lead you in all truth get it backwards but he said once we have become identified he said then no I no devil no sickness no death no sorrow no anything else can bother you as long as you hold that token over it you're unchanging Faith Paul Sayes that and forms the form of Jesus Christ the image that you're walking in today he said when I see the token I'll pass over here it's a sign it's a sign that the price has been paid Jesus Paid It All and you received it from him and you're holding the token in your hand and you have the Assurance of Resurrection you have the Assurance of everything you have need of and this journey is provided by that token that's paid for sir you had to buy the ticket to get on the airplane he paid the price for you to [Music] Goen there's no devil can stand before it there's nothing can stand before it because God has accepted it and you hold that token in your hand the price has been paid it's a positive token on thank you Lord said when you're in a court when a trial set you know that you're facing death here in the nightclub man that just killed this Mr oswal you know you were facing that something similar to it you'd hire the best attorney you got I would if I knew my life was at stake I'd hire the best attorney I could find every person would it's the only sensible thing to do but in this case you know you're going to Electric care you're going to be separated from your family whatever the attorney is trying to plead your case the attorney has got to make it so clear to the judge that the judge will see the justice of your act oh God if the people could only see this our judge is our attorney the case is settled it's all over the same one as judge is our attorney the case is settled we have the token both judge and attorney is the same person when God was made flesh and dwelt among us our judge became our ET [Applause] turning the case is settled and the Holy Ghost is here for a token you're ready to pass from here to the land be thank you Lord he would say in the church age book he said where is there what is there to fear the Judgment that fell on him on the cross at the grave when he descended was for us he absorbed the first brunt of the wound of sin and there is now no condemnation to them which are Christ Jesus for assurity for assurity our attorney is our judge he's both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it is finished there is now no for therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promises he ever failed to manifest why should he fear the punishment of death it has all been overcome here is a mighty conqueror he is the one that conquered Both Worlds of the seen and the Unseen he is is descended now and descended above all unto him has been given a name that's above every name yes he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and has the keys what he looses is loose and what he binds is binds there's no changing of it there's no conqueror before him and there's none behind him he alone is savior he alone is Redeemer he is the only God the Lord Jesus Christ is his name Hallelujah but don't fear John Don't Fear The Clock all that I am you are an air to all my power is yours my liance is yours and I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but I come to bring love and courage and ability and all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and I perform it this is my Covenant and it will never fail said it will never fail it will never fail this word has never [Applause] [Music] failed what we know about about a pardon the price can be paid you can have a note signed by the president if you was facing death and the the president signed a signature and says your pardon you can take that note and throw it in trash and still go and die right so what happened there with Lincoln I know the story and brother Brown tells about pardon he came and he his friend came to plead his cause and he went and he and he took he got before the president he cried out to him the president's heart would moved wrote just a simple note says so and so is pardon President Abraham linol gives it to the man the man goes running to the prison you're free I've got a note that says you're free it's over with he looked at that note it wasn't on no legal paper it was just written by the handwriting of Abraham lol it was too simple for him wasn't Grand enough it wasn't great enough and he turned it down he walked out to a firing squad and died they would judge the case and they came back and said a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a Parton that's right we can get up here and preach all the all this said God has released you from your guilt God has released you from your shame God will forgive you of your sins but unless you accept it he's taking my case not just brother Ben brother Matt Brother David brother Wayne one of these other men of God what sister no but he took mine and he wrote it in his own blood forgiven it is finished Jesus Christ you have the right to accept that and walk out of that prison C is you can be released from guilt tonight you can be released from your shame you can be released from your prison I don't know what kind of prison you find yourself in but if you'll just take the pardon you can walk out you can walk out but it's not a pardon unless you accept it as a pardon he's taken your case he's ple pled the blood of Jesus he shed it for you so that you can walk free yes you can walk in joy you can walk in peace you can walk in happiness you can walk in Mercy you can walk in Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound to Sav a wret like me you can you can walk out of that mind battle you can walk out of that unworthiness you walk out of that [Music] guilt [Music] yeah you walk out of those chains you cannot be held by Broken [Music] chains Hallelujah I know God didn't do this for no reason he didn't change my mind my heart just about an hour and a half ago before service started start from scratch put a little thought together for nothing he knew somebody's in a prison and they need to hear one more time you're free they need to hear it again free you don't have to stay there no longer maybe you can take it like Peter did and he's in that jail cell an angel appeared slapped him on the side said arise and walk out so some of you need to walk out [Music] tonight I believe You' be all right you just get out of your seat and walk out of just walking up here to the front here just walk out the devil I'm walking out of

building God my case said he knew you was going to be here he knew who was going to be SP he knew what they'd have to say why because it isn't man it's God and he's working with his people but is it wonderful that he would stand on our behalf he took our case you know I thought brother Timothy he was speaking on that thought how that when a man goes into trial he said but we have a judge and a jury or a judge and an attorney that would stand for us you know what happens when a case gets dismissed but the Tom first the prosecutor comes up and he said this is all the charges against them but then it comes time for the defense to defend and it's my favorite part of a of a good trial is when that attorney for the defense stands up and he says judge I plead that we don't even have to put up a defense he said I plead that the prosecutor has not met their burden see we come many times we have a burden we're the one feels like we're under pressure and we're the one who feels like we have we have to have a we have to to meet the burden to prove that we're saved and prove we're going to make a Rapture and prove that we're okay and prove that we're filled with the Holy Ghost but the case isn't on you the case is on the prosecutor see you're automatically free you were free when you went into court you're free when you when the case started you you came there free but they have to meet the burden to make you guilty we don't have to meet a burden to to make us free you already free you were born free God set us free he made us free by the blood of Jesus Christ and I plead tonight our brother said when the evidence was presented the prosecutor has not met the burden he didn't meet the burden to put enough evidence to make you guilty you're still free isn't it wonderful to be be free tonight want somebody give the Lord [Music] a the sisters can play this song it's my favorite song I think but maybe we just asked this question what do you think about Jesus amen he's all right
