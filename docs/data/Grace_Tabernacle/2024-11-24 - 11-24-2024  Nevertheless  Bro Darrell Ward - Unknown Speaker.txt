a book about a man named Jesus it's been my desire to be like him other men mayy to imitate other men but to me I just I want my wife to see Jesus I want my children to see Jesus ain't that your desire you know the the the flood over in North Carolina and upper east Tennessee there and just the devastation our church has been taking supplies across the mountain to the people up there and just to see the the the damage and but we always pray before we leave that the Lord will allow us to be his hands and his feet and I told the brothers I said you know there's more ways to show Jesus than standing behind a pull pit amen I want to show him at [Music] Walmart amen may the Lord bless you richly well it's Thanksgiving again it's always a time to be thankful I was talking to brother and sister sawer over North Carolina last weekend said y'all going to be down in Arkansas and said oh yeah daddy wants all the grandkids Under One Roof you know for it's just something about gathering in to be with family and count our blessings and we count it an honor to be here and so happy that my wife was able to come and be with us we just appreciate it it's good to see everyone of you again so we better preach before we cry if you got your Bible turn with us to the Book of Luke we want to read from Luke Chapter 5 starting at verse one and just count it an honor to be with you once again and I know there's some good food over there so I promise I won't keep you long so I'll preach fast you amen fast and we'll get amen I got one amen already that's good amen we just count of a real honor to be here and just trust something to be said to help you and encourage you Luke Chapter 5 starting at verse one the Bible says this and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God that he stood by the lake of G ganzar and he saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of of the ship now when he was left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a DRT for a pool and Simon answered and said unto him Master we have told all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and when they had done when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude the fishes and their net break and they beckoned under their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both ships so that they began to sink now that's a fishing trip right there and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the DRT of the fishes which which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said un Salon fear not from hence forth Thou shalt catch men Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to speak to you for just a a few minutes this morning on nevertheless nevertheless Heavenly Father we just bow in your wonderful presence today Lord and from the depths of our heart we want to tell you just how much you mean to us for Lord while we were yet sinners you died for us and Lord As We Gather here this Thanksgiving weekend with family and friends we pray oh God that your presence would be felt Among Us Lord that our sick would be healed and our weak would be made strong and Lord those that would maybe be weary or kind of down may they be lifted up Lord to see that every promise of your word is still true time and situations and doctor's reports does not change the word of God so Lord we look to you this morning the author and finisher of our faith may you come Lord and take this this feeble effort Lord and break it to the hearts of your children that they may rise up dear God and realize that which you've already done for them Lord bless brother Matt the officers of the church Lord the ministry here may you use them in a great way Lord may you shake this community once more with the power of the revelation of your word dear God that we may find that last seed for Lord you said when that last one is called you will close the book your Prophet said and you will call for your bride Lord we realize that the world is threatening World War III and all that Putin over and Russia is claiming that he's going to do but father God we have this confidence this morning that the prophet said if they pushed that button before the bomb ever hit the US this little bride would be gone oh Lord that we don't look to Russia or the United States we Look to You Lord knowing that we are safely under your wings we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory for we ask them in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you you may be seated this morning now the prophet of God said this he says perfect Faith Masters all circumstances oh but brother Daryl you don't know my circumstan that's not what he said perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it now just watch when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is that don't have one thing to do with it see Faith Masters that circumstance when you believe anything or do do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing you see if you come here this morning with this attitude well you know I'm not going to get involved I'm just going to come and see what's happening and and I really just come you know to get something to eat after church if that's all you come to do just to be a spectator you won't get very much you might leave with a belly full of food but that's about all you'll leave with but if you can come this morning believing that we are God's chosen people come on Hallelujah if you come believing this morning I was born for a purpose I was not put here by mistake we could come this morning and say I have come here not to be a spectator but to be a participator I have come to declare war on Satan and upon his kingdom and I've come to get back what he stole for me he's tried to take my joy he's tried to take my health he's tried to C my family but I have come this morning not as a not as a as a want to be but I come as a chosen soldier of God placed in this Army before the foundation of the world to fight my enemy and not only fight my eny but to have victory over Satan Hallelujah Satan is a defeated foe amen hallelujah and we need to come with that attitude amen we need to come to receive every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ gave me we need to come through those doors not wondering what's going to happen but we need to come through those doors knowing we are what's happening Hallelujah there is not another we are the Church of today and if there's a tomorrow we're the Church of Tomorrow amen this ain't the first church age this is the last Church age and the next thing the church receives is the rapture that's where we're at in time this is our day our time our season this is brid likee time it's the evening light this is the evening listen to me evening light is just not a name of a message Church no sir the E will you say what is the evening light it's you you are the evening light little while the world shall see me no more but ye shall see me Jesus said I'm the light of the world then he said you're the light of the world amen Amen Brother on hallelujah amen it's not just the name of a church it's you amen we were born for a purpose we didn't Stager into this thing we believe that God is still in control and he has a plan for our lives he has a plan for everyone of our you see Faith believes God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but the most wonderful thing is I don't have to know how he's going to do it I just have to believe he's going to do it you see if you know how he's going to do it that's not Faith that's knowledge and we do not serve God by knowledge we serve God by faith amen you can read the Bible and still not know God come on somebody but to know him is by faith Faith amen hallelujah amen amen Faith believes God a working out on how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it Masters all circumstances then no matter what the circumstance is that don't have nothing to do with it well the doctor says it's bad the situation is impossible circumstances has nothing to do with it you see faith is not a Hocus Pocus s it's not some kind of magic wand that you wave over somebody faith is not even what you feel because your feelings can lie to you faith is not what you feel it's what you believe and faith has to have a resting place and the resting place for faith is the word of God Amen it is the foundation that Faith rest upon the Bible says God said let my word be true let every man's word be a lie right come on amen he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail you see when you hear what the word is saying to you it must be a personal revelation well my daddy told me that's not good enough well my you've got to know him for yourself amen that's right amen you can't serve God cuz your parents love him you've got to serve God because you love him amen and when you hear what the word is saying to you then you realize he's talking to me amen I think of Paul he was in a great storm 14 days in a storm and this storm was so great they wasn't even able to eat that must have been some kind of storm because you know how we like to eat but they couldn't even eat but in the midst of a two weak hurricane Paul said be of good cheer I ain't eight and 14 days and you're telling me to be happy be of good cheer for I believe it'll even be as God hath said for there stood by me he said there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship only for there stood by me this night an angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul for th must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee right in the midst of the greatest storm of their life Paul said to be happy how could you be happy in such a storm because Paul had a promise from God Amen that no matter how bad the storm was there would be no loss of life amen Paul said be happy it will be as God hath said amen oh my said how I love him God keeps his word he'll keep his word every time not 99 times out of a 100 but 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his word now think of it if the Lord Jesus healed one person he can heal all persons is that not true if he can heal cancer the skin he can heal cancer of the liver amen if God delivered one person he can deliver all people if he can send one particle son home he can send all particle Sons home well my situation don't look at the situation look at the God who made the promise [Applause] amen the only thing you have to know is this is to believe his presence is here amen to believe that he is here to help you if you can believe he's here to help you you can get help well I don't know I don't I I I don't know if I can believe that or not doubt will keep him away from you he'll never come to your door if you're doubting him but if you believe him the prophet said he will come any time he's called for him to come oh my amen if you're believing and accept it then he can help help you you see the ABCs of your healing the ABCs of your deliverance the ABCs of your restoration is accept it believe it and confess it amen not one place did he say feel it accept it believe it and confess it and God can only bless you as you confess that he's done it for you he's the high priest of our conf confession is that right Hebrews 3 said he's the high priest of our confession confession now they're just being let me give you just a little bit of instruction he said that that it may be easy to stick you might come here and be prayed for you might even have Angels lay hands on you now you talk about a service if angels come down this morning and stood at this Altar and laid hands on you they'd be talking about it for years but the prophet said you might come here and be prayed for you might even have angels to lay hands on you and it'll never do one thing to you that's right until first you believe it and accept it and confess it think about that for a minute but you see we always it's what we see with our eye but God don't want us to look with the eyes of our head he wants us to look with the eyes of our heart amen for the eyes of the heart sees what the eyes of the head cannot see that's right brother Oh Glory to God he's the Risen high priest of our confession we've got to confess it first before he can witness it before God for he's the high priest there to make intercession Upon Our confession of what he has done for us if you could do that this morning I tell you you will see Miracles you will see Giants fall you will see Revival amen if we can take God at his word and begin to confess what God Said has already been done hallelujah amen what did the angel of the Lord tell brother brandom if you can get the people to believe nothing shall stand in your way not even ccer amen it said the said I trust now that you'll do that each one of you will be Reverend and Believe on him with all your heart then we come with this understanding the prophet said he saved you when he died he saved you and he healed you when he died for he took your place but now all you have to do is accept it by faith and you'll receive it there's nothing more to be done your healing has already been paid four your salvation has already been your joy your Victory your peace come on somebody everything that God promised has already been paid for here not long ago me and Cheryl Jessica was at a restaurant and this waitress come by and she said now will there be anything else and I said no ma'am just a check she said well somebody saw you in here and paid for your meal I said really she said yes I said well let me leave the tip no no no the tip has already been took care of too everything has already been paid for so if there's nothing else you can leave think about that now I could have said ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know are you sure you're talking about me maybe it's somebody else are you I don't see nobody maybe you're mistaken maybe you got the wrong person maybe you want me to go out that door and you're going to and that Bell's going to go ding ding ding ding ding and they're going to say he sto a steak maybe you're trying to trick me I could have said all of that I could have argued with her I could have debated with her I could have doubted it was me or I could have accepted it and I could have said whoever done that for me I want to thank you and I could walk out that door with a belly full of steak paid for by someone else and if I could do that for us all Hallelujah if I could do that for a steak dinner you can do that today for any promise that God has given you it's already been paid for you don't have to argue about it you don't have to debate about it you can get up and walk out that door free Hallelujah cuz it's already been paid for hallelujah amen you can have it amen you can have it it's your right the very minute that you believe it you can it that's when your faith meets God's requirement to believe that Christ died for your sickness when he died for your sins he died for your sins at Calvary he accepted upon the basis and at that moment you are healed in the sight of God then you go on testifying of it believing it you testify of the things you do not see faith is the substance of things hope for and the evidence of things you do not see and we look to the unse Unseen because you see when God says anything he means just what he said you know somebody come to me one time about brother Bram and said every word that come out of brother brenham's mouth was thus sayith the Lord and I said well I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer but let me ask you something if everything brother benam said was thus sayth the Lord why did he have to say thus sayth the Lord he was saying thus sayith the Lord to tell you this ain't me this is the Lord and if the man tells you thus said the Lord and it don't come to pass that man lied to you because God does not lie come on somebody if God says it God will do it amen Abraham looked at him and said I know he's able to do that what he promised to do I'm a hundred year old Sarah's 90s something year old but if God said he'll do it he'll do it he promised it amen time don't matter if it takes 25 seconds 25 months or 25 years if God said he will do it he will do it Abraham waited 25 years we can't wait 25 seconds well I got prayed for and nothing happened that ain't the faith of Abraham Abraham believed God for 25 years how many times did they laugh at him when Sarah was was was knitting out those booties for the baby am man I said you guys have lost your mind they did lose their mind Hallelujah they got the mind of God Amen Let the doctor look at me like I'm crazy when I tell him I'm already healed let them say what they want to say but my God will back up his word I remember how they looked at me when I told him Jessica would see again and they said there's no way she could see again and even people told me they thought I'd had a nervous breakdown and had lost my mind but let me tell you I wasn't looking at the MRI I wasn't looking at the CT scan I was looking at what God Said in his doctor report Hallelujah I opened the eyes of the Blind and I make the lame walk that's what my God [Applause] said yes sir Hallelujah but you see brother Mark the outside world wants you to believe as soon as you lay hands on that crippled arm it's supposed to straighten out come on well it's wonderful if it does but you see God never promised that he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but he never said when well glory amen the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God will raise them up sir but he never said when he said when you pray believe you receive it and it shall be given to you but he never said when he just said Do You Believe Me amen people look for the healing of the body to be so complicated and yet it's so very simple just take God and His word just say the same thing he does why didn't get too many amens out of that but I don't know why that's so hard to do we sure do it for the doctor yes sir the doctor's office we'll get on our phone well honey I just come from the doctor and the doctor said you'll tell them every time what the doctor said well the doctor said and the doctor said and the doctor said well if we can do that for the doctor and he can be wrong why can't we do it for Jesus who's never wrong Hallelujah let's start saying what God said about it God said I'm Healed God said I'm delivered God said I'm an overcomer God said I'm predestinated let me say what God Said Hallelujah if you start saying what God Said your body will obey your [Applause] confession we live in such a Negative age you get around people are so negative it's time we be positive we don't serve a negative God we serve a positive God amen amen by stri I'm Healed that settles it yes sir what God Said Amen well I know somebody belied that and they died that don't change anything when I was in the Army we had I think if I remember right it's been a long time we had 11 General Orders that we followed orders like if you pass an officer you salute them it's just general orders that's what you did as a soldier you had these orders that you obeyed as a soldier but then there come a direct order and a direct order from headquarters supersedes all general orders so like for example a general is you salute an officer but in combat you don't salute an officer because if you salute Mark and he's a lieutenant there's a sniper waiting to take his head off because he's a leader so you don't let the enemy know who the leaders are so you don't salute in combat that's a direct order so our general orders is lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's a general order but sometimes it comes from headquarters a direct order that's my time I'm taking her home I'm taking him home it's not because we fail it's not because God fail it's because God gave a direct order it's time for my child to come home Hallelujah and the prophet said if I pray for a thousand and a thousand die I'll get up the next day and preach Divine Healing because God Is A Healer amen amen is that all right amen by Stripes some heel that settles it now we find Jesus come to Simon and the Peter and his the boats the boats were all empty no fish now you talk about discouragement cuz they needed that fish to pay their taxes sell the fish to pay the tax they needed the fish and they had fished all night long and caught nothing sounds like some of my hunting trips and Jesus said Jesus said take me out a little that I might speak the word of God now notice they fished all night long and caught nothing they were discouraged but listen to me when things don't work out the way you think they should don't get discouraged maybe it's happening for a reason for a purpose maybe God is fixing to show you just how great he Isen brother remember remember every Miracle begins with a problem you see we want Miracles but we don't want no problems right but you can't have a miracle unless you got a problem and think of this if Peter's boat had been full of fish there'd been no room for Jesus on and you know think about it if our boats if our lives are so full of the things of the world there's no room for Jesus but let's empty out of our vessels of meaningless things that we spend so much time looking at that turkey is going to be real good in just a few minutes but if we can empty oursel of things that you know we'll spend hours of wasted time but if we get empty out of meaningless things and he could fill our boats with himself and Jesus said take me out to the deep that I might speak now listen he'll never borrow something from you but what he won't repay you for it and could it be the very reason that the fishing was so bad because Jesus was going to use the boat the next day come on now think about I I wrote this down I thought wow think about this what started out as the worst fishing trip ended up being sto talked about that thousands of years later we're still talking about that fishing trip what think one that started out so I ain't call one minute and thousands of years later we're still talking about this fishing trip you see weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and when Jesus was through speaking he said take me a little further in the deep and cast down your nets now look he wasn't giving them an empty promise he knew what was fixing to happen all he wanted them to do was to believe what he was saying take now a little bit further and let down your nets to a place they had just fished through a little bit ago and he said cast down your nets for a pull now that was just as much the word of God as God saying let there be light and Peter and him was experienced fishermen they knew how to fish they been all night long and had caught nothing they even used that big what's that worm called there she was talking about last night that big old long worm South African special They even used that one didn't get nothing that that Buzz bait with the little whatever you know but they they knew the ins and outs sufficient on and Peter said Lord we've told all not long there's nothing there we've done all we know to do but when you've done all you know to do that ain't the time to quit that's the time to stand you see there's only two roads before you that's either Faith or unbelief and you're controlled by one or the other you're going to take one road or you're going to take the other Road Jesus was saying let down the net now Peter was wept with this choice of obeying the word or leaning on his own understanding as a fisherman come on and every one of us this morning is left with this choice you see the net is in your hand it was in his hand what are you going to do Peter let that it was in his hand and I'm telling you the net is in your hand you're going to hold on to your understanding you're going to hold on to your problems or you going to take God at his word you know the situation may look bad the problem may be great but nevertheless Lord I'm letting down the net because you said so amen not because of what I feel but because of what you said now Prophet said maybe you've been to every doctor in the city maybe you've come through every clinic and every doctor's office maybe the man with honesty has examin you and said I don't know what's wrong with you or maybe he's found what's wrong with you and say it's not a medical rim to cure you there's nothing in the world that can be done for you and maybe you've seen through all that and you went through all the prayer lines and you done everything you know to do and you're still sick and you're still getting worse why don't you do like Peter and say Lord I don't know how it's going to happen but at Thy word Lord I'm going to let down the net I'm going to let down and believe with all my heart that you're going to heal me today amen the prophet said if you'll do that you'll go away from here a well person at Thy word Lord I'm going to let down the net It seems impossible to the human eye It seems impossible as my experience as a fisherman but nevertheless at Thy word I'm going to let down the net and the prophet said that's it that pulsating of the word Peter looked to the Unseen he took God at his word all my expertise as a fisherman I told right through this spot no more than three hours ago there's no fish here the wind's in the wrong direction it's the wrong time of day every scientific reason says it won't work but nevertheless but nevertheless Lord you see if taking God at his word produce fish yeah then taking God at his word will produce healing it'll produce Joy it'll produce peace it'll produce Victory it'll produce Deliverance taking the word of God over every circumstance will produce what God said it will produce that's right he said let down the net if you let if you if he said let down the net he'll put the fish there brother if the doctor says you can't get well and the word of God says you can be well and God can put anything he can put new cells he can put new eyes he can put new eardrums whatever it is he can put it there come on let me hurry listen I was in St Carlos the patan reservation several years ago and as a sister she's an older sister but she was a young girl when brother Brenham came there in the 50s and out there you know now there's houses and stuff but there where the church is me and Brother David Syler preached there a few years ago and right there where the church is they used to it was just a field and she said all the Indians laid their blankets out here in this field and they were sitting on the blankets and she said I was a young girl so I got up close to the front cuz I wanted to see and she said the fourth person that came through the prayer line was a little Apache girl who was deaf and dumb had never spoke a word in her life and she said brother Brandon was using this female interpreter because she was the only one that understood good English so he was using her to talk to these Apaches because at that time most of them didn't even speak English and so brother Ben prayed for this death and dumb girl who never spoke a word in her life brother and when it got done he told The Interpreter to tell her to speak and so she started talking for the first time in her life she started talking and the prophet turned to The Interpreter said now she'll talk better later yeah good and The Interpreter said her talk keep good now because you see she wasn't speaking English she was speaking Apache you know why she was speaking if anybody's ever heard the Apache language it all runs together you can't hardly separate one word from the other and she began to speak the first words in her life was not French it wasn't Spanish it wasn't English it was Apache you know why she was aach hallelujah hallelujah if God can put aache language in the mouth of a child who never spoke a word in her life what can he do for you today Hallelujah her first word she ever spoke was Apache because that's what she was I told those Apache indans I said listen to me Jesus never died to make everybody white he died to make everybody saved can I get a Hallelujah you see his word will not return unto him void I am the Lord that Health how many how many all thy diseases Peter said Lord I've told all not I've taken nothing it's that's discouraging we're fishermen they wasn't guessing they know sir they knew the sea they knew the fish they knew where the fish were at when the moon was in a certain place they knew all of that they were raised on the Seas of the Galilee they T all night through these Waters the same water and had taken nothing but in the midst of all of his experience Peter said at Thy word Lord I'll let down the dead there's the secret the prophet maybe you've seen through every doctor's office there is in the country you might have been through prayer lines you might have had pastors praying you might have have consecrated Christians to pray you might have tried everything that you know how to do but this morning say at Thy word Lord I'm going to let down the net right now I'm going to stop trying anything see lot of times that's the problem we get in God's way because we try to do it you see God don't need my ability God don't need my education thank God he don't need my bank account thank God all God needs is my skin on pre amen I'm going to stop asking for healing and start accepting it you see if you keep asking for it what you're really saying is I don't have it yet but if you start accepting it what you're really saying is I've already got it You' have heard the story of Christina over in Romania I know I think I've told it here before was born without a hip and she came up for prayer and I told her she you know what sister you I quit asking God for my healing and I'd start accepting it I said i' just go everywhere testifying you're in church service stand up testify thank God for healing you three years went by three years went by and I get an email from this girl didn't even know her name she said this is Christina you met me in romanda you prayed for me and she said brother I did what I what you told me to do said I went everywhere testifying said even my friends begin to make fun of me because I was testifying of being healed and I still crippled she was on the crutch and every time her leg would just swing like this she'd stop walking she'd have to take her hand and catch her leg cuz she was born without a hip and she Saidi want to be a wife I want to have children said who would marry me like this I want the Lord first of all she came and gave her heart to the Lord then she came back to the next night and wanted to be healed and I said just instead of asking just accept it start testifying everywhere you go and I got this email said brother this is Christina from Romania said I did what you told me to do said I went everywhere testifying said even my friends begin to make fun of me but I never stopped I kept testify she said brother I was in church and I stood up and said I want to testify of my healing said I heard one of my friends say here she goes again and she said when I said I want to thank God for healing me she said brother Daryl my hip popped she said I laid the church down I laid the crutch there and I walked out of I was up at the byc a few years and a man come up to me he said I'm brother so and so from Romania he said do you know about Christina I said oh my I said isn't it wonderful what the Lord did for her he said brother I was in that service he said I watched her leg grow out that's the God we serve I was in Cottonwood Arizona and a woman had a tumor on her breast and I was just sharing some of the things I seen the Lord do I said I had nothing to do with it I was just there when it happened I was just a witness to it and she began to praise God never came up for prayer never done nothing had this tor on her chest and she goes home takes off her blouse to put some kind of ointment on this tumor and when she took off the blouse and looked in the mirror the tumor was gone it disappeared during the service that's the God we serve that's the god that can do exceedingly and above all that we can ever hope for there is nothing that my God can't [Applause] do Peter said I'm going to believe you Lord right now I'm going to take you at your word I'm going to let down the net and that same God lives this morning he does the same thing hallelujah it's the same nature of God Peter walked on the water because the word said to do it come away and away he went Mary didn't know how the Virgin was conceive but she took God at his word and produced Christ the word Moses with a stick in his hand how is he going to take over a nation with the stick but he took God at his word and whoop the greatest army of the world knew at that time by taking God at his word an 80y old man with a beard swinging off of his knee with a stick in his hand going to Egypt to take over that's so silly you can't even amen it and yet God do it amen Prophet talked about the eagle in the blow down he said he said I I pr prais the Lord said that eagle you know said that squirrel begin to chatter CH looked over said there was that eagle said I told that eagle said do you know I can shoot you before you get ever get off the ground said I can shoot you said that eagle wasn't paying no attention to me said just sitting there just testing those wings just testing those wings he said he knew before I'd ever get my gun he'd be gone you know what he was trusting in he was trusting in what God made him the eagle trusted in what God made him he knew he could get off the ground before the prophet could ever get his gun because that's the genetics of what God made him amen and if an eagle can trust in what God made him can you and I this morning trust in what God has made us he's made us Overcomers he's made us the bride of Christ he's Hallelujah he's made us Sons and Daughters of God he's made us Believers and Believers believe because that's what believers do can we take confidence this morning that this message will produce a body change what do you think Satan's attacking it like he is you see the devil attacking the Catholic Church why do you think he's attacking this message like he does if you don't know where the battle is see where the front line is amen at that word oh Lord no we fish through all the waters an hour before hour after hour all night long we've taken not one fish fish yeah how in the world are we going to drop down those Nets and get a whole bunch of fish they're just not running it doesn't even look reasonable it doesn't even look sensible but nevertheless reasoning would have you to say we've done done that reason would have you to say there's no fish there you see reason would have kept BL barname sitting on that rock that fell off the wall of Jericho when Jesus stopped from called for him to come reasen would have said you're blind that's right reason would have said you don't know where he's at Reon would have said there's so many people between you and him reason would have said how can you trust the people who said that take you to him it would be better for you to just to sit right here and don't get excited reason when would have kept Peter in the boat when Jesus B him to come during that great storm all those friends with him said Peter you know the best place to be in this storm is right here in this boat and you're going to do what you're going to step out of this boat reasoning would have kept him in the boat that's the safest place to be in a storm is in the boat certainly not out in the water but you see if Jesus is calling for you to come the Way's already provided for you to get there Hallelujah and God told him to let down the neck in the same water that fish all not in but now let down the net and get ready for the pull of fish that you're going to take this time we're going to do it at his word and not our ability there's the secret can I have just a few more minutes Peter said I know there's no fish there Lord but at Thy word nevertheless nevertheless at Thy word Lord I'm not looking at the facts there's no fish I'm only looking at the word that says to let down the Nets thank you Lord hallelujah you see you obey the word when he obeyed the word he got the promise because if you obey the word you get the promise if you obey God's word his promise comes next let me say that again if you obey God's word his promise comes next he can't lie he's God that's right what does man what does any man more need than the promise of God and God said he would do it and I say to you tonight this morning rer I say to you just let down the net amen take him at his word he is my healer he's my deliverer he's my sustainer he's my peace he's my joy it's already done it's already done the battle is over the victory is won it's all ready you said brother Daryl I've cast my net over and over and over I've done everything I know to do and that boy's getting worse and that girl's getting more crazier that tumor is getting bigger but now I tell you friends don't look at what you can do look at what the word says to do like that girl in Alaska and I I know I told you this before but it just stands out in my heart just a young girl 21 year old she came up for prayer she said I'm an alcoholic I've been through the 12 step I've been through the nstep program 12 different times is what she said the nin step program of alcoholism said I've been through it and I'm still cannot quit drinking I have tried everything to quit drinking she Saidi woke up and found my places places I didn't even know where I was because I was drunk I got a little child I don't know who the daddy is because I was conceived while I was drunk I've tried everything and I cannot quit drinking and I said sis have you tried Jesus I said you just lay the alcohol right down here you just lay it at the altar and take his freedom and go out that door free for whom the son has made free is free and and I begin to pray for that girl as long as I live I'll never forget it she begin to scream at the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free and I was up there a couple of year ago she came up to me she said brother Daryl it's been two years Lord and I'm still sober what the alcohol program couldn't do our God could that's what we need it's faith our faith to take action it's not enough to say I believe it we must act on it you must accept it believe it and confess it how do we know Noah believed God when he said it was going to rain how do we know Noah believed God because he built the boat before the rain ever fa how do we know Joshua belied God when he said March around the wall blow a trumpet shout the walls going to fall down because they shouted the victory before the wall ever come down and how do we know we believe God when we begin to act like we're healed while the symptom is still [Applause] there and if you can believe that this promise is for you then you can start right now shouting because it's already done Lord I believe I believe I believe what you said to me you see Faith jumps and leaves no matter where he is he's bid me to come I'm going there you are oh my that's it right there he's bid me to come I must do what the word says to do as we come to a close give your faith a chance turn it loose unbridle it let it work youve got it all bound with tradition I have to feel a certain thing I have to get a goosebump nonsense you get a goosebump from the air conditioner just cut all of it Loose let God have his way don't we sing a song like that let go and let God have his wonderful way somebody's word is right either yours either the doctor's or what God Said and the only way your word can be right if you're saying what he said that's right because God's word is true Peter cast down the net and got fish blind barnas cast off his robe and got his eyesight and I say to you step out this morning amen and claim your promise when David stooped before that Brook that day and that big giant 9' n in tall 14inch fingers you talking about a hand that man could slap you his hand was so big he could slap you on one side of the face and the fingers go all the way around and slap you on the other you walk up somebody both cheeks red they say goli slapped you how do you know he slapped me before I recognize them red finger marks 14inch fingers 9 foot n in tall and David was just a boy I think some some Scholars estimate between 14 15 year old just a boy but he stooped there at that Brook that day and he picked up five smooth stones but let me say in closing he never picked up five smooth stones in case he missed four times he picked up five smooth Stones because Goliath had four brothers and David said I'll just kill them [Music] all oh saints of God saints of God recognize who you are Lord I've got this problem I've got this situation I don't even know what to do but nevertheless I ain't going to worry about it I ain't going to fret over it I'm simply going to let down the net take you at your word oh David's up today take that stone stone is a confession how many of those that stone is a confession take your stone take your conf confession place it in the sling of faith and slay that giant that stands before you you see if Goliath had saw the god that stood behind David he would have never made that challenge but all David saw was a boy but all David saw was a defeated giant do you love him today let us bow our heads amen I trust I've not kept you long hallelujah hallelujah why would I worry when Giants come calling my name my God is so much bigger in troubles I face and why would I hunger for power or riches or fame oh my God is so much better than all of these things so I won't be shaken I won't be Hallelujah my God is faithful his promises true so I'll speak speak to the mountain tell them it's time to [Music] move cuz my God is bigger better stronger greater than you my enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is done oh my God is strong the victories already won yes he died for my ROM and Rose up on the third day C my God is greater than death hell and the grave so I won't be [Music] shaken I won't be [Music] my God is faithful his promises true so I'll speak to the mountain tell them it's time to do cuz my God
