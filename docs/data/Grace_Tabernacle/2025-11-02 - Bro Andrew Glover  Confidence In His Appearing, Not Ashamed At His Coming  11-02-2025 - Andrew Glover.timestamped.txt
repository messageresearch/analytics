[42:36] Amen. Won't somebody praise the Lord

[42:41] Amen. I'm worthy. Amen. Amen. You just
[42:44] go ahead and let him know how much you
[42:46] love him. You know what it is? It's the
[42:48] sound of the revival of the bride of
[42:50] Jesus Christ. Friends, I got news for
[42:52] you. There ain't nothing the devil can
[42:54] do to stop [music] that. You know why?
[42:56] Because we're living in the age of
[42:58] revealed truth. And our revival, it
[43:00] don't [music] come from a song. It don't
[43:02] come from a uh from music. It comes from
[43:04] a revelation of the word of God. And
[43:06] Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will
[43:08] build my church, and the gates of hell
[43:10] shall not prevail against it." You know
[43:12] what that shows us? It shows us that the
[43:14] gates of hell will be against it, but it
[43:16] shall not prevail. That's why a prophet
[43:18] of God would say, "You cannot stop this
[43:20] revival." So, anything that you don't
[43:23] put your hand to it because there ain't
[43:24] nothing you put to it will ever prevail.
[43:26] But anything that comes against the
[43:28] revival of the bride of Jesus Christ
[43:29] will come to nothing because the revival
[43:32] shall prevail.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't somebody give the Lord a
[43:36] hand clap of praise this morning? I
[43:38] believe we got a right to worship God.
[43:40] Amen. We got a right to praise God
[43:42] because we come in a revival that was
[43:44] sent to the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:47] We're worshiping in the bride's revival.
[43:49] I say God is good this morning. Amen.
[43:52] What a privilege it is to be in the
[43:54] house of God. And my just a just a
[43:57] wonderful opportunity to come and just
[44:00] to worship God once again. Amen. you
[44:03] love the Lord this morning. Amen. We
[44:05] just want to say God bless you. This
[44:07] morning, Brother Andrew will be speaking
[44:09] for us and I want to thank all of the
[44:11] church for their prayers for uh Jordan
[44:14] and and little baby Clarabel. And she

[44:47] to trying to get a room there close so
[44:49] she can go back in and see her. So, um
[44:52] she was a little bit [music] small, but
[44:55] she's she's she's breathing and doing
[44:57] good. So, and I heard one of the nurses
[45:00] say she was the prettiest baby ever born
[45:02] there. I I kind of overheard it. So, I
[45:06] don't know if that's true, but [music]
[45:08] but I, you know, I was eavesdropping a
[45:12] little.

[51:44] weren't going to use it no more. It was
[51:46] just scrap to them. And he said they
[51:48] come along and somebody picked it up.
[51:49] And he said now they begin to bid on it.
[51:51] And when they started bidding they said
[51:53] who'll give me I think five cents and 10
[51:55] cents. And [music] he said but then
[51:56] somebody went over and picked it up that
[51:58] knew how to play it. And he said they
[52:00] started strumming it and tuning it up
[52:02] and rosed up the bow. And he said now he
[52:04] said then they auctioned it again and
[52:06] they said who'll give me a thousand and
[52:07] 2,000. And see the music was always in
[52:10] it. It just needed the touch of a
[52:12] master. Amen. I'll tell you this morning
[52:14] the grace of God and the seed of God is
[52:16] already in your heart this morning. The

[53:50] Matt was standing there in the back in
[53:51] front of me and I just couldn't help but
[53:53] think to see the grace of God, what the
[53:55] Lord has used the gift of God in his
[53:56] life to establish here and build. And
[53:58] I'm honored to be a part of it and to
[54:00] put my shoulder to the wheel and and
[54:02] then to see the cause of Christ go
[54:04] forward. And this morning before we open
[54:06] the word of the Lord, it's such a such a
[54:08] warm atmosphere. Let's just speak to our
[54:10] Lord this morning. We've only got one
[54:12] service today. We're not in a hurry.
[54:14] We've come here to worship the Lord and
[54:15] to hear his word and to enjoy his
[54:18] presence. Let's just ask him to come and
[54:19] speak to us this morning. Heavenly
[54:21] Father, Lord, as your believers have
[54:23] gathered here on this beautiful Sunday
[54:25] morning that you've given us, Father,
[54:27] Lord, we're so thankful that you woke us
[54:29] up this morning with a mind to serve
[54:30] you, dear God. Lord, with a heart, Lord,
[54:33] of thanksgiving for the things that
[54:35] you've done, the graces that you've
[54:36] given unto our lives. Father, we don't
[54:39] want to be like those lepers this
[54:41] morning that come into your presence.
[54:42] And Lord, you touched them, Father, and
[54:44] you cleansed them and you cured them of
[54:46] their leprosy. And Lord, they went right
[54:48] back into their life and took off from
[54:50] you. But there was only one out of the
[54:52] 10, Lord, that returned. Father, let us
[54:55] be like that one this morning, oh God,
[54:57] that Lord, you've done so much for us.
[54:59] You've brought us such a mighty long
[55:01] way. And Lord, you brought us through
[55:03] situations that when we looked at it,
[55:05] Father, Lord, we were assured that this
[55:07] was our end. But oh God, you're rich in
[55:09] mercy. And Lord, you brought us through
[55:11] another situation, another trial,
[55:14] another circumstance. And for that this
[55:16] morning, dear God, we are grateful,
[55:18] Lord. Father, as we endeavor to look in
[55:20] your word this morning, I pray, Lord,
[55:22] that you would send the spirit of wisdom
[55:24] and revelation into the building,
[55:26] Father. Lord, may you bind the hand of
[55:28] Satan, dear God. May you may you loose
[55:31] the anointing that destroys the yoke of
[55:33] the enemy, Father. Lord, I pray if there
[55:36] be any sick among us this morning, I
[55:38] pray as your word goes forth, may
[55:40] healing take place in their bodies, oh
[55:42] God. Lord, if there be any bound this
[55:45] morning as your word would be
[55:46] ministered, Lord, Father, may it bring a
[55:48] great deliverance into that heart.
[55:50] Father, Lord, I pray for those that be
[55:52] at home this morning unable to be here,
[55:55] Lord, that'll hear this sermon. I pray
[55:56] the angel of God will pass by their
[55:58] rooms, Father. Lord, if they're in the
[56:00] hospitals, dear God, you will raise them
[56:02] up off of the sick bed. For Lord, you
[56:05] are mighty and you are powerful and
[56:07] you're able to do all things. And this
[56:09] morning, we surrender our hearts and our
[56:10] minds into your hands, Lord. asking you
[56:13] forgive us of our failures, Lord.
[56:15] Father, may this be more than just
[56:17] another Sunday morning service. But
[56:19] Lord, may it be a transformation in your
[56:21] presence. And we'll be sure to give thee
[56:23] all the praise, all the honor, and all
[56:26] the glory. For it is due unto thy holy
[56:28] name. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[56:30] we pray. And all the believers says,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." This morning, if you
[56:36] have your Bibles while you're standing
[56:38] with us today, we want to go to the book
[56:40] of St. John, the 15th chapter. the book
[56:42] of St. John the 15th chapter. Uh, sorry,
[56:45] St. John chapter 5. First, we're going
[56:47] to read St. John 5 and then St. John 15.
[56:50] Amen. You love the Lord. This morning,
[56:52] amen. St. John chapter 5 and verse
[56:55] number 37.
[56:58] St. John 15. And also we're going to
[56:59] read in 1 John 2. Amen. St. John 5 and
[57:03] verse 37. Jesus here speaking. He says,
[57:06] "And the Father himself
[57:09] which hath sent me hath borne witness of
[57:12] me. Ye have neither heard his voice at
[57:15] any time, nor seen his shape." Now watch
[57:19] in verse 38. "And ye have not his word
[57:23] abiding in you. For whom he hath sent,
[57:27] him you believe not." Ye have not his
[57:31] word abiding in you. for whom he hath
[57:34] sent him ye believe not. I want to look
[57:38] in St. John 15 and verse number seven. I
[57:42] want to pick up that word again in St.
[57:44] John 15 and verse number seven. John
[57:47] there in John 5 uses the word abide. And
[57:50] St. John 15:7, if he abide in me and my
[57:54] words abide in you, now I find myself in
[57:56] this verse. Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; If he abide in me and my words abide in
[58:00] you, ye shall ask what you will and it
[58:04] shall be done unto you.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Also in the book of 1 John chapter 2, 1
[58:09] John chapter 2 and verse number 24,
[58:14] 1 John chapter 2
[58:16] and verse 24. Again, here John is
[58:19] writing and he's speaking of abiding in
[58:21] Christ. And he says, 'Now let that
[58:23] therefore abide in you which ye have
[58:25] heard from the beginning. If that which
[58:28] you have heard from the beginning shall
[58:30] remain in you, ye also shall continue in
[58:33] the Son and in the Father. And this is
[58:36] the promise that he hath promised us,
[58:38] even eternal life. These things have I
[58:41] written unto you concerning them that
[58:43] seduce you. But the anointing which you
[58:46] have received of him abideth in you. And
[58:49] ye need not that any man teach you, but
[58:52] as the same anointing teach you of all
[58:54] things, and is truth, and is no lie. And
[58:58] even as it hath taught you, ye shall
[59:01] abide in him. And now little children
[59:04] abide in him that when he shall appear
[59:07] we may have confidence and not be
[59:10] ashamed before him at his coming. We ask
[59:14] Lord this morning to bless the reading
[59:15] of his word as you can have your seats
[59:17] here today. Amen. Uh from those
[59:19] scriptures this morning if I would if I
[59:21] would take a title here today. I want to
[59:23] speak to you on this. Confidence in his
[59:26] appearing not ashamed at his coming.
[59:29] Amen. confidence in his appearing, not
[59:32] ashamed that his coming. And I just want
[59:34] to for a few moments here to revisit a
[59:36] few quotes I spoke to you here recently
[59:38] on when I was speaking to you on
[59:40] spiritual confidence. In the sermon
[59:42] there, he that's in you 1963,
[59:44] he says, "What I'm trying to say is
[59:47] don't never lose your confidence. Don't
[59:50] let Satan tell you evil about me because
[59:53] there's much. But you keep that
[59:55] confidence because if you don't, then it
[59:58] won't happen. Don't look to me as a man.
[1:00:00] I am a man. I am full of mistakes. Amen.
[1:00:04] But look to what I'm saying about him.
[1:00:07] It's him. He is the one. Again, in the
[1:00:10] spirit of truth. I'm an old man now and
[1:00:12] can call the world to a standstill and
[1:00:14] ask him to put your finger on one thing
[1:00:18] that he ever told me in thus sayaith the
[1:00:20] Lord in the name of the Lord. But what
[1:00:22] was absolutely the truth and fact and
[1:00:25] come to pass out of the thousands times
[1:00:28] thousands of things. What I'm saying
[1:00:29] that for amen see is because I've put us
[1:00:33] all as volcanic dust. But it's the
[1:00:36] promise of God's word. Therefore I
[1:00:38] cannot have confidence in myself. You
[1:00:41] cannot have confidence in yourself. But
[1:00:43] together we can have confidence in what
[1:00:46] has taken over ourselves. The Holy
[1:00:49] Spirit has taken us over. then we must
[1:00:52] have confidence in that. And as we place
[1:00:54] our confidence in that, Amen. then the
[1:00:58] results come. So here, amen, we're
[1:01:00] placing our confidence in something.
[1:01:02] WE'RE NOT JUST THROWING IT out there.
[1:01:04] AMEN. BUT WE'RE PLACING IT IN SOMETHING.
[1:01:06] AND TO PLACE SOMETHING, it means to put
[1:01:09] it in a particular spot. It means to put
[1:01:11] importance on. It means to arrange, to
[1:01:14] position. Amen. to set carefully and
[1:01:17] deliberately in its proper location or
[1:01:20] order. Now, I can say this morning,
[1:01:22] AMEN, IF YOU HAVE FAITH and you HAVE
[1:01:24] CONFIDENCE, AMEN, AND brother Brandham
[1:01:26] said, I think it's come to a TIME THAT
[1:01:29] WE'VE GOT TO know how we stand. Amen. I
[1:01:32] THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS
[1:01:34] HOUR. AMEN. It's not that we've just
[1:01:36] made a stand. Amen. But we GOT TO KNOW
[1:01:39] HOW WE STAND. AMEN. AMEN. IT'S ONE THING
[1:01:41] TO STAND. AMEN. BUT IT'S ANOTHER thing
[1:01:44] to know how YOU STAND. AMEN. BECAUSE
[1:01:46] EVERY DEVIL IN HELL IS TRYING HIS BEST,
[1:01:49] AMEN, TO BACK YOU OFF OF YOUR STAND.
[1:01:52] AMEN. BUT IF YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A
[1:01:54] SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY BY THE WORD OF GOD,
[1:01:57] AMEN, THEN THERE'S NO DEVIL BIG ENOUGH,
[1:01:59] AMEN, TO BACK YOU OFF OF YOUR STAND. HE
[1:02:02] SAID, HOW can you do anything UNLESS YOU
[1:02:04] GOT FAITH IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING? AMEN.
[1:02:06] YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH. HE SAID, "AND
[1:02:09] THAT'S MY purpose of doing this here for
[1:02:11] the church is to give the believers,
[1:02:13] Amen, faith and confidence in what
[1:02:15] they're standing for, amen, because it
[1:02:18] is the word of the Lord." I want to go
[1:02:20] on record and say EVERYTHING THAT THIS
[1:02:23] CHURCH STANDS FOR, AMEN, is the word of
[1:02:26] the Lord. WE STAND FOR NOTHING, AMEN,
[1:02:29] OUTSIDE OF THE word of God. We do not
[1:02:32] stand for MAN'S INTERPRETATION. WE DO
[1:02:34] NOT STAND FOR DENOMINATIONAL OPINIONS.
[1:02:36] AMEN. We do not stand for man-made
[1:02:39] ideas. Amen. We stand for the word of
[1:02:41] God. Then as long as through the
[1:02:43] scripture IT HAS BEEN SOVEREIGNLY PLACED
[1:02:46] FROM GENESIS into Revelation. Amen. Back
[1:02:48] and forth up and down. Amen. There's not
[1:02:51] a way for the devil to move in there
[1:02:53] anywhere. Amen. Then you have got
[1:02:56] perfect confidence. Amen. I wonder how
[1:02:58] many can testify YOU BELIEVE WE'RE
[1:03:00] FOLLOWING A perfect message. Amen. AMEN.
[1:03:03] WE ARE FOLLOWING A PERFECT MESSAGE. THEN
[1:03:05] IF WE'RE FOLLOWING, AMEN. a perfect
[1:03:07] message. AMEN. WE OUGHT TO HAVE PERFECT
[1:03:10] CONFIDENCE IN THE PERFECT MESSAGE THAT
[1:03:12] WE'RE FOLLOWING. I LOVE HOW BROTHER
[1:03:14] BIBLE WOULD SAY THERE. AMEN. PAUL WOULD
[1:03:16] SAY, "NEITHER give place to the devil."
[1:03:19] Amen. I'll say it to you like this. The
[1:03:21] scripture, Amen, it speaks of the
[1:03:23] appearing of Christ. How many knows
[1:03:25] that? Amen. It speaks of the appearing
[1:03:27] of Christ. Amen. And it speaks of the
[1:03:30] coming of Christ. Now, if you want
[1:03:31] scripture for this, at 2 Timothy 1:9, it
[1:03:34] says, "WHO HAS SAVED US, AMEN, AND
[1:03:37] CALLED US WITH A HOLY CALLING, AMEN, not
[1:03:40] according to our works, but according to
[1:03:43] his own purpose and grace which was
[1:03:46] GIVEN US IN CHRIST JESUS, AMEN, BEFORE
[1:03:49] the world began." Amen. in verse 10, BUT
[1:03:52] IS NOW MADE manifest by the appearing,
[1:03:56] AMEN, OF OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, WHO
[1:03:59] HATH ABOLISHED DEATH, AND HATH BROUGHT
[1:04:01] LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT THROUGH
[1:04:04] THE GOSPEL. AMEN. NOW, YOU TELL ME ONE
[1:04:06] OTHER MESSAGE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE
[1:04:09] THAT TELLS YOU, AMEN, THAT YOU HAD
[1:04:12] SOMETHING IN YOU FROM BEFORE THE
[1:04:14] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. THERE'S
[1:04:16] NO OTHER MESSAGE THAT COULD TELL YOU,
[1:04:19] AMEN, THAT YOU WAS A PART OF THE SONS OF
[1:04:21] GOD THAT WERE SHOUTING FOR JOY. AMEN.
[1:04:24] WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS of the world was
[1:04:26] laid, AMEN, BUT THIS MESSAGE, AMEN,
[1:04:29] BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TIME MESSAGE. AMEN.
[1:04:32] BUT IT'S AN ETERNAL MESSAGE. IT IS NOT
[1:04:34] introducing you to your identity and
[1:04:36] time. It is introducing you to YOUR
[1:04:39] IDENTITY IN ETERNITY. LISTEN, YOU ARE
[1:04:42] NOT JUST IDENTIFIED, AMEN, AS TIME
[1:04:44] BEINGS AND CREATURES OF TIME, BUT THIS
[1:04:47] MESSAGE COME, AMEN, to awaken you to THE
[1:04:50] REVELATION THAT YOUR NAME WAS on the
[1:04:52] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, AMEN, FROM BEFORE
[1:04:54] THE FOUNDATION of the world. And when
[1:04:56] you begin to hear this message, it begin
[1:04:59] to quicken that seed on the inside of
[1:05:02] your heart. And it begin to produce a
[1:05:04] revival in you. Amen. And the light OF
[1:05:06] THE GOSPEL BEGIN TO COME TO LIFE. NOW,
[1:05:09] AMEN. AMEN. IN 2 TIMOTHY 4:8, AMEN.
[1:05:11] Henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:05:13] crown of righteousness. Amen. Which the
[1:05:15] Lord the righteous judge, Amen, shall
[1:05:18] give meth that day, and not to ME ONLY,
[1:05:22] BUT UNTO ALL THEM ALSO that love his
[1:05:24] appearing. Amen. In Titus 2:13, looking
[1:05:27] for that blessed hope. Amen. And the
[1:05:30] righteous appearing, the glorious
[1:05:32] appearing rather. Amen. Of the great God
[1:05:34] and our savior Jesus Christ. Amen. who
[1:05:37] gave himself for us that he might redeem
[1:05:41] us, amen, from all iniquity and purify
[1:05:44] unto himself. Amen. A peculiar people,
[1:05:47] amen, a zealous people of good works.
[1:05:51] Amen. Now, when you look there at that
[1:05:52] word appearing in the Greek, it is the
[1:05:54] New Testament advent of Christ. NOT ONLY
[1:05:57] THAT which has already taken place,
[1:06:00] Amen. and by WHICH HIS PRESENCE AND HIS
[1:06:03] power appear IN THE SAVING LIGHT HE has
[1:06:06] shed upon mankind. BUT IT IS ALSO THAT
[1:06:09] ILLUSTRIOUS RETURN, AMEN, from heaven to
[1:06:12] earth, amen, to occur in the future.
[1:06:15] Amen. Now, I WANT TO SAY THIS. IT TAKES
[1:06:17] A word prophet, folks. AMEN. AND A
[1:06:20] PROPHET IS NOT JUST SOMEBODY, AMEN, THAT
[1:06:23] SPEAKS of future events. AMEN. BUT A
[1:06:25] PROPHET IS A DIVINE revealer of the
[1:06:28] word. SO IT TOOK A PROPHET, AMEN, TO
[1:06:31] SHOW THE DIFFERENCE IN HIS APPEARING,
[1:06:33] AMEN, and in his coming. He said, now
[1:06:36] there's A GREAT BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE
[1:06:38] SIGN OF JESUS APPEARING and then Jesus
[1:06:41] coming. He said there's two different
[1:06:43] things. The appearing of the Lord and
[1:06:45] the coming of the Lord. He said, now the
[1:06:48] appearing of the Lord is now. Amen. SO
[1:06:51] WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR his appearing this
[1:06:53] morning. Amen. We are looking AT HIS
[1:06:56] APPEARING. AMEN. WE ARE looking for his
[1:06:59] coming. He is appearing in his people.
[1:07:02] His spirit working among them. Amen.
[1:07:05] Proving that it's him with them. Amen.
[1:07:08] Getting them ready for the rapture, for
[1:07:10] the coming of the Lord. Amen. To catch
[1:07:13] away his bride. See, the appearing AND
[1:07:17] THE COMING. NOW, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
[1:07:18] THIS. THE APPEARING IS THE PREPARING.
[1:07:22] AMEN. HIS APPEARING IS HIS PREPARING.
[1:07:25] AMEN. BUT HIS COMING IS THE TAKING AWAY
[1:07:28] OF what he has prepared. AMEN. BY HIS
[1:07:31] APPEARING. WELL, IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I
[1:07:33] WOULD HATE THIS MESSAGE, TOO. AMEN.
[1:07:36] BECAUSE IT'S NOT GETTING YOU READY FOR
[1:07:37] TRIBULATION. IT'S NOT GETTING YOU READY
[1:07:40] FOR ANOTHER CHURCH AGE. BUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:07:43] IS PREPARING YOU FOR THE CHANGING OF
[1:07:45] YOUR BODIES, FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE
[1:07:47] DEAD, FOR THE GOING HOME OF THE CHURCH.
[1:07:50] LISTEN, this is more than just a sermon.
[1:07:52] THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A PROPHET. THIS
[1:07:54] IS MORE THAN JUST A PREACHER. THIS IS
[1:07:56] THE PROPHESIED, AMEN, FULFILLMENT OF THE
[1:07:59] APPEARING OF OUR Lord in the hour that
[1:08:02] we're living in. My. And I CAN TELL YOU
[1:08:04] THIS MORNING. AMEN. His appearing is
[1:08:07] invisible. AMEN. BUT HIS COMING is
[1:08:10] visible.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T SEE THE LORD
[1:08:13] HERE THIS MORNING." AMEN. BECAUSE HE DID
[1:08:16] NOT PROPHESY. AMEN. TO BE HERE IN the
[1:08:18] form of human flesh today. Amen. In a
[1:08:21] corporal body, rather. He is here IN
[1:08:23] HUMAN FLESH. BUT HE IS NOT HERE IN NAILS
[1:08:25] SCARRED HANDS AND A CORPORAL BODY.
[1:08:28] PROPHET OF GOD SAID NOW IS THE
[1:08:29] APPEARING. AMEN. AMEN. THE COMING will
[1:08:32] soon be. He is appearing in the midst of
[1:08:35] us and he is doing the works that he
[1:08:37] once did where in his church. Now I want
[1:08:41] you TO WATCH A PROPHETIC ANNOUNCEMENT.
[1:08:43] HE SAID NOW MY MINISTRY is different
[1:08:45] from a pastor. AMEN. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM
[1:08:48] A TEACHER. AMEN. IF I SAY THINGS WRONG,
[1:08:50] BRETHREN, FORGIVE ME. I don't mean to.
[1:08:53] Amen. But this is my ministry. YOU SAY,
[1:08:56] "WHAT MINISTRY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?"
[1:08:57] I'M TALKING ABOUT MALACHI THE 4TH
[1:08:59] CHAPTER that said, "I the Lord WILL SEND
[1:09:01] ELIJAH THE PROPHET unto you before the
[1:09:04] coming of THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF
[1:09:05] THE LORD." I'M TALKING ABOUT REVELATIONS
[1:09:07] 3 AND 14 where there would be a seventh
[1:09:09] angel to a SEVENTH AGE. I'M TALKING
[1:09:11] ABOUT REVELATIONS 10 WHERE THERE WOULD
[1:09:13] BE A VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL. I'M NOT
[1:09:16] TALKING ABOUT A PREACHER. I'M NOT
[1:09:18] TALKING ABOUT A REFORMER. I'M NOT
[1:09:20] TALKING ABOUT A THEOLOGIAN. I'M TALKING
[1:09:22] ABOUT A WORD PROPHET WHO CAME WITH THE
[1:09:24] WORD TO POSITION YOU AND GIVE YOU A
[1:09:27] PLACE, AMEN, TO STAND AGAINST THE WS OF
[1:09:30] THE DEVIL. HE SAID, "THIS is my
[1:09:32] ministry." AMEN. TO DECLARE HIM, he is
[1:09:36] here. AMEN. NOW, WATCHING THE PRESENCE
[1:09:38] OF GOD AND RECOGNIZED right over here in
[1:09:39] Topeka, Kansas. He said, "Now what Jesus
[1:09:42] was, Amen, is what HIS PRESENCE IS NOW."
[1:09:46] AMEN. SO, if you're looking for Jesus,
[1:09:48] Amen. what he was IN A CORPORAL BODY.
[1:09:51] LISTEN, HIS PRESENCE IS NOW. LISTEN,
[1:09:54] it's the Hallelujah. IT'S THE SAME JESUS
[1:09:57] IN A DIFFERENT FORM. LISTEN, he's no
[1:10:00] lesser Jesus today BECAUSE HE'S HERE IN
[1:10:03] PRESENCE FORM THAN IF HE WAS HERE IN
[1:10:05] CORPORAL. LISTEN, Y'ALL REMEMBER JUST A
[1:10:07] FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN THE power of God
[1:10:09] COME THROUGH HERE SO STRONG. AMEN.
[1:10:11] Brother Ben couldn't even hardly sing.
[1:10:13] AND SOME OF YOU HAD YOUR HANDS UP AND
[1:10:14] WAS WORSHIPING. YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER
[1:10:16] ANDREW." AMEN. THAT WAS A GLORIOUS
[1:10:18] MOMENT. DO YOU REALIZE THAT'S no
[1:10:20] different? WHAT YOU FELT THAT HAD JESUS
[1:10:23] WALKED HERE in this BUILDING IN A
[1:10:25] CORPORAL BODY. AMEN. HE'S NO LESSER GOD
[1:10:27] IN JESUS. HE IS THE SAME GOD IN JESUS
[1:10:30] THAT HE WAS BECAUSE HE'S GOD AND HIS
[1:10:33] WORD IS TRUE. AH. AMEN. I can tell you
[1:10:36] this morning, he's not a million miles
[1:10:38] away. His corporal body is not here.
[1:10:41] Amen. BUT HIS PRESENCE IS RIGHT HERE
[1:10:43] THIS MORNING. AMEN. TO BLESS you and to
[1:10:46] heal you. Amen. To deliver you. Amen. TO
[1:10:49] ENCOURAGE YOU. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A
[1:10:52] DEAD RELIGION. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A
[1:10:54] DAY GONE BY. I'M TALKING ABOUT AN
[1:10:56] OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE
[1:10:59] WHERE THE SAME DYNAMICS OF GOD THAT FILL
[1:11:01] THE UPPER ROOM BEGINS TO FILL THE SOULS
[1:11:04] of believers AND REVIVAL AND LIFE BEGINS
[1:11:07] TO COME. YES, SIR. I'm talking about his
[1:11:10] presence.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. His presence is here. Amen. And
[1:11:15] it's among the church this morning.
[1:11:17] Amen. I'm falling apart up here and I
[1:11:18] even got started. He said, "Did you ever
[1:11:21] stop to think THIS MORNING?" AMEN. AS
[1:11:23] FAR as returning that IS TO BECOME
[1:11:25] VISIBLE, he is already here with us now.
[1:11:30] Amen. He is already here with us now.
[1:11:34] NOW TODAY JUST IMAGINE THAT HIS PRESENCE
[1:11:37] BEING HERE TODAY. HE SAYS NOW THE LORD
[1:11:40] JESUS IS IN another world or another
[1:11:43] dimension right here today in form of
[1:11:46] spirit. His spirit is blending in with
[1:11:50] our spirit. Now our EYES CANNOT SEE HIM
[1:11:53] BECAUSE THEY'RE YET PHYSICAL UNLESS
[1:11:56] THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT WE
[1:11:58] COULD SEE A VISION. HE SAID BUT HE IS
[1:12:01] HERE NOW Y'ALL WITH ME THIS MORNING. HE
[1:12:03] IS HERE JUST AS VISIBLE AND JUST AS REAL
[1:12:07] as what he was. Amen. The day he spoke
[1:12:10] to Mary at the grave or THE DAY HE MET
[1:12:13] CLEOPIUS ON HIS ROAD to Emmas. HIS
[1:12:16] PRESENCE IS HERE. It can be FILLED WITH
[1:12:18] THAT. AMEN. YOU CAN FEEL THAT INNER
[1:12:21] CHARGE THAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF THE HUMAN
[1:12:23] BODY. IT'S CALLED the new birth. AMEN.
[1:12:26] THE SOUL HAS BEEN MAGNETIZED UNTO HIM.
[1:12:29] AND ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN YOU LET YOUR
[1:12:31] MIND BECOME CONCENTRATED ON HIM, YOU'RE
[1:12:34] believing on him, THEN AFTER A WHILE
[1:12:37] SOMETHING, AMEN, A REALITY, YOU CAN FEEL
[1:12:40] SOMETHING SWEEP OVER YOUR BEING. AMEN.
[1:12:43] THAT'S the vindication of his
[1:12:45] resurrection. IT'S NOT A GUESS. IT'S NOT
[1:12:48] A HOPE. BUT TO EVERY PERSON THAT'S BORN
[1:12:51] AGAIN, IT'S A NO. AMEN. You know it.
[1:12:55] IT'S RIGHT THERE. I WONDER HOW MANY CAN
[1:12:57] TESTIFY THIS MORNING. I KNOW BEYOND THE
[1:13:00] SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT MY GOD IS NOT IN
[1:13:02] A GRAVE IN JERUSALEM. He is not IN A
[1:13:05] TOMB IN JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT BURIED
[1:13:07] IN THE MOUNTAINS of Arizona, but he is
[1:13:10] right here IN THE POWER OF HIS
[1:13:12] RESURRECTION THIS MORNING. YES, SIR.
[1:13:14] THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS
[1:13:16] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT HAS
[1:13:19] PROPHESIED OF THE APPEARING OF THE
[1:13:21] PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BEFORE
[1:13:24] the coming of Jesus Christ. Amen. He
[1:13:27] said if he shall return again in our
[1:13:29] midst. Amen. To prove himself. Amen.
[1:13:31] Besides the preach of the word that he's
[1:13:33] here. Amen. Convincing sinners that he's
[1:13:36] here. He's here to HEAL THE SICK AND
[1:13:38] WOULD REVEAL the cause as he did when he
[1:13:41] was here on earth. Then will you gladly
[1:13:43] accept your healing? He said, "Now if he
[1:13:46] will do SO AND WILL IDENTIFY HIMSELF,
[1:13:49] YOU SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO IDENTIFY
[1:13:52] YOURSELF WITH HIM THEN." AMEN. WHEN HE
[1:13:55] HAS COME among the church AND HE HAS
[1:13:59] IDENTIFIED THAT THIS IS NOT THE ELABUB.
[1:14:02] THIS IS NOT A FORTUNE TELLER. THIS IS
[1:14:04] NOT A MAN GETTING SECRETS ABOUT PEOPLE'S
[1:14:06] LIVES AND then trying to patch it UP AND
[1:14:08] CALL IT DISCERNMENT. BUT THIS IS THE
[1:14:10] RETURN, AMEN, OF THE MESSIAH SIGN. THIS
[1:14:13] IS THE RETURN OF ELOHIM. THIS IS THE
[1:14:16] RETURN OF MELZDC. LISTEN, WHEN YOU SEE
[1:14:18] IT AND YOU SEE IT PROVEN BY THE BIBLE,
[1:14:21] YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURES TESTIFYING, THAT
[1:14:23] AIN'T THE TIME TO BACK UP. THAT'S THE
[1:14:25] TIME TO SAY, "I STAND. I STAND WITH THE
[1:14:29] RETURN OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE
[1:14:31] GENERATION I'M LIVING IN." I'M NOT
[1:14:33] ASHAMED to say, "This is God."
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. Amen. And I tell you
[1:14:40] this morning, when a person when they
[1:14:41] lose their spiritual confidence, Amen.
[1:14:43] The first thing they do is they become
[1:14:45] ashamed. Amen. When they lose their
[1:14:48] confidence IN WHAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING AND
[1:14:50] WHAT THEY'RE BELIEVING, THE FIRST THING
[1:14:52] THEY DO, brother David, IS THEY BECOME
[1:14:54] ASHAMED of it.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what David said in Psalms
[1:14:59] 119:6? He said, "Then shall I not BE
[1:15:02] ASHAMED WHEN I have respect unto all thy
[1:15:05] commandments." I LOVE IN ISAIAH 50
[1:15:07] AND:E7, "FOR THE LORD GOD WILL HELP ME.
[1:15:11] THEREFORE SHALL I NOT BE CONFOUNDED.
[1:15:15] THEREFORE HAVE I SET MY FACE, AMEN, LIKE
[1:15:17] A FLINT." I love this. AND I KNOW THAT I
[1:15:21] SHALL not be ashamed. Listen, THERE'S NO
[1:15:24] GUESSING THIS MORNING. AMEN. THERE'S NO
[1:15:26] HOPING THIS MORNING. THERE IS AN
[1:15:28] AUTHORITY IN THE FLESH OF THE BRIDE OF
[1:15:31] JESUS CHRIST. WHEN HE SHALL APPEAR, I
[1:15:34] KNOW I SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED. AMEN. We're
[1:15:36] living in an age, Amen. When
[1:15:38] identification is required. Y'ALL, Y'ALL
[1:15:40] KNOW THAT. AMEN. It's an identified age.
[1:15:43] It's an age WHERE IDENTIFICATION. NOW, I
[1:15:46] WANT Y'ALL TO NOTICE THIS. AMEN.
[1:15:48] Identification identifies, Amen. where
[1:15:50] you come from. Amen. It don't
[1:15:53] necessarily identify where you're going.
[1:15:55] AMEN. BUT IT IDENTIFIES WHERE YOU COME
[1:15:57] FROM. OH MY. AMEN. Y'ALL KNOW THIS
[1:16:00] MORNING, AMEN. IF YOU GO DOWN HERE TO
[1:16:01] THE AIRPORT, AMEN, and you get on a
[1:16:03] plane and you fly UP TO CANADA, AMEN,
[1:16:05] THE FIRST THING THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU
[1:16:07] FOR, AMEN, IS YOUR PASSPORT because they
[1:16:10] want to know where YOU COME FROM. AMEN.
[1:16:12] They want to know what kind of
[1:16:13] identification you got. Amen. Now, IF
[1:16:16] YOU GOT A FAKE PASSPORT, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:16:18] BE A NERVOUS WRECK. AMEN. AMEN. IF YOU
[1:16:20] BOUGHT ONE OFF OF SOME GUY DOWN THERE IN
[1:16:21] THE CORNER SELLING THEM, AMEN. YOU'RE
[1:16:23] GOING TO BE A NERVOUS WRECK. BUT IF YOU
[1:16:25] WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND YOU GOT A
[1:16:27] LEGITIMATE PASSPORT, YOU GOT A STAMP ON
[1:16:30] IT. THE US GOVERNMENT BACKS IT UP. YOU
[1:16:33] WALK UP THERE WITH CONFIDENCE KNOWING
[1:16:35] YOU CAN GO IN AND KNOWING YOU CAN COME
[1:16:37] OUT. AMEN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS
[1:16:39] MORNING, AMEN. GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[1:16:42] OF THE WORLD PLACED A SEED IN YOUR SOUL
[1:16:44] AND HE GAVE YOU A WORD IDENTIFICATION
[1:16:47] AND HE KNEW YOU COULD GO INTO LEONA AND
[1:16:50] YOU COULD COME OUT OF LEONA. YOU WOULD
[1:16:52] NOT GIVE UP YOUR IDENTIFICATION. YOU
[1:16:54] WOULD NOT BECOME ASHAMED OF YOUR
[1:16:57] HERITAGE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's an age OF IDENTITY
[1:17:03] CRISIS. AMEN. THERE IS A PRESSURE TODAY
[1:17:05] IN THE WORLD. AMEN. TO BECOME ASHAMED OF
[1:17:08] WHO YOU ARE. AMEN. TO BECOME ASHAMED OF
[1:17:11] YOUR IDENTITY. LET ME JUST SAY THIS. MEN
[1:17:13] ARE BECOMING ASHAMED TO BE MEN. AMEN.
[1:17:15] THAT'S WHY THEIR WIVES ARE leaving the
[1:17:17] house. And well, glory to God. Amen. And
[1:17:20] women ARE BECOMING ASHAMED TO BE WOMEN.
[1:17:22] AMEN. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS MORNING,
[1:17:24] AMEN, IF WE WOULD GET BACK TO THE BIBLE,
[1:17:27] IT WOULD BRING A CLEAR DISTINCTION
[1:17:29] BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, BETWEEN A
[1:17:31] FATHER AND A MOTHER.
[1:17:34] Between the parents and the child. Oh
[1:17:37] well, glory to God. See, I REMEMBER WHEN
[1:17:39] THE PARENTS led the house and not the
[1:17:40] children.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN MOM AND DADDY MADE THE
[1:17:44] DECISIONS WITHOUT asking the babies,
[1:17:46] "Are we going to go to church? Should
[1:17:47] we?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. Is that okay? AMEN. I
[1:17:52] REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MEN COME TO CHURCH
[1:17:54] AND LOOK LIKE men and women come to
[1:17:56] CHURCH AND LOOK LIKE WOMEN. AMEN. BUT
[1:17:58] BECAUSE OF THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN,
[1:18:00] IT'S AN IDENTITY CRISIS. SO THERE'S A
[1:18:03] PRESSURE ON A MAN, AMEN, TO BECOME A
[1:18:05] MAN. IT'S LIKE I HEARD SOMETHING STUPID.
[1:18:07] SORRY, I shouldn't say that. HEARD
[1:18:08] SOMETHING SILLY THE OTHER DAY. AMEN.
[1:18:10] THEY HAD THIS THIS THIS women's movement
[1:18:12] and they said every man that come in
[1:18:13] this BUSINESS OUGHT TO WALK IN WITH HIS
[1:18:15] HEAD DOWN AND APOLOGIZING TO EVERY woman
[1:18:17] that he's a man. I THOUGHT NOW HOW FAR
[1:18:20] ARE WE GOING TO GO WITH THIS NONSENSE. A
[1:18:22] YOU SEE IT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. BUT
[1:18:25] DON'T YOU FORGET WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE
[1:18:26] NATURAL. AMEN. IS ALSO HAPPENING IN THE
[1:18:29] SPIRITUAL. AMEN. THAT'S WHY JESUS COME
[1:18:31] IN MARK THE 8TH CHAPTER and he said
[1:18:33] whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of
[1:18:36] my words in this adulterous AND SINFUL
[1:18:39] GENERATION OF HIM SHALL the son of man
[1:18:42] BE ASHAMED WHEN HE COMETH IN THE GLORY
[1:18:45] OF HIS FATHER. AMEN. WITH THE HOLY
[1:18:47] ANGELS. NOW THE PROPHET OF GOD COME IN
[1:18:50] 1965 and preaches a beautiful SERMON AND
[1:18:53] HE CALLS IT ONE WORD ASHAMED. HE SAID,
[1:18:56] "NOW THE WORD ASHAMED COULD BE ALSO
[1:18:59] TRANSLATED AS EMBARRASSED." He said,
[1:19:02] "NOW YOU'RE FACED WITH SOMETHING THAT
[1:19:04] YOU'RE EMBARRASSED ABOUT." SORRY. AMEN.
[1:19:06] BEING ASHAMED. HE SAID, "NOW ANOTHER
[1:19:08] THING ASHAMED DOES, it shows that you
[1:19:11] are not SURE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[1:19:13] ABOUT." IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
[1:19:15] ABOUT AND HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU
[1:19:18] KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN
[1:19:20] TELL ANYBODY THAT AND YOU'RE not
[1:19:22] ashamed. AMEN. IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU
[1:19:25] STAND AND YOU CAN PROVE IT BY THE BIBLE,
[1:19:28] THEN THERE'S NO INTELLECTUAL DEVIL.
[1:19:30] THERE'S NO ATHEISTIC DEVIL, THERE'S NO
[1:19:33] AGNOSTIC DEVIL, THERE'S NO LEODYSIAN
[1:19:36] DEVIL THAT CAN INTIMIDATE YOU, AMEN, TO
[1:19:38] BACK OFF OF WHERE YOU STAND ON THE WORD
[1:19:41] OF GOD. YES, SIR. IF YOU FEEL PUT OUT,
[1:19:44] AMEN, OUT OF PLACE, IT SHOWS YOU'RE NOT
[1:19:47] SURE. AMEN. I'LL TELL YOU THIS MORNING.
[1:19:49] AMEN. THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS NOT UNSURE
[1:19:52] of what she believes. As a matter of
[1:19:54] fact, THE BIBLE SAYS, "NEVERTHELESS, I
[1:19:56] AM NOT ASHAMED, FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE
[1:19:59] BELIEVED." AMEN. I'LL SAY THIS MORNING
[1:20:02] AS BELIEVERS, we're going to face demon
[1:20:04] spirits. AND THOSE DEMON SPIRITS ARE
[1:20:06] GOING TO TRY TO DISPOSITION YOU. AMEN.
[1:20:09] AS THE OVERCOMERS OF THIS HOUR. BUT A
[1:20:11] PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "YOU BETTER KNOW
[1:20:13] WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU STAND
[1:20:15] BEFORE THEM." AMEN. I'll say it to YOU
[1:20:17] LIKE THIS. AMEN. ASHAMED OF HIM. AMEN.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE PROPHET OF GOD WILL SHOW YOU
[1:20:23] THERE. HE'LL SHOW YOU HOW THAT JESUS AND
[1:20:26] THE WORD ARE THE SAME. AND I'LL SAY IT
[1:20:28] LIKE THIS. TO BE ASHAMED OF ONE is to be
[1:20:31] ashamed of the other. NOW, IN ST. JOHN
[1:20:34] 1, THE BIBLE SAYS, "IN the beginning was
[1:20:36] the word." Right? And the word WAS WITH
[1:20:38] GOD, AND THE word was God. Now, if you
[1:20:41] skip on down to the 14th verse, it says,
[1:20:44] "And the word was made flesh AND DWELT
[1:20:47] AMONG US." AMEN. NOW THE ONLY THING THAT
[1:20:50] CHANGED BETWEEN THE FIRST THREE VERSES
[1:20:52] AND THE 14TH verse was the spirit TOOK
[1:20:55] ON FORM IN THE FLESH OF A MAN CALLED
[1:20:57] JESUS. LISTEN, HE WAS NO LESSER THE WORD
[1:21:01] WHEN HE COME IN THE FLESH THAN HE WAS IN
[1:21:03] GENESIS 1. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:21:06] I REFUSE TO BECOME A DENOMINATIONAL
[1:21:09] LAYOUT OF SIN THAT SAYS I BELIEVE IN
[1:21:11] JESUS BUT I AM ASHAMED OF HIS WORD.
[1:21:13] LISTEN, I BELIEVE IN HIS WORD. I BELIEVE
[1:21:16] IN HIS SPIRIT. I BELIEVE IN HIS
[1:21:18] ANOINTING. I BELIEVE IN HIS PRESENCE. I
[1:21:20] BELIEVE IN HIS PROPHET. I BELIEVE IN THE
[1:21:22] HOLY GHOST. LISTEN, I AM NOT ASHAMED. I
[1:21:25] KNOW IN WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say THIS MORNING THAT
[1:21:31] WHEN A MESSENGER brings a message, the
[1:21:33] message and the messenger ARE ONE.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; NOT ASHAMED TO SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID
[1:21:38] WHEN HE SAID A DENOMINATIONAL MAN UNDER
[1:21:41] A DENOMINATIONAL OPOSIS BY IN the
[1:21:43] church. Amen. He and the church is one.
[1:21:46] Now, I looked up the word opospice. It's
[1:21:47] really powerful. AMEN. IT MEANS
[1:21:49] GUIDANCE. SO, A MAN WHO'S UNDER THE
[1:21:52] BAPTIST GUIDANCE IS GOING TO TEACH
[1:21:54] THINGS THE way the Baptist teaches it.
[1:21:56] No offense TO THE BAPTIST, GOD BLESS
[1:21:58] HIM. AMEN. A MAN UNDER A PENTECOSTAL
[1:22:00] GUIDANCE IS GOING TO TEACH THINGS THE
[1:22:02] WAY THE PENTECOSTAL LEADERS HAVE TAUGHT
[1:22:04] HIM TO TEACH IT. BUT ACCORDING TO 1 JOHN
[1:22:06] 2, IN THE LAST DAYS, THE ANOINTING OF
[1:22:09] GOD WOULD RETURN TO THE CHURCH, AND IT
[1:22:12] WOULD NO LONGER BE A MAN TEACHING. IT
[1:22:14] WOULD BE THE ANOINTING HAVING BEEN
[1:22:16] VEILED BEHIND THE FLESH OF A MAN. AND IT
[1:22:19] WOULD BE THE ANOINTING TEACHING THE
[1:22:20] CHURCH. THAT'S SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, WE
[1:22:22] DON'T NEED A PROPHET." CUZ RIGHT THERE,
[1:22:24] THE BIBLE SAID, "WE DON'T NEED NO MAN
[1:22:25] TEACH US." OH, COME ON, CHURCH. HE WAS
[1:22:28] SAYING WE DON'T NEED MAN'S
[1:22:30] INTERPRETATION. WHAT WE NEED IS the
[1:22:33] spirit's revelation
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; of the word or we'll fail to get it.
[1:22:38] Now, amen. I want to go on and say what
[1:22:39] the prophet says. He says, "Then when a
[1:22:41] man comes where thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:22:44] he and the message is one." Amen. So the
[1:22:48] word of God AND THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE
[1:22:51] WAS THE SELFSAME THING ALL THE TIME in
[1:22:55] spiritual food in due season. He said
[1:22:57] Jesus was THE WORD THAT WAS PROPHESIED
[1:23:00] OF. HE WAS THE PROPHET. I LOVE THIS
[1:23:02] BROTHER BRIAN. HE WAS WHAT THAT THE
[1:23:04] PROPHET SAID WOULD HAPPEN. SEE, ISAIAH
[1:23:07] SAID THAT A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. AMEN.
[1:23:11] WAY BACK IN THE BEGINNING, GOD TOLD THEM
[1:23:14] THAT THE WOMAN'S SEED WOULD bruise the
[1:23:15] serpent's head and he would bruise HER
[1:23:17] HEEL. NOW, ALL THESE PROPHECIES HAD BEEN
[1:23:21] GIVEN. AMEN. LISTEN, THESE PROPHECIES
[1:23:23] WERE NOT GIVEN on the morning JESUS WAS
[1:23:26] BORN. THESE PROPHECIES WERE GIVEN,
[1:23:28] BROTHER ROY, HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE
[1:23:30] THE WORD WAS FULFILLED. HE SAID DAVID
[1:23:33] CRYING ALL THE REST OF THE PROPHETS DOWN
[1:23:35] TO THE AGES SPEAKING OF HIM. LISTEN, he
[1:23:38] was that WORD MANIFESTED. AMEN. IN THE
[1:23:42] BEGINNING was the word AND THE WORD WAS
[1:23:44] WITH GOD AND THE WORD WAS GOD AND THE
[1:23:47] WORD WAS MADE FLESH OR THE WORD WAS
[1:23:50] MANIFESTED.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Oh church of the living God, I can tell
[1:23:54] YOU THIS MORNING, THIS BIBLE, AMEN, IS A
[1:23:57] PROPHETIC BOOK. I CAN TELL YOU IT'S A
[1:23:59] FULL OF PROPHETS. I CAN TELL YOU IN THE
[1:24:01] OLD TESTAMENT THEM OLD TESTAMENT
[1:24:03] PROPHETS STOOD THERE AND THEY SAID THE
[1:24:05] MESSIAH IS COMING. AMEN. THE MESSIAH IS
[1:24:08] COMING. BUT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, AMEN,
[1:24:11] THEY JOHN THE BAPTIST STOOD THERE AND HE
[1:24:13] SAID, "BEHOLD, THE LAMB OF GOD THAT IS
[1:24:16] COME." AMEN. DO YOU SEE THE CHANGE? IT
[1:24:19] WENT FROM MESSIAH IS COMING TO BEHOLD
[1:24:22] WHAT IS COMING IS NOW HERE. AND A
[1:24:24] PROPHET SAID, "I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE
[1:24:26] WITH ALL YOUR HEART THAT GOD IS IN THE
[1:24:29] BUILDING." AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME THIS
[1:24:31] MORNING? AMEN. JOHN OR RATHER RATHER
[1:24:33] MOSES SAID, "MESSIAH IS COMING." AMEN.
[1:24:36] JOHN STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN
[1:24:38] AND SAID, "BEHOLD, THE LAMB OF GOD IS
[1:24:40] HERE." AND AFTER SEVEN church ages, WHEN
[1:24:43] THE SON OF GOD DISPENSATION WOULD RUN
[1:24:45] OUT, HE WOULD RAISE UP A PROPHET THAT
[1:24:48] WOULD STAND ON THE PLATFORM AND SAY,
[1:24:50] "I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I FEEL
[1:24:52] LIKE HE'S HERE. I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:24:54] THAT I SENSE HE'S SOMEWHERE. I'M HERE TO
[1:24:57] TELL YOU HE'S NOT THREE FEET FROM WHERE
[1:24:59] I'M STANDING. THE GOD OF THIS BIBLE IS
[1:25:02] RIGHT HERE AND HE'S HERE IN POWER. HE'S
[1:25:05] HERE IN AUTHORITY. HE'S HERE IN REALITY.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. God is a spirit. Amen.
[1:25:12] It's getting COLD UP HERE. GOD IS A
[1:25:13] SPIRIT. AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM must
[1:25:16] worship him in spirit and in truth. He
[1:25:19] says, "Now, WHAT IS THE TRUTH?" AMEN.
[1:25:22] CHRIST THE WORD. The word is truth. THE
[1:25:26] SPIRIT IS THE HOLY Spirit and the word
[1:25:29] IS THE TRUTH. NOW, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:25:33] GETS A HOLD OF THE WORD OF PROMISE AND
[1:25:37] BRINGS IT TO PASS. SEE, IF YOU ABIDE IN
[1:25:40] ME AND MY WORD IN YOU, THEN ASK WHAT YOU
[1:25:43] WILL AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN unto you.
[1:25:46] Then it isn't you.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; COME ON. IT ISN'T YOU. IT'S THE WORD OF
[1:25:53] PROMISE THAT'S DOING IT. AMEN. I WANT TO
[1:25:56] SAY IT VERY PLAINLY THAT SATAN IS TRYING
[1:25:58] TO CRUCIFY
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; THE VINDICATED word of promise. BROTHER
[1:26:04] RAM SAYS IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK, he says
[1:26:06] the word of promise came to the Virgin
[1:26:09] Mary. AMEN. BUT THAT WORD OF PROMISE WAS
[1:26:12] HE HIMSELF TO BE MADE MANIFEST. GOD WAS
[1:26:16] MADE MANIFEST. HE HIMSELF ACTED AT THE
[1:26:19] TIME AND FULFILLED HIS OWN WORD OF
[1:26:21] PROMISE IN THE VIRGIN. LISTEN, IT WAS AN
[1:26:24] ANGEL THAT HAD BROUGHT HER THE MESSAGE,
[1:26:26] BUT THE ANGEL'S MESSAGE WAS THE WORD OF
[1:26:29] GOD. AMEN. SO, THE ANGEL DID NOT BRING
[1:26:32] HER SOMETHING, AMEN, APART FROM THE
[1:26:34] WORD, BUT THE ANGEL BROUGHT HER THE
[1:26:36] WORD. He says, "AND GO AWAY JESUS." HE
[1:26:39] SAID, "THEN THE LIVING WORD OF PROMISE
[1:26:42] WAS MADE ALIVE AND WAS PROJECTED RIGHT
[1:26:45] THROUGH THAT BODY AND THEY KNOW THAT GOD
[1:26:49] WAS IN HIM." OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:26:51] GOD, WHEN YOU SAW JESUS, AMEN, WALKING
[1:26:54] THE SHORES OF GALILEE, WHEN YOU SAW
[1:26:57] JESUS, AMEN, WALKING THE STREETS OF
[1:26:59] CAPERNAUM, WHEN YOU SAW JESUS DOWN THERE
[1:27:02] IN NAZARETH, YOU WERE NOT LOOKING AT
[1:27:04] JUST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. YOU WERE
[1:27:06] LOOKING AT THE PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; OH, CAN I SAY IT THIS MORNING? AMEN. BUT
[1:27:14] IT DIDN'T STOP THERE. AMEN. BECAUSE ALL
[1:27:16] THE WAY OVER IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS, THE
[1:27:19] IN CHAPTER, AMEN. PAUL REACHES BACK IN
[1:27:21] GENESIS AND BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT ABRAHAM
[1:27:25] [panting]
[1:27:25] AND HE BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT SARAH. AND
[1:27:28] HE SAYS IN ROMANS 9:9, "FOR THIS IS THE
[1:27:31] WORD OF PROMISE. AT WHAT? AT THIS TIME
[1:27:34] WILL I COME AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.
[1:27:38] He said ABRAHAM SEED. NOW I DON'T care
[1:27:41] what come contrary to Abraham. HE STAYED
[1:27:44] RIGHT WITH THE WORD OF PROMISE. HE SAID
[1:27:47] DO YOU SEE THAT ABRAHAM SEED TODAY?
[1:27:50] AMEN. Stays with THE WORD OF PROMISE.
[1:27:53] AMEN. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PREACH IT ALL
[1:27:55] THIS MORNING. AMEN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS
[1:27:57] TO YOU. AMEN. YOU ARE A CHILD OF
[1:27:59] PROMISE. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT PAUL
[1:28:01] CALLED YOU. HE CALLED YOU A CHILD OF
[1:28:04] PROMISE. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. WHAT WAS
[1:28:06] ISAAC? HE WAS A PROMISED CHILD. AMEN.
[1:28:09] WHO WAS JESUS? HE WAS THE PROMISED
[1:28:11] CHILD. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID,
[1:28:13] "EVERY TIME A MESSAGE COMES, IT THROWS
[1:28:15] THE CHURCH INTO A HEAVIER BIRTH PAIN.
[1:28:18] AND SHE'S GOING TO BRING FORTH, AMEN,
[1:28:20] THE PROMISED WORD." I TELL YOU THIS
[1:28:22] MORNING, IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR FIGHTING
[1:28:24] CLOTHES ON. IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR JOY
[1:28:27] SHOES ON. IT'S TIME TO LOOK THAT DEVIL
[1:28:29] IN THE FACE THIS MORNING AND SAY, "I
[1:28:32] DIDN'T PUT MYSELF HERE. I DIDN'T BUY MY
[1:28:34] POSITION." AMEN. BUT GOD, BEFORE THE
[1:28:37] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, POSITIONED ME
[1:28:40] IN THIS HOUR UNDER THIS ANOINTING AS A
[1:28:43] CHILD OF THIS PROMISE TO WATCH THE WORD
[1:28:46] OF PROMISE COME TO PASS.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word, SIR. HE SAID THAT
[1:28:53] VOICE OF God that speaks to you. Oh my.
[1:28:57] Then from a little group of the truth
[1:28:58] see the word GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST A
[1:29:01] BELOVED VIRGIN, a virgin of his word.
[1:29:04] And through them and by them will and
[1:29:06] through them and through Joe AND THROUGH
[1:29:10] JOHN. COME ON CHURCH. AND THROUGH JONAH
[1:29:14] AND THROUGH LILLIAN AND THROUGH WESLEY.
[1:29:16] AMEN. AND THROUGH DAVID PAUL AND THROUGH
[1:29:18] THEM AND THROUGH ED. AND THROUGH THROUGH
[1:29:21] TAMMY, THROUGH THEM WILL THE WORD BE
[1:29:24] FULFILLED. HIS PROMISED WORD IN THE
[1:29:27] VIRGIN WHO KNOWS NO MAN-MADE CREEDS OR
[1:29:30] DOGMAS. OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD,
[1:29:33] THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT
[1:29:37] WAS IN MARY, HE WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS
[1:29:40] OWN WORD OF PROMISE SO TO FULFILL ALL
[1:29:43] THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OF HIM AS HE DID
[1:29:46] WHEN HE COME FROM THE VIRGIN WOMB. Oh
[1:29:49] my. HE SAID THEY ARE HIS SUBJECTS. SEE
[1:29:52] THEY ARE SUBJECT TO HIS HEAD. SO WHEN A
[1:29:54] CHILD OF PROMISE COMES IN CONTACT WITH
[1:29:58] THE MESSAGE OF THEIR HOUR, THE WORD OF
[1:30:00] PROMISE BECOMES THE HEADSHIP OVER THEIR
[1:30:03] LIFE. NO MANMADE INTERPRETATION NO
[1:30:06] LONGER HAS AUTHORITY OVER A CHILD OF
[1:30:10] PROMISE. AMEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE
[1:30:11] BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE SAYS THE WORD OF
[1:30:14] PROMISE, IT CANNOT FAIL. AMEN. I LOVE
[1:30:17] WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "PEOPLE
[1:30:19] ACT FUNNY." HE SAID, "THEY SEEM TO JUST
[1:30:21] FORGET ABOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BECAUSE
[1:30:24] THEY HAVE FOUND AN ABSOLUTE." OH, CHURCH
[1:30:27] OF THE LIVING GOD, I CAN TELL YOU THIS
[1:30:30] MORNING, WE ACT FUNNY TO THE WORLD.
[1:30:32] BROTHER JOHN, WE ACT LIKE CRAZY, FOLKS.
[1:30:35] BUT THE ONLY REASON WE DO IT IS BECAUSE
[1:30:37] WE FOUND AN ABSOLUTE.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND OUR ABSOLUTE IS THE WORD OF
[1:30:43] GOD. LET ME SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE
[1:30:46] SAID, "THEN THE WORD, YOU COME BACK TO
[1:30:48] THE WORD AGAIN, WHICH IS THE WORD OF
[1:30:50] PROMISE." NOW, WHAT IS THE WORD OF
[1:30:52] PROMISE TO EVERY CHRISTIAN? HOW MANY
[1:30:54] CHRISTIANS HAVE I GOT HERE TODAY? AMEN.
[1:30:57] YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN, THEN THERE'S A WORD
[1:30:59] OF PROMISE FROM THIS BIBLE TO YOUR LIFE.
[1:31:02] YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? GREATER IS HE
[1:31:04] THAT'S IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE
[1:31:07] WORLD. THEN HOW DO I OVERCOME NOT ME,
[1:31:11] BUT THE WORD THAT'S IN ME? THE WORD IS
[1:31:14] GOD. I'M GOING TO OVERCOME THE THINGS OF
[1:31:17] THE WORLD BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD IN ME.
[1:31:21] LISTEN, just keep pressing. YOU'RE
[1:31:23] COMING TO THE TOP AS SURE AS ANYTHING.
[1:31:26] AMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO come to the top.
[1:31:29] AMEN. NOW LOOK HERE. WE'RE INSIDE OF
[1:31:31] CHRIST. HOW MANY'S INSIDE OF CHRIST?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; NOW, AS THEN ALL TRUE BELIEVERS, THEY
[1:31:38] SEE HIM.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY SEE HIM? THEY SEE THE WORD
[1:31:42] OF PROMISE OF THIS DAY OPENLY
[1:31:45] MANIFESTED. THAT'S A BIG WORD IF YOU CAN
[1:31:48] GET IT. ALL TRUE BELIEVERS THAT'S IN THE
[1:31:51] WORD. THEY CAN SEE GOD OPENLY. THE VEIL
[1:31:56] IS RENT. LISTEN. AND GOD STANDS OPENLY
[1:31:59] BEFORE YOU. HE IS MANIFESTED. AMEN. SEE
[1:32:02] GOD MANIFESTED OPEN. OH CHURCH OF THE
[1:32:06] LIVING GOD. IF ANYBODY OUGHT TO BE
[1:32:09] SHOUTING CARRYING THIS BIBLE THIS
[1:32:11] MORNING IS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WE
[1:32:14] HAVE SEEN GOD. WE HAVE SEEN HIM
[1:32:16] MANIFESTED AND WE HAVE SEEN HIM OPENLY
[1:32:18] DECLARE
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IN ORDER TO DO THIS NOW HOW
[1:32:24] ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM? In order to is
[1:32:26] this okay? Are you enjoying the word? IN
[1:32:29] ORDER TO DO THIS OUR OLD DENOMINATIONAL
[1:32:32] TRADITIONAL VEIL MUST BE RENT AGAIN. SO,
[1:32:36] IT WAS RENT ONE TIME, BUT THEN SOMEBODY,
[1:32:39] BROTHER JARED, PUT A VEIL BACK OVER IT,
[1:32:41] BUT IT MUST BE RENT AGAIN IN ORDER TO
[1:32:44] REALLY SEE WHAT IT IS. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:32:46] COME OUT FROM AMONG THAT STUFF.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME OUT FROM AMONG THAT
[1:32:52] STUFF. YOU'LL NEVER DO IT. THEY'LL KEEP
[1:32:55] PULLING THE VEIL BEFORE YOU EVERY TIME.
[1:32:57] EVERY TIME GOD MOVES, THEY'LL SAY, "OH,
[1:33:00] THERE IS NOTHING TO THAT." BUT HERE IT
[1:33:02] IS WRITTEN, AND HERE IT IS MADE
[1:33:04] MANIFEST. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY,
[1:33:06] "THANK GOD THIS MORNING WHEN THE HOLY
[1:33:09] GHOST, BROTHER DAVID, BEGINS TO WALK
[1:33:11] AMONG THIS CHURCH, WE GOT SOME LEADERS.
[1:33:14] WE GOT SOME WORSHIPPERS."
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE GOT SOME BELIEVERS THAT
[1:33:20] DON'T SAY, "OH, THIS IS WRONG AND WE
[1:33:22] SHOULDN'T DO THAT." AMEN. I SAY, "THANK
[1:33:23] GOD THAT WHEN THE ANOINTING GETS TO
[1:33:25] MOVING, WE GOT A SONG LEADER THAT DON'T
[1:33:28] SHUT IT DOWN, BUT HE BEGINS TO FAN THE
[1:33:30] FLAMES." I SAY, "THANK GOD." OH, I KNOW.
[1:33:34] I KNOW SOMETIMES IT BE GET A LITTLE TORE
[1:33:36] UP BECAUSE MAYBE THE SERVICE GOES A
[1:33:38] LITTLE BIT LONGER. AMEN. BUT I SAY THANK
[1:33:40] GOD WE GOT A PASTOR LIKE MATT MORRIS
[1:33:43] THAT'LL STAND IN A FIELD UNDER A TENT
[1:33:45] AND HE'LL PUSH THAT NO PRAISING GOD
[1:33:47] BACK. THAT NO PRAISING GOD DEVIL BACK TO
[1:33:51] THE HELL THAT'LL CRAWL OUT OF AND IF HE
[1:33:53] GOT TO SING IT A HUND TIMES, HE'S GOING
[1:33:55] TO SAY, "I'M GOING TO THE MEETING." OH,
[1:33:58] I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, I'M NOT ASHAMED
[1:34:00] TO STAND AS A WORSHIPPER AND PUSH THAT
[1:34:03] DEVIL BACK IN THE PITS OF HELL WHERE HE
[1:34:06] CRAWLED OUT OF I THINK WE'VE GIVE THAT
[1:34:08] DEVIL TOO MUCH ROOM. I THINK WE GIVE
[1:34:10] THAT DEVIL TOO MUCH LEEWAY. I THINK IT'S
[1:34:12] TIME SOMEBODY IF YOU GOT TO LOOK LIKE A
[1:34:14] FOOL AND ACT LIKE A FOOL. BROTHER SAID
[1:34:17] MARY HAD TO ACT IDIOTIC LIKE THE REST OF
[1:34:20] THEM. HE SAID, "BUT SHE GOT THE HOLY
[1:34:22] GHOST." AND I THINK WE NEED SOME PEOPLE
[1:34:24] THAT'LL GET OUT OF FORM. IT'LL GET OUT
[1:34:27] OF FASHION. IT'LL GET OUT OF TRADITION
[1:34:29] UNLESS THE WORD BEGIN TO MOVE AGAIN
[1:34:32] WITHOUT MAN'S INTERPRETATION.
[1:34:35] [cheering and applause]
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; OH, I'm going on with Jesus just the
[1:34:38] same.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know. Amen. I'm not an
[1:34:43] idiot. I know. Devils start pushing.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; They start pushing
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; and pushing
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; pushing.
[1:34:52] AND IF WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND,
[1:34:54] WELL, WE JUST PACK UP AND GO TO THE
[1:34:55] HOUSE.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW WHERE I STAND.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You ain't GOING TO YOU AIN'T GOING TO
[1:35:08] INTIMIDATE ME into being quiet in the
[1:35:10] house of God.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; You ain't GOING TO KEEP ME QUIET. COME
[1:35:19] ON.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; SEE, I'm the kind THAT'LL STAND UP,
[1:35:23] BREAK THE ATMOSPHERE by myself.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I've done it before.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about, Joe.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Preaching some of these churches and
[1:35:34] it's 30 to go 30 degrees below zero.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And you're ready for the power of God to
[1:35:40] fall and the pastors over there texting
[1:35:41] and flipping through notebooks and song
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they don't want a move of God. They
[1:35:47] don't want you to have the move OF GOD.
[1:35:48] WELL, LET NEWS FLASH. YOU WILL NOT TAKE
[1:35:50] MY MOVE OF GOD AWAY FROM ME.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE IT. AMEN. I
[1:35:57] DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY HOLLERING.
[1:35:58] I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY SHOUTING.
[1:36:00] I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY
[1:36:02] PREACHING. YOU WILL NEVER SHUT ME UP. I
[1:36:05] HAVE SEEN THE APPEARING OF THE LORD IN
[1:36:09] THE HOUR I'M LIVING IN. IF ANYBODY GOT A
[1:36:11] RIGHTEOUS SHOUT, I GOT A RIGHTEOUS
[1:36:13] SHOUT. IF ANYBODY GOT A RIGHT TO ENJOY
[1:36:16] THE SALVATION THAT GOD GAVE THEM IS THE
[1:36:19] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Remember said it's the Messiah.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He's standing in THE PLATFORM
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; WITH THE WORD of promise
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; for that age.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Now said how now you all know brother
[1:36:38] preaches a beautiful sermon in 1965. You
[1:36:41] know what he calls it this day.
[1:36:45] This scripture
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; is fulfilled.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Now, can I just read this to you? Is
[1:36:50] that okay? He takes it from Luke 4 and
[1:36:53] he says, "Now, how could those people
[1:36:55] ever fail to see who he was? How did
[1:36:58] they ever miss it? How could it be when
[1:37:00] it was so plainly made known and showed?
[1:37:02] How could they have ever missed seeing
[1:37:03] it?" Amen. What a word. Think of it.
[1:37:07] This day, this scripture is fulfilled
[1:37:11] before our eyes. WHO SAID IT? GOD
[1:37:15] HIMSELF. Who is the INTERPRETER OF HIS
[1:37:18] OWN WORD?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The Messiah. Are you with me?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Himself.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
[1:37:25] congregation and reading a word out of
[1:37:28] the Bible PERTAINING TO HIMSELF AND THEN
[1:37:32] SAYING, "TODAY, this scripture is
[1:37:35] fulfilled." AND THEY STILL FAILED TO SEE
[1:37:39] IT.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; WHAT A TRAGEDY THAT WOULD BE. BUT IT'S
[1:37:42] HAPPENED. IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES. HOW
[1:37:44] COULD IT HAPPEN? OF COURSE, LIKE IT DID
[1:37:46] IN OTHER TIMES. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? BY
[1:37:49] BELIEVING A MAN'S INTERPRETATION.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; NOW, COME ON, CHURCH. OF THE WORD.
[1:37:55] THAT'S WHAT CAUSED IT. NOW, THOSE
[1:37:57] BELIEVERS IN THEM DAYS, THOSE SO-CALLED
[1:37:59] BELIEVERS WAS TAKING THE INTERPRETATION
[1:38:02] OF WHAT THE PRIEST HAD SAID ABOUT THE
[1:38:05] SCRIPTURE. THEREFORE, JESUS NOT
[1:38:07] BELONGING TO ANY of their RANKS OR
[1:38:09] SOCIETIES, HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED FROM
[1:38:11] THEIR COMPANY. NOW, LISTEN. AND
[1:38:14] THEREFORE, ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS?
[1:38:16] THIS IS POWERFUL. THEY COULD NOT
[1:38:18] IDENTIFY HIM WITH THEM.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THEM. THE
[1:38:26] PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST WAS SO UNIQUE
[1:38:29] THAT NO ONE SHOULD ADMIT SEEING THAT IT
[1:38:32] WAS THE SON OF GOD BECAUSE HE WAS THE
[1:38:34] PERFECT IDENTIFICATION OF THE SCRIPTURE
[1:38:37] THAT WAS WROTE OF HIM. AND TODAY IT IS
[1:38:40] BECAUSE WE'RE IN SUCH A TURMOIL AS WE
[1:38:42] ARE AND PEOPLE FAIL TO SEE THE TRUTH OF
[1:38:45] GOD IS BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MANY THERE
[1:38:49] IS TOO MANY MADE MANMADE INTERPRETATIONS
[1:38:54] OF GOD'S WORD. WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
[1:38:57] BROTHER TOM. THERE'S TOO MANY MAN-MADE
[1:38:59] INTERPRETATIONS OF GOD'S WORD. HE SAID
[1:39:02] GOD DON'T NEED NOBODY TO INTERPRET his
[1:39:05] word. He is his own.
[1:39:09] HE IS HIS OWN INTERPRETER. AND BROTHER
[1:39:12] BSON SAID, "BEAUTIFUL. TODAY WE HAVE BY
[1:39:14] GOD'S HELP THE PERFECT INTERPRETATION OF
[1:39:17] THE WORD WITH DIVINE VINDICATION." AND
[1:39:20] CAN I SAY TODAY, DO NOT ALLOW, AMEN,
[1:39:23] MAN'S INTERPRETATION AROUND THIS
[1:39:26] MESSAGE.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, I ain't leaving this out
[1:39:30] there in the Baptist. I AIN'T LEAVING
[1:39:32] OUT THERE IN THE PENTECOSTALS. I'M GOING
[1:39:33] TO BRING IT RIGHT HERE. BROTHER DAVID,
[1:39:35] DON'T ALLOW MAN-MADE INTERPRETATIONS
[1:39:38] AROUND THIS MESSAGE TO VEIL WHAT HAS
[1:39:41] BEEN UNVEILED.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I THINK IT'S A SHAME
[1:39:45] THAT WE LET MEN GET BEHIND PULL PITS AND
[1:39:48] VEIL THE GLORY OF GOD IN THE CHURCH OF
[1:39:51] GOD BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO SAY
[1:39:53] WHAT A PROPHET SAID.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO SAY WHAT HE SAID.
[1:39:59] AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I'M
[1:40:01] GETTING TIRED, AMEN. OF BEING IDENTIFIED
[1:40:03] AS A SEVEN THUNDERS PREACHER. WE'LL
[1:40:04] PREACH WHAT THE PROPHET SAID ABOUT IT
[1:40:06] AND THEN WE'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; It's kind of like guys get tired of
[1:40:11] BEING LABELED RETURN. WE'LL PREACH
[1:40:13] AGAINST IT ONE TIME AND we know where
[1:40:14] you stand.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. LIKE SOMEBODY SAY,
[1:40:18] "WELL, I GET TIRED OF BEING LABELED
[1:40:19] PERUSIA." WE'LL TAKE A SERMON AGAINST IT
[1:40:22] ONE TIME AND LET US KNOW WHERE YOU
[1:40:24] STAND.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. Somebody shout
[1:40:29] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; SEE, I REFUSE TO ALLOW REVELATION 10
[1:40:35] THAT'S BEEN REVEALED TO BE UN TO BE
[1:40:37] VEILED. AGAIN, SAID IT'S THE MYSTERIES
[1:40:40] OF GOD MADE MANIFEST AND IT IS KNOWN AS
[1:40:43] THE SEVEN SEAL BOOK PROMISE. NOW, LET
[1:40:45] YOUR FAITH IN HIM WHO IS THE WORD.
[1:40:48] LISTEN, REVELATION 19, WHEN HE COMES,
[1:40:50] HE'S GOING TO BE CALLED THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:40:53] HE'S GOING TO BE RIDING UPON A WHITE
[1:40:55] HORSE AND THE FOLLOWERS OF HEAVEN WILL
[1:40:58] BE BEHIND HIM.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; OH, CAN I SAY WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE
[1:41:04] SAID, "BREAK THE DENOMINATIONAL veil of
[1:41:06] education."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; WOO, BROTHER. AMEN. BREAK THE
[1:41:11] DENOMINATIONAL VEIL OF TRADITION.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETIME OR ANOTHER, WE GOT TO
[1:41:16] BREAK IT. AMEN. TRADITION IS OKAY AT
[1:41:19] GRANNY'S SUPPER TABLE, BUT IN THE HOUSE
[1:41:21] OF GOD, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR TRADITION.
[1:41:24] TRADITION IS SICKENING. TRADITION WILL
[1:41:26] ROB YOU OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN THE
[1:41:29] PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; OH, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN.
[1:41:33] TRADITION IS BAD AS CONDEMNATION. AMEN.
[1:41:36] IT'LL HAVE YOU SO CONDEMNED. IT'LL HAVE
[1:41:38] YOU SO BOUND. Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:41:39] TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. BUT BREAK TRADITION
[1:41:42] ONE TIME AND LET THE POWER OF GOD SURGE
[1:41:44] THROUGH YOUR LIFE.
[1:41:46] ARE YOU TIRED OF GOING TO CHURCH AND
[1:41:47] LEAVING THE SAME WAY? WELL, break that
[1:41:49] old TRADITION THAT YOUR GRANDPA HAD AND
[1:41:52] YOUR DADDY HAD AND NOW YOU GOT IT. WELL,
[1:41:54] BLESS GOD. I'M A macho man and ain't
[1:41:56] nobody going to see ME CRY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:58] GLORY TO GOD. BREAK THAT OLD DEVIL AND
[1:42:01] LET YOUR BABY SEE THAT YOU CAN FEEL THE
[1:42:04] POWER OF GOD WHEN IT COMES INTO THE
[1:42:06] SERVICE. [applause]
[1:42:08] Oh well, y'all know what I'm talking
[1:42:10] about. Amen. WHEN I GOT MY HAIR JUST
[1:42:12] RIGHT AND I GOT AMEN. BREAK THAT OLD
[1:42:14] HOLLYWOOD TRADITION OF FASHION. AND IF
[1:42:17] THE POWER OF GOD SHAKES YOU FROM THE
[1:42:19] FLOOR TO THE CEILING, I SAY LET
[1:42:21] TRADITION GO AND LET THE WORD OF PROMISE
[1:42:24] BREAK OUT IN THE CHURCH. [applause]

[1:42:30] IS HOW WE DO IT. AND AMEN. I DON'T CARE
[1:42:32] HOW YOU DO IT. DO IT THE WAY THE WORD
[1:42:34] SAID DO IT.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; BREAK THOSE VEILS.
[1:42:48] It's a devil.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; It's called a devil.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Tradition is of the devil.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; It's of the devil.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Quiet the music down. That's the devil.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you, down there at Grace
[1:43:08] Tabernacle, that m that music, it's just
[1:43:10] blaring and it's just LOUD AND
[1:43:12] AND WE LOVE IT.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; SORRY, I'm home. I'm feeling good,
[1:43:17] BROTHER.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; WE LOVE IT.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; WE LOVE IT. I TELL YOU DOWN THERE, MAN.
[1:43:22] THEY THEY they play that piano and they
[1:43:24] BEAT HIM AND WE LOVE IT.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And I just I'm just sorry. I'm not
[1:43:28] political. I'm not good at being
[1:43:30] political. OKAY? AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE
[1:43:31] THE MUSIC LOUD, WELL, I CAN HELP YOU
[1:43:33] WITH THAT. IT'S CALLED A DEVIL
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PRO OF I FEEL that spirit
[1:43:39] clear AS A WORLD. PROBABLY GOD SAID
[1:43:41] DEMONS ARE DROVE OUT BY MUSIC.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN THEM MUSICIANS BEGIN TO
[1:43:46] PLAY THEM INSTRUMENTS, IT BEGINS TO
[1:43:48] DRIVE THEM DEVILS OUT TO MAKE AN
[1:43:50] ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE THAT THE WORD CAN
[1:43:53] COME FORTH AND CAN BEAR RESULTS AMONGST
[1:43:55] THE CONGREGATION. THEN IF THERE'S A
[1:43:57] DEVIL THAT DON'T LIKE A LITTLE MUSIC,
[1:43:59] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. IT'S A CHURCH
[1:44:01] OF CHRIST DEVIL AND IT'S A TRADITION AND
[1:44:04] IT DON'T BELONG IN THIS MESSAGE.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. I'LL
[1:44:10] SHOUT BY MYSELF. I'M TIRED OF
[1:44:12] TRADITIONS. TRADITIONS KILL YOUNG
[1:44:15] PEOPLE. TRADITIONS KILL THE MOVE OF GOD.
[1:44:18] TRADITIONS BIND THE EFFECT OF THE WORD
[1:44:20] OF PROMISE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:44:23] I REBUKE EVERY MAN-MADE TRADITION. AND I
[1:44:26] CALL FOR THE FIRE OF GOD TO FALL UPON
[1:44:28] THE ALTAR OF GOD AND CONSUME THE
[1:44:31] SACRIFICE OF PRAISE.
[1:44:36] You know what your prophet said? He said
[1:44:38] he's unconquered by tradition.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You know why people don't want Jesus
[1:44:47] around?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; He's unconquered by tradition.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Peter, he tears traditions up.
[1:45:00] I
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; They was having a feast.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; They had their kosher and brother Joel,
[1:45:07] they had their rock over there that
[1:45:08] represented the rock and lers and they
[1:45:10] had this good traditional feast.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Dave, Jesus walked right in the
[1:45:17] middle of it.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's that's cute, but
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I'm the bread of life.
[1:45:29] NO, NO, NO. SEE, SEE, I'M THE WATER THAT
[1:45:32] WAS IN THAT ROCK.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU ALL ARE BACK THERE WHERE I WAS,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; BUT COME OVER HERE WHERE I AM.
[1:45:38] [screaming]
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BACK THERE IN A TRADITION AND YOU
[1:45:43] GOT CONFIDENCE IN THAT TRADITION, BUT
[1:45:45] LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THAT TRADITION.
[1:45:47] AND OH, GOD,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; come on. IF YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN
[1:45:51] WHERE GOD WAS, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
[1:45:53] CONFIDENCE IN WHERE GOD IS. IF YOU CAN
[1:45:55] BELIEVE GOD WAS WITH YOU 10 YEARS AGO,
[1:45:58] YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE HE'S WITH YOU
[1:45:59] TODAY. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE GOD WAS YOUR
[1:46:01] JOY WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:46:04] YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE GOD IS [screaming]
[1:46:05] YOUR JOY TODAY. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT
[1:46:07] A PROPHET SAID WAS THE TRUTH ON
[1:46:10] STANDARDS 20 YEARS AGO, YOU OUGHT TO
[1:46:12] STILL BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT TODAY
[1:46:14] BECAUSE THIS IS THE APPEARING OF THE
[1:46:17] LORD.
[1:46:21] NOW, now I got some time here. I want to
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I may slow down here, but will you stay
[1:46:26] with me?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; The word of promise stands up. Sister
[1:46:30] Joyce right there in the middle of the t
[1:46:32] in the tabernacle reads the scripture
[1:46:35] and says, "Now that's what Isaiah said.
[1:46:37] That's who I am.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; This day this scripture is fulfilled."
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And he walked over and he sat down.
[1:46:47] Now in Luke chapter 4, if you skip down
[1:46:51] to verse 28, it says this.
[1:46:54] And all they in the synagogue when they
[1:46:57] heard these things were filled with joy
[1:46:59] and shouts and praising and running all
[1:47:04] brother Brian. They were filled with
[1:47:05] wrath
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ROSE UP. NOW AIN'T it funny?
[1:47:13] The only time they went into action
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; is when they got mad.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Morgan, I'm gonna need a bodyguard
[1:47:23] today.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY TIME THEY EVER DID ANYTHING IN
[1:47:27] CHURCH IS WHEN THEY GOT MAD.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; The only time they ever really got in
[1:47:36] the service is when the preacher got to
[1:47:37] preaching against somebody they had
[1:47:39] somebody against.
[1:47:41] Man, this wall is getting pretty boring.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY TIME THEY MOVED WAS WHEN THEY
[1:47:48] ROSE UP TO THROW HIM OUT OF THE CITY.
[1:47:51] NOW WATCH IN VERSE 29. AND THEY LED HIM
[1:47:53] INTO THE BROW OF THE HILL WHERE ON THEIR
[1:47:56] CITY WAS BUILT. NOW WATCH THIS. THAT
[1:47:58] THEY MIGHT CAST HIM OUT. NOW I WANT YOU
[1:48:01] TO NOTICE WHAT THEY THROW OUT. THEY
[1:48:02] DON'T THROW HIS FEET OUT,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRIAN. THEY DON'T THROW HIM OUT
[1:48:07] BY HIS LEG. THE BIBLE SAYS THEY THREW
[1:48:10] HIM OUT headlong
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; when he picked UP THE SCRIPTURE AND
[1:48:16] IDENTIFIED I AM HE. THIS DAY THIS
[1:48:19] SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED. NOW LISTEN THAT
[1:48:22] BECOME FULFILLED WORD WHICH BECOME THE
[1:48:25] HEADSHIP AND THEY COULD NOT RECEIVE HIS
[1:48:28] HEAD.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS HE WAS HEALING, HE WAS THE
[1:48:34] MESSIAH. BROTHER TRAVIS, AS LONG AS HE
[1:48:36] WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD, HE WAS THE
[1:48:38] MESSIAH. BUT THE VERY MINUTE THAT HE
[1:48:40] SAID, "I AM THE WORD.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; I AM THE STANDARD. I AM WHAT ISAIAH
[1:48:46] SPOKE OF," THEY SAID, "HOLD IT NOW. YOU
[1:48:49] GOT A PROBLEM." DO DO YOU REALIZE THINGS
[1:48:51] HADN'T CHANGED THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER?
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; NOTHING HAS CHANGED 2,000 YEARS LATER.
[1:49:00] THEY STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HEADSHIP.
[1:49:04] OH, THEY WERE SHOUTING IN THE FIRST
[1:49:05] POOL. THEY WERE SHOUTING IN JONESBORO.
[1:49:08] THEY WERE SHOUTING. AMEN. OUT THERE IN
[1:49:10] MISS WALKA. THEY WERE SHOUTING ALL OVER
[1:49:12] THE PLACE IN THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL.
[1:49:15] BUT WHEN IT COME TO THAT THIRD PULL,
[1:49:16] WHEN IT COME TO THAT WORD COMING INTO
[1:49:19] AUTHORITY IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, THEY
[1:49:21] SAID, "HOLD IT. WAIT A SECOND." AMEN.
[1:49:24] THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. AMEN. BUT
[1:49:26] I WANT TO READ THIS TO YOU FROM
[1:49:27] REVELATION 10:1. AND I SAW ANOTHER
[1:49:31] MIGHTY ANGEL COME down
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; from heaven,
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS CLOTHED WITH A CLOUD,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; AND A RAINBOW WAS UP ON HIS HEAD, AND
[1:49:42] HIS FACE AS IT WERE THE SUN, AND HIS
[1:49:44] FEET as pillars of fire.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Now, we read that, and how many's ever
[1:49:50] heard that? Amen. I I want to I want to
[1:49:53] take a little moment here this morning
[1:49:54] and establish something. Amen. How
[1:49:57] many's ever heard about a cloud
[1:50:00] appearing? You heard about that? 1965.
[1:50:04] Now, I want to show y'all something.
[1:50:07] This cloud appears. Amen. In 1963,
[1:50:12] I would like to call your attention the
[1:50:13] rise of the sun this morning to a
[1:50:14] picture. Brother Bram walks in there.
[1:50:17] Uh, brother brother Peter, could you
[1:50:18] come here and help me for a second?
[1:50:20] Brother walks in there and I can imagine
[1:50:22] it was something like this. He kind of
[1:50:23] pulled a magazine out.
[1:50:26] He kind of turned that magazine over
[1:50:28] there and he
[1:50:31] he found the place.
[1:50:35] Now, will you Will you do me a favor and
[1:50:37] hold that straight up there?
[1:50:40] He he he let's hold it up where
[1:50:42] everybody can see it. There you go.
[1:50:45] He turns to that in the magazine. Now
[1:50:47] listen folks, this is not a Bible.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; This is not a spoken word book.
[1:50:56] THIS IS A LIFE MAGAZINE IN 1963.
[1:50:59] AND HE HOLDS THIS UP AND SAYS NOW FAKE
[1:51:02] WAS NOW NOW I HEARD THAT BLESS THE Holy
[1:51:04] of my life. He said but HERE THE OTHER
[1:51:05] DAY SCIENCE TOOK THE PICTURE AND HE SAID
[1:51:07] IT WENT IN THE AIR AND HE SAID LIFE
[1:51:09] MAGAZINE PACKED THE PICTURES AND HE SAID
[1:51:11] NOW HERE'S WHAT IT SAID. NOW I TOOK
[1:51:13] TIME. AMEN. BECAUSE RIGHT HERE IF YOU
[1:51:15] WANT TO SEE THIS after church you can.
[1:51:16] How many's ever seen this before? Let me
[1:51:18] see your hand. If you've never seen it,
[1:51:20] if you never seen it, raise your hand.
[1:51:22] No, no, no embarrassment. You've never
[1:51:23] seen it. Okay. 1963,
[1:51:26] Revelation 10:1, "A mighty angel come
[1:51:28] down. A cloud appeared." Okay, THIS IS
[1:51:30] IN LIFE MAGAZINE. AND HERE'S THE
[1:51:32] ARTICLE. HE SAYS, "NOW, AND AND RIGHT
[1:51:35] HERE, HOVERING LIKE A GIANT SMOKE RING,
[1:51:37] A GREAT CLOUD APPEARED AT SUNSET OVER
[1:51:40] FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, LAST February 28th,
[1:51:42] AND SET OFF A CONTINUING SCIENTIFIC
[1:51:45] MYSTERY. WATCHERS STRUCK BY THE CLOUDS
[1:51:48] ODD SHAPE and huge size took pictures
[1:51:50] like these four at different locations
[1:51:52] in the state. DR. JAMES MCDONALD,
[1:51:57] A METEOROLOGIST OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEIC
[1:52:01] UH PHYSICS IN TUCSON HAS BEEN
[1:52:03] ACCUMULATING THE PICTURES. NOW LISTEN,
[1:52:05] USING THEM AS THE BASIS FOR THE
[1:52:08] TRIGONOMETRIC CALCULATION, HE HAS MADE A
[1:52:12] STARTLING DISCOVERY THAT THE CLOUD WAS
[1:52:15] AT LEAST 26 MILES HIGH AND 30 MILES
[1:52:18] ACROSS. IT WAS A LOT HIGHER AND BIGGER.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; OH, I LOVE THAT. IT WAS A LOT HIGHER AND
[1:52:26] BIGGER, HE SAYS, THAN A CLOUD SHOULD BE.
[1:52:28] NOW, THE CIRCLE WAS TOO HIGH TO BE MADE
[1:52:31] A JET PLANE TO BE MADE BY A JET PLANE.
[1:52:34] AND AS FAR AS DR. MCDONALD CAN
[1:52:36] DETERMINE, THERE WERE NO ROCKETS, ROCKET
[1:52:38] PLANES, OR BOMBS BEING TESTED NEARBY
[1:52:41] THAT DAY. HE HOPES THAT ANYONE ELSE WITH
[1:52:44] PICTURES WILL LEND THEM TO HIM. NOW,
[1:52:47] HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO CATCH. FOR HE
[1:52:49] WOULD LIKE SOME MORE CLUES.
[1:52:53] HE WOULD LIKE SOME MORE CLUES ABOUT THE
[1:52:56] CLOUD THAT WAS 26 MILES UP BECAUSE NO
[1:53:00] WATER DROPLETS EXIST AT THAT HEIGHT TO
[1:53:03] MAKE A CLOUD. BROTHER PETER, I'M THE GUY
[1:53:06] THAT HAD TO KNOW WHAT DOES THE WORD
[1:53:08] CLUES MEANS? IT MEANS A PIECE OF
[1:53:10] EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION THAT IS USED IN
[1:53:14] THE SOLVING OF A MYSTERY.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOME
[1:53:19] EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY. AMEN.
[1:53:22] WHAT IS THIS MYSTERIOUS CLOUD THAT
[1:53:24] APPEARED OUT THERE IN SUNSET? HE SAID,
[1:53:26] "IT IS A FACT OR AN IDEA THAT SERVES TO
[1:53:30] REVEAL SOMETHING OR TO SOLVE A PROBLEM."
[1:53:33] WELL, A PROPHET WALKED IN THERE AND HE
[1:53:35] SAID, "NOW, YOU GOT THIS PICTURE AND
[1:53:37] YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT IT WAS."
[1:53:38] AMEN. CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING? HE WENT
[1:53:40] TO JACK MOORE
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; FOR MAN-MADE INTERPRETATION. BROTHER
[1:53:45] JACK, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? AND
[1:53:48] JACK GAVE HIM A MAN-MADE INTERPRETATION.
[1:53:51] WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I THINK IT'S
[1:53:53] THIS. HE SAID, "AND SOMETHING DID NOT
[1:53:55] STRIKE A BAIL."
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But if YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT,
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; IF YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT, NOW THEY
[1:54:04] WERE DOING IT LIKE THIS.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; But if you Now hold it there.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; IF YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT, HE SAID,
[1:54:11] "OH, DO YOU SEE IT?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S HOFFMAN'S HEAD OF CHRIST.
[1:54:16] IT'S OUR LORD UP THERE. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:54:20] THE WORLD WAS LOOKING FOR CLUES. THE
[1:54:23] WORLD WAS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE. THEY
[1:54:25] WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO REVEAL
[1:54:27] WHAT IS SO SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS CLOUD.
[1:54:30] BUT A PROPHET WALKED ON THE PLATFORM AND
[1:54:32] HE TURNED TO REVELATIONS 10. AND HE SAID
[1:54:35] A CLOUD WOULD COME DOWN. IT WOULD BE OUR
[1:54:37] HEADSHIP.
[1:54:38] I GOT TO TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING, OKAY? IF
[1:54:40] there's two pictures we're hated for,
[1:54:42] it's this picture and the pillar of
[1:54:44] fire. PEOPLE
[1:54:47] HATE THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE IN THOSE
[1:54:48] PICTURES, BUT CAN I TELL Y'ALL
[1:54:50] SOMETHING? WE DIDN'T TAKE THEM.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Y'all heard brother WAYNE SAY THAT ABOUT
[1:54:57] THE PILLAR OF FIRE. WE DIDN'T TAKE THAT
[1:54:59] PICTURE. I WAS SITTING THERE LAST NIGHT
[1:55:00] IN MY OFFICE LOOKING AT THIS AND IT JUST
[1:55:02] STRUCK ME. WE DIDN'T TAKE THIS ONE
[1:55:04] EITHER.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; A SCIENTIST TOOK IT.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IF HE WAS ALIVE TODAY, I
[1:55:14] WOULD PHONE HIM UP AND I'D INVITE HIM
[1:55:16] OVER TO BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS, AND I'D
[1:55:18] SAY, "YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CLUES?
[1:55:20] THEY'RE SITTING ON PEWS. YOU WANT TO SEE
[1:55:22] SOME CLUES? THEY'RE SITTING ON PEWS."
[1:55:25] YOU SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" HE SAID,
[1:55:27] "THAT WILL BRING THE REVELATION OF
[1:55:30] MYSTERY BY GOD. THAT'LL BRING THE
[1:55:32] REVELATION OF WATER BAPTISM." OH, I TELL
[1:55:34] YOU THIS MORNING, I'M NOT KICKING MY
[1:55:36] LORD OUT. I SAY IT'S MY LORD OF MY
[1:55:40] HEADSHIP. THANK YOU BUDDY. THAT'S MY
[1:55:43] HEADSHIP AND I AM NOT ASHAMED OF IT.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; He comes down there in that sermon. He
[1:55:49] says, "We little humble group compared
[1:55:51] with all the world. We've enjoyed these
[1:55:53] blessings of hearing those mysteries.
[1:55:55] Marriage and divorce, serpent seed, all
[1:55:58] these different questions." Listen, are
[1:56:01] y'all ready for this?
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Has been completely
[1:56:04] revealed to us. Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Not by a man
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; but by God
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; himself
[1:56:22] that opened those seven mysteries of
[1:56:24] what the church was, how it was in
[1:56:27] Christ at the beginning and how it be
[1:56:30] revealed in the last day. Can I can I
[1:56:31] can I drop one more thing to you?
[1:56:34] He says, "Now, if you turn the picture
[1:56:36] like this, it's Christ.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; See his eyes looking here, just as
[1:56:42] perfect as it could be, wearing the
[1:56:43] white wig of supreme deity, judge of all
[1:56:45] heavens and earth." See,
[1:56:49] do you see my point?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't even make it about himself.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't put confidence in me.
[1:56:58] I'm a man.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; I'm full of mistakes,
[1:57:02] but what I'm saying about him,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; brother Matt. It's what I'm saying about
[1:57:11] him.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He's the one.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I Can I just say this to you
[1:57:16] this morning? I feel the Holy Spirit
[1:57:18] moving right now. It's he
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; the one.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; The devil can tack all But Tim, he can
[1:57:26] tack all the dirty names on us he wants
[1:57:27] to.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Man, followers cult
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; whatever.
[1:57:33] But at the end of the day, show me one
[1:57:35] other preacher that lifted Jesus so
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; high.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Years ago, somebody told me a testimony,
[1:57:45] brother Mark. They said this woman had
[1:57:47] been want to go to brother's meetings
[1:57:48] back in the 40s and 50s, and she didn't
[1:57:50] have enough money to get there, and her
[1:57:52] husband was real real alcoholic. He
[1:57:54] didn't he didn't like the word, didn't
[1:57:55] like church, nothing. Didn't want
[1:57:56] nothing to do with it. So, she saved up
[1:57:58] some money, got enough money to ride
[1:57:59] down one brother's meetings. And she she
[1:58:01] left there and she said, "I'm finally
[1:58:02] getting to go go go to Abraham's
[1:58:04] meetings. I finally get to see him and
[1:58:05] I'm going there." And she come home and
[1:58:07] man, she was she went to meet and she
[1:58:09] come home and she was shouting and she
[1:58:11] was rejoicing and he was sitting over
[1:58:13] there and he said, "Yeah, here comes
[1:58:15] that here comes that man worshiper, you
[1:58:16] know." And she said, "Oh, praise the
[1:58:18] Lord." You know, and he said, "Probably
[1:58:21] about half drunk." He looked over at
[1:58:23] her. He said, "Well, you went down
[1:58:24] there." He said, "What are you so happy
[1:58:25] about? Did you see him?" She said, "No,
[1:58:29] I didn't.
[1:58:31] He said, "Ha, I told you you wasted all
[1:58:33] that money and went down there and you
[1:58:35] didn't see him." She said, "I didn't."
[1:58:37] She He said, "Well, who was down there?"
[1:58:40] She said, "Brother Abraham was there."
[1:58:42] She said, "He was there and he preached
[1:58:44] and had a prayer line and I got to go
[1:58:45] through it." He said, "And you didn't
[1:58:47] see him?" She said, "No, I couldn't." He
[1:58:50] said, "What do you mean?" She said, "HE
[1:58:52] LIFTED JESUS SO HIGH,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; I couldn't EVEN SEE WHO WAS DOING THE
[1:58:56] LIFTING." [applause]
[1:58:59] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I TELL YOU
[1:59:01] THIS MORNING, I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE
[1:59:04] PEERING OF THE LORD. IT'S MY REVELATION.
[1:59:08] IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR.
[1:59:10] YOU SAY, "PREACHER, HOW IN THE WORLD I
[1:59:12] KNOW I'M OUT OF TIME, but I I got I got
[1:59:14] I got to just SAY THIS." BROTHER RAM
[1:59:16] COMES in that 1965 rise in the sun and
[1:59:18] he said, "That is a perfect
[1:59:20] identification again of indication. This
[1:59:22] message is the truth. This is the truth.
[1:59:24] It's true." making him not a third
[1:59:26] person but the only person. He said,
[1:59:27] "And now notice," now this is what I
[1:59:29] want to close on right here. He said,
[1:59:31] "And now notice from him comes this
[1:59:33] light shining on the right hand side
[1:59:37] to which he's looking to and on the
[1:59:40] cross."
[1:59:44] But they Paul that day on Calvary on the
[1:59:47] cross
[1:59:49] he looked to the right
[1:59:52] where he pardoned the sinner.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT A
[2:00:01] PAGE IN A MAGAZINE?" BECAUSE IT WAS IN
[2:00:03] THE BIBLE BEFORE IT WAS IN A MAGAZINE.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LORD JESUS CHRIST APPEARING TO
[2:00:10] SHOW YOU THIS SCRIPTURES FULFILLED. CAN
[2:00:12] CAN I CAN I TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING?
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT
[2:00:16] THIS?" OKAY. WELL, can you all imagine
[2:00:18] with me for just a second that Jesus
[2:00:20] walks in the temple, brother Matt? He's
[2:00:23] sitting there and they hand him a
[2:00:24] scroll. He walks out there. He opens it
[2:00:26] up and he begins to read. He goes over
[2:00:28] to Isaiah. He begins to read Isaiah and
[2:00:30] he says, "This day the scriptures
[2:00:31] fulfilled." and he walks over there and
[2:00:34] he sits down in the Messiah's chair and
[2:00:37] all the eyes of the people are upon him
[2:00:39] and they all get mad and they get full
[2:00:41] of wrath and they come up here and they
[2:00:44] grab him and they lead him out. They
[2:00:47] they they lead him out to the brow our
[2:00:49] Lord Jesus the word made flesh
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; from written word to manifested fulf are
[2:00:54] you with me
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; brother Matt they lead him up to the
[2:00:56] brow of the heel and they throw him out
[2:00:59] by the head
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; trained in the scriptures
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; could twist you up
[2:01:10] could tie you up
[2:01:12] could show you how you shouldn't eat
[2:01:13] meat and wash pots and do all this so
[2:01:16] trained
[2:01:19] And the most trained people
[2:01:22] failed to recognize him
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; and threw him out.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; But the same one they threw out
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; was hanging up on a cross.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS A THIEF HANGING NEXT TO
[2:01:36] HIM ON THE RIGHT.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; AND THE VERY ONE THEY THREW OUT, HE'S
[2:01:42] HANGING THERE NEXT TO HIM. AND AS HE'S
[2:01:44] HANGING THERE IN HIS FINAL BREAST, HE
[2:01:46] SAYS THESE WORDS, "FATHER,
[2:01:49] INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT." IN
[2:01:52] HIS FINAL BREAST, AND THERE'S A SINNER
[2:01:54] THERE, AND HE LOOKS OVER AND HE SAYS,
[2:01:57] "When you come into your kingdom,
[2:02:01] will you remember me?
[2:02:04] When you COME INTO YOUR KINGDOM, WILL
[2:02:06] YOU REMEMBER ME?" YOU SAY, "PREACHER,
[2:02:09] WHY DO YOU PREACH THIS MESSAGE WITH SUCH
[2:02:10] AUTHORITY?" BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING
[2:02:12] THAT CAN GIVE ANYBODY A CHANCE.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; CAN I GET A WITNESS TODAY? WITHOUT THIS
[2:02:19] MESSAGE, YOU WOULDN'T HAD A CHANCE.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS WORD, YOU DIDN'T
[2:02:24] FIT IN SOCIETY. YOU DIDN'T FIT IN
[2:02:26] DENOMINATIONS. YOU DIDN'T FIT IN LITTLE
[2:02:28] GROUPS. BUT THIS MESSAGE OPENED A DOOR.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; It gave you a place. He looks over at
[2:02:36] him and he says, "This day you'll be
[2:02:40] with me in paradise."
[2:02:43] Preacher, what are you saying? I'm
[2:02:45] saying God has sent this message,
[2:02:48] the word of promise to call you out of
[2:02:51] confusion. Rever says this. He says,
[2:02:54] "Now when the calling out time comes
[2:02:57] that you don't belong to any of it. I'm
[2:03:00] very popular to say I'm Pentecost or I'm
[2:03:02] Presbyterian Lutheran. But what about
[2:03:03] when it comes to that time you have to
[2:03:05] come out and stand for the word and say,
[2:03:08] "I don't belong to any of it."
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Will you be embarrassed? Then
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Now, why why would he be
[2:03:16] ashamed of you? Because you're claiming
[2:03:18] to be his
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; and you won't follow him."
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I just leave you this?
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; If you're going to claim to be his,
[2:03:30] follow him.
[2:03:34] Don't throw him out.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Follow him.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come this morning.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; What if I said this little boy, he's my
[2:03:42] son? He turned around and said, "Who? Me
[2:03:44] be your son? What do you think I am?" It
[2:03:46] would embarrass me. It would to your
[2:03:49] son. And that's what's so-called
[2:03:51] Christianity today. If your name is
[2:03:53] denomination, all right, they accept the
[2:03:55] fatherhood of denomination. But when it
[2:03:57] comes to accepting the fatherhood of the
[2:03:58] word of God, Christ, no, they're
[2:04:01] embarrassed. Listen, they don't want to
[2:04:04] say, "I've spoke with tongues."
[2:04:08] They don't want to say, "I've seen
[2:04:09] visions." They don't want to say, "I
[2:04:11] believe in divine healing. Yes, I praise
[2:04:14] the Lord. Yes, I'm free from all this
[2:04:16] organization. I'm not bowing down to any
[2:04:19] of that. I am a servant of Christ." Oh
[2:04:21] my. That would just tear them to pieces.
[2:04:24] But I wonder this morning, is there any
[2:04:27] Christians here?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Is there any word believers here today?
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody can say today, no
[2:04:38] matter the pressure,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; I will not back down.
[2:04:45] If they ban this book from every ever
[2:04:47] every place in this world and tomorrow
[2:04:50] they call for these Bibles to be burnt
[2:04:53] and thrown away, I'll never bow.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; I'll never bend
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; cuz the word has been hid in my heart.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; You know, this morning I I I've I've
[2:05:06] come to this point in the sermon and I
[2:05:08] want to
[2:05:10] I want to bring it down to you like
[2:05:11] this.
[2:05:14] What is your confession today?
[2:05:18] Sometimes I wonder if we don't just and
[2:05:19] I want you to hear me right now.
[2:05:22] Sometimes I wonder if we don't just get
[2:05:24] settled down in the fact we believe the
[2:05:26] message.
[2:05:28] We follow a prophet.
[2:05:31] But David, sometimes I wonder if we get
[2:05:32] settled on that fact and we forget that
[2:05:35] there's a life
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; that goes with it.
[2:05:44] unlike the world.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Don't look like the world.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; See, if you want to look like the world,
[2:05:52] there's a there's a million
[2:05:53] denominational churches.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Folks don't get mad at me,
[2:06:00] but they'll let that makeup get on your
[2:06:02] face.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; They'll let them splits get higher and
[2:06:07] higher in dresses.
[2:06:09] They'll let them back to us.
[2:06:13] And they'll let them title baptisms just
[2:06:14] go right on through.
[2:06:16] Just put just put some money in the
[2:06:18] offering plate.
[2:06:20] See y'all next Sunday.
[2:06:24] But if God turned to you in the right
[2:06:27] with this word and pardoned your life
[2:06:31] and gave you a future by the truth of
[2:06:35] this Bible,
[2:06:37] then [music] don't you think there ought
[2:06:38] to come such a such an ambition to live
[2:06:40] a life above reproach?
[2:06:45] One day I'm going to preach a sermon on
[2:06:47] it.
[2:06:49] The word brings the reproach.
[2:06:52] Don't be the reproach.
[2:06:55] Listen folks, Paul comes there in Acts
[2:06:58] 24:14.
[2:07:00] Now, this is this is Paul
[2:07:03] and he said, "This I confess unto thee
[2:07:06] that after the way which they call
[2:07:07] heresy,
[2:07:09] so worship I the God of my fathers."
[2:07:12] They deemed the way he was worshiping
[2:07:15] heresy.
[2:07:17] And he didn't go hide in the corner,
[2:07:18] Brother David, and say, "You know what?
[2:07:20] I'm just going to I'm just going to hide
[2:07:22] over here and I'm not going to worship
[2:07:23] God and I'm not going to praise him. He
[2:07:26] walked up before me. HE SAID, "THE WAY
[2:07:28] Y'ALL CALL heresy is the way I worship
[2:07:30] the God of my fathers."
[2:07:33] Now, I love this. Believe in all things
[2:07:36] which are written in the law and in the
[2:07:38] prophets.
[2:07:40] Y'all ever y'all ever been in a good a
[2:07:42] good hot meeting and the Holy Ghost get
[2:07:43] to fall and people get to shouting and
[2:07:45] dancing and the preacher get up and say
[2:07:46] in the way they call heresies so worship
[2:07:48] I the God of my father. Glory to God.
[2:07:51] They call us heretics but we worship
[2:07:53] God. Listen, there's a whole lot more to
[2:07:55] that verse than just emotional worship
[2:07:56] folks.
[2:07:58] The reason they were being called
[2:08:00] heretics was not because they're
[2:08:01] shouting and dancing. It was because
[2:08:03] they took a stand and said, "I believe
[2:08:05] everything in that Bible
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; and I believe everything those prophets
[2:08:08] taught."
[2:08:11] You know what that word believing means?
[2:08:13] To place confidence in.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning, would there be
[2:08:17] one here today could say, "Lord, today I
[2:08:21] renew my [music] vow.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; I place my confidence
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; in the presence of this word.
[2:08:29] I hear I hear the word call in my name
[2:08:31] this morning. I hear a calling. I hear a
[2:08:35] calling for more than just a Sunday
[2:08:37] morning service.
[2:08:40] Let me say, Lord, I want to live this
[2:08:43] word.
[2:08:45] Won't you bow your hearts this morning?
[2:08:50] See, heresy, crazy, idiotic. Well, we
[2:08:56] are called that.
[2:08:58] Because the supernatural is so much
[2:08:59] different from the carnal things of this
[2:09:02] world till it makes people think they're
[2:09:05] crazy till it makes people think they're
[2:09:07] mad.
[2:09:10] But I can tell you [music] this morning,
[2:09:13] I've got confidence in his appearing.
[2:09:17] Now, his appearing was doing more than
[2:09:19] just making us feel good. His appearing
[2:09:23] was doing [music] more than just giving
[2:09:26] us a better circle of friends to hang
[2:09:28] with.
[2:09:30] His appearing was bringing his word into
[2:09:32] full effect.
[2:09:34] I [music] wonder this morning if there
[2:09:36] would be one could say, "Lord,
[2:09:39] I want this message,
[2:09:42] every part of it,
[2:09:44] to be in full effect in my life."
[2:09:48] Lord, if there's one area that I'm if
[2:09:51] there's one area that I'm holding back
[2:09:52] from you,
[2:09:54] Lord, I don't want to be like those
[2:09:56] religious people that led you out of the
[2:09:57] synagogue and threw your headship out.
[2:10:00] But, Father, I receive the headship of
[2:10:02] the word today.
[2:10:04] I receive it over my life.
[2:10:06] I receive it over everything about me. I
[2:10:08] receive it over my home. I receive it
[2:10:11] over the books I read, over the music I
[2:10:14] listen to, over the places I go.
[2:10:18] over the things I watch, over the things
[2:10:20] I do. I receive the headship of this
[2:10:23] word [music] over my life.
[2:10:26] Father,
[2:10:27] take things out of my life that's unlike
[2:10:29] you.
[2:10:33] Hallelujah.
[2:10:35] I've ever had bowed every eye closed
[2:10:36] this morning. The Holy Spirit just
[2:10:38] moving right now.
[2:10:40] Hands up all over this building this
[2:10:42] morning. The Holy Ghost is coming by
[2:10:44] right now. The word, the spirit of God
[2:10:47] is honing, cutting this away and cutting
[2:10:49] that away. Oh Lord, I want to have
[2:10:53] confidence in this word.
[2:10:55] Hallelujah.
[2:10:57] Hallelujah. Almighty God,
[2:11:00] maybe there be one sitting here today
[2:11:01] that's losing confidence in this
[2:11:03] message.
[2:11:05] They're losing confidence in the things
[2:11:06] that's been revealed by this prophet.
[2:11:09] Lord, they're losing confidence because
[2:11:11] of associations and communications with
[2:11:15] the spirits of unbelief.
[2:11:17] Father, maybe things in their life are
[2:11:19] beginning to change and standards are
[2:11:21] begin to lower
[2:11:23] because Lord, man-made interpretations
[2:11:25] and traditions and veils of man had
[2:11:28] begun to veil what was unveiled by the
[2:11:30] revealing of the son of man.
[2:11:33] Maybe some here today, Lord, is becoming
[2:11:36] embarrassed of things they believe and
[2:11:38] becoming embarrassed of things they they
[2:11:40] they stood for so long.
[2:11:43] Father, I rebuke that spirit today in
[2:11:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:11:49] Father, as I heard one say just the
[2:11:50] other day, they were telling me how
[2:11:53] embarrassed they were of the way that
[2:11:55] they had raised their children and the
[2:11:57] things they had put them through and the
[2:11:59] things they had taught them. And Lord,
[2:12:01] as I stood there and heard that man say
[2:12:02] that, something just rose up in me. And
[2:12:05] I looked over at him and I said, "Sir,
[2:12:07] you mean to tell me you're embarrassed
[2:12:08] of the way you raised your kids
[2:12:10] [singing] by this message?"
[2:12:12] I said, "Your two daughters over there
[2:12:14] serving God, married to Holy Ghost fil
[2:12:16] men, believe in this word. Your young
[2:12:19] son there belie.
[2:12:25] Oh God, don't ever let that be said
[2:12:27] about one of us, Lord.
[2:12:29] Don't let us ever let Leoa put so much
[2:12:32] pressure upon us that we become [music]
[2:12:34] ashamed of the standards and the truth
[2:12:36] of this end time word of promise.
[2:12:40] Lord, let us bow to you before we bow to
[2:12:42] this world. Lord, let us surrender our
[2:12:45] hearts and our lives into your hands
[2:12:47] before we surrender them into the hands
[2:12:49] of some man-made interpretation.
[2:12:52] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:12:56] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:12:59] Oh, I wonder today with every head
[2:13:00] bowed, every eye closed, we could say,
[2:13:02] "Lord, search my heart today.
[2:13:05] Search my heart today."
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[2:13:12] Lord. Search my heart today.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Wash me today, Lord.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to be like those who
[2:13:22] sit in the temple.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; They saw your word manifested.
[2:13:28] They saw the Messiah and they walked out
[2:13:30] and said, "Oh,
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; he's a crazy man."
[2:13:34] No,
[2:13:36] I want to say hosana.
[2:13:38] Hosanna
[2:13:41] not know.
[2:13:44] Sing it. How
[2:13:47] he came
[2:13:49] to [singing] love
[2:13:51] me so
[2:13:54] he [singing] looked me up.
[2:14:04] soul.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, the pardon grace of God.
[2:14:10] I shall
[2:14:13] forever
[2:14:17] lift
[2:14:19] my eyes to Calary
[2:14:26] to [music] you.
[2:14:28] The cross
[2:14:31] [singing]
[2:14:32] where Jesus [music]
[2:14:34] died
[2:14:36] for me.
[2:14:41] How are [singing]
[2:14:47] the grace
[2:14:49] and
[2:14:51] my falling
[2:14:53] soul?
[2:14:56] He looked [singing]
[2:14:58] beyond
[2:15:02] my [singing] fall.
[2:15:04] It's all I need.
[2:15:17] How many can you testify
[2:15:22] of God
[2:15:27] into [singing and music]
[2:15:29] the light
[2:15:32] where I can [music and singing] clearly
[2:15:39] Is this
[2:15:41] house [music and singing] shall
[2:15:47] the mountain?
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; He looked [singing]
[2:15:58] me up [music]
[2:16:02] all my faults
[2:16:04] and saw my Thank you for the finish as
[2:16:08] we worship you today. I
[2:16:12] shall [music]
[2:16:13] forever
[2:16:17] live
[2:16:19] and I [singing]
[2:16:20] should [music] come
[2:16:25] to [singing and music] you
[2:16:28] cross
[2:16:31] where Jesus [music and singing] died for
[2:16:35] me.
[2:16:40] How [singing] far
[2:16:43] [music]
[2:16:45] the grace
[2:16:47] [singing] called
[2:16:49] my [music] falling
[2:16:51] soul.
[2:16:55] He looked
[2:16:57] beyond
[2:17:00] my faults
[2:17:02] and saw my
[2:17:06] you know this morning you might be
[2:17:08] sitting there wondering said brother
[2:17:10] Andrew why in the world would you take
[2:17:12] time to establish
[2:17:16] something as
[2:17:18] mysterious
[2:17:19] as a cloud that appeared in 63. free.
[2:17:25] Well, you know the prophet of God said,
[2:17:27] he said, "History will repeat itself."
[2:17:31] He said, "What has happened will happen
[2:17:33] again." And do you realize that that
[2:17:36] Moses spoke of the Messiah?
[2:17:39] Isaiah spoke of him. Zachchariah spoke
[2:17:42] of him. You know, Daniel spoke of him.
[2:17:45] You know, Jeremiah spoke of him. The Old
[2:17:48] Malachi spoke of him. Brother Brian, the
[2:17:51] Old Testament is full of prophets that
[2:17:53] were speaking of a coming Messiah.
[2:17:57] Do you know John the Baptist rose up on
[2:17:59] the scene and you know what he said,
[2:18:01] Brother Wesley? He stood there on the
[2:18:03] river and he said, "Behold,
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Behold the Messiah." John spoke of him.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Do you know that same Messiah walked in
[2:18:13] the temple,
[2:18:14] went straight back to the word, and
[2:18:16] [snorts] they threw him out.
[2:18:22] fine. [music] You know, today I can show
[2:18:24] you where Daniel spoke of this cloud.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; I can show it to you in the book of
[2:18:29] Daniel.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; I can show to you in the book of
[2:18:32] Revelation where John saw this cloud
[2:18:34] coming down.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; And I can read you a 100 quotes where a
[2:18:38] prophet come on the scene and identify
[2:18:40] that mysterious cloud was the
[2:18:42] fulfillment of Revelation 10:1.
[2:18:45] And I can show you a thousand churches
[2:18:46] that took it and threw [music] it out.
[2:18:51] Brother Mark, I can say this morning, as
[2:18:53] for Grace Tabernacle,
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; we believe in [music] the appearing of
[2:18:58] the Lord.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; We stand with it.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; We stand with the revelation of his
[2:19:04] presence.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; And there is no devil going to
[2:19:07] intimidate us
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; and back us off of it.
[2:19:11] Listen, I really wish I could, brother
[2:19:14] David. I wish I could phone up that Dr.
[2:19:16] McDonald and call him over here to Black
[2:19:20] Rockck.
[2:19:22] Claim to sit in a service and hear the
[2:19:24] word preached. So, he's looking for some
[2:19:27] clues. Hey buddy, it wasn't a scientific
[2:19:29] mystery.
[2:19:31] It was a spiritual mystery.
[2:19:34] And it was bringing to pass the
[2:19:35] revelation of his word. Listen, this
[2:19:37] message is giving you a place to stand.
[2:19:40] And the devil can't get in anywhere.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; You love him today.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if we could stand on our
[2:19:45] feet as we sing it again today. I shall
[2:19:47] forever lift my
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; I shall [singing]
[2:19:51] forever.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; I wonder who could raise your hands
[2:19:53] today and worship the Lord.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Who lift [singing]
[2:19:57] my [music] life.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, I've heard it a hund
[2:19:59] times."
[2:20:01] Well, you heard it 101 today.
[2:20:04] But it's [music] grace [singing]
[2:20:06] the cross
[2:20:09] [music]
[2:20:10] where Jesus
[2:20:12] died
[2:20:14] for me.
[2:20:19] How one [music] who loves
[2:20:25] who grace
[2:20:27] all [singing]
[2:20:29] my falling [music]
[2:20:31] soul.
[2:20:34] He looked
[2:20:36] beyond
[2:20:40] my
[2:20:42] and saw
[2:20:44] my [music]
[2:20:48] Amen. you love him today. Amen. You
[2:20:50] really love him today. Amen. You [music]
[2:20:52] want to raise your hands and say, "Thank
[2:20:54] you, Lord.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me a revelation.
[2:20:58] Thank you for giving me a place to
[2:21:00] stand. The devil can't come in." [music]

[2:22:05] Thank you Lord for teaching me.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for showing me the
[2:22:09] scriptures.
[2:22:12] Oh Jesus
[2:22:17] I find thee. [music and singing]
[2:22:20] Oh power
[2:22:23] and I
[2:22:25] dream
[2:22:28] of

[2:22:37] Oh, I'm learning
[2:22:40] to live.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "God's willing [music] to
[2:22:42] teach."
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; If you're willing to learn, [singing]
[2:22:46] oh my [music]
[2:22:50] to
[2:22:52] Jesus,
[2:22:56] [music] I find
[2:22:59] more power
[2:23:02] than [music] I ever
[2:23:05] dream.
[2:23:07] I'm learning
[2:23:09] to live
[2:23:11] on Jesus.

[2:23:39] we start digging in these things.
[2:23:41] [music]
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why we do the things we
[2:23:43] do.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why we preach the
[2:23:46] things we preach. There's a reason why
[2:23:48] we stand for the things we stand for.
[2:23:51] Listen, it's the word [music] of God.

[2:24:32] remember us in your prayers. Amen. And
[2:24:34] we'll be back home soon. Amen. God bless
[2:24:37] you, brother [music] Matt. Would you
[2:24:38] come?
[2:24:44] I'm learning [singing]
[2:24:47] to leave.
[2:24:50] Learning [music]
[2:24:52] to live.
[2:24:55] I'm learning
[2:24:57] to live
[2:25:00] on Jesus. [music]
[2:25:05] I need more power [singing and music]
[2:25:10] than I ever
[2:25:12] dream.
[2:25:14] Cuz I'm learning
[2:25:17] to lean [music]
[2:25:19] on Jesus.
[2:25:25] Well, I'm amazed
[2:25:29] that you love [singing] me.
[2:25:32] Oh, I'm amazed
[2:25:35] [music] how you care.
[2:25:39] For your precious
[2:25:42] blood I found [music] pardon.
[2:25:46] And my sins
[2:25:48] are [music and singing] washed. They're
[2:25:50] all washed away.
[2:25:53] My sins [music]
[2:25:55] are washed away.
[2:25:59] Cuz I'm amazed
[2:26:03] that you love me. [music]
[2:26:07] I'm amazed
[2:26:10] how you came. [music and singing]
[2:26:13] Through your preious
[2:26:16] blood, I found pardon. [music]
[2:26:20] And my sins are washed. They're [music]
[2:26:25] all [singing] washed away.
[2:26:28] My sins
[2:26:30] are washed. Amen. I'm not ashamed of it.
[2:26:33] I'm amazed [music] this morning. It's
[2:26:35] true. [singing] There have been days
[2:26:38] that I've failed you.
[2:26:41] Lord, [bell] you know there's many
[2:26:43] [music and singing] times I've gone
[2:26:45] astray,
[2:26:48] but I have learned your love is stronger
[2:26:51] [music and singing] than my every
[2:26:53] weakness.
[2:26:55] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[2:27:00] [music]
[2:27:01] You see, no one else has ever cared for
[2:27:05] [music] me like Jesus. [singing]
[2:27:09] I've never had a friend [music]
[2:27:11] that's been this close to [singing] me.
[2:27:15] So I'm not afraid to face the problems
[2:27:19] [music] of [singing] tomorrow.
[2:27:22] Cuz I know [music] you are everything
[2:27:26] I'll ever need.
[2:27:29] Oh, I'm amazed
[2:27:32] [music]
[2:27:33] that you love [singing] me.
[2:27:37] I'm amazed [music]
[2:27:40] how you care.
[2:27:44] For your preious [music and singing]
[2:27:46] blood I found pardoned.
[2:27:50] For my [music and singing] sins
[2:27:53] are wash. They're all washed away.
[2:27:56] [music and singing]
[2:27:58] My sins

[2:28:04] Yes, I'm amazed.
[2:28:10] Oh, I'm amazed
[2:28:15] how you care.
[2:28:18] [singing] Through your precious [music]
[2:28:21] blood. I found pardon.
[2:28:26] [music] And my sins
[2:28:28] are [singing] washed. They're all washed
[2:28:31] away. [music]
[2:28:33] My [singing] sins
[2:28:35] are washed
[2:28:37] away.
[2:28:41] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[2:28:43] clap of praise this morning? I wonder
[2:28:45] how many can say, "I'm not ashamed of
[2:28:48] the gospel of Jesus Christ." Amen. Jesus
[2:28:51] said, he said, "For whoever is ashamed
[2:28:53] of me and my words, of him, the son of
[2:28:56] man will be ashamed when he [music]
[2:28:57] comes in his own glory and in his
[2:28:59] fathers and in of the holy angels." I
[2:29:02] thought, Lord, don't let me be ashamed
[2:29:04] of you. Don't let me be ashamed to be
[2:29:06] able to stand on the word of God and
[2:29:09] lift it in this hour. And and friends, I
[2:29:12] got news for you. It's a greater, you
[2:29:14] know, brother Andrew [music] was
[2:29:15] preaching about they threw him headlong
[2:29:16] out of the city. Do you realize that the
[2:29:19] that what those men had to face for that
[2:29:21] action today is far worse? Because Jesus
[2:29:24] hung on a cross of Calvary and said,
[2:29:26] "Father, forgive them for they know not
[2:29:27] what they do." But that same man, Jesus,
[2:29:30] when he stood on the earth, he said,
[2:29:31] "You can speak evil against me, and I'll
[2:29:33] forgive you." But there's one coming
[2:29:35] after me. And one word spoken against
[2:29:37] him will not be forgiven you in this
[2:29:39] world or in the world to come. It's a
[2:29:41] far greater far greater thing [music]
[2:29:44] today to reject the word of God. I think
[2:29:47] my here is this is the age of of the
[2:29:50] rapture. That's why God sent a message
[2:29:52] in this hour is to turn [music] the
[2:29:54] hearts of the children back to the faith
[2:29:56] of their fathers. Amen. That's what God
[2:29:58] has done in this hour. I can just say
[2:30:00] this this morning. I know it's drawn
[2:30:02] late. But friends, don't reject the
[2:30:04] message because some fanatics in this
[2:30:07] world have deified a prophet of God and
[2:30:10] made him a deity and worship and all
[2:30:12] this goofy stuff that people do. Don't
[2:30:14] [music] reject the truth or the reality
[2:30:16] of a beautiful thing that God has sent
[2:30:18] in this hour, which was the grace of
[2:30:20] God. And [music] and the very purpose of
[2:30:22] it was to redeem God's children back to
[2:30:24] him. Don't reject that because of
[2:30:27] fanaticism. [music]
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; You can reject the fanatic
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; and accept the message.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it wasn't I know this. They
[2:30:36] say you're lifting up a man and all
[2:30:37] this, but friends, I got news for you.
[2:30:39] There's never been a man. I've listened
[2:30:41] to hundreds and hundreds [music] of
[2:30:43] ministers in my lifetime. I'm a big
[2:30:45] studier uh of ministers. I've listened
[2:30:48] to every every proclaimed minister there
[2:30:51] was over over years of my life. and that
[2:30:55] was supposed to have a gift and people
[2:30:56] that claimed to be prophets and claimed
[2:30:59] to be gifted of God. And I've never
[2:31:01] heard a man that ever preached like
[2:31:04] William Brandham. There's never a man
[2:31:07] that's ever preached that lifted Jesus
[2:31:09] higher than [music] that man ever lifted
[2:31:11] him. No man lifts Christ. I it's so easy
[2:31:14] to see through men when they go and
[2:31:16] preach and and and edify themselves and
[2:31:19] you you you can just tell listening to
[2:31:21] them if they they want the glory and
[2:31:23] they're building up a kingdom for
[2:31:24] theirel and that one man you'll never
[2:31:26] hear that one time he did nothing but
[2:31:28] lift Jesus Christ. So when somebody says
[2:31:30] you're lifting him up, it ain't me
[2:31:32] lifting him up. It was God that lifted
[2:31:34] him up because Jesus said if I be lifted
[2:31:36] up I will draw all men unto me. and he
[2:31:39] lifted him so high that God elevated him
[2:31:41] to a platform to lift Jesus. Therefore,
[2:31:45] we are not ashamed of the gospel of
[2:31:47] Jesus Christ. I can do just what that
[2:31:49] man said. There ain't nothing greater
[2:31:51] than this Bible. There's no greater book
[2:31:53] that's ever been written. It is God. It
[2:31:55] is God in in letter form. [music] But it
[2:31:58] ain't just left in letter. It's became a
[2:32:00] living reality in the age that we're
[2:32:02] living in. And the purpose of that
[2:32:04] ministry was to bring this Bible back to
[2:32:06] life so that you had something to be
[2:32:08] able to stand for. That it wasn't just a
[2:32:11] God of history. Amen. But God is alive
[2:32:13] today. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? I
[2:32:16] Brother Wayne preached a wonderful
[2:32:18] message on it here a few months or weeks
[2:32:21] ago when he was in the tent meeting. I
[2:32:22] believe it was Brother [music] Wayne and
[2:32:24] said, "If you had to go and stand on
[2:32:26] trial and to prove that Jesus was alive
[2:32:28] today, what would you use to [music]
[2:32:29] prove it?" You think about it. What
[2:32:32] church? It couldn't be your church.
[2:32:34] Couldn't be the bishop. It couldn't be
[2:32:36] the founder and no, it couldn't be no
[2:32:38] denomination. Nothing you could have
[2:32:40] that you could prove it. It would have
[2:32:41] to be a living reality because Jesus
[2:32:44] said, "The works that I do shall you do
[2:32:45] also." So that's the only way you would
[2:32:48] find that [music] he was alive today. It
[2:32:50] was the works that he done. And you know
[2:32:52] what? They persecuted Jesus in that day
[2:32:54] for his works. Remember he said, "Why do
[2:32:56] you stone me? For which of these works
[2:32:57] do you stone me? I've raised the dead.
[2:32:59] I've healed the sick. I've I've g gave
[2:33:01] I've I've I've opened the eyes of the
[2:33:03] blind caused the lame to walk.
[2:33:06] Says, see, it wasn't because [music]
[2:33:08] something bad that he done. It was good
[2:33:09] that he done. And that's why Satan hates
[2:33:12] it.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Because the works that I do show you do
[2:33:14] also. It identifies the presence of
[2:33:16] Jesus Christ. [music] And it allows
[2:33:18] believers today to be a fulfillment of
[2:33:21] what Jesus said would happen in this
[2:33:23] age. And that's why [music] Satan
[2:33:25] attacks it so much. But friends, I got
[2:33:26] news for you this morning. We're going
[2:33:28] to fulfill it anyway. You realize that
[2:33:30] everybody is fulfilling scripture. Can I
[2:33:32] say that to you? Everybody in the world
[2:33:35] is fulfilling scripture. God bless you.
[2:33:37] Amen. Take that with you. Everybody's
[2:33:39] fulfilling scripture. But the question
[2:33:40] is, what scripture are you fulfilling?
[2:33:42] Somebody's going to persecute.
[2:33:44] Somebody's going to scoff. Somebody's
[2:33:46] going to mock. Somebody's going to make
[2:33:48] fun. And there's somebody's going to
[2:33:49] believe it. Somebody's going to
[2:33:51] Somebody's going to go through
[2:33:52] tribulation. And somebody's going to
[2:33:54] make a rapture. We're all fulfilling
[2:33:55] scripture. The question is just what
[2:33:57] scripture are you fulfilling? Amen. I
[2:34:00] don't know about you, but I want to find
[2:34:01] all of them that pertained to the
[2:34:03] believer in this last stage and say,
[2:34:04] "Lord, let me be that. Let me be the
[2:34:07] believer." Amen. You love the Lord this
[2:34:08] morning. Amen. It's [music] just such a
[2:34:10] privilege. How many enjoyed that message
[2:34:12] this morning? Amen. [applause]
[2:34:14] Appreciate the service. Amen.
[2:34:18] I I love it when you can stand behind a
[2:34:21] man and not wonder what he believes.
[2:34:23] Amen. There's too many people have to
[2:34:25] wonder. We don't have to wonder what we
[2:34:26] believe. We We just put it out there. It
[2:34:28] ain't no secret. We just put it out
[2:34:30] there. We believe it. We love the Lord
[2:34:32] with all of our heart. And I believe
[2:34:33] that one day that this world will no
[2:34:36] longer be here. I believe that what the
[2:34:37] Bible said about it will take place. And
[2:34:39] I believe there'll be a bride that'll
[2:34:41] leave this earth and go into a rapture.
[2:34:42] And I look forward to being a part of
[2:34:44] it.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[2:34:47] Let's just bow our heads. Gracious
[2:34:48] heavenly father, Lord, we thank you Lord
[2:34:50] for a wonderful word. And Lord, I just
[2:34:53] thank you for our brother just opening
[2:34:55] up his heart and speaking what was on
[2:34:57] his heart this morning. Lord, what a
[2:34:59] encouragement to the believers. And God,
[2:35:02] to be able to identify you in this age,
[2:35:04] Lord, what a what a a powerful There's
[2:35:07] nothing more powerful, Lord, than to be
[2:35:09] able to identify you, to know that
[2:35:11] you're not just a God of history, but
[2:35:13] Lord, we can we can look around the room
[2:35:15] and see you operating in people's lives,
[2:35:17] Lord, and living and walking and working
[2:35:19] among your church today. Lord, we just
[2:35:21] thank you for this word. Lord, I thank
[2:35:23] you for a body of believers, Lord. And
[2:35:25] God, I thank you for coming and
[2:35:27] restoring our faith back to your word
[2:35:29] again in this hour, Lord. I ask you that
[2:35:31] you would go with each one as we leave
[2:35:33] this place, Lord. Keep your hands upon
[2:35:34] them, Lord. And we come back rejoicing
[2:35:37] in thy word [music]
[2:35:38] on Wednesday. And we just thank you for
[2:35:40] all you do for us now in Jesus Christ's
[2:35:42] name. Give our brother strength, Lord,
[2:35:43] for his labor. We pray in [music] Jesus
[2:35:45] name. Amen. God bless you this morning
[2:35:48] as you go.
