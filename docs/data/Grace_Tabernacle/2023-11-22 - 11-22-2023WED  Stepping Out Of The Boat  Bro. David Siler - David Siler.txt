say praise the Lord tonight amen if you have your Bible with us we want to just turn to the scripture with you the Book of Matthew chapter 14 tonight we want to say uh bless you we greet you in the name of the Lord great honor to be here with you this evening I want to go go to the Book of Matthew chapter 14 we're going to look at verse 22 and then we're going to I want to read to you a statement out of question and answers in 1964 Matthew Chapter 14 verse 22 i' like to speak to you this evening something very simple something just to encourage your faith for a few minutes tonight on stepping out of the boat Matthew chapter 14 and straightway Jesus strange as disciples to go into a ship and to go before him and to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship now was in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of of the night now remember because they've come under Roman dictatorship they actually divided the watches of the night into fourth and the fourth one is the last watch of the night which runs from around 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. so it's the darkest moment of the night and the Bible says in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and pet Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and Jesus said not 500 scriptures not 500 quotes but he gives him one word sometimes all we need to be able to overcome is just one word and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus let's just buy our hearts tonight if we could just to ask the Lord to bless the reading of the word bless our service this evening Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord to be able to come and be gathered together in your name tonight and Lord we just look to you now and ask that you would just come and Minister To Us by Your Word you see the things tonight Lord that is Upon My Heart Lord the Simplicity of it I pray Lord that it would build faith in the heart of your people we know Lord that when you come by great things can happen so help us tonight Lord to take our humanity and our mortality may we surrender it to you Lord that you could have your way and that your will would be done I ask now Lord that you would take control of this service May the Holy Spirit Come may you just bring Liberty among us tonight bless our gathering together we'll give you the Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you tonight you can be seated I'm going to read to you a statement out of questions and answers 1964 where the Prophet is actually dealing with this this thought tonight of looking at Peter stepping out of the boat and he's talking about the human part of our um genetic makeup of who we are and he said there's actually six senses in the human body because he is the number of six in the Bible he was created on the sixth day he is the number six he's got SE taste SM feel smell hear and then Faith now listen to the way he says this his faith sets his destination his faith sets his destination where he's headed for for and now Faith is the substance faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear but by faith when he catches the word I love this quote by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him till it's just as good as he's got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen we know because of the day that we're living in and the time period that we're living in now that our faith is going to be tested more than it ever has in the history of the world no other people that has ever served God people that has had to live for God has had to deal with so much demonic influence as what we deal with in this day and we realize because of the faith that we Proclaim we realize that our belief today is is truly going to be tested and Satan is going to send every demon that he can and we know that he's going to send every imp every disease every sickness everything that he hell has to offer he's going to send it against us because of the day that we live in now and we see the effects of that today because of the turmoil the turmoil that's taking place not only in our nation but even around the world that there's wars and rumors of wars there's all time of things that's going on people's minds are scattered all types of sicknesses disease that's plaguing not only our nation that's plag in our world and not only do we see it upon the global scene we see it upon the national scene today as the bomb has went off upon the Border people's nervous about it being a holiday weekend what what type of terrorism what is that what is Terrorism it's Satan sending the spirit of fear to try to get people captivated of what's going to happen in the day that we're living in but I'll remind you that Jesus has not given us the spirit of fear but he's given us the spirit of peace and joy and of a sound mind so Satan is going to do everything he can to keep our minds running all kinds of directions and I thought of this dealing living in a day where we deal with so much trouble we deal with so much stress that's going on all types of sicknesses people sick all the time and I thought about this tonight and I know this is going to hit you strange it's going to kind of hit your mind odd but just give me a few minutes before you judge it but whenever I think about sicknesses troubles diseases things that plagues Humanity many of the very things that's going on in the world when I was young I never would have dreamed that many of the things that the people of the world deal with that we as Christians deal with the same thing we got trouble in our homes trouble in our families trouble in our churches many of the same things that plagues human plagues us as Christians because of the type of life that we live in our mortal realm but you realize because we live in this type of a world we will be affected by but I thought about this today as I was studying this and I thought I'll just present it to you in this way I personally and I know this is going to sound so strange but I personally would love to have the ability to be able to walk on water I told you was going to hit you strange I would love to have the ability to be able to walk on water now when I say that you think that may sound crazy but I just want to preface it with this tonight I'm not talking about a river I'm not talking about a lake I'm not talking about a pond I'm talking about life itself and many different places the prophet would take and he would show us that life is like a sea and he tells us that a sea is unstable that a sea is uncertain and that's the way that life is and the way that the sea is many times that's the way our life is sometimes there's waves sometimes there's calm Waters sometimes there tumultous sometimes it's trouble Waters but remember it is uncertain the way that life is and it's always moving water is always moving and it's being tossed to and fro and brother Ram says a lot of times upon the sea that a storm will come up upon the waters and a storm will cause the waters to go into a frenzy and the wind will come down and whip up on top of the sea and it'll cause that sea to become unstable and that's the age that we're living in now it is a day of uncertainty it's an age of uncertainty and because we're living in this kind of a day I want to have the ability whenever life is a wave and it's all types of tumultous problems and sickness and troubles and diseases I want to personally have the ability to be able to walk on that water we know that David tells us in the Book of Psalms chapter 27 he says that we are going to come into a day where it's going to be a time of trouble and brothers sisters those things is not things that are to be we are living in that day it is a day of trouble and there has never been troubles like there is today there has never been more problems than what you and I are dealing with now and I want to tell you tonight and I trust that this can move on even on end to the New Year we're coming to the end now as the holiday season is here but I want to tell you we cannot expect for 2024 if the Lord will carar or 2025 if the Lord would carry we cannot expect the Seas to be calm you cannot expect to have calm Waters you cannot expect those days of calm Waters of being able just to float along sit around around the church for a few weeks few months few years and somehow make it I want to tell you if you stay in the house of God you're going to be tried every service that you C because if Satan can't keep you from coming here he'll do everything he can to keep your mind tore up keep your spirit tore up keep the church tore up he'll try to all take everything in the service the instruments the song reading whatever it might be to try to keep our mind on everything but the word of God the seeds will no longer be calm the days of calm Waters it is over as a matter of fact it's going to get worse and worse and worse it's because we're living in a day of contrary our government is contrary the people of the world is contrary the waters are rough the waves are high say Amen somebody people themselves are unstable psychiatrist are trying to find psychiatrist doctors are trying to look for doctors because they don't know who they are and they're trying to face things that they're not qualified to be able to face because it's not natural sicknesses that people are dealing with but it's demon out of hell that is coming against them that is plaguing their minds and plaguing their spirit and doctors and psychiatrists themselves are dealing with many of other things and they don't know where to turn oh but thank God we may be pled with that but we got a place to turn tonight we've got somebody that can Hallelujah somebody that can help us in the middle of trouble and the middle of a storm we got somewhere that we can go the doctors don't have the answer your government don't have the answer Donald Trump don't have the answer Joe Biden certainly ain't got the answer he don't even know who he is but you and I know who the answer is and the answer is Christ with nobody else can help you and nobody else can take you and Lead You Out Jesus said I'll be with is you even in you amen until the end of the world I want to have the ability to walk on water I'm talking about trouble I'm talking about stress I want to have the ability to walk over sicknesses walk over cancer walk over diabetes walk over back trouble head trouble family trouble Church trouble I want to have the ability to walk on the water we may not be able to stop stop the waves we may not be able to stop the storms but if I could walk on the water I'm not going to ask God to calm the waters Jo Lord just give me the ability to walk on it I don't want to be tossed like the rest of the world I don't want to walk and be sunk like the rest of the world I want to walk over what other people are sinking in amen I want to walk amen what other people fall here I want have the ability to be able to walk on it well why sink to the bottom when you got power to walk on it why sink when you know the one that created the water why sink when you know the one that God gave the authority to give you the power to be able to walk over why put up with it when you can walk over it and our setting tonight is that kind of a situation once again it's a tremendous storm on the Sea of Galilee and the Sea of Galilee has some of the greatest storms in the Middle East and the disciples happen to be in the boat and they're Crossing this sea and now they have left and they've been in the water oh my what would just be just a little trip to be able to get across but because of the water moving because of the Waves being so high that the disciples what would only take a few minutes it's taken them most of the night and now here they are in the midst of the waters and they can't make it by themselves to the other side I'll just say it again you can't make it by yourself to the other side it is the darkest hour the prophet tells us it is the fourth watch anybody hear me I said it's the darkest time it's the darkest age it's the darkest hour and here the storm is coming against God's people here is God's elect oh I hope you're hearing me tonight this is God's elect that is in this boat these ain't just another fishermen these ain't just another people that Satan is coming against these are the disciples whom Jesus loves these are the on Amen who's been handpicked by Jesus those that he cares about those that he loves that's the ones that's in the boat the storm did not come from Jesus Jesus this is not Jesus that's causing these problems anybody hearing me I said the world's problems ain't caused by the Lord don't make him the author of it don't make my daddy the author of tornadoes don't make him the author of hurricane that ain't God's doing that's the devil's doing Jesus is not trying to see how much Faith they have he's not testing them but the author of this storm the prophet tells us and it is I be not afraid it is the devil so he's taking an advantage he sees an opportunity that the disciples has now went into this boat and they've left Jesus behind and Jesus ain't there and Satan has tried his best you know as long as Jesus was with them Satan has sent was all types of storms upon the sea and whenever the storm would come up the storm would always fail because Jesus was with them whenever Jesus is there the wind begins to cease to move amen and the water can go calm so as long as Jesus is there he can speak to the wind he can speak to the waves he can stop it but now here's the men that Jesus has chosen these are handpicked disciples they are his elected and Satan has called he has seen them as they have now went without Jesus being in the ship the disciples are crossing the water and brother R said they left Jesus is behind remember they are not Crossing this water by their own choosing they are not crossing the water because they decided to do this this is not something that they come together and then you know they consult well I think what we'll do is we're going to do it our way this is not their decision this ain't even their will Jesus is the one that told them to get into the boat Hallelujah I said if Jesus is the one that calls us he'll take care of us when we get there amen so they are crossing this water and when the waters were so choppy and they got so rough and Peter and the disciples many of being fishermen they've been upon that se their entire life but they've never come into waves like this they've never seen oh my in their whole life they have never seen trouble the way they're seeing it now and the prophet said they got scared right we can't look down at them we cannot look down at them one bad report from the doctor we get scared first sign of the flu we get scared first sign of a cough we get scared what is it it's Satan causing the tumultous waters to be able to raise up what does it cause among us fear notice he says in 1961 when all hopes was gone and the little boat was pitched like a bottle stoer out there when 10,000 Devils when 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they would drown that night cuz they'd gone off without him and that's exactly listen That's what Satan says today so Satan is saying the same thing today as what he said whenever he seen the disciples without Jesus and here you and I are living upon the waters and he's telling the same thing to us as what he said that day what is he saying about these he knows they're a threat to his kingdom he knows they've been casting they have been commissioned and given authority to cast out devils and they know Satan knows they are a threat to his kingdom and may I say for you that believe the word you that stand for the word of this day you are a threat against every devil out of hell and Satan will do everything he can to try to stop you he'll cause waves of sickness he'll cause waves of discouragement he'll cause waves of Doubt to come by to do what try to get you to fear Satan knows if I can get the disciples to fear if I can shake him up just enough and I can stir up enough fear he knows that as long as fear is present that faith is paralyzed no matter how much Faith they have no matter how much word they have no matter how much truth they have if an individual possesses some type of a fear faith and fear are opposite to one another faith cannot move in the presence of fear do you know that Satan can't stop our God he can't stop his word he can't stop truth he can't stop it from being revealed amen Satan can't stop God and I want to tell you as long as you believe that he can't stop you either but if we allow a little bit of fear to come up it paralyzes and it handcuffs Faith so he catches them oh think about your life he catches them at a vulnerable moment he catches them at a weak spot when you're down when you're a little bit discouraged he uses sicknesses and diseases to bring fear and despair to try to make us doubt God and try to get your faith to doubt God's word he'll put a devil on every wave that is around you the prophet tells us in perfect Faith he said there was a demon that was riding on every wave every wave and I want to tell you in life every wave that comes by your home every way that comes by the church it's Satan trying to cause a panic and a fear to come upon us to paralyze our faith think about it he will do everything he can to sink your boat sir but I want to tell you what Satan don't know is is when he sent the disciples out the Bible said he went into a high mountain apart to pray and while they was yet on the scene he was watching over that boat Hallelujah they may have been a long ways away they may have been seven angels away but I want to tell just as clear as he can see them in Ephesus he can see them in Samara theara Philadelphia all the way over until Lea in the Fourth Watch of the night Hallelujah and whenever he sees the boat taken on water and he sees the boat filling up Jesus don't remain where he was but he fulfills his promise that I'll be a present help during the time of trouble and here come Jesus walking over every demon he come walking over every wave he come walk walking over every trouble hey man he come walking right down to where they was at you know why he's watching over them sir here's my message just for a moment aloh we can either sit in this boat or you can get up and walk on the water now listen I can't think of nothing better and I think about this for my church as well I can't think of nothing better that I would want but not just a pastor walking on water not just Ministry walking on water but I can't think of nothing better than a whole church walking on water can you imagine that you possess a church that has the ability amen whenever Trouble Comes and Trials Come they've got the ability Amen to walk on the water a whole body a whole church even young people moms and dads walking on the [Applause] water brother I need to know if that's going to be me I need to know how to do it look up and say Lord if that be you I just need you to bid me to come walk on the water you know what Peter was saying when he said that he's letting the lord lord it's not safe in this boat no more listen I'm going to say this and I don't say this to be negative God knows my heart I don't but do you realize God has brought us to the place where we ain't got no choice you have no choice whether you want to walk on it or not let me tell you why this nation is going down so here is Peter and he says Lord I wherever you're at that's where I want to be at I want to walk on what you're walking on so Peter looks up and sees the Living Word he sees the message of the hour he sees the living Christ and he says that's what I want to be that's what I want to do the same way man the same works that you're doing Lord I want to do the same thing that you're doing but how in the world can we do it if we don't call to him amen Jesus walks on the water and Peter says Lord if that's you just B me to come and Jesus brother all Peter needed to hear was one word let me ask you what do you need to hear is it going to be a special serice on service on Sunday morning is it going to be a special meeting that you have certain special preacher that comes by what's it going to take to get you to walk on water certain sermon favorite scripture favorite quote what's it going to take for you to walk on water what do you need to hear what kind of an ear do you need to be able to hear oh my what has to happen to get your attention think about it does the nation have to shut down does some type of plague got to come in where it shuts the government down it shuts the everything down and they hardly no food left what's got to happen in 2024 to get your attention seriously what else would have to happen to wake us up how bad does it have to get how how tall does the waves have to get I don't want to offend you but I got to say this it's one thing to come and sit on the boat but it takes somebody that's moving into a dimension that has seen by F AI H that has moved to a sphere that has put them in another dimension that they know that that whenever they step out of that boat they're going to walk on the water I want to tell you I know I understand it's one thing that's set in the boat but the problem is we got too many people hunkered down the boat they're laying in the bottom of the boat they're laying in the bottom of the boat how can you walk on the water if you never stand up let me tell you why people Hunker in the boat they got more confidence in temporal than they do eternal absolutely it don't take a spiritual person to sit in boats come on anybody can do that anybody can go to church anybody can sit on a Pew anybody can pack a Bible R anybody can carry message books anybody can put a picture on the wall come up but it takes somebody who is serious with God that when the boat is rocking and it's Topsy tury and it looks like it's going to go over and about that time everybody else is hugging on the boat but not you you're standing up in the middle of the that ball you're standing right up in the middle of Hallelujah everything else is going on there you are standing in the ball I'm talking about standing in the middle of a test standing in the middle of trouble standing in the middle of sickness you're going to stand up and say Lord if that be you did me to come and walk on the water why why David S why do you you think sometimes the safest place is in the boat I wrote that for me why do we put more faith in boats than we do Walking With Jesus I I know why because it feels like because it's natural and we can put our hands on it feel so real feel so real I know this water's in my hands I can feel it but do you realize that faith is more real than that bottle in your hand faith is the substance Faith ain't a substance it's the substance faith is just as tangible as this platform that I'm standing on you realize what happens is we put Faith listen now we put more faith in material things than we do Jesus we put Faith in natural things like bank accounts good jobs nice homes nice cars family friends those are things to be valued but what's more important than any of that walking on water do you realize your faith can never be tested the way that it needs to be tested if you're just a boat sitter if that's all we do is just hunker down the boat how can we be what the word has ordained us to be if we're just sitting in the boat Peter would have never walked on the water had he had his hands on the boat do not let the devil talk you into staying in a sinking boat don't allow him to tell you that this world's going to continue to go on and good old USA is going to March oh no it's not it's already been propes side by the last Vision it'll be nothing but caters and Ashes don't stay in the boat the boat's sinking I think the safest place is Walking With Jesus the safest place ain't the boat safest place ain't security of the world the safest place ain't your comfort zone the safest place ain't Le osia it ain't the church it's walking on water how many times do we get hunkered down to the boat and a billow comes up and hits the side of that boat and M turns the boat around slaps that you're soaking wet you don't know what's going on you don't know when the next one's going to hit and you got your head down the boat you got your eyes closed and you got your hands on that wood and all you're doing is is hanging on and putting up with whatever comes against the boat let me say it like this you're only dealing with what Satan's handing out which means you're on the defense and you're not on the offense you're hoping it gets better I hope this gets better I hope our nation gets better it's not going to the prophet said you could put an Abraham Lincoln on every corner he said she Ascend her day of Grace 1959 the prophet said I predict either America will accept the word or they reject it and I predict that she will reject it ain't going to get better Oh Glory ain't coming back but oh glory is coming back hey man Oh Glory the stakes ain't coming back but the king of glory he's coming [Applause] back I've been guilty of holding on to the boat can you handle that I've been guilty of hanging on I've been guilty of hoping the storm goes away preach somebody I need more than hope I need more than a hope so I need a faith to stand up yes sir and step out the boat we get so much confidence in this boat I'm just preaching we get so much confidence in the boat you know what we do we start bailing water because we're trying to save that which we feel I know I'll feel better if I get some of this water out my boat so we start bailing water because if I can save this boat if I can save this boat I got the ability to save myself anybody hear me so we think by human abilities that we can save ourselves if we can tread enough water if I can just pray enough if I can fast enough if I can read enough if I can clean myself up and stop doing this and stop doing that I can get myself good up I can get enough water out of this boat you'll never do it amen because it's going to take more than your abilities listen to me it's going to take more than human ability it's going to take a six sense to get us out of here you believe that we will die if we continue to sit in the boat you know why there's more water coming in than what you can bail out it's impossible to keep the bat to float without faith it's not going to do it it's let me tell you what I mean by that you cannot go into the Rapture without faith what the prophet say it was rapturing Faith but he didn't just preach rapturing Faith he also preached rapturing Grace you know what Grace is it ain't got nothing to do with you it ain't got nothing your abilities it ain't how big your bucket is it Ain how big your Bor is it has everything to do with what Jesus can do for you Grace is a free gift from what he's gave to you I say we need to stand up say Lord if that's you the ores are broke the boat's filling up the prophet said the sails is broke amen and people's hanging onto the boat I believe we're living in a time as I heard the prophet say it today in perfect Faith he said that the bride's recognizing who she is it's time for the bride to stand up in the middle of this boat and step out it's time that we let this faith that we've been hearing preached about and talked about and reading about it's time for that faith not to just be dormant Faith but it's got to be active Faith it's time we let our faith amen put it into action and get out the boat and start walking it's imperative it's imperative if it's no longer safe our families ain't safe our children ain't safe come on the ORS is broke you can't move the storm ain't going away there's only one answer step out the boat understand when Peter sees Jesus listen to this it's set up in such a way that whenever Peter looks and he's got to have his eyes focused because the first thing he thinks is is the way you and I think which is his Humanity they think it's a spirit but there must have been something about Peter's faith that when Peter is looking at this figure that is on the water that something happens to him and his eyes becomes illuminated in the middle of the night in the fourth watch when it's the darkest time his eyes become illuminated and he believes this is Jesus so in the darkest time Peter sees him in the time of trouble when the waves is coming against him Peter opens his eyes and he sees who it is listen now after he recognizes who's here after he recognizes who's here the Mighty God is unveiled before us it is the rising of the sun when he recognizes who it is this Revelation did something to him it literally causes an Awakening inside of Peter when Peter's eyes becomes illuminated something happens on the inside of Peter and it actually takes and his faith is moved into another dimension it's moved into a higher sphere where it moves Peter to speak he ain't crying he ain't balling he ain't whimpering he speaks look friends this is where we're at today faith has been restored by the message of Malachi 4 it's in this day that God is calling us to a higher realm than what we ever have been and we cannot sit in the boat and keep our eyes upon on way come on somebody we cannot sit here and keep our eyes on trouble and our eyes on sicknesses I'm letting you know Jesus has been watching over you he's watched over you since the day you was born he watched over you when you was just an adolescent he watched over you when you sat on the bar stol and he's still watching over you [Applause] today he's done his part he's done his part he's been with you he's protected you he's kept his hand up you he's done his part but now Peter Peter you've got to look and let your faith come to recognition let there be an Awakening on the inside to pull you to a higher sphere we need to let this space that we've been hearing since we was children to allow this Revelation to be put into action it's time that we step out of this boat and start walking on things that's troubled us walk on things that scared us something within Peter raises up listen to me the storm the storm that he had his hands on the bottom of the boat but now he's not in the Bott boat the wave that would bring fear to his Spirit now Peter is moved and it causes him to stand up and Peter is moved from just being a boat sitter till now he's going to say something Hallelujah the storm has moved his faith to where he feels he can say something he could ask anything in his name something moves him that's what we need to do we need to open up our mouths and start speaking what needs we have we got to get so fed up with bailing water that it moves our faith into action it moves us into that sphere that Commission of speech amen and I want to tell you Peter says Lord Lord ruler Messiah if that's you bid me to come on the water let me tell you what I like about this story in the middle of the greatest waves and the greatest trouble Jesus didn't remain quiet aren't you glad he don't remain silent in the middle of the storm Jesus didn't remain quiet in the middle of troublesome Waters but it was during that time oh my it didn't take 50 Scriptures it didn't take 50 quotes all it took was one word from Jesus Christ think about that the word Christ give Peter The Authority they get all he needed was one word and it give him a present tense Authority where Peter can step out of this smoke come right on out here at Peter friends I hope you can hear it tonight I believe that he's calling to you and I from the midst of the waters he's calling to bid me come come right on out here come on young person come on Mama come on well I've got this many mistakes I've done this wrong come on out here on the water if you've been sick come on if you've been down come on if you've been depressed come on out here on the water and walk with me a little while I can see Peter I can see him in my mind I can see that that boat it's moving just as much as it ever did it didn't stop the waves it didn't stop the water it didn't stop the boat from filling up Peter standing in the middle of this boat yes sir and about that time Peter gets on the side that boat and he goes to feels like a board down there come on somebody feels like a board down there don't feel like water to me I've been on water I'm swim in water I'm sinking water but I'm not sinking [Applause] now Brother David I I know Jesus can do it but this is me I mean I know brother Ram can speak to but this is me I mean I know the pastor can the ministry can but this is me you've already sunk you've already sunk that's your mindset that you've already sunk that is not Faith it's not hope so it's not maybe it's not a might be faith is the substance something's solid something's anchored something's moving it ain't hoping that I walk it ain't hoping that it happens Jesus said to come and I'm coming had Peter questioned the water he would have never have stepped out but I'm telling telling you it pulls Peter into a higher realm than see tastes feel smelling here and now he's moving by that six sense that's why he puts his leg over the boat had Peter had some of our thinking well I mean what if it don't happen it ain't with that thought what if I don't make the Rapture what if I'm Not Elected what if I'm not predestinated your faith has got to be anchored in the revelation of the hour that nobody else if nobody else in this building is going to get out of this boat I don't care if there ain't one more person there may not be one more teenager there may not be one more preacher but I want to tell you I myself are not staying in this boat if this boat's going down I'm not staying here if the world is falling apart I'm not falling apart with it I'm stepping out of all I want everybody to make it but there's one person I got to make sure that he makes it it ain't my mom it ain't my dad it ain't my brother but it's me oh Lord that's standing in the need of prayer I want to step out of this boat the storm didn't change at all listen to me listen to this thought the storm didn't change nothing on the outside but when it comes to Peter it changed something on the that authority of Jesus's word it pulls Peter to a higher Dimension it caused him to be raptured up back about it he was caught up the word pulls him into a sphere where all things are possible to him that believes he went beyond his senses feelings emotions human ability human efforts preach with me right there and it sent him into a dimension of faith that allowed him to do the supernal don't you see that is your Bible tonight that is your entire Bible it's full of the very same things the faith of Abraham that can call those things which were not as though they were that's the faith that Simpson had when he picked up the dry bone of an ass and he killed 500 philistin listen it took that same faith to pull him into a sphere that's the same faith that David had when David come against the Giant when he faced him that day that's the faith that Shamar had and I want to tell if that's the faith they had and faith is the same yesterday today and forever what kind of Faith you think you're going to have living in this Dark Age it'll do the same thing for you circumstances don't matter odds don't matter how far the boat sunk into the water don't matter it it don't matter how outnumbered you are it don't matter how big the waves are don't matter how hot the fire is Faith believes it looks to the Divine promise of God that's right I'm going to tell you something you stand up in a boat you'll get everybody's attention in the church you'll get everybody in your family attention you confess you're a Believer and watch what happens you say you're sold out you say you believe God you say that you're going to be anchored in Christ and I'm going to tell you people are going to think you're crazy you tell people you're going to be a water Walker and don't see if they don't think you're crazy you'll be called Fanatics Holy Rollers come on but the difference is when you heard him say come it didn't matter who else said what let the naysayers say whatever they want to let the let the Fanatics say what they want to let the carnal mind say what they want to let everybody else El but when you hear the word to you personally and Jesus speaks to you and something inside of you takes and it reverberates what's been said to you you'll say yes Lord I'm going to walk with you that's the way denominations look at you when you walk out of their boats come on when you won't put your name on their book they're going to look at you that way even people around the message will look at you strange well who do you think you are you young whipping snapping preacher we've been preaching this for 45 years we've had this revival and that Revival and we preached this and that who do you think you are coming around our boats I mean our church telling us how to get out of the boat we've been building this boat for 45 years we don't need your help I don't want in your boat I want out of your boat I went out I'm afraid that's where people's missed it at we know quotes we know scriptures we know seals we know Thunders we know pulls but what good does mechanics do you if you're faith is not pulled into that Dimension to put it into action what good does it do if it's not put into action you realize I wonder some people comes around the message that they don't just walk Catholic boats for message boats or Baptist boats for message boats come on somebody Peter puts his foot out there and that thing bobing back and forth listen to me he didn't try to figure it all out he didn't wait until he's able to quote all Ten Commandments without missing one word preach with me as a matter of fact the prophet tells us in perfect Faith he never even thought are you hearing me in other words his intellect did not comprehend so God in faith moves up into Peter it bypasses his thinking because the prophet said if he would have thought he'd went right back to that boat so his Oh Glory Faith bypasses human thoughts and human abilities and human understanding H2O it's water you can't walk on water water can't be walked upon come on but I want to tell you his eyes is declaring that it can't be done amen it declared it can't be done so we don't try to figure it out he simply believes that all things are possible he had already heard Jesus say that where I am you may be also what do I got to do take him at his word can you imagine for somebody to step out on the word without fear without doubt without questioning God that just simply that is the Walk of faith that we can possess let's stand our feet tonight Hallelujah there's a real that you and I can walk in tonight where all things are possible brother and sisters we cannot afford just a set up around and hope somebody else gets up and walks on water and been encourage yous to be able to do it listen to me be the one that does it take the initiative to yourself that if nobody else in this building is going to walk on it Lord let it be me just B me to come Lord if you're going to send a Revival I don't want you to start with the ministry or the deacons or any office start with me tonight send the fire down upon me Lord and let me stick my foot out the water and I just start walking on it can you imagine here this man is he's got his eyes fixed Upon Jesus and I'm going to tell you as long as you keep your eyes on the promise and your eyes on the word and your eyes on Christ you'll walk on the water but the moment you get it on human ability and you start looking at how big the waves are and you start looking at how deep the water is you're going to start sinking Peter oh God help us can we bow our hearts tonight I know this has been simple tonight but God help us God help us may there be somebody in this place tonight that takes the initiative Lord if that' be you just bid me to walk on the water tonight I don't know what you're dealing with I don't know what troubles you got but I want to tell you that your faith can pull you into a higher realm to set you into a place where you can walk on what other people sinking you simply have to have a perfect face you got a perfect God you got a perfect word you got the word of God for this day what do you need that word to become an action not stationary not just understanding not intellectual knowledge but let that word become so real that you got your eyes fixed on the word keep your eyes on the promise keep your eye on Jesus Heavenly Father Lord I'm aware of the Simplicity tonight but I hear your Prophet say today in perfect faith when he was talking about Peter walking on the water he said now you're preaching bride material bride material because it's not intellect it's not head knowledge it's not something we read from the book but bride material is a faith that is put into action where it's both Dynamics and mechanics together that begins to move in the Supernatural will begin to perform I pray tonight Lord may this congregation Lord I pray may it not just be the ministry but I pray for the body may we be Water Walkers tonight Lord we see you in your word in this Dark Age Lord where the Prophet tells us that the Le osia was completely blackened out it's the last watch but we know Lord It's darkest just before the dawn and we know know tonight Lord that you're watching over us you've not left us here in this day by ourselves but you're walking over us tonight Lord you're watching us every move we make every time we pray every sermon we hear every trial we go through when we Face difficulties and sickness you're watching over us Lord help me help me to walk on things Lord God Lord help me not to get to the place where I get so stressed out so down Lord that it pulls my spirit but I pray Lord help me to be more than just a preacher I don't want to just preach A good sermon give me the Faith Lord to be able to live it make us beacons Lord make us a lighthouse each one of us Lord that the word Lord It's Vindicated validated through our lives may it be a light that your word is just as real today I know Lord God what have doubts many times we'll get frustrated Lord the storms will be great but I believe tonight that the one who broke the bread the one that called Peter by name the one that told the woman oh my that they came to him that day and he told her what her need is May that same Jesus tonight may he come near us I pray Lord may it be more than just perceived in the mind but Lord God May our faith be awakened may it be pulled in that Dimension where all things are possible tonight I pray in the name of Jesus Christ I ask and everybody said amen you are great you do Miracles so great can we sing that together oh I love him don't you ain't his word Rich amen and you sing that man and you are great you do mirales so great

and life is worth the living just Because He Lives I said my life is now worth living just because he lives how many say we have a life worth living my what a I know Brother David said it was simple but what a powerful message those that walk on water I thought while he was preaching that I I can't help myself and you know the Bible says when the word Goes Forth it's food to the eater and or it's bread bread to the eater and and seed to the soar and so I I get to hearing him preaching I got thinking about that that water Strider you know the all the other insects they can't walk on water like the water Strider can and the scientist says well why can they walk on it when nothing else cares he said well because they don't have the weight of the other insects I thought isn't that something that Paul would tell the Believers to lay aside every weight and the sin that would so easily beset us I thought what is God trying to do but make us have the ability to walk from one dimension into the other I thought that's something and they gave him the name the water strier I thank God tonight that we're some water striders is it isn't that a peculiar name The Strider The Strider I thought you know you know that that's what God made us he made us and gave us the ability to walk but when I when I saw that I thought you know why they call him a Strider a Strider means it's one that takes decisive steps in a specified Direction well that's what God's called us to do I've took a decisive step I want know how many tonight can say I have decided to follow Jesus I've made a decisive step in a particular direction a want somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning how many enjoyed that message tonight amen maybe just reach out and get out of your seats just a minute and we're going to we're going to dismiss you but may just W say God bless you to somebody and it's good to see you in the house house of the Lord tonight and some of our visitors just greet them and may
