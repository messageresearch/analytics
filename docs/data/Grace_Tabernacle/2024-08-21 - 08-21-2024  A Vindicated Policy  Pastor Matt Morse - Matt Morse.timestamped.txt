[43:09] hearers alike Lord that we could just

[43:23] amen you love the Lord tonight amen we
[43:26] just want to invite you you to the
[43:27] scriptures uh to the book of Ephesians
[43:30] and we're going to read out of the first
[43:32] chapter and we'll just read a couple
[43:34] verses of scripture out of Ephesians 1
[43:36] and then on the 10th verse so give you
[43:39] just a moment uh to find your place
[43:41] there Ephesians 1 and 10 and I love that
[43:45] song I've Been Changed amen amen I ain't
[43:48] going to go back amen just say it's good
[43:52] to good to be able to come and
[43:54] fellowship around the word of God it
[43:56] don't ever get over does it just to just
[43:58] to come and take the word and there's
[43:59] always you know you can take the same
[44:01] scripture and read it tomorrow and the
[44:03] next day and the next day and there's
[44:04] always just something that the Lord has
[44:06] a way of taking a word that is a Living
[44:08] Word and revealing something to you in
[44:11] it that you didn't see yesterday and
[44:13] that's the beauty of God's word you know
[44:15] uh the same thing's been written on
[44:16] these Pages some uh for thousands and
[44:19] thousands of years but every day when
[44:21] you get up and read it it's just like
[44:22] getting a hold of some fresh mana and so
[44:25] I just love the word of God I I I want
[44:27] to read from the 10th verse Paul said
[44:29] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[44:31] of times he might gather together in one
[44:33] all things in Christ both which are in
[44:36] heaven and which are on earth even in
[44:38] him in whom also we have obtained an
[44:40] inheritance being somebody say an
[44:43] inheritance being predestinated
[44:46] according to the purpose of him who
[44:48] worketh all things after the counsel of
[44:51] his own will amen we'll just ask the
[44:53] Lord to add His blessings of the reading
[44:55] of his word uh tonight as you take your
[44:57] seats and I want to take a a a moment
[45:01] tonight I want to speak on a Vindicated
[45:04] policy a Vindicated policy last week we
[45:07] were speaking on this um uh subject of
[45:10] the church getting into the spirit and
[45:13] and uh we had gone in that direction out
[45:15] of the Book of Revelations and showing
[45:16] the God that was Among Us uh walking
[45:19] amongst the church in this day and uh
[45:21] and and we had read through about what
[45:24] John had wrote and and you know in
[45:26] John's revelation and how uh that he
[45:28] talked about when you know we must get
[45:30] into the spirit and by doing that we
[45:31] would be able to gain the revelation of
[45:33] the word of God and uh how many realize
[45:36] that tonight that this is not a carnal
[45:37] Affair this is U uh when you're talking
[45:40] about spiritual things or getting into
[45:42] the spirit remember when John uh even
[45:44] wrote the Book of Revelation matter of
[45:45] fact I can say this about every writer
[45:47] of the Bible uh any author that wrote
[45:49] any Scripture that we read was in the
[45:51] spirit of God when they wrote it was the
[45:53] spirit of God that moved upon them uh
[45:55] that caused them to Rite the things that
[45:57] we read and so we realize that if it
[46:00] takes getting into the spirit to write
[46:01] it then it takes us getting into the
[46:03] spirit to uh to receive the revelation
[46:06] of it so uh so by that we know that our
[46:08] walk with God is a spiritual walk our
[46:10] relationship with God is a spiritual
[46:12] relationship and so uh we we actually
[46:15] find this in the scriptures that there's
[46:17] actually a promise that God has given to
[46:18] the Gentile Church in the last days and
[46:21] uh Not only was that promise for us to
[46:23] to uh uh to get into the spirit but the
[46:26] promise of God was that the spirit would
[46:28] get into us and so this is something
[46:30] that God has promised to us as Believers
[46:32] and so uh we realize as a gentile race
[46:35] that we were promised a spiritual
[46:36] relationship with God it wasn't uh it
[46:39] wasn't a carnal relationship that God
[46:41] promised us but he he he he he promised
[46:44] us a connection a close walk with him a
[46:46] a a spiritual walk with him and I know
[46:48] this is uh is something that we talk
[46:50] about or we say many times but often uh
[46:53] we we we miss the real revelation of of
[46:55] having a spiritual walk or having a
[46:57] spiritual relationship with God and and
[46:59] God dealing with us on this level and
[47:02] but you know there's something in in
[47:03] this race of people that we all are here
[47:05] as a a group of Gentiles but uh in our
[47:08] race there's something special about our
[47:10] relationship with God and the what is
[47:12] special about it is our relationship
[47:14] brother Jared is not a relationship that
[47:17] God is dealing with a group of people
[47:18] but your relationship with God is an
[47:21] individual relationship isn't that
[47:22] something to think about that that that
[47:24] God is so big that he could have a
[47:26] relationship with each one of us and it
[47:28] it don't matter what he does for one he
[47:30] can still do something else the same day
[47:32] at the same time and he'll hear the same
[47:35] prayer of another person they they may
[47:37] be across the seas and praying and
[47:38] talking to God and and God Is So vast
[47:41] that we could all approach him at the
[47:43] same time and we could tell him what's
[47:44] on our heart and and and and brother
[47:46] Mark we could tell him our needs and
[47:47] he'll hear every one of our prayer and
[47:49] he'll he'll answer all of our prayer at
[47:51] the same that's how big of a God that
[47:52] God is I I think sometimes we make God
[47:55] too small but we have a great big God
[47:56] God and and he's a god of the individual
[48:00] he you know uh the Bible would tell us
[48:01] that when God dealt with Israel he dealt
[48:03] with them as a nation but when he dealt
[48:05] with the the Gentile he deals with the
[48:07] gentile people as individuals and so so
[48:10] when we read this scripture we read in
[48:11] the book of Ephesians you'll find when
[48:13] Paul is talking he's talking to the
[48:15] Gentile Believers and and uh and when
[48:17] you read this uh this book in the Bible
[48:20] even in the very first verse Paul tells
[48:21] you who he's talking to see don't he
[48:23] makes it plain he said this letter I'm a
[48:26] Al Jesus Christ and by the will of God I
[48:29] am writing to the Saints in other words
[48:31] that was those that were Sanctified by
[48:33] God it was the it was those and Paul
[48:36] said it was those who were at Ephesus
[48:38] and also unto the faithful in Jesus
[48:41] Christ so but when we read this we
[48:43] realize that it was not just a a a
[48:46] faithful church as a body of Believers
[48:49] but when Paul was talking to us it was a
[48:51] faithful church as a body of individuals
[48:53] and so he says to the faithful in Christ
[48:55] Jesus these were individuals brother B
[48:57] said watch how he addresses us he said
[48:59] this is not to the unbelievers but when
[49:01] Paul writes this book he wrote it to the
[49:04] Believers somebody say Believers so when
[49:06] you read this letter this is not written
[49:08] to the whole world this isn't something
[49:09] that everybody can pick up and say this
[49:11] is personal to me but to the Believers
[49:13] and those that are faithful in Christ
[49:15] you can take this uh you can take this
[49:17] book and you can start reading it and
[49:19] you'll realize that this is something
[49:21] that God has written to you and to you
[49:23] alone see it was a letter to an
[49:25] individual he said see it was to the
[49:27] church but it was to the called out ones
[49:29] it was the Sanctified or the called ones
[49:31] that are in Christ Jesus and so the
[49:33] letter by the mark it was written it was
[49:35] it was it was written to individuals and
[49:37] it was calling to individuals to have a
[49:39] relationship with God and brother B
[49:41] talks about this book in in many ways
[49:43] I'm not going to preach the series on it
[49:45] but he says you know this is one of the
[49:46] greatest books in the O in the New
[49:48] Testament because the book of Ephesians
[49:50] is what draws us together and
[49:52] positionally places the church it's what
[49:55] it's what shows you who you are and what
[49:56] your position is in Christ Jesus and and
[49:59] so we see when you when you go reading
[50:00] through this book that the book of
[50:02] Ephesians even uh remember been maybe a
[50:05] year or two ago that we had uh kind of
[50:07] went through how that it was a parallel
[50:08] to the Book of Joshua and the things
[50:10] that uh that that Joshua done in the Old
[50:12] Testament was what Paul was speaking of
[50:14] in the New Testament and so so we how
[50:16] many remembers that I it's been a couple
[50:18] years back but maybe I'll just just lay
[50:21] a a little Foundation from it for some
[50:22] that wasn't here but uh but the Book of
[50:24] Joshua we realize that it was a story of
[50:27] isra Israel possessing the promised land
[50:29] how many know that remember Joshua he
[50:31] was a type of the Holy Ghost and he came
[50:33] in at the end of the Journey of Israel
[50:35] and was what led them into Canaan land
[50:37] remember they went to Jericho marched
[50:39] around the walls and it was Joshua that
[50:41] led them after the death of Moses it was
[50:43] Joshua that took him on into the
[50:45] promised land and so we realize by
[50:47] studying the scripture that this that
[50:49] this journey of the children of Israel
[50:51] was a natural type of what God would do
[50:53] spiritually with the church today how
[50:55] many believe that and so so we see that
[50:57] from Egypt all the way to Canaan land in
[50:59] the natural was a Tope of our spiritual
[51:02] journey so you can go back in the Old
[51:03] Testament and you can read about how
[51:05] they came out of Egypt and how God had
[51:07] called them and they went into the
[51:08] Wilderness and they and God fed them
[51:10] while they were on their journey and
[51:12] they went through this uh this all this
[51:14] phase of this journey and they finally
[51:15] come to the border of Canaan land and
[51:17] God would send a man like Joshua that
[51:19] would lead them into this place and so
[51:21] we realize that that entire story is a
[51:24] type of your spiritual walk with God so
[51:26] so so you can actually go back and read
[51:28] this and you can find out where you are
[51:30] I I love that God would give us a way to
[51:32] find our stage in our journey we can we
[51:35] can find out where we are in this
[51:36] journey and and so brother R would take
[51:38] and show us that that see these three
[51:40] stages he said just as there was three
[51:42] stages in Egypt or in their Journey
[51:44] there's three stages in our journey said
[51:46] see their first stage was they came out
[51:48] of Egypt the second stage is they went
[51:50] into the Wilderness the third stage is
[51:53] that they entered into the Canaan land
[51:54] which was a Promised Land he says so so
[51:56] these three stages of their Journey was
[51:58] a type of the three stages of our
[52:00] journey so so leaving of Egypt it was a
[52:03] type of justification and another words
[52:05] that that that you would go and and
[52:06] repent and and God would forgive you of
[52:08] your sins and you'd be justified
[52:10] remember how the play on words just if I
[52:12] had never done it in the first place it
[52:14] was God and God really forgives you when
[52:16] a person comes to God sincerely and they
[52:18] repent to God for their sin God always
[52:21] he's just the Bible said he is just to
[52:23] forgive you of your sins and so we go
[52:25] through this stage of justification and
[52:27] then the second stage in their
[52:29] Wilderness Journey you remember out in
[52:30] the wilderness and and how that there's
[52:32] such a good atmosphere in here I may as
[52:34] well preach but you remember when they
[52:35] went out into the Wilderness that they
[52:37] that that they had gone through this
[52:38] stage of purification and remember God
[52:40] would give them the order of taking the
[52:42] the sacrifices and lay them up on the
[52:44] Altar and remember the the the the the
[52:46] sacrifice of separation and they would
[52:48] take the ashes and all all the things in
[52:50] in this Wilderness Journey it was a type
[52:52] of purification or sanctification in
[52:54] fact that God would not even let them
[52:56] enter into the land of Canaan in the
[52:59] condition that they were in remember he
[53:00] said they had to be Sanctified they had
[53:02] to to be a pure people they had to
[53:04] follow the word of God matter matter of
[53:05] fact there was so many that never made
[53:07] it into the land of Canaan because they
[53:09] never made it through that that part of
[53:11] their walk with God and so so he says
[53:13] see this is their Wilderness Journey was
[53:15] a type of sanctification and then then
[53:17] they went into the Canaan land and so
[53:19] this is why so many people get this
[53:21] mixed up on this type or they can't they
[53:23] can't find this type perfectly is
[53:25] because there's so many to that toped
[53:27] Canaan land with the Millennium and say
[53:28] well then we'll enter into this land of
[53:30] Millennium but brother man said it
[53:31] couldn't be that because when they went
[53:33] into Canaan land there were still Wars
[53:35] and they were still fighting in the
[53:37] Millennium it was a time of Peace Satan
[53:38] would be bound a thousand years there
[53:40] there won't be no Wars and things like
[53:42] that going on he said so what the Canaan
[53:44] land was it was a type of the Holy Ghost
[53:46] so now you see this three stages of the
[53:48] believer just in that very same uh
[53:50] Journey that they have we can see that
[53:52] in our journey in justification
[53:54] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[53:56] Ghost ghost I thought my isn't it
[53:57] something that we've saw that happen and
[53:59] not only did we see it happen in every
[54:01] individual but we've saw this happen
[54:04] with the church and here here we are at
[54:06] the end time and brother Jared the
[54:07] church has gone through this phase it
[54:09] went through an age of justification age
[54:11] of sanctification and now we've came
[54:13] into this age of the Holy Ghost we've
[54:15] came into this Joshua age remember
[54:17] brother Wayne did a whole series on on
[54:18] the Joshua generation and and here that
[54:21] here we are as some Joshua Believers
[54:23] this is our our type in the scripture
[54:25] we're those that would in that they
[54:27] wouldn't be stuck back there they would
[54:29] that they would enter into this place of
[54:30] of of of of of the baptism of the Holy
[54:33] Ghost and so we see as Joshua comes in I
[54:36] want to just lay this in here but but
[54:38] Joshua when he comes in Joshua the first
[54:40] chapter he says be strong and of good
[54:42] courage for under this people shall I
[54:44] divide an inheritance in the land which
[54:47] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[54:50] so here in Joshua the first chapter soon
[54:52] as Joshua takes office he announces his
[54:55] purpose and his purpose Pur is to lead
[54:57] them into this place or or into their
[54:59] land of inheritance but notice because
[55:01] they were Jews brother Mark he was going
[55:02] to divide them by tribe so it wasn't
[55:05] that each individual possessed this
[55:07] portion but by tribe they would go into
[55:09] this boundary of land but then whenever
[55:11] Paul would come in Ephesians the first
[55:13] chapter then Paul would show what his
[55:15] purpose was and he said that in the
[55:17] dispensation of the fullness of times
[55:19] that he might gather together in one all
[55:22] things in Christ both him which are in
[55:24] heaven and which are in Earth even in in
[55:26] him in whom also we have obtained our
[55:29] inheritance being predestinated
[55:32] according to the purpose of him who
[55:34] worketh all things after the counsel of
[55:36] his own will but now this time whenever
[55:39] Apostle Paul begins to speak to the
[55:41] Gentile Church in the end time it is a
[55:43] possession that is inherited by the
[55:46] individual so my it just makes me feel
[55:48] good to think that God would write a
[55:50] letter to me see I you know you can read
[55:52] this say brother Matt it's to every
[55:53] believer but when I read this I read
[55:55] this as a letter to me I I I say Lord he
[55:57] wrote it he says Matt this is your
[55:59] inheritance and this is the promise that
[56:01] I've given unto you that's how I read my
[56:03] Bible this is it it ain't just something
[56:05] for uh for the world or something to be
[56:07] put on to somebody else but I thank God
[56:09] that he wrote it to me how many say Amen
[56:10] to that I I thank God that I can read it
[56:13] and I can read it as a letter as God
[56:15] intended it that this was something that
[56:17] God has written to me and so so we see
[56:19] this it's an individual possessed
[56:21] portion that God has given brother B
[56:23] said what is that land that was promised
[56:25] to the New Testament believer he said it
[56:27] was the promise of the Holy Spirit
[56:30] that's what Joel said for it shall come
[56:31] to pass in the last days that I will
[56:33] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I
[56:36] thought my isn't it something that there
[56:37] was so many that came out of this land
[56:39] of Egypt there were so many that went
[56:41] out into this Wilderness and brother
[56:43] Mark they died in the wilderness after
[56:45] they come out of Egypt because they
[56:46] never made it into that land of promise
[56:49] I thought Lord help us not to ever be
[56:51] the ones that get out of Egypt and get
[56:53] out into the middle of the Wilderness
[56:55] and get lost in in this Wilderness
[56:57] journey and never make it into the
[56:58] promise that God has given to the church
[57:00] today I think I look around this world
[57:02] and you see so many failed attempts at
[57:05] at being Christians and uh failed
[57:07] attempts at being at being at being
[57:09] saved you see people that whose lives
[57:11] are wrecked you say what happen today
[57:12] many times is because people they come
[57:14] to this stage they say I'm going to stop
[57:16] my drinking and I I'm G to stop doing
[57:18] drugs and I I'm G to start dressing
[57:20] right and I'm going to start living
[57:21] right and I'm going to repent and I'm
[57:23] going to go to church and God's going to
[57:24] forgive me and I'm going to be a good
[57:26] church member and then they come and
[57:27] they go through this stage of
[57:29] justification and they they make their
[57:30] heart right and they and they repent and
[57:32] they really do repent and God forgives
[57:35] them and he really does forgive them and
[57:36] then they enter into this stage of
[57:38] sanctification and they they begin to
[57:40] clean up their life but whenever it
[57:42] comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:45] then they fail to press into it they get
[57:47] stuck or lost in this Wilderness part of
[57:50] their journey and I thought my isn't it
[57:52] something you know why because sometimes
[57:54] it's hard to press into it sometimes
[57:56] it's hard to press over in I I wonder
[57:58] how how they must have felt that day
[58:00] when Joshua was telling them on the
[58:02] outside of the land of Canaan here they
[58:04] came to the walls of Jericho and Joshua
[58:06] said but you have to walk around the
[58:07] walls in order to get what your
[58:09] inheritance is you're going to have to
[58:11] walk and you're going to have to put
[58:12] another foot in front of another and
[58:14] you're going to have to keep walking in
[58:15] the word of God and you'll have to walk
[58:17] around it every day and day after day
[58:19] will make another trip and tomorrow
[58:21] we'll make another trip and tomorrow
[58:23] we'll make another trip I said sometimes
[58:25] people get lost Lo in the journey I I
[58:27] wonder if they didn't get tired but
[58:29] Joshua said but you're a promised group
[58:30] of people you're the people that God has
[58:32] called to inherit this land I know there
[58:35] may had some fathers and you may had
[58:37] some uncles and you may had some friends
[58:39] that lost their way in the journey that
[58:41] never made it this far but God has
[58:43] called you over the river and God has
[58:45] parted the waters that you can walk to
[58:47] the to the cusp of your inheritance that
[58:49] you can Mark you won't get tired when
[58:51] you get a little weak somebody bow them
[58:53] hold them up and let them let them build
[58:55] up a little bit of stamina to go another
[58:57] row another round brother Mar around the
[59:00] walls until finally on the seventh day
[59:02] the Bible said the walls fell down and
[59:04] they receiv received what God had
[59:06] promised unto them I think people give
[59:08] up and they stop pressing but remember
[59:10] said but what we got to do is we've got
[59:11] to press on into the position of the
[59:14] promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:16] you want to have a walk with God you got
[59:18] to press through under that you want to
[59:20] be you want to be able to to be able to
[59:22] serve God and not be in and out of
[59:24] church you got to press through into
[59:25] there it can't be you can't get lost in
[59:27] the wilderness but we had to press true
[59:30] he said let's not stop at just believing
[59:32] in the Lord Jesus and being baptized
[59:34] let's not stop just because he cleaned
[59:36] us up from a life of sin but let's press
[59:38] on into our position let's press on
[59:42] brother Mark justification ain't no
[59:44] place of rest sanctification is not a
[59:48] place of rest it's the worst place you
[59:50] could ever take a nap it's not a place
[59:52] of rest the Bible never never told us
[59:55] that this was our our place of rest this
[59:57] was the place that God had given you you
[59:59] know I think of sanctification like this
[1:00:01] it's a place that every believer has to
[1:00:03] go to but no believer should stay
[1:00:06] in the land of
[1:00:08] sanctification it's a place it's meant
[1:00:11] to be a place that you pass through the
[1:00:13] Wilderness was a place that they were to
[1:00:16] pass through and it took so long for
[1:00:18] them to get to that place I thought my
[1:00:20] you know how many uh theologians or
[1:00:22] different studiers have showed how long
[1:00:23] it could have took just a few days to be
[1:00:25] able to to pass through from one one
[1:00:27] place to another I thought that's the
[1:00:29] way it is when you look at the lives of
[1:00:30] people sometimes it takes so long for
[1:00:32] them to pass through that place but
[1:00:35] friends it's not a place of rest we must
[1:00:37] go on it it it's meant to pass through
[1:00:39] let me can I tell you what Jesus said he
[1:00:41] said let me tell you why you don't want
[1:00:42] to rest in this land I know I know this
[1:00:44] is simple but let me tell you why you
[1:00:45] don't want to stay in this place because
[1:00:47] Jesus said when an unclean Spirit has
[1:00:49] gone out of a man what is sanctification
[1:00:51] a life that is cleaned up the devil has
[1:00:53] been cast They they've left the your
[1:00:55] life has been turned over to God Lord
[1:00:57] let all this filth and all these things
[1:00:59] of this world let it leave from me and
[1:01:01] now you have an empty house and Jesus
[1:01:03] said and when the unclean Spirit has
[1:01:05] gone out of a man he walketh through Dry
[1:01:07] places seeking rest and finds none and
[1:01:10] then he says I will return unto my house
[1:01:12] isn't that something the devil calls you
[1:01:14] his
[1:01:15] house when you when he leaves he calls
[1:01:17] you his house I will return man it makes
[1:01:19] me want to punch him right in the nose
[1:01:21] I'll return to my house he said I think
[1:01:24] we ought to look at the Devil and say no
[1:01:25] this ain't your house house this is this
[1:01:26] is the Lord's House this is my house
[1:01:30] that's what we ought to do with the
[1:01:31] devil and say no this is my house this
[1:01:33] ain't your house he said I'll return to
[1:01:35] my house what an arrogant devil I'll
[1:01:39] return to my house from when I came out
[1:01:42] and when he has come he finds the house
[1:01:43] empty swept and garnished and he goes in
[1:01:46] and he takes with himself seven other
[1:01:47] Spirits more wicked than himself that
[1:01:49] they could enter and dwell therein and
[1:01:51] the last state of that man is worse than
[1:01:53] the first you see why this is a d
[1:01:55] dangerous land to dwell in you don't
[1:01:58] want to come to this place and rest
[1:02:00] because it'll never be a place of rest
[1:02:02] it's not meant to to be a place of rest
[1:02:04] it's not meant to be a place where that
[1:02:06] you would live your life that's why
[1:02:07] that's why you see so many people that
[1:02:09] are I'm going to get myself in trouble
[1:02:10] but you see so many mean people running
[1:02:12] around wearing dresses because they try
[1:02:14] to get to this place of sanctification
[1:02:16] and never have their lives fil or filled
[1:02:18] with the spirit of Jesus Christ and now
[1:02:20] now now now they're a Target to the
[1:02:22] devil because they're trying to do
[1:02:24] something for the Lord and the Bible
[1:02:25] says when you start to do something for
[1:02:26] the Lord but said every gun of hell is
[1:02:28] aimed at you and so here they made a a
[1:02:30] step to do something for God and the
[1:02:32] devil's after them and now and now they
[1:02:34] get into this state and it just
[1:02:35] continues to get worse and worse and
[1:02:37] worse they get bitter and then they're
[1:02:39] they're mad and they're hateful all the
[1:02:41] time because they're trying to live
[1:02:42] something that they can't even hardly
[1:02:43] live and and they're mad at everybody
[1:02:45] else I mean you I ain't trying to point
[1:02:47] anybody I know we we we all know people
[1:02:49] but you wonder what's wrong with them
[1:02:51] because if if the spirit of Christ was
[1:02:53] you let me tell you something about the
[1:02:55] spirit of Christ it's it's an easily
[1:02:56] identifiable spirit this is not
[1:02:59] something that's hard to discern for a
[1:03:01] Believer to look at somebody and say
[1:03:02] well I wonder if they got the spirit of
[1:03:04] Christ in them you know it because the
[1:03:05] Bible tells us the fruit of what the
[1:03:07] spirit of Christ is so see when a man
[1:03:09] has Paul teaches a whole message on it
[1:03:11] the book of Galatians he said when a man
[1:03:13] has the spirit of Christ he said the H
[1:03:15] in other words the Holy Spirit produces
[1:03:17] a certain kind of fruit he said it's
[1:03:20] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:03:22] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:03:25] against such there is no law so the
[1:03:26] spirit of God Bears a certain kind of
[1:03:29] fruit so you realize that in order that
[1:03:32] what God is trying to get us to is to
[1:03:34] this place that we can have the spirit
[1:03:36] of God on the inside of us that we could
[1:03:39] bear the fruit of what Christianity is
[1:03:42] not just to go around and say well I'm a
[1:03:44] Christian because I go to church and I'm
[1:03:45] a Christian because I because I have a
[1:03:47] Bible and I'm Christian because I'm a
[1:03:48] part of GRA Tabernacle but that that
[1:03:50] ain't what makes you a Christian but
[1:03:52] it's that the life of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost with live in
[1:03:56] the heart of a man I I think it's
[1:03:58] wonderful that God would want his Spirit
[1:04:00] to dwell in you the very creator of
[1:04:02] Heaven and Earth would want his Spirit
[1:04:04] to dwell in a in a human flesh the the
[1:04:06] old the old ugliness of humanity but
[1:04:08] that is the desire of God in this age is
[1:04:11] to dwell in us see that's the dangerous
[1:04:14] place to dwell in the state of
[1:04:16] sanctification said but why because you
[1:04:19] you get worse and worse but B said like
[1:04:20] this he said when the devil moves out
[1:04:22] then that gives God an opportunity to
[1:04:24] move in amen so when he goes out let the
[1:04:27] Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it
[1:04:29] there if you just repent of your sins
[1:04:32] and go on you'll be worse off than you
[1:04:34] ever were you ever thought of that my
[1:04:37] ain't that a powerful quote it's what a
[1:04:38] revelation this is how many times that
[1:04:41] well Lord I pray you forgive me people
[1:04:43] walk down the road Lord you forgive me
[1:04:44] Lord and man I feel a bit better because
[1:04:46] I ask for forgiveness I'm just going to
[1:04:47] keep asking for forgiveness but he said
[1:04:49] if you just repent of your sins and go
[1:04:50] on you're going to be worse off than you
[1:04:52] were but you got to get to a place where
[1:04:54] the spirit of God is living inside of
[1:04:57] you you got to press into this place he
[1:04:59] said get to the place where Satan once
[1:05:01] lived man that's good get the place
[1:05:04] where Satan once lived and get it
[1:05:07] occupied get it filled with the holy
[1:05:09] spirit of God and then you'll have the
[1:05:12] strength of God's word in you manifested
[1:05:15] and you'll be able to cast out Devils we
[1:05:18] ain't just talking about casting out
[1:05:19] Devils out of everybody else but any
[1:05:20] devil that would come to your porch
[1:05:22] knocking on the door brother Mark you
[1:05:24] could look him in the eye and say this
[1:05:25] house is not empty any longer the place
[1:05:28] that you came to dwell is not empty any
[1:05:31] longer there's no room for you in the
[1:05:34] end find your you can have your leave he
[1:05:36] said then you'll have the ability to
[1:05:39] cast out Devils I don't know about you
[1:05:40] but I think we want our Lives full
[1:05:43] tonight we want our Lives full I want my
[1:05:45] life to be filled with the spirit of God
[1:05:47] that where to where the devil wouldn't
[1:05:49] have no room you know I think about this
[1:05:51] in our in our natural and in our natural
[1:05:53] life I I wonder how many how many could
[1:05:55] say that's like I want I want my life to
[1:05:57] be filled up I you know you you think
[1:05:59] about in our in our natural life and all
[1:06:01] the the things that we do we want our
[1:06:03] natural life we we want to be able to be
[1:06:05] successful and we don't uh we don't want
[1:06:07] to we don't we want to be able to eat
[1:06:08] tomorrow how many how me how me say Amen
[1:06:10] we you know if I asked the if I asked
[1:06:12] y'all tonight I said well I wonder how
[1:06:13] many if I if I if I had the ability to
[1:06:15] give it and I said well I'll tell you
[1:06:17] what we're going to do I'm just going to
[1:06:18] I'm just going to try to give everybody
[1:06:20] a couple of million dollars and maybe
[1:06:21] pay off all the what you have and get
[1:06:23] you a house and everything paid for and
[1:06:25] we're going to put a three or four
[1:06:26] million in the bank just in case you
[1:06:27] have a flat tire or some maintenance or
[1:06:29] anything like that any just a little a
[1:06:31] rainy day fund I wonder how many would
[1:06:33] raise your hand and accept it is there a
[1:06:35] few that would take it there's got to be
[1:06:37] come on I'm asking you if I had the
[1:06:38] ability to give it would you take it be
[1:06:40] honest with me see everybody everybody
[1:06:42] would take it because some of youall
[1:06:43] think I'm crazy you're looking at me
[1:06:44] like I am but but but but everybody in
[1:06:46] your honest heart if I really had it to
[1:06:48] give there ain't nobody in here that
[1:06:50] wouldn't accept it would say I I would
[1:06:51] certainly want that why because because
[1:06:53] you would be you would say well I would
[1:06:55] have peace in my natural life I would
[1:06:57] you know I could go fishing I go hunting
[1:06:59] I well I could buy that hunting ranch
[1:07:00] that I always wanted and I could high
[1:07:02] fence me off some deer I we'd never see
[1:07:04] brother Morgan again you wonder why God
[1:07:05] don't give Morgan $10 million you'd
[1:07:07] never see him he'd be off in the deer
[1:07:09] Woods he'd never come out Lord be so mad
[1:07:12] at us either that or she'd be having a
[1:07:14] jubilee I don't know which but but
[1:07:16] nevertheless but God he said he'll never
[1:07:18] put on you more than you could bear
[1:07:19] brother ain't God wonderful I won't give
[1:07:22] you more than you can handle he he's
[1:07:24] just a mindful God he a a't going to let
[1:07:25] us fall I love our Lord but you know if
[1:07:28] I offered it to you brother Mark we
[1:07:29] would take it because we want to we want
[1:07:31] our natural life we want to be able to
[1:07:33] make it and make make good decisions but
[1:07:35] you know so so even in our in the
[1:07:37] natural we look to invest things we want
[1:07:38] to make good Investments and you know if
[1:07:40] you ask people actually ask me this all
[1:07:42] the time and I've gave many uh uh people
[1:07:44] advice and things that to my best of my
[1:07:46] ability of where you know to way to
[1:07:48] invest money and what making good
[1:07:49] decisions and things like that and but
[1:07:52] but you know when you you can invest in
[1:07:53] so many things you can invest in stock
[1:07:55] you can invest in insurances and
[1:07:57] policies and all sorts of things in
[1:07:58] order to make money and actually I I I I
[1:08:00] was reading here uh uh today and it was
[1:08:03] showing on in 2024 the best investment
[1:08:05] landscape uh for this year is is in
[1:08:08] private Banks or chemicals or consumer
[1:08:10] durables this is what so there's always
[1:08:12] something that tells us the best thing
[1:08:13] that you can invest in in order for you
[1:08:15] to have success in your Investments and
[1:08:18] you know I I thought you know if you're
[1:08:19] going to make an investment in the
[1:08:21] natural then you're investing for a
[1:08:22] purpose I don't know anybody uh that
[1:08:24] would make an investment for the purpose
[1:08:26] of losing money but when you invest you
[1:08:29] invest to gain you invest in order you
[1:08:31] want the stock that that you're invested
[1:08:33] in not only do you want it to gain value
[1:08:35] but you want it to I'm not giving you a
[1:08:37] lesson but you want it to gain value
[1:08:39] over inflation you want it to gain and
[1:08:41] otherwise not that it would just be
[1:08:42] worth more but you want it to be worth
[1:08:44] more in value to your life so you if you
[1:08:47] make an investment you want it to bring
[1:08:49] value to your life down down at the end
[1:08:51] of the road that there's something that
[1:08:52] it can bring value uh to your help you
[1:08:55] maybe help your retirement or help your
[1:08:57] children or or or or weddings or things
[1:08:59] that that you got to look forward to but
[1:09:01] but we make investments to take care of
[1:09:02] things like that so you want it to add
[1:09:04] value to your life and you know I
[1:09:06] thought about thought about this how
[1:09:08] that we come to this place and and even
[1:09:10] in our in our lives we we we want to
[1:09:12] invest our lives in something that will
[1:09:14] have a good return on our investment and
[1:09:16] I said I thought about that today of how
[1:09:18] that God would that would would give us
[1:09:20] an offer of something if I want to
[1:09:21] invest my time and my money and my
[1:09:23] efforts I want to invest in something
[1:09:25] brother Mark that'll give me the best
[1:09:26] return and you know I can't think of any
[1:09:28] greater investment to increase our
[1:09:30] quality of life or the value of life
[1:09:32] than the investment that God has offered
[1:09:35] to us as individuals here God has I
[1:09:38] thought my isn't it something that the
[1:09:39] investment that God has offered to you
[1:09:41] tonight is an investment that'll pay a
[1:09:43] real dividend you know the investment if
[1:09:46] I could stand for God tonight and say
[1:09:47] the investment that God has asking you
[1:09:49] to make is an investment that brother
[1:09:51] Mark it has a track record that it's
[1:09:53] never failed it's a track record that
[1:09:55] it'll never crash you don't have to
[1:09:56] worry about it whenever you go and you
[1:09:58] invest in this what God is offering to
[1:10:00] us today it ain't something that's going
[1:10:01] to fall tomorrow but you can invest in
[1:10:03] the stock that God has to offer it's
[1:10:05] something that is sure but the mark you
[1:10:07] know they have what's called shity bonds
[1:10:09] let me tell you the only real shity bond
[1:10:11] that there is is the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:13] Ghost it's the only real sure thing that
[1:10:15] that you'll be able to get a return on
[1:10:17] your investment it's it's a stock
[1:10:19] brother brother Jared that has never
[1:10:20] failed matter of fact it's got such a
[1:10:22] record it's risen from the from the
[1:10:24] grave for the cross of Calvary to the
[1:10:27] throne of God I I it's always on the
[1:10:29] rise I think isn't it something to be
[1:10:31] able to invest in something that I know
[1:10:32] that ain't ever going to fall it's an
[1:10:34] investment that God has offered to us
[1:10:36] the Bible said Jesus said to him that
[1:10:38] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:10:39] in my Throne so see here when he would
[1:10:41] offer this investment he would offer it
[1:10:44] with a with a reward that is greater
[1:10:46] than anything that we can possess in
[1:10:47] this life I wonder if you ask people if
[1:10:51] you could just ask somebody this tonight
[1:10:52] and you say well how do you invest in
[1:10:54] Christ
[1:10:55] I wonder how many could give you an
[1:10:57] answer how do you invest in Christ you
[1:11:00] know mean it's hard to explain things
[1:11:03] sometimes but you realize that this was
[1:11:05] the very question that the Rich Young
[1:11:08] Ruler was asking Jesus whenever he
[1:11:10] talked to him when it came to him you
[1:11:12] realize he was a man that had made many
[1:11:14] natural Investments he was a very
[1:11:15] wealthy man the Bible called him a Rich
[1:11:17] Young Ruler so he no doubt made many
[1:11:19] natural Investments but when he came to
[1:11:21] Christ notice what he was asking he was
[1:11:23] asking about an investment he said what
[1:11:26] can I do to have eternal
[1:11:29] life I he was wanting to make an
[1:11:31] investment what what must I give what
[1:11:33] must I do in order to gain eternal life
[1:11:36] obviously it was something that he had
[1:11:37] heard of it was something that that he
[1:11:39] wanted it was something that he that he
[1:11:41] had a desire of knowing that it wasn't
[1:11:43] something that he would be able to
[1:11:44] obtain in his natural life but he was
[1:11:46] looking for something to pay dividends
[1:11:47] down the road I want something down the
[1:11:49] road I I want I want eternal life and
[1:11:52] what must I do in order to have it you
[1:11:54] know I notice how remember how Jesus
[1:11:56] turned to him he said well sell all you
[1:11:58] have and give it to the poor and take up
[1:12:00] your cross and follow me and the Bible
[1:12:01] says that the man left away troubled
[1:12:03] because he had many great possessions he
[1:12:05] was troubled in his spirit that he that
[1:12:07] he wouldn't want to give it up but
[1:12:08] remember said what he said what it was
[1:12:10] what what think about it when a man of
[1:12:11] business he had been so prosperous but
[1:12:14] here he was given an opportunity to
[1:12:16] receive a Vindicated policy from God
[1:12:20] here God had given him an offer of a
[1:12:22] policy that could never fail here here
[1:12:24] Jesus was telling him something of all
[1:12:26] the things that you could gain I I
[1:12:27] thought about all the risky Investments
[1:12:29] that he had made and all the the risky
[1:12:31] decisions that he had made but here that
[1:12:33] Jesus was offering an an investment that
[1:12:36] would never fail he was offering an
[1:12:38] investment that would never go bad I I
[1:12:40] thought my of all the risky things that
[1:12:42] we could do but here's one investment
[1:12:44] that you can make tonight that there is
[1:12:45] no risk it has a proven track it's 100%
[1:12:49] of the time the people that have
[1:12:50] invested that they have received what
[1:12:52] what the investment promised that they
[1:12:54] would receive
[1:12:55] I think many take this you know many
[1:12:57] times they they read this Rich Young
[1:12:58] Ruler and you know I know it gets taken
[1:13:00] the wrong way and they say well you know
[1:13:02] that God wants everybody to be poor and
[1:13:03] you know you got to be poor to serve God
[1:13:05] that I don't I don't believe that and I
[1:13:07] I'm not preaching that to you tonight or
[1:13:08] you can't have nothing but but notice
[1:13:10] that what Jesus was preaching to this
[1:13:12] man if you're a good Bible reader you'll
[1:13:13] find this out that he was preaching unto
[1:13:16] him a principle the same principle that
[1:13:17] Jesus spoke in in Matthew the 6th
[1:13:19] chapter he said seek you first the
[1:13:22] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:13:25] all these things will be added unto you
[1:13:28] so here it was a principle Jesus was
[1:13:30] trying to get him to invest in this
[1:13:32] principle of of the kingdom of God he he
[1:13:34] was trying matter of fact even Jesus
[1:13:36] told the disciples one time he said I
[1:13:38] say unto you there's no man that has
[1:13:40] ever left a house or a brother sister
[1:13:42] father mother wife children lands for my
[1:13:44] sake and the gospels but he would
[1:13:46] receive a h hundredfold in this time
[1:13:49] houses brothers sisters mothers children
[1:13:51] and lands with persecutions and in the
[1:13:53] world to come eternal life so God has
[1:13:56] never asked for anybody an investment
[1:13:58] that he wasn't intending on giving them
[1:14:00] a return on the investment it wasn't
[1:14:02] that God wanted the man not to have
[1:14:04] anything but he wanted him to he was
[1:14:06] offering him an investment to give first
[1:14:08] to the kingdom of God and then allow God
[1:14:11] to bless him in his life I thought I
[1:14:13] thought my you know what he was off man
[1:14:14] I feel like preaching tonight you know
[1:14:16] what he was offering he was offering him
[1:14:17] the same thing that Elijah offered to
[1:14:19] that widow woman that day when her meal
[1:14:21] Bell had ran dry and Elijah said woman
[1:14:24] could you go get me some the drink and
[1:14:26] when you come back bring me a Mortel of
[1:14:27] bread in thy hand she said I have
[1:14:29] nothing to offer I got a little bit of
[1:14:31] oil left I got a few drops of oil and a
[1:14:34] little bit of meal that's left that I'm
[1:14:36] going to make my last meal for me and my
[1:14:38] son and then I'm going to die but you
[1:14:40] know what Elijah told her he said lady
[1:14:42] if you'll go first and you'll bring unto
[1:14:44] me if you'll give unto God first then
[1:14:46] I'll give you thus sayeth the Lord that
[1:14:48] your meal bear will never run dry your
[1:14:50] cruise of oil will never run dry and the
[1:14:53] Bible said that the lady obey made and
[1:14:55] she did according to the sayings of
[1:14:57] Elijah and that day in her house the
[1:15:00] Bible said her house did eat many days
[1:15:02] because she did according to the saying
[1:15:05] of Elijah you see what he offered her he
[1:15:07] offered her an investment what would you
[1:15:09] give to God you don't don't you realize
[1:15:11] it was one meal that she offered but but
[1:15:14] it was all that she had and because she
[1:15:16] was willing to give it and then God he
[1:15:17] filled up her oil he filled up her meal
[1:15:20] Bell and the next day and the next week
[1:15:22] and the many days after it continued it
[1:15:25] didn't matter how much she took out of
[1:15:26] it I think she could have invited some
[1:15:27] friends over for dinner and she could
[1:15:29] have fed every one of them and the next
[1:15:31] day should have got up and the oil
[1:15:33] Cruise would have been full and the meal
[1:15:34] bear would have been full because she
[1:15:36] made the right
[1:15:39] investment that was go God was waiting
[1:15:41] to make an investment Bible said she did
[1:15:43] according to the saying of Elijah and
[1:15:45] her house did eat many days I love how
[1:15:47] this is working you know you know as a
[1:15:49] preacher you find Little Things Way
[1:15:50] Things are Written they just kind of
[1:15:52] stick out to you but you notice the
[1:15:53] Bible doesn't say that she did according
[1:15:55] according to the word of Elijah it says
[1:15:58] she did according to the saying of
[1:16:00] Elijah and then the next verse it says
[1:16:03] and her barrel of meal wasted not
[1:16:05] neither did the cruise of oil fail for
[1:16:07] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:16:09] was spoke by Elijah you see what she had
[1:16:12] she had a Vindicated policy she heard
[1:16:15] the saying of Elijah but that's not what
[1:16:17] filled her meal Barrel what filled it is
[1:16:20] because it was a word from the Lord it
[1:16:23] wasn't Elijah's policy Elijah was the
[1:16:25] mouth Elijah was the mouthpiece that God
[1:16:28] used Oh my he was he was the one that
[1:16:30] was carrying the policy around and
[1:16:32] walking he was going door to door
[1:16:34] brother Mark he he knocked on that
[1:16:35] little old widow woman's door and said I
[1:16:36] got a policy to offer you I know I know
[1:16:38] it's a time of drought and I I know it's
[1:16:40] a time of famine and everybody around
[1:16:42] you is about to start but here's a
[1:16:44] policy that how he he he was doing the
[1:16:45] door too sales I wonder how many times
[1:16:48] that he knocked on our door a Vindicated
[1:16:51] policy but what made it Vindicated is it
[1:16:54] was a word from the Lord notice what
[1:16:56] happened with Paul whenever he saw it he
[1:16:58] saw the pillar of fire but said what he
[1:17:00] did when he saw that Pillar of Fire he
[1:17:02] found a firm that was
[1:17:03] reliable makes me want to dance he found
[1:17:06] a firm that was reliable it was a
[1:17:09] reliable investment he said because
[1:17:10] Christ had died and rose again and here
[1:17:12] he was again in that same Pillar of Fire
[1:17:15] he said he wanted to make an investment
[1:17:16] he was a great businessman he had good
[1:17:19] sense so he made the investment and he
[1:17:21] become a bond slave of love to Jesus
[1:17:23] Christ and what an investment that he
[1:17:25] made that's what we all need to
[1:17:28] make you say well brother M how do I
[1:17:30] make that kind of investment see to
[1:17:32] invest but a market means to put
[1:17:34] something into
[1:17:35] it see hardly let me tell you why that
[1:17:38] you have to put something in to make an
[1:17:39] investment if you ever if you ever go to
[1:17:41] the bank you know what the bank ask you
[1:17:43] if you want to buy a truck or a house
[1:17:44] the bank always says well you have to
[1:17:46] make a down payment see the reason they
[1:17:48] make you make a down payment is because
[1:17:51] if you put something into it you're less
[1:17:54] likely to walk away from it because it's
[1:17:56] yours so you put they call putting a
[1:17:58] little skin in the game so you so you
[1:18:00] put something in so see so so to invest
[1:18:02] means to put something in and when you
[1:18:04] make a a down payment you won't walk
[1:18:06] away from your investment see so so if
[1:18:08] you had an investment I wonder if I
[1:18:10] could say this this way tonight but if
[1:18:11] you had an investment that was
[1:18:13] guaranteed how much would you put into
[1:18:16] it think about it if you had a
[1:18:18] guaranteed investment what would you put
[1:18:21] in in the natural what would you put in
[1:18:23] if you knew it was guaranteed you just
[1:18:25] going to make whatever you you're going
[1:18:27] to make a 100% on your money and in 30
[1:18:29] days how much of your money would you
[1:18:31] put into it you'd put everything if it
[1:18:33] was guaranteed see this is the way it is
[1:18:35] spiritually see in order to reap the
[1:18:38] greatest reward your reward is off of
[1:18:40] what you put in and when you put
[1:18:42] something in you get something out but
[1:18:44] even talked about our local assembly
[1:18:45] when you come to the house of God that
[1:18:47] you get out of it more than you put in
[1:18:49] it why because you're making an
[1:18:50] investment for something that you want
[1:18:51] to receive and so you go to your prayer
[1:18:53] closet and you start praying for the
[1:18:55] services and you you drive down the road
[1:18:57] and you're listening to a tape and
[1:18:58] you're and you're singing songs you're
[1:18:59] not you you get your mind off the world
[1:19:01] and you come to the house of God what
[1:19:03] you're investing in the service that
[1:19:05] you're about to go in because you want
[1:19:06] to receive something from the Lord and
[1:19:09] God is Duty bound to give you a return
[1:19:11] on your investment an't that wonderful
[1:19:13] how God is he says see so if we want to
[1:19:15] reap something friends we got a we've
[1:19:17] got an investment but Jared that you can
[1:19:20] reap the greatest reward of all which is
[1:19:23] life what can anybody are for you than
[1:19:25] life what's greater than life I mean
[1:19:27] there there there's there's all kinds of
[1:19:30] of investors you know brother Mark but
[1:19:31] that's what we're looking for we're
[1:19:33] looking for a long-term investment I'm
[1:19:35] not I'm not here for the you know they
[1:19:36] they have what in the stock market this
[1:19:38] is free but in the stock market they
[1:19:39] have what they call day Traders that's
[1:19:41] the people that go in every day they put
[1:19:42] a little money in they take it out every
[1:19:44] night they're just kind of working on
[1:19:45] the on the moves but we're not day
[1:19:47] Traders we're here for the long term and
[1:19:49] sometimes see you me tell you what a day
[1:19:51] trader will do oh boy but a day trader
[1:19:53] they'll come in and they have a bad day
[1:19:54] they'll take all their money out they'll
[1:19:56] they'll have a little bit of a a rough
[1:19:58] thing happen or maybe somebody looked at
[1:19:59] them wrong at church well I'm not going
[1:20:01] to go back there they'll just pull their
[1:20:02] investment back out maybe maybe the
[1:20:04] preacher said something they didn't like
[1:20:05] well they're a day trader so they ain't
[1:20:06] going to come back tomorrow but we ain't
[1:20:08] day Traders we we come to make a
[1:20:09] long-term investment that's why you can
[1:20:12] preach and the and the Holy Ghost can
[1:20:13] move and God can step on our toes and we
[1:20:16] can take correction because we're not
[1:20:17] here day by day we're long-term
[1:20:20] investors and we're we're looking for
[1:20:21] the that that that return of eternal
[1:20:23] life so see we these these things that
[1:20:26] happen day to day they don't affect us
[1:20:27] you're you're guess what brother Mark
[1:20:29] your car your tire can go flat and
[1:20:31] you're still a Christian tonight you the
[1:20:33] the trailer can break down brother the
[1:20:34] Joe and you're still the same believer
[1:20:36] you was you'll see you'll fix the
[1:20:37] trailer you'll Grumble about a little
[1:20:39] bit and you'll you'll lug that old
[1:20:40] broken trailer all the way to the house
[1:20:41] of God so you can worship God why
[1:20:43] because you're not a day trader you're a
[1:20:45] long-term investor that's what we are
[1:20:47] tonight but B said I'm showing you a
[1:20:49] real investment to make he said put your
[1:20:51] life and your time and your money and
[1:20:53] your talent put everything you've got in
[1:20:56] Christ God God guaranteed this to us by
[1:20:58] raising him up again we'll rise in the
[1:21:01] last days he promised it what more could
[1:21:03] you look forward to tell me any
[1:21:05] investment that you could make that
[1:21:06] would pay off like that tell me what you
[1:21:09] could invest in this morning that would
[1:21:11] make $1 million but tomorrow you'd be a
[1:21:13] corpse what good would it do you what
[1:21:15] profit the Bible says what would it
[1:21:17] profit a man to gain the whole world and
[1:21:18] lose his own soul says but take what we
[1:21:21] have and and use it for the kingdom of
[1:21:23] God take what we having used it for
[1:21:25] Christ and God guaranteed us and then
[1:21:28] showed us the guarantee by raising
[1:21:30] Christ from the dead that when the in
[1:21:32] the last days we'll rise with him you
[1:21:35] say brother Matt I I know I'm I'm I'm
[1:21:36] about running out of time but you know
[1:21:38] you say you say well how how do I know
[1:21:40] God will see it you realize the things
[1:21:43] that we do that God go that there
[1:21:45] Investments that we make in the kingdom
[1:21:47] of God every every time you pray for
[1:21:48] somebody every little bit you help you
[1:21:51] remember St Martin he tells his
[1:21:52] testimony of how that he went out
[1:21:55] and and he saw a beggar on the street
[1:21:57] and he said he took his coat and because
[1:21:59] it was out in the freezing cold weather
[1:22:01] and he took the coat and he cut the coat
[1:22:02] in half and he gave half of it to the
[1:22:04] beggar and covered him up with it and he
[1:22:06] went back home covered up with the other
[1:22:07] half of his coat and that night he had a
[1:22:10] dream and in the dream he said he saw
[1:22:13] that the Lord appeared to him and when
[1:22:14] the Lord appeared to him he was wearing
[1:22:16] the coat that he had taken off I thought
[1:22:19] here he was wearing this whole coat and
[1:22:21] you said well what what does it mean it
[1:22:23] meant God saw what he done
[1:22:25] and here that he showed him the the
[1:22:27] little thing that You' done for him that
[1:22:29] you done unto me brother said we ought
[1:22:31] to take that for a lesson he said
[1:22:32] whatever you do to somebody you're doing
[1:22:34] it to Christ he said remember let's you
[1:22:37] you say that together he said what you
[1:22:39] do for others you have done to Christ
[1:22:41] can we say that tonight what you do for
[1:22:43] others you have done to Christ see he
[1:22:46] sees your investment you say well that
[1:22:48] was just a little old beggar but but it
[1:22:50] was something that he done and and it
[1:22:52] maybe it was just something from his
[1:22:53] heart but God SE what he done and he
[1:22:55] rewarded him for what he done do you
[1:22:57] realize there ain't nothing you can vest
[1:22:59] that God doesn't see and that he won't
[1:23:01] reward any big thing any little thing
[1:23:04] that you do you know the Bible tells us
[1:23:06] a story of Cornelius Bible said he was a
[1:23:08] devout man of God he was a man that was
[1:23:11] uh that was that had wealth and and and
[1:23:14] but he went out the Bible said he was a
[1:23:15] a devout man and he gave much arms to
[1:23:17] the people and he prayed to God always
[1:23:20] you know you know how many people must
[1:23:22] have loved seeing seeing Cornelius come
[1:23:24] he was an old Gentile he wasn't no Holy
[1:23:27] Ghost filled man he was just a gentile
[1:23:28] come out of the out of the out of the
[1:23:30] the group of of men or centurions but
[1:23:33] but he but he but he loved the Lord and
[1:23:35] he and he prayed to God always and he
[1:23:36] would always he give to the poor and and
[1:23:38] and then and and then the Bible says but
[1:23:41] then he saw a vision and in the vision
[1:23:43] that God came to him and said the angel
[1:23:45] of the Lord came to him and when he
[1:23:46] looked on him he said Lord what would
[1:23:48] you say to me and the angel said to him
[1:23:50] your prayer and your arms have come up
[1:23:53] as a memorial before God is that
[1:23:56] something here is a man that had devoted
[1:23:58] his life and where he was a devout man
[1:24:00] and the angel of the Lord would tell him
[1:24:02] that my it wasn't it wasn't that that
[1:24:04] that everybody else saw it but the angel
[1:24:06] of the Lord said your prayer and your
[1:24:08] arms have came up as a memorial unto God
[1:24:12] my what how that how that must have felt
[1:24:14] to hear this man to know that what you
[1:24:16] have done has reached the Throne of God
[1:24:19] you know what you do it may not be a
[1:24:20] great thing it may not it may not make
[1:24:22] the papers it it may not may not be
[1:24:24] announced at every service it might not
[1:24:26] make the evening news and sometimes you
[1:24:28] may feel like like you're doing
[1:24:30] everything in vain but friends it
[1:24:31] reached the right place because
[1:24:33] everything he done it reached the Throne
[1:24:35] of God in so much that God sent an angel
[1:24:37] of the Lord down to where he was and he
[1:24:39] said I saw your investment I saw every
[1:24:42] time you gave to the poor I saw all the
[1:24:44] arms all the prayers that you made he
[1:24:46] said he's reached the Throne of God and
[1:24:48] let me tell you what God did brother
[1:24:50] Mark he gave him a reward for the
[1:24:52] investment he said Lord what would you
[1:24:54] do he said you call a man by the name of
[1:24:56] Simon Peter to your house and he has a
[1:24:58] word for you and when he called on Simon
[1:25:00] Peter Peter went to his house he
[1:25:02] remember the the Lord showed Peter a
[1:25:03] vision of how that he would he would go
[1:25:05] and take the unclean and he would gather
[1:25:07] around and eat it and Peter said I'm a
[1:25:09] Jew I'm not going to eat of an unclean
[1:25:10] thing I've never ate of an unclean thing
[1:25:12] and God said don't you call what I've
[1:25:14] clean don't you call it common or
[1:25:16] unclean but but then then a man comes in
[1:25:18] and says Peter you're called to this
[1:25:20] gentille's house and all the sudden he
[1:25:21] gets a revelation of what of what the
[1:25:23] vision meant God was calling him to be
[1:25:25] able to go speak to this Gentile so he
[1:25:27] goes down and Cornelius begins to tell
[1:25:29] him he said I I don't know why I invited
[1:25:31] you he said I just know that the angel
[1:25:32] of the Lord appeared to me and he told
[1:25:34] me that the things that I've done for
[1:25:36] God that God seen it and they've reached
[1:25:37] the Throne of God and he said that you
[1:25:39] had a word to give to me and Peter told
[1:25:42] him the only word that he knew he said I
[1:25:44] I don't know a lot but I'll just tell
[1:25:46] you this he said there was a man by the
[1:25:48] name of Jesus and he came and he walked
[1:25:51] upon these Shores and and he was taken
[1:25:53] by by the these centurions and he was he
[1:25:55] was taken into captivity and he was hung
[1:25:58] upon a cross of Calvary and he and he
[1:26:00] bled and died for the sins of man and
[1:26:02] they buried him in a tomb down there and
[1:26:04] in three days he resurrected out of the
[1:26:06] Tomb and he came and he walked among us
[1:26:08] and we saw it whenever he ascended into
[1:26:10] Glory but that wasn't the end of the
[1:26:12] story he sent the Holy Ghost back down
[1:26:14] as he promised to the Believers and the
[1:26:16] Bible said while Peter was speaking unto
[1:26:18] them that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:21] fell upon the Gentiles in so much that
[1:26:23] they all began to Marvel and they
[1:26:25] weren't marveling that the Holy Ghost
[1:26:27] had fail they were marveling that the
[1:26:29] Gentiles had received the same thing
[1:26:32] that was promised under the Jew I
[1:26:33] thought my isn't it something it was an
[1:26:35] investment that God had offered to him
[1:26:38] and he had heard it and he took a hold
[1:26:39] of it and he invested and God gave him a
[1:26:42] return on his investment see when it
[1:26:44] reaches the Throne of God God always
[1:26:46] brings his promise let me tell you why
[1:26:49] because God is isin that something
[1:26:52] hearing all that God was doing to those
[1:26:54] people in that day in the out of the
[1:26:56] book of Acts they were out there
[1:26:57] preaching this great move of God that
[1:26:59] God would go to this little cornelius's
[1:27:02] house and in everything God was doing
[1:27:05] but he would see that one man and see
[1:27:07] everything that he done and he would
[1:27:10] bring him the promise that he had
[1:27:12] promised to the
[1:27:13] Gentile is't it something God sees your
[1:27:16] investment if the music players come I
[1:27:18] done run out of time he sees our
[1:27:21] investment Paul said it like this he
[1:27:24] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:26] the earnest of our inheritance in other
[1:27:29] words it's the down payment of of being
[1:27:31] able to receive what God has promised to
[1:27:34] us say the down payment of a Divine
[1:27:37] promise of God hear that Gentile he what
[1:27:40] an example to us that this Gentile had
[1:27:43] received the promise of God you I think
[1:27:45] I think it's something you know many
[1:27:47] people look at the things God does and
[1:27:49] little simple message little simple
[1:27:51] things that's going on sometimes but you
[1:27:54] realize that God is big enough to be God
[1:27:57] to every
[1:28:00] individual I think I think of it like
[1:28:02] this most of the time when people look
[1:28:05] at God they look at God to do great
[1:28:08] things in order to say he's
[1:28:11] God if God will move a mountain well
[1:28:14] I'll just serve him all my
[1:28:16] life I won know how many of y'all I was
[1:28:18] I was testifying to a brother the other
[1:28:20] day and we were sitting there talking
[1:28:22] about being kids and I said you know
[1:28:24] we we hear the stories of the things
[1:28:26] that that God done and how brother BR go
[1:28:28] over and and and created squirrels it
[1:28:30] wasn't so we' go create squirrels but I
[1:28:32] don't know how many of us I I don't know
[1:28:34] about y'all but I'll just admit it I
[1:28:36] don't know how many y'all ever sat in
[1:28:37] the woods as a 12-year-old boy and said
[1:28:39] let there be a 10-point buck coming out
[1:28:43] behind the that white oak tree I tried
[1:28:46] it y'all y'all y'all shake your heads
[1:28:49] but y'all may as well admit
[1:28:50] it yeah I see y'all let's I mean Lord if
[1:28:54] it worked for a prophet Lord could just
[1:28:56] be a big old 12p pointer come out behind
[1:28:59] that tree right now see but because
[1:29:02] because God is he's a god of the
[1:29:04] individual he but you know I think about
[1:29:07] these things that God does and Lord if
[1:29:08] you do that I I'll serve you all the
[1:29:10] days of my life the goofy things we do
[1:29:12] as kids you know God Winks at our
[1:29:15] ignorance but then we we we come and we
[1:29:18] we get older and we get to look at these
[1:29:21] things that God does and hear the mighty
[1:29:22] Miracles and and sometimes we get so
[1:29:25] caught up in Miracles that we in order
[1:29:27] to even believe God or have faith or
[1:29:29] grow in faith then we have to see God do
[1:29:31] the great miraculous things but you know
[1:29:34] what does something for me is that
[1:29:36] brother Travis it ain't the big things
[1:29:38] that God does that makes God bigger it's
[1:29:41] that God is so big that he can do things
[1:29:44] that don't mean nothing to nobody but
[1:29:47] you he is so big that he can do little
[1:29:50] things that God the Creator could see
[1:29:54] little things in your ordinary life that
[1:29:55] don't don't mean nothing to nobody but
[1:29:57] they mean something to you and he's that
[1:29:59] big of a god it ain't B I don't you know
[1:30:02] everybody's looking for miracles that
[1:30:03] ain't the miracle that ain't what makes
[1:30:05] God great to me what makes God great to
[1:30:08] me is he cares about the little things
[1:30:10] we do and what we give and the arms of
[1:30:13] prayers and you know the other day I was
[1:30:16] I was actually had uh was about to go on
[1:30:19] a trip and and
[1:30:21] um I had I had a little pistol that I
[1:30:24] bought from Brother Phil and I I really
[1:30:25] liked it it it fit I have small hands
[1:30:27] and it fit my hand really well and so I
[1:30:30] you know I could pack it around and I I
[1:30:32] I really enjoyed it well after you know
[1:30:34] I had it for a few months there well
[1:30:36] then I I I I misplaced it and had it in
[1:30:38] the console of my truck and went out one
[1:30:40] day it wasn't there but I kept thinking
[1:30:42] well I'll just find it and I kept
[1:30:43] looking around the house looked in the
[1:30:44] safe come looked at the church looked at
[1:30:46] my wife's truck looked in kids truck
[1:30:48] just maybe they took it whatever I but I
[1:30:50] looked everywhere and never could find
[1:30:51] it so I you know I thought well I just
[1:30:53] kept putting it off next day next day
[1:30:55] you know and well when I got ready to
[1:30:56] leave on my trip it got to really bother
[1:30:58] me and I thought you know I I don't want
[1:31:00] to go on this trip and I still hadn't
[1:31:01] found it so it got it it really started
[1:31:03] troubling me and so you know for one I
[1:31:05] don't know if you you know any of y'all
[1:31:06] have guns you like your guns you know
[1:31:08] this is this something it kind of meant
[1:31:09] something to me I liked it and and uh
[1:31:11] you you know you like you like your guns
[1:31:14] and so when you lose something like that
[1:31:16] you want it back and so you uh you
[1:31:19] brother Joe borrowed a gun from me he
[1:31:21] gets tickled at my story but uh but when
[1:31:23] you lose some something you you you want
[1:31:24] it back and so I you know I I I I got to
[1:31:28] it got bothering me and so I looked at
[1:31:29] her I couldn't find it I called my wife
[1:31:30] said you know anywhere there would be
[1:31:32] and so she she said I I don't I don't

[1:31:35] here I was I was about to fly out this
[1:31:37] is on Sunday afternoon here I'm about to
[1:31:38] fly out and and uh but it got to bother
[1:31:41] me it it troubled my spirit I told my
[1:31:42] wife on the phone I I was telling
[1:31:44] brothers and I said you know this is
[1:31:46] this this bothers me because I you know
[1:31:48] it's something that I really I wanted
[1:31:50] but let worse than that what if somebody

[1:31:54] then you're upset cuz somebody took your
[1:31:55] stuff you know why would they get in my
[1:31:56] truck and who would who would do a thing
[1:31:58] like that you know you just get trouble
[1:31:59] in your spirit and so I just ask can
[1:32:01] y'all pray that the Lord help me find
[1:32:03] this and here I am and and uh we we was
[1:32:07] well I was going to leave the next day
[1:32:08] and so I and brother jar was going to
[1:32:10] come over the house and and pick me up
[1:32:12] and and and so so I I I was sitting
[1:32:14] there and troubled about it and and then
[1:32:16] while I was while I was going through
[1:32:17] this I get a text message from Brother
[1:32:19] Tom Allen and brother Tom he he writes
[1:32:21] on there and he says hey just want to
[1:32:23] let you know I enjoyed that service this
[1:32:25] morning the what you preached it was
[1:32:26] really really meant a lot to me and I
[1:32:28] appreciated and something along them
[1:32:29] lines and I said well brother Tom I
[1:32:31] appreciate that that was very that was
[1:32:32] very thoughtful of you and so you know I
[1:32:34] get out there I pulled up my driveway
[1:32:36] and and uh and so I I walk out and I
[1:32:39] look and the weather's you know it's
[1:32:40] kind of cool outside and I got thinking
[1:32:42] about you know brother Tom sent that and
[1:32:44] I said you know that was nice of him to
[1:32:46] to send that and that the you know just
[1:32:48] just you know that the Lord had put on
[1:32:49] his heart or something that I'm glad it
[1:32:50] meant something to him and I look at the
[1:32:52] weather of course you know brother Tom
[1:32:53] he he he likes to play tennis and and uh
[1:32:56] he's 70 70 or he's 68 years old and and
[1:33:00] uh and so he and he likes to play tennis
[1:33:02] and so and and I I enjoy going out and
[1:33:04] visiting with him having fellowship and
[1:33:06] and so when I thought about that I
[1:33:08] looked at the weather and I thought you
[1:33:09] know uh brother Tom like to play tennis
[1:33:11] today and because he just sent that text
[1:33:14] and I look up on my shelf and there's a
[1:33:15] tennis racket bag that Salem had put on
[1:33:17] the shelf and I thought you got to be
[1:33:19] kidding me so I walked over and I took
[1:33:21] the bag off the shelf and unzipped it
[1:33:22] and there my pistol was laying there I
[1:33:25] thought you know how odd this is you
[1:33:26] know it don't mean nothing to some of
[1:33:28] y'all think I'm nuts for even telling
[1:33:29] that but you know it meant something to
[1:33:30] me and that's how big God is that he's
[1:33:34] so big that he could do something that
[1:33:35] don't mean nothing to nobody else but he
[1:33:38] would have that guy at that time when I
[1:33:40] said will yall PR please pray and Lord
[1:33:42] Lord Lord help me then this guy that
[1:33:43] very guy that would cause me to look at
[1:33:45] that this is how big God is orchestrate
[1:33:48] so many little things but let me tell
[1:33:49] you he ain't just that way for me he can
[1:33:51] do that for every one of us every day
[1:33:54] he's that big of a God what a revelation
[1:33:56] it is to catch that God is so big he can
[1:33:59] do little things he tells us to call on
[1:34:02] him no wonder we friends no wonder we
[1:34:04] can look and say that that's something I
[1:34:06] can dedicate my life to I wonder how
[1:34:08] many today if you stand to your feet say
[1:34:11] brother mat that that's something that's
[1:34:12] that's the kind of God that we serve and
[1:34:15] I I want to I want to give everything
[1:34:16] that I have to him I want to give all my
[1:34:19] worship I want to give my life I want to
[1:34:21] give my my my ambitions everything that
[1:34:23] I do I I want to dedicate it to the work
[1:34:26] or the cause of Jesus Christ isn't that
[1:34:28] our prayer Lord that you would receive
[1:34:30] us Lord that receive what we have to
