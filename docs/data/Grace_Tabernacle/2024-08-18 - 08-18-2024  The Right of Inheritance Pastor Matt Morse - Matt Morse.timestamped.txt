[41:45] daughter that wants to get married then
[41:47] you uh you may pick up a little bit on
[41:50] it but you me we just just trust the
[41:52] Lord is in control amen you love the
[41:55] Lord amen just uh I I really like Xavier
[41:58] and he I got the privilege of witnessing
[42:01] him proposed to my daughter and they
[42:04] call that a they call that a privilege I
[42:06] guess I don't know but uh but I I
[42:09] certainly uh appreciate what the Lord
[42:11] has done in his life and and uh so just
[42:14] want to be able to be a support to them
[42:17] amen so um but we just want to read out
[42:19] of the book of Jeremiah the 32nd chapter
[42:22] we'll read from the first verse the
[42:24] Bible says in the word that came to
[42:26] Jeremiah
[42:27] from the Lord in the 10th year of
[42:29] zedekiah the king of Judah which was the
[42:31] 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar for then the
[42:34] king of babylon's army besieged
[42:36] Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was
[42:38] shut up in the court of the prison which
[42:39] was in the king of judah's house now uh
[42:42] we know that there in this time that
[42:44] Israel and Judah they were two different
[42:46] nations so each one had their own King
[42:48] and so this came after Babylon had
[42:50] already taken over Jerusalem but now uh
[42:53] in taking over that here he was Jeremiah
[42:56] began to prophesy that he wasn't just
[42:57] going to stop there that they were
[42:59] coming into Judah and the and the King
[43:01] zedekiah that was the king over Judah
[43:03] would fall unto this unto the the king
[43:06] of Babylon and and and so he he would
[43:09] prophesy this and the Bible says that
[43:10] zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him
[43:12] up saying in other words had locked him
[43:14] into prison and asked Jeremiah why do
[43:16] you prophesy these things why do you say
[43:18] thus sayith the Lord I will give this
[43:19] city to the hand of the king of Babylon
[43:21] and he shall take it and zedekiah the
[43:23] king of Judah shall not Escape out of
[43:25] the hands of the Chans but surely shall
[43:27] be delivered into the hand of the king
[43:28] of Babylon and shall speak with him by
[43:31] mouth to his mouth and and and his eyes
[43:33] shall be behold his eyes and he shall
[43:35] lead zedekiah to Babylon and there shall
[43:38] be there shall he be until I visit him
[43:40] sayeth the Lord though you fight with
[43:42] the Chans you shall not Prosper this is
[43:44] the question that zedekiah asked
[43:46] Jeremiah why are you saying these things
[43:48] Jeremiah returned he said that the word
[43:51] of the Lord came unto me saying behold
[43:53] Hanam the son of Shalom thine Uncle
[43:55] shall come unto thee saying by thee my
[43:58] field that is in anathoth for the ride
[44:00] of redemption is thine to buy so Hanam
[44:03] my uncle's son came to me in the court
[44:05] of the prison according to the word of
[44:07] the Lord and he said unto me by my field
[44:10] I pray that is in anoth which is in the
[44:12] country of Benjamin for the right of
[44:14] inheritance is thine and the Redemption
[44:17] is thine so buy it for thyself and then
[44:20] I knew that this was the word of the
[44:23] Lord so here the Lord had told him this
[44:24] is going to take place and when you see
[44:26] this take place then you'll know it's my
[44:28] word and and Jeremiah said and then it
[44:30] took place just as as God said it would
[44:32] so I know it was the word of the Lord so
[44:34] I just want to ask the Lord to add his
[44:36] Blessing to the reading of the word as
[44:37] you take your seats this morning and uh
[44:40] just uh as a title would would uh like
[44:42] to speak on the right of inheritance um
[44:45] we were been speaking over the past few
[44:48] weeks on the man of iniquity being
[44:49] revealed and and and looking at this man
[44:52] of of iniquity and uh showing how that
[44:55] in the end time that he would lose his
[44:57] dominion over the Believers that he
[44:59] would be uh exposed uh to the church
[45:02] that he was powerless this great uh this
[45:05] great power that's been over the church
[45:06] and has put the church under so much
[45:08] dominion and uh remember last week we
[45:10] had gone into the what the devil's
[45:12] fourpoint scheme was if you remember uh
[45:15] that that the the in the first four
[45:17] seals that we saw this come to pass and
[45:20] each one revealing uh another part of
[45:22] Satan's plan and the first it was a
[45:24] spiritual kill then a political uh Power
[45:27] or when the church and the state United
[45:29] then the third which was when the souls
[45:31] were uh LED astray when he
[45:34] would when he would give out his
[45:36] Doctrine and uh and then in the fourth
[45:39] and the final uh would be an eternal
[45:41] separation from God and so uh we see
[45:44] that according to the scripture that
[45:45] this was Satan's plan all along if you
[45:47] ever if you're a Bible reader you'll
[45:49] find out the Bible says that all Souls
[45:51] belong to God and so Satan's plan all
[45:54] along has been to separate Souls from
[45:57] their creator this has been uh to so to
[46:00] come to a place of Eternal separation
[46:02] this has been a part of of Satan's plan
[46:04] but we realize that being that this was
[46:06] his plan but at the opening of the seals
[46:09] that Satan's plan was revealed to the
[46:11] church and though the world may not know
[46:13] it but it's it's a personal thing
[46:15] between you and God uh that that that it
[46:18] has that the Revelation has come in this
[46:19] hour and brother brm would say it like
[46:21] this he said by Revelation that the
[46:22] church is able to discern and withstand
[46:25] that Antichrist spirit I think God for
[46:27] that today that we have the ability the
[46:29] discernment to be able to to withstand
[46:32] the spirit of antichrist when he would
[46:34] come in and and try to lead people
[46:36] astray and cause you uh uh to turn from
[46:38] and to turn back but but by the
[46:40] discernment by Revelation that God has
[46:42] given us brother B said now Satan will
[46:44] be powerless before her how many say
[46:45] Amen to that amen means so be it says so
[46:48] they'll be powerless before her so he
[46:50] said you know just as it was in the days
[46:52] of Jesus you remember whenever Satan met
[46:54] Jesus up in the desert and he took the
[46:56] word of of God and he began to to
[46:58] misinterpret it and misuse it and
[47:00] misquote it in order to cause Jesus to
[47:03] bow down to him and and to come under
[47:05] his power but but but what Jesus done is
[47:08] he took a true a true interpretation of
[47:10] the word and he would say but it is also
[47:12] written and it is also written and so uh
[47:14] the very actions and the things that he
[47:16] said was was was to truly follow the
[47:19] word that was already written and the
[47:21] Bible says that because of that he
[47:22] withstood the devil and brother R said
[47:24] now the church today that by revelation
[47:26] that Satan will be just as thwarted to
[47:29] her as he was to Jesus when he stood in
[47:31] the desert so where he would try to
[47:33] overcome him he would try to overcome
[47:35] you but just as Jesus overcame him then
[47:37] the church would overcome him today
[47:39] that's why that Satan hates Revelation
[47:41] brother Cody hates the the spirit of God
[47:44] coming into the church he hates the he
[47:46] hates you growing in the word he hates
[47:48] you he hates you falling in love with
[47:50] the word and and you know to to be a
[47:52] word church and a people that come and
[47:54] and that are excited to hear the word of
[47:56] of God Satan hates it he he he don't
[47:58] mind if you come to church and lift your
[48:00] hands a little bit and Shout a little
[48:02] bit and run around and and to sing and
[48:04] clap your hands and all that but what
[48:06] Satan hates is he hates that you have a
[48:08] desire in your heart to gain revelation
[48:10] of God he hates it because he knows that
[48:13] Revelation is what will make him
[48:14] powerless before you and the Bible would
[48:17] tell us like this but when that
[48:18] Revelation comes that the Gates of Hell
[48:20] cannot Prevail against you but you shall
[48:22] Prevail over it so where are we today
[48:25] brother Mark we're sitting in Heavenly
[48:27] places in Christ Jesus we're feeding on
[48:29] the Mana from God the very thing that
[48:32] God has sent in this church we're taking
[48:34] communion as a prophet would say it like
[48:36] this we're taking communion out of the
[48:38] hands of the Creator he in other words
[48:41] he is feeding the church isn't it
[48:42] something to think that that we're not
[48:44] just feeding upon some theology or
[48:46] something that man has come up with
[48:48] you're not here just to feed off brother
[48:49] Matt but you're feeding out of the hands
[48:52] of the Creator the very the very one
[48:54] that created the heavens and the Earth
[48:56] the same Jesus that fed 5,000 with with
[48:59] two fish and five loaves of bread that
[49:01] same that same one whose hands were
[49:03] scarred with nails when he hung up on
[49:05] calvary's Cross he said we're feeding
[49:07] out of those same hands this morning I I
[49:09] don't know about you but I believe that
[49:10] this morning I believe that that he
[49:12] still feeds the 5,000 how many believes
[49:14] that I believe that God still feeds his
[49:16] church I I don't believe that we're
[49:17] feeding on something from an old day or
[49:20] some day gone by but I believe that God
[49:22] is feeding his church fresh manner this
[49:24] morning and I believe that if you'll get
[49:25] a people to together that'll get a hold
[49:27] of God and you'll get a a people that
[49:29] have a desire in their heart to hear
[49:31] from God and you'll get some ministers
[49:33] that are dedicated to to being able to
[49:35] surrender to God then God will come in
[49:37] the house of God this morning and he can
[49:39] still feed his children he can still
[49:41] help you he can he he's he's an ontime
[49:43] God he he's a god of today he's not just
[49:46] a god of yesterday he he ain't just a
[49:48] god of history but he's a god that is
[49:50] relevant to the situations and the
[49:52] things that we're facing today he's
[49:53] still feeding his children he still
[49:55] feeds the hungry he still feeds the
[49:57] longing Soul the Bible said blessed is
[49:59] he that hunger and thirst after
[50:01] righteousness for he shall be filled I
[50:03] believe God is still feeding us this
[50:05] morning you believe that he still feeds
[50:07] you say well how is he feeding us he's
[50:08] feeding the church on the bread of
[50:11] Revelation brother Mark the very thing
[50:12] that has been kept for 2,000 years that
[50:15] has been a mystery to the church and it
[50:17] was has been kept and it was hidden and
[50:19] it was locked away but today we realize
[50:22] that that's what the church is feeding
[50:23] on that's what we're uh we're built on
[50:25] and strengthened on and so we see that
[50:27] we're that what was kept it has now been
[50:30] revealed and now we're coming into this
[50:32] age of communion do you see where we are
[50:34] we're in this age of feeding and drawing
[50:36] strength and strengthening this body
[50:38] that it would be able to take a Rapture
[50:40] my isn't that something to give it
[50:41] enough strength to be able to step out
[50:43] of one dimension into another whenever
[50:45] you you know if you ever went into the
[50:47] Olympics or you want to do some great
[50:49] event you would have to you'd have to
[50:51] you'd have to exercise and they they
[50:53] they' feed them the right kind of a diet
[50:54] so that you could run the race that was
[50:56] set before you but I thank God that
[50:58] knowing the race that we would have to
[51:00] run that here this church would have to
[51:01] take a body change and she would have to
[51:03] do something that that that no body of
[51:06] people had ever done before but he said
[51:08] in order for her to be able to do it
[51:10] well then you'd have to have the right
[51:11] kind of strength and we'd have to have
[51:13] the right kind of exercise and I thank
[51:15] God that he's given us the right diet
[51:17] that this body that we could be able to
[51:19] feed upon the word of God brother Mark
[51:21] that by the feeding of the word of God
[51:23] that it would change this Mortal body
[51:25] and no longer would we be B by this old
[51:27] flesh and the and the pressures and the
[51:29] chains and the sicknesses of things that
[51:31] we fight every day but one day this body
[51:33] it'll step out of this robe of Flesh and
[51:35] walk right into eternity with God why
[51:38] because we're feeding upon the word of
[51:40] God see we're feeding on it it'll change
[51:42] your body it it it'll change every it'll
[51:45] change everything about us it'll change
[51:46] our dwelling place and now we see this
[51:49] in the church at where we are today and
[51:50] being able to feed upon the revealing of
[51:53] God's word but but in the book of
[51:55] Jeremiah you'll find that here is a
[51:57] natural typ of what what is taking place
[51:59] with the church today whenever we we
[52:01] read the opening scripture you see that
[52:03] what was happening in the book of
[52:05] Jeremiah is that here it was the time of
[52:07] the Babylonian war and brother Joe it
[52:09] was it was a it was a time of of of
[52:13] oncoming captivity and here here that
[52:15] that God was bringing this judgment upon
[52:17] them but in this time the Lord begins to
[52:20] speak to Jeremiah and he tells him what
[52:22] is going to take place and in and so he
[52:25] says to him he says you you know know
[52:26] there your your your brother or or kin
[52:28] folk is going to come to you and he's
[52:30] going to offer you this land and and I
[52:32] want you to take the money and purchase
[52:34] the land and and God begins to tell him
[52:36] what is going to what is going to happen
[52:38] and how how everything would fall into
[52:40] place and how the king would go into
[52:42] captivity but he says I want you to make
[52:44] the purchase and I love how it's written
[52:45] in the Bible because the Bible says it
[52:47] was an act of redemption the the
[52:49] purchase that he made was a was because
[52:51] he had the rights to Redemption so he
[52:53] had in other words he had a redeeming
[52:54] power there was a there was a seeming
[52:56] virtue about Jeremiah that he had the
[52:58] right and the and the funds and the
[53:00] capability of purchasing this property
[53:03] and then the Bible would tell him or the
[53:04] Lord would tell him to go on and then
[53:06] and to ride it and make a record of it
[53:08] and so he went and he made the purchase
[53:10] and he wrote and he took out 17 uh
[53:12] pieces of silver and he measured out the
[53:13] silver and he made the he paid for it he
[53:15] wrote it down on the Scrolls and and
[53:17] then he and then he went to to those
[53:19] that would be the the guard over the
[53:21] records and and he would ask them to
[53:23] take the records and and to and to ride
[53:25] it up and to seal it up and and and and
[53:27] as as he would go through this this uh
[53:29] this time that he he would end he would
[53:31] say it like this he would thus sayith
[53:33] the Lord he said take the evidences and
[53:35] the evidence of the purchase both which
[53:37] is sealed and the evidence which is open
[53:40] and put them in an earn vessel that they
[53:42] may continue for many days for thus
[53:44] saeth the Lord of hosts the god of
[53:46] Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards
[53:49] shall be possessed again in this land I
[53:52] thought isn't this something that here
[53:54] think about what Jeremiah was doing here
[53:56] jeremi IAH knowing that this land was
[53:58] going to be taken knowing that that that
[54:00] he would he that it was going to be uh
[54:02] taken by another kingdom and they would
[54:04] come in and they were going to destroy
[54:06] the buildings and they would destroy the
[54:08] The Vineyards and they would destroy all
[54:09] the everything that was built by Israel
[54:11] here God had showed him the destruction
[54:13] that was going to take place but still
[54:15] yet the very thing the only thing that
[54:17] was that had any value you realize that
[54:19] silver in in Judah was the same thing as
[54:22] silver in Babylon silver was a precious
[54:24] commodity it was something that that
[54:26] that was of value to Jeremiah but
[54:28] brother Travis He took that silver and
[54:30] he bought something that he knew was
[54:32] going to be taken away isn't that
[54:34] something he he bought something that he
[54:35] knew that Babylon would come in and they
[54:37] would take it over and all of Israel
[54:39] would be taken into captivity and they
[54:41] they wouldn't even be able to have
[54:43] access to the land that he was
[54:44] purchasing but Jeremiah because he knew
[54:47] what God was going to do and God began
[54:49] to reveal to him what would happen he
[54:51] bought it and he sealed it up and
[54:53] knowing that one day that God would
[54:55] bring his children back back into that
[54:56] land I thought isn't it something what a
[54:58] thought of a prophet brother Mah that he
[55:00] would say that I want you to seal this
[55:02] up in an earth and vessel that it would
[55:04] last for many days cuz I'm here to tell
[55:06] you that one day that God's children
[55:08] will come back into this land again and
[55:10] when they come back into this land I
[55:12] want them to be able to go to that
[55:14] vessel and break it open I want the seal
[55:16] to be able to be taken off of it and
[55:18] them to be able to know what belongs to
[55:20] them in this land and that it wasn't
[55:22] just no it wasn't no argument it wasn't
[55:24] a debate but the price of it at had been
[55:26] paid it was redeemed there was a receipt
[55:29] of record that was put in the vessel so
[55:31] that whenever they returned to this land
[55:33] that they know that they could have it
[55:34] oh friends let me tell you what he knew
[55:36] he knew that one day that they'd go back
[55:38] into the land he knew that when they
[55:40] went by that the land would be fruitful
[55:42] he knew that it would be free of false
[55:44] gods he knew that all of the idolatry
[55:46] that had been built in it would be tore
[55:48] down he knew that the Groves of baale
[55:50] would be destroyed by Babylon he said
[55:52] but whenever the children of God can
[55:54] come back into this place that it would
[55:56] be a fruitful place when this Crow could
[55:58] be open and the promise of that
[56:00] redeeming fruit could come to pass to
[56:02] the Church of God I I I think that one
[56:05] day this is what Jeremiah was doing with
[56:07] his action brother marah he knew that
[56:09] one day that the proof of purchase would
[56:11] be opened he knew that one day that what
[56:13] had been bought would be revealed and
[56:16] that though there would be a people that
[56:18] would receive the inheritance of the
[56:20] Prophet Jeremiah what makes me want to
[56:21] preach on a prophet's inheritance this
[56:23] morning to think that that that he had a
[56:25] mind from the Lord war that told him you
[56:27] seal it up and one day I'll have a
[56:29] people come back to this land and when
[56:31] they open up that vessel they'll know
[56:33] what belongs to
[56:34] them at the time of the revealing then
[56:37] they'd be able to claim it listen what
[56:39] he said they would claim it they would
[56:41] they would harvest food in it they would
[56:43] be able to build houses on it they'll be
[56:45] able to be established on it do you
[56:46] realize what's happening today that the
[56:49] that the very thing that took place in
[56:51] Jeremiah's day in the natural is
[56:53] happening today in the church
[56:54] spiritually that whenever the seal was
[56:57] taken off the book brother Mark what did
[56:58] it do the very thing that a prophet of
[57:01] God saw from the mind of God he said it
[57:03] must be sealed up I'll seal it away
[57:06] until the time of the revealing but
[57:08] whenever it's revealed it'll be open to
[57:10] the church that she can walk into this
[57:11] land again it'll be a fruitful land
[57:14] she'll be able to build on it she'll be
[57:16] able to grow Harvest on it she'll bring
[57:18] forth fruit unto God oh let me tell you
[57:20] it ain't no Barren place it ain't a
[57:22] place it may have been a while that the
[57:24] enemy trumped around on it there was a
[57:26] that Satan had took it over and he and
[57:28] he had took the ways of God and the
[57:30] things of God and he had ruled over it
[57:32] but then there cometh forth a day that
[57:34] the book was open to the Church of the
[57:36] Living God and Satan's power was exposed
[57:39] and he had no power over him anymore it
[57:42] was held in an earn vessel a treasure
[57:44] that was kept you realize what it was it
[57:46] was the same just as it was in the days
[57:48] of Jeremiah brother Mark it was a book
[57:51] of redemption the scroll that we're that
[57:53] that was sealed in in the days of John
[57:56] it was a book of redemption but remember
[57:58] said we believed it to be Redemption he
[58:00] said but it was kept in an Earthly
[58:01] vessel in that same vessel that it was
[58:03] kept in today was one that was that was
[58:06] became flesh and then he died and he
[58:08] rose again and he went into Glory until
[58:11] that time of purchase and then now he
[58:14] said but now at the time of the
[58:16] revealing listen what's happening this
[58:17] is where we are at the time of the
[58:19] revealing it would be brought back to us
[58:22] in Revelation from the hand of God by
[58:25] vindication you see where the church is
[58:27] feeding on today it's by revelation of
[58:29] the word of God this is the importance
[58:31] of the seals being removed the mysteries
[58:34] of God being open to the church is that
[58:36] it would reveal to you what belonged to
[58:38] you as a church it would reveal to you
[58:40] the portion of the word that had you in
[58:42] it that that you wouldn't just read this
[58:44] Bible and say well I don't know if that
[58:45] has to do with me or maybe that's
[58:47] another age but whenever the seal was
[58:49] open you could walk right into the
[58:50] portion of scripture brother Mark that
[58:52] belong to the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[58:54] say this is my inheritance this is what
[58:56] God has called me to I believe I'm the
[58:58] bride of Christ I I believe that God has
[59:00] called us in this hour that we ain't
[59:02] just some another group that is just
[59:04] going to die and go by the wayside and
[59:06] be written in a history book but we're
[59:08] the bride of Christ and we're living in
[59:09] the end time and we're living in the
[59:11] last Church age and one day that final
[59:13] trumpet will be sounded and we'll go
[59:15] meet the Lord in the air it identifies
[59:17] who you are what portion of scripture
[59:20] belongs to you we ain't just wandering
[59:23] around in the Bible laws trying to
[59:24] figure out who we are and where we're
[59:26] going but I thank God that the seal
[59:28] being open has revealed to the church
[59:30] The Inheritance that God has given unto
[59:32] us praise the Lord how many say Amen to
[59:36] that I believe it it's been open how
[59:38] many can say it's been open to me see
[59:41] it's just a this is a personal
[59:43] experience between you and God he said
[59:45] it's going to be brought to us in
[59:46] Revelation from the hand of God by
[59:48] Vindication isn't that something other
[59:50] words but a mark it would take sister
[59:51] Sandy it's sure good to see you God
[59:53] bless you this morning amen how many
[59:55] proud to see sister Sandy make it back
[59:58] God bless
[1:00:01] you now you get a good saint of God
[1:00:03] pulling on you and all a sudden it get
[1:00:05] your attention amen amen but it was
[1:00:07] brought to us brother Mark in a by by by
[1:00:10] Vindication see this the Vindication is
[1:00:13] what gives you authority over the devil
[1:00:17] is't that something see it may not give
[1:00:18] you authority over other people they
[1:00:20] won't they may not believe anything you
[1:00:21] say but what what it will do is it'll
[1:00:23] give you authority over the devil it'll
[1:00:26] put the devil in his place it may it'll
[1:00:28] cause you to be able to stand and be
[1:00:29] able uh to to have the faith because of
[1:00:32] of the Vindication of God it would give
[1:00:34] you the faith to be able to stand
[1:00:36] against the devil and stand against all
[1:00:38] of his tricks you know I I think of the
[1:00:40] church today and how that we've gone
[1:00:42] through so much battling over the past
[1:00:43] 2,000 years that the church world as it
[1:00:46] came into this age that it found itself
[1:00:48] in this backslid condition but but you
[1:00:50] realize that just as it was in the days
[1:00:52] of Jeremiah is the same way it is today
[1:00:54] it was a people remember they were a
[1:00:56] natural type of us and so here this
[1:00:58] people had gone into this complete
[1:01:00] backslid condition but you notice what
[1:01:02] God done is even before this time came
[1:01:04] with Jeremiah it was still yet it was a
[1:01:06] prophet of God that came to let them
[1:01:08] know that this was coming to pass it was
[1:01:10] a warning do you realize that this is
[1:01:11] what God always does so he sends a
[1:01:13] warning unto them you you can read in
[1:01:15] the Book of Amos the Bible said the word
[1:01:17] of Amos came you how many knows what
[1:01:19] Amos was Amos was a Shepherd he he
[1:01:21] worked out amongst the herds matter of
[1:01:23] fact he made it plain to say that I'm no
[1:01:25] great prophet of God I'm just a Shepherd
[1:01:27] of the sheep I I I just work with the
[1:01:28] herds I I just work out there in the
[1:01:30] fields with him but the Lord came to him
[1:01:32] and gave him a word to speak to his
[1:01:34] children and when Amos came you realize
[1:01:36] Amos was a he was a great prophet of God
[1:01:39] a matter of fact as far as as far as I
[1:01:41] could find he was the he was the first
[1:01:43] prophet in the Old Testament that
[1:01:44] actually went into other countries and
[1:01:46] prophesied to other countries of the
[1:01:48] things that God had said many prophecies
[1:01:50] that that that Amos took to those other
[1:01:52] places and so but but he would talk
[1:01:54] about what God is going to do and how
[1:01:57] and how that God would come into Israel
[1:01:59] and would be able to and would destroy
[1:02:00] them because they had turned their back
[1:02:02] on God and and and Amos would say have
[1:02:05] he said the Lord will Roar from Zion
[1:02:06] this is this is probably 80 or 90 years
[1:02:09] before Jeremiah would begin to prophesy
[1:02:11] Amos is already saying the Lord is going
[1:02:13] to come to Zion he will he he will Roar
[1:02:16] from Zion and he will utter his voice
[1:02:17] from from Jerusalem and the and the
[1:02:19] habitation of the shepherd shall mourn
[1:02:21] and then Amos would say shall a trumpet
[1:02:23] be blown in the city and and the people
[1:02:25] not be afraid shall there be evil done
[1:02:27] in a city and the Lord hath not done it
[1:02:29] so he wants to make plain to the people
[1:02:31] that everything that is going to take
[1:02:33] place in this time of judgment is
[1:02:35] something that God is orchestrating so
[1:02:38] don't think that this is just something
[1:02:39] the Chans have worked up or the or the
[1:02:41] Babylonians have worked up or or that
[1:02:43] some power of their own but any power
[1:02:46] listen friends because I'm using this as
[1:02:47] a foundation but any power that is
[1:02:50] released upon the church is a power that
[1:02:52] God allowed to be released and so if God
[1:02:55] is going to allow it to come he has a
[1:02:57] perfect purpose for his coming brother
[1:02:59] Mark but but but he ain't going to just
[1:03:00] leave it there because notice what what
[1:03:02] what Amos says he says surely the Lord
[1:03:04] God would do nothing but he would first
[1:03:06] reveal his secret to his servants the
[1:03:08] prophets he said for the lon how many
[1:03:10] believe Amos to be a prophet of God Amos
[1:03:12] the prophet of God said God will do
[1:03:14] nothing unless he would reveal it first
[1:03:16] to his servants a prophet so if you want
[1:03:17] to establish your life on something
[1:03:19] establish it on there that if God is
[1:03:21] going to do something it don't matter
[1:03:22] what age it doesn't matter what time if
[1:03:24] God is going to do something he'll first
[1:03:26] reveal it unto his servants the prophets
[1:03:29] says see the lion hath roared who will
[1:03:30] not fear the lord ha spoken who can but
[1:03:33] prophesy watch Amos as he begin to
[1:03:36] prophesy you can imagine you know he was
[1:03:37] a hated Prophet if you ever studied the
[1:03:39] life of of Amos nobody liked Amos
[1:03:41] because Amos you know after all he
[1:03:43] wasn't raised in some great Seminary who
[1:03:45] was he to have a word from the Lord but
[1:03:47] but the things that he said took place
[1:03:49] and when he come out he be to tell them
[1:03:51] you know what Amos done he pointed out
[1:03:53] all the things that they were doing he
[1:03:54] said because you take people into
[1:03:56] captivity and you sell them as slaves
[1:03:57] God's going to destroy you because you
[1:04:00] because you hurt women and because you
[1:04:01] you abuse the the women in your in your
[1:04:03] congregation God's going to destroy you
[1:04:05] because because you you're Idol
[1:04:07] worshippers God's going to destroy you
[1:04:09] because you rob from the poor and you
[1:04:11] give to the rich and you and you try to
[1:04:13] build up off of the poor people God is
[1:04:15] going to destroy you he went to pointing
[1:04:17] out all the things that they were all
[1:04:18] doing you notice when and when he came
[1:04:20] brother Mark here these were supposed to
[1:04:22] been great men of God but they were in a
[1:04:24] backslidden state here and so when when
[1:04:26] Amos comes here he was a prophet of God
[1:04:28] and notice who he was talking to he was
[1:04:30] talking to a bunch of preachers and
[1:04:32] Priests and a government that was over
[1:04:34] Israel Over Judah and and and and they
[1:04:37] had all they had left the word of God
[1:04:39] and so what God does is because the
[1:04:41] preachers had left and the government
[1:04:43] had left and the priests had left then
[1:04:45] God has to send a prophet into that same
[1:04:47] place that he could correct them and
[1:04:49] turn them back to the word of God see
[1:04:51] that in their minds they would say well
[1:04:53] we were doing the word of God but they
[1:04:55] were still wrong the whole priesthood of
[1:04:56] men they were thousands of preachers and
[1:04:58] men and governments and kings and they
[1:05:00] were all professing worshippers of God
[1:05:03] but yet they were wrong they were
[1:05:04] looking to build up Kings for Prosperity
[1:05:06] but he realized what God would tell them
[1:05:08] it wasn't a king that they needed what
[1:05:10] they needed was a prophet of God friends
[1:05:12] that's what people need today they say
[1:05:14] well I'm looking to this for the answer
[1:05:16] and I'm looking to a priest for an
[1:05:17] answer and I'm looking to to uh this
[1:05:19] other for an answer but what we really
[1:05:21] need is we really need a prophet that
[1:05:23] has a word from the Lord that can come
[1:05:25] and tell you the mind of God I don't
[1:05:27] know about you but I'm I'm done
[1:05:29] listening to the minds of men I've heard
[1:05:31] all the opinions of men that I'm going
[1:05:32] to hear but if I'm going to have
[1:05:34] Direction this day I'm going to hear it
[1:05:36] from the word from a word from the Lord
[1:05:38] from a prophet of God that's been
[1:05:40] Vindicated by God this you think about
[1:05:42] when he would come that what they needed
[1:05:44] was a prophet because a prophet comes
[1:05:45] with the word of the Lord and he comes
[1:05:47] to interpret the word of the Lord you
[1:05:49] say well why would God send a prophet
[1:05:52] like Amos think about it every time they
[1:05:53] got in trouble God sent a prophet to
[1:05:55] correct it every time there was judgment
[1:05:57] coming God sent a prophet with a warning
[1:05:59] isn't that something that's that's the
[1:06:01] scripture God always sent somebody that
[1:06:03] had a word from the Lord to lead the
[1:06:05] church back to him out of the condition
[1:06:08] they were in and the confusion you can
[1:06:10] see the the in the prophet would be
[1:06:12] Vindicated you say why would it take a
[1:06:13] Vindication is because there's so many
[1:06:16] people that you could listen to there's
[1:06:18] so many voices there's so many ways we
[1:06:21] could go there's so many different
[1:06:22] things that you could believe but God
[1:06:23] would have to send something that would
[1:06:25] be Vindicated by God in order that would
[1:06:28] Captivate the minds of people and it
[1:06:29] would turn in our hearts and turn the
[1:06:31] people back to God but you notice you
[1:06:33] say why would God have to send a prophet
[1:06:35] let me tell you now this this is me but
[1:06:37] this is the way I feel about it I I
[1:06:38] believe that God is just how many
[1:06:40] believes that I believe he's a righteous
[1:06:42] God and the Bible says that God would
[1:06:43] judge remember what Jesus said he said I
[1:06:46] I I don't come to judge you but my word
[1:06:47] will judge you when I'm gone so it
[1:06:49] wouldn't be my old church it wouldn't be
[1:06:51] if it was a church that God would judge
[1:06:52] Bible which church would it be cuz every
[1:06:54] one of them's different can you imagine
[1:06:56] if God took the Catholic church and he
[1:06:57] judged everybody else by it or if he
[1:06:59] took the Baptist Church and he judged
[1:07:01] everybody else by it well we would all
[1:07:02] be wrong because none of us see anything
[1:07:04] the same way but Jesus didn't say that
[1:07:07] he said but my word will judge you so
[1:07:10] the true judge is not it's not going to
[1:07:12] be a church but the true judge would be
[1:07:14] the word of God now I believe that if
[1:07:16] it's God's word that would judge the
[1:07:17] church but Mark that that I believe that
[1:07:19] God is a just God so in other words if
[1:07:21] you take the word of God you can look at
[1:07:23] the word of God like this that this is
[1:07:25] God 's contract between me and God this
[1:07:28] is what God has written in his word and
[1:07:30] it's a contract between me and God so I
[1:07:32] know if I hold to it then God God is
[1:07:34] bound to be by his own word he he's Duty
[1:07:36] bound to keep his word he ain't going to
[1:07:38] change it on you and and change
[1:07:40] something at the last minute just to
[1:07:42] cause you to miss out but God made a
[1:07:43] contract with the
[1:07:45] church and see when a contract is made
[1:07:48] brother Mark when you would you you'd go
[1:07:50] to a court today and you'd say well
[1:07:51] there's a contract between one and
[1:07:53] another when a contract is made one of
[1:07:54] the first laws of a contract is that the
[1:07:57] contract must be able to be understood
[1:08:00] plainly isn't this something that it
[1:08:01] must be so if I would write a contract
[1:08:04] between me and brother Phil and then and
[1:08:05] then I didn't keep my end of the bargain
[1:08:07] and he would go to court and and and and
[1:08:09] he would say he' say well he didn't keep
[1:08:10] his end of the bargain so therefore he's
[1:08:12] got to pay thus and thus and I would
[1:08:14] look and I say but it but but it looks
[1:08:15] like that I didn't have to do that I
[1:08:16] mean the way the way it's worded I
[1:08:18] didn't know I had to do that and so what
[1:08:20] the judge would do is the judge would
[1:08:22] read that and if the person that wrote
[1:08:24] the contract had written in a way that
[1:08:26] it couldn't be plainly understood by the
[1:08:28] other party then the judge would
[1:08:30] automatically go in favor of the party
[1:08:32] that did not write the contract so the
[1:08:35] one that wrote it is bound by law in
[1:08:38] order for it to be able to be received
[1:08:41] and be received plainly that you could
[1:08:43] be able to live by it I thought my ain't
[1:08:45] that something about God here if God
[1:08:47] would make a contract with a believer
[1:08:49] that God he wouldn't leave it in a
[1:08:51] mystery see God could never the church
[1:08:52] he could never judge the church with a
[1:08:54] mystery being a on the word of God do
[1:08:56] you realize that shows us that that
[1:08:58] before that judgment could ever come to
[1:09:00] the Earth that God would have to take
[1:09:02] the mystery off the book he would have
[1:09:04] to open it up to the church that the
[1:09:06] revelation of the word would come to you
[1:09:07] that You' be able to meet God with that
[1:09:10] Revelation rather than wondering around
[1:09:12] and lost in this mystery or or confusion
[1:09:14] that people get lost up in see so it
[1:09:16] must be understood and so without God
[1:09:18] sending representatives of the word he
[1:09:20] would never judge by it so God would
[1:09:22] send the Holy Ghost to to speak it then
[1:09:25] he would would send a holy ghost to
[1:09:26] interpret it through the mouth of a
[1:09:27] Prophet this is what Amos came to do
[1:09:29] when Amos came you realize he was sin of
[1:09:31] God he had God's word he was anointed by
[1:09:34] God he came at God's appointed time and
[1:09:36] brother Mark he came with thus sayeth
[1:09:38] the Lord and when brother Amos came out
[1:09:40] and he was speaking thus sayeth the Lord
[1:09:41] the whole nation didn't want to accept
[1:09:43] what Amos said but it didn't matter what
[1:09:45] they accepted What mattered was is he
[1:09:47] had a word from God and the word from
[1:09:50] the Lord stands no matter who will
[1:09:52] receive it shall a lion roar who shall
[1:09:56] hear it you see so he came to speak the
[1:09:58] word of the Lord Brother Mark that's all
[1:10:00] he needed he didn't come in the name of
[1:10:02] church he didn't he didn't have to be
[1:10:04] backed by by some great uh uh
[1:10:06] denomination or something in order to be
[1:10:08] able to to speak to God's children he
[1:10:10] came in the name of the Lord and they
[1:10:13] wouldn't receive him just like today can
[1:10:15] you imagine if Amos got turned loose
[1:10:17] today glory to God it'd be in all the
[1:10:19] newspapers this mad man that come in why
[1:10:22] listen but because amos's message was
[1:10:23] not something that was well received can
[1:10:25] you imagine if he come down you know
[1:10:27] what he said he said the god that you
[1:10:28] claim to believe in is going to destroy
[1:10:30] you the god that you're building your
[1:10:33] temples to is going to come and he's
[1:10:35] going to destroy you and the temple that
[1:10:36] you built unto him the very thing the
[1:10:39] the millions of dollars and things that
[1:10:40] you spent God is going to destroy it but
[1:10:43] said that's the same thing that God has
[1:10:45] done can you imagine if he come today
[1:10:47] that the very God that Pentecost
[1:10:49] believes in he'll come and destroy he he
[1:10:51] he'll destroy them because of the
[1:10:52] immoral acts and the things that we
[1:10:54] allow in the pull pits today you think
[1:10:56] about these great churches and things
[1:10:58] that's been built up but the but the
[1:11:00] nonsense that they allow to to lead
[1:11:02] people and the in the things that they
[1:11:04] allow to be called the word of God but
[1:11:06] because of their immoral acts and and
[1:11:08] the direction that they've taken but am
[1:11:10] Mark that the very God that they claim
[1:11:11] to serve is going to destroy them and
[1:11:14] you know what they said well we don't
[1:11:15] have to believe you cuz after all we've
[1:11:17] got our own
[1:11:19] prophets we've got our own law we're
[1:11:22] we're we're we're we're from Abraham's
[1:11:23] lineage and who are you you ain't
[1:11:25] nothing but a shepherd He Didn't Have he
[1:11:27] didn't have the uh the the background in
[1:11:29] order to be able to stand before them
[1:11:31] kind of men and be able to to tell them
[1:11:34] they were dignitaries after all he was
[1:11:36] just an old Prophet an old Shepherd but
[1:11:39] he had a word from the Lord said but
[1:11:41] that's what that's what they did today
[1:11:44] they said the same thing but we don't
[1:11:45] have to receive that we don't have to
[1:11:47] receive it but friends let me tell you
[1:11:49] why you must receive it because it's a
[1:11:50] word from the Lord don't get caught up
[1:11:53] in who said it but it was a word word
[1:11:55] from the Lord so when God sends a word
[1:11:58] and he vindicates the word that he sends
[1:12:00] it's for us to receive said think about
[1:12:02] that God today the very God you're
[1:12:04] building churches to he'll destroy you
[1:12:06] because you're rejecting his word the
[1:12:09] very God that America Claims to serve
[1:12:10] will bring judgment upon the nation and
[1:12:12] destroy it said I hope this gets so deep
[1:12:14] you'll never wiggle out of it that the
[1:12:16] very one you claim to love and with your
[1:12:17] own man-made dogmas and IMM moral life
[1:12:19] and Decay that you got in you away from
[1:12:22] the word of God he will destroy you
[1:12:23] someday that's Theus sayth the Lord my
[1:12:26] isn't that a scary thought to think that
[1:12:28] you would spend your life dedicated to
[1:12:30] something and still receive the Judgment
[1:12:32] of God but let me tell you you won't
[1:12:34] receive it without hearing a word from
[1:12:35] the Lord first because the Bible said
[1:12:37] there's warning before judgment so here
[1:12:39] God would send a prophet you said we
[1:12:41] brother them out what in this kind of
[1:12:43] condition what can we do well let me
[1:12:44] tell you what God offered them an
[1:12:46] opportunity here was 80 years that took
[1:12:48] place from the time of Amos until the
[1:12:50] time of Jeremiah I thought of all the
[1:12:52] time that they had to correct their
[1:12:54] error of all the time to go in if the
[1:12:56] bab if if this enemy is going to come
[1:12:58] down and God's going to use him to tear
[1:13:00] down these these these these uh uh uh
[1:13:02] Groves of bail well why don't we just go
[1:13:04] in and tear down the Groves of bail and
[1:13:06] then God won't need the enemy to come in
[1:13:07] and do it they had all these years to
[1:13:09] correct the things can you imagine I I
[1:13:12] know we think about that well if God was
[1:13:13] sent a prophet after all it's been many
[1:13:15] years I'm sure that's the way they were
[1:13:17] in the days when Jeremiah begin speaking
[1:13:19] it was 80 years ago that Amos came and
[1:13:21] talked about what God was going to do 80
[1:13:24] years later they had done forgotten
[1:13:25] about Amos but then Jeremiah began to
[1:13:28] speak and said but God is going to do
[1:13:30] what God said he would do this is the
[1:13:32] destruction and and what happened in the
[1:13:34] days of Amos it's little compared to
[1:13:36] what God is going to do now so he he he
[1:13:39] began to show what was happening you you
[1:13:41] notice what would what what God would
[1:13:43] begin to speak to to Amos I I love what
[1:13:45] he what he would tell him because it
[1:13:47] looks like an awful side an awful
[1:13:49] condition you said brother Matthew what
[1:13:50] can we do let me tell you what we can do
[1:13:52] we can line up with the word of God we
[1:13:55] can we can preach the gospel to the uh
[1:13:57] to to to everybody that we come in
[1:13:59] contact with we can we can we can send
[1:14:01] this message out Across the Nation and
[1:14:03] tell people the truth of the word of God
[1:14:05] and when people rebuke it let go ahead
[1:14:07] go ahead and tell the next for the truth
[1:14:09] of the word of God let me that that's
[1:14:11] what we can do we can stand and keep in
[1:14:13] line the word of God this is what God
[1:14:15] asked Amos he said Amos what do you see
[1:14:18] Bible said and Amos turned he said and
[1:14:20] what I saw was the Lord holding a plum
[1:14:22] line in his hand beside a great wall you
[1:14:24] know what a Plum line is it was a weight
[1:14:26] on the end of a string and that weight
[1:14:28] it would hold the string straight that's
[1:14:29] how old Builders would build build
[1:14:31] buildings so he said I saw the Lord
[1:14:33] holding a plum line and the wall beside
[1:14:35] it as God begin to speak of of of this
[1:14:38] wall and how that he would never be able
[1:14:40] to go into that group of people again
[1:14:42] but I thank God that there was somebody
[1:14:44] that saw it was the Lord that was
[1:14:45] holding the line and here Amos said if
[1:14:47] somebody or if there be somebody here
[1:14:49] this morning that would hold the line if
[1:14:51] there's somebody that would hold true to
[1:14:53] the line am said I see a plum line it
[1:14:56] was in the hand of the Lord oh friends
[1:14:57] let me tell you what we must do today we
[1:14:59] must line up with the word of God we
[1:15:02] must tell the truth we must preach the
[1:15:04] gospel we must cross the nation with the
[1:15:06] message of the hour let me tell you as
[1:15:08] long as we're lined up with the word of
[1:15:10] God there's still hope for those that
[1:15:12] are lost there's still hope that they
[1:15:13] can return back to God there's still a
[1:15:15] hope that they can be restored there's
[1:15:17] still a hope that they can escape the
[1:15:19] oncoming judgment just line up to the
[1:15:21] word of God and preach the gospel and
[1:15:23] send the message out of Across the
[1:15:25] Nation that's what this country needs it
[1:15:28] needs God called men that will stand
[1:15:30] upon the word of God that are anointed
[1:15:32] by God to preach the message of the hour
[1:15:34] there ain't some message for another age
[1:15:36] this is the message that God has sent in
[1:15:39] 2024 to call the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] out of this world and to get her
[1:15:43] attention Upon Jesus Christ again it's
[1:15:47] God that has called his church he's sent
[1:15:49] a word by the way of the mouth of a
[1:15:51] prophet to call us back to him that we
[1:15:53] would recognize Who We Are and then we
[1:15:55] we could stand with faith and boldness
[1:15:57] and courage and press the battle in the
[1:15:59] midst of RA
[1:16:01] DEA that's what we need is Anointed men
[1:16:04] of God anointed anointed sisters that'll
[1:16:07] stand upon the word of God that'll hold
[1:16:09] a plum line in a standard in this world
[1:16:12] whenever she walks around and everybody
[1:16:14] calls you oldfashioned and some old
[1:16:16] worship granny or something like that
[1:16:18] but don't you worry about what they say
[1:16:19] look like hus look and say but I see a
[1:16:22] plum line in the hand of the Lord and
[1:16:24] let me stand true let when people look
[1:16:26] at my life let them see the plum line of
[1:16:28] God let them when they look at at my
[1:16:31] family let them see the plum line of God
[1:16:34] be the standard that the world is
[1:16:36] looking to in this
[1:16:39] age he saw a plum line see this is what
[1:16:43] we need to bring the church in line with
[1:16:45] the word of God brother Wesley but at
[1:16:47] the same time to edify the church to to
[1:16:51] strengthen the church to build it up you
[1:16:53] realize that the revelation is what
[1:16:55] strengthens the church so here God is
[1:16:58] going to send this to to in order to
[1:17:01] strengthen us and to to build our faith
[1:17:03] that's what we need today we need faith
[1:17:05] building
[1:17:06] messages not just to tear people down
[1:17:08] and make them feel weak and lesser and
[1:17:11] you can't live it anyway we don't need
[1:17:14] that the church don't need that it don't
[1:17:16] need men getting in the pull pit and
[1:17:18] just tearing everybody down and tell
[1:17:19] them why they're all they're all never
[1:17:21] going to make it and ain't none of them
[1:17:23] good enough we don't we don't need that
[1:17:25] it ain't just it ain't to tear you down
[1:17:28] we don't have to stand in the pull pit
[1:17:29] every time we get in the pull pit and
[1:17:30] correct everybody for all their wrongs
[1:17:32] and beat up on everybody can you imagine
[1:17:34] what it'd be like of all the things that
[1:17:35] I know things that's going on and people
[1:17:38] they they try to tell you and try can
[1:17:39] you imagine if you took the time to to
[1:17:42] to to stand and and feed the church if
[1:17:44] you took that time it's free I'm here
[1:17:46] but if you took the time to feed the
[1:17:48] church and instead you took that time
[1:17:50] and just beat up on everybody and told
[1:17:51] told everybody about everybody else's
[1:17:53] problems and all their wrongs and why
[1:17:54] they need need to correct it and all all
[1:17:56] this my but but there ain't no that
[1:17:57] ain't the place for it to constantly
[1:18:00] just just to correct and correct and
[1:18:02] correct listen to me don't shut me down
[1:18:04] but but but we don't have to have
[1:18:05] correction every time we breathe every
[1:18:07] word of God wasn't a word of Correction
[1:18:10] people get caught up in this do this
[1:18:11] don't do that do this don't do that do
[1:18:13] this don't do that and people walk
[1:18:15] around like little robots do this can't
[1:18:16] do that do this can't do that never had
[1:18:18] a relationship with God and then when
[1:18:20] they do this don't do that voice is
[1:18:21] going out of your head then you're stuck
[1:18:23] on your own and you're falling flat on
[1:18:24] your foot cuz there the problem is is
[1:18:26] because something was in your head and
[1:18:28] nothing ever got to your heart but what
[1:18:30] we need is the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:18:32] the very baptism of the Holy Ghost to be
[1:18:34] born in the heart of young men and women
[1:18:36] and they can stand out in the world and
[1:18:38] they wouldn't even have a Bible in their
[1:18:40] hand they'd be able to stand upon God's
[1:18:41] word cuz Jesus Christ would be living in
[1:18:44] them they could burn every book and
[1:18:47] you'll still stand on the truth of God's
[1:18:49] word they could put you in a in a Cell
[1:18:51] somewhere you stand on the truth of
[1:18:53] God's word why because it's living on
[1:18:55] the inside of you that's what we need we
[1:18:58] need to we need we we we need we need
[1:19:00] teaching and vision and direction for
[1:19:02] the church you real you realize if
[1:19:04] there's no teaching and there's no
[1:19:05] vision well you have no
[1:19:07] Direction imagine this is what God God
[1:19:10] God don't just send uh correction to
[1:19:13] point out our flaws but God always sends
[1:19:15] Direction that's right see so he'll
[1:19:17] he'll send correction but he'll also
[1:19:19] send direction is that what the prophet
[1:19:21] said he said the holy spirit always
[1:19:22] points to Christ you know what point
[1:19:24] means is to give a Direction so if you
[1:19:27] to point to Something in other words
[1:19:28] you're giving a direction says it always
[1:19:30] it always points so when God would bring
[1:19:32] correction that correction also comes
[1:19:34] with Direction so he's given a direction
[1:19:37] of the to the church you see so if you
[1:19:40] had no I'll just say it like this if you
[1:19:42] have no no correction well but then you
[1:19:45] would lose your direction so you have to
[1:19:48] have correction in the church don't get
[1:19:49] me wrong but if you had no correction
[1:19:51] you would lose your direction but also
[1:19:54] if you had no Direction you would get
[1:19:57] lost in your correction cuz that's all
[1:19:59] you would ever be able to see the Bible
[1:20:01] says where there is no vision people
[1:20:03] perish so the church must have a
[1:20:05] direction it must have a vision so
[1:20:08] correction comes but it's with the
[1:20:09] direction it's where it's with the
[1:20:11] feeding of God's word and God is leading
[1:20:14] us to a place he says see so God give us
[1:20:16] a Direction so where is our Direction
[1:20:17] it's what John pointed to he said Behold
[1:20:20] the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin
[1:20:22] of the world no wonder the Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] point to Christ that that's what that's
[1:20:26] what John done he recognized him let me
[1:20:28] tell you friends any true Messenger of
[1:20:30] God today will still do the same thing
[1:20:32] he'll point to Jesus Christ you say
[1:20:34] where is our Direction it is Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ and Christ Alone what are we
[1:20:38] following after it's Jesus Christ and
[1:20:40] Christ Alone which is his word the Bible
[1:20:42] said he became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:20:45] that's why God would send a prophet it
[1:20:46] would be to turn people back to the word
[1:20:48] of God it wasn't to turn people to
[1:20:51] follow after Ambush it wasn't to cause
[1:20:53] them to follow after Jeremiah it was the
[1:20:55] cause them to follow after Jesus Christ
[1:20:57] and Christ
[1:20:58] Alone he never did come to point to a
[1:21:01] man he came to point to Christ you say
[1:21:04] why why wouldn't he point to I may as
[1:21:06] well just I may as well just
[1:21:08] preach I'm here anyway but why wouldn't
[1:21:11] he point to a man let me tell you why
[1:21:13] there's what John said remember when he
[1:21:15] saw the Throne of God Revelations 5 he
[1:21:18] said in the hand of him that set up on
[1:21:20] the throne was a book that was sealed
[1:21:21] with Seven Seals but whenever John saw
[1:21:24] it he said and I saw a strong Angel
[1:21:26] Proclaim who is worthy to open the book
[1:21:28] and loose the seals thereof and he said
[1:21:30] and no man in heaven was found worthy
[1:21:33] and no man in earth and no man under the
[1:21:36] Earth see why you don't point to a man
[1:21:38] he said there was never a man that was
[1:21:40] found
[1:21:40] worthy no man under the Earth he said
[1:21:43] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:21:46] worthy to even look there own but then
[1:21:50] one of the elders said weep not Behold
[1:21:52] The Lion and the tribe of Judah the root
[1:21:54] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:21:56] and loose the seals thereof he said and
[1:21:58] I beheld in the midst of the throne the
[1:22:00] four beasts in the midst of the Elder
[1:22:02] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[1:22:05] seven horns and 10 eyes that or having
[1:22:08] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[1:22:10] seven spirits of God that that he sent
[1:22:13] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:22:14] he took the lamb now the lamb took the
[1:22:16] book out of him that set upon the throne
[1:22:18] and when he had taken the book The Four
[1:22:19] beasts the 4 and 20 Elders fell down
[1:22:21] before the lamb see why they're all
[1:22:23] pointing to the lamb lamb they all fell
[1:22:25] down before the lamb they were they were
[1:22:27] pointing to the lamb it was the lamb
[1:22:29] that was worthy and the Bible said and
[1:22:30] they sang a new song saying Thou Art
[1:22:33] Worthy they are worthy to take the book
[1:22:35] and to open the seals you were slain and
[1:22:37] you have redeemed us to God by thy blood
[1:22:40] out of every Kindred and tongue and
[1:22:42] people and Nation it was you that paid
[1:22:44] the price for the book of redemption it
[1:22:46] was you that that that sealed it away it
[1:22:48] was it was you that had it in the hand
[1:22:50] of God that it was sealed until the time
[1:22:52] of its revealing and only you worthy to
[1:22:55] be able to open it to the church today
[1:22:57] that they would have power and dominion
[1:23:00] and Authority in the last
[1:23:03] days but I love how I'm I'm about out of
[1:23:07] time but I love how the Bible would talk
[1:23:10] about or John would see this now you
[1:23:12] notice I'm just going to lay this in
[1:23:14] here because this is where our study's
[1:23:16] been you notice that John said I saw
[1:23:18] four beasts around the throne now don't
[1:23:20] don't get them confused with the four
[1:23:22] beasts that we were talking about in
[1:23:23] Daniel 7 and and how that that remember
[1:23:25] those four beasts and they became one
[1:23:27] great Beast they were also the the the
[1:23:29] horse riders in the in Revelations the
[1:23:31] sixth chapter in the seals the first
[1:23:32] four seals each one LED with a horse
[1:23:34] rider and then also the the the king uh
[1:23:38] or Nebuchadnezzar's dream that Daniel
[1:23:39] saw it was the same those beasts were
[1:23:41] powers or nations that would rise up
[1:23:44] same thing Daniel saw or or interpreted
[1:23:46] is the same thing uh that that that that
[1:23:49] was in Revelations that we were talking
[1:23:50] about last Sunday so so but this wasn't
[1:23:52] the same four Beast he said these four
[1:23:53] beasts were actually the powers or the
[1:23:56] anointing of God you can read that in
[1:23:57] Revelations 4:7 the Bible said and the
[1:23:59] first Beast was like a lion the second a
[1:24:01] calf the third a face of a man the
[1:24:03] fourth was like a flying eagle so these
[1:24:05] four beasts were actually those that
[1:24:06] were Protectors of the gospel and so
[1:24:09] here that God had and I don't have time
[1:24:11] to get I was going to get a little more
[1:24:13] into it but I don't have time this
[1:24:14] morning but but here it was the same
[1:24:16] things that that that Moses would put on
[1:24:18] the Ark of the Covenant remember when he
[1:24:19] would take the ark out and here on each
[1:24:21] Corner that these would be established
[1:24:23] here this same thing was sitting Before
[1:24:24] the Throne of God these four beasts and
[1:24:26] so we see that this in uh at the opening
[1:24:29] of the seals what the opening of the
[1:24:31] seals it actually showed us not not not
[1:24:33] only did it show us where we were but it
[1:24:35] showed us the past the present and the
[1:24:37] future of the church so it's not so
[1:24:39] everything that happened wasn't
[1:24:40] something that has already taken place
[1:24:42] it was something that that that that the
[1:24:44] that the angel of the Lord would reveal
[1:24:46] showing that this is what is going to
[1:24:48] happen and so we see this some of it
[1:24:51] being future future tense but so we see
[1:24:53] what the Bible would tell us that that
[1:24:55] these four beasts that that were around
[1:24:57] the Throne of God they were they were
[1:24:58] the protectors now the last two Services
[1:25:01] we were talking about the four Beast
[1:25:02] that was that was in the vision the four
[1:25:04] Beast that uh that that came in on red
[1:25:07] horses these four powers they were
[1:25:08] represented as powers that came in on
[1:25:10] horse riders excuse me uh in the in the
[1:25:12] opening of the seal so but we see that
[1:25:14] that the Bible would tell us this here's
[1:25:16] a very powerful portion of scripture the
[1:25:18] Bible says that when the enemy comes in
[1:25:20] like a flood that the spirit of God
[1:25:22] would raise up a standard against it so
[1:25:24] here in the seals that we begin to watch
[1:25:27] how that through these ages that there
[1:25:28] would come there would come four
[1:25:30] different horse riders and they would
[1:25:31] bring a power over the people of God
[1:25:34] they would bring in a Dominion or an
[1:25:35] authority so we see this is an enemy
[1:25:37] that would come upon the Church of God
[1:25:39] but the Bible says but every time God
[1:25:41] would raise up a standard so so this is
[1:25:43] so powerful because you'll notice that
[1:25:45] the horse rider represented a power of
[1:25:48] the enemy but each time that God had had
[1:25:51] his own power to combat it can you can
[1:25:53] you pull up revelations in the the 6th
[1:25:55] chapter in the first verse I want I want
[1:25:57] you to just read the wording of this cuz
[1:25:58] I love how it's worded Revelations 6
[1:26:01] And1 I didn't have in my notes but it
[1:26:03] says and I saw when the um okay one of
[1:26:07] the four beasts I saw in the when the
[1:26:09] lamb opened one of the seals I heard as
[1:26:11] it were the noise of thunder and one of
[1:26:13] the four beasts saying come and see now
[1:26:16] notice I'm not going to read each one
[1:26:17] but each time that one of these horse
[1:26:19] riders came or this Beast of power that
[1:26:22] was that was anointed by Satan to come
[1:26:24] to destroy God's children that each time
[1:26:27] there was a beast that would rise up one
[1:26:29] of the four beasts now these were the
[1:26:31] beasts that were Before the Throne of
[1:26:32] God and notice what they were doing is
[1:26:35] they were calling attention to or
[1:26:37] exposing the devil cuz notice what they
[1:26:39] say one of the four Beast said come and
[1:26:41] see so each time here come a horse rider
[1:26:44] that was a beast of power that was the
[1:26:46] Antichrist remember the white horse
[1:26:47] rider he come he was Antichrist but then
[1:26:49] God would raise up this Beast would rise
[1:26:51] up and he'd say well come and see in
[1:26:53] other words he would show
[1:26:54] it was the it was the revealing of what
[1:26:56] was happening so in the in the opening
[1:26:58] of the seals but show it like this he
[1:27:00] said see the devil changed the four
[1:27:01] Beast meant the power that that they was
[1:27:03] revealed or the power that he revealed
[1:27:06] to the world but they and and he sent
[1:27:08] one after the next after the next he
[1:27:10] sent four powers and they ended up on a
[1:27:12] Pale Horse which brought death to the
[1:27:14] church remember it was total separation
[1:27:16] said but when the enemy went out as an
[1:27:18] antichrist then God would send a certain
[1:27:20] type of power out to meet him so the
[1:27:22] first one when the Antichrist went out
[1:27:24] he was riding it was a false teaching
[1:27:26] said so what God sent out was he sent
[1:27:28] out the line of the tribe of Judah Judah
[1:27:30] can you leave Revelations 47 up just for
[1:27:33] a few moments but he said see the first
[1:27:35] thing God sent out he sent out the lion
[1:27:37] of the tribe of Judah which was the word
[1:27:39] made manifest by the Holy Ghost and so
[1:27:41] see so here see so here Satan would come
[1:27:43] out it was an antichrist Spirit but then
[1:27:45] God would send out the line of the tribe
[1:27:47] of Judah he said it's a word made
[1:27:48] manifest by the Holy Spirit it was to
[1:27:50] manifest the true word cuzz the
[1:27:52] Antichrist was to bring a false word but
[1:27:54] then this the line of the TR the lion
[1:27:56] would come and the lion would Roar and
[1:27:58] it would bring a true word see that's
[1:28:00] why in the early church they that they
[1:28:02] were Anointed with the Holy Spirit in
[1:28:03] such a way they had great healings and
[1:28:05] miracles and visions and and power is
[1:28:07] because it was a Living Word it was the
[1:28:10] form of the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:28:12] riding out to combat that Antichrist
[1:28:15] spirit so here Satan would send in this
[1:28:17] white Hors Rider into the church and now
[1:28:20] in in a spiritual sense he would send it
[1:28:22] in to to to destroy the church but God
[1:28:24] would raise up this great power of the
[1:28:26] line of the tribe of Judah and he would
[1:28:28] come in and they would have the power of
[1:28:30] the Holy Ghost to be able to to expose
[1:28:32] the devil and to put him back in his
[1:28:34] place so see so each time he done that
[1:28:37] the red horse it would take peace from
[1:28:39] the Earth but what God did is he raised
[1:28:40] up the ox it says a calf which was an ox
[1:28:43] which was a beast of burden or a beast
[1:28:44] of sacrifice and the prophet of God goes
[1:28:46] through all this showing how that this
[1:28:48] were those it was a the ox was a
[1:28:50] sacrifice showing that this was a time
[1:28:52] when men would give their life in order
[1:28:55] to stand you realize that this is
[1:28:56] whenever Roman Catholicism begin to grow
[1:28:59] into this great uh uh uh place and and
[1:29:02] the Dark Ages would come upon the church
[1:29:03] for all these years but here was a
[1:29:05] people that when they were outside of
[1:29:07] the church and wouldn't accept
[1:29:08] Catholicism then they would be destroyed
[1:29:10] they' take their life say so this was a
[1:29:12] time when the Catholicism control the
[1:29:14] world but but these men didn't mind
[1:29:16] dying if it was death they didn't care
[1:29:18] they went out and died because it was
[1:29:20] the spirit of the age that they lived in
[1:29:22] that that was the reason the men irus
[1:29:24] and polycarp and John and Paul those
[1:29:27] great men went out combating that thing
[1:29:29] willing to give their own lives for it
[1:29:31] because that was the anointing that they
[1:29:33] were under so it was it was what God
[1:29:35] sent so they give their lives freely
[1:29:37] because they come under the anointing of
[1:29:39] a sacrificial anointing which was the ox
[1:29:41] so they they come under they were
[1:29:43] willing to sacrifice their life you
[1:29:44] realize when polycarp went out and they
[1:29:47] were polycarp was a wellknown man and in
[1:29:49] a in a in a in an intelligent man but
[1:29:51] when they took him because he wouldn't
[1:29:52] accept Roman Catholicism ISM and they
[1:29:54] and they took him to to crucify him and
[1:29:56] told him quit this heresies and things
[1:29:58] that you're doing and if you'll just
[1:29:59] quit then we'll we'll accept you back
[1:30:02] but but the Lord spoke to him and and
[1:30:04] and and through the history of polycarp
[1:30:06] you'll hear it the Lord's or they write
[1:30:07] about how that God spoke to him and told
[1:30:10] him don't you worry about what they're
[1:30:11] going to do with you cuz I'm going to be
[1:30:12] with you the whole time and so he went
[1:30:14] out and he accepted what God Said and
[1:30:17] when they went out and they actually
[1:30:18] took a a bath house and they tore the
[1:30:20] bath house down just to get wood to pile
[1:30:22] it up on that man and burn him because
[1:30:24] it was because the Lions had already
[1:30:25] ateen the Lions weren't hungry so they
[1:30:28] burn him instead of feeding him to the
[1:30:30] Lions but he willingly but him Mark made
[1:30:32] a sacrifice you say why would they do it
[1:30:34] make a sacrifice like that said well how
[1:30:36] could they do anything else besides that
[1:30:38] because that was the power of God that
[1:30:41] was released upon them they were under
[1:30:43] the anointing or the age of the ox so
[1:30:46] because of that power of God that was
[1:30:48] released upon them they couldn't do
[1:30:50] nothing else but be a sacrifice they
[1:30:52] would they would willingly lay down
[1:30:54] their life for it because that was the
[1:30:55] anointing that was sent upon them in
[1:30:57] that age now you notice it just keeps
[1:30:59] going the and the third horse rider came
[1:31:01] up on a black horse and the that that it
[1:31:03] would Rob the people of their houses and
[1:31:05] lands you saw this coming through the
[1:31:06] ages where the Catholic Church would
[1:31:08] would make it where you could pay to go
[1:31:09] to heaven and you you as long as you
[1:31:11] paid enough money you can get anybody in
[1:31:13] it didn't matter what they did if you
[1:31:14] got enough houses to donate or something
[1:31:16] to to be able to pay the church but
[1:31:18] notice what God would send in that time
[1:31:20] he sent men remember it was the face of
[1:31:22] a man so what was it it was those those
[1:31:24] reformers that came in that time to say
[1:31:26] that ain't nothing but a lie of the
[1:31:27] devil see every time the enemy would
[1:31:29] raise up over the church God would raise
[1:31:31] up a standard against it so here these
[1:31:33] great reformers that come and say you
[1:31:35] don't have to pay a man the price has
[1:31:37] already been paid you don't have to pay
[1:31:39] Redemption redemption's already been
[1:31:41] paid it was paid for on the cross of
[1:31:43] Calvary said so these great reformers
[1:31:45] came up under that power that was
[1:31:48] released upon them in that age and they
[1:31:50] that they would set the word of God
[1:31:52] straight and they would they would keep
[1:31:53] the they would keep the gospel brother
[1:31:55] Mar but then it would come into this
[1:31:56] last power that with this great
[1:31:58] Antichrist spirit that would come in the
[1:32:01] last age remember it would deceive all
[1:32:03] and it would be on this pill horse and
[1:32:05] he would he he would he would he would
[1:32:07] destroy and take them into total total
[1:32:09] Annihilation it would be this time of
[1:32:10] judgment but the last Beast that came
[1:32:12] would be under the anointing of an eagle
[1:32:15] say so that's why when you hear this
[1:32:17] term that we're living in an eagle age
[1:32:19] that's what it's referring to is that
[1:32:21] here we're living under this fourth
[1:32:22] living Beast it was an eagle this was
[1:32:24] the last Beast that God sent to combat
[1:32:27] what Satan would do he said see he sent
[1:32:29] every time Satan would send forth one
[1:32:30] God would sent forth one then the
[1:32:32] Antichrist uh then the Antichrist would
[1:32:34] come and it would continue all the way
[1:32:37] through all the way until we come to the
[1:32:38] age that we're living in now but after
[1:32:40] the Pale Horse you'll notice that there
[1:32:42] was no horses after that there was no
[1:32:45] Beast after that see because it was
[1:32:48] destroyed and brother Mark see he said
[1:32:50] see when would that happen is it would
[1:32:52] happen at the end of the church Church
[1:32:54] ages and then there would be no horse
[1:32:56] rider anymore because he was bound there
[1:32:58] would be no power that was released
[1:33:00] anymore he was bound that's why in the
[1:33:02] fifth seal if you ever go when you go
[1:33:03] into the fifth seal you'll see what
[1:33:05] starts coming during the tribulation and
[1:33:07] and the time that Souls Under The Altar
[1:33:09] and all but but they said see because
[1:33:11] God God has every time that Satan has
[1:33:13] come God has raised up a power to combat
[1:33:16] the power of the enemy in every age all
[1:33:19] the way through to where we are it's no
[1:33:21] wonder glory to God I know I'm too late
[1:33:23] but it's no wonder that they started
[1:33:25] singing a new song it's no wonder that
[1:33:29] whenever he these four beasts that had
[1:33:30] fought and they stood to withstand the
[1:33:33] enemy when the enemy would come but John
[1:33:35] said but I saw up there that the lamb
[1:33:37] would come in the end time and he would
[1:33:38] take the book and he would loose the
[1:33:40] seals thereof in other words he would
[1:33:42] bind Satan and he would have no power
[1:33:44] over the church any any longer let me
[1:33:46] tell you what it was friends the opening
[1:33:48] of the seals it revealed every Power
[1:33:50] that Satan sent and it was destroyed by
[1:33:52] a power that God sent to the church
[1:33:54] that's why we as Eagle Believers in this
[1:33:57] hour brother Mark we're living under an
[1:33:58] eagle anointing we're living under an H
[1:34:01] where Satan has no power over the church
[1:34:03] we're not bound in the Dominion of Satan
[1:34:05] but we've been released by the power of
[1:34:07] God he said you've made us Kings and
[1:34:09] Priests and I beheld and I heard the
[1:34:11] voice of many angels around the throne
[1:34:13] the beasts and the elders that were 10
[1:34:15] thousands time 10 thousands and
[1:34:17] thousands of thousands they were saying
[1:34:18] with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb
[1:34:20] that was slain to receive power riches
[1:34:23] and wisdom and strength and honor and
[1:34:25] glory and blessing they went into a
[1:34:29] jubilee a Revival what caused it brother
[1:34:32] Mark because they recognized that the
[1:34:34] lamb had
[1:34:35] prevailed you see what brings such a a
[1:34:38] Revival in the church what is this
[1:34:40] bride's Revival about anyway it's
[1:34:42] because we recognize that the lamb has
[1:34:45] prevailed and every trick that Satan
[1:34:47] tried to do that could have captured
[1:34:49] your ancestors could have led them to
[1:34:51] another ancestor that got them wrapped
[1:34:53] up in all this this denominational junk
[1:34:55] that's going on in this world today got
[1:34:57] them all wrapped up in all these all
[1:34:58] these man-made religions but AR but but
[1:35:01] but something came in the last
[1:35:03] day this Eagle anointing has came and
[1:35:06] you've recognized what it was and it
[1:35:08] called you out of it that you can see
[1:35:10] the word of God and say I I thank God
[1:35:12] that the lamb has prevailed to open the
[1:35:15] book see people get this so mixed up he
[1:35:18] never was pointing to a man anyway it
[1:35:19] was the lamb the four Beast they bowed
[1:35:22] down to the lamb the 4 and20 Elders they
[1:35:24] bowed down to the lamb there was 10,000s
[1:35:27] times thousands times thousands that
[1:35:29] were glorifying him and giving Glory
[1:35:31] unto him let me tell you what it is it's
[1:35:32] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God has opened
[1:35:36] the book and released the power of God
[1:35:38] upon the church today that Satan has no
[1:35:40] power over you I feel the presence of
[1:35:42] the Lord right now let me tell you Satan
[1:35:43] has no dominion over the believer Jesus
[1:35:46] said if you I am the vine and you are
[1:35:48] the branches he that abideth in me will
[1:35:51] bring forth much fruit and without me
[1:35:53] you can do nothing nothing but if you
[1:35:54] abide in me and my word abides in you
[1:35:56] you can ask what you will and it shall
[1:35:58] be done unto you for herein is the
[1:36:00] father glorified that you bring forth
[1:36:02] much fruit God don't want you to be beat
[1:36:04] down he don't want you to be washed over
[1:36:07] and stomped down he wants you to be
[1:36:08] fruitful he don't want you to be Barren
[1:36:11] he wants you to be an overcomer he don't
[1:36:12] want you to be bound he wants you to be
[1:36:15] free I wonder how many to say that today
[1:36:18] I want my life to glorify God Lord let
[1:36:21] my life manifest him let my let my life
[1:36:23] glorify him let my actions glorify God
[1:36:26] let my mouth glorify him let me be as
[1:36:28] Paul said he said with one mind and one
[1:36:30] mouth let us glorify God who was it that
[1:36:34] John saw 10 thousands times 10 thousands
[1:36:37] and thousands and thousands that were
[1:36:39] glorifying him let me tell you who he
[1:36:41] saw he saw Matt MOS down there they said
[1:36:43] well he can't preach without dancing he
[1:36:45] can't sing without dancing why there
[1:36:47] something happened in my heart my eye
[1:36:49] come open to who I am and when I saw my
[1:36:51] name that was written it called me to
[1:36:54] rejoice and to glorify God let
[1:36:56] everything that has with one mind and
[1:36:58] one mouth glorify God won't you stand to
[1:37:02] your feet this morning won't we glorify
[1:37:04] him give praise and glory unto him how
[1:37:08] many knows what glorify means it means
[1:37:11] to render or to esteem something as
[1:37:15] glorious it don't mean make a loud noise
[1:37:18] it means to esteem something as glorious
[1:37:21] see sometimes when you esteem something
[1:37:23] as is glorious your life will glorify
[1:37:26] him sometimes your voice will glorify
[1:37:28] him Paul said let every voice you'll
[1:37:31] glorify him because you esteem him as
[1:37:34] glorious when this word used properly it
[1:37:37] means to ascribe weight by recognizing
[1:37:39] the real substance or the value of
[1:37:42] something so you say I want to glorify
[1:37:45] God it's to recognize the value of God
[1:37:49] it's how you can glorify him say he's
[1:37:52] there's nothing more PR
[1:37:54] precious it's
[1:37:56] valuable it takes preeminence over all
[1:37:58] my feelings and over all my work and job
[1:38:03] and all this brother Ben it takes
[1:38:05] preeminence because you recognize the
[1:38:07] value of it that's what causes us to be
[1:38:10] stable that's why you come to church
[1:38:12] you're not sitting there wondering well
[1:38:14] I may I'm I don't know if I'm going to
[1:38:15] go church tomorrow matter of fact I'm
[1:38:17] going to go off somewhere else I'm just
[1:38:18] going I'm just we're not doing that
[1:38:20] because we're
[1:38:21] stable because we esteem him
[1:38:24] valuable the
[1:38:26] value that that that God is to us to
[1:38:30] give Glory means to personally
[1:38:32] acknowledge God in his true character or
[1:38:35] his
[1:38:36] Essence to acknowledge
[1:38:38] Him let me tell you Paul said with one
[1:38:42] mind and one mouth glorify
[1:38:45] him I'm going to tell you something this
[1:38:47] morning I know I've been
[1:38:50] long but you realize that glorifying God
[1:38:54] is not to make God
[1:38:56] greater it's not to we glorify God so
[1:38:59] that God can feel good about himself it
[1:39:01] ain't to make him greater you can give
[1:39:03] God all the glory you can all the praise
[1:39:05] it doesn't make God a greater God it's
[1:39:08] not to make him more excellent It's not
[1:39:11] to give him more power but when you
[1:39:13] glorify God see it's not for God's
[1:39:15] benefit brother Mark it's for
[1:39:17] yours see people get that so mixed up
[1:39:20] well God wants us to worship him God
[1:39:21] wants but but we don't glorify God
[1:39:23] for God's benefit we glorify God for our
[1:39:27] benefit see cuz when you esteem him as
[1:39:30] valuable you esteem him as greater you
[1:39:33] you you allow the the spirit of God or
[1:39:35] the the anointing that God has sent in
[1:39:37] this age to rule over your life but I'm
[1:39:40] Mark and then it doesn't matter what
[1:39:41] Satan would do in this he'd come up this
[1:39:43] great power that's in this age you
[1:39:44] realize friends you're facing a great
[1:39:46] power so kind of you're facing a great
[1:39:47] power a great enemy that would come to
[1:39:50] destroy you here destroy your family he
[1:39:53] he'd wreck everything about you destroy
[1:39:55] your your confidence in in even going to
[1:39:57] church destroy your confidence in the
[1:39:59] ministers in one another this is what
[1:40:01] Satan comes to do but because you value
[1:40:04] God because you glorify God and you
[1:40:06] esteem him to be greater you're living
[1:40:08] under the anointing that God has sent in
[1:40:10] this age which is an eagle anointing and
[1:40:13] because you're willing to say Lord I I
[1:40:14] pray that you would allow that anointing
[1:40:16] to to have control over my life let let
[1:40:19] it rule my life don't let me don't let
[1:40:21] me get out from under that anointing but
[1:40:23] Lord let me let it rule over me let that
[1:40:25] that way I can rise up in the AIDS that
[1:40:26] I'm living in over the power of the
[1:40:29] enemy knowing that it would not bring
[1:40:31] nothing but death and see because you're
[1:40:34] living under that benefit brother Mark
[1:40:36] it'll grow you it'll help you it'll
[1:40:38] cause you to give life it'll cause you
[1:40:41] to praise God it cause you to come to
[1:40:43] church and lift your hands why because
[1:40:45] you value
[1:40:46] God let me tell you something when
[1:40:49] there's a life in there it has to let
[1:40:51] out
[1:40:53] you can take a seed you pour a concrete
[1:40:55] slab over it anybody knows what happens
[1:40:58] you get some grass you pour concrete
[1:40:59] over the grass say well it'll be fine
[1:41:01] you leave a little crack in that
[1:41:02] concrete and watch what'll happen the
[1:41:04] little sun comes down it warms up the
[1:41:06] concrete and that little seed down in
[1:41:08] there underneath that concrete it starts
[1:41:10] feeling the warmth of that sun and it
[1:41:12] goes to searching for a little breath of
[1:41:15] oxygen somewhere and that crazy root
[1:41:18] will go all the way across the concrete
[1:41:19] slab and find the only crack in the slab
[1:41:21] and it'll grow out of it he said well
[1:41:23] who planted that in there nobody planted
[1:41:25] there it was under the slab and that's
[1:41:27] what Satan's done today is he's coming
[1:41:28] he poured concrete on the people of God
[1:41:32] concrete on you to suppress you and
[1:41:34] concrete on you that you can't grow and
[1:41:36] concrete on you that you can't that you
[1:41:37] can't lift your hands and you you can't
[1:41:39] be free in the spirit of God and you
[1:41:41] can't recognize who you are he just
[1:41:43] wants you buried up in Old dark cold
[1:41:45] place under a bunch of concrete I don't
[1:41:47] know what the concrete is to you but I
[1:41:49] know that's what Satan's done he would
[1:41:51] pour it on you but brother said when
[1:41:53] there's a little bit of life that life
[1:41:55] when the sun comes upon the life then
[1:41:56] the life is going to it's going to shine
[1:41:59] forth so it doesn't matter how you can
[1:42:01] take a city block but Mark a concrete
[1:42:03] and eventually it's going to come forth
[1:42:05] you know why because you can't hide
[1:42:08] life you can't bury it there's life
[1:42:11] there when you're born again you can't
[1:42:13] hide it so there's something in you
[1:42:15] that's going to cry out because there's
[1:42:18] life you can't be quiet cuz there's life
[1:42:22] you can't keep your hands down cuz
[1:42:23] they're life that old Spirit of
[1:42:25] Oppression will come into the church say
[1:42:27] well I'll tell you what we're just we're
[1:42:28] just not going to let the spirit of God
[1:42:29] loose in here this morning we're we're
[1:42:31] just going to hold everybody back but he
[1:42:32] can't do it because there's life and all
[1:42:34] it takes is one little Britney back
[1:42:36] there at the end of a song service for
[1:42:38] the Lord to begin to speak their heart
[1:42:39] and say Lord that ain't nothing but the
[1:42:41] truth and I love you I thank you for
[1:42:43] coming this morning I thank you for your
[1:42:45] anointing and then another person will
[1:42:46] catch on and before long that anointing
[1:42:48] is all over the building why because
[1:42:50] there's
[1:42:51] life and God is calling the life life
[1:42:53] out of the cold and the the darkness
[1:42:56] that brother Mark we would be able to
[1:42:57] stand and glorify him we give Glory let
[1:43:01] me tell you what David said he said give
[1:43:03] unto the Lord the glory and strength
[1:43:06] give unto the Lord the glory that is due
[1:43:09] his name give him the give him the glory
[1:43:13] give him the strength give God brother
[1:43:16] Mark give God what you have and let God
[1:43:19] do something with it you may not have a
[1:43:22] lot but but if you'll give what little
[1:43:24] you have to the Lord and let God do
[1:43:25] something with it it'll accomplish great
[1:43:27] things you remember the woman that gave
[1:43:29] two pennies in the offering that that
[1:43:30] time that Jesus saw it and they and
[1:43:33] Jesus said you know that woman gave more
[1:43:35] than any of these men the disciples
[1:43:37] looked at him and said what do you mean
[1:43:38] Lord she she gave two pennies she's a
[1:43:40] poor woman he said she gave everything
[1:43:42] she had he said see they gave they gave
[1:43:45] out of their wealth she gave out of her
[1:43:48] poverty they gave when they had plenty
[1:43:50] to give but she gave when she had
[1:43:52] nothing to give
[1:43:53] do you realize what that that when we
[1:43:56] when we give something to God that
[1:43:58] brother Mark that God can do more with
[1:43:59] it than we can ever do with it you say
[1:44:01] well I don't have much to give well
[1:44:03] neither did David he went down to a
[1:44:04] battle had a slingshot but God used it
[1:44:08] neither did Moses he went down to God
[1:44:10] called him to deliver Egypt he said I
[1:44:12] don't have nothing I can't even speak I
[1:44:13] I don't know what I would do he said
[1:44:14] what do you have in your hand Moses I
[1:44:16] got a staff throw it on the ground God
[1:44:18] used it he took a widow woman that
[1:44:20] didn't have nothing and sustained the
[1:44:22] life of a prophet their whole family
[1:44:23] they had a meal Barrel that had no food
[1:44:25] in it take what little you have and give
[1:44:27] it to God and let God do something great
[1:44:30] with it you may not feel worthy but let
[1:44:33] me tell you God don't God God don't God
[1:44:36] don't take those that are qualified and
[1:44:38] call them to use them God takes those
[1:44:40] that he's called and he qualifies them
[1:44:42] to be used that's what God does you may
[1:44:44] not you may not have much to offer you
[1:44:46] be say Lord I want to give it to you

[1:44:59] there's still a little bit left in there
[1:45:00] you say Lord I lift my hand I I may be
[1:45:02] like that little widow woman I'm poor in
[1:45:04] spirit but I got a couple of pennies
