[29:00] forget.
[29:02] Yet every stain is somehow meant

[29:09] [music] So [singing] undeserveing
[29:12] of this prize,
[29:14] this gift [music and singing]

[40:29] &gt;&gt; Has he forsaken us? Has he left us alone
[40:32] here?"
[40:35] I'm

[40:36] said, "He's

[50:31] you this morning if you'll look with me
[50:33] in in Romans chapter 12. Amen.
[50:38] I'll try not to hold you too long
[50:39] because they tell me it's a big dinner
[50:41] afterwards.
[50:46] As far as skinny as him,
[50:49] I'd never leave a big table.
[50:53] Amen. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[50:57] I want you to look at with me if you
[50:58] would in chapter 12 and uh
[51:04] verse one. I beseech you, brethren,
[51:08] by the mercies of God, that you present
[51:12] your bodies living sacrifice, holy,
[51:16] acceptable unto God, which is your
[51:18] reasonable service.
[51:20] He says, "Be not conformed to this
[51:22] world, but be you transformed by the
[51:25] renewing of your mind
[51:28] that you may prove what is good and
[51:32] acceptable
[51:33] and perfect will of God."
[51:36] Heavenly Father, I want to thank you
[51:38] this morning for allowing us to be here.
[51:41] Ask you to bless the church at home this
[51:42] morning. God, I pray that you'd be with
[51:44] Brother Kanan, Lord, as as he endeavors
[51:46] to speak there, Father. I pray you'll be
[51:49] with them. But Lord, this morning I just
[51:51] look I ask you to be with us this
[51:53] morning, God. Help us, Father, that
[51:55] you'll just bless the service and bless
[51:57] brother Matt and bless the services
[51:59] here, Father. Lord, just Lord, the fruit
[52:02] of it has been wonderful, Father. Ask
[52:04] you Lord that you'll just be merciful in
[52:06] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated this
[52:09] morning. Amen. I want to take a little
[52:11] while. He says, "Now I want you to be
[52:13] transformed
[52:15] by the by the renewing of your mind."
[52:19] Now, I want to talk to you this morning
[52:21] maybe a little transform in life.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I begin to think of this this
[52:26] morning. Amen. And last night. And and I
[52:29] thought, you know, you know, and I'd
[52:31] like to take that thought, the life
[52:34] that's within itself.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; The life that's within itself. Because
[52:40] the thing about it is, you know, you're
[52:42] not nothing is going to come forth
[52:44] unless there's something in it.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I so I began to
[52:50] look at that last night and I thought,
[52:52] you know, Amen. According to the prophet
[52:54] of God, you know, he says, "Now, you
[52:56] know, when brother man began to deal
[52:59] with the seed life, Amen. And he and he
[53:02] began to tell us about how that the seed
[53:05] amen was put there. But the seed would
[53:07] be just as useless as useless could be
[53:09] if it had not life within itself.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; See the thing about it is when the life
[53:14] was in itself, amen. So I don't care
[53:16] what you plant, it's not manifested at
[53:19] that time. Amen. So but the thing about
[53:21] it is is when that life that's in it, it
[53:25] produces itself unto Amen. It brings
[53:28] identification of itself. Didn't you say
[53:31] amen? It's not identifying something
[53:33] else. And that's the reason, Amen. A lot
[53:35] of time we're coming to an
[53:37] identification of the seed. Amen. That
[53:40] life was in itself.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the thing about it is,
[53:45] Amen. It's not something that just
[53:46] happened. It's something that's actually
[53:49] in there that transformed that it
[53:52] actually, Amen. begins to see what it
[53:55] really was.
[53:57] Now, I don't care how how good you put
[54:00] it.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can put it in good ground.
[54:03] Amen. As the Bible says, but the thing
[54:05] about it is if there's not life within
[54:07] itself.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that life in it didn't just
[54:11] come when you put it in the ground.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The life had to come from some
[54:17] Amen. some source.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it could identify itself.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how good you can
[54:24] sing. I don't care how good you can
[54:26] preach. Amen. You've got to have a life
[54:29] to identify. Amen. Where you come from
[54:33] or who you are.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, you know, as the
[54:40] prophet of God says, Amen. He says that
[54:42] when he puts a seed in the earth, this
[54:46] the seed can only come with the life
[54:49] that's within it.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we used to when we
[54:55] planted a garden or so forth back back
[54:58] in the day and and so when you put the
[55:02] uh your seed there back in the day, you
[55:05] would put the package at the end of the
[55:07] row to let you know
[55:10] &gt;&gt; what you put in there.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll let you know what you put
[55:15] in there.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because after a while, it all the
[55:19] ground just looked like Amen. It was
[55:22] Amen. been fixed to grow something.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So after a while, Amen. What
[55:31] happens was Amen. something of that life
[55:35] begins to bust through the earth.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It begin to bust through the
[55:41] earth, but it's strictly not yet
[55:44] identified.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It's really not yet identified.
[55:52] Amen. To be who it's supposed to be.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And so therefore, Amen. You know, it's
[56:01] like brother Pam says, Amen. He says,
[56:04] now he puts it there with a power.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; See, Amen. There's a power within
[56:10] himself to break forth. Amen. Every
[56:14] obstacle, Amen. that he has to get
[56:16] through to get to identification.
[56:21] Are you with me?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Amen." So somebody
[56:26] says, "Oh, I'd like to be this." Amen.
[56:29] You're going to you're you're not going
[56:30] to ever be anything that what you
[56:33] already are.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care if them monkeys think that
[56:39] there this guy's going to be a woman or
[56:41] this woman's going to be a man.
[56:43] the identification of the power of life
[56:47] that it's a boy.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:54] So he says now he puts that there
[56:59] I don't never have to worry about being
[57:01] bride.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Why? The power of life.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of this bride is there.
[57:10] Hallelujah.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; It comes to a station or a time that it
[57:14] could identify who it is.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Am I by myself?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Well, is it the truth?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; So, after a while, Amen. We call
[57:28] ourselves message believers.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; We call ourselves bride.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; But after a while,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we plant radishes.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; All right. We got a radish package
[57:45] &gt;&gt; at the end of the row. But you don't
[57:46] know if they gonna come up or not.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Now, every seed in this package is not
[57:53] necessarily got life.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Y'all Hey,
[58:01] &gt;&gt; I can go home. He already got paid.
[58:07] Every seed in here may not have life.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; If you ever planted a garden, you know
[58:13] that.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? But you still
[58:19] plant it with potentials.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Because you don't know who he is and
[58:25] who's not.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; But God says,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; I put it there with potentials.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring what it is.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not something to be transformed to
[58:40] something else.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; But I want something of myself.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's the reason brother Bon said Jesus
[58:51] wanted children of himself.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; He don't want Amen. He don't want
[58:57] Satan's kids.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; He wants children of himself. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; So he had to have a bride.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; He had to have a woman.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he says, "Now what I'm
[59:14] going to do is I'm going to put it here
[59:18] with the potentials."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And there's a power in that seed.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That p in that in that seed, there's
[59:26] such a power of life, it'll tear that
[59:30] ground off.
[59:33] Come on.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; It'll tear that ground up.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go on home.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; It'll tear that life up.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; It'll tear this body up. It'll transform
[59:45] like it's never been transformed before.
[59:50] [applause]
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; See? Amen. What's in there, it's going
[59:58] to tear out after a while.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why?" It's a power in itself.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Because of the life.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Last night I had half gallon water jugs.
[1:00:14] Ain't got nothing this morning.
[1:00:16] [laughter] Has anybody got any water in
[1:00:18] there?
[1:00:21] See, everybody jumps up.
[1:00:24] It's a little late, ain't it?
[1:00:28] I got you back on my terms now.
[1:00:32] Thank you, buddy. And you're a good guy.
[1:00:35] You even opened it.
[1:00:40] Listen to this.
[1:00:42] See, a lot of time we say,
[1:00:46] you know, we look around and we see
[1:00:48] people leaving.
[1:00:50] No,
[1:00:52] they wasn't part of the life
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; of the seed.
[1:00:58] and they can't help it.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; You know, you ever plant corn,
[1:01:04] you know, and I'm not talking about big,
[1:01:07] but you know, you plant corn and you
[1:01:10] plant that row of corn and sometimes you
[1:01:14] got a heel here, but you got one way
[1:01:17] over here. You got one over here, but
[1:01:20] you still planted corn, but there was no
[1:01:23] life. The life was an innness, but it
[1:01:26] looked just like it.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; It's out of the same package.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But it was no life in this one
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; to bust through the earth.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't nothing in here.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't life to reproduce
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; another stalk of corn.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That's the reason God had to elect.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He had to elect something and
[1:01:52] put a life in it
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; that it could bust forth through all
[1:01:56] kind of trials.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; All kind of heartaches.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Because it had a power
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; in itself
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; to bring forth
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; to show [screaming] who it was.
[1:02:08] [applause]
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Huh? See, I never had the power of life
[1:02:13] to be a Brandham.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Or or a glover.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there was a power of life in
[1:02:21] me
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; that I came forth
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; to identify the longorous s
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; that make sense to you sir.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. See because amen when that baby
[1:02:36] come forth it had a power of life
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; within itself.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It started kicking, hollering,
[1:02:45] screaming, all this kind of stuff. He
[1:02:47] wanted to put it back in there right
[1:02:48] then. But he he couldn't.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; But he had a power of life within
[1:02:52] itself.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Huh? And so what it does, it starts
[1:02:59] Amen. starts moving
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; or starts Amen. nursing.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; To peel the life that's in it.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch what he says. He said, "Now
[1:03:16] watch it." He said now it can only bring
[1:03:18] forth the power of life that's within
[1:03:22] it. Amen. That's within it to transform
[1:03:24] itself.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have Andrew. Amen. To
[1:03:30] transform
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; the life.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; I hear what is he doing? He waters,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; but he'll never bring forth
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; the life,
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; but he can water it. He can fertile it
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; but he can't bring life.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And it can't bring life when there's no
[1:03:51] life to be brought.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason. Amen. Brother
[1:03:59] said there's nothing. Denomination
[1:04:01] system is still born.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; It's still born. There's no life there.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; The ground was prepared.
[1:04:15] Everything was Amen. Everything was uh
[1:04:18] uh uh ministered like it's supposed to
[1:04:19] be, but there was nothing in there.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; That's the reason when David saw the ark
[1:04:26] coming,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; he got so excited,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; he got to dancing,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; but the church
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; got all uptight about it.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; His wife began to get ugly.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because the word was coming.
[1:04:44] life was coming.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she had a dead womb.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that church cannot reproduce
[1:04:55] itself.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because but they look good.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; They talk good
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; but there was no power of life within
[1:05:03] itself.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] So, so the thing about is brother B said
[1:05:13] he's put in there we're potentials.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] Now the word potentials means having the
[1:05:22] capacity to become something or develop
[1:05:25] something in the future.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't bride in the first age.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; It was sort of making it.
[1:05:38] Right.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; But he came all the way down. You say,
[1:05:41] "We have, but brother said, bride, bride
[1:05:42] all through the ages." Yeah, but she
[1:05:44] couldn't be full bride until this last
[1:05:47] day.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; She couldn't manifest herself. She went
[1:05:51] into the ground.
[1:05:54] But now there's now God planted a seed
[1:05:57] with potentials.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. To
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; to uh Amen. develop in the future of the
[1:06:07] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Brother man said he said look whatever
[1:06:18] Amen. Amen. Whatever it was the
[1:06:22] transforming power that God put the in
[1:06:26] the seed
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; God put in the seed.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; To Amen. with the power to transform
[1:06:32] itself into the body or the bride of
[1:06:36] Jesus Christ. And it's not you making
[1:06:38] it.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandon was actually like
[1:06:46] this like the the package.
[1:06:49] He put the package at the end of the row
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; and he said this is this this will be a
[1:06:55] bride.
[1:06:58] That's good.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; This will be a bride.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; But he put the package.
[1:07:06] Amen. And so we saw Amen. all of this
[1:07:09] struggling through time.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; All of it struggled.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; It went through drafts.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Went through storms.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. All through time.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it doing? Struggling.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But life was in it.
[1:07:26] Life was in it
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; during the struggle. Life was in it.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. As a Amen. As the time went on and
[1:07:34] the right sun,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Begin to bail down on it.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And when that sun begin to draw,
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; the earth begin to quiver.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something begin to happen on the
[1:07:47] inside because the sun begin to draw
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; the life
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; that's in the seed. Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful there.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; See, you know, God's got it already
[1:08:03] fixed.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] Amen. And so the prophet of God says,
[1:08:11] "Amen." So, he's not going back down
[1:08:14] here and saying, "Well, I'm going to try
[1:08:15] to pick up brother so and so, sister so
[1:08:17] and so, and I'm going to try to make
[1:08:19] them bright."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That ain't happening.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That ain't happening.
[1:08:24] And why you're so happy today.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. With what the revelation is
[1:08:30] because you have busted through the
[1:08:33] earth.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You have busted through this earth.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And now you begin to see
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; what the word of God's all about.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, we come from everything.
[1:08:52] Hey, I was born a Roman Catholic.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] Then I got in amongst the my mama got us
[1:08:59] into the Protestants. Amen. Then I got

[1:09:06] I baptized you night of Pentecost.
[1:09:09] Woo Jesus.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; But see that couldn't bring me to life.
[1:09:15] Come on, brother.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But one day,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; the sun went over the earth.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That there was a life.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. They've been placed with a power
[1:09:28] of life within itself.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And when the word spoke,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; something began to happen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody said, "Well, I've been
[1:09:38] trying to quit this." Uhuh.
[1:09:41] When life begin to break forth,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; something begin to happen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when that son, the sen comes
[1:09:52] over and he breaks the earth.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; He'll let you come through there
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and he's pulling the life out of it.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you can throw the
[1:10:05] package away.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Now it's it's Amen. Now it's that
[1:10:09] identification. Come on.

[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cucumbers didn't come up in the
[1:10:27] playh in a place of reddishes.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We didn't come up Luther.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; We didn't come up west.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We didn't even come up Pentecostals.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We come up in the hour to reflect or to
[1:10:45] identify the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I've been trying
[1:10:52] to quit this." You know, when an eagle,

[1:17:07] said, "Look." Amen. Amen. and he comes
[1:17:10] in, that creeper comes in and it and it
[1:17:12] and it pulls that corn stalk down. But
[1:17:15] it don't take the life of the corn out.

[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it? God's identifying you
[1:17:57] as a corn.

[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Say amen. Pro know God said, "Oh, Satan
[1:18:07] had power to deform him."

[1:26:32] family would get they were. We still all

[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; from glory.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] And I thought this morning we stand here
[1:27:02] as identification.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We stand here as identification.
[1:27:08] You know our brother, brother brother
[1:27:09] Matt was telling me different ones has
[1:27:10] been saved, baptized and also what is
[1:27:13] it? You was out here
[1:27:17] now you're here.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And and as as you have you matured now
[1:27:23] you begin to be identified.
[1:27:28] You begin to become an identified of who
[1:27:31] you are,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who are you? That robe of flesh
[1:27:36] that you've been wearing for 30, 40, 50
[1:27:38] years is
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Mr. Robin W.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But you fixing to be identified.
[1:27:45] The package of the world is going to see
[1:27:47] who you are.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Because brother Ram said, "Amen. Things
[1:27:51] that ought to be." He said, "One day
[1:27:53] he'll display this bride to the world."
[1:27:57] So, Amen. The package is not no longer
[1:28:00] at the end of the row. Now, the row has
[1:28:02] been made manifest. Stand your feet with
[1:28:04] us. Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him this morning.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Was it all right?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I Can I Can I come back?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Trust me. Amen. I love you.
[1:28:20] Appreciate you. Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But you're only going to identify
[1:28:23] yourself.
[1:28:25] You can tell brother Matt, you can tell
[1:28:26] brother Andrew, you can tell brother
[1:28:27] Homer, you can tell us all about you.
[1:28:31] One day you'll identify yourself,
[1:28:34] what you really are.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] You know, the thing about is I thinking
[1:28:40] about this morning, how much God's given
[1:28:44] people talent to do things that's not
[1:28:47] even ordained of God. But your talent
[1:28:50] has been blessed. We've been blessed
[1:28:51] with it. But this morning, you may not
[1:28:54] be able to carry a tune in a bucket.
[1:28:57] Me, too. But you know what? You've been
[1:29:00] identified
[1:29:02] at the end of the row.
[1:29:05] Amen.
[1:29:07] I don't know who he is, but I'd sure
[1:29:10] like to be like that.
[1:29:12] Amen.
[1:29:14] What is it? Identification.
[1:29:17] God showing the world. Did he say it?
[1:29:20] Yeah, he said it. He said, "I want a
[1:29:23] display."
[1:29:26] My brother said, "He'll display to the
[1:29:27] world." That ain't in the millennium.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; That ain't in heaven. Come on. Come on.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; That's over here in the back woods of
[1:29:36] wherever we at.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Back in these woods.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; He's got some place to identify [music]
[1:29:43] the people.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Push back in the corner. Push back out
[1:29:48] here.
[1:29:50] But he's got a people that's going to
[1:29:51] identify. I'm going to display them
[1:29:54] people.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; How's he going to do that? None yet.
[1:29:58] None your business.
[1:30:01] But I'm going to display her
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; cuz a prophet of God left his word.
[1:30:06] You know, prophet of God could leave us
[1:30:09] and never worry about us
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; because he knew what was planted.
[1:30:14] [singing]
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, somebody help me. I
[1:30:19] got to stay down." No, I done stored up.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I done stored up food.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I showed him at the
[1:30:30] end of the road, spoke the words,
[1:30:31] original seed. I got a package there,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; but now we got a manifestation of it.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Now it's coming to fruition.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Did you think, Amen. When you when you
[1:30:44] start getting age, Amen. things starts
[1:30:47] changing. Look at him. He's whiteheaded.
[1:30:52] Didn't help his looks, [laughter]
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; but there's been a change, right?
[1:30:58] [music]
[1:31:01] He's changed into a maturity.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Like brother Ram said, that oak like
[1:31:07] that old oak tree, you go get center of
[1:31:09] the shade of it.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] But we're coming to that time that
[1:31:17] brother R said, I already done it. Now I
[1:31:19] can slip off the scene. Because he said,
[1:31:22] now this has become a pest house.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now I want to step out of here. Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I already put it at the
[1:31:28] end of the row."
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Already planted at the end of the row. I
[1:31:34] stored it up. Now there's going to be a
[1:31:36] matt Mars. Amen. [music]
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; He's going to come. Oh, he's went
[1:31:42] through a lot of battles, but still been
[1:31:44] corn.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Still corn.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; So this morning, Amen. Look at your
[1:31:53] identification this morning.
[1:31:55] Amen. Of who you really are. God's
[1:31:57] identifying. God's identifying that
[1:32:00] bride now.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unbelievers
[1:32:06] has started to jump off
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; as we pierce the sun to our headship.
[1:32:13] Bugs starts getting off of us.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And then we get there. Brother said be
[1:32:21] just very few
[1:32:23] cuz all this road that was planted just
[1:32:25] a few hills come up.
[1:32:28] One here,
[1:32:30] one Alabama,
[1:32:32] one Georgia.
[1:32:37] Why? But it's all planted.
[1:32:40] It's all planted. Just a few came up.
[1:32:45] Amen. You love him with all your heart.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Is this all right, brother? It's okay.
[1:32:50] Amen.
[1:32:52] You love him. Sing it this morning. I
[1:32:54] love him because he first love me. As
[1:32:56] Mike come, brother Matt comes. Amen.
[1:33:02] I love him.
[1:33:08] I
[1:33:11] love him.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:33:18] [singing]
[1:33:19] Oh, slip your hands up and say, "God, I
[1:33:20] love you.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I may be in a battle. I may be torn. I
[1:33:26] may be pretty weary,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; but I'm still corn. [music]
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I'm still part of the body."
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, church.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody loves
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. like he loves to hear his people
[1:33:42] say, "I love you."
[1:33:45] Hallelujah. Do you know that brother
[1:33:47] Benham taught me that I am Jesus's
[1:33:50] victory? When he looks at me and I'm in
[1:33:53] my struggle, he says he's a man after my
[1:33:56] own heart.
[1:33:58] He's in a struggle,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; but he's a man after my heart.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; I see him in a battle.
[1:34:05] Amen. But I see him lifting up in the
[1:34:07] night time, raising his hands and said,
[1:34:09] "Lord, I want to love you more than I
[1:34:13] ever loved you before.
[1:34:18] And we sing that song victory in Jesus.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; But Jesus sings it victory.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Come over here.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; When David was dancing, his wife was all
[1:34:34] beside herself. Brother said, "Jesus,
[1:34:38] God looked out there and he said, "God,
[1:34:39] he's a man after my own heart.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; He's acting a crazy. He's acting wild.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can just feel him.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I can just feel him."
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be acting strange.
[1:34:55] You may be going through a battle. And
[1:34:57] God said, "He's a man after my own
[1:35:00] heart."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen."
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I remember Jack Cole saying one time
[1:35:13] Jack called sad.
[1:35:16] This little old person come to him and
[1:35:19] such a weary
[1:35:24] and all beat out of shape but she needed
[1:35:27] God to do something. He said I just
[1:35:30] prayed for her. Said I prayed for her
[1:35:32] and he said now angels step back for
[1:35:35] she's fixing to have a spell.
[1:35:39] Step back cuz she's going to have a
[1:35:41] spell.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz I just delivered her.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; I just saved her. Step back, angel. Get
[1:35:47] back. Amen. They fixing to have a spell.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you in Jesus name. Bless you,
[1:35:55] brother.
[1:35:58] Oh.
[1:36:06] Amen. Can you sing it to him with all
[1:36:07] your heart now? Oh yes, I
[1:36:12] love [music and singing] him.
[1:36:16] I
[1:36:18] love [singing] him
[1:36:22] because
[1:36:24] [singing]
