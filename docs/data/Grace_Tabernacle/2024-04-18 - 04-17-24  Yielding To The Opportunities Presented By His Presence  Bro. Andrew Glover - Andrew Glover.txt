to turn to the Book of Psalms the 16th chapter amen we want to look there in psalm 16 and then we're going to go to the Book of Matthew but in the Book of Psalms the 16th chapter we want to read there tonight and we do want to say Amen we have appreciated the opportunity once again to be with you all and amen to spend a few days here with you and amen we pray something was said on Sunday to bless you and to encourage you amen I believe you've had a confession this week of you're coming out of it amen no matter what we're going through we're coming out of it amen anden sure appreciate brother Matt appreciate his friendship his stand on this word and amen the opportunity to stand here once again and minister to you we we thank the Lord for that brother Ben all the saints come down from Hardy amen God bless you all and had a wonderful time with him last night amen it good just to serve the Lord together amen Psalm 16 and: 11 David here writing says Thou will show me the path of life for in thy presence is the fullness of joy amen I love that in thy presence is the fullness of joy so in his presence is not partial Joy but in thy presence is the fullness of joy and at thy right hand which is power at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen I believe in the presence of God there is a promise for the joy of God and at his right hand amen there are Pleasures forever more now in the book of St Matthew the 18th chapter I want to read there in the 20th verse and amen if it be okay tonight I'm just going to take another portion on what we were speaking a little bit here on Wednesday or Sunday morning to you Amen in the the scriptures here in Matthew chapter 18 and verse number winie I love this verse because it's speaking amen of worshippers and here he says in the 20th verse Jesus speaking he said for where two or three are gathered together in my name he says there am I in the midst of them where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them now we're more than two or three here tonight and we're gathered in his name then I can say he is here in our midst in the Book of Matthew the 28th chapter just a few chapters over in the 20th verse here Jesus again speaking in Matthew 28:20 and he says these words teaching them to observe all things for whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even un the end of the world brother B said or the consummation of the ages and we know tonight we're at the end of the Gentile dispensation of Ages but he is still here with his church amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to amen for just a few moments tonight if I could Amen to continue speaking to you here on yielding Amen to Opportunities presented by the message of the hour amen and tonight I want to read this quote just to lay a foundation from the message Jehovah Gyra 1964 brother R said now remember that Christ is risen from the dead and is Among Us how many believes that Christ is risen from the dead and is Among Us he said and get that in your mind see that Christ is raised from the dead and is Among Us now we have seen all kinds of great moves and shouting and praising God that's all fine he said we've spoken tongues and prophesied and all we've seen all that that's fine that comes right along with it but remember amen the last thing is his divine presence the word itself amen so the last thing is not shouting or prophesying or speaking in tongues we believe in all those things amen but the last thing is the word itself he is the word amen the head the word it's coming to the body see that word in Hebrews 4 the fourth chapter said the word of God is sharper more powerful than any two-edged sword and is a discerner amen of the thoughts and intents of the heart he said now take that scripture and run it right back from the beginning of the prophets amen run it right on down through Jesus Christ and see if that isn't the same thing the same thing that he is known as the Messiah I believe that he is known as the Messiah amen but I believe I'm speaking to Messiah s amen amen I believe that he was the Messiah and the pro of God said now it's not some man here is the Messiah amen but it's the holy spirit is the Messiah amen and Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing amen so here it is here now amen just working in the flesh getting the body ready amen for the rapturing grace so this last thing amen is the word itself coming to the body which will be the ushering in of the rapturing grace amen for the escaping of the Church of the Living God now when brother said I want you to remember the last thing amen I believe that he is referring Amen to several things that he's already spoke of in his message like your tape amen the the restoration of the Bride tree remember he said there were four death Messengers eat the tree down he said but there'll be four life Messengers that will restore the tree back and he said the Locust the cankerworm the palmerworm the caterpillar he said those were the death Messengers he said but those life Messengers would be Wesley and Pentecost and sanctification amen but listen amen I don't want to just stop at the third stage amen or neither do I want to stop at the third line amen but the prophet of God said justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way amen for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down Amen in Perfection back to the word again Amen to manifest itself amen so the whole reason why that we're preaching the message amen is so that the word might come into the church and manifest itself the way it promised to be manifested in the age we're living in now in 1 John 1:7 we read it on Sunday amen but the Bible said if we walk in the light amen as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin that word walk again means to to make one's way it means to progress it means to make due use of opportunities again in Romans 13:11 Paul said knowing the time amen that now it is High Time Amen to awaken out of our sleep for now is our Salvation near amen than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness amen and let us put on the armor of light again in Ephesians 5:116 Paul said Redeeming the time amen because the days are evil now amen can we break that down again Redeeming the time amen Redeeming the time means to buy up every and each opportunity it means you don't let one opportunity pass you by amen you remember on Sunday that these are not Services amen these are opportunities in the presence of almighty God Amen that word time is the Supreme moment amen it's the golden opportunity in other words Paul is saying redeem amen or yield to our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself I want to say it like this y'all remember in the Bible amen that there was the there was the holies of holies remember amen and Aaron had a rod amen and Aaron's Rod got left in the Shak kind of Glory or in the holies of holies and the Propet of God said now when that old dead Rod was brought out in there amen and laid in the presence of God himself what happened amen it budded and it blossomed and it yielded fruit amen when that Dead stick he said amen off of an almond tree was cut off and died he said but when it got in the presence of God it begin to Bud it begin to Blossom and it begin to bloom he said and when a man was cut off from God he died spiritually amen but once brought in the place of God Amen before the presence of God Amen he comes to life and yields life and let me say this I don't know where you're at in your journey amen but you ought to be able to Rejoice tonight amen that you're not in the presence of a dead denomination amen trying to produce Life by dead works but you have come back under the headship amen of the word of Jesus Christ amen and you are a Believer who is bring and you're brooding and you're bringing forth the fruit of the promise amen of God's word and you all know that God has laws right amen the prophet of God said God has laws and one law amen that I love amen is found in the book of Romans the 6th chapter and the 12th verse it is the law amen of presenting and yielding it is the law of presenting and yielding in Romans 612 the Bible said let not sin therefore Amen reain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof in verse 13 He said neither yield ye your members amen as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin amen but yield yourselves unto God Amen how many says that's what I've come to do amen is to yield myself unto God Amen as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God let me just take a moment here Amen in break this verse down amen that word members is a limb or a member of the human body that word yield it means to present it means to provide Amen to a place a person or thing at one's disposal it is to present a person for another Amen to see in question to present or show to bring to to bring near it means to bring into one's fellowship or intimacy that word instruments is a weapon it is a tool or an Implement for preparing a thing and amen it is arms that are used in Warfare now look what Paul goes on to say amen for sin shall not have dominion over you amen for you are not under the law but you're under grace What then shall we sin because we're not under the law but under grace he said God forbid amen know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey amen his servants he are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death amen or obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked how many wants to thank God Amen that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart amen the form of Doctrine amen which was delivered unto you you all know that Malachi 4 says amen that God would turn our hearts back Amen to the faith of the fathers you realize Paul prophesied amen that the veil would remain upon the heart but there shall be a day which shall be known unto the Lord amen and at that day the heart shall turn to God God and when the heart is turned to God Amen the veil will come off of the heart and the believer will see the Mighty God Amen unveiled in plain view before him listen church amen we're not a bunch of Catholics here tonight amen trying to go through some man to get to God but God has sent a prophet in this generation and he has returned the church amen to Bible Doctrine amen and we're believe in that Doctrine amen not from a membership not from a handshake amen but from her heart we believe in the Oneness of God from our heart we believe in water baptism from our heart we believe in the power of God Amen we're not believing these things from just some church membership oh no we're believing these things from our heart look at this word obeyed it is to hearken to it is of one who on the knock at the door amen comes to listen to who it is so actually if somebody knocks on the door amen and you get up amen you're obeying the knock come on church when somebody knocks on the door and you respond to the knock to go over and see who is at the door amen you are obeying the knock at the door you know Revelation 3:20 said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and will open the door I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me can I pick up something from the voice of the sign he said his voice will speak one day and a sign will come amen and what will it do the lotsy and sign must be the same as it was then can I take a minute and say this the message of the hour amen does not change the come on Church it does not change the word to fit the church but the message of the hour changes the church amen to fit the word amen the church is not God's pattern amen but the word is God's pattern amen and the church will have to conform Amen to the word because the word will will not conform to the church and I say thank God in the last days there has been a voice of vindication that has come among this generation there's been a knock at the door and it was not the bringing of a Creed it was not the restoring of a man's idea it was the restoration of the divine presence of God himself coming back in the church to manifest himself according to the word of God the layout of see and sign must be the same as it was then see there will be a voice speak to us in the last day remember Le out a see a sign Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and when he was put out of the church in the lay out of s age we find out he is put out again Amen on the inside brother said it's the most ridiculous it's the most prophetic it's the most pitiful scripture in the entire Bible amen is Jesus Christ on the outside of his own church he said but look the voice says if aren't you thankful for a prophet If any man will cooperate if anybody will let me come in amen I'll come and sck with him and they with me amen I'll come in and I'll be in them he's standing Brother David Paul on the rank of the outside of the church age but he's standing there saying if any man will open the door and just cooperate with me just a little bit amen I will come in and I will sck with them I'll make myself known to them if I can just get in oh God if I can just get in like I did on the emus road if I can just get in amen I'll make myself known to them amen Christ said I will suck or I will reveal myself to them I will reveal that I am the same yesterday today and forever and the son of man will be revealed in that day when all the church hanity and everything else becomes Sodom like that I'll be on the outside I'll be knocking amen trying to get in what Grace Tabernacle amen take off your sad shoes and put on your shouting shoes tonight amen Jesus Christ is not on the outside of the church amen trying to get in trying to reveal trying to Fellowship amen but there is a knock that has come on the door but there was a seed on the inside of the heart and that heart received the doctrine of God with a voice of Thanksgiving with a praise of hallelujah hallelujah amen I'm not a crazy man I believe it's another of mayus road walk I believe there's some young people that you let him come in I believe there's some Elders here that you let him come in I believe there's some preachers here that you let him come in I say thank God he has stepped into the midst of the church in the power of his resurrection and he's changed things and he's saved lives and he's restored homes he's filled Souls he's redeemed people I'm talking about Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever I'm talking about there's been a knock on the door and someone has responded can I say this amen if someone knocks on the door they're presenting you something but when you open the door you are yielding to what's being presented I can I say the devil has presented this generation with all kinds of things and they have yielded to it brother B said like this he said now the flesh says there's no need you pretty little thing you're the prettiest little thing in school see now don't you pay any attention that Holy Roller mother of yours or that fanatic father SE you're the best looking girl in school you're the prettiest boy you're the best looking boy you're the best built you're the most popular there is in the city you see and you brother B said and you yield your members to that and where do you come out at amen the little end of the horn Every Time come on Amen you yield your lives Amen to the voices of Hollywood and you come out at the little end of the horn every time but Paul said amen My Flesh always wants to yield to that see amen and your flesh does too but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do oh Church of the Living God there has been a heart Doctrine there has been a heart message there has been a doctrine of the word of God that has been coming to the heart of the church hey we're not serving God from our flesh we're not serving God from our spirit amen we're serving God from our hearts we're serving God from our soul amen that's why tonight amen you might have had a bad day but you got to praise anyhow amen you might be facing something tomorrow but you got to praise anyhow amen because you're serving God Amen because you yielded Amen to the last thing to come to the Gentile dispensation and that is the restoration of the word of God hey I want to tell that devil I'm not talking to church members I'm talking to chosen instruments of almighty God that is coming to this generation Amen to accomplish God's purpose amen had a long time getting here Benji but I made it amen the Bible said that Jesus was born Amen to do the will of God Amen and for this purpose amen he has com into the world and here a prophet of God is saying that you didn't come here by accident you didn't come here by chance you didn't stagger into this message amen but the reason you was born amen was to be an instrument unto God Amen to accomplish the purpose of the word in the age you're living in I say there's going to be a bride and she's going to be a Victorious bride I say there's going to be some Overcomers and you are them hey I do well I feel good I don't I do not believe there's one devil that will escape this bride I don't believe there's one devil that'll be able to say nobody in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen was able to conquer me I believe on the morning of the Rapture every devil every devil will be under the foot of the Bride of Jesus Christ and she will be

the pyramids survived amen the flood amen and this Bible has survived more floods and more fires come on church amen but let's not just leave it in the Zodiac let's not just leave it in the pyramids let's not just leave it in paper form amen but ye are written Epistles amen read of all men hey I'm not just reading from a Bible hey I'm looking at a Bible I'm not just reading from the scripture I'm looking at the scripture I'm looking at Malachi 4 fulfilled I'm looking at Acts 2 fulfilled I'm looking at John 14 fulfilled I'm looking at Isaiah 53 fulfilled I'm looking at Isaiah 55 fulfilled I'm looking at every scripture that is pertaining to the Bride of Jesus Christ manifested in flesh before me see what what what did David say he said then said I lo I come Amen in the volume of the book I come in the volume of the book it is written of me he said I Delight to do thy will oh my God yay thy law is within my heart David here is saying my law is within my heart in Psalms 143:10 he said teach me to do thy will for thou art my God thy spirit is good lead me into the land of the uprightness in Hebrews 10:7 then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice Hebrews 108 sacrifice an offering and burn offerings and offering for sin now wouldest not neither had this pleasure therein which are offered by the law what did Paul say in Romans 6 we are not under the law but we are under grace watch verse n then said he lo I come to do my will and to do what I think's best and to do the way I feel no lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second brother picks this up in the Hebrew series and reads the ninth verse and says as long as you're a presbyterian or a Pentecostal or a Baptist or a Methodist he can never do nothing with you he has to take that all the way first see so he can establish the second amen long as you say well I'm a Methodist I nothing against the Methodist or the Baptist or the Pentecostal but brother that don't spell it see you've got to go on to to Perfection amen and that is into Christ come on church we didn't just come to justification we're not just coming to sanctification we're not even just coming to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we are coming to the last thing where we are rest returned to the presence of God and we are yielding our hearts to that presence and we're bringing forth what is concealed in the book in flesh he said by that which we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all can we read our Bibles a little bit amen Hebrews 10:11 and every priest standed daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever he sat down on the right hand of God from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days sayth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them amen can I say it in verse 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more oh Church of the Living God this message is the dismissing of your human mind that remembers all your faults remembers all all your failures remembers all your mistakes the message of the hour is the removing of the human mind and it is the imparting of the mind of Jesus Christ hey and in that mind he don't remember your sins and in that mind he don't remember your iniquities oh I wish I was out in the field right now I would cut up amen under this message I can say these words you'd never done it in the first place under this message I can preach to you you are the sinless amen spotless pride of Jesus Christ and you know how I can say that is because I was under the sin I was a servant under sin but God who was rich in Mercy they been sent a doctrine of the return of the word of God and I obeyed it in my heart and I turned my heart oh God I love how the prodag God says it he said if there was if there was never another case besides this lady that would be a perfect evidence of the Divine will of our Lord Jesus Christ to every person on the earth see he never he's talking about a woman who was ridden with cancer he never just picked out certain ones and said whosoever will let him come no he said whosoever will let him come see it's just according to your faith to believe he says I want to continue to speak about our Lord and his ministry today now there's many people in the Bible that teaches the Bible as a historical book which it is but it's more than a history it's a prophetic book book also that for Tails see it tells what was and it tells what will be do you accept that to be the truth and now the same Jesus that was is and will be see he's the same Jesus all the way through the scriptures the same Christ all the way through in the beginning he was in the middle of the book he's here lo I come in the volume of the book

been ushered back into the presence of God hey I'm happy to be alive and to be here how many's happy to be here with the opportunity once again to preach the gospel The unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ and we pray that as we present him to the people today in the form of the written word May the Holy Spirit Quicken the word to all of us that we might prepare ourselves for his coming Lord Jesus we thank thee that brought again the Lord Jesus from the dead and has presented him to us this morning in the form of the holy spirit amen that is wooing our hearts as for a closer walk with him again he says has presented him to us in the form of the Holy ghost that now comes blessing our hearts and ministering to us the things that we have need of in this life's journey can I say this God has always been here in some form he is come on in the form of the prophets in the form of the pyramids in the form of Ls in the form of Angels in the form of the Y amen God has always been here in some form amen but today he's here in the form of a prophetic message which is the last thing which is the divine presence of God himself can I say this it's the presence of the Lord that gives us Faith it's the presence of the Lord amen that gives us knowledge it's the presence of the Lord that gives us courage to face another day it's the presence of the Lord amen that refreshes us it's the presence of the Lord that saves us it's the presence of the Lord That Forgives us of our sins and imp parts are Revelation in our souls and our sins are forgiven and our iniquities are remembered no more the holy spirit moves out on the building and speaks to whomever he will speak see that's Sovereign and then that brings the knowledge of God's Sovereign because it's a promise of God Amen and also brings his presence down Among Us he said we should see it and rejoice we should see his presence and rejoice we shouldn't look at his presence and question we should see his presence and rejoice now how many's heard the the the the the term ministered this is the appearing of Christ honestly let me see your hands you you've seen you've heard the term this is the appearing of Christ well there's a few that I just want to share this here in second Timothy 1:9 there is a difference between the coming of Christ and the appearing of Christ in 2 Timothy 1:9 the Bible says who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given in given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest amen by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel in second Timothy 4:8 Paul says again henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing can I give you another one in Titus 2:13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people amen zealous of Good Works look at this word appearing it means in the New Testament it is the Advent of Christ not only that which has already taken place and by which his presence and Power here in the saving light he has shed upon Mankind and can I say this it takes a prophet Amen to rightly divide the word of Truth and to separate the coming of Christ from the appearing of Christ don't you ever forget we are looking for the coming of Christ but we are living in the appearing of Christ is that clear enough we're looking for the coming living in his appearing he said there's a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming see the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord see now the appearing of the Lord is now when he is appearing in his people his spirit is working among them amen proving that it's him with them are you ready for this getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord to catch away his bride the appearing and the coming I'm going somewhere because we've all said in meetings and heard these words he's here how many's heard that he's here watch a prophet now the appearing amen the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us amen doing the works he once did in his church now you're a part of that church and by Grace you believe I am a member of that church now can I say this watch a prophetic announcement Amen brother B says but my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher see I'm not if I say something wrong brother forgive me I don't mean it but this is my Ministry see is to declare him amen that he's here we've heard that preached we shout about that but let's tonight relieve that Doctrine from the heart and let it release an authority in our praise come on church he I tell you if that Revelation settles in the depths of your soul the next time brother Matt says he's here that'll put such a punch behind your heart you'll say Amen brother I believe he's here because his word said he would be I believe he's here because sin is leaving my life Miracles are taking place in my home things are changing Hey listen what a prophet of God said he said what Jesus was what his presence is now what Jesus was what his presence is now he is supposed to return in the last days we know that through human flesh and declare himself the same way we all know that are we aware of it say Amen if it is now for your I say this to you in his name he is here Church of the Living God he is here the same God that came down and talked to Abraham had his back turned to the tent and Sarah inside the tent he knew what she was thinking see God has sent his spirit amen to endue us with a knowledge of his presence and then Lord we should pray also for these who are sick and Afflicted that this hour amen I'm reading because I'm want to establish or something amen that this hour that something might be done that would so shock this people Amen to an understanding of the realization of the presence of Jesus Christ that their hearts might be opened come on church amen if your heart is closed you will not receive or you will not be able to Bud or to bloom or to yield fruit but if your heart can come open then you can begin to yield your life to the word that you're hearing and there will be a fruit in your walk there will be a fruit in your talk there will be a fruit in your life amen amen can you give me that picture amen listen what a prophet of God says he said let the people cry out amen amen is it okay there amen let the people cry

might have been sicker than she oh mercy there might have been others there that was sicker than she was amen but you see she recognized his presence and she knowed that was her opportunity that was her Supreme moment that was her golden opportunity that was her hour Destiny Amen to buy her opportunity to redeem the time oh Church of the Living God come on Amen I don't know how else to say it than just to say it amen quit letting the devil think you ain't got a right to enjoy the blessings of God because somebody's worse off than you are hey I get it but I can't help The Sovereign plan of God come on church amen I might as well just quit and preach I'm this close to it amen when the presence of God shows up in the meeting quit feeling sorry for yourself quit letting the devil get your oh I'm running out of time get your attention on all other kinds of things and miss your come on amen yeah there's somebody else that should be here yeah there's somebody else should be getting this blessing but brother Mark it was Hur time it was her season and she seized her opportunity am mean can I give you another one amen there was a man named gyrus whose daughter was laying dead but he recognized that this is the resurrection and he seized his opportunity and what did it do it released the resurrection power that was in him can I close on this one Jesus goes to Simon's house he gets by the Foot foot wash flunky and he's in the corner with dirty feet and the pr of God said he looks over at Simon or the woman and he says or rather to Simon can I can I just can I give this to you I'm done he said you never kiss me welcome and this woman ever since I've ever been here has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair and constantly has kissed my feet since I've been here I have something against you Simon but she wasn't Simon come on Grace Tabernacle he had something against Simon but then he turns to her and brother I just imagine her standing there her big eyes all stained up in her face where she had greased and dust off the road and she thinks now have I done wrong have I done wrong and he said I say unto her her sins which are many her sin which are many are all forgiven go in peace well somebody give me some shout room her sins brother Jared which are many are all forgiven go in peace what was it she recognized her opportunity and she did him a service the Pharisees didn't do it she saw it and she recognized his presence and what did it do it washed what did it release to her forgiveness it released her forgiveness of her sins what did it also do it released the power of God to show them unbelievers that he was a prophet he knowed who she was are y'all ready for this and I'm done it also released joy and power and eternal life it released that now watch pilate stood in the same presence and said do some trick for me right in the presence of God and turned it down because of what he appreciated the opinion of the public more than he appreciated having the opportunity to be in the presence of God what are you saying preacher I'm saying if God Appears he appears on purpose brother said we could only realize he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence C can can you take this can you take it and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest you recognize his presence when you see the promise of the word for the age made manifest then you can say he's here that's him can I say this to you he's here he's here to release forgiveness can I tell you this you ain't got to carry grudges no more you ain't got to go home mad at your husband and mad at your wife and mad at your kids and mad at the preacher and mad he's here this is your opportunity to yield to his forgiveness I I I told this I'm going tell here tonight and Matt can get me when he gets home I say this I say sometime or another you got to let things go and not hold them any longer can can I say this some people can some people can let things go and they can move on and somebody that saw it or heard it or was around it 20 years can still be holding it and the person it actually happened to has done moved on y'all know that's the truth y'all know I'm preaching to you now the person that actually got the offense is free of it and you're still walking around holding it and hoping the worst for everybody and I I was telling this I'm going to tell here what I said Matt and get me when he gets home but we we was here one time and some of y'all probably remember we went to somebody turn the internet off uh we went to a restaurant and man I tell you Matt took some people in there and they didn't treat him too good you know and they a little rough on the old guy I mean like man rough brought people in you know so I don't know probably a month or so after that they me Matt calls me one day and he says he I he said hey what you doing I told him I was doing I said what are you doing he said well I'm done here eating it so and so and I said you're back in there he said yeah I said I thought you said you was never going back in there he said well problem is I ain't good at holding grudges and I said well they done you wrong are are you getting the picture he had done moved on but I still wasn't going to go back in there some of y'all right now people done moved on and you're still all bound up and watered and tied up but in thy presence is the fullness of joy is the power of God under salvation is the ability to let things go it's the ability to believe God again come on church I know you've been hurt but believe God again I know your trust has been wounded but trust God again I know people have let you down but believe there's a God in heaven who can still come in the middle of a Wednesday night meeting and can recognize you and you can recognize him and he can release to you all the power and all the presence and all the things he has won't you stand to your feet tonight how many he says I yield I yield I yield to whatever you present Lord I yield to it see remember I told you these are not Services they're opportunities they golden opportunities brother Mark there are Supreme moments they're not moments to take lightly they're not moments to take as well it's just Wednesday night and it's just hurry up and get no no these are Supreme moments I've often said it before I know I might get in trouble but a lot of people man they get saved and they get the whole Holy Ghost and they get in church and they get they get full of some quotes and scriptures and before long they ain't got time for altar calls no more time to go the house you know 45 minutes got that church order book but you know what I bet you're glad they didn't rest the service tonight you went to the altar come on church can you hear my heart tonight these are not services there opportunities in his presence now if this was a Pentecostal Church it'd be a service cuz his presence is outside the building this was a Baptist Church it'd be a service his presence is outside the building they put Creeds and dogmas and doctrines of man and bondage and and all kinds of vomit but this ain't this is a message Church where the Holy Ghost has the rideway the spirit of God can move Hearts can be touched his presence can be felt I sitting today just just taking a few minutes this evening and meditating over some things and I remember brother Mark up in Virginia one night at brother Mike walls in a youth camp we outside my my wife probably remember this was outside in Old brush Harbor and it's hotter I mean it was hot in there I mean hot it's a hot I was preaching and got ready to pass out five minutes into it and all of a sudden brother Benji there was a storm just come just come blowing right in there it's kind of kind of funny we thought about storms today there was a storm just come blowing right in there when that storm come in there it started lightning I mean thundering and well we got probably 200 kids sitting outside under a under a tent or under a canopy and I'm just preaching when all of a sudden there was a a bang of thunder and a crash of lightning and the power just went out I mean just brother Mark just like that just like somebody flipped a switch the power went out and when it did when it did the church literally brother Joe just turned into an uproar of Praise I mean it was just like like like like you would almost set it up to happen like that but I knew we hadn't and brother Carter I was preaching with a microphone like this and I was preaching I I thought well the power's off so there's no need to hold this no more and when I laid it down brother John I heard that little that and I said well the mic still working and I picked it up and I said these words I said and God is still gone I said his word is still true and his power is still here and I just kept right on the preaching like that and brother there was a wind of the Holy Ghost blew right through that meeting I mean people were shouting screaming they were running to the altar well I left there at the end of the service the lights come back home and I left there and I went for two or three years wondering how in the world why did that happen like that and I went back a couple years ago to preach that meeting and a brother took me up to the to the to the cafeteria at the camp and he said brother andw I've been needing to thank you for something I said what's that he said brother Andrew he said you remember that first year we was out here and the lights went out and all that and I said yeah he said well you realize my daughter was sitting in that meeting he said and she was running from God he said and while she was sitting there she said these words she said God if you're God she said then prove yourself and she said if you're not she said then let this man shut up so we can go on he said when she said those words words the Lights Went Out the power went out and he said her next words was this just tell me these were her words she said see God you're not God the power is out the microphone's off he can't even preach he said when you laid that microphone down and there was still power to it how I don't know she said he said but when you picked it back up and you declared God is God and His word is true and his power is here he said brother Andrew she surrendered to God and she still serving him tonight well you know what that looked like that looked like a service to somebody but to her it was a supreme moment to her it was a golden opportunity well I say that same God is right here on Wednesday he's right here on Sunday he's right here in your meetings he's in your Sunday school rooms he's in your musicians he's in the pit he's in your pastor he's in your preachers he's here I said he's here I said he's here I
