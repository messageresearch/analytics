[36:41] and so we sure appreciate them but I
[36:43] want to read tonight out of the Book of
[36:44] Genesis the 21st chapter and the 14th
[36:47] verse the Bible says and Abraham rose up
[36:50] early in the morning and he took bread
[36:51] and a bottle of water and he gave it
[36:53] unto Hagar and putting it on her
[36:55] shoulder and the child and sent her away
[36:58] and she departed and wandered in the
[36:59] wilderness of beerseba and the water was
[37:02] spent in the bottle and she cast the
[37:04] child under one of the shrubs and she
[37:07] went and set her down or set down over
[37:10] against him a good way off and it were a
[37:12] b as if it were a bowshot for she said
[37:15] let me not see the death of the child
[37:18] and she set over against him and she
[37:21] lifted up her voice and she wept and I
[37:24] would like to speak tonight on thirsting
[37:27] for Revelation if you could take your
[37:29] seats on thirsting for Revelation I
[37:32] realize this tonight that our in our
[37:34] lives there is a balance between natural
[37:37] things and spiritual things how many
[37:38] believe that say Amen we believe that we
[37:41] believe that there's there's a
[37:42] difference between our natural life and
[37:44] our spiritual life and uh we realize
[37:46] that nearly nearly everybody on Earth
[37:48] would believe that there is a spiritual
[37:50] side to humanity I I've talked to people
[37:52] from all uh different kinds of beliefs
[37:55] and backgrounds and uh Church going
[37:57] people and not Church going people and
[37:59] different kind of U uh different kind of
[38:01] gods that they serve from from from
[38:04] India and uh uh different places to
[38:06] Korea to uh South America you know
[38:09] around the world you'll find out that
[38:11] majority of people believe in some type
[38:13] of spirituality they believe there's a
[38:15] spiritual uh uh part of our Humanity the
[38:18] doctors will say that there's things
[38:20] that they can't explain the scientists
[38:22] say there's questions that they don't
[38:24] have the answer to but I thank God
[38:26] tonight as a body of belie Believers
[38:27] that not only do we think that but we
[38:29] know it amen uh that that we are as a
[38:32] people that we are Triune beings and in
[38:34] our in our our life or the makeup of our
[38:37] life that Brother Kyle there's a body
[38:39] and there's a soul and there's a spirit
[38:41] and and we realize that we're constantly
[38:43] dealing with these three things it
[38:45] doesn't matter what we do in our life
[38:46] that we're always uh trying our effort
[38:49] our work all that we do is trying to
[38:51] make it our life a place of comfort or a
[38:54] place uh to be satisfied with our life
[38:56] and uh to make things a little bit
[38:58] easier on oursel and so uh it doesn't
[39:00] matter uh what we're doing we're always
[39:02] trying to work on one of these three
[39:04] areas this is this is just what we uh do
[39:07] in our life we spend time working on
[39:09] these areas of our life and you know
[39:11] there's something that I found out that
[39:13] that you can recognize when somebody is
[39:15] working on a certain area of their life
[39:17] you you spend time working in a certain
[39:19] area it always shows in the outward man
[39:22] so you know uh you know you have
[39:23] somebody that's spending time in prayer
[39:25] and they're spending time uh reading
[39:27] their Bible and they're getting closer
[39:28] to God you don't have to go around
[39:29] telling everybody you know I I I've been
[39:31] praying a lot lately I've been reading
[39:33] my Bible a lot it's it's something that
[39:35] automatically shows it shows what's
[39:37] taking place on the inward man is always
[39:39] showing in the outward man and so uh you
[39:41] know I realize that that because we're
[39:43] working on this that uh what happens is
[39:46] sometimes we go to praying and we asking
[39:48] for God to come and move and help in
[39:50] situations and and I believe that God is
[39:53] a God that can take things out of your
[39:54] life I believe in the power of prayer
[39:56] how many believe that I I believe that
[39:57] you can lay hands on the sick and the
[39:59] sick recover I believe those uh that
[40:01] like some that came in Sunday and and
[40:03] and the spirit of the Lord came in and
[40:04] delivered them from Spirits that they've
[40:06] been battling for many years and so I
[40:08] believe that God is certainly able to
[40:10] rid us of spirits and he can drive uh
[40:12] evil spirits out of our life and but I
[40:15] also know this that whenever a spirit
[40:17] leaves a man it always tries to find a
[40:19] way back in and so you may come up and
[40:21] you may get delivered and God May
[40:23] deliver you and and and then all of a
[40:25] sudden here comes that same spirit
[40:27] that's trying to find his way back in
[40:29] and work his way back into our life but
[40:31] I believe that we have a right as a
[40:33] Believer to exercise the rights that God
[40:35] has given us to be able to speak to that
[40:38] spirit that would come in and say I've
[40:39] had a nature change there there's
[40:41] something that's happened in my life and
[40:43] no longer are you welcome here and
[40:45] friends I've got news for you this uh
[40:47] this evening it don't matter what the
[40:48] spirit is you you have a right as a
[40:50] Believer to say i' I've Been Changed
[40:52] God's came and he took that out of my
[40:54] life and I know you're trying to come
[40:56] back in I recognize who you are and I
[40:58] know that there's a tempter and he's
[40:59] always working his way back in but I but
[41:01] I'm a Believer and I've had a nature
[41:03] change and God has done something in my
[41:05] life and I don't want no part of you
[41:06] anymore see there's some there's one
[41:08] thing to allow God to take a spirit or
[41:10] something out of our life but then
[41:12] there's another thing to exercise our
[41:14] rights to keep that from coming in and
[41:17] and to and bringing us back into that
[41:19] place or dragging us back down see it's
[41:21] a constant battle just as hard as you're
[41:23] working to get to a place spiritually
[41:25] that you can be free the devil's working
[41:27] that much harder to get you a place
[41:29] spiritually that you're bound up again
[41:31] see so it's a constant battle not only
[41:33] is it a struggle In the Flesh and a
[41:35] struggle to make it from day to day but
[41:37] brother Mark it's a struggle in the
[41:38] spirit uh to be free and be freed from
[41:41] these things and you know but I I just
[41:43] say this tonight just to uh lay a
[41:45] foundation that I am a believer that
[41:47] people can change how many believes that
[41:49] say Amen I'm a believer that people that
[41:52] that they can change that a person don't
[41:54] have to be the same person that they
[41:56] always were matter of fact I I heard the
[41:58] prayer of a prophet he said Lord may you
[42:00] make our lives so tender and make us so
[42:03] flexible that you can change us at any
[42:05] time and mold us into being Sons and
[42:08] Daughters of God I believe that God can
[42:10] change us I believe that we can be so
[42:12] flexible that God can use us and you
[42:15] know I realize that tonight that when we
[42:17] go to work that we're working on these
[42:18] things when you go to your job you're
[42:20] working you're dealing with carnal
[42:22] things you're trying to you're you're
[42:23] you're dealing with your natural life
[42:25] you work to make your natural life
[42:27] better but when you come to the house of
[42:29] God we don't come to the house of God to
[42:31] deal with the natural life we come to
[42:32] deal with a spiritual life so if you can
[42:34] go to to the to the Natural work and you
[42:37] can work there to get better off in the
[42:39] natural and I believe that you can come
[42:41] to the house of God and you can do some
[42:42] spiritual work and you can go away
[42:44] better off as a spiritual man we don't
[42:47] come we come here to deal with a
[42:48] spiritual man and the soul of a man and
[42:50] you know that's why that I don't believe
[42:52] that we ought to have a carnal church
[42:54] because I believe that that that that
[42:56] there's no place in the house House of
[42:57] God for carnality I believe the house of
[42:59] God is a spiritual place I believe it
[43:01] ought to be kept as a spiritual place it
[43:03] ought to be kept as a sanctuary that God
[43:06] can move in and deal with the hearts of
[43:07] people it it ain't a place of joking and
[43:09] making fun and poking around but it's a
[43:12] place that we can come and dedicate a a
[43:14] certain part of our life and a time of
[43:16] our life and a little place of Refuge
[43:18] that the Holy Spirit can come with deal
[43:20] and deal with hearts and lives and so we
[43:22] come to the house of God brother Mark we
[43:24] come to grow in the word of God we come
[43:26] to grow in our experience with God and I
[43:28] realize that today there's all kinds of
[43:30] churches that they ain't the same way
[43:32] there's all kinds of of carnal churches
[43:34] and carnal things that you can go to but
[43:36] friends I've got news for you if you can
[43:38] go to a church and you can't grow in the
[43:41] word of God and you can't grow in faith
[43:43] and you can't grow in Revelation then
[43:44] you need to find a church that you can
[43:46] go to that you can grow in faith and you
[43:48] can grow in God and you can grow in
[43:50] Revelation and you can get closer to God
[43:53] I believe that we have a right to be
[43:55] spiritually worked on by the spirit of
[43:56] God how many believe that see what
[43:59] happens is when our spiritual man is
[44:01] strengthened then you begin to gain
[44:03] power as a Believer you gain power over
[44:05] sickness you gain power over problems
[44:07] you you get power over family struggles
[44:10] over those inherited qualities that was
[44:12] passed down from generation to
[44:14] generation when you get to a place with
[44:16] God and you begin to grow spiritually
[44:18] you gain power over these things that
[44:20] have always had power over you that's
[44:22] why I believe that we ought to have a
[44:24] spiritual church that's why we fight to
[44:26] keep atmosphere in the house of God
[44:29] because there's nothing carnal that can
[44:31] that can help a spiritual man there's
[44:33] nothing carnal that can that can grow a
[44:35] spiritual man it takes a moving of the
[44:37] spirit of God it takes a growing in the
[44:40] spirit of God to help that spiritual
[44:42] side of our Humanity see a spiritual a
[44:45] spirit filled church I believe this is a
[44:47] powerful church but let me tell you this
[44:49] if a spir how many believe that and but
[44:52] but if a Spirit-filled church is a
[44:54] powerful church then what do you think a
[44:55] spirit filled man is he's a powerful man
[44:58] a Spirit-filled woman she's a powerful
[45:00] woman but let me tell you it only comes
[45:02] by one way according to the scripture
[45:04] we'll only find it by Revelation I I
[45:07] remember when they come out of the upper
[45:08] room that day and here they were they
[45:10] had been in contact with the power of
[45:12] the Holy Ghost the Bible said here they
[45:14] come out of there they were staggering
[45:16] around like drunk men and they the
[45:18] people would look at them and say that
[45:20] that they've been drunk but we realize
[45:21] it wasn't the drinking of a natural wine
[45:23] it wasn't that old wine that people
[45:25] talked about but it was the were drunk
[45:27] on a new wine and brother Bram said see
[45:29] what it was he said wine represents the
[45:32] stimulation of Revelation and when the
[45:34] Holy Ghost fell they seen the fire of
[45:36] God fall upon them and it begin to
[45:38] stimulate them and the first thing you
[45:40] know they got so stimulated to the
[45:42] people actually thought that they were
[45:44] drunk he said but what it was is they
[45:46] were stimulated by the Revelation it was
[45:49] by God's word he said it see what it was
[45:52] it was God's Vindicated Revelation that
[45:55] stimulated them it was made PL to them
[45:57] and they were happy about it because God
[45:59] had promised it and now here it was
[46:01] revealed to them it was Vindicated to
[46:03] them remember what Jesus said he said
[46:05] you go over there and you T until the
[46:07] Holy Ghost comes and then you shall
[46:09] receive power they had a promise of God
[46:11] they waited on God to come and perform
[46:13] the promise of God and then all of a
[46:15] sudden here come the Holy Ghost and and
[46:17] the very thing that they had been told
[46:19] about now they were living in the
[46:21] presence of it and it caused them to be
[46:23] stimulated because the word of God had
[46:25] been revealed right before before their
[46:27] very eyes he said that's what they did
[46:30] they saw it and Peter went out and he
[46:31] was preaching this is that that the
[46:33] prophet Joel spoke of he said there it
[46:35] was it was a Vindicated by the same sign
[46:39] that we have today they were stimulated
[46:41] by Revelation you realize that the same
[46:43] holy ghost that they saw that day that
[46:45] stimulated that church is the same holy
[46:47] ghost that still stimulates you and I
[46:49] brother Mark it's the same stimulation
[46:52] and it comes by Revelation he said see
[46:54] it was a revelation that caused them to
[46:56] recognize the Holy Ghost it was a
[46:58] revelation that released the power that
[47:00] was within the Holy Ghost it oh friends
[47:02] I know there's a power in a lot of
[47:04] things there's power in prayer you
[47:05] believe it there's power in the Holy
[47:07] Ghost there's power in our confession I
[47:10] could spend hour speaking on the power
[47:12] that comes from the confession out of a
[47:14] human mouth but a prophet of God said
[47:16] but there ain't nothing of such
[47:17] prevailing power as the revelation of
[47:20] the word of God there ain't no power
[47:22] there's any greater than Revelation it's
[47:24] no wonder he would say pray for
[47:25] revelation than anything else because it
[47:28] ain't just a word that you hear it ain't
[47:30] just something that you're repeating it
[47:32] ain't just something to recite but it's
[47:33] a revelation that would stack the heart
[47:35] of a believer that would cause the power
[47:37] that laid behind it to be able to be
[47:39] spoke out of your mouth and would bring
[47:41] things to pass see promises don't just
[47:44] come from confession but I believe the
[47:46] Bible tells us that the church was built
[47:48] on the confession of the revelation of
[47:51] who Jesus was it wasn't it wasn't just
[47:53] Peter making a confession but he was
[47:54] confession a confessing a revelation
[47:56] ation that he had that's why so many
[47:58] people never grow spiritually because
[48:00] they confess but they never get a
[48:02] revelation of what they're confessing by
[48:04] the whole world is reciting the Bible
[48:06] the whole world is quoting quotes and
[48:09] and reciting things that someone tells
[48:10] them to recite and maybe you could spend
[48:12] hours to you know a good psychologist to
[48:15] give you something to repeat when you
[48:16] get up in the mirror that that'll help
[48:18] you to overcome your your daily
[48:19] struggles but you realize that just a
[48:21] confession will never cause you to
[48:23] overcome see but it took a revelation of
[48:26] what you were confessing see when the
[48:28] Revelation came then the confession had
[48:30] power you see many today they confess
[48:33] but they never see the fruit of their
[48:34] confession you say well why not it's
[48:36] because they don't have the right
[48:37] Revelation see because the fruit of
[48:39] confession can only come by a revelation
[48:43] and when a revelation tracks a heart and
[48:45] you begin to grow in Revelation well
[48:47] then your confession becomes greater
[48:49] when you grow in Revelation suddenly
[48:51] your confession has power and has an
[48:53] authority and you overcome by confession
[48:56] because of the Revelation that you had
[48:59] so see so when a when you take a
[49:01] revealed a revealed word and you confess
[49:03] a word that has been revealed to you no
[49:05] longer is it just a word or just a
[49:07] scripture that you're quoting or
[49:09] confessing but it's a revelation that's
[49:11] in your heart and so when you can speak
[49:13] of something you're speaking out of a
[49:15] revelation and you're speaking by
[49:16] Revelation and then you're confessing
[49:18] something that now has a great power
[49:20] that's that's why we follow the message
[49:22] of the hour because God had sent in the
[49:24] hour that we live in a word Prophet how
[49:26] many knows what a word Prophet does a
[49:28] word Prophet preaches the revelation of
[49:31] the word of God it wasn't just to come
[49:33] many men have stood up in our day and
[49:35] have taken this Bible and they spoke
[49:37] many scriptures and they preached
[49:38] millions and millions and millions of
[49:40] sermons that have been spoken out of
[49:42] this Bible but brother Mark but then God
[49:44] would send the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[49:46] Among Us and the Very purpose of it was
[49:48] to take by Revelation and reveal the
[49:51] word of God to the hearts of the
[49:52] Believers see it wasn't just reciting
[49:54] that would give them power it ain't
[49:56] reing that would take them into a
[49:58] Rapture it ain't reciting it that would
[50:00] give us faith it wasn't just hearing it
[50:02] with our natural ear but hearing with a
[50:04] heart a revealed word of God it would
[50:06] bring power to the church again it's a
[50:09] time of restoration and when that word
[50:11] strikes your heart not just words that
[50:13] you would hear a man speak but when the
[50:15] word a revealed word of God would strike
[50:17] a man's heart then that man can speak to
[50:20] a mountain and the mountain has to move
[50:22] he can speak to a giant and the giant
[50:24] has to fall he can speak to a water and
[50:26] the Waters par he can speak the valleys
[50:29] and they're made plain and they're made
[50:30] level ground why is it because he had a
[50:33] revelation of who he is and and the word
[50:35] of God that applied to him and what he
[50:37] had a right to stand on and the power of
[50:40] God is upon his life yes sir brother
[50:42] Andrew was
[50:43] preaching on Sunday morning about the
[50:46] presence of the pillar of fire I got I
[50:48] got I got in inspired by the by the
[50:51] message that he preached the presence of
[50:52] the pillar of fire you know I think
[50:54] sometimes people misunderstand the
[50:56] attraction that we're following as a
[50:58] people do you realize what it was let me
[51:00] ask you this when Moses went to the
[51:02] Wilderness and he saw the bush that was
[51:04] burning What attracted Moses to the top
[51:06] of the mountain the attraction was the
[51:08] pillar of fire right Moses went up he
[51:10] was attracted because he saw a fire that
[51:13] was burning but didn't consume the bush
[51:15] that it was on see he was attracted by
[51:16] it and you realize that that same Pillar
[51:18] of Fire the Bible tells us is what led
[51:20] the children of Israel out of Egypt when
[51:22] they went out that same pillar they they
[51:24] could have argued with Moses and said he
[51:26] wasn't the man for the job and and well
[51:28] he couldn't talk good enough and he now
[51:30] he wasn't a good enough speaker or good
[51:32] enough good enough leader they they
[51:34] could have they could have came up with
[51:35] all that but you realize that these
[51:37] people had been taught by prophecy that
[51:39] there was coming a time that they'd be
[51:41] delivered out of this place of Egypt
[51:43] they had heard many voices brother Mark
[51:45] Through the Ages they heard the voice of
[51:46] Abraham say that God said they're going
[51:49] to go into this place they heard the
[51:50] voice of Isaac that that that would that
[51:52] would confirm what his father said they
[51:54] heard the voice of Jacob that would say
[51:56] that that that they're going to go into
[51:58] Egypt but they heard the voice of Joseph
[52:00] that said whenever we come out of there
[52:01] take my bones with you cuz we're not
[52:03] going to remain all of those that had
[52:05] gone on before him had spoke of the
[52:07] promise of God that was going to happen
[52:09] and so here when Moses came he was
[52:11] Vindicated by these great signs and
[52:13] wonders and this Supernatural uh that
[52:16] was following his calling and so he came
[52:18] before the people of God and here signs
[52:20] and wonders and works that he done that
[52:23] that were performed that were miraculous
[52:24] great miraculous works and I thought
[52:26] here a after seeing all these great
[52:28] Miracles and seeing the things that
[52:30] Moses had performed with just a just a
[52:32] little Rod that was in his hand and a
[52:34] voice that God was speaking through him
[52:37] but you realize that when they left out
[52:38] of there the Bible says still yet when
[52:40] they left out when they departed and
[52:42] they went on their Journey from suck off
[52:44] the ethem into the edge of the
[52:46] Wilderness you realize that they what
[52:48] what it was that they were following you
[52:49] realize brother Mark when they left out
[52:51] of there they were they went down the
[52:53] worst road that a man could ever go down
[52:55] when they came out of Egypt they went
[52:57] down the worst path that you could take
[52:59] out of Egypt to go to the promised land
[53:01] this is not the path that a man would
[53:03] have would had any sense would lead a
[53:05] group of people down it was the worst
[53:07] path brother Mark it wasn't the easy
[53:09] path it was a a treacherous road it was
[53:11] an undeveloped Wilderness I thought my
[53:13] they they could have went through the
[53:14] land of the Philistines the Bible said
[53:16] it was a much easier path they could
[53:18] have went through the Philistines and
[53:19] you know an ordinary man he would have
[53:21] let him that way he would have took them
[53:23] the place that where they could have
[53:24] water when they needed water he took
[53:26] them to the place where there was plenty
[53:27] of rivers and there there was food
[53:29] supply that they could have a place to
[53:31] get food but he said but God knew that
[53:34] they would have went into that land and
[53:36] God knew they would have seen war and
[53:38] they would have got fear of war and
[53:40] they' have returned back to Egypt out of
[53:42] the fear of a Great War if they went
[53:43] into this land of Philistines you know
[53:45] what God done because God knew what
[53:47] would happen down the road he took them
[53:49] down a harder path I'm going to get
[53:50] somewhere in just a minute but God knew
[53:52] what was going to happen down the road
[53:54] they said wouldn't this be easier would
[53:56] it be easier take the road that's
[53:57] already built there's already ways
[53:59] there's places we can stop after all we
[54:01] had these great Sports and wouldn't this
[54:03] be a a greater way but God knew what was
[54:05] going to happen down the road and God
[54:06] didn't see fit for them to take the easy
[54:08] route God took them on the hard route he
[54:11] took them down a treacherous road he
[54:13] took them through the Wilderness because
[54:14] God knew what would take place I thought
[54:16] my is it something to hear the people
[54:18] when they left out of there the Bible
[54:20] said God LED them through the Wilderness
[54:23] you realize they weren't following after
[54:25] a man they weren't following after a
[54:27] committee they weren't following after
[54:29] an organization they weren't taking a
[54:31] vote and saying this is what we ought to
[54:32] do or maybe this is the direction that
[54:34] that the church needs to go but they
[54:36] were following after God and he led them
[54:38] out in the middle of a Wilderness you me
[54:40] tell you what my Bible said it said that
[54:42] Pillar of Fire by A Cloud by day and a
[54:46] pillar of Fire by night and it never
[54:48] left the children of Israel they
[54:50] followed that Pillar of Fire that Moses
[54:52] saw in the bush and here they went out
[54:54] in the middle of the night and they
[54:55] walked down the they walked through that
[54:57] Wilderness every TR trouble that they
[54:59] came to brother Mah it was the pillar of
[55:00] fire that led them through when they
[55:02] came to the Red Sea the pillar of fire
[55:04] it let them past it when they when they
[55:06] needed water it was the pillar of fire
[55:08] that provided it when they needed some
[55:09] food it was the pillar of fire that
[55:11] provided it for them they followed after
[55:13] the pillar of
[55:14] fire you realize that when they many
[55:17] times through the scripture you see this
[55:19] same thing take place I was reading
[55:22] today about how they went down that they
[55:24] were having a prayer meeting one night
[55:26] at John Mark's house remember Peter he
[55:29] was on his last leg he was he was
[55:31] sitting in a prison cell and he was
[55:33] locked away and the Bible said it was
[55:34] his last night before he was going on
[55:36] trial before King Herod here he would
[55:39] been put to death but they had a prayer
[55:41] Mee and they begin to pray Lord we got a
[55:43] disciple and he's a he he he's a
[55:46] preacher he's Lord he he's serving you
[55:48] and we just asked you that you would
[55:49] help him they you know when they got in
[55:50] trouble look what the people of God
[55:52] always do when they got in trouble
[55:53] brother the Travis they just came
[55:55] together and had a little prayer meeting
[55:56] yeah and the Bible said here while they
[55:58] were sitting there praying here he was
[55:59] about to go on trial I could just see
[56:01] Peter sitting in this place here was a
[56:03] man that was sitting in a jail cell he
[56:05] was chained up between his hands he had
[56:07] he had hand cuffs on his arms shackles
[56:09] that chained him to the ground he had a
[56:11] guard sitting on his right and a guard
[56:13] sitting on his left and just outside the
[56:15] door there was a guard standing on the
[56:16] right and there was a guard standing on
[56:18] the left it was dark in there he was
[56:20] chained up he he had no way to get out
[56:22] of this situation and the Bible says but
[56:25] all of the sudden the angel of the Lord
[56:28] appeared in the jail cell and a light
[56:30] Shone in the room where he was don't you
[56:32] realize friends what it was it was that
[56:34] same Pillar of Fire that came present
[56:37] before Peter the Bible said all of a
[56:39] sudden when the angel came he brother B
[56:41] said what what was it it was the same
[56:42] Pillar of Fire that led the children of
[56:44] Israel out of Egypt and it came right
[56:47] down in a jail cell where Peter was let
[56:49] me tell you what we're following church
[56:51] he he began to speak to him he said wrap
[56:53] your cloak around you Peter and come and
[56:55] follow me my what a word from the pillar
[56:58] of fire wrap your cloak around you and
[57:01] come and follow me I don't know who
[57:03] you're following tonight I don't know
[57:04] what you're following after but I know
[57:06] you better know who it is that that
[57:08] he'll lead you down the right path Peter
[57:11] got up and the Bible says Peter didn't
[57:13] even know what was going on he thought
[57:14] maybe I'm in a vision so you know what
[57:17] I'll just go or in a trance or a dream
[57:19] or something so I'll just go ahead and
[57:20] go on and do it so he got up and the
[57:22] chains fell off of his arms and he
[57:24] looked around and here here the the the
[57:26] guards he woke up and the guards stayed
[57:28] fast asleep I thought isn't that the way
[57:30] it is when the pillar of fire comes
[57:32] sweeping through it wakes up one man the
[57:34] next guy sleep right through it but here
[57:36] but what he done is he be to walk
[57:37] brother Mar out of this place and the
[57:39] Bible said he walked past the one guard
[57:41] then he walked past the next guard then
[57:43] he walked past the next guard and when
[57:45] he came to the gate the gate opened up
[57:47] by itself without a man touching it and
[57:48] he walked down to the end of the road
[57:50] and all of a sudden Peter came to
[57:53] himself and he was standing there as a
[57:56] free man and he said now I know without
[58:00] a doubt that the Lord has sent an angel
[58:02] to rescue me from the clutches of a
[58:05] Herod my isn't that the way it is he
[58:07] said it came right in because of a
[58:08] prayer meeting the power that that that
[58:11] that the pillar of fire because of a
[58:12] prayer meet came right into where Peter
[58:14] was and he led him out of that dark
[58:16] place and put him on a put him on a path
[58:18] brother Mar where he could be free I
[58:20] wonder how many could speak like Peter
[58:22] tonight and say without a doubt I've
[58:24] been I I know that the Lord has sent his
[58:26] Angel and he's rescued me I know without
[58:29] a doubt the angel of the Lord has came
[58:31] in my life when I was Shackled and I had
[58:33] no way out when I was in a dark place
[58:36] and I couldn't find my way when I had
[58:38] guards that were guarding my day of
[58:39] judgment but the pillar of fire came
[58:42] down in the room where I was and the
[58:43] shackles fell off and the guards fell
[58:45] fast asleep and I stood up and walked
[58:48] out every gate opened every doorway was
[58:50] opened
[58:51] up and he came out a free man without a
[58:55] doubt being led by an Angel without a
[58:59] doubt the angel of the Lord has came yes
[59:01] sir and he's led me out of this
[59:03] Condition it's the pillar of fire
[59:06] remember Paul saw him on the road to
[59:08] Damascus here he was walking along but
[59:11] said listen here Saul when he seen him
[59:13] he is a Hebrew and he was well taught in
[59:15] the word notice whenever he saw the
[59:18] pillar of fire watch how he responded he
[59:20] said Lord who art thou is this something
[59:24] he used the word lord said well why he
[59:26] used the word Lord he said because he
[59:28] was well taught in the word and he knew
[59:30] it was the Lord he knew it was only
[59:33] explanation it could be when the
[59:34] presence of Pillar of Fire that it had
[59:36] to be the Lord he said because he was
[59:38] well taught in the
[59:40] word I thought here he recognized the
[59:43] pillar of fire because he was well
[59:45] taught in the
[59:46] word he recognized God because he was
[59:50] well taught think of it he was well
[59:52] taught he was a Hebrew I thought that's
[59:55] the way we need to be be tonight we need
[59:57] to be well taught we need to be taught
[1:00:00] like the Samaritan woman brother Mark
[1:00:02] she was well taught in the word she said
[1:00:04] she sat there that day and she GL makes
[1:00:06] me want to preach she sat there on the
[1:00:07] side of a well and here because of her
[1:00:09] life and because of the things that she
[1:00:11] knew about the age that she lived in
[1:00:13] here she had had such a wrecked up life
[1:00:15] here she had five husbands and and and
[1:00:18] the one she was with wasn't her own and
[1:00:20] here she sat there and Jesus began to
[1:00:22] speak to her about her life but because
[1:00:24] she was a well-taught woman notice what
[1:00:26] she said she saw one she she knew what
[1:00:28] the sign of the Messiah was so he began
[1:00:30] to speak to her about her life and she
[1:00:32] said isn't this the sign of the Messiah
[1:00:35] you realize what was taking place
[1:00:37] because she was well taught she
[1:00:39] recognized the Messiah whenever he came
[1:00:41] her way it wasn't she wasn't just some
[1:00:43] regular woman brother Mark she was well
[1:00:45] taught and let me tell you what happened
[1:00:47] because she was well taught then she got
[1:00:49] well taught because she was well taught
[1:00:51] in in the word in her history she sat by
[1:00:53] the wellside and she got a a new lesson
[1:00:56] she she had a lesson from Jesus Christ
[1:00:58] that said I am he that speaks unto thee
[1:01:01] oh she been when the Messiah comes he
[1:01:04] would discern when the Messiah comes he
[1:01:05] would do these things he said well I am
[1:01:07] he that speaks unto thee Oh don't you
[1:01:10] that's what we really need tonight we
[1:01:11] need a trip to the well and to be well
[1:01:13] taught we need to listen at The Well of
[1:01:15] God to recognize the presence of God
[1:01:18] when he's here she had a well experience
[1:01:20] brother Mark she was well taught you
[1:01:22] know not only do we need to know the
[1:01:24] scripture or the prophecies conc
[1:01:25] concerning the age but what we really
[1:01:27] need tonight is we need a trip to the
[1:01:29] well we need to go to the place to be
[1:01:31] able to find Jesus that that's what Mary
[1:01:33] did that day when she went down and she
[1:01:36] was here just an ordinary girl 16 18
[1:01:38] years old brother Mark she was on her
[1:01:40] way to the well and all of a sudden she
[1:01:43] met the angel of the Lord that's the
[1:01:45] trip that we need to make tonight
[1:01:47] brother M said she went there he said
[1:01:49] she was engaged to a man she was an
[1:01:50] ordinary girl she loved God she believed
[1:01:53] in God but one day on her way to the the
[1:01:56] well to get some water she met God isn't
[1:01:59] that good she loved God she believed in
[1:02:01] God but one day on the way to the well
[1:02:04] to get some water she met
[1:02:08] God on the way to the well to get some
[1:02:10] water she met God and from that time the
[1:02:14] world has held her blessed art thou
[1:02:17] among women on the way to the well to

[1:02:23] well brother Mark her future changed
[1:02:26] yeah on the trip to the well her life
[1:02:29] suddenly had meaning I'm preaching to

[1:05:16] to your what happened to all that
[1:05:17] unbelief you used to have but you can
[1:05:19] look back at him and say I left it at

[1:05:40] at the well what happened to that
[1:05:41] adulterous Spirit you used to carry but
[1:05:43] but I left it at the well what happened
[1:05:46] what happened you used to smoke and and
[1:05:47] drink and and be so much fun to hang out
[1:05:49] with what happened to all those things I
[1:05:51] left it at the well used to have a bad
[1:05:54] temper I left it at the well used to
[1:05:58] tell everybody off but I left it at the
[1:05:59] well ain't that the way it is she went
[1:06:02] to a place and she left her old life she
[1:06:04] broke it my she just threw it down on
[1:06:06] the ground I thought my that old thing
[1:06:08] must have shattered into a million
[1:06:09] pieces I in my in my mind when I see
[1:06:12] that image it just turned into dust it
[1:06:14] just broke into all kinds of chars that
[1:06:17] it couldn't even be put back together
[1:06:18] why cuz it was a symbol of her throwing
[1:06:20] away her old life and and knowing that
[1:06:23] she didn't have to go draw for any more
[1:06:25] water had found something that would
[1:06:26] quench her thirst she was taught by the
[1:06:29] side of the well oh my she had a
[1:06:31] well-taught experience brother Mah with
[1:06:33] Jesus Christ that's what we need when
[1:06:35] she met him her thirst was quenched
[1:06:37] quenched by a man that was setting out a
[1:06:39] well she was well taught amen see
[1:06:42] brother B said see I see a lot of people
[1:06:44] today they have a Victorious Life
[1:06:47] they're always living constantly on a
[1:06:49] housetop and they're praising God how
[1:06:50] many knows people like that seems like
[1:06:52] they're always on fire for God and when
[1:06:54] you look at those people you say well I
[1:06:56] wish I could feel that way he said the
[1:06:58] reason you feel like that is because
[1:07:00] there's a thirst in you and it's a
[1:07:02] natural thing for every person to thirst
[1:07:04] for
[1:07:05] God now isn't that something it's a
[1:07:07] natural thing to have a spiritual thirst
[1:07:09] that's a common thing for you to have a
[1:07:12] spiritual thirst it's a common thing
[1:07:14] it's a it's something that every body
[1:07:16] every that something that we have
[1:07:18] there's a thirst for God I you know you
[1:07:20] realize that in the Natural Body our
[1:07:21] Natural Body thirst for water and here
[1:07:23] you realize that what that thirst is
[1:07:25] brother Mark that thirst is a is an
[1:07:27] alarm it's a sign he says see it's an
[1:07:29] alarm clock that goes off and it the
[1:07:31] soul sets off an alarm it's a buzzer
[1:07:33] inside of you that tells you that death
[1:07:34] is lurking that if you don't get water
[1:07:36] pretty soon that you're going to die and
[1:07:38] it'll get louder and louder until
[1:07:40] finally you'll keep putting it off and
[1:07:42] if you keep putting it off then you're
[1:07:43] going to physically die that's why God
[1:07:46] gave you that how many how many knows
[1:07:48] what it's like to be thirsty and that's
[1:07:50] why God gave you that that ability to
[1:07:52] thirst and and and and the longer you go
[1:07:54] without water The Thirst gets greater
[1:07:56] and greater it's an internal alarm that
[1:07:58] tells you that your body needs water but
[1:08:01] if that's that way in the natural you
[1:08:03] think about it here here that that
[1:08:04] that's what was taking place in in the
[1:08:07] Bible in the story of Hagar here she had
[1:08:10] gone into this into into this Wilderness
[1:08:12] you realized that Hagar brother Mark
[1:08:14] that she had never she didn't do
[1:08:16] anything wrong she hadn't made it wasn't
[1:08:18] a mistake that she made that put her in
[1:08:20] that place here she was in the line of
[1:08:22] duty she done what was asked of her by
[1:08:24] by by by her her own Master she was a
[1:08:26] servant she done everything that they
[1:08:28] asked her to do here she had a child
[1:08:30] with Abraham she raised the child up the
[1:08:33] child had been the raised the the way
[1:08:35] that that he was supposed to be raised
[1:08:37] but whenever the promise of God had took
[1:08:39] place in Sarah's life the Bible says
[1:08:41] that Sarah saw the children together and
[1:08:43] something happened in her heart that she
[1:08:45] wanted them to be separated here he was
[1:08:46] mocking and making fun and she went to
[1:08:48] Abraham and said you need to get rid of
[1:08:50] her and and send her out into the
[1:08:51] Wilderness and I don't want her son to
[1:08:53] have anything to do with mine the Bible
[1:08:56] says Abraham went to the Lord and God
[1:08:58] told Abraham obey the what your wife the
[1:09:01] desires of your wife he said because I
[1:09:03] won't let him die out there in the
[1:09:04] wilderness but I'll allow him to be a
[1:09:06] great nation but he can't be with Isaac
[1:09:09] because or or because he he would be a a
[1:09:12] promised son so so they're going to be
[1:09:14] separated but he'll still yet be a great
[1:09:16] nation so the Bible says Abraham goes he
[1:09:18] rises up and he gives bread and a bottle
[1:09:21] of water to Hagar and he sent her and
[1:09:24] the child away and they departed out and
[1:09:26] wandered Into the Wilderness so here
[1:09:28] they come into beerseba brother Mark in
[1:09:31] this hot Wilderness here the the the
[1:09:33] Desert Sun that was beaten down upon
[1:09:36] their flesh and they had the bottle of
[1:09:38] water here she was trying to make her
[1:09:40] way did not know where she was going
[1:09:41] wandering around out in this place and
[1:09:44] after a little while the water that she
[1:09:46] carried ran
[1:09:48] out and the water was spent you realize
[1:09:51] that what took place is after she got to
[1:09:53] this place of thirst and she realized I
[1:09:56] imagine as a mother she looked around
[1:09:57] for water the first few hours without
[1:10:00] water you you go around looking for a
[1:10:02] place that I can find water is there a
[1:10:03] cactus somewhere is there a shade tree
[1:10:06] somewhere that there's a little bit of
[1:10:07] water is there's something somewhere I
[1:10:09] can find and she had searched out until
[1:10:11] she found that there was nothing else
[1:10:13] that she could use to quench her thirst
[1:10:15] all that she had was spent she had
[1:10:18] looked all that she could look until
[1:10:19] they were weary and weak and had nowhere
[1:10:21] else to go and she finally took her son
[1:10:24] and she put him over in one place and
[1:10:27] went went went over into another place
[1:10:29] she said because I can't bear the
[1:10:30] thought of watching my son lay there and
[1:10:32] thirst to death and as she went over the
[1:10:36] only thing left in her her alarm clock
[1:10:38] had long since gone off in the natural
[1:10:40] it had long since gone past its time uh
[1:10:43] that that you're that you're going to
[1:10:44] die if you don't find water and I can
[1:10:46] imagine her here she was a woman that
[1:10:48] was so she she had been misjudged and
[1:10:51] and misunderstood and she was cast out
[1:10:53] though she had done nothing wrong she
[1:10:54] had no place to go here her and her
[1:10:56] child they were perishing in this place
[1:10:58] I could imagine the heart of this mother
[1:11:00] as she begin to cry out to God and say
[1:11:02] why am I in this kind of condition what
[1:11:06] have I done to deserve this what what
[1:11:08] have I done to to get into this place
[1:11:10] you know you realize that that if she
[1:11:12] that everything that she done it was
[1:11:14] right then why would she come to this
[1:11:16] place if she had obeyed the Lord why
[1:11:18] would she be in this Wilderness without
[1:11:20] any water if I if I done what you asked
[1:11:22] can you imagine the the the request that
[1:11:24] she had when she called out to God I've
[1:11:26] done everything you asked me to do I've
[1:11:28] served every way that I could serve I
[1:11:30] can't think of a time that I that I that
[1:11:32] I went the the wrong way or I wasn't
[1:11:34] obedient I done all that I could do but
[1:11:36] still yet I found myself hiding under a
[1:11:39] bush thirsting for water my son hiding
[1:11:43] over thirsting for water crying out I
[1:11:46] think that's the way it is many times we
[1:11:48] look at our situation we look at our
[1:11:50] sicknesses and and and afflictions and
[1:11:52] things that come upon us and say why
[1:11:54] what have I done that would cause this
[1:11:55] to come upon my life what would I what
[1:11:58] have I done to cause me to get into this
[1:12:00] place and this place of thirst in this
[1:12:02] place of this Wilderness type place what
[1:12:04] have I done to cause me to be dragged
[1:12:06] into this
[1:12:07] place brother said maybe it wasn't
[1:12:10] something that that we done at all but
[1:12:11] maybe it was all done just so God could
[1:12:13] show his grace and his Mercy to you that
[1:12:17] he could bring you to a crying out place
[1:12:19] a place that you didn't have no choice
[1:12:22] but just to trust in God that God could
[1:12:24] bring bring you to a place you realize
[1:12:27] as human beings we want to control
[1:12:29] everything but sometimes God brings you
[1:12:31] to a place that you have no
[1:12:34] control because when you have no control
[1:12:36] you can't do nothing but cry out to God
[1:12:39] so here he had brought her to this
[1:12:41] crying out place but the mark in here
[1:12:43] she could hear I could just hear it as
[1:12:45] her hearing over her child here he was
[1:12:47] crying and crying and crying for water
[1:12:50] after a little while his little voice
[1:12:52] was so parched and lips parched so dry C
[1:12:56] they couldn't even cry and it became a a
[1:12:58] cracked faint of a cry that she heard
[1:13:00] until eventually The Cry of the lad had
[1:13:04] completely faded away can you imagine
[1:13:06] sitting in this place and all that that
[1:13:09] she just gone through and then as it be
[1:13:11] to fade there wasn't hardly a sound
[1:13:15] left and the Bible says but then all of
[1:13:18] the sudden she heard the voice of an
[1:13:23] angel my she went from hearing the Cry
[1:13:26] of her child to hearing the voice of an
[1:13:29] Angel and he said Hagar what is ailing
[1:13:32] you why are you
[1:13:34] weeping for we have heard the voice of
[1:13:38] the lad where he is here brother Mark
[1:13:41] she looked at her condition it was
[1:13:43] hopeless but God said but I've heard the
[1:13:45] Cry of your
[1:13:47] children I've heard the Cry of your
[1:13:51] child and I know you're in this
[1:13:53] condition that you can't get out of I
[1:13:55] know you're in this place that you don't
[1:13:57] have no answer for and you don't know
[1:13:59] what it was or where you gone wrong in
[1:14:01] your life you didn't do nothing but
[1:14:02] serve and you done everything that was
[1:14:04] asked of you you was a good wife you was
[1:14:06] a good servant you you brought for
[1:14:08] children you done all that you was asked
[1:14:09] to do but you found yourself in this
[1:14:12] place and God has heard the Cry of your
[1:14:16] child he knows the needs of your child
[1:14:20] you believe God knows that tonight he
[1:14:22] knows the need of your child he said so
[1:14:25] arise and take the lad and hold him in
[1:14:28] thy hand and I will make him a great
[1:14:31] nation what a promise here when she
[1:14:33] thought all hope was lost her family was
[1:14:36] lost her children were lost had nothing
[1:14:38] else to turn to nowhere to turn but then
[1:14:40] the angel of the Lord he said you hold
[1:14:42] your child in your hand for I will make
[1:14:44] of him a great nation here he was
[1:14:46] confirming the very promise that God had
[1:14:49] given unto Father Abraham but then watch
[1:14:51] what happened brother Mark he didn't
[1:14:53] just leave it in the natural but but but
[1:14:55] all of a sudden the supernatural begin
[1:14:57] to take place in her life the Bible says
[1:14:59] and God opened up her eyes and she saw a
[1:15:03] well of water and she went and filled
[1:15:06] the bottle with water and she gave the
[1:15:08] lad something to drink oh my it is
[1:15:11] something that here in the middle of a
[1:15:12] desert that God would provide a well of
[1:15:15] water but Mark here she was the entire
[1:15:17] time and the well was there she just
[1:15:20] couldn't see it the very thing she had
[1:15:21] need of it was laying right before but
[1:15:24] she couldn't see and many days and hours
[1:15:26] had gone by that she cried out to God
[1:15:29] and the answer was laying right before
[1:15:31] her but then the angel of the Lord came
[1:15:35] and when God opened her eyes she saw a
[1:15:38] well of water my isn't there something
[1:15:40] that the well it was there brother KY
[1:15:43] even when you can't see it with your
[1:15:44] natural eye but let me tell you
[1:15:45] something friends just because you can't
[1:15:47] see something with your natural eye it
[1:15:49] don't mean that it isn't there I believe
[1:15:51] that God directed her path I believe
[1:15:53] that God led her to that place in the
[1:15:55] wilderness why because God had placed a
[1:15:57] well there that she would sit right
[1:15:59] under that very Bush when she was
[1:16:01] wandering around and taking those
[1:16:02] misguided footsteps and searching around
[1:16:04] for water and completely lost and didn't
[1:16:07] know where to go but God was leading her
[1:16:09] to The Well of
[1:16:12] water a woman in a line of duty
[1:16:15] thirsting for something that she didn't
[1:16:17] even know was
[1:16:19] there all of a sudden her eyes were open
[1:16:22] and she saw the well you know what she
[1:16:25] would call that well later it would be
[1:16:28] called beer laar Roy which means The
[1:16:32] Well of him that liveth and seeth me now
[1:16:36] what a name of a well that had provided
[1:16:39] salvation for the mark whenever all hope
[1:16:41] was lost I thought what a powerful
[1:16:43] Revelation she had in her greatest time
[1:16:46] of need that God opened her eyes to a
[1:16:49] well that would satisfy her thirst and
[1:16:52] he revealed to her that God was still
[1:16:55] alive in her greatest time of need look
[1:16:58] what God is showing her by by by her own
[1:17:01] confession by naming this well The Well
[1:17:03] of him that liveth and seeth me but I'm
[1:17:05] actually showing you what a revelation
[1:17:07] was that God came in my time of need and
[1:17:10] he revealed himself to me that he is
[1:17:12] still a God and he's still alive and not
[1:17:16] only is he a living God but he saw me in
[1:17:18] my condition he saw my child he saw the
[1:17:21] needs of my family he saw me when I was
[1:17:23] laying under the bush and I had no way
[1:17:25] out he saw our bottle it was Spin and we
[1:17:28] were a thirst and dying in that place
[1:17:31] not only is he a living God but he's a
[1:17:34] God that sees me amen what a revelation
[1:17:37] to have to reveal unto her I live and I
[1:17:41] see you friend how makes me want to
[1:17:43] shout all over this building he's a God
[1:17:45] that liveth and he's a God that sees you
[1:17:48] right he's a God that knows the very
[1:17:50] challenges that you face and the things
[1:17:52] that go on in your heart and in your
[1:17:54] mind in the middle of the night when you
[1:17:56] want to give up and throw up your hands
[1:17:57] and say I can't go another mile but he's
[1:18:00] a God that liveth and seeth me amen I
[1:18:03] wonder how many tonight that thirst for
[1:18:06] something that they just can't seem to
[1:18:11] find thirsting for a closer walk with
[1:18:14] God or thirsting to hear the voice of
[1:18:17] God or to see the supernatural or to see
[1:18:21] can I just be real with you to see past
[1:18:23] the bush that I've been laying under to
[1:18:26] see past this Wilderness and this this
[1:18:29] place that I that I've hid I I've been
[1:18:31] wandering alone in this Wilderness
[1:18:33] thirsting for a way out thirsting for
[1:18:36] something that you just can't
[1:18:38] find just not a natural thirst for the
[1:18:41] cow it's a spiritual
[1:18:43] thirst David said as a deer panth after
[1:18:45] the water Brooks so my soul longth after
[1:18:50] thee say see he's longing to have a life
[1:18:53] of victory
[1:18:55] longing to overcome that's where we are
[1:18:58] longing to be victorious longing to be
[1:19:01] able to be a a real believer and to get
[1:19:04] through this this life the the hard
[1:19:06] pressures of this life he said a man
[1:19:09] never knows what it is to live a
[1:19:11] Victorious life until he's completely
[1:19:13] overcome
[1:19:14] himself you see we got to get to a place
[1:19:17] to get past this big enemy that's
[1:19:19] getting in our way to keep us from
[1:19:21] seeing the things of God brother Jared
[1:19:23] we have a great big enemy it's this
[1:19:25] flesh we have a great big enemy it's the
[1:19:27] worst enemy we how many believes that
[1:19:29] the worst enemy you have is you when you
[1:19:31] you know why you can't do nothing for
[1:19:32] God because of you you know why you
[1:19:34] can't ever get nowhere because of you
[1:19:36] you know why you can't grow because of
[1:19:37] you it ain't nobody it's because of us
[1:19:40] we're the worst enemy that we have said
[1:19:42] the biggest enemy you have is yourself
[1:19:44] that's why you can't rise up in faith
[1:19:45] because you're the reason that you can't
[1:19:47] overcome there's an intellectual part of
[1:19:50] you brother Mark that stops you from
[1:19:51] receiving the things of God there's an
[1:19:53] intellectual part that stop stops us
[1:19:55] from being Believers and it stops us
[1:19:56] from overcoming it reminds me I know I
[1:19:59] run out of time but it reminds me of
[1:20:00] that that man in India that came up for
[1:20:02] prayer that was blind and here he come
[1:20:04] up in that prayer line I remember
[1:20:05] whenever they they brought him up to the
[1:20:07] prayer line I wanted to hide behind the
[1:20:08] pull pit cuz what could a natural man do
[1:20:11] to help a man that was blind in his
[1:20:13] natural eyes there was nothing I could
[1:20:14] say there was nothing I could do there
[1:20:16] was nothing I could quote there was I
[1:20:19] had no ability to give him back his
[1:20:20] eyesight and they said the the the the
[1:20:23] man that brought him had heard in the
[1:20:25] preaching of the word that God was a God
[1:20:27] that could do the impossible and God was
[1:20:29] a God that could open blinded eyes and
[1:20:31] God was a God that could part Waters and
[1:20:33] two million people walk across he was a
[1:20:36] God that could do the Supernatural and
[1:20:38] he wasn't dead but he was still alive
[1:20:41] the man got up and he walked out of the
[1:20:42] meeting and he went down the street and
[1:20:44] he found his old buddy that was a blind
[1:20:46] man and he brought him back into the
[1:20:47] house of God because he believed that
[1:20:49] God was a God that could do the
[1:20:52] supernatural you know what I did brother
[1:20:55] Mark after I got out from hiding behind
[1:20:56] the pull pit I thought the only thing I
[1:20:58] knew to do is to tell him what Jesus had
[1:21:00] already done and I started telling
[1:21:02] testimonies of every man I could ever
[1:21:04] think of that Jesus had laid hands on
[1:21:06] that had received their eyesight I told
[1:21:08] him about the one where he took the mud
[1:21:11] and he made it into an eyeball and he
[1:21:12] put it in his socket I told him about
[1:21:14] how he sent the man to the pool of salom
[1:21:17] and told him you go wash and when you
[1:21:18] wash you'll come see it and then I told
[1:21:20] him about how that same Jesus came right
[1:21:23] down in the town that I was borned in
[1:21:25] and gave a little girl her eyes side
[1:21:27] back through the voice of a prophet of
[1:21:28] God and how that I heard that testimony
[1:21:31] my whole life and then I asked him this
[1:21:34] question I said do you do you know
[1:21:37] Jesus he said I've heard of him but I've
[1:21:40] never met him yeah I thought what an
[1:21:42] answer I've heard about him but I've
[1:21:44] never met him I said well friend let me
[1:21:46] introduce you to him cuz that same Jesus
[1:21:50] that healed them is standing here right
[1:21:52] now and he can still heal you
[1:21:55] do you believe that he raised up his
[1:21:57] hand I said do you will you you will you
[1:21:59] serve a God that could open your eyes he
[1:22:01] said yes I will and he sat there and I
[1:22:04] prayed for him brother Mark the brothers
[1:22:06] come and prayed with him and he left out
[1:22:08] of that meeting I thought I'll never
[1:22:09] hear nothing about him never see nothing
[1:22:12] about him no more because there's so
[1:22:13] many you go from meeting to meeting but
[1:22:15] that night we were having another
[1:22:18] service and here in the middle of that
[1:22:20] service I watched that man walk in that
[1:22:23] building he was wasn't being led by
[1:22:25] nobody there wasn't nobody leading him
[1:22:27] through the crowd brother Mark I noticed
[1:22:30] he was watching so closely to the ground
[1:22:32] and he came up to some wires that were
[1:22:33] laying there going across the speakers
[1:22:35] and I watched I I I I turn I cut loose
[1:22:39] when I watched that man come up to those
[1:22:40] speaker wires and step his foot over the
[1:22:43] top of them wires I thought my god there
[1:22:45] was a trip haiser laying in the floor
[1:22:47] that that would show that something had
[1:22:49] taken place in his life here he he could
[1:22:52] faintly a little bit see just enough he
[1:22:55] come through there and you know in his
[1:22:56] arm I've got a picture of it in in his
[1:22:58] arm he had his little wife in one arm
[1:23:01] and then on the other side of her with
[1:23:02] his mother-in-law he came all the way to
[1:23:04] the front of the building interrupted
[1:23:05] the whole service and the brother I said
[1:23:07] oh y'all let him let him alone I came
[1:23:09] down there sir can I help you he said
[1:23:11] well my wife and my mama they want to
[1:23:13] serve him too I thought my God what a
[1:23:16] testimony that's the same thing that
[1:23:18] happened on the side of the well that
[1:23:20] day she went away with a testimony and
[1:23:22] they believed on him because of her
[1:23:25] testimony later on I got an email from
[1:23:27] the pastor he said that man his eyesight
[1:23:30] is perfectly well it took a few weeks
[1:23:32] and few months had gone by until it
[1:23:34] developed where he could he could see
[1:23:36] just like anybody else I remember that
[1:23:38] man's testimony he said he wanted to
[1:23:40] tell you this and I was already gone but
[1:23:43] whenever he stood there that day and I
[1:23:44] asked him I told him that Jesus was
[1:23:47] standing there and he could do the same
[1:23:48] thing for him that he had done for those
[1:23:50] other people that blind man that didn't
[1:23:53] know anything about Jesus Jesus had
[1:23:55] barely ever heard the name of Jesus in
[1:23:57] his life didn't know where he come from
[1:23:59] or couldn't tell you one thing about him
[1:24:01] but that blind man when I said he's
[1:24:03] standing here and he can do the same
[1:24:05] thing for you he done for them that
[1:24:07] blind man thought he was standing
[1:24:10] there and we couldn't see him because we
[1:24:12] are looking through a natural eye but
[1:24:15] that man had no natural sight so when I
[1:24:17] said he's standing here he thought that
[1:24:19] man was standing there that I was
[1:24:21] telling him about he thought that man
[1:24:23] laid hands upon him that I was telling
[1:24:25] him about he felt the same hand that put
[1:24:27] the eye in the socket of the man down
[1:24:30] there by the river in Galilee it was a
[1:24:32] same
[1:24:33] Jesus because he had no natural
[1:24:36] sight to keep him from receiving the
[1:24:38] promise of God my is't that something
[1:24:41] here it was something that he couldn't
[1:24:44] see see we we have to get out of our own
[1:24:46] way but Mark sometimes we're the worst
[1:24:49] enemy that we have I can't see God so
[1:24:52] God must not be there I can't see the
[1:24:54] pillar of fire it must not be present I
[1:24:56] can't see the supernatural there must
[1:24:58] not be no Supernatural it ain't got
[1:25:00] nothing to do with our natural sight see
[1:25:03] see if we could get out of our own way
[1:25:05] we might could receive something from
[1:25:06] the Lord the Bible says trust in the
[1:25:09] Lord with all thy heart and lead not
[1:25:11] unto thy own understanding see once you
[1:25:14] overcome your flesh your spirit your
[1:25:17] feelings your emotions then you'll have
[1:25:19] a life of
[1:25:21] Victory you want to be free you have to
[1:25:23] overcome you your feelings all this old
[1:25:26] leading that you had this is what
[1:25:27] happened to that Samaritan woman she was
[1:25:30] taught in the scripture she knew the
[1:25:32] coming of a messiah she believed that it
[1:25:34] would happen in her day enough that she
[1:25:36] could receive it whenever he came and
[1:25:38] you realize all it took was one little
[1:25:40] Messiah sign of him saying he said are
[1:25:43] you go get your husband she said I have
[1:25:46] no husband he said you've spoken true
[1:25:49] because you've had five husbands and the
[1:25:51] one that you're with now is not your own
[1:25:54] and because of that sign of discernment
[1:25:56] she recognized it as the Messiah she see
[1:25:59] so when she knew the promise she knew
[1:26:00] what the Messiah would be and when she
[1:26:02] seen the promise fulfilled but ra said
[1:26:04] it opened her eyes when she saw the
[1:26:07] promise fulfilled her eyes came open
[1:26:09] said see before that her eyes had been
[1:26:11] closed with sin but she saw the promise
[1:26:14] of God fulfilled in her day and it
[1:26:16] opened her eyes he says see when she saw
[1:26:18] the Messiah he would come when he do
[1:26:20] those things or he'll do those things he
[1:26:21] said I am he her eyes were open and she
[1:26:24] has eternal life now because her eyes
[1:26:27] were open then she sat on the side of
[1:26:30] the well and her eyes opened up to a
[1:26:33] revelation of Jesus Christ she knew the
[1:26:36] prophecy she knew the scripture of the
[1:26:38] Messiah but on the side of a well her
[1:26:40] eyes were open to a reality that Jesus
[1:26:43] Christ was in her midst so many that we
[1:26:46] could go through tonight I don't have
[1:26:47] time that eyes were open whenever they
[1:26:49] met him philli his eyes was open the
[1:26:51] disciples Peter's nathaniels their eyes
[1:26:53] were open but said but what has it done
[1:26:55] to our eyes in this day a promise
[1:26:58] fulfilled has it opened your eyes you
[1:27:01] realize the word of the scriptures
[1:27:03] that's been fulfilled in the day we live
[1:27:05] in John 14:12 he said verily I say unto
[1:27:08] you as the music players come I say unto
[1:27:09] you that he believeth on me the works
[1:27:11] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:27:13] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:27:15] go unto my father that scripture has
[1:27:17] been Vindicated in the day that we live
[1:27:19] in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same
[1:27:23] yesterday today and for ever how many
[1:27:24] believe that's been proven in this day I
[1:27:27] said how many believe that's been proven
[1:27:28] in this day he's the same yesterday
[1:27:30] today and forever Luke 17 said as it was
[1:27:33] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[1:27:35] the days of the coming of the son of man
[1:27:37] how many believe that we're living in
[1:27:38] that day amen it's been manifested in
[1:27:41] this age Malachi 4 said behold I will
[1:27:43] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:27:45] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[1:27:47] the Lord how many believe what we're
[1:27:48] living in that day all of those
[1:27:51] scriptures brother Mark that's been
[1:27:52] fulfilled right before us and then watch
[1:27:55] here's the
[1:27:56] question that's all been fulfilled but
[1:28:00] what has it done to our
[1:28:02] eyes You' seen the promises of
[1:28:05] God has it opened your eyes to see a
[1:28:08] revelation of Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ a true reality of who it is that
[1:28:13] you're following
[1:28:15] after not a organization or man
[1:28:19] or a church but to follow after Jesus
[1:28:24] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost but a Mark
[1:28:27] that would come in our midst to this age
[1:28:29] say see when you see the works of God
[1:28:32] you recognize it how many say this today
[1:28:34] you recognized it as a sign of the
[1:28:37] Messiah alive
[1:28:39] today do you realize that that same
[1:28:41] Jesus is still alive same God he's still
[1:28:44] The Works that same well is present
[1:28:47] before us
[1:28:48] tonight beer
[1:28:50] lroy it's
[1:28:52] present the god that liveth
[1:28:54] and seeth
[1:28:56] me he said see after seeing these things
[1:29:01] if it doesn't open your eyes it'll blind
[1:29:03] them
[1:29:04] eternally cuz it opens some and it
[1:29:06] blinds others isn't that the Bible
[1:29:09] remember when Jesus went and he went up
[1:29:10] braid in the cities because they had
[1:29:12] seen the mighty works of God and he said
[1:29:14] great will be the Judgment that comes
[1:29:16] upon you because the works that have
[1:29:17] been done in your city if the works that
[1:29:20] had been done in capernium were done in
[1:29:22] Sodom Sodom would still be here today
[1:29:25] because they would never went into that
[1:29:27] he said you're worse off than they were
[1:29:29] cuz you've seen the mighty works of God
[1:29:31] but still yet you sin listen what Jesus
[1:29:33] is showing us that sin and unbelief is
[1:29:35] one thing but sin and unbelief after
[1:29:38] seeing the works of God is another
[1:29:40] thing sin is one thing but sin after
[1:29:43] seeing the works of God is a far another
[1:29:45] thing he said God judgment shall be more
[1:29:48] tolerable to Sodom in the day of
[1:29:50] judgment than for thee because they
[1:29:52] didn't see the works of God Like You
[1:29:54] you've seen he said but I thank thee Oh
[1:29:57] Lord because you have hid these things
[1:29:59] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:30:01] and revealed them unto babes I say may
[1:30:04] God give us Grace tonight that we
[1:30:07] respond to the word that we
[1:30:09] hear that he would give us Grace to
[1:30:11] receive the the revelation of the word
