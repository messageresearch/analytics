[21:26] been here in the meeting and I know I've
[21:29] seen many lives and situations that that
[21:32] I personally knew about that God came
[21:34] and moved in a supernatural way I thank
[21:37] God for it I can Testify the Lord's done
[21:40] something for you
[21:42] already had a sister left last night and
[21:45] she was she said I'm I'm almost 7 years
[21:48] old and she said my whole life I wanted
[21:51] to go to a tent meeting and she said I
[21:53] thought I missed all those days and I
[21:55] never got opportunity to do it she said
[21:58] I I've seen youall have one I just want
[22:00] you to know it was a
[22:01] blessing again back next
[22:04] year God he would provide a place that
[22:07] we could just come and have a time with
[22:09] the Lord you know there there there's
[22:13] just a it's a famine in the land is it
[22:15] but here we are a people that have
[22:17] plenty to feed on brother do was talking
[22:20] about it before church he said you know
[22:22] it's just wonderful to have something to
[22:23] feed on every day he said I was talking
[22:25] about it and how it is that that you
[22:27] draw straight from it and one day we'll
[22:29] take our last bite and we'll go right
[22:30] into the Rapture come last night and
[22:33] preach the very thing I said isn't it
[22:35] wonderful that we had something to feed
[22:37] on just uh there been a tremendous
[22:39] meeting and last year was a tremendous
[22:42] meeting sister C had shared with us
[22:44] yesterday it was a one year she said it
[22:47] was one year ago today that I came into
[22:49] this same meeting and had the brothers

[23:13] and and let their faith get to a place
[23:15] that God can work you'll see things you
[23:17] may never saw he's a supernatural God I
[23:20] just really appreciate you your efforts
[23:23] and the sacrifice that you made our home

[23:27] I know that I know it's been a lot of
[23:29] work and I just want to say thank to you
[23:31] each one of you for there's so many that

[32:14] we're going to go to the Book of Psalms
[32:15] 102 want to say what an honor it is to
[32:18] be here today with you in these series
[32:21] of meetings this week we've just had
[32:22] such a wonderful time in the presence of
[32:24] the Lord and I'm just believe the Lord
[32:26] spoke to us this week you believe that
[32:30] we certainly appreciate our brother Matt
[32:31] for allowing us to be able to come be a
[32:33] part of your your meeting this week we
[32:36] always appreciated him being a part of
[32:39] us our meetings that we have rather and
[32:41] those of you that come and support us we
[32:43] want to say how much we appreciate that
[32:45] and we love you with all of our hearts
[32:47] Psalms 102 we want to look at Verse 18
[32:51] now I know the brothers has preached all
[32:53] through this this week but that's all
[32:55] right you're going to hear it again
[32:56] today amen amen Psalms
[32:59] 102:18 this shall be written for the
[33:01] generation to come and the people which
[33:04] shall be created shall praise the Lord
[33:06] you believe you're one of them today for
[33:08] he had looked down from the high of his
[33:11] Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord
[33:13] behold the Earth to hear the groaning of
[33:16] the prisoner and to loose those that are
[33:20] appointed to death now I want to go to
[33:23] the Book of Romans chapter 5 if you'll
[33:25] turn to the New Testament Romans chapter
[33:27] 5 we're going to look at verse 12 and
[33:30] then we're going to go to chapter 7 just
[33:32] real quick Romans
[33:34] 5:12 wherefore as by one man sin entered
[33:38] into the world and death by sin and so
[33:42] death passed upon all men for that all
[33:46] everybody say all for all have sinned
[33:50] Romans chap 7: 23 we know that the book
[33:54] of Romans is one of the most debated
[33:56] scriptures in all the Bible because they
[33:59] say that Paul was unconverted whenever
[34:01] he wrote this but we don't believe that
[34:04] cuz we don't believe that God will allow
[34:05] any man that's unconverted to be able to
[34:08] preach and read actually write something
[34:10] that'll convert men Romans chapter 7: 23
[34:14] and I see another law in my members
[34:17] Waring against the law of my mind
[34:19] anybody ever had that war it's Waring
[34:22] against the law of my mind and bringing
[34:25] me into captivity to the law of sin
[34:29] which is in my members so Paul was aware
[34:33] that even though he had been borned
[34:35] again he knew there was something within
[34:37] his flesh that was still bound no matter
[34:40] how free he was in his soul and he said
[34:43] I see what's happening on the inside but
[34:46] the problem is is this man that's on the
[34:48] outside and he said it's bringing me
[34:50] into captivity to the law of sin which
[34:54] is in my members verse 24 and oh
[34:57] Wretched Man that I am now notice when
[35:00] Paul says this he don't say oh Wretched
[35:02] Man that I was but Paul in his converted
[35:06] state says oh Wretched Man that I am who
[35:10] shall deliver me from the body of this
[35:14] death and from that today I'd like to
[35:16] speak on escaping death Ro may the Lord
[35:19] add His blessings to the word today you
[35:21] can be seated God bless you so honored
[35:23] to be here among you Paul whenever he
[35:27] deals with this in verse 24 he uses the
[35:31] word deliver which is actually the
[35:34] English word that you and I use for
[35:38] emancipation it's the word that we use
[35:40] for to be redeemed or to be rescued and
[35:44] then it uses this word and this is what
[35:46] we'll build from today it literally
[35:49] means to exonerate and so when you talk
[35:52] about being exonerated from something it
[35:55] literally means to be CLE clear from
[35:57] blame or accusation to be free from the
[36:00] guilt of it to release or discharge to
[36:04] be liberated and I know that we have
[36:07] heard that over and over again every
[36:09] service this week but you know it it
[36:12] just seems that maybe that's what the
[36:14] Lord wants us to hear and that when you
[36:17] would begin to look at what God says and
[36:20] how that God speaks and you you know you
[36:22] look at different things that God uh
[36:24] puts together as this meeting's been
[36:26] orchestrated by the Lord sometimes
[36:29] there's there's a theme that God puts
[36:31] together and he uses that that principle
[36:34] within his word to give that to you so
[36:37] that you will recognize I'm the one
[36:39] that's doing this I'm the one that's
[36:41] lead it's beyond the control of man but
[36:44] it's me that's doing it so we know that
[36:46] Paul when Paul talks about this part of
[36:49] being uh this battle this war that he's
[36:52] in that Paul said who shall deliver me
[36:55] from the body of this death and the
[36:58] question would be is that if Paul was
[37:00] going to be exonerated we'd have to ask
[37:03] if he's got to be delivered from
[37:04] something what brought the bondage to
[37:07] and we know that Paul was aware that he
[37:09] is a prisoner even though that Paul had
[37:12] been born again Paul been filled full of
[37:15] the Holy Ghost that Paul would still
[37:17] tell us that yet he's still in bondage
[37:20] to this Humanity that he lives in and
[37:23] you know we when we talk about death row
[37:25] death row is something that we're all
[37:27] familiar with because it's such such
[37:29] common terminology in the United States
[37:32] and the reason why a person would
[37:34] actually be to a place where they would
[37:37] you know be bound to a place where they
[37:39] have to be locked up and then their life
[37:41] will be taken it's because the
[37:44] prosecutor has found a significant
[37:47] amount of evidence that would be held
[37:50] against an individual and that the
[37:52] accusation that has been made they that
[37:55] he had been found guilty of the charge
[37:58] and that the actually that that whenever
[38:01] the charge has been given that the
[38:03] prosecutor doesn't just have as we'd say
[38:07] circumstantial evidence but even when it
[38:09] comes to an eyewitness and sometimes an
[38:12] eyewitness is one of the greatest things
[38:15] that a prosecutor has is somebody that
[38:18] saw you do the deep and let me say this
[38:21] in this case that we know that the Bible
[38:24] tells us that Satan is the accuser of
[38:27] the Brethren and that the Bible tells us
[38:30] in the Book of Revelation that he goes
[38:32] before God day and night and he accuses
[38:35] those so the accuser of the Brethren
[38:37] happens to be the eyewitness that the
[38:40] prosecutor is using that against you to
[38:43] hold you guilty and accountable for the
[38:45] sin that you did at one time and in this
[38:48] case not only is it Paul but let me say
[38:51] this every man that's born of a woman
[38:54] actually was born on death rad
[38:57] we was born into this this this place
[39:00] because of the way our natural birth had
[39:02] come because remember that what what
[39:04] causes a man to be prosecuted is because
[39:07] there's been a law that's been broken
[39:09] and the law that has been broken was B
[39:12] way back in the Book of Genesis chapter
[39:14] 2 that the Lord commanded him of every
[39:17] tree of the garden thou must freely eat
[39:19] but only of the tree of knowledge in
[39:21] good good and evil don't eat of it and
[39:24] then he says for the day thou eat
[39:26] thereof that day Thou shalt surely so
[39:30] there was a law then that once man
[39:32] breaks that law God must keep his word
[39:35] let me say this when God told man not to
[39:38] do it God simply cannot Overlook it he
[39:42] simply cannot look past it but if
[39:44] there's been a law that has been broken
[39:47] and that our God is a God that keeps his
[39:49] word he doesn't perform some shady deal
[39:52] not something under the table somewhere
[39:55] once God makes a decree he must bring
[39:57] his word to pass exactly the way that he
[40:00] said it and the Bible tells us that that
[40:03] whenever the woman took the the
[40:05] forbidden fruit and Adam took and he
[40:08] laay with his wife and I just want to
[40:09] say this the woman was deceived but Adam
[40:12] was never deceived the woman went into
[40:15] it by deception but not Adam Adam knew
[40:19] exactly what he was doing Adam knew
[40:21] exactly what was fixing to take place
[40:23] but he knew he could not bring red I to
[40:27] the woman unless he put his seed on the
[40:29] inside of her and when God so that seed
[40:32] on the inside he could not destroy uh he
[40:36] could not destroy the woman without
[40:38] destroying the seed so because the seed
[40:41] remained in the woman and Adam come to
[40:43] her it actually give her the ability to
[40:47] escape watch she should have been burned
[40:50] right along with the
[40:52] serpent but she escaped
[40:54] it and they live and Adam lives I miss
[40:58] something that God says the day thou eat
[41:02] that day thou shall surely die and
[41:05] Genesis 5 says all the days that Adam
[41:09] lived was 930 years and he died so Adam
[41:15] didn't fall over dead the moment that he
[41:18] ate the fruit you with me the the moment
[41:22] the ACT notice Adam did not fall over
[41:24] dead but let me say this Adam moves from
[41:27] one sphere to another he moves from one
[41:31] kind of life to a moral life and now
[41:33] Adam can you imagine Adam being pulled
[41:37] from that Eternal part where Adam could
[41:39] speak to the wind and the wind would
[41:41] obey he could speak to the tree and the
[41:44] tree would obey but now Something's
[41:46] Happened in Adam and because something
[41:49] is happened in Adam the word the the
[41:51] tree ain't moving and the wind's not
[41:54] stopping and the mountains not moving
[41:57] it's because Adam is pulled from that
[41:59] sphere of the spoken
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:03] words come on notice the Bible tells us
[42:07] and he died thank you brother says it
[42:10] like this in Perfection see God being
[42:12] holy and just I want you to catch that
[42:15] God is a just God he had to have a
[42:18] prosecution he had to prosecute The
[42:20] Sinner because he overstepped the
[42:22] boundaries of
[42:23] Grace and become a law breaking
[42:27] then he must be dealt with every law has
[42:30] a penalty and the penalty of
[42:32] transgressing God's law is death it had
[42:35] to project death to the human race and
[42:38] all the human race is under the penalty
[42:41] of the law and everybody can say Amen to
[42:43] that because every man woman boy and
[42:46] girl that is born after the fall that is
[42:49] born of a woman we was all born with the
[42:52] death element hanging on us there's no
[42:55] getting around that the prosecutor had
[42:58] his dead in the rights all was born in
[43:01] sin we was all shapen into iniquity we
[43:05] come into this world speaking lies
[43:08] nobody was born swinging the Bible
[43:10] nobody was born perfect nobody was born
[43:13] without mistakes nobody was born without
[43:16] every man that is born was born guilty
[43:19] say
[43:21] that why you say the law was broken and
[43:24] the penalty that comes with breaking the
[43:26] law judgment must
[43:28] follow now because the law has been
[43:32] broken brings us to our subject Every
[43:34] Man's been put in it's been put in cons
[43:37] solitary confinement all right we've
[43:39] been confined or we've been locked
[43:43] up but it ain't Bars of
[43:46] Steel it ain't a cage of Steel but what
[43:49] we've been bound up in is this human
[43:51] body right here right and Paul tells us
[43:55] even even though I got the new birth I'm
[43:58] still
[43:58] incarcerated he knew he was living what
[44:02] he knew there was a war that was going
[44:04] on Paul said for we know that the law is
[44:08] spiritual but I'm
[44:11] caral sold under sin amen think about
[44:16] that so Paul tells us I've been sold in
[44:20] the Sin I don't get ahead of myself come
[44:23] on but if I can be sold with the price
[44:28] come if I can be sold by a
[44:31] price do that mean I can be bo God but
[44:36] it takes somebody who's able it takes
[44:39] somebody who's willing it takes somebody
[44:41] who love you enough that can take your
[44:43] SE and have the ability to pay the
[44:46] rejected price to find you
[44:53] back prison even though I got new life
[44:57] I'm a proner bound up amen think about
[45:01] it every one of us here today we put
[45:04] suits on what we're incarcerated by we
[45:07] brush the teeth of what we're
[45:09] incarcerated by or if you don't you
[45:13] should he know I live on death row and
[45:18] even though I got Liberty on the inside
[45:21] I'm still trapped in this
[45:23] outside Paul goes on to say listen now
[45:26] for the earnest expectation of the
[45:29] creature it
[45:31] Waites ain't tell what happens when
[45:33] people going into prison they just keep
[45:35] waiting but in this case everything's
[45:39] waiting the trees are waiting grass is
[45:42] waiting animals is waiting everything's
[45:46] waiting for the manifestation of the
[45:48] sons of God because the creature itself
[45:51] listen to this it shall be delivered
[45:57] I love when Paul starts preaching
[45:58] positive it shall be delivered from the
[46:01] bondage corruption into the Glorious
[46:04] Liberty of the children of God for we
[46:07] know that the whole creation grth and
[46:08] surveil together in pain until now and
[46:12] not only they but ourselves also which
[46:16] has the what first fruits of the so you
[46:18] mean to tell me that even though that
[46:21] Nature's in this condition the Earth is
[46:24] in this condition is also in this
[46:27] condition and even though they got the
[46:28] first fruits of the spirit we're still
[46:30] groaning within ourselves waiting for
[46:34] what the
[46:35] adoption to wit which the prophet tells
[46:38] us in the rising of the Sun that means
[46:40] to Quicken the Redemption of
[46:44] your you mean to tell me this part of
[46:47] redemption of the price being paid it's
[46:51] not just going to do something from your
[46:52] soul Calvary did that but the end time
[46:56] of the Rapture it's not just going to do
[46:58] something for yourself but God wants to
[47:00] do something a't been done yet and he's
[47:02] going to do something to an entire group
[47:04] he he R to Enoch which was one he R to
[47:07] Elijah just was one in the days of Jesus
[47:10] when the resurrection take place think
[47:11] about but in the end time God's going to
[47:14] take a whole group and prove the power
[47:17] of the take and total Redemption to the
[47:24] B
[47:26] think about this and when the sons of
[47:29] God get put back in their place whenever
[47:33] they get back in the original condition
[47:35] it forces everything that man was given
[47:38] dominion
[47:40] over the trees get back in their place
[47:43] the line gets back in his place
[47:45] everything get put back in when the S of
[47:48] God which was the head of all when they
[47:50] get back in their place everything under
[47:52] there automatically gets pulled back
[47:54] into their place
[48:00] he says like kiss in the seals we've
[48:02] been waiting for this
[48:05] out come on we've been waiting for this
[48:08] out sir there was a day that was waiting
[48:11] on satification there was a day they was
[48:13] waiting on justification there was a day
[48:15] they was in the upper room waiting on
[48:17] the Holy
[48:20] Ghost we're waiting on
[48:24] something
[48:27] we've been waiting for this
[48:29] hour Hallelujah Lord we understand this
[48:33] will take place at the first
[48:34] resurrection Nature's groaning yes sir
[48:37] we're groaning everything's groaning
[48:41] because we realize something's not
[48:46] right I shouldn't had to fought to get
[48:49] out of bed this
[48:51] morning which was about
[48:54] 3:30 we shouldn't have to fight to get
[48:57] up we shouldn't have to fight to have
[49:00] joy we shouldn't have to fight to have
[49:03] peace but if we're fighting let me say
[49:05] this if we're fighting that proves there
[49:07] something on the inside that's standing
[49:10] against those
[49:14] things we need our second
[49:18] right I want you to listen to this and
[49:21] take this home with you the only way you
[49:23] can grown and wait for it is because
[49:27] there's been new life that is coming
[49:29] here that speaks of a new world so
[49:33] whether this says nothing or not there's
[49:35] something in here hallelujah that begins
[49:38] to speak it has a voice and it speak on
[49:41] the inside and it let you know there's a
[49:43] new world coming there's a new body
[49:45] coming there's a natur is coming speak
[49:48] of a new
[49:54] world what is it it's the baptism of the

[50:03] marriages that's the answer for our
[50:06] families that's the answer for our young
[50:08] people listen to me today that's the
[50:11] answer to our questions that's the
[50:13] answer to our doubts that's the answer
[50:15] to our wonderings is the baptism of the
[50:18] Holy

[50:53] sick he ain't going to be
[50:55] [Applause]
[51:03] hallu let's keep watching that thought
[51:05] waiting waiting waiting sitting on death
[51:10] row just waiting joob picks that same
[51:14] mentality up and he said

[51:36] that he Glory even though I may go down
[51:40] I can't stay down hallelu he knew that
[51:43] the grave could only hold him so long he
[51:47] knew there was an appointed number of
[51:49] days that he would sit upon that but
[51:52] when those days are over there's going
[51:54] to come a resurrection because job seen

[52:19] revelation there was a man Jo put by the
[52:23] way of the grave come on but there was a
[52:27] man by the name of
[52:28] Enoch and when Enoch got to fellowship
[52:31] with God death got to hanging around
[52:34] Enoch and death could not wait to take
[52:38] Enoch to the
[52:40] grave but aoch got the fellowshipping
[52:42] with God and He got The Walking with God
[52:46] until one day he just was not yes

[54:20] gone I want to tell it didn't matter
[54:22] what people thought it didn't matter
[54:24] what anybody else
[54:26] matter the
[54:34] devil says when a person struck with
[54:37] disease they got aches and pains but one
[54:41] time they wasn't that
[54:44] way preaching spiritually to you
[54:46] naturally listen to that you get struck
[54:49] with disease you got aches and you got
[54:51] pain anybody like that in this building
[54:53] with me on sure
[54:56] one time they wasn't that way so watch
[54:59] so every time we get a new ache and new
[55:01] pain we look back to our origin to when
[55:05] we didn't have it and he said but
[55:08] they're groaning they're not right
[55:10] there's something wrong they're trying
[55:12] to get back where they was when they had
[55:15] health and when the nature and people
[55:18] the Bible said they're groaning it shows
[55:20] that something's not in its a to be
[55:23] conditioned right
[55:25] amen he didn't say never be you're ought
[55:28] to be conditioned they fallen from
[55:31] somewhere so every man is born into this
[55:35] cons solitary confinement but you and I
[55:38] needed something to get us out of this
[55:40] mess and the only way to get man off a
[55:44] death rad somebody had to come Among Us
[55:48] who was not born under the penalty of
[55:51] death in his
[55:53] flesh amen and since death came by woman
[55:58] breaking the word
[56:00] brother with me watch DEATH came because
[56:04] of a woman breaking the word to restore
[56:06] redeeming back God uses a woman
[56:10] marriage that's going to believe the
[56:12] words when it looked impossible when it
[56:15] was totally invisible she still believed
[56:18] the invisible
[56:21] anywhere so somebody had to come that
[56:24] was not not born under the death that
[56:26] man was born over and since it came by
[56:29] the Fall God now watch DEATH came
[56:31] because woman burth seed into death by
[56:35] in Redemption watch God doesn't use the
[56:39] ability of
[56:42] man he going use the product of man
[56:46] you're not understanding what I'm
[56:47] saying he don't use the part that gets
[56:50] you down to make a redeemer but God took
[56:54] his own word yeah I said he didn't use
[56:56] the product of Joseph he didn't even use
[56:58] the Egg of Mary God created both egg and
[57:01] Seed he didn't use Mary's
[57:04] ability come on Mary it takes more than
[57:07] your ability it takes more than your
[57:09] understanding what does God need he
[57:11] needs your faith to believe his word and
[57:14] said be it unto me according to the
[57:21] world the fall of a woman bir the of the
[57:25] serpent in the Earth right but the
[57:28] prophet tells us that Mary did what Eve
[57:32] fa to
[57:34] do sin interrupted God's program and she
[57:38] took the seat of the
[57:40] serpent don't you see yes sir what
[57:43] Satan's pushing through the ages under
[57:46] White Horse red horse black horse The
[57:50] Pale Horse which was the only one that
[57:52] didn't have a name remember every other
[57:55] horse rider didn't have a name tell you
[57:56] come to that that last horse the P horse
[57:58] rider and the Bible said his name is
[58:00] death and hell falls after him you know
[58:03] what he's trying to do he's trying to
[58:05] get every person under the same
[58:07] anointing that Eve was under to take the
[58:10] seed of the
[58:12] [Applause]
[58:14] serpent the way that he interrupted
[58:17] God's program God interrupts the
[58:22] devil's Hallelujah
[58:25] what think about it and besides having a
[58:28] and a bunch of daughters and he
[58:31] thinks that the elect is going to be
[58:33] like all the rest of them they'll SW
[58:34] Hook Line and Sinker but something on
[58:37] the inside of them that was put there
[58:39] come on it was already there it was
[58:42] already put there it came from the mind
[58:44] of God it came from their origin at one
[58:47] time where they was but they never had
[58:48] sickness they never had thoughts they
[58:50] never had sin they never had mistake
[58:53] they was an attribute of God
[58:55] and when Satan tries to get that seed
[58:57] listen that seed cannot be
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:04] deceived right now
[59:07] Adam when he fell in the beginning Adam
[59:10] had the book of redemption the prophet
[59:13] tells us yes he did come on and he had
[59:15] the ab that's the reason Adam had the
[59:16] ability to speak the word he had the
[59:19] book he possessed the book The Power
[59:21] deep of Heaven and Earth he can control
[59:25] he can control the wind he had the
[59:27] because he had the book he had the
[59:28] spoken word but when he failed that book
[59:32] didn't go to the hands of the
[59:35] devil but the prophet tells us it went
[59:37] back into the hands of the original
[59:39] owner which is allmighty God but here's
[59:42] the problem God gave it to man he wanted
[59:45] man to possess this he wanted man to
[59:48] have this ability but when Adam lost the
[59:50] book he lost his rights to the spoken
[59:53] words
[59:55] and the book went from Adam which was an
[59:57] open book to a closed book listen for
[1:00:00] 6,000 years the book's been
[1:00:03] closed the book's been closed no man had
[1:00:07] access to it Satan didn't have access to
[1:00:09] it demons didn't have access to it
[1:00:12] nobody had access to it that's
[1:00:15] right but if you ever get to a day that
[1:00:18] we've been waiting on and hour that the
[1:00:21] book goes from a closed book to an open
[1:00:24] book what of authority lays in that book
[1:00:26] it didn't lose its Authority it didn't
[1:00:28] lose its power it didn't lose its
[1:00:30] ability it just needs somebody who can
[1:00:32] believe it and accept it for what it
[1:00:38] say John comes to Revelation chap 5 one
[1:00:42] of the most Sublime places in all the
[1:00:43] scripture and John was beginning to weep
[1:00:48] because the search went on and they
[1:00:50] couldn't find nobody they put Moses up
[1:00:52] there and Moses had a temper
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:57] but Jeremiah up there the Weeping Propet
[1:00:59] and Jeremiah wasn't good
[1:01:04] enough John wept cuz he know that those
[1:01:07] great men if they wasn't worthy they
[1:01:10] would
[1:01:11] nobody and the prophet said if there
[1:01:14] wasn't nobody worthy six steal she'd
[1:01:16] simply turn back to Adams listen this
[1:01:19] creation mankind it would turn back to
[1:01:21] ad and molecule and so forth and like
[1:01:25] not even be a creation a person or
[1:01:27] nothing else cuz Adam lost his rights of
[1:01:29] that book but there's a prize and that's
[1:01:31] Redemption there's some price of
[1:01:33] redemption that nobody could do it
[1:01:34] listen to this so he made his own
[1:01:37] law which was a kman
[1:01:43] law Lord come on and they couldn't find
[1:01:46] nobody every man was born of sex born of
[1:01:49] sexual desire he was in the original sin
[1:01:52] see he couldn't do it there was nothing
[1:01:53] in him there was no holy Pope there was
[1:01:56] no priest there was no Dr Divinity
[1:01:58] whoever me listen nobody was
[1:02:01] worthy couldn't be an angel cuz he's not
[1:02:04] King to you though they have the ability
[1:02:06] of choice they're not King to you as far
[1:02:08] as
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:10] Humanity but listen but it had to be a
[1:02:13] man right so listen this listen to how
[1:02:16] powerful God himself become a
[1:02:21] Kinsman Tak on human flesh through the
[1:02:24] bir and then he shed listen he shed his
[1:02:29] blood than how powerful that is come on
[1:02:33] he didn't shed her blood he shed his
[1:02:37] blood my question who's the he that God
[1:02:41] created listen got condescended into the
[1:02:44] form of a
[1:02:45] man and God shed
[1:02:51] his now so the blood didn't come the way
[1:02:55] our blood did no every man that's born
[1:02:58] of a woman was born with tainted blood
[1:03:02] right and the blood listen but his blood
[1:03:05] didn't come the way our blood did let me
[1:03:08] get to this because listen you and I we
[1:03:12] Bass the original part of our Lives
[1:03:15] which was word life and we come to this
[1:03:18] world in a human body but I want to say
[1:03:20] this because you and I Bast it Jesus did
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] not Jesus did not he came from fight
[1:03:31] theophany to flesh you are
[1:03:35] pastur so God came down watch what he
[1:03:37] did God created a blood cell amen let me
[1:03:42] say let me tell you why I say that he
[1:03:44] did not create blood cells no he created
[1:03:48] a
[1:03:50] blood you can't even see it with a
[1:03:52] natural eye if it's so small oh let me
[1:03:55] preach God in Simplicity it's so small
[1:03:59] it's listen you can't even your natural
[1:04:01] eye oh it can't even
[1:04:03] comprehend but God created a sale and
[1:04:06] then from that sale that he created he
[1:04:09] multiplied
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:13] Sals a Myst Redemption to you I'm going
[1:04:16] to say it again it starts with one seeds
[1:04:19] and then it
[1:04:20] multiplies and it multiplies don't you
[1:04:23] to see the way that God put the church
[1:04:25] he took 120 put them in the upper room
[1:04:28] and when they got done they begin to
[1:04:30] multiply one son after another son after
[1:04:32] another son what was they doing speaking
[1:04:35] that word preaching that word and on the
[1:04:37] day of Pentecost 3,000 Souls was added
[1:04:40] to the king of God spiritual
[1:04:43] multiplication from the
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:50] world it's all
[1:04:53] right
[1:04:55] so we're not saved by the blood of a
[1:04:58] man we're saved by the blood of
[1:05:02] God Isaiah knew what we was talking
[1:05:05] about he said it like this your
[1:05:08] iniquities has separated you in your God
[1:05:11] your sins has hid his face from you but
[1:05:15] he will not hear your hands oh let me
[1:05:18] preach the crime scene come on do it
[1:05:20] brother your sins caus him a hiest face
[1:05:23] yeah we had iniquities your hands Isaiah
[1:05:27] says your hands was defiled with blood
[1:05:29] you talking about being caught
[1:05:30] red-handed sir sir sir your hands were
[1:05:33] defiled with blood your fingers iniquity
[1:05:37] your lips have spoken lies your tongues
[1:05:39] has muttered
[1:05:43] perverseness let's just be honest s got
[1:05:45] make up a lot of stuff on
[1:05:50] us and because your blood is painted
[1:05:53] yeah it separated you and your God and
[1:05:56] it literally watch it built a wall yeah
[1:06:00] it put us in a confinement where it
[1:06:02] separated us from God and we couldn't
[1:06:05] get to God because of it because of this
[1:06:08] iniquity we couldn't get to him because
[1:06:11] we was guilty we was going to be
[1:06:13] punished and the punishment was he was
[1:06:15] going to
[1:06:17] die but remember he said we're saved by
[1:06:21] the blood right and Paul says like this
[1:06:24] in the New Testament he says but now
[1:06:27] what we've been waiting on in Christ
[1:06:33] Jesus amen not in Jim oraine s but in
[1:06:38] Christ
[1:06:39] Jesus ye who were sometimes far off are
[1:06:44] made nigh by the blood of Christ for he
[1:06:47] is our peace he has made both one and
[1:06:52] has broken down the middle wall of
[1:06:55] petition that's between us so because of
[1:06:59] the blood Paul is letting us know that
[1:07:02] the blood had the power to literally
[1:07:04] break down the wall that separated and
[1:07:07] separated us from
[1:07:10] God it literally means listen to this
[1:07:13] that word broken literally means to lose
[1:07:15] one that's
[1:07:17] bound it means to release from
[1:07:20] bonds it means to release one who is
[1:07:24] bound with
[1:07:25] chains a prisoner to discharge from
[1:07:29] prison to let him go listen to this it
[1:07:33] means to be let go scot-free yes sir off
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:39] hook thank you Lord to dismiss to break
[1:07:42] up the laws having a binding force that
[1:07:45] are locking to where it brings complete
[1:07:48] an how many thankful for the
[1:07:50] blood so there is a binding Force that
[1:07:54] had this war had me handcuffed and
[1:07:56] chained out I was destined to die every
[1:07:58] man that was born of a woman lived for a
[1:08:00] few years go by the way of the Grave
[1:08:02] then life comes goes by the way of the
[1:08:03] Grave life comes again goes by the way
[1:08:05] of the grave and we've been in that
[1:08:07] cycle all of these years think of that
[1:08:09] your family line has been in that cycle
[1:08:12] all of these years but I want to tell
[1:08:15] you we've been waiting on this hour
[1:08:17] right do you know why because we found
[1:08:21] an
[1:08:22] appeal
[1:08:25] we found appeal because there's been
[1:08:27] some new evidence that's come I'm done
[1:08:30] listen there's been some new evidence
[1:08:32] come up in my
[1:08:33] face and the law can't hold me no longer
[1:08:37] if there's evidence that's been produced
[1:08:39] that I'm not the one that's guilty of
[1:08:42] us do you realize this is in the last 20
[1:08:47] years there's been more people in the
[1:08:50] last 20 to 25 years that's been living
[1:08:53] on death death row that's been let go
[1:08:55] than ever in the history of the world
[1:08:58] and the reason why is because listen
[1:09:01] because of scientific advancements of
[1:09:04] the ability to see what is not
[1:09:08] there to go beyond what our eye can see
[1:09:11] what the feeler can feel what the mind
[1:09:13] can
[1:09:15] think there's been a scientific
[1:09:17] advancement called the ability to search
[1:09:22] DNA and DNA listen DNA is found in the
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:32] blood science and technology has
[1:09:35] discovered the ability to test the DNA
[1:09:39] the evidence found at the crime of the
[1:09:40] scene of the
[1:09:41] crime
[1:09:43] now the DNA of somebody is literally a
[1:09:47] genetic fingerprint yep there's not
[1:09:50] another person in the world that has
[1:09:52] your DNA
[1:09:56] now you will right here it listen your
[1:09:59] eye color can be
[1:10:01] impersonated your hair color can be
[1:10:04] impersonated your stature can be
[1:10:06] impersonated but you can't listen DNA
[1:10:09] cannot be
[1:10:12] impersonated first can be impersonated
[1:10:15] second but when it comes to s word when
[1:10:18] it comes to sing when it comes to act
[1:10:21] and up the person listen they try to
[1:10:24] impersonate Christianity but they cannot
[1:10:26] impersonate a real blue true Sy of
[1:10:30] allmighty
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:38] God DNA first become noticeable in the
[1:10:43] late 1800s which is the years of
[1:10:46] restoration
[1:10:47] right you see where I'm going come on
[1:10:50] but the problem is in the 18 1800s they
[1:10:55] knew that the blood cell was a genetic
[1:10:58] cold yeah but it was still a
[1:11:02] mystery it was just a
[1:11:06] mystery so there was something that was
[1:11:09] locked up in the blood they knew there
[1:11:11] was something in there but they didn't
[1:11:14] have the
[1:11:16] vision they didn't have the
[1:11:18] eyesight they didn't have the
[1:11:22] prophetic to deep enough in it to tell
[1:11:24] you what
[1:11:26] Las so it was a code yes sir it was a
[1:11:30] mystery they couldn't figure out they
[1:11:33] had
[1:11:33] pieces they had
[1:11:36] Parts just to live my face come on they
[1:11:40] had pieces they had Parts but the
[1:11:43] genetic code of the blood was still a
[1:11:46] mystery go Google it but somewhere in
[1:11:50] the mid
[1:11:51] 1960s oh right thank God
[1:11:56] go because of the advancement of
[1:11:59] scientific ability and the ability of
[1:12:02] the of the glass to be able to see
[1:12:04] further in the 1960s The Mystery of the
[1:12:07] blood begin to be
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:15] unlocked in other words it had been a
[1:12:18] mystery for all of these
[1:12:20] years but now the right hour has come
[1:12:23] the hour only been waiting on the hour
[1:12:25] that J waited on the hour that listen
[1:12:30] God has been waiting on this
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:34] G what they found was each person's DNA
[1:12:38] actually contains an individual
[1:12:41] identity it's a genetic fingerprint
[1:12:43] listen you don't think you're an
[1:12:45] original think nobody else in this world
[1:12:46] got your
[1:12:47] fingerprint nobody that's good so the
[1:12:50] DNA that is good is a part of the
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:55] body the the Unseen part of the body
[1:12:59] that your identity is hiding in
[1:13:01] right here's the deal it was hiding in
[1:13:04] there and you didn't even know it was so
[1:13:07] when you was born of a man of woman
[1:13:09] there was a mystery on the inside of you
[1:13:10] you didn't even know what it
[1:13:12] was amen but as you begin to grow and as
[1:13:17] you begin to age come on and your eyes
[1:13:20] begin to come
[1:13:21] open now catch this
[1:13:24] you cannot impersonate
[1:13:26] DNA let me say this the outside man has
[1:13:30] all kinds of
[1:13:32] impersonations but when it comes to the
[1:13:35] mystery of the third pool it cannot be
[1:13:37] impersonated by nobody cuz Satan don't
[1:13:40] even know what it is
[1:13:42] himself see that he don't even know what
[1:13:45] it is itself that's the reason when the
[1:13:47] Prophet come to the end of the seven
[1:13:48] seal and begins to talk about the third
[1:13:50] pool and then he begins to come over
[1:13:52] couple mess Mitch again souls in prison
[1:13:55] again s Le souls in prison go well
[1:13:57] that's for the people that's Eternal
[1:13:58] lost come on right come on but you and I
[1:14:02] recognized we've already heard the eagle
[1:14:04] scream we've already heard the message
[1:14:06] of the hour we've already
[1:14:08] heard we already heard from the Lord and
[1:14:10] now what we've been mystery for is now
[1:14:13] revealed for and your eyes has come
[1:14:19] open
[1:14:21] Hallelujah so but from the mid 1900s let
[1:14:24] me get this there was pieces and parts
[1:14:26] but in the mid 1960 the mystery be to
[1:14:29] unfold and it just so happens to be that
[1:14:33] the same time that the DNA and the
[1:14:36] genetic code was being broke the book
[1:14:38] that had been sealed since the days that
[1:14:40] ad lost it the book is going to get
[1:14:43] taken and the seals are going to come
[1:14:45] off and and the Mystery of the word is
[1:14:48] being made known the same hour that the
[1:14:50] mystery of the blood's being made known
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:57] and the question would be who brought
[1:14:59] all this
[1:15:01] understanding I want to tell you it was
[1:15:03] the one that came from the midst of the
[1:15:07] throne remember what the prophet said he
[1:15:09] said they looked there in Revelation
[1:15:10] chap 5 they saw the Beast remember that
[1:15:14] the four beasts right oxman eagle and
[1:15:17] the prophet tells us that's the same
[1:15:19] ones that was guarden away in the in the
[1:15:21] Garden of Eden he said there was four
[1:15:22] chables there they was there to to guard
[1:15:24] Every Which Way North South East and
[1:15:26] West have ox man and Eagle sir right
[1:15:29] think about it I know it's a standing
[1:15:32] but listen to that again lonox man Eagle
[1:15:35] stood guarding the
[1:15:36] gate what was that Garden way to the
[1:15:39] Tree of Life which was not an apple tree
[1:15:42] was an orange tree it was Christ and
[1:15:45] here they are in Revelation chap 5 doing
[1:15:48] the same thing they did in Genesis

[1:15:50] Revelation chapter 5 let me tell you
[1:15:52] this John didn't see they must have done
[1:15:55] a pretty good job come on now come on

[1:16:04] went to humanity side there you go and
[1:16:06] tears begin the human tears come out of
[1:16:08] John's eyes that's when the mystery from
[1:16:11] the midst of the throne he said here
[1:16:13] came a lamb as it had
[1:16:15] been as it had been slain so here comes
[1:16:19] the lamb that had been slain watch what
[1:16:21] he don't say this ain't line that's
[1:16:23] coming which represents judge but it's a
[1:16:28] lamb which tells us the dates of mercy

[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:39] progress so here comes the lamb takes
[1:16:42] the book opens the seals and reveals the
[1:16:44] mystery of the world
[1:16:46] Amen
[1:16:48] listen not
[1:16:50] only has DNA exonerated a
[1:16:56] people on but it's also found the one
[1:16:58] who was rightfully guilty of breaking
[1:17:01] the
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:06] life the mystery the seals open didn't
[1:17:10] just bring your identity it identified
[1:17:13] that Antichrist spirit that started
[1:17:16] riding under that white horse rider
[1:17:18] deception that R through that Ephesian
[1:17:20] Church age went right on Down Under that
[1:17:22] ox morning down and that day let me say
[1:17:25] this it's going to identify the
[1:17:27] Antichrist spirit all the way through
[1:17:29] the church
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] ages
[1:17:33] hallelujah what happens is it takes the
[1:17:37] one who is on death row and it lets him
[1:17:39] go scot-free and the law binds the one
[1:17:43] who was originally guilty of it in the
[1:17:45] first
[1:17:46] part in the first place amen says oh

[1:17:53] breach we've been waiting on this hour

[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:45] on L it's a law that had us bound
[1:19:50] something sets us free sir did you know
[1:19:53] that everything on the earth yeah come
[1:19:56] on is bound by
[1:19:58] law it's called
[1:20:01] gravitation everything's under the law
[1:20:04] which what that means is that if I got
[1:20:07] this handkerchief in my hand every time
[1:20:10] I open my hand it's going to do the same
[1:20:12] thing do you know why there's a law
[1:20:16] that's binding that thing and every time
[1:20:19] I open my hand that law takes over and
[1:20:22] let me say this the law of gravity is
[1:20:25] proportional to the size of an object
[1:20:28] that it's pulling
[1:20:30] against let me say it like this the
[1:20:32] heavier you
[1:20:33] are with
[1:20:36] sin the more bound down you are with sin
[1:20:40] on the more the law has a pull on your
[1:20:43] lives but Paul said lay aside every
[1:20:48] weight of sin of
[1:20:50] unbelief in other words we're not
[1:20:53] packing a listen we're not packing a f
[1:20:55] we're unpacking we're not packing a
[1:20:58] suitcase we're unpacking pie we're ping
[1:21:02] we're packing
[1:21:04] we're
[1:21:13] leing all
[1:21:15] says every time open my
[1:21:17] hand it says this is going to do the
[1:21:20] same
[1:21:21] thing brother Newton tell tell us it's
[1:21:23] going to do the same thing every time
[1:21:26] matter of fact I preach another two
[1:21:28] hours be here by myself but yes
[1:21:34] sir M would be here yeah I had my hands
[1:21:37] around his
[1:21:38] neck but it says every time I open my
[1:21:41] hand it's going to do the same thing
[1:21:43] amen but it ain't falling now no you
[1:21:47] know why there's a higher
[1:21:50] power that super
[1:21:54] that literally interrupts one law
[1:21:56] because of a higher law amen what is it
[1:22:00] there is a law of life that suspends it
[1:22:03] in the air and does not allow the law of
[1:22:06] gravity to drop it listen to take it
[1:22:08] back to the dust take it back to the
[1:22:10] dark take it back to the earth a high
[1:22:13] they interrup the Lord
[1:22:18] grav and when the Rapture Tes place on
[1:22:21] there's going to come a high
[1:22:23] that's going to come by your heart it's
[1:22:25] going to come by my heart and the LA of
[1:22:27] the right will Su you and I we will meet
[1:22:30] the brother that devil that has ped upon
[1:22:33] you ever since the day you was Bor he
[1:22:36] don't have no rights to
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:39] you because the you is going to ro
[1:22:46] you and not just
[1:22:49] you and not just you
[1:22:55] I got some loved
[1:22:57] ones that's in that grave the bodies are
[1:23:01] let me say this God knows where every
[1:23:03] one of them are they may have been eat
[1:23:05] my lines God knows where the very just
[1:23:07] for that line whenever they pass through
[1:23:10] he knows where that dirt
[1:23:13] is hallelujah we're not preaching
[1:23:16] replacement we're preaching
[1:23:21] Resurrection
[1:23:26] the only way is you got to come under a
[1:23:29] higher
[1:23:30] law now an airplane temporarily breaks
[1:23:34] the law of gravity but it can't keep you
[1:23:37] up there forever you know why runs out
[1:23:40] of
[1:23:40] power I said it runs short so you can
[1:23:44] bounce around for a little while jump up
[1:23:46] and down chat right yes sir but
[1:23:49] eventually it's going to run out of
[1:23:50] Sting yes sir you know why we we all get
[1:23:52] tired we all get weak yeah but if you
[1:23:56] get in something that's not limited to
[1:23:58] the atmosphere we're in it's just a
[1:24:01] spaceship it possesses a power to take
[1:24:05] you from one atmosphere to another
[1:24:08] atmosphere that's not controlled by the
[1:24:10] law that you're bound by so it actually
[1:24:13] becomes
[1:24:17] weightless I'm going to say this one
[1:24:19] time you if you get put in a spacecraft
[1:24:22] and you go beyond our atmosphere I'm not
[1:24:25] talking about after you die yeah there
[1:24:27] people that's that's living yes sir
[1:24:30] they're living in that
[1:24:32] atmosphere enough
[1:24:34] hallelujah hallelujah there's people
[1:24:38] that's living in an atmosphere that the
[1:24:39] law does not bind
[1:24:41] them Hallelujah
[1:24:44] somebody you know why you know why
[1:24:46] they're not bound by the law of the
[1:24:48] Earth because they're not Earthbound
[1:24:50] people I'm tell you when the revelation
[1:24:53] of this word opens up and reveals your
[1:24:55] identity it lures the say it takes you
[1:24:58] one from one sphere to another sphere
[1:25:01] we're not trying to hop around like a
[1:25:02] bunch of rabbits we're not trying to be
[1:25:04] a bunch of airplane a people we're not
[1:25:06] just trying to be Pentecostal or
[1:25:07] Pentecostal we're elected we're Bri
[1:25:10] we're chosen we're called We're ordained
[1:25:12] we're God's people and God ordained you
[1:25:15] not to be Earth
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:21] creatures we are not human
[1:25:24] beings experiencing Heavenly things
[1:25:28] we're Heavenly things experiencing human
[1:25:34] lives just from what perspective you
[1:25:37] want to look at and that's what Calvary
[1:25:40] did Calvary give you a blood
[1:25:43] transfusion and whenever the test is
[1:25:45] done on your blood and they draw your
[1:25:48] blood and take it to the courtroom
[1:25:50] there's something wrong with your DNA no
[1:25:52] something right you know because the
[1:25:55] devil wants to deal with time the devil
[1:25:57] wants you to run your mind every mistake
[1:26:00] you made every shortcoming you got every
[1:26:02] bad thought that comes through he wants
[1:26:03] to run you back to time but I want to
[1:26:05] say your DNA does not run you back to
[1:26:07] mistakes it don't you back to your
[1:26:09] shortcoming it runs you back to your
[1:26:11] original identity when you was an
[1:26:13] attribute in the mind of God before the
[1:26:15] foundation that's what
[1:26:21] your
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:25] so that tells me death row has no rights
[1:26:27] to
[1:26:28] me because if the sin's been dealt with
[1:26:32] that the accuser's been holding against
[1:26:34] me and the DNA don't match Hey sir If It
[1:26:38] Don't Fit you must have
[1:26:43] quit get
[1:26:46] that what is he
[1:26:48] talking he don't fit you must have quit
[1:26:51] yeah and I'm not talking about Ben CH
[1:26:53] perro Johnny coch I'm talking about
[1:26:55] almighty God this ain't something to try
[1:26:58] to fool somebody God ain't trying to
[1:27:00] fool the devil I'm come about you a rual
[1:27:02] identity by the blood L get you a blood
[1:27:05] transfusion it changes the moal
[1:27:07] structure of your blood you're not born
[1:27:10] of Earth you're a Heavenly
[1:27:15] person one scripture born scripture he
[1:27:18] that is born of God does not commit s
[1:27:23] yes sir anybody made mistakes this
[1:27:27] week anybody got
[1:27:30] shortcomings sir wait a minute then Paul
[1:27:33] said hey this morning God don't commit
[1:27:35] him what you talking about well let me
[1:27:37] just tell you who we're talking about he
[1:27:40] that is born of God by the new birth
[1:27:42] cannot see he may make mistakes he may
[1:27:46] have shortcoming but not he because the
[1:27:49] S of God remain in
[1:27:54] so the next time that accuser comes by
[1:27:56] your you can let him know I would have
[1:27:59] done it in
[1:28:01] the what the prophet tells us in
[1:28:03] invisible union he said you never done
[1:28:05] it the question is who's the real you
[1:28:08] it's not natural you it's not human you
[1:28:10] it's words you you never done it the
[1:28:13] eventual identity by the world has never
[1:28:15] been guilty you are son and daugh of God
[1:28:19] you was accused of that but you you you
[1:28:22] never done
[1:28:27] it you never done it in the first
[1:28:32] place no you
[1:28:34] didn't the first place was not 2,000
[1:28:36] years ago or 30 years ago brother the
[1:28:39] first place wasn't the Garden of Eden
[1:28:41] the first place was in the mind of God
[1:28:44] before the
[1:28:45] foundation of the
[1:28:47] world I want to tell you what a promise
[1:28:51] that the Lord Lord has given
[1:28:53] amen Paul quotes that famous scripture
[1:28:56] in first Thessalonians 4 and he said the
[1:28:59] Lord
[1:29:00] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:29:03] shout the voice of the Archangel and
[1:29:06] with the Trump of God Amen and the dead
[1:29:09] in Christ shall
[1:29:12] rise hallelujah amen that's the truth
[1:29:15] brother that means everything that's
[1:29:16] been bound I got some family that's
[1:29:19] coming
[1:29:20] back I said we're coming back they've
[1:29:24] been having a reunion without us yeah
[1:29:27] but I'm going to tell you they speak to
[1:29:29] be a reunion it ain't going to be on
[1:29:31] this Earth it's going to be in the
[1:29:33] middle of the
[1:29:35] Earth PA says we which are shall be
[1:29:38] caught up together with them in the
[1:29:41] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:29:43] so shall
[1:29:45] we be with the
[1:29:47] Lord think about that Paul said at the
[1:29:50] last you realize when Paul makes that
[1:29:53] statement about the last Trump to the
[1:29:56] Jew they didn't have cell phones then so
[1:29:59] they would blow the trumpet and the
[1:30:01] trumpet had a distinction or a meaning
[1:30:04] and Paul said this is the last Trump
[1:30:05] they're used to three of them the first
[1:30:08] trumpet sound you know what the first
[1:30:09] Trump means the first Trump means it's
[1:30:11] just about time it's just about time and
[1:30:14] then the second trumpet means pull P to
[1:30:16] pull up the stakes pack up the tents
[1:30:19] right that's what it means means pack up
[1:30:21] the tent and get in
[1:30:23] line and then Paul said the last Trump
[1:30:27] and the last Trump is marching orders
[1:30:30] which means you're going to March right
[1:30:31] off of this C BL Hallelujah you're going
[1:30:34] to March right out of this pron into a
[1:30:37] body ain't got no trouble ain't got no
[1:30:39] scar ain't got no Fe you're going to
[1:30:42] leave at the last
[1:30:47] Trum I want to say this we've heard the
[1:30:50] first Trump to get ready yes sir right H
[1:30:54] the second Trump to get in your position
[1:30:56] get in your place pull up the stakes and
[1:30:58] the last Trump it's marching order so
[1:31:00] let me say this when you recognize who
[1:31:02] you always was when that last one comes
[1:31:05] in yes sir
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:16] right can we bow our hearts just for a
[1:31:18] moment every head bow can we just lift
[1:31:20] our hands to him right now Lord
[1:31:23] Jesus these are the hands of people that
[1:31:26] are defying the law of
[1:31:29] gravity gravity takes a man's hands and
[1:31:32] pulls him down but people in this place
[1:31:35] today that's been saved by the blood of
[1:31:38] almighty God we raise our hands to you
[1:31:41] to say Thank You Lord thank you for this
[1:31:44] great blood thank you for this salvation

[1:32:16] we believe that we're living in the
[1:32:18] closing moments of the Gentile

[1:32:25] place in Israel don't we understand

[1:33:24] are in Christ is not imputing their
[1:33:28] trespasses and he is committed unto us

[1:33:33] reconciliation and the word of
[1:33:35] reconciliation is the word of
[1:33:38] restoration we have been restored back

[1:37:32] hearts of the people I love what Brother
[1:37:34] David got at the end on the third
[1:37:36] trumpet call it was marching amen I
[1:37:39] think what he said ought to be on a

[1:37:43] Heavenly things we're Heavenly beings
[1:37:45] doing Earthly things somebody put that
[1:37:47] on a shirt I'll wear it we're Heavenly
[1:37:49] beings doing Earthly things isn't it
[1:37:52] wonderful we're about to do something
[1:37:54] that there ain't no man done since the
[1:37:56] fall in the garden isn't it something he
[1:37:59] told Adam in the day thou eat thereof
[1:38:01] Thou shalt surely die but said there the
[1:38:04] oldest man that's ever lived since that
[1:38:05] time was 969 years he had never as a man
[1:38:09] had the ability to live a thousand years
[1:38:11] you know there are scientists today that
[1:38:13] are trying to prove that a man can live
[1:38:14] a th000 years but they'll never be able
[1:38:16] to do it by science he said but one day
[1:38:18] we will we'll live in a millennium for
[1:38:21] years to prove that God has paid the
[1:38:24] penalty for sin it do the very thing
[1:38:26] that men don't have the ability to do I
[1:38:28] thought isn't it wonderful no man's ever
[1:38:30] live cuz we always die before a th years
[1:38:33] but isn't it something that the
[1:38:34] Millennium just happened to be a th
[1:38:36] years he said it'll prove that men will
[1:38:38] walk right into eternity I believe we're
[1:38:40] Eternal beings we'll live there Amen in
[1:38:44] that day of we're going to live amen
[1:38:45] isn't it wonderful today we're creatures

[1:45:20] kind this hard to even get up and go to
[1:45:21] church that's right we don't feel like
[1:45:24] it but we still come and we serve God
[1:45:26] and we praise God we put One Foot In
[1:45:28] Front Of Another we just we just walk in
[1:45:31] the promises of God even when we don't
[1:45:36] you know sometimes in reality sometimes
[1:45:38] you don't feel
[1:45:40] God Bible says I walk by faith and not
[1:45:42] by sight you can put any sense in that
[1:45:44] scripture we're walk by faith and not by
[1:45:47] fear we walk by faith it's not the
[1:45:50] senses of our flesh but not that we walk
[1:45:52] this walk but we walk by faith it
[1:45:55] doesn't matter if it's in your best day
[1:45:57] or your worst day you get up and be a
[1:45:59] Son of God be a daughter of God and one
[1:46:01] of these mornings it be the last time

[1:46:05] pain and in that triy it'll be the last
[1:46:07] time yes amen I'm just looking forward

[1:46:20] a far some great mystery that's 100
[1:46:22] Years of the future or something that
[1:46:24] very day we're living in that day we're
[1:46:26] living in the rapturing age amen this is
[1:46:28] the age of the Rapture this is why God
[1:46:30] has unveiled the signs that he's
[1:46:31] unveiled to the church in this age we're
[1:46:33] living in a Rapture and age and I thank
[1:46:35] God I'm a part of it is't it something
[1:46:37] that he chose you to live in that age he
