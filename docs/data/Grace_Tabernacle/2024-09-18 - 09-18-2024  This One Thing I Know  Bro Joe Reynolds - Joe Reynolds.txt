night service brother marks come and got the people's hearts ready my what a what a presence this evening sure enjoyed the song service tonight and want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ certainly a privilege to be here tonight and to speak God's word one more time and if you got your Bibles inv invites you to Matthew chapter 16 we just m ministering up at brother BS this weekend and we got into this thought some on Sunday evening and still burning on our hearts hope it's a blessing here tonight Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 familiar scripture when Jesus came into the coast of sister of Philippi um he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that the son of man am and they said some say they art John the Baptist some Elijah and those Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto him but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed unto the uh revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I'll give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatsoever Thou shalt bind on the Earth shall be bound in the heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in the heavens amen also can we read Hebrews the faith chapter chapter 11 everybody happy tonight amen now it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by Elders obtained a good rep report through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by his being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him for before the translation he had his this testimony that he please God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that come to God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that disly seeks him by faith Noah being warned of God these things not as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which they condemn the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place where he should have to receed for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which Foundation whose Builder and maker is God hallelujah can we just bow our heads tonight Lord Jesus our hearts burn within tonight Lord God Lord as we begin to read about soldiers in the Old Testament and how they stay true to your word Lord and by Faith Lord God they looked at your promise besides the circumstances of Life Lord Lord I pray tonight Lord God that we could do the same today Lord God Lord God that we can look past our failures look past the the circumstances of Life Lord God and lean to not to our own understanding father but Lord walk by faith Lord God and not by sight Lord without faith it's impossible please you but with Faith Lord God lord it's pleasing unto you Lord God we'll walk victorious in this life Lord that you have given us to live in this side of glory Lord we pray L God that you'll take these few scriptures and quotes tonight Lord God and edify your Believers here tonight we pray in Jesus Christ one wonderful name and the bride says amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening last time we was here with you we uh we ministered on the lines of um the contents of his will and we've got to a few things tonight we'd like to get to along those same lines tonight but if we had a title tonight we call this one thing I know and we was looking here and I was thinking about how that uh many times I was hearing the prophet of God today I was reading where he was talking about Peter and how that they got it all wrong and how they said it it was a built upon a man or built a tabernacle for Peter and but Brother P said it wasn't that at all it was actually a revelation that he received not from flesh and blood but from his heavenly father and he also went on to say the scripture says also that you know the gates of hell is going to be against it but it can never Prevail against it amen that should make it excited tonight amen that we can have a revelation by faith tonight that hell just don't know what to do with us amen don't you believe that and brother B would say it like this the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize he said the church is built on a revelation on thus sayeth the Lord it's a Lord's battle if God be for us who can be against us how did he said how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God he said it was by faith he received the revelation of the blood and Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had the Commandment he had the letter so he couldn't offer the right the sacrifice it was a re reation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life so what made the difference was not a letter not a Bible not a word but fact of the matter is it was a revelation that was given by the father that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life and he goes on and said Cain was just as religious as Abel was they both built altars they both loved God they both was religious they both off up sacrifices they both worship they both pay ties Brother David they done they both done everything just alike but Able by faith which is the Revelation he listen to this he says the word of God revealed made plain showed out Vindicated he says Glory Cain made an offering but God didn't vindicate it God didn't accept Cain's worship brother Joey couldn't accept Cain's sacrifice but yet he worshiped yet he came to church yet he paid ties yet he followed a letter and brother Rand no doubt his sacrifice was beautiful to the eyes of the men and women that was around other the churches and no doubt they would pick his sacrifice over Abel's 10 out of 10 times but the difference was amen didn't have didn't matter how beautiful the sacrifice was it was a it was according to the purpose and the will of almighty God and God revealed unto Abel that it was a bloody mess and no doubt to the Mind sister Sandy of Abel no doubt he questioned himself M he maybe looked over at Cain's worship and how that it was just beautiful with flowers and Greenery and my how everybody maybe was ooing and aing over such a sacrifice but he bypassed his flesh he bypassed his feelings he bypass what the church thought Heen he had a divine revelation of the will of God and he went out and he began to make preparation for fulfilling amen amen he went out and got a got a had a sacrifice and begin to brother B would tell you he took old sharp Rock and he begin to uh begin to beat against the neck of that that lamb my the world was calling fanaticism the world was making fun of his worship the world was telling him they're losing the he's lost his mind but he kept on hacking at the sacrifice and blood begin to drain off of that sacrifice upon the altar but you know what Papa was looking down from the heavens looking down upon that sacrifice if he could say it like this this is my son this is my boy amen it was pleasing the father that he that he applied the blood upon the altar Hallelujah a but Abra Abel's was by Revelation and it stimulated him it's stimulated he was stimulated by Revelation and though his worship it become true could you imagine Abel when he if you'll give me a few moments tonight when you can imagine Abel as he begins to beat against the neck of that innocent lamb amen he became one with a sacrifice he be to worship he didn't care who's around him he didn't care who's at church he didn't care what people thought about him Heen he didn't care if they made fun of him because he worshiped he made fun of him because he danced he it didn't it didn't matter to him why he was in he was such in tune with worship oh Church we're not looking for some f fanaticism around the message but we are looking for some true worshippers that come to worship the father in spirit and in truth hallelujah then he goes on but God didn't vindicate it he couldn't vindicate at it didn't matter how beautiful it was he could never vindicate it but how to the world how ugly this sacrifice but God comes down and vindicates it and the scripture said by faith Abel offered up the Sacrifice by faith which is revelation can I go on he said now as a old symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find out the old and Wine's connected to worship it's always connected to worship he said then the wine I said which come to me the wine symbolizes was a power it was a power of stimulation by Revelation and that's when something has been revealed it gives a stimulation to the believer because it's presented by Revelation it's something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand it Cain couldn't understand it is a mystery remember we last time we was with you we was ministering on the contents of the wheel and we dealt with that for a moment how that that that yesterday is no longer a mystery tomorrow is a mystery to us hey but but after tomorrow comes yesterday it's no longer a mystery you're living it it was a mystery to the world but not to Able and he says they can't understand it after a while God comes down and reveals it and vindicates it so we're not living under a mystery any longer we're living it see he says and you cannot know until you have faith and Faith produces the no so faith is the No No so he says is faith just like job he said job he he Satan was poking everything at him to get him to curse his God how many felt like they've been there time and two in your life amen everything was going wrong in job's life amen his Runners was telling him you're losing this job you lost this job job you lost your children amen job was broken down in Bulls all over his body blood dripping off his elbows but was happening around job wasn't affecting what was going on the inside of the inside Satan was poking everything he could but remember God said that you can do anything to him but you can't take his life amen but he knew the Integrity of job's heart and he spoke these words in his dep in his situation with all hell is fall uh coming down upon him every demonic power of hell is tormenting job to a place his wife said job why don't you curse God and die but job in his in his distress his sickness and all the things that was happening around job job finds himself brother Brown said coming to the edge of the window looking out out the window into God's universe and he begins to see the Trees of blooming he sees the leaves green leaves of life springing up in the trees he sees the the grass growing he sees the wind blowing through the flowers of and something begins to burn inside of job and everything that's going on around him God knew the Integrity of job's heart I'm here to tell you he's the same God and everything that you're going through in this life God knows exactly what's going on he knows exactly where you are but he also he brother Jared hey everything that you ever needed of even the raptures already within you listen friend in this hour it was a conding sending of God not to go over everything we preached last time AB was a condescending of God he was God above us he was God With Us in Jesus Christ but he condescended down in the form of the Holy Spirit to become the executor of his own will to come down and live and be trapped in humanity sealed to the day of your Redemption and you're only here reflecting your inheritance somewhere else and you're here doing it because he's living in you greater is he that is in you than the he that's in the world don't you love him and we find job at that desperate moment of time when hell brother Fon thought they had him many times hell thinks he got you too but look around you're here tonight he stoed everything at you but you're here tonight amen and I can hear can't you hear job as he looks out the window and they hell thought they had their grips on job then job begins to scream out I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah I say tonight amen I know he's my healer amen it's not a mystery any longer I'm living it amen that's the way it is to a True Believer Hallelujah I know my redeemer liveth he says I want you to notice every man that ever had a spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for fulfilling I like that I had run around when I read that me and Matt both together amen he man that's good I said man it's good brother Brown knows how to put things sometimes and just just right in the under inspiration of studying God drops something down right in your lap I thank God for the message of the hour thank God the message the contents of the will has been read in this hour amen it told you amen the executor of the will amen like I said last time called your name amen it didn't invite everyone not everybody was notified only those names that was written in the land's Book of Life aen names that's going to be called out in this hour and God sent a message in this hour to notify this world is not your home Hallelujah but we're here making preparation for fulfillment Hallelujah that's what why we praise him tonight amen we don't praise him we don't jump up and down because somebody's here that we want to want no no no no no we're here to praise God we're here to make preparation for fulfillment just like Bon bares did amen when brother M said when he dropped that garment that he carried with him everywhere he went sister Joyce letting the world know hey I'm blind I might need your assistance amen I am blind I've got had something to lead me around from pill the post but when he heard Jesus was coming by Benji something happened to him as he begin to walk I can imagine there was some stimulation from the Revelation that was going on down inside of his heart Sister Sarah that was saying I'm not going to need this garment any longer and no doubt every devil out of hell that lights was coming on screaming you better do something you better do something but brother Travis when he took that garment prepared himself for fulfillment and he let go of that garment that identified his blind and begin to make his way to Jesus and Jesus began to tell him thy faith thy faith has made thee whole I say before he ever got his natural side blind Bar M already knew that he was going to be healed heyen when he shed that garment he made preparation for fulfillment and he knew extra extra Read All About It praise God I'm Healed Hallelujah and bl blind John Ryan he was still blind but he was still making preparation for fulfillment amen so he water with praise Hallelujah he says re the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for fulfilling he said I hope that goes way down deep tonight way down on the fifth rib on the left side notice ever if it's ever revealed to you that God's going to heal you you just get ready for it you just get ready for extra extra Read All About It praise God I'm Healed believe it believe it is a substance and that substance brother Bown said creates a perfect faith and he said that perfect faith is designed to master every circumstances brother Brown said regardless perfect Faith Masters every circumstances faith is the victory that overcomes the world brother Brown says it like this faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil doesn't matter where you're at brother Robert doesn't mean Hey listen God knows where you're at tonight he's Jehovah he's omniscient he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he knows everything about you he knows in your dark nights at your home when whenever things going on in your mind and Satan's tormenting your mind he's telling you no good amen God's sitting there watching that tonight nothing happens to you by coincidence God's an ontime God that's one thing I know today amen presidents can fail you Kings can fail you religions can fail you churches can fail you but let me tell you a secret tonight my God can never fail you he's never failed you one time I know one thing tonight my God's word can never come back void I know one thing tonight if God before me who can be against me hallelujah thank you Lord do you believe it when the truth of the promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine he says is a stimulation he says Glory I feel it right now it's stimulated with joy it stimulates with shouts he says oh when the when it does it has some effect upon them the wine does it upon a natural man the same way why wine will do to a natural man he said would do a spiritual man the same way spiritual wine he said he'll stimulate him with joy when all hell's against him he'll stimulate him to raise his hands when everything's against him you can be sick and body but that's stimulation from Revelation you can't help yourself it's something within you nothing can stop it the Gates of Hell can never Prevail against it Hallelujah the same effect because when the Revelation has been given of the truth of God and the True Believer is filled with oil how many's filled with oil tonight and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself unno normally he says right Glory see that's what's a matter with them now that's what makes them behave them some seemingly he said what we need today is an oldfashioned Billy Sunday belly busting rip snorton Revival Hallelujah he said well we need power back to shake thees of hell down in the devil's eyes and say you're a liar God's word is is true and I'm standing on it can I have a witness tonight amen I'm telling you tonight how many can stand on it tonight let the let the let our worship and praise fill hell's eyes tonight let our worship Rock hell tonight he said what we need he said we need some wine we need some stimulation [Music] you know why we have dead churches cuz they have no Revelation if you have Revelation there's stimulation it comes together amen there's worship there's praise it stimulates you to get off your hands it stimulates to get to your feet it stimulates and amen it stimulates a praise not just from the lips amen I said it many times Amen brother Veron if it's just from the lips down the road the Pentecostal church over Porsche and and they got it too but I'm here to say it's more than just a lip service I'm here to say it's thus amen every step is is is nothing but an amen so be it Lord B it unto me I'll go Lord I'll Stand I'll fight how many warriors do we have tonight amen just not an amen from the lips but an amen from the feet and positionally place Satan where he belongs tonight is under your feet ration amen Satan will become powerless listen if you get a true re divine revelation if you've been notified and you've heard the will call your name how many's heard the call the shout has gone forth a lot of chickens have left the message but you know what there's a lot of other denomination rims out here amen they keep going on keeping the Commandments keep coming to church paying their tithes fulfilling the ritual but the message has never notified them brother Brown said it like this uh I believe future home he bet he said that they bassed the priest when Jesus was going down to harlot at the well he said because that priest was never up there there was nothing in there to be notified he said but the woman at the well had representation oh glory amen they might put us out brother Jared amen because of our past but you know what they can't put us out of the book he placed it on fou before the foundation of the world and our message has declared and notified and summoned us to let us know this birth of this natural is not our first place this world is not our home and our message has notified us amen he placed it on fou and hell can't get to it and you're only here a been reflecting your inheritance over there I'm going home you know why I'm happy amen cuz I've heard it a voice I've heard a shout hey better let me know where I came from where I'm living and where I'm going back to I we've been notified by Malachi 4 amen that I came from God and I'm going back to God hallelujah do you love him what we need today is an oldfashioned Billy Sunny belly busting rip snor Revival he said the new wine when it brings Revelation revealed he said that's the way it was with Pentecost they knowed they knowed that there were supposed to be a spirit poured out and they waited till it happened that he said and when the Vindication of the Revelation took place but John if I can get a little bit more monitors just a little bit buddy I appreciate it he said he said and when the Vindication of Revelation took place it stimulation was on them I don't even think

the believer to true worship Hallelujah it causes them by faith to not look at the present tense or what's going on in the present time he said Faith doesn't really look that way Faith looks and sees what God wants and when and and works accordingly he says when you catch that faith that you're going to be healed every circumstances everything else all signs all symptoms can point that you are

clay and he placed it upon his eyes Hallelujah Christ told him to go down go wash and in the pool go down and wash he made preparation for fulfillment as he made his way down to the pool could you imagine him dipping himself down into the water and mud begin to war strong his eyes in the clay and he's Wasing it all imag I don't think he was sitting in the Church of Christ church building my personal opinion I believe he was excited and no doubt he sister s he got to Ren it more and the more he wi the more he could see and all of a sudden for the first time in his entire life his blinded

that once defeated you you you start positioning Satan where he belongs Hallelujah that's right brother Brandon is speaking cuz I I really like to hurry to get done tonight do you love him do you love me can I have five more minutes 10 I got quieter 15 when I first came out brother Mark had three water bottles up here I said good Lord he thinks I'm going to preach all night he said shangar said I'm sick and tired of it he said I'm not a warrior the odds is against me he said there's one thing I know though I'm circumcised and I am an Israelite and that is an uncircumcised foris thing and I know I I know that I'm right can I have a witness tonight claim your god-given privilege he says I I I'm out numbered I'm outclassed I'm outnumbered there's more of them than they are to me but you know what he got stimulated by Revelation he said I I know this one thing if we could have a witness of this tonight I know this one thing I'm circumcised and brother Bown said that's what we know tonight we circumcised by the Holy Spirit he said I know that I'm an Israelite and I know I'm a child of a God I'm a child of a king thank Lord I know I'm filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've let these spirits come into my my home and torment me make fun of me drive me to say things drive me to feel funny feelings about another brother another sister in the church I've allowed those spirits to come in and torment my home torment my life torment my family torment my church but shamgar got his righteous inclination built up he got so tired and sick of the enemy coming in year in and year out he'd work hard he would put up all the grain he would put up enough to get him through the year maybe make a little extra money to buy his wife some clothes and children some clothes and food on the table but here come the enemy and shamard begin to talk to himself you know what I am tired of feeling defeated every time I come to church I'm tired of letting my family down I'm tired of feeling discouraged every time I come to church I don't feel like praising him I'm tired of feeling this way about this brother this sister I'm tired and sick brother Brown says his righteous inclination got so fed up and he got mad not at an individual but the devil he said you know what this one thing I know I'm circumcised and he began to attach himself to the promise that been laying there all that time sister Debbie he let the enemy come in year in and year out and that and it's still the promise was always there but what was the difference this time he attached himself to a promise and he said I don't know I'm not a warrior I'm not a fighter I'm not nothing in a church I'm nothing but a housewife I'm just a prayer Warrior I'm just a youth leader I'm just a song leader I'm just an evangelist I'm just a deacon Church St lay member but one thing I know if God before me who can be against me tonight shapard got that same Revelation he said you a't have time to get train he just grabbed whatever he could he grabbed an old Ox go and brother Brown said claim your god-given privilege and beat their heads in amen thank you Lord get out of the way Satan kick him out of the way I'm the guy that's taking over now I come in Jesus name watch him scatter brother when you use that faith on him he will back down he will back up one thing I know little by little we're going to drive him out little by little shamgar drove him out and it so got stimulated that he began to act unseemly and he jumped out of the window and he tucked down to the enemy's gate amen and when depression came up he began to hit their heads with a little stick and a Little Rock tied to the end of it I think that's an ox gold if it isn't sounds good tonight and he took the O goat and he began and brother BR said when he struck just like he said when Moses took the rod it was no longer Moses striking he said but it was God striking and I feel that's just the way it is with you as a Believer amen when you take God at his word and he said brother B would take it and he said what do you got in your hand little David what do you got in your hand shamgar what do you got in your hand little BR it doesn't take much it takes faith and Revelation and stimulation to be Vindicated and allow you to take God at his word brother Brown said when he strugg he started diting in some heads he defeated I believe 600 Philistines with an ox go one man Invasion I say what hindered us tonight what hinders us tonight heyen if you've been fighting Devils tonight I say the Devils came to the wrong place at the wrong time tonight cuz God is in the house God is one to give it to you more than you want it Hallelujah he'll back it up when you see it come and see come and see and when you see you'll understand when you understand you'll know that the enemy is already defeated can I go on just a little bit more is my five minutes up I had an amen and a no I don't know how to take that let's turn to my other favorite scripture 1st Samuel 17 32 we'll close on this because I got a couple quotes I'd like to read with this it said David said unto Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go fight with the philistine and Saul said to David thou not not able to go against him Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said to Saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear and he took a lamb out of the flock and he went out after him I smoted him I delivered him out of his mouth and when he rose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised for this thing shall be as one of them see he has the file of the armies of a living God I say the Devils have done that today and the devil said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the pa the lion and out of the pa the bear will deliver me out of the of the hand of the Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee and Saul armored David with his armor and put a helmet of brass upon his head and he armed him with a coat of mail and David GED his sword upon his armor and and say to go for it has not been proved it David said to sa I cannot go with this for I have not proved them and David put them off and he tuck his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and he put it in his Shepherd's bag brother Brown said had honey in it my and he said God down there and even in his scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew nigh unto the Philistine and the Philistine came and Drew nigh un David and the man that bore his shield went before him when the Philistine looked about and saw David and disdained him for he was yet a youth and Ruddy and a fair countenance and Philistine said unto David am I a dog that thou comest me with th and Philistine cursed th David by his gods and fisting said to David come to me I'll give thy flesh and the fowls of the air and the Beast of the field he was only hoping then said David to philistin thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear with a sword but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel who thou has defiled and brother B said hang on I'll come back to that scripture he said and Little David standing there with a little piece of leather and goat stand a sheep skin with two pieces of string tided it but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him the god that tuck me out of the paws of the bear took me out of the paws of Lyon how much more would deliver this uncircum Philistine in my hand his brothers War way more able to do it Saul was Head and Shoulders above him but you see it wasn't revealed to them he said there it is they believed it could be done they believed that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to Little David now there's the difference Hallelujah Saul had more military Saul was a lot bigger his army was greater but it wasn't revealed to him David was a little fella brother said may walk five foot something little Ruddy shrimp of a guy couldn't fight his way out of wet paper bag Goliath was a had a head like a war tub big huge giant that's never lost a battle never tasted defeat every time he made a boast he was able to back it up but he came in contact with God's anointing Hallelujah don't do them no harm amen and when he begin to burst about Bo about the what he was going to do with David amen David's response was quick you come to me with a sword in the spear you come to me with hope but I come with you by by Revelation by Vindication he's already delivered a lamb out of the mouth of a lion by my bare hands I know he's a true God and my God Is Bigger my God Is Bigger come on Hallelujah he said but you see it wasn't revealed to them amen there it is but it was revealed to David he said if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get it he said I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds is it may be worse than David Goliath but if it's revealed to you notice when when it's revealed David become Fearless when it was revealed David become Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off Hallelujah and Har he went up there just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could why he said by faith he saw the victory Goliath was still standing there but by faith we see the victory tonight I say your Mountain sister Vanna may be still standing there but I know one thing my God is bigger than your mountain and if you will just seek it by Revelation then you might that thing might have been getting the best of for a long time but now you can become Fearless goad vict now you can go ahead and dance that's what David the scripture said David R to the battle sa of them was running they was cowards they went back to Camp they was afraid but the anointed the anointed of David he was stimulated ated amen he was energized he was faithful he believed he already saw the victory he already seen Goliath laying on the ground defeated that's what Revelation is aen it's hard it's it stimulates you to see something amen that your natural flesh can't see but Faith declare it's already done the battle is over and the victory has been won so you can imagine David's mentality when he was walking down there and he reached down at O Creek bed and picked up those five stones and he put them in the shepherd bag and he begin to run he begin to run down to the enemy's Camp he said this day will can you say will the Lord deliver thee into my hand I will smite thee I'll take the head from thee I'll give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know there is a God of Israel and all the s should know the Lord savior not with a sword and a spear for the battle is the Lord he will give you into my hands what victory [Applause] what big old Goliath still standing there he's got his sword and Spears and Shields and armor and the fact of the matter is brother Vernon he only had one spot open and David within himself couldn't hit it and fearless David ran towards Goliath can I go ahead and read it it came to pass when the philistin arose let that devil raise his head again tonight and came Drew nigh unto you that you David hasten can we have some stimulated Believers in the building tonight he got stimulated at haston and ran toward the Army to meet the philistine and David put his hand David put his hand in his script back and he took out a stone and he put it in two little straps brother Bobby and he began to I'm having a good time tonight you know what the camp to Church world out there looking some what is David doing what does Joe Bo trigger think he's doing up there he's nothing but the youth this guy's a giant he's never lost to battle and they're looking and they've never SE theyve never seen such Revival they've never seen such stimulation they never seen such a ruddy fell running to meet his enemy but I can see David just running with everything in him went just begin to and he let it go then here come the wind of Yahweh same God [Music] Toni and he picked that stone up and it went from everybody be able to see it gold the very next thing they seen was a giant stumbling oh I can see him tonight come on somebody oh giant that's been hindering them and keeping them from worshiping keep them from dancing keep him from shouting keep him from praising keep him from worshiping amen that un circumcised phis thing that's never lost the battle is now losing all all ability to stand he's dizzy headed he's lost his balance he can't only keep himself up any longer Hallelujah and that devil that giant Begin to Fall upon the ground and he hit and maybe it shook the whole Camp of Israel and every one of them was looking out and seeing what God was doing and David continue to run now we're finding a Gody that not just saying what he's seen by Revelation he's preparing himself for fulfillment he's running down Heen he takes the enemy sword David can't lift the enemy sword on his own ability but he's stimulated heated by Revelation he's acted unse he can't behave himself any longer and en's laying there goes over and picks his sword up and he Pi it up over his come feel his on the Pinnacle and he lifts it up for the you you scers you unbelievers one thing I know this one thing I know your enemy is [Applause] De Drew courage oh oh we have the same same same line in this hour our Jesus Christ hung Between Heaven and Earth and he held up the head of Goliath and he said there's one thing I know it is finished Hallelujah and I know because I know brings Liberty and he said and there went David just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could why because Faith he saw the victory brother Joe I don't believe it was just a dance in a church building I believe he was dancing over circumstances he was dancing over Goliath he was dancing over feelings he was dancing over emotions he was dancing over circumstances I say we can be the same way tonight there's one thing I know there this thing and one thing I know tonight there ain't no devil there ain't no Giants going to get my praise tonight they ain't no Rock going to take my place tonight I don't know what you come to do tonight I know what I came to do and that's the praise the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he's never lost a battle Hallelujah and he's the same God tonight if you'll let that stone go God will pick the stone up and speed it up a thousand miles per second and he will hit the Kill Zone 100 out of 100 times every time he never misses there's one thing I know my God is faithful there's one thing I know tonight I once was blind but now I see one thing I know tonight the devil once had me I was in
