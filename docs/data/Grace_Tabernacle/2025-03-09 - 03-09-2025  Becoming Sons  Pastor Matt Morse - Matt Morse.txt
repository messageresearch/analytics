there was a baby that was let go that had been there for 100 I think it was 146 days and the doctor has talked to them she says I don't know what or he said I don't know what it is there's so many babies with cleft pallet she says but your baby looks perfectly normal she he said I don't even know that she has the cleff pallet until I look into her mouth and so we're just thanking God that he

amen isn't it wonderful to serve a god that is made a way that we could come and be able to serve him openly and my that we could come and worship the Lord how many love the Lord this morning I it feels good to be in the house of God and I I told brother Donnie when he spoke last Sunday that we may just take a little clip of that and play it before every service when he got into how that we didn't come to church to be entertained but we come to church to entertain him I thought I needed to hear that how many come to church this morning with that on your heart we come to entertain the entertain our lord lord we come to give back to you oh my we just love the Lord and just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord and just a wonderful atmosphere this morning and I believe that God is more than able I believe he orchestrates all things I don't believe it's by coincidence that we're here this morning or that God didn't know who would be here and who wouldn't and some would be sick some be out traveling God knows all things and here we are this morning trusting that the Lord is that kind of a God Amen if it wasn't for that how could we serve him but we serve him because he is that kind of a god he's omnipotent he's omnipresent amen we still believe that you believe that this morning man we just love the Lord appreciate uh brother Ben and leading the songs enjoyed those specials and uh we just uh over the past um few months brother Ben's been helping out on Wednesday nights and leading songs and uh just done a tremendous job a young man that uh I believe that the Lord had put a had sent him here to be a help to the church and uh and may just used Haven to get to make it happen but uh but but in his but not in his heart I can say this about brother Ben he's not that kind of a of a guy that would go somewhere without a leading of the Lord so uh the reality is is that God made it happen and so we sure appreciate him and and uh just want to he's been kind of taking the secondary role on on leading songs brother Mark's been the primary and uh and since brother Mark started leading songs it's always been on his heart just to be able to fill in in that area until we found somebody that or the Lord would bring some somebody that could uh take that role and and uh and so you know brother Ben's kind of moved into that and so we're going to uh instead of him being the secondary and brother Mark being the primary brother Ben will be the primary and brother Mark said he don't care to uh take and help out you know where is needed secondary and and uh it allows him to go minister in some places on Sunday mornings so he's out this morning preaching at Salem so uh we just want to give them the Liberty to do that and and to continue uh to grow in in the church and go in the direction that God leads us to go and so uh we both felt like that was that would be the best thing for the church and moving forward and so he uh certainly would be able to to fill in and and uh so we just want to support uh him in that and support brother Ben now I'll tell you there's no there's no Miracle Song leader uh you can you can get the best one there is but without a people that come to entertain the Lord uh it sure makes his job hard so uh we just want to help brother Ben and support him in that and of course I know everybody saw that coming over the past few months many people have asked me about it and kind of felt like that was the direction uh that we were all planning on going and and me and mother brother Mark's been talking about it for a long time and so uh but we want we want everything to be done in God's time and so we don't ever want to rush into anything but we want we want God to be able to lead us and so we appreciate how many appreciate brother brother Ben anden and amen and brother Mark ain't here to brag on but we sure appreciate him and uh so he's he's certainly labored a lot for us and man he's he's made a he's made a lot of uh uh sacrifices and and has you know with his voice and teaching and uh he he teaches uh teaches school now and so every day he's doing that and and it really just makes it hard on him and so we uh we just we just appreciate uh that all that he has done in that in that uh area uh and so we just look forward to uh the Lord using him in his ministry and things like that so will you love the Lord this morning amen I want you to reach around and Shake somebody's hand and tell them to welcome them in the house of the Lord and my sure good to be able to be in the presence of God Amen Let the worshippers arise let the sons and daughters sing I surrendering my all I'm surrendered to the king yes let the worshippers arise let the sons and daughters sing I'm surrendering my all yes Lord I surrender to the king father I see that you are drawing a Line in the Sand I want to be standing by your side holding your hand so let your kingom come let it live in me this is my my prayer this is my plea let the worshippers arise let the sons and daughters sing yes I'm surrendering my all oh I surrender to the king father I hear it growing louder the song of your redeem has the bride out of every nation we are Awakening to sing from our hearts there comes an Anthem oh hear the Praises Ring this is our song I sing to my king let the worshippers arise let the sons and daughters sing it's time surrendering my all I surrender to the king amen won't you give him another hand clap of Praise this morning W what an opportunity we have to surrender to the King of Kings how many can say that this morning I I Surrender my heart and my life and Lord we just want to surrender this time to you allow you to come and have your way in this service we surrender to our King amen if you just want to Bow your heads a moment and before we get into the word and just maybe just approach the Lord and ask him that he would come maybe something's on your heart and that you need from the Lord I believe that God is certainly mindful of what we have need of and so why don't you just ask him to come and invite him to into this service to minister to our hearts God knows all that we have need of remember in prayer Little Don had asked for prayer for her mom and dad was uh sick this morning so just remember them in prayer also sister Joy is uh going in on Tuesday uh to have a blazion on her heart so just want to uh keep her in prayer as well if you have a need just lift your hand to the Lord won't we each one just take a moment and invite him into this place let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege it is to serve you Lord to be able to stand in your presence Lord and God just to walk in this building Lord and to know that you're present Among Us Lord we're so thankful Lord that you're mindful of us and our failures and mistakes God we never want to fail to give you the glory for what you do for us Lord and God how that you've been so good to us and Lord and we just ask you that you would help us this morning God I pray Lord that you would move among your children Lord I pray you would speak to every heart Lord and let every need be met Lord we come to hear from Thy word Lord but we don't just want to read a letter Lord and but God we want it to come to life and Lord that's our prayer Lord is that this word would come alive in every heart and God that we would be written Epistles Lord and God living Epistles Lord that was read and known of all men and Lord let us fulfill that word today God we ask you now heal those that are sick Lord lift those that need lifting Lord this morning and we'll be careful to give you the glory for all you do in Jesus name we pray amen amen we just uh want to invite you to the Bible we're going to read out of Galatians the 4th chapter and we'll start in the first verse and um to give you a moment just to get there last uh Sunday while we were speaking or the Sunday before the meetings we had been speaking on uh Abraham's heirs and um and and my I just thought I I don't know how I'm sure you all did but whenever the meeting started uh brother Josh Bennett come right out and and started preaching on how God deals with us as sons and uh them those Brothers got right in the middle of our series and and I I trust them well enough to know they weren't out there listening to it it's just the way it's just what God is doing so how many enjoyed that and just the the meetings was just a a special uh time and just to see as brother Josh dealt with that and then brother Wayne came in and and and brought the Revelation that even in the fault of our flesh that we were still yet uh sons of God and there was Grace for this this dirt of Flesh that we uh live in and then brother Donnie uh came in and just so so masterfully spoke and uh I just uh I just about had a Runway when he started taking the stature of a perfect man and building it out of the garden of Solomon I thought man isn't that isn't that something that here that uh to be able to recognize who you are and how that it changes your language and and uh you know I told brother Donnie he did he didn't know this before he came but uh since it's just home folk now I don't care to say it but uh you know me and my wife was reading that we read that whole entire uh book of the Bible just a few days before the meeting and and uh and I told him later I said brother you you got all over me cuz what started that is uh my wife was sitting there and in the in the living room and I looked over at her we were there by herself and that you know the Sun comes through our our window pretty harsh and and uh she was sitting there in that sunlight and brother Wes I looked over and I said babe I said your teeth are like a flock of sheep that have never been shorn and none of them were Barren and they all had twins and she said well that what in the world I said I'm trying to give you a compliment she said well that's the that's the worst compliment I've ever got I've ever got I said well it's in the Bible and she said I had never heard that so we went over the song of solom and I started reading that's what got us to that scripture and and I I I wasn't sure where it was so I read the first chapter and then read the next chapter out loud and I was trying to show her where I had got this charm from and and uh and and as I read through it then we got a little got the talking about how that the bride kept talking back to the groom and how that she talked about herself and in it was in a negative light but after a little while she started uh her language changing and she started talking to him and saying about herself s the very language that he used about her and so here me and Sarah just went on had a had a wonderful time in in that study and I even made some notes on it I said well that that'd make a good sermon here he come in and and took a a miniseries on and I said well I guess it did and he got a lot more out of it than the than I than I had anticipated getting so I I I sure appreciate what the Lord had done and y'all forgive me for being a little bit funny this morning but uh but but I I appreciate what what what God done and just uh uh just uh uh take and and and to lead the church in this way I certainly don't want to repr preach those Brothers messages but uh I do want to continue down this path that we have been on in this study uh and and trust that we're getting somewhere it's not we don't just uh preach something uh just to uh just to make a um a subject or something like that but it's really what God put on our heart in the direction that we feel to go so I want to read this morning out of Galatians the 4th chapter I'll start in the first verse the Bible says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons I love love that part and because you are Sons then God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if you're a son then you're an heir of God through Christ Jesus and I want to take this this morning and speak if we have a title on becoming sons and we'll just allow you to take your seats on becoming Sons now we realize that here that when a chapter turns uh when Paul wrote this letter to the Galatians it wasn't in chapter and verse form it was just a letter uh and so when Paul goes from uh This Promise or the air according uh to Abraham's seed he went right over into the next uh uh paragraph and he began to speak about us being sons of God and and of course during this series in Galatians 3 we had take that first service on on the seed of faith and how that we were the children of God and we were of the seed line of Abraham and and uh and that that seed line of Abraham was not just the natural seed or or the seed where it came from Abraham down to Isaac and Jacob whose name became Israel it's the it's what most of the Old Testament in the uh the natural aspect of it is written about it's of the nation of Israel and their rise and how that God called them and placed them and uh took them through so many things and brought them uh brought them in and out of out of the state of bondage and Rose them up as a nation and and and so we realize but it wasn't just about the natural but it was also about the spirit spiritual it was talking about the church today and so we realize that today we're not uh it wasn't just of the natural seed but it was of a spiritual seed or this Faith Seed of Abraham and uh Paul would say like this he said for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so here Paul would show us that this Abraham seed was not just something in history uh but it was speaking of Jesus Christ here he was the first born he was Abraham SE how many believe that say amen he he was Abraham's seed But Not only was he just Abraham's seed but Paul said he was the firstborn in other words there's many that would come after him so uh and I'll just say this this morning that Jesus he didn't just become the Son of God when he was born of Mary he didn't become the Son of God because of his natural birth and uh you know but but it was actually this seed of faith and the and the Bible says and many will follow after him I I know that many uh uh today that will preach that that way and say well Jesus he he was born as the Son of God and he became the Son of God when he was born in a manger but I actually don't believe that and I don't believe the Bible teaches it because the Bible says this when it talks about Jeremiah the prophet remember what God said he said I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb even John the Baptist when he would talk about John the Baptist 700 years before John the Baptist ever walked upon the Earth the Bible said he remember Isaiah he said he is the voice of one that is crying in the wilderness so before this man ever walked in the wilderness before he ever baptized the first one Isaiah had already spoke of him because he God already knew him he was already a part of God he was already a Son of God he was already in the mind of God even when it came to Jesus but said Jesus Christ was the son of God before the foundation of the world he was the woman's seed that was to bruise the Serpent's head that you read about in The Book of Genesis so so he wasn't he didn't become the Son of God In A Manger he didn't become the Son of God when he was born on the Earth he was the son of God before the foundation of the world he always was the son of God and so here you see he was in the father he was a part of the father and then he was expressed on the earth as an attribute of the father just like you and I as a brother would speak the other day that we come from our father we were in the gene of our father and we come from God we were always a part of God we may came to this earth and we were born in this flesh body but our birth upon this Earth was only to express an attribute of God so we were in the mind of God brother Wester you were a part of God isn't it something that you can go around this world today and six billion people live upon this Earth and not one or not two of them are exactly alike what are they doing but here we are expressions of almighty God where it's something that God had in his mind my friends we could never draw it we could never we could never make something that way but the mind of God Is So vast and here God wants to express himself in so many ways and so here we come today as an expression of the mind of God now we realize that here that seed of faith it carried on into this day and because of who we are think about it because of who we are then we had a mediator which was Jesus Christ and he came and he stood between us in judgment and he redeemed us from that Old curse which was the law that would cause us to go into death because we couldn't uphold the law but he redeemed us from the curse of death and he gave us everlasting life now Paul showed this he showed how that the Covenant with Abraham that it wasn't based on works but it was then he then he went and he proved it by showing that Abraham was called righteous before he ever made an act of obedience remember it's a couple weeks I'm just giving a little refresher a background so brother man would say it like this he says so God has made this Covenant by himself he put it to Abraham he gave it to Abraham not if Abraham would do anything but but God said I have already done it he said see therefore it is a finished thing friends this is one of the greatest Revelations that you can ever catch that it isn't something that you do but it's something that God has already done so many people fail to be Christians they fail to serve God they fail to come to church why because they get to a place where they don't feel like that they can do it or they don't have the ability but here the prophet of God said it wasn't something that You' done it was something that God done it wasn't based on your ability it was based on his ability it wasn't based on your worthiness it was on his worthiness he said it's a finished thing it's completely and holy with Grace it ain't on no conditions at all it's God's covenant with Abraham and what Paul say he said Not only was it to Abraham but it was to his seed after him so Not only was this promise given to Abraham But Here Comes Jesus Christ who was the first born among many Brethren and here that will come after him those that have the same faith that Abraham had to believe a promise of God that you're saved by the grace of God that you're saved beyond your own understanding that you're saved beyond your ability but there's a faith that lies within us that causes us to be able to believe that very promise of God and it brings it to pass in our life Paul said that which was outwardly is not the seed of God but that which was inwardly is Abraham's seed it wasn't the flesh born it wasn't the the carryover from Isaac and Jacob on down but it was the inward man that was Abraham's seed he said and we being dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed and we are hes according to the promise of God somebody say I'm an heir am we are hes according to the promise of God he said see now the reason we're called Abraham's seed is because Abraham's seed physically was speaking to Isaac onto Christ that Christ came and then he gave his life as a ransom to us and he sent forth the Holy Spirit back which gives us the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised so here the Holy Spirit would come that would give you the faith to be able to believe the promise of God see my isn't that good not only did he he say that you have to believe it then God is going to send something to the church that would cause you to be able to believe it so see it ain't even on my own will it ain't all my own belief or how good I can believe or how strong of a believer that I can be but he said but God is going to send the Holy Spirit which would allow you to be able to believe it it it's what gives us the faith that Abraham had that we could Believers for the Bible said he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he said and notice then God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirm or the recognition of his faith and today when we believe God with all of our heart and we accept his son the Lord Jesus God recognizes that that faith is true in him and then he sends back down the Holy Spirit of promise and he seals us until the day of our Redemption now that'll make a country boy want to shout that he seals us you know what it means to be sealed it means that there there ain't nothing can get in it when you that means that it can't be it can't be Mish handled it can't be mixed it can't be lost oh friends let me tell you something we're talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ and the this bride that's going to go into the Rapture the the one that will never go through a tribulation this body of this body of Believers that is called the bride it's a collective body around the world it's a many membered bride it's made up of the sons and the daughters of God now I don't want you to confuse this term can I just lay this in here just a minute but when you hear the term the bride of Christ it's referring to the col Collective body of Believers as individuals we're sons and we're Daughters of God but as a body we're the bride for a time for a time we were called the church but when when the when the prophet came he said now he said I call you bride in other words this was a true church it was a spiritual body of Believers so it doesn't mean you're not sons of God and you're not Daughters of God you're still a son and you're still a daughter but as a body collectively we are called The Bride of Jesus Christ This is a spiritual church the one that Christ would have a union with you know why he would have to do that because there's a whole world full of churches but he wanted to make sure that the that that that the devil understood but this one belongs to me it ain't this church building it ain't Grace Tabernacle it's a ACC cumulative body of Believers around the world that has been called to this very thing they were a part of God in the mind of God before the foundation of the world let me tell you something about this church it's not a church that you can join there's a lot of churches that you can join you can become members you can put your name on the book but this is a church the only way you'll get into it is if you're born again you had to be born it come you can come into it by a new birth and then he said then he sends down his holy spirit of promise and he seals us until the day of redemption you know what that tells me this bride church is sealed in with God and the world is sealed on the outside my but think about it that we've been sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise oh you think about what it means to be sealed in with God that means the world ain't got no way in it means the devil ain't got no way in let me tell you friend sometimes he may get on your flesh sometime you may get anointed In the Flesh and it causes you to act out and it causes you to fall on your face and it causes you to do things that you should not do but it has nothing to do with the Seal of God that is upon your life you may fall you may fail you may go months down the road that you ain't what you're supposed to be but it has nothing to do with a seal of God that is upon your life let me tell you why God does he had to make it that you can make it he had to make it that in the midst of our failures in the midst of our flesh that God could steal that his purpose would still come to pass we've been sealed in with God isn't that what happened the first time there was a judgment I may as well preach the first time there was a judgment upon the Earth was in the days of Noah you know what God told Noah to do he said build an ark out of go for wood and then I want you to seal it on the outside and seal it on the in and he took that old tar pitch and he put it on the inside and out that it could flow through the waters of judgment and the Judgment can never can never penetrate those that were on the inside cuz they were sealed in God he said he sent us a Hool my good he sent us a holy spirit of promise that would seal you in that means the devil ain't got nothing to do with it he can drag you around and beat you around all he wants to but let God speak to you this morning but there comes a seal of God upon your life and the devil can't touch you no more it's a revelation this was Paul's message to Galatians listen he said that receiving the holy spirit is a sign of true faith in Jesus Christ it's not a result of following after the law to receive this it comes from faith it comes from having faith in Jesus Christ so it doesn't matter whatever we go through it doesn't matter whatever works we do but by the only way you'll ever be a child of God Is by faith so see this is this is Paul's message but remember said it's a keynote to the scriptures that Faith he cometh he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him for without faith it is impossible to please God so Paul said by faith we're sons of God see said it's always Faith this world was made by faith the things that were shaped were were made into existence by faith but God seen out there a DW drop hanging in the air and he spoke and he said let there be light and there was light and then he brought the land forth and he dried it off and and so forth and all of that was done by an Act of Faith with God the whole world is made by faith you're here today by faith see we're the faith children somebody say faith children children you're a child of God by faith I feel like preaching you're a child of God by faith it's not something you can work into I know I know I've been on this for a while but there's a reason you're a child of God by faith you have to get that old teaching out of your mind where somebody had made such a law that you have that that that this law was going to save you and today you're saved and tomorrow you're lost and the the next day you're saved and the next day you're lost again but that ain't got nothing to do with it you're saved by faith in Jesus Christ said it was an Act of Faith the whole world was made by faith we're Faith children we have faith that God accepts our sacrifice we have faith that God accepts our worship we have faith how do you know God accepts your worship how do you know God accepts your sacrifice or it's a sweet smell and SA of God if it isn't by faith that's all we have but by faith we believe that God accepts it by faith we worship God that God accepts our worship by faith we he hears our prayer by faith he hears our repentance but remember said there's only two things that every person in this world would live by it's either Faith or unbelief there ain't no halfway between there's no drunk sober man there's no black white birds there's no sinner Saint you're either born again or you're not born again either you believe or you don't believe how many say I believe I believe by Faith by faith we're Believers Romans 4 he said for if they which are of the law be The Heirs hear me now if they which are of the law be The Heirs then faith is made void right and the promise is made of none effect so if the law made you an heir of God then all that God done to Abraham had no purpose listen what Paul's saying he said because the law workers Works Wrath and where there is no law there is no transgression my goodness see if there's no law how would you do any wrong you're only wrong because the law said it was wrong Paul said where there is no law there's no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace now watch he shows us why he says to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of all he says see to the end that the promise might be sure now you think about this word that Paul uses the promise would be sure you know if you ever if you go out and you take out a loan or maybe some of you maybe done a big construction job or a contract or something like that when you do a big job a lot of times when you go out to do it they will they will ask you uh uh you know to to make sure that you have the money to do the job so or or to make sure you have the ability to perform the contract so they'll ask you to have a shity or a bond that would back up the contract that you're making so that just in case something would happen to you you're or you failed halfway through the job or you didn't finish or something or you couldn't afford to get it all done well so so they require assurity or bond that they're going to pay out money up front to make sure that everything got done uh according to the contract see so assurity is a promise or or an agreement that is made by one that that that that debts and financial obligations will be paid in other words assurity acts as a guarantee on the cont contract see so if you can't meet the requirements then the shity will guarantee to step in and cover where the default is oh friends listen while Paul used this word he said that the promise might be made sure in other words there had to be an insurance on the promise of God or there there had to be can I say it like this an assurance on the promise of God so here God gave a promise to Abraham and he said we received the Promise by faith but Grace was assurity upon the promise of God so here God made a promise that he's going to have a seed there'll be a faith seed and here that this is the inheritance that the that those heirs are going to receive he said but then I want to make sure that there's something that'll back up that contract he said so Grace became the shity of the contract of God oh friend don't you realize what God done he put up a sacrifice that was greater than any sacrifice that the law would ever require the very requirements of the law were met by this sacrifice that God made the the very thing that it demanded God met it friends even in our best effort when we would try to find our uh try to do our best sometimes we find ourselves in default somebody say hello somebody say Amen sometimes we find oursel in default but let me tell you this morning that we have assurity upon the promise of God sometimes you feel like it don't belong to you no more sometimes you feel like that you're not a part of it but I thank God that Paul said but God put assurity upon his promise that when you're in default and when you fail and you that that that he would give you Grace that you could receive it by faith oh my friends now think about it when we mess up we can't pray enough to fix it we can't sacrifice enough to make it right we can't fast enough to feel God anymore it feels like we pray and nothing takes place and all of a sudden we feel like everything in our life that we've defaulted on the promise of God or defaulted on the Covenant that God made with us but friends even in our default I thank God this morning that I have assurity that was given by God I have a Blessed Assurance F let God say it this morning when I feel like I'm in default when I feel like I'm overspent when I've over promised when I can't get the job done when I failed in my abilities when I failed in my works I'm about to lose all that I have but friends you me tell you what you do when you're in default you pick up God's contract and you read the shity bond that is lying on the inside of it you find that portion and you begin to read it like Paul said he said oh my I feel like preaching this morning when you're in default somebody read the shity Paul said what shall we say then to these things for if God be for us who can be against us I found my shity right in the middle of a contract oh brother Matt I'm in default but if God before us then who can be against us I don't think I can make it another day well he spared not his own son but he delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also freely give us all things oh I'm not worthy to be able to receive anything from God but who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifi this is our shity whenever we can't do it by our faith our faith is weak or our abilities fail and we find oursel in theault he said who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather it is he that rose again who is even at the right hand of God and he's making intercession for us somebody say for me it's Christ that died it's Christ that hung on Calvary it's Christ that shed his blood it's Christ that said it is finished and it's Christ that's sitting on the right hand of the father making intercession for you it's your shity who shall separate us can I read another a little bit who shall separate us from the love of Christ who then can separate me from the love of Christ I have assurity I feel good shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine nakedness or Peril or sword Paul said nay but in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor he nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord it's ass shity upon the promise of God now I thank God we have a shity bond this morning listen what Paul was speaking this was so powerful because here as he's dealing with these two covenants the Covenant of Law and Grace here here he would he would point out showing us that right in the middle of the law of Moses y'all remember me quoting this last time in the middle of the law of Moses god actually showed Israel that the abrahamic Covenant superseded the law or the Covenant with Moses or the Mosaic Covenant here because remember when Moses come down from the mountain they were waiting on the law of God he came down in the Book of Leviticus is the written law of God that came from Moses so this is Mosaic Covenant but here in the middle of that Mosaic Covenant when you get to reading it it says if you if you fail here you'll be cursed if you mess up here this is the curse that'll come upon your life this will be carried from generation to generation this we this one will cause you to be an outcast and here all the way down I'm I'm I'm skipping through a bunch but all the way down here it shows the curse that comes because we broke the law but listen but right in the middle of that very law there lays a treasure here what is it it's the shity bond that God put upon his word right in the middle of the law in Leviticus 26 he said but if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespass against me and they walk contrary to me I walk contrary to them I brought them in the land of their enemies he said but yet for all of that when they be in the land of their enemies I will not cast them away neither will I abore them or destroy them utterly and to break my Covenant with them for I am the Lord their God God said I will remember my Covenant even in the law of Moses he said but don't forget I'll remember my Covenant I made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob what it's assurity upon the upon the word of God in the midst of the law that the Covenant of Grace still stands see because of this abrahamic Covenant God think of it because of it God is faithful to see it through in the midst of the law Grace abounds Grace is the shity that the purpose of God comes to pass it's the shity that God's purpose listen friends Grace is the shity that God's purpose is fulfilled in your life we all needed it it's the only thing that can make sure that God's purpose is fulfilled that's why Paul would say Abra Abraham's seed we're Abraham's seed and we're HS according to the promise of God and God made it sure now notice what Paul says in Galatians 4 And1 he said now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be the Lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father I'll take just a minute think here what Paul is speaking of you remember in the old time in the Old Testament here a father would have a great Kingdom or lands and maybe hundreds of Acres that he would he would possess and here he would live up on this land and and many houses and things that would be around and those that would take care of the land and and you know people would actually seek out Refuge from someone that had had that a place to be able to stay and live and work and and and to be able to provide for their family and so here this father that would have these great things but uh but when a child was born into his own home you think of of how and he and he was the parent uh when it was born that this child when he was born he was always a child of this father even at his birth and this is where the Pentecostal churches have missed so many things that that he was a child when he was born he was already a child this was his this was he was B he was birthed as a child he was in his father before he was born he was in the gene of his father he came into the world but whenever he came to this place of birth that noticed because of the father having so many things to do and maybe handling all of this great business and all all that he had that the father he wouldn't have time to spend dayto day teaching the son and raising him and showing him all the ways and so he would go out and he would find a teacher or someone that had the ability as a tutor that that Paul would call it he would he would bring him in to teach the the the child and to raise him up and and to teach him the ways of the father and show him uh what would be pleasing to the father and show him how that the father would handle his business so whenever when he would uh go and buy things and make purchases and sell and and so all of this was taught by the by the teacher and so here he would he would raise him up so here when he was born he was a child but he would but but as he was raised up when he would get to a certain place then he would take on the responsibilities that the father had see he had to he had to come to this uh this place uh of adoption that Paul would speak of or or this place of maturity so we realized that he would come to this adoption ceremony and then he would have the authority then he'd have the father's ring he'd be able to make a a sign or make the seal because he had been an adopted son he was always a son but then he became an adopted son because he came to this place of maturity and so we realize but say see what a beautiful picture that is of God and his church he said our father sent to us the church he sent us a tutor or a teacher and God found the best tutor that there was in heaven and he put it over his church it was the Holy Spirit and the church was not to be raised on intellectual or to or to be tutored by uh denomination but it was to be tutored by the Holy Ghost this is God's teacher this is what God sent to the church to bring it to a place of maturity now now notice what Paul said he said but it is under the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so here he said you were born you were already born a child but you're but you're no different than a servant because a child don't have the ability to make decisions so he just goes around I mean you think about what a kid does he have chores and you know they they just go around do the chores and sometimes that's what our kids feel like I I'm preaching to somebody you boys may as well say Amen but sometimes yeah thank you buddy sometimes it just feels like you're just a servant you're you're just doing all the chores you got to take out the trash you got to sweep the room you you know you it just seems like it's all chores but Paul said but that's that's the way it is he said a child is is no different than a servant until he under tutors and governors until he comes to this place of adoption and then all of a sudden he has responsibility and then he becomes a a head of a home and so so but but but in the spiritual side Paul say see so here we're under tutors and governors until the time that is appointed of the father now you watch what Paul does is in in Romans the 8th chapter he would speak on this subject again he said the earnest expectation of the creature which was the earth wait is waits for the manifestation of the sons of God now is that not is that not just what Paul's talking about in The Book of Galatians he's talking about the sons of God being manifested the earth is waiting on them to come to this to come to this place so we realize that what Paul is showing us in Romans 8 that a f the fullness of adoption is the Redemption of our body so you won't be you'll never have that uh the the fullness of that until our body is redeemed he said that's what the earth is waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God but said like this he said see God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that that that will that when the church in Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture so here what is the fullness of the adoption it's the time of harvest in other words it's the time when the bride would come to the place of maturity now I know some whenever you say this and you talk about the church coming to a place of maturity a lot of times people take that as a negative thing that that that you're saying well we're not mature or the bride is not mature enough to go into the Rapture but or or that nobody has IM maturity but but but it's not that at all it's not a it's not a negative thing because you know you you can't say well the the everybody nobody's mature because we're still here but it but it doesn't mean that there's none in the body that are mature but can I say it like this remember what Jesus said when the last one comes in then we'll go think about it no man knoweth the hour or the date or the hour except except for the father so he he's the one that knows the time when the bride would come to this place of maturity so we see how what what this is showing us is can can I just say it like this if you had a field of wheat out there growing and and when the the if you know anything about farms and you go around maybe looking at some of these soybean Fields you'll notice when you go by when it comes to the time of maturity and some of this crop becomes mature that all around the edges of the of the crop and and and in other places there's a lot that are still not there yet there's a lot of small growth and maybe maybe something had stuned the growth or maybe it it was it was under something else but but do you realize that the farmer is actually watching the field the farmer don't set a specific date and say on this day that I'm going to come on this day I'm going to make a Harvest on this y'all get everybody prepared cuz this is the day that the Harvest is going to come but the farmer don't do it that way but in actually the farmer is watching the field and the maturity of the crop and when the crop comes to a place of maturity it's actually the maturity of the field that determines when the farmer comes so here this is what God knows because God is an eternal God but this is also what God is waiting on he's waiting on the mature maturity of the crop to come to this place so that's the same way it is with the bride of Jesus Christ there's many that are mature there's many that they they could go uh right now they're they're at a place that that that that that that's where God needs us to get to but then there's many that are still green can I say it that way there's many that there's many that that uh uh that that that that is waiting on this and you realize that it's the maturity of this body of Believers is what CED the resurrection can I say that again the maturity of the Bride is what calls the resurrection it's waiting on the bride to come to this place of maturity see whenever you think of this this way that the maturity of the Bride is what is going to bring the resurrection all of a sudden going to church has a purpose all of a sudden preaching has a purpose that we're not just coming here to get by to go to another service but spending time in prayer it has a purpose because we're trying to bring the people to a place of maturity that the Rapture can take place we're waiting on the resurrection is waiting on the maturity of the Bride ofes Jesus Christ so how all of a sudden it has a purpose going and witnessing to somebody and help them grow it has a purpose sharing the word of God like Philip did when he went to the unit and he and he spoke to him God's word until a revelation could strike his heart it has a purpose friends don't you realize we're not just here to have church we're not just here to build a a tabernacle we're not here to take turns preaching we're not here to pass the time until we die we're here or to satisfy somebody's feelings but we're here to come to a place of maturity that it would call upon the resurrection of Jesus Christ this is what the church is here that's why we come to church to bring this portion of the field to the place of harvest that's our purpose at Grace Tabernacle to bring our portion of the field to the place of harvest that's my purpose as a pastor we got a portion of the field you know what you know what you see many times you look how some have been growing in the sun and it looks like my what in the world would be holding that up and and there ain't nothing that's holding it up you you're you're where you need to be but he ain't going to pick one here and then pick one another day and pick one in the Rapture but when the Rapture goes the whole bride goes so see so he's waiting on this church to come to a place of maturity but you know what sometimes maybe portions can I just say it like this maybe portions maybe portions of it has grown under the shadow of some some tree or something you know that's what happens sometimes you grew up under the shadow of something else or some great theology or some something that would overshadow the crop and would keep it from coming to the place of maturity maybe there's some over there that's already in the Sun but you've been kept out of the sun too long but you me tell you what we're doing we're coming into the church we come in the presence of God we take the message of the hour we preach it to the people so that you can get in the presence of the S Soom that the maturity of the Bride of Jesus Christ would come to its place so we come to church to get in the presence of God until the revelation of God's work and strick your heart and you come to a place of maturity that's why we're here to come to this place see but Paul says but it had to come in God's appointed time this adoption it's in a it's a time appointed of the father 1954 prophet of Goa say this and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God the sons of God are led by the spirit of God I love it how people twist that scripture I don't love it but but TW they they twist it and say well I'm a Son of God so no matter what I do I can say it's the spirit of God cuz after all I'm a Son of God therefore I'm being led by the spirit but that ain't what that scripture means it means the spirit of God is leading the sons of God so if you're off doing things and calling it God that ain't Godly it's not the spirit of God that's leading you hello somebody sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out the spirit of God fills the vacancy where you empty yourself then with a church when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving see then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material that's when the church is in its power he said and I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from their s that they don't see themselves they have they don't have nothing but to serve God and their thoughts they move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit to fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ and the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing it to pass the thought of their mind now is't that something here he's speaking of deity being revealed in human beings in 1954 he said it's on its Road I see it coming to pass I see it down the road in other other words there it's a prophecy that here I I see it we're in that time but do you realize that today brother Javier that we're living in the age of fulfillment and I I can prove this by the word of God we're living in the age of fulfillment you think whenever when you're looking to come to this place of adoption you remember what brother B taught it this way that adoption can't I'll just I'll just say I'll just say it so you can understand it but adoption is not a birth it's not a birth a child comes he's born but and he's still a child but adoption is not a birth that that ain't what he taught matter of fact it's not even the Holy Ghost that's not that can't be the fullest of adoption so see because the Holy Ghost is is only an Earnest it's only a down payment see he said see the holy spirit is our seal somebody say our seal the earnest means more Is Yet To Come Glory Glory we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just the down payment that holds it and secures it and anchors it so that no one else can touch it so it's the earnest of our adoption so you ain't got to worry about this adoption here when you receive the down payment it's the earnest that you'll come to the fullness of adoption so see it's the Earnest of our adoption so the holy spirit is now the earnest of God in our hearts sealed the adoption of the sons awaiting us at the end of the road to be Sons and Daughters of God see first said we're on the road I see it on the road now then in 1961 says see here we've already received the earnest of it and at the end of the road we're going to receive the fullness of it friends let me tell you when he would talk about this here that Paul said it would be a an appointed time when the time of adoption would come in other words that the Rapture couldn't take place 2,000 years ago I know you did you know that the that the saints of God 2,000 years ago were waiting for the Rapture the very day they went into the grave here 2,000 years ago they were they were preaching what we're preaching as far as that we're looking for a Rapture and and and a 100 years later they still preached it we're waiting for a Rapture 200 years later they still preach it we're waiting for a Rapture a thousand years later they still preached it we're waiting for Rapture that's why Jesus said that no man knowth the date or the hour because you think of it if they would have known that God because the Bible would tell us that whenever they went into the grave the very thing that they expected when they went into the grave that they would wake up with that same expectation so here are the sons of God that when they would die and they'd be shwn asunder and they were expecting to meet God when they would wake up from the in the resurrection they would wake up under that same expectation it would be just a moment that they went to sleep and they wake back up and say Where's My Lord I've been waiting on him all this time said see but if God would have told them it would be 2,000 years later then they would have never went to sleep under that expectation so if they were to wake under an expectation then they'd have to sleep under that same expectation he say so so all the way through 2,000 years we don't know the date or the hour we don't know the time when the Lord will come but Paul said but there will come a time that is appointed to the father that the church will come to this place of adoption and the fullness of of adoption will come to pass and we'll be we'll see the manifestation of the sons of God it's a time that is appointed of the father you say well so when is this time brother B say see first he said I see it on the road he said then we're going to see it right here at the end of the road but this wasn't at a random time can I can I do I got just a minute I I I can't skip this till next week but some of it I can but not this but but but but it's not a random time Paul said it was an appointed time remember he said see we're under tutors and governors until somebody say until until the time appointed of the father so here he's preaching in the first century prophesying of a time that this infant Church would come to a place of maturity he went through a whole a whole lesson on on maturity and in in an immature Church why he was talking to an infant Church saying they're going to come to this place of maturity said see so if God has an an appointed time and God has an appointed people then something that would have to take place if we're talking about adoption now hope you catch my where where I'm at but something would have to take take place that would bring the children to their father we're talking about adoption so here Paul said there Comes A Time an appointed time when the we'll be under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so then something's going to take place that'll bring the children to their father you think about what what Jesus says here you remember the parable in Luke 15 he he he he uh gave the parable of the Prodigal Son remember he was the one that went out and he squandered his inheritance can can you pre Ju Just can I have a minute he HED his inheritance and then because of the shap that he was in he made a purpose in his heart that I'll just go back to my daddy's house and be a servant cuz even a servant in My Father's House lives better than I'm living so he went back to the father's house but you notice that that whenever Jesus made this Parable that here not M this is good when Jesus made the parable you realize where he was but West see Jesus was in Palestine he was coming from a trip from Galilee on his way to Jerusalem now now you this is just fre this is free but he come from Galilee Jerusalem you know what Galilee means it means a chapel in Old English it means Chapel Jerusalem which means a the the city of peace or the city of God so here he was right in the middle on the way from church to Glory I wonder how many find oursel there sometimes but right in the middle of Galilee and Jerusalem here Jesus comes down in Palestine and he begins to uh tell this Pro the parable of the prodigal son now you notice whenever he told this Parable that wasn't the only Parable that he told first he told about a lost sheep and a Shepherd that went out and he found the sheep that was lost then he talks about a woman that had 10 coins and one of the coins was missing so she swept the house and went through the house to find the missing coin and add it back to the band and then he goes on and he preaches about the pro or he tells about the prodal son and how that he went out so you notice what Jesus is telling us he talks about a lost sheep a lost coin and a lost son right in the middle of Palestine here here he would come and say there a lost sheep a lost coin a lost son and then but notice what Jesus done is he showed us something about our God that makes him different than every other religion in the world you think about the religions of the world it's it's great deities in God that are waiting on people to come to them they build up a big statue and you have to go down before that statue and kneel down before him and where they put the statue that's where you got to go kneel down see so it's a deity that's always waiting on Humanity to come and find it but here what Jesus is doing to these par in this Parable remember he was talking to those publicans and or to to the the Pharisees and all that was attacking him for preaching to the publicans and and and and being around Sinners and and going around and talking to them kind of people and Jesus but what he shows us is our God is a different kind of deity that our God isn't waiting on us to come to him but our God goes and finds those that belong to him so he shows us a character of God when it came to the Sheep he went out and find it when it came to the corn she swept the house till she found it and replaced it when it came to the lost son the father ran to meet him so he shows us our God is different that's the way our God is that's the way Jesus done what happened with the woman at the well he said I got a need to go by Samaria what happened to the galeran the man that was filled with the legions of devils Jesus went down to where he was right to the tombs of where he was to call the devil out of the man and to set the man free this is our Jesus he's the same one that walked under the tree to find zachus there was hiding up there a Publican he said zachus come down I'm going to your house to today to have fellowship with you this is our God he don't leave us in our condition but he'll go right down to where we are and find us and call us out this is the kind of God that we serve he was the one that went down to the pool of be Bethesda and took the man that couldn't make his way to his healing and brought healing right to his doorstep This Is Our God he's a different kind of God that other people serve but notice here he was speaking in these Parables because the Pharisees here they were criticizing and him because he was he was he was in in Fellowship they would say with with Sinners and publicans but notice what Jesus is showing us that there comes an appointed time am I is that something an appointed time what was it where zakus it was an appointed time what was it with a woman at the well it was an appointed time how do you know she was going to be sitting there what what was it with that man that Legion it was an appointed time he said the there comes an appointed time and Jesus shows us that at this time is a time of of rejoicing remember what he said the back in when the Sheep came back to the fold he said Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost when the woman found the coin and put it back she said Rejoice with me for I have found my coin which was lost when he ran to the Sun and he put a robe on a robe on his shoulders and shoes on his feet and a ring on his hand you realize what all those are pertaining to they're pertaining to adoption to give him a to give him the shield of the father and put a robe on his shoulders that he would wear the father's clothes that when he would he wasn't he wouldn't allow him to come back as a servant he said you're a son even in the midst of of his failures he came to this think about it he come to this place he and then what he say he said bring the fatted Cal and and and kill it and let us be merried for my son was dead but he's alive again he was lost but he's found and the Bible said and they began to Rejoice so in this appointed time it's a time of rejoicing it's a time of adoption it's a time of God calling the church back to himself he said and in this time the church will be rejoicing think about what the Bible said John in Revelations 10 he said when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write but I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not think about here John saw what was taking place in the end time but the angel said seal it up and don't ride it but notice this seal was not an everlasting seal it was only until Glory it was only until in the seventh verse he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets can I read that from an amplified Bible in other word he said God's mystery or his hidden purpose he had announced through his servants the prophets would be accomplished or completed so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound God's hidden purpose in other words the time that was appointed to the father that his hidden purpose or his secret design would be accomplished here's what the Bible said it's an appointed time when his hidden purpose would be revealed can I I'm I'm going to skip can I just can I just say it here here's the Revelation the angel of Revelations 107 and the me and the the messenger of Malachi 4 and 5 is the same one this is the this is the same the same person that would come that God would use in this office you say so what was the purpose of the Malachi 4 messenger how many how many members what it was us it was to turn the heart of the children to their fathers we're talking about adoption we're talking about coming back to the father we're talking about coming to a place of maturity this was the very purpose of Malachi 4 it was to bring the church to the place of adoption it was to take children and turn them back to their father oh my makes me want to shout you think about what that's why the prophet of God would preach his message was not the same thing there was it differed than that of zza Street Pentecost because there was lot of baptisms that take place in Pentecost but they wouldn't carry on into the word of God in other words that's why he would use this term so many times of Pentecostal babies how many you ever heard that Pentecostal babies in other words they wouldn't come into the maturity of the word of God they'd receive a baptism they receive it in the in in in Jesus name but they never come to the maturity of the word so it was called that so so he shows us how that it would take the revelation of the word to manifest adopted sons of God it would take so it would take a revealed word that's why my I ran out of time that's why that's why that's why it bothers you as a as a as a as a pastor as as a minister whenever whenever somebody acts like we don't need the doctrine and we we don't need church and they'll go fellowship with some some Pentecost non-denominational church or something and then get up there and tell them we we don't need doctr we we just we just want to we just want to be all brothers and all this stuff but it'll take the doctrine it takes the message of the hour to bring the adoption to the church there'll never be a Rapture without it so how can we say we don't need it it's a must have we must have it this is what the purpose it'll take a revelation of the word to manifest adopted Sons it takes a Malachi 4 a Baptist preacher can preach A good sermon make you feel good and many many will be have everlasting life because of it but we're talking about the rapturing of the Bride of Jesus Christ this is a different thing we're talking about that that'll never take place under a Baptist message it'll never take place under a Pentecostal message it can only take place according to the Bible under the message of Malachi 4 that's the only thing that'll ever turn the children's Hearts back to the fathers it's the only it I'll just make it plain the message is the only thing that will it's the only thing that'll bring you to a place of adoption it's the shout of first Thessalonians 4 you say well brother matth the church has been shouting since 1906 that's a different kind of shout they sure have you know what you can have you can have a whole bunch of churches without the message you have a whole bunch of shouting churches without the message but what you'll never have is you'll never have a rapturing church without the message you'll never have that yes sir see in the layot to see in church age so now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to their Pentecostal fathers see you need those truths you need the revelation of the word of God see it it's it'll take the message to bring the children to this place of adoption you said well brother mat not everybody believes that but you don't you realize that that's the of course that's true we're talking about the message of melachi 4 who was a type after John the Baptist a type after Elijah you know what happened in the days of John and Elijah the Bible would would would tell us the stories but here here here the people in these in these day in in the days of of Ahab being the king in John's said see it was only it was not it was only the children whose Hearts would be turned remember in the days of Ahab there was only 7,000 true seed Israelites although there was all kinds that was born to Israel but remember what God said I had 7,000 that never bowed a need to Bell there was only 7,000 in the days of John there was a very few the masses in both ages here in the L to see in church age the masses in both Ages were in fornication and idolatry so you're not going to have the whole world is going to believe what you believe not the whole world is going to see what you see not the whole world his Hearts is going to be turned to the father they're not going to be turned just like it was in the days of John just like it was in the Days of Elijah and Ahab said but but there will be some children that's what the Bible said but the children's Hearts they'll be turned to their father they'll be turned back to God the fullness of the word of God that'll be manifested in them again not be filled up with with what men have came up with of what church ought to be and how they they they they they they they shift it and shape it you realize how much it's changed over the years I I can tell you this right now it's changed all you have to do is go back and look at a picture of America in 1920 or 1930 or 1940 even in 1950 that that that a woman in Jonesboro Arkansas in the 1950s was arrested and put on trial had to pay a fine for wearing shorts out in public and you know what and not there wasn't a single Christian Church in the world that you could go and dress the way you do and act the way you do today it matter if he was a Methodist or a Baptist or a Church of Christ or a Pentecost it didn't matter what kind of church you were back then they all they all were decent and believed in Holiness but watch men's Minds changed because of society I had a lady tell me that she said well that scripture don't apply anymore about women dress in that way and I don't mean to be here but but that that don't apply anymore I said well why don't it apply she said because Society has changed it I said how can society change the word of God that was written 2,000 years ago before Society ever came to this place before a man ever changed the rules before he ever changed the law in a book do you realize that the church books that they read have laws in them that in 1940 the law is not the same as it is today now they allow homosexuals in the pulia and pastor and churches are divided over why because they change the law day after day so there has to come a time how can God come and get something that changes at the idea of every man or the feeling of every man but he's waiting on a church to come to a place of adoption to a place of maturity that can receive the fullness of the word of God and be manifested Sons and Daughters of God he's calling us to a place of maturity we're not always children we mature in the word of God some are afraid of it I'm for matter I'm afraid afraid of that I'm afraid of this message afraid to be identified with it but you realize it's the only thing that'll bring you to adoption but isn't that why Paul said this can I read you something as we close isn't that why Paul said but as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father what does the spirit of adoption do it causes you to believe this message that is bringing you to a place of maturity listen prodigals you don't have to be afraid you can Rejoice for the father killed the fatted calf you don't have to live in fear he robed you with righteousness and the Bible says at the found in of the seventh angel will he'll reveal God's hidden purpose is't that powerful L is what the prophet said he said see in the seventh seal watch this purpose being revealed and I'm closing I really am if if you want to come sis watch this purpose be revealed in the seventh seal I may go through this next next time we're drawing late I'm just going to stop right there God bless won't y'all stand to your feet amen that'll give me a good starting point praise the Lord isn't God good amen it's the time of adoption the time of manifesting sons of God are sons of God my I I don't know about y'all but I I think it's wonderful to recognize who you are the hidden purpose of God y'all be praying about that this week the

what happened it's the spirit of God that Holy Spirit that enforc the one that comes looking for him that came and found him in a pig pin and brought him back to where he belonged it was that same
