[38:57] morning. just say it's good to be back
[38:59] in the house of the Lord and my just
[39:02] have a revival in our hearts and amen
[39:05] just enjoyed the uh meetings that we
[39:07] that we had last week and been hearing
[39:11] many reports and testimonies of what God
[39:13] done uh during the meeting and I know
[39:16] there's how many can raise your hand
[39:18] this morning say you was blessed or the
[39:20] touched by God during those meetings and
[39:23] certainly believe that God is is on the
[39:26] move and He's still dealing with
[39:29] people's hearts. He's still he's still
[39:31] calling those that are lost. He's still
[39:35] he's still pouring his spirit out upon
[39:38] his church. And so, we just certainly
[39:40] are privileged to be a part of the move
[39:42] of God. Amen. And to see what God is
[39:45] doing. And I just I always feel honored
[39:50] to think about it, you know, to say that
[39:53] I know God. And it's wonderful to know
[39:55] God. But it's even better, brother
[39:56] Wesley, to know that God knows you.
[39:58] Amen. He's so mindful of you that he had
[40:00] come by and preacher after preacher came
[40:03] and from different parts of the country.
[40:06] They didn't talk to each other before
[40:07] they came. There there was no huddle.
[40:09] They was they just huddled up in heaven.
[40:11] Amen. And the same God that dealt with
[40:14] one dealt with another. And every
[40:16] service it was to it just built my
[40:19] confidence and strengthened us in the
[40:21] word of God. And I just want to say
[40:23] thank you to the church and for all the
[40:25] efforts that you put forth uh to make
[40:27] the meeting possible and uh setting
[40:31] everything up and it was a lot of labor
[40:33] and and I want you to just go ahead and
[40:34] give a a hand clap to everybody else
[40:37] around you for all their effort that
[40:40] they put in. Amen.
[40:43] It's certainly a a blessing to be a
[40:46] part. So also want to make a special
[40:49] announcement this morning
[40:52] just to save the date. We do it every
[40:54] year the same date but the first Sunday
[40:56] of March uh we'll have our uh
[40:59] anniversary meeting and that'll be the
[41:02] last few days of February and the first
[41:04] Sunday of March. And then also I'd like
[41:06] to announce on December the 6th and
[41:09] December the 7th, Brother Homer Longorio
[41:12] will be here with us. We're going to
[41:13] have a Saturday night service and invite
[41:15] uh different ones from the area, maybe
[41:18] the young people around that would uh
[41:20] he's got quite a testimony and he's
[41:22] going to come minister for us and take
[41:24] the time and uh and certainly an elder
[41:27] in the in the gospel. And so we
[41:29] certainly look forward to that. So just
[41:31] be remembering those services. And if
[41:33] you have a need on your heart this
[41:34] morning, I know God is mindful. I don't
[41:36] know if they asked about the have prayer
[41:38] for brother Keith and their family. Um,
[41:41] but there's a hurricane that is the
[41:44] class four right now, category four,
[41:46] looking to be a category five. They live
[41:48] on the island of Jamaica. Our church has
[41:50] helped them out in in in their uh church
[41:54] and done some efforts there with them.
[41:56] And so I want to remember them in
[41:58] prayer. I was telling brother Joe in the
[41:59] back, I remember when I was in India one
[42:01] time and I've got the same picture that
[42:03] these brothers posted this morning of
[42:05] that hurricane overlooking that island.
[42:07] I've got that same picture in India and
[42:09] it it it was uh they were evacuated. I
[42:12] can't remember the the number, but it
[42:14] seemed like it was 1.2 million or
[42:16] something like that that was evacuated
[42:18] out of the city that we were in. And all
[42:20] the saints, we got together and went to
[42:21] pray in. I know people around the world
[42:23] were praying about it. And the next
[42:25] morning, I I got the newspaper article
[42:28] from the next morning after the
[42:29] hurricane. I've still got a copy of it
[42:31] at home. And it said the city of Visag
[42:34] had a miraculous escape. They called it
[42:36] the city of destiny that not even one
[42:39] drop of rain fell in the city that we
[42:41] were in. And here we were looking to be
[42:43] right in the the path of the storm. So
[42:48] I know that God is more than able. And I
[42:50] believe as believers, we have a right.
[42:52] There's saints of God that are on that
[42:54] island. And it may seem it must seem
[42:56] hopeless. I I know the feeling. It seems
[42:58] hopeless and scattered. Alarms going off
[43:01] and everybody looking for a little bit
[43:02] of a refuge. But there's one refuge I
[43:04] know that you can get into that can save
[43:07] you from every storm. So, we want to
[43:08] call on the Lord this morning on their
[43:11] behalf. And if you have a need on your
[43:12] heart, just lift your hand to God. I
[43:14] know that he's mindful of what we have
[43:16] need of. And I just want to invite you
[43:17] as a body of believers to pray for that
[43:20] church there. And let's just pray
[43:22] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[43:24] Lord, how privileged that we are, Lord,
[43:26] to be able to serve a God that is more
[43:29] than able. Lord, you're a God of every
[43:32] storm. Lord, you're the one that created
[43:34] the wind and the rain and the Lord. You
[43:37] You made the earth and the heavens,
[43:38] Lord. And God, we just ask you, Lord,
[43:41] that this morning, Lord, knowing that
[43:43] there is a body of believers that are in
[43:45] need. And Lord, we ask you to stay the
[43:48] storm. Lord, we pray that you would
[43:49] bring them through it safely. Lord, that
[43:51] you would make a way, God, that even
[43:54] though it would may seem hopeless and
[43:56] seem that it's outside of their power,
[43:58] but Lord, we know a power that is
[44:00] greater than any storm. And Lord, we
[44:02] just ask you to to have your way there,
[44:05] Lord. I pray the hand of God, Lord,
[44:07] would move upon the saints of God. And
[44:09] God, bring them into a refuge of safety,
[44:12] Lord, until the storm would pass over.
[44:14] Lord, I pray for every need this
[44:16] morning, Lord. Every heart, Lord, those
[44:18] that are in trouble, God, we know that
[44:20] you are mindful of what we have need of.
[44:22] And Lord, as we approach your word this
[44:24] morning, Lord, we just ask you that from
[44:27] it that we might draw strength, Lord,
[44:29] that we would leave this place. And
[44:31] Lord, we would be strengthened by your
[44:32] word. We'd be closer to you. And Lord,
[44:35] we just ask you to help us this morning
[44:37] to get out of the way, God, that you
[44:39] could have your liberty in this place.
[44:41] We pray these things in the name of
[44:42] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[44:47] this morning. We want to invite you to
[44:49] the scripture to the book of Colossians.
[44:52] And we're going to read out of the first
[44:53] chapter and the 19th verse. Colossians
[44:57] 1:19. I think we lost power. Amen. God
[45:01] bless you. Thank you. Colossians 1 and9.
[45:07] Colossians 1 uh the 19th verse. And
[45:12] Lord's been put this on my heart after
[45:15] following the meetings. There was so
[45:16] many great services.
[45:19] It's just I've been feeding on it all
[45:21] week. went back and listened to some of
[45:23] those services and man, it's just a it's
[45:26] it's an awesome thing to know God. Amen.
[45:28] Isn't it? Amen. Certainly appreciate all
[45:30] that he does. I want to read out of this
[45:33] scripture. This is Apostle Paul and just
[45:36] the one verse of scripture I'll read.
[45:38] The Bible says, "For it pleased the
[45:40] father that in him should all the
[45:43] fullness dwell." And we'll just ask the
[45:46] Lord to add his blessing to the reading
[45:47] of the word. I would like to take this
[45:49] as a title this morning. For it pleased
[45:52] the father. Paul said, "It pleased the
[45:55] father that in him should all the
[45:57] fullness dwell." You know, I think about
[45:59] a a true Christian or a believer this
[46:02] morning. I I can't think of any uh any
[46:05] real uh bornagain believer that wouldn't
[46:08] have a desire in their heart to be
[46:09] pleasing to God. How how many say that
[46:12] it's certainly it ought to be the desire
[46:13] of every heart? That's why Paul would
[46:15] say, he said, "We walk by faith and not
[46:18] by sight." We are confident, well
[46:20] pleased, rather to be absent from the
[46:22] body and to be present with the Lord.
[46:25] Therefore, we make it our aim, whether
[46:27] present or absent, to be well pleasing
[46:30] unto him. I wonder how many this morning
[46:32] could say that that that is my aim. It's
[46:34] my aim to be pleasing to God. I I aim in
[46:37] my actions. I want to be pleasing to God
[46:39] in my in my life. I want to be pleasing
[46:42] to God in my conduct. I want it to
[46:44] please God. Paul said that is our aim.
[46:46] We make it our aim to be pleasing to
[46:48] God. And you know with that kind of
[46:50] desire as a believer, you know, we go
[46:52] through many things. We go through many
[46:54] uh great trials. We God puts us uh uh uh
[46:57] trials on our life. The Bible says he
[46:59] chasens those that he loves. And uh and
[47:02] God he watches how we go through it. He
[47:04] sees how we're strengthened and how we
[47:06] grow. And uh you know, sometimes we fall
[47:09] and sometimes we're up and sometimes
[47:11] we're down. Sometimes we have a a great
[47:13] day. Sometimes we have a bad day. Preach
[47:15] it, somebody. And some days we're on the
[47:18] mountain. Sometimes we're in the valley.
[47:19] Sometimes we feel like we're saved.
[47:21] Sometimes we we feel like we're lost.
[47:23] Sometimes we feel like we're going to
[47:24] make it. Sometimes we don't think we can
[47:26] get through tomorrow. And and but but
[47:28] that's just the life or the human nature
[47:31] of our flesh. And uh but but Paul said,
[47:33] "In all of that, I make it my aim to be
[47:36] pleasing to God. I I may not get it all
[47:38] right. I may not say everything right. I
[47:40] may not I may not do everything just
[47:42] perfect, but my aim is to please God.
[47:44] And I I can say that this morning with
[47:46] an honest heart. My aim is to be
[47:48] pleasing to God. I want God to be
[47:50] pleased with me in everything that I do.
[47:52] And you know, I I thought of that, you
[47:55] know, how that it is our desire to be
[47:57] pleasing to God. And when you have that
[47:58] kind of desire, it brings you to this
[48:00] question that how can I be pleasing unto
[48:03] God if you don't know what God requires
[48:06] of you? So if we have a desire to be
[48:08] pleasing to God, then we must know what
[48:09] God requires of us so that we can be
[48:12] pleasing to God and be satisfied in
[48:14] that. And you know, I thought of that
[48:15] and it kind of took me to the the story
[48:17] of or or the the prophet Micah. How many
[48:19] remember Micah in the in the Old
[48:21] Testament he was one of the minor
[48:22] prophets here uh uh Micah just a few
[48:25] verses of scripture that he wrote. But
[48:27] Micah was a prophet during the time of
[48:29] Isaiah and and uh many of the
[48:31] theologians would say he was raised up
[48:33] under Isaiah or he must have said under
[48:35] Isaiah's ministry because his prophecies
[48:37] were uh in some in some places were
[48:40] identical to what Isaiah had prophesied.
[48:42] He prophesied to the northern uh kingdom
[48:44] of Israel and Judah and and so both the
[48:47] northern and the southern kingdom and uh
[48:49] but even even when Isaiah would prophesy
[48:52] that all of the Jew of Israel would
[48:53] worship in Jerusalem, Micah would say
[48:55] the same thing. And I thought, well,
[48:56] maybe he said under Isaiah and maybe he
[48:58] didn't. But the same God that told
[49:00] Isaiah uh that spoke to Isaiah,
[49:02] certainly the same God that spoke to
[49:04] Micah because they said the same thing.
[49:05] And and so here uh Micah being this
[49:08] minor prophet, he was born in a little
[49:10] village uh uh in over in Judah and uh
[49:14] spent some 50 some odd years prophesying
[49:16] to the kingdom of Israel. And uh and
[49:19] Micah was the one that God would use to
[49:21] call Israel whenever they would fall uh
[49:24] into this uh this idol worship and
[49:26] things that they you know isn't it
[49:27] something that it just seemed like every
[49:29] time they'd go a little bit with God
[49:30] before long they they'd get off track
[49:33] and they they had allow things to enter
[49:35] into their life and things would enter
[49:36] into enter into their homes and all the
[49:39] things that God called them out of.
[49:41] After a little while, they'd have a
[49:42] great revival and God would bring them
[49:44] out of it and he'd send a prophet and
[49:46] that that prophet he would lay down the
[49:47] law and they they'd get on track with
[49:49] God and after a little while they just
[49:51] kind of seem to go right back the same
[49:53] way. And so God would just send another
[49:55] man anointed with a message to bring
[49:57] them right back into line again. And so
[49:59] here here's where Micah finds the people
[50:01] of God. And and when he came there, I
[50:04] always love reading this because Micah
[50:05] says here, "O mountains and heels." He
[50:08] said, "Open up your ears, for the Lord
[50:10] has a controversy, you strong
[50:12] foundations of of the earth. The Lord
[50:14] has a controversy with his people and he
[50:16] will plead with Israel." And so here
[50:18] Micah is actually making a call to the
[50:21] mountains and a call to the hills and a
[50:23] call to the earth to be a witness of a
[50:25] case that God is bringing against his
[50:28] people. In other words, he said God has
[50:29] a controversy with him. And so, uh, he's
[50:32] going to plead, it's almost like a court
[50:34] case. He makes an indictment against his
[50:36] own people saying that they're not
[50:38] obeying the Lord. And so he's going to
[50:40] bring a formal charge. And so here he he
[50:42] makes a summon to the mountain and a
[50:44] summons to the hills and a summons to
[50:46] the earth to hear the case that God is
[50:48] going to bring. He said, "I have a
[50:50] controversy with the people of Israel."
[50:52] And I think what a scene this is here as
[50:55] as the mountains gather around and the
[50:57] hills gather and the earth begins
[50:59] together so that that that God can
[51:01] present his case. And he uses this
[51:02] prophet Micah to speak the case that God
[51:05] has. And and Micah comes out and he as
[51:07] he present begins to present God's case.
[51:10] And he said, "Oh people, what have I
[51:12] done unto thee? And where have I wearied
[51:14] thee? Testify against me." In other
[51:16] words, God asked them, "Where have I
[51:18] failed you that you don't serve me the
[51:20] right way? Where where did I let you
[51:22] down? At what point in your in your life
[51:24] did you call upon me that I didn't
[51:26] answer? Where where did I neglect you?
[51:29] and where have I forsaken you that you
[51:31] would worship other gods or you would
[51:33] allow these things in your life or where
[51:35] you would take your your life or your
[51:37] your your purpose and dedicate it uh to
[51:39] some other god. But where have I failed
[51:41] you? And so here God as he begins to
[51:43] plead his case, he said, "Was it not I
[51:45] that brought you out of the land of
[51:47] Egypt? Was it not I that delivered you
[51:49] when you was in bondage? Was it not I
[51:52] that when you were in blindness, I I
[51:54] established you and I and I shot I shone
[51:56] a light upon you to lead you out of
[51:58] darkness. Is it not the case of God this
[52:01] morning? How many of us could hear the
[52:02] voice of God? Would you say, "Was it not
[52:04] I that brought you out of sin? And was
[52:06] it not I that brought you out of the
[52:08] world? Is it not I that brought you into
[52:10] a into a church that believe the the
[52:12] word of God that that established the
[52:14] word of God in your life? that I not
[52:16] bring you out of bondage and bring you
[52:18] out of drugs and bring you out of
[52:19] alcohol and and bring you out of a life
[52:22] of destruction and a and a path that led
[52:24] to hell. Was it not I that led you and
[52:27] set your feet on on a rock, a firm
[52:30] foundation. And so God begins to
[52:32] establish this. He said, "Remember that
[52:34] I I brought you into this place and then
[52:36] I put people over you that would lead
[52:38] you the right way. I brought Miriam and
[52:40] I I brought Aaron and I brought M I
[52:42] brought Moses to you uh to be leaders
[52:45] among you and and then when they would
[52:47] come around to try to destroy you, did I
[52:50] not show you righteousness? You remember
[52:52] when Balam came and and and and he came
[52:55] to prophesy against you and he came to
[52:57] curse you and he was hired by that old
[53:00] king Baal. But did I not tell him that
[53:02] instead of cursing my people that you
[53:04] have to bless them anyway? Even when he
[53:06] seen your mistakes and he wanted to
[53:08] curse, I filled his mouth with
[53:10] blessings. When he saw your failures and
[53:12] he wanted to curse you, but I wouldn't
[53:14] let him speak a curse against you, but I
[53:16] made him bless you. And I allowed your
[53:18] righteousness to be shown. Am I Isn't
[53:20] that something? He here he's reminded
[53:22] them. I allowed your righteousness to be
[53:24] shown even amidst your failures and even
[53:27] amidst your faults and even amidst your
[53:29] mistakes that they would view. But in
[53:31] all of that, I allowed your
[53:33] righteousness to be what they would see.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where have I not been
[53:38] merciful? Have I not overlooked your
[53:39] sin?" And when they wanted to curse you,
[53:42] but I blessed you instead. But notice as
[53:44] God would remind them of this, here's
[53:46] how Israel responds. They said, "Well,
[53:48] what can we do to come before you? Shall
[53:50] we bow myself before a high God? Shall I
[53:53] come before him with burnt offerings or
[53:55] with calves that are a year old? Will
[53:57] the Lord be pleased with thousands of
[53:59] rams and 10,000 rivers of oil? Well,
[54:02] shall I give my firstborn for my
[54:04] transgression? Should I give the fruit
[54:06] of my body for the sin of my soul? See,
[54:08] their response is is, "What must I do to
[54:11] be pleasing to God?" Here, God has
[54:13] reminded me where I come from. God has
[54:15] reminded me what my purpose is. God has
[54:18] reminded me of my relationship between
[54:20] me and God. And then the answer is, "But
[54:22] God, what must I do to be pleasing in
[54:25] thy sight?" said, "Shall shall I give
[54:26] the fruit of my body to the sin of my
[54:28] soul?" But Micah said, he said, "But God
[54:31] has shown you," watch his answer. He
[54:33] said, "God has shown you what is good.
[54:35] And what does the Lord require of you?
[54:38] But to do justly, to love mercy, and to
[54:42] walk humbly with your God." Now, what an
[54:44] instruction that God requires of us
[54:46] today is to do justly, to love mercy,
[54:49] and to walk humbly with God. Brother
[54:52] said, "Oh church, don't you see where we
[54:54] where we've made our mistake?" He said,
[54:55] "You've been born again, but you're
[54:57] dillydallying in the world and the
[54:59] things of the world, and God can't put
[55:01] any confidence in you. That's the reason
[55:03] great gifts are not in the Baptist or
[55:05] the Methodist or the Presbyterian or the
[55:07] Pentecostal." He said, "It's because of
[55:09] the character of the church. It hasn't
[55:12] been pleasing to the father. I know it's
[55:14] I know it's a hard thing to think of,
[55:16] but it's the truth. He said, "The reason
[55:18] they don't have the great gifts of God
[55:20] is because the character of the church
[55:22] hasn't been pleasing to the father." He
[55:24] said, "But if you'll ever let that great
[55:26] ransom church of God straighten itself
[55:28] up and start back to believing in God
[55:31] the way they ought to and live like they
[55:33] ought to, you'll see God come on the
[55:35] scene with everything that he promised.
[55:37] It's right if you'll break down the
[55:39] barrier and come in, have fellowship and
[55:42] reason and love and preach and serve the
[55:44] Lord and see what will take place.
[55:46] Friends, let me tell you that wasn't for
[55:47] 1950 or 1960 or 1906. It's for 2025. If
[55:53] you want to see God moving in your life
[55:55] and the gifts of God operating in your
[55:57] life and God being able to use you as a
[56:00] believer, he said, then don't dillydally
[56:02] in the world and the things of the
[56:04] world, but let the world go by and the
[56:06] things of this life go BY AND GET BACK
[56:08] TO BEING AN OLD-FASHIONED HOLY GHOST
[56:10] fililled believer filled with the spirit
[56:12] OF GOD AND ALLOW GOD TO USE you and
[56:14] display and manifest himself in you and
[56:17] you'll see God just like you saw him
[56:19] before.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; What must I do? What does God require of
[56:23] me? To love God, to do justly, and to
[56:26] love mercy, and to walk humbly before
[56:28] your God.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we want as a body of
[56:31] Christ?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; The promises of God and the gifts of God
[56:35] to be made manifest in us. That's the
[56:37] desire of us as believers. See, there's
[56:40] a reason you want that is because that's
[56:41] what God wants.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; There's a reason you desire that. God
[56:44] wants that. That's what our heavenly
[56:46] father desires of us. Listen what Paul's
[56:48] saying in in Colossians 1. He's speaking
[56:50] of Jesus. He said, "In whom we have
[56:52] redemption through his blood, even the
[56:55] forgiveness of sins, who is the image of
[56:57] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[56:59] every creature. For by him were all
[57:01] things created that are in heaven and
[57:03] that are in earth." Watch, he's actually
[57:05] he's establishing the deity of the man
[57:08] Jesus. He said, "For by him all things
[57:10] were created that are in heaven and are
[57:13] in earth, visible and invisible, whether
[57:15] they be thrones or dominions or
[57:17] principalities or powers." That ought to
[57:18] make us feel good about what's going on
[57:20] because there ain't a throne or dominion
[57:22] or a power that wasn't created by this
[57:24] man Jesus. He said by him all things
[57:27] that were created. That means there
[57:28] ain't no power that can overcome him.
[57:30] There ain't nothing that'll catch him
[57:32] off guard. It don't matter how bad the
[57:34] world gives. He said by him were all
[57:36] things created. He said all things were
[57:38] created by him. And the best part, he
[57:40] said and all things were created for
[57:42] him. It was for God's purpose that it
[57:44] was made. There ain't nothing out of
[57:45] cater. There ain't nothing out of order.
[57:48] There ain't nothing that's going to
[57:49] catch God off guard. It was created by
[57:51] him and it was created for him.
[57:53] Therefore, the things that are going on
[57:55] in this world, they won't do but one
[57:56] thing. They'll fulfill the very purpose
[57:59] of almighty God.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "And he is before all things,
[58:03] and by him all things consist. He is the
[58:06] head of the body, the church, who is the
[58:07] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[58:09] that in all things he might have the
[58:11] preeminence." Now, isn't it something?
[58:13] He goes right into what's pleasing to
[58:15] God pertaining to the Gentiles. He said,
[58:17] "See, first inn that God might have
[58:20] preeminence in this man Jesus Christ."
[58:22] That Jesus would have preeminence over
[58:25] the earth. And then he goes right in and
[58:26] he says, "And now it pleased the Father
[58:29] that in him should all the fullness
[58:32] dwell, having made peace through the
[58:34] blood of his cross, by him to reconcile
[58:36] all things unto himself. By him I say
[58:39] whether they be things in earth or
[58:41] things in heaven. And you that were
[58:43] sometime watch he begins to reveal the
[58:45] purpose of the father. He said you that
[58:47] were sometime alienated and enemies in
[58:50] your mind by wicked works. Yet now hath
[58:53] he reconciled in the body of his flesh
[58:55] through death to present you holy and
[58:59] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[59:02] sight. I thought my what a purpose that
[59:04] God had here. He said, "It pleased the
[59:06] father that in Christ should the
[59:09] fullness of God dwell." You know what
[59:11] that means to me? That means that all
[59:13] that God ever was was poured into the
[59:15] man Jesus Christ. That the fullness of
[59:18] God would dwell in Jesus Christ. It's
[59:20] important to catch the revelation of the
[59:22] fullness of God being poured. That means
[59:24] all the way back in the book of Genesis,
[59:26] the very creative power of God was
[59:29] poured into the man Jesus. The power to
[59:31] speak to storms was poured into Jesus
[59:34] Christ. The power to heal, it was poured
[59:36] into him. The power to cleanse, it was
[59:38] poured into him. The power to give life.
[59:41] The power to curse and the power to
[59:43] raise up. The power to give mercy. The
[59:45] power to give grace. THE POWER TO CURSE.
[59:48] THE POWER TO bind and the power to
[59:50] loose. It was poured into the man Jesus
[59:52] Christ. All the power that God ever had
[59:55] was poured out into this man.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Paul is is establishing him as the deity
[1:00:02] of heaven. He is the great king of
[1:00:04] kings. He's the lord of lords. He's not
[1:00:06] only the son, but he's the created power
[1:00:09] of God upon the earth. He's establishing
[1:00:12] him as not only a heavenly power or in a
[1:00:14] heavenly throne, but he's establishing
[1:00:16] HIM AS AN EARTHLY power and having
[1:00:19] dominion over all the thrones and the
[1:00:20] power and principalities of the earth.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "And it pleased the father to
[1:00:26] give all of the fullness of God unto
[1:00:28] him."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And watch what he does. He said, "It
[1:00:31] pleased the father having made peace
[1:00:33] through the blood of his cross."
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; It pleased the father, watch, he turns
[1:00:37] this into the purpose of God. It pleased
[1:00:40] the father that by him to reconcile all
[1:00:43] things unto himself, that by him I say,
[1:00:45] whether they be things in earth or
[1:00:46] things in heaven. So, so he says, see,
[1:00:49] so when his purpose is fulfilled, then
[1:00:51] the father is pleased.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; So here he said it's pleasing to the
[1:00:55] father. What is it that his purpose is
[1:00:58] fulfilled? He said, "What was his
[1:01:00] purpose all the way down to the bottom
[1:01:01] of the chapter? His purpose was to
[1:01:04] present you holy and unblameable and
[1:01:08] unreprovable in God's sight." My isn't
[1:01:10] that a thought this morning to think
[1:01:12] that all the power of heaven, all the
[1:01:15] power of God was poured into the man
[1:01:17] Jesus that he may go to the cross of
[1:01:19] Calvary that he could reconcile you back
[1:01:21] to God for one purpose. so that he could
[1:01:24] present you an unclean, a filthy a
[1:01:28] person whose righteousness was as filthy
[1:01:30] rags. But he could present you as a as
[1:01:33] holy, as unblameable, as blameless, as
[1:01:37] unreprovable in the sight of God.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He poured the power of heaven into Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ that Jesus would have the power
[1:01:45] to present you as a holy people. That
[1:01:48] makes me about want to shout this
[1:01:49] morning. TO THINK THAT HE HAD THE power
[1:01:51] to do it. HE HAD THE POWER TO CREATE. HE
[1:01:53] COULD HE COULD MAKE a fish where Peter
[1:01:55] could catch A BOATLOAD OF FISH. HE COULD
[1:01:57] TOUCH a a tree that wasn't putting off
[1:01:59] fruit. He could curse IT AND IT WOULD
[1:02:01] WITHER. HE COULD GIVE IT LIFE AND IT
[1:02:03] WOULD BRING FORTH. THAT same Jesus that
[1:02:05] had that power, had a purpose. It was to
[1:02:07] present you holy and unblameable and
[1:02:10] unreprovable in the sight of God.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; It ain't my power to do it. It was his
[1:02:15] power to do it. And friends, he had the
[1:02:17] power
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; to be able to present you my but that's
[1:02:21] no wonder brother B said that was his
[1:02:22] three-fold purpose it was God in Christ
[1:02:25] and why he done that in order to show
[1:02:27] you what he could do with you. So the
[1:02:29] second part was Christ's preeminence in
[1:02:31] the church and then the third was the
[1:02:33] kingdom being restored upon the earth.
[1:02:36] So here God has a preeminence in you and
[1:02:39] when he has preeminence in you it
[1:02:41] pleases him. But that's something his
[1:02:43] first purpose it pleased him when the
[1:02:45] fullness was in Jesus. But then his
[1:02:48] second purpose was the preeminence in
[1:02:50] the church. So so see whenever God's
[1:02:52] purpose is fulfilled then he is pleased.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; So it pleases God for the preeminence to
[1:02:58] be in the bride of Jesus Christ. It
[1:03:00] pleases him. He's not disappointed when
[1:03:03] you get into your position.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder how many could say this
[1:03:06] this morning. I want to be pleasing to
[1:03:07] God. Remember this is what Paul Paul's
[1:03:10] message was. And I preached a message on
[1:03:11] it a few months ago on Galatians the 4th
[1:03:13] chapter how Paul would talk about the
[1:03:15] son being placed as a son. He was not he
[1:03:18] started as a servant and he served as
[1:03:20] servants but one day he was adopted into
[1:03:22] being a son. Remember he said see when
[1:03:25] he's placed as a son he's no longer a
[1:03:26] servant but now the son could be about
[1:03:28] the father's business. Remember what it
[1:03:30] was? Remember I if a father he would
[1:03:33] raise up his child. If the father was a
[1:03:35] farmer, he would send a tutor over him
[1:03:37] to teach him how to farm and teach him
[1:03:39] how to raise crop and teach him when to
[1:03:41] put the seed in the ground and when to
[1:03:42] harvest. He would teach him these things
[1:03:44] that whenever the son would come to age,
[1:03:46] he would carry on the b the business of
[1:03:48] the father. If he was a banker, he'd
[1:03:50] teach him how to how to calculate and
[1:03:52] how to how to make good loans and how to
[1:03:54] how to balance the books and how how to
[1:03:56] do those things because he wanted to to
[1:03:58] to graduate into the father's business
[1:04:01] or or maybe he was a a salesman or
[1:04:04] something. He wanted to teach him how
[1:04:05] how to use the words right and how to
[1:04:07] say things just right so that so that he
[1:04:09] could take over the father's business.
[1:04:10] said, "See, so whenever the son comes to
[1:04:12] this place, he's coming to a place of
[1:04:15] actually being a son so that he could be
[1:04:18] he could take over the father's
[1:04:19] business." He said, "See, so now here we
[1:04:21] are today. What is our purpose as
[1:04:23] believers? Our purpose is to do what the
[1:04:25] father's business was here as sons and
[1:04:28] daughters of God. He's established us as
[1:04:30] sons of God that we could do the
[1:04:32] father's business." And I got news for
[1:04:33] you. Our father, he wasn't a banker. Our
[1:04:35] father wasn't a farmer. Our father, he
[1:04:38] wasn't A SALESMAN, BUT HE BUT he had a
[1:04:40] business. It was far greater than
[1:04:41] anything we could do upon this earth.
[1:04:43] But now, he said, "What was his
[1:04:45] business?" His business was to vindicate
[1:04:47] the word of God. He said, "And now his
[1:04:50] business has become our business." How
[1:04:52] many sons of God are here? How many
[1:04:53] daughters of God? He said, "So, his
[1:04:55] business has become your business this
[1:04:57] morning." So, if his business that you
[1:05:00] can just say it this morning, that means
[1:05:01] it's our business to have a tent
[1:05:03] revival. It's our business to have a
[1:05:05] meeting. It's our business to preach the
[1:05:06] gospel. It's our business to uh to
[1:05:09] preach salvation. It's our business uh
[1:05:11] to be able to uh to preach that GOD IS
[1:05:13] STILL A GOD of miracles. It's our
[1:05:15] business to say he's a healer of the
[1:05:17] sick. It's your business to lay hands on
[1:05:19] the sick and watch him recover. It's
[1:05:21] your business to take the name OF JESUS
[1:05:23] AND CAST DEMONS out of people's life.
[1:05:25] It's your business to be able to do the
[1:05:27] works of the father.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Said it's our business. I know what the
[1:05:32] church world does. They they deny the
[1:05:34] power of God and they deny they deny
[1:05:36] that you being about the father's
[1:05:38] business. He said, "But something that
[1:05:39] there has to come something in you to
[1:05:42] bring you into this place of sunship.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; There has to something be born in you
[1:05:46] that takes you out of this nature of
[1:05:48] this old flesh and to cause you to have
[1:05:50] a new nature and take on the identity of
[1:05:52] your father that you could be about the
[1:05:54] father's business. that when you walk
[1:05:56] through this earth, this old this old
[1:05:58] treacherous world, brother Mark, that
[1:06:00] you can stand and say, "But I'm about my
[1:06:02] father's business." And so I got a right
[1:06:04] to stand in a face of a devil that would
[1:06:06] torment a little child and lay hands on
[1:06:08] the child. And the devil can't remain
[1:06:10] BECAUSE I'M ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[1:06:12] And when you know your position as a son
[1:06:14] of God, then Satan has to flee from you.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He knows who your daddy is.
[1:06:20] See, see, when I'm about daddy's
[1:06:21] business, I can't I can't help but
[1:06:23] something happened in me that caused me
[1:06:25] to be about my father's business.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; See, the the world denies the power of
[1:06:30] God. It denies the Holy Ghost. They You
[1:06:32] know what they do? They'll I might get
[1:06:34] myself in trouble this morning, but it's
[1:06:35] the truth. They put on a really good
[1:06:36] image. They they put up a pretty church
[1:06:39] and and and play some pretty music and
[1:06:41] and get a a good sophisticated speaker
[1:06:44] to be able to come and make everybody
[1:06:45] feel good. Everything today is all about
[1:06:48] self-help and motivation and and to get
[1:06:50] some motivational speakers in the in the
[1:06:52] church. Try to try to just motivate
[1:06:54] everybody to feel good. Let me tell you
[1:06:56] friend, you couldn't motivate anybody
[1:06:58] anyway. There ain't nothing you could
[1:06:59] say that would motivate somebody. If
[1:07:01] somebody's motivated, it's only because
[1:07:03] they motivated themsel in the word of
[1:07:05] God. That's the only real motivation we
[1:07:07] could have. It would come from God. It
[1:07:09] would come from the WORD OF GOD.
[1:07:11] EVERYTHING ELSE will fail. IT'LL FAIL
[1:07:13] YOU. IT'LL FALL ON ITS FACE. YOU'LL
[1:07:15] NEVER MAKE IT ANOTHER DAY. But if you
[1:07:17] never get a HOLD OF THIS, BROTHER MARK,
[1:07:18] IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO BE ABLE TO STAND AS A
[1:07:21] SON OF GOD. It don't matter what kind of
[1:07:22] business you have. I don't care what you
[1:07:24] sell. I don't care what you build. I
[1:07:26] don't care where you work. If you could
[1:07:28] ever have this, brother Mark, it'll
[1:07:30] motivate you to get through life. It'll
[1:07:31] cause you to go on the job force and be
[1:07:33] a son of God. IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO WALK
[1:07:35] DOWN THE STREET AND BE A DAUGHTER of
[1:07:37] God, motivated by God's by God's word.
[1:07:41] You see, they they they they they deny
[1:07:43] the power of God, which gives you the
[1:07:45] ability to be about the father's
[1:07:47] business. You know, it's the truth
[1:07:48] because the church world denies a new
[1:07:50] birth. You know that that that the
[1:07:52] denominational world, they deny a
[1:07:54] filling of the Holy Ghost. You know,
[1:07:56] they well, you know, that was for the
[1:07:57] disciples and they, you know, after all
[1:07:59] that was for the apostles, the Holy
[1:08:01] Spirit, it fell upon them. But, but God
[1:08:03] couldn't allow the spirit, you mean the
[1:08:05] very spirit of God is going to dwell in
[1:08:07] the soul of a human being? You mean the
[1:08:10] very life of God? Is that so far? My
[1:08:12] what a far-fetched thought that the life
[1:08:14] of the creator God that came down into
[1:08:17] the man Jesus that that same spirit that
[1:08:20] ascended, it came down to the earth and
[1:08:22] it would dwell in the heart of every one
[1:08:24] of these believers. You mean to tell me
[1:08:26] THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN DWELL IN A HUMAN
[1:08:28] BEING? YES, SIR.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But they deny it as a supernatural
[1:08:33] power. Isn't that what Mary done?
[1:08:35] Remember when Jesus was down there in
[1:08:37] the temple that day? And here whenever
[1:08:39] his mother came to him. You notice what
[1:08:41] she said? She said, "We've been looking
[1:08:43] for you for days." She said, "Your
[1:08:44] father and I, we've been looking for
[1:08:46] you. Why would you put us through this?"
[1:08:48] You notice what she done? But said,
[1:08:50] "Here's what she done. She denied his
[1:08:52] supernatural birth." Said, "So, because
[1:08:54] she denied his supernatural birth, he
[1:08:56] couldn't." It's the same thing the world
[1:08:58] has done today. They've denied a
[1:09:00] supernatural birth. You can be a
[1:09:01] Christian. You can go to church. You can
[1:09:03] sit in the temple. You can raise your
[1:09:05] hand. You can praise God. But they deny
[1:09:07] a supernatural birth. They don't go into
[1:09:10] a new birth. Said, "See, and because she
[1:09:12] done that, she denied the birth of the
[1:09:14] word. It's easy to take everything else.
[1:09:16] I'll take going to church. I just can't
[1:09:18] take the birth of the word. I'll take
[1:09:19] I'll take raising my hand. I'll take
[1:09:21] putting a little money in the offering
[1:09:23] plate. I just can't I just can't accept
[1:09:24] the birth of the word." He said, "That's
[1:09:26] the same thing Mary done. She denied the
[1:09:28] birth of the word." He said, "And
[1:09:30] because that but watch what Jesus done."
[1:09:33] He said, "Don't you know that I must be
[1:09:36] about my father's business?" Said, "HERE
[1:09:38] WAS THE CHURCH COMING TO HIM SAYING,
[1:09:40] "Where have you been? Your father and I,
[1:09:42] we've been looking." Isn't that just the
[1:09:44] way? Don't that just sound like an
[1:09:45] organization to come over and brood over
[1:09:47] everybody and keep them in line and
[1:09:49] why'd you preach that? And why'd you say
[1:09:51] that? And that ain't what was on the
[1:09:53] pamphlet. And y'all need to stay in line
[1:09:54] with the organization. AND Y'ALL NEED TO
[1:09:56] KEEP GOING. Y'ALL NEED TO SAY IT LIKE I
[1:09:58] SAY IT OR you know, REPEAT IT LIKE THE
[1:10:00] BISHOP SAID IT. YOU NEED TO PRAY LIKE
[1:10:02] THE LIKE THE BISHOP PRAYS.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BUT I MUST BE ABOUT MY
[1:10:06] FATHER'S BUSINESS."
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "See what happened?" He said,
[1:10:09] "The word came and corrected the
[1:10:11] church." Friends, let me tell you,
[1:10:13] that's a that's a mouthful right there.
[1:10:15] The church ain't coming to correct the
[1:10:17] word. The word comes to correct the
[1:10:19] church. He took the hierarchy of it and
[1:10:21] tore it down to its roots. He said, He
[1:10:24] said, "I must be about MY FATHER'S
[1:10:26] BUSINESS." WOMAN, LISTEN TO ME. I MUST
[1:10:28] BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS. WHO ART
[1:10:30] THOU, OH GREAT WOMAN, THAT WOULD DENY
[1:10:33] THE POWER OF GOD? WHO ART THOU, OH GREAT
[1:10:35] CHURCH THAT WOULD DENY THE POWER OF GOD
[1:10:37] AND THE INDWELLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT in
[1:10:40] the children of almighty God?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Said the word came and corrected the
[1:10:47] church. So what is the father's
[1:10:48] business? Said it's to fulfill what the
[1:10:50] scripture said about him.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Moses said the Lord your God shall raise
[1:10:55] up a prophet among you like it unto bee.
[1:10:57] He had to fulfill it. Isaiah said, "A
[1:10:59] virgin shall conceive." The Bible said,
[1:11:01] "The lame would leap like a heart. The
[1:11:03] blind would see. The dumb would speak.
[1:11:05] He must fulfill what the word said about
[1:11:08] him." See, it was his father's business
[1:11:10] to fulfill what the word had spoken of
[1:11:12] him. But say, "See, if that was the
[1:11:14] father's business, so if that's the
[1:11:15] father's business for Christ to fulfill
[1:11:17] the word, then what do you think his
[1:11:19] business is now?"
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right, sister Lillian? Is if
[1:11:22] that was his business then, what is his
[1:11:25] business now? Brother said, "A spirit
[1:11:27] has come upon the bride to do the same
[1:11:30] things that he did."
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; My isn't that powerful?
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; If it was his business then, what is his
[1:11:36] He hadn't he hadn't gotten into a new
[1:11:37] business.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; He don't just jump from thing to thing.
[1:11:40] This ain't this ain't our God. But if
[1:11:42] that was his business then, that's his
[1:11:44] business now.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something that even as a boy as
[1:11:48] a young boy that he would be able to
[1:11:51] say, "But I must be about my father's
[1:11:53] business." But said, "Isn't it
[1:11:54] something?" He was so young. He said,
[1:11:56] 'But even the word when it was in its
[1:11:58] infancy, it still yet spake for itself.
[1:12:01] Said, "No, don't you know that I must be
[1:12:03] about my father?" I thought, "My isn't
[1:12:04] it something?" If the word in its
[1:12:06] infancy could say, "I've got to be about
[1:12:07] my father's business." Then what about a
[1:12:09] word in its maturity?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; How much more aren't we in this age to
[1:12:12] be able to look at the world and say,
[1:12:14] "But I must be about my father's
[1:12:16] business." Don't let Satan rob you of
[1:12:18] what the father's business is. I must be
[1:12:21] about my father's business. what we're
[1:12:22] doing is ordained of God before the
[1:12:25] foundation of the world. IT'S WHAT GOD
[1:12:27] HAS CALLED us to. We don't need
[1:12:28] permission. I don't need no man to sign
[1:12:30] off on it. I don't need an organization
[1:12:32] TO BACK US TO SAY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO DO
[1:12:34] IT. BUT WE MUST BE ABOUT OUR FATHER'S
[1:12:37] BUSINESS.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; For we're sons and daughters of God.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; So, see, we must be about our father's
[1:12:44] business. And that's the secret of the
[1:12:45] message is the father's business. And
[1:12:47] the bride, see, what she's going to do,
[1:12:48] she's going to fulfill the what the word
[1:12:50] said about it. That's what he done. So
[1:12:52] what that's that's what we'll do.
[1:12:54] Whatever the word said about you, you
[1:12:55] must fulfill.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that something? Can I just
[1:12:58] make this plain this morning?
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; The father's business is for you to
[1:13:02] fulfill what the word said about you.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; That's how you're about the father's
[1:13:07] business. How how can I be pleasing unto
[1:13:09] God? Fulfill what the word said about
[1:13:11] you.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He said she'd lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:14] they recover. So lay hands on the sick
[1:13:16] and watch them recover. It's pleasing to
[1:13:18] the father because you're fulfilling
[1:13:20] what the word said about you.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; He said in my name they would cast out
[1:13:24] devils. Fulfill what the word said about
[1:13:26] you. She would she would be holy. How?
[1:13:29] By the blood of Jesus Christ. She would
[1:13:30] be unblameable by the blood of Jesus
[1:13:32] Christ. She would be unreprovable in his
[1:13:34] sight. I want to fulfill what the word
[1:13:36] said about me.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; See, we're in the father's business to
[1:13:40] vindicate what the prophets
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; have written. Do I have a few minutes?
[1:13:45] So that means we got to vindicate the
[1:13:47] whole scripture. I don't I'm not going
[1:13:48] to go through them all, but it don't
[1:13:49] matter what it is. You see what the
[1:13:51] world does that but it's okay, but I
[1:13:53] don't want to vindicate all the
[1:13:54] scripture. That's where Satan comes in.
[1:13:56] Well, that ain't the father's business
[1:13:57] no more. When they come in and deny
[1:13:59] scripture and say, "Well, I don't
[1:14:01] believe in that." And you know, somebody
[1:14:02] asked me the other day, "Where where can
[1:14:04] you find uh uh uh brother Brandham in
[1:14:06] the Bible?" One of the boys asked me,
[1:14:07] you know, "Where can you find Brother
[1:14:08] Bam in the Bible?" I said, he said,
[1:14:09] "Does it take a revelation?" I said,
[1:14:11] "No, that don't even take a revelation.
[1:14:12] Anybody can read can read that. All you
[1:14:14] got to do is go to Ephesians the 4th
[1:14:15] chapter and read it. The Bible says he
[1:14:17] gave some he called some uh uh pastors
[1:14:20] and teachers and preachers and apostles
[1:14:22] and prophets. I said Paul said that God
[1:14:24] sent him to the church. So for you to
[1:14:27] accept a a prophet is as easy as
[1:14:29] accepting a pastor. That that that that
[1:14:31] don't take a great revelation if you can
[1:14:32] look at a man and say he's a pastor.
[1:14:34] He's a God-cent pastor because you
[1:14:36] believe he's anointed of God. So it
[1:14:38] doesn't take a great revelation. But
[1:14:39] what the world does, it just cuts part
[1:14:41] of it out and say, "Well, I'll take a
[1:14:42] pastor and I'll take an evangelist and
[1:14:44] an apostle and we'll call them teachers,
[1:14:46] but we don't use the word prophet no
[1:14:48] more." Even though Paul said it was a
[1:14:49] part of the five-fold ministry.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; So, see, so God sent it all. So, we just
[1:14:53] accept that God sent it. So, then, so,
[1:14:56] so it makes it this is all free, but it
[1:14:59] makes it easy to be able to see that a
[1:15:01] prophet is just one that prophesies.
[1:15:02] That ain't hard to see. Matter of fact,
[1:15:04] Amos 3:7, he said, "Surely the Lord will
[1:15:06] do nothing unless he first would reveal
[1:15:08] it to his prophet."
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; He would never do anything in this world
[1:15:12] unless he would first send a prophet to
[1:15:14] be able to reveal it. So that that that
[1:15:16] ain't a hard thing to see. A man that
[1:15:17] prophesies is a prophet. So the question
[1:15:20] is not whether there's a prophet or not.
[1:15:22] The Bible says there's prophets. The
[1:15:24] question is is whether a prophet is a
[1:15:26] true prophet or a false prophet. That's
[1:15:28] where the question is. And so you say,
[1:15:30] "Well, how do you determine that?" Will
[1:15:32] you see if what he said really took
[1:15:34] place?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Can I make it any easier? So if he said
[1:15:37] I if a prophet prophesied, that's why
[1:15:39] these brothers was ministering saying
[1:15:41] that 8,000 times recorded on tape that a
[1:15:43] prophet of God was took look at
[1:15:45] somebody's life and tell them where they
[1:15:47] came from and what their name was and
[1:15:48] where they're from. And not one time out
[1:15:50] of 8,000 times did the person say, "No,
[1:15:53] sir, you're wrong. That ain't right.
[1:15:54] That ain't my name." But every time they
[1:15:56] said, "That ain't nothing but the
[1:15:57] truth."
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So right out of the Bible, that's an
[1:16:00] easy thing to see. that God that God
[1:16:03] that God has a prophet. So we want to
[1:16:04] vindicate every scripture
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; to be about the father's business is to
[1:16:08] accept every scripture. It's to
[1:16:10] vindicate Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the
[1:16:13] same yesterday, today, and forever. Bram
[1:16:15] said, "Vindicate all of his word to v
[1:16:17] vindicate Revelations 10th chapter, the
[1:16:19] opening of the seals, the opening of the
[1:16:21] seals and the mysteries of God, even the
[1:16:24] serpent seed, all would be manifested,
[1:16:26] marriage and divorce, all these other
[1:16:27] mysteries that's been hid under the
[1:16:29] pillars for all these years from
[1:16:31] theologians and so forth. But now, it's
[1:16:33] the hour that is the father's business."
[1:16:36] So all of this time that these things
[1:16:38] have been healed, hid mysteries of God
[1:16:41] that have been hid down through the
[1:16:42] ages, it's been hid. He said, "But it's
[1:16:44] now the hour." That's the father's
[1:16:47] business. Now, isn't it something to
[1:16:48] live in the hour that the father's
[1:16:50] business would be fulfilled? Friends,
[1:16:52] let me tell you, don't you put it off
[1:16:53] for another day. It ain't for another
[1:16:55] generation. It ain't for a day gone by.
[1:16:58] It ain't FOR ANOTHER PERSON. I SAY IT'S
[1:17:00] FOR YOU THIS MORNING. IT'S FOR EVERY
[1:17:02] BORN AGAIN SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. IT'S
[1:17:05] THE HOUR TO VINDICATE. JOHN 14:12, "THE
[1:17:08] WORKS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO." IT'S
[1:17:11] THE HOUR TO VINDICATE JESUS CHRIST IS
[1:17:14] THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:17:16] IT'S THE HOUR OF LAYING ON THE HANDS.
[1:17:18] IT'S THE HOUR AT THE NAME OF JESUS THAT
[1:17:21] DEMONS WOULD FLEE. IT'S THE HOUR THAT
[1:17:23] BIBLE PROPHECY IS FULFILLED. IT'S THE
[1:17:26] HOUR THAT THE SON OF GOD IS MADE
[1:17:28] MANIFEST.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Won't somebody praise the Lord this
[1:17:32] morning? I SAID THIS IS THE HOUR.
[1:17:36] It's the hour that the father's business
[1:17:38] is being done in this age. It's the hour
[1:17:41] that the death would hear the words of
[1:17:43] THE BOOK. IT'S THE HOUR OF THE REVEALING
[1:17:45] OF THE SON OF MAN. IT'S THE HOUR THAT
[1:17:47] THE BRIDE WOULD BE IN HER POSITION. IT'S
[1:17:50] THE HOUR OF THE COMING OF THE LORD. IT'S
[1:17:52] THE HOUR THAT THE RAPTURE IS AT HAND.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of Malachi 4. It's the
[1:17:58] hour of the coming of Elijah. It's the
[1:18:00] hour that the heart of the children will
[1:18:02] be turned back to the fathers.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of a restoration of faith.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Said it's the hour of the father's
[1:18:10] business.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; This is the hour we live in. Ain't that
[1:18:14] right? This is the hour
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; that the faith of the church. You
[1:18:17] realize what it would take to make a
[1:18:18] rapture.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It would take faith. Isn't it something
[1:18:22] that God would say before the coming of
[1:18:24] the great and dreadful day of the Lord?
[1:18:25] Before the coming of this great day of
[1:18:27] judgment, when there wouldn't be a stone
[1:18:29] left upon a stone, when all the world
[1:18:31] would be burned over, but before that,
[1:18:33] behold, I will send unto you Elijah the
[1:18:35] prophet before the coming of this great
[1:18:37] and dreadful day. What was his purpose?
[1:18:39] It was to turn the hearts of the
[1:18:41] children back to their fathers. In other
[1:18:43] words, it would take them back to the
[1:18:44] original faith.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; You see, the very thing that we needed
[1:18:47] for a rapture was faith. Isn't it
[1:18:50] something that God would send that in
[1:18:51] the last day before there would be
[1:18:53] judgment? He would send what was needed
[1:18:55] to give faith.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, God don't want you to
[1:18:59] miss out of the rapture. So, he brought
[1:19:01] the very thing that would restore faith.
[1:19:03] I'll say it like this. Not only did he
[1:19:05] bring the very thing that would restore
[1:19:06] faith, he brought the only thing that
[1:19:08] would restore faith. There ain't no
[1:19:09] other church, there ain't no other
[1:19:11] teaching, there ain't no other
[1:19:12] revelation outside of the message of the
[1:19:14] hour that'll ever take a bride into the
[1:19:16] rapture.
[1:19:19] I know people say that. Well, you know,
[1:19:21] oh gosh, help me.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There ain't nobody can live above
[1:19:26] the the pastor. They got the greatest
[1:19:27] revelation. Let me tell you, there God
[1:19:29] couldn't give you a revelation greater
[1:19:31] than this message.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; I'm just being plain to you this
[1:19:35] morning. He couldn't give you a greater
[1:19:36] revelation. That's the greatest
[1:19:38] revelation that you can find is in the
[1:19:40] message. It's what brought rapturing
[1:19:42] faith to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:44] Listen what Jesus said. You see here
[1:19:47] when when he would when he would speak
[1:19:48] of his coming he said when the son of
[1:19:51] man comes he said shall I find what?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Shall I find faith when I return?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You see the concern. What's missing in
[1:19:59] the world today? Shall I find faith? He
[1:20:02] said see that was the question. It
[1:20:03] wasn't will I find churches. There's all
[1:20:05] kinds of churches. Not will I find
[1:20:07] sincerity or will I find teachers or
[1:20:09] will I find them preaching the Bible?
[1:20:11] Will I find them doing this? He said
[1:20:13] will I find faith? He said, "Not will I
[1:20:16] find power." They've got power.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; The church has more power than it's ever
[1:20:20] had. He said, "But what you need is
[1:20:21] faith to positionally know where you are
[1:20:24] in Christ and then yield yourself to
[1:20:26] it."
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "Yield yourself to what?" Yield
[1:20:28] yourself to your position in Christ
[1:20:30] Jesus.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Have faith in the position that God has
[1:20:34] called you to
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; and yield yourself to that position and
[1:20:38] then watch God use you.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; You think God's using you now, just
[1:20:41] yield yourself into that position and
[1:20:43] see what God does with you. out in the
[1:20:45] marketplace. It don't matter wherever
[1:20:46] you are or what you do. You'll be the
[1:20:48] greatest there ever was at it when you
[1:20:50] yield to the Holy Ghost and to the
[1:20:52] purpose of God. Said yield to your
[1:20:54] position in Christ. Said, see, think
[1:20:57] about said what he could have asked, he
[1:20:59] could have just said, will Malachi 4 be
[1:21:01] fulfilled during this time? He said,
[1:21:03] instead of saying, will I find faith, he
[1:21:04] could have just said, will Malachi 4 be
[1:21:06] fulfilled?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Because that's where faith come from.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; It was a restoration of faith. He says
[1:21:11] to restore the faith of the children
[1:21:12] back to the faith of the fathers, the
[1:21:14] original word. See, so when he comes,
[1:21:16] will he find Malachi 4 fulfilled? This
[1:21:19] is what Jesus was asking. Will I find
[1:21:21] that the message has gone forth? Will I
[1:21:24] find that this ministry of Elijah has
[1:21:26] reached its mark? Will I find that the
[1:21:28] faith of the people has been restored?
[1:21:30] Will I find that there has been an ear
[1:21:32] to hear it? Will I find there's been an
[1:21:34] eye to be able to see it? Will I find
[1:21:36] the faith of God restored in the hearts
[1:21:38] of God's believing children? See, the
[1:21:40] message restores faith. Not faith in a
[1:21:43] man,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; not faith in a prophet. That's right.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Can I just be blunt? The message
[1:21:47] restores faith in God.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; What's missing in this world, this
[1:21:50] message restored faith in almighty God.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It restored the faith that people
[1:21:56] instead of looking to a church and
[1:21:57] instead of looking to a religion,
[1:21:59] instead of that people get so mixed up,
[1:22:01] they get pastor religion and and and
[1:22:03] preacher religion to where they're
[1:22:05] following after somebody and they'll
[1:22:06] make a deity out of a man. It don't
[1:22:08] matter what he says. It's thus sayeth
[1:22:10] the Lord. It don't matter if it don't
[1:22:11] come to pass. But but that ain't what
[1:22:13] he's calling us to. He's calling us to a
[1:22:15] faith. The message is to restore faith
[1:22:17] in God.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "So turn your hearts back to
[1:22:20] the original father, not our earthly
[1:22:22] father, our grandfather, great
[1:22:24] grandfather, but the original father."
[1:22:26] It's a turning BACK TO OUR HEAVENLY
[1:22:28] FATHER. THE FAITH OF GOD THAT WOULD BE
[1:22:30] BACK in the heart of the believer again.
[1:22:33] said our faith in God. It's what it's
[1:22:35] restoring is our faith in God and in his
[1:22:37] ability to use man. See, that's what the
[1:22:40] church would need for a rapture is
[1:22:41] faith. And that's just what the message
[1:22:43] provided.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; My have you ever noticed that whenever
[1:22:45] you sit down and listen to a message,
[1:22:47] you get to the end of one of those
[1:22:48] sermons and the prophet of God begins to
[1:22:50] discern hearts. How many listen to that
[1:22:52] and immediately it gives you faith?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; There's something about it. It does
[1:22:55] something super I said how many I mean,
[1:22:57] come on. Y'all got to be better than
[1:22:58] that. How many does it give you faith?
[1:23:00] But it it's something supernatural that
[1:23:02] takes place to see the hand of God
[1:23:03] moving. The purpose of it was to restore
[1:23:06] faith. It was to return our hearts. And
[1:23:08] says, "See, we got the best doctors
[1:23:10] we've ever had. We got the best
[1:23:11] hospitals, got the best drugs we've ever
[1:23:13] had, we've ever practiced with, but yet
[1:23:15] we have more sickness than we've ever
[1:23:17] had. We've got the worst, you know, we
[1:23:19] have the uh the the worst uh sickness
[1:23:21] we've ever had." He says, "Not we got
[1:23:22] the best doctors, got the best medicine,
[1:23:24] got the best scientists, all that's
[1:23:26] better, but sickness is worse." He said,
[1:23:28] "The reason it's worse is because we got
[1:23:29] the worst pull pits that we've ever had.
[1:23:32] The churches are weaker than they've
[1:23:33] ever been. The pull pits are the weakest
[1:23:35] we've ever had. They may be the best
[1:23:37] churches, the best educated men you've
[1:23:39] ever had, but we've got the weakest
[1:23:41] churches that we've ever had. And
[1:23:42] there's more sin than the world has ever
[1:23:44] known of. Friends, I could take an hour
[1:23:47] telling you about what the world has
[1:23:48] done and the things of the world has
[1:23:50] done to the churches that that was
[1:23:52] supposed to be churches of God where
[1:23:53] they used to be powerhouses and standing
[1:23:56] upon the word of God. But the weakness
[1:23:58] and the deceitfulness of Satan has
[1:24:00] inhabited the pull pits of what's
[1:24:02] supposed to be God's men and they became
[1:24:04] weak pullpits and weak churches and the
[1:24:06] church is filled with sin and things OF
[1:24:08] THE WORLD. BUT THANK GOD THAT HE WOULD
[1:24:10] SEND A MESSAGE in this HOUR THAT WOULD
[1:24:12] SAY GET BACK TO THE FAITH OF GOD AND
[1:24:15] RESTORE THE STRENGTH OF GOD TO THE
[1:24:17] PULLPIT AND PUT MEN OF GOD THAT LIVES
[1:24:19] ARE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL THAT CAN
[1:24:21] SURRENDER TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AND ALLOW
[1:24:24] GOD TO LEAD HIS CHURCH.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; WE ain't looking to be LED BY MEN. WE'RE
[1:24:28] LOOKING to be led by God.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; The ideas of men and thoughts of men is
[1:24:33] for days gone by when it comes to
[1:24:34] believers. I want to be led of God. I
[1:24:36] ain't looking to be led of men. And I
[1:24:38] ain't looking to be pampered. This ain't
[1:24:39] no pampered hybrid church. It's a body
[1:24:42] of believers that takes the word of God
[1:24:44] and restores their faith that one day we
[1:24:46] CAN WALK OUT OF THIS EARTH AND GO RIGHT
[1:24:48] UP INTO THE HEAVENS.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S A RAPTURING CHURCH. It's a
[1:24:52] rapturing bride with a restored faith in
[1:24:55] the word of God.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Our faith is not in men.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Our faith is in God's word.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Said we got the worst pullpits. It's the
[1:25:03] weakest we ever known. He said, 'The
[1:25:04] reason it's so weak is because there's
[1:25:05] more sin than the world has ever known
[1:25:07] of. He said, "What is sin?" It's
[1:25:08] unbelief.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "He that believeth not
[1:25:11] is condemned already. It's unbelief." He
[1:25:13] said, "There's your sin." He said, "See,
[1:25:15] not spoken and drinking, that's just
[1:25:16] attributes of unbelief." But you're a
[1:25:18] sinner because you don't believe. It's
[1:25:20] no wonder Satan attacks this message so
[1:25:22] much because the message restores faith
[1:25:24] and faith gives you power over unbelief.
[1:25:28] So, if this is the worst age of
[1:25:29] unbelief, worth worse than it's ever
[1:25:31] been,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; then no wonder there's such an attack
[1:25:33] upon this message
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; is because this is the only thing
[1:25:36] that'll give you faith to overcome that
[1:25:38] unbelief. He said it's pleasing.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; It's pleasing to the father.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Can I wrap this up? It's pleasing to the
[1:25:45] father.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He said what he wanted to do, he loved
[1:25:48] fatherhood.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; For he was a father
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; and the only way he could express
[1:25:53] himself in that it was to become a son.
[1:25:56] Amen. That's the reason Jesus kept
[1:25:58] saying son of man. They didn't
[1:26:00] understand what he was saying. Said, but
[1:26:01] that's the reason he kept saying son of
[1:26:03] man. He said, now now we get it. See, he
[1:26:05] wanted to express himself. That was his
[1:26:07] one of his great three-fold purposes was
[1:26:09] to express himself, identify himself
[1:26:11] with human beings, to reveal himself in
[1:26:14] Christ.
[1:26:15] See, so if it pleased God, brother Mark,
[1:26:17] that the fullness of God would dwell in
[1:26:19] Christ, then how much more does it
[1:26:21] please God, that the fullness of Christ
[1:26:24] would be poured into this gentile
[1:26:26] church.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you that's right in the
[1:26:28] Bible?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Because Christ in you is the
[1:26:32] hope of glory."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; But said, "If the life of Jesus Christ
[1:26:35] lives in the person, they become
[1:26:37] identified with him. It's Christ in you.
[1:26:39] Not a church member, not a system, but a
[1:26:42] resurrected power. It's the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] is a token upon you that your life says
[1:26:47] amen to every scripture. The promises
[1:26:49] that are written in there and you are
[1:26:51] not yourself anymore, but you are Christ
[1:26:54] and you don't even think your own
[1:26:55] thoughts. Oh friends, whenever you get
[1:26:57] to a place that you can read the word of
[1:26:59] God and even when you don't understand
[1:27:00] it, but something in you said, "That
[1:27:02] ain't nothing but the truth. It's God's
[1:27:04] word. I don't know how I can live it,
[1:27:05] but I'm going to live it because God
[1:27:07] said it. I don't know how I can do it,
[1:27:09] but I'm going to do it cuz GOD SAID IT.
[1:27:10] I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, BUT I'M GOING TO
[1:27:12] AMEN IT BECAUSE GOD SAID IT. BECAUSE
[1:27:14] CHRIST IN YOU IS THE HOPE OF GLORY. He
[1:27:17] said, "You're not yourself no more. You
[1:27:19] are Christ. The life that was in Christ
[1:27:21] is in you. The mind that was in Christ
[1:27:24] that was in you. And the works that were
[1:27:26] in Christ is in you
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; because Christ himself is in you. As a
[1:27:32] believer, you are dead. Your life is
[1:27:34] hiding God through Christ, sealed in
[1:27:37] there by the Holy Ghost. And no longer
[1:27:39] are you your own, but you are his.
[1:27:41] Somebody say, "I am his."
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You're not your own, but you ARE HIS
[1:27:45] BECAUSE HE DWELLETH IN YOU.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; The fullness of God poured into his
[1:27:50] church.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, don't you realize that when
[1:27:53] he said you're dead, your life in God is
[1:27:55] hid in God through Christ, sealed in by
[1:27:57] the Holy Ghost, and now you're not your
[1:27:59] own. And now, Brother Benji, you've
[1:28:02] obtained the greatest gift that God has
[1:28:04] ever given to this earth. Friends, let
[1:28:06] me tell you, there's a lot of things
[1:28:07] that men are looking for. They're
[1:28:09] looking for great gifts. Oh, they want
[1:28:10] the gifts of prophecy or the the gifts
[1:28:12] of tongues or or the gifts of healing.
[1:28:14] ALL ALL THESE GREAT GIFTS THAT MEN are
[1:28:16] looking for. But do you realize the
[1:28:18] greatest gift that God ever gave? It was
[1:28:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It was
[1:28:22] even greater than Jesus Christ coming to
[1:28:24] the earth. For by Christ, the Holy Ghost
[1:28:26] came.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Said it was the greatest gift that God
[1:28:29] ever gave. He died that he might that he
[1:28:32] might come. His son died that he might
[1:28:34] come. He said he came by the Holy Spirit
[1:28:36] when they called him be elabub. Jesus
[1:28:38] said you can speak evil against me and
[1:28:40] I'll forgive you. But there's one coming
[1:28:42] after me and not one word ever spoken
[1:28:44] against it'll never be forgiven in this
[1:28:46] world or in the world to come. It's the
[1:28:48] greatest gift that God has ever given to
[1:28:50] the world was the Holy Spirit. Brother
[1:28:53] Bam said and here it is. And this is a
[1:28:55] greater day than that was the Holy
[1:28:58] Spirit working universally in his
[1:29:01] church. I to think about that this
[1:29:03] morning that in the days of Jesus, the
[1:29:05] Holy Spirit was poured into Christ and
[1:29:07] he worked throughout Jerusalem and Judea
[1:29:10] and Samaria and everywhere he walked.
[1:29:12] The works of God was EXPRESSED IN HIM.
[1:29:15] HE SAID, "BUT THIS IS A GREATER DAY THAN
[1:29:16] THAT WAS BECAUSE THE WORKS OF JESUS
[1:29:19] CHRIST are being WORKED UNIVERSALLY IN
[1:29:22] THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD." FRIENDS,
[1:29:23] let me tell you, WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE
[1:29:25] PAST. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN HISTORY. This
[1:29:27] ain't a God OF DAY GONE BY. I THANK GOD
[1:29:30] WE'RE LIVING IN THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:29:32] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND THE REVEALED
[1:29:35] WORD OF GOD THAT'S BEEN OPEN TO THE
[1:29:37] HEARTS OF EVERY believer that the that
[1:29:39] the life of Jesus Christ could be
[1:29:41] manifested in them. He said it's a
[1:29:43] greater day the word the the the the the
[1:29:46] Holy Spirit working in his church today.
[1:29:48] He said you think of it think of it that
[1:29:51] you're living in the greatest day that
[1:29:53] there ever was.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; You've received the greatest gift that
[1:29:56] God ever sent. Now, ain't that powerful?
[1:30:00] I know we ask God for things, but do you
[1:30:01] realize the greatest thing you could
[1:30:03] pray for?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing you could ever ask
[1:30:05] God for was the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:07] Ghost.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's the life of God.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You see, it's we received the greatest
[1:30:15] gift. You realize that was the
[1:30:16] revelation that was the revelation of
[1:30:18] Paul's mystery.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, even the mystery which
[1:30:22] hath been hid, I'm gonna close with
[1:30:24] this.
[1:30:25] Even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:30:27] ages and from generations,
[1:30:30] but now is made manifest to his saints,
[1:30:33] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:30:35] riches of the glory of his mystery among
[1:30:39] the Gentiles, which is Christ in you,
[1:30:42] the hope of glory.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I think this is powerful how Paul words
[1:30:46] this. the riches of the glory of this
[1:30:49] mystery. Riches comes from that Greek
[1:30:50] word Plutos which means to be valuable
[1:30:54] or a treasure or something of great
[1:30:56] wealth. So here Paul was saying there is
[1:30:59] a glory of this mystery. He's talking
[1:31:01] about God moving among the Gentiles here
[1:31:05] for so long that it never happened. It
[1:31:07] was a mystery to the church. how that
[1:31:09] God that that called Israel his people
[1:31:11] and God that created this great nation
[1:31:13] that God would have another nation
[1:31:15] outside of that whenever whenever
[1:31:17] whenever that these were the people of
[1:31:19] God he says so here lays this great
[1:31:21] mystery he said but there's a glory of
[1:31:23] this mystery but the value of the glory
[1:31:26] is Christ dwelling in you
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is the value of the
[1:31:30] mystery Christ in you is the treasure of
[1:31:34] the mystery of God isn't that powerful
[1:31:36] that's the very treasure when you talk
[1:31:37] about the mystery of God being revealed
[1:31:39] in a gentile. Paul said, "But the
[1:31:41] treasure of it is Christ in you." The
[1:31:44] treasure is the same God that was poured
[1:31:46] into Christ has been poured into the
[1:31:48] church. THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE IS. It's
[1:31:50] not the power that you have. It's not
[1:31:51] the ability that you have. IT'S NOT WHO
[1:31:53] YOU BECOME, BUT IT'S THAT GOD THAT
[1:31:56] CREATED THE HEAVEN AND EARTH. BUT WE be
[1:31:58] willing TO POUR HIMSELF INTO A BODY OF
[1:32:00] PEOPLE. It's the treasure
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; of the of the mystery of God. It's no
[1:32:05] wonder the Bible would say he's a
[1:32:07] treasure in earth and vessels. Brother
[1:32:09] Joe's message. It's no wonder he said
[1:32:11] that. He said because the same treasure
[1:32:12] that was in Jesus is the same treasure
[1:32:15] that's been poured into you. It's the
[1:32:16] treasure of the glory of the mystery. It
[1:32:19] was Christ in you. Friend, don't you
[1:32:21] realize that's always been God's plan is
[1:32:23] to bring a revelation of himself among
[1:32:24] the Gentile people. He was first made
[1:32:26] known to the Jews, then he was made
[1:32:28] known to the Gentile. He said, see, and
[1:32:30] that's what God is, think back. That's
[1:32:31] what God is still doing today. He is
[1:32:33] making known the riches of his glory.
[1:32:37] He's making known that's what God every
[1:32:39] time he pours his spirit I'm I'm just
[1:32:41] going to say it. But every time he pours
[1:32:42] his spirit out and one of you young
[1:32:44] people, it's God making known the riches
[1:32:46] of his glory. Every time you see a young
[1:32:49] heart that's been drugged around BY SOME
[1:32:51] DENOMINATION and all of a sudden the
[1:32:53] spirit of the Lord begins to deal with
[1:32:54] their HEART AND THEY COME OUT OF ALL
[1:32:56] THAT and they recognize WHO THEY ARE AND
[1:32:58] THEIR IDENTITY IS REVEALED AND GOD POURS
[1:33:01] HIS SPIRIT INTO THEM. IT'S GOD MAKING
[1:33:04] KNOWN THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY. It's the
[1:33:07] riches of God being made known in you.
[1:33:09] Friends, let me tell you. Let me tell
[1:33:11] you, there's signs of the riches of
[1:33:13] God's glory.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I remember brother Dave sending me a
[1:33:16] picture here a while back. He said, "If
[1:33:18] I if I ever he make a joke, he said, "If
[1:33:20] I if I ever won millions of dollars," he
[1:33:22] said, "I wouldn't tell nobody, but
[1:33:24] there'd definitely be signs." Had a
[1:33:26] picture of a bologn sandwich. The
[1:33:27] baloney was about that thick. Said
[1:33:29] there'd definitely be signs. But I'd
[1:33:32] have better signs than that.
[1:33:34] But but but if I ever but if I had
[1:33:38] wealth, there'd be signs. If you had if
[1:33:40] you if you were given great wealth,
[1:33:42] there there'd be there be God bless you,
[1:33:45] brother Dave. Thank you, buddy.
[1:33:48] There's signs.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Wes. God bless you,
[1:33:53] brothers. Oh, man. There be signs. So,
[1:33:56] see, so that you couldn't God couldn't
[1:33:58] bestow upon you that it wasn't that it
[1:34:01] wasn't something after a little while
[1:34:02] that it would be displayed. And that's
[1:34:04] the same thing with a Holy Ghost
[1:34:05] believer. He said he's making known the
[1:34:07] riches of his glory. So, I say this this
[1:34:09] morning that it there are signs.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be a Holy Ghost
[1:34:13] believer without having signs there. If
[1:34:16] God is putting upon you the riches of
[1:34:18] his glory, there's going to be signs
[1:34:20] there. The riches of his glory will be
[1:34:22] made known. It it it's a treasure that
[1:34:25] God has bestowed upon you and you can't
[1:34:27] hide it. And since you can't hide it,
[1:34:29] brother Wesley, you know what you do?
[1:34:30] You may as well just show it off a
[1:34:31] little bit. If God blessed you with the
[1:34:33] Holy Ghost, well, you may as well just
[1:34:34] show it off. Don't hide it from the
[1:34:36] world, but you can walk around and you
[1:34:38] can display it. Let it be manifested.
[1:34:40] Don't be ashamed of it, but you can wear
[1:34:42] it proudly knowing that it's the
[1:34:44] TREASURE IN EARTH AND VESSEL. IT'S THE
[1:34:46] very riches of God's glory that has been
[1:34:49] bestowed upon you. Friends, if you had a
[1:34:52] great treasure, you'd display it.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that what a queen when the queen
[1:34:55] comes out into her court. And my what
[1:34:57] what does she have? She's got this great
[1:34:59] crown and and great brooch, you know,
[1:35:01] that was handed down from Elizabeth II
[1:35:03] in 1952 whenever she whenever she
[1:35:06] brought that brooch in and all all these
[1:35:08] jewels and the emeralds and the rubies
[1:35:09] and the diamonds and and rings on every
[1:35:12] finger. And what is she doing? She's
[1:35:14] displaying the wealth of the crown and
[1:35:16] showing her identity as a queen. That,
[1:35:18] you know, I thought be, you know, we may
[1:35:20] not be a natural queen, but we're we're
[1:35:22] a heavenly queen. We we may not be a
[1:35:24] queen in the earth like that. We're not
[1:35:26] a an earthly queen, but we're the queen
[1:35:28] of heaven. And she's adorned with
[1:35:30] greater treasures than rubies and
[1:35:32] diamonds and gold a and silver. She's
[1:35:36] got a greater treasure. She can walk
[1:35:38] around, brother Mar. And you know what
[1:35:39] she displays? She displays the love of
[1:35:42] God, the mercy of God, the peace of God.
[1:35:44] And when people WALK AROUND HER, SHE
[1:35:46] SAY, "LOOK AT THIS ONE HERE. THAT'S
[1:35:48] FORGIVENESS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT THAT
[1:35:50] FROM MY LORD. AND LOOK AT THIS ONE.
[1:35:51] THAT'S MERCY. AND I GOT IT FROM MY LORD.
[1:35:54] AND LOOK AT THIS. IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:35:56] AND LOOK WHAT'S WEARING AROUND MY NECK
[1:35:58] SO PROUDLY. THIS IS THE HOLINESS OF MY
[1:36:00] FATHER. SHE'S BEEN ADORNED WITH THE
[1:36:02] TREASURES THAT GOD has given her in this
[1:36:04] hour. The riches of his glory has been
[1:36:08] shown upon her. the love of God, the
[1:36:10] faith of God. She's got gentleness on
[1:36:12] the ring finger. She's got kindness on
[1:36:15] her right hand. She's she she's been
[1:36:17] adorned with God's grace in an earthly
[1:36:19] queen, you know what she has? She has
[1:36:21] that great crown that she wears on
[1:36:23] coronation day. It's the crown jewel.
[1:36:26] And but but you know when the queen of
[1:36:27] heaven, you know what the Bible said?
[1:36:29] But this queen of heaven, he said in
[1:36:31] that day, Isaiah said, "Shall the Lord
[1:36:32] of hosts be for a crown of glory." We're
[1:36:36] not wearing some natural crown. But he
[1:36:38] said, "But in that day shall the Lord of
[1:36:40] hosts be for a crown of glory." Brother
[1:36:42] Ram said, "What was he speaking of in
[1:36:44] this great day that when the witness
[1:36:46] would come?" He said, "What is our
[1:36:48] crown? It's the Holy Spirit that crowns
[1:36:50] us. It'll be a crown of glory for a
[1:36:53] diadem of beauty under the residue of
[1:36:56] his people." Friends, you know what that
[1:36:58] tells me? This crown that God gave you,
[1:37:00] it wasn't given by a man. IT WAS GIVEN
[1:37:02] BY GOD. SO WEAR IT PROUDLY. IT WAS GOD
[1:37:05] THAT BESTOWED upon you the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:08] So wear IT PROUDLY. YOU AIN'T GOT TO be
[1:37:10] ashamed to be a DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU
[1:37:11] AIN'T GOT TO BE ASHAMED TO BE A son of
[1:37:13] God. Let the world do what they want to.
[1:37:15] But I PROUDLY STAND AND SAY, "I BELIEVE
[1:37:18] the word of God. I believe the message
[1:37:20] of THE HOUR. I'M A HOLY GHOST FIL SON
[1:37:23] AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. I'M GOING TO STAND
[1:37:25] UPON GOD'S WORD. AND I'M GOING TO WEAR
[1:37:27] PROUDLY THE RICHES OF GOD'S GLORY."
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It was him that bestowed upon you. Won't
[1:37:32] you stand to your feet this morning?
[1:37:35] I'm going to wear it and not be ashamed
[1:37:37] of it.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; It's your glory to God.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Is to wear what he has adorned you with.
[1:37:45] You know, we do many things to give
[1:37:46] glory to God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; We raise our hands. We praise him. We
[1:37:51] sing songs. We worship. We pray. They're
[1:37:53] all good things. But then after all
[1:37:56] that, seems like sometimes things happen
[1:37:59] in our life. God allows trials and
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; one day you're in a revival and then all
[1:38:05] of a sudden it seems like all that all
[1:38:07] those great things have been taken out
[1:38:09] of your life and your joys faded.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You ever notice that?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Can I give you something to take home
[1:38:14] with
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; or take home with you? Said see when
[1:38:19] Jesus said I am the true vine and my
[1:38:21] father is the husbandman.
[1:38:24] And every branch in me that beareth not
[1:38:25] fruit, he taketh away. And every branch
[1:38:28] that beareth fruit, are you ready? He
[1:38:30] taketh away the one that don't bear
[1:38:32] fruit. But the ones that does bear
[1:38:35] fruit, he purges them
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; to make it bring forth more.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we feel like, I've
[1:38:42] done everything right. I've been serving
[1:38:43] God. I I I've been believing. I've been
[1:38:46] praying. I've been at church. I've done
[1:38:48] everything. And it seems like everything
[1:38:49] else is going wrong. Why? Why is God not
[1:38:52] blessing me? Why is God bringing these
[1:38:53] curses? It's not curses. Listen to what
[1:38:56] Jesus said. He said, "The ones that bear
[1:38:58] fruit, he will purge them that it may
[1:39:01] bring forth more fruit."
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? What a husband. You
[1:39:06] know what a husband does?
[1:39:08] He would come in to the vine to dress
[1:39:11] it. I was reading an article on on a
[1:39:14] good husbandman
[1:39:16] and how that a husbandman would prune
[1:39:19] for the for the better of the vine. said
[1:39:22] the husbandman when he looks at a vine,
[1:39:24] his purpose is to prune it so that it
[1:39:28] will have correct structure and balance.
[1:39:31] So he ain't just going around just
[1:39:32] cutting off random things, but he's
[1:39:34] intentionally cutting things. And I love
[1:39:37] this. It says the first thing that a
[1:39:39] husbandman does is he comes into the
[1:39:42] vine and he removes all the old wood.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? Yes, sir.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; All the old wood. So go ahead. Let just
[1:39:50] let God take it all away. All the past
[1:39:52] and all the things you done and all the
[1:39:54] things that that that all the old habits
[1:39:57] and the old nature. The first thing he
[1:39:58] does, he just comes and cuts all that
[1:40:00] right out of your life. Now there ain't
[1:40:02] no old dead wood. Said then he would
[1:40:06] come and he would limit the fruitbearing
[1:40:09] wood because if he allows it to bloom
[1:40:12] fully, it will rob the vine of its
[1:40:15] future potential.
[1:40:18] Isn't that powerful? says, "So he would
[1:40:20] limit the fruit bearing wood." So here's
[1:40:21] some that was supposed to bring forth
[1:40:23] fruit. And a good husbandman would
[1:40:26] remove the majority of the previous
[1:40:28] year's growth. Often removing 70 to 90%
[1:40:32] of last year's growth. Ain't that
[1:40:34] something? All the way through last
[1:40:35] year, I went through revival. I've been
[1:40:36] growing in the word. I got all the way
[1:40:38] this far. And then sometimes it feels
[1:40:40] like we're going backwards. said, "But a
[1:40:42] good husband will even take up to 90% of
[1:40:45] last year's growth off of the vine so
[1:40:47] that this year it can bring forth more."
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a revelation? He says, "So he
[1:40:54] would do it to prevent overcropping and
[1:40:57] ensure the remaining fruit ripens
[1:40:59] properly.
[1:41:01] Otherwise, it would just produce up a
[1:41:03] whole bunch. It would die. Couldn't be
[1:41:05] used. It couldn't couldn't be fruitful.
[1:41:08] And then after he would prune off last
[1:41:10] year's growth to allow for more growth,
[1:41:12] he would start to shape and manage. So
[1:41:15] the purpose of the shaping and managing,
[1:41:17] he begins to encourage new growth. So he
[1:41:20] cuts away last year's growth, a big
[1:41:23] majority of it. Take you back. He prunes
[1:41:25] off. Purging. Prunes things out of your
[1:41:27] life. Purging. Taking you back to get
[1:41:30] you back to this foundation again. Now
[1:41:33] you're stronger than you was. You're
[1:41:35] going to grow better than you did last
[1:41:36] year. may seem like you went backward.
[1:41:38] It's just being purged.
[1:41:40] Said then now this year he begins to
[1:41:43] manage your growth. It encourages new
[1:41:45] growth and new shoots will emerge from
[1:41:47] you or from the the buds and it all the
[1:41:51] all the canes and spurs that was left on
[1:41:53] it will begin to to produce.
[1:41:56] Said see most of the time the the
[1:42:00] pruning is done in the winter months.
[1:42:04] Isn't that something? He'd allow
[1:42:06] coldness to come into the vine so that
[1:42:09] it would the life would begin to
[1:42:11] seemingly diminish and then he could
[1:42:14] prune it away. Said he won't prune prune
[1:42:16] it when it's flourishing. But every now
[1:42:18] and then in the summer months if
[1:42:20] necessary a good husband will prune off
[1:42:24] something even in the warm months. Even
[1:42:26] in a revival sometimes he'll keep it
[1:42:29] from getting a little wild. He may prune
[1:42:31] a little off, but generally he'll wait
[1:42:34] till there's a little coldness. And then
[1:42:36] that coldness is necessary for proper
[1:42:39] pruning of the vine. It don't mean
[1:42:41] you're lost. It don't mean you're not
[1:42:44] growing in God. It don't mean you're not
[1:42:45] going forward in the word. Let me tell
[1:42:47] you friends, be coldness is necessary
[1:42:49] for proper pruning of the vine. Said
[1:42:53] it's normal. A large amount of pruning.
[1:42:56] This is my favorite part to the good
[1:42:58] husband. It said, "Don't be afraid to
[1:43:00] cut.
[1:43:02] Cut. Don't be afraid to cut because the
[1:43:04] vines are vigorous. Most gardeners pr
[1:43:07] prune less than they should, but don't
[1:43:09] be afraid to cut. Just cut away. Cut
[1:43:10] away. Cut away because it's vigorous and
[1:43:13] it has the ability to grow back." I
[1:43:16] thought, "Isn't it something I'd say,
[1:43:17] God, don't be afraid to cut, Lord. If
[1:43:19] there's things in my life, Lord, that
[1:43:21] don't be afraid to cut. Cut it away. If
[1:43:22] it don't belong there, cut it away."
[1:43:25] that a large amount of the pruning is
[1:43:27] normal and necessary for a productive
[1:43:28] vine.
[1:43:30] He said the husbandman,
[1:43:33] he purges it that it may bring forth
[1:43:34] more fruit. Jesus said, "Now you are
[1:43:37] clean through the word which I have
[1:43:39] spoken unto you.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Abide in me and I in you. And as the
[1:43:42] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:43:44] except it abide in the vine, no more can
[1:43:46] you except you abide in me. For I am the
[1:43:48] vine and you are the branches. And he
[1:43:50] that abideth in me and I in him, the
[1:43:52] same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[1:43:53] without me you can do nothing. And if a
[1:43:55] man abide not in me, he is cast forth as
[1:43:58] a branch and withered, and men gather
[1:44:00] him and cast them into the fire, and
[1:44:02] they are burned. But if you abide in me,
[1:44:04] and my words abide in you, you shall ask
[1:44:06] what you will, and it shall be done unto
[1:44:08] you. For herein is my father glorified,
[1:44:13] that you bear much fruit, so shall you
[1:44:16] be my disciples. Friends, let me tell
[1:44:18] you, if you want to give glory to God,
[1:44:21] you can you can praise God. It's
[1:44:22] wonderful. He'll accept it. But Jesus
[1:44:24] said, "But here in is my father
[1:44:26] glorified, that you bring forth much
[1:44:28] fruit." The greatest glory that you can
[1:44:30] give God is that you can manifest the
[1:44:33] life of Jesus Christ. You can let the
[1:44:34] fruit of the spirit be manifested in
[1:44:37] your life and then God can use you out
[1:44:38] in this world. He can he can use you.
[1:44:41] Why? Why is some so effective in the
[1:44:44] world in leading souls and leading
[1:44:46] people to the Lord? It's because they're
[1:44:48] manifesting the fruits of God and
[1:44:51] they're glorifying God in that.
[1:44:55] Paul said that you may be of one mind
[1:44:58] and one mouth glorify God even the
[1:45:01] father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:45:04] Friends, I don't know about you, but
[1:45:05] that's my desire this morning is not
[1:45:08] only that my hands would glorify him or
[1:45:11] that my lips would glorify him, that my
[1:45:14] heart would glorify him. Lord, let my
[1:45:17] life bring forth fruit in that my father
[1:45:22] would be glorified.
