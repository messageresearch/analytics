[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] Amen. How many say, "I come to give my
[33:17] all to the King of Kings." Amen. Amen.
[33:21] He's the Lord of all glory.
[33:25] He certainly made a way and on our
[33:28] behalf and without him, we wouldn't be
[33:31] nothing. Amen. Don't you believe that
[33:33] this morning? Amen. We wouldn't have
[33:36] nothing to offer. And for what God gave
[33:38] me, I give back to him. He gave me a
[33:40] voice and with that voice I worship the
[33:43] Lord. He gave me hands to praise him. I
[33:46] use them to praise the Lord. And amen to
[33:49] be able to to stand upon the things of
[33:52] God. Amen. I just want to give back to
[33:54] him. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[33:56] Amen. How many can give him a hand clap
[33:58] of praise? Amen. I think it's a good
[34:01] thing to do to let God know that we
[34:04] appreciate him. You know, it's many
[34:06] times anytime you go into any kind of
[34:09] ceremony and they're honoring somebody,
[34:12] well, David, and after they tell about
[34:15] their accolades and what they've done
[34:16] and they invite them up to the stage,
[34:19] you know, they'll the whole entire
[34:21] audience if they've done something
[34:22] pretty good, then they'll they'll give
[34:24] them a hand clap. And if they've done
[34:25] something really good, the people will
[34:27] start standing up and clapping. They
[34:28] call it a standing ovation. And it means
[34:31] a lot that people would have enough to
[34:32] honor you to stand up and clap on on
[34:35] your behalf. And you know, I you know,
[34:37] people say it's kind of funny to clap,
[34:38] but I think we got a right to be able to
[34:40] give God a standing ovation. You know,
[34:42] sometimes we just appreciate what God's
[34:44] done, and we just want to let him know.
[34:47] It ain't to make noise or to build up
[34:50] something or or or to to make some
[34:52] emotion, but I want to let God know how
[34:54] I feel about him. Amen. And so we we
[34:57] take or give our hands and our voice and
[34:59] and all that we have unto him. Amen. You
[35:02] love the Lord this morning. Amen. Sure.
[35:04] Good to see sister Lillian back this
[35:07] morning. And Amen.
[35:14] She she limped her way all the way in
[35:17] here and you couldn't even tell anything
[35:19] was ever wrong with her. Amen. she just
[35:21] just been praying for and you know
[35:24] whenever she first heard her foot they
[35:27] doctors told her she would have to have
[35:29] surgery on it pretty much immediately
[35:31] and and uh and she had gone into the
[35:34] hospital for that purpose and they had
[35:36] done some more x-rays on her the first
[35:38] time they said that's would be happen
[35:40] the next time they said well maybe it
[35:42] could wait till you got home and then
[35:44] she got home they said well I don't
[35:45] think you need surgery at all and so
[35:48] she's kind of been sitting around there
[35:49] just waiting and on the doctor, you
[35:51] know, visit after visit and kept weight
[35:53] off of it. And the Lord just brought her
[35:55] uh back to be able uh to walk and she
[35:58] has but just one desire to serve God and
[36:00] to be able to sit on that piano and
[36:02] worship the Lord. And so I certainly
[36:04] appreciate the gift that God has placed
[36:07] in her life. It's certainly she's been a
[36:09] blessing to us. And so I appreciate the
[36:11] Lord for touching her body. I believe
[36:13] God answers prayer. Amen. I know we have
[36:15] many needs this morning. And just want
[36:18] to ask you remember my uncle has been
[36:22] having some real bad trouble and had
[36:25] shingles and things that has caused some
[36:27] nerve damage and and has asking for
[36:31] prayer and just in in in a real need of
[36:33] prayer and and I believe that we have a
[36:36] right to be able to approach God with
[36:38] it. also remember brother Tom Allen and
[36:42] uh that he's been battling with that and
[36:45] uh around his head and face area and
[36:48] it's been a hard time getting over it.
[36:51] So we just ask the Lord that would touch
[36:53] him as well. And I know how the enemy
[36:56] does just to come and and torment
[36:59] children of God. And but I believe that
[37:01] we have a right to to go before the Lord
[37:03] with it. Amen. that even when the doctor
[37:05] says they don't think it can it can go
[37:07] away or it ain't nothing's working
[37:09] medicine isn't working but I know one
[37:11] that does work even beyond all medicine.
[37:14] Amen. So whenever the doctor's done all
[37:16] that he could do I believe we have a
[37:18] right to call upon the name of the Lord.
[37:19] So also remember uh Aunt Joyce Uncle
[37:22] Randall this morning. So if you have a
[37:24] need on your heart, won't you just lift
[37:25] your hand to the Lord and maybe just ask
[37:28] the Lord to do something special for you
[37:30] this morning? I know that he certainly
[37:32] can.
[37:32] So let's just ask him to come in a
[37:35] special way this morning. Gracious
[37:36] heavenly father, Lord, how we love you,
[37:39] Lord. Lord, as a body of believers,
[37:42] Lord, we come and call upon your name,
[37:45] Lord, knowing that we don't have any
[37:48] rights in our own merit, Lord, or Lord,
[37:52] nothing that we've done to to earn it or
[37:55] anything like that, but Lord, we just
[37:57] rely upon you and your hand of mercy.
[38:00] Lord, we just ask you, Lord, the God
[38:02] that you are, Lord, that you would come
[38:05] this morning, Lord. And God, I pray that
[38:07] you would forgive us of our sins, Lord.
[38:10] The mistakes that we make in this flesh,
[38:12] Lord, and God, we just seem so
[38:14] inadequate, Lord, all the time, Lord, to
[38:16] look at ourselves as failures. And Lord,
[38:19] even myself, Lord, I don't ever feel
[38:22] worthy, Lord, just to even to be able to
[38:24] preach the the word, Lord. But God, I
[38:27] just stand here by your mercy, Lord.
[38:30] God, I ask you, Lord, that you would
[38:31] come, Lord. We just ask that, Lord, as
[38:34] an intercessor, Lord, that you would
[38:36] move upon our brothers and sisters,
[38:38] Lord, that have great needs in their
[38:39] life. Lord, many that need healing,
[38:42] Lord, these brothers, Lord, that we've
[38:43] called out before you, Lord. I pray that
[38:45] you would touch their body, God. I pray
[38:47] that you would give them a perfect
[38:49] healing, Lord. That you would restore
[38:51] them back to health. And Lord, I just
[38:53] thank you, Lord, for all that you've
[38:54] done. Lord, you've never neglected to to
[38:57] help us in a time of trouble, in a time
[38:58] of need. And Lord, we we give you glory
[39:01] for that. Lord, we thank you for it,
[39:03] Lord. God, we just ask this morning,
[39:05] Lord, that you would meet every need.
[39:07] Lord, that you would move in a special
[39:08] way, Lord. Let your word find its
[39:10] resting place in every heart, God, that
[39:12] when we leave this place, we will know
[39:14] that we've left your presence. And Lord,
[39:16] we just ask you now that you would be in
[39:18] our midst. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[39:23] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[39:25] Amen. How many loves the Lord? Amen. How
[39:28] many loves his word? Amen. Amen. I said,
[39:31] how many loves his word? Amen. We
[39:33] certainly love to come and fellowship
[39:35] around the word of God. And looking
[39:37] forward to our meetings coming up, our
[39:39] tent meeting, uh that will be October
[39:42] the 15th through the 19th. And uh
[39:45] brother uh Jonathan Martin, brother
[39:47] Wayne Lawson, and brother David Ser will
[39:51] be here speaking for us. and also
[39:53] brother Andrew uh will uh take the
[39:56] meeting as well. So we just want to use
[39:59] this as an outreach as a way to be able
[40:02] uh to spread the gospel and so we want
[40:04] to allow everybody I know one sister had
[40:07] asked about putting some uh invitations
[40:09] and things out and uh that's perfectly
[40:12] uh okay and it's a good thing as long as
[40:14] they will allow a flyer or something
[40:16] like that. Uh you're welcome to put
[40:18] things out. So uh don't be putting it on
[40:21] things where people don't want it but uh
[40:23] wherever they'll allow us to put it then
[40:25] we want to make invitation uh so that
[40:27] all could come that would like to come
[40:29] and be a part and I'm just trusting the
[40:31] Lord to do great things. Amen. Every
[40:33] meeting that we've had many seen the
[40:35] hand of God in those tent meetings. So
[40:37] we we've certainly see God seen God do
[40:39] the miraculous and so we just that's why
[40:42] we put it on and and labor for it. So
[40:45] we're just looking forward to that. Uh
[40:47] but I want to invite you this morning to
[40:49] the scripture. We're going to pick up in
[40:50] Hebrews the 6th chapter. And uh last
[40:53] Sunday I had uh uh started in this uh
[40:57] direction and had spoke of of making uh
[41:01] a study in this direction. And so uh we
[41:04] want to just uh continue in that. And so
[41:07] I want to read out of uh out of the book
[41:11] of uh Hebrews the sixth chapter. And
[41:14] then we'll read we'll start in the 13th
[41:17] verse and then read down to the 20th
[41:19] verse. So Hebrews 6 and13
[41:24] and the Bible says for when God had made
[41:26] promise to Abraham because he could
[41:28] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[41:31] saying surely blessing I will bless thee
[41:34] and multiplying I will multiply thee.
[41:36] And so after that he had patiently
[41:38] endured he obtained the promise. For men
[41:41] verilely uh swear by the greater, and an
[41:44] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[41:47] of all strife, wherein God willing more
[41:50] abundantly to show unto the heirs of his
[41:53] promise the immutability of his counsel,
[41:56] confirmed it by an oath, that by two
[41:59] immutable things in which it was
[42:01] impossible for God to lie, that we might
[42:03] have a strong consolation, who have fled
[42:06] for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope
[42:09] that is set before for us which hope we
[42:12] have as an anchor of the soul both sure
[42:16] and steadfast and which enterth into
[42:19] that within the veil whether the
[42:21] forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[42:24] made an high priest forever after the
[42:27] order of Melchazdc and we'll just ask
[42:29] the Lord uh to add his blessing to the
[42:32] reading of the word this morning so if
[42:34] you want to take your seats and uh I
[42:37] would like to take this uh scripture
[42:38] this morning we had started
[42:40] uh in this uh uh direction last week and
[42:43] we had taken uh uh and and uh read the
[42:47] same scripture and we had spoken on uh
[42:49] the subject of the immutability of God's
[42:52] oath and how the the promises that God
[42:55] had made to the believers and the
[42:57] importance of the promise and and uh and
[43:00] you know I realize that throughout all
[43:02] the ages there have been many promises
[43:04] that God has made to the church
[43:06] thousands upon thousands of promises
[43:08] that were made by God uh to his
[43:11] children. And and you know, I think uh I
[43:14] think uh that that any one of us can
[43:17] recognize the promises that God has made
[43:20] to us. There's many uh times that God
[43:22] has came and uh and has moved on our
[43:24] behalf and he's made promises. And not
[43:26] only uh does he make promises, but I
[43:29] wonder how many to uh this morning could
[43:31] raise your hand and say that God he
[43:33] keeps his word. Amen. So, uh, not only
[43:35] does he make promise, but he's a keeper
[43:37] of the promises that he makes. So, uh,
[43:40] we certainly know that God is is more
[43:42] than able to keep his word. He always
[43:44] keeps his word. He does, uh, what he
[43:46] says he would do. He's never he's a
[43:49] never failing God. And so, uh, that's
[43:51] why we rely upon God in such a way
[43:53] because not only is God a promise maker,
[43:56] but God is a promisekeeper. I I think
[43:58] Peter said it best. He says, "Through
[44:00] the Lord Jesus, uh, we are given unto us
[44:03] exceeding great and precious promises
[44:05] that by these you might be partakers of
[44:08] the divine nature
[44:10] of God." And he said that we but by the
[44:13] promises of God, we've escaped
[44:14] corruption that came uh by lust. I think
[44:17] you could take that scripture and preach
[44:18] the first couple of chapters of Genesis
[44:21] right out of that of what happened in
[44:22] the beginning that he said uh that we
[44:24] could take the promises of God and
[44:26] escape corruption that came by lust. It
[44:28] kind of tells you the story of where
[44:30] corruption came from. He said, "But uh
[44:32] but God has given us a way to escape
[44:34] that corruption." And and remember last
[44:36] week we was reading this, but his
[44:38] promise to us said that God has promised
[44:40] us by a sworn oath one that he cannot
[44:43] lie. The other he swore an oath on top
[44:45] of that that he will raise up at the
[44:47] last day and give us eternal life.
[44:49] knowing that after we have been called
[44:51] that he said he knew us before the
[44:53] foundation of the world and he and
[44:55] predestinated us under the adoption of
[44:58] children through Jesus Christ. So God
[45:00] has given us a promise in this age. He's
[45:02] given us a promise of everlasting life,
[45:05] a promise of eternal life as a prophet
[45:07] would say uh that he would raise us up
[45:09] in the last day and give us eternal
[45:11] life. And so that's why the believers
[45:13] today that we live in an age of
[45:15] unsettled times. We live in an age where
[45:18] it's unsure uh in the world but still
[45:20] yet though it's unsure to the rest of
[45:22] the world but today we still have that
[45:24] same promised word of God that he gave
[45:27] in the beginning. So the very promises
[45:29] that God made. How many believes that
[45:31] this morning that they're still in
[45:32] effect to the believer and this is what
[45:34] Paul is speaking. Paul said which hope
[45:36] we have as an anchor of the soul. I'd
[45:39] like to speak on that this morning. The
[45:41] anchor of our soul. He said the which
[45:43] hope uh hope we have the anchor of our
[45:45] soul both sure and steadfast. And you
[45:48] know that that it means that that this
[45:50] anchor that God has given us it has a
[45:52] firm determination. It is unshakable. It
[45:55] is something uh that is unwavering. It's
[45:58] something that cannot it cannot be
[45:59] moved. But David, it's something that is
[46:01] that is that is firm. It's it is a it
[46:04] can't be shaken. It can't be moved. It
[46:06] can't be. Uh so if you could establish
[46:08] that this morning that the anchor that
[46:09] God has given us is a steadfast anchor.
[46:11] It's something uh there's nothing that
[46:13] could happen no matter what would happen
[46:14] on the surface nothing uh could happen
[46:17] to change it. In other words, there's
[46:18] something in us that keeps us faithful
[46:21] to the cause of Christ. Isn't that
[46:22] something that it doesn't matter what
[46:24] you face? I I know the Bible tells tells
[46:27] us about many people that something that
[46:29] there was something that happened that
[46:30] had to keep them. They went through
[46:31] great trials. All through the scripture,
[46:33] we read stories of men and women that
[46:36] went through great trials in their life.
[46:38] But there was something in them that was
[46:40] greater than themselves that was able to
[46:42] keep them. It isn't that something. How
[46:44] many knows that through times in your
[46:45] life that there had to be something in
[46:47] you that was greater than you or you
[46:49] wouldn't have ever made it through it.
[46:50] There was something, you know, in time
[46:52] that I would have gave up, but something
[46:53] in me, it would keep me through it.
[46:55] There's times when I I would have quit.
[46:57] I would have thrown up my hands. I would
[46:58] have ran away. I I would have done all
[47:00] kinds of things. But but there is
[47:02] something in us that is greater than
[47:04] oursel. You know, I got to thinking
[47:05] about the Bible and and all the men and
[47:08] women of all the times that that God had
[47:10] has kept people through many great
[47:12] things. Brother Mark, I thought about
[47:13] Samson and how that there was something
[47:15] in Samson that was greater. It wasn't
[47:17] the flesh of the man that made him what
[47:19] he was, but it was something in him that
[47:21] made him that gave him the ability to
[47:23] withstand uh the enemy. It was it was a
[47:26] man like Shamgar that had something in
[47:27] him that whenever the enemy would come
[47:29] to take all that belonged to his family
[47:31] and all and and those that great army
[47:33] that would come to rob what would belong
[47:35] to his children and to his family. But
[47:37] something on the inside of Shamgar was
[47:39] greater than what Shamgar was. And it
[47:42] allowed him to withstand the enemy in
[47:44] his greatest day of persecution and
[47:46] trouble. We could talk about David and
[47:48] we could talk about Jonah when he was in
[47:50] the the belly of a whale and uh we could
[47:52] talk about the widow woman whose whose
[47:54] crews had had failed and and and and she
[47:57] had nothing to eat or be able to feed
[47:59] her children or about the three Hebrew
[48:01] children when they went into a fiery
[48:02] furnace. But many times throughout the
[48:05] Bible, we find this same thing. There
[48:07] had to be something in them that was
[48:09] greater than themselves. Amen. There
[48:11] were there had to be an anchor. There
[48:12] had to be something that was holding
[48:14] them. You know, I was thinking about
[48:15] this this week and thinking about our
[48:17] anchor and and reading about different
[48:19] people in the Bible and and and I came
[48:21] across this story. Of course, it's
[48:23] something that we all read. And you
[48:24] know, I got to thinking about how the
[48:26] story of Daniel in the Bible and how
[48:28] that Daniel was a man that God used and
[48:31] he was a man that was close to God. He
[48:33] he worshiped God. He was a prophet. He
[48:35] was a he was a man of God. But uh but
[48:38] but the enemy would do anything that he
[48:40] could to destroy him. I mean, you know,
[48:41] although he may not had great strength
[48:43] in his flesh, he he didn't have no uh
[48:46] super ability in his flesh, he wasn't a
[48:48] superman or something like that, but he
[48:50] was just a man that was anointed of God
[48:53] to be to be in the office, to be in the
[48:55] line of duty that he was in. And but but
[48:57] the Bible would tell us that there was
[48:59] an enemy that wanted to destroy the life
[49:01] of Daniel. You remember Daniel? Can I
[49:02] just can I just tell it this morning?
[49:04] You you remember Daniel was a man that
[49:06] was a a great man even uh in the eyes of
[49:09] the king of Babylon when they had came
[49:11] in and taken over and this great king
[49:12] Darius and and they had saw Daniel.
[49:15] Daniel was an exile prophet. Remember
[49:17] there was uh whenever the Assyrian had
[49:19] taken over Israel and then Babylon took
[49:21] over Assyria and now they ruled over
[49:23] this whole uh uh land what which used to
[49:26] be Judah and these and so in their
[49:28] ruling over they had taken these and and
[49:30] brought them into captivity. Daniel was
[49:32] just a young boy, a young man whenever
[49:34] they brought him into captivity, he
[49:35] lived out his life in exile, he was
[49:37] known as one of the prophets of exile.
[49:39] And so, uh, even when the Israel would
[49:41] go back into the land of Israel to
[49:43] rebuild Jerusalem, Daniel never went. He
[49:45] stayed behind and he lay mened and he
[49:47] prayed for him. Remember down at the
[49:48] Tigress River that day praying for the
[49:50] people of Israel that God would be able
[49:52] to help him to be restored. So, he was
[49:54] always, even from his birth, I believe
[49:56] that a calling that a man has, it comes
[49:58] uh before he's ever born. it it wasn't
[50:01] something that he earned or worked into,
[50:02] but that's just what he was. He was a
[50:04] prophet of God. And so, uh, whether he
[50:06] was in exile or whether he was in
[50:08] captivity, whether he's in a jail cell,
[50:10] whether he's having a good day or a bad
[50:12] day, when a man is called of God, he's
[50:14] just called of God. So, uh, when he's in
[50:16] the wrong or was in when he's in the
[50:18] right, gifts and callings come without
[50:20] repentance. He he was called of God to
[50:22] be in this place. He was a great man of
[50:24] God that God would use. And so, we find
[50:26] Daniel in in this kingdom and how that
[50:29] he was built up.
[50:30] And the king saw uh the gift that was in
[50:32] his life. And because of that gift, he
[50:34] had elevated him to a man of great
[50:36] stature. He was a leader, a president
[50:38] over over uh the other rulers of his
[50:41] kingdom. And and the Bible would tell us
[50:43] that they the men there, they would get
[50:45] such jealous against Daniel. And because
[50:47] God was using him in the way that he was
[50:49] using him and they had such a jealousy
[50:51] and and the Bible says and they watched
[50:53] his life closely to find something that
[50:56] was wrong with him. And so, and the
[50:57] Bible said after they looked at his life
[50:59] and looked at everything that he done
[51:00] and they followed him around and they
[51:02] investigated everything that he done and
[51:04] the only thing they could find wrong
[51:06] with him is that he kept the word of
[51:08] God. That that's the only fault they
[51:09] could find in him. He just was so
[51:11] dedicated to keeping the law of God.
[51:13] They said, "This is the way we can get
[51:14] to him." You remember the story? They
[51:16] So, they went to the king and said, "Oh,
[51:17] king, you're the greatest king that
[51:19] there ever was. There ain't never been
[51:20] nobody like you. Why? Why? There ought
[51:22] to be statues of you. People ought to
[51:24] honor you. They my they're they should
[51:27] worship you. My king, you're so
[51:28] wonderful. And we've talked to all the
[51:30] men of the kingdom and every one of them
[51:32] agree you're the greatest that there
[51:33] ever was. So why don't you make a decree
[51:35] to honor yourself? You know, king, you
[51:37] never honor yourself, but maybe you
[51:39] could just take a month and and just say
[51:41] for the next 30 days that nobody could
[51:43] bow to any god or to any king other than
[51:46] you and make a decree so that we can
[51:48] honor you and make a make a time like
[51:50] this. I thought, isn't it something to
[51:51] hear that that that these men would come
[51:53] and say that that that nobody would
[51:55] bring a petition to any god or to any
[51:58] king? Isn't it something the way they
[51:59] laid that out? In other words, they want
[52:01] to make sure there was no power on earth
[52:03] or no power in heaven that was as great
[52:05] as this king. This is what they're
[52:07] trying to establish that there's no
[52:08] earthly power as great as you. There's
[52:10] no heavenly power as great as you. And
[52:12] and king, establish a decree and sign it
[52:15] in writing and and make it by the law.
[52:16] remember the law of the Mes and Persians
[52:18] that it cannot be changed. They they
[52:20] wanted they went back to that old law.
[52:22] Remember the Mes and Persians and how uh
[52:24] that brother Mark they were they were
[52:26] the one that took over many different
[52:28] types of cultures, people of different
[52:29] languages. So their law was in such a
[52:32] way that the law could not be changed
[52:34] and they done that to bring stability
[52:36] amongst diverse regions. So one uh that
[52:38] was not like the others or their culture
[52:41] was different than the others. So when
[52:42] they would make a law, it would go
[52:44] throughout all of their land and it
[52:45] could not be changed. So this stability,
[52:48] it's actually what most of the legal
[52:49] systems today is based upon. Any stable
[52:52] culture or stable legal system is based
[52:55] upon something that is established.
[52:56] That's why whenever we started our
[52:58] country, they they had the declaration
[53:00] of independence. That's why they made a
[53:02] constitution. It was something or a
[53:04] declaration that was established that
[53:06] was firm that could not be changed. It
[53:07] was it's something that you could build
[53:09] upon. People could have confidence in.
[53:11] And so so they they took the king back
[53:13] to this kind of a law and said make it a
[53:15] law that can't be changed. And so the
[53:17] king says you know certainly he would do
[53:19] that thing and so it couldn't be
[53:20] altered. And you know but the Bible says
[53:22] that that when they made the decree they
[53:24] only had one purpose. They were trying
[53:26] to catch Daniel. But when they made the
[53:27] decree Daniel being the kind of a man
[53:30] that he was the Bible says he knew that
[53:32] the law was there but he couldn't stop
[53:35] obeying God. He couldn't stop worshiping
[53:37] God. He knew he knew what they would do.
[53:39] So the Bible says, "But he went home
[53:41] knowing and with his windows open three
[53:43] times a day, he prayed to God just like
[53:46] he did before." And let me tell you a
[53:47] secret. Daniel did not do it for spite.
[53:50] He didn't do it to show them men. He
[53:52] didn't do it to prove he was better. He
[53:54] didn't do it uh to try to establish
[53:56] himself as something uh in in in God or
[53:59] anything like that. The Bible says he
[54:00] done it like he did before. So he just
[54:03] done it because that's what Daniel was.
[54:05] He was a man that was a worshshiper of
[54:07] God. He was a man that that was a a
[54:09] servant of the living God. So says he
[54:11] went down and he done it in the you know
[54:13] Daniel knew what it what what it would
[54:15] do. He he he he knew what what would
[54:17] happen if he went 30 days without
[54:19] prayer. You realize what the devil was
[54:21] trying to do. Let's make sure they don't
[54:22] pray that they don't they don't pray to
[54:24] know God and they don't pray to no king.
[54:26] I want to take the power that the the
[54:27] the that spiritual power that heavenly
[54:30] power out of their life. I want to break
[54:32] the communication between them and God.
[54:34] I thought isn't the devil try to do that
[54:35] same thing today? It may not be a
[54:37] decree, but I promise he's done
[54:39] everything he can could to keep you from
[54:41] talking to God. If he can get you out
[54:42] for 30 days, he'll do it for 30 days. If
[54:44] he can get you out of it for a week,
[54:46] he'll do it for a week. If he can get
[54:48] you to go a day, he'll do it for a day
[54:50] because he knows what happens when you
[54:51] don't have communication between you and
[54:54] God. But Daniel knew this. He knew what
[54:56] would happen if he spent 30 days without
[54:58] talking to his God. He knew what would
[55:00] happen if he spent a month without
[55:01] having communication and having having
[55:04] time with the Lord. So the Bible said
[55:06] three times a day Daniel he bapt on his
[55:09] knees and he prayed unto God. He was
[55:10] going to maintain his relationship with
[55:12] God. And you know what the Bible said?
[55:14] Whenever they saw him there, brother
[55:16] Mark, they saw him. They they saw him
[55:18] bowing. They saw him kneeling before
[55:20] God. They went back with a smile on
[55:21] their face. They brought their witnesses
[55:23] to catch him in the act. They went back
[55:25] to the king and said, "Oh king, have you
[55:27] not made a decree that no man would bow
[55:29] down to any god or to any king?" And oh
[55:31] king said, "Yeah, I made it. Oh king,
[55:33] didn't you not say that they wouldn't
[55:35] have a uh that by the laws of the Mes
[55:37] and Persians that it cannot be changed?
[55:39] He said, "Yeah, I said it." He said,
[55:40] "Well, oh, that Daniel down there, we
[55:42] just caught him, king. He don't honor
[55:44] you. You've done all this for him and he
[55:47] don't even appreciate you. He wouldn't
[55:48] even dedicate 30 days because he don't
[55:51] honor you. He's not doing what he should
[55:53] do. He's tanning against the the oath of
[55:55] the king." king. And the Bible said it
[55:56] bothered King Darius because he thought
[55:58] highly of Daniel, but he could not
[56:01] disobey the law. And the law said if a
[56:04] man would bow, that he must be thrown in
[56:06] a den of lions. And brother Mark, he
[56:07] would receive his his death sentence. I
[56:09] thought, isn't it something that after
[56:11] all of this, they brought the evidence
[56:13] before the king and convicted Daniel and
[56:16] sentenced him to death just for being a
[56:19] Christian man. Got to say it like that.
[56:21] And just for being a man of God, he was
[56:23] convicted. He was brought. He was
[56:25] sentenced to death. Can you can you
[56:27] imagine being sentenced to death for
[56:29] praying to God? You say, "What did he do
[56:31] wrong?" He prayed to God and he was
[56:32] sentenced to death just for praying to
[56:34] God. I think that's the way it ought to
[56:35] be. I think our life ought to manifest
[56:38] what we are. Daniel wasn't out there in
[56:40] public trying to make some statement and
[56:42] and trying to cause trouble in the
[56:44] public. He wasn't doing that. He was
[56:45] just down there living his life. He was
[56:47] serving God the way he ought to serve
[56:49] God. He was praying the way he ought to
[56:51] pray. But his life manifested what he
[56:54] was. I think that's the way it ought to
[56:56] be. I think being a believer ought to be
[56:58] evident to the world today. I believe I
[57:00] think what we believe, you know, we call
[57:01] ourselves Christians. How many knows
[57:03] what it means to be a Christian? I mean,
[57:05] a Christian means to be Christlike.
[57:07] Remember what brother said. He said he
[57:08] matter of fact, he made a call to the
[57:10] believers to to pledge to God. This was
[57:13] a in in the message things that ought to
[57:15] be I think it ought to be called the
[57:16] Christian's pledge. But he makes a call.
[57:18] He said, "From this night on, oh lamb of
[57:21] God, I promise to walk upright. I'll
[57:23] walk in honor of the name that I'm
[57:26] called a Christian, a Christlike life.
[57:28] I'll raise my hands. I'll dedicate
[57:30] myself a new to you tonight, and I will
[57:33] walk in the light." I wonder how many
[57:35] can make that same pledge today. I
[57:37] wonder how many could lift your hand and
[57:38] say, "Lord, from this night on, oh lamb
[57:40] of God, I promise to walk upright, and I
[57:43] want to walk in honor of the name that I
[57:46] am called, a Christian, a Christlike
[57:48] life." I think that ought to be the
[57:50] desire of every Christian's heart,
[57:52] brother Mah, that I could walk in honor
[57:54] of the name that I'm called. I don't
[57:55] believe that we ought to be a mockery to
[57:57] Christianity. I don't believe that
[57:59] people ought to look at our life and
[58:00] think, "If that's what a Christian is, I
[58:02] certainly don't want to be one of them."
[58:03] I think our life ought to be such a
[58:05] Christian lie that when people look at
[58:07] your life that you're guilty of being a
[58:09] Christian. I think that ought to be our
[58:11] thing. You know, you I may as well I may
[58:12] as well just preach it. I We're on a
[58:14] Sunday morning and but but but I but I
[58:16] think that that's the way it ought to
[58:18] be. Brother Mark, you know, there's
[58:19] things in our life that identify what a
[58:21] Christian is. I believe it ought to be
[58:23] evident that you're a Christian. I don't
[58:25] think it ought to be a secret. you know,
[58:27] you know, uh I I'll get in trouble for
[58:29] telling this, but I I had a friend one
[58:31] time and and and uh and you know, we
[58:33] done some business uh uh deals together
[58:35] and one of his buddies one one time came
[58:37] down and I met him and I said, "Yeah,
[58:39] that we had mutual friend and and I
[58:41] said, "Well, yeah, you know, your buddy
[58:43] here." I said, "We've been working with
[58:44] him and and I said, "Man, it's pretty
[58:46] good." I said, "Yeah." And he he told me
[58:48] he's a pastor and and and all this. And
[58:50] he said, "It's wonderful." He goes, "A
[58:52] pastor?" He said, "He ain't no pastor?"
[58:54] I said, "Well, yeah, he's a pastor. He's
[58:55] got a church. He said, "He ain't no
[58:57] pastor. I've known him forever." But he
[58:59] was a pastor. I thought, "Well, wonder
[59:00] what kind of life you have to live in
[59:02] front of your friends for your friend
[59:04] not even to know that you was a a pastor
[59:06] or not even to know you. I I can't help
[59:08] but I can't help but live a life. You
[59:10] you brother Mark, if people don't know
[59:11] you're a Christian, there's something
[59:12] wrong with your Christian walk. If
[59:15] people It don't take long for a person
[59:17] to stand I may as well can I just can I
[59:19] just be honest with you this morning? It
[59:21] don't take long for somebody to stand
[59:22] around me. Sometimes I offend them uh
[59:24] when they go to cussing and using the
[59:26] Lord's name in vain and and all this and
[59:28] it don't take me very long to say, "Hey,
[59:30] sir, do you mind, you know, I got
[59:32] children present. There's a because
[59:34] there's something in my life and and it
[59:36] don't take long or maybe the best thing
[59:37] to do, brother David, you sit around
[59:39] somebody and they get the talking dirty,
[59:40] you know, I I've learned the best thing
[59:42] to do without causing a bunch of
[59:43] controversy, I just kind of change the
[59:45] subject and say, "Well, sir, where do
[59:47] you guys go to church at?" and oh uh uh
[59:49] well I you know I don't uh you know we
[59:51] you know well we we're a member of a
[59:53] soul place you know I said well that's
[59:54] good you we go down to Grace Tabernacle
[59:56] man we sure love to love the Lord down
[59:58] there and my it just love to worship God
[1:00:00] I bet you love to worship the Lord it
[1:00:02] don't take long a guy's cussing he'll
[1:00:03] either stop cussing or he'll just go on
[1:00:05] somewhere else see because you want to
[1:00:07] you want to live a life in front of them
[1:00:09] that all that isn't welcome in you you
[1:00:11] know you don't just have to allow that
[1:00:12] in your life you don't just have to sit
[1:00:14] in the presence of people drinking beer
[1:00:16] and smoking and and cussing and telling
[1:00:18] dirty jokes. You don't you don't have to
[1:00:20] just sit in that and allow that that to
[1:00:22] go on. You say, "Well, what?" You just
[1:00:24] start telling some testimonies. And you
[1:00:25] know, let me tell y'all something that
[1:00:26] the Lord done for me the other day. You
[1:00:28] don't have to be mean, but but you can
[1:00:30] just manifest the life of a believer, a
[1:00:32] Christian, and it changes the atmosphere
[1:00:35] of everything around you. Yeah. I
[1:00:37] believe that there's things in our life
[1:00:38] that are to manifest what we are. How
[1:00:40] many believe that? I believe it ought to
[1:00:42] be evident that we're a Christian. The
[1:00:43] Bible The Bible tells us the what a
[1:00:45] Christian is. It came it came you know
[1:00:47] all the way back in Apostle Paul acts
[1:00:49] the 11th chapter it whenever uh Paul and
[1:00:52] Barnabas can I just take a minute on
[1:00:54] this I I just feel to so Paul and
[1:00:56] Barnabas they went into Antioch and they
[1:00:58] got to preaching the Bible says whenever
[1:00:59] Paul came they spent a whole year among
[1:01:02] them people preaching to them of what g
[1:01:04] of who Jesus Christ was. He spent he
[1:01:06] labored there for a year teaching the
[1:01:08] foundation of the church and teaching
[1:01:10] the purpose of Christ and and he went
[1:01:13] through the whole Bible. I can imagine
[1:01:14] sitting under Paul for a year. Wouldn't
[1:01:16] that have been a great year to sit under
[1:01:17] the ministry of Apostle Paul? But but he
[1:01:20] taught him how that we were that where
[1:01:22] we came from and that we were lost in
[1:01:24] the fall of the garden and we needed a
[1:01:25] redeemer and there was a death that a
[1:01:28] penalty that had came upon our life uh
[1:01:31] because of sin and because uh because of
[1:01:34] the failures of man. And so he showed us
[1:01:36] how that how that Jesus began to pay the
[1:01:39] or he paid the penalty for man's sins
[1:01:41] and showed them that there was a way out
[1:01:42] of out of this life and and you know and
[1:01:45] Paul preached there for a year but you
[1:01:46] know the more I thought about it I
[1:01:48] thought you know that wasn't actually
[1:01:49] Paul's message at all that was God's
[1:01:51] message he just used Paul to preach it
[1:01:53] and so Paul labored there for a year and
[1:01:55] the Bible says while Paul labored there
[1:01:57] that's whenever the term Christian first
[1:01:59] came out so in other words there was
[1:02:01] people that got under the ministry of
[1:02:03] Apostle Paul and and They got to hearing
[1:02:05] of this life of Christ and what it meant
[1:02:08] to be a a follower of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:10] to be baptized in his name. And the
[1:02:12] Bible said and there they became
[1:02:14] Christians. I I thought I wonder who
[1:02:16] came up with the name first. Was it
[1:02:17] those that was in the church or was it
[1:02:19] those that were making fun of them on
[1:02:20] the outside? I don't know who said it
[1:02:22] first, but somebody looked at them and
[1:02:23] said, "That's just a bunch of Christians
[1:02:25] over there. They they're following after
[1:02:26] the life of this Jesus Christ. They've
[1:02:28] been listening to the teachings of this
[1:02:30] Apostle Paul." I thought, you know, it
[1:02:32] how wonderful it was that that Paul
[1:02:34] didn't have the evidence of Jesus
[1:02:36] raising from the dead. He didn't have a
[1:02:38] video of it. He didn't have no audio
[1:02:40] recording of it. He didn't have no way
[1:02:42] to say it, but the power and the
[1:02:43] demonstration of the Holy Ghost. He went
[1:02:45] and he preached to him. Brother Bam said
[1:02:47] he was anointed by the same Holy Ghost
[1:02:49] that came down in the upper room. He
[1:02:51] didn't just preach by words or the
[1:02:52] enticing word of man's wisdom, but it
[1:02:54] was in power and demonstration. And he
[1:02:57] spent a year preaching to them until
[1:02:59] people became Christians. They became
[1:03:01] followers of Jesus Christ. Their lives
[1:03:04] changed. The things that they used to
[1:03:06] be. I thought, can you imagine the
[1:03:07] transformation that took place in
[1:03:09] Antioch in that year's time of people's
[1:03:11] life of what they used to be and the
[1:03:13] things they used to like to do, but
[1:03:15] under the ministry of Apostle Paul, the
[1:03:17] Bible said they became Christians
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; and it became evident in their life that
[1:03:21] they were Christians. And you know he he
[1:03:23] would tell them he he would tell them as
[1:03:25] he would minister to them that they they
[1:03:27] would be a Christian. Paul said you be a
[1:03:28] follower of me even as I am a follower
[1:03:31] of Christ. In other words, pattern after
[1:03:33] me as I pattern after Christ. Remember
[1:03:35] this is what this is what his message
[1:03:36] was. Remember what I've told you. Read
[1:03:38] the letters that I've wrote to the
[1:03:40] churches. Keep the teachings that came
[1:03:42] from Jesus. Pray and read the read what
[1:03:45] I've wrote. If an angel from heaven
[1:03:47] would come and preach to you anything
[1:03:48] different, let him be a curse because
[1:03:50] this is a word from the Lord.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; You see, that didn't just end with
[1:03:54] Apostle Paul and the early church in
[1:03:56] Antioch, but that's the same thing
[1:03:58] today. But Abraham said, "Children, get
[1:03:59] back to your God." He said, "Don't
[1:04:01] tangle with the world for anything. Stay
[1:04:03] out of this modern world. Stay out of
[1:04:05] modern theologies. Just look to the lamb
[1:04:07] of God. Read your Bible and pray all the
[1:04:10] time. Don't be weary, but be rejoicing.
[1:04:13] Be happy. for the redemption of the
[1:04:15] church is drawing nigh. See, the same
[1:04:17] call that Paul made is the same call
[1:04:19] that's been made in this hour. That we
[1:04:21] ought to have a set aart life. We we
[1:04:24] ought to uh live a life that's different
[1:04:26] from the world. See, because we're
[1:04:28] Christians, we we don't live like the
[1:04:29] world. We go to we go to church. We
[1:04:32] worship God. Because we're a Christian,
[1:04:34] that's why we go to church. Because
[1:04:36] because we're Christian, that's why
[1:04:37] that's why we worship God. Because we're
[1:04:39] a Christian, that's why we raise our
[1:04:41] hands and praise God. Because we're a
[1:04:43] Christian, it ain't something we're
[1:04:44] trying to work up or or we're not trying
[1:04:46] to be somebody, but because I'm a
[1:04:48] Christian, I say amen to the word of
[1:04:50] God. Because I'm a Christian, I I dress
[1:04:53] the way in a modest way that wouldn't
[1:04:56] bring any attention to oursel. Because
[1:04:58] I'm a Christian, I I sacrifice my flesh
[1:05:00] that that God would be able to use me.
[1:05:03] Because we're Christians, we do the
[1:05:04] things that a Christian ought to do.
[1:05:06] Because we're Christians, brother Mark,
[1:05:08] we pray. That's why Daniel prayed.
[1:05:10] Because we're Christians, we read our
[1:05:12] Bible. You realize that's what Dwight
[1:05:14] Moody said one time. A great man of God.
[1:05:16] He said, "Out of a hundred men, only one
[1:05:18] of those men will read their Bible." He
[1:05:20] said, "The other 99's going to read that
[1:05:22] man. One of them will read their Bible.
[1:05:25] 99 of them is going to read the
[1:05:26] Christian that reads his Bible." In
[1:05:27] other words, you're the only thing that
[1:05:29] they will ever read. That's why Paul
[1:05:31] said, "You are a written epistle read
[1:05:33] and known of all men."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; We're written epistles read and known of
[1:05:38] all men. It ought to be evident. You you
[1:05:39] ever notice what Paul was talking about
[1:05:41] when he said, "We are written epistles."
[1:05:43] He was actually speaking of his ministry
[1:05:45] here that Paul would go into the church
[1:05:47] and begin to speak to the church in
[1:05:49] Corinthians. He said, "Do we begin again
[1:05:51] to commend oursel or do we need some
[1:05:53] other epistle of commenation to you or a
[1:05:55] letter of commenation from you?" In
[1:05:57] other words, this is what Paul said. Do
[1:05:59] we need a letter of approval in order
[1:06:03] for my ministry uh to be to be you to be
[1:06:07] able to accept it? Does it have to have
[1:06:08] a letter of approval? See, Paul was a
[1:06:10] man that knew what it was like to be
[1:06:12] high up in the Roman government. And he
[1:06:14] he he knew uh that when a man would come
[1:06:16] into an office in order to be uh to be
[1:06:19] into an office or or or to be selected
[1:06:21] for an office, that man had to have
[1:06:23] letter of approval from all of his
[1:06:25] previous officers and the the previous
[1:06:27] work that he had done. So here Paul
[1:06:29] knowing that that it would require a
[1:06:30] letter of of approval. He would say to
[1:06:32] the church, "Do I need a letter of
[1:06:34] approval in order for the ministry to be
[1:06:37] able to be accepted? Is there is there a
[1:06:39] letter that we need?" He said, "But you
[1:06:41] are our epistle." In other words, you
[1:06:44] are the letter that is written in our
[1:06:46] hearts, known and read of all men. In
[1:06:48] other words, brother Mark, he said that
[1:06:50] when God sent a message to the early
[1:06:52] church, the only letter of approval that
[1:06:54] that message needed, Paul said, was the
[1:06:57] lives of those that the message was
[1:06:59] manifested in. So if God, that's the
[1:07:01] same thing that it is today. If God is
[1:07:03] going to send a message to the church
[1:07:05] today, everybody's looking for a letter
[1:07:07] of approval. Well, give me some kind of
[1:07:08] proof that I ought to believe that
[1:07:10] message and give me some kind of proof
[1:07:11] that that came from God or give me some
[1:07:14] kind of approval that it ought to be
[1:07:15] read or or preached in our churches. But
[1:07:17] here what Paul said. He said, "The
[1:07:19] letter of commenation is just that you
[1:07:22] live it. That the letter of approval
[1:07:23] that I have is the life that you live.
[1:07:25] that my ministry has taken an effect on
[1:07:28] your life and you've became something
[1:07:29] different. I thought, isn't that the
[1:07:31] same letter that we have today when God
[1:07:33] would send a message in this hour that
[1:07:35] the real letter of commenation of the
[1:07:38] message of the hour is those that are
[1:07:40] living it. The letter of approval is the
[1:07:42] lives that we live and the effect that
[1:07:44] it's had on our lives. Whenever he
[1:07:46] called us out of sin and establish as
[1:07:49] moral
[1:07:50] good believers and Christians and
[1:07:52] morally right men and women, it's
[1:07:54] something that calls us to be right with
[1:07:56] God. That's the only letter of approval
[1:07:58] that it needs. That's the real draw
[1:08:00] today. Brother Mark, you live your life
[1:08:02] is advertising to the world of what a
[1:08:04] real Christian is. You realize that's
[1:08:06] what the draw is to the church. It's
[1:08:08] your life. That's what would deter
[1:08:10] people from the church. It's your life.
[1:08:12] It's it's a draw. That's why that's why
[1:08:14] I challenge our public life to be
[1:08:16] something that would be presentable to
[1:08:18] God. That's why we we're careful what we
[1:08:20] say in public and careful what we write
[1:08:22] and careful how we act and because we
[1:08:24] are presenting ourselves in public of
[1:08:26] what a Christian really is. So when
[1:08:28] people would look at that, they would
[1:08:30] say, "Is that the nature of Christ?" No
[1:08:32] wonder people would run from you if you
[1:08:34] ain't displaying the nature. I know
[1:08:35] people don't like this kind of
[1:08:36] preaching, but if the Lord's going to go
[1:08:37] this way, I'm just going to follow the
[1:08:39] Lord. I've learned that a long time ago.
[1:08:41] If you're going to live a life and call
[1:08:42] yourself a Christian, your life ought to
[1:08:44] manifest what a Christian is. People
[1:08:46] ought to be able to look at you and if
[1:08:47] there's a desire in their heart to serve
[1:08:49] God, they ought to look at you just like
[1:08:50] they did Paul and say, "Let me follow
[1:08:52] after you just like you follow after
[1:08:54] Christ." May there be something in my
[1:08:56] life. I pray that's my prayer this
[1:08:58] morning. Lord, may there be something in
[1:09:00] my life that would cause somebody to
[1:09:02] desire the life that I have.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody that would have a desire in
[1:09:06] their heart to serve God. said, "That's
[1:09:09] the real draw today, that we're
[1:09:11] advertising what a real Christian is.
[1:09:13] That's why we guard ourselves and we
[1:09:15] don't let the devil in. That's why we
[1:09:17] keep a check on one another because
[1:09:18] sometimes we get in the flesh and do
[1:09:19] silly things."
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a moment to chew
[1:09:23] that on up a little bit.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get in the flesh and we do
[1:09:26] things we shouldn't do. We say things we
[1:09:28] shouldn't say. We act out in ways we
[1:09:30] shouldn't act out because sometimes we
[1:09:31] get in the flesh. But I thank God that
[1:09:33] we have people in our life that can
[1:09:35] remind us that we're in the flesh. That
[1:09:37] we can turn not to be mean or poke, but
[1:09:39] but to remind us we're Christians. We
[1:09:41] conduct ourselves as Christians. That,
[1:09:43] you know, sometimes we we got to be
[1:09:44] reminded to turn back. This is what Paul
[1:09:46] said. He says, "As much as you are
[1:09:48] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[1:09:50] Christ, ministered by us, written not
[1:09:52] with ink, but with the spirit of the
[1:09:54] living God."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Not in the tables of stone, but in the
[1:09:58] fleshy tables of our heart. Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; So this great letter of Christ, Brother
[1:10:03] Wesley, has been written into your heart
[1:10:05] by the spirit of the living God. It's
[1:10:08] been written. This message that we've
[1:10:10] heard, Brother Mark, it's been written
[1:10:11] into our hearts. We have become the
[1:10:14] letter of commenation
[1:10:16] of the very message of the hour because
[1:10:18] we live it. It's become the letter that
[1:10:21] people read. They're they're not going
[1:10:22] to sit down and read. They're not going
[1:10:24] to sit down and listen to messages like
[1:10:27] you sit down and listen to. They're not
[1:10:28] going to sit down and turn on a tape
[1:10:30] when they get home like you do. What
[1:10:31] they're going to read is you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; What is it about this message? What is
[1:10:35] it about these people today? What is it
[1:10:37] about this church in Leodysia that God
[1:10:38] has raised up? Well, I don't know. Just
[1:10:40] tune in to their Facebook and see what
[1:10:42] they are. Just tune in to their life and
[1:10:44] see what they look like. Just follow
[1:10:45] them around in public and we'll find out
[1:10:47] what it is. That's how people see this
[1:10:49] message.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; That's how people see what Christianity
[1:10:52] is today.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; They follow you that claim it around and
[1:10:56] see what it is. You're the letter.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; You're the message that they hear.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You're the letter that they read.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Said, "But this letter of Christ has
[1:11:04] been written into your heart
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of the living God."
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes I think we ought to
[1:11:10] ask the world of Christians or the or or
[1:11:13] the the Oh, God help me. But you know
[1:11:15] the there's a lot of so-called Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost fil believers that if you could
[1:11:19] follow them around a little bit, you'd
[1:11:20] wonder. We ought to just ask them if it
[1:11:22] was against the law to be a Holy Ghost
[1:11:24] fil believer. If there was a decree that
[1:11:26] went out in the United States against
[1:11:27] Holy Ghost filled believers, I wonder
[1:11:29] how many people would have enough
[1:11:30] evidence in their life to be arrested
[1:11:32] and convicted of it. I wonder if they
[1:11:34] followed him around like Daniel did. I
[1:11:36] know people don't like this kind of
[1:11:37] preaching, but I wonder if they followed
[1:11:39] us around like they did Daniel, would
[1:11:40] there be enough evidence in your life to
[1:11:42] say, "Yep, that's a Christian right
[1:11:43] there. Go ahead and arrest him." Or I
[1:11:45] wonder if our life would display enough
[1:11:47] to say, "Well, he ain't nothing to worry
[1:11:48] about. He ain't breaking no laws." But I
[1:11:50] think that if it was illegal to be a
[1:11:51] Christian and illegal to be a Holy Ghost
[1:11:53] filled believer, I think that when
[1:11:55] somebody saw our life, you ought to
[1:11:56] break every law that they had. Your life
[1:11:58] ought to break the law of of being
[1:12:01] illegal to be a Christian or be a
[1:12:03] believer. I think there ought to be
[1:12:04] enough evidence in our life. I you say,
[1:12:06] "Brother Matt, what's that mean?" I
[1:12:08] wonder, do we display enough attributes
[1:12:10] of Christianity to be classified as a
[1:12:12] Christian?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; We may lose members today.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I hope not. I hope are real Christians.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; But does your life display enough
[1:12:22] attributes
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; to be a real Christian? To be classified
[1:12:25] as a Christian? I know what people say.
[1:12:27] Well, I believe Jesus was a son of God.
[1:12:29] Therefore, I'm a Christian. I believe
[1:12:31] that I got a picture of Jesus hanging on
[1:12:33] my wall, so I'm a Christian. That don't
[1:12:34] mean nothing. Remember remember Ignatius
[1:12:37] who was one of the great founders of the
[1:12:38] the early Catholic Church. His statement
[1:12:41] was anywhere you find Jesus, you find
[1:12:43] the Catholic Church. So, see, if you
[1:12:45] say, "I got a picture of Jesus,
[1:12:46] therefore I'm saved. Well, according to
[1:12:48] the Catholic Church, if you got a
[1:12:49] picture of Jesus, you're Catholic." That
[1:12:51] you're the that's where you'll find the
[1:12:52] Catholic Church, but I but but but
[1:12:54] having a picture of Jesus, it never made
[1:12:56] anybody a Christian.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; It don't that ain't what makes you a
[1:12:59] Christian. Having a picture don't make
[1:13:02] it. Saying I believe Jesus is the son of
[1:13:04] God, that ain't what makes you a
[1:13:05] Christian. But but they would there's
[1:13:06] there's evidence of what it is to be a
[1:13:09] Christian. I know I'm getting long in
[1:13:10] this, but I I just feel to. You know,
[1:13:12] there there there has to be enough
[1:13:14] evidence in our life to say, "I'm a
[1:13:15] follower of Jesus Christ."
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I believe it ought to be evident.
[1:13:19] There's too many people that go around
[1:13:20] misleading people because their life
[1:13:22] don't manifest what they are. And then
[1:13:24] and then people get discouraged and they
[1:13:26] quit church and they backslide and they
[1:13:28] lose out on many years of serving God
[1:13:30] because some hypocrite somewhere is
[1:13:31] claiming to be a a Christian, but they
[1:13:33] don't live the life and they don't
[1:13:34] manifest what a Christian really is. And
[1:13:36] it causes young people to lose
[1:13:38] confidence in serving God and then they
[1:13:40] run from the Lord. all these and all
[1:13:41] these things come up on their life, evil
[1:13:43] things, thing things that they don't get
[1:13:45] over for many, many years
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; because somebody was claiming one thing
[1:13:49] and living another.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; There ought to be evidence in our life
[1:13:52] of what a believer is.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; There ought to be real evidence. You
[1:13:55] say, "Brother May, what kind of evidence
[1:13:57] would there be?" All through the Bible,
[1:13:58] we can find evidence of it. See, I
[1:14:00] wonder if they would find Christ in our
[1:14:02] daily life. Can't be in your Sunday
[1:14:04] life.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's got to be in your daily life.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Christian ain't a Sunday walk. It ain't
[1:14:10] a Wednesday night walk. It's a daily
[1:14:12] walk.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; To be a real Christian, you say, "Well,
[1:14:15] will they find him in my daily life?
[1:14:16] Will they find Christ in my motives?" I
[1:14:19] want to ask you this morning to do a
[1:14:20] little checkup this morning. Do they
[1:14:22] find Christ in my motive? Will they find
[1:14:24] Christ in my actions? Will they find
[1:14:26] Christ in the way that I treat other
[1:14:27] people? You say, "You mean how I treat
[1:14:30] people
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; affects whether or not I'm a Christian?"
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; You mean how I treat people? That's what
[1:14:37] the Bible said. You know, how you treat
[1:14:40] your brothers and sisters is actually
[1:14:42] declaring what is on the inside of you.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Because what on on the outside is
[1:14:47] manifesting what's on the inside. This
[1:14:48] is what this is what the Bible says.
[1:14:50] John said, "Herein is our love made
[1:14:52] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:14:54] day of judgment." Isn't that something?
[1:14:56] That on the day of judgment, we would
[1:14:57] know where we stand.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So, this is what John said that would
[1:15:00] give us that boldness. He said, "Because
[1:15:02] as he is, so are we in this world. We
[1:15:04] love him because he first loved us." If
[1:15:06] a man says, "I love God," but he hateth
[1:15:08] his brother, he is a liar. For he that
[1:15:10] loveth not his brother, whom him has
[1:15:12] seen, how can he love God that he has
[1:15:14] not seen? And this commandment we have
[1:15:16] from him, that he who loveth God love
[1:15:19] his brother also. So here Jesus discerns
[1:15:22] whether we're a disciple or not,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; whether we're a Christian or not. Watch,
[1:15:26] he's dealing with matters of the heart.
[1:15:28] Said, "This is how you know that you're
[1:15:29] my disciple." What' Jesus say? Somebody
[1:15:32] say it. That you would have love one for
[1:15:34] another. says, "See, so we have to
[1:15:36] manifest love." Jesus shows that what is
[1:15:38] on the inside. This is it's what's being
[1:15:40] expressed on the outside. And he
[1:15:42] actually defines this as as the very
[1:15:45] defining characteristic of Christ. He
[1:15:47] said that no greater love hath any man
[1:15:50] than he that would be willing to lay
[1:15:51] down his life for his friends. Isn't
[1:15:53] that what Christ was? If you said, "What
[1:15:55] was Jesus?" He was a man that was
[1:15:56] willing to lay down his life for others.
[1:15:58] said that that is the very defining
[1:16:00] characteristic of what it is to be a
[1:16:02] Christian is a person that is willing to
[1:16:04] lay down their life for others. To love
[1:16:06] somebody so much that you're willing to
[1:16:08] hold back your own thought and your own
[1:16:10] feelings and you're willing to sacrifice
[1:16:12] for somebody else. This is I I mean it's
[1:16:14] the truth this morning. I I know I know
[1:16:16] we don't we don't sometimes we don't
[1:16:17] like this but it's a reality that
[1:16:19] whenever your life that you live is not
[1:16:21] live for yourself but you live a life
[1:16:23] for others. It is a characteristic of
[1:16:25] being a Christian. Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; It's a kind of Christian, think about
[1:16:30] that. He would forsake his own flesh in
[1:16:32] order to fulfill his purpose.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Forsake the desires of his own flesh to
[1:16:37] fulfill his purpose in God. That he
[1:16:39] would crucify the flesh. Said, "That's
[1:16:41] the call for the for the Christian
[1:16:43] today, brother Joe, is to crucify our
[1:16:46] flesh." Isn't that what the Bible said?
[1:16:47] Not to live after the flesh, but to live
[1:16:49] after the spirit. Because the things of
[1:16:51] this flesh, they work against the things
[1:16:53] of God. They're constantly pulling us
[1:16:56] away from the things of God. The
[1:16:57] feelings of this flesh, they work
[1:16:58] against the things of God. But you
[1:17:00] realize, can I just say that this
[1:17:01] morning? That the works of the I'm
[1:17:03] already this deep into it. I may as well
[1:17:04] say it. But the works of the flesh are
[1:17:06] just as evident as the works of the
[1:17:08] spirit.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; The works of the flesh are evident
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; to the world. The works of the spirit,
[1:17:18] they're evident to the world. Paul said,
[1:17:20] "The works of the flesh are manifest,
[1:17:23] which are these: adultery, fornication,
[1:17:25] uncleanness,
[1:17:27] lchivousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
[1:17:29] hatred, variance." You ever read through
[1:17:32] this? Said this is Galatians 5. What it
[1:17:35] is? The works of the flesh. You know
[1:17:36] what it means when Paul says that
[1:17:38] there's variance? It's a work of the
[1:17:40] flesh. Variance means you treat one
[1:17:42] people different than you do another.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. It means you treat
[1:17:48] somebody different than you do another.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to take Lord, you just put
[1:17:52] that where you want it.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Emulations. In other words, that the
[1:17:57] that that we have an effort in our life
[1:17:59] to match or surpass somebody else. We
[1:18:02] got to be better than them. These are
[1:18:04] works of the flesh. He said they're
[1:18:05] evident. Emulation, angry, strife. You
[1:18:09] know what strife mean? It means to be
[1:18:11] bitter over things. Bitter over little
[1:18:13] fundamental things. Something that going
[1:18:15] on going in the church. Instead of
[1:18:17] talking about you just get bitterness,
[1:18:18] it's a work of the flesh. Bitterness
[1:18:20] don't come from God.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's free pastoring this morning.
[1:18:23] Bitterness don't come from God. It come
[1:18:25] from the devil.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; And when you get bitter in your spirit
[1:18:27] where you can't even look at somebody
[1:18:29] and they walk in, you know, I'm not
[1:18:30] going to say nothing to them till they
[1:18:31] say something to me. I'm not I'm just
[1:18:33] going to sit back there and give them
[1:18:34] the cold show. Bitterness did not come
[1:18:35] from God. It come from the devil. And
[1:18:37] you have been anointed by a devil.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; When you have bitterness in your spirit,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; you didn't you weren't anointed by God.
[1:18:44] You were anointed by Satan.
[1:18:46] I'm saying this nicely so you understand
[1:18:48] it. I don't say it out of hatred or
[1:18:50] meanness, but just so that you'll know
[1:18:52] that when you have bitterness in your
[1:18:53] spirit, it didn't come from God. It came
[1:18:55] from the devil. So, there's something in
[1:18:57] our life that has been opened up,
[1:18:59] brother Mark. It's opened up our spirit
[1:19:01] to allow Satan to be able to come into
[1:19:03] our life and to bring bitterness into
[1:19:05] our life that we could uh that we could
[1:19:07] have strife between one another and
[1:19:09] strife between our our brothers. and
[1:19:11] well and now there ain't nothing anybody
[1:19:12] can do that's right because you have
[1:19:14] strife that has been built up in our
[1:19:16] life
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; because of the bitterness that's in our
[1:19:18] life and somebody walk by and greet you
[1:19:20] hey brother God bless you he don't even
[1:19:21] mean that saying God but he's just
[1:19:24] trying to he's just trying to say
[1:19:25] something nice so I won't be mad no more
[1:19:27] isn't that something it's bitterness I
[1:19:30] don't I don't preach like this very
[1:19:31] often but
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; but but it's true I want to see the
[1:19:35] church grow I want to see you being able
[1:19:37] to enjoy the the blessings of God and
[1:19:40] See, see, and if if Satan packs all this
[1:19:42] stuff on your life, you can't be free
[1:19:43] and you can't worship God and you can't
[1:19:45] serve God like you need to. You, but but
[1:19:48] we ought to be able to manifest him. He
[1:19:50] says, see, seditions, in other words,
[1:19:52] you know what? These are the words that
[1:19:54] Paul used. In other words, it's those
[1:19:56] that incite others to rebel against
[1:19:58] authority.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; So, this isn't that just he's going
[1:20:02] right down the list. You get this
[1:20:03] bitterness in you and then before long
[1:20:05] because you got the bitterness or strife
[1:20:07] and now now you're calling others and
[1:20:08] saying, "Well, let me tell you what they
[1:20:10] did." And and the pastor wasn't very
[1:20:12] good anyway, he wouldn't have said that
[1:20:13] or the the preacher, he wouldn't have
[1:20:15] done this. And that deacon after all, I
[1:20:16] mean, if he talked to my kids the way he
[1:20:18] talked to them, I'll tell you what I
[1:20:20] would do with him.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; See? See? So, this is what Paul said.
[1:20:24] It's works of the flesh to incite others
[1:20:26] to rebel against authority.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get some others to feel
[1:20:30] like I feel. said they're works of the
[1:20:32] flesh heresies, beliefs or opinions that
[1:20:35] are contrary to the doctrine. I know
[1:20:36] they may preach that that way and you
[1:20:38] know that that may be the doctrine of
[1:20:40] the church or that may that may be what
[1:20:41] brother said, but you know what? I I
[1:20:43] don't think it's really that way.
[1:20:44] Doctrines that are contrary to the
[1:20:46] doctrine of the church. Envy, murder,
[1:20:48] drunkenness, reings. See, most time when
[1:20:50] we think about sin and works of the
[1:20:52] flesh, we only think about alcohol and
[1:20:54] drugs and adultery and things like that.
[1:20:56] and we put that all off in a bad
[1:20:58] category and then we be whatever we want
[1:21:00] to be as long as we don't touch that
[1:21:01] stuff
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; and then we're still displaying the life
[1:21:04] of Christ. But that ain't that ain't
[1:21:05] that ain't Christlike.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That all these things are work of the
[1:21:08] flesh. They're not Christlike. But see,
[1:21:10] you realize that they're not
[1:21:11] manifesting. They're fruits of the
[1:21:12] flesh, brother Mark. But see, they're
[1:21:14] not the fruit of a of a Christian that's
[1:21:16] a mature Christian. Now, I know as
[1:21:18] believers, that don't mean that we're
[1:21:19] not believers, but we're just
[1:21:20] manifesting the flesh. And we have to
[1:21:22] grow up as believers. Sometimes as
[1:21:23] believers, we grow through those things.
[1:21:25] We need uh uh godly men and women in our
[1:21:27] life to come by and correct us and say,
[1:21:29] you know, you shouldn't say that. You
[1:21:31] oughtn't do that. You know, it that that
[1:21:32] ain't the way. And the correction isn't
[1:21:34] that you just stopped doing it because
[1:21:35] they said the correction is is to you to
[1:21:38] find out why it is that you done it.
[1:21:39] Wonder why what caused me to to be able
[1:21:42] to act out that way. You know, I
[1:21:43] shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't
[1:21:45] have acted that way. I shouldn't have
[1:21:46] said that like that. And and so it
[1:21:48] causes us to reflect upon oursel, which
[1:21:51] is where we really grow in God.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Is when we can reflect upon our own
[1:21:55] actions and our own ways and we can
[1:21:57] really get along with God. So, so
[1:21:59] correction isn't a negative thing. It's
[1:22:00] a good thing because it causes us to
[1:22:03] reflect with God about the way that
[1:22:05] we're living and the way that we're
[1:22:06] acted.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; So then we can reflect with God. And and
[1:22:09] in that time of reflection, God can can
[1:22:11] deal with your spirit and say, "Yeah,
[1:22:13] you know, you really shouldn't have done
[1:22:14] that. Yeah, you really shouldn't have
[1:22:16] said it." And then watch it. Watch what
[1:22:17] happens when you get to that place of
[1:22:19] reflection is the bitterness begins to
[1:22:21] go away. You know, I'm not even mad at
[1:22:23] that brother. I you know, he he he
[1:22:24] should have done that. I I thank God for
[1:22:26] him actually. You know, it's just like a
[1:22:28] child. If you have a child and you
[1:22:30] correct your child and and you know, and
[1:22:31] and they they don't like you correct
[1:22:33] them, but when they get a little bit
[1:22:34] older and then they get married and they
[1:22:36] come back to you and they say, "Dad, I
[1:22:38] appreciate you for staying on me because
[1:22:40] can you imagine where I'd have been if
[1:22:42] you wouldn't have?" And you was right.
[1:22:43] Remember that one time when I I told
[1:22:44] you, "Well, I don't know what you're
[1:22:45] talking about, Dad." Well, you did know
[1:22:47] what you were talking about and you was
[1:22:48] right about that. You know, but but it's
[1:22:50] a time of reflection and it shows
[1:22:52] maturity in a believer that when you can
[1:22:55] reflect upon our own lives and we can
[1:22:57] grow from our own mistakes.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I know this may seem like an elementary
[1:23:01] message, but it's really deep.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Whenever you can reflect on your own
[1:23:04] life that that nobody can make you it's
[1:23:07] what makes a real believer a solid
[1:23:09] believer
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; that you don't just do things because
[1:23:11] because a pastor says you got to do it.
[1:23:13] In a lot of churches, they, you know, it
[1:23:14] just seems like to just force people to
[1:23:16] do things, but well, but that that's not
[1:23:17] what we want to do. I want you to
[1:23:19] reflect on your life, to find out what's
[1:23:21] missing in your life that you can grow.
[1:23:22] Find out the fruits that you're supposed
[1:23:24] to be manifesting. Can I tell you what
[1:23:26] they are? Paul said, "But this is the
[1:23:27] fruit of the spirit. The fruit of the
[1:23:29] spirit is love. It's joy. It's peace.
[1:23:32] It's longsuffering. It's gentleness.
[1:23:34] It's goodness. It's faith. It's meekness
[1:23:36] and temperance. And against such there
[1:23:38] is no law." In other words, you can have
[1:23:40] all the love you want to and there ain't
[1:23:41] no law against it. Hello, somebody. You
[1:23:43] can go out and love everybody and you'll
[1:23:45] never break a law of God. You can have
[1:23:47] all the joy you want to and you never
[1:23:49] break the law of God. There ain't no
[1:23:51] crime against having joy. There ain't no
[1:23:54] crime in rejoicing. There ain't no crime
[1:23:56] in being longsuffering to those that are
[1:23:58] in trouble that are found in sin. And
[1:24:00] you forgive them today and you forgive
[1:24:02] them tomorrow. And you forgive them the
[1:24:04] next day and you forgive them next week.
[1:24:06] and you're long-suffering because
[1:24:08] they're going through a struggle. And
[1:24:09] you'll never find that it be a crime
[1:24:11] before God for you to be long-suffering.
[1:24:13] There's no crime in being peaceful. And
[1:24:15] there's no crime in trying to bring
[1:24:17] resolution when there's trouble amongst
[1:24:19] other people.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; There's no law against meekness. There's
[1:24:24] no law against temperance. You can be as
[1:24:26] meek as you want to. Isn't that
[1:24:27] wonderful? Hallelujah. You got free
[1:24:30] liberty to be as meek as you want to.
[1:24:32] There's no law against it. There's no
[1:24:34] law against temperaments or having a
[1:24:36] good temper. There's no law against it.
[1:24:38] Can I just say that again? There ain't
[1:24:40] no law against having a good temper. So
[1:24:42] go on and do it all you want to. Just
[1:24:44] have the best temper you can have and
[1:24:45] don't even worry about it because you'll
[1:24:47] never break the law. There's no law
[1:24:50] against having good temper.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You can have all the love you want.
[1:24:54] Well, that just makes me feel good. You
[1:24:57] can have all the love you want. Nobody's
[1:24:58] going to frown at you. There ain't no
[1:25:00] lot. Some may get after you. Don't think
[1:25:01] that. I know that seems like there is
[1:25:03] sometimes you get somebody that gets a
[1:25:04] little free in the spirit and they say,
[1:25:06] "Well, there ain't no law against joy."
[1:25:07] But sometimes people try to make it that
[1:25:09] way. Somebody starts to worshiping and
[1:25:11] clapping, praising God, and that little
[1:25:12] spirit will come in. Say, "I don't know
[1:25:14] why they're doing that. They're just
[1:25:15] trying to get emotional or something."
[1:25:16] But don't worry, you just go ahead and
[1:25:18] be the way you feel like being and
[1:25:19] worship God the way you want to cuz
[1:25:21] there ain't no law against it.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; So, just let them worship and let them
[1:25:25] clap and let them dance and let them
[1:25:26] sing and let them praise God because
[1:25:28] there ain't no law against joy. Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "If we live in the spirit,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; let us also walk in the spirit."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; In other words, our nature changes. But
[1:25:40] Ron said, "When you're a Christian, your
[1:25:41] nature is a Christian. You don't have to
[1:25:43] say now you don't smoke and you can't
[1:25:45] drink and you can't do that." He said,
[1:25:46] "You don't have to say that to a
[1:25:47] Christian." He said, "They just don't do
[1:25:49] it anyhow because their nature is
[1:25:50] different. The spirit of Christ is in
[1:25:52] the person and Christ don't do those
[1:25:54] things."
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, you have to love the
[1:25:57] Lord and you ought to go to church." He
[1:25:59] said, "You don't have to tell a
[1:26:00] Christian that.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell a Christian that
[1:26:03] you ought to go to church, and you don't
[1:26:05] have to tell a Christian that you ought
[1:26:06] to love the Lord." He said, "You don't
[1:26:07] have to tell them people that. They go
[1:26:09] anyhow. They'll walk through rain.
[1:26:11] They'll go. They're going through death
[1:26:12] to go to church, and they love it. They
[1:26:14] just got to get there. That's all there
[1:26:16] is to it. It's their life. If they if if
[1:26:18] they don't, they feel like they're
[1:26:19] perishing." He said, "You got to get
[1:26:21] there." And whenever there's just
[1:26:22] something there's burning in your heart,
[1:26:24] they don't go there to argue. They don't
[1:26:26] go there to fuss, but they go there to
[1:26:28] worship God. And then they go home
[1:26:30] refreshed. Isn't that a wonderful life?
[1:26:32] Isn't that Isn't that what a Christian
[1:26:34] really is, brother Mark? You don't have
[1:26:35] to make a Christian be a Christian. You
[1:26:37] don't have to make them worship God. You
[1:26:39] don't have to make them go to church.
[1:26:41] You don't have to make them praise God.
[1:26:42] You don't have to beat them into saying
[1:26:44] amen. You don't have to force them to
[1:26:46] read their Bible. You don't have to make
[1:26:47] them pray. You don't have to make them
[1:26:49] stand on the things of God. You don't
[1:26:51] have to make them love one another. You
[1:26:53] don't have to make them be
[1:26:54] longsuffering. It's because there's a
[1:26:56] Christian. They're a Christian and the
[1:26:58] nature of Jesus Christ is on the inside
[1:27:00] of them and it's expressed in their
[1:27:02] life.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make a Christian be a
[1:27:05] Christian.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that wonderful?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make them. See, the
[1:27:09] evidence of our life manifests what we
[1:27:12] are.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; We're Christians. How many Christians do
[1:27:14] we have here?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what I see when I look
[1:27:19] around the room? I see a room full of
[1:27:21] Christians,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; believers that love the Lord. You know
[1:27:24] how you can tell because you know can I
[1:27:26] can I just be can I just be free this
[1:27:28] morning? Let me tell you how you you can
[1:27:29] tell the maturity of a Christian is when
[1:27:32] somebody does something wrong and you go
[1:27:34] to them and they accept it.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; You know how refreshing it is to go to
[1:27:39] somebody and say brother you know this
[1:27:41] really wasn't the right thing and y'all
[1:27:43] you handled that wrong and you know just
[1:27:45] according to the word it just you know
[1:27:46] it just wasn't right. Says you know what
[1:27:47] brother I'm sorry about that. We we
[1:27:49] shouldn't have done that. Let me let me
[1:27:50] go go back and correct it. It's a
[1:27:53] maturity
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; of a believer.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So you don't you don't have to beat them
[1:27:56] up over it. You just help them to grow
[1:27:59] into it.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; So see that's what we are. Our lives
[1:28:03] manifest the life of a Christian. The
[1:28:06] evidence of our life manifest what we
[1:28:08] are. That's what happened to Daniel.
[1:28:10] Daniel knew the penalty. But Mark, he
[1:28:12] knew he he he knew what they would do,
[1:28:14] but he was willing. He was willing to
[1:28:16] pay the price because his life was going
[1:28:19] to manifest what he was what he was. So
[1:28:21] he went down and he prayed. The Bible
[1:28:23] says when they found him praying, they
[1:28:25] took him and they threw him over in a
[1:28:26] den of lions and they sealed up the
[1:28:28] door. The king, Bible said, but the
[1:28:31] king, because he loved Daniel, he stayed
[1:28:33] up all night and he lamented and he
[1:28:35] worried and tossing and troubled. I
[1:28:37] thought, isn't it something that all
[1:28:38] night long the king was tossing and
[1:28:40] troubled and and troubled about and had
[1:28:42] a sleepless night. But the whole night
[1:28:44] the king was worrying. Daniel was laying
[1:28:46] in a dinner line rested. But remember
[1:28:48] that that old lion, he just come over
[1:28:49] there. Daniel, he just slept all through
[1:28:51] the night. He he just make a pillow out
[1:28:53] of it just to lay there and rest. I
[1:28:55] thought they they may be worrying, but
[1:28:56] Daniel wasn't worried because Daniel was
[1:28:59] what he was. He was a Christian. He he
[1:29:01] believed God. He he knew what he was. I
[1:29:03] I I say a Christian, but you know what I
[1:29:05] mean. He was a believer of God. And
[1:29:07] because he was a son of God that they
[1:29:08] may have worried all night, but Daniel
[1:29:10] didn't worry. The Bible said, "And the
[1:29:11] king rose the next morning and he came
[1:29:13] down to the den of lions and he cried
[1:29:15] out unto Daniel. He said, "Oh Daniel,
[1:29:17] servant of the living God, is thy God
[1:29:19] whom thou serve continually able to
[1:29:21] deliver thee from the lions?" And Daniel
[1:29:23] said, "Oh king, live forever." Can you
[1:29:25] imagine his voice up against that
[1:29:27] against that stone? Oh king, live
[1:29:29] forever. For my God has sent his angel,
[1:29:31] and he has shut the lion's mouths and
[1:29:34] they have not hurt me. For as much as
[1:29:36] before him innocency was found in me,
[1:29:38] and I have done him no hurt, and I have
[1:29:41] done you no hurt. The Bible said, "And
[1:29:43] the king was exceeding glad. And he
[1:29:45] said, he commanded they should take
[1:29:46] Daniel out of the den. And they took him
[1:29:48] out. He said, "And Daniel was found
[1:29:50] alive because he believed in his God.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And they took the accusers of Daniel and
[1:29:56] their families and their wives and their
[1:29:58] children, and they threw him down in the
[1:30:00] den of lions." And the Bible said, "And
[1:30:02] the lions devoured all of them, but
[1:30:04] Daniel they did not harm." And then the
[1:30:06] king made another decree. He said,
[1:30:08] "Since these decrees, since they can't
[1:30:10] be changed, and since they're made after
[1:30:12] the law of the Mes and Persians, and
[1:30:14] nobody can change them," he said, "I
[1:30:15] make a decree that in every dominion in
[1:30:17] my kingdom that men would tremble in
[1:30:19] fear after the God of Daniel, for he is
[1:30:22] the living God and steadfast in uh
[1:30:25] forever, and his kingdom that shall
[1:30:27] never be destroyed, and his dominion
[1:30:29] shall never be an end."
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; He's got a God that is able to keep him.
[1:30:33] He's got a God that does signs and
[1:30:35] wonders. He's got a God that can deliver
[1:30:37] him. He's got a God that is able to
[1:30:39] bring him uh through through through the
[1:30:41] the night in the den of lions. He's got
[1:30:44] a God that is able to bring him through.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You realize, friends, Daniel had
[1:30:48] something that held him through the
[1:30:50] middle of the night. He had something
[1:30:51] that would hold him through the law. It
[1:30:53] held him through the decree and then it
[1:30:55] held him through judgment. And I think
[1:30:57] of it, in the time of law, his hope was
[1:31:00] in the Lord. In the time of judgment,
[1:31:02] his hope was in the Lord. You say,
[1:31:04] "Brother Matt, that was good for Daniel,
[1:31:05] but what about us?" Can I have just a
[1:31:07] minute? That was good for Daniel, but
[1:31:09] what about us? Daniel's hope was in the
[1:31:11] Lord. He had something in him that even
[1:31:13] though he knew it would cause him his
[1:31:15] death, but he would still kneel down and
[1:31:17] he would pray to God. It don't matter
[1:31:19] what the men say. It don't matter what
[1:31:21] decree they give, there's something on
[1:31:22] the inside of me that caused me to hold
[1:31:24] to the word of God. And the word of God
[1:31:26] called me to bow down before God three
[1:31:29] times a day. So, I find myself obeying
[1:31:32] the word of the Lord. It didn't matter
[1:31:34] what the man said. There was something
[1:31:36] in him that held him to God's word
[1:31:38] despite the decree that was put upon his
[1:31:41] life.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Said Paul said, listen, he said, we had
[1:31:44] that same thing. He said, which hope we
[1:31:46] have as an anchor of the soul, both sure
[1:31:49] and steadfast, and which enterth into
[1:31:52] that within the veil. In other words,
[1:31:54] Paul said, we have an anchor, brother
[1:31:56] Wesley, that goes beyond the veil.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I won't be long on this. I just want you
[1:32:00] to catch it. We have an anchor that goes
[1:32:03] beyond the veil. Isn't this something?
[1:32:05] See, our anchor of our soul, it's went
[1:32:07] beyond the veil and it's anchored. Isn't
[1:32:08] that the way it is with a ship? You ever
[1:32:10] notice a ship out at sea here and it's
[1:32:12] tossed to and fro and the waves are are
[1:32:15] pulling it out and it's trying to to
[1:32:17] stay a course, but in the middle of
[1:32:18] storm, brother Mark, all of a sudden
[1:32:20] when the storm strikes, it can't stay on
[1:32:22] its course. In the middle of the storm,
[1:32:24] it ain't got no time to run. There ain't
[1:32:26] no time to flee. But but because the
[1:32:28] storm is great, the only choice that it
[1:32:30] has is to drop anchor in the face of the
[1:32:33] storm. And it's anchor. When the ship's
[1:32:35] anchor, it goes down to the bottom. It's
[1:32:37] trying to find something solid that it
[1:32:39] can hook on so that in the middle of the
[1:32:42] storm, it won't get thrown out of its
[1:32:44] course. So at after the storm passes by,
[1:32:46] then the ship can carry on its way. I
[1:32:48] thought, isn't that the way it is with
[1:32:50] our life that we have an anchor that
[1:32:52] would go down and find something?
[1:32:53] Brother Mah, let me tell you this,
[1:32:55] church. In the middle of a storm, it
[1:32:56] ain't the time to run. In the middle of
[1:32:58] a storm, it ain't the time to try to
[1:33:00] flee and out try to outrun the wind and
[1:33:03] outrun the waves and try to flee from
[1:33:05] it. But in the midst of the storm, it's
[1:33:07] time to drop anchor.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; That's when you anchor yourself in the
[1:33:10] word of God. That's when you buckle down
[1:33:12] in God's word and say, "The devil's
[1:33:14] trying to pull me this way or pull me
[1:33:16] that way or to turn my heart or to turn
[1:33:18] my life, but Lord, let me anchor in the
[1:33:20] word of God." In the middle of the
[1:33:23] storm, you drop anchor. Abraham said,
[1:33:25] "Here it comes." That anchor drops
[1:33:27] beyond the veil. You think about when an
[1:33:28] anchor goes down. So, see, it drops
[1:33:30] beyond the veil of water and you can't
[1:33:32] even see what it's attached to because
[1:33:35] it's anchored beyond the veil.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And here it finds a mountain or a rock
[1:33:39] down there beyond the veil to the bottom
[1:33:41] of the sea on the top of some big
[1:33:42] mountain until it holds on to a crevice
[1:33:44] and then the sea can't move it no more.
[1:33:46] It's anchored out of sight. He said,
[1:33:48] "And every person that has received
[1:33:50] Jesus Christ as a personal savior that's
[1:33:53] been born again of the Holy Spirit,
[1:33:55] you've dropped an anchor." Hello,
[1:33:56] somebody. Every person that's been born
[1:33:59] again, you've dropped an anchor.
[1:34:00] Therefore, if you're sick, your hope is
[1:34:02] built on Christ. You've dropped an
[1:34:04] anchor. If the doctor says one thing or
[1:34:06] another, but your hope is built on
[1:34:08] Christ, you've dropped an anchor. It
[1:34:09] says, "See, your faith is anchored
[1:34:11] beyond the veil." That means it don't
[1:34:13] matter what waves may rise. Can I just
[1:34:15] say it like this? The waves may rise and
[1:34:17] symptoms may rise in our life and
[1:34:19] circumstances they may rise in our life.
[1:34:21] But my anchor goes beyond the veil. My
[1:34:24] anchor is not anchored in the in the
[1:34:26] surface. It's anchored beyond the veil.
[1:34:28] He said here the fever may rise, six
[1:34:30] spells may rise, anything, but somewhere
[1:34:32] out yonder in that mystic land. What you
[1:34:35] have got your hopes built on. Even when
[1:34:37] the doctor said it's gone, the medicine
[1:34:39] says it can't do nothing. Surgery has
[1:34:41] failed. He said, "But my hope is not
[1:34:42] built in that." But we have our hope
[1:34:45] within the veil.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "What veil is my hope in?" He
[1:34:48] said, "It ain't the veil of water like
[1:34:50] when you're at out at sea. It ain't the
[1:34:52] veil of a church, but tomorrow," he
[1:34:54] said, "but that veil is through the
[1:34:56] shedding of his blood that tore his
[1:34:58] spirit from his body." And between that
[1:35:00] veil, the anchor has caught a hold of
[1:35:03] something. That means it don't matter,
[1:35:05] brother Travis, what we're facing. It
[1:35:07] don't matter what what trials that we're
[1:35:09] going through that here. Paul said, "We
[1:35:11] have a strong consolation." Do you
[1:35:13] realize that not everybody had a strong
[1:35:15] consolation? This wasn't to everybody.
[1:35:17] Paul said, "You said it wasn't
[1:35:18] everybody." Well, who who was it to?
[1:35:20] Paul said, "We have a strong consolation
[1:35:22] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[1:35:25] upon the hope set before us." In other
[1:35:28] words, the ones that have a consolation
[1:35:30] are those that was willing to drop
[1:35:32] anchor. It's those that have fled for
[1:35:34] refuge, those that have laid hold upon
[1:35:37] the hope, those that have laid their
[1:35:38] anchor down in the time of storm. if
[1:35:40] they're not willing to drop anchor, they
[1:35:42] don't have that strong consolation.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "But because we're willing to
[1:35:46] lay hold upon the hope that is set
[1:35:48] before us." So, so brother brother Mark,
[1:35:50] we that's why we that's why we drop
[1:35:52] anchor in the word of God when we're
[1:35:54] going through many things and many
[1:35:55] trials. I know people try to anchor
[1:35:57] their life in a lot of things. They try
[1:35:59] to it took me too long to get here, but
[1:36:01] but they they try to anchor their life
[1:36:03] in a lot of things, but friends, there
[1:36:04] ain't no other anchor that's going to
[1:36:06] hold you there. They they they try to
[1:36:08] find refuge in many things. They anchor
[1:36:10] in a job and say, "Well, as long as I
[1:36:12] got this job, everything's going to be
[1:36:13] okay." But friends, you can't anchor in
[1:36:15] a job because the job can fail you. You
[1:36:18] can't anchor in the church because the
[1:36:19] church can fail you. You can't anchor in
[1:36:21] a in a preacher, in a brother, in a
[1:36:23] mama, in a daddy. You can't anchor in
[1:36:25] nobody else cuz every one of us can fail
[1:36:27] you. But there ain't but one place that
[1:36:29] you can anchor in. You must be anchored
[1:36:31] in Jesus Christ and Christ alone.
[1:36:35] We had to find an anchor in the time of
[1:36:37] trouble. What do I do? I don't flee. I
[1:36:39] drop anchor. I dig down in the word of
[1:36:42] God. I find me a rock somewhere that
[1:36:44] applies to my situation and I drop
[1:36:46] anchor in it that it'll hold me in the
[1:36:48] middle of a storm.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; We find anchor in Jesus Christ. Christ
[1:36:53] is his word. That's why we put so much
[1:36:55] emphasis on the word of God
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; because that's where that's it becomes
[1:37:00] an anchor. You think about it. You take
[1:37:02] every promised word, brother Wesley, it
[1:37:04] becomes an anchor in every situation. Is
[1:37:06] that not true? the promised word.
[1:37:07] Whenever whenever the greatest
[1:37:09] circumstances can come to your life, the
[1:37:11] only thing that holds you is you have an
[1:37:13] anchor in the word of God.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; If it ain't for no other reason that God
[1:37:16] would allow things to come to your life
[1:37:18] just to prove to you that you're really
[1:37:20] anchored in the word, then I say let the
[1:37:22] storm come. That just to prove that
[1:37:24] we're anchored in the word because
[1:37:25] that's what's going to take us through
[1:37:26] the one day we're going to have to cross
[1:37:28] through this threshold of time into
[1:37:30] eternity. And we want to make sure and
[1:37:32] be sure that we're anchored in the word
[1:37:34] of God.
[1:37:36] anchored in Christ.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Said, see, you can take every promised
[1:37:40] word of God, it becomes an anchor to
[1:37:42] you. A promised word, can I say it like
[1:37:45] this? Under the shed blood becomes a
[1:37:48] stronghold to every believer.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that this morning. And you
[1:37:53] know what the best part about it is? Is
[1:37:56] that our anchor isn't just blindly
[1:37:59] hooked into something.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I think this is so good. said, "See, our
[1:38:03] anchor was delivered to its resting
[1:38:05] place." This is what Paul said. He said,
[1:38:07] "Whether the forerunner is for us
[1:38:09] entered, even Jesus, he was made a high
[1:38:11] priest forever after the order of
[1:38:14] Melchazdc." Isn't it something? So here
[1:38:16] he says that the our anchor goes beyond
[1:38:19] the veil, but our anchor when it went
[1:38:22] beyond the veil, but there was one that
[1:38:24] went before us that became a high
[1:38:26] priest. He entered in beyond the veil
[1:38:29] and came a high priest beyond the veil
[1:38:31] before we would ever come to this place.
[1:38:34] You know, I got to think about how how
[1:38:36] the other here a few years ago, we were
[1:38:37] out there on the lake and me and brother
[1:38:40] Dave, I believe it was, and we were out
[1:38:42] there on the lake and and uh and going
[1:38:44] diving and doing some spear fishing. We
[1:38:46] got out there in Lake uh um out in Hot
[1:38:49] Springs and storm got so bad, it's a
[1:38:51] real big lake and we had just a little
[1:38:52] bitty boat and it it got so bad it was
[1:38:55] blowing that boat every which way. But
[1:38:57] you can still it was just windy and
[1:38:58] choppy and but this sun's still shining
[1:39:01] and underneath the water you can still
[1:39:03] go fishing and you because you're you're
[1:39:04] way down below the waves. But we we got
[1:39:06] out there and we threw the anchor but
[1:39:08] every time we would throw the anchor it
[1:39:09] just kept dragging along the bottom of
[1:39:11] the lake and the wind was just blowing
[1:39:12] it along the bottom of the lake and and
[1:39:14] we we fought for an hour or so trying to
[1:39:16] get our boat to be able to stay because
[1:39:17] you don't want to go diving and leave
[1:39:18] your boat unhooked. You you'll never be
[1:39:20] able to find your boat when you come
[1:39:21] back up. So here after a little while we
[1:39:23] struggled and struggled and threw the
[1:39:25] anchor down and brought it back up and
[1:39:26] threw it back down and brought it back
[1:39:28] up. After a little while I said,
[1:39:29] "Brother, this is silly." He said,
[1:39:31] "What?" I said, "We're scuba divers.
[1:39:32] We've got scuba gear here. We have an
[1:39:34] anchor that can't take hold. We've been
[1:39:36] fighting this for half an hour or an
[1:39:37] hour." So finally, I just put on my
[1:39:39] scuba gear and I put on my tank and got
[1:39:40] my mask and fins. I dropped about 60
[1:39:43] feet down in the water. I found the
[1:39:44] anchor and I let the water or the the
[1:39:47] wind pull us back until I found a rock
[1:39:48] over in that lake. And I took the anchor
[1:39:50] anchor and turned it down and jammed it
[1:39:52] down there in that rock until it got a
[1:39:54] hold. Then I went back up and said, "Now
[1:39:57] we're good. We're on a rock." I thought
[1:39:58] that's the same thing that Paul was
[1:40:00] saying that Jesus done for us. Our
[1:40:03] anchor did not blindly f find its way
[1:40:05] beyond the veil. He said, "But we have
[1:40:08] one that has gone before us." He's the
[1:40:10] forerunner that entered in beyond the
[1:40:12] veil. our anchor. Our our soul is
[1:40:14] anchored in Jesus Christ. And he went as
[1:40:17] our anchor beyond the veil. And he found
[1:40:19] a place to lay anchor that would hold us
[1:40:22] through every storm. He said, what did
[1:40:24] he do? He became the high priest after
[1:40:26] the order of Melazdc. My isn't that
[1:40:29] powerful how he became, you say, well,
[1:40:31] how did he go before us? He became the
[1:40:32] high priest. He hooked us into a rock,
[1:40:34] brother Mar, that we could be sure and
[1:40:36] certain that his word would come to
[1:40:38] pass. But Ram said he came down. He was
[1:40:40] in the beginning. The Bible said he was
[1:40:42] the word. He was the logos. It went out
[1:40:44] of God. The logos in the beginning. And
[1:40:46] then he became the word. Then he
[1:40:48] ascended upon that glorious day of
[1:40:50] Easter. He became not only the word but
[1:40:52] he came became the high priest of his
[1:40:55] own word. So here the word came down
[1:40:58] became logos became flesh upon the
[1:41:00] earth. Then he went back into the heaven
[1:41:02] and he became the high priest of his own
[1:41:05] word. He said, "Then how could we doubt
[1:41:07] it or walk or walk to him and not
[1:41:09] believe that we're going to receive what
[1:41:11] we ask for? For he and the word and the
[1:41:15] He's the word and the intercessor of the
[1:41:17] word." So, not only is he the word of
[1:41:19] God, but he went and he hooked the
[1:41:21] anchor in something that we could be
[1:41:23] established in. He became the
[1:41:25] intercessor of the word. So, he gave you
[1:41:27] the promise and then he interceded to
[1:41:29] make sure that the promise was given by
[1:41:31] him. He said he became the high priest.
[1:41:33] You realize what I I ran out of time
[1:41:35] this morning. You realize what it means
[1:41:37] to be the high priest. And being the the
[1:41:39] high priest in the Old Testament was the
[1:41:41] mediator between God and man. So every
[1:41:44] man before Christ had to go to the high
[1:41:47] priest and ask the high priest to get a
[1:41:50] hold of God for me. You realize what
[1:41:52] they had to do. Can you go and make a
[1:41:54] sacrifice? And according to the Old
[1:41:56] Testament, the high priest would go out
[1:41:57] and he would go out and he would lay a a
[1:41:59] sacrifice for his own sins and his own
[1:42:02] failures. And after he would make a
[1:42:03] sacrifice for his own sins, then he
[1:42:05] would go and he would make a sacrifice
[1:42:07] on behalf of the people and he would
[1:42:09] intercede for the people and the needs
[1:42:11] that they have, he would bring before
[1:42:13] God as an intercessor that God would be
[1:42:15] able to meet their needs. Said, see that
[1:42:17] was in the Old Testament. That's what a
[1:42:18] high priest does. You've seen it in ex
[1:42:20] started in Exodus the 28th chapter under
[1:42:23] the the Aeronic priesthood. But the the
[1:42:25] Bible says that Aaron and his sons uh
[1:42:27] the the the brother of Moses and his
[1:42:29] sons from among the children of Israel
[1:42:31] would be ministered in the priest's
[1:42:33] office. They were all that that he
[1:42:34] became a high priest. He became uh the
[1:42:37] one that was anointed to office. Only
[1:42:38] the high priest is anointed. He was
[1:42:40] anointed to that office. He's anointed
[1:42:42] with oil. The the high priest wears a
[1:42:44] special garment that the other priests
[1:42:46] don't wear. The the the high priest is
[1:42:48] the only one that could enter into the
[1:42:50] holies of holies. And whatever the needs
[1:42:52] of the people were, it was the high
[1:42:53] priest that's able to take it before
[1:42:55] God. In other words, he could go beyond
[1:42:57] the veil of the holies of holies and
[1:43:00] meet God there and intercede on their
[1:43:02] behalf and bring the answer from God
[1:43:04] back to the people. And this this is
[1:43:06] what the Bible said in the New
[1:43:07] Testament. He said, "But Jesus is the
[1:43:09] high priest right now. He continues the
[1:43:12] high priest after the order of Melazdc.
[1:43:15] He's the high priest forever. There's no
[1:43:17] other high priest but him. No other
[1:43:19] mediator between God and men but the man
[1:43:21] Christ Jesus. That's right. He's the
[1:43:23] only one. He's the same yesterday,
[1:43:25] today, and forever. And brother Bam
[1:43:27] said, "So if he remains the same high
[1:43:29] priest, and the Bible says we can touch
[1:43:31] him by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:43:32] like that little woman that touched his
[1:43:34] garment, your faith can touch him
[1:43:36] tonight, he'll act the same way in human
[1:43:38] flesh like he did when he was in human
[1:43:40] flesh because he is the high priest of
[1:43:43] our infirmities." That's right.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And the best part, brother David, is he
[1:43:46] wasn't a high priest after the Levitical
[1:43:48] law. He wasn't a high priest. Why didn't
[1:43:50] the Bible say he was a high priest that
[1:43:52] would carry after the Arenaic
[1:43:53] priesthood? He couldn't have came after
[1:43:55] the Aaronic priesthood. Matter of fact,
[1:43:56] he didn't even come from the tribe of
[1:43:58] Levi. It was from the tribe of Judah.
[1:44:00] Never in the Bible did you find a priest
[1:44:02] that came or a high priest that came out
[1:44:04] of the tribe of Judah. So, so it had to
[1:44:06] be after a different order than the
[1:44:08] order of the Levitical law, which
[1:44:10] demanded that a high priest could only
[1:44:12] come after the tribe of Levi. So, every
[1:44:14] high priest all through the Old
[1:44:16] Testament that came from the tribe of
[1:44:17] Levi from Aaron on down that from that
[1:44:19] Levitical priesthood. And see, brother
[1:44:21] says, see, but God had to bring him
[1:44:23] after the order of Melazdc. He said,
[1:44:25] watch why he done it. He said he would
[1:44:27] in if perfection because if perfection
[1:44:30] came by the Levitical priesthood, for
[1:44:32] under it people receive the law. He
[1:44:34] said, "Then why would there need to come
[1:44:36] another priest that would rise after a
[1:44:38] different order? If perfection could
[1:44:40] come by Levitical law and a Levitical
[1:44:42] priesthood, then why would God have to
[1:44:44] send another priest after a different
[1:44:46] order, the order of Melazdc, and not be
[1:44:48] called after the order of Aaron?" He
[1:44:51] said, "See, the law or the legalist," he
[1:44:53] said, says you have to do this or don't
[1:44:55] do this. You're not a Christian if you
[1:44:57] don't keep the Sabbath, if you don't eat
[1:44:59] meat, if you do these things. He said,
[1:45:00] "All of these are legal ideas. And if
[1:45:03] you've got to do that to go to church,
[1:45:05] if you don't, you're going to pay a
[1:45:06] penalty for it. He said, you got to do a
[1:45:08] novena, all these stuff. He said, but
[1:45:10] that stuff is nonsense.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; It's nonsense. If you had to do all that
[1:45:14] and uh to go to church and all that to
[1:45:16] be right, all that legal, he said, that
[1:45:18] stuff is nonsense. You're saved by the
[1:45:20] grace of God and by the fornowledge of
[1:45:22] God, by his predestination. God called
[1:45:25] Abraham by predestination. He He hated
[1:45:27] Esau. He loved Jacob by fornowledge and
[1:45:30] predestination. It's God's fornowledge
[1:45:32] that knows these things.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Said, so it's not by the law. That's why
[1:45:36] the the our high priest couldn't come
[1:45:38] after the Levitical priesthood. He had
[1:45:40] to come after the order of Melazdc,
[1:45:42] which had no beginning of days and no
[1:45:44] ending of night. You see what God did?
[1:45:46] He went right around that whole law. And
[1:45:48] he raised up a high priest, brother Mah,
[1:45:50] that was outside of the Levitical law
[1:45:52] that would be able to go all the way to
[1:45:54] the throne of God.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; He said, so that we're saved. He said,
[1:45:59] 'Well, what's the use of preaching the
[1:46:00] gospel then? If everybody's saved by
[1:46:02] predestination, can I just tell you kind
[1:46:04] of I'll just let Jesus answer it. He
[1:46:06] said, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a
[1:46:07] net that was cast into the sea, and it
[1:46:09] gathered every kind. When it was full,
[1:46:11] it drew to the shore, it set down. There
[1:46:13] was good vessels that was kept, and the
[1:46:14] bad was thrown away. He said, "That's
[1:46:16] the way the end of the world will be.
[1:46:17] The angels shall come and sever the
[1:46:19] wicked from among the just, and that the
[1:46:21] that the wicked will be cast into the
[1:46:22] furnace of fire." When you cast out a
[1:46:24] net, brother Mark, what do you catch?
[1:46:26] You may catch fish, you catch turtles,
[1:46:28] you catch snakes, you catch uh uh uh uh
[1:46:31] frogs, anything that could be caught in
[1:46:32] the net. But Ram said, "That's like the
[1:46:34] gospel." He said, "I'm just preaching
[1:46:35] the gospel. We throw the net out. When I
[1:46:37] pull it back, all whosoever will let him
[1:46:39] come." He said, "And here they come up
[1:46:41] to the altar. They all hang around the
[1:46:43] altar. They pray. They cry. I don't know
[1:46:45] one for another. It's not my business. I
[1:46:47] wasn't sent to judge. I'm a gospel
[1:46:49] preacher. It's God that discerns who
[1:46:50] they are."
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; But listen, I think this is one of the
[1:46:54] most powerful scriptures. I wanted to
[1:46:55] get to this. I think this is one of the
[1:46:57] most powerful scriptures in the Bible.
[1:47:00] Paul said, "But this man, because he
[1:47:02] continuthth forever, hath an
[1:47:04] unchangeable priesthood." So here that
[1:47:07] Christ not only is our anchor, he's our
[1:47:09] anchor. That's beyond the veil. But he
[1:47:11] took the anchor
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; beyond the veil and he hooked it right
[1:47:15] at the throne of God
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; and he became the intercessor to make
[1:47:18] sure that there wasn't nothing nothing
[1:47:20] missing that you that there wasn't no
[1:47:22] way to keep you from the presence of
[1:47:24] God. And then he says, "But this man,
[1:47:26] because he continuthth forever."
[1:47:27] Somebody say, "Forever."
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Don't that include now?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He continuth forever, he hath an
[1:47:34] unchangeable priesthood.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That all that he ever done, he still
[1:47:37] does today. He said, "Wherefore he is
[1:47:40] able to save them to the uttermost that
[1:47:42] come unto God by him, seeing he liveth
[1:47:45] forever to make intercession for them."
[1:47:49] A isn't that wonderful that our anchor
[1:47:51] lives to make intercession for us.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Friends, I I can't find nothing in my
[1:47:56] life worthy enough to even talk to God.
[1:47:58] But I thank God I have an anchor that
[1:48:00] lives for the very purpose of making
[1:48:02] intercession for me. That this was his
[1:48:04] purpose of living upon this earth. It's
[1:48:06] his purpose of of being alive is to
[1:48:08] intercede for you. He said, and he's
[1:48:10] anchored it. He he he became such a high
[1:48:13] priest for us. He said, for such a high
[1:48:15] priest became us who is holy. Somebody
[1:48:17] say holy. He's harmless. He's undefiled.
[1:48:21] He's separate from sinners. He's been
[1:48:23] made higher than the heavens. And he
[1:48:25] don't need daily like those high priests
[1:48:27] to offer up a sacrifice first for his
[1:48:29] own sins and then for the people because
[1:48:31] he done it once. And that's all he ever
[1:48:33] had to do when he offered up himself.
[1:48:35] For the law maketh men high priests,
[1:48:38] which have infirmities. But the word of
[1:48:40] the oath since the law maketh the son
[1:48:43] who is consecrated forever more. He
[1:48:45] says, "See the law, it would bring a
[1:48:46] high priest of men that had infirmities.
[1:48:48] They would always have to make things
[1:48:50] right. They'd never be okay with God.
[1:48:52] There ain't no sure steadfast. There's
[1:48:53] no real anchor in it. But now God has
[1:48:56] sent an anchor to us, a hope that has
[1:48:58] became an anchor to our soul. And this
[1:49:00] man, Christ Jesus, who is our high
[1:49:02] priest, who has anchored us into the
[1:49:04] throne of God, but mark that we could be
[1:49:06] consecrated with God forever more."
[1:49:09] The word of the oath which was since the
[1:49:12] law maketh the son who is consecrated
[1:49:15] forever, forever more. I don't know
[1:49:18] about you, but that makes me want to
[1:49:19] shout this morning
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; to think about God
[1:49:24] having an anchor for my soul.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, something that you even
[1:49:30] holding on to, something that he took,
[1:49:32] let me tell you what he done as a music
[1:49:34] player is when I come.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; He came and took a hold of your heart.
[1:49:38] Yeah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; And stretched the line from your heart
[1:49:42] to the throne of God.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; And he hooked it right there at the
[1:49:45] throne of God.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He became an intercessor for you. So the
[1:49:49] very desires of your heart and the needs
[1:49:51] that you have in this life are heard by
[1:49:54] him.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And he made sure it the very promises.
[1:49:58] He said, "Here's the promise. You're the
[1:50:00] promised children. Here's the promises
[1:50:01] of God. But I'm going to go make sure
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; that whatever you have need of, it's
[1:50:06] done. Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go make sure that that you
[1:50:09] have a place to anchor your soul. That
[1:50:12] it ain't in men that fail and
[1:50:14] infirmities of men or the laws of men,
[1:50:17] but it's in the grace of Jesus Christ,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; the anchor of our soul.
[1:50:24] said, "God be blessed forever,
[1:50:28] Continueth forever
[1:50:31] after the order of Melazdc,
[1:50:34] the one that never had a beginning and
[1:50:36] never had an ending.
[1:50:38] Had no beginning of days or ending of
[1:50:40] night, but it was he that came."
[1:50:44] Isn't it something? An eternal God. You
[1:50:46] know what that means, Brother Caleb? It
[1:50:48] means an eternal God that he knew all
[1:50:51] your failures and all your mistakes and
[1:50:55] he knew how you'd be raised and what
[1:50:57] would take place in your life. Ain't
[1:50:58] nothing ever caught god off guard. He
[1:51:01] knew where you'd come from and what kind
[1:51:03] of religion you'd be raised in. God knew
[1:51:05] all that.
[1:51:07] But by his own fornowledge, he knew who
[1:51:09] you were.
[1:51:11] And God in this time he would come down
[1:51:15] and watch over your life and till it
[1:51:18] came to the time of his appointment.
[1:51:21] And then he would reach down from that
[1:51:24] throne of heaven and he would come down
[1:51:27] there and he would attach that to your
[1:51:28] heart and he would begin to draw you.
[1:51:31] And all of a sudden everything in your
[1:51:32] life that you just kind of went went
[1:51:34] with it. Whatever life led you, you just
[1:51:36] kind of went with it. Wherever your
[1:51:37] friends and peers as young men, wherever
[1:51:40] they lead you, you just kind of go along
[1:51:41] with the flow. But then one day, all of
[1:51:43] a sudden, you get to the end of that
[1:51:44] anchor cord and something just gets a
[1:51:47] hold of you. You know what it does? Let
[1:51:50] me tell you something. What every anchor
[1:51:51] does? When you put an anchor in the bow
[1:51:53] of a boat, it draws the boat's attention
[1:51:57] to where the anchor is anchored. It
[1:51:59] don't matter what way this boat is
[1:52:01] aiming, but when the anchor takes hold,
[1:52:04] that whole boat just spins around and it
[1:52:07] stands at attention
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; to where the anchor's being held. So
[1:52:10] that's what God done to our life.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; That whenever he tugged at our heart, by
[1:52:14] the way, he called us to attention
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; that there's one beyond the veil. Said,
[1:52:19] "Well, I can't see where it's hooked at.
[1:52:21] I can't see it." But you can take a hold
[1:52:23] of that cord and know that it's there.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; But something's anchored. I I can't see
[1:52:28] what it's hooked into. I I may not be
[1:52:30] able to see beyond the veil, but I know
[1:52:32] one thing. It's anchored. I can feel the
[1:52:34] tug on the rope. It's anchored. Whenever
[1:52:37] a storm comes, you know, you know when
[1:52:39] you feel it the most. In calm seas, you
[1:52:41] don't feel the anchor.
[1:52:43] It just kind of floats along. You're
[1:52:45] just easing. But in a when a rough sea
[1:52:47] comes, brother Tim, that's whenever you
[1:52:48] know the anchor's there.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; So don't don't shun all the rough seas.
[1:52:54] Those rough seas are a reminder that God
[1:52:57] has us anchored beyond the veil.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you. Maybe we could do
[1:53:00] that this morning as you stand to your
[1:53:02] feet. Sometimes it does us good. Lord, I
[1:53:04] thank you for a trial. I thank you for
[1:53:07] some hardship and things that come up
[1:53:10] upon my life that would remind me that I
[1:53:12] have an anchor that holds because I know
[1:53:15] that's what I'm going to need in the
[1:53:16] end. And I thank you for the reminder.
[1:53:18] It ought to give you courage, friends,
[1:53:21] that in a time of trouble, we have an
[1:53:23] anchor of our soul.
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:27] Satan don't win.
[1:53:30] He don't win. He You don't go back to
[1:53:32] the world and back into sin. Satan don't
[1:53:34] win.
[1:53:36] God wins. He won a victory over your
[1:53:38] heart a long time ago.
[1:53:42] And let me tell you this, end of the
[1:53:43] day, Satan's the loser and God's the
[1:53:46] winner. He'll win. He'll he said, "I've
[1:53:48] never lost a one. All that the father
[1:53:51] has given me will come to me. I've never
[1:53:53] lost a one."
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? Even though we fail
[1:53:57] and sometimes we lose sight of God, but
[1:54:01] God never loses sight of us.
[1:54:04] We're held in the palm of his hand.
[1:54:07] The Bible says he can be touched by the
[1:54:10] feeling of our infirmities. That means
[1:54:11] he cares about what you're going
[1:54:13] through. He cares about your trial.
[1:54:16] I know Satan wants us to be hard and our
[1:54:19] hearts to get hard, but friends, it
[1:54:21] don't matter what you're going through
[1:54:22] this morning. Just let your heart be
[1:54:24] soft before God. I wonder how many lift
[1:54:27] your hand and say, "Let me make that
[1:54:29] kind of a pledge this morning. Lord, let
[1:54:31] my heart be soft before you. Lord, let
[1:54:33] me serve you. God bless you, real
[1:54:35] Christians, real believers. Lord, let me
[1:54:38] let me dedicate my life to you a new
[1:54:40] Lord. Let me look past for a few moments
[1:54:43] past the waves that are that are
[1:54:45] crashing upon the ship and let me just
[1:54:47] close my eyes to the waves around me and
[1:54:50] let my heart just feel the anchor, the
[1:54:53] anchor that's attached to my soul. Lord,
[1:54:55] let me just feel it this morning. Isn't
[1:54:57] that what you want? Won't you just talk
[1:54:59] to the Lord just for a minute? said,
[1:55:01] "Lord, I just thank you, Lord, for
[1:55:03] holding me in the time of trouble, when
[1:55:06] the trials of my life would come great,
[1:55:08] but there's something that's just
[1:55:10] holding on to me. Lord, I thank you for
[1:55:12] it this morning. God, how you've never
[1:55:15] failed us, Lord. God, you see our hands,
[1:55:19] Lord, this morning, God. I just pray,
[1:55:22] Lord, that each person today,
[1:55:24] God, may we be able to get a hold of
[1:55:27] that anchor line, Lord, to feel what is
[1:55:30] holding us, God. May you give a reminder
[1:55:33] to us this morning, God. I know how easy
[1:55:36] it is, Lord, in the time of persecution
[1:55:39] and Lord, a time of great trials. Lord,
[1:55:41] in the midst of this evil age, Lord, how
[1:55:45] we get in our flesh sometimes, but Lord,
[1:55:48] I just know that sometimes we just need
[1:55:49] a reminder, Lord, that you're still
[1:55:51] there and you're the one that's holding
[1:55:52] on.
[1:55:54] God, I just ask you, Lord, that you
[1:55:56] would give a little tug this morning,
[1:55:59] Lord. Tug on every heart, Lord, every
[1:56:01] soul, Lord. God, may you tug at our
[1:56:05] hearts, Lord, to know that you're there,
[1:56:07] God, that you're holding us, Lord, that
[1:56:10] that your word is keeping us through the
[1:56:12] storms, God, that in just a few days,
[1:56:15] Lord, it'll all pass, God. May our
[1:56:18] attention and our heart be upon you.
[1:56:22] Lord, we just thank you for it now this
[1:56:23] morning. God, knowing in a few days,
[1:56:26] Lord, this life that's a few days and
[1:56:28] full of trouble. All the the clouds are
[1:56:30] going to fade away and the waves are
[1:56:32] going to subside. Lord, we'll walk right
[1:56:35] onto heaven shore.
[1:56:37] God, we just ask you, God, remind your
[1:56:41] children, Lord, those that need a
[1:56:43] reminder, Lord.
[1:56:45] Lord, that they have an anchor
[1:56:48] beyond the veil. Oh, we thank you for it
[1:56:51] now in Jesus name.
