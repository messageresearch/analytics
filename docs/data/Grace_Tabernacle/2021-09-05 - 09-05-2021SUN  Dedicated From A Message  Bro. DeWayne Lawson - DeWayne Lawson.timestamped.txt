[1:03:32] morning we've gathered here for a

[1:03:38] share with you and preach to you this
[1:03:41] morning a bit but uh i i want to if i
[1:03:44] can to turn to the book of romans the
[1:03:46] 9th chapter

[1:04:01] button for the internet you know so the
[1:04:03] flashlights or something because
[1:04:05] amen since especially since this covey
[1:04:07] had been a lot of people get to watch
[1:04:08] and amen can't get out and and so uh
[1:04:12] there was a time that i think we thought
[1:04:14] there was a curse uh to maybe to stream
[1:04:16] a little bit i think we've seen the
[1:04:18] blessing of it by now amen the lord has
[1:04:20] given us opportunity to be a part of
[1:04:22] meetings when we can't get there or
[1:04:23] can't drive across the country amen so
[1:04:26] we we certainly thank the lord for that
[1:04:28] and amen and now this morning in romans
[1:04:30] chapter nine
[1:04:32] uh we're going to look in verse
[1:04:34] 33. amen just something here let's look
[1:04:37] at 32 and 33
[1:04:39] and i just want to take our thought from
[1:04:41] here this morning
[1:04:42] wherefore
[1:04:44] because they sought it not by faith
[1:04:47] but as it were by the works of the law
[1:04:50] they stumbled at the stumbling
[1:04:52] stone for as it is written
[1:04:56] behold a laying sign
[1:04:58] a stumbling stone
[1:05:00] and a rock of offense
[1:05:03] but whosoever believeth on him
[1:05:07] shall not be ashamed
[1:05:09] let's bow our hearts father
[1:05:11] we thank you this morning for this
[1:05:14] wonderful congregation of people that
[1:05:15] have gathered in this building
[1:05:18] and lord we've not gathered here just to
[1:05:20] fellowship or
[1:05:22] to see one another but we've come here
[1:05:24] to honor you
[1:05:26] and lord we have dedicated our lives to
[1:05:28] you and to your word of this age
[1:05:30] and lord we've come together this
[1:05:32] morning to dedicate a build
[1:05:34] but father as we stand here today to
[1:05:36] proclaim things from your word
[1:05:38] lord we would like to invite you
[1:05:41] that you would come lord and you would
[1:05:43] take your word in your scripture
[1:05:45] the lord that you would establish hearts
[1:05:47] and lives upon the infallible truths of
[1:05:50] the word of god
[1:05:52] and lord the things that maybe would be
[1:05:54] planned to say that you wouldn't want
[1:05:56] said i pray you turn this lord
[1:05:59] father anything you would desire lord to
[1:06:01] be spoken
[1:06:03] i just pray that you would put it in our
[1:06:04] heart lord and that you would have a
[1:06:06] right away in this building this morning
[1:06:08] may your children feel the liberty lord
[1:06:11] to love you and worship you
[1:06:13] and lord may you you have the right of
[1:06:15] way in this building
[1:06:16] and father now as we commit it to you
[1:06:19] today we ask you to lead us lord do what
[1:06:22] no man could do speak to hearts lord
[1:06:24] change lives lord we're asking it in the
[1:06:27] name of jesus christ we pray
[1:06:29] amen and amen and may god bless you as
[1:06:32] you be seated today
[1:06:34] amen i uh i do want to thank brother
[1:06:37] matt for the opportunity to speak to you
[1:06:39] and we just want to uh just to take you
[1:06:41] off into the scripture here just a
[1:06:43] little bit and if i speak to you today
[1:06:45] i'd like to title this a man dedicated
[1:06:47] to a message
[1:06:49] dedicated to a message amen and i i i
[1:06:52] recognize that we are speaking a long
[1:06:55] dedication but you have to forgive me
[1:06:57] sometimes i'm not real traditional amen
[1:06:59] i get something on my heart and then i
[1:07:01] preach it and ask the lord to come and
[1:07:03] and to help us all amen but uh i i want
[1:07:05] to speak to you just a little bit from
[1:07:07] this one dedicated from a message uh
[1:07:09] brother uh the brethren have been
[1:07:11] preaching some tremendous messages and
[1:07:13] and i i just sat back and chuckled a
[1:07:16] little bit last night as josh bennett
[1:07:17] was preaching i thought if he goes just
[1:07:19] a little further i've got to change my
[1:07:21] entire
[1:07:22] sermon uh because he was just he was
[1:07:24] just working right in an area that was
[1:07:26] uh where i was uh hoping to be able to
[1:07:29] take some thoughts from today and uh and
[1:07:31] in being in that thought was is that
[1:07:34] this word that you're reading this
[1:07:36] morning this bible that you're holding
[1:07:37] or the bible that you believe is not
[1:07:40] just a history book but yet it is a book
[1:07:42] of prophecy it's the only book that you
[1:07:45] have that not only tells you the history
[1:07:47] but does foretell the future and the
[1:07:50] thing that we we have the beauty of what
[1:07:52] what the beauty of the bible is is that
[1:07:55] we hold it and we have seen uh the very
[1:07:58] pages of it fulfilled if you if you'd
[1:08:00] like to notice this because because it's
[1:08:02] not just a couple hundred year old book
[1:08:05] then the things that were written we
[1:08:07] seen written uh hundreds of years before
[1:08:09] the coming of christ and then when jesus
[1:08:11] came the bible continually said in the
[1:08:14] days of jesus he'd done this that it
[1:08:16] might be fulfilled he done this that it
[1:08:19] might be fulfilled now the fulfillment
[1:08:21] of those scriptures did not always match
[1:08:23] the teaching of the pharisees
[1:08:26] but the pharisees didn't hold the
[1:08:27] interpretation of the scripture the
[1:08:29] messiah held the interpretation of the
[1:08:31] scripture remember when he stood there
[1:08:33] in the sanctuary in luke chapter 4 they
[1:08:35] delivered a book unto him and when he
[1:08:37] got finished reading the anointing of
[1:08:38] the lord is upon me to preach he stood
[1:08:40] and said this day this scripture is
[1:08:43] fulfilled and who else had the right to
[1:08:45] really say when that scripture was
[1:08:47] fulfilled outside of the one that had
[1:08:49] wrote the scripture and then when the
[1:08:51] one that had wrote it said this is the
[1:08:53] thing that i intended for it then that
[1:08:56] day that scripture was fulfilled in
[1:08:58] their sight so the bible is plain to say
[1:09:01] that man
[1:09:02] he's constantly trying to interpret the
[1:09:04] word but the bible is of no private
[1:09:06] interpretation but god makes it live he
[1:09:10] makes his promise live and when you see
[1:09:12] the word living then that is the
[1:09:14] fulfillment of scripture the word alive
[1:09:17] and and how many places in the bible
[1:09:19] could we take in hundreds of years
[1:09:21] things foretold and then comes exactly
[1:09:23] now one of the great places in the bible
[1:09:25] that that i if you if you i'm going to
[1:09:28] skip a part of this because you heard
[1:09:29] brother josh last night speaking about
[1:09:31] the prophecies and the and the currency
[1:09:33] of the scriptures and how beautiful they
[1:09:35] are but one place uh that i'd like to
[1:09:37] take from the scripture concerning this
[1:09:39] matter is in the book of daniel the
[1:09:41] second chapter i i've been on a little
[1:09:43] study of daniel chapter two it's a
[1:09:45] powerful uh powerful area and if you if
[1:09:48] you'd like to read your bible you can go
[1:09:50] back to the book of daniel and realize
[1:09:52] that daniel is basically a book of
[1:09:54] revelation of the old testament and many
[1:09:56] of the things that daniel saw was the
[1:09:58] things that john saw and wrote in the
[1:10:00] book of revelations amen but they saw it
[1:10:03] different ways but it was looking at the
[1:10:05] same things now in the book of daniel
[1:10:08] the second chapter of course this is a
[1:10:10] time that when nebuchadnezzar was ruling
[1:10:12] the entire world as a babylonian king
[1:10:15] how many knows that nebuchadnezzar the
[1:10:17] babylonian world ruled in the time of
[1:10:20] nebuchadnezzar which would have been in
[1:10:21] the time of daniel and the hebrew
[1:10:23] children when you read about them
[1:10:25] israel the nation the jews had been
[1:10:28] taken into captivity and they were
[1:10:30] living in babylon under a king who was
[1:10:32] the ruler of the entire world because
[1:10:34] god let him be the ruler now when we say
[1:10:37] the ruler of the world we think today in
[1:10:40] the seven continents in the entire globe
[1:10:42] of the earth but the known world in that
[1:10:44] time was kind of a region what you would
[1:10:47] think of today maybe as just europe and
[1:10:49] and the central areas of uh from england
[1:10:52] over to china up and down to the tops of
[1:10:55] india that was the known world because
[1:10:56] they hadn't really crossed the seas and
[1:10:59] come into america all that part so when
[1:11:01] you say ruler of the world it was a
[1:11:03] ruler of that part of the world or the
[1:11:04] known civilized world during that time
[1:11:07] and babylon was the ruler there and
[1:11:09] nebuchadnezzar being the king now
[1:11:12] nebuchadnezzar having this rule amen of
[1:11:14] course they probably figured they would
[1:11:16] rule forever and that this the way would
[1:11:18] be but now if they had read the prophets
[1:11:21] like jeremiah jeremiah had already told
[1:11:24] them amen that their kingdom was going
[1:11:26] to be short-lived because whenever
[1:11:29] israel was captured and carried away
[1:11:32] into babylon amen that you know that
[1:11:34] jeremiah prophesied that only 70 years
[1:11:37] would be remaining of babylon until god
[1:11:40] would deliver the children of israel out
[1:11:42] of babylon now now i i don't have time
[1:11:44] to go deep into these things but i'll
[1:11:46] say this that the children of israel
[1:11:48] like the hebrew children and daniel them
[1:11:50] that you read about do you know they
[1:11:52] were delivered back to the very place
[1:11:54] that abraham had come out of and because
[1:11:57] of the failure in israel god allowed
[1:11:59] them to be carried back through the same
[1:12:01] trails to babylon that abraham would
[1:12:04] have left babylon and they were being
[1:12:06] carried back but watch now amen when
[1:12:08] they were being carried back they went
[1:12:10] back differently than abraham left there
[1:12:13] remember when abraham left there was no
[1:12:15] nation there was no people who believed
[1:12:17] in one god amen but when they went back
[1:12:20] they went back with a revelation of one
[1:12:22] god amen and of the god of abraham and
[1:12:25] they went back with that revelation now
[1:12:26] daniel amen he believed in this one god
[1:12:29] and and god had been so good to him amen
[1:12:32] that he stood out above all of his
[1:12:33] brethren now i don't have time to preach
[1:12:36] the whole book of daniel so i i'm going
[1:12:37] to try to just shorten the the thing
[1:12:39] you'll have to go read it later but but
[1:12:41] in the scripture here it tells us how
[1:12:43] that nebuchadnezzar had a great dream
[1:12:45] the king had a dream and how that dream
[1:12:48] troubled the king because he he saw some
[1:12:50] troubling things now there was a lot of
[1:12:52] wise men in the days of daniel there
[1:12:54] were a lot of wise men he meant in the
[1:12:56] time of the king he had he would have
[1:12:58] had a lot of preachers he would have had
[1:13:00] a a lot of theologians he had a a lot of
[1:13:03] people who were set there and they had
[1:13:05] jobs of of counseling and they were in
[1:13:08] the king's courts and they would train
[1:13:10] their whole lives wisdom and things and
[1:13:12] they knew a lot of things but when the
[1:13:14] king came to them and said look i've had
[1:13:16] this dream and i've seen this image and
[1:13:19] and it's a troubling image and i i want
[1:13:21] to understand this thing and he asked
[1:13:24] his uh soothsayers and he asked all the
[1:13:25] wise men he asked everybody can you can
[1:13:28] you tell me what the dream is and of
[1:13:29] course they gave that beautiful answer
[1:13:31] if you will tell us the dream we will
[1:13:34] tell you the interpretation thereof well
[1:13:36] i hate to say this but if you tell me a
[1:13:38] dream i could give you an interpretation
[1:13:41] now whether that's right or not where i
[1:13:43] mean that's yet to figure out now i have
[1:13:45] to say honestly that there's been a lot
[1:13:47] of demonology that's used a lot of
[1:13:49] dreams amen because you tell somebody a
[1:13:51] dream they'll make that baby come out
[1:13:53] the way they want you amen they'll make
[1:13:55] it say what they want it to say so
[1:13:57] they'll control your life amen and
[1:13:59] nebuchadnezzar was a wise old king and
[1:14:01] knew this so he said look god gave me
[1:14:04] this dream and if you could tell me the
[1:14:06] dream first and then tell me the
[1:14:08] interpretation then i'd know truly that
[1:14:11] your interpretation was right concerning
[1:14:13] this dream amen and you know what they
[1:14:15] found out there was nobody could do it
[1:14:17] they brought in everybody they brought
[1:14:19] in the most learned the most schooled
[1:14:21] the biggest the best the most why
[1:14:23] everybody was brought in and nobody
[1:14:25] could do it you know what the king said
[1:14:27] about this he said what good are you
[1:14:29] anyhow if you can't tell me this then
[1:14:31] i'll kill every one of you i'll destroy
[1:14:33] everything everything's gonna that's
[1:14:35] what he said he said i'm gonna kill you
[1:14:37] all but then daniel heard what was
[1:14:40] happening and said wait a minute amen
[1:14:42] now i hope y'all
[1:14:44] y'all can read into what i'm saying to
[1:14:45] you because in malachi 4 the bible said
[1:14:48] that unless elijah would come everything
[1:14:51] would be destroyed everything's going to
[1:14:53] be destroyed unless elijah would come
[1:14:56] amen because elijah would hold the
[1:14:58] revelation of what god had intended in
[1:15:02] the last days amen amen without god
[1:15:05] giving someone both the vision and the
[1:15:07] interpretation how would we know right
[1:15:10] amen but the scripture tells us that
[1:15:12] daniel stood in the gap for all of them
[1:15:14] amen for all the preachers for all the
[1:15:16] denial for everybody everybody lived
[1:15:19] because daniel stood in the gap for them
[1:15:22] all
[1:15:23] i hope you're hearing me amen i'm
[1:15:25] talking about a prophet standing in the
[1:15:27] gap for everybody amen the only reason
[1:15:29] there's any spiritual life left is
[1:15:32] because god sent the prophet he'll say
[1:15:34] well i don't believe in the prophet i
[1:15:35] don't believe in the prophet you got
[1:15:37] life anyhow whether you believe in it or
[1:15:39] not you're living off of the benefits of
[1:15:41] what god has gave to this age in malachi
[1:15:45] chapter four amen that everybody didn't
[1:15:47] perish because maybe they didn't like
[1:15:49] daniel maybe they didn't believe daniel
[1:15:50] but daniel gave him life anyhow
[1:15:53] because god gave wisdom unto daniel
[1:15:56] and he went to the king and he broke it
[1:15:58] down told the king exactly what he had
[1:16:00] dreamed can you imagine what that king
[1:16:02] you you you you from a foreign country
[1:16:05] you hey many he
[1:16:07] come on now everybody knew daniel was
[1:16:09] not of the of the normal bunch he he
[1:16:11] didn't come out of their schools or
[1:16:12] nothing but he but he told that dream
[1:16:15] exactly to the way that nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:18] had dreamed it and then he turned around
[1:16:20] and began to tell him the interpretation
[1:16:22] thereof
[1:16:23] he began to tell him the dream that
[1:16:26] you've had o king this is not just
[1:16:28] another nightmare this isn't just a
[1:16:30] little thing but this is detailing the
[1:16:33] kingdoms of the world that will rule
[1:16:36] during the time of the gentiles can you
[1:16:38] imagine that a king would have a dream
[1:16:41] amen and daniel he meant over 2500 years
[1:16:45] ago would tell the exact dates and times
[1:16:48] and how the entire world would be
[1:16:50] revolving and under which kingdoms would
[1:16:53] rule during those times
[1:16:55] my goodness to thank this man amen god
[1:16:58] was showing something to the king and
[1:17:00] daniel was there to interpret it now in
[1:17:03] according to scripture in daniel chapter
[1:17:05] 2 amen that they saw
[1:17:08] a great a great image now i'm going to
[1:17:10] give you an image here brother matt
[1:17:12] could you pull it up i'm going to give
[1:17:13] you an image here to save me a couple
[1:17:15] hours of preaching about the image i'm
[1:17:17] just going to show you a picture that's
[1:17:18] been drawn of this image and it kind of
[1:17:21] brings it a little bit to your
[1:17:23] perspective that's the best way to say
[1:17:24] it that nebuchadnezzar saw an image amen
[1:17:27] now the image that he saw
[1:17:29] is to the left there it's if you'll look
[1:17:31] at it when daniel begins to break this
[1:17:33] down in daniel 2 he says the head of
[1:17:35] gold is nebuchadnezzar which is the
[1:17:37] battle only empire now i have scriptures
[1:17:40] on every point i'm making here so if you
[1:17:42] need to ask a question do it later for
[1:17:44] me to do this it takes four and a half
[1:17:46] hours so i'm not gonna i'm just gonna
[1:17:47] quote it to you if you need the
[1:17:48] scripture come see me amen babylonian
[1:17:51] empire is that head
[1:17:52] the next amen was a see the changing
[1:17:55] from gold to silver is the median
[1:17:58] persian empire now it's going to go amen
[1:18:00] from a more valuable metal to a less
[1:18:04] valuable metal but it's going to go from
[1:18:06] a softer metal to a harder metal so this
[1:18:09] this image is going to devalue itself
[1:18:11] become harder all the time now watch
[1:18:14] this the babylonian empire amen then the
[1:18:16] median empire then the grecian empire
[1:18:19] then the roman empire and then the
[1:18:21] divided kingdoms now watch this because
[1:18:24] amen if you if you're if you'd like to
[1:18:26] study in the scripture this this
[1:18:27] nebuchadnezzar now watch this 605 to 539
[1:18:30] bc that's 600 years before christ amen
[1:18:33] the next one is ruling from 539 to 339
[1:18:37] to 331 539 i'm sorry to 331 and the next
[1:18:41] one is in 300 so you're talking about a
[1:18:43] man showing kingdoms 500 years before
[1:18:47] they begin
[1:18:48] daniel is telling nebuchadnezzar that's
[1:18:50] what his dream is meaning now this now
[1:18:52] this image is representing the rulership
[1:18:56] of the world from the time of daniel
[1:18:58] till the time you're setting right now
[1:19:00] now if you think god don't know who's
[1:19:03] going to be can control amen you you've
[1:19:06] missed the kind of god you serve if you
[1:19:08] think it's an accident that biden made
[1:19:10] it on that on that president's office
[1:19:12] i'm sorry i don't know how he got there
[1:19:14] cheating whatever happened but god knew
[1:19:16] he would be there and it's in the plans
[1:19:18] of god god listen friends amen god's not
[1:19:21] on zanac this morning wondering who's
[1:19:24] going to be the rulers god's not here
[1:19:26] this morning taking nerd pills trying to
[1:19:28] figure out all of this is going to come
[1:19:30] to pass god knew exactly who was going
[1:19:33] to rule and how they were going to rule
[1:19:35] listen i don't just have to tell you
[1:19:37] this amen history proves what i'm
[1:19:40] telling you is the truth if you study
[1:19:42] history that babylonian empire just a a
[1:19:45] little while after daniel prophesies
[1:19:47] this a handwriting comes on the wall and
[1:19:49] judgment falls on babylon and when
[1:19:52] judgment falls on babylon there's
[1:19:54] another kingdom called the medes and
[1:19:56] persians that are coming in you all know
[1:19:57] why their medes and persians came in
[1:19:59] into the time of daniel amen they came
[1:20:02] for israel's deliverance amen in other
[1:20:04] words when one kingdom was falling it
[1:20:07] was falling for another kingdom to come
[1:20:09] in people say to me all time brother
[1:20:11] wayne why is it important to preach
[1:20:13] things like this i'll tell you because
[1:20:14] this is where we get our hope now listen
[1:20:17] to me every time a kingdom is going to
[1:20:19] fall you're going to see a kingdom's
[1:20:21] going to follow this another kingdom is
[1:20:24] coming so so the end of one kingdom is
[1:20:26] the beginning of another kingdom are you
[1:20:29] hearing me amen and we are now at the
[1:20:32] end of the world amen the church of the
[1:20:35] living god there's another kingdom
[1:20:37] coming it's the kingdom of god we are
[1:20:41] not going to be left without a kingdom
[1:20:43] god's kingdom is coming upon this sir
[1:20:45] amen we are a part of that kingdom by
[1:20:48] the baptism of the holy ghost we have
[1:20:51] been brought into the ruling kingdom of
[1:20:53] the entire world
[1:20:55] my lord
[1:20:57] amen babylonian empire media persians
[1:21:00] greece rome amen now you can go right
[1:21:03] into your history book whoever heard of
[1:21:04] alexander the great
[1:21:06] his kingdom is prophesied by daniel
[1:21:09] hundreds of years before he's ever even
[1:21:10] born
[1:21:12] and when he comes now now there's a
[1:21:14] beautiful thing here watch this watch
[1:21:16] this king babylonian is the head of this
[1:21:19] of this image this image starts at the
[1:21:22] head
[1:21:23] and goes to the feet
[1:21:25] its heaviest part is in the head and it
[1:21:28] goes to the feet brother ram said which
[1:21:30] is a proof to the reader
[1:21:32] that this kingdom will never stand
[1:21:35] this gentile kingdoms will never stand
[1:21:38] because it started at the top and came
[1:21:40] to the bottom but when you go to the
[1:21:43] stature of the perfect man and when
[1:21:45] christ begins to build his church he
[1:21:48] starts at the bottom and goes to the top
[1:21:51] listen church we are not going backwards
[1:21:54] the church is not going down but we are
[1:21:57] rising up in the power of the holy ghost
[1:22:01] we are not going back to the ages we are
[1:22:04] going in a rat
[1:22:06] the church of the living god will be
[1:22:07] changed
[1:22:12] higher and higher she'll never fall i
[1:22:15] prophesy until you as a kingdom it
[1:22:18] cannot fall as a bride that cannot fall
[1:22:21] she's been set upon a rock where she
[1:22:23] cannot fall every kingdom is going to
[1:22:26] fall but the pride of jesus christ will
[1:22:29] stand in the middle of it all because
[1:22:32] it's been prophesied
[1:22:38] hallelujah
[1:22:40] people tell me all the time so brother
[1:22:41] wayne i'll just stick with the bible i
[1:22:43] don't know if i can believe y'all's
[1:22:44] message well let's stick with the bible
[1:22:45] a few minutes
[1:22:46] and see if this message is in this bible
[1:22:50] now what you're watching on the left
[1:22:52] side is you're watching nebuchadnezzar's
[1:22:54] dream in daniel 2
[1:22:56] interpreted by daniel
[1:22:58] what you're looking at the right side
[1:23:00] is daniel the seventh chapter when
[1:23:03] daniel sees the same exact thing
[1:23:06] but he sees him as beast
[1:23:08] sometimes you're reading the bible and
[1:23:10] you read two different three different
[1:23:12] chapters and you think what's it talking
[1:23:14] about do you imagine daniel 2
[1:23:16] and daniel 7 are talking about the same
[1:23:19] thing but when you're reading daniel 2
[1:23:21] you're reading about an image
[1:23:23] when you're reading daniel 7
[1:23:25] you're reading about beast
[1:23:28] and you go on daniel 7 it's pretty scary
[1:23:30] to read about it it talks about lines
[1:23:31] with wings and amen talks about this
[1:23:34] this goat with all these horns and
[1:23:36] it starts getting into these beasts
[1:23:38] they're in these powers what are they
[1:23:39] they are rulers of the world the same as
[1:23:43] four kingdoms so is there four different
[1:23:46] beasts that represents those kingdoms
[1:23:49] now y'all see then daniel saw
[1:23:52] envision
[1:23:53] what john would see in the book of
[1:23:55] revelations the 13th chapter when you go
[1:23:58] to revelation 13 you can pull up the
[1:24:00] first verse there revelation 13 and
[1:24:02] verse 1 you will read that john in the
[1:24:04] book of revelations sees the exact thing
[1:24:08] they saw but when he sees it he sees it
[1:24:11] as
[1:24:12] one kingdom
[1:24:14] john doesn't see four different things
[1:24:16] he describes in revelation 13 and 1 he
[1:24:19] describes these four powers and i stood
[1:24:21] upon the sea and saw a beast ride us out
[1:24:24] of the sea having seven heads and ten
[1:24:25] horns and upon his head was ten crowns
[1:24:28] and upon his head was the name of
[1:24:29] blasphemy go to the next verse the
[1:24:31] second verse amen and he said in the
[1:24:33] beast which i saw was like it unto a
[1:24:34] leopard and his feet were the feet of a
[1:24:36] bear in his mouth the mouth of a lion
[1:24:38] and the dragon gave him power and his
[1:24:40] seat in great authority john is
[1:24:42] describing daniel 7 but he don't see
[1:24:45] four different kingdoms he sees one
[1:24:47] kingdom he said preacher what does that
[1:24:49] mean that means every power that daniel
[1:24:51] saw has now come into one kingdom it is
[1:24:55] the roman kingdom according to scripture
[1:24:58] the last kingdom to rule the world would
[1:25:00] be wrong now now that's a mystery
[1:25:03] according to the bible it was a mystery
[1:25:05] but the mystery has now been revealed
[1:25:07] and rome is now ruling the world you
[1:25:09] think the democrats are oh no rome is
[1:25:12] doing it you think the muslims are oh no
[1:25:15] rome is ruling rome is ruling the world
[1:25:18] today people say well brother wayne how
[1:25:20] in the world can you say wrong there's
[1:25:21] ruling america and china and russia how
[1:25:24] is he ruling iran and iran how's he
[1:25:26] doing it all at the same time well
[1:25:28] that's the mystery isn't it when you
[1:25:30] watch these scriptures you see how the
[1:25:32] median persians gave way to the grecians
[1:25:34] but then when the grecians gave way to
[1:25:36] wrong about three about 40 years before
[1:25:38] 60 years before christ it gave way to
[1:25:41] rome and rome come in who was rome in
[1:25:44] italy now you're all familiar with that
[1:25:46] and that it was a city a country in
[1:25:48] italy and that country overcame the
[1:25:51] world rome ruled the world which would
[1:25:53] be what we think about europe right but
[1:25:55] the scriptures detail to us amen in
[1:25:58] revelation 13
[1:26:00] and the third verse that that roman
[1:26:03] empire
[1:26:04] suffered a wound and looked like it died
[1:26:08] now if you're if you're studying history
[1:26:10] you'll see it in europe you'll see rome
[1:26:12] was ruling the world well until they
[1:26:14] started capturing all these little
[1:26:16] countries and you have these kings
[1:26:18] rising up that didn't want to submit to
[1:26:19] rome so when they begin to have their
[1:26:21] own little empires within rome and rome
[1:26:23] saw what was happening so they divided
[1:26:26] the kingdom into an eastern and western
[1:26:28] kingdom to try to keep rule over them
[1:26:31] amen but it was failing bitterly and
[1:26:34] rome was losing power until a man named
[1:26:37] constantine rose up and he took and said
[1:26:40] i know how to rule i'll do it through
[1:26:42] christianity and he picked up a cross
[1:26:46] and pulled together all of those
[1:26:48] countries and they fought for
[1:26:50] christianity and the bible tells us that
[1:26:53] pagan rome was revived and became papa
[1:26:56] rome which is now the roman catholic
[1:27:00] church amen and it is ruling the entire
[1:27:03] world now you say preacher how in the
[1:27:05] world can rome rule the entire world
[1:27:08] well the bible said amen that the last
[1:27:10] kingdom that ruled would be both of iron
[1:27:13] and clay and if you watch that image
[1:27:15] when it come to the last kingdom watch
[1:27:17] it had two legs and one of them was
[1:27:20] eastern rome the other one was western
[1:27:22] wrong is that right and on those legs it
[1:27:25] had ten toes on their feet
[1:27:27] those ten toes represented ten kingdoms
[1:27:30] amen that would be in the world in the
[1:27:33] time of this last image now now i want
[1:27:36] you to see something amen america don't
[1:27:38] have a lot of influence in in russia
[1:27:41] russia don't have a lot of influence in
[1:27:43] america but the pope has influence in
[1:27:45] both
[1:27:47] people say to me all the time they say
[1:27:49] well how do you believe rome rules the
[1:27:50] world amen because the iron of rome runs
[1:27:54] into every government in nations listen
[1:27:57] to me today people say all the time well
[1:27:59] it's the protestant churches that have
[1:28:01] america well let me say something very
[1:28:02] clearly to you my bible says in the last
[1:28:05] day that they will form an image unto
[1:28:08] the beast
[1:28:09] now the beast itself is rome and the
[1:28:12] image unto the beasts of protestant
[1:28:14] denominations and have denominated
[1:28:17] themselves on the word of god listen to
[1:28:19] me i don't care what name you call it
[1:28:21] when a man sets up a denomination he has
[1:28:25] ruled jesus christ out and he's put
[1:28:27] himself in we are not following a man do
[1:28:30] you hear me we are not following a man
[1:28:32] people say all the time we all follow
[1:28:34] that man william branham amen listen
[1:28:36] william branham was a prophet but he had
[1:28:38] a light that was over his head and that
[1:28:41] light was jesus christ the pride is not
[1:28:44] following the man they are following the
[1:28:47] light even they're following the angel
[1:28:50] of the lord that was upon his head he
[1:28:52] would say to me well y'all follow after
[1:28:54] man well let me let me just put it out
[1:28:56] there let me help you amen amen what
[1:28:58] baptist church do you go to
[1:29:01] come on now
[1:29:02] remember when we don't follow a man what
[1:29:04] baptist church do you go to and then
[1:29:06] tell me who's the order of that church
[1:29:08] and who makes the rules of that church
[1:29:10] come on they said well we only we only
[1:29:11] say what the bible said really why are
[1:29:13] you baptizing the titles of father son
[1:29:15] holy ghost
[1:29:16] because the bible said you should repent
[1:29:18] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:29:20] if the bible was your only leader you
[1:29:23] were baptized the way paul baptized you
[1:29:26] baptized the way peter baptized why is
[1:29:28] your women cutting their hair in the
[1:29:30] denominations if it's the bible we're
[1:29:32] believing first corinthians 11 chapter
[1:29:35] said you shouldn't even pray if a woman
[1:29:37] cuts her hair she ought to repent unto
[1:29:39] god if she's gonna ah now if we're gonna
[1:29:42] follow the bible he said that a woman a
[1:29:45] man that would dress herself like a man
[1:29:47] is an abomination unto
[1:29:50] god you know why people are doing it
[1:29:53] because they're not following the bible
[1:29:54] they're following a man
[1:29:58] and that man has led them out of the
[1:30:00] scripture
[1:30:01] into his own kingdom
[1:30:03] and the only king that rules in the last
[1:30:05] day is rome amen listen to me rome has
[1:30:08] two churches
[1:30:10] protestant and catholic
[1:30:14] can i help y'all amen the devil has two
[1:30:17] political systems
[1:30:18] democratic and republican
[1:30:24] well i'll tell you i'm a republican
[1:30:26] listen i am a christian
[1:30:28] and my kingdom is not republican my
[1:30:31] kingdom is not democratic that is only
[1:30:34] here to divide you and to divide your
[1:30:36] homes and divide this country if this
[1:30:39] country will get under the word of god
[1:30:43] we can be one unit we can be one party
[1:30:48] the devil's got two it's protestant and
[1:30:51] catholic amen it's democratic and
[1:30:53] republican
[1:30:55] now i'm gonna i'm gonna get real
[1:30:57] straight with you for a moment we've had
[1:30:58] a prophet and he said you watch those
[1:31:01] three curtains there's an iron curtain
[1:31:03] he said there's a a a
[1:31:05] bamboo curtain
[1:31:07] russia and china he said but there's a
[1:31:09] purple curtain and that's the one you
[1:31:12] better watch
[1:31:13] and we have got our eyes on that bamboo
[1:31:15] curtain over there our biggest
[1:31:18] conservative fox news station china
[1:31:20] china china russia russia russia and
[1:31:24] they're showing mass in the middle of
[1:31:26] covet putting mass on fox news and we're
[1:31:30] elevating them as a conservative voice
[1:31:32] isn't it horrible when the nation falls
[1:31:35] so low that a is her conservative
[1:31:38] voice
[1:31:40] the bible said the roman churches are
[1:31:43] and the protestant denomination is
[1:31:46] a dollar under the same system i said
[1:31:49] what makes it a i tell you what
[1:31:51] makes it a they've taken the seed
[1:31:53] of man instead of the seed of god god is
[1:31:56] his word god is this bible and anything
[1:31:59] outside this bible is something death
[1:32:04] that's the truth
[1:32:09] said preacher why are you preaching like
[1:32:10] this because you got your eyes on the
[1:32:12] wrong curtain
[1:32:14] you're looking at a bamboo curtain

[1:32:28] now whether or not brother bran's vision
[1:32:29] about a woman dressed in purple was an
[1:32:32] actual woman or the catholic church can
[1:32:34] i shock you it's both
[1:32:38] a woman represents a church
[1:32:41] and at the same time
[1:32:44] a woman standing in purple is anointed
[1:32:46] as your vice president in america at the
[1:32:49] same time a roman catholic president
[1:32:52] sits in the office amen let me get
[1:32:54] deeper than that you've got nine
[1:32:56] justices on the supreme court
[1:32:58] seven of them are roman catholics and
[1:33:01] people applauded them to get in that
[1:33:03] office

[1:33:06] was under attack who was you pulling for
[1:33:08] amen when when that guy was getting all
[1:33:10] them taxes he had the whole christian
[1:33:12] world pulling for him to get in that

[1:33:16] done to the protestants when we run from
[1:33:19] europe you know what they've done to us
[1:33:21] they destroyed everything that wouldn't
[1:33:24] bow to them and now they're back in
[1:33:27] power again they're not exercising the
[1:33:29] power yet but you wait
[1:33:34] you say preacher
[1:33:37] you've lost your mind oh no i'm writing

[1:33:57] supreme court
[1:34:00] is there a higher office than a
[1:34:01] president
[1:34:03] do you think they quit being catholic
[1:34:05] when they took them places
[1:34:08] no
[1:34:09] and when it comes to it they are still
[1:34:11] going to be catholic
[1:34:13] nothing against the person
[1:34:15] it's what the bible said would happen
[1:34:19] we're not saying that to throw away on
[1:34:21] miss amy or gorbachev whatever their
[1:34:23] names are that has nothing to do with it
[1:34:25] i just showed you a picture that said
[1:34:28] that rome would rule plum to the toes of
[1:34:31] the image in the last day and here it is
[1:34:34] exactly what the bible said
[1:34:36] oh my brother's the church of the living
[1:34:39] god we are not blind to what's happening
[1:34:41] we see what's happening that's why we
[1:34:44] are following a message
[1:34:46] [Applause]

[1:34:50] this
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:52] on the bottom of them feet ten toes
[1:34:54] isn't there five five toes on each side
[1:34:57] brother braham said so every foot has a
[1:34:59] big toe
[1:35:01] that's the most extended part
[1:35:04] amen and them big toes it was on that
[1:35:06] image how many knows what their names
[1:35:07] were
[1:35:09] amen eisenhower and gorbachev
[1:35:13] the owner of the 1960s the eastern world
[1:35:15] met with the western world and they had
[1:35:17] a conference
[1:35:19] amen and khrushchev amen men our
[1:35:22] eisenhower men iron and kuchov meant
[1:35:24] clay
[1:35:25] the very two things that we're going to
[1:35:26] run into this image met in the east and
[1:35:28] west together and while they were
[1:35:30] meeting khrushchev got mad and pulled
[1:35:34] off his shoe
[1:35:36] listen to me amen you go on google go
[1:35:39] google this i mean it's all over the
[1:35:41] google that khrushchev a russian amen a
[1:35:44] russian prime minister pulls off his
[1:35:47] shoe and beats it on the desk now come
[1:35:50] on now whenever you ever hear about
[1:35:51] somebody taking their shoe and beating
[1:35:53] the desk in a political meeting why
[1:35:55] didn't he beat his hand
[1:35:57] why didn't he beat his head why did he
[1:35:58] take his book and throw it in the floor
[1:36:00] why didn't he kick some staff member he
[1:36:02] took off his shoe
[1:36:05] amen because he was representing the
[1:36:07] feet
[1:36:09] of the eastern kingdoms that was given
[1:36:11] there listen that big toe had a name now
[1:36:14] i saw you see it as a big toe but it was
[1:36:16] a symbol for a system and that system
[1:36:19] was being headed up by a man called
[1:36:22] khrushchev now now you say preacher amen
[1:36:24] what's this got to do with anything
[1:36:25] because i want you to see something if
[1:36:27] the kingdoms of the world can be
[1:36:30] represented by men amen then the same
[1:36:33] principle must apply to the other
[1:36:36] side oh my you say where are you in the
[1:36:39] world we're in the big toes in the 1960s
[1:36:43] the big toes amen was named by a prophet
[1:36:46] had he not named them we wouldn't have
[1:36:48] knew their name we wouldn't have
[1:36:49] realized amen that the toes had been
[1:36:52] exposed the shoe had been taken off the
[1:36:55] name had been called now we know where
[1:36:58] they're at oh god church church of the
[1:37:01] living god amen listen if if you if you
[1:37:04] like to read your bible in daniel the
[1:37:06] second chapter it says when the time of
[1:37:08] these tolls brother brahm said in the
[1:37:10] time of these kings he said there was
[1:37:12] something else that took place at the
[1:37:14] same time how many knows what took place
[1:37:17] if you keep watching now you come to the
[1:37:20] end of the gentile kingdoms but daniel
[1:37:23] kept watching until there was a stone
[1:37:25] that was hewed out of the mountain come
[1:37:28] rolling down into babylon
[1:37:33] if them big toes were represented by
[1:37:36] khrushchev and eisenhower what's that
[1:37:38] stone represented by come on church
[1:37:41] there's a prophet coming into the
[1:37:43] nations
[1:37:44] there's a prophet coming in the nation
[1:37:50] glory to god i'll show it to you in the
[1:37:52] bible if you want to see it that prophet
[1:37:54] is representing another kingdom
[1:37:56] people say to me all time so y'all y'all
[1:37:58] load heavy upon a prophet now you got to
[1:38:00] keep your bible handy because amos the
[1:38:02] third chapter said that god would do
[1:38:04] nothing until he sends a prophet so
[1:38:06] you're telling me we're at the end of
[1:38:08] every world system and god's going to
[1:38:11] let it surprise the church are you
[1:38:13] saying that the entire world is about to
[1:38:15] fall apart and god wouldn't send a
[1:38:17] prophet when god was moving israel he
[1:38:20] sent a prophet when god was bringing the
[1:38:22] message he sent a prophet how about when
[1:38:25] the whole world is coming to an end god
[1:38:28] is going to send the prophet
[1:38:31] and i thank god this morning to know
[1:38:34] that prophet is not coming we now have
[1:38:37] the message of the hour the rock has
[1:38:40] been represented the kingdom of god has
[1:38:43] been brought
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:49] he said brother wayne you you're getting
[1:38:51] awful heavy listen let's let's stay with
[1:38:53] it just a minute and see if we're not at
[1:38:55] the end of all things what does a
[1:38:57] prophet mean a prophet means the end of
[1:39:00] one thing in the beginning of another
[1:39:02] he's announcing the end of world systems
[1:39:06] i might as well take a bite out of it i
[1:39:08] know everybody went around saying
[1:39:09] brother bran prophesied in 1977 the
[1:39:11] world would end well he really didn't do
[1:39:14] that people that read what he said did
[1:39:15] that because he said i predict and do
[1:39:18] not prophesy that the world will end in
[1:39:20] 1977. he said now watch i've heard it
[1:39:23] preached they said he said it by by
[1:39:25] divine inspiration
[1:39:27] amen and
[1:39:29] and he said by a private student and
[1:39:31] divine inspiration listen he was not
[1:39:33] saying by divine inspiration 1977 would
[1:39:36] be the end that divine inspiration was
[1:39:38] seven visions he had had and those seven
[1:39:41] visions were exactly the word but here
[1:39:44] by looking at the seven visions he was
[1:39:46] saying i don't know how it could go past
[1:39:49] 1977.
[1:39:53] but the world systems did come to an end
[1:39:58] you say preacher world systems are to an
[1:40:00] end do you know what it says in the
[1:40:01] church book that the denominational ages
[1:40:04] ended with this message how many knows
[1:40:06] to break the breach brother brahm said
[1:40:07] it very clearly he said the book cannot
[1:40:09] be opened till the denominational agents
[1:40:11] have played out in other words until
[1:40:13] every denomination has had their say the
[1:40:16] baptist has had their say presbyterians
[1:40:18] have had their say but now god is going
[1:40:21] to speak
[1:40:22] concerning the word in the last days
[1:40:25] amen actually actually a good buddy of
[1:40:28] mine brother tim pruitt preached a
[1:40:29] message entitled the ending of world
[1:40:31] systems done it up in canada i can't get
[1:40:33] the recording but we've talked a bit on
[1:40:35] it i thought it's pretty amazing go
[1:40:36] study it sometime the end of world
[1:40:38] systems amen they end with a message
[1:40:42] they end with a rock striking the trolls
[1:40:45] now if you if you if you enjoy bible
[1:40:48] prophecy how many enjoys bible prophecy
[1:40:50] amen you can see then amen that this
[1:40:52] rock that we're talking about must be an
[1:40:54] important part
[1:40:56] it must be an important thing to the
[1:40:57] church now in the 70th week of daniel
[1:41:00] brother man is going to tell us
[1:41:01] something now when the prophet says
[1:41:03] don't miss this don't miss this
[1:41:06] he comes to a part paragraph 133 he said
[1:41:09] listen now don't miss this
[1:41:12] the church age has come from the
[1:41:13] beginning of reformation luther and the
[1:41:16] times where the foundation stone was
[1:41:17] laid which was the doctrine of the
[1:41:19] apostles amen don't miss this he's going
[1:41:23] to talk about the rock and immediately
[1:41:25] he's talking about the church ages
[1:41:27] now what does the church ages have to do
[1:41:29] with that stone
[1:41:31] i think it's a good question isn't it
[1:41:33] but brother branham tells us this he
[1:41:35] says listen he said wesley lived out his
[1:41:37] age and they come into the pentecostal
[1:41:39] age with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:41] is shaping up
[1:41:42] remember the headstone wasn't on it yet
[1:41:46] they shaped the church exactly like the
[1:41:48] pyramid to fit their headstone but the
[1:41:50] headstone never did come
[1:41:53] look what he's saying the headstone
[1:41:54] never come in the church agent it never
[1:41:56] made it that far it was growing up but
[1:41:59] not that far then he says to this later
[1:42:01] in the same paragraph he said they
[1:42:03] rejected that stone that pyramid they
[1:42:05] cut it out of the mountain without hands
[1:42:06] and do you see it the rejected one the
[1:42:08] rejected stone is the headstone the
[1:42:11] capstone
[1:42:12] and the very one they rejected through
[1:42:14] the gentile ages christ and christ was
[1:42:17] not cut and put here as a viker or son
[1:42:20] of god or some dignitary in the church
[1:42:23] he's the holy spirit
[1:42:28] the cap of the pyramid will be christ's
[1:42:30] coming
[1:42:31] now watch this we we we i think this
[1:42:34] should be a foregone conclusion in the
[1:42:36] church by now we believe in a corporal
[1:42:38] body of jesus
[1:42:39] we all on the same point aren't we we
[1:42:41] believe in a corporal body one day this
[1:42:43] bride will be translated to meet that
[1:42:45] body let's get this out of the way so
[1:42:47] you can understand
[1:42:49] amen that body will not actually be seen
[1:42:52] in this dimension until the millennium
[1:42:55] but something has to take you to that
[1:42:57] body
[1:42:59] something carries you there so when he
[1:43:01] speaks of headship or he speaks of the
[1:43:03] ministry of christ today he's not
[1:43:06] speaking of the corporal body because if
[1:43:08] the corporal body was here that would be
[1:43:10] the end of everything would be no more
[1:43:12] preaching there would be no more
[1:43:13] salvation
[1:43:15] right so he's talking about the ministry
[1:43:18] of christ as the son of man in the
[1:43:20] church now it's been shaped up like a
[1:43:22] pyramid and daniel said he watched the
[1:43:24] gentile until the stone come out of the
[1:43:27] mountain he had never put a capstone on
[1:43:29] the pyramid yet watch this now he said
[1:43:32] what happened at that time later in the
[1:43:34] paragraph it was the coming of that
[1:43:36] stone it went to the church in glory at
[1:43:38] the rapture so at the time of the
[1:43:40] rapture this stone is to appear in the
[1:43:43] church of the living god we got another
[1:43:45] picture here of a pyramid can you bring
[1:43:47] this up now i'm going to show you
[1:43:49] another picture to save me a bunch of
[1:43:50] talking amen now right here is a picture
[1:43:53] of another statue this is the statue
[1:43:56] that ii peter describes that brother
[1:43:58] branham preaches a message the statue of
[1:44:00] the perfect man and represents the
[1:44:02] church ages of the gentile as a statue
[1:44:05] of the people so to be like jesus he's
[1:44:08] sitting saying have a beard long hair
[1:44:10] and roll a robe and ma no he was talking
[1:44:12] about the nature that was in christ
[1:44:14] which is described as faith and virtue
[1:44:16] and knowledge and temperance of patience
[1:44:18] and godless brotherly kindness now the
[1:44:20] thing you've got to remember is not one
[1:44:22] time in the bible does it say god is
[1:44:24] faith or god is virtue or goddess
[1:44:26] knowledge or god is temperance it don't
[1:44:28] say that temperance comes from god
[1:44:30] knowledge comes from god but god is not
[1:44:33] that amen but when it comes to love
[1:44:36] john says god is love
[1:44:40] then what you're watching then is the
[1:44:42] building up of a church unto the place
[1:44:45] of christ himself coming into the church
[1:44:48] how many knows this is token age brother
[1:44:51] random represented that as the token of
[1:44:53] the church or the true baptism of the
[1:44:56] holy ghost not azusa but the christ
[1:45:00] himself that was to come into the church
[1:45:02] in the last days now i don't want to
[1:45:04] lose you here i want to show you that
[1:45:06] that that pyramid that cap upon the top
[1:45:10] is the headstone or the stone of grace
[1:45:13] that was coming to the church on the
[1:45:14] last day do y'all see there's a gap
[1:45:17] between them two amen somebody had to
[1:45:19] get that gap
[1:45:20] somebody had to make the gap somebody
[1:45:23] had to stand between the living and the
[1:45:25] dead
[1:45:26] somebody had to pull together christ and
[1:45:30] his church
[1:45:31] somebody had to take the feminine and
[1:45:34] the male and put them together in a
[1:45:36] marriage no church could do it no
[1:45:39] denomination could do it nobody could
[1:45:42] count the bride amen but there had to be
[1:45:45] a prophet to introduce christ to the age
[1:45:48] that we're living in he stood in that
[1:45:50] gap and brought that headstone amen
[1:45:53] which is the holy ghost now now and now
[1:45:56] we're not we're not a gazillion miles
[1:45:58] out here because if you go back to the
[1:46:00] book of daniel
[1:46:01] you'll see when daniel's people were
[1:46:03] released from babylon
[1:46:05] they went back to jerusalem
[1:46:07] after 70 years
[1:46:09] you know what they went back for
[1:46:11] for restored worship
[1:46:12] they went back to their homeland where
[1:46:14] they were going to build a temple come
[1:46:16] on church i'm talking to you they were
[1:46:18] going to build a church they were going
[1:46:20] to be able to temple and this temple was
[1:46:22] going to have someone who could design
[1:46:24] it to be just like the original temple
[1:46:28] people had been gone 70 years there was
[1:46:30] no stones left there was no but there
[1:46:32] was nothing on the ground that could
[1:46:34] detail what a church or to look like but
[1:46:37] god according to the bible prophesied
[1:46:40] that jerubal a prince among them would
[1:46:43] bring them back to a restored church
[1:46:46] oh god
[1:46:48] now that's zerubbabel amen according to
[1:46:51] the bible is a man who was in the book
[1:46:53] of zechariah now now you may wonder
[1:46:56] brother by the way what does this have
[1:46:57] to do with your sermon dedicated to a
[1:46:59] message well zerubbabel in the bible was
[1:47:02] a man who was going to lead them into a
[1:47:05] complete building of a church or of a
[1:47:08] temple to restore the order of the
[1:47:09] worship now that seems like that would
[1:47:11] be
[1:47:12] hundreds and thousands of years removed
[1:47:14] from where we're sitting now
[1:47:16] but in a message of grace in 1960
[1:47:19] william branham comes along
[1:47:21] and takes this as a text in zechariah 4
[1:47:25] and he says that the lord he said we'll
[1:47:28] do this
[1:47:29] not by might
[1:47:31] not my power
[1:47:32] but by my
[1:47:34] spirit saith the lord
[1:47:36] he promised that his spirit would
[1:47:38] rebuild the church to its original
[1:47:41] condition and the spirit that was there
[1:47:43] would stir up a man named jerubal and
[1:47:46] make him rebuild that tabernacle or that
[1:47:49] temple now notice here in the message of
[1:47:51] grace in 1961 brother graham said
[1:47:53] there's a removable has laid it and he
[1:47:55] said i want you to notice this saints
[1:47:57] are uber will put on the headstone
[1:48:00] not a corner a head
[1:48:02] now you will put on a headstone now
[1:48:04] notice because this messenger
[1:48:07] zerubbabel in the old testament is only
[1:48:10] representing the seventh church-aged
[1:48:13] messenger who would come according to
[1:48:16] revelations three and who would restore
[1:48:18] the order of the church back to its
[1:48:20] original worship and what god intended
[1:48:23] it for it to be now i want you to hear
[1:48:26] me i want you to catch what i'm saying
[1:48:28] to you because he was going to bring
[1:48:31] forth a headstone do you know what
[1:48:33] zerubbabel was going to say when he
[1:48:35] brought that headstone when that
[1:48:37] headstone was to be put on the church
[1:48:40] you know what he was going to say as the
[1:48:42] head started sitting on the church he
[1:48:44] was going to cry grace
[1:48:47] grace
[1:48:49] come on
[1:48:50] come on church you had a place at the
[1:48:53] table
[1:48:54] you had a seat of grace but somebody had
[1:48:57] to come and find you
[1:49:01] something came looking for you it was a
[1:49:04] message
[1:49:06] where would you be if the message hadn't
[1:49:08] come where would you be this morning if
[1:49:10] this message hadn't come to your life
[1:49:13] and i can say to you this morning grace
[1:49:15] grace grace unto the headstone of god
[1:49:22] what's he going to do he's going to come
[1:49:23] crying grace grace under this headstone
[1:49:26] look what he's doing he's bringing forth
[1:49:29] a ministry of jesus christ he's bringing
[1:49:32] the headstone to the church now if
[1:49:35] you're uh i'll take just a moment to
[1:49:37] take it here being with this this far
[1:49:38] are you all okay
[1:49:40] everybody okay and now i want you to see
[1:49:42] something zerubbabel was to bring the
[1:49:45] headstone we agree with that
[1:49:47] zerubbabel now our day is a man named
[1:49:50] william branham
[1:49:53] william branham is not the headstone
[1:49:57] william branham is aruba paul and he's
[1:50:00] bringing the headstone
[1:50:03] come on val
[1:50:04] if you'd like to read your bible
[1:50:06] zerubbabel was with a man named joshua
[1:50:09] when they built that temple
[1:50:11] you know what joshua is jehovah savior
[1:50:14] come on amen it's jesus which was
[1:50:17] derivable in there in the bible in the
[1:50:20] bible there were two distinct men you
[1:50:22] could see them the rebel and jesus it's
[1:50:24] a rebel and a man named joshua you could
[1:50:26] see them building two men building but
[1:50:29] in the last days the prophecy is that
[1:50:32] jesus will return as a spirit and that
[1:50:35] spirit will be in this church
[1:50:38] come on i'm on prophecy you know i am a
[1:50:40] little while the world see me no more
[1:50:42] but you shall see me for i will be with
[1:50:44] you
[1:50:46] even in you until the end of the age so
[1:50:49] people see this man william branham
[1:50:51] doing the works of god doing the works
[1:50:53] of christ and they look and say who is
[1:50:56] it he says it's not me i'm the cerumable
[1:50:59] but there's another one on the inside
[1:51:02] and he is doing the works
[1:51:08] come on church the church ain't finished
[1:51:11] until christ comes into the body
[1:51:16] you're not finished till the holy ghost
[1:51:18] comes on the stone
[1:51:23] what's this preacher doing he's
[1:51:24] finishing things
[1:51:27] he's restoring the order
[1:51:29] if you like to go to the to the book of
[1:51:31] revelations the fifth chapter there's a
[1:51:33] ministry in the fifth chapter of the
[1:51:35] book of revelations
[1:51:36] everything's lost john's crying remember
[1:51:38] malachi 4 everything's lost remember
[1:51:40] daniel 2 everything's dying unless
[1:51:43] somebody can tell us what this means
[1:51:45] in revelations 5 john is weeping because
[1:51:47] nobody is worthy to open this book
[1:51:50] but there's one in the middle of
[1:51:52] revelations 5
[1:51:53] that stops john's weeping who's john
[1:51:56] come on now who's john
[1:51:59] don't weep john
[1:52:01] there is one
[1:52:03] there is one that has prevailed to take
[1:52:06] the book john don't weep john oh god
[1:52:10] there's somebody that can open this or
[1:52:12] somebody that can bring the word of god
[1:52:16] now
[1:52:17] so the world reads this and they look
[1:52:19] for jesus
[1:52:20] to come walking out to a platform
[1:52:24] and just start preaching to them because
[1:52:26] then they'll know it's the lord speaking
[1:52:27] right
[1:52:29] but scripture blocks him from doing it
[1:52:33] it said god will not do that unless he
[1:52:35] speaks through
[1:52:36] a prophet
[1:52:38] now if you go to the breach in 1963 man
[1:52:40] he's standing in that gap
[1:52:42] that breach is a prophet
[1:52:44] and he's standing between the unseen
[1:52:46] realm and the singing realm
[1:52:48] and he's bringing something to the
[1:52:50] people that they have not understood
[1:52:53] prior to this time
[1:52:54] he has literally watched what's
[1:52:56] happening he's inviting the one that's
[1:52:59] worthy to come and open the lamb's book
[1:53:03] of life that's been healed from the
[1:53:06] foundations of the world he is asking
[1:53:09] him to bring forth the title deed
[1:53:12] redemption unto the entire earth listen
[1:53:15] we're about to have a millennium
[1:53:19] the church is about to rule the earth
[1:53:22] but before they can rule the earth the
[1:53:25] names of the rulers have to be revealed
[1:53:27] from the beginning before the foundation
[1:53:30] of the world
[1:53:33] now when the prophet comes forth the
[1:53:34] bible st the prophet tell i love i love
[1:53:37] listening to the breach i'd love to hear
[1:53:38] it i can kind of take you can i just
[1:53:40] preach to you man i'll take you to the
[1:53:42] breach brother is preaching along i'm
[1:53:44] listening i love to listen and i'm
[1:53:46] sitting here listening and brother
[1:53:47] brahma is talking about this angel and
[1:53:49] this elder and how he's talking and the
[1:53:51] book of being open he said then then
[1:53:53] they begin to sing hallelujah and praise
[1:53:55] me to god now if you go listen to the
[1:53:57] tape at the same time brother braham
[1:53:58] says this the church he's preaching to
[1:54:02] breaks out
[1:54:03] in hallelujahs and pray about shouting
[1:54:05] down actually
[1:54:07] just like the scripture
[1:54:09] it's literally happening
[1:54:11] look the one standing in the platform
[1:54:12] brother brown says something that'll
[1:54:14] it'll just amaze you
[1:54:15] he said now let him that's worthy come
[1:54:18] forward now
[1:54:20] or forever hold his peace so what he's
[1:54:22] doing is he's bringing forth the one
[1:54:25] that can open that book amen that can
[1:54:27] reveal what's inside those seals now now
[1:54:30] you may not see the importance in this
[1:54:33] but i want you to catch the importance
[1:54:35] of this because if you can see the
[1:54:37] source of what you're believing you can
[1:54:40] see the amount of authority it's going
[1:54:42] to have
[1:54:46] what's the authority of this word you're
[1:54:47] speaking goes clean to the throne of god
[1:54:51] now watch what he does because when he
[1:54:52] does he invites one to come now the
[1:54:55] prophet is going to declare amen he is
[1:54:57] here again he's going to say that my
[1:55:00] ministry is to declare that he is here
[1:55:06] now that's pretty powerful stuff to me
[1:55:08] as an individual he's declaring that he
[1:55:10] is here but the man will declare it
[1:55:12] again he'll say headship
[1:55:15] is here
[1:55:17] the head of the body is on the earth
[1:55:20] who's the head of this body
[1:55:23] it's christ
[1:55:25] now
[1:55:26] i know there's been a lot of things
[1:55:27] preached through the years but let's
[1:55:29] take scripture
[1:55:31] paul said jesus is the head of the body
[1:55:37] but every woman
[1:55:39] is the head of her
[1:55:41] every man is the head of a husband and
[1:55:44] christ is the head of every man
[1:55:48] i'm not going deeper in that that's
[1:55:50] enough
[1:55:52] plain is that plain
[1:55:54] who's the head then
[1:55:57] christ and who's introducing that
[1:56:00] headship
[1:56:01] a prophet
[1:56:03] so he's elevating christ above your
[1:56:06] teaching
[1:56:07] above your church's teaching
[1:56:09] above the pope is teaching he's
[1:56:11] elevating this bible above every teacher
[1:56:14] in the world
[1:56:16] what's he doing he's ending their
[1:56:18] teachings he's ending their doctrines
[1:56:21] he's settling the matter you won't
[1:56:23] wonder about predestination anymore you
[1:56:25] won't wonder about baptism anymore
[1:56:28] what's he doing the axe is being laid to
[1:56:30] the root of the tree
[1:56:33] now zechariah 4 amen if you pull this up
[1:56:36] zechariah 4 the scripture tells us amen
[1:56:39] that this is amen what zerubbabel has
[1:56:42] said i'll show you in the bible
[1:56:42] zechariah 4 and 6 he said he answered
[1:56:45] and spake unto me said this is the word
[1:56:46] of lord under zerubbabel saying not by
[1:56:49] might not by power but by
[1:56:52] my spirit
[1:56:54] by can you say it with me my spirit
[1:56:59] okay so the capstone's going to be what
[1:57:02] by
[1:57:03] my spirit well by the way we're looking
[1:57:06] for the corporal body to come on the
[1:57:07] church so we can have a
[1:57:09] by
[1:57:10] my spirit
[1:57:14] come on church
[1:57:15] you want to see it again go in the token
[1:57:18] exodus 12. what's happening god is
[1:57:21] bringing judgment upon egypt but at the
[1:57:24] same hour judgment is falling on egypt
[1:57:27] there is a group of people who have come
[1:57:30] under the covenant of a token by a
[1:57:32] pillar of fire by a prophet and by the
[1:57:35] blood of the lamb the corporal bodies in
[1:57:38] the house the lamb is not being seen but
[1:57:42] the life is on display
[1:57:44] what is the church the life of jesus
[1:57:47] christ in every aspect except for the
[1:57:50] corporal body he is the same yesterday
[1:57:53] today and forever that same jesus is
[1:57:56] right here in the building this morning
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:03] not by my but by my
[1:58:06] now we're getting somewhere second
[1:58:08] corinthians 3 watch paul he teaches it
[1:58:11] clearly he said now this now the lord
[1:58:15] is that spirit
[1:58:17] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:58:20] there is liberty
[1:58:22] liberty from every denomination
[1:58:25] liberty from every man made teaching
[1:58:27] liberty from every kingdom that
[1:58:29] nebuchadnezzar saw you are the first
[1:58:32] church in the entire ages that have left
[1:58:36] the ages and brought liberty upon the
[1:58:40] church
[1:58:42] glory to god
[1:58:45] come on champion well by the way you
[1:58:47] saying layout to see has ended you know
[1:58:48] let's just send that question right here
[1:58:50] i'm a little sick of that question by
[1:58:52] now
[1:58:52] william branham is laodicea over no it's
[1:58:55] not ended
[1:58:57] it will end in tribulation if you think
[1:58:58] i said differently he said you
[1:59:00] misunderstood me that is a settled
[1:59:03] matter what am i talking about laodicea
[1:59:06] represents egypt
[1:59:08] but goshen is the pride
[1:59:10] and when judgment's on laodicea there's
[1:59:14] a pride standing under the token word of
[1:59:17] the baptism of the holy ghost we've got
[1:59:20] live negotiation
[1:59:25] hallelujah we've got a lot in goshen
[1:59:32] you think i've lost my mind i've not
[1:59:34] lost my mind the bible said where the
[1:59:36] spirit of the lord is we're the spirit
[1:59:38] that's jerubal brought to the church is
[1:59:41] it will be liberty from ever teaching
[1:59:44] liberty from every every apostle liberty
[1:59:47] from every man-made system had come upon
[1:59:49] the earth
[1:59:51] i'll tell you what this message will do
[1:59:53] it'll destroy every bit of it
[1:59:57] people get caught under traditions and i
[1:59:59] know what they are and they intermingle
[2:00:01] themselves with you with family
[2:00:02] traditions
[2:00:04] well glory we might as well preach since
[2:00:05] we're here
[2:00:08] i got to thank him one day i might make
[2:00:10] a little gold
[2:00:11] i found out gold don't come from the
[2:00:13] earth it come from the heavens
[2:00:15] i think it's illegal to do it anyhow but
[2:00:17] i was thinking i was thinking there got
[2:00:18] to be a way to make this stuff
[2:00:22] but father feather study tells you
[2:00:25] that gold comes from fallen stars the
[2:00:27] stars fell into the earth and the gold
[2:00:29] was deposited from their fall and they
[2:00:32] mingled into the earth that's why when
[2:00:34] you pull them out of the earth there is
[2:00:36] pyrite and there's iron and there's
[2:00:38] crystals and everything's in them that's
[2:00:40] why a prophet said something had to beat
[2:00:43] the gold until all that other stuff is
[2:00:46] out of it come on church and christ has
[2:00:49] sent a message to beat out every family
[2:00:52] tradition to beat out every idea of man
[2:00:59] come on you were in the heavens to begin
[2:01:02] with but a foul brought you into the air
[2:01:06] come on and your family traditions been
[2:01:09] mingled into you but god don't want your
[2:01:11] family tradition he wants the gold that
[2:01:14] he put in you from the foundation of the
[2:01:17] world
[2:01:18] it's time for you to focus it's time for
[2:01:21] you to focus i know what your last name
[2:01:23] is but i want to know what your first
[2:01:25] name should have been
[2:01:26] should you have been miss jesus christ
[2:01:28] to begin with
[2:01:32] well brother wayne i've got these faults
[2:01:34] and i know who you are some people
[2:01:35] sitting in here hey man knew me from
[2:01:37] time i was in diapers
[2:01:40] but you focusing on the wrong guy
[2:01:42] because there's another guy in there by
[2:01:44] the baptism of the holy ghost a gc that
[2:01:47] come from almighty god and i've been
[2:01:49] through some rough patches and i've been
[2:01:51] through some troubles in my life but
[2:01:53] every one of them was only separating
[2:01:56] the humanity from the deity that god
[2:01:59] could use us for what he decided to use
[2:02:01] us for
[2:02:07] there's got to be a separation in it
[2:02:10] and here
[2:02:11] is a stone
[2:02:12] to beat the gold
[2:02:14] into the image of itself
[2:02:17] the spirit of the lord where it's at
[2:02:18] there'll be a liberty
[2:02:20] oh god
[2:02:22] can we stay there
[2:02:24] the lord is that spirit can you say it
[2:02:26] with me the lord
[2:02:28] so let's catch zechariah 4 by my spirit
[2:02:32] ii corinthians says the lord is that
[2:02:35] spirit
[2:02:36] but in first thessalonians 4
[2:02:38] it said the lord that spirit himself
[2:02:41] would descend from heaven
[2:02:46] oh church
[2:02:48] the lord himself is going to descend
[2:02:51] from heaven that's why we don't need
[2:02:53] your personality
[2:02:56] amen isn't it beautiful amen that we're
[2:02:58] not here following a personality this
[2:03:00] morning we're not here after a
[2:03:02] personality or a building or how it
[2:03:04] looks or what it is amen we have
[2:03:06] dedicated our lives to a message it's
[2:03:09] not the personality of a pastor or a
[2:03:11] preacher or an evangelist there is only
[2:03:14] one person that's important in the house
[2:03:16] of god that person is christ jesus our
[2:03:19] lord
[2:03:21] he is not the second person of the
[2:03:23] godhead he's not the third person of
[2:03:25] some godhead he is god alone
[2:03:28] and there is none outside him
[2:03:33] we are not a bunch of pagans to believe
[2:03:35] in the multiplicity of gods there is one
[2:03:37] god he is our lord jesus christ and he
[2:03:40] is descending into this earth by the
[2:03:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:03:48] don't bring that trinitarian stuff to me
[2:03:50] because you're going to john 14 and
[2:03:51] you'll say watch jesus said the father
[2:03:54] right the father will not leave you
[2:03:55] comforted so he send another
[2:03:58] sound like two or three there don't it
[2:04:00] we'll just keep reading though
[2:04:02] the bible doesn't contradict itself the
[2:04:04] scripture continues to say i will not
[2:04:06] leave you comfortless but i will come
[2:04:08] unto you and be in you even until the
[2:04:11] end of the world so is there three or is
[2:04:14] there one
[2:04:14] [Applause]
[2:04:16] there is only one lord there is only one
[2:04:19] god and his name is jesus christ he is
[2:04:22] the king of all the kings he is the lord
[2:04:25] of all lord and he has risen up this
[2:04:28] evening and he sits on the right hand of
[2:04:31] our father in
[2:04:36] power trinitarians have twisted every
[2:04:39] doctrine they'll take that right hand of
[2:04:41] power and make two seats up there well
[2:04:43] let me tell you jesus and all power and
[2:04:45] heaven and earth has given unto me that
[2:04:48] power that was put into him is
[2:04:50] accessible today by the baptism of the
[2:04:52] holy ghost to every believer in this
[2:04:54] building
[2:04:58] now
[2:05:01] i don't want you to think i'm crazy
[2:05:03] but the lord himself shall descend from
[2:05:05] heaven
[2:05:08] now you might think
[2:05:09] when he brings forth the headstone
[2:05:11] crying shouting grace grace there's an
[2:05:13] actual rock
[2:05:15] but the prophet and the message of grace
[2:05:18] said when he unfolds this mystery
[2:05:20] i'll cry grace
[2:05:23] when he unfolds them seals
[2:05:26] i'll cry so a prophet
[2:05:28] he was not bringing a rock
[2:05:33] to the pulpit
[2:05:35] he was bringing a revelation
[2:05:40] he was bringing revelation
[2:05:42] i don't know what it does
[2:05:44] he was bringing a revelation is that
[2:05:46] yours
[2:05:48] hallelujah
[2:05:51] mercy
[2:05:54] oh i feel good
[2:05:59] mercy
[2:06:03] man you had me
[2:06:05] you had me going i almost stole your
[2:06:06] seat the other night
[2:06:08] is the hanky sorry
[2:06:12] had me going josh
[2:06:14] i wanted to take that seat when he
[2:06:17] when he had paul on one side
[2:06:19] brother branham on the other
[2:06:21] the only thing i could think is i'm at
[2:06:23] the wrong table
[2:06:28] somebody somebody put me at the wrong
[2:06:30] table
[2:06:36] but i'll take it
[2:06:39] see
[2:06:40] he said i'll unfold this mystery so he's
[2:06:42] bringing a revelation
[2:06:44] now i i want you to see something the
[2:06:47] stone that daniel seen is not granted
[2:06:52] it's not granted how many knows that
[2:06:54] trees represent men in the bible
[2:06:56] i mean those stones represent men in the
[2:06:58] bible
[2:06:59] now watch this because in second in
[2:07:01] first peter
[2:07:02] he says to whom a living stone
[2:07:04] disallowed men and chosen of god
[2:07:06] precious and two and five you also
[2:07:08] lively stones built up as a spiritual
[2:07:10] house a holy priesthood to offer
[2:07:12] spiritual sacrifices acceptably god by
[2:07:14] christ we're for also is contained in
[2:07:17] the scripture behold i lay in zion a
[2:07:19] chief cornerstone elect precious he that
[2:07:21] believeth upon him shall not be
[2:07:23] confounded it's not a granite the bible
[2:07:26] said it's a person
[2:07:29] looking look at the scripture the stone
[2:07:31] which the builders disallowed is made
[2:07:34] the head of the corner the seventh verse
[2:07:37] in the eighth verse it's a stone of
[2:07:38] stumbling a rock of offense even in them
[2:07:40] which stumble at the word being
[2:07:42] disobedient were unto they also were
[2:07:46] appointed now let's use another one it's
[2:07:48] a spiritual rock according to paul he
[2:07:50] says that did drink of the same
[2:07:52] spiritual rock they drink of the rock
[2:07:53] they follow them that rock was christ
[2:07:57] according to the book of luke amen if
[2:07:59] this rock fell on you
[2:08:02] it would break you to pieces
[2:08:04] but if you fell on it
[2:08:06] you would be broken
[2:08:10] well it's up to you which way you want
[2:08:12] that to end
[2:08:14] in acts chapter 4 again for for time
[2:08:16] i'll not read it but i'll give you the
[2:08:18] scripture acts chapter 4 again amen the
[2:08:21] stone is the head
[2:08:22] amen in romans 9 paul prophesies and
[2:08:26] said wherefore because they sought it
[2:08:27] not by faith as it were by the works of
[2:08:30] the law they stumbled at the stumbling
[2:08:32] stone and it is written behold i lay in
[2:08:36] zion a stumbling stone and rock of
[2:08:39] offense
[2:08:40] whosoever believeth upon him shall not
[2:08:43] be ashamed now that just sounds like a
[2:08:46] scripture in the book of romans that is
[2:08:48] totally abstract from who you are but
[2:08:51] how many knows the importance of that
[2:08:53] scripture to this church
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:56] this is the scripture your church is
[2:08:58] built on
[2:08:59] do you know that when brother branham in
[2:09:01] 1962 in the fall
[2:09:03] his ministry was changing
[2:09:05] it's going to take me a minute so y'all
[2:09:07] forgive me but i feel compelled to say
[2:09:09] this to you
[2:09:10] his ministry was changing
[2:09:13] and he was moving from a second pull to
[2:09:15] a third pull of his ministry he was
[2:09:17] moving he meant from the prophecies he
[2:09:20] meant of just divine healing and he was
[2:09:21] moving into being a word prophet
[2:09:24] and in the fall of 1962 he sees a vision
[2:09:27] of angels coming and he actually thinks
[2:09:30] it's his death he thinks he's about to
[2:09:33] die and he makes a prayer and said lord
[2:09:35] if this is the end of my ministry if
[2:09:37] this is my death let me die he said but
[2:09:39] if it's not give me a consolation teach
[2:09:42] me show me he said about a half hour
[2:09:44] later i woke up in the corner and i had
[2:09:47] my bible open
[2:09:49] to a scripture romans the 9th chapter
[2:09:53] and the 32nd and 33rd verse
[2:09:55] so those angels coming to brother
[2:09:58] branham have you heard the story the
[2:09:59] room talks about angels coming to him i
[2:10:01] want to see your hands so i wanna know
[2:10:02] where you are
[2:10:03] amen you've heard the story of how seven
[2:10:05] angels came to him
[2:10:07] out in tucson there
[2:10:09] but before they came to him in tucson
[2:10:12] six months prior he tells on tape a
[2:10:15] vision of seeing them coming to him
[2:10:18] and he's asking what does this them
[2:10:21] coming to me mean
[2:10:23] and god answers what the coming of them
[2:10:25] means it means a stone will be laid in
[2:10:29] zion
[2:10:31] come on cerumable he's bringing the
[2:10:34] stone
[2:10:35] he's not bringing a piece of granite
[2:10:37] he's introducing the person of the word
[2:10:40] back to the church that's the very
[2:10:43] bridegroom of the church in the last
[2:10:45] days
[2:10:47] now look what he's doing he comes to
[2:10:49] himself in the corner and he says he
[2:10:51] says oh i've come to myself reading the
[2:10:53] scripture in romans the ninth chapter
[2:10:55] now it's a beautiful thing because now
[2:10:58] he has a vision that's in romans chapter
[2:11:01] 9 a stone i want you to stay with me
[2:11:04] a stone now
[2:11:06] is in revelations the 10th chapter with
[2:11:09] an angel coming with a message
[2:11:11] the stone of daniel 2
[2:11:14] is now transferred to revelations 10
[2:11:18] as a prophet
[2:11:19] coming with a message
[2:11:23] so romans 9 now puts you in revelations
[2:11:26] 10. let's read revelation 10. and i saw
[2:11:28] another mighty angel come down from
[2:11:30] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[2:11:32] rainbow was upon his head
[2:11:34] his face as it were the sun his feet as
[2:11:36] the pillars of fire now look at this he
[2:11:39] had in his hand a little book and he set
[2:11:41] his right foot upon the land left foot
[2:11:42] upon the earth the first verse there
[2:11:45] tells you that when he saw him he was
[2:11:48] wearing a cloud he was clove with a
[2:11:50] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head do
[2:11:52] you know this scripture
[2:11:54] is actually going to be fulfilled
[2:11:57] right just northeast of tucson arizona
[2:11:59] in 1963 in the end of february
[2:12:03] can you pull up the picture
[2:12:05] when you when you see this
[2:12:08] william branham prophesies
[2:12:11] six months later
[2:12:12] he meets seven angels
[2:12:14] and they form
[2:12:16] a wig around the face of jesus christ
[2:12:19] now if you see that picture if you see
[2:12:21] it a little closer you can look right in
[2:12:23] that into the into that picture you'll
[2:12:25] see the eyes
[2:12:26] the beard the nose we can show it to you
[2:12:29] a little better in a picture but you can
[2:12:31] see the face of jesus christ now you you
[2:12:34] say a cloud the bible said it was a
[2:12:36] cloud he was clothed with a cloud and
[2:12:38] seven angels were his wig
[2:12:42] the wig of this man is seven angels now
[2:12:45] you say where why in the world was this
[2:12:47] why does this look like this do you know
[2:12:50] that john saw this very cloud in
[2:12:52] revelation chapter one how many knows it
[2:12:55] in revelation the first chapter you can
[2:12:57] go read it and john said i saw him
[2:13:01] he said i saw him with a hair like wool
[2:13:05] and a face like fire that he did not say
[2:13:07] it and his feet were his brass
[2:13:10] and he gives you seven symbols of the
[2:13:12] judgment of jesus christ
[2:13:14] coming
[2:13:15] upon the earth
[2:13:18] oh church
[2:13:19] now when john sees it in revelations 1
[2:13:22] he sees it as a judge
[2:13:26] what's that stone in daniel 2 supposed
[2:13:28] to be the judgment of the earth
[2:13:32] and he sees this cloud a prophet sees
[2:13:35] this cloud in revelations one and
[2:13:37] brother branham takes this very picture
[2:13:40] and says it is exactly what john saw in
[2:13:44] revelations the first chapter it's
[2:13:46] exactly what happened in revelations the
[2:13:48] 10th chapter now why are you why are you
[2:13:50] spending time here let me show you
[2:13:52] something if you look in this in this
[2:13:54] cloud you'll see that when you look at
[2:13:57] the face of jesus he's actually looking
[2:14:00] to the right
[2:14:02] now the prophet said watch this he's
[2:14:04] looking to the right exactly like he did
[2:14:08] at calvary
[2:14:10] at calvary jesus was hanging
[2:14:13] between two things one on the left and
[2:14:15] one was on the right
[2:14:16] the thief on the left was coming to his
[2:14:19] judgment
[2:14:21] but he was looking to the right where
[2:14:23] there was a center hanging there
[2:14:28] that thief on his right i hope you're
[2:14:30] hearing me was the last seed of the old
[2:14:33] testament
[2:14:35] he was the very last one to come in and
[2:14:38] he was hanging on the cross
[2:14:41] he couldn't repent he couldn't be
[2:14:43] baptized he couldn't do the works he
[2:14:46] couldn't put up
[2:14:48] you know what he did he accepted
[2:14:51] he accepted jesus christ he said lord
[2:14:55] remember me
[2:15:00] grace grace
[2:15:03] not what i've done what i accepted
[2:15:07] david when he accepted him jesus said
[2:15:10] tomorrow you'll be with me and my
[2:15:11] kingdom you'll be with me and my kingdom
[2:15:14] what you have accepted has exalted you
[2:15:17] from a thief from a robber from a
[2:15:20] murderer and the voice of one has
[2:15:23] elevated you to a position
[2:15:26] i can't hardly preach i want you to know
[2:15:29] brother random said something about that
[2:15:30] thief on the right that'll just blow
[2:15:32] your mind
[2:15:33] he said that boy had lived his whole
[2:15:35] life
[2:15:36] he said he never thought about god even
[2:15:39] one time
[2:15:42] not even one time had he ever thought i
[2:15:45] already get saved how hard to get right
[2:15:48] but the power of what he was hanging
[2:15:50] beside the power of what he was standing
[2:15:53] beside was the power of all the ages
[2:15:57] he was hanging next to not the third
[2:15:59] person of a godhead that wasn't just
[2:16:02] another man that was the king
[2:16:04] that was a sovereign king with a
[2:16:06] sovereign grace and pardoned him
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:11] the head bringing grace
[2:16:16] the last ones coming in
[2:16:19] at the time of judgment when the whole
[2:16:21] world is under judgment but this message
[2:16:24] is not a message of judgment it is a
[2:16:26] message of grace it is part of you it
[2:16:29] has taken you from every lie it has
[2:16:31] taken you from every sin it's brought
[2:16:34] you out of every ungodliness and it's
[2:16:36] given you a victory
[2:16:40] there's nothing that can do it nobody's
[2:16:43] church can pardon you
[2:16:45] no lutheran church no pentecostal church
[2:16:48] but this message is the head
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:54] i wish i had the voice over ten angels
[2:16:56] right now amen to prophesy to you you
[2:16:58] have received your sign you have
[2:17:00] received the word that can change your
[2:17:03] entire life
[2:17:08] look at this he brought it right down
[2:17:09] there
[2:17:11] now you're gonna you're gonna think i'm
[2:17:12] a nut but i want you to watch the
[2:17:14] scriptures
[2:17:15] in daniel 2 that stone
[2:17:17] became romans 9
[2:17:19] which is wrong revelations the 10th
[2:17:21] chapter the opening of that book
[2:17:22] do you know that white wig one
[2:17:24] who's in revelations 10
[2:17:26] who's in revelations 1
[2:17:28] is also in daniel 7.
[2:17:31] in daniel 7 it's prophesied there is one
[2:17:35] called the ancient of days
[2:17:37] william branham takes this picture and
[2:17:39] said this is the ancient of days of
[2:17:41] daniel the seventh chapter anybody know
[2:17:44] what he did in daniel 7
[2:17:46] he come to the end of them four beasts
[2:17:48] and when he got to the end of their
[2:17:50] powers he gave the kingdom unto the
[2:17:53] saints of the most high
[2:17:55] the one that can give you the kingdom is
[2:17:58] upon the earth the one that can give you
[2:18:00] a ministry is here the one that can give
[2:18:03] you a grace is here
[2:18:07] it was the ancient of days
[2:18:09] he brought a dominion to the church now
[2:18:12] you've heard it said that you have been
[2:18:14] lifted into heavenly places but it has
[2:18:16] never been fulfilled until this hour in
[2:18:19] the church angels could not bring you
[2:18:20] this high hey my church listen to me
[2:18:23] leon decear can't bring you this high
[2:18:25] but it would take a message it would
[2:18:27] take a grace from god that would lift
[2:18:29] you above every denomination man can
[2:18:32] only take you so high but this is the
[2:18:34] wings of an eagle and it's taking you
[2:18:36] beyond your family it's taking you
[2:18:38] beyond your understanding beyond your
[2:18:41] tradition oh god he ain't looking for a
[2:18:44] buggy driver he's looking for an eagle
[2:18:46] he's looking for a son of god
[2:18:50] my brother being back there he said to
[2:18:51] me last night i come from the buggy amen
[2:18:54] behold he's moved he moved from a buggy
[2:18:57] to a car to an airplane and now he's
[2:19:00] sitting on an astronaut today and he's
[2:19:02] went higher than any lutheran can take
[2:19:05] him
[2:19:07] how to determine
[2:19:09] he's went into the mind of god that is
[2:19:12] before the world ever began
[2:19:18] headship is the mind of god
[2:19:21] why could a prophet stand there
[2:19:23] amen in a denomination you can't do this
[2:19:25] but brother brandon could say you never
[2:19:27] did it in the first place
[2:19:30] where is the first place
[2:19:32] it's in the mind of god
[2:19:34] and here's the prophet bringing the mind
[2:19:37] of god back to the church where you
[2:19:40] never were a sinner where you never had
[2:19:43] a problem well you never were amen just
[2:19:46] another church member you were always a
[2:19:48] son
[2:19:53] in revelation 13 this beast comes
[2:19:55] crawling out of the sea
[2:19:57] brother said wrong coming from the
[2:19:59] peoples of the world
[2:20:02] a little later in revelation 13 8-9
[2:20:05] you'll see that that same beast power as
[2:20:07] an image comes crawling out of the land
[2:20:10] it's america an image under the beast so
[2:20:13] the beast
[2:20:14] that daniel saw is crawling out of the
[2:20:17] land
[2:20:18] crawling out of the sea every system in
[2:20:20] the world is infested by wrong but here
[2:20:23] comes one down out of heaven and he
[2:20:25] takes one foot and puts it on the land
[2:20:28] and he takes another and puts it on the
[2:20:30] sea and every system is now subject to
[2:20:34] the word of god in the age listen to me
[2:20:37] i don't have to ask no baptist church if
[2:20:38] i can preach this i don't have to ask no
[2:20:41] lutheran if i can preach this amen this
[2:20:44] is the headship of christ coming back
[2:20:46] upon the church
[2:20:50] there's nothing above it
[2:20:51] there's no word higher
[2:20:55] it's a preacher why in a world why in
[2:20:58] the world would you go this far people
[2:21:00] say to me all the time they say well hey
[2:21:02] man this might have happened in another
[2:21:03] age you know that's why i love about the
[2:21:06] bible god so tied this up that you can't
[2:21:08] misplace it if you believe the bible
[2:21:12] daniel saw what what john saw y'all
[2:21:14] believe that
[2:21:15] in daniel 12 what did the bible say
[2:21:18] daniel
[2:21:19] seal up this book
[2:21:21] until when
[2:21:23] till the ten toes
[2:21:27] seal it up until the end time
[2:21:30] and in the end
[2:21:32] knowledge shall increase
[2:21:35] and the righteous shall shine as the
[2:21:37] permanence of the heavens you'll be
[2:21:39] lifted from the sands and the dirt and
[2:21:41] the dust and be placed into the stars
[2:21:44] where you originally were sons and
[2:21:46] daughters of god there is coming a
[2:21:48] message under the opening of the book
[2:21:50] and i'll put a son of god where he
[2:21:52] belongs it'll place him back in the
[2:21:54] heavens in the mind of god you didn't
[2:21:57] you didn't you didn't belong in that bar
[2:21:59] room you didn't believe long in that
[2:22:01] tavern you didn't live in that
[2:22:03] whorehouse you didn't believe in that
[2:22:04] crack house that's not where you come
[2:22:06] from that's not your origin you come
[2:22:09] from god but here's a message that'll
[2:22:11] put you back where you come from
[2:22:15] the blood is for the redeemed
[2:22:18] this blood ain't for everybody this
[2:22:20] bloody for everything is for those sons
[2:22:22] that were born before the foundations of
[2:22:25] the world it's here to put you back
[2:22:31] when's it going to happen brother
[2:22:32] in the end
[2:22:35] in the end
[2:22:37] this day
[2:22:42] in daniel chapter 10
[2:22:44] amen
[2:22:45] excuse me in revelation chapter 10
[2:22:47] almighty angel coming out of heaven
[2:22:50] what's it say he has
[2:22:52] a book open
[2:22:54] so daniel 12's book
[2:22:57] is open in revelations 10.
[2:23:02] and john wanted to write it it was such
[2:23:04] a good message
[2:23:05] it was such a powerful thing
[2:23:07] john wanted to can you listen to me
[2:23:09] folks
[2:23:11] can you imagine john
[2:23:14] seeing
[2:23:15] even the symbols of what i'm preaching
[2:23:17] right now
[2:23:20] and he couldn't tell it
[2:23:22] he had to seal it up
[2:23:25] he had to seal the thing and and the
[2:23:27] thing we're wondering is how long we're
[2:23:29] going to seal it
[2:23:30] how long will it last now according to
[2:23:33] your bible in daniel in revelation
[2:23:35] chapter 10 and the seventh verse
[2:23:37] pulled it up revelation chapter 10 and
[2:23:39] seven
[2:23:40] it tells us when
[2:23:42] the book would be unsealed
[2:23:45] daniel 12's book
[2:23:47] will be unsealed sometime in the future
[2:23:50] from daniel and he predicted it would be
[2:23:52] at the end time
[2:23:54] but in the days of the voice
[2:23:57] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[2:24:01] to sound
[2:24:02] the mystery of god would be finished as
[2:24:04] declared to his servants the prophets
[2:24:07] in the voice of the seventh
[2:24:12] seventh angel come on now
[2:24:15] so if you're counting one two three four
[2:24:17] five six seven that gets us laodicea
[2:24:20] so who's the messenger of laodicea
[2:24:23] will be the same angel that would
[2:24:25] declare the mysteries that was healed in
[2:24:27] daniel chapter 12.
[2:24:29] now
[2:24:32] look at the beauty of this because if
[2:24:33] you if you watch the bible it'll tell
[2:24:35] you story after story i'm not going to
[2:24:37] preach all day now hold you hold your
[2:24:39] peace revelation chapter 22
[2:24:41] what what's this now revelation chapter
[2:24:43] 22
[2:24:45] if you go if you go in revelation
[2:24:46] chapter 22 it's the end of the bible
[2:24:49] and you go on the ninth verse now watch
[2:24:50] what happens in revelation 22 verse 8
[2:24:52] we'll start in the eight and i john saw
[2:24:54] these things and heard them as i seen
[2:24:56] who's john
[2:24:59] i john saw these things heard them and
[2:25:01] when i'd heard them seeing these things
[2:25:02] fell down to worship before the feet of
[2:25:04] the angel which showed me these things
[2:25:07] john
[2:25:08] set into worshiping the angel that was
[2:25:10] showing the revelation
[2:25:12] which many men have got caught up in
[2:25:16] but the angel said unto me
[2:25:19] don't do that
[2:25:22] well that's good ain't it
[2:25:24] hallelujah you could shout all the way
[2:25:26] home with that one
[2:25:28] don't do that
[2:25:30] for i am thy fellow servant
[2:25:33] so he's not a celestial angel after all
[2:25:37] he's a fellow servant
[2:25:38] and of the brethren
[2:25:41] a prophet
[2:25:43] so this seventh angel is also a prophet
[2:25:48] look at what he says he says keep the
[2:25:50] sayings of the book and worship god
[2:25:52] william branham is saying to you stay
[2:25:54] with the scripture and worship god
[2:25:58] stay with the scripture and worship god
[2:26:02] look at what he does
[2:26:03] amen look look in the 10th chapter
[2:26:06] what's john told by the angel seal it up
[2:26:09] until what
[2:26:10] seventh angel what's the tenth verse he
[2:26:13] sayeth unto me
[2:26:15] seal
[2:26:16] not the saints
[2:26:18] so the seventh angel is the one dealing
[2:26:20] with john in this verse
[2:26:24] it's not time to seal it it's time to

[2:31:02] and filthy go to daniel chapter 12.
[2:31:05] what's the
[2:31:06] what's the continuity
[2:31:09] what's the continuity of that scripture
[2:31:11] as it it's laid right on the
[2:31:13] right on the end of the scripture
[2:31:16] when daniel begin to see it
[2:31:20] when the when in the latter part of
[2:31:22] daniel 12 for time sake
[2:31:24] daniel sees the sign of the end
[2:31:27] is the holy ghost capping the people
[2:31:29] one standing wide on the water which is
[2:31:31] christ coming on to the people
[2:31:33] and when he sees this daniel said he saw
[2:31:35] it
[2:31:37] he said and i heard the man in clothing
[2:31:38] say
[2:31:39] the water's river he held up his right
[2:31:40] hand in his left hand
[2:31:42] daniel 10 revelation 10 again amen and
[2:31:45] he says in whom
[2:31:47] we have accomplished scattered the power
[2:31:49] of the holy people and all these things
[2:31:50] shall be finished and i heard but i
[2:31:52] understood not then he said oh my lord
[2:31:54] what shall be the end of these things he
[2:31:55] said go that way
[2:31:57] daniel the words are closed up and
[2:31:58] sealed to the time of the end
[2:32:00] many shall be purified made white and
[2:32:02] tried
[2:32:03] watch this revelation 22 right here in
[2:32:05] daniel 12
[2:32:07] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[2:32:10] none of the wicked
[2:32:11] shall understand
[2:32:14] but the wise
[2:32:18] what the wise
[2:32:19] shall understand
[2:32:21] say preacher what are you saying at the
[2:32:23] time
[2:32:24] when the book is open
[2:32:26] there will be a spirit of understanding
[2:32:29] among the people
[2:32:30] there will be a people who understands
[2:32:33] what's being opened to them
[2:32:35] listen friends people then they'll take
[2:32:37] it to the intellectual and i and i am
[2:32:39] one preacher that hates intellectuals
[2:32:41] i hate an intellectual spirit worse and
[2:32:42] i hate anything
[2:32:44] because they make it about what man can
[2:32:46] do
[2:32:46] but man cannot understand this
[2:32:49] intellectuals cannot understand this
[2:32:51] that woman at the whale was not an
[2:32:53] intellectual she was a jean seed and she
[2:32:56] understood that god was the one talking
[2:32:58] to her and when the seals are opened up
[2:33:01] the genes see when they hear this word
[2:33:04] it's going to believe it now you wasn't
[2:33:06] a smart person you weren't educated you
[2:33:08] wasn't a bible student but when you
[2:33:10] heard it brother ben when he was in that
[2:33:11] in the amish community you heard the
[2:33:13] word you come out of it why did you come
[2:33:15] not because you had a great education
[2:33:18] but you understood that god was dealing
[2:33:20] with you brother amos that's what
[2:33:22] happened god was dealing with you what
[2:33:24] happened to you when you come out of the
[2:33:26] baptist what happened when you come out
[2:33:28] of the lutheran what happened when you
[2:33:29] come off the bar room understanding was
[2:33:32] coming to you because of the spirit of
[2:33:34] understanding america
[2:33:39] now
[2:33:40] when the spirit of understanding shall
[2:33:42] come
[2:33:44] now i'm about to close in ephesians
[2:33:45] chapter one i want you to watch this
[2:33:49] dedicated
[2:33:52] dedicated to a message
[2:33:54] ephesians chapter one we're dealing with
[2:33:56] understanding
[2:33:57] now the god of our lord jesus christ
[2:33:59] the father glory
[2:34:01] the spirit of wisdom and revelation the
[2:34:03] knowledge of him
[2:34:04] the eyes of your understanding mean the
[2:34:06] light that you may know
[2:34:07] what is the hope of the calling what is
[2:34:09] the riches of the glory and the heritage
[2:34:10] and saints and what is the exceeding
[2:34:11] great power to us who believe
[2:34:14] according to the working of his mighty
[2:34:16] power
[2:34:17] so when the spirit of revelation of
[2:34:19] wisdom comes understanding comes
[2:34:22] and with understanding power
[2:34:27] with understanding power when you
[2:34:30] understand
[2:34:32] who
[2:34:33] you are
[2:34:34] you have a different authority
[2:34:38] when you understand you belong here
[2:34:41] you have a different authority
[2:34:43] you don't belong here brother matt
[2:34:44] because i told you to be here
[2:34:47] you don't belong here because somebody
[2:34:48] else asked you to be here you belong
[2:34:50] because god told you to be here
[2:34:52] when he opened up that word he
[2:34:54] understood that i'm to preach that
[2:34:56] message i'm understood i'm the preacher
[2:34:58] right here amen and at the same time it
[2:35:00] give others understanding to do the same
[2:35:02] thing amen what is it it's a feeling
[2:35:05] under a certain word that god releases
[2:35:07] in a certain season amen now now that
[2:35:10] god has different brothers preaching
[2:35:12] different all over this area but it's
[2:35:14] for one purpose it's to bring everybody
[2:35:16] to one purpose it's a rapture of the
[2:35:18] church this is not about men's
[2:35:20] ministries this is about christ this is
[2:35:23] about christ coming in the church this
[2:35:25] is about a rapture
[2:35:27] listen to me the world is falling apart
[2:35:29] what difference does the church building
[2:35:31] make what difference does it make where
[2:35:33] you are in a church building or another
[2:35:35] church building it's all about to burn
[2:35:38] but if you are dedicated to this message
[2:35:41] this message will lift you
[2:35:43] like nothing else can lift you
[2:35:46] [Applause]
[2:35:50] the spirit of wisdom and revelation will
[2:35:51] come upon the church and understanding
[2:35:53] amen now watch this
[2:35:55] i'm going to close with this scripture
[2:35:56] revelation chapter 3.
[2:35:59] look at look at the scripture here
[2:36:01] he says it here very clearly
[2:36:04] in the 21st verse
[2:36:05] and to him that overcometh what i grant
[2:36:07] to set with me and my throne as i have
[2:36:09] overcame and sat down with my father in
[2:36:11] his throne
[2:36:13] to him
[2:36:14] that overcometh
[2:36:16] will i grant to set with me in my throne
[2:36:20] to him
[2:36:21] that overcometh can i ask you all a
[2:36:23] question
[2:36:24] how
[2:36:25] do i overcome
[2:36:28] good question
[2:36:30] william branham preaches an entire
[2:36:32] sermon
[2:36:33] how can i overcome he starts out by
[2:36:36] saying
[2:36:37] don't ask the question what i am to
[2:36:40] overcome
[2:36:41] ask how can i overcome
[2:36:43] because the what is going to change
[2:36:46] the what might be a entertainment to one
[2:36:49] man the what might be whiskey to another
[2:36:52] the what might be the nomination to
[2:36:54] another the what might be the tradition
[2:36:56] of my family to another it's not what
[2:36:58] you're overcoming it's how you're
[2:37:00] overcoming
[2:37:01] and he said how did jesus himself
[2:37:04] overcome
[2:37:05] it
[2:37:06] is written
[2:37:08] that's the way you overcome it
[2:37:10] is
[2:37:11] written
[2:37:12] come on now
[2:37:14] jesus was the most powerful thing in the
[2:37:16] world he never defeated the devil with
[2:37:17] supernatural power he defeated with it
[2:37:21] is written i wonder how the bride will
[2:37:23] overcome the antichrist
[2:37:26] come on how will she overcome the
[2:37:27] antichrist according to revelation
[2:37:29] chapter 12 it tells you how she
[2:37:31] overcomes it says she overcame by the
[2:37:34] blood
[2:37:36] and by the word of her testimony
[2:37:39] how are you going to overcome this devil
[2:37:41] by the word of the season you're living
[2:37:43] in and how can the church overcome if
[2:37:47] there is no word if there's no prophet
[2:37:50] if there's no power but here we're
[2:37:52] standing in this hour when god has sent
[2:37:55] the unveiling of the message itself into
[2:37:58] our season not just to be a book on a
[2:38:01] tape or a message booker not just to say
[2:38:03] i'm in the message or not just to put a
[2:38:05] tape on the shelf or to put a book up
[2:38:07] somewhere and identify with some group
[2:38:09] somewhere he sent a message that there
[2:38:11] would be a group of overcomers in the
[2:38:13] last day because he has prophesied there
[2:38:17] will be a greater power than the roman
[2:38:20] kingdom in the last day there will be a
[2:38:22] church upon the earth that is greater
[2:38:25] than the antichrist there will be a
[2:38:27] pride that is greater than every devil
[2:38:29] he has more power than every enemy she
[2:38:32] will be that risen pride who is in
[2:38:34] authority by the word of god now listen
[2:38:37] when you read this scripture right here
[2:38:39] it says something very clearly and he
[2:38:41] said to him that overcometh what i grant
[2:38:43] to sit in
[2:38:46] to set in my brother brian brother brown
[2:38:49] takes that one little word and shows us
[2:38:51] something
[2:38:52] he said that's a spiritual kingdom
[2:38:55] he said because when jesus was raised
[2:38:58] his kingdom was his domain by his spirit
[2:39:02] so wherever that spirit is resting
[2:39:04] wherever the headship of christ is that
[2:39:08] is his dominion
[2:39:09] and to you that overcome you have been
[2:39:12] put into another kingdom that's why
[2:39:14] you're not american that's why you're
[2:39:16] not german amen that's why you're not
[2:39:18] lutheran that's not you're not baptist
[2:39:20] that's why you're a christian church
[2:39:22] because you've been put into another
[2:39:23] kingdom by a word that you now share in
[2:39:27] now watch look at the beauty look at the
[2:39:29] beauty of the scripture just on one
[2:39:30] little word he said you'll set in the
[2:39:32] kingdom but if you go to revelation the
[2:39:34] 20th chapter
[2:39:36] and you like to read the fourth verse it
[2:39:38] said that i beheld thrones
[2:39:41] and they that set upon them
[2:39:43] in revelation chapter 20 do you all know
[2:39:45] there are thrones
[2:39:47] set up in the millennial kingdom of
[2:39:49] jesus christ
[2:39:50] do you know that jesus is going to be
[2:39:52] the king of the entire earth
[2:39:54] after the battle of armageddon jesus
[2:39:56] will set up a millennial kingdom upon
[2:39:58] this earth that will be at least a
[2:40:00] thousand years long
[2:40:01] you know why a thousand years
[2:40:03] because he told he told adam the day you
[2:40:05] see him you shall die but jesus is going
[2:40:08] to prove to the devil
[2:40:10] that we have paid the debt of adam and
[2:40:12] man will now live to be a thousand years
[2:40:15] old
[2:40:16] he will prove to the devil there is no
[2:40:18] sin against you there's no demon that
[2:40:20] can hold you you will set up on a throne
[2:40:24] in the millennium but today we are not
[2:40:27] in the millennium
[2:40:29] [Applause]
[2:40:32] listen to me we're not in the millennium
[2:40:35] go crawl in the cage with a tiger he
[2:40:37] will eat you
[2:40:39] you're not in the millennium listen to
[2:40:41] me it would not be miraculous to see
[2:40:44] miracles in the millennium it would not
[2:40:46] be miraculous to see overcomers in the
[2:40:49] millennium but when you come to the
[2:40:51] layout of seeing age the darkest of all
[2:40:54] ages
[2:40:55] and there is a bride that will rise up
[2:40:58] in the middle of the ages and be a
[2:41:00] weapon with god it'll be a strong power
[2:41:04] it'll be an anointing it'll be an
[2:41:06] overcoming sister loretta as an
[2:41:08] overcoming church that's come upon the

[2:43:40] it's the one putting you
[2:43:42] on the throne
[2:43:45] but when you preach that message a
[2:43:46] little strong listen if you understood
[2:43:47] what it was you preach it strong too
[2:43:51] if you've seen
[2:43:53] this is what elevates you
[2:43:55] to a position of authority
[2:43:57] this is what adopts the church
[2:44:00] this is what places them in a position i
[2:44:02] know how it goes
[2:44:04] save this week
[2:44:06] lost this week

[2:44:09] me next week i'm mad at the church this
[2:44:12] week i'm not mad at this next it's just
[2:44:14] like this but if you ever get a believer
[2:44:16] who starts getting under the word
[2:44:18] of this message amen there's something
[2:44:20] begins to stabilize that believer they
[2:44:22] become comfy lifted up they're lifted up
[2:44:25] above bad moods they're lifting them up
[2:44:27] above the feelings they're lifted up
[2:44:29] above the fashions they're lifting above
[2:44:32] good church patchers and then
[2:44:34] something's on the inside of them
[2:44:35] wherever they are that's a good place to
[2:44:38] be because there's an atmosphere that's
[2:44:40] on the inside of them you won't beat it
[2:44:43] out of them you won't drive it out of
[2:44:45] them you won't bring them down place

[2:49:53] he built an altar he dedicated a place
[2:49:56] you can go up on mount upon mount carmel
[2:49:58] right now and they got a circle of rocks
[2:50:00] where elijah dedicated a place it was a

[2:51:23] brother ran him on the other side
[2:51:25] i thought i better get a different seat

[2:52:12] here in this church where this message
[2:52:14] is being preached
[2:52:16] matt didn't pull this out here to make a
[2:52:18] denomination or something pull it out
[2:52:20] here so you could he could preach the
[2:52:22] message of the hour with liberty and
[2:52:24] build your souls in this message
[2:52:26] that's what it's here for that's why he
[2:52:27] preaches this is what he believes
[2:52:33] i know some of you know matt before he
[2:52:34] was a preacher
[2:52:36] i did too
[2:52:38] some of you were looking at matt i was
[2:52:39] looking what he was on the inside
[2:52:42] time he's about 13 year old i used to
[2:52:44] tell you around i said now if you just
[2:52:45] use that gift for god god could do
[2:52:47] something with you
[2:52:50] and he'd almost get mad at me i ain't
[2:52:52] going to be no preacher
[2:52:56] he stands today
[2:52:59] not just a preacher but a good one

[2:53:22] here and the holy spirit showed me
[2:53:23] something in the scripture you can take

[3:07:12] alone by myself and praying and
[3:07:15] locked away in my office and kind of
[3:07:16] takes away from
[3:07:18] the time that we
[3:07:19] grown accustomed to spending and
[3:07:22] you know sure brings a strain
[3:07:24] on the family and
[3:07:26] i know god has
[3:07:27] gave me a wife that could be a part of
[3:07:29] this ministry and
[3:07:31] you know i believe prophet told us that
[3:07:32] when god calls a man
[3:07:34] called his wife too and
[3:07:36] i sure appreciate her for for taking a
[3:07:38] stand on this gospel
[3:07:41] i watch god change your life
[3:07:54] i was a witness
[3:07:56] it's easy for somebody on the outside to
[3:07:58] say you know that's a christian but when
[3:07:59] somebody lives in the house with you
[3:08:00] they really know
[3:08:02] i watch god change your life
[3:08:05] and she's changed mine
[3:08:07] i really appreciate it and i appreciate
[3:08:08] all of y'all this that god's brought you
[3:08:10] to this place and
[3:08:12] called you is not to
[3:08:13] not just to be a partner or to support
[3:08:16] me i never want credit and y'all that
[3:08:17] know me i don't never ask for it don't
[3:08:20] have no desire for it but
[3:08:21] if anything we can do to put our
[3:08:23] shoulders to the wheel and win another
[3:08:25] soul for jesus christ
[3:08:26] that's our desire i appreciate brother
[3:08:28] joe and brother mark ministers here in
[3:08:30] our local assembly and putting their
[3:08:33] shoulder to the wheel and
[3:08:34] we all have the same vision
[3:08:36] we want to make a rapture
[3:08:39] we're going to be a part of this rapture
[3:08:41] it may happen tomorrow maybe next year
[3:08:42] but we'll work till jesus comes
[3:08:45] and thank each one of you
[3:08:47] being a part let's just bow our heads
[3:08:48] and
[3:08:50] ask the lord to be with each one of you
[3:08:52] as you go and
