[36:03] wey land. He's my shelter in a time of
[36:08] soul. Well, God is

[36:23] everything. Amen. I want you to turn
[36:25] around and tell somebody, "God is my
[36:27] everything." Amen. Isn't it wonderful to
[36:30] have a God that means everything to us?
[36:32] And you know what? You mean everything
[36:34] to him. Amen. Isn't it wonderful to
[36:36] serve a God that paid the price on
[36:39] Calvary for every one of us to have the
[36:41] freedom to be able to come together and
[36:43] worship the Lord. You love the Lord
[36:44] tonight. Amen. How many say praise the
[36:47] Lord? Praise the Lord. Amen. Just sure
[36:50] good to be in the house of the Lord.
[36:51] Want to welcome everybody on a Wednesday
[36:53] night. Brother Andrew will be speaking
[36:55] for us. So, look forward to what God has
[36:57] in store for us tonight. And we just
[37:00] appreciate all that God does. Brother
[37:03] Wayne, God bless you. Come and
[37:04] fellowship with us for a couple days.
[37:06] And and we just certainly uh appreciate
[37:09] him being here and and uh we we thank
[37:12] God for all he does for us. Amen. And um
[37:15] I guess brother Ben announced the
[37:17] meeting or the picnic coming up and did
[37:19] he get everything right? It's a good
[37:21] deal. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless
[37:26] her.
[37:27] Amen. Amen. You love the Lord tonight.
[37:30] Amen. We I just love good people that
[37:33] have the liberty to come to church.
[37:35] Amen. You love everybody. Amen. If you

[37:38] don't love, go fix it real quick. Amen.
[37:41] We love everybody. Amen. We're just glad
[37:42] to be in the house of the Lord tonight.
[37:44] And want to remember brother Nathaniel
[37:47] asked prayer for his mom traveling down
[37:49] uh on Friday to come and visit. And also
[37:53] uh Charlotte had took a fever and ask
[37:55] for prayer for her tonight. If you have
[37:57] a need on your heart just let it be
[37:59] known by the uplift of your hand.
[38:01] Certainly God knows what we have need of
[38:03] tonight and just ask the Lord to come in
[38:05] special way and speak to our hearts
[38:07] tonight. Is that your prayer? Amen. Not
[38:09] just to come to church and and but we
[38:11] want to come have communion with the
[38:13] Lord. Amen. Not just to have fellowship
[38:15] with one another, but to have fellowship
[38:17] with him. That ought to be our prayer.
[38:18] Amen. So, let's just bow our heads
[38:20] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[38:23] Lord, what a privilege it is, Lord, to
[38:26] be able to come and just to fellowship,
[38:29] Lord, in this kind of an atmosphere,
[38:30] Lord. And God, how we have done our
[38:34] best, Lord, tonight to make you welcome
[38:36] among us. And Lord, I just thank you,
[38:39] Lord, for your mercy. And Lord, how that
[38:41] you overlook our mistakes and Lord, our
[38:44] our weaknesses that we have, but Lord,
[38:46] that you would come and fellowship under
[38:49] the blood of Jesus Christ, Lord, with
[38:52] your body of believers. And Lord, we
[38:55] just ask you that you would have your
[38:56] way in this service, Lord. I pray that
[38:58] you would touch each one, Lord, everyone
[39:00] that's sick that would be healed. And
[39:02] Lord, those that have a special need
[39:04] tonight, Lord, that you would meet their
[39:06] needs, Lord. And God, I pray that you
[39:08] would anoint our brother Andrew, Lord,
[39:09] as he comes. And Lord, just to be able
[39:12] to be able to speak to us, Lord. You
[39:14] know what we have need of, Lord. And
[39:16] we'll pull from the gift of God, Lord,
[39:18] that we can draw from heaven tonight,
[39:21] Lord. And we'll give you the glory for
[39:22] all you do for us. In Jesus name we
[39:25] pray. Amen. Amen. How many say amen?
[39:29] Amen. We just come to get something from
[39:32] the Lord. Amen. Can we sing that key of
[39:35] C?
[39:40] Light of the
[39:42] world. You stepped out into
[39:47] darkness. Open my eyes. Let me
[39:54] see the beauty that
[39:58] makes this heart adore you.
[40:03] Hope of a life spent with
[40:08] you. How many can sing it
[40:10] tonight? Oh, here I am to
[40:14] worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I
[40:20] am to say that you're my God.
[40:26] You're all together
[40:29] lovely, allto together
[40:32] worthy, allto together
[40:36] wonderful, wonderful to
[40:41] me. Oh king of
[40:44] all, so highly
[40:48] exalted. You're glorious in heaven
[40:52] above.
[40:54] Think about it now. Oh, how humbly that
[40:58] you came to this earth. You
[41:02] created and all for love's sake became
[41:07] more. So now we come tonight in response
[41:10] to that, brother Wesley. I say, here I
[41:13] am to worship, Lord. Here I am to bow
[41:18] down. Here I am to say that to say that
[41:23] you're my
[41:25] God. You're all together
[41:29] lovely. Allto together
[41:32] worthy. Allto together
[41:36] wonderful, wonderful to
[41:40] me. Oh, I say, King of all days, you're
[41:45] so highly
[41:47] exalted. You're glorious in heaven
[41:54] above. But then humbly you
[41:58] came to the earth you
[42:01] created and for the sake of love became
[42:08] more. So I
[42:11] say here I come to
[42:14] worship. Here I come to bow down. Here I
[42:19] come to say it to say that you're my
[42:24] God. You're all together
[42:28] lovely. All together
[42:32] worthy together.
[42:39] Oh, here I am to worship you.
[42:44] To bow down.
[42:46] I am.
[42:49] You're my
[42:51] God. You're all together
[42:55] love. All together.
[43:00] Oh yes, he
[43:02] is to me.
[43:07] How many can give him a hand clap of
[43:09] praise this evening? Amen. How many
[43:12] believes he's worthy? Amen. How many
[43:15] knows he's worthy? Amen. Amen. There's a
[43:19] difference in thinking something and
[43:20] knowing something. And tonight, we know
[43:22] that he is worthy of all of our praise,
[43:25] of everything that we are, and
[43:26] everything that we can give him. He's
[43:28] worthy of it all. Amen. Amen. I was
[43:30] hearing the prophet of God speaking
[43:32] today and he said, he said, "God's will
[43:34] is his word." And he said, "He always
[43:36] keeps his promises." He said, "It's his
[43:38] desire to manifest his promises." And I
[43:41] think here tonight it's his desire to
[43:42] manifest his promises to every
[43:44] individual that's in this building
[43:45] tonight. Whatever the need may be, how
[43:47] big, how small, it makes no difference.
[43:50] He's the God of our needs tonight. Let's
[43:51] approach him tonight. Heavenly Father,
[43:54] Lord, what an honor and a privilege it
[43:55] is to be gathered in your house tonight.
[43:58] Father, to pull away from the things of
[43:59] the world, to pull away from the cares
[44:01] of life, Lord, to shut in your presence
[44:04] for just a few moments, Lord. Father,
[44:06] we're so thankful for this opportunity
[44:08] that you've given us, Lord. Father,
[44:10] we're so thankful for this place that
[44:12] you've given us, Lord, to be able to
[44:14] come and to be able to worship you
[44:16] without any restrictions, Lord, without
[44:18] any hindrances, oh God. Lord, to just
[44:20] come into your presence and to be able
[44:22] to lift up the name that is above every
[44:24] name, Lord. That at that name, every
[44:26] knee would have to bow, every tongue
[44:28] would have to confess. And Lord, as we
[44:30] gather here tonight in this place of
[44:32] that we have called Grace Tabernacle.
[44:34] Lord, we're not just gathered in a
[44:36] building tonight or in a church, but
[44:37] Lord, we're gathered in you. And Lord,
[44:39] your prophet said that there is
[44:41] therefore now no condemnation to them
[44:43] that are in Christ Jesus. Lord, your
[44:45] prophet told us what a what a what a pre
[44:47] pleasure it is to be able to get into
[44:49] your presence and to begin to worship
[44:51] you until all the guilt and all the
[44:53] shame and all the condemnation falls
[44:55] away. And Lord, truly we sense a spirit
[44:58] of worship in the building tonight. And
[45:00] Lord, as we come now to this portion of
[45:02] the service, the preaching of your word,
[45:04] Father, we pray that you would dispatch
[45:06] angels of God into this building. Lord,
[45:08] as as your prophet told us, when the
[45:10] word begins to go forth, it's spiritual
[45:12] warfare. Now, Lord, I'm asking you, bind
[45:14] the hand of the enemy tonight. Lord, you
[45:17] see the needs that are here represented,
[45:19] maybe maybe sicknesses, diseases,
[45:21] whatever the needs may be. Oh God. Uh
[45:23] Lord, we stand here firm upon this
[45:25] promise that you're still Jehovah Gyra
[45:28] and you're able to do exceedingly and
[45:30] abundantly above all that we could ask
[45:31] or think. Father, forgive us of our
[45:34] failures and our shortcomings. Lord,
[45:36] Father, may this be more than just
[45:37] another Wednesday night gathering or
[45:39] service. But Lord, may it be an Emmas
[45:41] road walk. Lord, may it Lord, may hearts
[45:43] and lives be changed and transformed by
[45:46] your presence. For Father, we commit
[45:48] this meeting tonight in thy faithful
[45:49] hands. Bless everyone that's in our
[45:51] gates tonight. But we ask in Jesus
[45:53] Christ's name we pray and all the
[45:55] believers says amen and amen. God bless
[45:59] you all this evening. It is a an honor
[46:01] to be home and to be speaking to you
[46:03] tonight. It's been a few days since
[46:05] we've seen you and spoke to you. And we
[46:07] do thank brother Matt, our pastor, for
[46:08] this invitation and opportunity tonight
[46:10] to speak to you from the word of the
[46:12] Lord. And amen, it is an honor to be
[46:14] here. And amen, real special to have
[46:15] brother Wayne here with us tonight. God
[46:17] bless you, brother Wayne. We sure love
[46:19] and appreciate Brother Wayne and his
[46:20] stand for this message. And I'll say
[46:22] this, Brother Wayne's been more than
[46:24] just a a preacher friend to me, but he's
[46:26] been like a dad to me and a real help
[46:28] and a real spiritual blessing in my
[46:30] life. And I sure love and appreciate the
[46:32] man of God. How many appreciates,
[46:33] Brother Wayne? Amen. God bless you,
[46:35] buddy. I sure love you. Amen. Years and
[46:38] years standing faithful on this message
[46:40] and never change one bit. We appreciate
[46:42] that. Amen. If you have your Bibles
[46:44] tonight, we want to go to the word of
[46:46] the Lord, the book of Job. The book of
[46:48] Job, the 19th chapter. And it just is a
[46:51] real honor, as I said, to speak to you
[46:52] tonight. And I do want to say that it
[46:54] was been a I guess we haven't seen
[46:56] brother Matt since we was at the tent
[46:58] meetings together there in Virginia. But
[47:00] I tell you what, if you hadn't heard his
[47:01] sermon, it was a powerful sermon. I
[47:03] never was so glad in all my life to be a
[47:05] believer when he was talking about the
[47:07] healer, the believer, and the Pharisee.
[47:09] Amen. It's such a such a blessing to be
[47:11] identified as believers tonight. Amen.
[47:14] Amen. We want to look here in the book
[47:15] of Job the 19th chapter and then also
[47:18] Proverbs in another place in first
[47:20] Peter. Amen. We want to look here
[47:22] tonight and God bless you to everyone
[47:24] that's here and visitors. God bless you
[47:25] all. Job chapter 19 and verse
[47:29] 23. He says, "Oh, that my words were now
[47:33] written. Oh that they were printed in a
[47:35] book that they were graven with an iron
[47:38] pen and led in the rock forever. For I
[47:42] know that my redeemer liveth. I read one
[47:46] translation of that today and it said, I
[47:48] know my redeemer and vindicator. All
[47:50] right. Liveth, and that he shall stand
[47:53] at the latter day upon the earth. And
[47:56] though after my skin worms destroy this
[47:58] body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.
[48:02] Brother Ram called that that immortal
[48:03] flesh. Whom I shall see for myself, and
[48:07] mine eyes shall behold and not another.
[48:10] What a promise, brother David. We're
[48:12] going to see him. Amen. Not another, but
[48:14] our God. Though my reigns be consumed
[48:18] within me. Now, in the book of Proverbs,
[48:20] chapter 29, Proverbs chapter 29, it's a
[48:24] very familiar reading. I I use it a lot
[48:27] and I call it one of my favorite verses
[48:30] because it's so true. Proverbs 29 and
[48:32] verse number 18 says, "Where there is no
[48:36] vision, the people perish, but he that
[48:40] keepeth the law, happy is he." Where
[48:43] there is no vision, one translation
[48:45] says, "No revelation of God and his
[48:48] word, the people perish, but he that
[48:51] keepeth the law, happy is he." And one
[48:54] of the place I want to look is first
[48:55] Peter chapter 1. 1 Peter chapter 1 and
[49:00] verse number number number eight. 1
[49:02] Peter chapter 1 and verse number eight.
[49:04] Peter here writing. I've just really
[49:07] been feeding up on these verses lately.
[49:09] Of whom having not seen ye love and whom
[49:13] though now ye see him not, yet believing
[49:16] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[49:19] of glory. receiving the end of your
[49:21] faith, even the salvation of your souls,
[49:25] of which salvation the prophets have
[49:27] inquired, and searched diligently, who
[49:30] prophesied of the grace that should come
[49:32] unto you. So, this is not just any kind
[49:34] of grace. This is prophetic grace. Verse
[49:37] 11. Searching what or what manner of
[49:39] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[49:42] them did signify when it testified
[49:46] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[49:48] the glory that should follow. unto whom
[49:51] it was revealed that not unto
[49:54] themselves, but unto us they did
[49:56] minister the things which are now
[49:59] reported unto you by them that have
[50:01] preached the gospel unto you with the
[50:03] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven. I love
[50:06] this. Which things the angels desire to
[50:10] look into. Wherefore gird up the loins
[50:13] of your mind. be sober in hope to the
[50:16] end for the grace that is to be brought
[50:18] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[50:21] Christ. Amen. In the in the Amplified
[50:24] Bible that verse 13 says, "So prepare
[50:26] your minds for action. Be completely
[50:28] sober in spirit, steadfast,
[50:31] self-disciplined, spiritually and
[50:33] morally alert. Fix your hope completely
[50:35] on the grace of God that is coming to
[50:38] you when Jesus Christ is revealed." We
[50:41] ask Lord this evening to have the
[50:43] blessing of the reading of his word. As
[50:44] you can have your seat here this
[50:45] evening. I want to by the help of the
[50:48] Lord tonight if I would if I would take
[50:50] a title. I want to speak to you on this.
[50:52] We have a vindicated forecast. We have a
[50:56] vindicated forecast. Brother Brandham in
[50:58] 1955 preaches a sermon and he calls it
[51:01] my redeemer liveth. And I just want to
[51:03] read a portion of this. It's a maybe a
[51:05] little bit of a lengthy reading but just
[51:07] stay with me. I think brother Brandham
[51:08] says it so beautifully here. He says, "I
[51:10] think of Job, the one we're reading of a
[51:12] few moments ago." He said, "Now, he
[51:14] looked forward to this morning." Now,
[51:16] here he is in 1955, and he's going all
[51:20] the way back to Job, and he's saying,
[51:22] "Job, looked forward to this morning."
[51:24] He looked forward all the way to 1955.
[51:27] He said, "When he was old, he was
[51:29] stricken in age. His flesh was simply
[51:31] falling from his body from soores. His
[51:34] heart was broken in grief and every
[51:36] mortal part of his being was withering
[51:39] away. He said, "But here he was at his
[51:42] wits end." Anybody ever been there? Here
[51:44] he was at his wits end. Everything was
[51:46] gone seemingly. His body was gone. His
[51:49] property was gone. His children was
[51:51] gone. All that he had was gone. He said,
[51:53] "But then God in his mercy come down to
[51:56] Job and he give him another sense."
[52:00] Amen. God in his mercy come down to Job
[52:03] and he give him another sense that he
[52:06] could open his eyes and he could see the
[52:08] day that there would be a body he would
[52:10] receive. He knew there was coming one, a
[52:13] just one who would stand in his place
[52:15] who would raise up the body of the dead.
[52:17] And so he cried, "I know that my
[52:20] redeemer liveth." He said, "If today we
[52:22] only have, amen, a a cross on top of the
[52:25] church to show," he said, "which that's
[52:27] all right, that we believe in Christ's
[52:29] death, burial, resurrection, if we only
[52:31] have a few dead bodies of dust laying
[52:33] under the church that some of the
[52:34] saintly people were buried in. We only
[52:36] have that as a hope." Amen. Then we're
[52:38] among all people most miserable. He
[52:41] said, "But today, how thankful that we
[52:43] are that we don't just have the dead
[52:45] bodies, but we have the resurrected
[52:48] spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he
[52:50] rose from the dead triumphant." Amen.
[52:53] When Job cried out those words, "I know
[52:56] my redeemer liveth," he said he was
[52:58] moving from the negative side of things
[53:00] unto the positive side of things. He
[53:02] said, "It's no more, I guess so." Amen.
[53:05] You could look at a cross and say, "I
[53:07] guess so." You could look at a body
[53:09] laying in the ground and say, "I guess
[53:10] so." Amen. Or I hope so. But when the
[53:13] vision, amen, has struck Job become a
[53:16] reality. Amen. The resurrection of the
[53:18] Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit in the
[53:21] heart. Amen. Then you got it. And you
[53:23] can say, "Amen. I know my redeemer
[53:26] live." If all the shadows has faded
[53:28] away, all the old darkness of hope so
[53:31] and maybe so. And we trust it'll be that
[53:33] way. It's all faded away to anybody that
[53:37] has ever made their heart a separate of
[53:39] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I'll tell
[53:42] you what Job received. He received new
[53:44] hope. And brother said that's this new
[53:46] hope that God has placed into our hearts
[53:49] today. Amen. This new assurance. It's
[53:52] not a hope so. It's a no. He said it's a
[53:55] hope to those who are looking forward.
[53:57] Amen. To the time. Amen. See, after we
[54:00] are risen with him, we have been given
[54:02] the commission. Amen. go into all the
[54:04] world and bring these tidings to the
[54:06] other. So we find here that Job 4,000
[54:10] years, Amen. before the coming of the
[54:12] son of God. Amen. Job by a vision, amen,
[54:16] saw the resurrection. It was 4,000 years
[54:19] ahead of him. Amen. But by a vision he
[54:22] could see the resurrection. Now, what I
[54:25] love about this is he did not just see
[54:27] the vision of the resurrection. Amen.
[54:30] But he received assurance. Amen. by the
[54:32] vision that he was going to be there
[54:34] when this great event took place. Amen.
[54:37] Amen. I'll say it is a joy to my heart
[54:39] tonight to know that we're not just
[54:41] reading the vision. Amen. And hoping
[54:44] we're going to be a part of these
[54:45] things. Amen. Guessing we're going to be
[54:47] there. Amen. But we have received a more
[54:50] sure word of prophecy wherein we can
[54:52] testify tonight. Amen. That a settled
[54:55] asurances in our heart. Amen. That we're
[54:57] going to be there. Amen. Because it's
[55:00] more than just a reading. It's more than
[55:02] just a suggestion. Here's what I
[55:04] believe. Amen. I believe Job received a
[55:07] forecast. Amen. When you look there at
[55:09] that word forecast, it's a prophecy.
[55:11] It's an estimate or a prediction. Amen.
[55:14] Of future happenings or the condition.
[55:17] Amen. That they're going to happen in.
[55:19] It means to predict or a future event.
[55:21] Amen. To indicate is likely to occur. I
[55:24] love this. It means to calculate the
[55:26] future. Amen. Another word there for
[55:29] forecast is vision. And the prophet of
[55:31] God would say, "What is a vision?" See,
[55:34] it's the forecast of future events. It
[55:37] foretells the thing. Amen. Before it
[55:40] happens, he said, "See, that's why a
[55:42] prophet is not born and then he becomes
[55:45] a prophet." He said, "But he's already a
[55:47] prophet when he's born." Amen. The gift
[55:50] to be a prophet is in him. Amen. Before
[55:52] he's even born, he said, "So what is a
[55:55] vision then? It's the word of God or
[55:57] something foretold. It's a forecast of
[56:00] an event and a vision that the prophets
[56:02] had. Amen. Jesus had and Paul had and
[56:05] all of them. Amen. They tell of this
[56:07] day. Amen. Was a forecast of what would
[56:10] happen. And here we see the forecast
[56:14] being made manifest and people don't
[56:16] even recognize it. Listen, we're not
[56:18] living in the days where God is writing
[56:20] the Bible. We are living in the days
[56:22] where God is fulfilling, amen, what has
[56:25] already been wrote. That's why we're not
[56:27] here tonight praying God send a message.
[56:30] We have already received a message and
[56:33] that message is more than a suggestion.
[56:35] It is more than an opinion. It is more
[56:37] than a religious idea. It is a
[56:40] vindicated vision from almighty God that
[56:43] has come through his ordained channel of
[56:45] a prophet. Listen, brother Bam stood
[56:47] there and he said, "Here I am preaching
[56:48] these seven church ages." He said, "Now
[56:51] I'll say this." Amen. The seven church
[56:53] ages is the pattern. Amen. for the
[56:56] forecast of all that God, Amen, was
[56:58] going to do for the churches. Amen. And
[57:01] through the churches, Amen. God was not
[57:03] just going to do something for the
[57:05] churches. He was going to do something
[57:07] through the churches. And he was going
[57:10] to positionally set them up. Amen.
[57:12] That's why, Amen. In the Old Testament,
[57:14] you will read these words. Amen. Thus
[57:17] saith the Lord. It's recorded in there
[57:19] about 2,000 times. I love what Brother
[57:22] says. If a man says, "Thus sayaith the
[57:24] Lord," it's not the man talking.
[57:28] If he would, then he wouldn't be a
[57:30] prophet. He'd be a hypocrite because it
[57:32] would never come to pass. There is one
[57:34] chance out of 1000,000 times, amen, that
[57:38] they might guess it. But if it's thus
[57:40] sayaith the Lord, the Lord God has said
[57:43] it. Amen. If it's thus sayaith the Lord,
[57:46] it's not the Lord has guessed it. Amen.
[57:48] Or the preacher has felt it. Amen. But
[57:51] it's the Lord has said it. And he said,
[57:53] "So the Bible, Amen, is thus saith the
[57:56] Lord by the prophets." Amen. They took
[57:58] Christ's spirit upon themselves. And
[58:01] what they did was they forecast, amen,
[58:03] the events that would come to pass. He
[58:05] said, "Talk about forecast." They said
[58:08] what would take place down to the ages
[58:10] as they sat and they stood, they laid,
[58:12] and they walked with Christ. Amen. upon
[58:15] them in so much that they acted like
[58:17] Christ. He said, "And the readers would
[58:19] read it and they would think that the
[58:21] prophets, amen, was actually speaking of
[58:24] themselves." But can I let you in on a
[58:26] little secret tonight? They were not
[58:28] speaking so much of themselves. Amen.
[58:30] They were speaking of you. Amen. Amen. A
[58:32] beautiful example. Paul said, "Amen.
[58:34] That we'll not all die, but we shall be
[58:36] alive and remain and we shall be
[58:38] changed." Amen. But none of them people
[58:40] that heard Paul say that, Amen. are
[58:42] alive tonight. Amen. Listen, that don't
[58:45] mean it was false prophecy. It means
[58:47] there's somebody going to fulfill it.
[58:49] And I happen to be looking tonight at
[58:51] the people that is alive and remain
[58:54] until the coming of the Lord. Amen. They
[58:56] were not speaking about themselves. They
[58:58] were speaking about you because what was
[59:00] happening is they were being moved by
[59:03] the Holy Ghost. Brother said, "See, look
[59:05] in second Peter 1. For the prophecy came
[59:08] not in old time, amen, by the will of
[59:10] man, but holy men of God spake as they
[59:14] were moved by the Holy Ghost. Amen. I
[59:17] love that word moved. It means to move
[59:19] by bearing. It means to be conveyed or
[59:22] to born. It means with the suggestion of
[59:24] force or speed. I love this. It is to
[59:27] transport. Amen. Persons born in a ship
[59:31] over the sea. Amen. To move by a gust of
[59:33] wind. I love this one, Brother Matt. to
[59:36] be moved inwardly. Amen. When they were
[59:38] moved, they were not being moved
[59:40] outwardly, but they were being moved
[59:42] inwardly. Amen. To bring forward in
[59:45] speech. So, what was moving them on the
[59:47] inside you are reading in the Bible
[59:50] called the holy word of God. That's why
[59:52] it's more than just a sermon. It's a
[59:54] prophecy. Amen. A prophecy foretell the
[59:57] future events. It's the divine mind.
[1:00:00] Amen. To which the prophetic faculty is
[1:00:03] due. Brother says it beautiful. Amen.
[1:00:05] And prophecy, if it's true word of God,
[1:00:09] it cannot fail. Amen. Can we just Can we
[1:00:12] just get that out there and establish it
[1:00:14] right now? If it's the true word of God
[1:00:16] and the Lord has said thus, and it has
[1:00:19] been called prophecy, Amen. It cannot
[1:00:22] fail. As a matter of fact, heavens and
[1:00:24] earth will pass away before one of these
[1:00:26] words fall. Amen. God is able these
[1:00:29] stones to rise children unto Abraham.
[1:00:31] Listen, folks, this is more than just a
[1:00:33] man. Amen. This is a prophecy. It's a
[1:00:36] forecast and it's a vision. When you
[1:00:38] think there that word forecast, of
[1:00:40] course, you know, amen, there's a
[1:00:41] natural forecast. Amen. And there's a
[1:00:44] spiritual forecast. Amen. And when we
[1:00:46] think of the word forecast,
[1:00:47] automatically, amen, our minds carry us,
[1:00:50] amen, to the weather forecast, amen. And
[1:00:53] I found it amazing in the Bible that the
[1:00:55] Bible actually speaks, amen, of the
[1:00:57] weather forecast. In Matthew 16 and Luke
[1:01:00] 12, it says that you can discern, Amen,
[1:01:03] the face of the skies, Amen. But you
[1:01:05] cannot discern the signs of the time.
[1:01:08] Amen. When the Bible speaks of a weather
[1:01:10] forecast, it is dealing with the
[1:01:12] ability, amen, to forecast the weather,
[1:01:15] amen, but lack spiritual discernment. So
[1:01:18] they can tell you when it's going to
[1:01:20] rain. They can tell you when it's going
[1:01:21] to snow. They can tell you when it's
[1:01:23] going to sun is going to shine and when
[1:01:25] the clouds are going to gather, but they
[1:01:27] lack spiritual discernment. Amen. And
[1:01:29] I'll say this to you tonight. Amen. As
[1:01:31] the elected overcomers of this age,
[1:01:34] amen. We must have the discernment of
[1:01:37] spirit if we're going to overcome Leoa
[1:01:40] and find ourselves in a rapture.
[1:01:42] Spiritual discernment is not a
[1:01:44] suggestion. It is a commandment. That's
[1:01:48] why Paul said, "Amen, that the natural
[1:01:50] man, he receiveth not the things of the
[1:01:53] spirit of God, for they are foolish unto
[1:01:55] him, and neither can he know them."
[1:01:57] Somebody say, "Know them." Know them.
[1:02:00] Because they are spiritually discerned.
[1:02:02] That word spiritually is by the aid of
[1:02:05] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Discern. I love
[1:02:07] this. It means to estimate. It means to
[1:02:10] determine. Amen. The excellence or the
[1:02:13] defects of any person or thing. Brother
[1:02:16] Ram comes along and says we have an
[1:02:17] order from God is for the discerning of
[1:02:20] spirit. Amen. He don't say believe every
[1:02:22] spirit. He says try the spirit. I
[1:02:26] believe that's a very great lesson.
[1:02:27] Amen. Have discernment of spirit. We are
[1:02:30] to discern by the spirit to find the
[1:02:33] excellence of the thing or to find the
[1:02:35] defect of it. Amen. Every behind
[1:02:38] everything there is a spirit. Right?
[1:02:40] Amen. There's either an excellence.
[1:02:42] Amen. Or there's a defect. And I'll say
[1:02:44] this. That's why we must live by the
[1:02:47] word. Amen. In the spirit. Somebody say,
[1:02:50] "Well, we just live by the word." No,
[1:02:51] you can't just do that. You got to live
[1:02:53] by the word, but you got to do it in the
[1:02:56] spirit. That's why John said, "Beloved,
[1:02:58] believe not every spirit, but try the
[1:03:01] spirits whether they are of God because
[1:03:04] many false prophets are gone out into
[1:03:06] the world." I love what Paul says to
[1:03:08] Timothy. He says they'll have a form of
[1:03:11] godliness, but they will deny the power
[1:03:14] thereof. Now, watch what he says. From
[1:03:16] such, amen, turn away. Brother said,
[1:03:19] Paul promised in the last day by the
[1:03:21] Holy Spirit that the church would fall
[1:03:24] away, millions of them, listen here,
[1:03:26] there'll come a falling away. That's
[1:03:28] what Paul said thousands of years ago.
[1:03:31] And we're living in the manifestation of
[1:03:34] the falling away. Amen. They'll be
[1:03:36] heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure
[1:03:38] more than lovers of God. He said,
[1:03:40] "Despisers of those that are good."
[1:03:43] Amen. Not the right discernment. How
[1:03:45] many's thankful for a prophet? He said,
[1:03:47] "Well, you say that's communist." He
[1:03:49] said, "No, that's so-called Christians."
[1:03:51] He said, "No power thereof." Amen. No
[1:03:54] spiritual discernment. Because when you
[1:03:56] got spiritual discernment and the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost is upon you, then you have
[1:04:01] spiritual discernment. And it says,
[1:04:03] "Amen." I love that. It takes it beyond
[1:04:05] you. Amen. To it says amen to every
[1:04:09] promise of God. Amen. Paul said those
[1:04:11] days would be. He says, "And we got it.
[1:04:14] It's here. It's on us. We look and see
[1:04:17] it." He says, "We hear it from
[1:04:19] everywhere. And what do we do? It ought
[1:04:21] to draw us together." I'll say this,
[1:04:24] folks. It's time to forget manmade
[1:04:27] theology and cry out to God for
[1:04:30] spiritual power and spiritual
[1:04:32] discernment. The lid has come off of
[1:04:35] hell. Demon powers are invading this
[1:04:37] world. Listen, the devil has one task
[1:04:40] and that is to conquer this bride. But I
[1:04:42] want to put that devil on notice
[1:04:44] tonight. There is a bride on the face of
[1:04:46] the earth that has receive the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost. And she has been given the
[1:04:50] ability by the spirit to discern the
[1:04:53] excellency or to discern the defect of
[1:04:55] it. And we do not have to believe
[1:04:57] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:05:00] God.
[1:05:01] That's why Jesus said in Luke 17:30,
[1:05:04] "Amen, that the conditions of Sodom and
[1:05:06] Gomorrah would return." Amen. When would
[1:05:09] they return, brother Joel, they would
[1:05:11] return in the day when the son of man
[1:05:13] would be revealed. Oh, church of the
[1:05:15] living God, we're not looking for the
[1:05:17] day when the son of man will be
[1:05:19] revealed. We are looking at the
[1:05:22] revealing of the son of man. Jesus said,
[1:05:26] "As it was in the days of Sodom." Now,
[1:05:28] amen. Thank God for a prophet. He said
[1:05:30] the police and the homicides is just all
[1:05:33] the time. Amen. Breaking up boys living
[1:05:35] together as husband and wife. Women
[1:05:37] living the same way. He said perverted.
[1:05:40] Amen. Their minds are filthy. Now why
[1:05:43] are their minds filthy? Because they
[1:05:45] don't have spiritual discernment. He
[1:05:48] said all is a lust and a filth and they
[1:05:50] can't satisfy themselves with one
[1:05:52] another. He said they don't even marry.
[1:05:54] They just take up go out until they're
[1:05:55] perverted. And Jesus said that it would
[1:05:58] be in the last days. Now, how many
[1:06:01] theologians had read Luke 17:30? How
[1:06:04] many reformers had read Luke 17:30? And
[1:06:07] they all said, "Amen." Jesus said that
[1:06:09] those conditions will return. But listen
[1:06:12] to it tonight. It took a prophet to say,
[1:06:15] "And here it is." So, he moved beyond
[1:06:17] just its coming. Amen. To hear it is. It
[1:06:21] took a prophet to get the revelation.
[1:06:23] Amen. I'll say this. Spiritual
[1:06:25] discernment is not guessing something is
[1:06:28] right. Amen. It's knowing what is right
[1:06:30] and it is knowing what is wrong. Amen.
[1:06:33] Brother B said, "Look at what Jesus
[1:06:35] said." He said, "You shall know the
[1:06:37] truth." Amen. And the truth shall make
[1:06:39] you free. He said, "If you see God's
[1:06:41] word and still don't think it's the
[1:06:43] truth, then there's something wrong with
[1:06:45] your spiritual discernment." Any man
[1:06:48] could read a newspaper if he's got any
[1:06:50] spiritual discernment about him at all
[1:06:52] and he can see that we're at the end.
[1:06:55] Listen to a prophet. The hour is here.
[1:06:58] There is nothing left for us. Amen. But
[1:07:00] the coming of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:07:03] Somebody say, "Well, there's a revival
[1:07:05] coming." Listen, the revival is here.
[1:07:07] Amen. There's a there's a man going to
[1:07:09] change America. Listen, that's why the
[1:07:11] prophet said, "Amen. I feel like
[1:07:13] preaching." He said, "You could put a
[1:07:14] George Washington on every corner and an
[1:07:17] Abraham Lincoln, too, and you will never
[1:07:19] turn this nation around because she's
[1:07:22] been found in the balances." And she's
[1:07:24] been found wanting. But unto you that
[1:07:26] have spiritual discernment, you can turn
[1:07:28] to Luke 17:30. You can turn to Matthew
[1:07:31] 24 and you can see when these things
[1:07:33] begin to come to pass, that ain't the
[1:07:35] time to pull off your praise. That ain't
[1:07:37] the time to pull back on your worship.
[1:07:39] That ain't a time to pull back on
[1:07:40] serving God. That's the time to kick in
[1:07:43] because lift up your head. Your
[1:07:45] redemption is drawing nigh. There's a
[1:07:48] rapture coming. There's a resurrection
[1:07:50] coming. The forecast has already been
[1:07:52] given and you've already been seen in
[1:07:55] it.
[1:07:57] Yes, sir. You say, "Well, that'll be a
[1:07:59] thousand years from today." He said, "I
[1:08:01] don't believe that." He said, "I believe
[1:08:03] this generation, this generation will
[1:08:06] see the coming of the Lord Jesus. And if
[1:08:10] this generation doesn't do it, oh my. He
[1:08:13] said, I want to preach to the young
[1:08:14] people. Somebody say, "Amen. Preach to
[1:08:17] the young people. You're wasting your
[1:08:18] time." I beg to differ with you. And
[1:08:21] I'll say this. I don't think our young
[1:08:22] people are the church of tomorrow or the
[1:08:25] church of next week or the church of two
[1:08:27] years down the road. I happen to believe
[1:08:30] that our young people are the church of
[1:08:32] today. Amen. Tomorrow is gone and
[1:08:36] hallelujah. Yesterday is gone and
[1:08:38] tomorrow is not promised. But today is a
[1:08:41] day of salvation. Then let us sew
[1:08:43] something in their souls that is more
[1:08:45] than just a feeling. It is more than
[1:08:47] just a sensation. But it is a discerning
[1:08:50] spirit of almighty God to stand the
[1:08:52] demons of the age they're living in.
[1:08:55] Yes, sir. I want to preach to the young
[1:08:57] people. Listen, brother Bam, why do you
[1:08:59] want to preach to the young people? So
[1:09:01] that they'll be looking for it in their
[1:09:03] generation.
[1:09:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Cuz the fig tree
[1:09:07] is putting forth its buds and this
[1:09:09] generation will not pass until all these
[1:09:13] things be fulfilled. Amen. I love that
[1:09:16] quote. Amen. I want to preach to the
[1:09:19] young people. Brother David, I want to
[1:09:21] build up a spiritual expectation. Amen.
[1:09:24] I want to give a spiritual forecast to
[1:09:26] the young people. I want to tell them
[1:09:28] that the lid has come off of hell. I
[1:09:30] want to tell them that Sodom and
[1:09:32] Gomorrah has returned. I want to tell
[1:09:34] them that everything has become a lust
[1:09:36] and a filth. I want to tell them, amen,
[1:09:38] that hell has invaded the United States
[1:09:40] of America. But at the same time, I want
[1:09:43] to tell them that there is a message in
[1:09:45] the last days that has come for the
[1:09:47] fulfilling of the revealing of the word
[1:09:49] of God. Listen folks, a prophet has
[1:09:52] already been here and he's already
[1:09:54] revealed the book of Revelation. We
[1:09:56] already know what the lamb's book of
[1:09:57] life is. But praise God, we know our
[1:10:00] name is in it. And there ain't no devil
[1:10:03] can take it out. There ain't no devil
[1:10:05] put it in. And there ain't no devil can
[1:10:07] take it out.
[1:10:09] I've got a revelation in my soul by a
[1:10:12] vindicated vision of God, I'm going to
[1:10:14] be there. Come hell or high water, I'm
[1:10:16] going to be there. Come trouble or no,
[1:10:18] come sickness or whatever, we've already
[1:10:21] been seen there just as Job was.
[1:10:25] Hallelujah. I can speak to the young
[1:10:27] people tonight and I can say 1
[1:10:28] Thessalonians 4 does not only include a
[1:10:31] prophet, it includes you.
[1:10:34] I can speak to every believer in this
[1:10:36] building tonight and I can tell you what
[1:10:38] the Bible says. There will be some who
[1:10:40] is alive
[1:10:43] and they will be remaining. I love that
[1:10:46] word alive. Brother Mark, that word
[1:10:48] alive means fresh.
[1:10:50] Brother Ram said, "If you fall asleep in
[1:10:52] that watch, then you'll wake up with
[1:10:54] them same anticipations." He said, "When
[1:10:56] Martin Luther wakes, amen, St. Paul
[1:10:59] awakes in the resurrection, it'll be
[1:11:01] just as fresh as if they was right in
[1:11:03] the battle." Amen. Patting right away
[1:11:05] cuz they went right down under those
[1:11:07] same anticipations. What was their
[1:11:09] anticipation? They were looking for the
[1:11:12] coming of the Lord. He said, "We got to
[1:11:14] be looking for him right now. Even we
[1:11:17] don't know it could be possible. It
[1:11:19] could be a hundred years from now. It
[1:11:21] could be 500 years, a thousand years,
[1:11:23] 10,000 years. I don't know. Nobody
[1:11:26] knows. But say for instance, we lived
[1:11:28] each day that he was coming in that day.
[1:11:31] See, if we live like he was coming this
[1:11:33] day when we awake, if we sleep and we
[1:11:36] awake in the resurrection, oh church,
[1:11:39] it'll be just as fresh as if we just
[1:11:42] fallen asleep. We're just going to wake
[1:11:45] up. Oh, God. Hey, I feel like shouting
[1:11:47] on that. Amen. One of these mornings
[1:11:50] between 6 and 9, our prophet is going to
[1:11:52] awaken out of sleep. And he's not going
[1:11:54] to wake up still and looking back a
[1:11:57] hundred years. He's going to wake up
[1:11:58] with the same freshness that he had when
[1:12:00] he closed his ministry and said there's
[1:12:02] a rapture and there's things that are to
[1:12:04] be and there's leadership and there's a
[1:12:07] communion coming. Oh, may their
[1:12:09] expectations of God be arrested in the
[1:12:12] church of God that we'll live every day
[1:12:14] with our minds fixed.
[1:12:16] Yes, sir. until he comes. We want to
[1:12:18] live each day like he might come the
[1:12:20] next minute because it might be the end
[1:12:23] of your life. Amen. I'll say what a
[1:12:25] prophet said. He said, "God promised."
[1:12:28] Amen. This is not a this is not a a a a
[1:12:31] goodwill word. God promised in the last
[1:12:35] days. He said God promised. I love this.
[1:12:38] Promised prophets. Amen. Amen. Promised
[1:12:42] prophets in the last days. Now, I can
[1:12:44] show that to you in Exodus 23:20. He
[1:12:47] said, "Behold, I send an angel before
[1:12:48] thee." Amen. To keep thee in the way.
[1:12:51] Look here at the forecast. And to bring
[1:12:53] thee into the place which I have
[1:12:55] prepared. In Malachi 4, behold, I God
[1:12:59] will send you, Andrew Glover.
[1:13:02] I just went ahead and put my name there.
[1:13:04] Amen. I will send you Elijah the
[1:13:07] prophet, William Brandom, before the
[1:13:08] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:13:10] the Lord. Now, watch the forecast. He's
[1:13:13] not just sending a prophet, but he's
[1:13:15] going to do something. And he shall turn
[1:13:17] the heart of the fathers to the
[1:13:19] children, and the heart of the children
[1:13:22] to their fathers, lest thou come and
[1:13:24] smite the earth with a curse. Ephesians
[1:13:26] 4:11. Amen. He's going to give some
[1:13:28] apostles and some prophets and some
[1:13:31] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:13:33] teachers. Now, watch the forecast. for
[1:13:35] the perfecting of the saints, for the
[1:13:38] work of the ministry, for the edifying
[1:13:40] of the body of Christ, till we all come
[1:13:42] in the unity of the faith and of the
[1:13:44] knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
[1:13:47] perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:13:49] stature of the fullness of Christ, that
[1:13:52] we henceforth be no more children,
[1:13:55] tossed to and fro, now watch here, and
[1:13:58] carried about with every wind of
[1:14:00] doctrine, by the slate of men, and
[1:14:02] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in
[1:14:05] wait to deceive. Amen. I love this,
[1:14:07] brother Wayne. But speaking the truth in
[1:14:09] love.
[1:14:11] That's a forecast, church. But speaking
[1:14:14] the truth in love may grow up into him
[1:14:16] in all things which is the head, even
[1:14:20] Christ. Amen. If a man comes and he has
[1:14:22] a great gift says if he no matter if he
[1:14:25] belongs to our denomination or another
[1:14:27] denomination, you don't judge him by
[1:14:30] what denomination he come from, how he
[1:14:32] dresses. But what you want to see is
[1:14:35] what he's trying to do with that gift,
[1:14:37] what purpose he has. If he's trying to
[1:14:40] take his influence and build himself a
[1:14:43] great name out of it, he said, I would
[1:14:46] have discernment of spirit enough, amen,
[1:14:48] to know that that's wrong. He said, "No
[1:14:51] matter how great a teacher he is, how
[1:14:53] powerful he is, how intellectual he is,
[1:14:55] or how his gift operates, if he isn't
[1:14:59] trying to achieve something for the
[1:15:00] benefit of the body of Christ,
[1:15:04] then your own spiritual discernment,
[1:15:07] Brother Brian would tell you that's
[1:15:08] wrong." No matter how accurate, how
[1:15:11] perfect, how it is, it's wrong if it
[1:15:14] isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:16] I say thank God we have received a sound
[1:15:20] spiritual discernment on the judging of
[1:15:22] gifts in the church. Listen, not behind
[1:15:24] every gift is a spirit of excellency.
[1:15:26] Amen. Sometimes accompany those gifts
[1:15:28] are a spirit of defection. But thank God
[1:15:31] we've got a message of the hour. We've
[1:15:33] got a year a thumb. We don't have to
[1:15:35] believe every gift and follow every
[1:15:37] spirit that comes to the door. We can
[1:15:39] stand on the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] because grace has come unto us. And when
[1:15:44] this grace come, it brought a stability.
[1:15:47] It brought authority. It brought our
[1:15:49] minds into action to withstand, amen,
[1:15:52] the demons of hell that's trying to
[1:15:53] conquer this bride. Yes, sir. Amen. I'll
[1:15:56] say this. Amen. Look at Joshua. How many
[1:15:58] knows there was a Moses? Amen. How many
[1:16:00] knows there was a Joshua? Amen. There
[1:16:03] was a Moses they came out under. Amen.
[1:16:05] Brother Wayne preached that Bible
[1:16:06] conference a few years ago. And there
[1:16:08] was a Joshua generation. There was a
[1:16:11] Joshua that took them in. There was a
[1:16:13] Moses brought them out. Brother Xavier,
[1:16:15] there was a Joshua that took them in.
[1:16:18] Let me say this. Joshua, brother called
[1:16:20] him the new leader. I love this. He said
[1:16:23] he positionally placed the tribes of
[1:16:25] Israel and he divided the land of
[1:16:28] inheritance. Now, how did he do it? Did
[1:16:30] he do it because he had seen Moses? Did
[1:16:33] he do it because him and Moses sat on a
[1:16:35] log somewhere and Moses shared some
[1:16:37] things with him? No. He did it by
[1:16:40] spiritual discernment. He said, "Now
[1:16:43] watch. And there they remained in their
[1:16:45] place." Hallelujah. And they became the
[1:16:49] cream of the crop. So Joshua did not use
[1:16:52] his ability as the new leader. Amen. To
[1:16:55] build himself up. He used his God-given
[1:16:58] ability as the new leader to positionly
[1:17:01] place the generation in the land of
[1:17:04] inheritance. And there they became the
[1:17:06] cream of the crop. I say thank God for
[1:17:08] men like Matt Morris. Thank God for men
[1:17:11] like Wayne Lawson and Joel Reynold and
[1:17:12] all these other preachers that are not
[1:17:14] using their gifts to build the people up
[1:17:17] and to put the people's faith in
[1:17:19] themselves, but they're building the
[1:17:21] people up. And they're saying, "Now,
[1:17:22] whatever you do, you put your faith in
[1:17:25] this message. You stay in this message.
[1:17:27] And if I say anything contrary to this
[1:17:29] message, you stay with the message and
[1:17:32] forsake what I said." Come on. We're not
[1:17:34] talking about another church age coming.
[1:17:36] There's not another church age in the
[1:17:38] forecast. The next thing is the changing
[1:17:41] of our bodies. The next thing is the
[1:17:44] changing from mortality
[1:17:46] to immortality. Listen. Spiritual
[1:17:49] discernment. Amen. Is spiritual
[1:17:51] revelation of God. That's what Joshua
[1:17:54] did. Watch in Matthew 16. He said,
[1:17:57] "Flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:17:59] to you. You never learned it through
[1:18:01] educational line. You never learned it
[1:18:03] through denominational line." Amen.
[1:18:05] Y'all forgive me if I'm excited. I'm
[1:18:07] excited to be preaching at home tonight.
[1:18:09] You education or denomination, that's
[1:18:12] fine. But people are laying too much to
[1:18:14] that and they're leaving out the
[1:18:16] spiritual discernment. He said, "Now
[1:18:18] watch. Flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:18:20] this to you, but my father which is in
[1:18:23] heaven has revealed this to you and upon
[1:18:27] this rock
[1:18:29] I will build my church and the gates of
[1:18:32] hell cannot prevail against it." we'll
[1:18:37] never be able to prevail. He said, "Now
[1:18:39] watch and see where the gates of hell is
[1:18:42] against." He said, "It ain't against
[1:18:44] denomination. The government recognizes
[1:18:46] that. The world recognizes that." He
[1:18:49] said, "It's against the spiritual
[1:18:52] revelation of Christ being here now, the
[1:18:57] same yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:19:00] Watch, folks. That's where the church is
[1:19:02] missing it today. It's that spiritual
[1:19:05] discernment, brother Wesley, to see what
[1:19:08] God's are doing, not what God has done
[1:19:11] and not what God will do. He said they
[1:19:14] look way over top for something here
[1:19:16] that's going on right here and it'll be
[1:19:18] passed before you know it. Can I say
[1:19:21] something to you? Don't miss it.
[1:19:25] Come on, Grace Tabernacle. Don't miss
[1:19:27] it. Amen. I I admonish you. Amen. If you
[1:19:30] can be in every service, don't miss a
[1:19:32] one of them. This is the greatest times
[1:19:34] of your life. It's the greatest seasons
[1:19:36] that your children will ever experience
[1:19:38] is when the power of God is moving in
[1:19:40] the church and souls are being saved and
[1:19:43] hearts are being filled and lives are
[1:19:45] being transformed. I say open up your
[1:19:47] eyes and say, Lord, if a cold spirit has
[1:19:50] come over me, shake me, Lord, from the
[1:19:52] top of my head to the souls of my feet.
[1:19:54] I don't want to miss what you are doing
[1:19:56] in the hour that I'm living. If you're
[1:19:58] going to heal anybody, I want to be
[1:20:00] there to see it. If you're going to save
[1:20:02] anybody, I want to be there to see it.
[1:20:05] If anybody's going to get a breakthrough
[1:20:07] and they're going to shout in the Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost, I want to be there to enjoy it
[1:20:10] with them. I don't want to miss what God
[1:20:13] is doing in the hour that I'm living in.
[1:20:16] Don't miss it. Don't miss it. Don't miss
[1:20:19] it. He said, "Man's always He's always
[1:20:22] looking back and praising God for what
[1:20:24] he's done, and he's always looking
[1:20:27] forward to what he will do and
[1:20:29] ignoring." Yes sir.
[1:20:32] What he has done and is doing. He
[1:20:36] praises God for what he has done. Come
[1:20:39] on.
[1:20:41] He looks forward to what he will do, but
[1:20:45] he ignores what God is doing. Can I say
[1:20:48] what a brother said? And there he misses
[1:20:51] the whole thing.
[1:20:53] My goodness, brother Anthony. looking
[1:20:56] back to what God done, looking forward
[1:20:58] to what God's going to do and missing
[1:21:00] the whole thing. Ignoring what he's
[1:21:03] doing. He knows what he has done and he
[1:21:06] knows the promise of what he will do,
[1:21:08] but he fails to see what he's doing.
[1:21:12] Spiritual amnesia. Now, may he in his
[1:21:15] power come through this audience of
[1:21:17] people wherever you are and with his
[1:21:19] spiritual discernment. Amen. showing you
[1:21:23] that he is the word. My goodness. So,
[1:21:28] we're not looking for a vision. We are
[1:21:31] looking at a vision. Can I say this? We
[1:21:34] have a vision. Proverbs 29:18 said,
[1:21:37] "Where there is no vision, the people
[1:21:40] perish." Amen. You know what that word
[1:21:42] perish means? It means to let go of. It
[1:21:44] means to lose restraint. It means to
[1:21:47] lose the discipline. Amen. To go to the
[1:21:49] house of God. Now I just got to preach
[1:21:51] since I'm this close to it. Amen. Any
[1:21:53] church that loses the vision, Amen.
[1:21:55] Before long, people's going to start
[1:21:57] losing the zeal. Amen. To even go to
[1:21:59] church or be a part of church because
[1:22:02] everything's become a fuss or a fight or
[1:22:04] correct this and fix that. Hey, I'll say
[1:22:06] this. Let it all go and open up your
[1:22:09] eyes and see what God is doing. I know
[1:22:11] there's false doctrines. I know there's
[1:22:13] confusions, but open up your eyes and
[1:22:16] see there is a revival that is burning
[1:22:18] in the hearts of the bride of Jesus
[1:22:20] Christ. God is doing something, church.
[1:22:23] Hallelujah. He's saving souls. He's
[1:22:26] bringing families back in the house of
[1:22:28] God. He's revealing himself in the power
[1:22:31] of his message. I don't have to look
[1:22:32] back a 100 years ago. I can look at you
[1:22:35] tonight and say the same God that was
[1:22:37] with Abraham that was with Moses is
[1:22:40] right here in this building tonight in
[1:22:43] the power of his resurrection to fulfill
[1:22:45] his word.
[1:22:47] We ain't got to let our praise go. We
[1:22:50] ain't got to get so discouraged.
[1:22:52] Hallelujah. Come on. Amen. I'll just say
[1:22:54] this. The last thing the devil wants to
[1:22:56] go is your praise.
[1:22:59] Because he knows when you lose your
[1:23:01] praise, you've lost your weapon. He
[1:23:04] knows when you've lost your ability.
[1:23:06] Can I preach? When you've lost your
[1:23:08] ability to just let go and praise God,
[1:23:11] you're on your way out. But I say
[1:23:13] harness your praise. I say arrest your
[1:23:16] praise. I say arrest your worship and
[1:23:19] pull it back in the house of God and
[1:23:21] say, "I may be disappointed. I may be
[1:23:23] struggling. I may be in a hard way. But
[1:23:26] let everything that hath breath praise
[1:23:28] ye the Lord. Praise him on the pulpit.
[1:23:31] Praise him in the back door. Praise him
[1:23:33] on the instruments. Let the young people
[1:23:35] praise him. Let the elders praise him.
[1:23:37] This is one thing Grace Tabernacle will
[1:23:40] not allow Satan to do. We will never
[1:23:42] allow Satan, Amen, to bury our
[1:23:47] praise. We got a praise in our soul and
[1:23:50] it don't belong to no preacher. It don't
[1:23:52] belong to no church. It belongs to Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ.
[1:23:56] Who is the head of our salvation?
[1:24:00] Yes, sir. I'm talking about a praise.
[1:24:03] I'm talking about a real praise. That's
[1:24:06] the difference in us and a bunch of
[1:24:07] Pentecostals. We ain't got to get up
[1:24:08] here and get the music going and then
[1:24:11] run all over the building saying, "Come
[1:24:12] on, somebody. Come on, somebody. Come
[1:24:14] on." Oh, no. Amen. Just start preaching
[1:24:16] this message and watch the pillar of
[1:24:18] fire start trouble the waters and watch
[1:24:21] the anointing begin to connect here and
[1:24:23] connect over there. And before long,
[1:24:26] there's a revival in the house of God.
[1:24:28] And there ain't no music and there ain't
[1:24:30] no instruments, but there's a praise in
[1:24:32] our hearts
[1:24:34] because no matter what I'm going
[1:24:36] through, God's been good to me,
[1:24:40] brother Joe. No matter what I'm going
[1:24:42] through, God.
[1:24:46] He's been good to me.
[1:24:48] He deserves the praise.
[1:24:51] There is no vision. The people lose
[1:24:54] their restraint. They lose their zeal.
[1:24:57] Come on. Look at this word vision. It's
[1:25:00] an oracle.
[1:25:02] It's prophecy. It's divine
[1:25:05] communication.
[1:25:07] Oh, glory to God. When there is no
[1:25:10] divine communication,
[1:25:14] when the man of God is no longer
[1:25:15] studying the message to preach, but he's
[1:25:17] checking every other church to see what
[1:25:19] they're doing wrong. Well, I might as
[1:25:21] well preach. I feel good and I'm home.
[1:25:23] Amen. When there's no more burden in the
[1:25:25] word of God, Amen. to dig in the depths
[1:25:27] of the message and find some golden
[1:25:29] nuggets. Amen. So, we just get up and
[1:25:31] say, "Do No, no, no. Let me say this.
[1:25:33] Thank God for divine communication."
[1:25:38] Thank God there's still some preachers
[1:25:40] in the last days that still are willing
[1:25:42] to get off the boat. They're willing to
[1:25:44] get off the golf course and they're
[1:25:46] willing to get out of the treeand and
[1:25:48] study the message of the hour and come
[1:25:50] to a pull pit and say what a prophet
[1:25:52] said.
[1:25:54] I'm going to get in trouble.
[1:25:55] They're willing to get in the word of
[1:25:57] God. Now, are you against fishing? I
[1:25:58] love to fish. Are you against hunting? I
[1:26:00] love to hunt. Amen. But I will say this.
[1:26:03] Amen. If we're going to be a preacher,
[1:26:05] we ought to make the people and the
[1:26:06] preaching of the gospel the priority of
[1:26:09] our lives.
[1:26:11] Because this is more than just you
[1:26:13] coming to church and punching a time
[1:26:15] clock. Brother said, "You don't
[1:26:17] realize." He said, "Spiritual
[1:26:18] discernment is connected to your eternal
[1:26:21] destination."
[1:26:24] Now let's just say what a prophet said.
[1:26:26] He said what is the seer? What is a
[1:26:29] vision? It's another dimension. He said
[1:26:33] it's outside of the five. It's a six
[1:26:35] sense. He said now what is a vision?
[1:26:38] Somebody say six sense. He says what is
[1:26:40] a vision? Someone has asked many times.
[1:26:43] Brother Brandham, are you impressed to
[1:26:45] say certain things or do you just think
[1:26:47] it in your mind? Now here it is. No sir,
[1:26:50] I see it. It's just there. It's like I'm
[1:26:54] looking at you just the same as you are.
[1:26:56] Only you know you're standing here yet
[1:26:59] you may be back 40 years in somebody's
[1:27:02] life seeing what taking place even see
[1:27:05] them what they're dressed positionally
[1:27:07] and everything. And then I have to talk
[1:27:10] and when I'm talking seeing the vision I
[1:27:13] don't know whether they hear me whether
[1:27:14] I'm loud or not. That's the reason I say
[1:27:16] to the operator here and
[1:27:18] everywhere. If it's just in this small
[1:27:20] place where I know you're getting a
[1:27:22] rebound in this gymnasium, he said,
[1:27:24] "Will you really understand it?" He
[1:27:25] said, "Here it is. A vision is God."
[1:27:28] Amen. Somebody say, "Well, it ain't too
[1:27:30] important to worry about the sound
[1:27:32] system." I got a quote for you. But a
[1:27:34] vision is God. But a word of knowledge,
[1:27:37] dropping it to the person to foresee or
[1:27:41] foresee something. It tells something
[1:27:43] that has been or tells something that
[1:27:46] will be. Can I say this? Job was on the
[1:27:50] ash heap. He was at his wits end. His
[1:27:53] family was gone. His children was gone.
[1:27:56] Livestock was gone. Everything, brother
[1:27:58] Bobby, seemingly was gone. But I love
[1:28:00] what the prophet said. He said, "But God
[1:28:03] in his mercy,
[1:28:05] God in his mercy, he gave Job another
[1:28:10] sense." Where did this sense come from?
[1:28:13] In his lowest hour, in his weakest
[1:28:16] moment, the Lord came down to Job and
[1:28:20] imparted into him another sense. Can I
[1:28:23] say this to you? Somebody say, "Another
[1:28:25] sense." Another sense. Somebody shout
[1:28:27] the six sense. Six sense. Somebody shout
[1:28:29] the super sense. Super sense. God gave
[1:28:32] Job another sense. Look what Hebrews
[1:28:35] 11:1 says. It says, "Now faith is the
[1:28:38] substance of things hoped for. It's the
[1:28:41] evidence of things not seen." In
[1:28:43] Galatians 2:19, "For I through the law
[1:28:46] am dead to the law, that I might live
[1:28:49] unto God." Now, now, now that now we
[1:28:50] got, we got to stop here for a second
[1:28:52] cuz that's almost an oxymoron that
[1:28:55] something's dead and something's alive.
[1:28:56] It's a contradiction, right? But look
[1:28:58] what Paul says. He says, "I am crucified
[1:29:01] with Christ. Nevertheless, I live."
[1:29:04] Amen. Now, is that is that a paradox? I
[1:29:07] am crucified with Christ, but
[1:29:10] nevertheless I live. Now, here it is.
[1:29:12] Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and
[1:29:17] the life which I now live, I live in the
[1:29:21] flesh. Oh, God. I live by the faith of
[1:29:27] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:29:30] himself for me. Can I tell you what
[1:29:32] Paul's saying? He's saying, "In one
[1:29:34] sense, I'm dead. But in another sense,
[1:29:38] I'm alive. In one sense, I'm crucified.
[1:29:42] In another sense, I live. Yet not Paul,
[1:29:46] but Christ liveth in me." Look at this.
[1:29:49] In one sense, but in another sense.
[1:29:52] Amen. I love that phrase. It typically
[1:29:54] refers, Amen, to the different ways that
[1:29:57] we perceive the world through our five
[1:30:00] senses. Amen. through sight, through
[1:30:03] hearing, through smell, taste and touch,
[1:30:05] or the five inner senses. Now, I got to
[1:30:07] digging in this and I found the best
[1:30:10] example I found is brother Brandham in
[1:30:12] 1951. He says this. He says, "Now say
[1:30:15] some of you ladies tomorrow, what if the
[1:30:16] express agent would come down to your
[1:30:18] house and say, "How do you how do you
[1:30:20] do? How are you, Miss John Doe?" You'd
[1:30:22] say, "Yes." Well, he'd say, "I have
[1:30:24] something here for you." And you looked
[1:30:26] at it. Come on. I'm feeling too good.
[1:30:30] and you looked at it and it's in a great
[1:30:33] big box and it's full of rattlesnakes.
[1:30:35] Well, what a present. There's your name
[1:30:38] tacked on them and he says, "These are
[1:30:40] yours." Are they? Now, listen. In one
[1:30:44] sense, they're yours, but in another
[1:30:47] sense, they're not.
[1:30:50] In one sense, the box of rattlesnakes
[1:30:52] are yours because they got your name on
[1:30:55] them. But in another sense, they're not.
[1:30:58] Now, you say, "I don't want them." Amen.
[1:31:02] You say, "I don't want them." And he
[1:31:04] says, "Well, they're yours. Your name's
[1:31:07] on them." Well, that's one way it's
[1:31:09] yours. Oh, God. That's one way it's
[1:31:12] yours, but still it isn't yours until
[1:31:15] you sign for it. Hallelujah. You can
[1:31:19] look at it and see your name is on it.
[1:31:22] And in one sense it's yours because your
[1:31:25] sight tells you your name is on it. Oh,
[1:31:28] but in another sense it's not yours
[1:31:31] until you accept it.
[1:31:34] And if you don't sign for it, well,
[1:31:36] he'll have to take it
[1:31:38] back. If you don't sign for it, he'll
[1:31:41] have to take it back. Are you hearing
[1:31:43] me? What happened? Spiritual discernment
[1:31:45] took over. There was an ability to
[1:31:47] discern that. Yes, my name is on it, but
[1:31:50] it's a box of rattlesnakes and I don't
[1:31:53] have to accept it.
[1:31:55] But I might as well preach it's
[1:31:56] Wednesday night. Amen. Yes, your name is
[1:31:59] on that depression. And yes, your name
[1:32:01] is on that sickness. And yes, your name
[1:32:04] is on that chart. And yes, your name is
[1:32:06] on that problem. And in one sense, it is
[1:32:09] yours. But oh, brother Travis, in
[1:32:12] another sense, it's not yours.
[1:32:17] Hallelujah. Job was only ash. His family
[1:32:20] was gone. His livestock was gone.
[1:32:22] Everything he had was gone. He was at
[1:32:24] his wits end. And in one sense, brother
[1:32:27] Jonah, he was at his end. Oh, but in
[1:32:30] another sense, in another sense, he was
[1:32:33] not at his end. He was at his beginning.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah. What was his beginning? when
[1:32:39] the vision came and the revelation
[1:32:42] struck his heart and he said, "Though
[1:32:44] the skin worms destroy this body, yet in
[1:32:47] my flesh shall I see God." I say to that
[1:32:49] devil tonight, "Take your hands off of
[1:32:52] every job in this building tonight. I
[1:32:54] rebuke you, Satan. In the name of Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ, you don't have a right to hold.
[1:32:59] You don't have a right to torment." The
[1:33:01] faith of God has prompted in this
[1:33:03] building tonight to say, "It's not
[1:33:05] yours.
[1:33:07] It's not yours. That nervousness is not
[1:33:10] yours. That complex is not yours. That
[1:33:14] failure is not yours. That besetting sin
[1:33:17] is not yours. That complex of habits,
[1:33:21] it's not yours. But I'll tell you what
[1:33:24] is yours. Joy unspeakable and full of
[1:33:27] glory. I'll tell you what is yours is a
[1:33:30] peace that passes all understanding.
[1:33:35] Hallelujah. Somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:33:38] Somebody praise God.
[1:33:41] That doctor's report may have your name
[1:33:43] on it, but it ain't yours.
[1:33:48] I'm at my end. That's in one sense.
[1:33:52] But in another sense,
[1:33:55] you said, "Brother Ander, what are you
[1:33:56] getting at?" Amen. Where's the spiritual
[1:33:58] discernment? Brother said it very
[1:33:59] beautiful. He said, "Now look here. You
[1:34:01] say, "Now, Brother Brandham, could Jesus
[1:34:03] look like you or you be Jesus or
[1:34:06] something like that?" Can I preach?
[1:34:10] In one sense of the word, that's exactly
[1:34:13] the truth. Amen. But another sense of
[1:34:17] the word, it's an antichrist.
[1:34:20] That's the difference between right and
[1:34:23] wrong. To make me the person of the Lord
[1:34:26] Jesus Christ would be an antichrist.
[1:34:28] See, for that the person of the Lord
[1:34:31] Jesus is sitting at the right hand of
[1:34:34] the majesty on high, and he will come
[1:34:36] again in great power and glory.
[1:34:41] Can I preach? So, let's just all settle
[1:34:44] down and let's just all go to church and
[1:34:46] kind of hum along and just, you know,
[1:34:48] just get bitter about everything and get
[1:34:50] complexed and and get all been out of
[1:34:52] shape because brother Travis, someday
[1:34:54] he's going to come back. Well, in one
[1:34:56] sense that's true. He says, "But in
[1:34:58] another his life that was in him being
[1:35:01] upon me and upon you who have him, it's
[1:35:06] exactly the truth." Can I read it,
[1:35:08] Brother Wayne? And you become Christ.
[1:35:13] Yes, sir. You've become Christ. Oh, no
[1:35:17] wonder the devil's after you, Sister
[1:35:19] Cindy. Is you have become Christ. What
[1:35:23] is Christ? He's the anointed living
[1:35:25] word. Oh house of hell give way to
[1:35:29] Christ who is the word
[1:35:32] you become Christ. You remember my
[1:35:35] message on messiah. See the word messiah
[1:35:38] it means the anointed one. Now you are
[1:35:41] if you have the holy spirit. You become
[1:35:45] the anointed one. See then there's all
[1:35:48] kinds of anointed ones. Can I bring it
[1:35:51] on down? Amen. Jesus was a God man.
[1:35:56] Jesus, he was a God man. Remember said
[1:36:00] he was man in one sense.
[1:36:03] He was God in another sense. He was man
[1:36:07] in flesh, but in his spirit he was God.
[1:36:11] Brother Noah, in his flesh, he was man.
[1:36:15] In his spirit, he was God. Hallelujah.
[1:36:18] He said, we just went through that.
[1:36:20] Amen. Can I say this to you? Now, I want
[1:36:23] to bring it down from Jesus and down
[1:36:25] from our prophet. I'm going to bring it
[1:36:26] right here to every believer. For in a
[1:36:29] man, he is in one sense a miniature
[1:36:32] creator if he is a child of God. Because
[1:36:35] the spirit of God is in him who controls
[1:36:39] him who operates him. Can I go on a step
[1:36:43] further? 1964, we are carnal and that
[1:36:47] part must perish. But then, Brother
[1:36:51] Matt, but then inside, we are a spirit
[1:36:54] man. There's a soul inside.
[1:36:57] How many thankful for a prophet? And the
[1:37:00] soul on the inside. He said that's faith
[1:37:03] in God's word. Hallelujah. That's why
[1:37:07] the devil hates you is because yes, you
[1:37:09] got a flesh and it's carnal and it's
[1:37:12] going to perish. And yes, you got a
[1:37:14] spirit and it's up and down. But
[1:37:16] underneath your flesh and underneath
[1:37:18] your spirit, you got a soul which is
[1:37:21] faith in God's eternal word. He said,
[1:37:24] "Then we bring our outside body under
[1:37:27] subjection to the word." Yes, sir.
[1:37:30] Brother, how do we do it? We do it by
[1:37:33] faith. We bring our outside body under
[1:37:36] subjection to the word by faith. Can I
[1:37:39] say this to you? By accepting what God
[1:37:43] has said. How do you bring the
[1:37:45] rattlesnakes in your house? By signing
[1:37:48] for it, Brother Jared, and accepting it
[1:37:50] and bringing it in your house. Well, how
[1:37:52] do you send it away? By rejecting it
[1:37:56] and taking a stand in another sense. Oh,
[1:38:00] house of hell, give way to the name of
[1:38:03] Jesus Christ. This ain't just a bunch of
[1:38:05] people playing church in a building.
[1:38:07] These are the subjects of God. These are
[1:38:09] the messiahs of God. And the devil sent
[1:38:12] everything he can our way. But greater
[1:38:14] is he that is in us than he that is in
[1:38:18] the world.
[1:38:20] Now I I don't want you just to hear
[1:38:22] this. I want you to get it. Amen. God in
[1:38:25] his mercy came down to Job and gave
[1:38:31] him another sense.
[1:38:34] Amen. Look at this word sense. It's the
[1:38:37] ability to understand, to recognize, to
[1:38:41] value, or to react to something. Now,
[1:38:44] I've already said it. We have five outer
[1:38:47] senses. See, taste, feel, smell, hear,
[1:38:53] five inner senses, imagination,
[1:38:57] conscience, memory, reason, and
[1:38:59] affection. Can I say this? None of those
[1:39:02] was given to you to guide you. Come on
[1:39:04] now. They were given to you for your
[1:39:06] earthly contact of your earthly home.
[1:39:09] See, there's a body, which is flesh,
[1:39:12] that's controlled by five outer senses.
[1:39:14] There's a spirit that's controlled by
[1:39:16] five inner senses. But there's a soul
[1:39:19] that's controlled by one or two. That's
[1:39:21] either faith in God's word or unbelief.
[1:39:25] Now, brother says this. He says faith is
[1:39:28] the six sense. Amen. It's the only
[1:39:32] direct and positive sense. He said,
[1:39:35] "Now, if you're possessed with faith, oh
[1:39:38] my, can I can I can I pile a bunch on
[1:39:40] the devil right now? If you're possessed
[1:39:42] with faith, then faith is just as real
[1:39:46] and as much reality to you as your sight
[1:39:49] is." He says, "Whatever you yield your
[1:39:52] senses to will dominate you." He said,
[1:39:55] "What you see, what you hear, what you
[1:39:58] taste, what you smell or feel, whatever
[1:40:01] those senses are yielded to, they will
[1:40:04] dominate you." Now, here's what I want
[1:40:05] to put on the devil's face tonight,
[1:40:07] David, Brother Day. Paul, I want to say
[1:40:08] this to the devil. The six sense only
[1:40:12] belongs to the Christian.
[1:40:15] So for the devil that's been telling you
[1:40:17] you're not a Christian, he has no right
[1:40:20] to qualify you as a Christian by the
[1:40:23] five outer senses or the five inner
[1:40:25] senses. What qualifies you as a
[1:40:28] Christian is by the six sense which is
[1:40:31] the faith of God.
[1:40:33] But you cannot have that six sense until
[1:40:36] you become the Christian. And the only
[1:40:38] way you can ever have any more than five
[1:40:40] natural senses for the natural person is
[1:40:42] the six sense which is better known to
[1:40:45] the Christian as faith. Here it is. It's
[1:40:47] the one that governs and guides you and
[1:40:51] it is superior to all other five senses.
[1:40:55] He says here it is. When the when the
[1:40:57] five senses can I can I give you these
[1:40:59] quotes? Will you will you take them?
[1:41:00] When these five senses act contrary to
[1:41:03] the word of God then they are lying.
[1:41:09] Your feelings will lie to you. Your
[1:41:11] emotions and sensations will lie to you.
[1:41:14] Your imagination will lie to you. Amen.
[1:41:17] Your reasoning will lie to you. Here it
[1:41:20] is. But the six sense cannot lie.
[1:41:25] Woo. Glory. The sixth sense cannot lie.
[1:41:29] It's a super sense. And here it is. And
[1:41:32] the super sense is the Holy Spirit, the
[1:41:35] faith of God that dwells in you. Well,
[1:41:40] come on, devil. Get out of here. On my
[1:41:42] good days, I'm a child of God. And on my
[1:41:45] bad days, I'm a child of God. When I'm
[1:41:47] sick, I'm a child of God. When I'm well,
[1:41:50] I'm a child of God. When I'm encouraged,
[1:41:53] I'm a child of God. When I'm
[1:41:55] discouraged, I'm a child of God. There
[1:41:58] is nothing the devil can manipulate
[1:42:00] through fight. inner and outer senses
[1:42:02] that determines who I am in the forecast
[1:42:05] of almighty God.
[1:42:08] Now you say, "Brother, you're going way
[1:42:10] out there." Am I though? And the super
[1:42:12] sense is something. Are you ready for
[1:42:14] this?
[1:42:16] It'll make you believe God's word. Yes,
[1:42:19] sir.
[1:42:20] Oh, I want to put my shouting shoes on
[1:42:22] for about five minutes and say, "Thank
[1:42:25] God for the super sense.
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] Thank God for the super sense. It makes
[1:42:32] me believe.
[1:42:34] It's the only thing it'll speak about.
[1:42:36] It'll make you believe for things that
[1:42:38] you cannot see, you cannot taste, you
[1:42:41] cannot feel, smell, or hear cuz it'll
[1:42:43] take God's word. Are you ready for this?
[1:42:46] And it will deliver that word to you.
[1:42:51] Amen. And then it will make you walk
[1:42:55] contrary to any other thing there is
[1:43:00] but God's word.
[1:43:02] So what activates this six sense? He
[1:43:05] said see it's the new birth. The six
[1:43:08] sense comes for this reason to make you
[1:43:10] deny anything that's contrary to God's
[1:43:13] word. Right? That scripture speaks of
[1:43:16] casting down reasoning. So you got to
[1:43:19] walk by that six sense. You got to talk
[1:43:22] by that six sense. You got to live by
[1:43:25] that six sense. You got to die by that
[1:43:28] six sense. Can I go ahead and say it? He
[1:43:31] says, "And you will rise
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:35] by that sixth sense." Yes, sir. That
[1:43:40] super sense. It's something that's in
[1:43:43] you,
[1:43:44] brother Brian. It's in you. Hallelujah.
[1:43:47] That's why when Martin Luther wakes up
[1:43:49] and brother Brandham wakes up and Paul
[1:43:52] wakes up, it'll be just as fresh as if
[1:43:55] it when they went down because the faith
[1:43:57] of the revelation of the word of God
[1:44:00] lives.
[1:44:02] Now, now I got to bring this down
[1:44:04] because the natural man says and reads
[1:44:06] the word of God, says that's the word of
[1:44:08] God. It's speaking the truth. But if it
[1:44:10] reads it and says it's not all the word
[1:44:12] of God, come on. or it was it's
[1:44:16] something it was one time but it isn't
[1:44:18] now. Somebody say thank God for the six
[1:44:21] sense.
[1:44:23] Then that six sense comes in and says no
[1:44:27] he's the same yesterday
[1:44:30] today and forever. The six sense is come
[1:44:35] upon the human being to make them deny
[1:44:38] anything contrary to God's word. Here it
[1:44:40] is. It's a greater sense. It's a faith.
[1:44:44] It's a power that stirs and drives. It's
[1:44:47] something that makes you do things that
[1:44:50] you never
[1:44:54] It makes you do things that you never
[1:44:57] thought you would do. Well, I feel good
[1:45:00] on that. It makes you do things, brother
[1:45:03] Morgan, that you thought you would never
[1:45:05] do. When the six sense is struck by the
[1:45:09] reality of what it's hearing to be the
[1:45:11] vision of God, it ignites something on
[1:45:14] the inside of you. Come on. I know what
[1:45:16] I'm talking about. Amen. No doubt some
[1:45:17] of y'all come in here tonight on
[1:45:19] Wednesday night and God bless you all
[1:45:21] for being in the house of God like this
[1:45:23] on a Wednesday night. Amen. together
[1:45:25] with eagles and bring your liquifier.
[1:45:27] But you come in here and you're real
[1:45:28] tired
[1:45:30] and you and you're going through things.
[1:45:32] But can I say this? By the atmosphere
[1:45:34] that's in this building right now.
[1:45:38] Unless you told me you was going through
[1:45:39] something, I wouldn't know it.
[1:45:45] Unless you told me, Brother Charles,
[1:45:47] there was a situation, I wouldn't know
[1:45:49] it. You know why? Because you're not
[1:45:52] just church members. You're Christians
[1:45:55] and you receive the six sense. And so
[1:45:58] the six sense is what dominates grace
[1:46:00] tabernacle services. The six sense is
[1:46:03] what guides our worship. The six sense
[1:46:06] is what guides our Amen. This ain't a
[1:46:08] bunch of emotion leading people around.
[1:46:10] It's the word of God. It's the vision of
[1:46:13] God that is coming to this age. Amen.
[1:46:15] I'm going to close on this. It's too
[1:46:17] late, brother Matt. The six sense done
[1:46:19] claimed you.
[1:46:21] I said it's too late. See can't have
[1:46:23] you. Feeling can't have you. Imagination
[1:46:26] can't have you because the six sense has
[1:46:30] already claimed you. It has claimed you
[1:46:33] for its fulfillment. It has claimed you.
[1:46:38] Oh, I may be down, but God in his mercy
[1:46:42] has given me another sense.
[1:46:46] Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] It's a power and it stirs you. Come on,
[1:46:52] sir.
[1:46:57] Can I preach? It's a power.
[1:47:01] It's a power and it stirs you. You say,
[1:47:04] "Brother Andrew, I ain't a preacher. I
[1:47:06] ain't up on the pull pit. How's the six
[1:47:08] sense affecting me?" You're here in the
[1:47:10] house of God.
[1:47:12] Hallelujah. Can I say something to you?
[1:47:15] Amen. I'm sorry I miss Mother's Day
[1:47:16] here. Let me say this. God bless all you
[1:47:18] mothers.
[1:47:21] It should be every day.
[1:47:24] In the days Sodom and Gomorrah has
[1:47:26] returned, so has the six sense. And it's
[1:47:29] claimed some little fifth gospels. It's
[1:47:31] claimed some mamas. Amen. To raise their
[1:47:34] babies in the fear and the admonition of
[1:47:37] God. Amen. I'll just say this. Amen.
[1:47:39] Amen. I thank God for my wife and I
[1:47:41] thank God for my children's mama. We was
[1:47:43] out yesterday or somewhere yesterday,
[1:47:45] day before and there was a woman in
[1:47:47] there and her kid was there and brother
[1:47:49] Wayne, it it tore my heart out. Her kid
[1:47:51] said something to her and she took off a
[1:47:53] cussing at that kid and using every foul
[1:47:55] word you could think of. And I thought,
[1:47:57] dear God, I told Malachi, I said, "Go
[1:48:00] find your mama and give her a hug and
[1:48:02] thank her for raising you the way she
[1:48:04] is." Come on, church. Amen. This is more
[1:48:07] than just a bunch of cloaks. There's a
[1:48:09] reality to this six sense. The six sense
[1:48:12] has claimed homes. The six sense has
[1:48:15] claimed entire family. Some of y'all
[1:48:17] were sitting here tonight and you were
[1:48:19] buried in a religious tradition. But the
[1:48:21] six sense come walking to you and it got
[1:48:24] a hold of you and it pulled you out of
[1:48:26] that tradition and it claimed you for
[1:48:29] its fulfillment. Some of you all was
[1:48:31] sitting on the ash heap like Job was and
[1:48:33] you was ready to throw up your hands and
[1:48:35] say, "I give up. I quit. I ain't going
[1:48:38] through this religious confusion any
[1:48:40] longer." But then grace come walking in
[1:48:42] the form of a man of God called brother
[1:48:44] Matt Morris who raised up a tabernacle
[1:48:47] and said this church is going to be
[1:48:49] built on the foundation of the six
[1:48:52] sense. We're not going by gifts. We're
[1:48:55] not going by feelings. We're following
[1:48:57] thus sayith the Lord. And I say thank
[1:48:59] you brother Mad that we have a church
[1:49:01] governed
[1:49:04] controlled led by the six saints.
[1:49:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What's wrong
[1:49:14] with you? I'll tell you what's wrong
[1:49:15] with you. My six sense, it's feeding
[1:49:18] right now. And it only feeds.
[1:49:22] It only feeds on the word of God.
[1:49:26] You say, "But Andrew, I've been coming
[1:49:28] to church and I've been hearing the
[1:49:29] word. Nothing's changing." Can I say
[1:49:31] something to you? Give the Six Sense a
[1:49:33] try.
[1:49:36] Come on, folks. Can I tell you right
[1:49:38] now, your body is receiving revelation
[1:49:41] of God?
[1:49:43] I'm done preaching. I'm just having fun
[1:49:45] now. Your body is receiving revelation
[1:49:48] from God that it might catch up with in
[1:49:51] two weeks.
[1:49:56] It might take it two weeks to catch up
[1:49:58] with it, John Ryan.
[1:50:00] But just give it some time. Yes, sir.
[1:50:03] You say, "When was John Ryan healed?"
[1:50:05] Brother Wayne was healed. The night he
[1:50:07] said, "I'm healed." The night he
[1:50:09] accepted his healing was the night
[1:50:12] brother Marky was healed. But it took a
[1:50:14] few weeks before that body come under
[1:50:16] subjection to another sense. What about
[1:50:19] the two women on the prayer line? One
[1:50:21] had a gorder and one had a stomach
[1:50:24] trouble. And brother Joe, they walked
[1:50:25] across the platform and he said, "You're
[1:50:28] well. You're well." And they went out
[1:50:30] with the gorder on the neck and the
[1:50:32] stomach trouble still there. You know
[1:50:34] what he said sister? He said they went
[1:50:37] home praising God. He said Gordon is
[1:50:39] still there. Stomach trouble still
[1:50:41] there. He said they went home praising
[1:50:44] God. He said in one morning, he said one
[1:50:47] morning the angel of the Lord come
[1:50:49] stirring through the neighborhood and
[1:50:51] the woman took a drink of the orange
[1:50:53] juice and the acid didn't come back up.
[1:50:56] Hallelujah. I've got to break out of my
[1:50:58] skin right now. The acid didn't come
[1:51:00] back up and the coffee stayed down. He
[1:51:04] said, "And she ran up the road and she
[1:51:06] said, "Honey, what's wrong with you?"
[1:51:08] And they were a shaking the sheets. They
[1:51:11] were shaking the sheets looking for the
[1:51:13] garter. Brother said, "What happened?"
[1:51:15] He said, "The night that they were in
[1:51:17] the meeting," he said, "I was preaching
[1:51:19] it and the six sense was catching it."
[1:51:23] Glory. I say, "Thank God for my six
[1:51:26] sense. What my feelings don't catch,
[1:51:28] what my memory don't catch, but six
[1:51:31] sense catches and causes me to rise
[1:51:34] above it all and say, "I have received
[1:51:37] another sense."
[1:51:40] Stand on your feet and give God praise.
[1:51:44] I have received another sense.
[1:51:49] And it's greater and it's superior.
[1:51:54] Hallelujah. It's stronger. Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] And it's guiding this church. Thank you,
[1:52:00] Lord. It's guiding this pullpit. Yes,
[1:52:02] sir. It's guiding these musicians.
[1:52:06] It's guiding these families.
[1:52:10] It's the six sense. Amen.
[1:52:13] And it's real, buddy. Hallelujah. I wish
[1:52:17] I was out.
[1:52:18] I feel like shouting right now. When I
[1:52:21] start looking back over my life and I
[1:52:24] start seeing all the valleys, brother
[1:52:26] Wayne, I should have never come out of,
[1:52:28] but the six sense was catching the word
[1:52:31] and it was bringing me out of the trial
[1:52:34] because I received a greater sense.
[1:52:39] I'm not a crazy man. I know way felt,
[1:52:42] but then he stood up. Yes, sir. Yes,
[1:52:45] sir.
[1:52:47] I don't know if you can, brothers. Can
[1:52:48] you give me up there? Can you give me 2
[1:52:50] Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number
[1:52:53] eight? 2 Corinthians 4 and verse number
[1:52:57] 8.
[1:52:59] I want to read about y'all for a second
[1:53:01] here.
[1:53:02] Is that okay?
[1:53:04] Can I read about you? 2 Corinthians 4:8.
[1:53:07] There it is. Thank you, brothers.
[1:53:10] We are troubled
[1:53:12] on every side.
[1:53:17] Do you see what I see?
[1:53:19] yet not distressed.
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] We are perplexed.
[1:53:26] Am I reading that right? But not in
[1:53:28] despair. Give me the next verse.
[1:53:34] We are persecuted.
[1:53:37] But we're not forsaken. Brother Dave,
[1:53:41] we're cast down.
[1:53:44] But we're not destroyed.
[1:53:47] Can you give me verse eight again? Can I
[1:53:49] read it to you like this?
[1:53:52] In one sense we are troubled on every
[1:53:56] side, but in another sense we are not
[1:53:59] distressed.
[1:54:01] In one sense we are perplexed, but in
[1:54:04] another sense we're not in despair.
[1:54:06] Amen. The next verse. Amen. In one sense
[1:54:09] we are persecuted, but in another sense
[1:54:12] we are not forsaken. In one sense we are
[1:54:15] cast down, but in another sense we are
[1:54:18] not destroyed because greater is the
[1:54:21] super sense.
[1:54:25] Get a hold of it tonight, church. Get a
[1:54:28] hold of it tonight. Get a hold of the
[1:54:30] six sense. Brother Wesley, get a hold of
[1:54:32] it, buddy. It'll lead you. It'll guide
[1:54:35] you. And it'll fix every problem in
[1:54:37] front of you because it's already in
[1:54:39] your future.
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:42] the six sense.
[1:54:44] It's real.
[1:54:47] And it's here in this building tonight.
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:50] And I'm going to go ahead and say it and
[1:54:52] I'm done. It's already claimed you.
[1:54:55] That's why you're still here.
[1:55:06] That's why we're still here.
[1:55:09] It's a vision. Hallelujah. It's a
[1:55:12] forecast.
[1:55:16] I'm not
[1:55:17] looking at what I'm in.
[1:55:21] I've climbed up.
[1:55:25] Oh, don't it feel so good to get on
[1:55:26] Jacob's ladder.
[1:55:29] And start climbing up in that dimension.
[1:55:31] Amen. Amen. Somebody say, "Brother
[1:55:35] Andrew, things are rough. Things are
[1:55:36] bad.
[1:55:40] But I love what a prophet
[1:55:43] said. He said, "If your sick sense is
[1:55:45] alive
[1:55:47] tonight, this is the last hour of your
[1:55:51] suffering."
[1:55:55] And he says, "If you got that six
[1:55:58] sense, it's ready to be made alive.
[1:56:02] So, let's make it."
[1:56:05] Amen. Amen. He said, "Brother Andrew,
[1:56:08] how does that six sense come alive?"
[1:56:10] Brother Peter, it's a very beautiful
[1:56:11] thing. It comes alive by manifested
[1:56:14] word. Amen.
[1:56:17] Being revealed to you.
[1:56:20] Hallelujah.
[1:56:22] Well, Andrew, I don't know what my
[1:56:26] future holds. Okay? I'm not bowing my
[1:56:30] knee down to the five senses. Come on,
[1:56:33] man. I'm going to tell you what your
[1:56:35] future holds. Victory.
[1:56:38] Hallelujah. Rapture.
[1:56:41] Body change. Say, "Brother Andrew, how
[1:56:44] can you say that? You don't know my
[1:56:45] future. You've never been in it. I'm
[1:56:47] preaching about the one that's already
[1:56:48] been there.
[1:56:52] He holds your future."
[1:56:55] I want you to bow your hearts with us
[1:56:57] tonight.
[1:57:00] If you are alive with that six
[1:57:03] sense, this is the last hour of your
[1:57:08] suffering. This is the last hour of your
[1:57:13] suffering. Oh, I wonder tonight with
[1:57:15] every head bowed, every eye
[1:57:18] closed, how many is ready to get a hold
[1:57:20] of that six
[1:57:23] sense? Now listen, it's going to take
[1:57:26] that six sense to pull you through them
[1:57:28] hard
[1:57:30] times. That that that feeling and that
[1:57:33] that that real high that you get, that's
[1:57:36] wonderful. We enjoy it. But sometimes
[1:57:38] that'll leave you. But you got to have
[1:57:40] that sick sense on the inside of you.
[1:57:45] And when Job had come to his wits end,
[1:57:47] he couldn't see no further. He couldn't
[1:57:49] go no further. God in his mercy come
[1:57:51] down to Job and gave him that six sense,
[1:57:56] gave him another sense, gave him a
[1:57:58] vision, gave him a revelation, imparted
[1:58:02] a faith in his
[1:58:03] soul. I say this tonight to you on the
[1:58:06] on the basis of the word of God. God of
[1:58:09] Job is in this building tonight and he's
[1:58:13] moving throughout this building right
[1:58:14] now. He's touching hearts and he's
[1:58:17] touching lives right now. I see the
[1:58:19] influence of his presence moving upon
[1:58:21] the hearts of his children right
[1:58:23] now. He's here. He's here right
[1:58:27] now. Let him impart to you the same
[1:58:31] thing he imparted to
[1:58:34] Job. Almighty
[1:58:36] God, we worship you in this building
[1:58:39] tonight. We reverence your presence in
[1:58:42] this
[1:58:43] sanctuary. We adore you. We lift you up
[1:58:46] above every problem, above every
[1:58:48] situation. Lord, you are the God that is
[1:58:51] above all. You are the God. There's no
[1:58:53] God beside you. There's no God with you.
[1:58:56] There's no God above you. You are God
[1:58:58] and you are God alone. And Lord, you're
[1:59:01] right here in this building tonight,
[1:59:02] Lord. Father, you've come down in the
[1:59:04] preaching of the message of the hour.
[1:59:07] And father, while the world is is
[1:59:08] fulfilling their part, while the world
[1:59:11] is moving under the spirit of perversion
[1:59:13] and under the spirit of rebellion and
[1:59:15] destruction, Father, you have given a
[1:59:17] grace through this message. Lord, you've
[1:59:20] given a grace to the revealing of the
[1:59:22] son of man. Through the revelation of
[1:59:24] Jesus Christ through this message,
[1:59:26] there's a grace been open to hearts and
[1:59:28] lives. Father, I rebuke every enemy
[1:59:31] right now in this building that's trying
[1:59:32] to hold your precious children. Father,
[1:59:35] every situation that's trying to grip
[1:59:37] them and is trying to interpret their
[1:59:39] future and interpret the way they're
[1:59:40] going to be. Father, I rebuke that
[1:59:42] spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:44] Christ. Father, upon the authority of
[1:59:47] your word, we have not come here for
[1:59:49] former fashion. But Lord, we have come
[1:59:51] here to worship you and serve you. And
[1:59:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:59:55] may every spirit contrary to the six
[1:59:57] sense, may it be paralyzed right now in
[2:00:00] the name of Jesus Christ. Father, if
[2:00:03] there's a job here tonight, Lord, that's
[2:00:05] sitting on the ash heap. They're at the
[2:00:07] bottom of the barrel, as it were, Lord,
[2:00:09] they're at their wits end. Lord, may
[2:00:11] this be the night, dear God, that they
[2:00:13] receive that sense the same way Job did.
[2:00:16] Lord, may this be the night suffering
[2:00:18] ends. Oh God, we thank you for it
[2:00:21] tonight, Lord. We thank you for it
[2:00:23] tonight, Lord, in the name of the Lord
[2:00:26] Jesus Christ.
[2:00:29] In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:31] Christ. Brother Matt, would you come in
[2:00:34] the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:36] Christ? Oh, just close your eyes right
[2:00:38] now and raise up your hands. You say,
[2:00:41] "Brother Andrew, I'm at that that
[2:00:43] crucial hour. I'm at that crucial moment
[2:00:46] right now on this trial. I'm in a
[2:00:48] crucial moment right now." I heard the
[2:00:50] prophet of God say today, he said, "In
[2:00:53] that crucial moment is when the sixth
[2:00:54] sense rises up." He said, "It's in that
[2:00:57] crucial moment that the six sense comes
[2:00:59] in and begins to dominate every feeling
[2:01:02] and every emotion and every situation. I
[2:01:04] believe it's right here tonight in this
[2:01:06] building in the name of Jesus
[2:01:09] Christ." It's already claimed you. It's
[2:01:12] already claimed you for its
[2:01:15] fulfillment. Hallelujah.

[2:36:03] know that song. Amen. Go ahead and sing
[2:36:07] it then. I don't. Amen. You love the
[2:36:10] Lord tonight. Brother Andrew, he said he
[2:36:12] said they woke up. What a quote. They
[2:36:14] woke up with the same anticipation they
[2:36:15] went to sleep with. I got news for
[2:36:18] y'all. Glory to God. They woke up with
[2:36:21] the same anticipation that that means
[2:36:22] some people's going to wake up with a
[2:36:24] headache. Some people might wake up
[2:36:26] looking around for all the critics. Some
[2:36:27] people's going to wake up going, "Where
[2:36:28] are all the hypocrites at? I ain't seen
[2:36:30] him around." But some of us are going to
[2:36:32] wake up saying, "Where's my Lord? I've
[2:36:34] been waiting on him. I I went to sleep
[2:36:35] anticipating the coming of the Lord. And
[2:36:37] I woke up that same way. Let me ask you
[2:36:40] a question tonight. Let me I'm just
[2:36:41] going to call you on the carpet. How are
[2:36:43] you going to wake up? How will you wake
[2:36:46] up? My You just made me want to preach.
[2:36:49] I'm going to wake up with the same
[2:36:51] anticipation I went to sleep with. Well,
[2:36:53] what kind of anticipation you got?
[2:36:54] That's what you're going to wake up
[2:36:55] with. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:36:59] I'm going to wake up expecting the Lord
[2:37:01] to come right in the middle of the
[2:37:02] meeting. I ain't never had a church
[2:37:04] service I didn't expect to rapture out
[2:37:06] of. right in the middle of it. Amen. The
[2:37:08] Lord comes said every one of those men.
[2:37:11] Isn't it something? You know why God
[2:37:13] done that? I just can I just interject
[2:37:15] something here? You know why God done
[2:37:16] that? Because if he wouldn't have done
[2:37:18] that to those men, if they didn't, if he
[2:37:20] would have told them, you think about
[2:37:22] it, 2,000 years ago, if he would have
[2:37:23] told Paul, "Don't worry, Paul. It'll be
[2:37:26] 2,000 years from now before this coming
[2:37:28] ever happened." So tell the folks not to
[2:37:30] worry, then none of them would went to
[2:37:31] sleep with that anticipation
[2:37:34] because it wasn't going to happen for
[2:37:35] 2,000 years. But every one of them lived
[2:37:37] that very day. Every day anticipating
[2:37:40] today's going to be the last day. The
[2:37:41] Lord's coming today. And they told it to
[2:37:43] their children and generation upon
[2:37:45] generation have slept with that same
[2:37:47] belief and they passed it on. I thank
[2:37:49] God they did because that's what gave us
[2:37:50] this anticipation today. That
[2:37:53] expectation today is cuz somebody went
[2:37:55] to sleep expecting it and told their
[2:37:56] children and they went to sleep
[2:37:58] expecting it and told their children. I
[2:37:59] thank God that I got the opportunity to
[2:38:01] tell it to my children and and
[2:38:03] grandchildren that the Lord is coming.
[2:38:05] It ain't just something a history book
[2:38:07] or something or some fairy tale, but our
[2:38:10] Lord is coming back to earth again. How
[2:38:12] many believe it tonight? We're
[2:38:14] anticipating the coming of the Lord.
[2:38:16] Isn't God wonderful tonight? Well, ain't
[2:38:18] God bless you tonight as you go. Well,
[2:38:20] ain't God
[2:38:22] good to give us so many blessings
[2:38:27] undeserving. That's what we are. We
[2:38:31] ought to thank him, love and praise him
[2:38:36] a little more today and a whole lot
[2:38:39] more.
[2:38:41] Well, ain't God
[2:38:43] good to give us so many blessings
[2:38:48] undeserving. That's what we are. We
[2:38:52] ought to thank him. Love and praise him
[2:38:56] a little more today and a whole lot more
[2:39:00] tomorrow. Well, ain't God good?
[2:39:04] Give us so many blessings.
[2:39:09] That's what we
