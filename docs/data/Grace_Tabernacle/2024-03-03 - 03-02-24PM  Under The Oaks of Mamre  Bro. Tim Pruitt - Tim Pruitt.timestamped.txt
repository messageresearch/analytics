[47:36] in the lowest gutter of hell and down in
[47:40] the in the depths of sin and the reason

[53:27] good things so that your youth is
[53:30] renewed like the eagles amen and you I
[53:33] think it was about
[53:35] 1978 about 46 years ago when I was a
[53:39] young man of 24 years old little younger
[53:42] brother Andrew there even you know and I
[53:44] was invited this part of Arkansas to
[53:47] preach for brother Henry darus over at
[53:49] White Oak how how many would would have
[53:51] been in that meeting let me see your
[53:53] hands oh goodness a dozen or more here
[53:57] why you had to be just a
[53:59] child amen well anyway um you know we
[54:03] had some wonderful times together and I
[54:06] think you know how many have crossed the
[54:08] river between Mortal and immortality and
[54:11] are a waiting us on the other side I
[54:13] think of those precious Souls brother
[54:15] and sister darus Sister Bailey that
[54:18] prayer Warrior that prayed for me so
[54:21] many times and so many others and you
[54:24] know uh my wife wife sister Karen was
[54:26] just a girl and she now is there waiting
[54:29] for her change and and how many how many
[54:32] more will cross the The Divide between
[54:36] Time and Eternity I I don't know but one
[54:39] day the last one will cross and God will
[54:42] call a halt to this Mortal season and
[54:45] the ones who there are there will come
[54:48] to be resurrected and we'll see them to
[54:50] be chained in a moment in the twinkling
[54:53] of an eye and I'm here to encourage you
[54:56] tonight to keep pressing the battle Amen
[54:59] to keep moving on you know none of us
[55:02] can grasp the great joy that lays ahead
[55:06] but I'm just going to just say something
[55:08] about that just a moment even if there
[55:10] is no Heaven even if all of life just
[55:14] ends here with our last breath this is
[55:18] this right here the life that we live as
[55:21] Christians makes it heaven on Earth
[55:26] a life of sin makes it hell on Earth
[55:30] that's right and so you know this Earth
[55:32] that you live in for some for some this
[55:35] is the closest they will ever get to
[55:38] heaven and for others this life that
[55:41] they live in as Christians this is the
[55:43] closest will'll ever come to
[55:47] Hell amen so together we'll press on
[55:51] Amen Genesis chapter 18 verse one you've
[55:54] been such a a great audience every night
[55:57] for the brothers that are speaking and
[55:59] and I hope that I won't weary you um I'm
[56:02] not as young as they are it takes me a
[56:04] little longer than them takes me a long
[56:07] Runway to get started do I need do I
[56:09] need that they think this one's a
[56:23] little they got to undress me before I
[56:26] can
[56:32] preach Genesis 18 and verse one that
[56:35] sounds a lot better yeah are you just
[56:38] now here I'm here
[56:41] now you've heard everything okay Genesis
[56:43] 18 and verse one and the Lord appeared
[56:46] unto him in the plains of mammory and he
[56:50] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[56:52] day and he lift up his eyes and and
[56:55] looked and lo three men stood by him and
[56:58] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[57:00] from the tent door and bowed himself
[57:02] toward the ground and said my Lord if
[57:06] now I have found favor in thy sight pass
[57:10] not away I pray thee from thy
[57:12] servant let a little water I pray you be
[57:15] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[57:18] yourself under the tree and I will fetch
[57:21] a morcel of bread and comfort you your
[57:24] heart Hearts after that you shall pass
[57:26] on so therefore you come to your servant
[57:29] and they said so do as I was said and
[57:33] Abraham hastened un the tent unto unto
[57:37] Sarah and said make ready quickly three
[57:40] measures of fine meal needed and make
[57:42] cakes upon the heart and Abraham ran
[57:46] unto the herd and fetched a CA calf
[57:48] tender and good and gave it to the unto
[57:51] a young man and he hasted to dress it
[57:54] and he took butter and milk and the calf
[57:57] which he had dressed and set it before
[58:01] them and he stood by them under the tree
[58:05] and they did eat God bless you you can
[58:07] be seated tonight I'm going to speak to
[58:09] you under the Oaks at
[58:16] mamry the appearing of of Elohim here to
[58:22] Abraham it is the Apex or the summit or
[58:25] the Capstone the highest point of all
[58:27] the appearing and and here it will
[58:32] conclude with the coming of the promised
[58:36] son this is of one of the greatest of
[58:40] all the appearing that God did in that
[58:42] age in that time he' already appeared as
[58:45] elhadi the pouring out of the Holy Ghost
[58:48] as it were and now it
[58:50] crescendos into God manifesting the
[58:53] flesh
[58:55] and this would be the capping off of all
[58:57] the visitations of Elohim God had led
[59:00] him from the ER of the
[59:02] Chans appearing in the land of of of his
[59:06] of his father and and this caused Abram
[59:08] the idol worshipper to start seeking a
[59:11] city whose Builder and maker was God and
[59:15] in all the visitations from the age of
[59:18] 75 whether by voice or whether by dream
[59:21] or by vision of Elohim this now now what
[59:25] we just read tonight is the greatest for
[59:28] God has now come to him manifested in
[59:32] flesh so then this manifestation was
[59:36] more real more physical for it was like
[59:40] the fullness of all the
[59:42] manifestations of divine presence when
[59:45] the word was made flesh as it would be
[59:48] later in Jesus Christ and let me say
[59:52] this tonight that the appearing of God
[59:54] in in this last day
[1:00:23] is
[1:01:28] he would tell us that God is a great
[1:01:31] like a great contractor he actually laid
[1:01:35] your bodies out here on the Earth every
[1:01:39] element needed to make your human body
[1:01:43] so he said what are you made of like
[1:01:45] petroleum and potass and calcium my body
[1:01:48] was laying right here upon the Earth and
[1:01:52] when the Holy Spirit began to bruise or
[1:01:54] to cool like a dove or like a hen mother
[1:01:57] over the Earth there was nothing but
[1:01:59] volcanic eruptions and God moved this
[1:02:02] old star around the Sun and make make
[1:02:05] him poish and calcium and he was a great
[1:02:08] contractor and he was laying out the
[1:02:10] lumber to build
[1:02:13] houses and he said our bodies were on
[1:02:16] the Earth right then amen so you're
[1:02:19] going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so
[1:02:21] you might as well get started that'll
[1:02:23] make a holy roll out of
[1:02:25] you to think about that tonight you
[1:02:28] never originally belonged to the
[1:02:32] devil your body was never intended for
[1:02:35] the devil to inhabit you belong to God
[1:02:39] Amen in the mind of God before the
[1:02:41] foundation of the world and even your
[1:02:43] body was already claimed by God before
[1:02:47] the devil ever come to defile
[1:02:50] it so when I know that God had me in his
[1:02:53] mind when he made the Earth he made my
[1:02:56] body there if he didn't where did it
[1:02:58] come from amen he sent the Holy Spirit
[1:03:01] forth said brood of the earth and he
[1:03:03] began to coup and and the first thing a
[1:03:05] little poach a little calcium run
[1:03:07] together a little Easter lily stuck his
[1:03:10] head up and said that's beautiful and he
[1:03:11] just kept cing and then out of the
[1:03:13] ground came birds and out of there came
[1:03:16] trees and and the animals and then come
[1:03:19] a man in the image of God and then man
[1:03:22] sinned and it brought on this sexual
[1:03:25] Affair that we have now but God is still
[1:03:28] using his material and he will raise it
[1:03:31] up again in the last day God cannot be
[1:03:36] defeated his purpose is perfect just as
[1:03:40] certain as you are born again why if
[1:03:43] that Holy Spirit made me what I am
[1:03:46] without having a choice how much more
[1:03:49] can he Raise Me Up Again by taking a
[1:03:52] choice by that same spirit that CS over
[1:03:55] me I'm the Lord that forgiveth all thine
[1:03:58] iniquities I am the one that wants to
[1:04:00] come and live Into You Me Lord yes you
[1:04:04] I'm calling you I've called you before
[1:04:06] the foundation of the earth I want to
[1:04:09] come into you and raise you up to the
[1:04:11] last day and give you eternal life oh
[1:04:14] Lord come on and the Holy Spirit comes
[1:04:17] in and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:04:19] whereby you are sealed to the day of
[1:04:21] redemption so he said what are you
[1:04:23] scared about
[1:04:26] amen think about it your very body
[1:04:29] belongs to
[1:04:30] God Amen your soul belongs to God you
[1:04:34] belong to God Amen God as he said in the
[1:04:38] four seal is like a big contractor lays
[1:04:40] all his material out on the earth and
[1:04:42] then he starts building and remember for
[1:04:45] there was a grain of seed on the earth
[1:04:48] before there was a sun that struck the
[1:04:49] Earth your body was laying on the earth
[1:04:52] cuz your dust of the Earth you see you
[1:04:55] are God is the contractor and the way he
[1:04:59] was going to do it was reach down and
[1:05:01] get like Adam a little bit of calcium
[1:05:04] and poish and Cosmic light and and and
[1:05:08] say there's my other son and then bring
[1:05:10] up more and then come another and then
[1:05:13] another you wonder how it would have
[1:05:14] been if we wouldn't have come through
[1:05:15] sexual birth that's the way it would
[1:05:17] have been he' have just gathered another
[1:05:19] Cosmic light and petroleum and amen and
[1:05:23] stepped in another
[1:05:24] right but he said what did Eve do she
[1:05:26] corrupted that way and brought it
[1:05:28] through a sexual act and then death
[1:05:31] Struck it and now what's got going to do
[1:05:33] he's he's got so many of those seeds
[1:05:36] down through there that's
[1:05:37] predestinated and then at the end time
[1:05:40] he won't say Eve come and bear another
[1:05:42] child he will say and we'll call and I
[1:05:46] will answer amen and when the last one
[1:05:49] comes in that settles
[1:05:51] it amen now that's the kind of God we
[1:05:54] are serving tonight that's the kind of
[1:05:57] omnipotence that we are serving tonight
[1:05:59] so what have we got to worry about yeah
[1:06:02] there's trouble in the land yes it's
[1:06:05] it's a horrible day that we're living in
[1:06:07] it's Sodom hour it's a Noah hour it's an
[1:06:10] end time hour but what have we got to
[1:06:12] worry
[1:06:14] about Hallelujah God's got this all
[1:06:17] pre-planned before the world began and
[1:06:20] nothing going to interrupt his plan and
[1:06:23] he is planned to Rapture a way of escape
[1:06:26] and we're going to take it instead of
[1:06:28] going through the
[1:06:30] tribulation what a promise that
[1:06:32] is and one of these
[1:06:35] days the all these atoms that's holding
[1:06:37] these bodies together it's going to be
[1:06:39] broke away and we're going to go back to
[1:06:40] dust and the light's going back and the
[1:06:42] other parts of the earth going back to
[1:06:44] its place but at the resurrection
[1:06:46] he'll step right into
[1:06:49] it amen you talk about the Breath of God
[1:06:53] that's what the Breath of God is doing
[1:06:55] the Winds of the Holy Spirit the Breath
[1:06:58] of God that you feel uh that is blowing
[1:07:02] through this church will blow in such a
[1:07:04] way that the dust from the earth will
[1:07:07] rise and will form bodies and
[1:07:10] theophanies that are on the other side
[1:07:12] will come and move into them and we will
[1:07:15] Embrace and talk with them amen you talk
[1:07:18] about an appearing they will appear to
[1:07:22] us hallelujah and then that same baptism
[1:07:25] of the holy spirit will blow over us
[1:07:27] over these mortal bodies and our dust
[1:07:31] will be
[1:07:32] glorified dust that can move through
[1:07:36] walls transcend dimensions and travel
[1:07:39] like a
[1:07:41] thought hallelujah we're we're on one of
[1:07:44] the cusp of the greatest event that has
[1:07:47] ever taken place you want to say well
[1:07:50] Divine Healing is Over You Ain't Seen
[1:07:52] Nothing To what's coming gray hair is
[1:07:55] coming back the right color again amen
[1:07:58] you can't take all of those false body
[1:08:00] parts that you're getting of these
[1:08:01] joints and kneecaps and everything else
[1:08:04] and your false teeth I mean you won't
[1:08:05] need them over
[1:08:07] there Hallelujah you're going to be
[1:08:09] chained in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:08:11] an eye what a promise that is you see
[1:08:15] and brother BR said you see these little
[1:08:17] pockets going to the air they call S
[1:08:19] saucers he said well we better leave
[1:08:21] that alone here all these people come up
[1:08:23] missing do you don't hear from them
[1:08:25] they're standing there and they're not
[1:08:26] there well that's the way the Rapture is
[1:08:28] going to be one of them will drop down
[1:08:31] and this terestrial body will take on a
[1:08:33] Celestial body and there'll be hi hair
[1:08:35] of Bones left and it'll be transformed
[1:08:37] in a moment of time dropping right out
[1:08:40] of space and taking home
[1:08:42] that oh he said the pentagon's wondering
[1:08:45] about all these Mystic lights but they
[1:08:48] don't they don't know what it is but
[1:08:51] listen little children it's going to
[1:08:53] pick you up up one of these days that
[1:08:56] Pillar of Fire that we saw witnessed in
[1:08:58] a picture that Pillar of Fire that me as
[1:09:01] a boy you know would would watch the
[1:09:03] effects of it as it called out people
[1:09:06] and and their names and where they were
[1:09:08] from and everything else as I sat in the
[1:09:10] meetings of brother Brandon let me tell
[1:09:12] you one day that same Pillar of Fire is
[1:09:16] going to sweep over you amen and change
[1:09:19] your mortal body amen we are here in the
[1:09:23] very hour
[1:09:26] and the scripture is saying right here
[1:09:28] it's showing you by prophecy what would
[1:09:32] happen here at the end
[1:09:34] time oh he said well after a while the
[1:09:37] church would it can stay in that place
[1:09:39] every seed has been brought to his
[1:09:42] spot they'll be gone they won't know
[1:09:44] what happened to them one will be going
[1:09:46] this way one will go over to the
[1:09:47] pastor's house and one would be going
[1:09:49] here or down there and the first thing
[1:09:51] you know they're not there for Enoch was
[1:09:53] the T God took him and he was found not
[1:09:56] come down to investigate well what's he
[1:09:59] investigating what's he looking for when
[1:10:02] Jesus told us what he'd be looking for
[1:10:05] when the son of man cometh will I find
[1:10:11] faith and that is what the appearing of
[1:10:14] the Lord is is to turn our hearts back
[1:10:17] to believing
[1:10:18] again to restore that Faith at his
[1:10:23] appear to Abraham he as King theophany
[1:10:27] created a body for himself and for two
[1:10:30] angels to dwell in now why did he do it
[1:10:33] this way well Redemption by the blood of
[1:10:36] the Lord Jesus had not been yet done the
[1:10:40] blood had not been shed God couldn't
[1:10:42] come and dwell in sinful men for the
[1:10:45] blood of bulls and goats could not take
[1:10:46] away
[1:10:47] sin so so you know he to Abraham he came
[1:10:52] down and created
[1:10:54] bodies but
[1:10:56] now in our day he comes down in redeemed
[1:11:01] bodies cuz we're on the other side of
[1:11:03] the
[1:11:04] Cross Hallelujah so he comes down and
[1:11:07] redeem bodies and this is why for I
[1:11:11] appearing that he uses redeemed elect
[1:11:15] people to appear in like brother Bram
[1:11:19] said in the message Abraham he said he's
[1:11:21] here I can say that in the name of the
[1:11:24] Lord think he is now he can use my flesh
[1:11:28] the same as he could create
[1:11:31] some cuz he made me anyhow you could he
[1:11:34] could use your flesh he created and made
[1:11:38] you don't think don't don't you think
[1:11:40] that now if you just open up your heart
[1:11:42] and get yourself out of the way he'll
[1:11:43] come in and can use you he's the same
[1:11:46] God he gives the same signs so in this
[1:11:49] day he you can use your body he doesn't
[1:11:52] have to create him one
[1:11:54] all he has to do is redeem it by his
[1:11:57] blood and come and dwell in
[1:12:00] it so where is he appearing today amen
[1:12:06] he's appearing in his
[1:12:10] people you see the appearing is not his
[1:12:13] coming he will come in a Corporal body
[1:12:17] the Lord Jesus that's the Capstone of
[1:12:20] all of his appearing it will cresendo
[1:12:23] into the the visible physical
[1:12:27] manifestation of Jesus Christ and we
[1:12:29] will meet him in the air that's what
[1:12:31] Believers believe as brother Bram said
[1:12:34] in three kinds of Believers there is a
[1:12:36] heaven and a there's a literal Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ there that will come in a body
[1:12:42] form to receive his him his church to
[1:12:44] himself no matter how old the story
[1:12:46] seems is still the truth God said so
[1:12:49] that's what Believers believe I'm a
[1:12:51] Believer tonight so I believe in the
[1:12:54] physical return the literal body of
[1:12:58] Jesus Christ we will meet him in the
[1:13:02] air and that's what the appearing will
[1:13:05] cresendo into is his
[1:13:08] coming now I'm a thoroughbred
[1:13:11] believer and I heard someone say a
[1:13:14] preacher so about to come to the Lord I
[1:13:17] don't believe in that Pentecostal pack
[1:13:18] of Lies but I'll tell you a born again
[1:13:21] man or woman is just as sure as a coming
[1:13:23] of the Lord Jesus they're just as sure
[1:13:26] they got the Holy Ghost as there is a
[1:13:28] holy ghost to be
[1:13:29] given amen now brother bradam said this
[1:13:32] about it he said now we see his word
[1:13:36] Vindicated we believe he Vindicated his
[1:13:38] word of today what is it what do I care
[1:13:41] about what the year brings oh
[1:13:45] yeah what do I care about next year what
[1:13:47] do I care whether I live today or die
[1:13:50] today every word that he promise will be
[1:13:53] he Vindicated everyone if he's able to
[1:13:56] do it today after promising it 2,000
[1:13:59] years ago if it's a 100,000
[1:14:04] years on Jesus will return to the Earth
[1:14:09] in a visible body for a church a
[1:14:12] redeemed the bride and take her out of
[1:14:15] here and where regardless of what comes
[1:14:17] and goes of Fashions saying go on and
[1:14:20] people can wait on into total darkness
[1:14:22] and believe anything say they want to
[1:14:24] believe but Jesus Christ will return
[1:14:28] again for your reference that's the
[1:14:30] message
[1:14:31] Shalom now so you know there's going to
[1:14:33] be a bunch of missing
[1:14:36] people amen you see because we will be
[1:14:40] caught up together to meet the Lord and
[1:14:42] the air as he said think of it and going
[1:14:44] beyond the camp think of it missing
[1:14:47] people amen they can't see you no more
[1:14:51] but you're getting together with the
[1:14:52] rest of the
[1:14:54] group think about it when we see those
[1:14:57] in theophanies come back and take on and
[1:14:59] glorify that
[1:15:02] dust and when we see them we're going to
[1:15:05] be changed to be exactly like them and
[1:15:07] the world won't see them and the world
[1:15:09] won't see us but we'll be getting
[1:15:11] together with the rest of
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:14] them for they which are alive and remain
[1:15:18] through the coming of the Lord will not
[1:15:20] prevent those that are asleep or hinder
[1:15:22] them
[1:15:24] there's going to be somebody I love that
[1:15:26] somebody
[1:15:27] alive somebody remaining true somebody
[1:15:32] steadfast somebody that knows their God
[1:15:35] somebody that can do exploits there's
[1:15:38] going to be somebody alive and remain at
[1:15:41] the coming of the Lord a Living Church
[1:15:44] who knows a living God with a living
[1:15:47] power and the resurrected
[1:15:52] Christ missing
[1:15:54] people
[1:15:57] hallelujah he said
[1:15:59] no those those which are asleep they're
[1:16:03] not dead Christians don't
[1:16:06] die they're just taking a little
[1:16:09] rest amen that's all and the Trump of
[1:16:11] God shall sound and the dead in Christ
[1:16:13] shall rise first and appear to many and
[1:16:16] all at once you happen to stand there
[1:16:18] and look and there's a brother and you
[1:16:22] know it ain't long in a few minutes we
[1:16:24] chains in a moment twinkling of an eye
[1:16:27] together with them be missing on the
[1:16:29] Earth Caught Up to meet the Lord in the
[1:16:33] air
[1:16:35] Hallelujah now that is the Blessed
[1:16:39] hope of all True
[1:16:41] Believers and we must never and and I'm
[1:16:44] I'm I'm doing this on purpose because I
[1:16:46] want to establish this as we talk about
[1:16:49] this appearing as he did Under The Oaks
[1:16:51] at mamry but I establish that we have a
[1:16:54] blessed
[1:16:55] hope of all True Believers have that
[1:16:59] hope and we must not let Satan minimize
[1:17:03] his physical
[1:17:05] return but at the same time we must
[1:17:08] recognize his
[1:17:13] appearing and we have a church world who
[1:17:15] are given lip service to the Corporal
[1:17:18] coming of of the Lord all the while not
[1:17:21] recognizing his appearing
[1:17:24] and right now is
[1:17:25] disappearing he's appearing today in
[1:17:29] bright
[1:17:31] form amen with Revelation with signs
[1:17:35] with wonders and the five-fold gifts of
[1:17:38] ministry and helps and tongues and
[1:17:40] interpretation and prophecy and word of
[1:17:43] knowledge and miracles and faith and the
[1:17:45] same works that Jesus
[1:17:47] did amen that we do all we do also right
[1:17:52] now because we are the
[1:17:55] continuation of the book of
[1:17:58] Acts now many may not recognize him
[1:18:01] because they don't believe him to be
[1:18:03] alive and there's no expectation of a
[1:18:06] resurrected
[1:18:08] Christ and there there in the heat of
[1:18:10] the day and brother it's
[1:18:14] hot hell is moving closer all the
[1:18:17] time kind of like last summer you know
[1:18:20] we had a lot of days in Louisiana I'm
[1:18:22] pretty sure you did too you're too close
[1:18:23] to us that was you know pressing right
[1:18:26] around 100
[1:18:28] Mark finally you know I said to Timothy
[1:18:32] I said son you're going to have to find
[1:18:33] us a place to move because hell is moved
[1:18:40] here but you know that's kind of the way
[1:18:42] we feel you know here we are sitting in
[1:18:45] the
[1:18:46] tent as it was like Sarah
[1:18:50] was hoping politics Will Change
[1:18:53] change hoping my vot to make things
[1:18:59] better but you see the bride of Christ
[1:19:02] like Abraham is there in the tent of
[1:19:04] that door the door of that tent and
[1:19:07] they're watching for the appearing of
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] supernatural he's passing by and I'm not
[1:19:12] going to miss
[1:19:13] him amen I'm going to be a part of his
[1:19:18] visitation amen now like the amazing
[1:19:21] mayus walk in Mark
[1:19:24] 16:12 the Bible said after his
[1:19:27] resurrection that he
[1:19:29] appeared in another form unto two of
[1:19:32] them as they walked and went into the
[1:19:36] country he appeared in another
[1:19:40] form now you've got to recognize the
[1:19:43] form that he's appearing
[1:19:45] in now and I want to say again he is
[1:19:50] here today in bridei form that's the
[1:19:54] form he's appearing in now again in
[1:19:58] God's provided way brother bradam said
[1:20:00] remember these two words for I leave you
[1:20:02] the appearing of Christ and the coming
[1:20:03] of Christ to two different things Christ
[1:20:06] is now appearing in the fullness of his
[1:20:09] power his coming will be afterwards his
[1:20:12] appearing before his coming so he says
[1:20:14] before that before that meeting in the
[1:20:17] air that we just preached about he's
[1:20:19] going to have an appearing he's going to
[1:20:21] be appearing but it will be in another
[1:20:25] form because you see 2,000 years ago he
[1:20:29] he came and he would reveal himself in
[1:20:31] the groom but in this day he is
[1:20:34] revealing himself in a
[1:20:36] bride in a people for his name's sake
[1:20:40] and so we are here in the hour of the
[1:20:43] Bride coming of Christ this is the bride
[1:20:45] age this is the age of the elect Lady
[1:20:49] this is the token age with the literal
[1:20:51] Life of Christ Is possessing a people in
[1:20:54] this day and hour and so we're here we
[1:20:57] know we're at the end of civilization it
[1:20:59] has come from the the East following the
[1:21:01] sun Westward and it's now at the west
[1:21:04] but it's turning back to the east again
[1:21:06] and the gospel is going there again
[1:21:08] today I had the privilege of of
[1:21:11] sponsoring the in the Japanese language
[1:21:14] another 10 sermons of brother brandom's
[1:21:16] you know because over there by by God's
[1:21:19] grace we've helped from our church
[1:21:21] helped establish a little group of
[1:21:23] people over there and they've named
[1:21:25] their their church the church of the
[1:21:27] Rising
[1:21:30] Sun you see the gospel is going back to
[1:21:33] the East and it's going to go to
[1:21:35] Jerusalem you know it'll go back to the
[1:21:38] Jews so it's headed on its way back but
[1:21:42] we're here still now at the evening time
[1:21:45] of the Gentile dispensation and we know
[1:21:48] the scripture said it shall be light in
[1:21:50] the evening
[1:21:51] time so brother brandom said how many
[1:21:54] knows there's a difference between the
[1:21:56] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:21:57] Christ it's two different words now the
[1:22:00] is the appearing the coming will soon be
[1:22:02] he's appearing in the midst of us doing
[1:22:05] the works that he did once in his church
[1:22:08] now you're a part of that church and by
[1:22:09] Grace you believe and I'm a member of
[1:22:11] that church now I want to read it just
[1:22:13] the way he said it now I'm not a
[1:22:15] preacher you know that no I'm not I have
[1:22:18] not the education to do that sometimes I
[1:22:20] feel reluctant standing here by men of
[1:22:23] God who's called to that office there
[1:22:25] our Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:22:27] evangelists not all our Apostles not all
[1:22:29] our prophets not all our teachers not
[1:22:31] all are evangelists but my Ministry is a
[1:22:34] different Ministry from a pastor or
[1:22:36] teacher I'm not uh and if I say things
[1:22:38] wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean
[1:22:40] it but this is my Ministry to declare
[1:22:45] him that he is
[1:22:50] here so I want you to know the ministry
[1:22:53] in this day that come from a prophet of
[1:22:56] God was to declare that Christ is here
[1:22:59] yes he's coming and we'll meet him in
[1:23:02] the air but he's here right
[1:23:05] now amen he's here not not present in
[1:23:09] the body of Jesus as in the Corporal
[1:23:11] coming but in his
[1:23:14] appearing now there's a difference
[1:23:16] between his appearing and his coming and
[1:23:17] his appearing he's present in spirit
[1:23:20] form to impart re Revelation Faith
[1:23:24] understanding and yet something more
[1:23:27] than just theology but he's appeared to
[1:23:30] reveal mystery truths but also to reveal
[1:23:34] the mystery of Faith and Healing and
[1:23:36] miracles he's appearing to his elect
[1:23:40] lady to get her to
[1:23:42] believing you see this was the problem
[1:23:45] right there here here was Sarah the old
[1:23:47] woman the church and she was having a
[1:23:50] problem believing
[1:23:54] that she was going to receive the
[1:23:55] promised
[1:23:58] son she was full of doubt and unbelief
[1:24:01] and everything else that was a condition
[1:24:04] we were in a 2,000 year old church
[1:24:07] decrepit old cranky in dogmas man's
[1:24:11] ideas and you know had our theories and
[1:24:14] had our Hagar moments and ismeal and
[1:24:17] wild seeds and everything else that had
[1:24:19] come out of
[1:24:21] unbelief
[1:24:23] amen but God was appearing there because
[1:24:26] he had to get Sarah on board he had to
[1:24:29] get the church to believe in again and
[1:24:33] that's what God is doing in this day and
[1:24:35] hour is getting you back to Faith back
[1:24:38] to believe
[1:24:41] him now his appearing is not his coming
[1:24:46] his coming is a physical Corporal body
[1:24:49] coming to resurrect the Saints take us
[1:24:52] in Rapture meeting in the air and I'm
[1:24:54] not repetitive because I'm old I'm
[1:24:57] repetitive because you're
[1:25:00] old I'm talking to you
[1:25:03] Sarah I want you to get
[1:25:06] it amen again I want you to get it his
[1:25:10] appearing is not his coming his coming
[1:25:13] is his physical body coming to resurrect
[1:25:17] the Saints and take us in the Rapture of
[1:25:20] meeting in the air and brother Bron's
[1:25:22] Ministry
[1:25:24] declared that Christ is here in what
[1:25:28] form the Holy Ghost and he can heal any
[1:25:32] sickness even the sickness of the church
[1:25:35] because we have been sick with false
[1:25:37] doctrines and Creeds of man but I we had
[1:25:41] to have a
[1:25:44] healing we have to start believing that
[1:25:47] there's nothing too hard for the
[1:25:50] Lord you see see if we can't believe for
[1:25:54] healing Divine Healing how are we going
[1:25:56] to believe for the change of our
[1:25:58] body you see every man who God has
[1:26:02] appeared to is called to even pray for
[1:26:06] the sick these signs shall follow them
[1:26:10] that
[1:26:11] believe his ministry declared that he is
[1:26:14] here to save The vient
[1:26:17] Sinner he is not here with no
[1:26:21] mercy he is here pouring out
[1:26:24] Mercy Grace upon
[1:26:26] Grace Hallelujah brother Brandon
[1:26:28] preached us a message of Grace he
[1:26:30] preached a god rich in Mercy not a God
[1:26:34] out of Mercy not a god that is spurning
[1:26:37] people a god rich in Mercy a god who's
[1:26:41] sending a last call because he don't
[1:26:43] want any to perish to give everybody an
[1:26:48] opportunity and he's such a God that
[1:26:51] even among some of those who miss the
[1:26:54] Rapture he's going to take even in
[1:26:57] Tribulation and save them through
[1:26:59] tribulation now they'll they'll have to
[1:27:02] be saved this side we understand because
[1:27:05] that which is filthy be filthy still and
[1:27:06] holy holy still when it turns to the
[1:27:09] Jews but you know we got to get you to
[1:27:12] believe
[1:27:13] in amen we got to get you to believe in
[1:27:16] it's time for prodal to come
[1:27:20] home amen
[1:27:22] amen we got to get you to believeing
[1:27:24] Sarah we got to get you to confess in
[1:27:27] the
[1:27:28] promise you see his ministry declared he
[1:27:32] is here then Romans 10:13 for whosoever
[1:27:35] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:27:38] shall be saved how then shall they call
[1:27:41] on him in whom they have not believed
[1:27:43] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:27:44] whom they have not heard and how shall
[1:27:46] they hear without a preacher and how
[1:27:48] shall they preach except they be sent as
[1:27:50] it is written how beauti beautiful are
[1:27:52] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:27:54] of peace and bring Good Tidings of good
[1:27:57] things so the prophet's Ministry went
[1:28:00] beyond that of the five-fold ministry
[1:28:03] though he because he was a messenger the
[1:28:07] prophet Messenger to the age to bring
[1:28:10] out the mysteries of the word of God and
[1:28:12] to do this God gave brother brandham a
[1:28:15] special sign gift to demonstrate and to
[1:28:20] prove to us that the word was
[1:28:23] present now I I want you to understand
[1:28:25] the word I'm not talking about theology
[1:28:27] I'm talking about the person Christ who
[1:28:30] is the word but yet brother Brandon said
[1:28:32] I do not deny there would be prophets
[1:28:34] even as in the days of Paul when there
[1:28:36] was one agabus a prophet who prophesied
[1:28:39] of a famine I agree that is so but I
[1:28:41] deny upon the infallible evidence of the
[1:28:43] word that there is more than one major
[1:28:46] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[1:28:48] Mysteries as contained in the word and
[1:28:50] who has a Ministry to turn the hearts of
[1:28:53] the children to the father thus sayith
[1:28:55] the Lord by his unfailing word stands
[1:28:57] and shall stand and be Vindicated there
[1:29:00] is one Prophet Messenger to this
[1:29:03] age there's just not room for
[1:29:07] another amen all one men scriptures have
[1:29:11] been
[1:29:13] fulfilled you know when Jesus came he
[1:29:16] fulfilled many one man scriptures we
[1:29:19] have seen the repeat of the ministry of
[1:29:21] Christ in the day and he again fulfilled
[1:29:24] one man's scriptures but we're not
[1:29:27] living in that day and hour we are now
[1:29:30] past that we are in the point where it
[1:29:32] is now the body
[1:29:34] Ministry even as it followed in the book
[1:29:37] of Acts it changed from the one man
[1:29:39] Ministry Jesus Christ to a multim member
[1:29:43] where he was in his body now you see and
[1:29:46] to brother brandom alone was given the
[1:29:48] sign gift to dis to demonstrate that the
[1:29:52] word was now being revealed through his
[1:29:55] ministry Hebrews 4:12 for the word of
[1:29:58] God is
[1:29:59] alive and powerful and sharper than any
[1:30:02] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:30:04] dividing of the ther of Soul and Spirit
[1:30:07] and of the joints and the marrow and
[1:30:08] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:30:10] the heart and neither is there any
[1:30:13] creature that is not manifest in his
[1:30:15] sight but all things are naked and open
[1:30:17] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[1:30:19] to do so the word discerns
[1:30:23] going into the hidden things of the Soul
[1:30:26] you see it can go back 40 years in a
[1:30:28] person's life or it could go back and
[1:30:31] reveal things Way Beyond that all the
[1:30:34] way to the back part of God's
[1:30:36] mind and bring out Hidden Treasures in
[1:30:39] the
[1:30:40] scripture you see it would even go back
[1:30:43] to John's experience on the AIS of
[1:30:46] patmas and in this day we would we would
[1:30:49] be able to hear the same seven Thunders
[1:30:54] utter their voices and tell us what they
[1:30:58] said because now is the time for them to
[1:31:02] be
[1:31:03] revealed amen what was it declaring to
[1:31:06] us it declared to us the presence of God
[1:31:09] so we would know that God is with
[1:31:12] us and that the promised son Jesus will
[1:31:15] soon come to the
[1:31:17] church amen so in his appearing he does
[1:31:21] not come in the Flesh of Jesus he comes
[1:31:24] in My Flesh and your
[1:31:26] flesh it is his spirit and it is his
[1:31:30] anointing 1 John 2 and 27 says but the
[1:31:33] anointing which you have received of him
[1:31:35] abideth in
[1:31:37] you in Revelation 10 it shows the mighty
[1:31:42] Angel and it's an anointing it's not the
[1:31:44] Corporal
[1:31:46] coming it's not a it's not a thousand
[1:31:49] foot tall um um Christ with a foot on
[1:31:53] the land and sea it's
[1:31:55] symbolic it's representing that Christ
[1:31:58] has come down and putting his H his feet
[1:32:02] on the land and the Sea up from where
[1:32:04] two beasts have risen one out of the
[1:32:06] land one out of the sea and guess what
[1:32:09] and his feet were as pillars of
[1:32:13] fire amen where is there pillars of fire
[1:32:15] in the scripture on the day of
[1:32:18] Pentecost there's a pillar of fire but
[1:32:20] now this is pillars of Fire on the day
[1:32:22] of Pentecost what happened he opened and
[1:32:25] split himself up and 120 were filled
[1:32:28] with the spirit of God each one of them
[1:32:30] getting AB portion and here he comes and
[1:32:32] he puts his feet on the land and on the
[1:32:34] sea and what is he doing he is declaring
[1:32:38] everything is under my feet my body
[1:32:42] which is my bride amen because my feet
[1:32:46] are as pillars of fire they are men and
[1:32:49] women filled with the Holy Ghost with
[1:32:52] the power of God that has dominion over
[1:32:54] the Antichrist Spirit no matter which
[1:32:57] where he raises up out of the land or
[1:32:59] the sea whether America or the Beast
[1:33:03] system it doesn't matter our feet are on

[1:33:30] is don't look up look down he's under
[1:33:32] your
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:39] feet an anointing comes down for the
[1:33:43] purpose of revealing Christ to this age
[1:33:46] open that up for me now in the message
[1:33:50] testimony thank you
[1:33:52] there is a portion brother random said
[1:33:54] there's a portion of word laid for every
[1:33:57] age and there is some anointing comes
[1:34:00] down that projects that portion of the
[1:34:03] word for that
[1:34:05] age now so the son of man the ministry
[1:34:09] of Christ to anoint
[1:34:13] Sons I want to get it to you not one
[1:34:16] son
[1:34:18] Sons now I know too many think this is
[1:34:22] only about the prophet messenger but
[1:34:25] that's not what he
[1:34:27] taught I I I want to I want to get it to
[1:34:29] you that's not what he taught he comes
[1:34:31] to anoint Sons it's a body
[1:34:34] Ministry now in Jehovah Gyra brother
[1:34:37] Bram says now he promised he would
[1:34:39] appear in the last day in the form of
[1:34:42] human flesh again in your
[1:34:48] flesh don't hang up on me I'm preaching
[1:34:51] to you he promised that he would appear
[1:34:55] in the last day in the form of human
[1:34:58] flesh again in your flesh like he did at
[1:35:02] the days of Sodom God which was Christ
[1:35:05] manifest In the Flesh now in his church
[1:35:08] his bride see they're coming together
[1:35:10] it's uniting time churches are uniting
[1:35:12] nations are uniting the Bride In Christ
[1:35:14] is uniting it's uniting time that was
[1:35:17] from Jehovah Gyra in the message trial
[1:35:20] he says it this way way he says Jesus
[1:35:24] Promised as it was in the days of Noah
[1:35:26] as it was in the days of lot it would be
[1:35:28] in the last days we got it it's here
[1:35:31] it's already Vindicated just how many
[1:35:33] scriptures in the Sodom age what
[1:35:35] happened to Abraham who would returned
[1:35:37] back again to Abraham's Royal seed which
[1:35:39] is in Christ Christ returning in the
[1:35:42] form of the word working in human beings
[1:35:47] and showing the signs that he promised
[1:35:50] it would do
[1:35:52] Christ returning in the form of the word
[1:35:57] now that's not a theology that's not a
[1:36:01] Doctrine but the person of the Holy
[1:36:03] Ghost a power that works in human being
[1:36:07] showing signs and wonders that he
[1:36:11] promised it would do in the message that
[1:36:13] called out brother bradam said it this
[1:36:16] way um Abraham called the name of that
[1:36:18] angel that talked to him Lord which is
[1:36:21] Elohim the Great Mighty Jehovah he was
[1:36:25] revealed in the human body he was made
[1:36:27] manifest in the body of his own son
[1:36:30] Jesus and he's made manifest in the body
[1:36:34] of every
[1:36:36] believer who will yield himself to him
[1:36:40] I'll be with you in you to the end of
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:50] world
[1:36:51] my
[1:36:52] goodness that's why he would say in the
[1:36:54] message of trial I challenge you to
[1:36:57] believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in
[1:37:00] the form of son of man in human flesh
[1:37:03] through the bride's
[1:37:07] body you see yes God used the different
[1:37:11] mask down to the
[1:37:13] ages amen but it was the same God all
[1:37:16] the time and yes we can look and see
[1:37:18] what God used brother Brandon and used
[1:37:21] him singularly as a prophet messenger
[1:37:24] and God would use that mask now the
[1:37:27] fullness wasn't in
[1:37:29] him amen because the fullness has been
[1:37:32] in the bride body ever since the day of
[1:37:35] Pentecost amen and here to be manifested
[1:37:37] in fullness in the last day sure enough
[1:37:41] are you with me amen but nevertheless
[1:37:44] God would work through that human being
[1:37:46] but now God is wanting to use your flesh
[1:37:50] on
[1:37:51] God is want to be
[1:38:20] m
[1:38:58] you said down to the age we start out
[1:39:00] the foundation from the first church age
[1:39:03] when the seed went in the ground and the
[1:39:04] complete seed and then come out through
[1:39:07] the feet Luther come back out through
[1:39:09] Wesley then the Pentecost the tongues
[1:39:11] and the lips see and now it's in the
[1:39:12] eyes prophetic Malachi 4 and so on but
[1:39:15] now there's nothing else
[1:39:19] left for it to come but for him himself
[1:39:24] to step into that sir Hallelujah cuz
[1:39:28] that's the last thing oh hallelujah amen
[1:39:31] God condescending God coming down to
[1:39:34] step into a bride in this last day a
[1:39:38] bride body I say tonight use my dust
[1:39:43] God back there in Abraham's day you had
[1:39:45] to you had to take and create and bring
[1:39:48] it together and mold a body but now Lord
[1:39:52] you redeem me and here's my
[1:39:54] dust hallu come use my
[1:40:01] dust convinced and
[1:40:04] concerned now is appearing of the Lord
[1:40:07] is now when he's appearing among his
[1:40:09] people or in his people his Spirit
[1:40:11] working among them proving that it's him
[1:40:14] with them getting them ready for the
[1:40:16] Rapture in time evangelism now is the
[1:40:19] appearing because he said appear and
[1:40:21] come is two different words to appear
[1:40:23] and then to come now is he appearing
[1:40:25] he's already appeared in these last day
[1:40:27] right here with us in these last few
[1:40:29] years now it's a sign of his coming he's
[1:40:32] appearing in his
[1:40:34] church amen in the form of the Holy
[1:40:36] Spirit showing its
[1:40:38] him now here's what he means the
[1:40:41] difference between his appearing and his
[1:40:43] coming what's what he says the appearing
[1:40:46] and the coming is two different things
[1:40:49] the appearing of the Lord is now now
[1:40:52] he's appearing among his people we see
[1:40:54] him in his same works the appearing his
[1:40:57] holy spirit but his coming will be in a
[1:41:00] physical meeting being it will be to
[1:41:03] catch the church
[1:41:05] up for us disappearing of Christ as he
[1:41:10] appears in Bride form this is it it's
[1:41:13] God changing his mask the last thing
[1:41:18] that God does before Jesus return is to
[1:41:23] reveal himself behind the mask of those
[1:41:26] people who are his
[1:41:29] bride now like in mamry God when God
[1:41:32] appeared in flesh Under The Oaks at
[1:41:34] mamry the appearing of God in the last
[1:41:37] day will also be under a
[1:41:40] tree it'll be under the bride
[1:41:44] tree and it will not be a leafless
[1:41:49] tree amen come on it won't be a leafless
[1:41:52] tree but a tree where the holy spirit is
[1:41:56] welcome where Saints run to meet him did
[1:42:00] you do do you know when he appeared he
[1:42:02] ran to meet him he was eager for his
[1:42:06] presence he was watching for his
[1:42:09] appearing we ought to be watching for
[1:42:12] his appearing in this church tonight
[1:42:14] amen because he'll move through this
[1:42:16] building he'll move in your life he'll
[1:42:19] change your life he'll heal your body
[1:42:22] he'll bring Deliverance to you we ought
[1:42:24] to be looking for his appearing of
[1:42:26] people who run to meet him who are
[1:42:29] eager who anticipate him Lord we're
[1:42:33] looking for you to come
[1:42:35] tonight come up in
[1:42:37] me come hear that message through me
[1:42:40] come do this work through me come speak
[1:42:43] through
[1:42:44] me where Saints run to meet him and bow
[1:42:49] down to worship Him
[1:42:53] but to do this we must be a restored
[1:42:55] tree can you imagine trying to to to to
[1:42:59] be be welcome him under a
[1:43:03] snag with no leaves no
[1:43:09] Fellowship come on a a tree that is
[1:43:13] naked of Life void of the spirit where
[1:43:16] the winds can't flow through it and blow
[1:43:19] the leaves and the Holy Spirit move
[1:43:22] among them and they're just dead and dry
[1:43:25] and
[1:43:26] starchy come on that's not welcoming to
[1:43:29] him amen here he had got into a place
[1:43:33] he'd come to the plains of mamory and
[1:43:35] come under the oak tree getting ready
[1:43:38] for the appearing the appearing before
[1:43:41] the coming of the promised son and
[1:43:44] that's what we got to be in this day as
[1:43:46] our oak tree that we come down and we
[1:43:49] sit down under
[1:43:51] a
[1:43:55] shade we must be a a restored tree under
[1:43:59] whose shade Jehovah comes to
[1:44:05] abide in Joel chapter 1 and
[1:44:08] verse4 he tells us what had happened to
[1:44:11] the
[1:44:12] tree he said that which the Palmer worm
[1:44:14] has left the Locust is eaten that which
[1:44:17] the Locust has left the cankerworm is
[1:44:19] eaten that which the cankerworm has left
[1:44:21] the caterpillar is eaten till it become
[1:44:24] a
[1:44:25] snag but that's not the end of the
[1:44:28] tree that is our past condition down
[1:44:32] through the barness of the church age
[1:44:33] but that's not where we are in this day
[1:44:36] I want to read to you the scripture that
[1:44:39] is being alive today and I will restore
[1:44:42] to you Joel 2:25 I will restore to you
[1:44:45] the years that the Locust has eaten the
[1:44:48] cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer

[1:45:03] ashamed Hallelujah so don't get on to me
[1:45:05] for praising
[1:45:07] him come on don't get on to me brother
[1:45:10] for eating and plenty and having plenty
[1:45:13] of word and plenty of Truth things to
[1:45:16] Rejoice about things to shout about
[1:45:18] things to dance about
[1:45:26] Hallelujah for he has made a promise I
[1:45:29] will restore sayth the
[1:45:31] Lord you might want to turn with me to
[1:45:34] Psalms 80 and verse
[1:45:38] 8 brother Rand and preached a sermon on
[1:45:41] this the vine out of Egypt thou H has
[1:45:45] brought a vine out of
[1:45:47] Egypt and thou has cast out the heathen
[1:45:50] and planted it thou preparest room
[1:45:53] before it and did cause it to take deep
[1:45:55] root and it filled the land you see
[1:45:58] Israel was a Vine that could never be
[1:46:01] fruitful until it was promised planted
[1:46:05] back in his Promised Land you know there
[1:46:08] there is trees that must have a certain
[1:46:13] atmosphere you can even take things from
[1:46:15] Louisiana and plant them up here and
[1:46:17] they just want Thrive baby them and
[1:46:20] everything else bring something from
[1:46:21] here and there but they will thrive in
[1:46:24] their
[1:46:26] Homeland amen and you see Israel was
[1:46:29] could never be fruitful unless they were
[1:46:31] planted back in the promised land of
[1:46:34] their inheritance until then it just
[1:46:37] produced The Naughty bitter fruit of
[1:46:42] slavery you see brother Bram tells us in
[1:46:45] Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he said
[1:46:48] God never did deal with Israel to till
[1:46:50] she came to her Homeland hear me thus
[1:46:53] sayeth the Lord God will not deal with
[1:46:55] his church till she comes back to the
[1:46:57] Homeland the message of the Hour come
[1:47:00] back to the original get away from your
[1:47:03] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian your
[1:47:05] Pentecostal Assembly Wess stress
[1:47:07] fineness whatever it is Church of of God
[1:47:09] Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of
[1:47:11] Christ all Antichrist movement I realize
[1:47:13] this strikes the world all wrong all of
[1:47:15] the devil they're Godly men and every
[1:47:16] one of them godly people and every one
[1:47:18] of them movements with the organization
[1:47:20] is s is not of God and God will never
[1:47:22] bless it and he has never done it and
[1:47:24] that's why you could never be a fruitful
[1:47:26] Vine planted out
[1:47:28] there but God took you out of Egypt oh
[1:47:32] Hallelujah and he planted you in the
[1:47:35] message of the hour where you would have
[1:47:37] the atmosphere where that you can
[1:47:40] produce the fruit of the
[1:47:42] word hallelujah a people who brings
[1:47:45] forth his fruit and his
[1:47:49] season
[1:47:51] yes now it's a Baptist Creed that says
[1:47:54] when you re you that you receive the
[1:47:56] Holy Ghost when you believe the message
[1:47:58] that's a Baptist Creed as a false
[1:48:01] Doctrine it's just as it's just as wrong
[1:48:03] as the ausa Creed from Pentecostal Creed
[1:48:07] that says you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] when you shout dance or speak in tongues
[1:48:11] that's incorrect you'll never grow
[1:48:14] Christlike fruit in that soil come back
[1:48:17] to the
[1:48:18] Homeland you see ausa street is not our
[1:48:23] homeland and neither is Baptist or
[1:48:25] Methodist our homeland we are not trying
[1:48:29] I want you to get this as I go along I
[1:48:31] want to this point to be really clear we
[1:48:34] are not trying to reproduce the isua
[1:48:37] Revival nor are we trying to feed the
[1:48:40] bride of Christ
[1:48:43] Pentecostalism yet in saying that many
[1:48:46] are so
[1:48:48] identified are so afraid afaid I mean of
[1:48:50] being identified they're so afraid
[1:48:53] they'll be identified as an isua
[1:48:55] Pentecostal Branch until they have
[1:48:58] become leaning the other way till they
[1:49:00] become a Baptist
[1:49:02] branch which happens to be a several
[1:49:05] Church ages behind even a Pentecostal
[1:49:09] one amen so you see we don't want to be
[1:49:14] a Baptist Branch nor an isusa
[1:49:17] Branch but those because those with that
[1:49:21] fruit is going to be cut off and be
[1:49:23] thrown into the fire of
[1:49:25] tribulation we want to be the genuine
[1:49:28] original Branch as the church was on the
[1:49:32] day of
[1:49:33] Pentecost to receive the blessings in
[1:49:36] the fullness of God for a rapture we
[1:49:39] must be planted in the homeland of the
[1:49:42] open
[1:49:43] book and the fullness of the word that
[1:49:47] came by its opening yes sir now a lot of
[1:49:50] times you know you preach about healing
[1:49:52] and praises and worship and and and
[1:49:54] gifts of the Spirit and all us and PE
[1:49:57] people think my my goodness brother Tim
[1:49:59] what what in the world are you preaching
[1:50:00] that for cuz it's in the
[1:50:03] book and I just happen to believe if
[1:50:05] it's in the book all of it is open to
[1:50:10] me amen the mysteries of God the
[1:50:13] revelation of the seven Thunders you
[1:50:15] know the the those divinely mystery
[1:50:17] revealed truths they're all in the book
[1:50:19] word worship is in the book praise is in
[1:50:21] the book healing is in the book the holy
[1:50:23] spirit is in the book everything and I
[1:50:25] want everything that's in the
[1:50:28] Homeland Hallelujah we can be a fruitful
[1:50:35] Branch you see God never blesses Israel
[1:50:37] till she gets back to her Homeland
[1:50:40] brother Brandon said God will never
[1:50:41] bless you Methodist Baptist Pilgrim
[1:50:43] Holiness Nazarene Church of Christ
[1:50:45] Pentecostal organization never bless you
[1:50:47] this way come back to the Homeland to
[1:50:49] the beginning back to the Pentecostal
[1:50:51] experience like happened on the day of
[1:50:53] Pentecost with the power of the Living
[1:50:55] God changed those thousands of people
[1:50:57] and set their hearts of flame with the
[1:50:59] fire of God that showed genuine not
[1:51:01] impersonated sign not some makeup
[1:51:04] telepathy or not some mockery he wants
[1:51:06] us back to the truth back to the spirit
[1:51:08] back to the right life back to the
[1:51:10] highway in Christ back to truth how can
[1:51:12] he ever bless us the way we go he want
[1:51:14] he never blessed Israel until they came
[1:51:16] back to the promised land and when they
[1:51:18] got back in the Promised Land signs and
[1:51:21] wonders begin to
[1:51:23] happen Hallelujah when you get in the
[1:51:25] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost back in the
[1:51:27] Promise Land of the word what are you
[1:51:29] going to see the signs will begin to
[1:51:31] follow them that
[1:51:35] believe not only were they not blessed
[1:51:38] out of the promised land but the land
[1:51:41] lay
[1:51:42] Barren for years it was just a Barren
[1:51:45] land just a you know a few Arabs going
[1:51:49] around on it you know with their camels
[1:51:50] and so on it was a it was a Barren
[1:51:53] Wasteland and it it was said to the the
[1:51:57] Jewish people when they returned to
[1:51:59] their Homeland after World War II that
[1:52:02] all of a sudden after all of these years
[1:52:05] of baress
[1:52:07] rains began to fall that had been
[1:52:10] withheld from
[1:52:12] years until the land had become Barren
[1:52:16] but when the people of the book returned
[1:52:19] back to the land end of the book The
[1:52:22] Rains Begin to Fall amen and it begin to
[1:52:25] Blossom the desert begin to Blossom as a
[1:52:28] rose and it began to produce his
[1:52:31] fruit now why has the rain been withheld
[1:52:35] if you look with me to deuteron 11 and
[1:52:38] verse 8 therefore say you keep all the
[1:52:42] Commandments all the Commandments which
[1:52:45] I command you this day that you may be
[1:52:47] strong and go and possess the land
[1:52:49] whether you should go to possess it that
[1:52:52] you may prolong your days in the land
[1:52:54] which the Lord swear to your fathers to
[1:52:56] give them unto them and to their their
[1:52:59] seed a land which floweth with milk and
[1:53:02] honey for the land which thou goest into
[1:53:04] possess is not as a land of Egypt from
[1:53:07] which you came out where you sought so
[1:53:09] is thy seed and wat it with thy foot as
[1:53:12] a garden of herbs you see they live by
[1:53:14] the Nile
[1:53:16] there Deuteronomy
[1:53:18] 11:1 so here here again you know it's
[1:53:21] not like the land of Egypt where you you
[1:53:24] you had to work up a
[1:53:26] Revival use your foot the Bible said
[1:53:29] here use your foot they would they would
[1:53:30] use those those um those long poles out
[1:53:33] with their buckets and use their foot
[1:53:35] and spin them around and ditch them put
[1:53:37] them over in in a ditch and and you
[1:53:40] watered it with thy
[1:53:42] foot you see it was with your Works
[1:53:45] working up revivals and working up a
[1:53:47] meeting we're not here to work up a
[1:53:48] meeting
[1:53:50] but the land whether you go to possess
[1:53:52] is a land of Hills and Valleys and
[1:53:55] drinketh water of the rain of Heaven A
[1:53:59] Land which the Lord thy God carth for
[1:54:02] for the eyes of the Lord are thy God are
[1:54:04] always upon it from the beginning of the
[1:54:07] year until the end of the year and it
[1:54:09] shall come to pass if you will
[1:54:10] diligently hearken diligently unto my
[1:54:13] Commandments which I command you this
[1:54:14] day to love the Lord to your God and
[1:54:17] serve him with all your heart with all
[1:54:18] your soul that I will give you rain of
[1:54:21] your land in this due season the first
[1:54:25] rain and the latter rain that they may
[1:54:27] Gather in thy corn and their wine and
[1:54:30] thy oil and I will send grass in thy
[1:54:33] field for thy cattle that th mayest eat
[1:54:35] to be full and be full take heed of
[1:54:38] yourself that your heart not be deceived
[1:54:40] and you turn aside and serve other gods
[1:54:43] and worship them for then the Lord's
[1:54:45] wrath will be kindled against you and he
[1:54:46] will shut up to heaven that there be no
[1:54:48] rain that the land yield not her fruit
[1:54:51] lest you perish quickly from the good
[1:54:53] land which the lord giveth
[1:54:56] you so you see here's why the the land
[1:54:59] the the Reigns was withheld because they
[1:55:01] began to serve other
[1:55:03] gods and then that would take them out
[1:55:05] of their Promised Land then the land
[1:55:06] became Barren but when you come back
[1:55:09] into the land what he said I'm going to
[1:55:12] pour out the rain the former rain and
[1:55:15] the latter rain I'm going to give you
[1:55:17] the teaching rain and the Harvest rain
[1:55:20] Hallelujah and you you will gather in
[1:55:22] your corn and th oil and th and th wine
[1:55:27] you know you're going to be full you
[1:55:29] you're going to be satisfied won't be no
[1:55:31] hungry Among Us won't be no starving
[1:55:35] children as if if they're in some type
[1:55:37] of a a prison
[1:55:39] camp come on this is not a Holocaust in
[1:55:42] a Jewish prison camp we were delivered
[1:55:45] from that we were held out there and the
[1:55:47] starve to death out in those syst
[1:55:49] systems but God with spiritual Wars saw
[1:55:53] that we got out of that and got back to
[1:55:55] our
[1:55:56] homeland God releasing the Holy Spirit
[1:55:59] and here we are and what's he doing he
[1:56:01] is pouring out the former rain and the
[1:56:04] latter rain in its
[1:56:08] season so that we can be a fruitful
[1:56:11] Branch so brother Bram tells us in the
[1:56:15] 70th week of Daniel he said back to the
[1:56:17] message brother back to the original
[1:56:20] back to Pentecost back to the real
[1:56:21] blessing back to the name of Jesus
[1:56:23] Christ back to the baptism of the Holy
[1:56:25] Ghost back to signs and wonders back to
[1:56:28] Pentecost away with the organization
[1:56:31] back to the Holy
[1:56:34] Ghost so look at verse 7 Psalms 80 and
[1:56:37] verse 7 restore
[1:56:39] us God Almighty make your face to shine
[1:56:43] on us that we may be saved you
[1:56:46] transplanted a Vine from Egypt you drove
[1:56:49] out the Nations and planted it you
[1:56:51] cleared the ground fart and took the
[1:56:53] root and filled the land the mountains
[1:56:55] were covered with his shade the mighty
[1:56:56] Cedars with its branches its branches
[1:56:59] reached as far as the sea it shoots as
[1:57:01] far as the river why have you broken
[1:57:03] down its walls so all that pass by pick
[1:57:06] his grapes bores from the that's pigs
[1:57:10] bores from the forest ravage it insects
[1:57:13] from the field the canker worm the
[1:57:15] caterpillar the Palmer worm the Locust
[1:57:17] his feet on it return to us God Almighty
[1:57:20] look down from heaven and see watch over
[1:57:22] this Vine the root of your right hand
[1:57:24] right hand is power has planted the sun
[1:57:28] who you raised up for
[1:57:31] yourself through his power he raised up
[1:57:35] Christ and the root is Christ and he's
[1:57:37] the son that God raised up God planted
[1:57:40] his tree and he is determined to bring
[1:57:43] forth his
[1:57:45] family your Vine is cut down it is
[1:57:47] burned with fire at your rebuke your
[1:57:49] people perish and so like the Israel the
[1:57:52] church was cut down and H the way to
[1:57:55] mystery
[1:57:57] Babylon but that's not the end but I
[1:58:00] will restore sayith the Lord and how is
[1:58:03] he going to do it verse 17 says let your
[1:58:06] hand your power rest on the man at your
[1:58:08] right hand the son of man who you have
[1:58:10] raised up for yourself the son of man
[1:58:13] the Holy Spirit the prophet of the hour
[1:58:16] that anointed the seventh angel to
[1:58:20] prophesy and the same Holy Spirit Upon
[1:58:23] Us makes us prophesy
[1:58:27] again Hallelujah God's power would be
[1:58:30] upon the prophet and the
[1:58:32] church who by the way is a prophetical
[1:58:36] class of
[1:58:38] people
[1:58:40] hallelujah now so you see for this
[1:58:44] restoration is going to take more than a
[1:58:47] Reformation it will take a prophetic
[1:58:50] anointing the son of man Christ would
[1:58:53] manifest himself as prophetic anointing
[1:58:57] a particular
[1:58:59] anointing notice here brother bradam
[1:59:02] said it this way we're expecting that
[1:59:04] great anointing upon the church that
[1:59:07] will turn the hearts back to the
[1:59:08] original doctrine of the fathers back to
[1:59:10] the real genuine
[1:59:12] Pentecost again he says because we find
[1:59:15] in the scripture in Malachi 4 that there
[1:59:17] is to be an anointing come down and
[1:59:18] Resto again that original faith and
[1:59:20] bring the faith of the people back to
[1:59:22] the original Pentecost the faith of the
[1:59:25] fathers again he says to restore what
[1:59:27] the faith of the people back to the
[1:59:29] original fathers the Pentecostal
[1:59:31] Doctrine the original fathers and he
[1:59:33] will restore the people back to the
[1:59:35] fathers so that
[1:59:37] anointing of Christ would be called the
[1:59:41] spirit of
[1:59:43] Elijah you see that the spirit of Elijah
[1:59:47] was was we don't believe in
[1:59:49] reincarnation so it wasn't that he got
[1:59:52] Elijah's Spirit his human Spirit but the
[1:59:56] anointing that was saw upon him which
[1:59:58] was Christ Came Upon
[2:00:00] elishah then we would see it upon John
[2:00:03] then we would see it on Malachi 4 in
[2:00:04] this last day then it'll come to the
[2:00:06] Jews over in the
[2:00:08] tribulation so you see the spirit of
[2:00:11] Elijah is not The Reincarnation of a man
[2:00:15] nor his Spirit but it is the spirit of
[2:00:18] the Lord that is identified with Elijah
[2:00:22] as he turns the hearts of Israel back to
[2:00:25] the faith in Jehovah again so this
[2:00:28] Elijah would have a job of
[2:00:33] restoration like the original Elijah the
[2:00:36] Elijah in this day has to be a Ministry
[2:00:39] of
[2:00:40] restoration now in First Kings 18 and
[2:00:44] verse 30 we find The Showdown First
[2:00:48] Kings 1830 30 and Elijah said unto all
[2:00:51] the people come near to me and all the
[2:00:54] people came near to him and he repaired
[2:00:57] the altar of the Lord that was broken
[2:01:00] down notice what he does he repairs the
[2:01:04] altar of the Lord that was broken down
[2:01:06] and Elijah took 12 Stones according to
[2:01:09] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[2:01:10] Jacob upon whom the word of the Lord
[2:01:12] came saying Israel shall be thy name and
[2:01:15] with the stones he built an altar in the
[2:01:17] name of the Lord and He made a trench
[2:01:19] around of the altar as great as was
[2:01:22] contained two measures of seed so I want
[2:01:24] you to notice here first he repairs the
[2:01:28] altar he does not build a new
[2:01:33] altar he doesn't bring a new
[2:01:38] doctrine the message we have received is
[2:01:42] not something
[2:01:45] new it is not something different from
[2:01:48] the Bible
[2:01:52] amen come on it is the doctrine of the
[2:01:56] Apostles and Prophets The Message we
[2:01:59] have it is what Paul
[2:02:03] preached Even Heaven testified that when
[2:02:05] brother Brandon wouldn't be on the
[2:02:06] curtain of time he said I preached this
[2:02:08] what Paul preached and they said we know
[2:02:10] that and we're resting on that heaven
[2:02:14] rest on the fact that he preached what
[2:02:18] Paul preached
[2:02:22] now this is very important because what
[2:02:24] we have is not a new
[2:02:27] doctrine is not a new message it is a
[2:02:35] restoration now I know that makes maybe
[2:02:38] some of you question a little bit that's
[2:02:39] okay you just hang on a minute we'll get
[2:02:42] there I'm old and I'm
[2:02:44] slow but the
[2:02:46] message we have received is not not
[2:02:49] something
[2:02:50] new it is the doctrine of the Apostles
[2:02:54] and Prophets this what Paul preached
[2:02:55] listen brother brandham did not have to
[2:02:58] go and write a new Bible he didn't have
[2:03:00] to do like the Jehovah's Witness and
[2:03:03] even write an interpretation reinterpret
[2:03:07] it he didn't have to go and add an
[2:03:10] addition Book of
[2:03:13] Mormons you see you know he he actually
[2:03:17] restored what what Paul
[2:03:21] preached what we have today is the
[2:03:24] original
[2:03:27] gospel amen you brother Tim we got more
[2:03:30] than what old Paul preached no we
[2:03:34] don't this is a
[2:03:36] restoration back to the faith of the
[2:03:39] fathers we do not have a gospel
[2:03:42] different from Paul you know that would
[2:03:44] Place us under a
[2:03:45] curse do you see Galatians 1:8 the we
[2:03:48] are an angel from heaven preach any
[2:03:50] other gospel unto you than what we have
[2:03:52] preached unto you let him be a
[2:03:55] cursed so if we are preaching something
[2:03:57] different from what Paul
[2:03:59] preached we're under a curse as we have
[2:04:03] said before so say I again if any man
[2:04:06] preach any other gospel unto you than
[2:04:09] what ye have received let him be a
[2:04:12] cursed there can be no
[2:04:16] additions
[2:04:17] nor
[2:04:19] subtractions to this
[2:04:25] Bible Revelation 2218 I testify to to
[2:04:29] every man that heareth the words of this
[2:04:31] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[2:04:33] add unto these things God shall add unto
[2:04:36] him the plagues that are written in this
[2:04:38] book and if any man shall take away from
[2:04:40] the words of the book of this prophecy
[2:04:42] God shall take away his part out of the
[2:04:44] book of life and out of the holy city
[2:04:46] and from the things that are written in
[2:04:47] this book now yes granted there were
[2:04:51] symbols in the Book of
[2:04:54] Revelation and yes it wasn't
[2:04:57] understood until this
[2:05:02] day as to what those symbols were so we
[2:05:06] do understand things that Paul
[2:05:11] didn't you know when Paul preached and
[2:05:13] he said we which are alive and
[2:05:17] remain yeah he believed he
[2:05:20] was the one going to be
[2:05:23] raptured it wasn't revealed to
[2:05:26] him that would be 2,000 years of Gentile
[2:05:29] Church ages and God even Waits until uh
[2:05:33] until he is gone to break Revelation to
[2:05:36] to John and show him there's Seven
[2:05:40] Cities and there's seven stars and you
[2:05:42] know and and and there's all of these
[2:05:44] and he shows it all in symbols but it's
[2:05:46] not
[2:05:47] explained and it's your guess as good as
[2:05:50] mine until a prophet
[2:05:54] comes amen it's all written in symbols
[2:05:58] and nobody knows what it means it's kind
[2:06:00] of like in the days of Daniel it's
[2:06:02] handwritings on the wall many many tles
[2:06:04] you far come over here Baptist tell me
[2:06:07] what that mean I don't know it's a
[2:06:09] sealed well what does this mean
[2:06:11] Presbyterian well I think um you know
[2:06:17] uh
[2:06:19] Matthew Henry what do you think
[2:06:22] well this is my
[2:06:28] guess you know sus apocalypse what do
[2:06:31] you think well this is my
[2:06:33] guess everybody's probing everybody's
[2:06:36] trying to understand everybody's trying
[2:06:38] but nobody knows until the prophet comes
[2:06:41] on the scene and when the prophet comes
[2:06:43] on the scene then that which was symble
[2:06:45] becomes a known
[2:06:47] truth that's right come on thou are
[2:06:51] weighed in the balance and found wanting
[2:06:53] right so that which was in symbol become
[2:06:56] known by a prophet God had wrote it but
[2:07:00] wrote it in symbols it was speaking in
[2:07:02] tongues to everybody else that's what
[2:07:03] the Book of Revelation is to so many is
[2:07:06] still speaking in tongues it's a sealed
[2:07:08] book but it ain't sealed to
[2:07:10] you because it's given to you to know
[2:07:13] the mysteries of the Kingdom that's why
[2:07:15] God would sent a prophet in this last
[2:07:17] day to make known to you the
[2:07:20] truth so you can see your day your hour
[2:07:23] your moment of
[2:07:27] visitation so in that day Paul did not
[2:07:30] need to know God would hide it from them
[2:07:32] that there would be seven Gentile Church
[2:07:35] ages they didn't need to know that Satan
[2:07:39] would have done a lot of damage with it
[2:07:41] if they would have known it's going to
[2:07:42] be 2,000 year well there's no her to get
[2:07:44] the gospel
[2:07:46] out we got a long time
[2:07:49] we can just slop along but every
[2:07:51] generation went down looking for the
[2:07:53] coming of the Lord in their
[2:07:56] day God did that on
[2:07:59] purpose amen e even now he's he's hid
[2:08:02] from us even hid from us the very day
[2:08:04] and the and the hour and the moment he
[2:08:06] will
[2:08:09] return oh everybody comes up with well
[2:08:11] he's coming this year or he's coming
[2:08:13] that year or I tell you I know when the
[2:08:15] moon comes here and the blood moon does
[2:08:17] it I come on how many gimmicks have we
[2:08:19] seen down to

[2:08:27] you'll see I said yeah I will
[2:08:30] see and when the day comes passes well I
[2:08:34] saw just like I
[2:08:37] thought amen God keeps that part a
[2:08:41] mystery you know why because he wants
[2:08:43] you looking for the coming of the Lord
[2:08:47] today well what if he' have told you in
[2:08:49] the year 2000 it' be 2024 sometime that
[2:08:52] he would come you'd have slopped
[2:08:55] along but look at the Glorious life that
[2:08:58] you've had as a Christian walking with
[2:09:01] him these 24
[2:09:04] years amen so that's the way that God
[2:09:07] did it he hid it from
[2:09:09] them but you see it comes a time for us
[2:09:12] to know when he is here to do specific
[2:09:17] things
[2:09:19] it's like I explain it like this
[2:09:21] sometimes you know I was going on a trip
[2:09:22] sometime ago and and and uh you know
[2:09:25] this is the day before
[2:09:26] GPS and they uh we we were going to
[2:09:31] Florida I was going to preach a memorial
[2:09:33] service for a brother in my church his
[2:09:36] father had passed and so i' went to
[2:09:38] going to Florida and as I got in the car
[2:09:41] I said uh wait wait wait wait just a
[2:09:43] minute uh I forgot my map he said you
[2:09:47] don't need a map I know that way like
[2:09:48] the back of my hand I've been there so
[2:09:50] many times I said you don't need a map
[2:09:53] but I need a
[2:09:54] map so I'm going to get my map so we're
[2:09:56] going to wait just another minute cuz I
[2:09:58] got to have a map cuz I don't know where
[2:10:01] I'm going and I need a map to tell me so

[2:10:23] stop I get up and look
[2:10:26] around where are we I don't know the
[2:10:29] road just

[2:10:41] me something I tell you what look on
[2:10:43] that map and tell me where we
[2:10:45] are I said it don't work that way
[2:10:49] I said this map is useless to me cuz I
[2:10:53] don't know where I'm at unless I know
[2:10:55] where I'm at on this map I can't tell
[2:10:57] you so you got lost buddy so you see
[2:11:01] that that store over there walk in that
[2:11:04] store and I want you to ask him this
[2:11:06] question where am
[2:11:10] I and when you find out where you are
[2:11:14] I'll look here on the map and I will
[2:11:17] find it and I can find out how to get
[2:11:20] from here you see that was where we were
[2:11:23] we didn't know what church AG we were in
[2:11:25] we didn't know there were church ches we
[2:11:28] didn't know even how to read the map but
[2:11:30] God sent a prophet in this day and put
[2:11:33] his finger on the map and said here you
[2:11:35] are in the Leo C this is the hour of his
[2:11:39] appearing that is Among Us
[2:11:43] now so now we can take the road map and
[2:11:47] go toward the future home home and the
[2:11:49] Rapture every promise of God can't we
[2:11:53] amen why because God sent a prophet in
[2:11:55] this day and hour amen who could tell us
[2:11:58] where we were in the
[2:12:03] book so now you see there were symbols
[2:12:06] but they wouldn't
[2:12:07] understood until this day what the
[2:12:09] symbols were like the mystery of the
[2:12:12] Seven Stars the meaning of the Seven
[2:12:14] Cities the seven golden candlesticks
[2:12:18] Paul didn't know there would be seven
[2:12:19] Church ages he fully expected the Lord
[2:12:22] to come in his age saying we which are
[2:12:24] alive and remain there's a mystery of
[2:12:26] the seven Thunders which are the
[2:12:28] Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals
[2:12:30] when they were opened and it revealed
[2:12:32] the symbols of each seal but this did
[2:12:35] not give us new
[2:12:38] doctrines we did not receive a different
[2:12:41] gospel this unsealed the
[2:12:44] book and restored back to us the land
[2:12:48] the
[2:12:49] Paul amen William brandham he brother
[2:12:52] brandham taught water baptism as Paul
[2:12:55] taught it the Holy Ghost is an
[2:12:57] experience like Paul believed it amen
[2:12:59] Paul come to Ephesus found believers who
[2:13:02] who had believed and asked if they had
[2:13:04] experienced the Holy Ghost since they
[2:13:05] believe he he ex insisted you must have
[2:13:09] an experience after
[2:13:11] beli amen Paul said that men would be
[2:13:14] judged by his
[2:13:16] gospel he said there his gospel was a
[2:13:19] revelation of the mystery that had been
[2:13:21] hid from the foundation of the world and
[2:13:23] were revealed by his gospel you find
[2:13:26] this in Romans 16 Romans 15 and 19
[2:13:29] through many signs and wonders through
[2:13:31] Mighty signs and wonders by the power of
[2:13:33] the spirit so from Jerusalem and round
[2:13:35] about the Lum I have fully preached the
[2:13:38] gospel of
[2:13:39] Christ and here we come in the last day
[2:13:42] and the gospel must now go into all the
[2:13:46] world because it must be
[2:13:50] finished notice the gospel must be
[2:13:53] preached into all the world then the end
[2:13:55] can come using every means
[2:13:59] possible lot of people criticize the
[2:14:01] internet and criticize our use of it and
[2:14:04] whatever we got to do it by every means
[2:14:09] possible amen we have we the Bible said
[2:14:12] in Matthew 24 verse4 the gospel of the
[2:14:16] Kingdom shall be preached un all the
[2:14:19] world for a witness unto all nations and
[2:14:21] then shall the End
[2:14:23] come do you know brother brandom told us
[2:14:25] an invisible Union of the Bride he said
[2:14:28] denominations cannot fulfill the Great
[2:14:31] Commission he said they cannot receive
[2:14:33] the open and of the Seven
[2:14:35] Seals and because of that he said they
[2:14:37] can't receive the whole word so that how
[2:14:40] could they fulfill the Great Commission
[2:14:42] do you realize then it lays on our
[2:14:44] shoulders to fulfill the Great
[2:14:47] Commission go into all the world and
[2:14:49] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[2:14:52] follow them that believe they will lay
[2:14:54] hands on the sick and they shall
[2:14:56] recover come on we have the gospel now
[2:15:00] there's a gospel preached according to
[2:15:01] the Baptist according to Methodist
[2:15:03] according to Pentecost but the gospel of
[2:15:05] the kingdom whose Mysteries Paul
[2:15:08] revealed must be preached in all the
[2:15:10] world for a witness and then shall the
[2:15:13] End
[2:15:14] come and we must use every means we have
[2:15:17] to do it
[2:15:18] and the only ones that can do it are
[2:15:21] those with an open
[2:15:23] book it's no longer
[2:15:26] sealed well all of them are open but one
[2:15:29] well then your book is still sealed
[2:15:31] that's right come on you don't want you
[2:15:34] you cannot know his
[2:15:35] Mysteries you see you see but I go back
[2:15:39] at Elijah Elijah did not add new
[2:15:43] Stones he laid the original Stones back
[2:15:47] in in their
[2:15:49] place amen so you see like here's some
[2:15:52] Snippets of what Elijah is going to do
[2:15:54] that's little excerpts what I just took
[2:15:56] from the message it's going to go back
[2:15:57] to its original again back to the real
[2:16:00] Holy Ghost back to the gospel message

[2:16:18] message to the people with the signs of
[2:16:20] the Messiah he will send and that Elijah
[2:16:23] will shake the people right straight

[2:16:53] original Faith again back to the faith

[2:18:06] of the Lord and that not be where he
[2:18:08] took
[2:18:09] us come on
[2:18:11] that's well the world's falling
[2:18:16] apart amen
[2:18:18] mic number
[2:18:26] two
[2:18:31] Hallelujah all
[2:18:33] right coming right down to it this is
[2:18:36] the day of restoration church look where
[2:18:39] we're at at this time look look at the
[2:18:42] hour we're in look what God is promising
[2:18:45] to do in this last day
[2:18:48] you know there some things that brother
[2:18:49] brandham wanted to impart to us before
[2:18:52] he left and I've told this many times
[2:18:54] but I read a book called Killing Lincoln
[2:18:56] by
[2:18:57] O'Reilly and it would you know in there
[2:19:00] he told about you know Lincoln on this
[2:19:03] certain day he went this certain place
[2:19:05] and the man who had so many days to live
[2:19:07] did this and that and this man went had
[2:19:10] so many days went to Gettysburg and on
[2:19:11] and on you know and finally comes down
[2:19:13] to his death and so he he traces out all
[2:19:17] the last days of
[2:19:20] Lincoln and I thought about that and I
[2:19:22] said you know
[2:19:23] God you spoke in this
[2:19:26] generation to the leoan age and you sent
[2:19:30] the leoan
[2:19:33] messenger and it was the message of
[2:19:35] Jesus Christ to the last
[2:19:39] age and you were imparting some things
[2:19:42] and some of there there's some of the
[2:19:44] last things that would be imparted to us
[2:19:49] as the bride
[2:19:51] body and I I just want to get this for a
[2:19:53] moment in in August just before he will
[2:19:56] go in November he preaches the God of
[2:19:58] this evil age the man who had only a few
[2:20:02] more sermons to
[2:20:04] preach the the message that only only
[2:20:07] where Jesus Christ would be speaking
[2:20:10] through a messenger to the last AG the
[2:20:12] last words here now is being imparted
[2:20:16] and he says when Eve
[2:20:18] had the very feeling of God's word in
[2:20:19] her hand she could have took God's word
[2:20:22] but what did she do instead of tearing
[2:20:24] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let
[2:20:26] science prove to her that the Holy Ghost
[2:20:28] was only for the disciples instead of
[2:20:30] keeping Divine Healing going when she op
[2:20:33] to be now raising the dead and doing
[2:20:35] great Miracles she has let Satan under
[2:20:38] his leadership of religious men take the
[2:20:40] word of God and try to say it was for
[2:20:42] another age and she believed it when
[2:20:45] Jesus said the things that I do shall
[2:20:47] you do also Jesus said that go into all
[2:20:49] the world and preach the gospel to every
[2:20:51] creature and we're still creatures these
[2:20:53] signs have follow every one of them that
[2:20:55] believe and she denies everybody she's
[2:20:58] denies all the Supernatural and swapped
[2:21:00] it for an intellectual conception of the
[2:21:04] Bible think of that here God trying to
[2:21:07] impart what we ought to be
[2:21:11] doing are you with me amen for why he is
[2:21:15] to appear in pred
[2:21:18] body amen there has to be a change start
[2:21:22] taking place where Sarah realizes I'm
[2:21:27] pregnant and A change is taking place
[2:21:31] and the change doesn't start out here it
[2:21:33] starts on the inside From the Inside
[2:21:37] Out hallelujah oh my brother Ram said
[2:21:41] again in things that are to be what we
[2:21:43] should
[2:21:44] expect things that are to be what is
[2:21:48] going to be and I believe the same thing
[2:21:50] we live today God bearing record of his
[2:21:52] word by vindicating what he said he
[2:21:54] would do and we know this is the day of
[2:21:56] salvation where God is calling men from
[2:21:58] the world from a life of sin to a life
[2:22:00] of service and in the day that God has
[2:22:02] poured out his Spirit from on high great
[2:22:05] signs and wonders are to accompany the
[2:22:07] ministry of this day this is when the
[2:22:10] former and latter rain are falling
[2:22:12] together and we know there's supposed to
[2:22:14] be great signs and wonders which in many
[2:22:17] denomination this is turned down let's
[2:22:19] not be those that turn it
[2:22:22] down amen I we ought to say God Send the
[2:22:26] Rain send the holy spirit amen saturated
[2:22:29] you see because the bride must bear
[2:22:32] forth the fruit of the
[2:22:34] word you know what's going to happen if
[2:22:36] he's appears in this day and the bride
[2:22:38] tree has no fruit what did he do to the
[2:22:41] vict tree when he passed it by and there
[2:22:43] was no fruit in it he cursed it and
[2:22:46] anything that does not have fruit in
[2:22:48] this day and hour will be cursed and go
[2:22:50] into the tribulation for the
[2:22:57] purging so here we are even down to the
[2:23:01] last recorded sermon of brother brandom
[2:23:03] you know the hour will soon arise when
[2:23:05] right Among Us the holy spirit will
[2:23:07] speak out like it did in ananas sa fire
[2:23:09] remember the hour is arriving now you
[2:23:12] just remember that God is going to dwell
[2:23:15] among his people that's what he wants to
[2:23:18] do
[2:23:20] now so all this way from the beginning
[2:23:23] to the end he would declare you know
[2:23:26] this it's like Elijah he put the wood in
[2:23:28] order the wood of the word has been
[2:23:31] correctly placed it's cut the bulock in
[2:23:34] place in in pieces and set it in order
[2:23:37] the sacrifice the atonement his work as

[2:23:43] placed come on don't try to move the
[2:23:46] lamb off the mercy Mercy Mercy no we
[2:23:49] still need
[2:23:51] Mercy Hallelujah I'm glad to know
[2:23:54] there's Mercy tonight but that's because
[2:23:57] there is a sacrifice on the altar that
[2:24:00] Elijah repaired he put the he put the
[2:24:03] intercessor back in place again not a
[2:24:07] man interceding between you and God but
[2:24:09] God himself Christ the intercessor amen
[2:24:13] who you can approach to the high priest
[2:24:16] that can be touched by the feeling of
[2:24:18] your
[2:24:19] infirmities blessed be the name of the
[2:24:22] Lord amen laid on the wood and said go
[2:24:25] ahead let's let's fix it where there's
[2:24:27] no
[2:24:28] impersonations pour four barrels of
[2:24:31] water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice
[2:24:33] in the wood do it second time do it a
[2:24:35] third time do it a fourth time there was
[2:24:37] a barrel of water for every tribe of

[2:24:42] every Church
[2:24:43] Age come on church amen the water ran
[2:24:46] the about the Altar and he filled the
[2:24:48] trench and it came to pass at the
[2:24:49] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[2:24:51] Elijah the prophet came near and said
[2:24:53] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let
[2:24:56] it be known that thou art God in Israel
[2:24:59] and that I am thy servant and that I've
[2:25:01] done all this according to Thy word I've
[2:25:03] done it by Vision that same angel that
[2:25:06] discerned the heart that restored Health
[2:25:07] to the sick that restored hearing to the
[2:25:09] deaf well right here in Little Rock
[2:25:11] Arkansas brother Bram goes to the school
[2:25:13] of the death I was by there here a while
[2:25:15] back and went by the the the school of

[2:25:30] sight to the blind the same Angel
[2:25:34] Hallelujah the same Angel showed him
[2:25:37] where to find the neglected stones of
[2:25:41] baptism in Jesus name the true Oneness
[2:25:44] of God the original sin pred destination
[2:25:47] the security of the believer and all
[2:25:49] these Mr truths and put them in the
[2:25:52] order and he said hear me oh God hear me
[2:25:55] that this people might know that thou
[2:25:57] art the Lord God and that thou has
[2:25:58] turned their hearts back again and then
[2:26:01] the fire of God
[2:26:03] fell I tell you what church that's what
[2:26:06] we need for every person the fire to
[2:26:09] fall upon them consume your sacrifice
[2:26:11] consume your own life lick up the water
[2:26:13] that's in the
[2:26:14] trench amen
[2:26:17] and when the people saw this they fell
[2:26:19] on their faces said the Lord he is God
[2:26:22] the Lord he is the
[2:26:24] God Amen this is why Malachi 4 says when
[2:26:28] the spirit that was upon Elijah comes in
[2:26:30] the last day it'll turn the hearts of
[2:26:33] the children back to the faith of the
[2:26:37] fathers so that's what's promised but we
[2:26:40] cannot welcome him
[2:26:44] under an old snag
[2:26:49] come

[2:26:53] enough heat for crying out
[2:26:56] loud amen they you know the Heat's
[2:26:59] turned up in the world it's a hot day

[2:27:18] leaves of
[2:27:20] Fellowship he restores the joy of the
[2:27:24] spirit amen where the where the trees
