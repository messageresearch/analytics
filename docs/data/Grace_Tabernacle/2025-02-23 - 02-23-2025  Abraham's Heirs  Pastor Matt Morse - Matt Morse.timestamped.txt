[44:34] the 27th verse read the last three
[44:38] verses of the chapter give you just a
[44:40] moment to turn there Galatians 3 and
[44:47] 27 amen when you get there just say
[44:51] amen and Galatians
[44:54] 3:27 Bible says for as many of you has
[44:57] have been baptized into Christ have put
[45:00] on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[45:03] there is neither Bond nor free there is
[45:05] neither male nor female for you are all
[45:08] one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ
[45:11] then you are Abraham's seed and your HS
[45:14] according to the promise we'll just ask
[45:17] the Lord to add His blessings to the
[45:18] reading of the word as you take your
[45:19] seat this morning I want to speak uh
[45:22] today on Abraham's heirs on Abraham's
[45:25] heirs uh I know many of you have been uh
[45:28] here over the past few weeks and we've
[45:30] been uh speaking on this series out of
[45:33] Galatians the 3 chapter and uh and I
[45:36] trust it's been a blessing to you
[45:38] there's so much Revelation that just
[45:39] lays in this uh scripture and uh but the
[45:42] Lord has just really put this on my
[45:44] heart this morning and uh I want to take
[45:47] just a moment as we're speaking on this
[45:49] subject uh just to kind of I know
[45:51] there's some new people that maybe
[45:52] wasn't here the first service we took uh
[45:55] out at the beginning of the chapter we
[45:56] spoke on the seed of Faith how many's
[45:58] read through Galatians 3 over maybe some
[46:00] of y'all did this morning I asked the
[46:01] brothers to put it on the board and uh
[46:03] but it's been uh there's such a a
[46:05] revelation of of of the church and in
[46:08] our in our future that lays in this in
[46:11] this uh promise and uh but but we
[46:13] started this series in the in on the
[46:16] seed of faith and showed how that we
[46:17] were not uh just the children with uh
[46:20] promise but we were the children of
[46:22] promise and uh so we showed how that
[46:25] there was great things about being a
[46:27] Christian and and uh one of the great
[46:29] things that there was was that it didn't
[46:31] matter what we ever face there's always
[46:33] a Bible promise concerning what we face
[46:35] so uh if we Face bondage there's a
[46:37] promise concerning Deliverance if you if
[46:39] you face a sickness there's a promise of
[46:42] healing if you're lost there's a promise
[46:44] of Salvation so uh these are the
[46:46] promises of God that pertain to the
[46:48] believer but we realize that this
[46:50] morning that not only do we receive the
[46:52] promises of God but we are a promise of
[46:55] God somebody say that I am a promise so
[46:57] not only do we receive promises but we
[46:59] are a promised see for all through the
[47:02] scripture God has promised that there
[47:04] was coming a people or there would come
[47:06] a seed of God all through the Old
[47:08] Testament we saw this as it would come
[47:10] to place in the man Jesus and how that
[47:12] here he was the promised seat of God and
[47:14] brother Wesley he was born he was
[47:16] sacrificed he was buried he was raised
[47:19] uh raised from the dead he ascended upon
[47:21] high but whenever he ascended it did not
[47:24] end the seed line of God but the Bible
[47:26] says but then he poured his Spirit back
[47:28] upon the church I know there's many
[47:30] today that are still searching for that
[47:32] seed they're looking they're uh in
[47:34] Israel they're always searching history
[47:36] they're looking for the seed line of
[47:37] Abraham and trying uh to to to tie the
[47:39] lineage and find out their connection
[47:41] but uh but do you realize today that
[47:43] although the history of the lineages it
[47:45] may have been lost it remember when the
[47:47] temple was destroyed and all the all the
[47:49] books were destroyed and and they can't
[47:51] trace it any longer but brother Mark
[47:53] that seed line was not ever to carry on
[47:56] through is Israel it was to carry
[47:58] through that seed which was called Jesus
[48:00] and it didn't end with Jesus I I think
[48:02] that's wonderful because the Bible says
[48:04] this it said for whom he fornew he
[48:06] predestinated to be conformed to the
[48:08] image of the son that he might be what
[48:11] the firstborn among many Brethren that
[48:14] means Jesus who was Abraham's seed he
[48:16] was the firstborn of many there was many
[48:19] to come after him there was many of the
[48:21] Seed of Abraham that would come after
[48:22] this man Jesus so we realize that the
[48:25] seed of faith has carried on through
[48:27] this day and even today that that seed
[48:29] is still alive when you look around this
[48:31] building this morning that very seed
[48:33] that was prophesied in the Book of
[48:35] Genesis you see them sitting here this
[48:36] is what God was speaking of when he
[48:38] talked to Abraham this very group of
[48:40] people this very body of Believers of
[48:43] around the world today brother Mark
[48:44] where everyone AP part of that seed that
[48:46] God was speaking of to Abraham so but
[48:48] the Bible said that this seed is still
[48:50] alive it carried into this day and that
[48:52] very seed is what brings the word seed
[48:55] to life in you that very that very Faith
[48:57] Seed of Abraham is what brings the seed
[48:59] of the word of God to life and you it's
[49:01] what causes you to be a believer that's
[49:03] what makes you come here on a Sunday
[49:05] morning and fellowship around the word
[49:06] of God that's what caused you to leave
[49:08] all the other things and and come and
[49:10] find a place in God's word that you can
[49:12] be identified in the word of God the
[49:15] next service we went and spoke on being
[49:17] redeemed from The Curse Of God remember
[49:19] how the Bible says that Christ has
[49:21] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[49:23] every redeemed means to regain
[49:25] possession that means we were lost we
[49:27] had to be redeemed we had to be bought
[49:30] back we were under a curse and and
[49:31] friends you know that we were every one
[49:33] of us were bound I I don't know about
[49:35] you but I know I remember what it was
[49:36] like to be bound but though I was bound
[49:39] Christ came and he set me free see I was
[49:42] redeemed from the curse though I was
[49:45] bound yet Christ came and he set me free
[49:47] there's a reason that Redemption means
[49:50] so much to the believer it's because we
[49:52] recognize the power that the curse had
[49:54] on us so it means something to be
[49:56] redeemed why mind what good would it do
[49:59] to say you're free you're free you're
[50:01] free if you didn't know you were bound
[50:03] what good would it do to say you're well
[50:05] you're well you're well if you didn't
[50:07] know what sickness was what what good
[50:08] would it do to say you're saved you're
[50:10] saved you're saved if you didn't know
[50:12] you were lost but you realize the only
[50:14] way to see the value in Redemption would
[50:16] be able to know how bad the curse was
[50:19] and because we know that curse had a
[50:21] hold on us and because we know we were
[50:23] bound to this world and we were bound to
[50:25] flesh and we were held down by that old
[50:27] curse called death but brother wesy
[50:30] because we know the curse then we value
[50:32] the Redemption that came by the blood of
[50:35] Jesus Christ that called me out of sin
[50:37] and out of the Flesh and out of the
[50:39] curse of death and he set my feet on a
[50:41] rock to stay I I'll tell you what
[50:43] because we know the curse that's why we
[50:45] rejoice in Redemption because I know how
[50:48] bad it was brother Mar when I deserve
[50:50] death but I rejoice in life I deserve
[50:53] hell but I rejoice in Heavenly places I
[50:55] know what it's like to be sick so
[50:57] therefore I worship god oh our friends I
[51:00] tell you this morning I can Rejoice
[51:02] because there's a breath in my body cuz
[51:04] God allowed me to come this morning and
[51:06] be able to stand before this lovely
[51:08] congregation there's breath in my body
[51:10] therefore I rejoice in my God I wonder
[51:13] how many come to the Tabernacle this
[51:14] morning say brother mat here in this
[51:16] place of communion in this place of
[51:18] Fellowship I lift my hands and I rejoice
[51:21] in my God I lift my voice and I rejoice
[51:24] in my God for the Bible says let
[51:26] everything thing that has a breath
[51:28] praise ye the Lord therefore I praise
[51:30] him I know what it's like to be sick so
[51:33] I rejoice and being well I know what
[51:35] it's like to be lost so I rejoice in
[51:37] being saved I know what it's like to be
[51:39] bound so I rejoice in my freedom this
[51:43] morning we've been set free brother Joe
[51:46] it wasn't by an accident it wasn't
[51:48] because we were lucky it wasn't by
[51:50] chance but it happened because we had a
[51:52] mediator come by the great hand of our
[51:55] mediator brother Mark our goal between
[51:58] you realize Israel had Moses but we had
[52:00] the man Jesus Christ he was our mediator
[52:03] and because we have him he set a he set
[52:05] apart this people to this day to be able
[52:08] to receive the promises of God the last
[52:11] service we spoke on being Faith children
[52:13] and how that we were children of Abraham
[52:15] through faith in Christ Jesus now I want
[52:18] to take this direction this morning here
[52:20] me y'all feel like preaching praise the
[52:21] Lord here Paul showed how the Covenant
[52:24] with Abraham notice wasn't based on on
[52:26] works but he proved by showing he proved
[52:29] that it wasn't based on works by showing
[52:32] that Abraham was called righteous before
[52:34] he ever performed a single act of
[52:36] obedience can I go here this morning you
[52:39] realize that here this Covenant was
[52:41] called an unconditional coven now I know
[52:43] I know there's many uh arguments about
[52:45] that in in the in the theologians but
[52:47] but you realize that that that because
[52:49] when you read it when you read about the
[52:51] Covenant the Bible actually shows that
[52:53] there were conditions of it how many
[52:54] knows that in Genesis 17 the Bible say
[52:56] this is my Covenant which you shall keep
[52:58] between me and you and thy seed after
[52:59] thee every man child among you shall be
[53:02] circumcised see you say well is that a
[53:04] condition well well it's a condition but
[53:06] let me show you this but re the reason
[53:08] it was called unconditional this is what
[53:11] this is the Revelation that Paul is
[53:13] bringing to the Gentiles it's an
[53:14] unconditional Covenant here they they
[53:17] they had been so Bound by law and so
[53:19] Bound by the dos and don'ts following
[53:21] after the the law that brother Mark they
[53:23] couldn't even hardly see something that
[53:25] could could be unconditional but Paul
[53:28] was bringing this to the people he said
[53:30] the reason it was is because when the
[53:31] Lord was bringing the confirmation of
[53:34] the Covenant remember Genesis 15 now
[53:36] this come after the troubled years this
[53:38] is after the the the great Wars that had
[53:41] taken place in Sodom remember Abraham
[53:43] and he took his servants and they went
[53:44] into Sodom and they fought and they and
[53:46] they brought lot back from captivity and
[53:49] after he came into this out of this
[53:51] battle and he sat down and he met with
[53:53] melaz DIC and here he had that great
[53:55] communion with the with the with the
[53:57] king of peace that had no beginning of
[53:59] days or or or or ending ending of days
[54:01] and so the Bible says but after all
[54:03] these things then the word of the Lord
[54:06] come to Abram in a vision and he said
[54:08] fear not Abram for I am thy shield and
[54:11] thy exceeding great reward oh I love how
[54:14] God starts this conversation but you
[54:15] realize because Abraham had just sat
[54:18] down with the Kings after these great
[54:20] battles and here they offered Abraham
[54:21] rewards but he wouldn't take it I
[54:23] thought my wouldn't it be like kings
[54:25] today if you if you the one that came in
[54:27] and you defended them and your your your
[54:29] your army is what helped them here
[54:30] brother Mark look what they were doing
[54:32] they were offering rewards they were
[54:34] offering an alliance so Abraham you can
[54:36] just you can just buddy up with us and
[54:38] we'll just all we'll just make it and
[54:39] we'll form this great Kingdom but
[54:41] Abraham wouldn't have nothing to do with
[54:42] it he's said I don't want your reward I
[54:44] don't want nothing from you I don't want
[54:46] anybody to be able to say I don't even
[54:48] want to be able to think that it was
[54:50] something that I did that caused me to
[54:52] be who I am but I want to rely on God
[54:54] and God alone so when God comes to meet
[54:57] Abraham the first words that God says is
[55:00] I am thy exceeding great reward my a't
[55:04] that wonderful you know he wouldn't
[55:05] accept a reward but he said I am th I am
[55:08] thy reward and I am thy Shield oh my you
[55:10] realize that when God begins to speak to
[55:12] him and then Abraham he has a question
[55:14] in his heart and he begins to ask God
[55:16] here here Abraham was looking around at
[55:18] his circumstances and all the the things
[55:20] that that had gone on and he he begins
[55:22] to ask God and what a mess that it was
[55:24] brother Mark in the middle of these
[55:26] great battles but but he says he said
[55:28] Lord he said what would you give me
[55:29] seeing that I go childless here it was a
[55:31] man knowing that he had a promise of God
[55:33] remember from from the time that he had
[55:35] gone out but Lord what will you give me
[55:36] seeing that I go childless the only Heir
[55:38] that I have is a servant in my house how
[55:41] can he be my Heir but listen what God
[55:43] said he said he said but your servant
[55:45] shall not be thine Heir but your Heir
[55:47] will come forth out of thy own bows he
[55:50] shall be thine air see I think that's
[55:52] the way it is sometimes brother Mark we
[55:54] have to be reminded because sometimes
[55:56] just like Abraham we look around at the
[55:58] circumstances and say is this my
[56:00] inheritance no doubt Abraham had a right
[56:02] why because he was a man in flesh and
[56:05] sometimes we look around is this my
[56:06] inheritance is my sickness my
[56:08] inheritance is my is this cancer my
[56:10] inheritance is is all these things I'm
[56:12] going through and the the things that
[56:14] was handed down and the genetics of my
[56:16] of My Flesh is this my inheritance the
[56:18] way I act and and sometimes things in my
[56:22] in my spirit get all worked up is this
[56:24] my inheritance am I always going to have
[56:25] to be critical am I always going to have
[56:27] to be uh angry and upset and have these
[56:30] kind of feelings is this my inheritance
[56:32] but let me tell you something friends
[56:34] some things we inherit from our Earthly
[56:36] father and some things we inherit from
[56:39] our heavenly father so here Abraham he's
[56:42] looking around at his circumstances let
[56:44] me tell you but his Earthly father
[56:46] because of you you because of who he was
[56:48] you realize that the heavenly father can
[56:50] give you things above the ability that
[56:52] the Earthly father can give the Earthly
[56:55] father is limited our Earthly body is
[56:57] limited it's limited to Earthly things
[57:00] because of his Earthly father and
[57:01] because of his Earthly condition Abraham
[57:04] was limited in fulfilling the promise of
[57:06] God he was a 75 year old man he didn't
[57:09] have the ability to bring forth child
[57:11] his wife was an old woman she didn't
[57:12] have the ability to bring forth child
[57:14] why because they were from their Earthly
[57:16] father the genetics of their Earthly
[57:19] body and the genetics of a flesh body
[57:21] was not able to produce a promise
[57:23] because of that's because they were
[57:25] Earthly and Abraham was looking at this
[57:27] Earthly part and this Earthly thing and
[57:29] this flesh body and he was looking at
[57:31] the circumstances of Flesh and saying
[57:33] how can I bring about the promise of God
[57:35] for all I see is an old man all I see is
[57:38] the inability to bring forth children
[57:40] but God said but that shall not be thine
[57:43] inheritance see because the heavenly
[57:46] father can give you something greater
[57:47] than the Earthly father can give good to
[57:50] see you brother Robert the heavenly
[57:52] father has ability to give more than the
[57:54] Earthly father can give so look what God
[57:56] does the Bible says the angel of the
[57:59] Lord came to him in the middle of the
[58:01] night oh I can just see it can I just
[58:03] can I just preach it he came to him you
[58:05] you see the Lord come to Abraham come
[58:08] and just put his arm around him Abraham
[58:10] come out here and walk with me for a
[58:11] little bit watch this question it's a
[58:13] real concern how can I have children how
[58:16] how can what what will you do for me how
[58:18] how can I be this how can you be how can
[58:20] I bring this to pass and God takes him
[58:23] out in the wilderness and he comes out
[58:25] there and he says now Abraham he says
[58:28] look towards the heavens look up there
[58:30] Abraham and count the stars but what a
[58:33] way God has what away with words brother
[58:36] Mark what what what will what will my
[58:38] reward be what can you do for me how can
[58:41] I bring this to pass Abraham come here
[58:43] can you count those Stars imagine he was
[58:46] confused talking to the angel of the
[58:48] Lord said well certainly I couldn't
[58:50] count the Stars there's too many to
[58:52] count can you imagine his response as we
[58:54] would how how could we how could we
[58:56] count them and God said he said so shall
[59:01] thy seed
[59:02] be a't that wonderful brother Mark what
[59:04] will you give me count the Stars I have
[59:07] no air count the Stars there's no one to
[59:09] come after me count the Stars what will
[59:11] this be handed down to count the Stars
[59:14] count the stars for so shall thy seed be
[59:17] I think that's what God tries to tell us
[59:19] sometimes brother the cow we get to
[59:20] looking at our circumstances and
[59:22] sometimes it just takes God to come by
[59:24] and say look up you get to looking at
[59:26] the flesh how can I bring about the
[59:28] promise of God in my life you're looking
[59:30] at the wrong thing but it took God to
[59:32] come by an Angel of the Lord in the
[59:34] middle of the night to say quit looking
[59:36] at the circumstance and look up there's
[59:38] a Redemption laying there oh friend
[59:40] sometimes we get so caught up in it it's
[59:42] easy to look around but God said look up
[59:45] in the midst of Trials look up in the
[59:47] midst of tribulation look up the Bible
[59:49] says look unto Jesus who's the author
[59:52] and the finisher of our faith I thank
[59:54] God that we have a place to look in the
[59:56] middle of a hardship look to Jesus in
[59:58] the middle of a trial look to Jesus in
[1:00:01] the middle of when when we feel like
[1:00:02] giving up he said but look to Jesus in
[1:00:04] the middle of our sickness look to Jesus
[1:00:06] when the bills are piled up and we ain't
[1:00:08] got nobody to turn through look to Jesus
[1:00:11] who's the author and the finisher of our
[1:00:13] faith let me tell you what the devil
[1:00:15] wants you to do the devil wants you
[1:00:16] looking around at everything else he
[1:00:18] wants you focus on circumstance well I
[1:00:20] may as well preach the devil wants you
[1:00:22] looking around at all your problems and
[1:00:24] all everybody else's problems and all
[1:00:26] the church problems all the things that
[1:00:28] are going on let me tell you what the
[1:00:30] devil is he's a nosy Devil he's just
[1:00:33] like Bayo was Old King Bala when he came
[1:00:35] to Bam and said but look at Israel over
[1:00:37] here look at Israel over there is it
[1:00:39] some like some big old some big old ugly
[1:00:41] ba to stand there and point out all the
[1:00:44] problems in every other church and all
[1:00:45] the problems that everybody else had oh
[1:00:48] friends I say we ought to turn to ba and
[1:00:50] say shut your mouth I don't have to
[1:00:52] listen to that any longer the spirit of
[1:00:54] B has been
[1:00:56] by the name of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:00:58] looking at circumstance I want to look
[1:01:01] up sometimes sometimes we just have to
[1:01:03] be reminded look up you think you don't
[1:01:06] get caught up in it sometimes we get
[1:01:08] blinded sometimes we don't see things
[1:01:10] correctly sometimes we get into total
[1:01:12] darkness but but you realize if it
[1:01:14] wasn't for Darkness you'd never
[1:01:15] appreciate the light
[1:01:17] hello sometimes we get into total
[1:01:19] darkness even God's Prophet was in total
[1:01:22] darkness we found Apostle Paul one day
[1:01:24] in total darkness his eyes were blinded
[1:01:27] but you notice what happened to Paul
[1:01:28] when he got in this state of blindness
[1:01:30] in his time of Darkness there came a man
[1:01:32] by the name of ananas he said brother
[1:01:34] Saul received thy sight in the same hour
[1:01:38] Paul said I looked up upon him is't that
[1:01:41] wonderful in the middle of in the middle
[1:01:43] of circumstances in darkness sometimes
[1:01:45] that's just what it takes it takes a man
[1:01:47] of God to come by and say look up in the
[1:01:51] middle of problems it takes a man of God
[1:01:53] like cananas to come by and say look
[1:01:55] look up you're looking at the wrong
[1:01:57] thing but just look up come out of
[1:01:59] Darkness look up receive thy side look
[1:02:02] up look past
[1:02:04] circumstances let the past be the past
[1:02:07] and look up you ain't living in the past
[1:02:09] no longer put it behind you and leave it
[1:02:11] behind you and look up God gave you a
[1:02:13] New Hope look
[1:02:14] up you don't have to go to bed with the
[1:02:16] same anxiety and the same problems and
[1:02:19] the same pressures it's behind you look
[1:02:20] up the very thing that was causing it
[1:02:22] you left out of therefore you're free
[1:02:24] this morning so look up
[1:02:27] look
[1:02:29] up man you think about Saul he could
[1:02:31] have sat there and felt bad for himself
[1:02:34] he had a right to can you imagine what
[1:02:36] it felt like to him after getting a
[1:02:38] revelation that the people he killed was
[1:02:40] the was the very was the very God that
[1:02:42] he claimed to serve after getting that
[1:02:44] revelation God I've been fighting
[1:02:45] against you this whole time and I didn't
[1:02:47] even know it he got he could have he
[1:02:49] could have felt terrible when he looked
[1:02:50] to his own life realized all this but I
[1:02:52] think one of the greatest things an and
[1:02:54] I has ever said he said brother Saul a't
[1:02:58] that wonderful when he didn't even feel
[1:02:59] like he was a part but ananas called him
[1:03:02] brother that makes me want to shout all
[1:03:04] over this building he didn't he was a
[1:03:06] murderer of Christians but an and I said
[1:03:08] brother sa other people come by and said
[1:03:10] we don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:03:11] him but an and I said brother sa he
[1:03:13] called him brother friends I don't care
[1:03:14] where you've been I don't care what you
[1:03:16] came out of I don't care how bad it was
[1:03:18] you're here now I say we called each
[1:03:20] other brother I call you sister I
[1:03:22] welcome you into the family of God said
[1:03:24] why because he was brother you know why
[1:03:26] because ananas didn't see his past he
[1:03:28] saw him as he was he was a blood-bought
[1:03:31] Son of God he called him brother brother
[1:03:33] Beni he called him brother he's a blood
[1:03:36] bought Son of God look up look up he
[1:03:39] said well I'm looking I don't see God
[1:03:42] butram said you have to have God in here
[1:03:43] to see God out there see if you haven't
[1:03:46] gotten him here you'll never see him out
[1:03:48] there realize this is what this is what
[1:03:50] Abraham had he believed the Bible says
[1:03:52] he believed in the Lord and it was
[1:03:54] counted unto him for righteousness he
[1:03:57] believed in the Lord it was counted for
[1:03:59] righteousness here is where Paul begins
[1:04:01] to show this promise of being
[1:04:03] unconditional he said see he was called
[1:04:05] righteous before he ever made a single
[1:04:07] act he was accepted by God before he
[1:04:10] made an act of obedience he believed in
[1:04:12] the Lord and he counted unto him for
[1:04:15] righteousness it wasn't an act that he
[1:04:17] done it wasn't it wasn't actions that he
[1:04:19] made it wasn't something that he went
[1:04:20] out and performed butam says see God
[1:04:22] gave Abraham a promise when he was an
[1:04:24] old man 75 his his wife 65 they were
[1:04:26] going to have a child and he made the
[1:04:28] Covenant with Abraham an unconditional
[1:04:30] Covenant and we found out by going back
[1:04:33] in the word that when God makes a
[1:04:34] covenant between him and a man man
[1:04:36] always breaks his Covenant but God
[1:04:38] always keeps his so God made this
[1:04:41] Covenant by himself he put it to Abraham
[1:04:43] he gave it to Abraham not if Abraham
[1:04:45] would do anything but God said I have
[1:04:47] done it see it's already a finished
[1:04:49] thing it's completely and wholly with
[1:04:52] Grace it's not on no conditions at all
[1:04:55] it's God's covenant with Abraham isn't
[1:04:58] that what the Bible said he said but it
[1:04:59] wasn't only for Abraham but it was for
[1:05:02] Abraham's seed after him see there was
[1:05:05] two parts of this Covenant can I get
[1:05:06] into it there was two parts of this
[1:05:08] Covenant one part was natural the other
[1:05:09] part was spiritual and the natural part
[1:05:12] the Bible would tell us that it was
[1:05:13] speaking of the Seed of Abraham it was a
[1:05:14] physical seed a material seed of course
[1:05:17] he said it was the Jewish people and the
[1:05:19] Covenant was to stay in the promised
[1:05:21] land and that God would bless them
[1:05:23] because they fulfilled the Covenant of
[1:05:25] God but then notice that how because
[1:05:28] these were God's people and brother Mark
[1:05:29] they had this Covenant upon their life
[1:05:31] but when you begin to look at the
[1:05:33] prophecy of Ezekiel and you look at the
[1:05:35] vision that Ezekiel had Ezekiel speaks
[1:05:38] of this great nation of Israel and he
[1:05:40] talks to them as being a great tree a
[1:05:42] great olive tree that would that would
[1:05:44] be planted remember in in his vision he
[1:05:46] said it would be uh planted by good soil
[1:05:49] and Great Waters it would bring forth
[1:05:51] branches it would bring bear Mighty
[1:05:52] fruit it would be a goodly Vine and he
[1:05:54] talks about this great nation that God
[1:05:57] is creating but you notice over in the
[1:05:59] book uh uh of Romans in the New
[1:06:01] Testament we find that this great this
[1:06:03] great tree that was built this is what
[1:06:05] he typed it as it was a great tree that
[1:06:07] God has planted it's great it's a goodly
[1:06:09] Vine it's producing it's manifesting but
[1:06:11] in the book of of Romans we find out
[1:06:14] that the gentile people were grafted
[1:06:16] into that very tree so this is where
[1:06:18] Paul would speak of it Romans 11:17 he
[1:06:21] said and if some of the branches be
[1:06:23] broken off and thou being a Wild Olive
[1:06:26] Tree now take a moment and look at this
[1:06:27] the Wild Olive Tree what is he speaking
[1:06:29] of a wild Olive Tree was the gentile
[1:06:32] people so you see because in the ancient
[1:06:34] in the ancient agriculture a wild Olive
[1:06:37] Tree was considered to be less than a
[1:06:39] than a tame Olive Tree see it was it was
[1:06:42] unproductive when it was compared to a
[1:06:44] cultivated Olive because a cultivated
[1:06:46] Olive Tree it was trimmed it was pruned
[1:06:48] it was pruned in a way that it would
[1:06:50] bring forth more fruit anybody that
[1:06:51] knows anything about plants or trees you
[1:06:54] know that when you go and you prune them
[1:06:55] right then they'll put off more branches
[1:06:56] so a tame tree produces more fruit than
[1:06:59] a wild tree it's a it's better it's
[1:07:01] uniform it's everything in order it has
[1:07:04] great production but then Paul he begins
[1:07:07] to speak of the gentile people he said
[1:07:09] but then there's a wild olive tree that
[1:07:11] would be that that thou being a wild
[1:07:13] Olive were grafted in among them so he
[1:07:16] shows of how that that this tree was
[1:07:19] grafted in and would be a partaker Paul
[1:07:21] said of the root and the fatness of the
[1:07:23] Olive Tree now we realize that that that
[1:07:25] this olive tree that in Israel they they
[1:07:28] had they had all these Groves of Olives
[1:07:30] I mean it was a it was a great uh uh
[1:07:32] thing that they planted and and grew
[1:07:34] among them so here here as Paul would
[1:07:36] talk about this he says that we would be
[1:07:38] a partaker of the root and the fatness
[1:07:40] of the Olive Tree so in other words this
[1:07:42] Olive root think about what it
[1:07:44] represents brother Mark it is showing
[1:07:45] the root is where the life comes into
[1:07:47] the tree now where did this come in from
[1:07:49] the life it was in the tree that was
[1:07:51] planted with Abraham in other words the
[1:07:54] Covenant that God made with him that
[1:07:56] abrahamic Covenant it's the very root of
[1:07:58] the Olive Tree that's where that's what
[1:08:00] was planted it started with Abraham so
[1:08:02] if you look at this tree of Israel being
[1:08:04] an olive tree then the root of it it
[1:08:06] could or the the seed of it planted and
[1:08:08] it took root the foundation of it it was
[1:08:10] Abraham it was Father Abraham so here
[1:08:13] God had came and made this Covenant with
[1:08:15] Abraham so here Paul says that we were
[1:08:18] grafted being a wild olive tree that we
[1:08:20] were grafted among them and we are a
[1:08:23] partaker of the root and that means the
[1:08:26] very Covenant that God made with Abraham
[1:08:28] that you and I are partakers of he said
[1:08:31] and the fatness of the Olive Tree oh my
[1:08:33] that b makes me want to shout in other
[1:08:35] words the fatness or or the nutrition or
[1:08:37] the nourishment of that olive tree oh oh
[1:08:40] don't you see it here being nourished in
[1:08:42] other words brother Mark the same
[1:08:44] spiritual blessing that applied to
[1:08:46] Abraham applied to the Gentile the the
[1:08:48] same promises that flowed through that
[1:08:50] Covenant the fatness of the tree the
[1:08:52] promises of God would flow out of every
[1:08:54] Branch so if you were grafted into the
[1:08:56] Olive Tree then the very promise of God
[1:08:59] and the Covenant God made the very life
[1:09:01] that was in the root will grow out of
[1:09:03] every branch and it'll bring forth the
[1:09:05] very fruit of almighty God he said we
[1:09:07] were grafted in therefore we receive the
[1:09:10] of the fatness of the tree that means it
[1:09:12] includes the promises of God so we're a
[1:09:14] receiver of Salvation I'm a receiver of
[1:09:17] Divine Healing I'm a receiver of the
[1:09:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost because I've
[1:09:21] been grafted into the tree of God oh
[1:09:24] don't you see that the Gentile Believers
[1:09:26] by being grafted in they partake in the
[1:09:28] blessings and they become the HS of the
[1:09:32] promises of God we were grafted in the
[1:09:35] tree therefore we're the Hees of the
[1:09:37] same promise now now you remember
[1:09:39] whenever whenever Solomon was building
[1:09:41] the Temple over in Israel remember what
[1:09:43] the Bible said here when he done all the
[1:09:45] order of the Lord and he built that
[1:09:47] Great temple in Israel the Bible says
[1:09:49] then the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:09:51] temple how many remember the story I'm
[1:09:53] not going to preach I won't have time
[1:09:55] but the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:09:56] temple but in ezekiel's Vision Ezekiel
[1:09:59] watched that same Glory that filled the
[1:10:02] temple Ezekiel watch The Glory leave it
[1:10:05] and leave the city of Jerusalem and
[1:10:07] Ezekiel said it like this he said and
[1:10:09] the glory of the Lord went up from the
[1:10:11] midst of the city and it stood upon the
[1:10:13] mountain on the east side of the city
[1:10:16] now let me ask you this how many knows
[1:10:18] what mountain is on the east side of
[1:10:20] Jerusalem it's the Mount of Olives it
[1:10:23] just happens to be the place where the
[1:10:24] olive trees were planted in Jerusalem so
[1:10:27] it's the place of all the all the Groves
[1:10:30] and here Ezekiel says Ezekiel says that
[1:10:33] the glory of the Lord left the midst of
[1:10:35] the city watch he's watching in Vision
[1:10:37] he leaves the midst of the city in other
[1:10:38] words where Solomon's Temple was where
[1:10:40] the glory of the Lord was Ezekiel said
[1:10:42] but the glory of the Lord left the midst
[1:10:44] of the city and it went up onto the
[1:10:46] mountain of Olives I thought my isn't it
[1:10:48] something to think that here God is
[1:10:50] saying when when when Israel forsakes me
[1:10:53] well then I'm going to get back to the
[1:10:54] Olive Tree cuz I got some work to do
[1:10:56] when they forsake me when they won't
[1:10:58] accept me where the glory of the Lord
[1:11:00] went he went to the olive grov why
[1:11:02] brother Marque had a work to do in the
[1:11:04] Olive Grove he said I'll cut off a
[1:11:06] branch that won't produce I'll cut off
[1:11:08] one the ones that have been broken off
[1:11:10] BBE they was broke by War maybe they was
[1:11:12] broke by ancestry maybe they was broke
[1:11:14] by false teaching but those that had
[1:11:16] been broken off that would not believe
[1:11:18] I'll Graft in another Branch that'll
[1:11:20] bring forth life it was Jesus the glory
[1:11:23] of the Lord that went into the olive
[1:11:25] trees oh let me tell you there's
[1:11:26] something special about that mountain of
[1:11:28] Olives you realize it was on the
[1:11:30] mountain of Olives that David the king
[1:11:32] of Israel whenever Absalon came in to
[1:11:34] take over and to cast him out he him
[1:11:36] being an outcast of his own kingdom he
[1:11:39] was a rejected King that was mountain of
[1:11:41] Olives was the mountain that David went
[1:11:43] up and he went up weeping and crying
[1:11:45] over what had just happened brother said
[1:11:47] see when David was rejected from his own
[1:11:49] people him being a king he went up on
[1:11:51] the hill and he looked back over the
[1:11:53] mountain of olives and being EX
[1:11:55] communicated from his own people he
[1:11:57] looked back over the city and he wept
[1:11:59] what he didn't know is 800 years later
[1:12:02] brother Wesley that the son of David
[1:12:04] would sit on the same Hill and he' be
[1:12:07] weeping because he was rejected by his
[1:12:09] own City and he cried out Jerusalem
[1:12:11] Jerusalem how often I would have hovered
[1:12:14] over you as a h does her brood but you
[1:12:16] would not the same place this rejected
[1:12:19] King David had gone Here Comes Here
[1:12:21] Comes the son of David but a mar a
[1:12:23] rejected King that went up that mountain
[1:12:25] of olives and he began to weep over
[1:12:27] Israel oh don't you realize that it was
[1:12:29] on the mountain of Olives that the Bible
[1:12:31] said Jesus spent his evenings in the
[1:12:33] daytime he preached in the temple in the
[1:12:35] night time he Abode in the Mount of
[1:12:37] Olives it was his Dwelling Place this
[1:12:39] was the place that Jesus preached the
[1:12:41] Disciples of the end time and
[1:12:43] tribulation and judgment in Matthew
[1:12:46] 24 so was on the Mount of Olivos you
[1:12:49] watch so many things that take place on
[1:12:50] this very Mountain Matthew 24 he says
[1:12:52] there's a tribulation coming that very
[1:12:54] message when was preached right on that
[1:12:56] mountain of Olives but you realize it
[1:12:58] wasn't all that happened there but also
[1:13:00] on this mountain of Olives it was the
[1:13:02] place that Jesus descended from whenever
[1:13:04] they were standing in the city of
[1:13:06] Jerusalem that day remember he came
[1:13:08] riding down on a CT and they threw their
[1:13:10] cloaks on the ground and they were
[1:13:11] crying Hosanna Hosanna it's the king of
[1:13:14] glory and they begin to shout because
[1:13:16] the King was coming down here he was
[1:13:18] riding on a cat fulfilling prophecy
[1:13:20] descending the Mount of Olives brother
[1:13:22] Mark and the in the Pharisees said would
[1:13:24] you tell them to hold their peace Jesus
[1:13:26] said if they hold their peace these
[1:13:27] rocks would immediately cry out why
[1:13:30] because they recognized who he was that
[1:13:32] was descending from off the mountain
[1:13:35] here we come down that day on the Mount
[1:13:37] of Olives we realized that after his
[1:13:40] resurrection brother Wesley when the
[1:13:42] when the disciples would go with him and
[1:13:44] here he's about to ascend into heaven
[1:13:46] you realize where it was he went up on
[1:13:48] the Mount of oliv and on the Mount of
[1:13:49] Olives the disciples followed him and
[1:13:52] when they came there the Bible says
[1:13:53] after a little while he ascend up into
[1:13:55] heaven and they stared after him into
[1:13:57] the heavens but but but these two men
[1:14:00] begin to speak to him and they they said
[1:14:02] why do you men of Galilee why stand you
[1:14:04] gazing up into heaven these angels they
[1:14:06] were many and why why stand you gazing
[1:14:08] up into heaven that same Jesus which has
[1:14:10] been taken from you into heaven shall
[1:14:12] come in like manner just as you seen him
[1:14:15] go so the very way that you seen him go
[1:14:17] up into the heavens is the same way that
[1:14:20] he'll return oh brother Mar there's so
[1:14:22] much in that you find out that in the
[1:14:24] end of the Great tribulation whenever
[1:14:26] Christ would return to the earth oh you
[1:14:28] realize that it was on the Mount of
[1:14:30] Olives where Jesus will appear Matthew
[1:14:32] 24 he said immediately after the
[1:14:35] tribulation in those days the sun would
[1:14:37] be darken and the then shall appear the
[1:14:40] sign of the sun of man in heaven and
[1:14:42] then shall the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:14:44] and they shall see the son of man coming
[1:14:47] in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[1:14:49] with great Glory Zechariah 14 he said on
[1:14:52] that day his feet shall stand on the the
[1:14:55] Mount of Olives that lies Jerusalem to
[1:14:57] the east so the very way you seen him go
[1:15:00] up is the very way he'll come down the
[1:15:02] very place they seen him go up is the
[1:15:04] very place he'll come down oh friends oh
[1:15:06] my a't that something to think about
[1:15:08] here one day that he'll come and descend
[1:15:11] right back on that same Mountain I'll
[1:15:13] tell you what my Bible says the Bible
[1:15:14] says one day at the end of this
[1:15:16] tribulation that that great mountain of
[1:15:18] Olives it'll split in two that great
[1:15:20] earthquake will take place it'll divide
[1:15:22] in two and out of the ground will come a
[1:15:24] great Mountain but say it'll be pushed
[1:15:27] up out of the earth cuz there will be no
[1:15:28] more sea and out of this great ground
[1:15:30] ground will come this great mountain
[1:15:32] right in the middle of the Mount of Oles
[1:15:34] it'll grow up to the top and Out of
[1:15:36] Heaven Will descend that man Jesus
[1:15:38] Christ and he'll sit up on his throne
[1:15:41] 1500 miles up in the air out of the
[1:15:44] ground will come the mountain and out of
[1:15:46] heaven will come the city to set up on
[1:15:48] that mountain oh friends don't you
[1:15:50] realize that here that that very place
[1:15:52] that he'll come that very place at this
[1:15:54] New Jerusalem was set that was the same
[1:15:56] city that Abraham was looking for when
[1:15:58] he went out looking for a city whose
[1:16:00] Builder and maker was God and looking
[1:16:02] for a city that had no Foundation the
[1:16:05] prophet of God said I believe it was the
[1:16:06] same place they say it was in Salem OR
[1:16:09] the near the City of Salem which became
[1:16:11] Jerusalem but in that same place that
[1:16:13] Abraham sat and met with mezc is the
[1:16:16] same place that the God will descend
[1:16:18] again upon the upon this Earth in that
[1:16:22] same place that oh my let me tell you
[1:16:24] something isn't that wonderful the same
[1:16:26] way you seen him go up is the same way
[1:16:27] you seen him go down but I got news for
[1:16:30] you brother Mark he won't be there alone
[1:16:32] can I read it for the Bible said and he
[1:16:35] shall send his angels with a great sound
[1:16:37] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[1:16:39] together his elect from the Four Winds
[1:16:41] and from one end of Heaven to the other
[1:16:43] that means on that same Mountain brother
[1:16:45] Mah that same Mount of Olives here where
[1:16:47] that New Jerusalem is setting that the
[1:16:49] very Believers the the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ those that are redeemed of God

[1:17:02] eternal day a city where the lamb is the
[1:17:04] LI oh Hallelujah one day we're going to
[1:17:08] this
[1:17:09] place he said Jesus has gone to prepare
[1:17:12] it with the Divine hands a Divine City a
[1:17:15] Divine architect for a Divine bought
[1:17:17] people for a predestinated people he has

[1:17:27] that mountain I want to be I want to
[1:17:29] live in that City I want to be on that
[1:17:31] mountain I I want to send that mountain
[1:17:34] but let me show you something do you
[1:17:36] realize what was laying at the base of
[1:17:38] the Mount of Olives this is the place
[1:17:41] before Jesus's crucifixion that they
[1:17:43] came to arrest him right at the base of
[1:17:46] the Mount of Olives is the Garden of
[1:17:48] Gethsemane here is the place of
[1:17:50] self-sacrifice it's the place of
[1:17:53] surrendering to your own will brother
[1:17:55] said Jesus died more of a death in
[1:17:56] Gethsemane than he died on the cross it
[1:17:59] was a die dying out to my own flesh and
[1:18:01] dying out to my own will remember he
[1:18:03] said if this cup P could pass from me he
[1:18:06] said nevertheless let not my will but
[1:18:08] thy will be
[1:18:09] done he said oh before see before you
[1:18:13] can go to the mountain you had to pass
[1:18:15] by Gethsemane isn't that good before you
[1:18:18] can have a place on the mountain you got
[1:18:21] to have a Gethsemane you're going to
[1:18:22] have to pass by this this Place see it's
[1:18:25] a dying out to self will it's a dying
[1:18:27] out to our flesh and a receiving of the
[1:18:30] life of Jesus Christ the very place that
[1:18:32] he laid spiritually speaking the very
[1:18:34] place that he laid in the very Cross of
[1:18:37] dying out brother John every one of us
[1:18:39] have to come to that same place we had
[1:18:41] to meet God on those same grounds we
[1:18:43] have to have our own Gethsemane a dying
[1:18:45] out to our own self and our flesh in
[1:18:47] order to be able to dwell on that
[1:18:49] mountain brother BR said then all the
[1:18:51] saints that died all over the world they
[1:18:54] may have been burned they were drowned
[1:18:55] they were eat by lions everything else
[1:18:57] but they'll come forth out of every
[1:18:58] crack every crevice every corner of the
[1:19:00] world I hope I'm there I don't know
[1:19:02] where where I'll be but wherever it is
[1:19:04] if I'm in that group there's nothing
[1:19:05] that can keep me from being there and I
[1:19:07] don't have to be any certain place only
[1:19:10] place I have to be is in Christ oh my
[1:19:13] that don't don't that mess up the
[1:19:14] legalist you mean I don't have to go to
[1:19:16] your church to be saved praise the Lord
[1:19:18] no you don't only place I have to be is
[1:19:20] in Christ for those that are in Christ
[1:19:24] will bring god with him I don't care
[1:19:26] where it's at but bury me in Jesus cuz
[1:19:29] he'll bring me there we it ain't we
[1:19:32] ain't got to make our way there brother
[1:19:33] Mark we we ain't got a journey there we
[1:19:35] don't have to have a pilgrimage to get
[1:19:37] there he said just bury me in Christ
[1:19:39] Jesus and Jesus will bring me there
[1:19:42] he'll place my feet on the mountain
[1:19:44] he'll carry me up in my Dwelling Place a
[1:19:46] mansion that he has prepared for me in
[1:19:50] glory bury me in Jesus and he'll bring
[1:19:53] me there
[1:19:55] hallelujah thank you Lord bury me in
[1:19:58] Jesus and he'll bring me
[1:20:00] there said what's Paul telling that
[1:20:03] those that were outwardly was not the
[1:20:06] Jews but it was inwardly that were the
[1:20:08] seeds of Abraham for the Bible says we
[1:20:11] being dead in Christ we take on
[1:20:13] Abraham's seed and we are Hees according
[1:20:16] to the promise so see now the reason
[1:20:18] we're called Abraham's seed is because
[1:20:20] that Abraham's seed physically was
[1:20:22] speaking onto Isaac Isaac to Christ
[1:20:25] Christ came back he gave his life a
[1:20:26] ransom for us then he sent the Holy
[1:20:29] Spirit back which gives us the faith
[1:20:30] that Abraham had before he was ever
[1:20:33] circumcised he believed God and it was
[1:20:36] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:20:39] then God gave him the sign of
[1:20:41] circumcision as a confirmation or a
[1:20:44] recognition of his faith see God had
[1:20:47] given him the promise because of his
[1:20:48] faith God gave him the promise because
[1:20:50] he believed but then he gave him the
[1:20:52] sign as a recognition of his faith
[1:20:55] because isn't that wonderful see so it's
[1:20:56] an unconditional promise he said
[1:20:58] therefore today when we believe God with
[1:21:00] all of our heart and accept his son the
[1:21:03] Lord Jesus and God recognizes that faith
[1:21:05] is true in him then he sends back down
[1:21:07] the Holy Spirit of promise and he seals
[1:21:10] us until the day of our Redemption my
[1:21:12] that takes all of the scare out of
[1:21:16] it hallu is't that wonderful it takes
[1:21:20] all the scare out of it he sent back his
[1:21:23] holy spirit to seal us
[1:21:25] it takes all this SC out of it says see
[1:21:27] so there's no negative thoughts in all
[1:21:29] of Christianity that makes me want to
[1:21:31] shout hallelujah there ain't no negative
[1:21:34] thought in all of Christian you know men
[1:21:36] men men make negative thoughts men are
[1:21:39] are the one that that bind people and
[1:21:40] they they hold people by their Authority
[1:21:42] and they make everything about the Bible
[1:21:44] D if you don't do this you're going to
[1:21:46] hell if you don't do this God's going to
[1:21:47] judge you and if you don't do this
[1:21:48] you're going to you're going to get a
[1:21:49] curse you don't get all this going to
[1:21:51] happen to you but there ain't no
[1:21:52] negative thought in Christianity they
[1:21:55] use negativity to bind it and to hold
[1:21:57] people they take quotes and they twist
[1:21:59] them all up to promote some negative
[1:22:00] perspective but friends today you're
[1:22:02] saved and tomorrow you're lost or as
[1:22:05] long as you agree then you're saved if
[1:22:06] you don't agree with me no more then
[1:22:08] you're lost but friends that ain't got
[1:22:09] nothing to do with
[1:22:10] Christianity for the Bible says he has
[1:22:12] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:22:15] you know what that means it's already
[1:22:17] done but B said everything in
[1:22:19] Christianity is past tense it's already
[1:22:22] hello somebody everything is past 10
[1:22:25] it's already finished that means the
[1:22:26] healing is not what a man can do it's
[1:22:29] what Jesus has already done salvation is
[1:22:31] not what a man can do it's what God has
[1:22:33] already done it ain't what a church can
[1:22:35] do it's what God has already done it's a
[1:22:38] finished work and your faith in that
[1:22:41] finished work that Christ completed
[1:22:43] everything and was brought in the fall
[1:22:45] Christ redeemed it back by his atoning
[1:22:47] death vicarious suffering at calvary's
[1:22:50] Cross and he was put in the grave and
[1:22:52] God raised him up on the third day for
[1:22:54] our justification and now we see him
[1:22:57] sitting on the right hand of God making
[1:22:59] intercessions Upon Our profession for
[1:23:01] the same word is or or confession said
[1:23:04] no matter how much you pray how much you
[1:23:07] cry how much you agonize how much you do
[1:23:10] it will never be accepted right for God
[1:23:14] can do nothing for you until first by
[1:23:17] faith you just accept it believe it and
[1:23:20] confess it people agonize they cry they
[1:23:23] pray they cut theel they shout they run
[1:23:25] they do everything they can to try to be
[1:23:27] a part of God and and to be an heir of
[1:23:29] the promise of God but it don't matter
[1:23:31] how much you cry how much you agonize
[1:23:33] over it said the first thing you have to
[1:23:34] do is by faith accept the promise of God
[1:23:37] accept that I'm an heir of God accept
[1:23:39] that I'm a Seed of Abraham and then
[1:23:40] believe it with all your heart just like
[1:23:42] Abraham did he said oh thy seed shall
[1:23:45] number the stars of the heaven I believe
[1:23:47] you Lord and then made it it count him
[1:23:49] for righteous and then brother Mark you
[1:23:51] then you go and confess it I accept it
[1:23:53] somebody say I accept it I believe it
[1:23:57] and I confess it oh some of you didn't
[1:23:59] say I confess it but go ahead and
[1:24:01] confess it even if it's a whisper just
[1:24:02] barely let it out I confess that's a
[1:24:05] little bit of a confession it's still a
[1:24:07] confession if you can barely talk if you
[1:24:08] can't speak signed language I confess it
[1:24:11] it's a promise of God I don't mean that
[1:24:14] as a funny but but but but but speak it
[1:24:17] however you can I confess It Whatever
[1:24:19] language I confess it I confess it I
[1:24:22] accept it I believe it I confess it
[1:24:25] listen this is what Paul's message in
[1:24:27] Galatians 3 was about that the receiving
[1:24:30] of the Holy Spirit was a sign of true
[1:24:33] faith in Jesus Christ it was not a
[1:24:35] result of following the law so it don't
[1:24:38] matter what you're going through by
[1:24:41] faith you're a child of God somebody say
[1:24:42] by Faith by faith we're Overcomers what
[1:24:45] Jesus say he said he that overcometh
[1:24:47] shall inherit all things and I will be
[1:24:49] his God and he shall be my son isn't
[1:24:52] that wonderful God's placed in you the
[1:24:53] ability to overcome the devil he said
[1:24:55] you know that Christ was manifested to
[1:24:57] take away our sins for in him there is
[1:25:00] no sin and whoever abideth in him sinth
[1:25:03] not for whoever is born of God does not
[1:25:05] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:25:08] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:25:11] God and in this Paul said in this the
[1:25:15] children of God are manifested and the
[1:25:17] children of the devil in other words
[1:25:19] that's how you tell the difference is
[1:25:21] the children of God they can't sin in
[1:25:23] other words they can't dis believe
[1:25:24] that's what sin is it's unbelief and
[1:25:26] because they're the children of God they
[1:25:28] can't disbelieve because there's a seed
[1:25:30] of God in them therefore they can't
[1:25:32] seeing so that that's why we can say it
[1:25:34] this morning let me say I believe that
[1:25:36] means I'm not a child of the devil I'm a
[1:25:39] Child of God somebody say it I'm a Child
[1:25:41] of God we're not a child of the devil
[1:25:43] we're the children of God I accept it I
[1:25:45] believe it and I confess it I'm not a
[1:25:48] child of the devil but by the blood of
[1:25:50] Jesus Christ and my faith in the power
[1:25:52] of God I accept it and confess it today
[1:25:55] I'm a Child of God in Me God's seed
[1:25:57] remains in me is the supernatural in
[1:26:00] me's the Holy Ghost In Me Is the power
[1:26:02] to overcome and I say greater is he that
[1:26:04] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:26:08] I'm a Child of
[1:26:09] God hallelujah I'm a Child of God oh let
[1:26:14] me tell you can me show you something
[1:26:15] powerful just before the musicians come
[1:26:18] you realize Abraham was dealing with
[1:26:20] these two covenants it was law and Grace
[1:26:22] but right in the levitical law of Moses
[1:26:25] but Mark God shows Israel that the
[1:26:28] abrahamic Covenant I was reading this
[1:26:29] this week about Shadow all over my
[1:26:31] actually I did a little shouting didn't
[1:26:33] about nothing I did a little but right
[1:26:36] in the middle of this levitical law of
[1:26:38] Moses God shows Israel that the
[1:26:40] abrahamic Covenant is a greater Covenant
[1:26:43] even written in the law here remember in
[1:26:45] the law of Moses it would come down from
[1:26:47] the mountain he gave them the law of God
[1:26:48] to live by what they must do what they
[1:26:50] couldn't do sacrifices that had to be
[1:26:52] made for atonement and then the Lord
[1:26:54] begins to tell them that that that
[1:26:55] despite receiving the curses for failure
[1:26:57] remember we preached a message on it but
[1:26:59] despite receiving the curses for their
[1:27:02] failure because they wouldn't keep that
[1:27:04] old Covenant but yet God would remain
[1:27:06] faithful to his people now let me show
[1:27:08] you something because when God is
[1:27:10] showing them that he'll remain faithful
[1:27:11] do you realize that the faithfulness of
[1:27:13] God was not a part of the Mosaic
[1:27:15] Covenant but the faithfulness of God
[1:27:17] came out of the abrahamic Covenant in
[1:27:20] other words God would remain faithful
[1:27:21] despite what You' done so it wasn't that
[1:27:23] wasn't Mosaic that was from Abraham and
[1:27:26] here says see it was it was God being
[1:27:28] faithful it was and so this abrahamic
[1:27:30] Covenant being unconditional the Lord
[1:27:32] was mound to protect Israel and despite
[1:27:34] their failure and to keep the because
[1:27:36] they couldn't keep the old Covenant they
[1:27:38] see they were cursed by the law they
[1:27:40] would be cursed they' go out of their
[1:27:41] borders of protection and according to
[1:27:43] the law when they got in this place out
[1:27:45] of their borders here the Bible says but
[1:27:47] if they confess Leviticus 26 if they
[1:27:50] confess their iniquity and the iniquity
[1:27:52] of their fathers with their trespasses
[1:27:54] es which they trespassed against me that
[1:27:56] they also they have walked contrary to
[1:27:59] me and I've walked contrary to them and
[1:28:01] I and and have brought them into the
[1:28:02] land of their enemies if then their
[1:28:04] uncircumcised Hearts would be humbled
[1:28:06] and they would accept of the punishment
[1:28:07] of their iniquity then I will remember
[1:28:09] my Covenant with Jacob and also Isaac
[1:28:12] and Abraham will I remember and yet for
[1:28:15] for after all that when they be in the
[1:28:17] land of their enemies I will not cast
[1:28:19] them away neither will I abore them to
[1:28:21] destroy them utterly and to break my
[1:28:23] Covenant with with them for I am the
[1:28:25] Lord their God in the midst of the law
[1:28:28] here when the curse was supposed to come
[1:28:30] and here they'd be cast into the land of
[1:28:32] their enemies but here God said even in
[1:28:34] the midst of the law but if they'll hear
[1:28:36] me and they'll repent I will be I I'll
[1:28:38] remember them I'm not going to leave
[1:28:40] them in their enemies I won't cast them
[1:28:42] away I won't utterly destroy them it'll
[1:28:44] be just for a little while but I will
[1:28:46] not break my Covenant with him for I and
[1:28:48] the Lord thy God he wasn't speaking of
[1:28:50] the Covenant of Moses he was speaking of
[1:28:52] the Covenant of Abraham I will not break
[1:28:54] my Covenant I am a faithful God I'll see
[1:28:56] to it that you make it in the end oh
[1:28:58] there'll be 144,000 that'll live in that
[1:29:01] City why that God has God had made a
[1:29:04] promise to the children of Israel out of
[1:29:06] every tribe there' be those that would
[1:29:08] that would make it par think of it here
[1:29:10] in the midst of the law but Grace still
[1:29:11] stands brother say God means for people
[1:29:13] to live by Grace not by law we get so
[1:29:16] legalistic tell we well it'd be wrong
[1:29:18] for me to smoke and it'd be wrong for me
[1:29:20] to run around on my while he said but
[1:29:21] that ain't got nothing to do with it it
[1:29:23] ought to be out of love that we don't
[1:29:25] smoke because if you love God you won't
[1:29:27] do evil things because you love him too
[1:29:29] much it a well I don't go do that cuz
[1:29:31] I'll get in trouble I can't do that
[1:29:32] it'll make them mad I can't do that it's
[1:29:34] wrong to do that ain't what we're doing
[1:29:36] it's because we love God and the love of
[1:29:38] God in our hearts it keeps us away from
[1:29:40] those things and sometimes brother Mark
[1:29:43] even in all that the Sons and Daughters
[1:29:44] of God you get trapped up and you make
[1:29:47] mistakes and you fall but here our God
[1:29:49] even in the middle of the law he said
[1:29:51] but I won't leave them there forever I
[1:29:53] won't leave them in in the land of their
[1:29:54] enemy but when they call upon me I'll
[1:29:57] remember the Covenant that I have made
[1:29:59] with him and I will bring them
[1:30:02] out it's a Covenant of
[1:30:04] Grace remember that's what Dwight Moody
[1:30:06] said remember he preached on Romans 7
[1:30:09] the story said he went out in the street
[1:30:10] after he preached the message first guy
[1:30:12] he said he goes do you know Grace the
[1:30:13] guy said Grace who he said the grace of
[1:30:16] God do you know Grace Grace who it's the
[1:30:19] grace of God you see it thrilled me when
[1:30:22] I see how that Grace separates us from
[1:30:24] the law and that what part that Grace
[1:30:27] played said see for it's by grace that
[1:30:29] we are saved not what we can do no no
[1:30:32] matter whatever we do it's not counted
[1:30:34] to us but it's Grace is what saves us
[1:30:38] and by Grace you are Sav through faith
[1:30:40] We're The Heirs of God not just Abraham
[1:30:44] but The Heirs of the seed Here We Stand
[1:30:46] today brother Wesley think about here
[1:30:50] that that that not the promise wasn't
[1:30:52] just to Abraham as the music players
[1:30:53] would come
[1:30:54] the promise wasn't just to Abraham but
[1:30:57] the promise was to The
[1:30:58] Heirs is't that wonderful here Abraham
[1:31:01] being a man of God it was counted them
[1:31:02] for righteousness he was a Believer but
[1:31:05] the promise wasn't just for him it was
[1:31:07] to his HS you know I thought about how
[1:31:10] it was that
[1:31:12] day here when God came to Abraham and he
[1:31:16] says to him take your son Isaac up on
[1:31:19] the mountain and sacrifice him to
[1:31:22] me Abraham being a faithful man obeyed
[1:31:26] the Lord and he took his son his only
[1:31:29] son the one that God had promised him
[1:31:32] the one that his heirs would come from
[1:31:35] hear this promised son Jared he walks
[1:31:38] down the path and took a journey over
[1:31:40] there to go up on the
[1:31:42] mountain then they come to this place
[1:31:45] and he turns around to the other men
[1:31:47] says you know me and the lad we're going
[1:31:49] to go up on the mountain but then we're
[1:31:52] going to come back
[1:31:54] so he goes and I can just see Abra or
[1:31:57] little Isaac just walking along with his
[1:31:59] daddy can I just paraphrase this he's
[1:32:02] walking along with his daddy a a young
[1:32:05] boy and he's as he's walking along and
[1:32:08] remember what the Bible says he looked
[1:32:09] over and they're making their way up the
[1:32:11] mountain for the sacrifice and he says
[1:32:13] Daddy I see the I see the sticks and you
[1:32:17] know I see the I see the cord I see the
[1:32:21] the parts that's used to make a
[1:32:23] sacrifice
[1:32:25] but where is the
[1:32:26] sacrifice but you realize who Isaac was
[1:32:30] he didn't even know who he was he's
[1:32:32] walking with his daddy I can just see
[1:32:34] Abraham walking with his son Lord dad
[1:32:39] where's the sacrifice what will God
[1:32:41] provide us what would God give us he
[1:32:44] just put his arm around him and say
[1:32:46] Isaac look up in the
[1:32:49] heavens can you count the Stars son
[1:32:52] daddy you know I can't count the Stars
[1:32:54] one you just see him counting one two
[1:32:56] three four five I can't count past a
[1:33:00] thousand Daddy I can't count all those
[1:33:02] Stars he said that was the same promise
[1:33:05] that God gave me he said you can't count
[1:33:08] them and so shall thy seed be you know
[1:33:11] what the Lord told me he said in Isaac
[1:33:13] shall thy seed be called so son don't
[1:33:16] you worry about no wonder Abraham could
[1:33:17] walk up on that mountain he he was an
[1:33:19] heir that's right no wonder he could
[1:33:21] take him up that mountain because he
[1:33:22] knew who he was Isaac may not know who
[1:33:24] Isaac was but Abraham knew who Isaac was
[1:33:27] and even the heir of God the promise of
[1:33:29] God applied to him said so shall thy
[1:33:32] seed be here you know sometimes we
[1:33:36] realize that being obedient but the
[1:33:38] grace of God the promise of God it
[1:33:40] supersedes our obedience sometimes we're
[1:33:43] doing everything that we we're supposed
[1:33:45] to do and it don't seem like things work
[1:33:46] out anybody ever felt like that go to
[1:33:49] church it didn't work out you do
[1:33:51] everything like you're supposed to but
[1:33:53] but it just didn't seem to work out but
[1:33:55] here he reminds them he reminds them
[1:33:57] that thy seed shall number the stars of
[1:33:59] the heaven not just for Abraham but for
[1:34:02] his seed won't you to stand to your feet
[1:34:04] this
[1:34:07] morning when I think about the
