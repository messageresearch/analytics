Holy Ghost a real move of God and uh we look to see the supernatural amen and to see the things that God does and I also would ask the church to remember our uh trip we're uh planning uh tentatively a trip to India in January and so we just asked we had to cut cut it off last time and so I wasn't able to go so if you would be be praying about that with us and maybe just bow your heads together before we approach the word and just ask the Lord to take the word of God this morning and speak to you how many could do that say Lord I just want you to speak to my heart and and I I know that God is able to do it let's just ask him Lord Jesus Lord how we love you this morning and God as a body of Believers Lord we approach you and Lord as we are preparing to open this word of life and God knowing that anybody that had ability to read could read these scriptures Lord we could say some things about it Lord that might make that might be good or something like that but Lord we don't just want to do that this morning God we want to invite you Lord that you would come into this service and Lord as your presence as we stand here in your presence Lord knowing that whenever a word is spoken that is that is Anointed Lord that you can take it and you can change your life with it Lord we ask you to take these words this morning Lord to anoint them with your spirit God that it would have an effect on the people Lord and we'll give you the glory for all that you do in Jesus name we pray amen amen we just want to invite you uh to the Bible to the book of St John we'll read out of the 14th chapter and we'll start in the first verse so John 14 and we'll read from the first verse down to the sixth verse amen just appreciate our our musicians just dedicated and uh do you love the Lord this morning amen you love each other amen well praise the Lord amen just want to read John 14 and we'll read out of the first verse Jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we know we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me we just ask ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats and I want to speak this morning on a kingdom inheritance we've been uh preaching on a series on on a kingdom series over the past several weeks and uh this morning I want to take this direction on a kingdom inheritance last Sunday if I know many of you were here uh but last Sunday we spoke on a kingdom Revelation how many how many uh that was a blessing to them I hope it hope it was but uh we were speaking on the kingdom Revelation and how that uh Peter's Revelation that that that that earned him or or or from it God had given him uh the keys to the kingdom and we we showed how that he used that key to open the door to every class of people remember in the book of Acts in the second chapter he he opened the door to the he went from the upper room and preached the gospel and and uh and and and and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and that was to the Jews and then in Acts the 8th chapter to the Samaritan uh he preached and went to Samaria and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and then acts the 10th chapter he went down to the Gentile cornelius's house and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and you notice each time it was the same message and the same gospel and the same Holy Ghost that came and so brother Bram said there was our three people it was ham Shem and japas people so no more from that day was an apostle used to for the keys to the kingdom to open the kingdom because it was open to everybody then I thank God this morning that we sit here uh with an Open Door by the Holy Ghost brother Jared that we've been given an Open Door the church has received the power of God we're not sitting here as a powerless people but we're sitting uh as Believers this morning that has received the power of God God has given us a door and access uh into the kingdom of God and I believe that uh it's it was never closed he said it would be a door that would be opened that could never be closed and it was not a door that was opened by man it was opened by God he gave the key and the key uh he opened it up that we could all en enjoy the blessings and the fruit of that land that God has certainly given to us this day and but even even then the Bible would say that there was still yet many great Mysteries that surrounded the kingdom of God uh that would remain but but but but throughout the generations through thousands of years that has gone by and the Mystery would remain uh around the church but the Bible promised in that time that there would come a day a time that there would no longer be a mystery to the church and you remember when John wrote about it in Revelations the 10th chapter he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets now I know what the world has done with that they said well it'll be the end of time that's this great trumpet will sound and all the the Mysteries will be revealed in in in eternity but where the mark it all the Mysteries will will be revealed and we'll all know all these things of God but but when you actually uh uh look at this scripture in the days of the voice this word days comes from a Hebrew word Hamera which meant a day or a time or a period of years and so we realize that it couldn't be a time in eternity it's not coming after the Rapture in a time of Eternity but it was actually during a space of time preceding the Rapture so so John would say in the days of the voice you could say it like this in the age of The Voice or in the time time of The Voice or in the years of the voice of the seventh angel when he would begin to sound then the mystery of God would be finished so we realize that this morning that we're not living in an age of mystery but we're living in an age of Revelation how many say Amen to that we're not living in an age of mystery God has took the mystery off the church I know there may be some people that are that are living in mystery but but it's just because they haven't came to the light but the mystery has been revealed the all that that was hidden has been open to the Church of the Living God there ain't no promise that God has given the church that is not available there's no uh there there's nothing in the scripture that God had ever promised to any believer that is not open to us today you believe that this morning so we're a body of Believers we've got to write to the promises of God we see that that that there was so many Mysteries but according to the Bible they would be revealed in the end time John said in the mystery would be finished in other words there wouldn't be another mystery that would come and but said what would happen he said the B the Bible says is the Angel is supposed to reveal the mysteries of God and and they would be revealed in this day and I know that many have put that on on on a man and many have put it on on somebody like that but said but I say this with reverence he said I'm not referring to myself I'm referring to the angel of God so we realize it was the angel of God that revealed the mystery of serpent seed that said that it wasn't it wasn't an apple or something in the garden that caused the fall in the garden you see it was the angel of God that revealed the mystery of an eternal hell where the world would say that you'll burn for eternity but here the angel of the Lord would come and say Well it couldn't be an eternal hell because if it was eternal it meant it had no beginning and no ending and hell was created for Satan and his angels so so it couldn't be Eternal but it was an angel from of God brother Mark that revealed the baptism of the Holy Ghost without Sensation that there had to be a move of God that the person of Christ would come and perform the works that he did before it was the angel of God that revealed water baptism remember the extreme trinitarian had had taken the formula of water baptism made Father and Son and Holy ghost and and built this great uh uh Church in that way but the angel of God would come and would reveal it the right way back in the end time it was the angel of God that would reveal the mystery of the godhead by the baptism of Jesus Christ of him the being the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and that in that in that same name it was the angel of God that would introduce the pillar of fire in this age that we're living in again the returning of the pillar of fire it was the angel of God that would that would reveal the true Grace and not uh not as the world has made it but not as a disgrace but when the angel of the Lord would reveal Grace he would reveal it as God had intended it for to be in other words it's Grace it would cover everything but it was Grace enough to take you out of sin it was it was Grace enough to to give you the ability to overcome the flesh it so so it the angel of the Lord that brought the revelations of God it was the angel of God that brought the revelation of the kingdom of God it wasn't a man it was the angel of God somebody say Amen just preach with me a minute it was the angel of God that done it and it ain't a man two times too many times we get focused on who's doing what and what man's doing this and who who's got this position or who's got this place but but but look past the man this morning and look to the angel of the Lord and see what God is doing you realize it's a work of God and what God has doing in our midst it's not to give credit to a man or to a group of people but it's to give credit to the Holy Ghost and what God is doing for us in this hour so when we come and we worship and we praise God we're thanking God for what God is doing it ain't somebody that's building us up it's but what God has done for us but the mark it causes us to be able to come and give back to him it was the angel of God that brought the Revelation he said it was the revelation of the Kingdom being the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost it came by the angel of God you know this this morning that God desires for you to catch the revelation of the age that you live in that's the desire of God and I realize that it's a struggle today it's a struggle for people to even come to church or to sit in the house of God but let alone to catch the revelation of the age that the they live in but this has always been God's desire all the way back in the beginning when he started with Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel it was God's desire for them to catch the revelation of the age that they lived in remember when Cain he went out and he made a sacrifice before God but God denied Cain and he accepted Abel why did he accept Abel brother said because he had the right sacrifice and God received Abel by faith and by Revelation there wasn't no other way there wasn't a Bible that was written so it only came by Revelation and then his faith in the Revelation that he had he performed a sacrifice before God and God accepted him upon those grounds he said see so you can see that the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth speaking of Revelation and the entire Church of the Living God is built upon that can you say that with me this morning the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth somebody say that with me the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth and the entire Church of the Living God is built bu upon that now I don't think for a minute that anybody come in this church this morning that don't want to be right before God I don't think that you wasted your time and you come down to the house of God and you don't want to be righteous before God but I believe that we have a desire to be right by God I believe we have a desire for God to be pleased with us I believe that the desire of our heart is that God would accept our sacrifice when we make a sacrifice before God I believe that's the desire of our heart but the prophet said but the beginning of righteousness in order to be righteous before God the beginning of righteousness is a revealed truth of God see this is what separated Peter from all the rest of them in the world when it came concerning Christ was the revealed truth that Peter had that the rest of the world didn't have he had a revelation of who he was brother the mark and it separated him from the world and that's what separates you from the world this morning it's revealed truths they may have Finer Things They may have some with with finer houses they may have finer cars they they may have finer jobs but friends you have something that the world don't have you have a revealed truth of God's word and that's the beginning of righteousness with God here the world is seeking to be accepted by God and they make all the effort and all the the time spent and all the work that they put in in order to be accepted by God but the beginning of righteousness is a revealed truth I thank God that we have a revelation of the word of God this morning that we have a truth that God has sent in this hour that is sunk down in the heart of the believer that we can approach God and righteousness uh be upon our life see the revealed truth of God's word is the beginning of righteousness that's what happened when the Seven Seals were open it was seven revealed truths that came to restore the church back to its former glory or to a place of righteousness you say well brother Matt why does it have to be righteousness well this is my message this morning because Paul says it like this in 1 Corinthians 6:9 he said know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God so in order to inherit the Kingdom of God we must first be righteous but to have righteousness we must have it to inherit the kingdom and righteousness begins with revealed truth you see why Revelation is so important to the church I love this term inherit the Kingdom what a beautiful expression that it is to inherit the kingdom of God see because an inheritance is something that is given to you it's something that is passed down brother Joel this is what happened in Israel before when whenever Jesus came in his first coming this was one of the main things that Israel was searching for they were looking uh for the coming of a messiah the world had become completely alienated from God and they were they were they were expecting a messiah or the son of man to come and he would set the record straight he would make he would write all the wrongs in in in in in in Jewish history they would say it like this he would come and determine who was worthy to inherit the Kingdom so here this Messiah would come and here here of course Christ came and they never recognized that he was the one in that position they actually mocked him for speaking of the kingdom of God and how well if you're the king of the Jews well well well where's your you know well come down off the cross all these things that they that they mocked him with but you realize that this was what they were looking for is someone that would come to determine who would inherit the Kingdom now you notice that Jesus when he comes he actually uses this same language in Matthew 25 even when he speaks of the second coming he said when the son of man shall come in his glory he'll put in his right he'll Gather in his right hand the Lambs in his left hand the goats he said then he'll turn to those that are in his right hand and he'll say unto them blessed are you are blessed to my father so Come Ye that are blessed to the father and inherit the Kingdom for prepared for you before the foundation of the world in Matthew 5 he said blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven see to inherit the kingdom of God see an inheritance is something that is given it's not earned but Joe isn't that I just think that's a good thing because or it's such a powerful thought because here Jesus would emphasize this to inherit the kingdom of God brother brother Morgan what it what it tells us is that it emphasizes that the kingdom of God is a Divine gift it's not based on human achievement it's not based on what we can do but Jesus said but you can inherit it oh I think it's wonderful he didn't say well blessed are those that have earned their way into the kingdom of God or blessed are those that are worthy to be able to receive the kingdom of God he said but blessed are those that inherit the Kingdom see it's something to receive an inheritance it's something that is given to you it's a Divine gift of God but in order to receive receive an inheritance you have to first be an heir an heir is one that is entitled to receive or entitled entitled to inherit so so when you see Israel and you you study through their their history Israel in the natural they were the natural children of Abraham and so they were looking to in inherit this Kingdom they believed that the that that inheritance was theirs to take it they believed it belonged to them because of their natural birth after all it was Father Abraham and Isaac and Jacob which became Israel they they came through the the the the the the genealogy of Abraham and so of course it would have to be Israel that would inherit this great Kingdom but when Paul would come and he would preach he would say it like this he said Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness he said but know therefore that they which are of the faith of Abraham the same are the children of Abraham see they and it shows us that they took the words that God spoke to Abraham and through all of the history of Israel they had misunderstood what God had said to Abraham remember what he said in Genesis 12 he said I will bless them that bless Thee I will curse them that curse thee and in the shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and until Paul preached it they believed that this natural uh lineage of Abraham and the law that they live by is what would bring the kingdom of God and it would it would it's what would bring an entrance it's what would bring the power of God upon the Earth and Israel would bless all nations and out of Israel would be this would be this great blessing upon the world it couldn't possibly be gentile people cuz after all they were heathens and dogs and but but it would have to be the Heirs of Abraham's seed but then when Paul would come and preach this is why this is why the Jews didn't like Paul is when Paul would come and preach he said but the scripture remember it was the angel of the Lord speaking through a Prophet by the name of Paul and bringing a revelation of what really was a CH a child of Abraham he said in the scripture for seeeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed so then they which are of the faith are blessed of faithful Abraham so in other words before God ever spoke these words to Abraham he saw that Faith Seed of Abraham in you and I now isn't that a wonderful thought to think about this morning that before God ever spoke to Abraham and said in thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed Paul said but he looked down through time and because God is an eternal God he saw the faith Seed of Abraham in the gentile people in other words he looked down into this building this morning and he saw the faith seat of Abraham in Brother David Gat he saw the faith seat of Abraham in brother Joel he saw that Faith seed in brother Mark he saw the faith seed in sister Tammy and brother Charles he saw that Faith Seed of Abraham in each and every one of us and the he and the Bible said because he saw that then because God is an eternal God oh my if you could just see it this morning before he ever wrote it before he ever spoke to Abraham he saw that in you and then he spoke to Abraham and he said Abraham get thee out of thy country and away from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and go to a land that I will show you and I will make of thee a great nation and in thee and I will bless thee and make thy name great and that will be a blessing and I will bless him that blesses thee and I will curse him that curses thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed oh my isn't it something to think that when God would make a promise to Abraham he was talking about the Seed of Abraham which is you and I this morning that's our Eternal God oh I don't know about you it makes me feel good this morning to think that my God would see me and he would ride all the way back before anybody ever thought about me thousands of years before we would ever exist but because God saw you and the faith seed that was in your heart he would speak to Abraham and said in thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed oh don't you realize that we stand today brother Mark as a faith seed of Our Father Abraham We Stand today as hes of the blessings of God we stand as HS of the promis of God we're HS of the kingdom of God and that blessing of God that is coming to the nations of the world how's it coming to the Nations it's coming through the faith Seed of Abraham what that's the only blessing that this world has on it is through the Bride of Jesus Christ you take the bride off of this world friends it ain't it'll be nothing but destruction you take the bride out of the world it'll come judgment it'll be destruction it'll be fire and brimstone that falls upon the world that's the only thing that's holding the wrath of God off of this Earth today is the presence of the Bride of Jesus Christ that possesses that Faith seed of Father Abraham there's coming a day when there won't be a building standing upon a building there's coming a day when God will unleash that six seal upon the Earth and destruction will strike the Earth and he'll let loose the wrath of God upon the Earth but the brother B said but you don't have to worry about it because the bride of Christ will be gone and the church may go through tribulation but the bride will be gone because his little wife will never go through that she's holding the the mercy of God over the Earth my the faith of God that's in you think about that little seed in you it's what's holding it it's the bride that is holding back the wrath of God and brother Mark as long as she's here there's still hope for a lost soul as long as she's here she's still crying for salvation as long as she's here she's still crying for Mercy but friends one day she'll be called away from this Earth to receive her inheritance and then judgment will strick the earth John Jesus said let not your heart be troubled for you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also I know this scripture has been Lost in Translation I I I read all kinds of translations of it this week that in my father's house are many mansions one version of the Bible says in my father's apartment are many or in my father's complex there are many apartments all these different versions that people write but I love a true interpretation of the word see in my father's house are many mansions in other words in my father's kingdom are many palaces in my father's Kingdom he said here in our father's Kingdom there's many great palaces and but in the in the message future home he said Christ is there under the construction of this New Jerusalem he said now listen close don't move and don't miss this but Christ is in heaven today preparing that New Jerusalem my don't that make you want to shout just as God created the Earth in six days he made remember what the Bible says he said a day is a thousand years unto God and a thousand years as a day and just as he spent six days or 6,000 years building the Earth he said there he is now building that New Jerusalem for the Bride of Jesus Christ I love how the prophet called him he said the one that is building it he is a Divine architect he's a Divine architect in other words he he is the one that is building it he is preparing it he's designed it and he designed it with his tender hands for his beloved bride you say well brother Matt what will it look like and how will it be can you imagine that this morning that Christ is there preparing that New Jerusalem here just as he created this world and as he spoke the world into existence and he created the earth and the atmosphere and the stars and the moon and all the the great things that God created that here Christ is standing today and creating that New Jerusalem that great City for you and I to inhabit I thought what a wonderful thought that it is that here a Divine architect is building this this place that we would inhabit said but what would it look like and how will it be well let me tell you brother Mark it'll be just the way you like it you say well how how is that because you know you think about an able man that gets married a man that was able if he when when he would get married if he has any sense about him he'll build a house for his bride the way she wants it to be see when you put the wrong color knobs on the cabinets she's going to come by and say I don't really like that color I like a different color and you know what the able man will do he'll go down to the hardware store and he'll pick out a the gold or or whatever's the end thing and he'll he'll put it in there and if she don't like if she don't like the black cabinets he'll go down the hardware store and he'll he'll get the white cabinets and if she don't you know she don't like that kind of carpet he'll he'll pick out a different kind of carpet because he's building a place to for her to inhabit because because he's able now I know some of us ain't able to do everything or our little brides want us to do but God is able you see and because he's an able husband brother marah he's preparing a place for you I love you know I love how brother BR said it he said he's designed this new city where he will live with his bride and he's designing it just to her touch the very thing that she would desire in her heart oh my to think that God he would build it and he he ain't just building it some way and say you just deal with it and you just like it and you'll just get over it he ain't that kind of a God he ain't that kind of a husband he said but he's building it just to her touch he's building this new city to the satisfaction oh God he's building it to the satisfaction of the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know about you but it does something to my heart this morning to think that I have a god somewhere the husband man Jesus Christ that is building in this New Jerusalem a place that would satisfy my my my place of habitation if the every desire of our heart let me tell you friends that he ain't holding one thing back he'll get the finest of gold and the finest Jasper and the finest jewels and the finest things that he can put in it to build it that you would be able to inhabit it no longer you ain't going to get there and find a bunch of broke down shelves and a and a broke down house and and drafts coming through the window and gone are the days of of shingles falling off of her roof I'm talking about a Divine architect that will build to Perfection to satisfaction of the Bride of Jesus Christ just to her touch he said he's a Divine architect he's designed it for his beloved oh what a place it must be when a divine nature of a Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute that he's been divinely predestinated by a Divine God who is an author of a Divine lie what a city that will be my what it will look like this morning to think that here he's putting he's putting this together just for you and I I know many put make it hard to believe but Joel they put it off in a in in another world somewhere they put it A Million Miles Away fting out on some clouds but you realize that the Bible don't even teach that is't that the way the y'all just get with me just a minute but you know how the B the the whole church World we're going to go off in a cloud and be in heaven but you realize that the Bible don't even teach that you're going to go to heaven for eternity and spend all this time in heaven that's not what the Bible said I'll tell you what the Bible said in Revelations 21 John saw John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth and the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and then John said and I saw a holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband he said see he saw it coming out of heaven so it ain't going to be in heaven it'll be on the earth he said I saw it coming out of the heaven and came down to the Earth and I heard with a great voice saying Out of Heaven behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and he will be their God and he will wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither there shall be any more pain for the former things are passed away so brother Jared we're not looking to spend eternity in heaven I'm looking to spend eternity on Earth it Ain and it ain't going to be this old this old Earth that's full of Filth and full of garbage it's in the but it'll be a new Earth cuz the old Earth will be passed away it'll be a redeemed Earth you you realize it's the Earth the one that God created you see you mean he'll throw it away and he'll make a new one no but what God will do with the Earth is the same thing he done with every one of us he'll redeem the Earth that he created in the beginning you realize that's what God does when God redeems you how did he do it by justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was it was God's that that's the way God redeems us it was by water remember we were baptized in water Sanctified by the blood of Jesus and then filled with the Holy Ghost to fire that's the same thing that took place on the earth in the days of Noah it went through a flood it was baptized in water when Jesus hung on the cross of Calvary the same blood that was shed for your sin it spilled upon the Earth and Sanctified it by the blood but then one day the Bible says there's coming a fire of God that will burn all the filth off of the earth it'll and then will come a new Heaven and a new Earth and upon that earth that is cleansed will come a city that was built by a Divine architect a New Jerusalem that will set down upon this Earth that the Bride of Jesus Christ will inhabit forever and ever Oh Glory I feel religious this morning to think that God a Divine architect is making a place for you and I oh friend isn't it wonderful to think that to be in Heavenly places with Christ but I'm marked to think that God would come down and dwell and dwell with man and build a city upon this earth oh I can't wait for the day I long to be there as John said I saw heaven I I open up and the City come down and set down upon this Earth I long to be there with our loved ones being in that city of God he said he ain't going to make a new world it's the one right here he'll just burn it off and cleanse it just like he did you the same Earth it'll be cleansed over just like he let me tell you friends God isn't looking for a new Earth he'll take the same one he created it and he'll cleanse it again and he'll use it for his glory and that's the way God does with every one of us God ain't looking for a new people he ain't looking for a better class he ain't looking for somebody that's more worthy he ain't looking for somebody that has less problems God don't throw people away he'll take he he he's a Potter and he'll take the clay and he'll mold it and he'll make it again God that's what people do people throw people away but God don't throw people away he ain't looking for better people that he can use he still wants to use you he ain't looking for somebody that's more qualified that he can use brother Mar but God uses us he said see he don't throw us away he ain't trying to get rid of us it's our God and he wants to use us remember when Jeremiah G I may as well just preach it I said it but remember when Jeremiah went down and he saw the destruction that was coming upon Israel and he went he saw that the Judgment of God was so great that he would didn't even want to be present when the Judgment came he said oh God let me go somewhere else I I don't even want to present what what great judgment God was going to bring the wrath of God upon this place oh God can you have mercy upon these people and God said Jeremiah go down to The Potter's House I have a message for you and he went down to the house of the Potter he said when I saw the Potter he said he had a lump of clay and when he made a vessel out of it it wasn't pleasing to the Potter he said so the the the vessel was marred in his hands he said then the Potter he took the ve the the clay and he mushed it back down again and he began to mold again and made another vessel that seemed good to the Potter to make it and the Lord spoke to him he said like the clay is in the hand of the Potter so are you in my hand see God don't throw you away he don't he he ain't throwing away his creation he's not throwing you away to get somebody better God wants you hello somebody God wants you you say full all my problems God Wants You full of all my mistakes God Wants You full of all my past God wants you I'm mared so was the so is the clay in the hand of the Potter he said but as the clay was in the hands of the Potter so are you in my hands he'll mold you and make you what he wants you to be but said he ain't going to raise up a new generation he'll redeem the one that's already here he ain't looking for a better Earth of better people he's looking to remake the one that's here he said if I go and prepare a place for you then I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also what a story this morning the Redeemer and the redeemed back together again what a love story this is that he would go it's what the Song of Solomon was writing about remember Solomon he saw one that was fair all all those that that he could have as a as this great king but he saw one that was fair and remember when he wrote about her he said I am my beloved and my beloved is mine oh you are so beautiful oh my love turn away thine eyes from me for your eyes have overcame me me he was so he was so in love and and how that he would look at her and long and and all the all the song that he wrote about her how how fair your hair and all in your skin and your eyes and every everything about you he wrote how much he loved her and how how how wonderful that she was and and how love what a love story it is but said what was it it was the way that Christ looks at the bride here he adores you he gives life for but you realize that whenever Solomon was longing for her here she was she was already she was she was engaged or or or or or or to be with with with the shepherd boy remember Solon looked at him he said but but but he desired her and here she was already spoken for he said see that's the way it was that's the way it was when whenever whenever Satan came and he and he had you and he had and he had you in his grasp but whenever Christ looked at you he longed for you and he had a desire for you and he wanted to make a way that that that that old husband that that old one couldn't have no part of you but he wanted to make a way he said what was happening he said that Solomon he he said here he was called to inherit the kingdom of David or Kingdom of Israel but he couldn't inherit it while that David was on the throne and so that Kingdom had to pass away in order for Solomon to come into His Place said see and that's what Christ was waiting for you see he was waiting for the time that he could come and take his bride and could catch her away that she wouldn't be wouldn't be tormented by that that by the old devil and he wouldn't be pulled by the devil again but but he but he would look at her and he would long for her and he loved you don't you realize that's a relationship ship that God has with you that he loves you and he and he adores you and he Lo he loves to to have communion with you he he loves to have fellowship with you this morning that's the desire that God he loves you so much that he gave his life for you he adores you and you know what she adors him she Ador him when she looks at him that's what worship is she looks at him and she loves him back brother Mark it's an act of worship that's what we do when we come to church and we worship God you realize worship is is a reverence or an adoration it's a it's a way to it's an act of love that you have with God it's the way that you love God so when we come to church to worship God we worship him because we love him don't you see it it's not it's not because somebody tells you to to worship and somebody tells you to to come to church we worship because we love him do you realize that God being a god of love he don't command anybody to worship him he ain't coming here to demand you and make you worship and make you come to church that's what men do that God don't do that he ain't commanding you to worship what good would worship be if it had to be commanded out of you I may as well preach it he don't he don't command you to live for him he but he instructs Us in his word and if you have a desire in your nature to worship God then you will worship God because he instruct us to do it in his word God loves worship but he don't love making you do it he loves it whenever we we lift our hands he loves it when we praise God he loves it when you sing songs he loves it when you sing that song I love him because he first loved me but he ain't going to make you do it he wants you to do it from your heart God wants you to have a desire to worship God he wants to he wants to love you so much that you loving back he wants to give you so much that you want to give back he wants to feel you so much that you want to just give all that you have unto him he wants you to adore him and to love him and to rever him God wants you to worship Him in truth and in spirit said he don't demand it God ain't that way he don't demand it and say worship me or else serve me or else live for me or else sanctify or else that ain't the kind of God that we serve God don't demand it and that ain't our place as ministers think about as a pastor it's not my place to demand that you worship God it ain't my place to demand that you live right and demand that you live in holess and demand that you don't go out cutting your hair and wearing and jeans and all these things and men dressing like women and women dressing like men and and people making up like Jezebel like women do today or men do today but it ain't but but it ain't my place to demand that you live a life of Holiness but I come to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ this is what Paul preached he said I beseech you Brethren I say let's preach it like Paul did he said I beseech you Brethren by the mercy of God present your body a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God it is your reasonable service beseech it means to call or to summon or to encourage or to instruct or to teach so Paul said I beseech you in other words I'll instruct you in the ways of God I come to teach you the ways of God I come to encourage you to go to church I come to encourage you to worship God I come to encourage you to be a part of assembly and come and give your time and sacrifice to God and worship him but nobody demands it of you and when you come to church nobody demands that you worship God but let me tell you what you will see is whenever any time that I have the ability and the church doors are open you'll find me in the house of God because I love him I adore him I want to worship Him why because he first loved me I want to give all that I have unto him because he gave all that he had to me I love him I adore him I want to worship him so when I come to church I nobody had to make me worship God but I worship God you'll find me worshiping my maker my Creator the god that loves me my Christ the Divine architect that is creating a place that we can live together eternally I worship him because I love him he don't make you do it he just encourages you instruct you in the word of God but Mark that there'd be a desire in our heart isn't that the way God sees it to instruct you that there would be a desire in your heart to want to serve him can you imagine having a wife that you had to force to be a wife what a miserable marriage it would be you had to force to be a wife Force to to do and force you know what what a misery it would be but when you can serve one another because you love one another might a need a better relationship that's what God's looking for he said I'll love her first he didn't even wait on you to make the first move he said I'll love her first then she'll love me back I'll give her everything I have that's how you win her heart I'll just give her everything I have I'll go out on a limb I'll be embarrassed I I'll be the Laughing stalk if I have to be but I want her to know that I love her that's what Christ done he went and he took the bore the reproach of our sin remember when they they threw the the Harlot at at his feet that day that little ill Fame woman that was caught in the act and they brought and threw her down at his feet he bore the reproach and said there ain't no when when when they all left he said your accusers are gone and neither do I accuse thee go and sin no more he B bore the reproach when he was sitting in in in the in the the rich man's house and they they failed to wash his feet and here that little woman came down and and she knelt down at his feet and she begin to wash his feet and wipe them with her hair and here they say you know that woman's an ill- Fame woman how could you sit there in the presence of a woman like that but but but but but he bore the reproach of her he said because I came into this house and nobody would wash my feet but she was willing to wash them he bore our reproach he bore our our ill- famed and he bore our our sins and our our wrongdoings and our mistakes that we could take on the name of Jesus Christ that we could call oursel a Christian and the critic and the persecutor would come by and say why you ain't no such a thing but he bore our reproach that we could take on his name the reproach of our sin that we wouldn't even have to pay for it isn't that a God no wonder we worship God no wonder we adore him we love him because he first love us he don't make us do it brother Mark he don't force force us to worship him but when we come to we come to the house of God we come to worship God I'm going to be here and I'm going to worship him because I love him you know why because there's something in me that desires to offer a spiritual sacrifice unto God you realize that the old Testament it was the priesthood that offered sacrifices and had they' go out and they would be a Sanctified priest and they would lay down upon the Altar and they would sanctify the altar they would offer sacrifices unto him but then the prophet would say but there's coming a day remember when he prophesied there's coming a day there there will be another priesthood a priest that will come after the order of MDC and then then when this priest would come he would usher in a new priesthood brother the Jared in other words here he would come it would be an eternal priesthood he would be after the order of MEC he have no beginning of days and no no ending of nights remember when he came to Abraham after after the after the battle and it was mecdc that came unto him and he feasted with him and had had fellowship and had communion with him and the Bible said he he had no beginning days had no father and no mother it was none other than God himself in human flesh said but there cometh a priest in the end time or there cometh a priest that will come after the order of mezc and here when Christ came brother Mark he came as a high priest the Bible said he could even be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but after him not only did he come as a priest but he ushered in a new priesthood that every one of us that would come under or come into Christ would be a part of that priesthood this morning so here we are a royal priesthood Paul the Bible said you're Kings and you're priests unto God we're priests unto him and able to make sacrifices unto God a priest after the order of mecdc we're an eternal priesthood oh my is it something to be in that order this morning we come after the order of an eternal priesthood and we're sitting in the house of God and and giving worship unto him as a priest ought to see it's a a real priesthood it always acts the same way remember when he was here on Earth notice how he done and that you say well all the things that he done he'll do the same thing today if it's the same priesthood but remember said if he's the same high priest he'll act the same way today he said but he don't have he can't come here in his Corporal body on Earth but he's only here in his bride and he works through that it is man it was God in Elijah it was God in David it was God in Christ and now it's God in his body upon the Earth you say what is it it's that same royal priesthood on the Earth today he said well you said well brother M that was just a prophet that he would come but brother manam said this he said no matter how much he would anoint me he's got to anoint you too see so God would call an anointed people he anointed a five-fold Ministry to preach the gospel but he anointed a people to believe it and it takes those that are anointed in order to be Believers you had to be anointed to believe God God anointing to be able to serve God and to worship God it takes an anointing of God he say see so he would have to anoint me but he's got to anoint you too I don't know about you but I thank God that I can be a part of an anointed people of God you've anointed blessed are your ears for they hear blessed are your eyes for they see we be been Anointed with isav in this hour that we could see the things of God and the ways of God and the desires of God and the true sacrifice and worship unto God to inherit the kingdom of God said he come to give it to you in the days of his Earthly Ministry when Jesus came I'm I'm I'm going close just a minute but when Jesus came you realize that there was many unbelievers in his presence brother Morgan remember whenever he came the Bible said he was so astonished at their unbelief that he walked away and he left them at their unbelief remember when he went to capernium he said capernium you've got so much unbelief the things that Jes Jesus could have done in their midst but couldn't do because of their unbelief a't that the way it is today you say brother man I want to see a move of God believe it I want to see a Revival believe it I want to see healing for my brother my sister believe it said many things he could not do because of their unbelief see that's why the world has taken this this priesthood and said Well it has to be a thing of the past because the same work isn't done in our assembly he said but if if it's a priesthood before and he done that kind of a work work if it's the same priesthood he'll still do the same kind of work today but the difference is is our unbelief so we come as a body of Believers this morning he said he left them left capernium because they unbelief can you imagine they could have been healed but because their unbelief they could have been they could have received the Holy Ghost but because of their unbelief they could be saved but because their unbelief they could have seen a move of God but because their unbelief they could have gone years without living in depression but because of their unbelief my friends I've got got news for you this morning this ain't capernium Hallelujah this ain't capernium but a Mark it's a body of Believers we're not capernium he don't have to walk out of our midst astonished and saying I could have done a work in their midst but because of their unbelief I couldn't I couldn't do anything but I thank God that it ain't capernium this morning but we're a body of Believers and we believe in the Supernatural and we believe in the power of God we believe in Divine Healing I believe in the work of God I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe in spiritual worship we believe it that it ain't in vain but I believe what the Bible said when when David wrote he said Oh Holy One you are they you are he that inhabits the Praises of Israel I thank God that we are a body of Believers that believe that God inhabits the Praises of his people he will dwell amongst them he will dwell in them the temple that God has made in this hour and they will inherit the kingdom of God oh he said I will declare my name thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee you that fear the Lord praise him all ye the seed of Jacob glorify him fear Him all ye seed of Israel for he hath not despised or abhor the Affliction of The Afflicted neither has he hid his face from him but when We Cried unto him he heard no wonder we adore him we worship Him brother Mark we come to the house of God we come to receive our inheritance we don't come we never we never come brother Morgan just to to take up a time or another service but we come to receive our inheritance from God say see he's bringing this great Kingdom he'll set it down upon the Earth said but even now we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus how many can say Amen as you stand to your feet this morning I'm going to let you go early but we come to worship God we come to adore him we come to love him we Revere we we rever him because he first loved us there's such a reverence in our heart we approach him that way you realize when we come in the house of God we don't it ain't no games to us we don't play around in the sanctuary and talk to one another and goof off and eat candy and chew gum and all those things we talk on the cell phones we don't we don't do that in the house of God we have reverence for the house of God why because we reverence him isn't it something you can go to a courtroom it's sad to say but a courtroom has more reverence than most churches in this world today the laws of men has more reverence they got rules on the door when you come in here take your hat off turn your cell phone off don't bring no food don't be chewing bubblegum we're coming in here to hear the Judgment of the of the judge but then we come in the house of God and have no reverence for the spirit of God or the house of God but God called us this is the teaching of the word come with reverence we come to adore him we don't come to walking with hobnail shoes Where Angels Fear to trod but we come with reverence I always thought it was a paradox of how a Believer was called to approach God the Bible says in one place this as we approach the throne of Mercy with reverence we come but then in another place it says we approach him with boldness isn't that something that you could have reverence and boldness at the same time it's because the boldness isn't Pride the boldness is that I have confidence in the sacrifice that has gone before me I have confidence in the in the way that is paid in the entrance that has been made into the Kingdom so whenever I come in I I can come in boldly but with reverence in other words I come in with reverence but I know I belong here I know I've got my place at the Throne of God I know I have my place in the kingdom of God and God has called us but Mark is calling us in this hour to take a hold of our inheritance you realize that this world has a lot to offer if you have a rich daddy and he pass away and leave you an inheritance say well I'm waiting to receive my inheritance it's got a lot to it's got a lot to offer Satan would offer you all kinds of
