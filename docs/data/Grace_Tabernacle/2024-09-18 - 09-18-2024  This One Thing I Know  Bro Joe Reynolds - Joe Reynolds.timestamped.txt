[43:17] amen now it says now Faith is the
[43:20] substance of things hoped for the
[43:22] evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[43:25] Elders obtained a good rep report
[43:27] through faith we understand the worlds
[43:29] were framed by the word of God so that
[43:31] things which are seen were not made of
[43:33] things which do appear by faith Abel
[43:36] offered unto God a more excellent
[43:38] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[43:40] a witness that he was righteous God
[43:42] testifying of his gifts and by his being
[43:44] dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was
[43:48] translated that he should not see death
[43:50] and was not found because God translated
[43:52] him for before the translation he had
[43:55] his this testimony that he please God
[43:58] but without faith it is impossible to
[44:00] please him for he that come to God must
[44:03] believe that he is and that is a
[44:05] rewarder of them that disly seeks him by
[44:09] faith Noah being warned of God these
[44:11] things not as yet moved with fear
[44:13] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[44:16] house by which they condemn the world
[44:18] and became an heir of the righteousness
[44:20] which is by Faith by faith Abraham when
[44:23] he was called to go out into a place
[44:25] where he should have to receed for an
[44:27] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[44:30] knowing where he went by faith he
[44:32] sojourned in a Land Of Promise in a
[44:35] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[44:37] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[44:40] of the same promise for he looked for a
[44:43] city which Foundation whose Builder and
[44:46] maker is God hallelujah can we just bow

[45:10] the circumstances of Life Lord Lord I

[45:45] in this side of glory Lord we pray L God
[45:48] that you'll take these few scriptures
[45:50] and quotes tonight Lord God and edify
[45:53] your Believers here tonight we pray in
[45:55] Jesus Christ one wonderful name and the
[45:58] bride says amen God bless you you can
[46:01] have your seats this
[46:04] evening last time we was here with you
[46:07] we uh we ministered on the lines of um
[46:10] the contents of his will and we've got
[46:13] to a few things tonight we'd like to get
[46:16] to along those same lines tonight but if
[46:19] we had a title tonight we call this one
[46:21] thing I know and we was looking here and
[46:23] I was thinking about how that uh many
[46:26] times I was hearing the prophet of God
[46:28] today I was reading where he was talking
[46:30] about Peter and how that they got it all
[46:32] wrong and how they said it it was a
[46:34] built upon a man or built a tabernacle
[46:37] for Peter and but Brother P said it
[46:40] wasn't that at all it was actually a
[46:42] revelation that he received not from
[46:44] flesh and blood but from his heavenly
[46:46] father and he also went on to say the
[46:49] scripture says also that you know the
[46:51] gates of hell is going to be against it
[46:53] but it can never Prevail against it amen
[46:56] that should make it excited tonight amen
[46:58] that we can have a revelation by faith
[47:00] tonight that hell just don't know what
[47:03] to do with us amen don't you believe
[47:05] that and brother B would say it like
[47:07] this the importance of Revelation by the
[47:09] spirit to a True Believer can never be
[47:13] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[47:16] you than perhaps you realize he said the
[47:20] church is built on a
[47:22] revelation on thus sayeth the Lord
[47:27] it's a Lord's battle if God be for us
[47:31] who can be against us how did he said
[47:34] how did Abel know what to do in order to
[47:37] offer a proper sacrifice to God he said
[47:40] it was by faith he received the
[47:43] revelation of the blood and Cain didn't
[47:46] get such a revelation even though he had
[47:49] the Commandment he had the letter so he
[47:52] couldn't offer the right the sacrifice
[47:56] it was a re reation from God that made
[47:59] the difference and gave Abel eternal
[48:02] life so what made the difference was not
[48:05] a letter not a Bible not a word but fact
[48:08] of the matter is it was a revelation
[48:11] that was given by the father that made
[48:13] the difference and gave Abel eternal
[48:16] life and he goes on and said Cain was
[48:18] just as religious as Abel was they both
[48:21] built altars they both loved God they
[48:24] both was religious they both off up
[48:27] sacrifices they both
[48:29] worship they both pay ties Brother David
[48:33] they done they both done everything just
[48:36] alike but Able by faith which is the
[48:40] Revelation he listen to this he says the
[48:42] word of God revealed made plain showed
[48:45] out Vindicated he says Glory Cain made
[48:50] an offering but God didn't vindicate it
[48:54] God didn't accept Cain's worship
[48:58] brother Joey couldn't accept Cain's
[49:01] sacrifice but yet he worshiped yet he
[49:05] came to church yet he paid
[49:09] ties yet he followed a letter and
[49:13] brother Rand no doubt his sacrifice was
[49:16] beautiful to the eyes of the men and
[49:18] women that was around other the churches
[49:21] and no doubt they would pick his
[49:23] sacrifice over Abel's 10 out of 10 times
[49:28] but the difference was amen didn't have
[49:31] didn't matter how beautiful the
[49:33] sacrifice was it was a it was according
[49:37] to the purpose and the will of almighty
[49:39] God and God revealed unto Abel that it
[49:44] was a bloody
[49:45] mess and no doubt to the Mind sister
[49:48] Sandy of Abel no doubt he questioned
[49:52] himself M he maybe looked over at Cain's
[49:55] worship and how that it was just
[49:57] beautiful with flowers and Greenery and
[50:01] my how everybody maybe was ooing and
[50:03] aing over such a sacrifice but he
[50:06] bypassed his flesh he bypassed his
[50:09] feelings he bypass what the church
[50:11] thought Heen he had a divine revelation
[50:15] of the will of God and he went out and
[50:18] he began to make preparation for
[50:21] fulfilling
[50:22] amen amen he went out and got a got a
[50:26] had a sacrifice and begin to brother B
[50:29] would tell you he took old sharp Rock
[50:31] and he begin to uh begin to beat against
[50:34] the neck of that that
[50:36] lamb my the world was calling fanaticism
[50:40] the world was making fun of his worship
[50:42] the world was telling him they're losing
[50:44] the he's lost his mind but he kept on
[50:47] hacking at the sacrifice and blood begin
[50:50] to drain off of that sacrifice upon the
[50:53] altar but you know what Papa was looking
[50:56] down from the heavens looking down upon
[50:58] that sacrifice if he could say it like
[51:01] this this is my son this is my boy amen
[51:05] it was pleasing the father that he that
[51:08] he applied the blood upon the
[51:12] altar Hallelujah a but Abra Abel's was
[51:17] by
[51:18] Revelation and it stimulated him it's
[51:22] stimulated he was stimulated by
[51:24] Revelation and though his worship it
[51:27] become true could you imagine Abel when
[51:31] he if you'll give me a few moments
[51:33] tonight when you can imagine Abel as he
[51:35] begins to beat against the neck of that
[51:39] innocent lamb amen he became one with a
[51:42] sacrifice he be to
[51:45] worship he didn't care who's around him
[51:48] he didn't care who's at church he didn't
[51:50] care what people thought about him Heen
[51:53] he didn't care if they made fun of him
[51:55] because he worshiped he made fun of him
[51:57] because he danced he it didn't it didn't
[51:59] matter to him why he was in he was such
[52:03] in tune with
[52:06] worship oh Church we're not looking for
[52:09] some f fanaticism around the message but
[52:11] we are looking for some true worshippers
[52:14] that come to worship the father in
[52:16] spirit and in
[52:18] truth
[52:21] hallelujah then he goes on but God
[52:23] didn't vindicate it he couldn't
[52:26] vindicate at it didn't matter how
[52:28] beautiful it was he could never
[52:29] vindicate it but how to the world how
[52:33] ugly this sacrifice but God comes down
[52:36] and vindicates
[52:38] it and the scripture said by
[52:41] faith Abel offered up the Sacrifice by
[52:46] faith which is revelation can I go on he
[52:50] said now as a old symbolize the Holy
[52:54] Spirit then we find out the old and
[52:56] Wine's connected to worship it's always
[52:59] connected to worship he said then the
[53:01] wine I said which come to me the wine
[53:03] symbolizes was a power it was a power of
[53:07] stimulation by Revelation and that's
[53:10] when something has been revealed it
[53:13] gives a stimulation to the believer
[53:17] because it's presented by Revelation
[53:20] it's something that God has said it's a
[53:23] mystery they can't understand it Cain
[53:26] couldn't understand it is a mystery
[53:29] remember we last time we was with you we
[53:31] was ministering on the contents of the
[53:33] wheel and we dealt with that for a
[53:35] moment how that that that yesterday is
[53:39] no longer a
[53:40] mystery tomorrow is a mystery to us hey
[53:44] but but after tomorrow comes yesterday
[53:46] it's no longer a mystery you're living
[53:49] it it was a mystery to the world but not
[53:53] to
[53:54] Able and he says they can't understand
[53:57] it after a while God comes down and
[54:00] reveals it and vindicates it so we're
[54:04] not living under a mystery any longer
[54:06] we're living it see he says and you
[54:11] cannot know until you have faith and
[54:15] Faith produces the no so faith is the
[54:21] No No so he says is
[54:25] faith just like job he said job he he
[54:29] Satan was poking everything at him to
[54:32] get him to curse his God how many felt
[54:34] like they've been there time and two in
[54:35] your life amen everything was going
[54:38] wrong in job's life amen his Runners was
[54:41] telling him you're losing this job you
[54:42] lost this job job you lost your
[54:45] children amen job was broken down in
[54:48] Bulls all over his body blood dripping
[54:51] off his
[54:55] elbows but was happening around job
[54:58] wasn't affecting what was going on the
[55:00] inside of the inside Satan was poking
[55:04] everything he could but remember God
[55:06] said that you can do anything to him but
[55:08] you can't take his life amen but he knew
[55:11] the Integrity of job's heart and he
[55:15] spoke these words in his dep in his
[55:19] situation with all hell is fall uh
[55:22] coming down upon him every demonic power
[55:25] of hell is tormenting job to a place his
[55:28] wife said job why don't you curse God
[55:31] and
[55:32] die but job in his in his distress his
[55:37] sickness and all the things that was
[55:40] happening around job job finds himself
[55:43] brother Brown said coming to the edge of
[55:45] the window looking out out the window
[55:48] into God's universe and he begins to see
[55:51] the Trees of
[55:52] blooming he sees the leaves green leaves
[55:55] of life springing up in the trees he
[55:58] sees the the grass growing he sees the
[56:01] wind blowing through the flowers of and

[56:37] we preached last time AB was a
[56:40] condescending of God he was God above
[56:43] us he was God With Us in Jesus
[56:47] Christ but he condescended down in the
[56:50] form of the Holy Spirit to become the
[56:53] executor of his own will to come down
[56:56] and live and be trapped in humanity
[56:59] sealed to the day of your
[57:01] Redemption and you're only here

[57:07] else and you're here doing it because

[1:12:57] way Faith looks and sees what God

[1:28:47] just a prayer Warrior I'm just a youth
[1:28:49] leader I'm just a song leader I'm just
[1:28:51] an evangelist I'm just a deacon Church
[1:28:54] St lay
[1:28:56] member but one thing I
[1:28:58] know if God before me who can be against

[1:29:07] Revelation he said you a't have time to
[1:29:09] get train he just grabbed whatever he
[1:29:12] could he grabbed an old Ox
[1:29:16] go and brother Brown said claim your
[1:29:19] god-given
[1:29:20] privilege and beat their heads in amen
[1:29:24] thank you
[1:29:26] Lord get out of the way Satan kick him
[1:29:29] out of the way I'm the guy that's taking
[1:29:32] over now I come in Jesus name watch him
[1:29:36] scatter brother when you use that faith
[1:29:38] on him he will back down he will back up
[1:29:42] one thing I know little by little we're
[1:29:45] going to drive him
[1:29:47] out little by little shamgar drove him
[1:29:50] out and it so got stimulated
[1:29:54] that he began to act
[1:29:57] unseemly and he jumped out of the window
[1:30:00] and he tucked down to the enemy's
[1:30:03] gate amen and when depression came up he
[1:30:07] began to hit their heads with a little
[1:30:11] stick and a Little Rock tied to the end

[1:30:22] began and brother BR said when he struck
[1:30:24] just like he said when Moses took the
[1:30:26] rod it was no longer Moses striking he
[1:30:30] said but it was God striking and I feel
[1:30:33] that's just the way it is with you as a
[1:30:35] Believer amen when you take God at his
[1:30:38] word and he said brother B would take it

[1:30:44] hand shamgar what do you got in your
[1:30:46] hand little BR it doesn't take
[1:30:49] much it takes faith and Revelation and
[1:30:54] stimulation to be Vindicated and allow

[1:30:59] word brother Brown said when he strugg

[1:31:53] more is my five minutes
[1:31:56] up I had an amen and a no I don't know
[1:31:58] how to take
[1:32:02] that let's turn to my other favorite
[1:32:04] scripture 1st Samuel
[1:32:07] 17
[1:32:09] 32 we'll close on this because I got a
[1:32:11] couple quotes I'd like to read with
[1:32:14] this it said David said unto Saul let no
[1:32:18] man's heart fail because of him thy
[1:32:21] servant will go fight with the
[1:32:23] philistine
[1:32:24] and Saul said to David thou not not able
[1:32:26] to go against him Philistine to fight
[1:32:28] with him for thou art but a youth and he
[1:32:31] a man of war from his Youth and David
[1:32:34] said to Saul thy servant kept his father
[1:32:36] sheep and there came a lion and a bear
[1:32:39] and he took a lamb out of the flock and
[1:32:41] he went out after him I smoted him I
[1:32:44] delivered him out of his mouth and when
[1:32:47] he rose against me I caught him by his
[1:32:49] beard and smote him and slew him thy
[1:32:50] servant slew both The Lion and the bear
[1:32:53] and this uncircumcised for this thing
[1:32:55] shall be as one of them see he has the
[1:32:58] file of the armies of a living God I say
[1:33:00] the Devils have done that
[1:33:03] today and the devil said moreover the
[1:33:05] Lord that delivered me out of the pa the
[1:33:07] lion and out of the pa the bear will
[1:33:09] deliver me out of the of the hand of the
[1:33:11] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:33:13] and the Lord be with thee and Saul
[1:33:16] armored David with his armor and put a
[1:33:18] helmet of brass upon his head and he
[1:33:20] armed him with a coat of mail and David
[1:33:23] GED his sword upon his armor and and say
[1:33:25] to go for it has not been proved it
[1:33:28] David said to sa I cannot go with this
[1:33:31] for I have not proved them and David put
[1:33:34] them off and he tuck his staff in his
[1:33:36] hand and chose him five smooth stones
[1:33:39] out of the
[1:33:40] brook and he put it in his Shepherd's
[1:33:43] bag brother Brown said had honey in it
[1:33:48] my and he said God down there and even
[1:33:51] in his scrip and his sling was in his
[1:33:53] hand and he drew nigh unto the
[1:33:55] Philistine and the Philistine came and
[1:33:58] Drew nigh un David and the man that bore
[1:34:00] his shield went before him when the
[1:34:02] Philistine looked about and saw David
[1:34:04] and disdained him for he was yet a youth
[1:34:06] and Ruddy and a fair countenance and
[1:34:09] Philistine said unto David am I a dog
[1:34:12] that thou comest me with th and
[1:34:13] Philistine cursed th David by his gods
[1:34:17] and fisting said to David come to me
[1:34:19] I'll give thy flesh and the fowls of the
[1:34:22] air and the Beast of the field he was
[1:34:24] only
[1:34:26] hoping then said David to philistin thou
[1:34:29] comest to me with a sword and with a
[1:34:32] spear with a sword but I come to thee in
[1:34:35] the name of the Lord of hosts the god of
[1:34:37] the armies of Israel who thou has
[1:34:41] defiled and brother B said hang on I'll
[1:34:43] come back to that scripture he said and
[1:34:45] Little David standing there with a
[1:34:47] little piece of leather and goat stand a
[1:34:49] sheep skin with two pieces of string
[1:34:50] tided it but it was revealed to
[1:34:55] him Revelation struck him the god that
[1:34:59] tuck me out of the paws of the bear took
[1:35:02] me out of the paws of Lyon how much more
[1:35:05] would deliver this uncircum Philistine
[1:35:07] in my hand his brothers War way more
[1:35:10] able to do it Saul was Head and
[1:35:12] Shoulders above him but you see it
[1:35:14] wasn't revealed to them he said there it
[1:35:18] is they believed it could be done they
[1:35:20] believed that God could do it but it
[1:35:22] wasn't revealed to them but it was
[1:35:24] revealed to Little
[1:35:26] David now there's the
[1:35:29] difference Hallelujah Saul had more
[1:35:31] military Saul was a lot bigger his army
[1:35:35] was greater but it wasn't revealed to
[1:35:39] him David was a little
[1:35:45] fella brother said may walk five foot
[1:35:48] something little Ruddy shrimp of a guy
[1:35:51] couldn't fight his way out of wet paper
[1:35:55] bag Goliath was a had a head like a war
[1:35:59] tub big huge giant that's never lost a
[1:36:02] battle never tasted
[1:36:06] defeat every time he made a boast he was
[1:36:09] able to back it
[1:36:10] up but he came in contact with God's
[1:36:16] anointing Hallelujah don't do them no
[1:36:19] harm amen and when he begin to burst
[1:36:22] about Bo about the what he was going to
[1:36:25] do with David amen David's response was
[1:36:29] quick you come to me with a sword in the
[1:36:32] spear you come to me with hope but I
[1:36:35] come with you by by
[1:36:37] Revelation by
[1:36:38] Vindication he's already delivered a
[1:36:41] lamb out of the mouth of a lion by my
[1:36:44] bare hands I know he's a true God and my
[1:36:48] God Is Bigger my God Is Bigger
[1:36:53] come on
[1:36:59] Hallelujah he said but you see it wasn't
[1:37:01] revealed to them amen there it
[1:37:04] is but it was revealed to
[1:37:07] David he said if it's absolutely
[1:37:09] revealed to you that God is going to
[1:37:12] heal you you're going to get
[1:37:14] it you're going to get it he said I
[1:37:16] don't care what's wrong with you what
[1:37:18] the odds is it may be worse than David
[1:37:20] Goliath but if it's revealed to you
[1:37:22] notice when when it's revealed David
[1:37:25] become
[1:37:28] Fearless when it was revealed David
[1:37:31] become Fearless he said today I'll cut
[1:37:34] your head off Hallelujah and Har he went
[1:37:38] up there just dancing in the
[1:37:42] spirit as hard as he could why he said
[1:37:46] by faith he saw the
[1:37:50] victory Goliath was still standing there
[1:37:53] but by faith we see the victory tonight
[1:37:56] I say your Mountain sister Vanna may be
[1:37:59] still standing there but I know one
[1:38:02] thing my God is bigger than your
[1:38:06] mountain and if you will just seek it by
[1:38:14] Revelation then you might that thing
[1:38:17] might have been getting the best of for
[1:38:19] a long
[1:38:20] time but now you can become Fearless
[1:38:32] goad vict now you can go ahead and dance
[1:38:35] that's what David the scripture said
[1:38:38] David R to the
[1:38:41] battle sa of them was running they was
[1:38:44] cowards they went back to Camp they was
[1:38:48] afraid but the anointed the anointed of
[1:38:51] David he was stimulated ated amen he was
[1:38:56] energized he was faithful he believed he
[1:38:59] already saw the victory he already seen
[1:39:02] Goliath laying on the ground
[1:39:06] defeated that's what Revelation is aen
[1:39:09] it's hard it's it stimulates you to see
[1:39:12] something amen that your natural flesh
[1:39:15] can't see but Faith declare it's already
[1:39:18] done the battle is over and the victory
[1:39:22] has been won
[1:39:24] so you can imagine David's mentality
[1:39:27] when he was walking down there and he
[1:39:29] reached down at O Creek bed and picked
[1:39:32] up those five stones and he put them in
[1:39:35] the shepherd
[1:39:37] bag and he begin to
[1:39:40] run he begin to run down to the enemy's
[1:39:46] Camp he said this day will can you say
[1:39:50] will the Lord deliver thee into my hand
[1:39:55] I will smite thee I'll take the head
[1:39:57] from thee I'll give the carcass of the
[1:39:59] host of the Philistines this day unto
[1:40:02] the fowls of the air and the wild beasts
[1:40:04] of the earth that all the Earth may know
[1:40:07] there is a God of Israel and all the s
[1:40:10] should know the Lord savior not with a
[1:40:13] sword and a spear for the battle is the
[1:40:16] Lord he will give you into my
[1:40:21] hands what victory
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:28] what big old Goliath still standing
[1:40:30] there he's got his sword and Spears and
[1:40:33] Shields and armor
[1:40:35] and the fact of the matter is brother
[1:40:38] Vernon he only had one spot
[1:40:42] open and David within himself couldn't
[1:40:45] hit
[1:40:46] it and fearless David ran towards
[1:40:51] Goliath
[1:40:54] can I go ahead and read it it came to
[1:40:56] pass when the philistin arose let that
[1:40:58] devil raise his head again tonight and

[1:41:11] Believers in the building tonight he got
[1:41:14] stimulated at
[1:41:16] haston and ran toward the Army to meet
[1:41:21] the philistine
[1:41:25] and
[1:41:26] David put his
[1:41:29] hand David put his hand in his script
[1:41:35] back and he took out a
[1:41:37] stone and he put it in two little
[1:41:41] straps brother Bobby and he began

[1:43:41] ground and he hit and maybe it shook the
[1:43:45] whole Camp of
[1:43:47] Israel and every one of them was looking
[1:43:49] out and seeing what God was doing
[1:43:53] and David continue to
[1:43:57] run now we're finding a Gody that not
