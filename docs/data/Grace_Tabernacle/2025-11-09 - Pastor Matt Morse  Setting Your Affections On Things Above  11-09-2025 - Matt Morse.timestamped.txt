[29:15] God changed.
[29:18] He's a change.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's [music] all stand. Take that
[29:21] second verse again. Now,
[29:25] &gt;&gt; we've all searched [music] for the light
[29:27] of day in the dead of night.
[29:31] We've all found ourselves [music]
[29:33] worn out from the same old fight.
[29:38] We've all run [music] to things
[29:40] [singing] we know just a
[29:43] better [music] life out there. There's a
[29:44] better life. He's here to offer it to

[30:11] You got
[30:14] He's a [music] chain breaker. Oh,
[30:16] &gt;&gt; if you believe it this morning,
[30:19] if you believe it,
[30:22] if you receive it,
[30:26] if you can [music] feel it, somebody
[30:28] testify.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, do I have any witnesses today? If
[30:32] you believe it, [music]

[30:39] if you can feel it, somebody [music]
[30:42] testify. Testify.
[30:46] If you believe [music and singing] it,
[30:49] you receive it.
[30:52] If you can't feel [music] it, somebody
[30:55] testify.
[30:57] You got pain.
[31:00] He's a pain. [music]
[31:04] He lost.

[31:10] You need freedom
[31:13] save. [music] He's a prison shaking
[31:16] savior. You got chains.
[31:20] He's [music] a chain breaker.
[31:24] He got chains.
[31:27] He's [music] a chain [singing]
[31:28] breaker.
[31:30] Oh, go ahead and give the Lord a hand
[31:32] clap of praise this morning. Hallelujah.
[31:35] [applause and music]
[31:36] How many's experienced God in that way?
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a God not in our p only in
[31:41] our past.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; He's a God of the present. [music]
[31:45] &gt;&gt; And he's a God of our future.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? What a mighty God
[31:49] we serve this morning.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that. He's sanging
[31:53] that song and brother Ram was telling a
[31:56] time where he got a telegram from
[31:59] brother Bossworth and he asked the
[32:02] telegram people said how when did they
[32:04] send this? He said 24 hours ago and the
[32:08] angel of the Lord met him out there 24
[32:10] hours before the telegram ever got to
[32:12] him to pray for brother Bosworth. By the
[32:14] time brother Bosworth got the telegram
[32:16] or brother Brandham got the telegram.
[32:18] Brother Bossworth was already healed by
[32:20] the prayer that brother Brandham already
[32:21] gave. That's a mighty God we serve this
[32:24] morning. He's he's a God of our past.
[32:26] He's a God of our present. He's a God of
[32:28] our future. Oh, hallelujah. And I
[32:31] believe he's very mindful of each and
[32:34] every one of our needs this morning. I
[32:37] like to take a few things to the Lord in
[32:39] prayer this morning. Just remember
[32:41] brother David Gates. I spoke to him this
[32:43] morning on the phone and and um he's uh
[32:48] he was able to talk this morning and and
[32:50] [music] he's on some meds and stuff
[32:52] taking care of the pain. But just
[32:53] remember him in prayer. He asked the
[32:55] church body to remember him and he's
[32:58] he's gone through a lot of tests or
[33:00] hoping that the [music] that the
[33:01] infection ain't too much in his blood to
[33:04] to be sepsis. So just remember that and
[33:07] [music] uh he's a soldier. He's a good
[33:09] brother. He can have it our praise. I I
[33:13] couldn't help but thinking, brother
[33:15] Brian, that my the prayers is already
[33:17] going up for brother David is pushing
[33:19] back the line of infection as we speak.
[33:22] And I'm just ready to hear the testimony
[33:24] from him. Remember my sister, she's
[33:25] still in the hospital this [music]
[33:27] morning. McKenzie, just remember the
[33:28] family there. And uh also remember
[33:33] Xavier and Sister Jordan and the baby
[33:35] there. They're still down there hoping
[33:36] to be able to come home in a few days.
[33:38] Just [music] remember that sweet family
[33:40] in your prayer. And also it says please
[33:43] pray for Scott Treadway. Just [music]
[33:44] been told he has heart failure. We
[33:47] believe God can intercede in that prayer
[33:50] request. Also just remember him. Also
[33:53] prayer request for sister. So [music] we
[33:55] just remember that and any other needs
[33:57] we may have this morning. God knows
[34:00] every one of your needs. Can we just
[34:02] pray this morning? Lord Jesus
[34:05] God, it's just more than a song. is more
[34:08] than words, Lord God. But you're a
[34:11] mighty God this morning, Lord. And we
[34:14] come to worship you, not only in spirit,
[34:16] but in truth, Father. Lord,
[34:19] Lord, you said, "Ask and you shall
[34:21] receive, Lord. We're asking
[34:25] for all these requests, Lord, for our
[34:27] precious brother down in the hospital,
[34:29] Lord. We pray Lord God that you the the
[34:31] the mighty hand of Jehovah would go into
[34:34] that room Lord God and begin to turn the
[34:37] situation around Lord God. We know
[34:39] you're more than able Lord Lord God
[34:41] you're the one that created the heart
[34:43] Lord God and you're more than able
[34:45] intercede in Scott Treadway's [music]
[34:47] situation. Lord God we pray Lord God
[34:50] that you'd be his everpresent help in a
[34:52] time of trouble. Father, Lord, we pray
[34:55] for every request, Lord. Brother Xavier,
[34:58] Sister Jordan, and the baby. Lord, we
[35:00] just pray that you'd be there, Lord, to
[35:03] energize them and comfort them,
[35:05] strengthen them, Lord God. Lord, my
[35:07] sister still sitting in a hospital
[35:09] [music] two weeks later. Lord God, we
[35:11] pray, Lord God, that you'd strengthen
[35:13] her, Lord. Strengthen the family, Lord.
[35:16] We take these petitions to your throne
[35:18] of mercy and grace this morning, Lord,
[35:21] believing you're already working in
[35:23] their future, Lord.
[35:25] Lord, help this, each and every one of
[35:27] us that raised our hands this morning,
[35:29] Lord, that you'd intercede in their
[35:31] behalf,
[35:33] as we begin to turn this service into
[35:35] the most important part, Lord, the
[35:36] coming forth of your word, Lord. We pray
[35:39] Lord God that you'd just step the man
[35:42] out of aside Lord Lord and and operate
[35:46] that gift Lord that you placed in this
[35:48] man's life Lord God to be a pastor Grace
[35:51] tabernacle Lord we pray Lord God you
[35:53] give him words of eternal life Lord to
[35:56] speak to your precious bride this
[35:57] morning in Jesus Christ wonderful name.
[36:01] Can the bride say amen? Can the bride
[36:04] say praise the Lord?
[36:07] Come away my love.
[36:11] Come away
[36:13] [singing]
[36:15] my love.
[36:18] Come away,
[36:22] my love.
[36:25] Oh, I've waited for this day
[36:30] to give you your [singing] new name.
[36:33] Eternity
[36:35] awaits us. Come away,
[36:40] my love.
[36:43] There's [music] a table dressed in
[36:46] [singing] linen.
[36:47] The banquet is prepared.
[36:51] A host of angels gathered for the
[36:55] celebration.
[36:57] There [singing]
[36:58] the bride is almost [music] ready in
[37:02] spotless [singing]
[37:03] ride array.
[37:05] A hush falls over heaven as a groom
[37:10] begins [singing and music] to say,
[37:14] "Come away [singing]
[37:18] my love.
[37:21] Come away
[37:25] my love.
[37:28] Oh, I've waited [music] for this day.
[37:32] Oh, I can give you [singing] your new
[37:34] name.
[37:36] Eternity
[37:37] awaits [music] us. Come away. Oh, I like
[37:41] this last verse.
[37:46] Oh, I've loved you [singing] from
[37:48] creation [music]
[37:50] long before you came to me.
[37:53] Oh, I carried that love with me all the
[37:58] way to Calary.
[38:01] And though it [singing] wasn't over when
[38:04] they laid me in the tomb. Oh, I proved
[38:08] my love would never die. I rose again
[38:13] for you.
[38:16] Come away as our pastor would come this
[38:19] morning. Oh, can you lift your hands to
[38:21] him? Have you heard him scream this from
[38:23] heaven? Oh, hallelujah.
[38:30] Oh, I've waited for this day. Oh, I can
[38:35] give you your new name.
[38:38] Eternity [singing]
[38:40] [music] away from
[38:45] my love.
[38:48] Oh, come away.
[38:52] My love,
[38:56] come away,
[38:59] my love.
[39:03] I've waited for this day when I could
[39:07] give you your new name. [singing]
[39:10] Eternity [music] awaits us. Come away,
[39:17] my love.
[39:19] You're worthy of it all.
[39:26] Yes, [music] you're worthy of it all.
[39:33] Oh, from [singing] you are all things.
[39:37] To you are all things
[39:41] and you [singing and music] deserve the
[39:42] glory.
[39:48] You're [singing] worthy of it all.
[39:54] Yes, you're worthy of it all.
[40:01] Oh, [singing] for from you are all
[40:03] [music] things.
[40:05] To you are all things
[40:09] [music] and you deserve the glory.
[40:11] [singing] How many can say that this
[40:13] morning? Yes, Lord.
[40:16] You're worthy of it all. I just want you
[40:19] to know, Lord, how much you mean to me
[40:21] this morning. [music] You're worthy
[40:23] [singing]
[40:24] of it all.
[40:27] All my praise,
[40:30] [music] for from you [singing] are all
[40:31] things,
[40:33] and to you are all things. You deserve
[40:37] all the glory. [singing]
[40:43] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[40:45] clap of praise this morning? How many
[40:47] say he's worthy
[40:50] of all my praise and all the effort that
[40:54] I that I have and my if God never done
[40:57] anything else for me from this day on I
[40:59] could spend my life and I'd never make
[41:02] it up to him what he's already done.
[41:03] Isn't that right? I'd spend my life
[41:05] serving him. I can never do enough for
[41:07] the Lord. Amen. To to repay. I just
[41:10] thank God. Therefore, it's not based on
[41:11] our efforts and it's not based on our
[41:14] work. There's not enough praise that we
[41:16] could do that would that would make us
[41:19] worthy of what God has done for us.
[41:21] There's not enough work we could put in.
[41:22] There's not enough money you could give.
[41:24] Not enough time that you could devote to
[41:27] be worthy of what God has done for us.
[41:29] But we certainly want to give him our
[41:31] all this morning. Amen. How many loves
[41:33] the Lord? Amen. Certainly good to be in
[41:35] the house of the Lord this morning. And
[41:36] I just say it's a privilege uh to be
[41:39] able to stand before you uh another
[41:42] service to be able to speak the words of
[41:45] life. Amen. To take a scripture out of
[41:48] this Bible, this written word that has
[41:51] so changed my life. Amen. I count it a
[41:54] privilege to be able to take these words
[41:56] and to speak them over a congregation of
[41:58] people, whether there be two or 2,000. I
[42:01] know they're the words of life. Amen.
[42:03] And and it doesn't take um just a moment
[42:06] in the presence of God. And the right
[42:07] word at the right time can change
[42:09] anybody's situation. So we just we
[42:12] [music] just give ourselves to the Lord
[42:13] this morning. And as a speaker, I want
[42:16] to surrender myself to God. As a hearer,
[42:18] I would encourage you just to surrender
[42:20] to the Lord and ask God to speak to your
[42:21] heart. I know God is certainly more than
[42:24] able. He's mindful of what we have need
[42:26] of this morning. Maybe we just go before
[42:28] the Lord in a word of prayer before we
[42:30] open the word. And if you have something
[42:32] on your heart, I heard the request that
[42:34] brother Joe read many uh needs this
[42:37] morning, but maybe there's just
[42:38] something special you'd like for the
[42:39] Lord to do and [music] we just want to
[42:41] surrender to him. How many can do that
[42:43] this morning? Won't we just lift our
[42:44] hands to the Lord and say, "Lord, I just
[42:46] surrender to you. I surrender my own
[42:48] thoughts, my feelings, and everything
[42:50] that I have to you this morning and just
[42:52] ask you to take control of this service
[42:54] and [music] and to do your work amongst
[42:56] your children." Let's just approach him
[42:58] in that way. Gracious heavenly father,
[43:00] Lord, how we love you this morning. God,
[43:03] I know, Lord, that we're not worthy. And
[43:06] Lord, in our flesh, Lord, if we would
[43:08] look at each one of us, how unworthy
[43:11] that we feel, Lord, to even to stand in
[43:13] your presence.
[43:15] But Lord, we just thank you this morning
[43:17] for allowing us the opportunity again,
[43:19] Lord, as believers to come and gather
[43:21] around your throne of mercy, Lord, to
[43:23] take the word of of life, Lord, and God,
[43:27] to be able just to speak [music] it. And
[43:29] Lord, knowing that it'll bring life to
[43:31] somebody, Lord, what an encouragement
[43:32] that it is, Lord, that I know that
[43:34] there's nothing that we do for you that
[43:36] is done in vain, but Lord, you've called
[43:39] us to this place for this purpose in
[43:41] this hour. and Lord to speak this word
[43:43] that you've placed on our heart, Lord,
[43:45] this morning. Lord, I just ask you that
[43:46] it would find its resting place. And
[43:48] God, may we put everything else aside
[43:50] just for a few moments, Lord, to allow
[43:53] you the time to be able to speak to our
[43:55] hearts, Lord. And God, may we go from
[43:57] this place, Lord, knowing that every
[43:59] need has been met, every sickness has
[44:01] been healed. And Lord, everyone that
[44:04] would have a a need from you this
[44:06] morning, Lord, they would go from this
[44:07] building satisfied. Lord, we just thank
[44:10] you for all you do. Lord, we ask you to
[44:11] anoint the word of God and bring it to
[44:13] life this morning. We pray in Jesus
[44:16] Christ's name. Amen.
[44:19] Amen. God bless you this morning. We
[44:22] certainly appreciate being in the
[44:24] presence of the Lord this morning. I
[44:25] want to read out of the book of
[44:26] Colossians in the third chapter. And
[44:29] we'll just read uh one portion of
[44:31] scripture. Colossians the third chapter
[44:35] and in the in the first verse.
[44:37] Colossians 3 and one. give you just a
[44:40] moment to get there. And I sure enjoyed
[44:42] that song that young man sang. And Amen.
[44:46] We we certainly have a hope. Amen. And
[44:48] in this hour, amen. And every chain that
[44:51] we have and everything that would have
[44:53] you bound, there's came one that would
[44:54] set you free from it. Amen. The Bible
[44:57] says Colossians 3:1, "If you then be
[45:00] risen with Christ, seek those things
[45:03] which are above where Christ siteth on
[45:06] the right hand of God, and set your
[45:08] affection on things above, not on things
[45:11] on the earth. For you are dead, and your
[45:14] life is hid with Christ in God." And I
[45:18] would like to take this as a title this
[45:20] morning as you take your seats on
[45:22] setting your affection on things above.
[45:26] Setting your affection on things above.
[45:28] You know, I I think it's so easy uh to
[45:32] look around at the natural things and to
[45:34] rely on natural things uh that we have
[45:37] in this life. It seems to be what u uh
[45:40] it's constantly before us. You can't go
[45:42] a few moments without being reminded of
[45:44] everything that's going on around you.
[45:46] And uh we're we're constantly uh uh
[45:49] looking at things and and there's uh you
[45:51] know troubled it's just troubled times.
[45:54] It's constant and and uh you know we've
[45:56] been speaking over the past few services
[45:58] even brother Andrew would speak the
[45:59] other brothers minister and it just
[46:01] seems along the same line and uh and
[46:03] speaking on the purpose of the message
[46:05] in this hour and and how that how that
[46:08] God would send in every age a word to
[46:10] lead the church by and uh you know I
[46:13] thought about that. I thought, you know,
[46:14] that any sincere student of the Bible uh
[46:17] would know that God does nothing without
[46:19] a purpose. How many believes that? And
[46:21] and I'll say this, any good student of
[46:23] the Bible knows that God does nothing
[46:25] without a prophet. That's Amos 3 and7.
[46:27] So, uh but but also any sincere student
[46:31] of the message would know that in the
[46:32] meetings where uh the prophet of God
[46:34] would speak, where this message was
[46:36] preached, it was thoroughly vindicated
[46:38] uh to be a supernatural thing. There was
[46:40] supernatural occurrences. there was a
[46:43] the presence of a supernatural being.
[46:45] And uh you know, I think it's quite I
[46:47] want to say funny, but that might not be
[46:49] the word, but it's an odd thing that the
[46:51] world believes in in in in scary spirits
[46:54] and they believe in spooky spirits and
[46:56] they believe in evil spirits and
[46:58] everybody uh uh can build around that
[47:00] and talk around that and fellowship
[47:02] around it. And you know, we just came
[47:03] through Halloween and everybody's about
[47:05] the spooky and things, but isn't it an
[47:06] odd thing that the whole world can
[47:08] believe in evil spirits and spooky
[47:10] spirits, but uh when you go to talking
[47:11] about the Holy Spirit, nobody wants to
[47:13] believe in that. I I thought, but the
[47:15] reality is is there really was a Holy
[47:17] Spirit. And there really is a Holy
[47:18] Spirit. And it was the person of Jesus
[47:21] Christ. In fact, the prophet of God
[47:22] would identify him uh many times in his
[47:25] presence to be the angel of the Lord. Of
[47:28] course, we being students of the Bible,
[47:30] we know that the angel of the Lord would
[47:31] be present in this age. And the reason
[47:33] we know that is because according to the
[47:35] Bible and the signs of the time that
[47:37] we're living in, that we are in the
[47:39] rapture age. How many knows that we're
[47:41] living in the end time? I I know
[47:43] sometimes the older you get and the more
[47:46] you hear it. I know what Satan does. He
[47:48] kind of to push that off like maybe it's
[47:50] for another age, but friends, I'm just
[47:52] going to say it again this morning
[47:53] because I think it's worthy of being
[47:54] reminded that we are living in the
[47:56] rapture age. It might not be today. It
[47:58] might not be tomorrow. It might not be
[48:00] another 50 years, but this is the age of
[48:03] the rapture. This is the ending of time.
[48:05] This is what the Bible had prophesied
[48:07] all through the scriptures to this age
[48:08] that we're living in. And so, uh, we
[48:10] realize that because we're living in the
[48:12] rapture age, that according to
[48:13] Revelations the second and the third
[48:15] chapter, as the God would send a
[48:17] messenger into each age, that because
[48:18] this is the last age, that there would
[48:21] be a message that would come today in
[48:23] this age. And the purpose of it would be
[48:25] to bring life back to the church again.
[48:27] You remember what God's sign was
[48:29] whenever Israel was in their exodus,
[48:30] brother was talking about how the last
[48:32] plague that came to Israel right before
[48:34] their departing out of Egypt, the last
[48:36] plague was death. He said and that's the
[48:38] enemy that's going to strike the church
[48:39] now is death spiritually speaking. Says
[48:42] so those who will not follow Christ and
[48:44] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They
[48:46] will spiritually dry up and die. But I
[48:49] think something that was so good that
[48:51] that that even though we see that on
[48:52] every hand that before that death ever
[48:55] came to Egypt, brother Mark, there was
[48:57] an atonement that was made for that
[48:59] death. I thought, isn't that isn't that
[49:00] our God? if death was the final plague
[49:03] and death was the final curse that was
[49:05] going to come on them but before death
[49:07] came there came an atonement to them and
[49:09] you know it didn't just show up but it
[49:10] came in a special way there was a there
[49:12] was a certain way that God does things
[49:14] you know I thought you say well well how
[49:16] did it come you remember in the days of
[49:17] Israel that that it was actually in when
[49:20] the judgment came to Egypt in Exodus the
[49:23] 12th chapter the Bible says that that
[49:25] God spoke to Moses and Moses went to the
[49:27] children of of Egypt he said I will pass
[49:30] through the land of Egypt This night I
[49:32] will smite all the firstborn in the land
[49:33] of Egypt, both man and beast, and
[49:35] against all the gods of Egypt, I will
[49:37] execute judgment, for I am the Lord. It
[49:40] was a it was a declaration of judgment
[49:43] that had come upon Egypt. But you'll
[49:45] notice that after that declaration was
[49:47] made before it actually happened before
[49:49] so the declaration came the judgment was
[49:52] made but before it actually took place
[49:54] that same prophet that was named Moses
[49:56] the that spoke the plague of judgment he
[49:59] spoke to the children of Israel and he
[50:01] said unto them the Bible says Moses
[50:02] called the elders of Israel and he said
[50:04] draw out and take you a lamb according
[50:07] to your families a and kill the Passover
[50:10] and you shall take and dip it in the
[50:12] blood that is in the basin and strike
[50:14] the lentil on the two side posts with
[50:16] the blood that is in the basin and none
[50:18] of you shall go out at that door of the
[50:20] house until morning for the death angel
[50:23] is coming through the land and he's
[50:24] going to take the firstborn and death is
[50:27] tracking the land he said but don't you
[50:28] go out of the house but put blood upon
[50:30] the door for the Lord will pass through
[50:33] to smite the Egyptians and when he sees
[50:35] the blood upon the lentil on the two
[50:37] side post and the Lord will pass over
[50:39] your door and he will not suffer the
[50:42] destroyer to come in under your houses
[50:45] to smite you. I thought, my, isn't that
[50:47] a thing of God to think about this
[50:48] morning that even though there was a
[50:51] judgment that was declared, there was
[50:53] also by the same voice that declared
[50:55] judgment, declared a mercy of God. He
[50:57] gave an atonement. He said, "If you'll
[50:59] put the blood on the door, then then God
[51:01] will not suffer the destroyer to come
[51:04] into your house." I don't know about you
[51:05] this morning, but I claim that over my
[51:07] house that God would not suffer the
[51:09] destroyer to come into my house to
[51:11] destroy my household. I I think every
[51:14] father this morning ought to put ought
[51:15] to claim that this morning and say, "But
[51:17] God will not suffer the destroyer cuz I
[51:20] put the blood of God upon the door of my
[51:22] house that God won't suffer the
[51:24] destroyer to enter therein."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; But it was the same voice that
[51:27] pronounced judgment was also the voice
[51:30] that pronounced mercy
[51:31] &gt;&gt; to them. You know, I thought I thought
[51:33] about that. You know, we've certainly
[51:34] heard the voice of judgment in this
[51:36] hour. We've I'm I I I can remember on
[51:39] tape when the prophet of God said, "I
[51:41] indict this generation." The voice of
[51:43] judgment has rang loud and clear. It's
[51:45] not a It wasn't something that was
[51:47] skirted around. Brother B said he said,
[51:48] "Let me say this as I'm leaving
[51:50] tonight." He said, "This is America's
[51:52] hour. She has spurned it." I said this
[51:54] two years ago that America will never
[51:56] have a revival. Write it in your book
[51:58] and find out if it's not right or not.
[52:00] She is done. If God let America get by
[52:03] with this sinful, unbelieving,
[52:05] church-going bunch of hypocrites, he
[52:07] would have to raise up Sodom and
[52:09] Gomorrah and apologized to them for
[52:11] sinking them in order to be a just God.
[52:14] He said, even though the angels smoked
[52:16] them blind, they were in darkness
[52:17] feeling around a perverted spirit. And
[52:20] tonight, America stands in the same
[52:22] shape. There's nothing left but fire. I
[52:25] said, we've heard the voice of judgment.
[52:26] You say, "Well, brother Math, that was a
[52:28] nation but uh that rejected God." But
[52:30] what about the church? Well, when a
[52:32] prophet of God talked about the church,
[52:33] it wasn't much better of a case. And
[52:35] matter of fact, he said, "And the world
[52:37] has fallen apart again." He said, "But
[52:39] the church sits spiritually dead. She is
[52:42] gone. The hour has passed them. They're
[52:45] in a slump and hardly know what to do.
[52:47] One running this way and one that way.
[52:50] And here, every promise that God made in
[52:52] the Bible, every one of them is laying
[52:54] as good as they ever was. But it's the
[52:56] hour. What makes the church like this?
[52:58] It's because we're in the age of Leoa
[53:01] when she has to come this way for this
[53:03] is the hour for. So there ain't no
[53:06] getting around it. Whether it's the
[53:07] nation or whether it's the church, this
[53:09] is the hour of a spiritual plague. It's
[53:12] the hour of spiritual death coming upon
[53:14] the church. It's been plagued with
[53:16] death. But friends, let me tell you,
[53:17] because it's been plagued with death,
[53:19] there's also a people that would be
[53:21] called out of that condition. And the
[53:22] Bible would tell us that when they come
[53:24] into this great condition, you recognize
[53:26] in this age, brother Wesley, that they
[53:28] have recognized that there is a need for
[53:30] a spiritual revival. And now in this
[53:33] last day, the people around the world
[53:35] are a pulling. They're moving to trying
[53:37] to bring a revival back to America.
[53:39] There's many things that raise up, many
[53:41] great speakers. There'll be many great
[53:43] men that do all they can in order to
[53:45] restore a revival. But I got news for
[53:47] you. I don't want to say this to uh to
[53:49] hurt anybody in any way, but it ain't
[53:51] ever going to work cuz there'll never be
[53:53] another revival in America. There may be
[53:55] a revival among the bride. There'll be a
[53:58] revival among God's children, but
[54:00] there'll never be another nationwide
[54:01] revival. So, if that's your effort, it's
[54:03] an effort that is laid in vain because
[54:05] it will never come to pass. But notice
[54:07] what they've done is because they
[54:09] recognize there's a need for revival.
[54:11] They they try to impersonate the
[54:13] revival. I may as well preach this
[54:14] morning. But they they try to
[54:16] impersonate it with music and try to
[54:18] impersonate it with worship and have
[54:20] these big worship concerts and big music
[54:22] concerts in order to bring people into a
[54:24] spirit of church of church or a spirit
[54:26] of revival. But friends, I've got news
[54:28] for you this morning. Any revival that
[54:31] is not a word revival is no revival at
[54:34] all.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Because a revival is a comeback. In
[54:38] other words, it means to take something
[54:40] that was once alive that has became dead
[54:42] and to make it live again. That's what a
[54:44] revival is. So in the spirit of revival,
[54:46] I can say this this morning that there's
[54:48] no life outside of the word of God. So
[54:51] if a revival is to restore life and
[54:53] there's no life outside of the word,
[54:55] then it can only take the word of God to
[54:57] bring a true revival. That means I can
[54:59] say this this morning that there ain't
[55:00] no such thing as a musical revival.
[55:03] There's no such thing as a worshipdriven
[55:05] revival. There's no such thing as a
[55:07] praise revival. There's no such thing as
[55:09] a musicdriven revival or a youth program
[55:11] driven revival. But the only true
[55:13] revival that there is comes from a
[55:15] restoring of God's word in the heart of
[55:18] every believer. That's the only way
[55:20] you'll ever have a revival. I I know
[55:22] what they say. They say, "Well, what
[55:23] about Paul and Silas when they were down
[55:25] there in the jail cell?" The Bible said
[55:27] they sang and they begin to pray unto
[55:29] God and they were singing praises. And
[55:31] when they praised God, there came a
[55:33] revival in the jail cell that shook the
[55:35] walls. But friends, don't miss the
[55:37] important part. I can say this. It
[55:38] wasn't singing and praying that brought
[55:41] a revival in the jail cell or in their
[55:43] time of trouble, but it was a revival
[55:46] that caused them to sing and to pray in
[55:48] their time of trouble. Let me tell you,
[55:50] the revival was already there. That's
[55:52] why they were singing when they would
[55:53] look at the devil and say, "You can bind
[55:55] my hands and you can bind my feet, but
[55:57] you'll never take the praise of God out
[56:00] of these mortal lips. YOU CAN STAY my
[56:01] voice. You can tie me up. YOU CAN
[56:04] SHACKLE ME ALL YOU WANT TO. BUT AS LONG
[56:05] AS THERE'S still breath in my body.
[56:07] THERE'S A REVIVAL IN MY HEART AND IT'S
[56:09] CRYING out to my God. Revival didn't
[56:12] come from praising. It didn't come from
[56:14] singing. Revival came from the word of
[56:16] God. For the Bible said they were thrown
[56:18] in the jail cell because they were
[56:20] preaching the word of Jesus Christ. And
[56:22] they were making the word known in the
[56:24] streets of the city. That's why they
[56:25] were even captured. But that revival
[56:27] caused them in their time of trouble.
[56:30] Satan, you can do what you want to, but
[56:31] let me tell you, a real word revival,
[56:33] it'll produce some worship. Amen. It'll
[56:35] produce some praise. It'll produce some
[56:38] praying. It'll produce some singing. And
[56:40] we might use good music, and we might
[56:41] use good worship. And you know what it
[56:43] does, brother Mark? It attracts some
[56:45] people, and they'll come around and
[56:46] they'll enjoy some good worship, but all
[56:48] of a sudden, the word of God will drop
[56:50] in their heart. And then their faith is
[56:52] restored because they've heard the word
[56:54] of God. And when their faith is
[56:55] restored, now a real word revival comes
[56:58] into their heart. And then they go out
[57:00] singing and praising. Well, they must
[57:01] have heard a good song. No, that wasn't
[57:03] it at all. No, they're singing because
[57:05] something happened in their heart. They
[57:06] were identified with God by the word of
[57:09] God.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. A real
[57:12] revival, Holy Ghost revival, a spiritual
[57:15] revival. Remember what the Jesus said?
[57:17] He said they would come looking for it
[57:18] in the last days. He said there the
[57:20] kingdom of heaven will be like unto 10
[57:22] virgins which took their lamps and went
[57:24] forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of
[57:26] them were wise. Five were foolish. But
[57:28] they that were foolish took their lamps
[57:29] and they took no oil with them. And but
[57:33] the wise took oil in their vessels and
[57:34] with their lamps. And when while the
[57:37] bridegroom carried, they slumbered and
[57:38] slept. But at midnight there was a cry
[57:40] made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him. I thought, what a
[57:46] cry it is. But remember said, I believe
[57:48] we're that we're so close to the coming
[57:49] of the Lord that I can say that. Behold,
[57:52] the bridegroom cometh.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; I've heard the midnight cry. I wonder
[57:55] how many's heard it today. I've heard
[57:57] the midnight cry, the bridegroom cometh.
[57:59] This is the hour of the rapture is at
[58:01] hand. He said, we're right at the time
[58:03] of the end. That's the hour that we're
[58:05] living in. But then whenever he cried,
[58:07] all of the virgins arose and they
[58:10] trimmed their lamps because the
[58:11] bridegroom, there was a call of the
[58:13] bridegroom. Go ye out to meet him. Here
[58:15] they had went out and they had they had
[58:17] brought their lamps and and some of them
[58:19] brought oil in their lamps, which was
[58:20] the spirit of God. And they they were
[58:22] filled with oil. And the others, they
[58:24] were just they were they had lamps. They
[58:26] just didn't have any oil with it,
[58:27] brother David. And they but they but
[58:29] they went out and when they heard that
[58:30] cry, they awoke out of their slumber.
[58:32] They said, "The bridegroom cometh. Go ye
[58:34] out to meet him." Now they didn't have
[58:35] time. So they went to scurrying around
[58:37] at the last moment. And they went to
[58:39] those that had the oil and said, "Can
[58:41] you give us some of your oil because we
[58:43] can't find our way. We we have to have
[58:45] oil." And the and those with the oil
[58:46] knew the precious how how precious that
[58:49] it was. They said, "You go to the store
[58:51] and find those that sell oil. Go buy
[58:53] your own oil. I can't give you my oil.
[58:55] It it it's what God it's what I'm going
[58:56] to need in order to to get where I'm
[58:58] going. And the Bible says, "But when
[59:00] they went into the marketplace to find
[59:02] oil, that while they were gone in the
[59:04] marketplace that the Lord came," he
[59:06] said, "And when the bridegroom came that
[59:08] they that were ready, they went in with
[59:10] him to the marriage and the door was
[59:12] shut. But after came also the other
[59:14] virgins, saying, Lord, open to us." But
[59:16] he said, "I don't know you." And Jesus
[59:18] said, "Watch therefore, for you know
[59:20] neither the day nor the hour when the
[59:22] Son of Man cometh."
[59:24] In other words, keep oil in your lamp.
[59:26] He said, "You don't know the date or the
[59:28] hour when a son of man cometh." But
[59:30] said, remember, he said, "This is the
[59:31] hour that the sleeping virgin would come
[59:33] to buy oil. It's the same hour that the
[59:35] bridegroom would come." He said, "That's
[59:37] the way it is today, the denominational
[59:39] churches, how the that a few years ago,
[59:41] they wouldn't have nothing to do with
[59:42] any Pentecostal move. Why they would
[59:45] mock and make fun of it, all these
[59:46] different denominations, but now here
[59:48] they would come around and friends,
[59:50] we've seen it today, even greater than
[59:52] in that age. Is that not the movement in
[59:54] America today? If you want to have a
[59:56] great big church and a great movement,
[59:57] let me tell you what it is. It's a
[59:59] charismatic church. It's a
[1:00:00] non-denominational church. They're
[1:00:02] coming out of denominations by the
[1:00:04] thousands building these great
[1:00:05] charismatic churches, great worship
[1:00:07] centers. Say, what are they doing?
[1:00:09] They're coming to the coming to that
[1:00:11] place looking for the oil. They copy
[1:00:13] that same move of the Holy Ghost, that
[1:00:15] same move of Pentecostal speaking in
[1:00:18] tongues, trying to copy after that
[1:00:19] experience. He said, "But while they
[1:00:21] were trying to do it," he said, "they
[1:00:23] may go through all the emotions and all
[1:00:25] the isms and sensations, but the devil
[1:00:27] can impersonate all those things because
[1:00:29] they're coming in trying to buy oil, but
[1:00:32] while they're trying to find the oil,
[1:00:34] they'll never find it because the Bible
[1:00:35] said they'll never find it." Said, "But
[1:00:37] while they would come to buy it, trying
[1:00:39] to get it, the bridegroom will come, and
[1:00:41] the ones that had the oil are going to
[1:00:44] go in with him."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Friends, let me tell you, we're living
[1:00:47] in an age of spiritual death. But I
[1:00:49] thank God that right among that
[1:00:51] spiritual death there sleeps a that that
[1:00:53] there there there is one of those
[1:00:55] virgins that have has oil. She she ain't
[1:00:58] just one that that is that is empty. Her
[1:01:00] lamp isn't empty, but it's filled with
[1:01:02] the Holy Ghost. It's been filled from
[1:01:04] the beginning. But but friends, we we
[1:01:06] have a a way that God has sent us an
[1:01:08] atonement that he has sent us in this
[1:01:10] hour of spiritual death. You know, I
[1:01:12] think of it just as it was in the days
[1:01:13] of Egypt. There's an atonement that has
[1:01:15] been made for death. For the same voice
[1:01:18] that declared judgment was the same
[1:01:20] voice that declared mercy. And I've
[1:01:22] heard the voice of judgment. I've heard
[1:01:24] the voice say that this nation has
[1:01:26] spurned it. And and the church world has
[1:01:28] spurned it. And there's spiritual uh
[1:01:29] spiritual death that's come upon the
[1:01:31] church. But you know what else I've
[1:01:32] heard? I've heard the voice of mercy.
[1:01:34] When he said, "Hide yourself in the
[1:01:36] Lord's pavilion." John said, "There was
[1:01:38] a bride. I saw her. She was adorned for
[1:01:40] her husband. For the bride hath made
[1:01:42] herself ready." But Abraham said, "May
[1:01:44] this be the crowning of my ministry that
[1:01:46] the bride would dress herself in the
[1:01:48] word of God." I thank God that in a time
[1:01:50] of spiritual death, but there's still a
[1:01:52] way, an atonement, a covering for the
[1:01:54] bride of Jesus Christ that she wouldn't
[1:01:56] be able to go to God empty-handed. But
[1:01:58] he gave us what we needed to cover
[1:02:00] ourselves, put on the covering of the
[1:02:03] word of God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Bam telling the the
[1:02:05] vision or the preview of the bride.
[1:02:07] Remember he went over there, he said, "I
[1:02:08] saw all of those that would come before
[1:02:10] the come before the Lord. They were
[1:02:12] marching on and I saw that little bride
[1:02:14] as she came forth and how beautiful and
[1:02:16] a lovely lady that she was. And as she
[1:02:19] went forth and I I watched how she
[1:02:21] walked so ladylike and and he said and
[1:02:23] after that she went by then I watched
[1:02:26] the church of every age walk by as they
[1:02:28] were preview. Remember when he saw her
[1:02:30] he said a voice spoke to me and said
[1:02:32] that's the preview of the bride. He said
[1:02:34] how lovely she was. But then I saw the
[1:02:36] the the the church out of every age and
[1:02:38] every age she got worse and worse and
[1:02:41] worse. He said then it come down to the
[1:02:43] last age and I saw that go by and and
[1:02:45] and the voice spoke to me and said this
[1:02:47] was the church out of America, the USA.
[1:02:50] He said when she went by she had she had
[1:02:52] no clothes on from from her waist up.
[1:02:54] She was nude from the waist up. A little
[1:02:56] hulas skirt trying to cover herself with
[1:02:58] some gray covering. He said what a
[1:02:59] hideous sight it was as I saw her
[1:03:02] marching there. He said, "And I got so I
[1:03:04] felt so bad to think that after all of
[1:03:06] the ministry and after all of the work
[1:03:08] that had gone forth that that that this
[1:03:10] would be this way." And he said, "I saw
[1:03:12] how ugly it was and here she was
[1:03:14] marching and twisting to a a tune of
[1:03:16] rock and roll and just carry it on." He
[1:03:18] said, "And that voice cried out and
[1:03:20] said, that is the church." He said, "How
[1:03:22] awful it was to think that that was the
[1:03:24] church." He said, "It passed me by and
[1:03:26] my heart fainted. I thought if that's
[1:03:27] what's been trying to present it to
[1:03:29] Christ as the bride." He said, "Of all
[1:03:31] the efforts and things that have gone
[1:03:32] forth to bring a bride for Christ, what
[1:03:34] a vulgar and dirty and filthy looking
[1:03:36] prostitute like that to be the bride of
[1:03:38] Christ." He said, "It made me sick at my
[1:03:41] heart." He said, "But as God is my
[1:03:43] judge," he said, "that was the church
[1:03:45] from the USA." He said, "But as she
[1:03:48] passed by, the whole back part had no
[1:03:50] covering at all." He said, "I felt faint
[1:03:51] and sickly." He said, "But all of a
[1:03:53] sudden, I heard that voice again." See
[1:03:56] the same cry, the same voice of judgment
[1:03:58] was also the same voice of atonement. He
[1:04:00] said, I heard that voice again and he
[1:04:02] said the bride will come into preview
[1:04:04] again. He said and here the bride came
[1:04:07] behind her. Here the very same looking
[1:04:09] bride that had passed in the beginning.
[1:04:11] She was marching to the same tomb. She
[1:04:13] was walking the same way. She was
[1:04:15] dressed in the same garment. The same
[1:04:17] bride that came in the first days that
[1:04:19] ride in the last days. He said there she
[1:04:21] came passing by again. He said, "And
[1:04:23] then my heart jumped for joy to know
[1:04:26] that there will be a bride and she will
[1:04:29] be made of the same thing and clothed in
[1:04:31] the same thing that the one was in the
[1:04:34] beginning. For she is called. She's
[1:04:36] called of God in this hour. In an hour
[1:04:38] of spiritual death, there's one that's
[1:04:40] called to be alive. In an hour of people
[1:04:42] that are a backslid nation, there's one
[1:04:45] THAT'S CALLED TO STAND UPON THE word of
[1:04:47] God. In a in an hour when people fail to
[1:04:49] believe, there's one that's still called
[1:04:51] to be a believer. Abraham said, "I know
[1:04:53] it's the truth." He said, "If that isn't
[1:04:55] true, then every vision that I've ever
[1:04:58] had is a lie."
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I know it's true. I saw her in
[1:05:03] the beginning and I saw her in the end."
[1:05:05] He said, "Everyone that knows that
[1:05:07] they've been true. The filthiness of
[1:05:09] this modern church calling herself a
[1:05:10] church." But friends, let me tell you,
[1:05:13] in the age of spiritual death, we have
[1:05:14] an atonement.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; We have a covering. This word has become
[1:05:19] a covering unto us.
[1:05:22] But notice how they received it. See,
[1:05:25] the atonement came in the form of a
[1:05:27] message. It wasn't just any kind of a
[1:05:29] message. Watch in Egypt now. We're back
[1:05:31] to Egypt. Had it had to be a message if
[1:05:34] he if Moses is going to come and bring
[1:05:35] the children of Israel out of this
[1:05:37] condition. It had to be a message that
[1:05:38] had enough power to cause Pharaoh to let
[1:05:41] him go.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; So, this couldn't be a feel-good
[1:05:43] message.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Couldn't be a motivational speech. He
[1:05:46] wasn't going to motivate Pharaoh into
[1:05:48] letting all of his slaves leave out of
[1:05:50] this place. It couldn't be just
[1:05:52] something that would make people feel
[1:05:53] good. It had to have enough power that
[1:05:55] God's children would follow it. It had
[1:05:57] to have enough power that the devil
[1:05:58] would be afraid of it. It had to have
[1:06:00] enough power that Pharaoh would let them
[1:06:02] loose. It had it had to be a message
[1:06:04] with power. So, it had to be a message
[1:06:06] that would shake a nation. It had to be
[1:06:08] a message that would bring deliverance
[1:06:09] to God's children. So, therefore, if it
[1:06:11] was going to come a message, it would
[1:06:13] had to be a supernatural message.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why would it have to be
[1:06:16] supernatural?" Let me tell you why.
[1:06:18] because that's all that's all that
[1:06:19] Israel knew was supernatural. Do you
[1:06:21] realize this that they were
[1:06:22] supernaturally brought into Egypt and
[1:06:24] they were supernaturally brought out. So
[1:06:26] in order to bring them out of that
[1:06:27] condition, there had to come a
[1:06:28] supernatural message. That's why they
[1:06:30] got there. Remember Abraham. God called
[1:06:31] him to sojourn into a land that wasn't
[1:06:33] his. Abraham begot Jacob. Jacob begot
[1:06:36] Isaac. Isaac or Isaac and Isaac begot
[1:06:38] Jacob, which was Israel. Jacob had 12
[1:06:40] sons. Remember the the first son from
[1:06:42] his wife that he loved so much, Rachel.
[1:06:44] It it started out with a supernatural
[1:06:46] birth which was Joseph, Rachel wasn't
[1:06:48] able to have children. She was barren.
[1:06:50] But because of the supernatural, God
[1:06:52] touched her body. He brought forth
[1:06:54] Joseph. And Joseph being a blessed man
[1:06:55] of God. He was filled with the
[1:06:57] supernatural. He went out as a young
[1:06:59] man. He had dreams. God dealt with him
[1:07:00] on a supernatural level. His brothers
[1:07:02] hated him because the dreams that he
[1:07:04] had. Remember, he said, "I saw the sheav
[1:07:06] that were that were bound together and I
[1:07:08] saw y'all's sheav bound down to mine."
[1:07:10] And they got mad at him. And then he
[1:07:11] came back. He said, "I had another
[1:07:13] dream. There was a moon and the star, 11
[1:07:15] stars and the sun and the moon and they
[1:07:17] all bowed down to me and even Jacob his
[1:07:19] father would say, "You mean me and your
[1:07:20] mother and all your brothers are going
[1:07:22] to bow down to you?" And they hated him
[1:07:24] because of the supernatural that took
[1:07:26] place in his life. But it had to take
[1:07:28] the supernatural in order for God's plan
[1:07:30] to be able to work.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; So God brought a man that was anointed
[1:07:34] and able to see dreams. And they hated
[1:07:36] him so much that they wanted to kick him
[1:07:37] out. Little did they know, they fell
[1:07:39] right into the plan of God. They took
[1:07:41] him out. They threw him in a pit. They
[1:07:42] sold him to a slave caravan. The caravan
[1:07:45] soldwed him to Piper's house. Piper's
[1:07:47] wife lied on him. He wound up in a
[1:07:49] prison. But even in the prison, the
[1:07:50] entire time he still seen dreams. He
[1:07:53] still saw visions. God still dealt with
[1:07:55] him. The supernatural was still working
[1:07:57] in his life until finally the Pharaoh
[1:08:00] had need of him. And that same very
[1:08:02] supernatural gift in his life is what
[1:08:04] saved the entire nation of Egypt. It
[1:08:06] saved the entire nation of Israel. And
[1:08:08] God took a prisoner and put him on the
[1:08:11] throne of Egypt. It was supernatural
[1:08:13] that brought them into that place. They
[1:08:15] didn't just accidentally show up. It was
[1:08:17] a supernatural gift that put him in that
[1:08:20] place. And it would take a supernatural
[1:08:21] gift that would bring them out.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; He was so supernatural that God took a
[1:08:27] slave and made him a ruler over Egypt.
[1:08:28] But notice after a few years that Joseph
[1:08:32] had passed away, there was nothing
[1:08:33] recorded in Egypt for many years,
[1:08:35] hundreds of years, that there's nothing
[1:08:37] recorded of God ever doing among his
[1:08:38] among his children. So there's no record
[1:08:41] of it. Went through years. They went
[1:08:42] through all these years of prosperity.
[1:08:44] Many years that they lived there,
[1:08:45] hundreds of years that they lived in
[1:08:47] bondage after the new Pharaoh came that
[1:08:49] did not know Joseph. But then it came to
[1:08:51] a time of deliverance. You think about
[1:08:52] all this time, no great supernatural
[1:08:55] move here. this great supernatural that
[1:08:57] took place to get him in here. Even
[1:08:58] after they got there, there was some
[1:09:00] great things that happened in Joseph's
[1:09:02] life and those that followed after
[1:09:03] Joseph, but there came one that didn't
[1:09:04] know him. And so then after all this
[1:09:06] time had gone by and they came to this
[1:09:08] this spiritual plague or that where
[1:09:10] there wasn't no move of God, all these
[1:09:12] things, everything it just seemed to be
[1:09:14] gone. But then then after a little
[1:09:17] while, all of a sudden after Joseph
[1:09:19] died, but Ram said, "See the
[1:09:20] supernatural, it went with Joseph." He
[1:09:22] said, "There came death." Because Joseph
[1:09:24] was a type of Christ. But notice that
[1:09:26] just before judgment came, then all of a
[1:09:29] sudden there came again God to bring his
[1:09:31] church out. And there was a message.
[1:09:34] There was a prophet. There was angels
[1:09:35] that appeared. There was a supernatural
[1:09:37] signs that took place. I thought, isn't
[1:09:39] it something that that it was a
[1:09:40] supernatural that put them there? It's a
[1:09:42] supernatural that I kind of say it like
[1:09:44] this. It was a supernatural that
[1:09:46] established the church. It was a
[1:09:47] supernatural that came to the 120 in the
[1:09:49] upper room. It was a supernatural that
[1:09:51] started it. After all those years when
[1:09:54] it seemed like the supernatural was gone
[1:09:56] and the miracles ain't gone and the
[1:09:57] things of God, it seemed like they went
[1:09:59] through all those dark ages. But then
[1:10:00] when it would come the time of
[1:10:02] deliverance, all of a sudden we have a
[1:10:04] prophet again. A message is sent to
[1:10:06] them. There's an angels that are
[1:10:08] appearing again. It ain't just some
[1:10:09] story no gone by, but the angels of God
[1:10:12] are walking amongst the children OF GOD
[1:10:14] AGAIN. THE SONS OF MEN ARE meeting the
[1:10:17] angels of God on the road and they're
[1:10:19] giving them word to be able to speak to
[1:10:21] God's children because it's the time of
[1:10:23] deliverance,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; the time of the rapture.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; The angel came, the supernatural came,
[1:10:28] the prophet came, the supernatural, can
[1:10:30] I say this this morning? The
[1:10:31] supernatural is a declaration that
[1:10:34] slavery was over, that their bondage was
[1:10:36] ending, and that freedom was here.
[1:10:39] [laughter]
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's what it declared in that hour.
[1:10:42] slavery was over, their bondage was
[1:10:44] ending, and freedom was here. And I got
[1:10:45] news for you. It wasn't just for Egypt,
[1:10:47] but that's the same thing that happened
[1:10:48] for us today. That's the same way their
[1:10:50] atonement came. It's the same way our
[1:10:52] atonement came. God sent a message in
[1:10:55] this hour. It wasn't just some little
[1:10:57] message. It was a supernatural message,
[1:10:59] Brother Mark, that would declare freedom
[1:11:01] from spiritual bondage. I say this this
[1:11:03] morning that the message of Revelations
[1:11:05] 18, come out of her, my people, is an
[1:11:07] anointed message of God. It's a
[1:11:09] supernatural message. It had to HAVE
[1:11:11] ENOUGH POWER TO CALL THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:11:14] CHRIST OUT OF THE church and the bondage
[1:11:16] that she WAS IN. IT HAD TO HAVE ENOUGH
[1:11:18] POWER to call her out. IT HAD TO HAVE
[1:11:20] THE POWER TO ESTABLISH HER. IT WAS AN
[1:11:22] anointing message, A SUPERNATURAL
[1:11:24] MESSAGE. IT HAD TO HAVE THE ABILITY,
[1:11:26] brother Mah, TO TELL A PEOPLE THAT
[1:11:28] SLAVERY WAS OVER AND BONDAGE WAS ENDED
[1:11:30] AND FREEDOM WAS HERE. IT HAD TO HAVE THE
[1:11:33] POWER TO DELIVER GOD'S CHILDREN. THEY'VE
[1:11:35] BEEN SO WRAPPED up by dark
[1:11:36] denominationalism and and formalism and
[1:11:39] spiritually dead. But I thank GOD
[1:11:41] THERE'S A MESSAGE THAT CAME IN THIS HOUR
[1:11:43] THAT HAD THE POWER TO DECLARE UNTO YOU
[1:11:46] THAT SLAVERY IS OVER AND BONDAGE IS
[1:11:48] ENDED AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I SAY THAT
[1:11:51] THIS MORNING, SLAVERY IS OVER AND
[1:11:53] BONDAGE IS ENDED AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I
[1:11:56] WONDER HOW MANY SAY IT THIS MORNING. I
[1:11:57] SAID SLAVERY IS OVER. BONDAGE IS ENDED
[1:12:00] AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I'M TALKING ABOUT A
[1:12:02] MESSAGE THAT HAD THE POWER TO DELIVER
[1:12:05] GOD'S CHILDREN OUT of a state of
[1:12:07] bondage.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; It had to be supernatural.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It ain't no little thing. It's
[1:12:13] supernatural. This ain't no story book.
[1:12:15] This ain't no children's story. IT'S
[1:12:17] SUPERNATURAL. THIS AIN'T just another
[1:12:19] church or another message or or
[1:12:21] something that men try to make it UP TO
[1:12:23] BE. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:12:24] SUPERNATURAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:12:26] PRESENCE OF GOD AND HIS HOLY ANGELS
[1:12:28] PRESENT AMONG his church. Slavery's
[1:12:32] over.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Bondage has ended. Freedom is here.
[1:12:36] That's our declaration.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; They waited all those years for God to
[1:12:40] fulfill his promise.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Wonder how long they waited. All those
[1:12:46] years waiting for God to come fulfill
[1:12:48] his promise. They go into the
[1:12:50] marketplace scared to death. There's
[1:12:52] going to be a taskmaster there. They had
[1:12:54] to dodge all the all the Egyptians and
[1:12:57] hide from them. But maybe there was some
[1:12:58] there that said, "One of these days, I'm
[1:13:00] going to be able to walk into this place
[1:13:02] and it'll change the way I approach."
[1:13:03] And you know, when the prophet's message
[1:13:05] came to Israel, I imagine that it
[1:13:08] changed their approach when they walked
[1:13:10] around.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that few days in there
[1:13:12] when Moses is is bringing the plagues
[1:13:15] upon Egypt and God's dealing with them
[1:13:16] and the message that Moses's message has
[1:13:18] reached the ears of the Israelites here?
[1:13:20] They know that God's bringing them out.
[1:13:21] They're seeing the hand of God. They're
[1:13:23] seeing the work of God. and brother
[1:13:24] Martin now they're all all of a sudden
[1:13:25] they're walking around now that they
[1:13:27] have a new hope brother Tom that walk
[1:13:28] out I can go in the marketplace and I
[1:13:30] ain't afraid to go in the marketplace
[1:13:31] you know one of these days maybe some
[1:13:33] old Egyptian give them an ugly look they
[1:13:35] say you can look ugly all you want to
[1:13:37] but in a few days I'll never have to
[1:13:38] look at you again I know that God's
[1:13:40] going to bring me out of this place I
[1:13:41] I'll never have to look at that building
[1:13:43] I'll never have to look at that mud pit
[1:13:45] I'll never have to look at that that big
[1:13:46] old thing you made that old uh ugly city
[1:13:49] that you made me build one of these days
[1:13:50] this city will be in my rearview mirror
[1:13:52] and I'll never come back care again.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; God is going to destroy him. They knew
[1:13:58] one day they could walk out. You know
[1:14:00] why? Because the supernatural was a
[1:14:03] vindication to them that God was going
[1:14:05] to bring them out.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? The supernatural
[1:14:08] came before he brought them out.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the supernatural that
[1:14:12] brought them out. Before he brought them
[1:14:13] out, there was a season of the
[1:14:15] supernatural operating in the midst of
[1:14:17] the church. You see, so here here it
[1:14:20] would give them faith that God was going
[1:14:21] to bring them out. And friends, can I
[1:14:23] just say this this morning that when the
[1:14:25] supernatural comes, that ain't the only
[1:14:26] thing it brings is faith.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It also brings out every doubter. It
[1:14:29] brings out every critic. It brings out
[1:14:31] every skeptic. It brings out every
[1:14:33] unbeliever that there ever was. You you
[1:14:35] you let you think it wasn't the same way
[1:14:37] there. Whenever somebody came around and
[1:14:38] said, "Hey, Moses is the man that God
[1:14:40] has anointed for this hour. Oh, God's c
[1:14:43] sent a prophet in this me sent a message
[1:14:45] in this age. He's going to deliver us.
[1:14:47] Moses, how's that one man going to
[1:14:49] deliver us from this great army of the
[1:14:51] Egyptians? But all I know is this the
[1:14:53] word of the Lord and I promise you there
[1:14:54] was people that went out talking to
[1:14:56] their families just like they do in this
[1:14:58] age and say, "Well, I don't know where
[1:14:59] they got that from." Matter of fact, I
[1:15:01] mean, who is that Moses anyhow? And what
[1:15:03] what makes him any better than the next
[1:15:04] man? And why would he have the ability?
[1:15:06] Why? He ain't just but one man. You know
[1:15:08] what? There was doubters there. And
[1:15:10] there was I can just hear him right now.
[1:15:11] You was raised in this slave pit. You
[1:15:13] was born in the slave pit. I'm going to
[1:15:15] die in the slave pit. I I was born
[1:15:17] building bricks. I'm going to die
[1:15:18] building bricks. You can go on and
[1:15:19] believe all that hokeyp pokey if you
[1:15:21] want to, but I know I'm just going to
[1:15:22] stay right here and keep my nose to the
[1:15:24] ground because that's what this is where
[1:15:26] God po put us and this is just our lot
[1:15:28] and we're just going to have to deal
[1:15:29] with this world and we're never going to
[1:15:31] be able to overcome it and we're never
[1:15:32] GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT. THIS
[1:15:33] IS JUST WHAT GOD WANTS FOR MY LIFE.
[1:15:35] THERE WAS DOUBTERS there too. But I
[1:15:37] thank God there was somebody say, "But
[1:15:39] the Bible, but the word of God said that
[1:15:41] he is going to send a messenger in this
[1:15:44] age that would bring an atonement to the
[1:15:46] children OF GOD IN A way that THEY COULD
[1:15:48] COME OUT OF THIS CONDITION." [cheering]
[1:15:50] [applause]
[1:15:50] FRIENDS, don't you realize there's a
[1:15:52] Everything has a season, drought has a
[1:15:54] season, famine has a season, bondage has
[1:15:56] a season, sickness has a season,
[1:15:58] persecution has a season, oppression has
[1:16:01] a season, GRIEF HAS A SEASON. But the
[1:16:04] same God of Joseph
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; was the same God of Moses.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; The supernatural brought him in, the
[1:16:09] supernatural brought him out. And Moses
[1:16:11] said, "How will they believe me?" And
[1:16:15] God said, "I'll give you a sign."
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; See, the supernatural would be a
[1:16:19] vindication that he was sent by God. You
[1:16:22] know what the Bible says? When Aaron
[1:16:24] spoke all the words which the Lord said
[1:16:26] to Moses and he did the signs in front
[1:16:29] of the people, can I tell you what the
[1:16:30] Bible says?
[1:16:32] Bible says the people believed.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good enough?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; When he did the signs in front of the
[1:16:39] people, the people believed. I thought
[1:16:41] it didn't matter how many doubters. It
[1:16:42] didn't matter how many skeptics. It
[1:16:44] didn't matter how many was fighting
[1:16:45] against Moses. The Bible says, but the
[1:16:47] people believed. I thought, thank God
[1:16:49] there's some people that when they see
[1:16:50] the sign, there was some that believe.
[1:16:53] That that's what I took there. There
[1:16:54] there still was those that held on to
[1:16:56] the faith that that when they seen the
[1:16:58] supernatural, they believed. It's the
[1:17:00] same way today. I thank God that there's
[1:17:02] some that still believe that we know
[1:17:04] that Christ when he died on Calvary.
[1:17:06] They've been waiting on him to return.
[1:17:08] But the only way to know of his return
[1:17:10] is a vindication of the supernatural.
[1:17:12] That's the only way you'll know it.
[1:17:13] That's what Paul said. He said he was
[1:17:15] once offered to bear the sins of many.
[1:17:18] And unto them that look for him shall he
[1:17:20] appear the second time without sin unto
[1:17:23] salvation. You say, "Well, who will he
[1:17:25] appear to?" I can tell you what the
[1:17:26] Bible said. He said he will appear to
[1:17:28] those that love his appearing and
[1:17:30] welcome his return.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; They believe the sign that they saw.
[1:17:35] Said, "We've seen the presence of a
[1:17:37] supernatural sign that has declared to
[1:17:39] us that bondage is over and has called
[1:17:42] us out of the church and into the bride
[1:17:44] of Jesus Christ."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many believers we have here
[1:17:47] this morning.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; How many fall in that category? Well,
[1:17:52] they heard the word that God said to
[1:17:54] Moses and they saw the sign. The people
[1:17:57] believed.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Makes me want to preach on it.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And the people believed. Isn't that
[1:18:02] good? And the people believed.
[1:18:05] But notice what Moses done
[1:18:08] to bring the people to this place. He
[1:18:11] had to take their eyes off of the power
[1:18:15] that was before them and put their eyes
[1:18:17] on something else. Here these people
[1:18:19] were born and they were raised in this
[1:18:21] condition of Egypt. And they would look
[1:18:24] at the great power of Pharaoh and the
[1:18:26] power of Egypt. What a great nation that
[1:18:28] it was. A great army, a great place that
[1:18:31] they were in bondage to. And how easy it
[1:18:35] is and even today how easy it is to look
[1:18:37] at the greatness of the pull of the
[1:18:39] world and the greatness of Leosa and the
[1:18:42] greatness of the of the world and all
[1:18:44] the things of the world and how how easy
[1:18:46] it is to get our eyes and look upon the
[1:18:48] the bondage that Satan puts us under and
[1:18:51] how it's so easy to look around and see
[1:18:53] everybody's failures and so easy to look
[1:18:55] in a mirror and see all of our own
[1:18:56] failures. Isn't it easy to see those
[1:18:58] things? But listen, when Moses would
[1:19:00] come, he says, "See, we're we're just a
[1:19:02] little people, and look how look how
[1:19:03] grand all that is out there, and we're
[1:19:05] we're just this little group of Israel.
[1:19:07] We don't have no army. We we don't have
[1:19:08] these great chariots like that. We how
[1:19:10] could we ever fight somebody like that?
[1:19:12] We're just a little people." But Moses
[1:19:14] changed their eyes from looking at the
[1:19:16] natural thing to looking to the
[1:19:18] supernatural.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; This is what Apostle Paul was doing. Do
[1:19:21] I got time to finish? This is what
[1:19:23] apostle Paul was doing in in the in the
[1:19:26] book of Colossians is he was actually
[1:19:28] changing the view of the church.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Paul said where Christ siteth on the
[1:19:33] right hand of God. I think this is so
[1:19:35] powerful. He said if he if ye the then
[1:19:38] be risen with Christ seek those things
[1:19:40] which are above where Christ siteth on
[1:19:42] the right hand of God. I thought here
[1:19:44] when he would approach the church the
[1:19:46] first thing he does is to show them
[1:19:48] where Christ is. That he's not in a
[1:19:50] tomb. He wants to make known he's not in
[1:19:51] a tomb somewhere. He's not he's not he's
[1:19:54] not dead. He's not buried up in a grave
[1:19:55] somewhere. He said, "But first, let's
[1:19:57] just change our focus. I I know there's
[1:19:59] a lot going on in the church. And
[1:20:00] there's a lot going on in the world.
[1:20:02] Even in the Colossian and the Corinthian
[1:20:04] church, in the Ephesus church, can I go
[1:20:06] ahead and say it? In the Black Rockck
[1:20:08] Church, and the Arkansas church, in the
[1:20:09] in the India church, there there's a lot
[1:20:11] of things going on all all in the
[1:20:13] church." But Paul, he says, "But but he
[1:20:15] says," but first notice, he says, "Seek
[1:20:17] those things which are above where
[1:20:19] Christ siteth on the right hand of God."
[1:20:21] I thought he couldn't say it any better
[1:20:23] because it changes our view of the
[1:20:25] things around us and causes us to look
[1:20:27] to something else. Where where is this
[1:20:28] right hand of God and where where is
[1:20:30] this throne of God that you're speaking
[1:20:32] of? He says, "See, so he's changing the
[1:20:34] view of the church." And now Paul said,
[1:20:36] "But so set your affection on things
[1:20:38] above and not on the things of the
[1:20:40] earth."
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Can I say this this morning? You know,
[1:20:43] in order to set your affection on things
[1:20:45] above, you realize that to set it can't
[1:20:47] be coincidental. To set something, it
[1:20:50] can't be accidental. So when Paul says
[1:20:52] set your affection, the word set means
[1:20:54] to put or to place or to stand something
[1:20:56] in a desired place or position. So to
[1:20:58] set something, it would have to be it
[1:21:00] would have to be an intentional act. If
[1:21:02] I'm going to set something, that that
[1:21:04] that's why he would use that word. I can
[1:21:06] set that bottle there. It can't
[1:21:07] accidentally go there. If I'm to set it,
[1:21:09] I have to place it. It has to be
[1:21:11] intended. It had to has to be with
[1:21:12] purpose. Paul said, "Set your affection
[1:21:15] on things above." In other words, it ret
[1:21:18] it requires an intentional and a
[1:21:20] conscious effort in order to set your
[1:21:22] affection on these things. That means
[1:21:24] you can't go through life and say,
[1:21:25] "Well, whatever the boss says, I'm just
[1:21:27] going to let it happen. And whatever
[1:21:28] whatever mom says, I'm just going I'm
[1:21:30] just going to go through the motions.
[1:21:31] And whatever the brother Matt says, I'm
[1:21:33] just going to I'm just going to go
[1:21:34] through it and that'll be enough. And
[1:21:36] whatever whatever the church says, I
[1:21:38] that'll be enough. Whatever the the
[1:21:39] preacher says, that'll be enough." Well,
[1:21:40] friends, let me tell you that might get
[1:21:42] you by in the natural, but but but but
[1:21:44] your spiritual life demands more of you
[1:21:46] than just getting by.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual life demands more of you
[1:21:53] than just getting by and just going
[1:21:54] through the motions. And Paul said you
[1:21:56] have to set your affections.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; It's an intentional act. It's something
[1:21:59] that you have to purposefully do. Said,
[1:22:02] that's why God brought you something
[1:22:04] that you could have faith in. You see,
[1:22:05] see why there's so many uh today that
[1:22:07] try to put faith in so many things.
[1:22:09] Abraham said, he said, "A man could even
[1:22:11] come here right now and have nail scars
[1:22:12] in his hands. He could have thorn prints
[1:22:14] and and say, "I am the Lord and any old
[1:22:17] hypocrite could do that." He said, "But
[1:22:19] the life, the Lord Jesus, the body is
[1:22:21] sitting at the right hand of the
[1:22:22] majesty. And when he comes, time is no
[1:22:24] more when that body returns to the
[1:22:26] earth." He said, "But his spirit is
[1:22:28] here." And his life is giving evidence
[1:22:30] of him being here because he said, "I'll
[1:22:32] be with you even in you unto the end of
[1:22:35] the world." So here a prophet of God
[1:22:36] would take it and show you how to look
[1:22:39] upon the right thing. It ain't to look
[1:22:40] for a man with nail scarred hands. We're
[1:22:42] not looking for somebody that has a
[1:22:44] thorn on his head. We're not looking for
[1:22:45] somebody to come by in a robe and
[1:22:47] wearing sandals and have long hair
[1:22:49] walking on the side of the road carrying
[1:22:50] a cross trying to do something for the
[1:22:52] Lord. Well, that's all wonderful and
[1:22:53] everything, but it ain't it ain't ever
[1:22:55] going that that that ain't where God is.
[1:22:57] But but he said, but he's on the right
[1:22:58] hand of God. He said, "But his spirit is
[1:23:00] here for his spirit is alive and his
[1:23:03] life is giving evidence of him being
[1:23:05] here." So God has brought us something
[1:23:07] that we could have faith in. It's not a
[1:23:09] physical body or the corporal body of
[1:23:11] Jesus, but it's the life or the spirit
[1:23:13] of God that is present among the church.
[1:23:15] Now notice this word to set your
[1:23:17] affection to set your affection actually
[1:23:20] that word affection comes from the Greek
[1:23:21] word fronel which actually which
[1:23:24] actually is the it means minded. It's
[1:23:26] the same words that's used in the
[1:23:28] scriptures. uh uh scriptures like these
[1:23:30] to set your affection on or to be
[1:23:32] carefully minded or to be likeminded to
[1:23:35] be of one mind and one accord to be of
[1:23:37] the same mind or to let this mind be in
[1:23:39] you that was in Christ all of those
[1:23:41] words was the same words so so when you
[1:23:43] say to set your affection in other words
[1:23:45] it means to set your mind I in other
[1:23:48] words brother Mark it it ain't talking
[1:23:50] about your feelings it ain't talking
[1:23:52] about the the senses because it's so
[1:23:54] easy for us to go by that it's so easy
[1:23:56] to judge things by these five by these
[1:23:59] five senses. But Paul's talking about a
[1:24:01] supernatural thing. He's talking about
[1:24:03] things above and not things on the
[1:24:04] earth. So, can I tell you a secret? Your
[1:24:06] five senses were not made for you to
[1:24:08] contact supernatural things. They
[1:24:10] weren't made for you to contact things
[1:24:12] above. That's why you can't go by your
[1:24:14] feelings. Your feelings lie to you.
[1:24:16] That's why you can't go by your
[1:24:17] emotions. Your emotions lie to you. You
[1:24:19] can't go by see, taste, feel, smell, and
[1:24:22] hear. Those things were given your
[1:24:24] natural body in order to contact this
[1:24:26] natural realm. They're made for you to
[1:24:28] make contact with the earthly things. An
[1:24:31] earthly body make contact with earthly
[1:24:33] things. But God gave you another sense
[1:24:35] outside of those five senses called
[1:24:37] faith. It's a super sense. And God gave
[1:24:39] us that sense in order to contact
[1:24:42] another realm. That's why Paul SAID WE
[1:24:44] HAD A WAY TO CONTACT GOD. GOD IS NOT
[1:24:46] UNREACHABLE. HE'S NOT JUST on a throne
[1:24:48] somewhere that you can't reach him. But
[1:24:50] a prophet of God said his spirit IS HERE
[1:24:52] WITH US. HIS LIFE IS WALKING AMONG THE
[1:24:54] CHURCH. AND THE FAITH THAT'S IN EVERY
[1:24:56] BELIEVER CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH GOD.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; He gave us a sense to be able to know
[1:25:02] that God is present. It ain't by my
[1:25:04] feelings. Stop going by your feelings.
[1:25:05] I'm I may as well just preach to you
[1:25:06] THIS MORNING. STOP GOING BY YOUR
[1:25:08] FEELINGS. STOP TRYING TO GET GOOSEBUMPS
[1:25:10] TO THINK WHETHER I GOT I PRAYED ENOUGH
[1:25:11] THAT I FELT SOME GOOSEBUMPS AND NOW I
[1:25:13] GOT THROUGH WITH GOD. QUIT GOING BY YOUR
[1:25:15] FEELINGS AND GO BY YOUR FAITH AND CLAIM
[1:25:17] THE WORD OF GOD AND SPEAK God's word and
[1:25:20] pray until THE HOLY GHOST FALLS IN the
[1:25:22] room. AND THEN YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY
[1:25:23] ABOUT WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE CUZ YOU WON'T
[1:25:25] BE ABLE TO FEEL IT ANYHOW WHEN THE HOLY
[1:25:27] GHOST GETS a hold of you.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Quit going by our feelings.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; It ain't a feeling gospel.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; It ain't a touch and a feel and a smell.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; It's our faith.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; It's not made to touch supernatural
[1:25:40] things. You see, when dealing with the
[1:25:41] supernatural, the supernatural, many
[1:25:43] times it defies our natural senses.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? It defies our natural
[1:25:48] senses. Your natural senses I I don't
[1:25:51] mean to bear down here.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Do I got a minute?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Your natural senses lie to you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's hard to understand, is it? It's
[1:25:58] hard to You mean I can feel something
[1:26:00] and it ain't real? Yes.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You mean I You mean I can hear something
[1:26:03] and it wasn't real? Yes. Your natural
[1:26:05] senses will lie to you. Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; So, see, so it defies our natural
[1:26:11] senses. That's what happened to the
[1:26:12] woman at the well. Remember when Jesus
[1:26:14] came there? It would defy the natural
[1:26:16] sense for somebody to tell you
[1:26:19] everything that happened in your life
[1:26:20] and how many husbands that you had and
[1:26:22] where you came. It defies the natural
[1:26:24] feeling or the natural senses. Your mind
[1:26:26] would wonder how how could you know
[1:26:28] these things immediately? What would
[1:26:29] your mind go to if if you start telling
[1:26:31] somebody what they did yesterday and
[1:26:33] what they were thinking and what they
[1:26:34] looked at and all and you start telling
[1:26:35] them all of a sudden their mind goes to
[1:26:37] how did you know that where who told you
[1:26:39] or maybe because our our our natural
[1:26:41] feelings and our natural thoughts has to
[1:26:43] have a way to make it happen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; You see so it defies the natural but
[1:26:48] this lady she went beyond the natural
[1:26:50] into a supernatural. She said I know
[1:26:52] that when the Messiah comes he would do
[1:26:55] these things. In other words I don't
[1:26:56] have no answer in the natural. I have no
[1:26:58] way. There's no way you can know that. I
[1:27:00] have no way to explain it. I have no way
[1:27:02] that that that's why I don't understand
[1:27:03] people that can't accept the
[1:27:04] supernatural. Their their eyes must just
[1:27:06] be blinded to the truth because when I
[1:27:08] see it, I say there's no natural way to
[1:27:10] explain it. So, it must be supernatural.
[1:27:12] And if it's supernatural, it didn't come
[1:27:14] from the devil, but it came from God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It's supernatural.
[1:27:19] So, when a supernatural come, it blinded
[1:27:21] their eyes. His miracles and things
[1:27:23] blinded their eyes. But says the same
[1:27:25] thing today. He blinds the eyes of the
[1:27:27] carnal mind because it can't understand
[1:27:29] the things of God.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Because the carnal mind is against God.
[1:27:33] The Bible says it's an enemy. The human
[1:27:36] mind is an enemy to God. He said you got
[1:27:38] to get out of your own human mind and be
[1:27:39] born a new by the Holy Spirit and get
[1:27:42] the mind of God in you and then you can
[1:27:45] believe those things.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; It's the only way you'll ever believe
[1:27:47] the supernatural. Paul said, "Let this
[1:27:48] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:27:51] Jesus." And when you get the mind of
[1:27:53] God, brother Mark, then the things of
[1:27:55] God become a reality.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I'm about to close.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; When you get the mind of God, the things
[1:28:01] of God become a reality.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; When you think on the things of God, it
[1:28:06] brings him near.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something that most of the time
[1:28:10] what the devil does is he causes us to
[1:28:12] focus and think on negative things. You
[1:28:15] ever notice that? You sit around by
[1:28:16] yourself long enough, you don't have to
[1:28:18] raise your hand. But I don't ain't no
[1:28:19] sense in everybody raising their hands
[1:28:21] this morning. I'll save you the trouble.
[1:28:22] But every time we sit around by oursel,
[1:28:24] why is it that negative thoughts always
[1:28:26] come? Why this happened and that
[1:28:28] happened? Why' they do that? Why' they
[1:28:29] say that? Negative thoughts always come.
[1:28:32] So, see, it ain't it ain't our fault.
[1:28:33] That's just the devil always bringing
[1:28:34] negative thoughts and trying to get you
[1:28:36] to focus on the negative and get your
[1:28:38] mind to be on negative things. But
[1:28:39] remember said he said the reason he does
[1:28:41] it, listen. He said because you cannot
[1:28:43] get anything from God with a negative
[1:28:45] thought. So what Satan is trying to do
[1:28:47] is to keep you from getting anything
[1:28:49] from God knowing that you can't get
[1:28:51] anything with a negative thought. So he
[1:28:52] brings these negative thoughts. But
[1:28:54] listen what Paul said. He gives us the
[1:28:55] way out. He says finally brethren
[1:28:57] whatsoever things are true. Whatsoever
[1:28:59] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[1:29:02] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:29:04] whatever things are lovely, whatever
[1:29:05] things are of good report, if there be
[1:29:08] any virtue, if there be any praise,
[1:29:10] think on these things.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Set your mind,
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; your affections on things above.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible tells us the story
[1:29:23] of the man blind, Barnameus. How many
[1:29:25] knows the story? You know, he was a man
[1:29:28] that was looking to be healed.
[1:29:31] Here he sat by that road for so many
[1:29:34] years of his life, decades
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; that had gone by that he had sat there.
[1:29:38] You know, Barnameus, he wasn't born
[1:29:40] blind. He was actually blinded as a
[1:29:42] young man, whether a disease or
[1:29:44] something that had happened. But
[1:29:45] according to the way he asked for
[1:29:47] healing, they would say he wasn't born
[1:29:49] blind. He had just became blind. And in
[1:29:52] this that he when he would ask Jesus for
[1:29:53] his healing, he would ask to regain his
[1:29:56] sight. But here he would sit in Jericho
[1:29:59] as a beggar and and you know I thought
[1:30:01] about him sitting there in this place
[1:30:03] and after this sitting in this place all
[1:30:05] of his life sitting there wrapped up in
[1:30:07] that old beggar cloak and begging for a
[1:30:09] little bit and blinded in his natural
[1:30:11] eye and didn't have nothing. Didn't feel
[1:30:13] like nothing. Wasn't worth nothing. I
[1:30:15] thought as he sat there and maybe like
[1:30:17] some of us feel sometimes but you know
[1:30:19] even by his own name it would his own
[1:30:21] name would defy what he felt like you
[1:30:23] know because the the name Barameus the
[1:30:24] name bar in Hebrew means son so that
[1:30:26] tells you he's somebody and the name
[1:30:28] Tomus means valuable or honorable so so
[1:30:30] so Barardameus he was a son and he was
[1:30:32] valuable whether he felt like it or not
[1:30:34] here he was a beggar he had sat all that
[1:30:36] time sitting there as a beggar on the
[1:30:38] wayside and and brother man would tell
[1:30:40] this story of how that he was sitting
[1:30:41] there waiting and he would he would
[1:30:43] think here he was in Jericho and And he
[1:30:45] would get to thinking about Joshua and
[1:30:47] how that that that that they come by uh
[1:30:50] that day and that that great army of
[1:30:52] Israel and and they came in there where
[1:30:53] Rahab was in bondage and and he got to
[1:30:56] thinking about how that they had walked
[1:30:57] around there, that great army of Israel
[1:30:59] and how they were getting ready to come
[1:31:01] in and take this uh this great city of
[1:31:03] Jericho and said as he as he sat there
[1:31:05] and he thought about it and thought here
[1:31:07] Joshua was out there that day and he was
[1:31:09] waiting on waiting for the Lord uh to
[1:31:12] give instruction. he was getting
[1:31:14] prepared to go into battle and and he
[1:31:16] would think about that story and he
[1:31:17] said, you know, while he was thinking
[1:31:18] about it, he remembered how that he was
[1:31:20] told that while Joshua was waiting by
[1:31:22] the wall, all of a sudden there appeared
[1:31:24] a man and Joshua he drew a man with his
[1:31:27] sword drawn and Joshua pulled out his
[1:31:29] sword. He said he said, "Are you with us
[1:31:31] or are you one of our enemies? Are you
[1:31:33] for us or against us?" He said, "And all
[1:31:35] and and then he heard them say, he said,
[1:31:38] no, but I am the captain of the host of
[1:31:40] the Lord." said, "And then Joshua threw
[1:31:42] down his sword and he fell down at his
[1:31:44] feet before the Lord's captain." He
[1:31:46] said, "Here, Barnameus was sitting in
[1:31:47] Jericho and he was thinking about Joshua
[1:31:50] and thinking about the captain of the
[1:31:52] Lord's host." I thought, "Isn't it
[1:31:53] something?" He said, while he was
[1:31:55] sitting there blind, and while he was
[1:31:56] sitting there begging, he said, "Blind
[1:31:58] Barnameus started thinking." I thought I
[1:32:01] thought, "Isn't that something?" He
[1:32:02] started thinking on something else. He
[1:32:04] wasn't thinking about his condition. He
[1:32:05] stopped thinking about his natural
[1:32:07] condition. He stopped thinking about the
[1:32:09] world and the things that are going on
[1:32:10] around it. He said, "But blind Barnameus
[1:32:13] started thinking." He said he was at 500
[1:32:15] yards from where I'm sitting right now.
[1:32:17] The captain of the Lord's host stood one
[1:32:19] day just a few hundred years ago. He
[1:32:21] said, "Oh, if I could have been back
[1:32:23] there that day and I could have made it
[1:32:24] to the tent and I in my blindness and I
[1:32:27] could have got a hold of the captain of
[1:32:29] the Lord's host, I believe I could have
[1:32:31] asked him to heal me of my blindness and
[1:32:33] he would have gave me back my sight."
[1:32:35] But the ram said, "But little did he
[1:32:36] know that while he was sitting there
[1:32:38] thinking that THAT THAT SAME CAPTAIN WAS
[1:32:41] JUST A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM HIM, he
[1:32:43] heard the testimonies of what Jesus had
[1:32:45] done." He turn he heard of the healing.
[1:32:48] He heard of the works of God. And as he
[1:32:50] was sit on there, HE SAID, "THAT'S WHAT
[1:32:52] MAKES our failures tonight." He said,
[1:32:53] "We try to place the glory of Christ way
[1:32:56] back into another age." But the Bible
[1:32:57] said he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:00] forever. He's just as much here in this
[1:33:03] building today as he was when he ever
[1:33:05] walked on Galilee or he ever walked in
[1:33:07] the city of Jerusalem. The Bible said,
[1:33:09] "And while he was thinking on this, all
[1:33:11] of a sudden, because he was thinking on
[1:33:13] the right thing, he called out to Jesus,
[1:33:15] thou son of David, have mercy on me."
[1:33:18] And the Bible said here when he would
[1:33:20] come out, don't you realize that Jesus
[1:33:22] couldn't even have heard him holler?
[1:33:23] They said there was a great many number
[1:33:26] a vast number of people around him
[1:33:28] praising and worshiping and following
[1:33:30] and begging and over by the wayside set
[1:33:32] one man that said Jesus thou son of
[1:33:34] David have mercy and the Bible SAYS BUT
[1:33:36] HIS FAITH STOPPED JESUS
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and he bid him to come and when he bid
[1:33:42] him to come the Bible said there that
[1:33:44] man he he he turned around and he threw
[1:33:46] his garment aside he casted away his
[1:33:49] garment and he rose and he came to
[1:33:51] Jesus. I thought, "Isn't this something
[1:33:54] as a music player's come? Isn't it
[1:33:56] something that he was sitting in that
[1:33:58] condition all this time?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; But he got to thinking about the right
[1:34:01] thing."
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Got to thinking if the captain of the
[1:34:04] Lord's host
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; was here,
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; he could change my situation.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; If the captain of the Lord's host was
[1:34:11] here, he could give me healing. If the
[1:34:14] captain of the Lord's host was here, he
[1:34:16] could give me deliverance. He He could
[1:34:17] He could He could give me a change in my
[1:34:19] body. IF THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S host
[1:34:21] was here, but while he thought on that,
[1:34:24] the captain walked near.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; My hallelujah.
[1:34:28] Why he thought on it? The captain, he
[1:34:30] walked near and when Jesus bit him.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't this something he gave him an
[1:34:35] invitation?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; He worked himself up. Brother Brian, he
[1:34:39] thought on it so much and until he
[1:34:41] couldn't even hold himself back. He
[1:34:43] thought on it so much till finally he
[1:34:45] went from saying alms. Alms arms. That's
[1:34:48] the only thing he knew how to say. Alms.
[1:34:51] I've been a beggar 30 years. Arms. Alms.
[1:34:53] Alms. But he got under such inspiration.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Thinking on the things of God. Got under
[1:35:00] such inspiration thinking about this
[1:35:02] great captain
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; of God's army that all of a sudden his
[1:35:07] his voice changed.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; And out of his mouth, I don't even know
[1:35:10] if he meant to say it. Jesus, thou son
[1:35:14] of David, have mercy on me. How do you
[1:35:16] even know what to say? But his faith
[1:35:19] reached the throne of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you who it reached. It
[1:35:24] reached the captain
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and the captain heard him. And that same
[1:35:28] one, I thought, "Oh my." Jesus walked
[1:35:31] down that path before. That same captain
[1:35:34] that stood there before Joshua that
[1:35:36] said, "As I was with Moses, so shall I
[1:35:38] be with thee. You're going to go over
[1:35:40] into that land. You're not going to lose
[1:35:41] a one. You just follow exactly what I
[1:35:44] tell you to do. That same captain that
[1:35:45] gave him the order how they would take
[1:35:47] over that city of Jericho. That same
[1:35:50] captain step by step, he said bid him to
[1:35:54] come.
[1:35:55] The Bible said he threw off that beggar
[1:35:57] cloak. You know what that means? You
[1:36:00] know what a beggar cloak was? The beggar
[1:36:02] didn't have nothing. And when you read
[1:36:05] through history, it'll actually tell you
[1:36:07] that the cloak of a beggar was their
[1:36:09] most valuable material possession.
[1:36:13] It was the most valuable thing they had.
[1:36:15] It's what identified them as a beggar.
[1:36:18] It's what allowed them to sit by the
[1:36:19] wayside. It's what they used to cover up
[1:36:22] in the winter time. They didn't have
[1:36:23] nothing. They were just beggars.
[1:36:25] But it was the most valuable thing that
[1:36:27] he had.
[1:36:28] Certainly, it was something that he had
[1:36:31] spent his life using and pondering and
[1:36:34] hiding in and hiding under. But now all
[1:36:37] of a sudden, when the captain came near,
[1:36:41] under such an inspiration, his mind
[1:36:44] wasn't thinking about being a beggar
[1:36:45] tomorrow. He wasn't thinking about what
[1:36:48] would happen to his cloak if he threw it
[1:36:49] aside. No doubt there's another beggar
[1:36:50] right by him that would love to have a
[1:36:52] cloak like that. Just grab it and scurry
[1:36:54] off with it. You can't let your
[1:36:56] possessions lay in the midst of a bunch
[1:36:59] of beggars.
[1:37:01] And he laid down as the most valuable
[1:37:03] possession. He, the Bible said, he cast
[1:37:06] it aside. You know what that means? He
[1:37:08] he didn't just gently lay it. It was
[1:37:11] covering him. And he said he bid you to
[1:37:15] come. He stood up and he took his beggar
[1:37:18] garment and he threw it aside and he
[1:37:21] went on his way to find the captain that
[1:37:25] was waiting to meet him there. He wasn't
[1:37:27] going back looking for that no more.
[1:37:29] When he made it to the feet of Jesus,
[1:37:32] Jesus said, "What would you have?" said
[1:37:34] that I would receive my sight.
[1:37:37] He said, "Go thy way, son, for your
[1:37:40] faith has made you whole."
[1:37:42] Isn't it something? Jesus said, "You go
[1:37:44] your way. Go your way. It's up to you,
[1:37:48] Barameus. Go thy way." And the Bible
[1:37:51] said his eyes came open and he followed
[1:37:54] Jesus along the way.
[1:37:57] He made his way Jesus's way. So, I don't
[1:38:01] have my own way no more. I've given my
[1:38:02] life to you. I threw my old life away. I
[1:38:05] I threw my my most valuable possession
[1:38:07] away. The very thing that held me to
[1:38:09] being a beggar. THE VERY THING THAT KEPT
[1:38:11] ME ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THAT KEPT ME
[1:38:13] FROM BEING WHO YOU WANTED ME TO BE. I
[1:38:14] LAID IT DOWN. I CAST IT ASIDE AND I MET
[1:38:18] THE CAPTAIN. I SAID, "WHEREVER YOU GO,
[1:38:20] I'LL GO. WHERE YOU STAND, I'LL STAND.
[1:38:23] WHERE YOU DIE, I'LL DIE." FOR I MET THE
[1:38:25] CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST. Won't you
[1:38:28] stand to your feet this morning?
[1:38:30] He said, "When he thought on those
[1:38:32] things,
[1:38:33] his approach changed."
[1:38:36] Oh my friends. He didn't approach Jesus
[1:38:39] as a beggar. He approached him as a free
[1:38:42] man on his way to get his inheritance.
[1:38:45] Jesus didn't ask you to come as a
[1:38:47] beggar. He asked you to come as a son of
[1:38:50] God. He didn't ask you to come begging
[1:38:52] and begging him and pleading God to give
[1:38:54] you the Holy Ghost or or to give you the
[1:38:56] spirit of God. It ain't something that
[1:38:58] you have to beg for. It's something he
[1:38:59] already paid a price. He already gave it
[1:39:01] to you before you ever asked for it. It
[1:39:04] ain't how much you beg. It's just laying
[1:39:06] the cloak aside.
[1:39:09] Lay the cloak aside. Whatever it is that
[1:39:12] hold you to this life and the things of
[1:39:14] this flesh and set your affections
[1:39:17] [music] upon the things above.
[1:39:22] But Ram said, "It's why we're thinking
[1:39:23] on him."
[1:39:25] He said, "That's the trouble of the
[1:39:26] world today. We think about everything
[1:39:28] else but him and then we wonder why we
[1:39:31] don't get blessings.
[1:39:33] You think about this. The great
[1:39:34] supernatural
[1:39:36] ministry that brother Vanham had. Can I
[1:39:38] tell you this one more thing? The great
[1:39:41] all the supernatural things that
[1:39:42] happened in his ministry. Let me show
[1:39:44] you where that came from. He said, "A
[1:39:47] few weeks ago, about three weeks ago, I
[1:39:50] sat down by some sycamore trees and I
[1:39:53] began to think,
[1:39:55] wasn't thinking about the world and the
[1:39:57] things of the world, but thinking about
[1:39:59] the things of God." He said, "And it was
[1:40:02] there when I started to think that for
[1:40:04] the first time, he came and declared his
[1:40:08] new ministry unto me." Isn't that
[1:40:10] something as simple as just sitting down
[1:40:13] and thinking on the things of God? He
[1:40:16] said, "That's what David wrote." He
[1:40:17] said, "The commandments, write his
[1:40:19] commandments on your bedpost and
[1:40:20] meditate on them day and night." That's
[1:40:22] what the church ought to do. It would
[1:40:24] keep your heart tuned in with God day
[1:40:25] and night. And that's when he appears to
[1:40:29] think. Set your affections on the things
[1:40:33] above.
[1:40:35] When I think about the Lord,
[1:40:40] how he saved [singing] me, how [music]
[1:40:43] he raised me, how he filled me with the
[1:40:47] Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the
[1:40:52] uttermost. And when I think about
[1:40:55] [music and singing] the Lord,
[1:40:57] how he pick me up and turn me around,
[1:41:02] how he place my feet
[1:41:05] on solid ground.
[1:41:10] When I think about the Lord, [singing]
[1:41:14] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:41:18] he filled me,
[1:41:22] how he healed [singing] me [music] to
[1:41:24] the uttermost. And when I think about
[1:41:28] the Lord,
[1:41:30] how he picked me up and turned me
[1:41:33] around, how [music] he place my feet
[1:41:37] on solid ground.
[1:41:40] It makes me want to shout.
[1:41:43] Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:41:45] Thank you, [music] Jesus. Lord, you're
[1:41:48] worthy of all the glory, all of the
[1:41:51] [singing and music] honor, all of my
[1:41:53] praise.
[1:41:55] It makes [singing] me want to shout
[1:41:59] hallelujah.
[1:42:01] Thank you, Jesus. [music]
[1:42:03] Lord, you're worthy [singing] of all the
[1:42:05] glory, all of the honor, all of my
[1:42:09] praise.
[1:42:11] Oh, when I think.
[1:42:16] Oh, how he save me.
[1:42:21] How he feel [singing] me,
[1:42:24] how he heal me to the
[1:42:27] [singing and music] uttermost. And when
[1:42:29] I think about the Lord,
[1:42:32] how he pick me up [singing and music]
[1:42:34] and turn me around. How we place my feet
[1:42:39] on solid ground.
[1:42:42] It makes me [music and singing] want to
[1:42:44] shout
[1:42:46] hallelujah.
[1:42:48] Thank you, Jesus. [music and singing]
[1:42:50] Lord, you're worthy of all the glory.
[1:42:54] [music]
[1:43:11] Oh, I pray.
[1:43:13] See, when you go to think about the
[1:43:16] Lord, he said, begin to think like this.
[1:43:19] Just say, I'm start thinking that you're
[1:43:22] one of his children and that he saved
[1:43:24] you and he's good to you and you love
[1:43:27] him and he loves you. Don't just wait
[1:43:30] till you go to church or some convenient
[1:43:32] hour. Just keep him on your mind all the
[1:43:35] time. When you think about the Lord,
[1:43:38] think, Lord, I'm your I'm your son. I'm
[1:43:40] your daughter. Lord, you called me out
[1:43:42] of this world. Lord, you saved me.
[1:43:44] You've established me. Lord, you sent a
[1:43:46] message in this hour to to call me out.
[1:43:48] Lord Lord, you you you love me and I
[1:43:50] love you. So, don't just wait. It's the
[1:43:53] most wonderful experience you can ever
[1:43:55] have. He said, ' If you ever, I trust
[1:43:57] everybody here has experienced him that
[1:43:58] that many times. If you haven't, this
[1:44:00] would be a good day to start. Just start
[1:44:03] thinking about him and worship him in
[1:44:05] your heart. And all of a sudden, you'll
[1:44:07] feel the close fellowship of the Holy
[1:44:09] Spirit around you. And it gets so
[1:44:11] anointed until you can't hold it any
[1:44:12] longer. And you'll raise up your hands
[1:44:14] or do something. You just can't stand
[1:44:16] still. When Jesus comes by, he's the
[1:44:20] captain of the Lord's host.
[1:44:23] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:44:27] he fill me with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:44:32] Don't it just do it to you this morning?
[1:44:34] When you start thinking of the Lord when
[1:44:35] I about the Lord,
[1:44:39] how he picked [singing and music] me up
[1:44:41] and turned me around. He placed my feet
[1:44:46] on solid ground.
[1:44:49] It makes me want to shout.
[1:44:52] Hallelujah. [singing and music]
[1:44:54] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:44:58] all.
[1:45:26] Save me. [singing]
[1:45:28] Raise me. [music]
[1:45:30] Fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:36] to the uttermost ghost. When I think
[1:45:39] [music and singing] about the Lord,
[1:45:42] how he picked me up [music] to turn me
[1:45:45] around. [singing] Place my body
[1:45:49] on solid ground. [singing]
[1:45:52] It makes me want to [music] shout.
[1:45:55] Hallelujah.
[1:45:57] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:59] You're [singing] worthy [music] of all
[1:46:01] the glory.
[1:46:04] Oh, and all my praise.
[1:46:08] It makes me want to shout [singing]
[1:46:11] hallelujah.
[1:46:13] [music] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:46:15] You're worthy all the glory. [music]
[1:46:20] Oh, and all our praise.
[1:46:24] When I think about [music]
[1:46:27] the Lord,
[1:46:29] how he saved [singing]
