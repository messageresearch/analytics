do I have of that still the same yesterday today and forever it's a real honor to be here and uh we have just enjoyed the services immensely and um it wasn't that just a a tremendous outpouring of

richly bless you and we just love and appreciate each and every one of you uh very much and so if you have your Bible we will just uh turn over to Mark the 9th chapter and we'll begin reading uh from verse 17 just a real honor to preach uh with these brothers and brother Andrew brother Wayne Brother David silers just really looking forward to uh the sermon in the morning know we're going to be greatly blessed Mark the 9th chapter and uh beginning at verse 17 and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he tear him and he foth and nashthe and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he anth him and said oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child and of times it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou cast do anything have compassion on us and help us now notice the father is saying if thou cast do anything have compassion on us and help us but notice Jesus response Jesus said unto him if thou can believe so he's saying if thou can't do anything but Jesus is putting it back on in in his lap and saying if thou C believe all things are possible to him that believeth straight way the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe believe help thou mine unbelief now Mark the 11th chapter and we're just read from verse 22 down to verse 26 and Jesus answering saith unto him have faith in God or as the pro the prophet would give us the correct interpretation of that and say or have the faith of God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may have your seats but I'd like to just take for a uh thought challenged by the message of the hour and uh God has always always revealed his care for his children God is very concerned about you and I and he has sent the best thing that he could do to uh to provide uh help for us and to manifest his care for us and that is his word we find there in Psalms 107 and verse 20 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from the their destructions and David goes on and says oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing so the prophet would describe the age that we live in as a word age or the word age and so God has given us the very best thing that he could give us in this in this evening time and that is his word and it is for our healing it is for our deliverance it is for our joy it's and it's for our homes it's for the individual lives it's for marriages it's for and it's for our counseling it's for re reproof rebuke whatever we have need of is found in the word of God and and should produce a joy in our hearts it should produce a praise in our hearts because we have found the answer we have found what our soul has been longing for we see that when God came down in human flesh to manifest his care for us it says that he he went about healing all that were oppressed of the devil and and we find that uh he find he came preaching that this is is the Year of Jubilee he came to say that the anointing is upon me and and I've come to preach Deliverance to those that are captive and and to loose those that are in bondage and and and you see that is what the word made manifest does the word when it is made manifest it always brings Deliverance it always sets those that are in captivity those that are in prison houses it opens the doors and it and it brings you out of bondage into the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God we find that the word for every age has brought a challenge to the believer and that is simply if thou can't believe we find that the prophet would say that God's only provided plan for any age is his word so I I don't care how many substitutes I don't care how much we try to add to God's program but it's still the same today that the only plan for God Amen for his sons is the word of God we find that Paul said that Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God the prophet would answer the question of what is Faith well faith is something that's Reve to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation amen the prophet again would say faith is a revelation from God he would say he has revealed it to you by his grace now now catch this he's revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's GI to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the Revelation amen then we find that the Gates of Hell will never Prevail over that Revelation because it is a faith it is something that is an absolute in your heart and it's unmovable it's unshakable it is something that it's only give by the grace of God God's grace to you is Faith is a revelation now we find that the prophet would say I want you to get built up now in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up amen so we see that it is God that is going to give us a revelation that is for the Rapture amen this is God's grace that is given to the Church of the Living God and that is a faith a translating Faith a body changing Faith a faith that can take you from Mortal to immortality from corruption to incorruption can take you from a world that is falling apart that you don't know how you're going to make it you don't know how you're going to get to the next day but this is a revelation that God has given the Church of the Living God that when all hell this sells this church when all hell is trying to torment your mind and trying to weaken your resolve and try to shake your families this is a revelation uh that you can stabilize your hearts stabilize your homes and look upward uh because God is coming for a bride that has a faith you see Peter would say it like this amen wherefore GT up the loins of your mind and be sober yes sir and hope to the end or have an expectation look to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ amen so this must be the same thing that Jesus was talking about when he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man and so Peter is showing that when the son of man is is revealed there is going to be a Grace that is given to the church amen you see amen when the world is coming to its end when the systems of the world is coming to its end when the politics of the nations are corrupt and the world has just went into insanity but yet look to the end for when in the evening time there shall be light there shall be a revelation there shall be an anointing that'll sweep over the church that will give a Grace it's something that you didn't earn it's something that you didn't work up to it's not something that you are good enough uh but it's an election it's a people that's been called out for his name Sak because you are his chosen elect lady and he's brought a sweep of Grace over your life you see amen Jesus would take us as it was in the days of lot amen sodomy filth but yet there is an elect on the backside of the desert with a promise there is a if I could put it this way a Son of God that has been fellowshipping with God around a promise oh oh how the devil tried to disturb him and distract him and try to discourage him from that promise amen he could look at the weakness of his own body he can look at the deadness of Sarah's womb he can look at the grumbling of the complaining and all the bickering and all the problems Satan trying to discourage him from what was coming down that road but I'll tell you what was coming down that road Grace was coming down that road it was a revelation that Elohim was made flesh uh and he was going to appear to Abraham uh and say I remember my promise uh oh Church aren't you glad that in the evening time uh God has appeared to us H and said I remember my promise uh I remember that I'm going to have a bride with that spot with that wrinkle with that blemish uh I remember that I said I'm going to restore all things and I'm going to restore the garden of Eden I'm going to restore sunship I'm going to restore you back to manifested sons of God Amen yes sir oh yes sir we got something to Fellowship around oh yes sir when the Elohim was revealed oh it changed things the word being revealed through a prophet is God's grace to the church the Revelation released favor upon your life and it was something that you didn't Merit it's unmerited undeserving favor of God oh praise the name of the Lord I think of that woman of ill Fame amen just a just a prostitute but you see Jesus was invited to to simeon's place and they just wanted to make a mockery of him amen they they they called him be El we heard about it last night and there he is sitting in the corner with dirty feet but you see to this woman of ill Fame just a prostitute amen undeserving nothing good about her life that anyone would look at her and say my she's worthy of Grace she's worthy of God's love there is nothing good about her but you see there was something about election there was a seed that was placed within her soul before the foundation of the world and it was placed there by predestination uh and a revelation uh came into her heart all the sudden something swept over her and she said my that must be the Messiah amen and she began amen she begin to take some oil and buy with her o with her money and and we know the story and how she must have snuck through and she ends up before Jesus and she begins to wash Jesus feet with her tears and and dry his feet with her hair and everyone is just in just gawking at her and looking at the scene and criticizing in their heart amen but it was Jesus that say Simeon where much is given there or where much is forgiven much is is loved oh yes her grace Came Upon her life and he said I forgive you I don't condemn you I am not judging you but I am forgiving you amen I tell you friends at the revelation of who is in our midst it is Jesus Christ it is God himself uh that is heal tabernacling in human flesh again in momies and daddies and boys and girls there's a Grace that God has placed within [Applause] us if we could only realize is the prophet of God now the presence of God unrecognized if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us how many can say you've got some desires but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word of this age is made manifest not the promised word of Moses age or any other of the other age is the promise of the word for this age you see when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise so what is the vision of the invisible God it is the promised word of this age made manifest that's how you see God you see his character you see that he's unchanging you see that he is the same I am that I am and his word has been made visible it's been made plain it's been made clear it is not something that we're just we're just uh guessing at in the Bible but you see the word word the correct interpretation of the scripture has been made visible we are not guessing at it we're not trying to probe at it we now have a Vindicated message we have seen God the same word that was made manifest 2,000 years ago now made visible among ush and they crucified him then and they crucified him today but it had to be that the bloody bleeding word could come into a full ofth that there would be an atonement uh to wash away our unbelief uh to call us out of all of the Dead traditions of Leia that we could believe the word and see this word made manifest in our [Applause] lives praise the name of the Lord amen you see the Bible says that when the headstone we see The Headstone coming appearing we cry Grace Grace unto it the prophet of God would say now in this last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation the most important revelation of godhead is the whole Bible that is Jesus Is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and he is the god of the amen and he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast and there is some people that are saying Amen to it that are going to prove to Satan that we are not like the first Eve but there is another Eve that has come up in the last days that says Amen to the word I am the god that Health all thy diseases Amen to the word I am the god God that has given you a token by that same token you can lift it up with your unwavering faith and claim your children you can apply it to your home yes sir we believe it amen I am your joy I am your deliverance I am your counselor I am the I am I am the promised word in Moses day I am the promised word in Noah's day I am the promised word in Jesus day and I am the promised word in the last days that is giv Grace to wipe away all unbelief uh de clear all the filthiness of that Harlot system that held you bound but now we're free to believe the word to whom the son the word has set free made us free we're free [Music] indeed you see you got to look right it's how you look at it we heard about that it's all about your perception Hallelujah you see they took a picture of what happened on Sunset Mountain but they had it all wrong come on even the prophet wasn't looking at it just right everyone else was looking at the picture and didn't have it just right but you see it took the angel of the Lord to say you got turn it the right way well I thought that I had it the right way no you got to turn it right and when he turned it right the perception completely changed it was Jesus Christ seven angels that had the face of Jesus Christ showing that at the opening of the word you are looking into the re revelation of the face of Jesus Christ I tell you friends the prophet of God in alone us now he's looking to his right just as Jesus on the cross looked to his right and gave a pardon to that Thief Hallelujah I'm telling you friends you are looking at your pardon at the revelation of Jesus Christ this message is your pardon we're not we're not a part of serpent SE we're not a part of the foolish version we've been identified as the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you got to look at it right you got to look at it the way he sees you you got to stop looking at your faults you got to stop looking at your mistakes you got to stop looking at the past you got to look through the eyes of the revealed word and see how God sees you you are pardon you are spot you are washed beneath the blood oh my Seven Ages hoped for this Revelation but God rich in Mercy knew that you would fight the greatest battles ever fought so he preserved this Revelation to stabilize you stabilize your minds why are you the only people that is SA in this world why are you the only people when yet you're fighting sickness you're fighting oppression you're fighting discouragement but you're still here I tell you it's the grace of God it's nothing you did it's not you pulling yourself up by your boot straps every morning and and whatever it is the grace of God that is keeping you stabilizing you keeping you from from being blown away by many Winds of [Music] Doctrine you see it's a pardon the prophet would say this is my message to the church now he says you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every tit how many can say I'm standing on the word of God every amen every jot every [Music] TT where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place he have not beeld iniquity in jacobah it didn't say his changed name Israel he said Jacob Jacob's a Shyer right Jacob is the guy that you would think that would that would be cursed that would be cast out of the blessings of God but he has not beheld iniquity in Jacob why because there is an atonement there is a there is a Brazen serpent a smitten Rock and the Shad of the king is in the camp what a revelation has broke over our lives Hallelujah you know what iniquity is the things that you know not to do but you do it anyways do you realize that there's going to be a group of people that are saying hey open up to us amen o open up to us we we've come and and and God and Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity they knew the word they knew the truth amen but they wouldn't do it but there's another people amen there's a people that knows the truth but you're making mistakes sometimes you fall flat on your face and you're not trying to get there and say well I just did my way I I I knew your word and I knew what you said but I'm just going to I I thought it would be better to do it this way no sir but there's a people that is longing to manifest that word you're longing to you believe it with all that is within your heart and some days you fall flat on your face uh and the devil laughs at you and mocks you and criticizes and just boast as as one of those goliaths amen but I tell you a real Christian gets back up again and says I'm standing on the rock of Revelation it's unmovable it's not what I am it's not what I'll ever be it's by his grace I am saved no good about me stable amen you see it's a rapturing Grace the prophet of God would tell us he says pardon means completely erased not just turn aside and give something a try but it's erased it's gone not turned aside we have through pardon we are released not by psychology we're not released by a Creed we're not released by emotion but we are released through the power of Calvary we are pardoned free oh what it means to be free a burden off of your shoulders out of your heart a free person oh what it means to ripen under this Revelation to grow from glory to glory to see your faith growing in the revelation of the hour you're not getting weaker you're getting stronger you're not becoming a coward you're becoming more courageous you're not just a whip hiding behind something but now you're coming boldly before the throne of grace uh except acting the atonement accepting what this Revelation means to you you know who you are you see election looks back to for knowledge and predestination forward to Destiny you see Paul would say that we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world you see your position was Secure before the foundation of the world and today you have eternal life because you were an eternal thought in the mind of Elohim and Jesus came and said all that the father hath given me will come to me and I will not lose a one so we see the ministry of the son of man in the last days amen it's not threading not pulling here and there but it's a revelation all that the father hath given me will come to me you can't beat anyone into this Revelation you can't work it up into this Revelation it's just a Grace that is given into your heart some people can believe for their healing but others it's a Grace some people are completely transformed from what they used to be by grace and others are completely Reliant upon works and trying to work their way into just a good old mule religion but you see the prophet of God said we are not of that mule religion we are not ignorant we've been called out of ignorance and we've been come into the revelation of Jesus Christ we're not ignorant we see who we are we see our names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and no weapon formed against us can prosper we're secure you see it's the calling out of the Bride right and if we're going to look to the destiny then our destiny is adopted Sons you see because we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and Paul said we are predestinated unto the adoption of children and the fullness of our adoption is the body change therefore we come before God and we speak through the blood he only sees us he only sees us through the blood and he hears a voice speaking through the blood amen it's not what you think it's not how you see amen but it's what you're looking at what are you looking at amen you're looking at the face of Jesus Christ you're looking amen at a revelation that has part in your life and it's establish you in the faith adopted Sons adopted Sons doesn't mean perfect through your works but it means that you've been made perfect by the blood and you have been matured by this Revelation you see Jesus could do what he did because he understood the scriptures pertaining to his life and he could say search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me and the prophet of God says if he knew who he was then what about you and I as Believers we know who we are we're Believers then we accept the challenge of the message of this hour we are believers well what does the word say about this age we have come into a season of manifested Sons of God we've come into a season that we're not just in the carrier stage we are not in the tassle and we're not in the stalk and we're not in the sh we have come back to the grain life has come back into the grain then I accept the challenge of believing uh that the word is made flesh in this bride and we are the physical manifestation of the word of this hour Hallelujah people are looking for the bride trying to find the bride and yet here we are they're trying to see the word made manifest and yet here we are and the devil's pointing to every mistake you ever made every hangup you ever got every mind battle and yet you are purified you are spotless there is no shame held against you but the devil tries to hold you captive it's time to take the word and accept the challenge and say what Prophet said about your life say you're the Spotless sinless virtuous bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ qu put it off in the future accept the grace upon your life set the challenge of the age you see it's a prevailing Revelation he had a prevailing Revelation when he knew who he was he knew his purpose he knew that he was going to Calvary and you were in him when he was on the earth and he was walking the the streets and Healing The Sick and delivering the oppressed you were in him right and he knew you were in him and he prevailed come on Revelation the fifth chapter the lamb have prevailed to open the book and and John turned and he seen a line prevailed he turned he saw a lamb and it was a bloody bleeding lamb where where did he get the blood what what how did he get where was he torn he was torn a Calvary where he was prevailing over sin he was breaking through the strongholds of Satan that he had you captive and he had you just generational curses you know how powerful generational curses are if the devil can make you believe it well my great great grandfather my great-grandfather my grandfather and that's just the it's a generational curse and the devil tries to hold you captive saying that that's just it's just got to be that way because it just runs in your family tree do you realize that Jesus prevailed on Calvary to break that stronghold over your life he prevailed he didn't just try to Prevail he didn't just try to overcome he prevailed he overcome he broke through the stronghold the strongholds of hell he went down into Hell in a in in a theop body and took the keys of death hell and he rose up Victorious what is this message to the church because I live you live because I overcome you overcome because I am righteous you are righteous then through the opening of the word we have received a prevailing Revelation that by this revelation of the finished work of Calvary we can defeat Satan's lies defeat Satan's lies those lies that he been telling you you'll never be free you'll never have joy you'll never have love you'll never make the Forever The Rapture you got to take this prevailing Revelation and defeat the Devil by it well I don't feel strong you got to change your witness change your testimony for we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony you see he knew he knew that you were going to face the same Temptation that he face in the wilderness if thou be the Son of God how many has ever heard that [Music] one the devil keeps trying to keeps trying to tell you if thou be the bride do some trick prove it and then he tries to bring you through your family tree and and try to say how can you how can you be an overcomer and then he tries to bring you back a year ago and and and and a month ago even yesterday even maybe just a couple hours ago and he's over and over saying if thou be the Son of God if thou be the bride of Christ if you really are the elect lady and under the Temptation Of The Devil Satan stood he wasn't being he wasn't being tossed about but Satan but Jesus his position he understood who he was and he stood there and defeated the Devil by the word of God no anointing he was hungry that's right he didn't maybe even feel like a Son of God at the moment you see the reason that God sent a prophet in this age and so manifested his glory and his power through that redeemed vessel to let you know that the power of Calvary works that over and over he told us that his daddy was an alcoholic he took us through his family treat he took us through how he had a temper and and The Temper was so bad that he was going to kill a six or seven boys but God so took that vessel not some human power not some human Superman but a redeemed Son of God that God could wave over the church and say there's many more coming I'm going to have a bride that's surrendering themselves to this Revelation there isn't going to be any unbelief hinder them there's not going to be anything that can stop him they're going to be an invincible Army because they realize Satan is trying to defeat the power of God in their lives through his lies so you resist those lies if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith knowing who he was and he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestinated the predestinated bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order the Holy Spirit has been given therefore when Revelation the fourth chapter come about and we see that the angel is saying come up higher John hallelujah what is it John's a type of the bride and he's telling this bride you got to come up higher oh yeah yeah amen uh Lea is blind wretched miserable they've rejected me they kicked me out of the church age but PR but but little bride I'm going to call you out and I'm going to unite you around the headship of this word and this message is going to rule your life it's going to control your thinking it's going to govern your emotions oh sometimes your emotions get so haywired but there is head that in your heart is the word of God that brings that under subjection and says I am a Son of God I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus Hallelujah you see the word didn't come to push you down how many realizes that the word didn't come to push you down the word didn't come to beat you up the word didn't come to condemn your life the word came to Pardon you and lift you up for David said I was in a myy pit but God rich in Mercy got me out I was born in sin shaped in iniquity under some denominational lie but God cared for me and sent a revelation and broke the stronghold of hell and stabilized my life it's an absolute you see you're being lifted up by the word you see the prophet of God says we have followed the advancement of the Gospel from glory to glory right he says it's Advanced from justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the person of the Holy Ghost himself the word you see what it's done is it's brought us to the advancement of the church that there's nothing greater than the word right and we have grown up to the headship of the word then what's in the head is the [Applause] intelligence so God has advanced us into the intelligence that we can see who we are we can see what God's doing we can see that it's greater is he that is in me than he that is in this World we're not forsaken we're not rejected we are not cast aways but we have surrendered to the intelligence of Elohim your name's in there your peace your security it's in there therefore it's what you surrender yourself too the prophet of God says it's not me it's not me it's not me the seventh angel It's Christ as the son of man and I've only surrendered myself to him friends the only way that we have power to overcome the power to get out of this world is it's what we surrender ourselves to people are surrendering themselves to Hollywood Spirits surrendering themselves to political Spirits surrendering themselves to all kinds of influences all kinds of sess that are trying to rob them of their time Rob them of their energy Rob them of their mind but there's got to be a bride there's a people in the last days that has come into the intelligence of this revealed word and it's stabilizing us why would that's why Paul said think on these things what was he doing he was referring to what he what they were seeing in his own Ministry think on these things pure holy blameless the things that you've seen in me that's what Paul was saying and that's what Paul was referring to I'm an absolute to you I'm something that's going to stabilize you that we're not under law we're under grace we're not under Works we're not under something that we're trying to struggle and barely get by but he says I challenge you to get those things out of your mind and get your mind Center it upon Christ Center it upon the atonement Center it upon what God has given us in this hour you see you got to have the right attitude though the prophet of God talking about what happened on Mount on on on Sunset mountain and those seven angels He says what is it the quickening power coming to to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh God help us to receive it help us to it see it just depends on what attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not though you have to believe that you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good you see you got to you got to get out of the prison cell you you got to leave the past behind youen you got to leave the old traditions we weren't Redeemed by corruptible things we weren't Redeemed by Mama's Doctrine and even a preacher's Doctrine we're not we're we're not Redeemed by corruptible influences that's all that man is corruption that's all Traditions are corruption and Corruption sets into your life and it'll destroy your life with it but you got to break free of those strongholds leave it in the past Surrender Your Mind Surrender Your Heart Surrender Your Everything to this absolute amen you see the prophet of God would say we've come from justification Luther's age sanctification Wesley's age Pentecostal age done places gifts of the church and now appeared to us in our flesh as Jesus said he would don't be offended at him he's right on time John get out of that jail get out of that organization that don't believe in it pull the matters back off of your eyes you're a free man if you believe it he's right on time it shall be light in the evening time I tell you what we need to do is leave the old jail house behind the old jail house religion behind he sent his word he's healed your body he's healed your body spirit and soul but we got to get out of the jail get out of that thing that's holding you captive and trying to hold you back take the reveal word of the hour and press forward come into the advancement of the word the next thing is Rapture Hallelujah you see it all depends on our attitude the prophet of God would say in perfect Faith he says I just want to see how advanced my church is all right or what we believe in see just how advanced the people are how they're ready to take the sword and walk out on the front line now he's always talks about a preacher he says someone that's been trained by psychology and trained by some Creed or some Dogma they're not in the front lines oh yeah they're the guy that's in the back somewhere he said but someone who knows how to hold that two-handed that two-handed sword and go out in the front line and start whacking Devils see demons of Oppression taken off of your life see depression leave you see someone who's losing their mind come back into the right mind again not someone who's timid with it not someone who's worried about it but not ashamed not ashamed of the message of the hour not ashamed to press it out there and say there is no cancer demon that can stand before the two-edged sword of the word there is no depression devil that can stand before the two edged sword of the world there is no weapon formed against us can prosper before the word before people who are not victims we're not victims we need to kill that victim mentality that we're always trying to trying to get there trying to get there oh the pastor against me mama is against me everyone's against me they need to kill that thing and say I'm an overcomer greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world there is something in me that has given me a Grace to believe Grace to press this word out there and see it manifest see it manifest in mama daddy boy girl we're Overcomers been given Grace to press the battle well I got so many I I just get fed up with it sir all you hear about these days is well they did this to me and they said this about me you you you tell someone that hey you know you think that she's a she's a woman you you you treat her like a woman come to find out she identifies as a man they get all offended at you yeah how was I supposed to know yeah you look like a woman to me now we take that same kind of a spirit in the church and you're supposed to treat people as if they're offended all the time and you don't I didn't know you were offended we need to get the victim mentality out of our Lives we God and AR rapture too much stuff is trying to destabilize us well this one preaches that way and that one preaches that way but what does the Revelation say what does the revealed word say as Moses was an absolute in that Exodus as Paul was an absolute in that age God has sent us an absolute it's the message of the hour to stabilize us but getting offended at him but getting offended at this word it's the answer to your life it's headship over your life it's Direction over your family it's direction for your [Applause] church the prophet of God saying I'm going to see how advanced my church is not just the preacher not just the prophet but the prophet is saying I'm I'm get you I'm I'm getting you established in this present Faith grow up into the faith of the hour that everything you've you've seen done everything you've heard done everything you've heard said let it establish faith in your life I just see how Advance the people are how they're ready to take the sword and walk out on the front line say I challenge you Satan here's the word challenging us but what are we going to do when we to accept the challenge we're going to challenge the devil I challenge you Satan I challenge you you can't make me disbelieve anymore on how many wants that testimony Satan I challenge you you can't make me disbelieve any longer I know I'm a Believer I know I'm covered under this woman I know no weapon formed against me can prosper I know that it's by Grace I'm saved it's no merit of my own and I'm going to make the Rapture because I'm under rapturing [Applause] grace you take that word you're not running come on you're no longer even trying to hide behind some [Applause] Ministry some excuse of why you can't be an overcomer well some excuse well this happened and that happened no sir the message called you by name the message knows your address the message knows exactly your condition what you're going through knows exactly where the devil's hiding in your [Applause] life the message came to expose it Revelation revealed that thing and said those generational curses has nothing to do with you those spirits that have been passed down through your family tree has nothing to do with you that that don't even don't even claim [Applause] it well I've got a temper you know you don't you do as long as you claim it but it's time you start claiming the promises over your life get some backbone I'm feeling too good get some backbone get some courage about you oh why do you think the Holy Ghost came for to give you a holy ghost backbone a holy ghost courage a holy ghost Revelation that is not by m it's not my power but it's by my spirit sayith the Lord he can't even be a high priest over your life without you first confessing it he can't do one thing for you unless you confess the promise over your own life he can't even heal you unless you first say that I that claim that promise that I am the god that Health thee You' got to confess that you're healed do many are claiming oh well I just got this and I just got that and I just and you're that and you are that too but it's time that we realize that one of the Mysteries revealed in this hour is where the Royal Seed of Abraham he didn't promise seeds as many he promised one seed and that is the Royal Seed of Abraham and and we are Christ seed by election we didn't come from a denominational womb we come from the womb of the word elhi birthed us and we are nursing on the Promises of elhi I'm telling you what strength is coming into my body is saying I'm Healed I'm delivered I am set free I am Rapture material I have within me everything I have need of for the rapture make it through life Journey sir got to confess it young people got to confess it Elders yes sir Hallelujah I challenge you you can't make me disbelieve anymore oh yeah what are these things done for so that people will believe it's the word right it's word that shows that I'm preaching you to you the truth the word the word made flesh made flesh in you made word word made life in you made life in me amen so the prophet of God would say that it was only a sheath waving to prove that there's many more that is going to take up the sword not victims not cowards not someone that's just a good church member oh yeah yeah there's going to be those that are just good church members but there's going to be those that have a Grace right there's going to be those that just that's all they can do that's as far as they can go but there's a Grace there's a revelation that is just brooding over our hearts it's ripening us under the son of man Ministry it's the same Jesus the Same power the same anointing it's the same Christ Living in you and there's something in you that when you want to quit you can't quit something when you get knocked down and you're listening to the referee saying one 2 3 something gets down to S and you're just thinking you know it's nice and comfortable down here maybe I'll just stay down there's something in you that fight within your soul it's in your DNA you are the manifested Gen part of God and something gets you back up again and says where is that devil where is that devil where is he I'm going to knock his ears off amen there's a faith there's a revelation there's an anointing upon my life I've been anointed of the Holy Ghost to cast out Devils I've been anointed of the Holy Ghost to see families restored I'm anointed of the Holy Ghost to preach Deliverance to the captives and see Faith rise up see people realize they've been pardoned see Joy be restored I'm quitting with this one you see the prophet of of God would say that when you know these things then there's a responsibility that comes with it that's right right and he said it's within man to Sherk or sidestep responsibility that's right the prophet of God and a man running from the presence of the Lord he would say that he says it's it's just in man to Sherk his responsibility he says a man take a wife he's got a responsibility as a husband to her responsibility to provide a living and and and and and a home and all of these different things and you see the prophet of God would show us that we've got a responsibility to the word that's right now I'm I'm I'm quitting with this if you could just I'm sorry if I've read too much tonight but the prophet of God would say how wishy washy that's why too many Christians today are so soft soaked in everything right until they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shout or something like that and call it Christianity Christianity is a everyday rugged life living for God in this present [Applause] world listen now it's a constant say constant constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that set you a fire and put you out yonder with the people and making converts to Christ responsibilities but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get your ores and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just want let loose the ores and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility now you believe it you think it's the truth and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message and as I get older and I know my days are shortening up I feel the responsibility greater than ever I ever felt pressing on we must do it we must get down to it in everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God and he's coming soon he's not a there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord you see we got a responsibility to believe this we've got a responsibility to press That's why Paul said I forget everything that is behind me but I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you see the prophet of God would give us a little example he says a brother would come to him and and say you know it says of a of a preacher that that a a pastor tells congregation do you think that I could roll this wheelbarrow across this log and they say oh yes pastor we believe you can do it pastor does it and comes back says do you believe that I can put you know this log on it and do it yes pastor we we've got all confidence in you you you you you you can do it and then they said you know the Lord is with you Pastor how many Pastor how many of us pastors oh you got it yeah your faith can do anything then the Pastor said but I can put you in the whe bear and pack the law says wait now wait a minute it's different when you're included in it yourself now that's that now that it's mighty good for us to say here amen it's mighty good for us to say I believe that it's the truth but but then put it in action you got to put it in action yes sir it's one thing to say yes I believe I'm healed amen amen amen but you see it's your works that testify of your faith the way that everyone else sees that you're a Believer is how you respond to the word through your actions you see you've got a part to play the ministry of the Bride is Minister the word to the king manifesting his promised word in the age that she's living in you know that's the harsh desire is Lord I want to manifest to every one of your promises as the musicians come you see the prophet of God would say he would talk about uh Paul Raider and he would give us that example of how that he couldn't move that log and of course brother brother Paul was sick that was symbolic of his sickness and he couldn't move it and then he says he heard a voice as he says just roll it in the Stream and just ride it down river amen you see it was the voice of his boss but when he looked it was the Lord Jesus yeah oh God I'm so glad that the Lord Jesus is our boss that we don't when we don't know how to move things in our life and it could be whatever maybe it's a sickness maybe it's maybe it's a stubborn Spirit maybe it's just something that it's just you've been prayed for and prayed for and prayed for and just and and and it looks like there's just no hope yeah but you see the prophet of God is showing us he's he's he's revealing a secret here that what you got to do is you just got to roll it on over into the water you see there's a water of life there's a moving of the Holy Ghost that is coming right through this place right now and then Paul he jumped on the log and as he's jumping on it and he's crying out I'm riding on it I'm riding on it and when he come into it right mind he says he was in the middle of the floor and he's crying I'm riding on it I'm riding on it and he was healed something that looked like he was going to take him to his grave he's now completely healed because God gave him the remedy the prophet of God would say you know he says I'm riding on the message of the hour yeah did you catch it I'm riding on the message of the hour hope to the end for the grace that is given at the revelation of Jesus Christ the Capstone Revelation is this the same God the same yesterday today and forever and if he healed one back then upon the basis of faith in his word he'll do it again ride on it ride on this Revelation r on this mystery that's been revealed it's our boss it's [Music] headship headship saying to you you're not going to drown you're not going to sink right sometimes we feel like Peter when Jesus says come and we get out of the ship and we start walking on the waters and as long as our eyes are Upon Jesus we're walking but when we get looking around us we become unstable we get our eyes upon the revelation we get unstable are are you hearing me we get our eyes Upon Our symptoms or we get our eyes upon what this preacher says or that preacher says we become destabilized but Peter said master do you care that I perish and God in his Mercy reached down below the waves and pick Peter back up oh God is merciful friends I don't care how far it seems like you have fallen it I don't care how long you've been on the ground thinking you can never get up that Master is here the same God that that that restored Peter back into the boat is the same God that is restoring families restoring Joy restoring peace restoring [Applause] homes yes sir all he's looking for is someone to be stabilized by the Revelation that can just reach out and say I'm a Believer oh it challenges us can you believe [Music] oh David I thought of that when that when that Daddy says can you have compassion on us I mean the the the agony of seeing his boy go through this over and over and over the disciples couldn't help yeah come to Jesus can can you have compassion notice the compassion of Jesus [Music] he didn't he didn't try to say do you know who I am look at me I can do all things he says if thou can't believe all things can you catch it all things oh have compassion on me my marriage is falling apart do you care it's getting WRA down here do you care can you do it can you restore can you bring Deliverance I've got a son I've got a daughter they're bound on drugs and all of these things can you do it if thou can't believe for all things are possible to them that believe think of the compassion because he knew knew he knew that the word would be restored in the evening time and all it takes is believing all it takes is a faith touch upon that word that says Lord I believe I believe you I believe that you can save my waer son my waer daughter Lord I believe that you can restore my home I believe you can restore my joy I believe you can heal me of this sickness Lord Jesus I believe and some of you may even have to go as far as saying Lord I believe but oh help thou my unbelief God's mindful God's mindful do you believe that [Music] Hallelujah can you accept his presence we're getting ready to turn it over to your pastor but can you accept his presence moving Among Us can you accept that the word the word made manifest is his presence revealed to us in this [Music] hour why don't you just reach out and say oh God help me maybe you're in a sinking condition just cry out to him oh God help me no matter what the situation all things are possible doesn't matter if it's you're needing
