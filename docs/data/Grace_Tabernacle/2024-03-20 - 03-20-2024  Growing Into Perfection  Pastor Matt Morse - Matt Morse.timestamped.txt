[29:23] you wouldn't be any better off than you
[29:25] were when you came but one word from the
[29:27] Lord could change so we just want to
[29:29] give the Lord the Liberty to speak so I
[29:32] want to read this one verse of scripture
[29:33] as you take your seats Matthew 5 48
[29:37] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[29:40] as your father which is in heaven is
[29:42] perfect we'll just ask the Lord to add
[29:44] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[29:46] I want to speak tonight on this subject
[29:48] of growing into Perfection growing into
[29:52] Perfection here this uh this scripture
[29:55] that that Jesus was speaking is it's
[29:58] quite it's quite a demand for the church
[30:00] isn't it when you read that it's such a
[30:02] that's that's an overwhelming thought
[30:04] what a thought it is to be a perfect
[30:06] Christian or or a perfect person or to
[30:09] be able to stand perfect before God or
[30:11] or to even be perfect before one another
[30:14] and you know there's there's something
[30:16] there's something about this word
[30:18] perfect that that that means that to
[30:20] have all the required or desirable
[30:23] elements or characteristics or or
[30:25] qualities or in other words it means to
[30:27] be good as it is possible to be and I I
[30:30] know that many they they strive to be
[30:32] that way and we strive for one another
[30:35] to meet this place of perfection and I
[30:37] thought it's something about this word
[30:38] perfect how that we look brother Morgan
[30:40] at one another and many times this is
[30:42] something that we demand of one another
[30:44] we demand uh Perfection we demand you
[30:46] not to make any error we demand our our
[30:48] loved ones and our in our in our church
[30:51] our brothers and sisters in church and
[30:53] we we demand that that they always carry
[30:56] their yourself in the right way and they
[30:57] always say the right thing at the right
[30:59] time and they never make any mistakes or
[31:01] or never fall or they never get upset or
[31:03] they never get angry or they or they
[31:05] always always display the love of God
[31:07] and so uh it's something that we demand
[31:09] of one another often times and and I
[31:12] thought but you know to be a perfect
[31:13] Christian or a perfect person it could
[31:16] only be measured by the standard of the
[31:18] one that you're trying to be perfect for
[31:20] see so if I would let's say if I if I
[31:22] was building a building or had you build
[31:24] a building and you went out and you
[31:25] constructed that a way uh that would
[31:28] meet the eye of of of the the master
[31:30] builder the contractor maybe a builder
[31:32] would come by and brother Adam you did
[31:34] all the fine work and you framed it up
[31:35] just right and and you you did it all
[31:37] according to what you would consider to
[31:39] be a perfect house and and maybe the the
[31:41] contractor would come by and say well I
[31:43] don't like it that way see because you
[31:45] know I like it to have a the curve in
[31:47] the roof and I like I I like the the
[31:49] pillars to be round and I like that that
[31:52] the colonial look and and everything in
[31:54] here square and there's too many corners
[31:55] and there's too many windows or there's
[31:58] not enough windows or the floor is the
[31:59] wrong color see and and so they'd come
[32:01] by and one person may say it's perfect
[32:03] and the other person says it's terrible
[32:05] I wouldn't even live there you couldn't
[32:06] you couldn't give me that place to live
[32:08] and see so you find out that even
[32:10] Perfection it has to be measured uh by
[32:12] the standard of the person that you want
[32:14] to be perfect for so in other words so
[32:16] if I would say to you to be perfect then
[32:18] you would have to ask a question you
[32:20] would say by what standard must I be
[32:22] perfect if I said you need to live a
[32:24] perfect life or have a a perfect
[32:26] testimony your next question would
[32:27] always be well by what standard I I got
[32:29] to thinking about this if our if if if
[32:31] it's a call to Perfection by what
[32:33] standard is God calling us to be perfect
[32:36] and I I thought you know it's something
[32:37] that even in the church World you'll
[32:39] never find perfection if you if you was
[32:41] a Catholic the Baptist would say the
[32:42] Catholic is never a perfect Christian or
[32:44] the or the Baptist would say the
[32:46] Catholic is never a perfect Christian
[32:47] but you realize that in order to be a
[32:49] perfect Baptist that you would it would
[32:51] have to be by a Baptist standard in
[32:53] order to be a perfect Catholic it would
[32:55] have to be by Catholic standard to be a
[32:57] perfect Pentecostal it had to be by a
[32:59] Pentecostal standard and so so you find
[33:01] out it's according to the standard that
[33:03] you're measuring by so so you see to be
[33:06] a perfect Christian would have to come
[33:08] from a Christian standard there had to
[33:09] be something that God if he's going to
[33:11] call us to a place of perfection then
[33:13] there would have to be a standard that
[33:14] God was going to measure Us by butram
[33:17] said see if God is going to bring people
[33:18] to judgment he's going to have to have
[33:20] something to judge them by he's got to
[33:22] have some standard there there's got to
[33:24] be something that God was use as his
[33:25] standard he said see so if God would
[33:27] judge the world he said he would judge
[33:29] the World by Jesus Christ and Jesus
[33:32] Christ is the word and the word is God
[33:34] and he will judge them by this Bible for
[33:37] this is his word and it's God's
[33:39] standards so we must measure up to what
[33:41] the Bible says that we ought to be so
[33:44] see if God is going to have a standard
[33:46] and if God is going to call you to be
[33:48] perfect then there has to be a standard
[33:49] there has to be something that God would
[33:51] judge you by I thought my I got to
[33:53] thinking about this Bible standard
[33:54] tonight and the more I thought about it
[33:56] the more I thought about the measure me
[33:57] in Rod of the word and what we would
[33:59] measure up to and how we would fit into
[34:01] the standard of God and and the more I
[34:03] thought about it the more I I kept
[34:05] feeding and thinking you know that this
[34:06] Bible standard that God would give us
[34:08] that it's not a standard of legalism
[34:10] many would take it and say well if
[34:11] there's a standard in the Bible then it
[34:13] must be some bylaws or something that we
[34:15] have to live by in order to be perfect
[34:17] to God but the more I read and the more
[34:19] I studied you find out that God's Bible
[34:21] standard it wasn't a it wasn't a
[34:23] standard of a book of laws his Bible
[34:25] standard wasn't a standard of legalism
[34:27] said he said it like this he said see
[34:29] we've got laws and we make bylaws he
[34:31] said and you don't measure if you don't
[34:33] measure up to the standard then men will
[34:35] say well I've got a religious measuring
[34:36] stick that you have to measure up to and
[34:38] if you don't measure up to that then you
[34:40] just can't come in he said but God Saves
[34:44] Us by Grace not by a measuring stick so
[34:47] see if God is going to give us a
[34:49] standard to live by and God is going to
[34:51] give us the Bible and the Bible is going
[34:53] to be a Bible standard you know what
[34:54] that tells me that this Bible standard
[34:56] ain't a legal standard it ain't a it Ain
[34:59] it ain't that kind of a standard it
[35:00] ain't a standard of legalism but it's a
[35:02] Bible standard is a standard of the
[35:04] grace of Jesus Christ the Bible standard
[35:07] it's a standard of God oh I think about
[35:09] how he said see the perfecting of the
[35:11] Saints this is what God is calling us
[35:13] too and the more I thought about this
[35:15] standard of Grace you realize that the
[35:17] perfecting of the Saints is not
[35:19] something that we demand but it was
[35:21] something that God demands and not only
[35:23] did God demand the perfecting of the
[35:25] Saints but God you see if God would
[35:27] demand something then God's going to
[35:28] provide a way for you to get it so if he
[35:30] would demand the perfecting of the
[35:31] Saints and he would provide a way for it
[35:33] to be achieved this is what he said in
[35:35] Ephesians fourth chapter he said and God
[35:37] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[35:40] some evangelists and some pastors and
[35:43] some teachers for the perfecting of the
[35:45] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[35:48] the edifying of the body of Christ until
[35:50] we all come into the unity of the faith
[35:53] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[35:54] unto a perfect man unto the measure or
[35:58] the stature of the fullness of Christ I
[36:00] thought isn't it something that God
[36:02] would send a five-fold Ministry for the
[36:04] perfecting of God's children that would
[36:06] meet the demand of God that was a call
[36:09] to the church to be a perfect
[36:11] church he said that we henceforth be no
[36:14] more children tossed to and fro and
[36:16] carried about with every wind of
[36:17] Doctrine but by the slide of men and
[36:19] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[36:21] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[36:24] and love that we may grow up into him
[36:27] all things things which is the head even
[36:29] Christ Jesus from whom the whole body
[36:32] fitly joined together compacted by that
[36:34] which every joint Supply according to
[36:37] the effectual working in the measure of
[36:38] every part maketh increase of the body
[36:41] unto the edifying of itself in love I'm
[36:43] going to read that out of an amplified
[36:45] Bible so you can catch it he says for
[36:47] because of him the whole body the church
[36:50] and all of its various parts are closely
[36:52] joined together firmly knitted together
[36:55] by the joints and ligaments which is
[36:57] applied by God when each part is working
[37:00] properly it grows to full maturity and
[37:03] builds itself up in love this is the
[37:06] call of God to the church today that we
[37:09] grow together in the spirit of unity
[37:11] that we grow that we take the word of
[37:13] God and we would fit in it and and we'
[37:15] take the joints that God would Supply
[37:16] isn't it something that to build the
[37:18] body of Christ he'd Supply every part
[37:20] he'd Supply every knat every joint every
[37:23] ligament every turn every corner every
[37:25] speaker every singer every part that
[37:27] anybody would play that God would Supply
[37:30] let me tell you what that means to me
[37:31] tonight church that the church has what
[37:33] she needs you say what are we if we're
[37:35] looking for healing she has what she
[37:36] needs if she's looking for a Revival
[37:38] she's got what she needs if she's
[37:40] looking for salvation she has what she
[37:42] needs they're God Will Supply everything
[37:45] that the church has need of tonight that
[37:47] every joint be
[37:49] supplied This Is Our God he gives the
[37:51] church what we have need of but said you
[37:54] notice those people they can sit and say
[37:56] well I'll accept the Lord he said you
[37:57] take their word for it because you can't
[37:59] judge and neither can I he said but
[38:01] you'll notice in 10 years from now they
[38:03] never progressed they stay right where
[38:04] they are they're right in the same old
[38:06] place he said but we ought to grow daily
[38:09] in the grace of God we ought to grow
[38:12] each one each day our heart would hunger
[38:14] we ought to keep moving on there's
[38:15] something growing on the inside of you
[38:17] you get bigger and more spread out you
[38:20] can take more because you're you're
[38:22] bigger and you're growing and you're
[38:23] growing closer to God he said when this
[38:26] is what Paul said he said you're
[38:27] maturing to the Corinthian Church he
[38:29] said you're you're maturing and growing
[38:31] but when you ought to be teachers you're
[38:33] still babes needing teaching he said
[38:35] they ought to be teachers but there's
[38:36] something in there that is growing out
[38:38] and pushing out and making them bigger
[38:40] it's the Holy Spirit that's growing I
[38:42] thought isn't it something he said but
[38:43] you ought to be you ought to be teaching
[38:45] but you still need taught I thought
[38:47] isn't this something to hear if God is
[38:49] putting a life in you and that life is
[38:51] going to go or grow brother Adam I
[38:53] thought about how that a natural life in
[38:55] in a body and how if that if that you
[38:57] take a child that's born and as long as
[39:00] everything it's being fed right and it
[39:02] and it's being nurtured and and it's
[39:04] been given the right right food food and
[39:06] and it's in in in in the in the most
[39:08] rugged of atmospheres I've been all over
[39:10] the in many countries and and seen the
[39:13] poverty at its highest level over in
[39:16] India where there's so much poverty that
[39:18] they barely have any food to eat but you
[39:20] realize that the children the most
[39:21] malnourished children in the world but
[39:24] they they still grow is it something
[39:26] they don't they don't all have the
[39:27] Bountiful food that every other country
[39:29] has but they're still growing even with
[39:31] a little bit of food because your body
[39:33] is made to grow it's designed to grow
[39:36] it's not designed to stay an infant it's
[39:38] not designed to stay in this stage of
[39:40] infancy and this is what Paul is
[39:42] teaching with the body of Christ it
[39:43] can't remain an infant but it has to
[39:45] come to a growth it it has to come to a
[39:47] place of maturity so if there's a life
[39:49] in you and that life is living hear me
[39:51] somebody then you must be getting bigger
[39:54] if that life in you if it's alive if
[39:56] there's a life in there if there's a
[39:57] life form somewhere then it has to be
[40:00] growing it don't matter if it's natural
[40:02] or if it's spiritual it has to be
[40:04] growing brother typed it with a new
[40:06] birth he said if a birth is born it's
[40:08] born from the inside out that's why you
[40:11] never try to make a Christian from the
[40:12] outside end like these people do and
[40:14] they they put all these laws on people
[40:16] and and if you'll do that well you'll be
[40:18] saved well it never saved anybody but it
[40:20] takes a life on the inside of a person
[40:23] that would change a person's heart and
[40:24] it would push out the very Life of
[40:26] Christ
[40:27] he said see this life in you is growing
[40:29] it's getting bigger it's a new birth he
[40:31] said and when this birth is on the
[40:32] inside this is a question brother
[40:34] brandom asked he said when a birth is on
[40:36] the inside should it not grow if it's a
[40:39] birth on the inside shouldn't It Grow
[40:42] the Christ in your heart it ought to be
[40:44] growing daily it ought to be getting
[40:46] bigger it ought to be more powerful you
[40:48] ought to understand things better you
[40:50] ought to be more forgiving you ought to
[40:51] be walking as God would because the
[40:54] Bible said Till Christ be formed in you
[40:56] is the Hope hope of all
[40:58] glory we're waiting on it to grow he
[41:01] said therefore we must contend with the
[41:03] weak until they are fully matured in
[41:05] Christ Jesus contend with one another
[41:07] they may not be where you are but
[41:09] contend with one another until they're
[41:11] fully matured in Christ Jesus then
[41:13] they're good soldiers then they've got
[41:15] on the full armor and let me tell you
[41:17] what happens when they get to that place
[41:18] you can talk about them and it don't
[41:20] even matter amen somebody you can make
[41:23] fun of them and it don't even affect
[41:24] them you can laugh at them they don't
[41:26] pay no attention to it cuz they're at a
[41:28] stage of maturity he said the one thing
[41:31] I know he said they've got one thing
[41:33] they're just so big they're so filled
[41:35] with the glory of God that the only
[41:38] thing it would take for them to go in a
[41:40] Rapture is this old flesh to fall off of
[41:42] them and that old robe of Flesh and
[41:44] they'll go right into Glory cuz they've
[41:46] done built on everything they have need
[41:48] of has already been built on the inside
[41:50] of them the only thing keeping you as
[41:52] that old robe of Flesh that's hanging
[41:54] there I pray to God that every believer
[41:57] under my voice tonight would be so
[41:59] filled with the glory of God that the
[42:01] only thing left for a Rapture is to drop
[42:03] off this old robe of Flesh and take
[42:05] another step into
[42:08] eternity lay down the robe of Flesh we
[42:12] ought to be so fat in the word of God we
[42:14] ought to be growing out it ought to be
[42:15] pushing out of us there ain't no life
[42:17] left in US it ain't nothing but God
[42:19] growing out I think the problem with the
[42:21] church well today is the churches are
[42:23] too skinny they they're anemic on the
[42:25] word of God but I thank God we have a
[42:27] fat church I thank God that we've been
[42:30] feeding on the word of God enough that
[42:32] it's pushing something out of us all the
[42:34] world has gone by the wayside and the
[42:37] life of Jesus Christ is being manifested
[42:39] in the heart of every
[42:41] believer
[42:44] amen we ought to be a fat church we
[42:46] ought to be a big church we ought to be
[42:48] big
[42:49] Christians amen we ain't a bunch of
[42:51] little pushovers we're big Christians
[42:53] thank God for it glory to
[42:56] God
[42:58] my he said well what's a big person look
[43:01] like let me just tell you he said a big
[43:03] person when somebody come by and they
[43:05] say you know Miss Jones somebody called
[43:07] you a hypocrite she said well they did
[43:09] well God bless them that's what a big
[43:11] person looks like well you know certain
[43:14] things going on with the church that
[43:15] ought to be going on well it is well
[43:17] we'll just pray for them that's what a
[43:19] big person looks like but said that's
[43:21] big he said oh if you're little you'll
[43:23] say oh it is but let me see which side I
[43:26] must join
[43:28] oh it is there's a problem did you
[43:29] believe what so and so said oh they did
[43:32] but let me tell you what this one said
[43:33] about oh it did let me tell you what
[43:36] side I'm going to join he said see
[43:38] that's where you get in trouble where
[43:39] you can't mature but the big person they
[43:42] look a little different man I feel like
[43:43] preaching he said when you get big
[43:45] enough when you get large enough how
[43:47] many wants to hear it when you get
[43:49] swelled out and and not just swelled out
[43:52] but growed out Christ growing in you
[43:54] it'll grow out all malice it'll take you
[43:56] out of you it'll push it out and when
[43:58] God comes in it'll push everything out
[44:01] you say oh how little how juvenile it is
[44:03] for these kids to argue in fuss he said
[44:05] but the first thing you know you'll just
[44:07] grow over the top of it they may argue
[44:10] they may fuss they may be playing Church
[44:12] they may not be ready to have church
[44:14] there may be all kinds of things going
[44:15] on down there but there's something
[44:17] about the big Christians that it don't
[44:18] vect them any longer why they're living
[44:20] in a place that's above
[44:22] it he said we wer called to be little we
[44:25] were called to be big
[44:27] said you then you'll say I used to hate
[44:29] to see this and hate that he said but
[44:31] you know I just got so I don't pay
[44:33] attention to it anymore he said now
[44:35] you're
[44:35] growing I just don't pay attention to it
[44:38] no more that's big you know sometimes
[44:42] when you grow sometimes it hurts to grow
[44:44] take a little kid and some of you little
[44:46] boys may be going through it right now
[44:48] go in bed at night and get to that age
[44:50] of growing and your legs hurt so bad and
[44:52] your arms start hurting scientist still
[44:54] ain't yet figured out how or why why it
[44:56] even happens but but it's somehow
[44:58] associated with adolescence and their
[44:59] growth and but but but every one of us
[45:01] go through that growing pains and each
[45:03] one of us as a Young Man a young woman
[45:05] it went through growing pains and you
[45:07] know it's just it's not a it's not a bad
[45:08] thing it's just a sign that you're
[45:10] growing you'll feel them one day now
[45:11] don't worry but it's just a sign that
[45:14] you're growing it's a she's got the
[45:16] genetics of her daddy bless her heart
[45:20] but it's a sign that you're growing that
[45:22] they're growing pains and sometimes you
[45:24] know it just means you're getting bigger
[45:25] it may be a little bit at a time but it
[45:27] means you're getting bigger you know
[45:28] your arms hurt your legs hurt all these
[45:30] things you're getting bigger all the
[45:32] time but you realize but that's the way
[45:34] it is when you're serving God sometimes
[45:37] it hurts a little bit when you grow
[45:39] sometimes when the preacher goes to
[45:41] preach and they'll step on your toes why
[45:43] because it's God just trying to grow you
[45:45] into a big Christian sometimes it feels
[45:48] like a whole sermon was just directed at
[45:50] you but don't worry about it it's just
[45:52] God trying to grow you into a big
[45:54] Christian but let me tell you something
[45:56] tonight Church that your response to the
[45:58] word of God it shows the maturity of
[46:01] where you are so let the word go forth
[46:04] and let the maturity of the believer say
[46:06] Amen anyhow well I got news for you a
[46:08] real mature Christian they don't have to
[46:10] know everything that's where men have
[46:12] messed it up well if they're going to be
[46:13] a mature Christian they got to be able
[46:15] to quote all the scripture no that ain't
[46:17] it to be a mature Christian you got to
[46:18] know the church age book front to back
[46:20] no that ain't it but free to be a to be
[46:22] a mature Christian they might not even
[46:24] have the answer to the question
[46:26] correctly ly but what they will do is
[46:28] they'll respond to the word correctly
[46:31] that's a sign of the maturity of a
[46:33] Believer so when the preaching of the
[46:35] word makes you feel good you say amen
[46:37] and you go forward when it steps on your
[46:39] toes you say amen and you go forward
[46:42] when it makes you feel bad you say amen
[46:44] and you go forward when it corrects your
[46:46] mistake you say amen and you go forward
[46:49] when it's straight you say Amen when
[46:51] it's hard you go forward why it's the
[46:54] sign of the maturity of the Christian
[46:56] church
[46:58] I know what the devil does he says who
[46:59] are you to correct me I'm an elder
[47:01] anyhow I got news for you friends I
[47:03] don't want to correct anybody I I ain't
[47:06] never in my life ever woke up thought
[47:07] well I'm gonna go set them straight I
[47:08] don't have that I don't want to correct
[47:10] people I don't want to get on to my my
[47:12] little my little nephew he he told his
[47:14] mama the other day he said you know I
[47:16] want to when I grow up I want to be a
[47:17] pastor and she said well why you want to
[47:19] be a pastor he said so I can tell
[47:20] everybody what to
[47:21] do I she said why would he think that I
[47:24] don't know I hope I don't go around
[47:26] trying to tell everybody what to do but
[47:28] that hopefully that ain't what what
[47:30] everybody looks at a pastor as I don't
[47:32] want to correct anybody if I if I was
[47:33] going to correct everybody well I'd
[47:35] start with myself that' that'd be where
[47:37] I'd start but I thought my instead of
[47:39] worrying about who's correcting and
[47:41] who's preaching and what and what
[47:42] they're saying is it directed at me and
[47:44] what what's God trying to do you see the
[47:46] atmosphere that's been in the church in
[47:47] the past past few weeks and months it's
[47:49] the unity of Jesus Christ to a place
[47:52] where the word of God can go forth and
[47:54] God can take any vessel that God chooses
[47:56] and let him establish him in the pull
[47:58] pit and and let him let him be able to
[48:00] surrender to God without somebody
[48:01] pulling on them and talking and causing
[48:04] all this trouble and allow God to come
[48:06] and be able to speak to the hearts of
[48:07] the Believers that we can be big
[48:10] Christians let them come and speak the
[48:12] word of God I think what we ought to do
[48:14] is just let the word be preached and
[48:16] correct all of us I think we ought to
[48:19] just let the word be preached and fix
[48:21] all of us then we can be right before
[48:24] God we ain't trying to correct nobody we
[48:27] just want let God have his way you know
[48:31] sometimes sometimes we have to be big
[48:33] enough to do little
[48:35] things my we're going to be a big
[48:38] Christian sometimes you gotta be big
[48:40] enough to do little things I know
[48:42] brother brother Joe won't mind if I
[48:43] share this but I remember when he first
[48:45] came to the church and here you know the
[48:47] church was growing brother Joe the Lord
[48:48] had spoke to him and told him to come
[48:50] here and be a help and he whenever he
[48:52] came to tell me that he said you know
[48:54] brother Matt he said Lord told me to
[48:55] come and be a help my family and we're
[48:58] going to we're going to get behind the
[48:58] work here and and put our shoulder to
[49:00] the wheel and this is where God's called
[49:02] us to and he said Lord Lord told me to
[49:04] Lord told me to do it he said so if you
[49:06] need me to lead songs I'll lead songs if
[49:08] you need me to take prayer requests I'll
[49:10] take prayer requests if you need me to
[49:11] preach I'll preach if you need me to to
[49:13] sing after I'll sing after whatever you
[49:15] need me to do just let me know I just
[49:16] want to be a help I thought isn't that
[49:18] the right way to come Lord just let me
[49:21] be a help in any way that I can let me
[49:23] be a help I thought you know that's a
[49:25] big thing for a man to say brother is
[49:26] older than I am he's been preaching
[49:28] longer than I have but you know instead
[49:30] of instead of positioned himself as an
[49:32] elder or try to you know to position in
[49:35] some way he just said Lord called me
[49:37] here and I want to be a help I thought
[49:38] you know the lord lord gave something to
[49:40] my heart that day I thought you know if
[49:42] you're too big to do the little things
[49:43] you're too little to do the big things
[49:46] and I thank God that we have people that
[49:47] are big enough to do little things I
[49:50] thank God for people that are big enough
[49:52] to say whereever I'm needed just let me
[49:54] be a help and let me let me be a feeling
[49:56] if I got to be a f in I just want to be
[49:58] a help in the house of God I want to do
[50:00] my part that God's children can go on
[50:02] and then we can be big Christians and
[50:04] one day we'll go into a
[50:06] Rapture that's the opposite of the way
[50:08] the world thinks isn't it something
[50:11] that's opposite of the way they think
[50:12] but you know what they got to be you got
[50:14] to be big enough to be
[50:15] little I know it's so opposite you got
[50:17] to be big enough to be humble you got to
[50:19] be big enough to be a servant you got to
[50:22] be big enough to surrender to God but BR
[50:24] said listen he said notice always a big
[50:27] man always humbles
[50:28] himself the Way Up Is Down always make
[50:31] yourself little God will bring you up he
[50:34] exalts himself and shall he that exalts
[50:36] himself shall be a based but he that
[50:38] humbles himself shall be exalted he says
[50:41] so make yourself little always be little
[50:43] don't be the big shot or be the little
[50:45] fella God is the only one Among Us
[50:47] that's big anyhow isn't that right he's
[50:49] the only big one there is anyhow he said
[50:52] you always say people are looking to
[50:54] have a holy church and a holy people he
[50:56] said oh no it's the holy God that's
[50:58] right we're an Unholy church and an
[51:00] Unholy people we ain't no such thing as
[51:02] a holy church it's a holy God in the
[51:05] church there ain't no such thing as a
[51:06] holy people it's the holy ghost in the
[51:09] people so then you're not talking about
[51:10] the people any longer but you're talking
[51:13] about the Holy Ghost that is in them
[51:16] God's Building A Perfect
[51:18] Church oh I know what people quote the
[51:20] scriptures well I'm a you know after all
[51:22] the B my good I'm gonna get myself in
[51:24] trouble after all the Bible said I'm a
[51:26] king and a priest and and after all the
[51:28] Old Testament said I was to be the head
[51:30] and not be the tail and and you know I'm
[51:32] supposed to be a great man like David
[51:34] and and Samson these Mighty Warriors and
[51:37] and my I want to have the faith of
[51:38] Abraham and the courage of David and the
[51:41] and the resolve that that Daniel had and
[51:43] the strength of Sam Samson and and the
[51:46] vision of Deborah and the patience of
[51:48] Martha and the dedication that Esther
[51:50] had I want to have all those things I
[51:52] say amen amen amen and amen but how
[51:56] about what Paul said he said we need to
[51:58] have the mind of Jesus Christ we can
[52:01] have all those things but Paul said but
[52:03] we must have the mind of Christ he said
[52:06] let this mind be in you which was in
[52:07] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[52:10] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[52:12] with God most people stop right there
[52:16] thought it not robbert to be equal with
[52:18] God man I'm a great big man not thought
[52:21] it not robbery to be equal with God but
[52:24] listen to the rest of the scripture he
[52:26] said but he made himself of no
[52:29] reputation and he took upon him the form
[52:31] of a servant and he was made in the
[52:34] likeness of men and being found in the
[52:36] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[52:39] became obedient unto death even the
[52:42] death of the cross it was a big man that
[52:45] became little you realize this was
[52:47] Paul's message in Philippians the second
[52:49] chapter to each one of us he said but in
[52:51] the lowliness of mine Let each esteem
[52:53] other better than themselves I'm showing
[52:55] you how to get big
[52:57] look not every man on his own things but
[52:59] every man also on the things of others
[53:02] now notice what God did he said
[53:04] wherefore then after all of this he said
[53:06] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[53:09] him and given him a name which is above
[53:11] every name that in at the name of Jesus
[53:14] every knee should bow of the things in
[53:17] heaven and the things in Earth and the
[53:18] things under the Earth and that every
[53:20] tongue con should confess that Jesus
[53:22] Christ is the Lord the glory of the God
[53:24] the father isn't it something listen
[53:27] friends he humbled himself unto
[53:30] greatness this is our Jesus he
[53:33] surrendered himself to Victory this is
[53:36] our Jesus he gave his life gave up all
[53:40] that he was yet he gained the whole
[53:42] world that's our Jesus our example
[53:46] humbled himself unto greatness he became
[53:49] our example in all things do you realize
[53:51] everything that we do in the church
[53:53] today the very Commission of the church
[53:55] today came from Jesus Jesus being our
[53:57] example I thought of a few things that
[53:59] we do that how how we go down and we
[54:01] baptize people and you realize that we
[54:03] baptized because Jesus was baptized see
[54:05] he's our example if we come out and and
[54:08] and we we come to communion we take
[54:10] communion because Jesus Took communion
[54:11] he was our example we wash feet because
[54:13] he washed feet see he was our example
[54:16] even when we come up and and you bring a
[54:18] baby up to be dedicated and and we come
[54:20] you realize we don't you know many
[54:22] places they put sprinkled water or
[54:23] something on the babies but we don't do
[54:24] that we come and we lay hands on a baby
[54:27] and pray over them and speak over their
[54:29] life it's a dedication but said see what
[54:31] we do he said we want to stay exactly
[54:33] the way the Bible said to do it he said
[54:35] there's no scripture for baptizing an
[54:36] infant or nothing like that he said so
[54:38] but notice what Jesus done see because
[54:41] Jesus was our example that he brought
[54:43] him the little children and he put his
[54:44] hands on them and he blessed them he
[54:45] said suffer little children to come unto
[54:47] me and forbid them not for such is the
[54:49] kingdom of heaven and that's the way we
[54:51] try to continue see Jesus is our example
[54:54] so why don't we baptize why don't we was
[54:56] feet why don't we take communion why
[54:57] don't we dedicate babies there's your
[54:59] answer Mama that you were looking for
[55:00] why why do we go through this because
[55:02] Jesus was our example and we're
[55:04] following after our example I found that
[55:07] I thought this is a beautiful quote I
[55:08] may take it just a second and read it he
[55:09] said now we know as the pastor and I lay
[55:12] hands on these babies our hands are poor
[55:14] substitutes for our Lord because his was
[55:17] holy but if he had to search to the
[55:19] Earth this morning to find a holy hand
[55:21] where would he find it there is no such
[55:24] thing on the Earth but by his Grace we
[55:27] represent him see if he's our example
[55:31] sister Joy then we must be like him he's
[55:33] our example we must be like him but man
[55:35] said wouldn't it be nice if we were all
[55:37] like him he said well what was it to be
[55:38] like him he was always about his
[55:40] father's business so if he's going to be
[55:41] our example it wouldn't it be something
[55:43] if we were just about our father's
[55:45] business see then whenever things came
[55:47] up it didn't bother him it didn't sway
[55:49] him because it was about the father's
[55:50] business see when somebody's on a
[55:51] mission or they're or they're going
[55:53] about some business they're they're
[55:54] harder to distract see you come up and
[55:56] say well there's such and such going on
[55:58] and and my it ought to it ought to
[55:59] distract the whole church but there's
[56:00] somebody that's just about the father's
[56:02] business why don't that get you so
[56:04] worked up and and don't you know don't
[56:06] you know you ought to be mad about that
[56:08] well I can't help it right now because
[56:09] I'm about the father's business say see
[56:12] because we got something else on our
[56:13] mind there's a mission on our mind I
[56:15] thought my isn't it something he gave us
[56:16] an example he said so remember our Lord
[56:19] what would he do if he stood here today
[56:22] he would hold to the word of God in the
[56:24] midst of every temptation he'll say with
[56:27] the word just like he did it he was your
[56:30] example what are you going to make for
[56:32] your example think about it who's your
[56:34] example he said he ought to be our
[56:36] example who's your example tonight have
[56:39] you made some some some movie star our
[56:41] example is it is it some bull rider that
[56:44] that that that has become our example is
[56:46] it a great athlete or somebody that's
[56:48] become our example brother said are we
[56:49] going to make Hollywood our example or
[56:51] you just going to believe God's word
[56:53] about it Jesus Christ our example
[56:56] notice if he's our example let's just
[56:58] see what the Bible said our example did
[57:00] can I have a minute the Bible said after
[57:03] the Holy Ghost fell on him he went into
[57:04] the Wilderness and he was tempted to be
[57:06] tempted of the devil then was Jesus
[57:09] listen then was Jesus led up of the
[57:12] spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted
[57:14] of the devil a't that something he was
[57:16] led of the spirit to be tempted he was
[57:21] led to be tempted watch what Satan done
[57:24] he waited until he got the weak State I
[57:26] love how Jesus done this he fasted 40
[57:29] days and 40 nights until a man's body
[57:31] his natural body would get into a
[57:33] condition that was the weakest state
[57:35] that a human being could be in to show
[57:37] you that in your weakest Place how that
[57:39] you could defeat the Devil so here in
[57:42] this weakened state after 40 days of
[57:45] fasting and in this we he was already in
[57:47] human flesh the Lord Of Glory that that
[57:50] that descended into human flesh and and
[57:52] he and he came down into this weak old
[57:53] frail body that falls apart anyway then
[57:56] he went down and he fasted until he his
[57:58] body was so weak that he was laying
[58:00] there he could barely even it could
[58:02] barely even move but he was in this
[58:04] wicked State and then Satan comes by and
[58:06] he begins to tempt
[58:08] him thought is it something when he when
[58:11] he lead him I thought that was just
[58:12] something how that was worded how that
[58:14] he was led to be tempted isn't it
[58:16] something that he was led to be tempted
[58:18] but then when Jesus would tell us how to
[58:19] pray the Lord's Prayer the disciples
[58:21] said how must me pray he said we'll say
[58:23] F Our Father Who Art in Heaven lead us
[58:25] not into tempt ation but delivers from
[58:28] Evil I thought isn't that something
[58:30] Jesus the Bible says he was led to be
[58:32] tempted he was our example he said but
[58:34] when you pray you pray father don't lead
[58:36] us into temptation thought isn't that an
[58:39] odd thought even in the garden whenever
[58:42] he would pray in the garden Matthew 26th
[58:44] chapter the Bible said when Jesus went
[58:46] down to pray he began to call upon them
[58:48] that Temptation wouldn't come on I'm
[58:49] going to show you the answer to this why
[58:51] why it seems like he would be one way
[58:52] and he' tell you to pray another but
[58:54] notice what Jesus actually says he says
[58:56] he never says Watch and Pray so that you
[58:59] won't be
[59:00] tempted he says see see see there's no
[59:03] way you can get to a place in your
[59:04] Christian walk that you're not going to
[59:06] be tempted so Jesus don't say pray to
[59:09] God that you won't be tempted he said
[59:11] pray that you won't be led into
[59:12] temptation when he tells the disciples
[59:14] this when they're praying at Gethsemane
[59:16] he says he says literally he says this
[59:18] way he says so that you will not enter
[59:21] into temptation in other words he says
[59:24] Watch and Pray so that you will not fall
[59:27] into temptation watch and pray that you
[59:30] won't enter into temptation you see pray
[59:33] that you be not led into temptation see
[59:35] there's a difference between being
[59:37] tempted and entering into temptation I
[59:40] thought you know I thought about this
[59:42] how how that somebody come knock I
[59:43] remember a guy come to our house one
[59:45] time and and you know come knock on the
[59:47] door and he come up there talking and
[59:49] said you know you know I got something I
[59:51] want to I want to show you and he was a
[59:53] Salesman and of course me and Sarah
[59:54] sitting there and said you know I wanted
[59:56] to show us something notice what the
[59:57] salesman never says he never comes up
[1:00:00] there and says hey um you know what I I
[1:00:02] hope you got a big checkbook and you're
[1:00:04] ready to write a check it's going to
[1:00:05] cost a few thousand dollars but I got
[1:00:07] something I'm wanting to sell to you if
[1:00:08] you got a few extra thousand laying
[1:00:09] around he never says that but when he
[1:00:12] comes to the door and he knocks and he
[1:00:13] answer the door what he said was is that
[1:00:16] you know I got something I need to show
[1:00:18] you I thought well okay well it don't
[1:00:22] cost you nothing it ain't going to cost
[1:00:23] you a dime to look at it I just got
[1:00:26] something I want to show you you know
[1:00:27] what if I don't show people I don't beat
[1:00:29] my quota and then my boss going to be
[1:00:30] mad at me man they're not going to let
[1:00:32] me they're going to make fun of me
[1:00:33] around the office I'm gonna get tired
[1:00:34] and feathered I'm going have to around
[1:00:36] around I mean all this s story if I can
[1:00:38] just show you it won't cost you die
[1:00:39] won't take me just a minute but can I
[1:00:40] just show
[1:00:41] you but then notice what we did we
[1:00:44] opened the door and then the area
[1:00:46] entered in now we're in this inner
[1:00:49] sanctuary of the living room you know
[1:00:51] what he done he went around and he took
[1:00:53] this he started he started vacuuming up
[1:00:55] the car and then he started vacuuming
[1:00:57] the the the the the seats on the sofa
[1:00:59] and then he started vacuuming the
[1:01:00] pillars and then he said go get your
[1:01:01] pillar from your bedroom let me show you
[1:01:03] a little something got the pillar and he
[1:01:04] showed us how much how much uh dirty
[1:01:07] stuff was on our pillar with the vacuum
[1:01:08] cleaner needless to say by the time he
[1:01:10] was done we had a $1,400 vacuum cleaner
[1:01:14] it's still sitting in my
[1:01:17] shop you see there's a difference
[1:01:19] between being tempted and entering into
[1:01:23] temptation see to be tempted would be at
[1:01:26] the door saying I've got something I
[1:01:27] want to show you and you say but I don't
[1:01:29] want to see it well I got something let
[1:01:31] me just run this by you real quick I
[1:01:33] don't I'm I'm too busy but let me tell
[1:01:35] you what's going on in the church but I
[1:01:37] ain't got an ear for it let me tell you
[1:01:38] what what I saw this sister do down
[1:01:40] there the other day no I ain't got no
[1:01:42] time for it see there's a difference
[1:01:43] between being tempted won't you try this
[1:01:46] a little bit let me let me let me take
[1:01:48] you down this road won't you won't you
[1:01:49] won't you click on this website for just
[1:01:51] a minute there's a difference between
[1:01:53] being tempted and then entering into
[1:01:55] temptation
[1:01:57] see there's a place where you can stop
[1:01:58] there's a place that you can that you
[1:02:00] can walk away there's a place that that
[1:02:02] that that that it's easier to take a
[1:02:04] stand than entering into temptation so
[1:02:06] Jesus says pray to the father don't lead
[1:02:08] me into temptation so even when the
[1:02:10] tempter comes that he God he would stop
[1:02:13] it at the door God will never lead you
[1:02:15] into temptation he'll never lead you to
[1:02:18] to enter into this don't enter into
[1:02:21] temptation see the Bible even said this
[1:02:23] about Jesus our example he said he was
[1:02:25] tempted in every like manner of man that
[1:02:27] tells us that every man's going to be
[1:02:28] tempted he was tempted in every like
[1:02:30] manner every man is tempted but Jesus
[1:02:32] showed us how to keep from falling or
[1:02:35] entering into temptation notice when the
[1:02:38] Bible says I I know yall know this
[1:02:39] scripture but the Bible says whenever
[1:02:41] the devil came and he began to minister
[1:02:43] unto him he said the tempter came to him
[1:02:45] and he said if you be a Son of God
[1:02:46] command these tones to be made to bread
[1:02:48] Jesus answered him it is written that
[1:02:50] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:02:52] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:02:54] mouth of God it didn't matter what what
[1:02:55] the devil said Jesus's response was
[1:02:57] always the same he said but it is
[1:02:59] written why don't you why don't you why
[1:03:01] don't you step off this mountain because
[1:03:03] even the Bible said that you had charge
[1:03:05] over the angels and they had lift you up
[1:03:06] Jesus said but it is also written Thou
[1:03:08] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God it
[1:03:10] didn't matter what the devil brought to
[1:03:11] him the answer is always the same but it
[1:03:14] is
[1:03:14] written he never attacked the word he
[1:03:17] never said that ain't true he never said
[1:03:19] I don't believe it that way but he
[1:03:21] retreated into the word of God and he
[1:03:23] said but it is also written
[1:03:26] any man that'll humble himself through
[1:03:28] the word of God will access the power of
[1:03:31] God it don't matter what Satan says the
[1:03:33] only way you'll ever overcome him is to
[1:03:35] retreat to the word of God the Bible
[1:03:37] says by the word of God was the world
[1:03:39] framed by the word of God is the world
[1:03:41] held together by the word of God it's
[1:03:43] only way you'll ever defeat the enemy is
[1:03:45] to retreat to the word of a living God
[1:03:47] you realize that's what happened when oh
[1:03:49] I feel like preaching that's what
[1:03:50] happened when David went out to fight
[1:03:52] Goliath that day and he heard the
[1:03:53] boastings of that great enemy over over
[1:03:55] the children of Israel and notice when
[1:03:57] David went into Saul's tent and Saul be
[1:03:59] to pile armor on him that he would be
[1:04:01] able to face his enemy but notice what
[1:04:03] David he said this armor it ain't doing
[1:04:05] me no good it ain't doing nothing but
[1:04:07] holding me back I can't move my arms in
[1:04:09] it I can't lift my hands in it I can't
[1:04:11] run like I used to I can't put this on
[1:04:14] but he went back and he relied on the
[1:04:16] testimonies of a living God when Satan
[1:04:18] would come and say put this armor on he
[1:04:21] relied on the testimonies of what God
[1:04:23] had already done and those testimonies
[1:04:26] of Victory as he begin to speak on to
[1:04:28] Saul you realize he said it was God that
[1:04:31] delivered me out of the mouth of a lion
[1:04:33] it was God that delivered me out of the
[1:04:35] out of the paws of a bear and how dare
[1:04:38] that uncircumcised Philistine stand
[1:04:40] against the army of a living
[1:04:43] God is't it something that he called him
[1:04:46] uncircumcised my makes I just want to
[1:04:48] preach he called him uncircumcised you
[1:04:51] realize what he was speaking of because
[1:04:53] David's circumcision was a sign of the
[1:04:56] Covenant that God had gave Israel so
[1:04:58] here when David would look at Goliath
[1:05:00] he'd say here's a man that stands
[1:05:02] outside the Covenant and he's talking to
[1:05:04] God's covenant people like he has power
[1:05:06] over them but there ain't a covenant on
[1:05:08] you the covenant's on
[1:05:11] me and that man David might have think
[1:05:14] about it he knew something that the
[1:05:16] world don't know a lot about he knew
[1:05:18] that there was nobody that was out from
[1:05:20] under that Covenant that had any power
[1:05:22] over anybody that was underneath that
[1:05:24] Covenant it didn't matter what they said
[1:05:26] it didn't matter where they tried to
[1:05:27] pull you to what trash they tried to
[1:05:29] drag you into they'll never Prevail over
[1:05:32] you because you're under the Covenant of
[1:05:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost said see
[1:05:36] it's our covenant you know what David
[1:05:38] done he took his Covenant and he went
[1:05:40] down into the valley of elaw oh friend
[1:05:42] don't you realize he took the word that
[1:05:44] God had already spoke over him and he
[1:05:46] went down into the valley of elaw the
[1:05:48] very the very man that the prophet
[1:05:50] Samuel had anointed to be king over
[1:05:52] Israel he walked down with that
[1:05:54] anointing on his life under the Covenant
[1:05:56] of the almighty God and stood down there
[1:05:59] to face an enemy and guess what David
[1:06:02] was little isn't that the first thing
[1:06:05] the Goliath saw he said who would send
[1:06:08] this boy the Bible said he was offended
[1:06:10] that they would send a boy who would
[1:06:12] send a lad I I want your Warrior not the
[1:06:15] little one and he went to making fun of
[1:06:18] him but you realize that the word of God
[1:06:20] his Prophet had already been spoke over
[1:06:22] David's life and the giant as he scoffed
[1:06:25] and he made fun of him and he mocked him
[1:06:27] as a little boy I thought isn't it
[1:06:28] something that when David Goes to
[1:06:30] speaking that he don't talk like a
[1:06:32] little boy see the anointing on him he
[1:06:35] may he may have seemed like a a child he
[1:06:37] may have seemed a lesser he may have
[1:06:38] seemed a little boy but to the giant but
[1:06:40] whenever he began to speak notice what
[1:06:42] he speaks the Bible said and then David
[1:06:44] said to the Philistine thou comest to me
[1:06:48] with a sword and with a spear and with a
[1:06:50] shield but I come to thee in the name of
[1:06:53] the Lord of hosts the god of the armies
[1:06:55] of is Israel whom thou Hast defied David
[1:06:58] said this battle ain't between me and
[1:07:00] you this battle's between you and my God
[1:07:02] this that battle ain't ain't your size
[1:07:04] and my size but it's your size and my
[1:07:06] God's size there's something about it he
[1:07:09] said you've defied the armies of the
[1:07:11] Living God and the god that you have
[1:07:12] defied so not by my own strength but by
[1:07:15] the strength of God not by my own power
[1:07:18] but by the power of God not by my own
[1:07:20] might but by the might of God I'll
[1:07:22] overcome you this day that little man
[1:07:25] man he said this day my watching
[1:07:28] prophesy glory to God that little man he
[1:07:31] said this day will the Lord deliver thee
[1:07:34] into mine hand I will Smite you I'll
[1:07:37] take your head from you I'll give the
[1:07:39] carcasses of the host of the Philistines
[1:07:41] this day unto the fouls of the air and
[1:07:43] to the wild beasts of the earth that all
[1:07:46] the Earth may know that there is a God
[1:07:47] in
[1:07:48] Israel and all of this assembly look he
[1:07:51] starts preaching to the Israelites he
[1:07:53] said all this assembly shall know that
[1:07:55] the Lord saveth not with a sword not
[1:07:59] with a spear for the battle is the
[1:08:01] Lord's and he will give you into our
[1:08:04] hands and the Bible says and it came to
[1:08:06] pass oh I love it it came to pass that
[1:08:09] when the Philistine arose to come
[1:08:11] against David and he drew nigh to meet
[1:08:14] David the Bible says that David he
[1:08:17] hastened and ran toward the Army to beat
[1:08:20] the Philistine oh a little man had
[1:08:22] became big he wasn't afraid of him the
[1:08:25] Bible didn't say he second guessed
[1:08:26] himself he didn't run away but when that
[1:08:28] great giant stood up before him the
[1:08:30] Bible said he ran to meet his enemy I
[1:08:33] ain't going the other way but he went
[1:08:34] after his enemy let me tell you friend
[1:08:36] it don't matter how big the giant is it
[1:08:39] don't matter how big the tempter is but
[1:08:41] I think the army of the Living God the
[1:08:43] Sons and Daughters of God have a right
[1:08:45] to go face their enemy you take what God
[1:08:48] gave you the Covenant that you're living
[1:08:49] under and you going stand before your
[1:08:51] giant and slay him
[1:08:53] tonight he ran toward towards his enemy
[1:08:56] you take the fight to him oh my it does
[1:08:59] something to somebody you get old big
[1:09:01] bully keeps bullying everybody around
[1:09:03] you let some little guy stand up and hit
[1:09:05] him in the nose it changes the way he
[1:09:07] bullies everybody
[1:09:08] around you he took the fight to his
[1:09:11] enemy well I'm you know how they do
[1:09:14] goodness I went to school too I remember
[1:09:16] what it was like in school you get up
[1:09:18] there to somebody be mad at you one toy
[1:09:20] they they draw That Old Line in the Sand
[1:09:22] you cross that line I'm going to whoop
[1:09:23] you then they step across line you draw
[1:09:25] another one you cross that line and I'm
[1:09:27] going to whoop you Crossing well you
[1:09:30] cross that line I'm really going to
[1:09:32] whoop you the whole time backing enough
[1:09:34] David didn't draw no lines he went right
[1:09:36] to the enemy the Bible said he hastened
[1:09:38] and he ran and he said I don't have to
[1:09:40] draw a line you've already crossed the
[1:09:42] line when you defied the army of the
[1:09:44] Living God you uncircumcised Philistine
[1:09:47] and they took the fight to the enemy's
[1:09:51] Camp he took the word of the Lord butam
[1:09:54] say see you'll find people the way they
[1:09:56] do they'll say I got started but the
[1:09:58] devil made me go back he said no the
[1:10:00] devil don't do that you had to do that
[1:10:01] yourself he said everybody that comes to
[1:10:04] God has got to be tempted and tried but
[1:10:06] a real believer has heard the word of
[1:10:08] God and he's recognized it to be the
[1:10:10] word of God and he will act upon it
[1:10:14] David had a word and he acted on the
[1:10:16] word of God he took God's word over the
[1:10:20] devil's word isn't it something I I
[1:10:22] thought this is so I always think this
[1:10:24] is good in this story you realize that
[1:10:25] in the Bible many times you'll find that
[1:10:27] a sword is a type of the word how many
[1:10:29] knows that I thought isn't it something
[1:10:31] that the Bible says but David slew
[1:10:34] Goliath with his own sword he to or he
[1:10:37] took his head off with his own sword I
[1:10:38] thought isn't that something that
[1:10:40] Goliath the words that he said to David
[1:10:42] he said but you he said the fouls of the
[1:10:44] air are going to eat your blood they're
[1:10:46] going to eat your flesh and the Very
[1:10:48] words that he spoke is the very thing
[1:10:50] that happened to him I thought isn't it
[1:10:52] something he got his head taken off by
[1:10:54] his own sword that's what happens to the
[1:10:56] devil the very thing that he speaks
[1:10:58] against the children of God is the very
[1:11:00] thing that he's bringing upon himself he
[1:11:02] couldn't overcome David his own word
[1:11:04] became his faith and David overcame
[1:11:07] because he remained under the Covenant
[1:11:08] of God he stayed under the word he
[1:11:11] wouldn't accept anything that came
[1:11:12] outside of the word that's how I can
[1:11:14] stand here confident this morning or
[1:11:15] tonight and say this that we can
[1:11:17] overcome the devil somebody say
[1:11:19] Amen why because I'm not looking through
[1:11:21] the flesh I'm looking through the
[1:11:22] Covenant like David did even when we
[1:11:25] just deserve death but we have a
[1:11:26] covenant we deserve judgment brother Ben
[1:11:28] but we have a covenant here's what the
[1:11:30] Bible said this is the Covenant that I
[1:11:32] will make with them after those days
[1:11:34] sayeth the Lord I will put my lws in
[1:11:36] their hearts and in their minds will I
[1:11:38] write them and their sins and iniquities
[1:11:40] will I remember no
[1:11:42] more when we ought to fall and we ought
[1:11:44] to face judgment and we ought to face
[1:11:46] death but thank God there's a covenant
[1:11:48] to stand under tonight by their faith in
[1:11:51] the blood of Jesus Christ Paul said the
[1:11:53] church would have access to God boldness
[1:11:56] he said to approach the throne of
[1:11:58] almighty God isn't that that's the
[1:12:00] character of a perfect son or daughter
[1:12:02] of God is to be both humble and bold
[1:12:05] you've heard me say that before in other
[1:12:07] words they were humble they were humble
[1:12:09] in their Spirit but bold in their faith
[1:12:12] that's a perfect character humble in
[1:12:14] their Spirit but bold boldness Paul said
[1:12:16] to enter into the holiest how do we have
[1:12:18] that boldness he said by the blood of
[1:12:20] Jesus Christ by a New and Living Way
[1:12:23] he's consecrated us through the fa that
[1:12:25] is to say the flesh you say well what
[1:12:27] speak is he or what flesh is he speaking
[1:12:29] of the Flesh of the Son of God couldn't
[1:12:31] be my flesh My Flesh would fail couldn't
[1:12:33] be your flesh our flesh isn't worthy
[1:12:35] enough we couldn't enter we couldn't
[1:12:36] enter into the Throne of God based on
[1:12:39] our own flesh he said but by the Flesh
[1:12:41] of the Son of God we are Sanctified
[1:12:43] through the offering of the body of
[1:12:45] Jesus Christ once and for all I'm about
[1:12:47] to close he said every priest standing
[1:12:50] daily ministering and offering often
[1:12:52] times the same sacrifices they'll never
[1:12:54] take away sins but this man after he
[1:12:56] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:12:58] he sat down on the right hand of God
[1:13:00] from henceforth expecting until en his
[1:13:02] enemies be made his foot stol isn't that
[1:13:06] something he was perfected Forever by
[1:13:09] one offering he hath perfected forever
[1:13:13] them that are
[1:13:14] Sanctified now don't take that that
[1:13:16] sanctification is perfection because
[1:13:18] that ain't what he was teaching but
[1:13:20] you'll never be perfected without
[1:13:22] sanctification see he was perfected to
[1:13:25] see if the worshipper the Bible said
[1:13:26] when the worshipper once purged would
[1:13:28] have no more conscience of sin and he by
[1:13:30] his own sacrifice has perfected forever
[1:13:32] those that are Sanctified but man said
[1:13:34] perfected for how long isn't that good
[1:13:37] perfected for how long he said they're
[1:13:40] perfect
[1:13:43] forever then what is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] friend he said we've allowed too many
[1:13:47] things the Lutheran say well you join
[1:13:48] the Lutheran Church the just shall live
[1:13:50] by faith we must got it he said but they
[1:13:52] found out they didn't the me says well
[1:13:53] when you're Sanctified you sh and
[1:13:55] clapped your hands you run up and down
[1:13:56] the aisle you had it but they found out
[1:13:58] they didn't the Pentecostal said you
[1:13:59] could speak in tongues and dance in the
[1:14:01] spirit they thought they had it but they
[1:14:02] found out they didn't all those things
[1:14:04] are all right but it is not Perfection
[1:14:08] it ain't it it ain't Perfection but he
[1:14:10] said but it's the person the Holy Spirit
[1:14:13] himself the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:14:17] when you can lay your hands glory to God
[1:14:19] by faith upon God's accepted and
[1:14:21] provided sacrifice which was absolutely
[1:14:24] perfect there's the body of Christ that
[1:14:26] lay there before you out of Adam's side
[1:14:29] came a rib that made his bride he said
[1:14:31] but out of Christ's side came the spirit
[1:14:33] for his bride so how do we get into the
[1:14:35] body by one Spirit the B Bible said
[1:14:37] we're baptized into one body Paul said
[1:14:40] now there is no condemnation to them
[1:14:42] that are in Christ Jesus that walk not
[1:14:45] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:14:49] perfected forever as the music player
[1:14:50] come think about it the perfected
[1:14:53] forever Paul said said for the law if
[1:14:55] you want to stand to your feet he said
[1:14:56] for the law of the spirit of Life In
[1:14:58] Christ hath made me free from the law of
[1:15:02] sin and death it was a pardon of God a
[1:15:07] demand a call of God to be made perfect
[1:15:11] and then God would Supply away or
[1:15:13] provide way that Perfection would come
[1:15:17] my isn't it wonderful A Perfect Bride a
[1:15:20] sinless bride I ain't got time to read
[1:15:21] all of it a virtuous bride the very very
[1:15:25] image of almighty God perfect in the
[1:15:27] sight of God I know we look at one
[1:15:29] another you may not see that Perfection
[1:15:31] but when God looks at you that's what he
[1:15:33] sees I can tell you that you we get so
[1:15:36] guilty about all the the things we do
[1:15:38] you can't even look at yourself in the
[1:15:39] mirror feel perfect we're so guilty said
[1:15:42] but what's what this pardon from God
[1:15:43] does can I read this he said that pardon
[1:15:46] from God it'll release you from your
[1:15:50] guilt see that's what I wish to place on
[1:15:53] this a pardon from God
[1:15:55] is a release from guilt the very thing
[1:15:58] that Satan would use to hold you the
[1:16:01] very thing that that he would use to
[1:16:02] you're little you're a little Christian
[1:16:05] why you you can't even get past past the
[1:16:07] first day you're you're just a little
[1:16:09] Christian you always fall you ain't you
[1:16:12] ain't never going to be a big Christian
[1:16:13] you're you're a nobody Christian why
[1:16:14] they don't ever even use you at church
[1:16:16] they they never they never want to hear
[1:16:17] you sing they never want to hear you
[1:16:19] preach why because you're too
[1:16:22] little guilt and guilt
[1:16:25] said but no listen to all that a pardon
[1:16:28] from God is release from you not the
[1:16:31] Turning Away of some psychological doctr
[1:16:33] of some sort they give you a little
[1:16:34] feeling that you've done what's right by
[1:16:36] joining Church taking up some Creed but
[1:16:38] a pardon from God is a release from your
[1:16:40] guilt by the power of Calvary a perfect
[1:16:45] sacrifice might it something and the
[1:16:48] Bible says now we for if the worshipper
[1:16:50] once purged would have no more
[1:16:52] conscience of sin but he by his own
[1:16:55] sacrifice has perfected forever those
[1:16:58] that are Sanctified I wonder how many
[1:17:00] worshippers are here tonight they say
[1:17:02] brother mad I want to put my hand on the
[1:17:05] sacrifice I ain't going by my own life I
[1:17:07] wonder if there's some worshippers that
[1:17:09] can rise up tonight say not by my own
[1:17:11] marit not by my own feelings or my own
[1:17:13] my own uh things but by the blood of
[1:17:16] Jesus Christ I Rise to what God has made
[1:17:19] me I say let us rise tonight the
[1:17:22] worshippers of almighty God that's been
[1:17:24] perfected in his sight ain't no sense in
[1:17:27] being down Church you may as well rise
