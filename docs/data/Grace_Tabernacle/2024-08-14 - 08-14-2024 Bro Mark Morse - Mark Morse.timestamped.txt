[37:03] fathom in your sin conditions you didn't
[37:05] know nothing about it but then one day
[37:07] when he came and that's where the
[37:09] amazement comes from that's how I know
[37:12] that I'm
[37:13] amazed amen you love the Lord this
[37:16] evening amen won't you give him a hand
[37:18] clap of
[37:22] Praise amen musicians you can be seated
[37:25] if you want to uh I just just like to
[37:27] take a moment
[37:30] and I guess testify a little
[37:33] bit I don't mean to get all choked up
[37:36] but when you've worked as hard as you
[37:38] have for something and you
[37:41] don't see the fruition of it for a long
[37:44] time but then all of a sudden God turns
[37:47] it
[37:49] around it's like in the Midnight Hour
[37:51] it's like there was no way that I was
[37:53] getting a job and I worked so hard for
[37:54] it and I was wondering why why are we
[37:58] why are we still not getting a job you
[37:59] know when you get you mean many of you
[38:01] have looked for jobs and you get you go
[38:03] to interviews and things like that and
[38:06] they seem like everybody turns you down
[38:07] nobody wants you kind of takes the
[38:11] excitement and the joy out of finishing
[38:13] school because you you start getting
[38:15] worried about bills and you start
[38:16] getting worried about uh student loans
[38:18] and things like that but then that call
[38:22] came last
[38:23] minute and I just like to thank the Lord
[38:26] for what he's done for me
[38:28] it it's been a hard Road and I realized
[38:33] um my voice is a little weak y'all be
[38:36] praying for that and y'all keep me
[38:37] turned up but I've been talking for two
[38:39] days straight and I uh honestly I've
[38:42] been repeating myself for two days
[38:45] straight and you know I just you look at
[38:48] you get in a classroom full of kids and
[38:50] you realize that
[39:00] you realize what they come out of and
[39:03] you know all the other teachers and sit
[39:04] around and they talk about how bad the
[39:06] kids are and you know they can't handle
[39:08] them and they can't do this and they
[39:10] can't do that then you look at them and
[39:11] you realize that many of them don't have
[39:15] parents many of them come out of drugs
[39:18] and alcoholism and they don't have
[39:20] nobody to turn to
[39:29] I don't mean to be a baby but some I've
[39:33] really fought
[39:35] for and I hope and pray that each and
[39:38] every person in this church would would
[39:40] would pray with me about these kids
[39:42] because up in that area there there's a
[39:45] lot of them a lot of kids there that are
[39:47] that are going through a lot of things
[39:49] and some of those teachers they don't
[39:50] quite understand that they don't quite
[39:52] want to see that they just see the

[44:13] amen you can be seated
[44:16] tonight I got another scripture that I
[44:18] want to I want to uh uh read tonight it
[44:23] says in Hebrews 10 chapter
[44:27] uh Hebrews 10
[44:29] and4 it said the Bible says for it is
[44:32] not possible that the blood of bulls and
[44:35] of goat should take away sins wherefore
[44:37] when he cometh into the world he saith
[44:39] sacrifice an offering thou wouldest not
[44:42] but a body thou prepared me in burnt
[44:44] offering and sacrifices for sin thou H
[44:46] has had no pleasure then said lo I come
[44:49] in the volume of the book that is
[44:50] written of me to do thy will oh God
[44:52] above when he said sacrifice and
[44:54] offerings and burn offerings are
[44:56] offering for sin thou wouldest not
[44:58] neither hadst pleasure therein which are
[45:00] offered by the law then said he lo I
[45:03] come to do thy will oh God he taketh
[45:05] away the first that me that he may
[45:08] establish the second by the which while
[45:10] we are all which we which will we are
[45:14] Sanctified through the offering of the
[45:16] body of Jesus Christ once for all and
[45:19] every priest standeth daily ministering
[45:21] and offering often times the same
[45:23] sacrifices which can never take away
[45:25] sins
[45:27] but this man after he had offered one
[45:30] sacrifice for sins
[45:32] forever sat down on the right hand of
[45:35] God from hence forth expecting till his
[45:38] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[45:42] offering he hath perfected forever them
[45:45] that are
[45:46] Sanctified amen I had another scripture
[45:48] but apparently I didn't write that one
[45:51] down amen when you speak of sacrifices
[45:54] you go back and you hear brother brandom
[45:56] talk about the very first sacrifice that
[45:58] was ever made that when Adam and Eve
[46:00] were in the garden he that he went and
[46:02] he heard what they did God went
[46:04] searching for Adam and went crying for
[46:06] Adam and thank God that he did and Adam
[46:09] came to him and he said Adam what have
[46:10] you done and he told him what he had
[46:12] done and then God knew by his law that
[46:14] he had to take Adam and Eve and kick
[46:16] them out of the garden he had to cast
[46:18] them out because his law had said that
[46:20] they couldn't do that his word had said
[46:22] that they weren't allowed to do that so
[46:24] God in his love and in his Mercy went
[46:27] back behind the bushes and he went and
[46:29] got a a a goat he went and got a pure
[46:32] lamb and he took that lamb and he slew
[46:35] that
[46:37] lamb amen he took that lamb and he slew
[46:41] it and he took the bloody sheep skin and
[46:43] he placed them over Adam and Eve and as
[46:45] they walked out of the garden you could
[46:46] hear the the bloody the the the bloody
[46:49] sheep SK slapping against their legs
[46:51] what a sorry sight that it was what a
[46:53] pitiful sight that it was what a bad
[46:56] thing that it was that they had sit
[46:58] there and they had disobeyed God to that
[47:00] point but the love of Adam constrained
[47:02] him the love of Adam said I want to take
[47:05] her and I want to go out into this place
[47:07] that love that Adam held but there was
[47:09] another man that died one day it was a
[47:11] second Adam and his name was Jesus and
[47:13] in that first offering that God begin to
[47:16] begin to show them that it took her
[47:18] blood no matter what happened no matter
[47:20] what sin no matter what they did it took
[47:22] a blood offering and the priesthood that
[47:25] that when they needed blood offering
[47:27] that it was so it was such a thing it
[47:29] was such a if I could find the right
[47:32] word it it was such a uh I can't think
[47:35] of the right word it was so
[47:39] uh man somebody helped me here I can't
[47:41] think of the right word I'm trying to
[47:42] look for here it was such a
[47:46] uh it was such a pressure on them
[47:50] there's a better word for that brother
[47:52] Joe needs to help me now here I can't
[47:54] think of a word but it was such a
[47:56] pressure it was such such a PO had to be
[47:57] so perfect that that sacrifice had to be
[48:00] so perfect and they would begin to
[48:03] sacrifice and they would look through
[48:04] these things and they had to do certain
[48:05] little things they followed every dot
[48:08] they followed every tit they dotted
[48:10] every eye matter of fact those priests
[48:12] could take Scrolls and roll them up and
[48:14] put a pin through them and tell you
[48:15] every letter that it touched it was such
[48:17] a Perfection and you watch it as they
[48:20] went down throughout the time that that
[48:22] it become a tradition to him and I you
[48:25] know what I got to thinking about just
[48:26] in the last few days that a lot of you
[48:28] young people you have come home from uh
[48:31] from from camp and those things that
[48:33] you've come home from and and a lot of
[48:36] times that the camp might become you
[48:38] know it's a joyous it's a happy time
[48:40] it's it's a joyful time and you get the
[48:42] spirit of the Lord on you and you feel
[48:44] the presence of God on you and you get a
[48:46] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[48:47] Ghost but let me tell you something when
[48:49] you walk out of that camp you need to
[48:51] maintain that whole thing when you buy a
[48:53] brand new car if you don't maintain that
[48:55] car there's going to be problems down
[48:56] down the road and you'll find it that as
[48:58] you as you use this as an example as you
[49:01] buy a new car well when you get a car
[49:04] you you need to change the oil every
[49:05] 3,000 miles don't correct me on this
[49:08] brother but you you have to change the
[49:10] oil every so often if you don't what
[49:12] happens what begins to happen I'm
[49:15] starting to ask you questions I told you
[49:16] that teacher thing was going to come out
[49:17] in me I'm waiting on a response but I'll
[49:20] try not to do that that that when you
[49:23] begin to do that your car starts running
[49:24] sluggish and it starts running sluggish
[49:27] and the oil starts to go bad then coal
[49:29] packs start to go out coal packs start
[49:31] to go out their coils are starting to
[49:33] blow you know Pistons are starting to
[49:35] pop and things are starting to happen
[49:37] because you haven't maintained that
[49:39] vehicle in the correct way you haven't
[49:41] done what it should be done and I say
[49:43] that that that when you leave a church
[49:45] camp that when you leave there that that
[49:47] or when you leave church at all you have
[49:49] got to maintain your life as a Christian
[49:51] if you don't maintain if you don't do
[49:53] some maintenance if you don't do some
[49:55] practicing there's going to be problems
[49:57] there's going to be issues that you're
[49:58] not going to be able to see there's
[50:00] going to be things that that's down in
[50:02] that motor that you can't find and
[50:04] you're going to be going what in the
[50:05] world is going on with this thing
[50:07] there's going to be times when you're
[50:08] driving down a road and there's no power
[50:10] in your vehicle and as a Christian
[50:12] sometimes if you don't make the right
[50:14] maintenance you get to trugging along
[50:16] and you start and you push the gas pill
[50:18] and nothing happens you got no power
[50:21] anymore you can't go down the road and
[50:23] and you watch that and I think that's a
[50:25] lot of times why people kind of start
[50:27] you see new Christians and how they
[50:28] struggle and how they fight some some of
[50:30] them don't do that some of them are
[50:31] ready to go some of them's like a
[50:33] Lamborghini up in here they take and
[50:35] they push the gas pill and they're going
[50:37] somewhere but some of some of us is like
[50:39] an old truck you know it just takes us a
[50:41] minute to get moving but if you start
[50:43] maintaining you start cleaning your
[50:44] motor up a little bit you start doing
[50:46] those things take it to the car wash and
[50:48] get it washed a little bit start putting
[50:50] your oil where your oil needs to go
[50:52] start greasing where it needs to be
[50:53] greased and I tell you what you might
[50:55] not get down Road as fast as the
[50:57] Lamborghini will but you're headed down
[50:59] the road it's got four wheels and you're
[51:01] driving somewhere and I thank God that I
[51:03] can drive somewhere it might take me a
[51:05] minute it might take me a minute to get
[51:07] started it might take me a few days to
[51:09] get it going right but I promise you I'm
[51:11] going to get it right because God got a
[51:13] maintenance schedule and it's down on my
[51:15] knees and when I begin to pray God
[51:17] begins to do things the spirit of the
[51:19] Lord drops down into my heart it drops
[51:21] down into my life without that thing
[51:23] that that sluggish that thing that
[51:25] that's pulling at me that that I can't
[51:27] get through that I can't just battle
[51:28] through and God comes along with a
[51:30] little bit of grease and he starts
[51:32] squirting a little grease over here a
[51:34] little bit of Grease over there and oh I
[51:37] tell you why he start squirting a little
[51:38] grease right here I can't quite raise my
[51:41] hand up but when he begins to squirt
[51:42] that little grease up in that joint
[51:44] right there you start oh it's a little
[51:46] better oh it might take a minute it
[51:48] might take a minute to get that grease
[51:50] to get to flowing and get it to moving
[51:52] around the joint but as you begin to
[51:54] move it just a minute you're up here and
[51:56] you're going oh Hallelujah I'm back up
[51:58] here again I oh I was down here a little
[52:01] bit but now I'm back up here it takes a
[52:03] little bit of greas to get going
[52:05] sometimes and that's your scripture you
[52:07] take your scripture and you start
[52:08] reading the Bible and you start applying
[52:11] the Bible you start applying those
[52:12] things in your life and many times that
[52:14] we fall to do that and we get down the
[52:16] road and we can't go anymore we can't go
[52:19] anymore and you want to quit you want to
[52:21] give up you want to stop and then you
[52:24] start looking at everybody else and what
[52:26] they're doing well why are they doing it
[52:28] this way well they've been greased up a
[52:30] little bit why they keep shouting
[52:32] Hallelujah well they've been greased up
[52:33] a little bit they got a little bit of
[52:35] fire that fire can get down in their
[52:37] motor amen do you love the Lord tonight
[52:40] I begin to talk about
[52:42] application amen just maintain your
[52:45] sacrifice don't let it become a
[52:47] tradition to you don't let it do what
[52:49] they did you've got to apply something
[52:51] and you find it that in the scriptures
[52:53] during the Passover when when God went
[52:55] through and he told Moses he said you
[52:57] tell them to to apply the blood you tell
[53:01] them to apply the blood and their first
[53:03] born won't die and they took that blood
[53:06] and they took a simple little weed
[53:07] called a hasip weed and they went down
[53:10] over Oh Glory they went down over their
[53:12] door and they applied the blood over
[53:13] their door they applied it on the sides
[53:15] of their door they applied it every
[53:17] single place where it needed to be
[53:19] applied they didn't miss one thing
[53:21] because that's what God Said do God said
[53:23] this is where you apply this is how you
[53:25] do it and it's it's time to apply the
[53:27] blood this evening it's time to apply it

[1:05:22] the blood speaks better things the blood
[1:05:24] is speaking and the blood has got a
[1:05:26] voice and the voice of the blood is the
[1:05:28] word hallelujah that's what makes it

[1:05:59] and sorrow in the New Testament it
[1:06:01] speaks of resurrection and life it
[1:06:04] speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it
[1:06:07] speaks of power it speaks of life it
[1:06:10] speaks of heaven and that same blood
[1:06:12] that was shed upon the CR that called
[1:06:14] out after his dead brother or called out
[1:06:16] after his brother that had killed him
[1:06:18] the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of
[1:06:20] our sins and speaks peace and
[1:06:22] resurrection and power and life and
[1:06:25] healing and all the Redemptive blessings
[1:06:28] that the blood was shed for her it
[1:06:30] speaks for her certainly the blood
[1:06:32] speaks oh
[1:06:34] my I got to thinking about the blood
[1:06:36] speaking and I remembered that there was
[1:06:39] a thief that was laying on the cross
[1:06:41] right next to him this man that had did
[1:06:44] that had done wrong his entire life had
[1:06:46] no clue about who Jesus was he's laying
[1:06:50] there and Jesus speaks to him and he
[1:06:53] cries out to Jesus one teeth mocks him
[1:06:55] and the other one says what are you
[1:06:57] talking about we've been thieves our
[1:06:58] whole life we've done these things our
[1:07:00] whole life but that man has never done a
[1:07:02] thing wrong and Jesus tells him this day
[1:07:05] you'll be with me in Paradise that was
[1:07:07] the speaking of the blood of
[1:07:09] Jesus
[1:07:12] Amen you know I think about we was I got
[1:07:16] way ahead of myself but you talk about
[1:07:18] the blood the blood was so powerful the
[1:07:22] blood of Jesus Christ was so powerful
[1:07:25] that it didn't just flow for you and I
[1:07:28] that blood went backwards it went back
[1:07:30] into time it picked up Abraham it picked
[1:07:33] up Isaac they picked up Jacob all those
[1:07:35] men that that that had made those
[1:07:37] sacrifices and all those sacrifices of
[1:07:40] blood and Bulls and ghosts all they did
[1:07:42] was push their sins forward and push
[1:07:43] their sins forward and push their sins
[1:07:45] forward and they're standing there
[1:07:47] hoping that somebody would come and get
[1:07:49] them hoping that somebody will come save
[1:07:51] them and then there come a knock upon
[1:07:53] the door and they open the door and they
[1:07:55] said there he is one of them said he's
[1:07:57] the will in the middle of the whe
[1:07:59] there's that Jesus there's my savior

[1:11:08] my allegiance I pledged it to the blood
[1:11:10] of the Lamb that's where my allegiance
[1:11:13] lies and when the Devil comes back you
[1:11:15] raise that Banner you raise that flag
[1:11:18] and say here it is he's what I'm under

[1:11:35] Heaven you can take it up with those
[1:11:37] Affairs of Heaven matter of fact you
[1:11:39] won't you just go straight to the throne
[1:11:41] room and talk to Jesus about
[1:11:44] it just go to him you can have a
[1:11:46] conversation with him because I'm not
[1:11:48] leaning near to
[1:11:49] you amen how do you think old Barabas
[1:11:52] felt that morning when you heard the
[1:11:54] Roman coming and the big from the
[1:11:56] galleries has the big Iron shoes topping
[1:11:59] along the chains rattling the spear
[1:12:01] dragging on the street to know what he
[1:12:03] was going to be killed when he opened up
[1:12:05] the door and Barabas trembling and
[1:12:08] crying ready to run out saying oh this
[1:12:10] is the end of me said Barabas you're
[1:12:12] pardon free Barabas said why he said
[1:12:16] ain't I going to die sure said no you
[1:12:18] don't have to die well what did I have
[1:12:21] to do for it nothing
[1:12:25] well how did this come then the
[1:12:27] Centurion would have raised him around
[1:12:29] and said
[1:12:31] see heyen we get a lot of that in the
[1:12:34] scriptures when God just says look there
[1:12:37] was a time that when the fiery serpents
[1:12:39] were released under the children of
[1:12:40] Israel that God raised up a brass
[1:12:43] Serpent and he said just look at that
[1:12:44] brass Serpent and you'll be healed there
[1:12:47] was a time that when Moses was standing
[1:12:48] there when the battle was arrive when
[1:12:51] the battle was when they were getting
[1:12:52] weak and they they couldn't fight the
[1:12:53] battle anymore the that the the the sons
[1:12:57] went up to to Moses and he said as long
[1:12:59] as your hands are in the air that's when
[1:13:01] we know when the battle is being W and
[1:13:03] Moses got a little war out he got a
[1:13:06] little tired and His Hands would begin
[1:13:07] to drop and the battle would get a
[1:13:09] little harder and they looked at Moses
[1:13:12] and two of them went to him and said you
[1:13:13] know what we know that his hands when
[1:13:15] they're up that we're winning the
[1:13:17] battle we know when it's there they we
[1:13:20] winning the fight we know when it's
[1:13:22] there so they went to Moses and and they
[1:13:24] pulled up a rock and they put it
[1:13:26] underneath him and they set Moses down
[1:13:28] upon the rock and they set him down and
[1:13:31] they held his hands up they held them up
[1:13:34] so they could look they were in the
[1:13:36] middle of the storm they were in the
[1:13:38] middle of the battle there was Bloodshed
[1:13:40] going on around them there was dirt and
[1:13:42] I don't know if you've ever been in a
[1:13:43] battle but there's a lot of stuff going
[1:13:46] on in there there's a lot of nonsense
[1:13:48] going on there's there you can't hear
[1:13:50] nothing you can't see nothing you don't
[1:13:52] even know who you fighting half the time
[1:13:54] but they could look up and they would
[1:13:55] see Moses standing there with his hands
[1:13:58] raised up and they knew the victory was
[1:14:00] not and it wasn't just a little bit that
[1:14:02] the victory was won but I say unto you
[1:14:05] that all you had to do is look to the
[1:14:07] cross of Calvary his hands didn't have
[1:14:10] to be held up by somebody because they
[1:14:12] took the nails and they nailed him to
[1:14:14] that cross and he stood there and His
[1:14:17] Hands never dropped and he won the
[1:14:19] battle he never dropped till he won the
[1:14:21] war it never dropped until he filled it
[1:14:25] all 300 some OD prophecies were
[1:14:28] fulfilled by that moment and I can say
[1:14:30] unto you if Jesus Christ would not have
[1:14:33] got up out of that tomb we wouldn't be
[1:14:35] standing here but Hallelujah he come out
[1:14:37] of the Tomb I say there's prophets that
[1:14:39] are laying in tombs in many different
[1:14:41] places there's gods that they call gods
[1:14:44] that are laying in tubs there's popes
[1:14:46] that are laying in tubes that they've
[1:14:48] got they've got horses waiting on them
[1:14:50] to come up and my savior already rose up
[1:14:53] and the blood of Jesus Christ has come
[1:14:55] out he come out of the Tom and I thank
[1:14:58] God that I can look and see I
[1:15:02] don't I can look and
[1:15:05] see a lot of people they stop at the
[1:15:09] cross I don't don't don't please do not
[1:15:12] take this wrong but that's where they
[1:15:14] stop I got a lot of Baptist friends
[1:15:17] that's where they stop well I claim the
[1:15:19] blood I claim the blood I'm a Christian
[1:15:22] and go out and keep drinking go out and
[1:15:25] keep drugging well I had one experience
[1:15:27] with him but there's something came
[1:15:30] after the cross he said I'll send you
[1:15:32] somebody else he said I'll send you the
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost and that's a whole new ball
[1:15:37] game right there you can be saved but
[1:15:39] when the Holy Ghost comes in you there
[1:15:41] begins to become a power and an
[1:15:43] authority in your life that no devil can
[1:15:46] handle no Spirit can handle I talk about
[1:15:49] when the blood is shed over your life
[1:15:51] and the Holy Ghost comes down into you
[1:15:53] it brings you to a different
[1:15:56] level it brings you to a different place
[1:15:58] they try that's why they can't do it
[1:16:00] with pamphlets that's why they can't do
[1:16:02] it with cards and and things they want
[1:16:04] to handle you just say the sinner's
[1:16:06] prayer and you'll be okay I don't
[1:16:08] believe that I don't believe that one
[1:16:11] bit take another step and you want to
[1:16:14] look at them be like well okay why is
[1:16:16] your denomination dying off they said to
[1:16:19] the Catholic Church one
[1:16:22] time the Catholic Church you know in the
[1:16:25] 1600s they started getting extremely
[1:16:27] powerful right before that
[1:16:30] 365 was the the one of the Heights and
[1:16:33] we all know about that so they started
[1:16:35] gaining money they started selling
[1:16:37] Indulgence and one of them I don't
[1:16:40] remember who it was or where it was but
[1:16:43] he started talking he said you know what
[1:16:45] no longer does a Catholic Church have to
[1:16:48] say Silver and Gold Have I None then one
[1:16:51] of them old preachers looked over and he
[1:16:53] went yeah and neither can they say take
[1:16:55] up thy bed and walk
[1:16:58] either they can't say that won't you
[1:17:00] give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:17:02] Praise amen they can't say that anymore
[1:17:06] but I can say that because I've seen it
[1:17:08] done I've seen the dead raised
[1:17:10] underneath the Holy Ghost I've seen
[1:17:12] blinded eyes open I've seen cancers
[1:17:15] healed I've seen Spirits kicked off of
[1:17:17] people I've seen people so addicted to
[1:17:19] drugs that their face was sunken in
[1:17:21] their teeth were gone but the next time
[1:17:23] you saw them there was a joy upon their
[1:17:25] face because they were filled with the
[1:17:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost they came
[1:17:29] running from sin sick conditions they
[1:17:33] came running to Jesus they came finding
[1:17:35] Jesus they came looking for Jesus and no
[1:17:38] they didn't even have to come look for
[1:17:39] him cuz he went looking for them amen he
[1:17:42] said come follow me it's what he
[1:17:46] said amen I thank God that he brought me
[1:17:49] out of my condition amen I was
[1:17:52] dark but the day that I was dark
[1:17:55] I didn't want to believe anymore I
[1:17:58] didn't want to believe the message I
[1:17:59] don't believe none of it I didn't care I
[1:18:02] was looking for another
[1:18:05] party Hallelujah he saved
[1:18:08] me the voice came looking for me the
[1:18:13] voice found me the voice healed
[1:18:19] me
[1:18:22] amen BR see
[1:18:27] look and
[1:18:28] see the Bible says in Luke
[1:18:30] 21 and then shall they see the son of
[1:18:33] man coming in a cloud with power and
[1:18:37] great Glory what have we seen in this
[1:18:39] day
[1:18:42] oh amen we seen the son of man coming we
[1:18:47] seen him coming in a cloud and he looked
[1:18:49] out over his people you look at the
[1:18:51] cloud and you see that and you brother R
[1:18:53] talks about it being judgment but
[1:18:55] there's another side to that he's
[1:18:57] looking out and he's telling you I'm
[1:18:59] coming I'm coming home I'm coming to get
[1:19:01] you and there was a word that was ripped
[1:19:03] open and the spirit of the Lord started
[1:19:06] moving in his people he started moving
[1:19:08] in the message of the hour and it was
[1:19:09] such a power and authority that that
[1:19:12] they
[1:19:13] couldn't oh Hallelujah they couldn't
[1:19:15] handle it I I I don't mean I don't know
[1:19:17] what else to say I don't know how to say
[1:19:19] if they couldn't handle it they had no
[1:19:21] idea what was going on they they were
[1:19:24] saying God sent a prophet and that's as
[1:19:26] far as they went they were saying that
[1:19:28] he's still on the cross and that's as
[1:19:30] far as they went but here's another
[1:19:33] place to that there's a place that you
[1:19:35] can go into at then brother BR calls
[1:19:38] sometimes he calls them untapped
[1:19:40] resources if you were
[1:19:42] Lord I tell you what there's a power in
[1:19:45] the message that we need come in contact
[1:19:47] with and I feel the presence of the Lord
[1:19:49] in here that there's a power in the
[1:19:51] message of the hour that we haven't even
[1:19:53] touched yet that we haven't seen yet if
[1:19:55] you'll just reach and get a hold of that
[1:19:57] and you'll start hearing the voice of
[1:19:59] God call upon you you'll start seeing
[1:20:02] those things begin to happen you'll
[1:20:04] start seeing Lambs begin to be restored
[1:20:06] you'll see dead people raised you'll see
[1:20:08] people rising up and walking you'll see
[1:20:11] these things in the glory of God and you
[1:20:13] can say hallelujah I'm a part of the
[1:20:15] message of the hour and there ain't no
[1:20:17] devil can tell me that it's anything
[1:20:21] else I know if you ain't seen or heard
[1:20:23] yet I don't care nothing about that
[1:20:25] stinking devil that's trying to take
[1:20:26] away from you I don't care nothing about
[1:20:29] him I say take the gloves
[1:20:33] off go to your homes and take the boxing
[1:20:35] gloves off and go to
[1:20:38] fighting we've got a word we got a sword
[1:20:42] we got a sword we can go to fighting
[1:20:46] with you might not even know how to
[1:20:48] swing it but I remember preaching that
[1:20:49] one time you walk in your house just
[1:20:51] close your eyes and start swinging
[1:20:55] I'm sick of the
[1:20:56] devil I'm sick of him in my home I'm
[1:21:00] sick of him on my teenagers I'm sick of
[1:21:02] him on my family I'm tired of the the
[1:21:07] the the disunity tired of all that I'm
[1:21:11] tired of fussing and fighting with
[1:21:13] people over the message of the hour I'm
[1:21:15] tired of fussing and fighting with
[1:21:16] people over what church you go to and
[1:21:18] what church you don't go to I'm tired of
[1:21:21] people saying all kinds of junk and
[1:21:23] nonsense and I don't care nothing about
[1:21:24] I'm tired of people running
[1:21:27] there amen people want to talk about and
[1:21:31] I'm going to say this slightly Andel
[1:21:33] knows I get carried away
[1:21:37] sometimes I've heard
[1:21:39] people fussing a little bit about the
[1:21:41] camps and things and then want to look
[1:21:43] at them be like what have you done
[1:21:46] lately what have you
[1:21:48] done have you got a place where a
[1:21:51] thousand young people can go to and
[1:21:52] serve the Lord
[1:21:54] what have you
[1:21:56] done that's what I'm tired of I'm tired
[1:21:59] of my own critical self looking at
[1:22:01] people and fussing about people what
[1:22:04] they're
[1:22:05] doing because I get brother I actually
[1:22:07] heard this this week brother Ram says
[1:22:09] I'm too critical the Lord started
[1:22:11] dealing with him on it he was too
[1:22:13] critical I don't want to be critical I
[1:22:16] want to claim the blood of Jesus if
[1:22:18] you're doing something for the Lord go
[1:22:19] do something for the Lord it don't
[1:22:21] matter what you're doing that's between
[1:22:23] you and God
[1:22:26] that's between you and the Lord that's
[1:22:28] who that
[1:22:30] is and I also want to ask people
[1:22:33] sometimes well where's your
[1:22:35] Vindication they want to you get people
[1:22:37] getting on podcast and all this stuff
[1:22:39] okay well where's your
[1:22:41] Vindication where's the pillar of fire
[1:22:43] in your life where's the spirit of God
[1:22:46] in your life where's it at I want you to
[1:22:49] show me you go back to the Mormons or
[1:22:52] the the Jesus the latterday Saints you
[1:22:56] listen to their testimonies you listen
[1:22:57] to how they talk and what they
[1:23:00] say they start talking about Joseph
[1:23:02] Smith and what he
[1:23:04] did I don't know if it was Joseph Smith
[1:23:07] was Joseph Smith right okay they started
[1:23:10] talking about that an angel came to him
[1:23:12] gave him a book and the angel took it
[1:23:15] back but an angel came the word of the
[1:23:19] Lord came Christ came it wasn't an angel
[1:23:23] it was Christ himself turned and he
[1:23:26] opened the book and oh Hallelujah and he
[1:23:28] Loos the seals and it wasn't just
[1:23:31] judgment being spoke it was something
[1:23:33] that the Bride of Jesus Christ could see
[1:23:35] your name written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:23:37] Life you could see your name written
[1:23:40] down in there when you didn't see it
[1:23:42] before you didn't know it before you had
[1:23:44] no idea before now you can open the book
[1:23:47] and you can see your name written there
[1:23:49] beside the names of Paul beside the
[1:23:51] names of Peter beside the names of John
[1:23:54] beside the names of the Apostles beside
[1:23:56] the names of the Saints you can look in
[1:23:58] there and you can see it and there's
[1:23:59] going to be a time when you walk over in
[1:24:01] the glory that they're going to meet you
[1:24:03] right there and they're going to ask you
[1:24:05] how in the world did you get through
[1:24:07] that dying tribulation time how did oh
[1:24:10] not the tribulations we ain't going
[1:24:11] through that but how in the world did
[1:24:13] you get through the darkest hour of all
[1:24:15] time and you're going to tell them the
[1:24:17] blood the voice of the blood called out
[1:24:21] to me one day and I took that banner and
[1:24:23] I put it over my home and the spirit of
[1:24:25] the Lord came to my life and he started
[1:24:27] moving things out of the way he oh it
[1:24:30] may not it may have took a few days
[1:24:32] sometimes it don't take a second but
[1:24:34] sometimes it might take a few days a
[1:24:36] little bit of tearing a little bit of
[1:24:38] praying and God will move those things
[1:24:40] out of your life I'm a witness of it I
[1:24:42] know that that'll
[1:24:44] happen amen are you happy for the blood
[1:24:48] amen you're happy for the
[1:24:51] voice amen we got to listen to The Voice
[1:24:58] I was I don't was listening to something
[1:25:00] the other day
[1:25:01] and come across this
[1:25:05] uh I don't even know what else this
[1:25:07] do but it was a a man he was a a pastor
[1:25:11] a
[1:25:12] lawyer he was coming back from
[1:25:15] Alaska and one of the people that were
[1:25:18] there with him saidwell I'm a pilot
[1:25:19] won't you just go with me he said well
[1:25:20] we've already got our tickets no I'll
[1:25:22] just do it for free
[1:25:24] and the pilot when they left he they got
[1:25:27] in there with him the pilot took off and
[1:25:30] he told him he said he said he goes you
[1:25:33] know what sometimes when I'm up in my
[1:25:35] plane it's a little you know four seat
[1:25:37] or SES something like that when I get up
[1:25:39] in my
[1:25:40] plane that that I'll pass out he's like
[1:25:44] whoa so he got up in the clouds they got
[1:25:47] into a he gets in like a cloud bank so
[1:25:50] they got up in the cloud sure enough
[1:25:52] their pilot passes out
[1:25:56] is it okay if I just read that that
[1:25:58] little bit to
[1:26:01] you and I'm going to start in the middle
[1:26:03] of the story he said eventually they
[1:26:04] found themselves flying through dense
[1:26:06] clouds of no visibility the pilot became
[1:26:08] disoriented and passed out his eyes
[1:26:10] actually rolled back into his head
[1:26:12] unconscious his passenger Pastor shook
[1:26:15] him violently trying to wake him up the
[1:26:17] lawyer sitting in the back seat said
[1:26:19] we're all going to die aren't we the
[1:26:21] pastor replied yes that's a real
[1:26:23] possibility he then handed the
[1:26:25] microphone back to the back to the
[1:26:27] lawyer and he told him to call for help
[1:26:28] as he tried to he was trying to revive
[1:26:30] the pilot cuz him and the pilot were
[1:26:32] sitting in in the front seat together
[1:26:33] and the lawyer is in the back the lawyer
[1:26:36] started yelling help is there anyone out
[1:26:38] there and finally a frer replied is this
[1:26:41] an emergency don't you know how to get a
[1:26:43] hold of us there's like radio etiquette
[1:26:45] what are you hollering at me for so that
[1:26:47] they explained that that the pilot was
[1:26:49] unconscious so the freighter started
[1:26:51] giving them instructions and got them in
[1:26:52] contact with Anchorage with the towers
[1:26:55] so mind you they're in the storm they're
[1:26:57] in the dark they can't see nothing they

[1:27:03] instruction how to turn the plane around
[1:27:06] he said you're headed straight towards a
[1:27:08] mountain but he
[1:27:10] said he started repeating himself he
[1:27:13] said you got to listen to my voice he
[1:27:16] said don't don't panic listen to my
