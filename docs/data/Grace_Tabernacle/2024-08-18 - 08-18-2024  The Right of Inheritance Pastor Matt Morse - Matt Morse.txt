amen amen is that your prayer this morning amen just say it's good to be back in the house of the Lord we're going to read out of the uh the book of Jeremiah the 30 32nd chapter and the first verse amen and y'all praying y'all be praying for me I I've been uh feeling a little bit feeling a little bit uh sick myself so y'all just y'all just be praying for me I don't know that it's contagious unless you have a 20-year-old daughter that wants to get married then you uh you may pick up a little bit on it but you me we just just trust the Lord is in control amen you love the Lord amen just uh I I really like Xavier and he I got the privilege of witnessing him proposed to my daughter and they call that a they call that a privilege I guess I don't know but uh but I I certainly uh appreciate what the Lord has done in his life and and uh so just want to be able to be a support to them amen so um but we just want to read out of the book of Jeremiah the 32nd chapter we'll read from the first verse the Bible says in the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the 10th year of zedekiah the king of Judah which was the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar for then the king of babylon's army besieged Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judah's house now uh we know that there in this time that Israel and Judah they were two different nations so each one had their own King and so this came after Babylon had already taken over Jerusalem but now uh in taking over that here he was Jeremiah began to prophesy that he wasn't just going to stop there that they were coming into Judah and the and the King zedekiah that was the king over Judah would fall unto this unto the the king of Babylon and and and so he he would prophesy this and the Bible says that zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him up saying in other words had locked him into prison and asked Jeremiah why do you prophesy these things why do you say thus sayith the Lord I will give this city to the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take it and zedekiah the king of Judah shall not Escape out of the hands of the Chans but surely shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and shall speak with him by mouth to his mouth and and and his eyes shall be behold his eyes and he shall lead zedekiah to Babylon and there shall be there shall he be until I visit him sayeth the Lord though you fight with the Chans you shall not Prosper this is the question that zedekiah asked Jeremiah why are you saying these things Jeremiah returned he said that the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold Hanam the son of Shalom thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying by thee my field that is in anathoth for the ride of redemption is thine to buy so Hanam my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord and he said unto me by my field I pray that is in anoth which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine so buy it for thyself and then I knew that this was the word of the Lord so here the Lord had told him this is going to take place and when you see this take place then you'll know it's my word and and Jeremiah said and then it took place just as as God said it would so I know it was the word of the Lord so I just want to ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats this morning and uh just uh as a title would would uh like to speak on the right of inheritance um we were been speaking over the past few weeks on the man of iniquity being revealed and and and looking at this man of of iniquity and uh showing how that in the end time that he would lose his dominion over the Believers that he would be uh exposed uh to the church that he was powerless this great uh this great power that's been over the church and has put the church under so much dominion and uh remember last week we had gone into the what the devil's fourpoint scheme was if you remember uh that that the the in the first four seals that we saw this come to pass and each one revealing uh another part of Satan's plan and the first it was a spiritual kill then a political uh Power or when the church and the state United then the third which was when the souls were uh LED astray when he would when he would give out his Doctrine and uh and then in the fourth and the final uh would be an eternal separation from God and so uh we see that according to the scripture that this was Satan's plan all along if you ever if you're a Bible reader you'll find out the Bible says that all Souls belong to God and so Satan's plan all along has been to separate Souls from their creator this has been uh to so to come to a place of Eternal separation this has been a part of of Satan's plan but we realize that being that this was his plan but at the opening of the seals that Satan's plan was revealed to the church and though the world may not know it but it's it's a personal thing between you and God uh that that that it has that the Revelation has come in this hour and brother brm would say it like this he said by Revelation that the church is able to discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit I think God for that today that we have the ability the discernment to be able to to withstand the spirit of antichrist when he would come in and and try to lead people astray and cause you uh uh to turn from and to turn back but but by the discernment by Revelation that God has given us brother B said now Satan will be powerless before her how many say Amen to that amen means so be it says so they'll be powerless before her so he said you know just as it was in the days of Jesus you remember whenever Satan met Jesus up in the desert and he took the word of of God and he began to to misinterpret it and misuse it and misquote it in order to cause Jesus to bow down to him and and to come under his power but but but what Jesus done is he took a true a true interpretation of the word and he would say but it is also written and it is also written and so uh the very actions and the things that he said was was was to truly follow the word that was already written and the Bible says that because of that he withstood the devil and brother R said now the church today that by revelation that Satan will be just as thwarted to her as he was to Jesus when he stood in the desert so where he would try to overcome him he would try to overcome you but just as Jesus overcame him then the church would overcome him today that's why that Satan hates Revelation brother Cody hates the the spirit of God coming into the church he hates the he hates you growing in the word he hates you he hates you falling in love with the word and and you know to to be a word church and a people that come and and that are excited to hear the word of of God Satan hates it he he he don't mind if you come to church and lift your hands a little bit and Shout a little bit and run around and and to sing and clap your hands and all that but what Satan hates is he hates that you have a desire in your heart to gain revelation of God he hates it because he knows that Revelation is what will make him powerless before you and the Bible would tell us like this but when that Revelation comes that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you but you shall Prevail over it so where are we today brother Mark we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're feeding on the Mana from God the very thing that God has sent in this church we're taking communion as a prophet would say it like this we're taking communion out of the hands of the Creator he in other words he is feeding the church isn't it something to think that that we're not just feeding upon some theology or something that man has come up with you're not here just to feed off brother Matt but you're feeding out of the hands of the Creator the very the very one that created the heavens and the Earth the same Jesus that fed 5,000 with with two fish and five loaves of bread that same that same one whose hands were scarred with nails when he hung up on calvary's Cross he said we're feeding out of those same hands this morning I I don't know about you but I believe that this morning I believe that that he still feeds the 5,000 how many believes that I believe that God still feeds his church I I don't believe that we're feeding on something from an old day or some day gone by but I believe that God is feeding his church fresh manner this morning and I believe that if you'll get a people to together that'll get a hold of God and you'll get a a people that have a desire in their heart to hear from God and you'll get some ministers that are dedicated to to being able to surrender to God then God will come in the house of God this morning and he can still feed his children he can still help you he can he he's he's an ontime God he he's a god of today he's not just a god of yesterday he he ain't just a god of history but he's a god that is relevant to the situations and the things that we're facing today he's still feeding his children he still feeds the hungry he still feeds the longing Soul the Bible said blessed is he that hunger and thirst after righteousness for he shall be filled I believe God is still feeding us this morning you believe that he still feeds you say well how is he feeding us he's feeding the church on the bread of Revelation brother Mark the very thing that has been kept for 2,000 years that has been a mystery to the church and it was has been kept and it was hidden and it was locked away but today we realize that that's what the church is feeding on that's what we're uh we're built on and strengthened on and so we see that we're that what was kept it has now been revealed and now we're coming into this age of communion do you see where we are we're in this age of feeding and drawing strength and strengthening this body that it would be able to take a Rapture my isn't that something to give it enough strength to be able to step out of one dimension into another whenever you you know if you ever went into the Olympics or you want to do some great event you would have to you'd have to you'd have to exercise and they they they' feed them the right kind of a diet so that you could run the race that was set before you but I thank God that knowing the race that we would have to run that here this church would have to take a body change and she would have to do something that that that no body of people had ever done before but he said in order for her to be able to do it well then you'd have to have the right kind of strength and we'd have to have the right kind of exercise and I thank God that he's given us the right diet that this body that we could be able to feed upon the word of God brother Mark that by the feeding of the word of God that it would change this Mortal body and no longer would we be B by this old flesh and the and the pressures and the chains and the sicknesses of things that we fight every day but one day this body it'll step out of this robe of Flesh and walk right into eternity with God why because we're feeding upon the word of God see we're feeding on it it'll change your body it it it'll change every it'll change everything about us it'll change our dwelling place and now we see this in the church at where we are today and being able to feed upon the revealing of God's word but but in the book of Jeremiah you'll find that here is a natural typ of what what is taking place with the church today whenever we we read the opening scripture you see that what was happening in the book of Jeremiah is that here it was the time of the Babylonian war and brother Joe it was it was a it was a time of of of oncoming captivity and here here that that God was bringing this judgment upon them but in this time the Lord begins to speak to Jeremiah and he tells him what is going to take place and in and so he says to him he says you you know know there your your your brother or or kin folk is going to come to you and he's going to offer you this land and and I want you to take the money and purchase the land and and God begins to tell him what is going to what is going to happen and how how everything would fall into place and how the king would go into captivity but he says I want you to make the purchase and I love how it's written in the Bible because the Bible says it was an act of redemption the the purchase that he made was a was because he had the rights to Redemption so he had in other words he had a redeeming power there was a there was a seeming virtue about Jeremiah that he had the right and the and the funds and the capability of purchasing this property and then the Bible would tell him or the Lord would tell him to go on and then and to ride it and make a record of it and so he went and he made the purchase and he wrote and he took out 17 uh pieces of silver and he measured out the silver and he made the he paid for it he wrote it down on the Scrolls and and then he and then he went to to those that would be the the guard over the records and and he would ask them to take the records and and to and to ride it up and to seal it up and and and and as as he would go through this this uh this time that he he would end he would say it like this he would thus sayith the Lord he said take the evidences and the evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and the evidence which is open and put them in an earn vessel that they may continue for many days for thus saeth the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land I thought isn't this something that here think about what Jeremiah was doing here jeremi IAH knowing that this land was going to be taken knowing that that that he would he that it was going to be uh taken by another kingdom and they would come in and they were going to destroy the buildings and they would destroy the The Vineyards and they would destroy all the everything that was built by Israel here God had showed him the destruction that was going to take place but still yet the very thing the only thing that was that had any value you realize that silver in in Judah was the same thing as silver in Babylon silver was a precious commodity it was something that that that was of value to Jeremiah but brother Travis He took that silver and he bought something that he knew was going to be taken away isn't that something he he bought something that he knew that Babylon would come in and they would take it over and all of Israel would be taken into captivity and they they wouldn't even be able to have access to the land that he was purchasing but Jeremiah because he knew what God was going to do and God began to reveal to him what would happen he bought it and he sealed it up and knowing that one day that God would bring his children back back into that land I thought isn't it something what a thought of a prophet brother Mah that he would say that I want you to seal this up in an earth and vessel that it would last for many days cuz I'm here to tell you that one day that God's children will come back into this land again and when they come back into this land I want them to be able to go to that vessel and break it open I want the seal to be able to be taken off of it and them to be able to know what belongs to them in this land and that it wasn't just no it wasn't no argument it wasn't a debate but the price of it at had been paid it was redeemed there was a receipt of record that was put in the vessel so that whenever they returned to this land that they know that they could have it oh friends let me tell you what he knew he knew that one day that they'd go back into the land he knew that when they went by that the land would be fruitful he knew that it would be free of false gods he knew that all of the idolatry that had been built in it would be tore down he knew that the Groves of baale would be destroyed by Babylon he said but whenever the children of God can come back into this place that it would be a fruitful place when this Crow could be open and the promise of that redeeming fruit could come to pass to the Church of God I I I think that one day this is what Jeremiah was doing with his action brother marah he knew that one day that the proof of purchase would be opened he knew that one day that what had been bought would be revealed and that though there would be a people that would receive the inheritance of the Prophet Jeremiah what makes me want to preach on a prophet's inheritance this morning to think that that that he had a mind from the Lord war that told him you seal it up and one day I'll have a people come back to this land and when they open up that vessel they'll know what belongs to them at the time of the revealing then they'd be able to claim it listen what he said they would claim it they would they would harvest food in it they would be able to build houses on it they'll be able to be established on it do you realize what's happening today that the that the very thing that took place in Jeremiah's day in the natural is happening today in the church spiritually that whenever the seal was taken off the book brother Mark what did it do the very thing that a prophet of God saw from the mind of God he said it must be sealed up I'll seal it away until the time of the revealing but whenever it's revealed it'll be open to the church that she can walk into this land again it'll be a fruitful land she'll be able to build on it she'll be able to grow Harvest on it she'll bring forth fruit unto God oh let me tell you it ain't no Barren place it ain't a place it may have been a while that the enemy trumped around on it there was a that Satan had took it over and he and he had took the ways of God and the things of God and he had ruled over it but then there cometh forth a day that the book was open to the Church of the Living God and Satan's power was exposed and he had no power over him anymore it was held in an earn vessel a treasure that was kept you realize what it was it was the same just as it was in the days of Jeremiah brother Mark it was a book of redemption the scroll that we're that that was sealed in in the days of John it was a book of redemption but remember said we believed it to be Redemption he said but it was kept in an Earthly vessel in that same vessel that it was kept in today was one that was that was became flesh and then he died and he rose again and he went into Glory until that time of purchase and then now he said but now at the time of the revealing listen what's happening this is where we are at the time of the revealing it would be brought back to us in Revelation from the hand of God by vindication you see where the church is feeding on today it's by revelation of the word of God this is the importance of the seals being removed the mysteries of God being open to the church is that it would reveal to you what belonged to you as a church it would reveal to you the portion of the word that had you in it that that you wouldn't just read this Bible and say well I don't know if that has to do with me or maybe that's another age but whenever the seal was open you could walk right into the portion of scripture brother Mark that belong to the Bride of Jesus Christ and say this is my inheritance this is what God has called me to I believe I'm the bride of Christ I I believe that God has called us in this hour that we ain't just some another group that is just going to die and go by the wayside and be written in a history book but we're the bride of Christ and we're living in the end time and we're living in the last Church age and one day that final trumpet will be sounded and we'll go meet the Lord in the air it identifies who you are what portion of scripture belongs to you we ain't just wandering around in the Bible laws trying to figure out who we are and where we're going but I thank God that the seal being open has revealed to the church The Inheritance that God has given unto us praise the Lord how many say Amen to that I believe it it's been open how many can say it's been open to me see it's just a this is a personal experience between you and God he said it's going to be brought to us in Revelation from the hand of God by Vindication isn't that something other words but a mark it would take sister Sandy it's sure good to see you God bless you this morning amen how many proud to see sister Sandy make it back God bless you now you get a good saint of God pulling on you and all a sudden it get your attention amen amen but it was brought to us brother Mark in a by by by Vindication see this the Vindication is what gives you authority over the devil is't that something see it may not give you authority over other people they won't they may not believe anything you say but what what it will do is it'll give you authority over the devil it'll put the devil in his place it may it'll cause you to be able to stand and be able uh to to have the faith because of of the Vindication of God it would give you the faith to be able to stand against the devil and stand against all of his tricks you know I I think of the church today and how that we've gone through so much battling over the past 2,000 years that the church world as it came into this age that it found itself in this backslid condition but but you realize that just as it was in the days of Jeremiah is the same way it is today it was a people remember they were a natural type of us and so here this people had gone into this complete backslid condition but you notice what God done is even before this time came with Jeremiah it was still yet it was a prophet of God that came to let them know that this was coming to pass it was a warning do you realize that this is what God always does so he sends a warning unto them you you can read in the Book of Amos the Bible said the word of Amos came you how many knows what Amos was Amos was a Shepherd he he worked out amongst the herds matter of fact he made it plain to say that I'm no great prophet of God I'm just a Shepherd of the sheep I I I just work with the herds I I just work out there in the fields with him but the Lord came to him and gave him a word to speak to his children and when Amos came you realize Amos was a he was a great prophet of God a matter of fact as far as as far as I could find he was the he was the first prophet in the Old Testament that actually went into other countries and prophesied to other countries of the things that God had said many prophecies that that that Amos took to those other places and so but but he would talk about what God is going to do and how and how that God would come into Israel and would be able to and would destroy them because they had turned their back on God and and and Amos would say have he said the Lord will Roar from Zion this is this is probably 80 or 90 years before Jeremiah would begin to prophesy Amos is already saying the Lord is going to come to Zion he will he he will Roar from Zion and he will utter his voice from from Jerusalem and the and the habitation of the shepherd shall mourn and then Amos would say shall a trumpet be blown in the city and and the people not be afraid shall there be evil done in a city and the Lord hath not done it so he wants to make plain to the people that everything that is going to take place in this time of judgment is something that God is orchestrating so don't think that this is just something the Chans have worked up or the or the Babylonians have worked up or or that some power of their own but any power listen friends because I'm using this as a foundation but any power that is released upon the church is a power that God allowed to be released and so if God is going to allow it to come he has a perfect purpose for his coming brother Mark but but but he ain't going to just leave it there because notice what what what Amos says he says surely the Lord God would do nothing but he would first reveal his secret to his servants the prophets he said for the lon how many believe Amos to be a prophet of God Amos the prophet of God said God will do nothing unless he would reveal it first to his servants a prophet so if you want to establish your life on something establish it on there that if God is going to do something it don't matter what age it doesn't matter what time if God is going to do something he'll first reveal it unto his servants the prophets says see the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord ha spoken who can but prophesy watch Amos as he begin to prophesy you can imagine you know he was a hated Prophet if you ever studied the life of of Amos nobody liked Amos because Amos you know after all he wasn't raised in some great Seminary who was he to have a word from the Lord but but the things that he said took place and when he come out he be to tell them you know what Amos done he pointed out all the things that they were doing he said because you take people into captivity and you sell them as slaves God's going to destroy you because you because you hurt women and because you you abuse the the women in your in your congregation God's going to destroy you because because you you're Idol worshippers God's going to destroy you because you rob from the poor and you give to the rich and you and you try to build up off of the poor people God is going to destroy you he went to pointing out all the things that they were all doing you notice when and when he came brother Mark here these were supposed to been great men of God but they were in a backslidden state here and so when when Amos comes here he was a prophet of God and notice who he was talking to he was talking to a bunch of preachers and Priests and a government that was over Israel Over Judah and and and and they had all they had left the word of God and so what God does is because the preachers had left and the government had left and the priests had left then God has to send a prophet into that same place that he could correct them and turn them back to the word of God see that in their minds they would say well we were doing the word of God but they were still wrong the whole priesthood of men they were thousands of preachers and men and governments and kings and they were all professing worshippers of God but yet they were wrong they were looking to build up Kings for Prosperity but he realized what God would tell them it wasn't a king that they needed what they needed was a prophet of God friends that's what people need today they say well I'm looking to this for the answer and I'm looking to a priest for an answer and I'm looking to to uh this other for an answer but what we really need is we really need a prophet that has a word from the Lord that can come and tell you the mind of God I don't know about you but I'm I'm done listening to the minds of men I've heard all the opinions of men that I'm going to hear but if I'm going to have Direction this day I'm going to hear it from the word from a word from the Lord from a prophet of God that's been Vindicated by God this you think about when he would come that what they needed was a prophet because a prophet comes with the word of the Lord and he comes to interpret the word of the Lord you say well why would God send a prophet like Amos think about it every time they got in trouble God sent a prophet to correct it every time there was judgment coming God sent a prophet with a warning isn't that something that's that's the scripture God always sent somebody that had a word from the Lord to lead the church back to him out of the condition they were in and the confusion you can see the the in the prophet would be Vindicated you say why would it take a Vindication is because there's so many people that you could listen to there's so many voices there's so many ways we could go there's so many different things that you could believe but God would have to send something that would be Vindicated by God in order that would Captivate the minds of people and it would turn in our hearts and turn the people back to God but you notice you say why would God have to send a prophet let me tell you now this this is me but this is the way I feel about it I I believe that God is just how many believes that I believe he's a righteous God and the Bible says that God would judge remember what Jesus said he said I I I don't come to judge you but my word will judge you when I'm gone so it wouldn't be my old church it wouldn't be if it was a church that God would judge Bible which church would it be cuz every one of them's different can you imagine if God took the Catholic church and he judged everybody else by it or if he took the Baptist Church and he judged everybody else by it well we would all be wrong because none of us see anything the same way but Jesus didn't say that he said but my word will judge you so the true judge is not it's not going to be a church but the true judge would be the word of God now I believe that if it's God's word that would judge the church but Mark that that I believe that God is a just God so in other words if you take the word of God you can look at the word of God like this that this is God 's contract between me and God this is what God has written in his word and it's a contract between me and God so I know if I hold to it then God God is bound to be by his own word he he's Duty bound to keep his word he ain't going to change it on you and and change something at the last minute just to cause you to miss out but God made a contract with the church and see when a contract is made brother Mark when you would you you'd go to a court today and you'd say well there's a contract between one and another when a contract is made one of the first laws of a contract is that the contract must be able to be understood plainly isn't this something that it must be so if I would write a contract between me and brother Phil and then and then I didn't keep my end of the bargain and he would go to court and and and and he would say he' say well he didn't keep his end of the bargain so therefore he's got to pay thus and thus and I would look and I say but it but but it looks like that I didn't have to do that I mean the way the way it's worded I didn't know I had to do that and so what the judge would do is the judge would read that and if the person that wrote the contract had written in a way that it couldn't be plainly understood by the other party then the judge would automatically go in favor of the party that did not write the contract so the one that wrote it is bound by law in order for it to be able to be received and be received plainly that you could be able to live by it I thought my ain't that something about God here if God would make a contract with a believer that God he wouldn't leave it in a mystery see God could never the church he could never judge the church with a mystery being a on the word of God do you realize that shows us that that before that judgment could ever come to the Earth that God would have to take the mystery off the book he would have to open it up to the church that the revelation of the word would come to you that You' be able to meet God with that Revelation rather than wondering around and lost in this mystery or or confusion that people get lost up in see so it must be understood and so without God sending representatives of the word he would never judge by it so God would send the Holy Ghost to to speak it then he would would send a holy ghost to interpret it through the mouth of a Prophet this is what Amos came to do when Amos came you realize he was sin of God he had God's word he was anointed by God he came at God's appointed time and brother Mark he came with thus sayeth the Lord and when brother Amos came out and he was speaking thus sayeth the Lord the whole nation didn't want to accept what Amos said but it didn't matter what they accepted What mattered was is he had a word from God and the word from the Lord stands no matter who will receive it shall a lion roar who shall hear it you see so he came to speak the word of the Lord Brother Mark that's all he needed he didn't come in the name of church he didn't he didn't have to be backed by by some great uh uh denomination or something in order to be able to to speak to God's children he came in the name of the Lord and they wouldn't receive him just like today can you imagine if Amos got turned loose today glory to God it'd be in all the newspapers this mad man that come in why listen but because amos's message was not something that was well received can you imagine if he come down you know what he said he said the god that you claim to believe in is going to destroy you the god that you're building your temples to is going to come and he's going to destroy you and the temple that you built unto him the very thing the the millions of dollars and things that you spent God is going to destroy it but said that's the same thing that God has done can you imagine if he come today that the very God that Pentecost believes in he'll come and destroy he he he'll destroy them because of the immoral acts and the things that we allow in the pull pits today you think about these great churches and things that's been built up but the but the nonsense that they allow to to lead people and the in the things that they allow to be called the word of God but because of their immoral acts and and the direction that they've taken but am Mark that the very God that they claim to serve is going to destroy them and you know what they said well we don't have to believe you cuz after all we've got our own prophets we've got our own law we're we're we're we're we're from Abraham's lineage and who are you you ain't nothing but a shepherd He Didn't Have he didn't have the uh the the background in order to be able to stand before them kind of men and be able to to tell them they were dignitaries after all he was just an old Prophet an old Shepherd but he had a word from the Lord said but that's what that's what they did today they said the same thing but we don't have to receive that we don't have to receive it but friends let me tell you why you must receive it because it's a word from the Lord don't get caught up in who said it but it was a word word from the Lord so when God sends a word and he vindicates the word that he sends it's for us to receive said think about that God today the very God you're building churches to he'll destroy you because you're rejecting his word the very God that America Claims to serve will bring judgment upon the nation and destroy it said I hope this gets so deep you'll never wiggle out of it that the very one you claim to love and with your own man-made dogmas and IMM moral life and Decay that you got in you away from the word of God he will destroy you someday that's Theus sayth the Lord my isn't that a scary thought to think that you would spend your life dedicated to something and still receive the Judgment of God but let me tell you you won't receive it without hearing a word from the Lord first because the Bible said there's warning before judgment so here God would send a prophet you said we brother them out what in this kind of condition what can we do well let me tell you what God offered them an opportunity here was 80 years that took place from the time of Amos until the time of Jeremiah I thought of all the time that they had to correct their error of all the time to go in if the bab if if this enemy is going to come down and God's going to use him to tear down these these these these uh uh uh Groves of bail well why don't we just go in and tear down the Groves of bail and then God won't need the enemy to come in and do it they had all these years to correct the things can you imagine I I know we think about that well if God was sent a prophet after all it's been many years I'm sure that's the way they were in the days when Jeremiah begin speaking it was 80 years ago that Amos came and talked about what God was going to do 80 years later they had done forgotten about Amos but then Jeremiah began to speak and said but God is going to do what God said he would do this is the destruction and and what happened in the days of Amos it's little compared to what God is going to do now so he he he began to show what was happening you you notice what would what what God would begin to speak to to Amos I I love what he what he would tell him because it looks like an awful side an awful condition you said brother Matthew what can we do let me tell you what we can do we can line up with the word of God we can we can preach the gospel to the uh to to to everybody that we come in contact with we can we can we can send this message out Across the Nation and tell people the truth of the word of God and when people rebuke it let go ahead go ahead and tell the next for the truth of the word of God let me that that's what we can do we can stand and keep in line the word of God this is what God asked Amos he said Amos what do you see Bible said and Amos turned he said and what I saw was the Lord holding a plum line in his hand beside a great wall you know what a Plum line is it was a weight on the end of a string and that weight it would hold the string straight that's how old Builders would build build buildings so he said I saw the Lord holding a plum line and the wall beside it as God begin to speak of of of this wall and how that he would never be able to go into that group of people again but I thank God that there was somebody that saw it was the Lord that was holding the line and here Amos said if somebody or if there be somebody here this morning that would hold the line if there's somebody that would hold true to the line am said I see a plum line it was in the hand of the Lord oh friends let me tell you what we must do today we must line up with the word of God we must tell the truth we must preach the gospel we must cross the nation with the message of the hour let me tell you as long as we're lined up with the word of God there's still hope for those that are lost there's still hope that they can return back to God there's still a hope that they can be restored there's still a hope that they can escape the oncoming judgment just line up to the word of God and preach the gospel and send the message out of Across the Nation that's what this country needs it needs God called men that will stand upon the word of God that are anointed by God to preach the message of the hour there ain't some message for another age this is the message that God has sent in 2024 to call the Bride of Jesus Christ out of this world and to get her attention Upon Jesus Christ again it's God that has called his church he's sent a word by the way of the mouth of a prophet to call us back to him that we would recognize Who We Are and then we we could stand with faith and boldness and courage and press the battle in the midst of RA DEA that's what we need is Anointed men of God anointed anointed sisters that'll stand upon the word of God that'll hold a plum line in a standard in this world whenever she walks around and everybody calls you oldfashioned and some old worship granny or something like that but don't you worry about what they say look like hus look and say but I see a plum line in the hand of the Lord and let me stand true let when people look at my life let them see the plum line of God let them when they look at at my family let them see the plum line of God be the standard that the world is looking to in this age he saw a plum line see this is what we need to bring the church in line with the word of God brother Wesley but at the same time to edify the church to to strengthen the church to build it up you realize that the revelation is what strengthens the church so here God is going to send this to to in order to strengthen us and to to build our faith that's what we need today we need faith building messages not just to tear people down and make them feel weak and lesser and you can't live it anyway we don't need that the church don't need that it don't need men getting in the pull pit and just tearing everybody down and tell them why they're all they're all never going to make it and ain't none of them good enough we don't we don't need that it ain't just it ain't to tear you down we don't have to stand in the pull pit every time we get in the pull pit and correct everybody for all their wrongs and beat up on everybody can you imagine what it'd be like of all the things that I know things that's going on and people they they try to tell you and try can you imagine if you took the time to to to to stand and and feed the church if you took that time it's free I'm here but if you took the time to feed the church and instead you took that time and just beat up on everybody and told told everybody about everybody else's problems and all their wrongs and why they need need to correct it and all all this my but but there ain't no that ain't the place for it to constantly just just to correct and correct and correct listen to me don't shut me down but but but we don't have to have correction every time we breathe every word of God wasn't a word of Correction people get caught up in this do this don't do that do this don't do that do this don't do that and people walk around like little robots do this can't do that do this can't do that never had a relationship with God and then when they do this don't do that voice is going out of your head then you're stuck on your own and you're falling flat on your foot cuz there the problem is is because something was in your head and nothing ever got to your heart but what we need is the Gospel of Jesus Christ the very baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born in the heart of young men and women and they can stand out in the world and they wouldn't even have a Bible in their hand they'd be able to stand upon God's word cuz Jesus Christ would be living in them they could burn every book and you'll still stand on the truth of God's word they could put you in a in a Cell somewhere you stand on the truth of God's word why because it's living on the inside of you that's what we need we need to we need we we we need we need teaching and vision and direction for the church you real you realize if there's no teaching and there's no vision well you have no Direction imagine this is what God God God don't just send uh correction to point out our flaws but God always sends Direction that's right see so he'll he'll send correction but he'll also send direction is that what the prophet said he said the holy spirit always points to Christ you know what point means is to give a Direction so if you to point to Something in other words you're giving a direction says it always it always points so when God would bring correction that correction also comes with Direction so he's given a direction of the to the church you see so if you had no I'll just say it like this if you have no no correction well but then you would lose your direction so you have to have correction in the church don't get me wrong but if you had no correction you would lose your direction but also if you had no Direction you would get lost in your correction cuz that's all you would ever be able to see the Bible says where there is no vision people perish so the church must have a direction it must have a vision so correction comes but it's with the direction it's where it's with the feeding of God's word and God is leading us to a place he says see so God give us a Direction so where is our Direction it's what John pointed to he said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world no wonder the Holy Spirit point to Christ that that's what that's what John done he recognized him let me tell you friends any true Messenger of God today will still do the same thing he'll point to Jesus Christ you say where is our Direction it is Jesus Christ and Christ Alone what are we following after it's Jesus Christ and Christ Alone which is his word the Bible said he became flesh and dwelt Among Us that's why God would send a prophet it would be to turn people back to the word of God it wasn't to turn people to follow after Ambush it wasn't to cause them to follow after Jeremiah it was the cause them to follow after Jesus Christ and Christ Alone he never did come to point to a man he came to point to Christ you say why why wouldn't he point to I may as well just I may as well just preach I'm here anyway but why wouldn't he point to a man let me tell you why there's what John said remember when he saw the Throne of God Revelations 5 he said in the hand of him that set up on the throne was a book that was sealed with Seven Seals but whenever John saw it he said and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and he said and no man in heaven was found worthy and no man in earth and no man under the Earth see why you don't point to a man he said there was never a man that was found worthy no man under the Earth he said and I wept much because no man was found worthy to even look there own but then one of the elders said weep not Behold The Lion and the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loose the seals thereof he said and I beheld in the midst of the throne the four beasts in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and 10 eyes that or having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God that that he sent forth into all the Earth and he came and he took the lamb now the lamb took the book out of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb see why they're all pointing to the lamb lamb they all fell down before the lamb they were they were pointing to the lamb it was the lamb that was worthy and the Bible said and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy they are worthy to take the book and to open the seals you were slain and you have redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation it was you that paid the price for the book of redemption it was you that that that sealed it away it was it was you that had it in the hand of God that it was sealed until the time of its revealing and only you worthy to be able to open it to the church today that they would have power and dominion and Authority in the last days but I love how I'm I'm about out of time but I love how the Bible would talk about or John would see this now you notice I'm just going to lay this in here because this is where our study's been you notice that John said I saw four beasts around the throne now don't don't get them confused with the four beasts that we were talking about in Daniel 7 and and how that that remember those four beasts and they became one great Beast they were also the the the horse riders in the in Revelations the sixth chapter in the seals the first four seals each one LED with a horse rider and then also the the the king uh or Nebuchadnezzar's dream that Daniel saw it was the same those beasts were powers or nations that would rise up same thing Daniel saw or or interpreted is the same thing uh that that that that was in Revelations that we were talking about last Sunday so so but this wasn't the same four Beast he said these four beasts were actually the powers or the anointing of God you can read that in Revelations 4:7 the Bible said and the first Beast was like a lion the second a calf the third a face of a man the fourth was like a flying eagle so these four beasts were actually those that were Protectors of the gospel and so here that God had and I don't have time to get I was going to get a little more into it but I don't have time this morning but but here it was the same things that that that Moses would put on the Ark of the Covenant remember when he would take the ark out and here on each Corner that these would be established here this same thing was sitting Before the Throne of God these four beasts and so we see that this in uh at the opening of the seals what the opening of the seals it actually showed us not not not only did it show us where we were but it showed us the past the present and the future of the church so it's not so everything that happened wasn't something that has already taken place it was something that that that that the that the angel of the Lord would reveal showing that this is what is going to happen and so we see this some of it being future future tense but so we see what the Bible would tell us that that these four beasts that that were around the Throne of God they were they were the protectors now the last two Services we were talking about the four Beast that was that was in the vision the four Beast that uh that that came in on red horses these four powers they were represented as powers that came in on horse riders excuse me uh in the in the opening of the seal so but we see that that the Bible would tell us this here's a very powerful portion of scripture the Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood that the spirit of God would raise up a standard against it so here in the seals that we begin to watch how that through these ages that there would come there would come four different horse riders and they would bring a power over the people of God they would bring in a Dominion or an authority so we see this is an enemy that would come upon the Church of God but the Bible says but every time God would raise up a standard so so this is so powerful because you'll notice that the horse rider represented a power of the enemy but each time that God had had his own power to combat it can you can you pull up revelations in the the 6th chapter in the first verse I want I want you to just read the wording of this cuz I love how it's worded Revelations 6 And1 I didn't have in my notes but it says and I saw when the um okay one of the four beasts I saw in the when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see now notice I'm not going to read each one but each time that one of these horse riders came or this Beast of power that was that was anointed by Satan to come to destroy God's children that each time there was a beast that would rise up one of the four beasts now these were the beasts that were Before the Throne of God and notice what they were doing is they were calling attention to or exposing the devil cuz notice what they say one of the four Beast said come and see so each time here come a horse rider that was a beast of power that was the Antichrist remember the white horse rider he come he was Antichrist but then God would raise up this Beast would rise up and he'd say well come and see in other words he would show it was the it was the revealing of what was happening so in the in the opening of the seals but show it like this he said see the devil changed the four Beast meant the power that that they was revealed or the power that he revealed to the world but they and and he sent one after the next after the next he sent four powers and they ended up on a Pale Horse which brought death to the church remember it was total separation said but when the enemy went out as an antichrist then God would send a certain type of power out to meet him so the first one when the Antichrist went out he was riding it was a false teaching said so what God sent out was he sent out the line of the tribe of Judah Judah can you leave Revelations 47 up just for a few moments but he said see the first thing God sent out he sent out the lion of the tribe of Judah which was the word made manifest by the Holy Ghost and so see so here see so here Satan would come out it was an antichrist Spirit but then God would send out the line of the tribe of Judah he said it's a word made manifest by the Holy Spirit it was to manifest the true word cuzz the Antichrist was to bring a false word but then this the line of the TR the lion would come and the lion would Roar and it would bring a true word see that's why in the early church they that they were Anointed with the Holy Spirit in such a way they had great healings and miracles and visions and and power is because it was a Living Word it was the form of the line of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that Antichrist spirit so here Satan would send in this white Hors Rider into the church and now in in a spiritual sense he would send it in to to to destroy the church but God would raise up this great power of the line of the tribe of Judah and he would come in and they would have the power of the Holy Ghost to be able to to expose the devil and to put him back in his place so see so each time he done that the red horse it would take peace from the Earth but what God did is he raised up the ox it says a calf which was an ox which was a beast of burden or a beast of sacrifice and the prophet of God goes through all this showing how that this were those it was a the ox was a sacrifice showing that this was a time when men would give their life in order to stand you realize that this is whenever Roman Catholicism begin to grow into this great uh uh uh place and and the Dark Ages would come upon the church for all these years but here was a people that when they were outside of the church and wouldn't accept Catholicism then they would be destroyed they' take their life say so this was a time when the Catholicism control the world but but these men didn't mind dying if it was death they didn't care they went out and died because it was the spirit of the age that they lived in that that was the reason the men irus and polycarp and John and Paul those great men went out combating that thing willing to give their own lives for it because that was the anointing that they were under so it was it was what God sent so they give their lives freely because they come under the anointing of a sacrificial anointing which was the ox so they they come under they were willing to sacrifice their life you realize when polycarp went out and they were polycarp was a wellknown man and in a in a in a in an intelligent man but when they took him because he wouldn't accept Roman Catholicism ISM and they and they took him to to crucify him and told him quit this heresies and things that you're doing and if you'll just quit then we'll we'll accept you back but but the Lord spoke to him and and and and through the history of polycarp you'll hear it the Lord's or they write about how that God spoke to him and told him don't you worry about what they're going to do with you cuz I'm going to be with you the whole time and so he went out and he accepted what God Said and when they went out and they actually took a a bath house and they tore the bath house down just to get wood to pile it up on that man and burn him because it was because the Lions had already ateen the Lions weren't hungry so they burn him instead of feeding him to the Lions but he willingly but him Mark made a sacrifice you say why would they do it make a sacrifice like that said well how could they do anything else besides that because that was the power of God that was released upon them they were under the anointing or the age of the ox so because of that power of God that was released upon them they couldn't do nothing else but be a sacrifice they would they would willingly lay down their life for it because that was the anointing that was sent upon them in that age now you notice it just keeps going the and the third horse rider came up on a black horse and the that that it would Rob the people of their houses and lands you saw this coming through the ages where the Catholic Church would would make it where you could pay to go to heaven and you you as long as you paid enough money you can get anybody in it didn't matter what they did if you got enough houses to donate or something to to be able to pay the church but notice what God would send in that time he sent men remember it was the face of a man so what was it it was those those reformers that came in that time to say that ain't nothing but a lie of the devil see every time the enemy would raise up over the church God would raise up a standard against it so here these great reformers that come and say you don't have to pay a man the price has already been paid you don't have to pay Redemption redemption's already been paid it was paid for on the cross of Calvary said so these great reformers came up under that power that was released upon them in that age and they that they would set the word of God straight and they would they would keep the they would keep the gospel brother Mar but then it would come into this last power that with this great Antichrist spirit that would come in the last age remember it would deceive all and it would be on this pill horse and he would he he would he would he would destroy and take them into total total Annihilation it would be this time of judgment but the last Beast that came would be under the anointing of an eagle say so that's why when you hear this term that we're living in an eagle age that's what it's referring to is that here we're living under this fourth living Beast it was an eagle this was the last Beast that God sent to combat what Satan would do he said see he sent every time Satan would send forth one God would sent forth one then the Antichrist uh then the Antichrist would come and it would continue all the way through all the way until we come to the age that we're living in now but after the Pale Horse you'll notice that there was no horses after that there was no Beast after that see because it was destroyed and brother Mark see he said see when would that happen is it would happen at the end of the church Church ages and then there would be no horse rider anymore because he was bound there would be no power that was released anymore he was bound that's why in the fifth seal if you ever go when you go into the fifth seal you'll see what starts coming during the tribulation and and the time that Souls Under The Altar and all but but they said see because God God has every time that Satan has come God has raised up a power to combat the power of the enemy in every age all the way through to where we are it's no wonder glory to God I know I'm too late but it's no wonder that they started singing a new song it's no wonder that whenever he these four beasts that had fought and they stood to withstand the enemy when the enemy would come but John said but I saw up there that the lamb would come in the end time and he would take the book and he would loose the seals thereof in other words he would bind Satan and he would have no power over the church any any longer let me tell you what it was friends the opening of the seals it revealed every Power that Satan sent and it was destroyed by a power that God sent to the church that's why we as Eagle Believers in this hour brother Mark we're living under an eagle anointing we're living under an H where Satan has no power over the church we're not bound in the Dominion of Satan but we've been released by the power of God he said you've made us Kings and Priests and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne the beasts and the elders that were 10 thousands time 10 thousands and thousands of thousands they were saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing they went into a jubilee a Revival what caused it brother Mark because they recognized that the lamb had prevailed you see what brings such a a Revival in the church what is this bride's Revival about anyway it's because we recognize that the lamb has prevailed and every trick that Satan tried to do that could have captured your ancestors could have led them to another ancestor that got them wrapped up in all this this denominational junk that's going on in this world today got them all wrapped up in all these all these man-made religions but AR but but but something came in the last day this Eagle anointing has came and you've recognized what it was and it called you out of it that you can see the word of God and say I I thank God that the lamb has prevailed to open the book see people get this so mixed up he never was pointing to a man anyway it was the lamb the four Beast they bowed down to the lamb the 4 and20 Elders they bowed down to the lamb there was 10,000s times thousands times thousands that were glorifying him and giving Glory unto him let me tell you what it is it's Jesus Christ the Lamb of God has opened the book and released the power of God upon the church today that Satan has no power over you I feel the presence of the Lord right now let me tell you Satan has no dominion over the believer Jesus said if you I am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me will bring forth much fruit and without me you can do nothing nothing but if you abide in me and my word abides in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you for herein is the father glorified that you bring forth much fruit God don't want you to be beat down he don't want you to be washed over and stomped down he wants you to be fruitful he don't want you to be Barren he wants you to be an overcomer he don't want you to be bound he wants you to be free I wonder how many to say that today I want my life to glorify God Lord let my life manifest him let my let my life glorify him let my actions glorify God let my mouth glorify him let me be as Paul said he said with one mind and one mouth let us glorify God who was it that John saw 10 thousands times 10 thousands and thousands and thousands that were glorifying him let me tell you who he saw he saw Matt MOS down there they said well he can't preach without dancing he can't sing without dancing why there something happened in my heart my eye come open to who I am and when I saw my name that was written it called me to rejoice and to glorify God let everything that has with one mind and one mouth glorify God won't you stand to your feet this morning won't we glorify him give praise and glory unto him how many knows what glorify means it means to render or to esteem something as glorious it don't mean make a loud noise it means to esteem something as glorious see sometimes when you esteem something as is glorious your life will glorify him sometimes your voice will glorify him Paul said let every voice you'll glorify him because you esteem him as glorious when this word used properly it means to ascribe weight by recognizing the real substance or the value of something so you say I want to glorify God it's to recognize the value of God it's how you can glorify him say he's there's nothing more PR precious it's valuable it takes preeminence over all my feelings and over all my work and job and all this brother Ben it takes preeminence because you recognize the value of it that's what causes us to be stable that's why you come to church you're not sitting there wondering well I may I'm I don't know if I'm going to go church tomorrow matter of fact I'm going to go off somewhere else I'm just going I'm just we're not doing that because we're stable because we esteem him valuable the value that that that God is to us to give Glory means to personally acknowledge God in his true character or his Essence to acknowledge Him let me tell you Paul said with one mind and one mouth glorify him I'm going to tell you something this morning I know I've been long but you realize that glorifying God is not to make God greater it's not to we glorify God so that God can feel good about himself it ain't to make him greater you can give God all the glory you can all the praise it doesn't make God a greater God it's not to make him more excellent It's not to give him more power but when you glorify God see it's not for God's benefit brother Mark it's for yours see people get that so mixed up well God wants us to worship him God wants but but we don't glorify God for God's benefit we glorify God for our benefit see cuz when you esteem him as valuable you esteem him as greater you you you allow the the spirit of God or the the anointing that God has sent in this age to rule over your life but I'm Mark and then it doesn't matter what Satan would do in this he'd come up this great power that's in this age you realize friends you're facing a great power so kind of you're facing a great power a great enemy that would come to destroy you here destroy your family he he'd wreck everything about you destroy your your confidence in in even going to church destroy your confidence in the ministers in one another this is what Satan comes to do but because you value God because you glorify God and you esteem him to be greater you're living under the anointing that God has sent in this age which is an eagle anointing and because you're willing to say Lord I I pray that you would allow that anointing to to have control over my life let let it rule my life don't let me don't let me get out from under that anointing but Lord let me let it rule over me let that that way I can rise up in the AIDS that I'm living in over the power of the enemy knowing that it would not bring nothing but death and see because you're living under that benefit brother Mark it'll grow you it'll help you it'll cause you to give life it'll cause you to praise God it cause you to come to church and lift your hands why because you value God let me tell you something when there's a life in there it has to let out you can take a seed you pour a concrete slab over it anybody knows what happens you get some grass you pour concrete over the grass say well it'll be fine you leave a little crack in that concrete and watch what'll happen the little sun comes down it warms up the concrete and that little seed down in there underneath that concrete it starts feeling the warmth of that sun and it goes to searching for a little breath of oxygen somewhere and that crazy root will go all the way across the concrete slab and find the only crack in the slab and it'll grow out of it he said well who planted that in there nobody planted there it was under the slab and that's what Satan's done today is he's coming he poured concrete on the people of God concrete on you to suppress you and concrete on you that you can't grow and concrete on you that you can't that you can't lift your hands and you you can't be free in the spirit of God and you can't recognize who you are he just wants you buried up in Old dark cold place under a bunch of concrete I don't know what the concrete is to you but I know that's what Satan's done he would pour it on you but brother said when there's a little bit of life that life when the sun comes upon the life then the life is going to it's going to shine forth so it doesn't matter how you can take a city block but Mark a concrete and eventually it's going to come forth you know why because you can't hide life you can't bury it there's life there when you're born again you can't hide it so there's something in you that's going to cry out because there's life you can't be quiet cuz there's life you can't keep your hands down cuz they're life that old Spirit of Oppression will come into the church say well I'll tell you what we're just we're just not going to let the spirit of God loose in here this morning we're we're just going to hold everybody back but he can't do it because there's life and all it takes is one little Britney back there at the end of a song service for the Lord to begin to speak their heart and say Lord that ain't nothing but the truth and I love you I thank you for coming this morning I thank you for your anointing and then another person will catch on and before long that anointing is all over the building why because there's life and God is calling the life life out of the cold and the the darkness that brother Mark we would be able to stand and glorify him we give Glory let me tell you what David said he said give unto the Lord the glory and strength give unto the Lord the glory that is due his name give him the give him the glory give him the strength give God brother Mark give God what you have and let God do something with it you may not have a lot but but if you'll give what little you have to the Lord and let God do something with it it'll accomplish great things you remember the woman that gave two pennies in the offering that that time that Jesus saw it and they and Jesus said you know that woman gave more than any of these men the disciples looked at him and said what do you mean Lord she she gave two pennies she's a poor woman he said she gave everything she had he said see they gave they gave out of their wealth she gave out of her poverty they gave when they had plenty to give but she gave when she had nothing to give do you realize what that that when we when we give something to God that brother Mark that God can do more with it than we can ever do with it you say well I don't have much to give well neither did David he went down to a battle had a slingshot but God used it neither did Moses he went down to God called him to deliver Egypt he said I don't have nothing I can't even speak I I don't know what I would do he said what do you have in your hand Moses I got a staff throw it on the ground God used it he took a widow woman that didn't have nothing and sustained the life of a prophet their whole family they had a meal Barrel that had no food in it take what little you have and give it to God and let God do something great with it you may not feel worthy but let me tell you God don't God God don't God don't take those that are qualified and call them to use them God takes those that he's called and he qualifies them to be used that's what God does you may not you may not have much to offer you be say Lord I want to give it to you this morning how many lift your hands say Lord I come to glorify thy name even when you're poor in spirit you have something you can give to God when you're so beat up in your spirit but there's still a little bit left in there you say Lord I lift my hand I I may be like that little widow woman I'm poor in spirit but I got a couple of pennies that I can give to you this morning and I want to glorify you and tell you that I love you friends let me tell you a secret this morning you're not limited by what you have you may be poor this morning you may be poor in your spirit but you're not limited by what you have you're limited by what you you do with what you have so if you'll take what you have and you'll give it to God you let God come down let a Revival come back to your heart let the spirit of God be rekindled in your heart let the love of God Shack your heart again that you can look at one another and you can love one another with an open heart let the mind of God be spoken through your lips when you give what you have to God let God make something out of your life let's bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord you see our hands Lord lifted to you Lord knowing god that we don't have much to offer but God we recognize Lord the the things that you've done in this age Lord and God we recognize who we are as a body of Believers and God how you've called us in this age Lord you've called us Lord to be able to stand in in the time of Eternal separation when many would turn their back from you Lord when judgment would come to this world but God I thank you for for the for the word of Mercy Mercy Lord I Thank You Lord that you would you would send an eagle anointing in this hour God that would call this church how out out of the the old mud pit and God that you would allow us to be lifted up in this age God that we could rise above the the enemy and the things that Satan would do to hold us down and Lord I ask you Lord this morning God that you would send that anointing amongst your children God those that are down lord those that their their Spirit has been that's been torn down and Lord the many things that Satan has piled up upon them God I pray that that great Eagle anointing God would lift them up God I pray you would take what they had to offer Lord the little that they lay down God I pray you would do something great with them Lord let a Revival strike their heart God let them be able to stand and testify and be strong in faith Lord let it let it be a a spirit of encouragement that would come upon your children Lord that we could stand and glorify thy name the mighty works that you've done Lord God we thank you and we give you glory for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church says amen you are great you do Miracles
