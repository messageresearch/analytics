[45:30] chap or the second chapter excuse me
[45:33] we're going to read from first Peter in
[45:36] the second chapter and we'll start in
[45:38] the second
[45:39] verse my isn't it good to be in the
[45:42] house of the Lord amen somebody say it's
[45:45] good to be in the house of the Lord amen
[45:47] I'd rather be here than be in jail amen
[45:50] I'd rather be here than being in the
[45:52] hospital amen I can't think of no place
[45:54] I'd rather be this morning but to be in
[45:56] the house of the Lord I say it's good to
[45:58] be in the house of the Lord amen isn't
[46:00] God's word wonderful we just want to
[46:02] take a few moments to to read uh a
[46:05] little portion of scripture and
[46:06] something that the Lord had put on my
[46:07] heart to speak this morning trust it'll
[46:09] be a blessing to you uh first Peter in
[46:11] the second chapter and we'll start in
[46:14] the second verse Peter says as newborn
[46:17] babes desire the sincere milk of the
[46:21] word that you may grow thereby if so be
[46:25] that you have tasted that the Lord is
[46:27] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[46:30] Stone disallowed indeed of men but
[46:33] chosen of God and precious you also as
[46:36] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[46:39] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[46:41] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[46:44] by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is
[46:47] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[46:49] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[46:52] precious and he that believeth on him
[46:55] shall not be confounded unto you
[46:57] therefore which believe he is precious
[47:00] but unto them which be disobedient the
[47:03] stone which the Builder is disallowed
[47:05] the same is made the head of the corner
[47:06] so he shows how that he's a different
[47:08] thing to two different people he's and a
[47:12] stone of stumbling and a rock of offense
[47:14] to them which stumble at the word being
[47:16] disobedient where unto they were also
[47:20] appointed but you are a chosen
[47:23] generation amen somebody say Amen
[47:26] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[47:29] peculiar people that you should show
[47:31] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[47:34] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[47:37] Light which in times past you were not a
[47:39] people but are now the people of God
[47:43] which had not obtained Mercy but now you
[47:45] have obtained Mercy amen we'll just ask
[47:48] the Lord to add His blessings to the
[47:49] reading of the word as you be seated
[47:51] this morning and I'd like to speak on
[47:53] this subject of a Stone of Mercy a stone
[47:58] of Mercy hear this scripture as Peter
[48:00] would uh begin to speak on this uh on
[48:04] this the stone and the the foundation
[48:06] and the and how that you were built up
[48:08] as a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[48:10] to offer spiritual sacrifices to God
[48:12] you'll see in this scripture that this
[48:14] is but Mark it's a powerful scripture
[48:17] but it shows the contrast between two
[48:19] different classes of people and so uh
[48:21] Peter shows that one is the children of
[48:23] Disobedience the other one were the
[48:25] children of God so here in this little
[48:26] portion he shows such a contrast of how
[48:30] that they react to to Christ or how that
[48:32] they see Christ and uh in this scripture
[48:34] there's an underlying reference that
[48:36] Peter makes to the temple Restoration in
[48:38] the Babylonian uh Empire or the Exile of
[48:41] the church how many remembers how in the
[48:43] Old Testament of how that that Israel
[48:45] had been uh captured by Babylon they
[48:47] went through a 70-year period of
[48:49] Babylonian captivity and they were and
[48:51] they were uh uh after this such a time
[48:54] that God had sent uh amongst the
[48:56] children of Israel a people that would
[48:57] restore Israel back to their rightful
[49:00] condition and so uh you can actually
[49:01] read about this in the book of Ezra and
[49:03] and Nehemiah uh and they they tell the
[49:06] story of Ezra Nehemiah and zerubabel and
[49:08] how that one had went in and they and
[49:10] they they rebuilt the walls of the city
[49:12] and then the other had they had built
[49:14] the pull pit and they they brought the
[49:16] word and opened the word and restored
[49:17] the word to the hearts of the people and
[49:19] then as zerubabel came into the temple
[49:21] and he laid the foundation of the temple
[49:23] and and uh and so he re build it and and
[49:26] the Bible would tell us that the same
[49:27] one that laid the foundation of the
[49:29] temple is the same one that would bring
[49:31] the headstone of the Temple and so uh we
[49:33] see that the Bible says it was by his
[49:35] hands the rubble by his hands the one
[49:37] that laid the foundation would also
[49:38] bring the headstone so we realize being
[49:41] Believers this morning that that was a
[49:43] type of Christ and showing how that that
[49:45] Christ would come and in his Earthly
[49:47] Ministry he would lay a foundation that
[49:49] Paul would Apostle Paul would speak of
[49:51] him he would say no other Foundation has
[49:54] any man laid than that which has already
[49:56] been laid which was Christ Jesus that
[49:58] that is the foundation that we build on
[49:59] this morning that's what we are that's
[50:01] what we establish the church on and our
[50:03] in our lives and our and our work is to
[50:05] be built upon the foundation that has
[50:07] already been laid but but we realize
[50:09] that the Bible said but the same one
[50:10] that that is the foundation would also
[50:12] be The Headstone so it look so you see
[50:15] Jesus as he would come in his Earthly
[50:16] Ministry and and that Foundation was
[50:18] laid and then you would see this time of
[50:21] judgment that would come and here Jesus
[50:22] would even speak of it he said my word
[50:24] will judge you when I gone and so you
[50:26] see that in this time of judgment when
[50:28] this great judgment would strike the
[50:30] Earth that The Headstone would come to
[50:32] the that would be that would be uh come
[50:34] to the Temple and so here we realize
[50:36] that that headstone or the Capstone as
[50:37] you would call it the Bible says when
[50:39] The Headstone comes it would bring forth
[50:41] a message crying Grace Grace unto it so
[50:45] I think it's wonderful to think that in
[50:47] the in the midst of judgment that God
[50:49] would send Grace and in the midst of
[50:50] judgment you realize that God has never
[50:52] brought judgment Upon A people without
[50:54] offering Mercy first God has never God
[50:56] isn't just a just a mean God that would
[50:59] go around just destroy people and but
[51:01] isn't even the desire of God for people
[51:03] to be lost hello somebody it isn't God's
[51:05] desire for any man to be lost it isn't
[51:07] God's desire for any man to to go to
[51:09] hell the Bible says that hell was
[51:11] created for Satan and his angels it
[51:13] wasn't even created for people but and
[51:15] and and if a man would go to hell it's
[51:17] because he fought every day of his life
[51:18] to get there because in the time of
[51:20] judgment God brings Mercy in the time of
[51:22] judgment God brings Grace we realize
[51:24] this is the headstone that Peter is
[51:27] actually speaking of now you'll find in
[51:28] this scripture as Peter is speaking he
[51:31] actually quotes this out of the book of
[51:33] Isaiah the 28th chapter he says
[51:35] therefore thus saith the Lord God behold
[51:38] I lay in Zion a foundation or for a
[51:40] foundation a stone a tried Stone a
[51:43] precious Cornerstone a sure foundation
[51:45] and he that believeth shall not make
[51:47] haste in the Amplified Bible it says it
[51:49] like this it says he who believes in God
[51:51] or he who trusts in him and relies on
[51:54] him and adheres to to that stone brother
[51:56] Mark he will not be ashamed he will not
[51:58] give away he will not hasten away in
[52:01] other word in other word he wouldn't
[52:03] haste he wouldn't leave in a sudden
[52:04] panic I think that's so wonderful to
[52:06] think that this Foundation that we're
[52:08] building on brother Mah would be a
[52:10] foundation that whenever things that get
[52:11] shaky that we don't make haste whenever
[52:14] whenever there's a storm or something
[52:15] rising up that we don't run off we ain't
[52:17] we're not we're not fleeing we're not
[52:19] we're not in sudden Panic every time
[52:20] something hello somebody every time
[52:22] something Rises or there's a little
[52:23] problem in the church or or something
[52:25] going on in the world we don't we don't
[52:26] run back and run away from God because
[52:28] the Bible says they wouldn't make haste
[52:30] we're not we're not panicking but you
[52:32] you realize that many people when they
[52:33] read this scripture they'll actually
[52:35] attribute this scripture that Peter's
[52:37] writing to the children of Israel or or
[52:39] to the nation of Israel but Jesus
[52:41] actually makes this plain in Matthew the
[52:43] 21st chapter Jesus said he said I say
[52:45] unto them did you never read in the
[52:48] scriptures the same the uh the the stone
[52:50] which the build is rejected the same has
[52:52] become the head of the corner this is
[52:54] the Lord's doing and marvelous in our
[52:55] eyes therefore I say unto you the
[52:58] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[53:01] and given to a nation that will bring
[53:03] forth the fruits thereof here even Jesus
[53:06] himself brother Mark he would say that
[53:08] the kingdom of God it would be taken
[53:09] from this people that wouldn't bearing
[53:11] the fruits of God hello boy makes me
[53:14] feel good this morning but God would
[53:15] give that very Kingdom to a people that
[53:18] would bring forth the fruits of almighty
[53:20] God here God would establish a nation he
[53:22] would establish a people that were
[53:24] established for the very person or or
[53:26] the purpose of bringing forth the fruits
[53:28] of God but because they wouldn't bring
[53:30] forth the fruits of God he said but now
[53:32] it'll be given to a people that will
[53:34] bring forth the fruits of God he said
[53:36] and whosoever shall fall on this Stone
[53:38] shall be broken it's a it's a hard Stone
[53:41] it ain't a stone that that that can be
[53:42] destroyed by man he said and whomsoever
[53:45] that stone shall fall upon it will grind
[53:47] him to powder so here Jesus establishes
[53:50] this stone is the strength it is the
[53:51] very strength of almighty God it is the
[53:54] very it is the very thing that it's the
[53:56] foundation it's the rock that we build
[53:58] on it's the it's what we rely on it's
[54:00] the it's where we get our our source of
[54:03] of strength it's where we get our source
[54:04] of of food it's where we it's where we
[54:06] draw our nourishment from B the market
[54:09] it's it's the it's the foundation of our
[54:10] life even Apostle Paul when he would
[54:12] speak on it in Ephesians the 2 chapter
[54:15] he says now therefore you are no more
[54:17] strangers and foreigners listen he's
[54:19] talking to the gentile people he said
[54:21] you are no more how many are gentile
[54:23] people if you're not Jews you're Gentile
[54:25] so we are no more strangers and
[54:27] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[54:30] Saints and of the household of God for
[54:33] you are built upon the foundation of the
[54:35] Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ
[54:38] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[54:40] whom all the building fitly framed
[54:43] together groweth unto the Holy Temple of
[54:46] the Lord in whom also you are builded
[54:50] together for a habitation of God through
[54:52] the spirit of God so here Paul takes
[54:55] that same scripture brother Mark that
[54:57] same word of Isaiah and Paul says but
[55:00] you were built upon it you're going to
[55:01] you're established on it but but what
[55:03] Paul does is he shows you the purpose of
[55:06] the building he said this building is
[55:08] for a habitation of the spirit of God
[55:11] this is why God made you it was a it was
[55:13] a building that was fitly framed
[55:15] together it was formed for a purpose and
[55:17] the purpose of that is that it would be
[55:19] a place where the spirit of God would be
[55:21] able to inhabit it's no wonder that
[55:23] Peter would say it like this he said you
[55:25] are a chosen people you're a royal
[55:28] priesthood you're a chosen generation
[55:30] you're a people a building that is fitly
[55:32] framed and it's built for a purpose God
[55:34] don't build anything for no reason he
[55:36] don't he don't go around just building
[55:38] things to see what it'll turn out like
[55:39] but everything God ever built had a
[55:41] purpose it was God that made the world
[55:43] and all that God made had a purpose
[55:45] every Star has a purpose the moon has a
[55:48] purpose the Earth has a purpose the the
[55:50] the ocean has a purpose the water the
[55:52] rain everything that God has ever made
[55:55] has a has a purpose the Bible said the
[55:57] rain comes down and it hits the field
[55:59] and the grass grow and it feeds the
[56:01] cattle and the cattle and we feed upon
[56:03] the cattle it's the very purpose of
[56:05] almighty God let me tell you friends if
[56:07] God built something for a purpose then
[56:09] what about you this morning to think
[56:11] that God the creator of Heaven and Earth
[56:13] brother marah he built us for a purpose
[56:15] and the Bible says that purpose was for
[56:17] the habitation of the spirit of God I I
[56:20] thank God that even though we may have
[56:22] they may have looked at us said well
[56:23] you're not Israel and and and you you
[56:25] didn't you didn't come for much hello
[56:26] somebody that's I feel like that this
[56:29] morning you didn't come for much but
[56:30] that's okay but but I was a person that
[56:33] obtained the mercy of
[56:35] God he reads the scripture this is what
[56:38] Peter quotes Hosea the 2 chapter in the
[56:41] last verse of that he says and I will
[56:42] swow her unto unto me in the earth and I
[56:45] will have mercy upon her that had not
[56:48] obtained mercy and I will say to them
[56:51] which were not my people Thou Art my
[56:53] people this is what Peter's quot quoting
[56:55] glory to God and they shall say thou art
[56:59] my God who are they brother Wesley
[57:02] they're the people that have obtained
[57:03] Mercy I wonder if there's any of them
[57:05] here this morning the Bible says I will
[57:08] say unto them Thou Art my people and
[57:10] they shall say unto me thou art my God I
[57:13] wonder if there's somebody here this
[57:14] morning that would say that thou art my
[57:17] god brother the W see that it's the
[57:18] people of God and we ought to be able to
[57:20] say it it don't matter what comes
[57:22] brother Mark we a we ain't making haste
[57:24] so whenever things are going good I say
[57:26] thou art my god when things are going
[57:28] bad I say thou art my god when every
[57:32] when I'm when I'm well I say thou art my
[57:34] God when I'm sick in my body I say thou
[57:37] art my god when it seems like everything
[57:39] is just going on to to plan I say thou
[57:42] art my God but when everything falls
[57:44] apart I can still say thou art my god
[57:47] when the storm comes we don't make haste
[57:49] we say thou art my God why because we're
[57:52] the people that have obtained the mercy
[57:54] of God and the Bible says those that
[57:56] have obtained Mercy I say unto them you
[57:59] are my people and they reply Thou Art my
[58:02] God the Bible said thousands may fall at
[58:04] my right hand 10,000 at my right hand
[58:07] but it shall not come nigh me brother
[58:09] West yet don't matter how much trouble
[58:11] comes to this world I say Let It Come it
[58:13] don't matter how much my spirits of
[58:14] Deceit and unbelief comes to people I
[58:17] say let it come but ask for me in my
[58:19] house I say thou art my God I don't
[58:23] worry I don't fear I don't threat for
[58:25] thou art my God I know who my God is
[58:28] everybody knows what's going on in the
[58:29] world everybody knows all the troubles
[58:30] in the world everybody knows all the
[58:32] failures that they have but I know who
[58:34] my God is he's bigger than my trouble
[58:36] he's bigger than my mistakes hello
[58:38] somebody he's bigger than my my my my
[58:40] failures and my fa he's bigger than that
[58:43] thou art my God Bible says there'll be a
[58:46] bride in the end time without I feel
[58:48] like preaching this morning there'll be
[58:49] a bride in the end time without spot or
[58:51] wrinkle who is those people it's a
[58:53] people that know their God
[58:55] it has to be somebody to manifest it
[58:57] sister Tammy there has to be somebody
[58:58] that would come that would believe the
[59:00] word of God that would manifest the very
[59:02] the very stature of the perfect man that
[59:04] would put on ver uh uh uh virtue and
[59:07] brotherly kindness and love and patience
[59:09] and they would have the very knowledge
[59:10] of God their faith would be an
[59:12] unwavering Faith they would they would
[59:14] love unconditionally as God loved
[59:15] because they are the people of God that
[59:18] inhabit the spirit of God and manifest
[59:21] the fruits of God I there something
[59:23] that's the very message that we Preach
[59:25] Today brother brother Wesley that's our
[59:27] message it's the same message Paul said
[59:29] that came from the beginning it's love
[59:31] here that God has given us this same
[59:32] gospel brother Mark that we've been
[59:34] preaching for 2,000 years the message
[59:36] hasn't changed one bit it's always been
[59:37] the same message it's Jesus Christ and
[59:40] Paul said the hope of glory is that
[59:42] Christ Living in you and we're still
[59:44] preaching it today isn't it wonderful to
[59:46] be a part of the people of God that are
[59:48] preaching the message of Jesus Christ
[59:50] Christ in you the hope of glory it's a
[59:53] message brother Wesley this message Mage
[59:54] is a message of restoration it's a
[59:56] message of of a restored church it's a
[1:00:00] how many see that in the message it's a
[1:00:01] it's a message to restore that's what
[1:00:03] the Bible would even prophesy melachi
[1:00:05] said that that that that the spirit of
[1:00:07] Elijah would come again to restore or to
[1:00:09] turn Hearts what is a turning of a heart
[1:00:11] is to restore back to something else as
[1:00:13] the Book of Revelations would say that
[1:00:15] you've left your first love but here God
[1:00:17] he wouldn't leave them in that condition
[1:00:19] but he would come to the Ephesian Church
[1:00:21] he'd say but turn back to God it's a
[1:00:23] it's a message of restoration God is
[1:00:25] calling us to restore oursel back to God
[1:00:28] it's a restored Church a restored people
[1:00:30] a restored word a a a restored Worship
[1:00:33] in the church don't don't you see
[1:00:35] there's so many different ways to go to
[1:00:36] church there's so many different ways
[1:00:38] that that people have church but here
[1:00:39] God would bring his word to restore a
[1:00:42] people back to the way that God had
[1:00:44] ordained it in the beginning somebody
[1:00:46] say Amen this is the purpose of God that
[1:00:48] we would come to church the way God
[1:00:50] wanted us to go to church that we would
[1:00:51] live the way God wanted us to live that
[1:00:53] we would be the people people of God we
[1:00:55] would we would inhabit the very spirit
[1:00:57] of God and we would worship God the way
[1:01:00] God wants us to worship the Bible says
[1:01:02] the that we're true worshippers you me
[1:01:04] tell you something about true I may as
[1:01:05] well just preach it I'm here let me tell
[1:01:07] you something about true worshippers the
[1:01:08] Bible say they'll stand for truth I know
[1:01:10] the devil he'll do anything he can to
[1:01:12] keep you the church from being a true
[1:01:14] worshipper keep the worship out of the
[1:01:16] church let me tell you something about
[1:01:18] God's worshippers all the way through
[1:01:19] the scripture you'll find something that
[1:01:21] Satan has always tried to force them to
[1:01:24] Worship in a different way but the True
[1:01:26] Believer never fell for it you look at
[1:01:28] the men in Babylon that day when they
[1:01:30] came down to the three Hebrew children
[1:01:32] and they said bow down to this image and
[1:01:34] you'll be saved but they wouldn't bow
[1:01:36] down to an image brother Wesley they
[1:01:38] said no but the word of the Lord said we
[1:01:40] ain't going to bow to no image the only
[1:01:42] thing I'll bow to is my God the Creator
[1:01:45] it's Jehovah I'll not give in anything
[1:01:47] else and they said if you won't bow
[1:01:49] we'll throw you in a furnace they said
[1:01:51] well you may as well just throw us when
[1:01:52] we know our God he is more more than
[1:01:54] able to Deliver Us from that fiery
[1:01:56] furnace and they they had never seen
[1:01:58] anybody delivered from a fiery furnace
[1:02:00] but they had enough faith in God that
[1:02:02] God was able to deliver them and brother
[1:02:04] Mark they said you can take us down
[1:02:05] there you can put us in a furnace and
[1:02:07] even if our God don't deliver us we
[1:02:10] still ain't going to bow to
[1:02:12] yours why because they're Believers and
[1:02:15] you can't take worship out of the heart
[1:02:17] of a True Believer they tried to do it
[1:02:19] with Daniel you quit praying to God that
[1:02:21] way why you got to if you're going to
[1:02:22] pray they said he's still down there in
[1:02:24] his room and we heard him and his
[1:02:25] windows were open Daniel wasn't hiding
[1:02:27] what he believed he didn't have to hide
[1:02:29] around to say I'm a Believer in the
[1:02:31] middle of lead DEA he didn't have to
[1:02:32] sneak around with his friends and
[1:02:34] pretend to be a Christian he said I'm a
[1:02:36] Believer and I'm proud to be a believer
[1:02:39] they took him and threw him in a lions
[1:02:40] did and the angel of the Lord came down
[1:02:42] where he was and he stayed the mouth of
[1:02:44] the lion oh I think is't that something
[1:02:46] he nestled left with him all night long
[1:02:48] brother Westy because the angel of the
[1:02:49] Lord was there why you can't take
[1:02:51] worship out of a true worshipper when
[1:02:53] the word of the the Lord descends upon
[1:02:55] the people of God it brings a spiritual
[1:02:57] worship that's what happened to the
[1:02:59] woman at the well the Bible says when
[1:03:01] Jesus came to her he said true
[1:03:03] worshippers shall Worship in spirit and
[1:03:05] in truth you know what that tells me
[1:03:08] that when the revelation of God's word
[1:03:09] Stacks a person's heart it brings
[1:03:11] spiritual
[1:03:13] worship when the when the word comes
[1:03:16] it's accompanied with spiritual worship
[1:03:18] it's just like a a light striking a seed
[1:03:20] you take a seed in a package and that
[1:03:22] seed can sit on that shelf at Walmart
[1:03:24] for 20 years and it can sit in that same
[1:03:26] place and it'll never bring forth no
[1:03:28] life but you take that same seed and you
[1:03:30] put it in the ground and put a little
[1:03:31] water on it and you bury in the dirt
[1:03:33] brother Mark and you let the light from
[1:03:34] the sun strike that seed it don't take
[1:03:37] very long and and all of a sudden it
[1:03:39] starts to germinate and then and it
[1:03:40] brings forth life the life that has been
[1:03:42] laying on the inside of it the whole
[1:03:43] time the life that you can't see with a
[1:03:45] naked eye the life that a microscope
[1:03:47] can't find but there's something inside
[1:03:49] of it it ain't moving it's laying
[1:03:50] dormant but in the light of the sun you
[1:03:52] tell me friend there ain't no such a a
[1:03:54] thing is Supernatural what can take
[1:03:56] something that's dead that ain't moving
[1:03:58] that ain't growing that can sit forever
[1:04:00] in the dark cell and never bring forth
[1:04:02] nothing but in the presence of a lie
[1:04:03] it'll spring forth a tree and its leaves
[1:04:06] begin to BL or to bloom out and
[1:04:08] something in it begins to grow and it
[1:04:09] waves and it ain't long it brings forth
[1:04:12] the fruit of its
[1:04:13] maker tell me there ain't no such a
[1:04:15] thing as Supernatural man you can take a
[1:04:17] seed and believe the supernatural
[1:04:19] everybody's looking for some great big
[1:04:21] thing go get you an apple seed it's the
[1:04:23] supernatural God brother Mark they can
[1:04:25] it's what God made a life that can bring
[1:04:28] forth and that's what happens to a
[1:04:29] Believer brother Wesley when the light
[1:04:31] strikes the seed that is inside the
[1:04:33] heart of a Believer but a mark it
[1:04:35] changes who you are all of a sudden
[1:04:37] something begins to grow in you and and
[1:04:39] you begin to worship God you're just
[1:04:40] like that little plant you know when a
[1:04:42] plant is Young And it grows up and and
[1:04:44] my it's just you take a wheat plant when
[1:04:46] it some when it gets bigger it's kind of
[1:04:47] stiff and but when it's little it's just
[1:04:49] leaves are just flowing in the wind and
[1:04:51] my it ain't got no care in the world
[1:04:53] it's just enjoying the new life that it
[1:04:54] has I think that's the way it is with
[1:04:56] new Believers when the spirit of the
[1:04:57] Lord tracks their heart they just come
[1:04:59] to church my everybody in church is
[1:05:01] beautiful there ain't no problems in the
[1:05:03] church there ain't nobody ever argues my
[1:05:05] this is the best Church in the whole
[1:05:06] world why they're just young and
[1:05:07] enjoying the atmosphere of God it's a
[1:05:10] new
[1:05:11] atmosphere wouldn't it be wonderful if
[1:05:13] you could be a seed this morning it's a
[1:05:16] lot better out here than it was in that
[1:05:18] package it's a lot better out here than
[1:05:20] what the factory produced they packed us
[1:05:22] all in a pack somewhere and put us out
[1:05:24] and said this is how you're going to be
[1:05:25] and set you on a shelf and put you and
[1:05:27] put you to to work the way they want you
[1:05:28] to work but all of a sudden a new life
[1:05:30] comes my you're you're free you realize
[1:05:33] your real identity brother Mark it a it
[1:05:35] ain't what the world made you and it
[1:05:36] brings forth a spiritual worship how
[1:05:38] many knows it's always been that way you
[1:05:40] go in the Old Testament you'll find that
[1:05:42] when the word of God comes that worship
[1:05:44] came following the Bible says after
[1:05:46] their Exile in Babylon that Ezra the
[1:05:48] priest he came and he blessed the Lord
[1:05:50] the great God and all the people
[1:05:51] answered amen and amen men with the
[1:05:54] lifting of their hands and they bowed
[1:05:57] their heads and they worshiped the Lord
[1:05:58] with their faces to the ground in the
[1:06:01] Old Testament when Ezra read the word
[1:06:03] they said amen amen and they bowed their
[1:06:06] heads and they worshiped the Lord with
[1:06:07] their faces to the ground you say why
[1:06:09] did they worship that way because the
[1:06:11] word that had been far removed was
[1:06:13] brought near unto them isn't it
[1:06:15] something this way you ever you ever
[1:06:17] have a love one that goes on a trip or
[1:06:19] something for a little while there's a a
[1:06:21] longing in your heart if you ever went
[1:06:22] somewhere there's a longing in your your
[1:06:24] heart I know when I used to go to India
[1:06:26] a lot and you go over there and you you
[1:06:27] get a few weeks out of the country and
[1:06:30] and your phones don't work and the Wi-Fi
[1:06:31] is no good you can't even talk to your
[1:06:33] talk to your kids and some of you
[1:06:35] brothers that served in the military is
[1:06:36] a lot lot more than that and God bless
[1:06:38] you for it but whenever there's such a
[1:06:40] longing that comes in your heart but
[1:06:42] brother Wesley whenever you come back
[1:06:44] and and you see that loved one again you
[1:06:46] notice all those emotions that you feel
[1:06:48] why why they cry why are they excited
[1:06:51] they that they come home and brother
[1:06:52] Mark it's because that that something
[1:06:54] that you cherish is brought near to you
[1:06:57] isn't it something something that you
[1:06:58] cherish that has been removed from you
[1:07:00] but when it's brought near to you again
[1:07:03] it brings forth that kind of emotion and
[1:07:05] you see that that's the way we are we're
[1:07:07] as people we're collectors everybody
[1:07:09] here collects something the or some
[1:07:10] things that they like they like certain
[1:07:12] little colors or little trinkets or a a
[1:07:13] lot of us they they may collect guns or
[1:07:16] or knives or ink pens or or or whatever
[1:07:18] it is or old movies or something people
[1:07:20] people collect all sorts of things in
[1:07:22] this world but but you realize that that
[1:07:24] that whenever we have loved ones and
[1:07:25] you'll keep things that belong to them I
[1:07:28] I know my grandpa had an old had an old
[1:07:30] tackle box I still got at my shop I was
[1:07:32] cleaning out my shop and I was throwing
[1:07:34] everything away and and I got to that
[1:07:36] old tackle box and and I thought well
[1:07:37] I'm never going to use it's one of them
[1:07:39] old plastic ones that don't I mean no
[1:07:40] nobody would ever take that thing
[1:07:42] fishing but I just couldn't bring myself
[1:07:43] to throw it away because it was my
[1:07:45] grandpa's that's the only thing that
[1:07:47] that that I had that that was my grandpa
[1:07:48] so I put it back on the shelf and it'll
[1:07:50] be there for another 20 years brother
[1:07:51] Mark sitting on that shelf I'll never
[1:07:53] use it but there there just something
[1:07:54] about it that my grandpa used it see
[1:07:57] it's because it's somebody that you
[1:07:59] cherish and so you you see how it is is
[1:08:02] whenever that that thing that you
[1:08:03] cherish when it's brought to you brother
[1:08:05] Wesley it brings an emotion that's what
[1:08:07] happens when the word comes to a
[1:08:09] Believer it's a cherished word Glory
[1:08:12] that word that you cherish and it's
[1:08:13] brought to your heart and it steers you
[1:08:15] and it begins to steer your heart and it
[1:08:18] and it causes an emotion out of this
[1:08:20] little human body that we have I I know
[1:08:22] the world they look at it and they say
[1:08:23] well that ain't just nothing but a bunch
[1:08:25] of emotion they're just out there
[1:08:26] shouting and screaming and dancing and
[1:08:27] crying and all this snotting around but
[1:08:29] you realize it is emotion because we're
[1:08:31] human B but it's not just but it ain't
[1:08:34] the point that it's emotion it's what
[1:08:36] stimulates the emotion see see if
[1:08:38] somebody made you mad that's an emotion
[1:08:40] but it was stimulated by by a wrong act
[1:08:42] but here whenever the word comes it
[1:08:44] causes an emotion it stimulates you and
[1:08:47] and because it's something that you
[1:08:48] cherish brother Mar it causes you to
[1:08:50] worship God it causes you to raise your
[1:08:53] hands it causes you that's why y'all
[1:08:55] been in here shouting and saying amen
[1:08:57] and Hallelujah because something that
[1:08:58] you cherish has been spoken to your
[1:09:00] heart and saying that's my God and my I
[1:09:03] love the Lord and I'm a Christian and
[1:09:05] I'm a Believer and I was called into
[1:09:06] this Marvelous Light it's something that
[1:09:09] you cherish and it brings forth an
[1:09:11] emotion let me tell you friends it's
[1:09:12] always done it it done it in the old I
[1:09:14] may as well just preach a minute it done
[1:09:16] it in the Old Testament and it done it
[1:09:17] in the New Testament the Bible says
[1:09:19] under the Old Testament how many knows
[1:09:21] the Old Testament it was the story of
[1:09:23] Israel the natural nation of Israel how
[1:09:25] God made them and brought them out and
[1:09:27] then they went into captivity and they
[1:09:29] came out of captivity and they needed to
[1:09:31] deliver and and and the Bible would tell
[1:09:33] us in the Old Testament at the end of
[1:09:35] the Old Testament it prophesies of the
[1:09:37] of the natural Babylon of Israel their
[1:09:40] natural Babylon captivity and how that
[1:09:42] God would deliver them that's the ending
[1:09:43] of the Old Testament how they went into
[1:09:45] Babylonian captivity but God would
[1:09:47] deliver but then when you look at the
[1:09:49] New Testament it's the same thing but
[1:09:51] it's a spiritual Babylon the New
[1:09:52] Testament it ends and Prophecies of a
[1:09:55] spiritual church and a spiritual Babylon
[1:09:57] and how they would go into into
[1:09:59] spiritual bondage but that God would
[1:10:01] bring them out so you see it didn't
[1:10:02] matter if it's the Old Testament or the
[1:10:03] New Testament or the natural or the
[1:10:05] spiritual it was the same thing taking
[1:10:07] place it was Christ delivering his
[1:10:10] church again somebody say Amen so when
[1:10:12] the word comes in the Old Testament it
[1:10:15] brings spiritual worship because Christ
[1:10:17] was delivering his church and when the
[1:10:19] word comes in the New Testament it
[1:10:21] brings spiritual worship because it's
[1:10:23] Christ that was delivering his church my
[1:10:25] it didn't change I I I think that's
[1:10:27] something that you can turn over just a
[1:10:28] couple of pages in your Bible but you'll
[1:10:30] find something that's the same when the
[1:10:32] word of God come the people worship God
[1:10:35] that's what the Bible said when Jesus
[1:10:36] came down off the Mount of Olives the
[1:10:38] Bible said and he was come nigh unto
[1:10:41] them what it was the word coming close
[1:10:43] and when he came nigh unto them they
[1:10:45] begin to rejoice and praise God but the
[1:10:48] Wesley they took their coats and they
[1:10:49] threw them down in their way they took
[1:10:51] the leaves and the Palm leaves and they
[1:10:53] threw them down in the way that he could
[1:10:54] walk on and the Bible said they cried
[1:10:56] out Hosanna oh the the Lamb of God he's
[1:10:59] the the very King that God has sent to
[1:11:01] the Earth Hallelujah they begin to bless
[1:11:03] the name of the Lord bless the king that
[1:11:05] cometh in the name of the Lord peace on
[1:11:07] heaven and glory to God they begin to
[1:11:10] shout and praise God how many knows the
[1:11:12] only people that weren't worshiping with
[1:11:13] them somebody say it the only ones that
[1:11:16] didn't worship the Bible says was the
[1:11:18] Pharisees that was among them you say oh
[1:11:20] aren't the Pharisees on the outside oh
[1:11:22] no the Bible says the Pharisees was
[1:11:24] right in the middle of the multitude and
[1:11:26] when they started worshiping God the
[1:11:28] Pharisees didn't like it and said would
[1:11:30] you rebuke your disciples and Jesus said
[1:11:33] if they should hold their peace these
[1:11:35] Stones would immediately glory to
[1:11:38] God if they should hold their peace
[1:11:41] these Stones would immediately cry out
[1:11:44] these stones that God had made think
[1:11:46] about it he said we are Lively stones
[1:11:49] and if them Lively Stones would hold
[1:11:51] their peace well then them Stones would
[1:11:53] immediately cry out they can't hold
[1:11:55] their peace Glory why brother Mark
[1:11:57] because Christ the word was drawing nigh
[1:12:00] where is it today brother Wesley you a
[1:12:03] people are looking for God everywhere
[1:12:04] let me tell you he's right here in his
[1:12:06] people and when Christ comes n it brings
[1:12:09] a spiritual war somebody say Amen
[1:12:11] somebody say praise the Lord isn't it
[1:12:13] wonderful but tell me if it's not the
[1:12:15] truth when the word comes n into your
[1:12:17] heart it makes you want to worship God
[1:12:19] how many how many say Amen to that what
[1:12:21] causes you look around what causes it
[1:12:23] the mark Cuz the word comes n unto thee
[1:12:25] I'm going to take a break and let Paul
[1:12:26] preach it for a
[1:12:28] minute Paul said breth my heart's desire
[1:12:31] and prayer to God for Israel is that
[1:12:33] they might be saved this is the desire
[1:12:36] of apostle
[1:12:37] Paul he says for I bear them record that
[1:12:40] they have a Zeal of God but not
[1:12:41] according to knowledge could that not be
[1:12:44] said about many today for the Westy that
[1:12:48] they have a Zeal of God but they don't
[1:12:49] have the knowledge of God many churches
[1:12:52] and people that come to together brother
[1:12:54] Mark and but they have a Zeal of God but
[1:12:56] not the knowledge of God for Paul said
[1:12:58] they're ignorant of God's righteousness
[1:13:00] and they go about establishing their own
[1:13:03] righteousness have not submitted
[1:13:05] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[1:13:07] in other words they're trying to they're
[1:13:08] trying to do something to be able to
[1:13:09] make it in for Christ is the end of the
[1:13:12] law for righteousness to everyone that
[1:13:14] would believe for Moses described the
[1:13:17] righteousness which is of the law that
[1:13:19] the man which doeth those things shall
[1:13:20] live by them but the righteousness which
[1:13:22] is of faith speaketh on this wise say
[1:13:24] not in thy heart who shall Ascend in
[1:13:27] other other words that is to bring
[1:13:28] Christ down from heaven or who shall
[1:13:30] descend to bring Christ again up from
[1:13:33] the dead he said but what saith it in
[1:13:36] other words that we're not going to the
[1:13:37] Heavens to look for Christ we're not
[1:13:39] going in the Earth the in in in the
[1:13:42] depths to look for Christ he said but
[1:13:43] what what saith it the word is n thee
[1:13:46] glory to God somebody say n Thee the
[1:13:49] word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and
[1:13:51] in thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:13:53] which we preach that if Thou shalt
[1:13:55] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:13:58] and Shall Believe in thy heart that God
[1:14:00] hath raised him from the dead then Thou
[1:14:02] shalt be saved is't that wonderful that
[1:14:05] makes it really plain if you'll confess
[1:14:07] with your mouth the Lord Jesus and
[1:14:09] believe in your heart that God has
[1:14:10] raised him from the dead then Thou shalt
[1:14:12] there's going to be a lot of people say
[1:14:14] that you don't think they were saved
[1:14:15] because the Bible but Paul tells us they
[1:14:17] would be saved it's a whosoever
[1:14:18] whosoever will brother Mark he says see
[1:14:21] if Thou shalt confess Thou shalt be
[1:14:22] saved for with the heart the man
[1:14:24] believeth under righteousness and with
[1:14:26] the mouth confession is made under
[1:14:28] salvation I know we make up all kinds of
[1:14:29] rules of what will save somebody if
[1:14:31] you'll do what our church thinks you
[1:14:33] ought to do then you'll be saved if you
[1:14:35] and maybe this pastor you know I don't
[1:14:36] know a single Pastor another Pastor that
[1:14:38] think thinks every way the same the
[1:14:40] other pastor does I I used to witness a
[1:14:42] lot in the Amish community and they say
[1:14:44] well it's Amish so they we still do but
[1:14:47] but but it's Hest so that's just way
[1:14:48] they believe well that ain't true it
[1:14:49] depends on what Hest Community you go to
[1:14:51] every one of them believe a little bit
[1:14:52] different one one of them says you can
[1:14:53] smoke one of them says you can drink one
[1:14:55] of them says you can't one of them says
[1:14:56] you can have a radio the other one said
[1:14:57] it has to be battery powered the other
[1:14:59] one says you can have a a battery on
[1:15:00] your on your tractor the other one says
[1:15:02] you can't you has to be horse drawn but
[1:15:03] they're all homish but each one make up
[1:15:05] their own rules you see they're trying
[1:15:08] to make their own righteousness he said
[1:15:10] but my he said but listen but if thou
[1:15:12] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus a
[1:15:14] man that believeth under righteousness
[1:15:15] with his mouth confession is made unto
[1:15:17] salvation for the scripture says
[1:15:19] whosoever believe on him shall not be
[1:15:22] ashamed for there is no difference
[1:15:24] listen because the Jews would say that
[1:15:26] if you weren't a Jew you wasn't a Christ
[1:15:28] you you wasn't a a Believer you couldn't
[1:15:31] make it the only way to heaven was to be
[1:15:33] an Israelite the only way to is to be a
[1:15:35] Jew it's your natural enage Paul says no
[1:15:37] wonder they hated Paul he said there's
[1:15:38] no difference between the Jew and the
[1:15:40] Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich
[1:15:44] unto them that call upon him and
[1:15:46] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:15:47] the Lord shall be saved somebody say
[1:15:49] that with me shall be saved now ain't
[1:15:52] that something he said the Lord over all
[1:15:55] is Rich unto them that call upon Him
[1:15:57] brother Wes isn't that wonderful our God
[1:15:59] is a rich God that boy make me feel good
[1:16:02] our God is a rich God he he said he's
[1:16:04] Rich over all under all them that call
[1:16:07] upon him I know God is rich in mean
[1:16:08] things but Mark he's a creator of the
[1:16:10] world the Bible say he he owns a cattle
[1:16:12] on a thousand hills he's rich in cattle
[1:16:14] and rich in lands rich in kingdoms and
[1:16:16] rich in gold and rich in silver but this
[1:16:18] ain't what Paul is speaking of he said
[1:16:20] God the same Lord is Rich unto all of
[1:16:22] them that upon him you say what was he
[1:16:24] talking about the Bible says our God who
[1:16:27] is rich in Mercy Glory that word Rich it
[1:16:31] means wealthy it means exceedingly more
[1:16:33] than enough to meet your needs I don't
[1:16:35] know about you but when I think about my
[1:16:37] God Brother David he's rich in Mercy
[1:16:40] that means he has more Mercy than I'll
[1:16:42] ever have need of my don't that make you
[1:16:44] feel good this morning that our God has
[1:16:46] a wealth of Mercy he has Treasures of
[1:16:48] Mercy brother Mar to be able to be given
[1:16:50] unto us he said for his great love
[1:16:52] wherewith he Lov loved us even when we
[1:16:54] were dead in sins he hath quickened us
[1:16:56] together with Christ for by Grace you
[1:16:58] are saved no wonder we shout no wonder
[1:17:01] we say hallelujah no wonder we praise
[1:17:03] God no wonder we dance in the spirit but
[1:17:05] I'm Mar because we're worshiping in the
[1:17:07] richness of the mercies of almighty God
[1:17:10] we're worshiping in the wealth of his
[1:17:12] grace and the wealth of his glory and
[1:17:14] the wealth of his Mercy the bible say
[1:17:17] that no good thing will God withhold
[1:17:19] from them that walk uprightly I thank
[1:17:22] God not only is he a rich God but he
[1:17:24] ain't going to withhold it from you
[1:17:26] there ain't nothing like a rich person
[1:17:27] that's stings you but I thank God that
[1:17:29] God is rich in Mercy and he ain't he
[1:17:31] ain't just holding it somewhere and
[1:17:32] keeping in his own bank account and not
[1:17:34] sharing it but our God ain't no stingy
[1:17:36] God but he's giving it B said he won't
[1:17:39] withhold it from you all of those that
[1:17:41] will walk uprightly Oh my he was rich in
[1:17:44] Mercy my if that was money we was
[1:17:46] talking about y'all be running all over

[1:17:49] billionaire and he was giving everybody
[1:17:50] a million dollars you know what you'd do
[1:17:52] but Mark you take that million dollars
[1:17:53] like they do in the movies and you'd

[1:19:12] your problem so you may well just say
[1:19:14] Amen anyway it's the word of the Lord
[1:19:16] that's coming n to thee you may as well
[1:19:18] praise God anyway the Bible said if they
[1:19:20] don't praise him the rocks will cry out
[1:19:24] I'm So Unworthy of such Mercy now aren't
[1:19:27] we all though Unworthy of such Mercy but
[1:19:32] when he was on the cross I was on his
[1:19:36] mind we're Unworthy of the mercy of God
[1:19:40] but he won't withhold it I don't know
[1:19:42] about y'all it makes me want to
[1:19:44] have I'm Unworthy of the mercy of God
[1:19:47] but he won't withhold it is that
[1:19:50] something somebody give you a gift man I
[1:19:51] don't deserve that you come out work for
[1:19:53] somebody do a little bit of work and
[1:19:55] they come by and they give you way way
[1:19:57] you know $1,000 you help them for a few
[1:19:59] hours oh no brother I didn't I didn't do
[1:20:01] that much work I I was just here for a
[1:20:03] couple hours I no I'm not wor but no but
[1:20:05] I want to give it to you that's the way
[1:20:07] God is with his Mercy I'm not worthy of
[1:20:10] it I I didn't do anything to deserve it
[1:20:12] Glory but he won't withhold it my
[1:20:17] may he won't withhold it brother Mark
[1:20:19] it's the mercy of God we're Unworthy of
[1:20:22] it but he won't withhold that's isn't
[1:20:24] that what Isaiah said last Sunday I
[1:20:27] touched on that how that he said I'm a
[1:20:29] man of unclean lips amongst the people
[1:20:32] that are unclean people but the angel of
[1:20:34] the Lord the Bible said the angel of the
[1:20:35] Lord brought a live coal how many knows
[1:20:36] what that coal it wasn't like a charcoal
[1:20:38] but it was a stone they would heat up
[1:20:39] the stones and and and and that stone it
[1:20:42] become red hot and they put that up on
[1:20:43] the Altar and then they'd reuse them
[1:20:45] each time but the Bible says but the
[1:20:46] angel of the Lord took tongs and he took
[1:20:48] a live coal off the Altar and he touched
[1:20:50] the lips of Isaiah and he said that man
[1:20:52] that was of unclean lips now he could go
[1:20:54] do the work of the Lord even though he
[1:20:55] said I'm unworthy but then whenever God
[1:20:57] gave him a commission he said send me oh
[1:20:59] Lord a man with a man that was unworthy
[1:21:02] but because he was touched with that Liv
[1:21:04] Stone brother Mark isn't it something
[1:21:05] that Peter that Peter would call it a
[1:21:07] Liv Stone he said Jesus was a livestone
[1:21:10] in other word brother Mark what was it
[1:21:11] if he's a Liv Stone he was the fire I'm
[1:21:14] getting somewhere just a minute he he
[1:21:15] said if he was a Liv Stone he was the
[1:21:17] fire of God that would cleanse us my cuz
[1:21:19] the Bible says whatever touches it would
[1:21:21] become clean here it was the it was the
[1:21:24] stone of God let me tell you something
[1:21:25] about this Jesus if he's a live Stone
[1:21:27] and and brother brother brother Jared
[1:21:29] and whatever touches it will become
[1:21:30] clean it's no wonder that the leper came
[1:21:33] in there I'm going to tell you something
[1:21:34] about a leper the leper was unworthy the
[1:21:36] leper had to go when he come into town
[1:21:38] the leper had to announce his presence
[1:21:40] by saying I'm unclean I'm unclean and if
[1:21:42] he didn't they would kill him they'
[1:21:43] Stone him to death you you can't sneak
[1:21:45] up on a bunch of people and bring your
[1:21:47] plague in amongst them so he had to
[1:21:49] announce it at the door I'm unclean I'm
[1:21:51] unclean don't know nobody get by me I'm
[1:21:53] unclean I'm unclean this is the this is
[1:21:55] the the life of a leper leprosy is a
[1:21:58] type of sin that's why many of us we
[1:22:00] come to church we come brother jar we
[1:22:03] come in with our head down I'm unclean
[1:22:04] I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm unclean well
[1:22:07] well Brother come on to church and you
[1:22:09] come down sit down on a Pew but I'm
[1:22:10] unclean I'm unclean I can't I can't have
[1:22:13] any Liberty I I can't worship God I I I
[1:22:15] can't I can't get right I'm unclean I'm
[1:22:18] unclean that's the way people think
[1:22:20] about the gospel I'm unclean I'm unan C
[1:22:23] though he was but listen what the leper
[1:22:25] says even in his leprosy the Bible said
[1:22:28] when Jesus come down from the mountain
[1:22:30] and the multitudes followed him the
[1:22:31] leper had a revelation that other people
[1:22:33] didn't have listen what he said he said
[1:22:36] the Bible says the leper came and
[1:22:38] worshiped him that's the Pharisee
[1:22:40] wouldn't worship him but the leper would
[1:22:43] the Pharisee wouldn't get near him but
[1:22:45] the leper would and the Bible says the
[1:22:47] leper came and he worshiped him he said
[1:22:49] Lord if thou will thou could make me
[1:22:51] clean amen he first worshiped God he
[1:22:55] said and if you would I know you could
[1:22:57] make me clean and listen what the Bible
[1:22:59] said Jesus put forth his hand here's
[1:23:01] that Lively Stone touching him Jesus put
[1:23:04] forth his hand and he says I will be
[1:23:07] thou clean isn't it something If thy
[1:23:09] will make me clean and Jesus's response
[1:23:12] was that is my will man you know you
[1:23:14] don't feel like you can be right with
[1:23:15] God and you don't you don't feel like
[1:23:17] you can have Liberty to in the house of
[1:23:19] God anymore but come in as the leper and
[1:23:21] worship God anyway and say Lord if thou
[1:23:23] will I know thou can make me clean it's
[1:23:25] the will of God that you will be clean
[1:23:28] so what he do he got close enough to
[1:23:30] that Lively Stone that it touched him
[1:23:32] and the Bible says it made him clean and
[1:23:34] immediately his leprosy disappeared
[1:23:37] immediately his leprosy was cleansed he
[1:23:39] didn't have to go through a seven-step
[1:23:41] program to get back in the church he
[1:23:43] didn't have to go through everybody's
[1:23:44] little Book of Rules of what allows you
[1:23:45] to come back in the house of God and be
[1:23:47] a part of the worship of God but the
[1:23:49] Bible said immediately when he touched
[1:23:51] that Lively Stone but Mark the leprosy
[1:23:53] was cleansed off of
[1:23:56] him immediately he was made clean that's
[1:23:59] what happened to the maniac down there
[1:24:00] whenever Jesus went to him he said what
[1:24:02] have I to do with thee Jesus of Nazareth
[1:24:04] he said come out of him you don't belong
[1:24:06] in him and he cast The Demon into the
[1:24:07] swine and the Bible said when Jesus went
[1:24:09] down think of many people had came in
[1:24:11] his presence but when he met Jesus he
[1:24:13] was made clean that's what he told the
[1:24:15] woman that was through at his feet that
[1:24:16] was an adulterous it don't matter what
[1:24:17] your problem is when she was an
[1:24:18] adulteress they caught her in the act of
[1:24:20] adultery and they threw her at Jesus's
[1:24:22] feet and what he did Brother Wesley the
[1:24:23] Bible says he went down and got the
[1:24:25] drawing in the sand he said whichever
[1:24:26] one of you don't have a sand you cast
[1:24:28] the first stone the woman still sitting
[1:24:30] there with her head down I'm unclean I'm
[1:24:32] unclean and Jesus Took her by the hand
[1:24:36] and he said now woman he said look
[1:24:38] around where are thine accusers nobody
[1:24:41] stuck around why because they all had
[1:24:42] sin just like she did CU they were
[1:24:44] living in flesh and he said NE neither
[1:24:47] do I accuse thee so go and sin no more
[1:24:50] now when he touched her she became can't
[1:24:52] clean a't that something I to touch that
[1:24:56] Lively Stone brother B said see he said
[1:24:57] he cleans his people by fire the Holy
[1:25:00] Ghost in fire not by a declaration of
[1:25:02] Creeds or books or something that you've
[1:25:03] got to learn a bunch of prayers and so
[1:25:05] forth that ain't how God cleans you he
[1:25:07] cleans them by fire off the altar isn't
[1:25:10] that wonderful that's how God cleanses
[1:25:12] his people as way he's always done it
[1:25:13] when they came to the upper room 120 was
[1:25:15] in an upper room the Holy Ghost fell
[1:25:17] tongues of fire fell on them they were
[1:25:18] cleansed and ready for service cuz
[1:25:20] that's how God cleansed he said God
[1:25:21] don't cleanse by knowledge God cleanses
[1:25:23] by fire that's why God that's why the
[1:25:26] you come to church and the outpouring of
[1:25:28] the Holy Ghost but Mark it's the very
[1:25:29] fire of God that comes to clean the
[1:25:31] church I know when people look at it
[1:25:33] they say well isn't the fire of God the
[1:25:35] Judgment of God but this isn't talking
[1:25:37] about the Judgment of God but this fire
[1:25:39] of God brother Mark isn't judgment it's
[1:25:41] the very mercy of almighty God it didn't
[1:25:43] wonder that fire would bring judgment
[1:25:45] but out of that same fire that God that
[1:25:47] God would bring Mercy you know what that
[1:25:49] tells me that Mercy is greater than
[1:25:51] judgment I can preach a whole message on
[1:25:53] that's what the Bible said the Bible
[1:25:54] said that Mercy triumphs over judgment
[1:25:57] so when judgment would look to Prevail
[1:25:59] Mercy is going to Triumph when judgment
[1:26:01] looks like it's got you all the way down
[1:26:03] brother Mah and there ain't no way back
[1:26:04] for you but Mercy triumphs over judgment
[1:26:07] it's greater it's a greater Victor it's
[1:26:09] stronger in battle it's more power than
[1:26:12] judgment has Mercy triumphs over
[1:26:14] judgment Our God who is riching Mercy
[1:26:17] think about it he would call on you when
[1:26:19] before judgment was tracked that's the
[1:26:21] purpose of this very message but a mark
[1:26:22] is to call a people back to God to
[1:26:24] redeem a bride back to himself in the
[1:26:27] time of judgment so God would send a
[1:26:28] gift into this Earth and for the very
[1:26:30] purpose of drawing you out of
[1:26:31] denominations and out of Creeds and out
[1:26:33] of the things that men have made back to
[1:26:36] the very Cross of Calvary and to the man
[1:26:39] Jesus Christ think about it that was the
[1:26:41] message what is the attraction on the
[1:26:42] mountain it was to draw you think of it
[1:26:45] it was to draw you to something back to
[1:26:47] Christ the message invisible Union how
[1:26:49] many knows what that message was about
[1:26:50] invisible Union the the the whole
[1:26:52] message of invisible Union was to show
[1:26:55] that you can't be married to two
[1:26:56] husbands at the same time that was the
[1:26:58] that was the basis of the message you
[1:27:00] can't have two husbands at the same time
[1:27:02] so here God W would would show that you
[1:27:05] that people are married to a church
[1:27:06] they're married to a denomination
[1:27:07] they're married you know if you ask them
[1:27:09] something that well the church says the
[1:27:11] church says the church says the priest
[1:27:12] says the the pastor says it's all but
[1:27:14] but but it ain't nothing about that but
[1:27:16] God would come and say you can't be
[1:27:18] married to that husband but be married
[1:27:19] to Christ be led by Christ led by the
[1:27:22] Holy
[1:27:23] Ghost see so it was a restoration back
[1:27:26] to Christ and so but if God is going to
[1:27:28] restore you do I got just a minute if
[1:27:30] God is going to restore you then God
[1:27:32] would have to provide a place that you
[1:27:34] could take what was unclean and put it
[1:27:36] see God if you're going to come in the
[1:27:37] church and he's going to restore you in
[1:27:38] the church then God would have to
[1:27:40] provide a place for you to for you to
[1:27:42] put all that sin nature see he couldn't
[1:27:44] just let you carry it because he's going
[1:27:45] to do away with it so he has to make a
[1:27:47] place for you to bury it and that that
[1:27:49] you don't have to die with it this is
[1:27:50] the problem with people this is why
[1:27:51] people people can't be Christians
[1:27:53] because they carry all this baggage from
[1:27:54] their whole life and they don't know
[1:27:56] where to put it I've been like this my
[1:27:58] whole life and I've done this and I done
[1:28:00] that my my and it's all the history of
[1:28:02] their life and they ain't got nowhere to
[1:28:04] put it so they pack it to church every
[1:28:06] time they come to church and they can't
[1:28:07] get free and worship God they pack it
[1:28:09] home and they they pack it in their
[1:28:11] problem when they're driving down the
[1:28:12] road with their husband and wife well I
[1:28:13] know what you did and I know what you
[1:28:15] did and they can't ever have a
[1:28:16] relationship cuz they're still stuck on
[1:28:18] something that happened in their past
[1:28:19] life they're packing it and they got
[1:28:21] nowhere to put it we here God would
[1:28:24] provide a place to put it a that
[1:28:26] something you don't have to carry there
[1:28:28] glory to God you don't have to carry
[1:28:29] there the rest of your life but God
[1:28:31] would make a place that you could put it
[1:28:33] that you don't have to die with it you
[1:28:34] remember you remember the story of Hosea
[1:28:36] and and Gomer his wife remember she was
[1:28:38] a she was a harlot and God sent Hosea
[1:28:41] and he went out and he married a harlot
[1:28:43] and he took all of the things of her
[1:28:45] life and he said you put them away and
[1:28:47] now she'll be made clean and so he
[1:28:49] married her and she became his bride and
[1:28:51] after a little while the Bible would
[1:28:52] tell us that she went back out and was
[1:28:54] playing the part of a harlot again now
[1:28:56] in adultery so G not or or Hosea when he
[1:29:00] would come you'd read this in Hosea the
[1:29:01] 2 chapter that Hosea goes and he starts
[1:29:04] speaking of the Judgment upon Goomer
[1:29:07] because of the condition she was in and
[1:29:08] the adultery she was in but notice in
[1:29:10] two scriptures I'm going to read these
[1:29:12] Hosea when he speaks of her judgment it
[1:29:14] looks like she would be destroyed and he
[1:29:16] says I will visit upon her the days of
[1:29:18] balum wherein she burned incense unto
[1:29:20] them and also a type of of Israel in
[1:29:22] their condition she decked herself with
[1:29:24] her earrings and her D jewels and she
[1:29:26] went after her lovers and she forgot me
[1:29:29] sayeth the Lord see it's a time of
[1:29:30] judgment I'm going to visit her because
[1:29:33] she forgot me she's put on her she's
[1:29:34] she's adorned herself in jewels and and
[1:29:36] she's went back into these other men in
[1:29:38] adultery he says so she forgot me but
[1:29:41] notice the very next verse watch what do
[1:29:43] God does with that here she was an
[1:29:44] adulterous woman she was she was all
[1:29:46] kinds of unclean brother Mark but then
[1:29:48] the very next verse he says therefore
[1:29:50] behold listen what God's this is what
[1:29:52] God's judgment looks like here comes the
[1:29:53] wrath of God he said but therefore
[1:29:55] behold I will Allure
[1:29:58] her in other words draw her I will bring
[1:30:01] her into the Wilderness and speak
[1:30:02] comfortably unto her here the very one
[1:30:05] that looked like judgment was coming
[1:30:07] that's what the attraction on the
[1:30:08] mountain was brother Mark it was the
[1:30:09] luring of God that God could draw us out
[1:30:12] of that all that confusion and all that
[1:30:15] that that nobody knows what's right and
[1:30:17] what's really wrong and and and what's
[1:30:19] really true and and and couldn't tiw the
[1:30:21] scripture together but God he would
[1:30:22] Allure her he said I will bring her out
[1:30:25] into a place that I can speak
[1:30:26] comfortably comfortably to her so even
[1:30:28] in the time of judgment God would bring
[1:30:30] her to a place that he could speak to
[1:30:32] her about the mercy of God isn't it
[1:30:35] something that's what the Bible says I
[1:30:36] will give her the Vineyards from then
[1:30:38] listen what God gave her I'll give her
[1:30:40] the valley of aor for a Door of Hope how
[1:30:42] many remember Wednesday night the valley
[1:30:44] of acor that's where that's where uh
[1:30:46] achen was taken because he had sinned
[1:30:47] Israel went into battle they lost the
[1:30:49] battle the only battle Joshua lost and
[1:30:51] because they lost the battle they went
[1:30:52] they found sin in the camp it was Ain
[1:30:54] and his family they took him to the
[1:30:55] valley of aor and they stoned them and
[1:30:57] burned them and and they buried the sin
[1:30:59] in the valley of acor but notice the
[1:31:01] purpose of the story brother Wesley is
[1:31:03] that after the Sim was buried they went
[1:31:06] back to the same battle and they won the
[1:31:08] victory so here God says but I will give
[1:31:11] her a valley of acor for a door of hope
[1:31:14] this is what God's telling you so you
[1:31:16] can take your past and you can take the
[1:31:18] sins and the failures and I'll give her
[1:31:20] this Valley in other words this is your
[1:31:22] possession Gomer and you can have it
[1:31:24] it'll be your door of hope that whatever
[1:31:26] that whatever would stop you from having
[1:31:28] a victory and whatever would stop you
[1:31:30] from moving on with God that you have a
[1:31:31] place to bury you that you can go back
[1:31:34] out and be victorious you can go back
[1:31:36] out and and be a righteous in the sight
[1:31:39] of God he said I'll sing to her and it
[1:31:42] shall be that make I don't know about
[1:31:43] y'all but it just touches my heart that
[1:31:45] God would give you a place to bury it
[1:31:46] but what is he showing us that you can
[1:31:48] bury it and you can carry on people feel
[1:31:51] like they can't go anymore with God I've
[1:31:52] done messed up to many times I've been
[1:31:54] to the altar a 100 times I've done
[1:31:55] repented a 100 times I still do the same
[1:31:57] thing and there ain't no hope but he
[1:31:58] said I'll give her the valley of acre as
[1:32:00] a door of hope you can bury it and go
[1:32:03] back out and win the victory over that
[1:32:04] you don't have to worry you don't have
[1:32:06] to worry about what tomorrow holds bury
[1:32:08] it go back out and win the victory God
[1:32:10] ain't going to leave you in judgment
[1:32:12] he's given Mercy ain't that wonderful in
[1:32:14] the time of judgment there's always
[1:32:15] Mercy he said and it shall be in that
[1:32:17] day sayith the Lord you shall call me
[1:32:19] ishy in other words husband you shall
[1:32:22] call me ishy and call me no more Bali
[1:32:25] for I will take the names of balam out
[1:32:27] of her mouth why a't that something all
[1:32:29] that all that doctrine of BM you get to
[1:32:31] talking to people and you can tell what
[1:32:32] church they came from because of the the
[1:32:34] the terminology that they use he said
[1:32:36] but I'll take all that out of her mouth
[1:32:39] and you'll just call me husband I'll
[1:32:41] draw you unto me where the only thing
[1:32:42] left in her mouth would be the word of
[1:32:44] the Lord my it ain't what the church
[1:32:46] says but it's what the word says it a it
[1:32:48] ain't what the priest said it's what the
[1:32:49] word said it ain't what the pastor said
[1:32:50] it's what the word said take all that
[1:32:52] out of her mouth and go back to the word
[1:32:54] of God listen brother Mark what he did
[1:32:56] is he gave her an authority in the word
[1:32:58] a new identity he said You shall call me
[1:33:01] husband see she was identified by
[1:33:03] another name I just think that's
[1:33:05] something that's the way this world is
[1:33:06] today but W see they're in an identity
[1:33:08] crisis they don't know what they are who
[1:33:10] they are they don't know who they want
[1:33:11] to be everybody wants to change to be
[1:33:12] something else or somebody else but my
[1:33:14] Bible says you are fearfully and
[1:33:16] wonderfully made let me tell you what we
[1:33:17] ought to do but Mark we ought to take
[1:33:19] what God made us and glorify God god
[1:33:21] with what made us quit trying to be
[1:33:23] something else and be what God Made You
[1:33:25] and glorify God with what made you
[1:33:26] because you were fearfully and
[1:33:28] wonderfully made don't be ashamed about
[1:33:29] what you are who you are or how God Made
[1:33:31] You just be proud of what God Made You
[1:33:33] and glorify God in the very image that
[1:33:35] God has made you
[1:33:39] in
[1:33:41] amen I'm going to close is this
[1:33:44] whatsoever a man Seth he also reaps
[1:33:47] that's the law we were speaking of it
[1:33:48] last Sunday that God would put what God
[1:33:50] would put in you he would get out of you
[1:33:52] it was a law of sewing and reaping
[1:33:54] notice what the prophet say says see
[1:33:56] you're sealed in you're beneath the
[1:33:57] blood you don't go out no more he said
[1:33:59] you're God's son and God's family sealed
[1:34:02] in by the Holy Spirit and the devil
[1:34:04] couldn't get you if he had to isn't that
[1:34:06] something you're God's son in God's
[1:34:08] family and you're sealed in by the Holy
[1:34:10] Spirit but let me tell you a secret
[1:34:12] before you were sealed in by the Holy
[1:34:14] Spirit you were still God's son and
[1:34:17] God's family isn't that something you
[1:34:19] were part of God Jesus said I've never
[1:34:21] lost one all that the father hath given
[1:34:22] me will come unto me they already belong
[1:34:25] to God he said you're a creation you're
[1:34:27] a creation of the word how are you a
[1:34:29] creation of the word brother Mark for
[1:34:30] only one reason because you was
[1:34:32] predestinated to it have you thought of
[1:34:34] this God's word can I can I have five
[1:34:35] minutes God's word is an eternal word
[1:34:38] but Mark the Bible says in John the
[1:34:40] first chapter in the beginning was the
[1:34:42] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:34:43] was God it was made it it was a God's
[1:34:45] word is an eternal word Paul said
[1:34:48] through faith we understand the worlds
[1:34:50] were framed by the word of God God so
[1:34:52] that things which we see were made of
[1:34:54] things which or or were not made of
[1:34:55] things which do appear they were made of
[1:34:57] the Unseen to see the world was framed
[1:34:59] by the word of God here he says listen
[1:35:02] what the prophet said the foundation
[1:35:03] stone listen and the foundation stone
[1:35:05] was laid in you before the foundation of
[1:35:08] the world catch this now this is my
[1:35:09] whole message the foundation stone was
[1:35:11] laid in you before the foundation of the
[1:35:13] world predestinated to be Sons and
[1:35:16] Daughters of God I thought when I read
[1:35:17] that that is such a powerful statement
[1:35:19] the foundation stone was laid in you
[1:35:22] before the foundation of the world I
[1:35:24] thought on that well you know what and
[1:35:26] it really when you first read it brother
[1:35:27] Mark it didn't really make sense the
[1:35:29] foundation stone was laid in you because
[1:35:31] when you read that Christ was the
[1:35:32] foundation well well we know that that
[1:35:34] word seed didn't come in you before the
[1:35:36] foundation of the world because Jesus
[1:35:37] teaches that differently he says
[1:35:39] whenever the whenever the master would
[1:35:40] come and he would sew seeds some of it
[1:35:41] would fall on Stony ground some of it
[1:35:43] would fall on on good ground he said but
[1:35:45] but then and it would bring forth
[1:35:47] according to the ground that it fell on
[1:35:49] remember some of it fell amongst the
[1:35:50] thistles some of it the Birds the seed
[1:35:52] so we see that that seed actually came
[1:35:54] at some other point right Jesus is
[1:35:56] showing it so it couldn't be that that
[1:35:57] he was talking about it was a foundation
[1:35:59] stone my the more I got to reading that
[1:36:01] the more I dug into it this is a
[1:36:02] powerful statement the foundation stone
[1:36:04] was laid in you before the foundation of
[1:36:06] the world so if it ain't a word seed
[1:36:08] then what is it after all if it ain't if
[1:36:09] it ain't that that that that what we
[1:36:11] what we read is our foundation brother
[1:36:13] Mark what is it well you find this word
[1:36:15] used in Revelations 19th Chapter or the
[1:36:17] 21st chapter the Bible said is speaking
[1:36:19] of the New Jerusalem and in the New
[1:36:21] Jerusalem the Bible says the foundations
[1:36:23] of the wall of the city were garnished
[1:36:25] with all manner of precious stones so
[1:36:27] whenever John saw the New Jerusalem come
[1:36:29] down he said they were garnished and the
[1:36:31] First Foundation was Jasper the second
[1:36:33] Sapphire the third chidoni the fourth
[1:36:35] Emerald the fifth sardinis the sixth
[1:36:37] sardus chelot barel topaz uh kusus and
[1:36:41] Jin and amethyst and so he goes through
[1:36:43] these 12 names that the foundations of
[1:36:46] the of the of the wall of the new city
[1:36:48] of Jerusalem would be would be garnished
[1:36:51] with so you see that these Stones
[1:36:52] brother Mark there was 12 of them
[1:36:54] because they typed the very tribes of
[1:36:56] Israel matter of fact it was the same
[1:36:58] Stones they they they use different
[1:36:59] words but when you look through the
[1:37:00] Bible I'll just skip the the study but
[1:37:02] through the Bible dictionary it's just
[1:37:03] the same stones with a different name
[1:37:05] but you'll find that these same Stones
[1:37:06] were written in Exodus 28th chapter
[1:37:09] where whenever the Bible says that God
[1:37:11] would would send Aaron to be a priest
[1:37:13] that these Stones would be put on the
[1:37:15] breastplate of Aaron the high priest so
[1:37:17] the Bible says there would be three
[1:37:18] across and then three more three more
[1:37:20] until all 12 stones and there would be
[1:37:22] written on them the names of the
[1:37:24] children of Israel so you see the same
[1:37:26] stones that was the foundation of the
[1:37:27] city are the same stones that was
[1:37:29] written on the breastplate but I notice
[1:37:31] the reason they are written upon the
[1:37:33] breastplate of Aaron notice that your
[1:37:35] name was written on it the stone on the
[1:37:37] breastplate of Aaron this is the urum
[1:37:38] thumm this is what this is what was used
[1:37:40] to judge the word so when somebody would
[1:37:42] come and say a word they would take the
[1:37:44] breastplate of Aaron and hang it up and
[1:37:45] all those stones off of each other they
[1:37:48] would determine whether it was right or
[1:37:49] not and they it would put forth this in
[1:37:51] such a way that you would know it was
[1:37:53] correct and today the prophet said today
[1:37:55] we got that same thing it's called The
[1:37:56] Bible and so when a man speaks something
[1:37:58] you ought to be able to take it and all
[1:38:00] those stones should still line up it
[1:38:01] ought to be able to reflect the very
[1:38:03] light of God so it can't be
[1:38:04] contradicting itself your your theology
[1:38:06] can't contradict Genesis and contradict
[1:38:08] Revelation it's got to all tie together
[1:38:10] but see these Stones were them Mar that
[1:38:12] each one of them were written on them a
[1:38:13] tribe of Israel so what what it what it
[1:38:15] represented is the stone that was on
[1:38:18] Aaron's breastplate actually represented
[1:38:20] their seed line or their genealogy so in
[1:38:23] other words if you if the if you was of
[1:38:25] a jasper stone then you were of the
[1:38:27] tribe of Reuben because Ruben was a he
[1:38:30] was the oldest son and that was the
[1:38:31] first stone and so to be to have a
[1:38:33] jasper stone would would tell the
[1:38:35] seedline that you came from so if you
[1:38:37] say well you're you're carrying that
[1:38:39] Jasper well he's definitely of the tribe
[1:38:41] of Ruben he come from the seed line of
[1:38:42] Ruin because that was the stone that
[1:38:44] identified that seed line it it was the
[1:38:46] sons of Jacob and they and they just to
[1:38:49] make it simple it was the but but the
[1:38:51] the sons of Jacob or of Israel and they
[1:38:53] were the 12 tribes of Israel and each
[1:38:55] one of them their lineage or their
[1:38:57] natural lineage was was was uh
[1:38:59] identified by that certain Stone so the
[1:39:01] foundation stone would be the very stone
[1:39:04] that would identify the seed line that
[1:39:06] you came from now you watch this through
[1:39:08] history Josephus whenever in the first
[1:39:10] century he actually took those stones
[1:39:12] and he combined them with astrological
[1:39:14] signs he said well he said well you know
[1:39:16] kind of made some connection to it and
[1:39:18] here in the in the 16th century in
[1:39:20] Poland there was philos phos opers that
[1:39:21] took that same thing and brother Wesley
[1:39:23] they they took it from astrological
[1:39:25] signs and attached it to months so now
[1:39:27] each month there's a stone that is
[1:39:28] affiliated with the month that you were
[1:39:30] born in which was before was attached to
[1:39:32] your astrological sign in 1912 in the
[1:39:35] United States the national uh uh uh uh
[1:39:37] gemstone whoever the Jewelers or the the
[1:39:40] group of Jewelers but in 1912 they
[1:39:42] actually gave the ones that we that we
[1:39:44] use today the garnet and all that all
[1:39:46] that there was a stone that identified
[1:39:48] the birth month that you were born in so
[1:39:50] you see that this birthstone that we use
[1:39:52] and although they're wonderful and
[1:39:53] they're fine and the jewers make money
[1:39:55] from it and we love to give them to
[1:39:56] people on the month they were born but
[1:39:57] it really has no significance over your
[1:39:59] your life or where you come from or or
[1:40:01] who you were and you see so so the real
[1:40:03] so the birthstone they're they're giving
[1:40:05] you a birthstone to show what month you
[1:40:07] were born in but let me tell you friends
[1:40:09] but here the prophet would say but the
[1:40:10] foundation stone was laid in you before
[1:40:13] the foundation of the world so you see
[1:40:15] this foundation stone brother Mark it
[1:40:17] ain't identifying the month that you
[1:40:19] were born in it ain't identifying the
[1:40:21] sign that you were born under but that
[1:40:23] foundation stone brother Jared is your
[1:40:25] real birth stone that that foundation
[1:40:27] stone is identifying the seed line that
[1:40:29] you were born into why if Reuben was a
[1:40:32] Jasper he said but you the foundation
[1:40:34] stone was in you it wasn't a month it
[1:40:36] ain't a star it ain't a sign it ain't
[1:40:38] referring to your natural seed brother
[1:40:40] Mark but it's referring to your
[1:40:42] spiritual seed line so the foundation
[1:40:44] stone in you is the predestinated seed
[1:40:47] of almighty God it's the seedline glory
[1:40:49] to God it makes me want to preach it's
[1:40:51] the seed line that you came from that's
[1:40:53] the foundation stone of your life it's
[1:40:55] where you it it ties you to your Gene it
[1:40:58] ties you to who your father was just
[1:41:00] like Jasper tied you to Reuben this
[1:41:02] foundation stone that that God has put
[1:41:05] in you tied you to almighty God you
[1:41:08] belong to him that's why he put it in
[1:41:10] you that's what Paul said he said for
[1:41:12] whom he did Forno somebody say Forno he
[1:41:15] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:41:17] the image of his son that he might be
