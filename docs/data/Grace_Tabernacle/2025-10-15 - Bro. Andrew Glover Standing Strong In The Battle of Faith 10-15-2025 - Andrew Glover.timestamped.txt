[9:57] Amen. It's certainly good to be gathered
[9:58] once again under the tents once more
[10:00] here for another year. I can't remember
[10:02] how many years, but it's certainly
[10:04] growing and growing. It's good to have
[10:05] each and every one of you. We got saints
[10:08] from all over. We got brother Ben Puit
[10:09] in his church. Brother Bennett, I'll
[10:11] have you come open the service in a word
[10:12] of prayer. Certainly good to have them
[10:14] and their congregation come support our
[10:16] meetings. It's good to have fellowship
[10:18] with the saints up there. Certainly
[10:20] enjoy them. We have some saints from
[10:22] Colorado. I can't remember all your
[10:24] names, but we're certainly glad to have
[10:25] you here with us. and each and any other
[10:28] visitors, we certainly welcome you and
[10:29] ask that you would just enter in and
[10:31] worship with us. We got our brother
[10:32] Andrew Glover here tonight. So, come
[10:34] with great expectations. Amen. Brother
[10:36] Ben, if you'll just open the service.
[10:41] You will. Let's bow our heads together.
[10:44] Heavenly Father, we come with great
[10:45] anticipation tonight of your grace and
[10:48] your mercy, Lord. because we've seen it
[10:50] so many times before when we had a need,
[10:52] Lord, or was a question in our heart,
[10:55] you come and answered that question and
[10:57] met that need. And we thank you for that
[10:59] tonight, Lord. You're so good to us,
[11:01] Lord. We're your children. And we we
[11:04] just want to love you tonight. And Lord,
[11:06] to return praise to you and worship,
[11:09] Father, in your name. I pray you grant
[11:10] it tonight. Lord, I pray if there'd be
[11:13] one sick among us tonight that you heal
[11:15] them. Lord, if there's a a backslider or
[11:17] a sinner, Lord, I pray you'd bring them
[11:19] close to the fire tonight. I pray that
[11:22] you'd move over these meetings, Lord, as
[11:24] we begin tonight. I I pray that your
[11:26] spirit would be in every service, Lord.
[11:28] That the Holy Ghost would have freedom
[11:30] to move. And Lord, that the word would
[11:32] be preached. And Lord, that each
[11:34] minister as they come, Lord, may you
[11:35] move them out of the way and take them
[11:37] away from what maybe they would want to
[11:39] do. But Lord, may you inspire them to
[11:41] speak something that would help your
[11:42] people. I pray for you'd move us, Lord,
[11:45] into the direction, Lord, of a body
[11:48] change and a rapture. We're looking
[11:49] forward to it, Lord, and we want to get
[11:51] closer, Lord, when we leave here than we
[11:53] were when we came. Pray you'd grant it
[11:55] now. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may have your seats this
[12:01] evening.
[12:03] Amen. Certainly good to be here. just we
[12:06] don't have any quick announcements, but
[12:07] if you do have any song specials,
[12:09] anything upon your heart, just let me
[12:11] know and hand me a note or find one of
[12:13] the brother Morgan right there. He's one
[12:15] of the deacons. You can give a note to
[12:16] him. I'm sure he'll pass it along and
[12:18] we'll do our best to get everybody in.
[12:20] Amen. How many of you came to worship
[12:21] the Lord this evening?
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, how many you came to
[12:25] worship the Lord this evening?
[12:30] Amen. And I asked that cuz I need you to
[12:31] worship for me because devil's been
[12:33] attacking my throat at all. And I
[12:34] thought, may, you know, maybe I can rest
[12:36] my ser my throat tonight. But I thought,
[12:39] you know, that's just what the devil
[12:40] wants. So I figure, you know what? I'm
[12:42] going to battle through it and I'm going
[12:43] to worship the Lord because he's worthy
[12:44] of every praise, every worship we can

[33:58] of lot of work that's been done and and

[34:29] the meeting. And we don't have any
[34:31] pre-planned and how uh things will be.
[34:34] We just want to let the Holy Ghost have
[34:35] his way. Amen. So how many can join us
[34:37] in that? Amen. So we just want to
[34:40] welcome you and say God bless you. Thank
[34:42] you for coming and uh being a support. I
[34:44] seen brother Ben back there and a lot of
[34:46] the church every year and uh coming up
[34:48] on Wednesday night and joining uh the
[34:51] meeting together. And so this uh this is
[34:53] a meeting for the bride of Jesus Christ.

[35:19] right. And most time the kids hair is
[35:21] all messed up. But it's okay. We you
[35:23] can't get starchy in a tent. Amen. And
[35:25] so one brother said he wasn't sure about
[35:28] about the meeting. He said he tried to
[35:30] he said it was a little bit odd in here.
[35:31] I said, "What do you mean?" He said,
[35:32] "Well, it's two tents."
[35:35] That's a bad That was That was bad. But
[35:39] But any anyway, we have two tents and

[44:12] [Music]
[44:17] [Applause]

[44:29] Amen. How many can give him a hand clap
[44:31] of praise tonight? Amen. How many is
[44:33] here to surrender to him? Amen.
[44:37] Amen. I'm thankful tonight we're
[44:39] gathered here under a divine promise.
[44:41] The Lord sent a prophet in this hour and
[44:43] he made a very powerful statement. He
[44:46] said, "If you'll surrender fully, then
[44:47] he'll come in fully. If you want more of
[44:50] God tonight than less of us and more of
[44:52] him, then whatever we can give up, Amen.
[44:55] He'll fill us with all of his goodness
[44:56] and all his mercy." I believe that's
[44:59] what we've come here for this weekend is
[45:00] to receive more of him, to receive all
[45:03] that he has for us tonight. Amen. It's a
[45:05] real honor to be gathered in his
[45:06] presence tonight with believers of like
[45:08] precious faith. And as we've come here
[45:10] tonight to open these meetings, maybe
[45:13] before we turn in the word, we could
[45:14] just bow our hearts for a word of prayer
[45:16] tonight. And amen. I know there's many
[45:18] needs here tonight. Many needs
[45:20] represented. Many, many needs will be in
[45:22] these meetings. But I believe the great
[45:24] physician is among us tonight. I believe
[45:26] the deliverer is here. Let's just
[45:28] approach him and join our faith
[45:30] together, laying aside everything that's
[45:32] unlike him and let's focus on him.
[45:34] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[45:37] have gathered here this afternoon on
[45:38] this Wednesday evening, Lord, we've not
[45:41] gathered here for just another meeting
[45:42] or another Lord service, Father. But
[45:46] Lord, we've gathered here under great
[45:47] expectation, Lord. Father, eagles have
[45:50] come together and your word said
[45:51] wherever the carcass is, there the
[45:53] eagles will be gathered together. And
[45:55] Lord, as I look around here tonight,
[45:57] there's more than two or three here
[45:58] tonight. So I know that you're here. For
[46:01] Lord, we've not gathered here in the
[46:02] name of a man or the name of a church.
[46:05] But Lord, we've gathered here in the
[46:06] name that is above every name. Lord, you
[46:08] said at that name every knee would bow,
[46:10] every tongue would confess. It's your
[46:12] name, the name of the Lord Jesus. And
[46:14] Father, as we're opening these meetings
[46:16] tonight, Lord, prepare in our hearts, oh
[46:18] God. Father, I pray that you would come
[46:20] among us this weekend in a special way.
[46:22] Lord, you see each and every heart here.
[46:24] Father, you know the junctions they may
[46:26] be at, Lord. Father, you know the
[46:28] sicknesses they may be battling in their
[46:29] bodies. Lord, maybe some would even be
[46:32] here tonight and does not know you.
[46:33] Lord, I know that you're still a savior,
[46:35] Lord. You're still a deliverer. You're
[46:38] still a Holy Ghost feeler, oh God. Come
[46:40] among us this weekend, Lord. We invite
[46:42] you, Father. Lord, have your way among
[46:44] us, Lord. Forgive us of our failures, oh
[46:46] God. Forgive us of our shortcomings,
[46:48] Lord. If there would be one devil
[46:50] somewhere trying to put a roadblock up
[46:52] on the things that are on their way to
[46:54] these meetings, the blessings of God.
[46:56] Father, we join our faith together
[46:57] tonight and drive that devil out of the
[46:59] name of Jesus. Satan, we will not give
[47:02] you one moment of these meetings. We
[47:03] will not give you one thought. We will
[47:05] not give you one second. We stand here
[47:07] tonight to declare you are defeated in
[47:10] the name of Jesus. Father, may you move
[47:12] among us this weekend in a special way,
[47:14] Lord. Father, may the coals of fire come
[47:16] up off the altar touching the lips of
[47:18] your servants, Lord. Father, may the may
[47:21] the anointing that destroys the yoke of
[47:23] the enemy. Lord, may you come among us
[47:25] and be in great power and great
[47:27] authority. Father, we love you tonight,
[47:29] Lord. We thank you for the spirit that
[47:31] we feel among us, the atmosphere. Lord,
[47:33] we surrender this meeting and every song
[47:35] that'll be sung, every word that'll be
[47:37] said. Lord, we surrender it unto you
[47:39] that you could use it for your honor and
[47:41] your glory. and we'll be sure to give
[47:42] thee all the praise, all the honor, and
[47:44] all the glory. It's in the wonderful
[47:46] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[47:48] we pray. And all the believer says,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." God bless you tonight.
[47:55] Amen. His presence is in the building.
[47:57] Amen. In the in the tent tonight. If you
[47:59] have your Bibles while you're standing
[48:01] with us, we want to invite you to the
[48:02] book of Ephesians, the 6th chapter.
[48:05] While you're turning there tonight, we
[48:06] want to take this opportunity to greet
[48:08] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:09] Christ. It's the greatest name and the
[48:11] highest name that we could greet you in
[48:13] tonight. And we just want to say God
[48:14] bless you all and thank you all for amen
[48:17] being here tonight, the support. And
[48:18] Amen. How many is under great
[48:20] expectation?
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a real honor to be speaking
[48:23] here again under the tent. We thank
[48:24] brother Matt for this opportunity to
[48:26] speak to you tonight. And amen, thank
[48:28] the Lord for the opportunity to speak
[48:29] with these men of God this weekend. And
[48:31] amen, I know the devil's in trouble.
[48:33] Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we just have something here
[48:36] tonight on our heart that we pray will
[48:38] be a blessing to you in the book of
[48:40] Ephesians the 6th chapter. I want to
[48:42] look in the 10th verse and then also
[48:44] we're going to go to second Timothy 2
[48:46] beginning here in Ephesians 6 and verse
[48:49] 10. Paul here writing says, "Finally, my
[48:52] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[48:56] the power of his might. Put on the whole
[48:59] armor of God that you may be able to
[49:00] stand against the ws of the devil."
[49:03] Amen. Now,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the posture that he
[49:06] speaks of that ye may be able to stand
[49:09] against the ws of the devil. For we
[49:11] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[49:13] against principalities, against powers,
[49:16] against the rulers of the darkness of
[49:18] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[49:20] in high places. Now, wherefore take unto
[49:23] you the whole armor of God, that you may
[49:26] be able to withstand in the evil day.
[49:29] Brother Be said, that's this day. And
[49:32] having done all to stand. I love how
[49:34] Paul does not give the church another
[49:36] option. He says, "Stand therefore,
[49:39] having your loins girded about with
[49:41] truth, having on the breastplate of
[49:42] righteousness and your feet shaw with
[49:45] the preparation of the gospel of peace."
[49:47] Notice this. Above all, taking the
[49:49] shield of faith. Above all, taking the
[49:52] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[49:55] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[49:57] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[50:00] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[50:02] which is the word of God. Amen. Also in
[50:07] the book of second Timothy, the 4th
[50:08] chapter, the book of 2 Timothy chapter
[50:11] 4, I want to read there in 2 Timothy
[50:14] chapter 4 and verse or sorry, 2 Timothy
[50:17] chapter 2 and verse number one. We'll
[50:20] read down to verse number four. You love
[50:21] the Lord. Tonight,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Paul here writing to Timothy there in
[50:25] Ephesians 6, Paul is dressing the
[50:27] Christian soldier. And here in 2 Timothy
[50:30] 2 and one, he's speaking of the marks of
[50:32] a good soldier of the cross. He says,
[50:34] "Thou therefore, my son, be strong in
[50:37] the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And
[50:40] the things that thou has heard of me
[50:43] among many witnesses. The same commit
[50:45] thou to faithful men, who shall be able
[50:48] to teach others also. Now thou therefore
[50:51] endure hardness as a good soldier of
[50:54] Jesus Christ. No man that worth
[50:57] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[50:59] this life, that he may please him who
[51:02] hath chosen him to be a soldier. We ask
[51:06] Lord this evening to bless the reading
[51:07] of his word. as you can have your seat
[51:09] here this afternoon. If the Lord would
[51:10] help me uh from those verses of
[51:12] scripture tonight, if I would take a a
[51:15] title tonight, I want to speak to you on
[51:17] this for just a few moments here,
[51:19] standing strong in the battle of faith.
[51:22] Standing strong in the battle of faith.
[51:24] Brother Brandham would say in 1955, he
[51:27] says, "In this great faith battle, as
[51:29] I've tried to fight it, I've some awful
[51:31] obstacles, been over some rough roads.
[51:33] It shows on me." He says, "I have, but
[51:36] it's been the most blessed thing. I
[51:38] wouldn't trade it for nothing in the
[51:40] world." He said, "Here's my greatest
[51:42] victories, the greatest pleasures I have
[51:44] is when I come up against something and
[51:47] I cannot see over it. I cannot see
[51:49] around it. I cannot see under it." He
[51:52] said, "I just keep walking towards it,
[51:54] believing this, that God will make a way
[51:57] when I get there. All this distance I
[51:59] have come, I have trusted him, and he
[52:02] has never failed me." I wonder how many
[52:04] that would be your testimony tonight.
[52:06] Amen. Everything you've come up against
[52:09] when you didn't see a way over it, you
[52:11] didn't see a way under it, you didn't
[52:12] see a way around it. Amen. God made a
[52:15] way and you went right through it. Now,
[52:17] the prophet of God would say, "Oh, how
[52:19] Satan would desire." This is the devil's
[52:21] desire. Amen. Is to take us quickly from
[52:24] the scene. Amen. Right in the midst of
[52:26] the battle. So the devil's desire, amen,
[52:29] is to take you out of the battle. He
[52:32] said, "But the angels are encamped about
[52:34] those who fear him." And we're so
[52:36] thankful for this. He said, "I'm so glad
[52:38] for a fresh experience of knowing, amen,
[52:42] the reality of his promise." I I love
[52:44] that the prophet of God did not position
[52:46] us outside of the battle, but he
[52:49] positioned us in the middle of the
[52:51] battle. And he exposed the devil's
[52:53] desire, amen, that was to take us out of
[52:56] the battle because the devil knows,
[52:58] amen, that we're not quitters. Amen. The
[53:00] devil knows, amen, that we're not
[53:02] cowards. Amen. The devil knows that
[53:04] we're not just church members, but we're
[53:05] actually soldiers. Amen. We did not
[53:08] choose oursel. We did not call oursel.
[53:11] Amen. But God called us from before the
[53:13] foundation of the world. I think of how
[53:16] tonight that we're in a battle. And the
[53:17] the prophet of God would speak of it
[53:19] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[53:21] and he comes back and the first thing he
[53:23] says, amen, as he comes to the end of
[53:25] that that vision or that experience. He
[53:27] says, "All I could say is press the
[53:29] battle." Amen. Amen. All I could say was
[53:32] press the battle. And tonight, Amen. I
[53:34] know this might be the third or fourth
[53:36] year we've had these tent meetings. Or,
[53:37] Amen, it might be the fifth or sixth
[53:39] meeting you've been in this year. Amen.
[53:41] And I want to begin tonight by saying
[53:43] this is not the time, amen, to grow
[53:45] weary in the battle. Amen. This is not
[53:48] the time to back off of your confession.
[53:50] This is the time to press. Amen. With
[53:53] everything that's within you, amen.
[53:55] You've already been seen in the preview
[53:57] of the bride. Amen. Amen. The victory
[53:59] has already been prophesied over you.
[54:02] And a prophet said they were singing
[54:03] onward Christian soldiers. Amen. I
[54:06] believe if there's ever been a time,
[54:08] amen, to press the battle, now is the
[54:10] time to press it. The prophet of God
[54:12] said, "I once was an athlete myself. I I
[54:15] was a professional fighter." He said, "I
[54:17] used to come to these floors. We'd have
[54:19] our training. We would have our main
[54:20] fights and I've never left the ring."
[54:23] Amen. But I'm just in a different ring.
[54:25] Amen. I'm fighting the enemy. How many
[54:27] is fighting the enemy? Amen. Which is
[54:29] the devil. Amen. Of human souls tonight.
[54:32] And I'm asking your support. Amen. As we
[54:34] together put our hearts and our
[54:36] shoulders together to press, amen, this
[54:39] battle on. I wonder tonight how many
[54:41] would make a declaration. Amen. This is
[54:44] not just another meeting. Amen. This is
[54:46] not just another gathering. Amen. But
[54:48] it's another book of Acts where there in
[54:50] one accord. Amen. We're putting our
[54:52] shoulders together. We're joining our
[54:54] feet together. And we're going to press
[54:56] back against every devil of doubt. We're
[54:58] going to press back against every spirit
[55:00] of discouragement because we're not
[55:02] fighting for victory. We're fighting
[55:04] from victory. Amen. I'm asking your
[55:07] support. He said, "Amen. For God is with
[55:10] us." Amen. Amen. And who can be against
[55:12] us. He said, "The great morning star is
[55:15] over us." Amen. The banner of Christ and
[55:18] we're bound, amen, to conquer. Amen.
[55:21] There is no sickness tonight. There is
[55:23] no sin tonight. Amen. Those who are
[55:26] sick, those who are in sin, who are
[55:28] oppressed of the devil, we are his
[55:30] soldiers. We are the soldiers of his
[55:34] cross. Amen. I love that. Let's press
[55:36] the battle now. Amen. Amen. I think of
[55:39] how the prophet said when I went out
[55:40] there to join the military, he said the
[55:42] United States Army didn't receive me.
[55:45] Amen. Because I suppose there were men
[55:47] more eligible. He said, "But I'm glad
[55:49] that I got enlisted in the army of the
[55:51] Lord." Now listen, he didn't just enlist
[55:54] you, but he gave you a uniform.
[55:57] Amen. Then I can tell you tonight, now
[56:00] is the time, amen, to take on the whole
[56:02] armor of God that you may be able to
[56:05] stand in the evil day. You all know
[56:08] tonight that we are in the greatest
[56:10] battle that has ever been fought. I
[56:12] believe I can say that we're in the
[56:13] hottest part, amen, of the greatest
[56:16] battle that has ever been fought.
[56:18] Prophet of God said, I believe the
[56:19] greatest battle was ever fought is now
[56:21] 1962. Amen. Ready to go into action. He
[56:25] said, "I believe that God has been
[56:27] selecting his soldiers. I believe he has
[56:29] been dressing them and he has been
[56:32] training them." He said, "This first
[56:34] battle was ever fought began in heaven."
[56:36] Amen. When Michael and his angels fought
[56:38] against Lucifer, Amen. It first started
[56:41] in heaven. He said, "And then it was
[56:43] thrown down from heaven. He was cast out
[56:45] of heaven to the earth." Amen. And fell
[56:48] on human beings. He said, "Then the
[56:50] battle from angels become human
[56:52] battles." Amen. Then Satan come, amen,
[56:55] the devil come to destroy, Amen, God's
[56:58] creation, what God had created to be for
[57:02] himself. Listen, you were not created to
[57:05] be depressed. You were not created to be
[57:07] bound. You were not created to be
[57:09] nervous. You were not created to be
[57:12] discouraged. You were created to be a
[57:14] manifestation of the dominion of
[57:16] almighty God. And the devil is doing
[57:19] everything he can. Amen. But I want to
[57:21] tell that devil tonight, there's some
[57:23] soldiers in the house of God tonight.
[57:26] They're not a bunch of church members.
[57:28] They are selected soldiers. They are
[57:30] chosen soldiers and they're ready to
[57:32] draw their swords. They're ready to
[57:34] fight back against everything the devil
[57:36] is trying to use to destroy them. Yes,
[57:39] sir. He had Satan come, Amen, to destroy
[57:42] this. He said that's what his purpose
[57:44] was was to destroy it. He said then the
[57:47] battle began here on earth. Listen, it
[57:50] began in us and it has been raging ever
[57:53] since. Now, amen. Daniel comes along in
[57:56] Daniel chapter 7 and he begins to speak
[57:58] of this hour when the devil, Satan,
[58:01] would begin to press against the saints
[58:03] of the most high. He said, "They shall
[58:05] speak great words against the most
[58:07] high." Listen. and shall wear out the
[58:10] saints of the most high and think to
[58:13] change the times and laws and they shall
[58:15] be given into his hand until a time in
[58:19] times and the dividing of times. Amen. I
[58:21] love that definition there of the wear
[58:23] out the saints. You know what it means?
[58:25] It means to harass constantly. And then
[58:28] that's what the devil's trying to do is
[58:31] he's trying to harass you. Amen.
[58:33] Constantly. Listen, he don't just harass
[58:35] you on Sunday. He don't just harass you
[58:38] on Wednesday. Amen. But he harasses you
[58:40] 24/7, 365 days a year. Amen. Because he
[58:45] knows that you did not put yourself in
[58:48] this battle. But God chose you from
[58:50] before the foundation of the world to
[58:53] stand in the great battle of faith and
[58:56] to stand as an overcomer. Yes, sir. He
[58:59] shall wear out the saints. Hey, this is
[59:01] I read this in a Bible commentary. It's
[59:03] not of authority, so take it or leave
[59:04] it. Amen. They shall wear out the
[59:06] saints. Amen. By wars and massacres and
[59:09] inquisitions, amen, persecuting and
[59:12] destroying the faithful servants of
[59:14] Jesus and the true worshippers of God
[59:17] who protect or rather they protest.
[59:19] Amen. Against his innovations and they
[59:22] refuse to comply with the idolatry
[59:25] practiced in the court of Rome. Amen.
[59:27] Instead of wear out, Amen. One
[59:30] translation reads, "Amen. lie and wait
[59:32] for or form schemes or deceit against.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; He shall think to change times and laws,
[59:41] appointing fast and feast, canonizing
[59:44] saints, granting pardons and indulgences
[59:47] for sin. Listen, I love this one.
[59:49] Instituting new modes of worship. Amen.
[59:52] Imposing new articles of faith and
[59:55] enjoying new rules of practice. Amen.
[59:58] When the devil begins to harass you, he
[1:00:00] does it by first of all instituting,
[1:00:03] amen, a new model of worship and a new
[1:00:05] model of praise. And then he begins to
[1:00:08] impose new articles of faith. And then
[1:00:10] he begins to enjoin, amen, in his
[1:00:13] scheme, amen, the rules of practice. And
[1:00:16] then begins to reverse at pleasure,
[1:00:18] amen, the laws of God and the laws of
[1:00:21] man. Well, if I was a devil, I would try
[1:00:24] to take your place, too. Amen. because
[1:00:26] that devil knows. Amen. This religion
[1:00:29] that we're a part of is not a new
[1:00:31] religion. It's the oldest religion
[1:00:33] there's ever been. It's called that
[1:00:35] oldfashioned shout religion. You say,
[1:00:37] "When did it begin?" Amen. From before
[1:00:40] the foundation of the world when the
[1:00:43] sons of God were shouting for joy. Well,
[1:00:46] I think it's time, amen, to go to war
[1:00:48] tonight. If that devil's taken your
[1:00:50] praise, if that devil's taken your
[1:00:52] worship, if that devil's taken your
[1:00:54] liberty, amen, to enjoy the anointing
[1:00:57] and to receive the blessings of God, I
[1:01:00] say tonight is a good night to say,
[1:01:02] devil, you will not have my praise one
[1:01:05] second longer. I got a sword in my hand.
[1:01:08] I got a shield in front of me. I got my
[1:01:11] feet shot with the preparation of the
[1:01:13] gospel. I'm taking back everything that
[1:01:16] the devil stole from me. You stole my
[1:01:18] joy, I'm taking it back. You stole my
[1:01:21] peace, I'm taking it back. You stole my
[1:01:24] liberty, I'm taking it back. You've
[1:01:26] harassed me your last day.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Paul would say it like
[1:01:32] this. He would say, "There's a messenger
[1:01:34] of Satan." Amen. To buffet me. Brother B
[1:01:38] said, "What does that word buffet mean?"
[1:01:40] It means blow after blow. Oh, you all
[1:01:43] know what I'm talking about there. Amen.
[1:01:45] Can I get a witness here tonight? blow
[1:01:48] after blow after blow after blow after
[1:01:54] blow. But if the devil can give them, I
[1:01:57] think we can give them back.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I think if the devil can give blow after
[1:02:02] blow after blow after trouble after
[1:02:06] trouble, I think we got a right tonight
[1:02:08] to start giving him back blow after blow
[1:02:11] after blow. Brother said, "It's like the
[1:02:14] ship on the sea. The waves are buffing
[1:02:16] it." See? Amen. Blow after blow. And he
[1:02:19] would he'd get better and then he would
[1:02:21] have it again. Then he'd get better and
[1:02:23] he would have it again. Finally, he
[1:02:24] said, "Lord, what's the matter? You
[1:02:27] don't take this away from me." Amen. But
[1:02:29] right there in the middle of the battle,
[1:02:32] there was a voice spoke to him and said,
[1:02:34] "My grace is sufficient for thee, Paul.
[1:02:37] Oh, church of the living God, I feel
[1:02:39] like shouting right now." Some of us are
[1:02:41] in the greatest battles that we've ever
[1:02:43] been in in our lives. But I heard the
[1:02:45] voice of the Lord say, "My grace is
[1:02:48] sufficient for thee. I know it may look
[1:02:51] dark. I know it may look unbelieving,
[1:02:53] but I know there's a grace here tonight
[1:02:55] that can reach into your heart."
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Peter warns us of this
[1:03:00] adversary. He said, "Be sober, brother
[1:03:03] Joel." He said, "Be vigilant." He said,
[1:03:05] "Because your adversary, which is the
[1:03:08] devil, is as a roaring lion, and he's
[1:03:11] walking about seeking whom he may
[1:03:14] devour." You know what a prophet said?
[1:03:16] He said, "The hour is pressing. The
[1:03:18] darkness is settling. The end time is
[1:03:21] here." He said, "See the presence of the
[1:03:23] enemy." Amen. The shaking, the feeling,
[1:03:26] the nervous condition. Amen. A prophet
[1:03:29] described the hour we're living in.
[1:03:32] Never been a time like this time where
[1:03:34] there's so much nervousness.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. Y'all know I'm telling the
[1:03:38] truth. Amen. Nervousness and and
[1:03:40] depression and anxiety and and worry and
[1:03:44] turmoil. Amen. See, brother B said, not
[1:03:46] knowing it's the devil. But thank God he
[1:03:49] didn't leave us in the dark. He said,
[1:03:51] here's why it's happening. Because the
[1:03:53] lid has come off of hell and there's
[1:03:56] demon power streaming in from
[1:03:58] everywhere. Listen, they've conquered
[1:04:01] the nations. They have conquered
[1:04:02] politics. They have conquered, amen, the
[1:04:05] churches until they know nothing but
[1:04:07] denomination. Oh, but a prophet said it
[1:04:09] like this. He said that great
[1:04:11] Pentecostal revival is now ceasing. We
[1:04:14] see it everywhere. The last great move.
[1:04:16] He said, "The message has went forth.
[1:04:18] Everything's ready now. The church is
[1:04:21] sealed away. The wicked are doing more
[1:04:23] wicked. The churches are becoming more
[1:04:25] churchy. But the saints are coming
[1:04:27] closer to God. I don't know where you
[1:04:30] identify yourself. Maybe you identify
[1:04:32] yourself in the church. Maybe you
[1:04:34] identify yourself in the wicked. But I
[1:04:36] heard a voice out of heaven say, "Come
[1:04:39] out of her, my people." It was a voice
[1:04:42] of election. It was a voice of
[1:04:44] predestination. And that voice chose me
[1:04:46] from before the foundation of the world
[1:04:49] to stand in this great faith battle.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Paul said it like
[1:04:56] this. He said, "The gospel has many
[1:04:58] leanings." Brother said, "Oh, you can
[1:04:59] liken it under one thing or another." He
[1:05:01] said, "But in Ephesians 6," Amen. Paul
[1:05:04] begin to liken it under the gar, the
[1:05:06] armor of a soldier. He said, as he's
[1:05:09] speaking here, amen, he's armoring the
[1:05:11] men, amen, to go into battle. He said,
[1:05:13] "Now I want to take for a text." Amen.
[1:05:16] To take on the whole armor of God. Be
[1:05:20] equipped.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Be ready. God's enemy principalities and
[1:05:26] wickedness and evil spirits and
[1:05:28] wickedness in high places and we're
[1:05:30] pressing towards the mark of the high
[1:05:33] calling and we are certainly in a
[1:05:35] battle. Now I love how a prophet says it
[1:05:37] that no nation is going to send an
[1:05:40] untrained man on the field. He said no.
[1:05:43] He said he might get himself or the
[1:05:46] whole group killed. Amen. Now I love it
[1:05:48] because in a national battle the prophet
[1:05:50] of God said what the enemy does is he
[1:05:53] drops down into a spy system. He said
[1:05:55] yeah. He said kind of like England will
[1:05:57] send spies over here or the USA will
[1:06:00] send spies into another country. You
[1:06:03] know Paul picked that up in Galatians 2
[1:06:05] and he said they because of false
[1:06:07] brethren and wares.
[1:06:09] They were brought in, see who came in
[1:06:12] privately to spy out our liberty which
[1:06:15] we have in Christ Jesus that they might
[1:06:18] bring us into bondage. Re said, "Oh,
[1:06:21] they're watching to see what kind of a
[1:06:23] new weapon that we'll come up with and
[1:06:26] then they take that back to their own
[1:06:28] country and find something to counteract
[1:06:30] that weapon." He said, "That'll get a
[1:06:32] little bit better." He said, "Now,
[1:06:34] that's the way the spies work over
[1:06:36] there. They work their way into the
[1:06:38] nation in some kind of a tactic to get
[1:06:41] through the councils and so forth. He
[1:06:43] said they have to have a way to work
[1:06:46] their yourself in there. He said
[1:06:47] communism had to do the same thing. Let
[1:06:50] me just tell you all this. Satan is not
[1:06:52] all knowing. He is not an omnisient God.
[1:06:56] He is not an omnipotent God. He is not
[1:06:58] an omnipresent God. Amen. Let me begin
[1:07:01] tonight by humiliating him and saying he
[1:07:03] is a limited devil.
[1:07:06] He's a limited devil. He's a limited
[1:07:09] foe. Brother said, "The whole world is
[1:07:11] controlled by Satan. Every kingdom in
[1:07:13] the world is ruled by Satan." We hate to
[1:07:16] think that, but that's the scripture.
[1:07:17] You know, the enemy taken our Lord up
[1:07:20] into a high place. Amen. Exceeding
[1:07:22] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[1:07:24] of the world. Here's what the devil
[1:07:25] said. They're all mine. Amen. I'm the
[1:07:28] ruler of them. I do with them whatever I
[1:07:31] want to and I'll give them to you. Now,
[1:07:34] watch a prophet. But watch the wisdom of
[1:07:37] our Lord Jesus staying with the word of
[1:07:39] God. He knew he would fall heir to them
[1:07:42] in the kingdom in the kingdom in the
[1:07:45] millennium. So you know what he said? He
[1:07:47] said, "Get thee, hence Satan." Well,
[1:07:50] glory to God. That devil's trying to buy
[1:07:53] you out of a miracle. He's trying to buy
[1:07:55] you out of a position. He's trying to
[1:07:57] buy you out of a breakthrough. He's
[1:07:59] trying to buy you out of a healing. He's
[1:08:01] trying to buy you out of a deliverance.
[1:08:03] But I think it's time tonight somebody
[1:08:04] look that devil in the face and say the
[1:08:06] same thing. Our Lord Jesus said, "Satan,
[1:08:09] get thee behind me in the name of Jesus
[1:08:12] Christ."
[1:08:15] Hallelujah. You said, "Preacher, how can
[1:08:17] you say that?" Because we're soldiers,
[1:08:19] Brother Brian. We're Holy Ghost filled.
[1:08:22] Amen. Chosen soldiers. Listen. And we're
[1:08:24] under divine instruction. Our general
[1:08:27] has given us instruction. You know what
[1:08:30] that instruction is? resist the devil.
[1:08:33] I tell you right now, the devil wouldn't
[1:08:35] be this far in the service with some of
[1:08:37] you if you'd resist him five minutes
[1:08:39] ago. He wouldn't still be sitting on
[1:08:41] your shoulder if you would have resisted
[1:08:43] him when something didn't go the way you
[1:08:44] thought it ought to win. Somebody didn't
[1:08:46] shake your hand or somebody give you an
[1:08:48] odd look. Hey, I think it's time, amen,
[1:08:50] to resist that devil. Hallelujah. I
[1:08:54] think it's time to resist that devil and
[1:08:56] say, Devil, this is our meeting. This is
[1:08:58] our meeting. We did not come here to
[1:09:01] play with you. We did not come here to
[1:09:03] do deals with you. We come here as
[1:09:05] soldiers to whip you from one end of
[1:09:07] this tent to the other end of this tent.
[1:09:11] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:09:14] you.
[1:09:17] You say resist. You know what that
[1:09:19] means? That means to set oneself
[1:09:21] against.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; It means to withstand.
[1:09:27] It means to resist brother Ben. It means
[1:09:31] to oppose.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; My brother said now to resist is to just
[1:09:36] simply turn him down. Just resist him.
[1:09:39] That is just walk away from it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Now folks, I'm not a very deep man. Her
[1:09:45] very smart. But I have a Bible and my
[1:09:48] Bible says footsteps means possession.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; My Bible says footsteps means
[1:09:55] possession. Then that means when you
[1:09:57] begin to walk
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; away from the devil that's trying to
[1:10:01] control you, you're whipping that devil
[1:10:04] because footsteps means possession. Just
[1:10:08] simply walk away from him. God said a
[1:10:11] certain thing no matter what that
[1:10:12] devil's trying to tell you. Don't you
[1:10:15] even listen to him. Your ears are deaf
[1:10:17] to anything else but what the spirit
[1:10:20] says. Amen. Can I pile some up on the
[1:10:22] devil tonight? Remember the word of God
[1:10:25] will defeat Satan anywhere, anytime.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It is written, brother
[1:10:32] Jonathan. It is written." Well, that
[1:10:34] settles it. Satan will have to flee. He
[1:10:37] said, "The weakest of Christian." Amen.
[1:10:39] I'm going to take your excuse away.
[1:10:41] Okay? You said, "Well, preacher, I'm the
[1:10:43] weakest Christian in the building."
[1:10:44] Thank you for being here tonight because
[1:10:46] you're still in dominion over the devil
[1:10:49] when you're underneath this word.
[1:10:53] You say, "I barely crawled in this
[1:10:55] tent." Well, thank you for crawling, but
[1:10:58] you're still here and you're still over
[1:11:00] the devil because you're a part of the
[1:11:03] word of almighty God. You have been
[1:11:05] chosen to be a soldier.
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, I'm the
[1:11:11] weakest Christian. He said, "Well,
[1:11:12] you're the weakest Christian here
[1:11:14] tonight. Can defeat Satan anywhere, any
[1:11:17] place, any time, under any conditions."
[1:11:21] Are y'all hearing me tonight? There is
[1:11:23] not a condition the devil can put upon
[1:11:26] this bride that will bind her from
[1:11:29] defeating that devil.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; He said that's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; If it's in the belly of a whale,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; if it's in a lion's den,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; if it's on the bed with a cancer, if
[1:11:43] it's laying yonder, bleeding to death in
[1:11:45] an automobile accident, the word of God
[1:11:47] will defeat Satan anywhere.
[1:11:52] And the weakest of Christian can use it.
[1:11:54] It's God's privilege to you to do so.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Andrew, I need a
[1:12:00] breakthrough. You got the word. Believe
[1:12:02] the word.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our enemy tonight has one
[1:12:07] goal, and that is to destroy life. Jesus
[1:12:10] said, "The enemy has come, the thief,
[1:12:12] but for to steal and to kill and to
[1:12:15] destroy." He said, "But I am come that
[1:12:18] they might have life." Brother David
[1:12:21] Paul, "And that they might have it more
[1:12:23] abundantly." I love what a prophet said.
[1:12:25] He said, "You can have life only through
[1:12:27] Christ." And now what does his word do?
[1:12:31] It builds up our spiritual body strong
[1:12:35] as we commune with him to resist the
[1:12:38] devil. Come on, church. If you don't
[1:12:41] take your vitamins, you ain't going to
[1:12:42] have an immune system. And if you don't
[1:12:44] feed on this message, you ain't going to
[1:12:46] have no strength to resist that devil. I
[1:12:49] tell you what, we ought to Well, they
[1:12:51] make fun of me. I might as well preach.
[1:12:53] We're the greatest generation that's
[1:12:55] ever hit the face of the earth because
[1:12:57] we're not feeding on the mind of a man.
[1:12:59] We're feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:13:02] of the Son of Man and by one scripture
[1:13:04] and by one tape and by one word. We're
[1:13:07] getting stronger. We're getting
[1:13:09] stronger. Well, I might as well start
[1:13:11] off testifying tonight. I say I'm
[1:13:13] stronger than I've ever been before. I
[1:13:16] got more battles, Brother Wayne, than
[1:13:18] I've ever had before. But the word has
[1:13:21] found a way into my life, and it's
[1:13:23] working effectually.
[1:13:26] Don't you let some devil rob you out of
[1:13:28] the blessings of God. Why don't you go
[1:13:30] ahead and confess right now, he is my
[1:13:32] strength. The word is my strength.
[1:13:37] You're not weak, you're strong. Prophet
[1:13:40] of God said, it's Satan. It's just the
[1:13:42] devil. You know what he's trying to do?
[1:13:44] He's trying to tear you down. He don't
[1:13:47] want you communing with God.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Because when you're communing with God,
[1:13:52] you're resisting him.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; When you're communing with God, you're
[1:13:59] resisting the devil.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I want to preach there for two hours,
[1:14:03] but I can't. When you're communing with
[1:14:06] this word, it's putting strength in you
[1:14:09] to resist the devil.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "If Satan tries to
[1:14:15] hand you some sickness or tries to hand
[1:14:17] you something, you know what to do. Show
[1:14:20] him your token. Sure, sickness strikes
[1:14:22] the Christian, but show him your token
[1:14:25] and prove to him that you are a
[1:14:27] purchased product of God. Resist the
[1:14:30] devil and he will flee from you." Are
[1:14:33] you ready for this? Hold the token over
[1:14:36] your unmovable faith in his promised
[1:14:40] word,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; church of the living God. Well, I need a
[1:14:43] miracle. Hold your token over the
[1:14:46] promised word with unmovable faith.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We do not fight with carnal
[1:14:53] weapons.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; The weapons of our warfare are not
[1:14:58] carnal,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; but they're mighty through God. to the
[1:15:03] pulling down of strongholds. I love what
[1:15:06] a prophet said. He said, "We're longing
[1:15:08] for somewhere where there's no death,
[1:15:10] where there's no sorrow, where there's
[1:15:12] no heartaches." How many's longing for
[1:15:14] that place? Where there's no old age. He
[1:15:17] said, "The land is somewhere." And we'll
[1:15:20] never be able to achieve it by guns and
[1:15:23] fighting and so forth of the natural
[1:15:25] carnal weapon. But there is a land that
[1:15:28] we go to and it's a battle to get there.
[1:15:32] He said, "Now when God gave Israel
[1:15:33] Palestine, when he was in Egypt, but
[1:15:36] they had to fight for every inch of it,
[1:15:38] he said to Joshua, wherever the souls of
[1:15:41] your foot treads upon that I have given
[1:15:43] you, so footprints means possession.
[1:15:46] Just keep walking, pressing on, and
[1:15:49] every time you make a step in the
[1:15:52] kingdom of God, that is yours."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Every time you make a step in the
[1:15:58] kingdom of God, that is yours. And all
[1:16:01] things are possible that's given. And
[1:16:04] all things are given that's possible.
[1:16:07] Glory to God. But it's a battle. Amen.
[1:16:10] All things are possible that's given.
[1:16:13] And all things that's given are
[1:16:14] possible, but it's a battle. Amen. I
[1:16:17] love what the prophet of God said. He
[1:16:19] said from the First World War until now,
[1:16:21] he said, "There's been advancement in
[1:16:23] weapon making." Amen. In World War I, if
[1:16:26] you would take that weapon out today,
[1:16:28] Amen. that weapon would be obsolete. He
[1:16:30] said, "See what they're doing is they're
[1:16:32] always trying to get something better,
[1:16:34] amen, to combat the enemy with." He
[1:16:37] said, "The Christian church is an army
[1:16:39] of God. We are soldiers of the cross."
[1:16:42] And it is the business of every nation.
[1:16:45] Amen. To see that their soldiers has the
[1:16:47] best that there is. Amen. So when God
[1:16:51] chose, Amen, you as a soldier, amen, he
[1:16:54] chose to give you the best weapon he
[1:16:56] could. He said, and he chose it, and it
[1:16:59] was his word. God gave his army the best
[1:17:02] equipment that it could ever use. Would
[1:17:04] never have to be changed. He's never
[1:17:06] changed it since. You don't have to
[1:17:08] improve it. It remains the same all the
[1:17:10] time. It's God's word that he fortified
[1:17:14] his people with. Now, the enemy knowed
[1:17:17] as long as the human race stayed with
[1:17:19] that word, he would never be able to
[1:17:22] touch them.
[1:17:24] Oh, he said, "I'm beginning to feel
[1:17:26] religious right now. As long as the
[1:17:28] human race, Amen, stayed with the word."
[1:17:32] He said, "God fortified his family on
[1:17:34] the earth, his army in the fort of his
[1:17:36] word." He said, "That's our fortress."
[1:17:38] See, the name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:17:40] tower, and the righteous run into it and
[1:17:43] are safe. He said, "The Lord is the
[1:17:46] word."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; I love that. They are in there fortified
[1:17:50] and saved forever more. As long as the
[1:17:53] human race stays in the word and as long
[1:17:56] as the church will stay in the word,
[1:17:58] it's fortified. There's nothing going to
[1:18:01] bother it. Okay. So, let me ask you
[1:18:03] then, how did the devil get into the
[1:18:05] human race? Because it don't take a
[1:18:07] genius to know the devil somewhere found
[1:18:10] a way to get into the human race. You
[1:18:13] know what a prophet said? He said, "By
[1:18:15] the way of reasoning. That's right.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; He said he used reasoning against faith
[1:18:21] and he said Satan come to Eve and he
[1:18:23] began to reason against the word of God
[1:18:26] which was the great armor that God had
[1:18:28] fortified his people with. He said oh
[1:18:31] remember friends that's Satan's tactic
[1:18:33] to begin with and he still uses the same
[1:18:36] thing and he is still successful with
[1:18:39] it. Reasoning. Well, I don't know about
[1:18:42] you, but I think tonight would be a good
[1:18:44] night to cast the devil of reasoning out
[1:18:46] of the tent.
[1:18:49] I think it would be a good night to cast
[1:18:51] the devil of reasoning out of your
[1:18:54] family. Cast the demon of reason out of
[1:18:56] your home. Cast that demon of reasoning.
[1:18:58] Listen, you've reasoned things till you
[1:19:00] about gone insane. Amen. But why don't
[1:19:02] you climb off the tree of reason and
[1:19:04] step over on the tree of faith? Listen,
[1:19:07] the tree of knowledge is limited, but
[1:19:09] the tree of faith is unlimited.
[1:19:12] Prophet of God said, "Reasoning against
[1:19:14] what God said." Amen. I'm going to just
[1:19:16] go ahead and preach since we're here
[1:19:17] tonight. That's the That's the reason.
[1:19:19] He said, "Why?" Now, here's what they
[1:19:20] say. Why would we need the Holy Ghost
[1:19:23] today? Y'all ever heard that reason?
[1:19:26] Amen. Why would we need the Holy Ghost
[1:19:28] today?
[1:19:30] I'm going to give you my my real
[1:19:31] political answer. Are you ready for it?
[1:19:33] because people are hellbound without it.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to I told y'all a few
[1:19:41] weeks ago, we're putting too much
[1:19:42] pressure on people expecting too much
[1:19:44] that just don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Well, they shouldn't go there and they
[1:19:50] I'm preaching and they shouldn't do this
[1:19:52] and they shouldn't do Amen. Well, give
[1:19:54] them a little break. They ain't got the
[1:19:55] Holy Ghost. Because if you had the Holy
[1:19:58] Ghost, you wouldn't be going there and
[1:20:00] you wouldn't be doing that and you
[1:20:01] wouldn't be Oh, I'm preaching now. You
[1:20:04] wouldn't be in those things because
[1:20:06] there would be something on the inside
[1:20:07] of you that would be releasing a
[1:20:09] strength in you to withstand the ws of
[1:20:12] the devil in the evil day you're living
[1:20:14] in. Oh, you say, "I ain't got the Holy
[1:20:17] Ghost." Well, I'm going to put my
[1:20:18] shouting shoes on. You say, "Why?" Cuz
[1:20:20] you're in a good place to get it. If you
[1:20:23] don't have the Holy Ghost, there ain't
[1:20:25] no better place to die than in a tent
[1:20:27] where there's grass on the floor. You
[1:20:29] can snot your nose off. You can cry your
[1:20:32] eyes out, but when you get up, you can
[1:20:34] leave changed by the dynamics of
[1:20:36] Almighty God. I still believe in the
[1:20:39] power of the Holy Ghost transforming the
[1:20:42] life of an individual.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We need the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You ready for another reason the devil
[1:20:51] gives
[1:20:52] Why would we need divine healing?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Y'all ready for my my
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; polished up political answer?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz people sick.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And they weren't born to be sick. They
[1:21:06] weren't created to be sick. They weren't
[1:21:08] born to be in that condition. They were
[1:21:10] born to be in dominion over that
[1:21:12] condition.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Healing is the children's bread.
[1:21:19] Why would we need another Pentecost?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I love this one.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; We're all civilized.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Brother said they were too.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But you see, if whatever it taken to
[1:21:31] begin with, whatever God give them to
[1:21:34] begin with, that's what it ever remains.
[1:21:36] And the tactics of reasoning is what
[1:21:39] Satan used. And that's what he ever uses
[1:21:41] is reasoning. But we know our enemy.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Now, brethren, let me say this. Any
[1:21:46] person, any church, any organization,
[1:21:49] any individual that reasons against one
[1:21:52] punctuation of God's word is your enemy.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll quit reasoning with that
[1:22:00] enemy and start communing with God,
[1:22:02] you'd have some strength about you.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Brother Wayne said,
[1:22:08] "It takes the word to defeat the enemy."
[1:22:11] That's what Jesus said there in Matthew
[1:22:13] 4. Do you all realize Jesus was the word
[1:22:16] made flesh? He was God in flesh. He was
[1:22:19] the manifestation of the word. Listen
[1:22:22] here. He said, "But he stood there and
[1:22:25] he never used his power." Brother Danny,
[1:22:28] he never stood there and used his power
[1:22:30] to whip his enemy. He used the same
[1:22:33] thing that he left you in a tent meeting
[1:22:36] in 2025 to use. He used the word. You
[1:22:40] know what he said? He said, "That's the
[1:22:42] original artillery."
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I feel like
[1:22:46] shouting. That's the original artillery
[1:22:50] is the word of God. He said, "And what
[1:22:52] Eve lost, Amen. Christ has regained
[1:22:55] where Eve let down." Amen. Christ has
[1:22:58] fortified again. Oh, stay with the
[1:23:00] original artillery. There's people today
[1:23:02] who can almost reason you right down and
[1:23:05] prove to you that the thing is wrong.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. There's people today with
[1:23:10] reason, intellectual powers, they can
[1:23:12] reason you down to a spot that they can
[1:23:14] almost convince you that what you're
[1:23:17] believing is wrong. He said Satan was
[1:23:19] very successful with Eve. He said, "What
[1:23:21] does reasoning do? It makes it more
[1:23:24] appealing." Well, the devil starts
[1:23:27] reasoning and the first thing he does is
[1:23:30] start making things more appealing.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; An altar is not appealing, but it's the
[1:23:36] original artillery.
[1:23:39] Dying out to yourself is not very
[1:23:41] appealing, but it's the original
[1:23:44] artillery.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. When you're depressed,
[1:23:48] raising your hands in the middle of
[1:23:50] service and saying, "Glory to God.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah. Thank you."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Hey, I tell you
[1:23:57] right now, you won't stay depressed.
[1:23:58] Praising God.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You won't stay discouraged. Praising
[1:24:03] God. You won't stay all wadded up.
[1:24:05] Praising God. You won't stay under the h
[1:24:08] under the mulligrs praising God when you
[1:24:10] begin to praise God. Blessings begin to
[1:24:13] come down. Oh, I would tonight that we
[1:24:15] would raise the roof off of this tent
[1:24:17] this weekend with praises and hallelujah
[1:24:20] and glory to God. You say, "Preacher, we
[1:24:22] need to quieten it down." I think,
[1:24:24] brother Matt, we need to crank it up 10
[1:24:25] more notches and let the praises and the
[1:24:28] glory and the power and the worship and
[1:24:32] the honor and majesty go unto the one
[1:24:34] who deserves all of it.
[1:24:38] You say, "Preacher, I'm waiting on
[1:24:39] things to change before I praise."
[1:24:41] Sometimes you got to praise God. And
[1:24:43] while you're praising God, things
[1:24:44] change.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. I know it's not
[1:24:50] appealing. Probably God said, "Where
[1:24:51] there is the cry to make religion so
[1:24:53] attractive."
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. And appealing.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; That's the rich
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; and cultured. and all who have worldly
[1:25:03] prestige will come in
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; and be active in the church.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Prophet God said, "Did not the Holy
[1:25:12] Ghost tell us in 2 Timothy 3 in the last
[1:25:15] days would be an intellectual group in
[1:25:16] the church?"
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. He said, "Well, you
[1:25:21] say that's communist." Oh, no. That's
[1:25:23] them so-called Christians
[1:25:25] having a form of godliness, Brother
[1:25:27] Brian, but denying the power thereof. He
[1:25:30] said, "And the power is the word made
[1:25:32] manifest. The power through
[1:25:34] demonstration of the spirit." Listen,
[1:25:36] God has overshadowed you, church. The
[1:25:39] same power of God that come upon a
[1:25:41] Virgin Mary, the prophet of God said the
[1:25:43] Holy Ghost overshadowed her. He said it
[1:25:45] was the power of the highest and it was
[1:25:48] prophesied to return to the church and
[1:25:51] overshadow you. You know what that word
[1:25:53] overshadow means? It is used of the Holy
[1:25:56] Spirit which is exerting creative energy
[1:25:59] upon the womb of the Virgin Mary and
[1:26:01] impregnating it. Amen. A use of the word
[1:26:04] which we seem to have been drawn from
[1:26:05] the familiar Old Testament idea of a
[1:26:08] cloud as a symbolizing the immediate
[1:26:11] presence and the power of God. Oh, I
[1:26:14] wish I had that picture tonight. There
[1:26:16] has been a cloud of Revelation 10:1 that
[1:26:19] has returned in these last days. Listen
[1:26:22] folks, it ain't hanging over the Baptist
[1:26:24] church. It ain't hanging over the
[1:26:25] Pentecostal church. It ain't hanging
[1:26:27] over the local charismatic church. But
[1:26:29] out here in a field in the backwoods of
[1:26:32] Arkansas is the mighty angel. And he's
[1:26:35] descended and he's hovering over this
[1:26:37] building. Oh, he's want to do more than
[1:26:39] make you feel better. He's want to do
[1:26:41] more than make you get a little
[1:26:42] sensation. He's wanting to charge you
[1:26:45] from the inside to the outside with the
[1:26:47] dynamics of his power. Oh, I believe
[1:26:49] there's healing in the cloud. I believe
[1:26:52] there's miracles in the cloud. I believe
[1:26:54] there's deliverance in the cloud. Hey,
[1:26:56] and I can say to you tonight that cloud
[1:26:58] is in this room.
[1:27:02] Pro said, "Oh yeah." He said, "Listen,
[1:27:04] what happens?" He said, "The power of
[1:27:06] God comes." He said, "God don't have to
[1:27:08] do anything to make his word more
[1:27:09] appealing. When the enemy comes like a
[1:27:11] flood,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord
[1:27:18] shall raise up
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; a standard against him.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it. Brother said, "What does
[1:27:26] he do?" He takes the same word,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; that he's already said,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; brother David, and he makes it more
[1:27:36] positive.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it to you tonight?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; The more positive you become, the more
[1:27:44] stronger you become.
[1:27:48] The more positive you become, the more
[1:27:51] stronger you become. Now you say,
[1:27:52] "Preacher, you got us out here in this
[1:27:54] great faith battle and there's a there's
[1:27:57] a lot going on." Well, there is giants
[1:27:59] in the land,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; brother. So, whenever God's army goes
[1:28:03] paraphrasing to possess their
[1:28:05] inheritance, there's always going to be
[1:28:07] giants in the way.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Andrew, I'm waiting maybe
[1:28:10] tomorrow night or maybe Friday night or
[1:28:13] if
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; not by Friday, maybe Saturday. And if
[1:28:16] not by Saturday, maybe Sunday morning
[1:28:18] there won't be no giants. And
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; oh, if you wait till then, the devil
[1:28:21] will put as more giants as he can in
[1:28:23] your way.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But you know what the Bible said? The
[1:28:26] Bible said when you go among them, do
[1:28:28] not meddle with them.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; For I will not give thee the land of the
[1:28:32] children of lamb and any possession
[1:28:34] because I've given the children of Lot
[1:28:36] for a possession. Listen, it's a land of
[1:28:38] giants dwelling there. Now watch what a
[1:28:40] prophet said. He said, "As it was in the
[1:28:42] days of Noah, there was giants in the
[1:28:44] land. And so Satan also has his
[1:28:48] intellectual giants in the land today."
[1:28:51] Oh, they're DD and PHL. Oh, my
[1:28:54] intellectual giants. He said, "In some,
[1:28:56] now watch this. Somehow or another,
[1:28:59] those intellectual giants become spies."
[1:29:01] Come on.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "And now, forgive me in
[1:29:05] lecture, brother, but it's a spy system
[1:29:08] that sits out among you to take out the
[1:29:10] sheep and then say, "Why? That's holy
[1:29:13] rollers, isn't it?"
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like when the preachers
[1:29:17] always preaching against people, being
[1:29:19] critical of the move of God. They're
[1:29:20] exposing spies.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Because when those spies get a
[1:29:24] stronghold in the atmosphere, then they
[1:29:26] begin to reason. And everybody that
[1:29:28] shouts becomes, "I'm sorry. or I'm just
[1:29:31] going to preach. I remember when I've
[1:29:33] seen people shout and dance in the
[1:29:34] presence of God and then a few years
[1:29:36] later get a little revelation and get a
[1:29:38] little intellectual and they'll stand
[1:29:40] there and laugh at people for doing the
[1:29:42] same thing they used to do.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? It's a devil. It's
[1:29:48] a devil. It's an intellectual devil. Oh
[1:29:51] well, can I preach? He said, "If it's
[1:29:54] with the word, then you stay with it."
[1:29:56] He said, "Listen here a few minutes. If
[1:29:58] you listen that devil a few minutes,
[1:29:59] he'll have you so far away from truth.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Till you don't know where you're at.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Well, can I just say it?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Our adversary, the devil, is the master
[1:30:14] at deception.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said it beautiful. He said,
[1:30:19] "Them intellectual giants have come in
[1:30:20] and they've swept in there and they've
[1:30:22] crept in among us." He said, "Now watch
[1:30:24] creeped in. That's what's causing us to
[1:30:26] go out in these big tantrums and that
[1:30:27] they've done creeped in among us men
[1:30:29] ordained to this condemnation. Creeped
[1:30:31] in among us, drawing us away from the
[1:30:32] word. Listen, causing us to lose faith
[1:30:35] in the word. He said, wandering spots,
[1:30:37] ships without sails. He said, "But if
[1:30:40] you got a real spiritual sale up there
[1:30:43] and the spirit picks it up and away
[1:30:44] across she goes in that land they know
[1:30:47] nothing about." He said, "That's causing
[1:30:48] you Yes, sir." He said, "Causing you to
[1:30:50] lose faith in the word by their polished
[1:30:52] up seminary experiences." Amen. But I
[1:30:55] want I want I want to turn a corner and
[1:30:57] say something to you. The hidden power
[1:30:59] in the church is the faith in the word.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Our secret is the faith of God in the
[1:31:08] word. Re said that's what we try to
[1:31:10] bring our church today. He said with the
[1:31:11] highest prettiest pews and the best
[1:31:13] dressed crowd that don't break the
[1:31:15] stronghold of the devil. It takes the
[1:31:17] hidden power of the spirit of God. He
[1:31:20] said that word in there to break the
[1:31:23] hold. Oh church, he said then what
[1:31:26] happened to Peter? He said he went up
[1:31:27] there to Pentecost and he got up there
[1:31:29] and at Pentecost he put on the whole
[1:31:32] armor of God. He said now watch the word
[1:31:36] that he had walked with was now in him
[1:31:39] burning him up with fire in his flesh
[1:31:42] and in his soul. He said what is it?
[1:31:44] It's God making himself ever present in
[1:31:47] his own army. Hallelujah. God on the day
[1:31:50] of Pentecost sent down the full armor of
[1:31:53] God for his army. Listen, I still
[1:31:56] believe that the spirit quickens the
[1:31:58] word. Hallelujah. In other words, the
[1:32:01] pro of God said he is the powder that
[1:32:03] sends the bullet out there.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Well, can I just tell that devil
[1:32:08] tonight, we're not a defenseless people.
[1:32:11] We're not a defense. This is not a
[1:32:13] defenseless meeting. Come on, church. No
[1:32:16] sir. Prophet of God said, "Listen, I've
[1:32:18] got a gun and it'll shoot. It's got good
[1:32:21] true shooting gun. I hang it up on the
[1:32:23] wall and I say, "Oh, yes, I got a gun."
[1:32:26] What do you do with it? It hangs on the
[1:32:28] wall. He said, "That's faith." People
[1:32:30] say, "Oh, I'm a Christian. Oh, I believe
[1:32:32] God can." But what do you do about it?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Put it to work.
[1:32:41] You've been authorized to use it.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You've been authorized to use it. Put it
[1:32:51] to work. Turn it loose. Do something
[1:32:53] with it. Get out there.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it? This is not a passive
[1:32:59] battle.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; This is not a passive battle. We're not
[1:33:06] sitting here waiting for the devil to
[1:33:08] bring the battle to us.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; But we have been chosen. Glory to God.
[1:33:14] We have been elected. We have been
[1:33:16] selected to take the battle to the
[1:33:18] enemy. He said, "Get up and hunt the
[1:33:21] devil." Where he says, "And when that
[1:33:23] devil says you're still hurting," how
[1:33:25] many's the devil ever told you that?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; One of you, two of you, three of you.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You're still hurting.
[1:33:32] You're a liar. Put a bead on him. Get
[1:33:35] him in the scope. And don't be afraid to
[1:33:38] pull the trigger.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You're a soldier. He said, "Don't be
[1:33:45] afraid to pull the trigger cuz it'll go
[1:33:47] off sure as anything." Yes, sir. It'll
[1:33:49] boomerang on him. So, just hold on.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Now, your general tonight
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; that I'm preach that I'm preaching about
[1:33:59] has defeated Satan on every ground.
[1:34:05] every grounds.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet called him,
[1:34:09] brother Wayne. He called him the great
[1:34:10] word general.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Every place the great word general met
[1:34:16] the devil. He defeated him.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God said it
[1:34:21] beautifully. He said, "What was it?"
[1:34:22] It's God's artillery in the human being
[1:34:25] manifesting the resurrection. What an
[1:34:29] army. Come on.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Like an army marches the Christian
[1:34:33] soldier.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Great triumph. He's in us. Not me. He's
[1:34:39] already conquered it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; You imagine, brother Joe going out on
[1:34:45] the battlefield in a war and you're
[1:34:47] going out there and they're fighting for
[1:34:49] victory.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; They're literally facing the enemy and
[1:34:53] they don't know if that enemy is going
[1:34:55] to take them out or not.
[1:34:58] But you're going to the enemy
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; from victory.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; The one that's behind you has already
[1:35:14] whipped the one that's in front of you.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And he come into you by the baptism of
[1:35:21] the Holy Ghost. Why are you afraid to
[1:35:23] face that devil?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to say what the
[1:35:27] Lord put on my heart today in my little
[1:35:28] office out there. Some things you're
[1:35:30] going to have to just fight about.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to quit sitting
[1:35:34] there waiting on the tables to turn and
[1:35:36] say, "Well, maybe if this lines up and
[1:35:37] this happens and this works out, I'll
[1:35:39] believe." You're going to have to stand
[1:35:41] up in the middle of a service and say,
[1:35:43] "Satan, you're defeated.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Devil, you're a liar. Devil, you will
[1:35:49] not take my brother. You will not take
[1:35:51] my sister. You will not take my family.
[1:35:53] You can't just sit there all passive and
[1:35:56] let the devil carry out the victory. I'm
[1:35:59] a soldier in the army of the Lord. I got
[1:36:03] my war clothes on in the army of the
[1:36:06] Lord. I didn't dress up and come out
[1:36:07] here to sit on the sidelines. I come
[1:36:10] here to fight. I come here to scrap. I
[1:36:12] come here to fight with that devil. How
[1:36:14] many says this is the last night I will
[1:36:17] put up with this devil? This is the last
[1:36:19] day I will be controlled.
[1:36:25] fight back.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Andrew, no. No, no. Well,
[1:36:31] Brother Andrew,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; give your enemy the word test.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "When he said Jesus Christ
[1:36:37] is a fake religion, it's been dead for a
[1:36:39] long time. There's no such a thing as
[1:36:41] this. There's no such a thing as a days
[1:36:43] a miracle." Stand there.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Am I reading that right, Brother Brian?
[1:36:51] stand there with the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:54] Ghost
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; and prove that it's the truth.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Preacher, what are you saying? I'm
[1:37:02] saying this. You fight the devil by
[1:37:05] living the word.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all right now are sitting
[1:37:11] there and the devil convinced you you're
[1:37:13] defeated and
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; you've been putting bruises on him all
[1:37:18] day long.
[1:37:20] Hallelujah.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But you know why he's convinced you
[1:37:24] that? Because you don't feel like you're
[1:37:26] victorious. You don't feel like you're a
[1:37:28] soldier. You don't feel like you're
[1:37:30] possessing anything. You don't feel like
[1:37:32] things are changing. You don't feel like
[1:37:35] things are happening. Well, I rebuke
[1:37:37] feelings tonight in the name of Jesus
[1:37:40] Christ. I'm not a soldier fighting with
[1:37:42] feelings. I'm a soldier in the army of
[1:37:45] the Lord, and I'm fighting with the
[1:37:47] faith of the word of God.
[1:37:51] Satan's biggest fear right now is a
[1:37:53] Christian soldier fighting the greatest
[1:37:55] battle ever been fought with full
[1:37:57] assurance.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm preaching to you tonight.
[1:38:01] Amen. I'm pushing back against this
[1:38:02] devil that's trying to rob you of a
[1:38:05] deliverance, that's trying to rob you of
[1:38:07] a wonderful meeting. That's trying to
[1:38:09] rob your mind and trying to rob you. I'm
[1:38:11] preaching against that devil tonight.
[1:38:15] You say, "Preacher, what are you doing?"
[1:38:16] I'm preaching with full assurance in my
[1:38:18] heart. This message is the truth.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching with full assurance in my
[1:38:25] heart. This message is the truth. I may
[1:38:28] not be able to say it the way I feel
[1:38:30] like it or say it the way I want to say
[1:38:32] it or put it together the best way, but
[1:38:34] inside of this whole 16 element body of
[1:38:37] Tennessee dirt is a full assurance. This
[1:38:40] message will whiff the devil anywhere,
[1:38:43] anytime, any place, under any condition.
[1:38:46] I don't care how low you are. It'll
[1:38:48] whiff the devil. I don't care how sick
[1:38:50] you are. I'm just going to have fun.
[1:38:52] It'll whiff the devil. I don't care how
[1:38:54] depressed you are. It'll whiff the
[1:38:56] devil. I don't care how broke you are.
[1:38:58] It'll whiff the devil inside of my
[1:39:01] heart. Is preaching faith from a heart
[1:39:04] full of assurance in the word, which is
[1:39:07] the original artillery.
[1:39:11] Hallelujah. Well, somebody praise God.
[1:39:14] The devil is defeated when full
[1:39:16] assurance rises.
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, how many men stepped out
[1:39:26] on the battlefield as chosen soldiers of
[1:39:28] the United States military and they
[1:39:30] never went back home?
[1:39:34] But you stepped out on the battlefield
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; and that devil looked at you and said,
[1:39:38] "I'm going to take you out." And you
[1:39:39] said, "I come from God."
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm going back to God and there
[1:39:46] ain't nothing you can do about it.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, face that devil tonight. That
[1:39:52] devil of cancer that tells you, "I'm
[1:39:54] going to take your life."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Face him tonight and say, "You didn't
[1:39:59] give me my life and you can't take my
[1:40:02] life.
[1:40:03] That old demon of nervousness, that old
[1:40:05] demon of depression, that old demon of
[1:40:07] always getting your feelings hurt,
[1:40:09] always sitting around tore up cuz
[1:40:11] somebody done somebody wrong. Why don't
[1:40:12] you face that devil tonight and say,
[1:40:15] "Satan, in the name of Jesus, I've got
[1:40:17] full assurance in my heart, you are a
[1:40:20] defeated foe.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're defeated."
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, it's been a long
[1:40:30] time and and I I don't know. I don't
[1:40:34] know. I don't I don't know if I can if I
[1:40:37] can come out of this situation. It's a
[1:40:39] It's the greatest battle, the battle of
[1:40:40] faith I've ever been in. And and brother
[1:40:42] Andrew, you don't you don't know how
[1:40:44] this battle has affected my spiritual
[1:40:46] life. And And you don't know, brother
[1:40:47] Andrew.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Fight the good fight of faith.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're not on a picnic.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; We're in a battlefield.
[1:41:01] Can I have a few minutes here?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Many people just think when they become
[1:41:05] a Christian, that's all they need to do
[1:41:07] and that just settles it forever.
[1:41:09] They're a Christian and everything's
[1:41:11] going to come easy. Don't you ever get
[1:41:13] that in your head.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; I become a Christian to fight.
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I become a Christian to fight.
[1:41:30] I
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; if I wanted to lay down and quit, I
[1:41:34] should have stayed out of the army of
[1:41:36] the living God. But I'm in the army of
[1:41:39] the living God to fight
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; fight the good fight of faith. He said,
[1:41:44] I become a Christian to get in the
[1:41:46] battle lines. We're Christian soldiers.
[1:41:49] We got to be trained and brought up and
[1:41:51] know all the techniques of the enemy.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Now, now, can I can I can I show you a
[1:41:58] warrior real quick? in in preaching
[1:42:00] tonight.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Faith waits patient.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Faith waits patient for the promised
[1:42:08] word
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham, you're old and your
[1:42:13] strength is gone and your arms are
[1:42:14] withered up and your manhood's gone, but
[1:42:16] I'm your mother.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Just take a hold of my promise
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; and be satisfied while you're waiting.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the way every believer, no
[1:42:26] matter how bad the cancer's got you,
[1:42:32] feeling good right now.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; How long you've been sitting in a
[1:42:37] wheelchair,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; any of those things, if you can grasp
[1:42:42] that revelation from God,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; then be satisfied knowing that it's
[1:42:48] going to happen because faith waits
[1:42:51] patiently for the promise.
[1:42:54] Brother Matt, no longer how you've been
[1:42:57] sitting in the wheelchair.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; What about Congressman Upshaw?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; In the early 1900s, do you all know
[1:43:09] medicine was nowhere near where it is
[1:43:10] today?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; I read this uh Voice of God put this out
[1:43:14] several years ago on William Upshaw. He
[1:43:16] was an 18-year-old boy who fell and
[1:43:19] broke his spine. Being an invid at the
[1:43:23] turn of the 20th century or the turn of
[1:43:25] the century rather was worse than anyone
[1:43:28] could imagine.
[1:43:30] An 18-year-old boy had to come to terms
[1:43:34] he may never walk again.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Footsteps
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; means
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; possession.
[1:43:43] The next seven years would be spent
[1:43:46] laying in a bed and eventually he would
[1:43:50] learn to walk again with crutches that
[1:43:52] he actually called his little buddies.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God, he faced challenges.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; But every challenge he faced, he was
[1:44:06] building inner strength.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I'm closing. William
[1:44:12] upshaw become famous for three phrases.
[1:44:14] Are you ready for them?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; The first one was let nothing discourage
[1:44:19] you.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; When you saw upshaw, he would say let
[1:44:24] nothing discourage you. The second one
[1:44:28] was never give up.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And the third one was God will heal me.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; It just isn't time yet.
[1:44:42] Let nothing discourage you. Well,
[1:44:45] church, tonight's a good night to put
[1:44:47] your kicking shoes on and kick that
[1:44:49] devil in the sea of the britches and
[1:44:51] say, "This is the last day you're going
[1:44:53] to discourage me.
[1:44:55] This is the last service I'm going to
[1:44:58] sit in discouraged. This is the last
[1:45:00] song I'm going to sing, Brother Charles.
[1:45:02] Discourage. This is the last meeting
[1:45:05] that I'm going to under the influence of
[1:45:08] the spirit of discouragement.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; I got a question for you. Okay. He I'm
[1:45:18] I'm not I'm I'm not trying to dig in
[1:45:20] this too deep, but he was hurt as a
[1:45:21] child.
[1:45:25] And his whole life he lived with this
[1:45:26] hurt
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; 66 years
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; from 18 something that happened in his
[1:45:33] childhood.
[1:45:39] And for 66 years he sat hurt from
[1:45:43] something that happened
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; in his childhood
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; and he went to church and how many
[1:45:50] preachers tried to get him out of that
[1:45:52] wheelchair. Brother Joe,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; how many meetings did he sit in? Like
[1:45:56] you're sitting right there tonight and
[1:45:57] some preacher get up there and see
[1:45:58] Upshaw was in the building and man,
[1:46:00] tonight's the night to put my name in
[1:46:02] neon lights. Hallelujah. Congressman
[1:46:04] Upshaw is in the building. Oh, glory to
[1:46:06] God. Upshaw, I see. It's time to get up.
[1:46:08] Oh, brother, walk. Hallelujah. Get the
[1:46:09] music going. It's time to get up. Glory
[1:46:10] to God. Come on, walk.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; How many preachers tried to get him out
[1:46:16] of that wheelchair and they never could?
[1:46:18] You know why? Because God had an
[1:46:21] appointed time.
[1:46:26] God had an appointed time. And in those
[1:46:29] 66 years, he never quit praising God. He
[1:46:33] never quit believing God. He never quit
[1:46:35] worshiping because in his soul was
[1:46:38] growing the revelation that he's still
[1:46:41] Jehovah Rafa. He's still Jehovah Gyra.
[1:46:44] He's still a miracle worker. No matter
[1:46:46] how dark the skies are, Brother Wayne,
[1:46:48] no matter how hard the days are, no
[1:46:50] matter how long I have to sit here, God
[1:46:53] will heal me. And I'm never going to
[1:46:57] give up.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know what wheelchair
[1:47:03] you're sitting in tonight. Maybe it's
[1:47:05] not a physical wheelchair. Maybe it's a
[1:47:07] spiritual wheelchair. And the devil
[1:47:09] rolls you to church in it. And the devil
[1:47:11] rolls you home in it. And the devil
[1:47:13] rolls you up around in it. But why don't
[1:47:15] you say, "Tonight, Satan, is the last
[1:47:17] night I will sit here as a crippled
[1:47:20] soldier in the army of the living God.
[1:47:24] I have been called of God to believe God
[1:47:28] and to put my foot on every divine
[1:47:30] promise.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. It's time to fight back,
[1:47:36] church.
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And he's sitting there and a prophet
[1:47:47] looks at him, Brother Joel, and he says,
[1:47:48] "Oh, I see you got this color suit." And
[1:47:52] do you have that color suit? Well, I
[1:47:53] bought it today and I'm going,
[1:47:56] "Oh, God."
[1:47:58] and everything's just lining right up
[1:48:00] and everything's just falling right in
[1:48:02] place. And all of a sudden, he says, "In
[1:48:05] the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; rise up
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and walk."
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said he done?
[1:48:14] He didn't sit there and say, "Well, here
[1:48:16] we go again.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Let's see if it works this time. Let's
[1:48:20] see if this is the service. Let's just
[1:48:22] let's just before. Bless you.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, prophet God said he jumped
[1:48:27] up out of the wheelchair.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait to see if his feet
[1:48:34] worked.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't wait to see if his legs
[1:48:38] worked. He didn't wait to see if he had
[1:48:40] some feeling in his toes. He jumped up
[1:48:43] out of the wheelchair and he took off
[1:48:45] running. I can imagine he ran up there
[1:48:47] singing, "I'm a soldier in the army of
[1:48:50] the Lord. I've been fighting for this
[1:48:52] moment. I've been praying for this
[1:48:54] moment. I've been believing for this
[1:48:56] moment. Well, I close tonight by saying
[1:48:58] this. The moment you've been praying
[1:49:00] for, the moment you've been fighting
[1:49:02] for, the moment you've been looking for
[1:49:04] is here tonight in the presence of Jesus
[1:49:08] Christ. Get up, soldier. Get up off the
[1:49:10] battlefield. Get up off your penny
[1:49:13] party. Get up off your ash heap. Put on
[1:49:15] your soldier clothes. Get a sword in
[1:49:18] your hand. Let's fight through the line
[1:49:20] of enemies. Let's fight for the spirit
[1:49:22] of unbelief. Let's fight for the demon
[1:49:24] of negativity.
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:27] It's time to press back. It's time to
[1:49:30] harass that devil. Hallelujah. Stand on
[1:49:33] your feet tonight and say, "I'm a
[1:49:35] soldier
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; standing strong
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; in the battle of faith."
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:49:49] I'm a soldier.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Not a coward.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I'm a soldier.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not a quitter.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a soldier.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Knock me down, I'll get up again.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I'm a soldier.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Prophet God said, "Do you see God always
[1:50:11] has some resource for divine healing?"
[1:50:14] He said, "Why people who were critical
[1:50:15] looked in St. John 5 and said, "Step in
[1:50:17] the water." But the wind hits the wall
[1:50:19] and blows the water back. You ever walk
[1:50:21] down into a pool? The old place is still
[1:50:23] there. And they said, "Oh, it's just a
[1:50:25] change in the wind." But to those who
[1:50:27] believed it was an angel.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But to those who believed
[1:50:32] it was an angel and the Bible declares
[1:50:35] it to be an angel.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:50:39] that the people of this meeting will
[1:50:41] have to recognize that there is a
[1:50:43] supernatural being that is standing here
[1:50:46] that's ministering through me and you
[1:50:48] can accept it as God or whatever you
[1:50:50] want to accept it that will determine
[1:50:52] your healing.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Faith is our victory.
[1:51:01] Can I can I pile a few more on the devil
[1:51:03] real quick?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; God rebuke that devil
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; that's hindering you beautiful little
[1:51:09] girls. May the power that raised Jesus
[1:51:12] from the grave cast that thing away and
[1:51:15] never bother you no more. I say that on
[1:51:18] the authority of God's word. You have to
[1:51:21] get angry with the devil.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; God gives us the victory. We've got it
[1:51:26] right now.
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:32] Brother Ram goes to another meeting
[1:51:34] several years later after Hubshaw's
[1:51:35] healed and brother David he's standing
[1:51:38] there preaching and he says is
[1:51:40] congressman upshaw here tonight he said
[1:51:44] oh there's the congressman he said why
[1:51:46] don't you come up here and say something
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; not roll up here come up here
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:57] Come on.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Remember this. Now, this is up. So, I I
[1:52:02] wish I'd sent it and played it, but just
[1:52:03] listen to it. Remember this.
[1:52:06] You who are stretched out here and want
[1:52:09] to be healed.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody got no right to tell me
[1:52:14] that he's been where you been.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Step out as God healed me to do. I said
[1:52:22] God's voice. That's what he says. I said
[1:52:24] God's voices spoke with brother
[1:52:26] Brandham. Brother Brandham said the
[1:52:28] congressman is healed. I said it's the
[1:52:32] voice of God.
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of God.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; What I'm hearing is the voice of God.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; There's a response. When there's a call,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; when there's a call made, there's a
[1:52:53] response.
[1:52:54] The congressman is healed, he stood up
[1:52:57] and he said, "God spoke to me." And
[1:52:59] here's what he said. I've been the
[1:53:01] happiest man since I threw my crutches
[1:53:03] and started out to witness to his
[1:53:05] healing as well as his saving power. I'm
[1:53:08] the happiest man that's ever been in
[1:53:10] Jeffersonville since Columbus discovered
[1:53:13] America.
[1:53:20] Got any soldiers here tonight?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Got any Gy got any soldiers here
[1:53:26] tonight?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Anybody got their walking shoes on
[1:53:31] tonight?
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Anybody got their feet shot with the
[1:53:35] preparation of the gospel?
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Will you take a prophet's instruction?
[1:53:42] Let me tell you, brother, when a man or
[1:53:44] a woman will step out virginly on the
[1:53:47] promise of God and say, "I believe it."
[1:53:50] Walk out in the street saying, "I
[1:53:52] believe it. I believe it. I believe it."
[1:53:53] Then it's going to happen.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:53:58] I'm a soldier.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking to soldiers tonight.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; The devil's not going to hand you your
[1:54:05] desire.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; You're going have to fight for it. Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; But I believe tonight it's a cause worth
[1:54:11] fighting for.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I believe the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:54:15] Ghost is worth fighting for.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I believe your miracle is worth fighting
[1:54:20] for.
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Remember one time I was in a meeting and
[1:54:25] I was sitting there and there was a
[1:54:28] sister and and God love her heart. She's
[1:54:31] up is up in Canada.
[1:54:33] She was
[1:54:35] Rain. She was having church.
[1:54:38] Everything the preacher said, "Amen.
[1:54:41] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah." It'd be
[1:54:45] dead quiet in there and she'd just take
[1:54:46] off shouting, "Amen."
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Sitting at breakfast the next morning,
[1:54:51] the brother sitting next to me.
[1:54:54] I don't know why we always attract them
[1:54:56] guys. He kind of leans over and he says,
[1:54:58] "Wasn't that getting on your nerves last
[1:55:00] night?"
[1:55:02] He said, "You know that's called
[1:55:03] emotion, don't you?"
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I'm still working on my political
[1:55:07] manners.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I just sitting there drinking my coffee
[1:55:12] and I leaned over. I said, "It's called
[1:55:14] spiritual warfare."
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; See, because I knew what she was
[1:55:24] fighting for. She was fighting against
[1:55:27] demons that were trying to take her kids
[1:55:29] to a devil's hell and a sinner's grave.
[1:55:31] You know what? The next year I went back
[1:55:33] up there and preached to that boy saved
[1:55:35] and full of the Holy Ghost. You say,
[1:55:37] "Preacher, it don't work." I got too
[1:55:39] many testimonies. It works. I rebuke
[1:55:43] that demon of intellectualism. I rebuke
[1:55:46] that demon of harassment that's trying
[1:55:48] to harass you and bring a new mode of
[1:55:50] worship in and trying to bring a
[1:55:52] polished way of backing the word of God
[1:55:54] up. I rebuke that devil in the name of
[1:55:56] Jesus Christ. And I say, devil, you're
[1:55:59] off limits on these grounds. We got some
[1:56:01] mamas and they're going to fight back
[1:56:03] against that devil till God restores
[1:56:05] their babies. We got some women that are
[1:56:08] praying for their husbands and we're
[1:56:09] going to join with them and we're going
[1:56:11] to fight all weekend if we have to.
[1:56:16] The devil's got a hold of people's
[1:56:18] health and we're not going to polish up
[1:56:20] this atmosphere and quieten down the
[1:56:22] anointing.
[1:56:24] No, Siri.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; We're soldiers
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and good things come to them that fight
[1:56:32] for it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; How many raise your hands and say,
[1:56:35] "Lord, I'm a soldier
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and it's a cause worth fighting for.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Harass my mind, I'm gonna fight anyhow.
[1:56:43] Harass my family. I'm going to fight
[1:56:46] anyhow.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Harass my church.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Going to fight anyhow.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Harass my family. I'm going to fight
[1:56:56] anyhow.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Harass this.
[1:57:01] Somebody ought to put some no
[1:57:02] trespassing signs up there to the devil.
[1:57:04] Yes, sir.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to hang some no
[1:57:08] trespassing signs up there in front of
[1:57:10] this tent. So when the devil shows up,
[1:57:12] he knows he's going to get a beaten
[1:57:14] legally.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; He's been warned not to show up.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Standing strong.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; How many say, "Lord, increase my
[1:57:25] courage."
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; How many say, "Lord, refresh me tonight
[1:57:30] as a soldier."
[1:57:32] Can we bow our hearts tonight?
[1:57:35] I've got an enemy in front of me, but I
[1:57:39] got a promise behind me.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I've got a doctor's report in front of
[1:57:43] me, but I got the word behind me.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; I've got a scar or a situation or a
[1:57:50] problem in front of me. I got the word
[1:57:53] behind me.
[1:57:55] I'm going to fight tonight. I'm going to
[1:57:58] fight this weekend.
[1:58:00] I'm going to fight. I'm going to fight
[1:58:03] back against that devil.
[1:58:06] Almighty God,
[1:58:09] in this tent tonight is warriors,
[1:58:12] soldiers, Lord,
[1:58:14] handpicked,
[1:58:16] divinely selected,
[1:58:19] chosen from before the foundation of the
[1:58:21] world for this great faith battle.
[1:58:25] Ordained of God to stand in this hour.
[1:58:28] ordained of God to swing this sword.
[1:58:32] And Lord, the devil's harassing them.
[1:58:34] But Lord, may they approach these
[1:58:36] meetings differently than any other
[1:58:37] meetings they've ever approached.
[1:58:40] Father, as we've come here tonight to
[1:58:42] speak your word, and Lord, we so thank
[1:58:44] you for this privilege to spend a few
[1:58:46] minutes here communing with you and your
[1:58:49] children around the things that you've
[1:58:50] revealed in this hour. And Lord, I know
[1:58:53] they've heard these things over and over
[1:58:54] and over, but Lord, it just so come real
[1:58:56] to my heart today. We're in a great
[1:58:59] faith battle, but we're standing strong.
[1:59:03] We're not giving in, Lord. We're not
[1:59:06] giving up. We're not We're not becoming
[1:59:09] intimidated by Satan's harassments,
[1:59:12] Lord. We're standing in faith. And Lord,
[1:59:15] I believe right here tonight, there's
[1:59:16] believers breaking out on the battle
[1:59:18] lines right now. Father, as your word
[1:59:21] has gone forth, Lord, I believe they've
[1:59:23] been hearing, they've been hearing the
[1:59:26] call of battle tonight from the word.
[1:59:29] The great word general has spoken here
[1:59:30] tonight. And he's told us and given us
[1:59:33] instructions, resist that devil. That
[1:59:36] thing you're communing with, resist it.
[1:59:39] Resist that that negative line spirit.
[1:59:42] Resist it right now.
[1:59:45] Hallelujah.
[1:59:47] That devil that's telling you you're
[1:59:48] going to lose your mind, resist him
[1:59:50] right now in the name of Jesus.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah.
[1:59:55] That devil that's trying to call upon
[1:59:57] you right now and tell you this is going
[1:59:58] to be another meeting. You're going to
[2:00:00] leave the same. Nothing's going to
[2:00:01] change. Nothing's going to happen.
[2:00:03] Resist that devil right now in the name
[2:00:05] of Jesus.
[2:00:07] Resist him right now. Almighty God, come
[2:00:11] by this tent tonight, Lord. On the first
[2:00:14] night of these meetings, come by. If
[2:00:17] there be a soldier that's laid their
[2:00:18] sword down, taken their armor off, sat
[2:00:22] down on the sidelines, in the name of
[2:00:25] Jesus, I charge them. I charge them
[2:00:27] tonight. In the name of the Lord, pick
[2:00:29] up your sword.
[2:00:31] Take on the whole armor of God.
[2:00:34] Fight.
[2:00:36] Fight through the devil. Fight through
[2:00:37] those spirits tonight. It's a cause
[2:00:40] worth fighting for.
[2:00:42] Stand strong.
[2:00:44] in the faith in Jesus name we pray.
[2:00:48] Amen.
[2:00:50] Oh, would you just raise your hands
[2:00:51] tonight all over the tent? Say, Lord,
[2:00:54] come by my way.
[2:00:57] Fighting tonight. I'm fighting tonight.
[2:01:01] I'm fighting tonight.
[2:01:03] Fighting in the name of the Lord. I'm
[2:01:06] fighting. Fighting for my family.

[2:07:06] Break every chain. Break every chain.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Break every chain. Amen. Won't you give
[2:07:13] the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight?
[2:07:15] I want to go back.
[2:07:18] How many soldiers do we have here
[2:07:20] tonight? I think that's a perfect
[2:07:23] message for the first night of a
[2:07:24] meeting.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; We're soldiers in God God's army. Ain't
[2:07:28] that wonderful? God is building an army.
[2:07:30] And if you look around, this looks a lot
[2:07:32] like a training camp. Amen. Isn't that
[2:07:35] right?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; We just want to let God to come and
[2:07:38] equip us for what we have need of for
[2:07:39] the battle that is ahead. Amen. I
[2:07:42] believe he gave us the one thing that
[2:07:44] that defeats the enemy anywhere. Isn't
[2:07:46] that powerful? He said the word of God,
[2:07:48] it'll defeat the devil any place,
[2:07:50] anytime, anywhere. It'll defeat him.
[2:07:53] That's all we need. Ain't it, Brother
[2:07:54] Dave? It'll defeat him when you're
[2:07:56] feeling good. It'll defeat him when
[2:07:58] you're feeling bad. Ain't that right?
[2:08:00] It'll defeat him on your best day. It'll
[2:08:02] defeat him on your worst day.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil knows it. That's why he
[2:08:06] tries to keep the word out of the mouth
[2:08:07] of a believers. I I think that's what we
[2:08:09] ought to tell the devil sometimes.
[2:08:10] Devil, I know the word of God will
[2:08:12] defeat you. It don't matter what comes
[2:08:13] my way. The word of God, it'll defeat
[2:08:15] the I wish Dr. Seuss would have got
[2:08:17] saved and got a hold of this message a
[2:08:19] long time ago. He'd have wrote a new
[2:08:20] book. He'd have said, "The word of God
[2:08:22] will defeat the devil on the train.
[2:08:24] It'll defeat him in the rain. It'll
[2:08:25] defeat him when you're home. It'll
[2:08:27] defeat him when you're good. It'll
[2:08:29] defeat him when you're feeling bad. The
[2:08:30] word of God is the best thing that I've
[2:08:32] ever had. It don't matter what comes my
[2:08:34] way. The word of God is here to stay. I
[2:08:37] think the word of God is enough. And God
[2:08:39] has equipped the believer tonight with
[2:08:42] the very thing that'll overcome the
[2:08:43] enemy. I think we ought to put our hands
[2:08:45] together for the Lord and say, "The word
[2:08:47] that God gave us is big enough to take
[2:08:49] over any enemy that I have to face."
[2:08:52] Amen. You believe that tonight? Amen.
[2:08:55] Let's just sing this together.
[2:08:58] Well, I've been changed.
[2:09:02] I've been healed.

[2:09:54] said I won't go back. I can't go back.

[2:11:59] I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[2:12:04] way you used to be before your spirit
[2:12:08] came. I can't help. I got to sing that
[2:12:10] last verse one more time. All my chains,

[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; They've been forgiven. How many you lift

[2:12:36] And my
[2:12:38] is the moment to put the devil in this
[2:12:41] place. I've been changed.

[2:12:57] spirit changed
[2:12:59] me when I said I won't go back. I can't
[2:13:04] go back to the way you used to be before
[2:13:09] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:13:13] Well, I said I won't go back.
[2:13:17] I can't go back

[2:14:32] Amen. Cuz we're soldiers in God's army.
[2:14:35] Amen. And I come to this meeting
[2:14:37] expecting great miracles. I expect a
[2:14:40] move of God. I expect people that are
[2:14:41] lost to be saved. I expect people to be
[2:14:44] that are sick to be healed. I expect
[2:14:46] people that need a touch from the Lord
[2:14:47] to be touched. People that need
[2:14:49] deliverance. I expect them to be
[2:14:50] delivered. The devil's come too late to
[2:14:53] tell me. I've been in too many meetings
[2:14:55] where people that couldn't walk got up
[2:14:56] and walked. I watched a lady one time in
[2:14:58] India that for six years, she had been
[2:15:00] sitting in a paralyzed condition from
[2:15:02] her waist down that people had to help
[2:15:04] her carry her walk into the meeting.
[2:15:06] Couldn't walk on her own from an
[2:15:07] accident in a an auto accident. She said
[2:15:10] she had a a dream or a vision one night.
[2:15:12] She was a Hindu woman and and the and a
[2:15:15] man in the dream told her, "You go to a
[2:15:17] gospel meeting. go to the gospel meeting
[2:15:18] and you'll receive your healing. So the
[2:15:20] lady went to one of her friends and
[2:15:22] didn't even know what a gospel meeting
[2:15:23] was. She said, "What's a gospel
[2:15:25] meeting?" She said, "Well, here's some
[2:15:26] that I found." They went to a
[2:15:27] Pentecostal meeting and different
[2:15:29] things. Every meeting they could find,
[2:15:31] they went to. And for six years, that
[2:15:34] woman went to gospel meetings and she
[2:15:35] still never had healing. She still she
[2:15:38] never she never got up. All that still
[2:15:40] going through it. But one day, we were
[2:15:42] sitting over there preaching a message
[2:15:44] on doubt being an enemy of God. I didn't
[2:15:46] know who the woman was. I was preaching
[2:15:47] a testimony about God healing me when I
[2:15:49] was a little boy. And I thought, if I
[2:15:52] can't do nothing else, I can say what
[2:15:53] God does. God's a healer. He fixed my
[2:15:55] arm when it was broke. And my mom and
[2:15:57] dad didn't have enough money. They were
[2:15:58] worried. My mom was worried about taking
[2:16:00] me to the doctor. But God performed a
[2:16:02] miracle on me. And he put my arm just
[2:16:04] some many of you, how many was here that
[2:16:05] night? Many of that was there. God, God
[2:16:08] bless y'all. God, God came in and
[2:16:10] performed a miracle on me. And I was
[2:16:11] telling that testimony in the meeting
[2:16:13] that go that the devil can't make me
[2:16:14] doubt God being a healer because God
[2:16:17] healed me. And when God does something
[2:16:18] for you, it took all the doubt away. I
[2:16:20] said, I can always look at that arm when
[2:16:22] I start to doubt. And I remember wiping
[2:16:23] the dirt off my arm when God healed me.
[2:16:25] And I said, God, God done it and I can't
[2:16:28] doubt because I seen God do it. And all
[2:16:30] of a sudden, while I told that, this
[2:16:31] woman got up out of the back of the room
[2:16:33] and came wobbling to the front of the
[2:16:34] building and that place went to shouting
[2:16:36] and praising God. That brother, the the
[2:16:38] interpreter started shaking me. Do you
[2:16:39] know what's happening? And I said, "No,
[2:16:41] I I don't know what I thought she was
[2:16:42] under some spook or something because
[2:16:44] the way she was running." He said, "That
[2:16:46] woman hadn't been able to walk like that
[2:16:47] in six years. She's been sitting there.
[2:16:49] People's been carrying her, but she came
[2:16:51] up and gave a testimony." She said, "I
[2:16:53] heard that young man's testimony." And I
[2:16:55] said, "God, if that would work for him,
[2:16:57] then it would work for me." And the
[2:16:59] feeling came back to her legs. Let me
[2:17:01] hear. You come too late to tell me that
[2:17:03] God don't heal and God don't save and
[2:17:06] God don't deliver. I'm talking about a
[2:17:08] God that is more than able. It don't
[2:17:10] matter what you have need of. You just
[2:17:12] go ahead and tell the devil, "You're not
[2:17:13] welcome here." And God's word is still
[2:17:16] true. No matter what we need. Amen. I
[2:17:19] come expecting God to do great things.
[2:17:22] We've got a right as believers to take
[2:17:24] our stand upon the word of God and put
[2:17:26] the devil in his place. That the devil
[2:17:28] didn't put this meeting together. God
[2:17:30] put it together. And we got a right to
[2:17:32] get it. Take every advantage of it that
[2:17:34] we can. Amen. And I believe the spirit
[2:17:37] of God is here and he's here to do
[2:17:40] something for you. How many lift your
[2:17:42] hand and say, "Brother Matt, I'm going
[2:17:43] to take everything God has to offer and
[2:17:45] you're going to receive it."
[2:17:48] And you're going to receive it. Amen.
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:58] They'll keep
[2:18:04] you in my mother. You must fight. You
[2:18:08] must keep on the fire.
[2:18:13] There are many angels now beyond the
[2:18:16] space.

[2:18:24] [Applause]
[2:18:25] not finding
[2:18:27] [Music]
[2:18:31] where you must

[2:19:55] [Music]

[2:20:02] glory.

[2:20:09] and when we see the soul that we have to
[2:20:15] Jesus from the s.

[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:27] Well, you must fight
[2:20:31] against all evil and never run or even
[2:20:36] lie behind. And if you would win for God
[2:20:41] and the righteous, keep on the far red
[2:20:45] line.
[2:20:47] Well, you must fight and be brave
[2:20:50] against all evil and never run. You're
[2:20:55] leaving behind.
[2:20:57] If you must win for God in the right,
[2:21:02] keep on the far red line.
[2:21:06] But I said if you must win for God in
[2:21:10] the right keep on the fire.

[2:21:24] it wonderful to be a part of something
[2:21:26] that we we know the end result. Brother
[2:21:30] Andrew said we have an assurance.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Many soldiers go into battle. They're
[2:21:36] not sure they'll ever make it home
[2:21:37] because many have fallen in battle. But
[2:21:39] we have an assurance that no matter what
[2:21:41] we face in this battle, we're going to
[2:21:43] make it home.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that a wonderful? Did you catch
[2:21:46] that? Isn't that wonderful? That's our
[2:21:48] assurance that we're going to make it
[2:21:50] home. We We're going into battle, but
[2:21:52] our assurance we're going to be home.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; All our wounds will be mended. All the
[2:21:57] sorrow will be forgotten. All the pain,
[2:21:59] all the tears will be wiped away. We're
[2:22:01] going to make it home.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; We have a real assurance. Amen. How many
[2:22:06] believes that tonight?
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "We have a blessed
[2:22:09] assurance." Amen. That God has given us
[2:22:12] that we're going to make. We're get
[2:22:13] ready to close tonight. Sister Betty
[2:22:16] would like to stand for for Jordan
[2:22:19] tonight and she's not be able to make
[2:22:21] the services. The doctor told her she
[2:22:24] needed to stay in the bed for a few
[2:22:25] weeks trying to keep her from till her
[2:22:28] baby is born. and uh she's been having
[2:22:30] some really uh high blood pressure and
[2:22:33] and and so they went to the doctor a few
[2:22:35] times in the middle of the night. So, we
[2:22:37] just asked the Lord to to touch her body
[2:22:39] and her grandma's wanting to stand uh
[2:22:41] for tonight and it's her first baby and
[2:22:44] so we certainly believe that God, you
[2:22:46] know, many times has brought many people
[2:22:48] through that same thing. So, we just
[2:22:50] want to ask the Lord. It's never wrong
[2:22:52] to ask God to stand in. Amen. Amen. They
[2:22:56] can't figure out how that why that stuff
[2:22:57] happens. But we have a God that
[2:22:59] certainly knows. Amen. And so we just
[2:23:01] want to stand for her tonight. Also
[2:23:03] remember, Brother Roy asked for prayer,
[2:23:05] was sick in his body, wanted to be at
[2:23:06] the meeting that he'd be able to be
[2:23:08] recovered and be here tomorrow night.
[2:23:10] And and so we just want to remember them
[2:23:12] in prayer. Let's just bow our heads
[2:23:14] together if you all want to join us and
[2:23:15] pray. Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
