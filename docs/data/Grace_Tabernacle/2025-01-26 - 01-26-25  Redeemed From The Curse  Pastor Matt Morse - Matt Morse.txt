everything that's done we ask you these things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen may God bless you this morning just want to invite you to the scripture uh we're going to read out of the book of Galatians in the third chapter and we'll read from the 13th verse and we'll give you just a moment to to turn there Galatians 3 and13 we had started last Sunday in a reading out of the book of Galatians I've been studying out of out of this uh out of this book for uh quite some time but last Sunday we we had started speaking uh out of out of Galatians the third chapter and I really may take a few uh Services just in this one chapter so whenever you're home uh throughout the week you might read uh just through Galatians the 3D chapter there's a lot that's laying in here that pertains uh to the bride of Christ here in the end time and uh so we just want to take the time to be able to bring that uh bring that out but the Bible says in the 13th verse it says Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written that cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith and we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word how many say Amen to that scripture amen may God bless you this morning now I I done so much studying on this uh on this chapter uh you there's no way you can get to uh get to it all in one uh service I I would uh sometimes you kind of have to break it up between services and and you really just want to get in there and and and bring it all out and but I realized we're not in India this morning we're in Arkansas and so uh we I I I started to preach over there on the Sunday morning I had 104 fever and walked out there and that brother leaned over to me and he said it was 11:00 he said brother Matt You Preach till 2:30 or 3:00 no problem brother I said well you don't have nothing to worry about I won't at 3:00 the brother that's with me won't be in here anymore so I'm going to have to be wherever he is we but but he he said you know the people will sit for three or 4 hours that's no problem they they just want you to preach all day and uh but but the the reality is in 3 or four hours uh we wouldn't be able to sit here any longer and I don't know ain't nobody wants to hear me that long so I wouldn't do that to you this morning but I do want to bring some things out of this this uh this verse of scripture uh that I feel like is something that is so important to the church and and uh you know last week we had started we read from the seventh to the ninth verse and showing uh how that the Seed of Abraham uh that possessed a great faith and know how Paul was teaching that uh that that what we received from God it was not by The Works of the law that we received the promises of God but the way we received him was by our faith and uh brother Bram would say that he said to receive the word of God any the word is a seed he said and the only uh the Bible said it was a seed that was sowed the sewer went forth to seow said but in order for that seed to grow it has to fall in the right kind of soil you remember the the parable that Jesus made and brother B said that soil is our faith in other words it takes something for the seed of the word to be planted in that it would be able to grow he says so that soil is our faith it has to have an atmosphere for growth if you want to see a word growing in you or to be a word born son or daughter of God and to grow strong how many would like to be strengthened in the word of God and be a a son or daughter of God that can stand by the word and be so be so strong and when the things of the world come come at you you're able to defend it said but it has to be in the right kind of soil and that soil is our faith and and from that comes water and comes nutrients and it comes a uh from the soil comes a structure that a seed can grow in it's a place for it to have its roots and a and a place to uh uh it it gives strength and support to a seed and so we realize that our faith is such an important part of our life and and so uh and without it we' never be able to go anywhere with God so it takes that for the seed to be able to fall in so uh we saw how Paul was talking about that and you know of course through these uh Services you realize that what Paul is speaking of especially in Galatians the thirr chapter here in this chapter he was actually trying to teach the galatian church here they had they had by false teaching they had gone into a teaching that the works of the law is what it took to be justified in the sight of God and so here Paul would come to reprove the galatian church in other words he was bringing correction to them to show them that that that the works of the law is never going to justify you there a't no no matter how hard you work or how much effort that you put into it or how how many times you go to make sacrifice it doesn't matter what what you would do but it would never it would never bring justification again and this is what he was teaching in a in in a grand uh scheme what he was teaching the galatian church is that justification does not come by The Works of the law but it only come by faith and so here in this scripture he would speak these words he said Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law you know I read that and something just kind of stuck out me we know the the word redeem it means to regain possession how many knows that so he said Christ has redeemed us now there's something right in the very beginning of this uh of this uh scripture and this is what I want to speak on this morning that Christ has redeemed us from the curse and here at the very beginning of this as Paul would begin to speak on it he shows us that this word he uses is the word redeemed now how many knows redeemed is the past tense of the word redeemed so here Paul has showing us from the very first word brother Mark that this is not something that God is going to do but it's something that God has already done see there's many today that are looking for a way for God to redeem them is there something I can do that would cause God to redeem me out of this place or redeem me out of this condition but Paul said but Christ has already redeemed you from the curse of the law so first off before we ever even get started into this scripture we have to first realize that is not something that God Can Do You Realize God can do nothing else to redeem you God can't do any other work that would bring you to God or bring you closer to God he can't do something to redeem you because Redemption has already been done so we first off have to understand that it is a past tense it's something that God has already done see and here Paul is showing us that many we go search for Redemption and it's not a bad thing for us to search for Redemption but what we have to realize that in our search for Redemption that there will never be another Act of redemption for the act of redemption is what Jesus has already done so when we're searching for it we may find Redemption but we're not going to find God performing another act to be able to redeem us back to him say See Redemption is a past tense thing so we realize that as Paul is speaking on this that we find that today that many have failed to see the value of their Redemption that God has paid for and you know I look at people they you know you you talk about Redemption and talk about all the things that God done and to some people it don't mean anything to them you ever notice it don't matter how many times you talk about it it don't mean nothing to them they that they find no value in being redeemed they find no value in Redemption and I thought you know I I I thought about that I thought you know the reason that people don't find Value in Redemption is because they don't understand the gravity of the curse that they were under see if you if you knew what you were really under and you knew what you where you were really heading and you knew uh the the burden of the curse that was upon you then it gives Redemption a lot more value if you knew what what if you knew how in other words if you knew how bad the curse was You' know how how much meaning that that Redemption had that it saved you from the curse so you know as I so I I thought on these on on these things of of the curse that that Paul was speaking of and and you can read about it in Deuteronomy through the the law of Moses and he begins to speak of the of the people following and obeying the word of the Lord and how that the curse would come upon them and and he would say because the they must obey the voice of God and observe his Commandments and notice what the Bible said that then the curse would come because they failed to obey the word of the Lord and here was the curse he said cursed shall you be in the city and cursed shall you be in the field cursed would you be in your basket and in your store cursed would be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land and in the increase of thy cattle and the flocks of thy sheep and cursed you will be when you come in and curse you will be when you go out so here God is going to lay out the curse of people that will not obey the word of the Lord and you realize that in this curse it came with poverty it came with sickness it came with destruction and it came with no way of Escape so it didn't matter who you were or it didn't matter who you were born to or what your tribal inage was because they failed to obey the word or the law of God then they were cursed with poverty sickness and destruction had no way out so here's what Paul was preaching he was talking about the curse that would come on the church and he said but Christ has come and has redeemed us from the curse of the law he didn't say Christ took you redeemed you from the law that's why Jesus didn't even preach that he said I didn't come to do away with the law but I came to fulfill it you say well how did he fulfill it he became the Cur curse that was associated with the law Paul said he was made a curse for us for it was written that cursed is everyone that hangeth upon a tree in other words whenever the curse you deserve the curse because we broke the law of God and you deserve the curse because you couldn't keep the law of God but Paul said but he became the curse for you in other words he fulfilled the very law of God he he fulfilled it by becoming the curse that you and I so deserve and he said in The Blessing of Abraham it might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith can you put that up there Galatians 3:14 that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentile through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith now this is a powerful verse of scripture now I know you you've read this we read it last week but if you could take a moment just to read this that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith now there there's something that Paul is trying to show I I I love just getting into scripture and just going going down right deep into it and finding finding the meaning of it and but notice what Paul is teaching the church he's showing us that The Blessing of Abraham was the promise of the spirit of God so here here he's bringing a revelation to the to the church that it wasn't just this land in Canaan it wasn't just that they would receive this Borders or this border of this land but there was something farther in the the promise that God was making to Abraham uh that was to every believer and so here is he would show it that it was the that that the blessing was the spirit of God and here you notice what he's teaching he's actually teaching us on the Covenant of Abraham so here here that you could think as the galatian church now I know you've heard it but the galatian church hadn't heard it here they thought that Abraham uh that the Covenant that God made with Abraham only applied to Israel and it only applied to that that that great nation that they that they had seen rise and fall and go through these things but here Paul was bringing something else to them by re ation he was a prophet of God he seen things that that they didn't see and here he went all the way back into the mind of God when God would make a promise to Abraham and he would say to the church that before God made a promise to Abraham he had you on his mind and so when he would go to make that promise to him he saw you and he saw your condition he knew you would have to have a way out he said and then God after he saw your condition he went back in time because he's an eternal God and he found Father Abraham and he made a promise unto him him and that promise applies to you today and so here he was bringing this to the church and notice how he was teaching on this Covenant of Abraham I could just imagine the galatian church sitting there and their minds begin to to be stretched out and their thoughts stretched out that you mean the Covenant it applies to you and me my I I never thought that that you know when I read about it I never saw that in it but Paul he begin to bring the Covenant of Abraham and to bring it present in the in the Gentile church he said see you you would ask this well how would Abraham's Covenant give me the promise of the spirit of God you know you you think about what a covenant is see a covenant is an agreement that is made and there's many covenants throughout the Bible you you could you could find I know we we speak on them many times but you there there was the abrahamic Covenant there was the uh the the noic Covenant in other words it was a covenant God made with Noah that he would never flood the Earth again there was the The davidic Covenant that God made with David that there that there would come one after him that would rule or that would reign in the Throne of David there was the adamic Covenant that God made with Adam remember don't touch this tree or thou Thou shalt surely th Thou shalt surely die many times we find covenants that God makes with man throughout the scripture thank you for having that brother but many times he he he brings this he brings this out there's many covenants that God's made but but we find this that in all the covenants that God makes with man there's only two types of covenants and one is a covenant of law and the other is a Covenant of Grace there was one that was a covenant that's based on conditions and there's another Covenant that's an unconditional Covenant and see brother BR said that's why God had to make that kind of Covenant because every time God makes a law man always breaks it when God makes a covenant with man man never keeps his Covenant he said he never kept his Covenant in the days of Adam he never kept his Covenant in the days of Moses he never kept his Covenant in the days of Jesus man always breaks his Covenant but I thank God this morning that God don't ever break his God always keeps his you'll never find a place in scripture you read through the entire Bible and you'll find where man has broken his Covenant with God but you'll never find a place in the Bible where God ever broke his Covenant with man say see so it means something for God to have a covenant with us see you know it's important listen what God is making this Covenant with Abraham you realize when you look at this Covenant God made with Abraham it was not based on man's abilities it was not based on on what Abraham could do or could not do and this is such an important thing that Paul is teaching because it applies to the Gentile church now notice what God gave can I take just a minute in this and if I don't finish I'll pick up next next time but notice what God is telling Abraham he tells him seven promises that he's going to give to him when he calls him uh calls him out of the the land of his fathers he said I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless Thee I will make thy name Great Thou shalt be a bless bling so not only am I going to bless you but I'm going to cause you to be a blessing to others in other words you're going to possess something in you that you're able to give out he said Thou shalt be a blessing he said and then I will bless those that bless you I will curse those that curse you and in the shall all the families of the earth be blessed and see in these precious promises that God gave to Abraham lays the promise to the gentile people now you think about it here it was many years after God spoke this to Abraham before God comes and makes it a formal Covenant remember in Genesis 17 the Bible says I think Abraham was 99 years old and God came to Abraham and he said Abraham I will make a covenant this has been many years since he's called him out many many years has gone by that he's lived out out in the plains this is after he had already went and and fought the Kings and and and and defeated the Kings and restored lot back to his home it this is the time that God comes to to make this formal Covenant with Abraham notice and when he when he would call him to this place he said I'm going to make a covenant with thee and multiply thee exceedingly and the Bible says and Abram fell on his face before God and God talked with him I thought my that's something we ought to hear this morning you most of the time people fall on their face but they do all the talking but the Bible said Abraham fell on his face before God and God talked to him I I think that's a place that we ought to get to this morning that we can lay in the presence of God and allow God to speak that we can get to a place that we can hear the voice of God that's that's what we're doing this morning is to sit in the presence of God and hear the voice of God as it begins to speak to our soul and he says things that that we we that we wouldn't be able to say and puts things together in our life and leads us words that a man wouldn't have the ability to be able to speak but the spirit of God is able to speak to our soul because we're laying in the presence of God and hearing the voice of God speak he said as behold as for me behold my Covenant is with thee you'll be the father of many nations neither shall thy name be more called Abram but your name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of Thee I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and generations it'll be an Everlasting Covenant that's a key point in other words the Covenant I'm making with you is not just for this generation of people but it is Everlasting so here that's where Paul could pick this up and say this still applies to us today it's an everlasting Covenant and to God to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land that thou art a stranger the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession and I will be their God now notice this is not just a promise but now God here is making a formal Covenant with Abraham that these things are going to come to pass now notice a as Abraham was a man just like you and I he had emotions just like you and I do he he was a man that that had insecurities like us and when God come and he said I'm going to make this Covenant with you because he's just like you and I are he said well how do I know that this is really going to take place isn't that the way we are that's our human nature what how how how can I have a confirmation of this how how do I know this is really right and listen how how do I know that I'll inherit and here here here God begin to speak to him and notice how God confirms that this is watch this is what Paul is bringing out now Paul Paul just makes this statement but this is where he got it from here here whenever here when God begins to confirm it he tells Abraham he said go and make a sacrifice for me take a hepher and take a ram and take a gold and a pigeon and a turtle dove and he divided up those four-footed beasts and and he laid them out upon the Altar and then as you would lay them out one piece to another then the Bible says here Abraham he was watching over the sacrifice you you could just see him here as he went out brother Mark to obey the word of the Lord and he took the he took the animals and the RAM and the and the goat and he and he took them and he div bed them in half and he laid one piece on one side and one piece on the other side and here head to tail he laid these sacrifices upon the Altar and you realize that Abraham being a just man of God and trying to obey the word of the Lord the Bible said he watched over the sacrifice he stood and he made sure that the birds and the that didn't come and get on the on the fresh meat but he was making sure that God was able to use them so it wasn't that that that just Abraham was relaxing and he well I I did what God wanted me to and he went back and kicked back to take but the Bible said he was watching over the sacrifice and I and and as the as the sun began to go down and here this man of God was watching over the sacrifices he had done what God had asked him to do and I could just see him so intently trying to keep the word of the Lord and as he as he was watching over it and the sun began to go down the Bible said but all of the sudden a deep sleep fell upon Abraham so here as this sleep fell upon him what God was doing he was showing him something now he put him into a sleep and then the Bible said and then a great Blackness a great Darkness fell around him and in the middle of that Darkness as the darkness would fall around then all of a sudden there came a smoking furnace and a and a burning lamp that came right between the sacrifices and divided them in two and the prophet of God say listen what God was showing to Abraham remember he began to speak to him he said Abraham your your your seed is going to go into an a land that is not theirs and there they'll be there for four generations but no oh if you could just see the plan of God he said they're going to go there but why why would God take them through this place because God's going to raise them there he's going to build a nation and he's going to use Egypt to build them he's going to give them a place that they can grow and they can multiply and they became this great this great uh people or this great nation of God and he made sure that they were fed and they grew although it would be a time of bondage he said but then there comes a time that I'm going to bring them out and when I bring them out they're not going to be packing bricks and they're not they're not going to be packing Egypt and they're not going to be packing all all the burdens that Egypt had put on them but when they come out they're going to come out with a great substance and they're going to leave out with silver and gold and The Spoils of Egypt they're going to come out with great wealth and they're going to go into the land that I that I have given unto them notice but that you see what God was doing he was giving them this place of inheritance now I know a a lot of the people that don't that that just aren't Christians and don't like Christ I feel like preaching this morning y'all just have to let me go but but but the people that don't like Christianity they say well God's an unjust God because he took land away from from one people and he gave it to another people why would God do a thing like that but notice What God Says to Abraham he says you have to go to this place of Egypt or this place where you'll be a stranger because the because the iniquity of the amorites is not yet fulfilled so here God is telling Abraham that the amorites that possessed the land of Canaan the land that was promised to Israel that they were a people that was going to receive the Judgment of God because of their iniquity but here God knowing that their iniquity he said it's not yet filled they haven't came oh my that ought to tell us something this morning that they haven't came to the place of judgment do you realize that that's the way God is today that's the very Mercy that you see of God today is because God is a merciful god and he would allow them to sin and allow them to commit iniquity until the cup of iniquity was overflowing and it demanded the Wrath or the Judgment of God that's the place that we are today don't you realize that you that the there would come a time that was judgment you said well brother man when when judgment come it's when the cup of iniquity is filled it's whenever that's what that's what brother maram said when he was talking in the second seal about Satan remember he said Satan would be three things one he was Satan he was incarnate in the in the early Church in the Jews Satan was an antichrist but then in the Dark Ages he became no longer the well it was still the the spirit of antichrist he said but in the Dark Ages he became a false prophet so here because it it was that dark denominationalism that is leading Leading the People of God and here they're drinking out of this cup of iniquity he said he become a false prophet see there they are with a cup of iniquity that's the church age that we live in now but after this age the church is going to go home and whenever she goes home speaking of the bride of Christ and whenever she goes home then Satan will become a great Beast he'll become the devil incarnate that great red dragon himself he said you can't see but notice he will be in his people then that great spirit can you imagine that people in the that walking in the world would be the devil incarnate he said but after that bride goes home then that same he'll become the dragon now he'll there'll be the devil incarnate why because there's no God in it at all and he would it would be Satan incarnated in his people you say oh my what a sad thing it is to see people that that the very demon out of the pits of hell would be incarnate living in human bodies but what got them to that place he said they got there because the false prophets have proph side them right into it that's why the Bible said that they would they would give over to strong delusions to believe lies and be damned by it what is it it's false prophets that are prophesying people into a place to be able to possess the very demon out of the pits of hell I thought my there's a there's coming a time when the cup of iniquity iniquity would be filled there's coming a time when judgment would stri the Earth you realize that that that we're so close to it now but the Bible says they would deny the word of God or they would have a a form of godliness but deny the power of God is that not the age that we live in the world has a form of godliness but deny the very power of God and deny the power of the Holy Ghost see but when the cup of iniquity is full judgment would come but notice what God's telling him here this is coming he and he says first a deep sleep fell on Abraham then a whr of Darkness then a furnace of fire a burning light went between the Covenant between the sacrifices and divid it he said well what what does all that mean but M said see it means that every human being has to die see notice what he's showing us through Abraham's sacrifice that every human being has to die and we deserve to go to hell this darkness that come around him he went into a sleep Darkness come on him he says see that's right in darkness we deserve to be in darkness and outer darkness and to be separated from God what is it it's the curse of the law said but then the light came in and it went in between and it divided those sacrifices so what was supposed to been separated was brought back together by the Light Of God he says see oh I think this is so good brother Mark because this first off God puts Abraham to sleep to prove that Abraham had nothing to do with it isn't that good in other words that you ain't this you you may you may have set it up for me but but but this this sacrifice has nothing to do with he didn't even allow him to perform the sacrifice oh all he did was had it laid on the altar God put him to sleep and then God went to to work on the sacrifice so he showed him that it was not based on his conditions and it ain't based on your it a it ain't based on your abilities or your Merit or anything that you that you could do to deserve it but it was unconditional it's not based on your ability to be able to perform a sacrifice for God to accept you it ain't based on how good you can pray or how good of a Christian you can be or how good of a Preacher you are how good of a singer you are or how much more you do than the next person that ain't what the sacrifice is based on said it was an uncondition he showed it wasn't Abraham's marit but it came in now notice in this process of sacrifice God was confirming the Covenant and he confirmed it by sending a light between the pieces in other words the light confirmed that God had accepted Abraham's sacrifice is there there there there's such a I could preach for an hour on this but there there's something the to realize what it means for God to accept your sacrifice and the presence of God or the presence of that light upon the altar of Abraham the very meaning of that was God saying I have accepted what you've done I've accepted this I've accepted the work I I've accepted this as being satisfactory to God it was a sweet smelling Savor to God see that's that's what we want with our life we want our sacrifice to be accepted by God we want our how many how many say it I I want My Worship to be accepted by God I I don't want to Worship in vain I I don't want to serve God in M but I want God to accept me I want him to accept me in my worship I want him to accept my praise I want him to accept my prayer and and all that I have to give to God nobody wants to give somebody a gift and then they'll take it can you imagine going through all the effort of giving somebody a gift and wrapping it up and making it so nice and maybe you don't have a lot to give and don't have a lot of money to spend but but you you make them a little something and and give it to them and then they would look at so I've had greater gifts than that and they just throw it over in the corner wouldn't even accept a how how would it make you feel see we we wouldn't like that we want God to accept our sacrifice sometimes we don't have a lot to offer we don't have a lot to give God but here he said but I will accept the sacrifice that you give me see it meant something to Abraham for God to come and accept what he was able to give see he said but notice what it meant we that the L came and confirmed that God had accepted the sacrifice he say see what was God showing us that man didn't perform the sacrifice it wasn't our actions but Tom it wasn't our abilities he said but it was God himself showing that he was going to come and be made flesh he would be he would come in the middle of that sacrifice and become the sacrifice that he would be he would be a part of the Covenant that he made with Abraham said that's what he done on on the cross of Calvary God that Jehovah God he took Christ on Calvary and he tore him into two and he set his soul on high and put his body in hell what was he doing he was dividing the sacrifice on the cross of Calvary said but then after he divided it here it laid there it was a great dark time the Bible said Darkness fell upon the Earth but in the midst of the darkness on the third s on that third morning all of a sudden the light of God came down into the tomb and the body came out of the grave and it resurrected again oh let me tell you that was what happened in the natural but there was something happened in the spiritual but God took that same Jesus and he set him on high in glory and here again this sacrifice was separated it was a head separated from a body it was Christ the head of the church separated from the body the Believers that were down on the earth that God wasn't going to leave it that way but just in a few days the Bible said Terry here until you be ued with power from on high and the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come the power of the Holy Ghost fell in the room where they were like A rushan Mighty Wind and the Bible said upon them fell little licks of fire what was it it was a burning lamp that came to bring Unity between one half and the other half it was the light of God that brought them together again but let me tell you something about this light of God it wasn't good enough for God for it just to rest upon them it wasn't good enough for God for the licks of fire to fall upon them the Bible said that they didn't just stay on them but then they were filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were filled with the spirit of God that's why the prophet of God would say the spirit of God is a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the light of God is a Vindication that God has accepted the sacrifice that's why we're Holy Ghost Church that's why we preach in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why we pray until you're filled with the spirit of God because the spirit of God is a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ it's a Vindication that God has accepted the sacrifice on your behalf glory to God takes the spirit of God to confirm the sacrifice takes a spirit of God to confirm that God has accepted it said see that's the same thing today but said if there was no Holy Spirit to vindicate it we couldn't even believe in the resurrection that's why we believe the Holy Ghost think of the story of the Resurrection you know that's the most debated thing about Christianity No One Believes the resurrection they think that that these these unbelievers but you realize he said we believe the story and we accept it because God promised he would not leave us comfortless he knew that it would be all tangled up in this age in the days to come there would be teachers false teachers and all these that would come and have a word and it would all be mixed up but in the end time what would he do he would send a direct messenger what was it it was the Holy Spirit he said he would send a direct messenger called the Holy Spirit which was the Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what God has sent in our hour you realize that you the whole world searching for a proof but that that that very proof of the Resurrection is living in 12-year-old girls in this building the very proof of the resurrections living in little teenage boys in this building because they've been filled with the holy spirit of God and that's the only Vindication that this world will ever see is the spirit of God living in you they're not going to go find a tomb somewhere and take some DNA to be able to prove it they're not they're not going to go to the Sea somewhere and find some proof to be able to prove it but the Bible tells me all the way from the book of of Genesis to the Book of Revelation that that Vindication comes from the presence of God or the spirit of God being present in his church church he said it's a Vindication of the Resurrection can I say it like this if it's a Vindication of the Resurrection it's a Vindication in the United States it's a Vindication in India it's a Vindication in Africa it don't matter where you go in this world they receive the same Vindication that's why Jesus was preaching it that it had to be testified in every language of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that they would go into all the world and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's what Jesus had ordered in Luke 2 four he said he said that repentance and remission of sins would be preached among all nations beginning at Jerusalem ain't that what they did here they were sitting there that day brother Mark and they were praying they were caring all of a sudden when the Holy Spirit fell on them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost they came out speaking in tongues you you know I know I know many people quote this they don't quote it right but a lot of people say well they were speaking in unknown tongues but the Bible don't say they were speaking in unknown tongues they were well-known tongues but the Bible said they spoke spoke in other tongues in other tongues in a way that when the men heard them from other nations they said how is it that every one of us are hearing in our own language how how is it that that I'm from galatia but I hear my own language and this one's from Persia and he hears in his own language and the Bible said there was devout men in Jerusalem from every nation under the heaven was present that day what was it it was the spirit of God manifesting himself and going into those men that they could preach it around the world and fulfill the very words of Jesus Christ every man heard them speaking his own language they begin to say Well they're crazy and they're drunk men and how how are they speaking all these foreign languages where where do they get this from but Peter stood up and he said this ain't this ain't a bunch of drunk men he said this is the promise that the prophet Joel spoke of that I will pour my spirit out upon All Flesh and they will prophesy of the mighty works of God here were men and women that were standing there filled with the Holy Ghost that were prophesying and telling of the works of God and brother said all those that heard him when they repented and they they received the the baptism of the Holy Ghost 3,000 Souls that were saved when they received the spirit of God they became carriers to the world to take that very Spirit or the life of Jesus Christ they didn't take his body they didn't take a piece of his clothes they didn't take a little chunk of the Cross so that they could be represented but they took the very life of Jesus Christ that was born on the inside of them and they became carriers around the world to manifest the resurrection of Jesus Christ a confirmation of his Covenant so here the prophecy was fulfilled and the Covenant was confirmed this is what God was doing the prophecy fulfilled the Covenant was confirmed and Paul said he became the curse for us God AC accepted him by the presence of that great light to see so here he came into the church and he proved to the church that I have accepted this sacrifice that's why Paul would say that the spirit of God would on the Believers through faith faith in what in Christ Jesus say see that's where we are today you realize we have a god that is able I'm going to hurry up we have a god that is able to fulfill his covenants isn't that wonderful by the time he's able to fulfill it you think about it it matters it matters who gives the promise it matters who makes the Covenant because some may not have the ability to perform it but who could heal listen what was the curses who could heal our sickness who could heal who could could save us from destruction who could Deliver Us from poverty who who who would make a way of Escape who would be able to fulfill this curse well notice who it was that spoke to Abraham see before God ever makes the Covenant he first tells Abraham who it is that's talking to him I love this y'all's about preached out but I'm going the Bible says when God came to him the Lord appeared to Abraham see it matters who's doing the who's doing the talking the Lord appeared to Abraham and when he came to him he said unto him I am the almighty God God walk before me and be thou perfect now you know that word almighty God when you look this word up in the Hebrew this word says an El Shai so here God would speak to Abraham and he would say this an i El Shai I am the almighty God when you look into the depth of that word that word El Shai it actually means the bosom or the breast of God so here God is telling Abraham walk before me but here I am the god that is able to give you strength there's going to come a time in this walk whenever you that you have no strength there's going to come a time where you feel like you can't go another mile there's coming a time when you feel like that you can't fulfill this promise or you can't this Covenant can't be fulfilled in your life you're going to feel like giving up you're going to go through stages that you're laying by the wayside there's a you're going to go through times it may be months it may be years that that you just completely give up but I want you to know I am El SHI I'm the place the the breasted God the place where you can go and draw strength from God here you can come to me and you can whenever you get down you can nourish back to strength you you and in one place you'll be able to find healing and you'll also be able to find Salvation brother said it was both part of the New Covenant that God had made with him every part of it was fulfilled in what God was in that name elai he said it was healing for the Natural Body it was salvation for the soul and friends I've got news for you this morning it wasn't just in the Old Testament but Jesus fulfilled that same thing for the Bible said he was wounded for my transgression and by his Tri I was healed so if El Shai provided salvation and healing in the Old Testament it was still El sh die in the man Jesus Christ that provides salvation and healing he said I'll take my wounds upon my body that you'd be able to receive the healing in yours I'll take Strife that you'd be able to receive salvation oh friends in in the Old Testament he was El Shai in the New Testament he was El Shai the Abraham he was El Shi to you and me this morning he's El Shi walk before me and be thou perfect and when you need strength you draw from me prophet of God said it don't matter how you feel God has given us a place to draw from when you feel like giving up he said draw from the strength of Eli draw from the strength of almighty God it don't matter what you look like you say Lord I'm drawing from the promise that you've given to me and it don't matter how you feel you keep drawing it don't matter if you're down you keep dra it don't matter where you been you keep drawing from the breasted God that is able to give you strength he said when you draw from God your strength will begin to renew he'll all of a sudden things in your life will begin to straighten up your arms will begin to move out your heart will begin to to be normal your eyes will be brighter again just keep drawing until you have the strength that you need you say Lord I you promised it and I'm a Seed of Abraham oh how many say that this morning I'm the promised Seed of Abraham and you said it as your child I'm drawing from this promise he said it's thus sayeth the Lord It's thus sayith the Lord he'll give you strength cuz you're the Seed of Abraham I'm El Shi what a what a word to tell Abraham I'm El Shi walk before me and be thou perfect oh God I feel weak I'm El Shai walk before me and be thou perfect God I've already gave up I I've already gone too far I'm else to die walk before me and be thou perfect said draw from the strength of God he said he'll give you strength he said you may say I'm sicker than I ever was he said but keep drawing it may look worse than it ever was but keep drawing you may have gone farther than you've ever gone but keep drawing said you're Abraham's seed so speak like Abraham I stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but I'm strong in faith and I'm giving glory to God for the promise said it would be so and keep on drawing amen he said he's the same El Shai tonight he changes not and his Covenant people have the same privilege to draw from this same resource that Father Abraham had to draw cuz God swore by the same Covenant that he would give us the promise oh that don't that make you want to shout this morning that if Abraham could draw from him hear that God gave you the same promise to draw from God let me tell you friends in the same Covenant I'll tell you what may it just makes me want to shout every time I look at on the news and I see that great nation of Israel you realize the very same Covenant that promised that Israel would be a great nation is the very Covenant that promised that you could possess the promises of God so every time you see that flag flying over there you can just say well praise the Lord the promises of God are true for God gave him what he said he would give them and he'll give me what he said he'd give me and I'm going to keep drawing why because it was the promise of el Shai the almighty God think about it the natural seed is still standing let me tell you a secret I may as well just let it out there there there's no Hamas there's no there's no nation in the world that will ever destroy that Nation I know they make all threats and we're going to wipe it off the face of the Earth but they never will it was promised by God that they would possess that land and that would be their land and they'll have it it don't matter how mad the world they can do the protest and all these liberal wacky things that people get going but you'll never destroy that Nation because God has established it there he set the boundaries he set them in that place he brought judgment against the amorites and amalekites and all those that inhabited that land because of their iniquity and he gave it unto his children and that same God that gave that to them has given you the promise Paul said of the spirit of God to vindicate the resurrection of Jesus Christ where will you see him resurrected you'll see him in you that's where you'll see that's where you'll witness the greatest witness of the Resurrection is knowing what God has changed changed in you when he took the desire to sin out of your life and he put a desire to serve God in you what was it it was a resurrection of a seed that was laying on the inside of you and in the presence of that great life that seed come to life and all of a sudden you realize I'm not the same person that I used to be it's a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ said see if that natural seed is still standing and what about that Faith seed Paul said you are the children of God by faith in Christ for as many as You' have been baptized into Christ you put on Christ there's neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you are all one in Jesus Christ and if you are Christ then you are Abraham's seed and your heirs according to the promise you know what that means if there is still a Seed of Abraham then there's still an El Shai that made the promise he's still keeping us he's still giving us strength now notice according to this Covenant we are his Covenant people I'm going to close with this we are his Covenant people so if we are God's covenant people then we're not living under the curse but we're living under the blessing see so if you're under the Covenant of Abraham then what did Paul say then you receive the blessing of Abraham by a't that good people try to put curses on you all the time but it don't ever work why because you're not living under a curse you're living under a blessing see why it's important to recognize the Covenant that God has has called you in and it's important to find your place so when the Devil comes and says you'll never be able to serve God and you'll never be able to be a Christian you'll never be able to live this life and all these things that he tells you you can go right back to that Covenant say but devil it wasn't you that made the Covenant it was God that made the Covenant with the Seed of Abraham and when I read it right there my Bible says that because I have faith in Jesus Christ that I am that Seed of Abraham therefore the promise that God made to Abraham applies to me see because I know who I am he said you're the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ you're Abraham's seed to see so because we're God's covenant people therefore I'm not living under a curse so Satan can't bring a curse on me for I'm living under a blessing said see because we're living under the blessing of Abraham but Mark then that means we receed the benefits that God had for Abraham and Abraham's seed let me tell you friends I'm not looking for a curse I'm not looking for Destruction I'm not looking for sickness I'm not looking for poverty I'm not looking for failure I'm looking for the blessings of God you say how can you preach it because the Bible promised to me for David said I praise the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits for he forgives your iniquities he heals your diseases he redeems you from destruction he crowns your life with tender Mercy he satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed Like an Eagle it's God that took away our sickness it's God that took away our destruction it's God that filled your mouth and took away your poverty and he gave you the very blessings of almighty God David said and the Lord is merciful and he is plenteous he's gracious and he's plenteous in Mercy he's slow to anger he may he may be angry for a little while but his anger will never will never last for the mercy of God will always override his anger he said he didn't deal with us after our sins listen to The Promise David made God don't deal with you after our sins or reward us according to our iniquities because we're the Seed of Abraham God don't give you what you deserve you know what we deserve death but that ain't what God gives you because you're the Seed of Abraham he said he hasn't dealt with us after our sin he don't deal with us he don't reward us according to our iniquities he don't give us what we deserve oh my can you imagine when you talk to your mom remember when my mama come whoop me when I was a little boy I never went to my mama and said Mama give me what I deserve no never did you find this little boy ever say mama you get three switches then go out there that peach tree Mama I'll pick you the best three switch as you can find and you just give me what I deserve that ain't the way I talk to my mom I don't know about y'all cuz she didn't she didn't care to do it but you know what I said Mama I know you're a just mama oh and your Justice is true Mama but let me just be the first to tell you I know I know I deserve it and I know your Justice is fair oh but the loving kindness oh mama you have such a tender hand that's how I'm talking to my mama Lord mama you have such a tender hand of Mercy mama you you can be so merciful now D dad he brings he brings the law but Mama you're a merciful mama that's way we talk to Mama why we don't want to receive this the justice that we deserve we don't want to we don't want to get what we deserve can you imagine if we had to go down the line this morning and say what you really deserve you deserve death and hell because because of our nature and it's filthy and it's filthy still but God don't give us what we deserve deserve he said we deserve death but he give us life we deserve hell but he gave us eternal life he he gave us a reward a promise of a New Jerusalem friends and I got news for you one day every sinner will receive their reward one day every devil will receive his reward every one day every unbeliever will receive their reward but let me tell you this but so will every True Believer one day you'll receive your reward the Bride of Jesus Christ shall receive her Eternal reward brother marah will walk down the streets of God we'll walk down streets that the feet of the devil have never walked down we'll walk through a gate of pearl that the hands of the devil have never touched we'll we'll see a mansion there that the eyes of Satan have never seen for the Bible said there'll never be anything that ever worked Abomination that would be present in that City we're going to have possession of something that Satan has never touched no wonder he hates you you got a promise of a New Jerusalem that's what one day the very very Vision that John saw it'll be fulfilled he said I saw coming out of Heaven A New Jerusalem to come and sit down upon this redeemed Earth and here when it sat down the streets were paved with gold brother Mark and they went in and out of the city what is it it's the Bride of Jesus Christ the Bible said those that would inhabit that City are those whose names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life it was a redeemed people living on a redeemed Earth a land a New Jerusalem that was built by the Divine architect for his beloved bride amen won't you stand to your feet this morning one day can I say it like this the devil could say it well you're going to get what you deserve but that ain't how God looks at you God says you're going to get what you deserve but he don't think you deserve that because he's a merciful god El should I he's a merciful god Jesus said let your heart not be troubled for in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not true I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you bam said what is it it's the father's Kingdom there's many palaces he said and Christ is in heaven today preparing that New Jerusalem a't that beautiful that there he is today preparing a place for you say well how how do you know he's doing it well look around how do you know he can do it where does he get that gold where'd you get this gold see how's he doing it he's the Creator and that same creator that took 6,000 years to create this world is that same creator that for the past 2,000 years brother Mark H he was building this New Jerusalem just like he was he said there he is don't miss it don't miss this that is where he is right now absolutely preparing that place for you he said how what's it going to look like I love how the prophet said I preached this before but I may as well say it he said it'll be just to her touch he'll make it just to her touch just to your liking the most perfect place that you've ever been brother Mark streets of gold that were created by God 12 gates of pearl that were created by God we'll enter in and out of those Gates made by the hands of God the Creator the most lustrous of pearls that God ever made think about it that transparent Street this is not some fantasy it's a reality that's right that God has created for you and I amen the blessings isn't he wonderful this morning I don't know about you but I don't I don't want what I deserve s I want the mer mercy of God I don't want the curse that's right Paul said you don't have to worry about it church he said Christ has redeemed you from the curse you realize that when he's redeemed you can I can I end with this that because that redemption's already paid for then that curse can never come back upon your life Lord he redeemed you from it it can never come on you again Hall it don't matter how bad it seems he said he's redeemed you from the curse of the law because he took the curse upon himself yes sir therefore that curse don't belong to man no more Christ took the curse you don't have to carry it you don't have to carry that burden the burden of sin I'm going to die I'm going I'm going to go to hell I'm going to get what I deserve he said you don't have to carry that burden I'll take the curse he took the curse upon himself if you could bow your heads tonight you say brother Matt I pray you'd remember me this morning maybe you're carrying that burden carrying the weight of sin the gravity of the curse has been made a reality to you I've got that great weight or pressure on my life where can I take it to Jesus said cast your cares upon me at the foot of the cross that we could lay down every burden he said I will make thy burdens light
