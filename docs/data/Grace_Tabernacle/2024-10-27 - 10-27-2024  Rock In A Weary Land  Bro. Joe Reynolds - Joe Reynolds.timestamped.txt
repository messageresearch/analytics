[44:18] hear them no more it's
[44:21] soundproof hallelujah it's soundproof
[44:23] the world's on the outside gasping and
[44:26] looking in but are looking out but
[44:28] you're on the inside in the presence of
[44:31] the Eternal everlasting God Amen I
[44:34] believe it this morning amen not that we
[44:36] don't know what's we're not uh conscious
[44:39] of what's going on around us and brother
[44:41] Bobby we don't na naturally hear things
[44:43] that are said in this life but down in
[44:46] the soul a been the real you this
[44:48] morning the world is soundproof to you
[44:51] in other words it doesn't change me as
[44:54] Paul would say I am what I am by the
[44:56] grace of God God the things around us
[44:59] doesn't move us Paul said I've been
[45:00] Shipwrecked three times throw in the
[45:02] prison been snake bit he said but Paul
[45:05] said you know what none of these things
[45:08] move me I'm soundproof why because the
[45:11] word of the king said Paul you're going
[45:13] to go to Rome amen snake couldn't
[45:16] stop him hell couldn't stop him the
[45:18] grave couldn't stop him friends when God
[45:21] said Paul was going to Rome he was
[45:23] headed to Rome and none of these things
[45:26] moved him it was pre-planned by God
[45:29] before the foundation of the world you
[45:32] know what
[45:33] happened he made it to
[45:37] Rome Show me one time in the Bible
[45:40] brother Noah that God ever promised a
[45:42] Believer amen that it didn't come to
[45:45] pass if you could show me one place

[45:50] to tell you God's good on his promises
[45:52] he never speaks it if he hadn't
[45:54] pre-planned it before the foundation and
[45:57] already seen you overcoming the reason
[45:59] why I can tell Paul that because before
[46:02] the foundation of the world he saw Paul
[46:05] in
[46:06] Rome and the reason why we've been
[46:08] notified in this hour amen the contents
[46:11] of the will has been read in our hour
[46:13] and told us the very thing this world is
[46:16] not your home you came from God and
[46:19] you're going back to God he but why
[46:21] because you was a part of him before the
[46:23] foundation of the world and he can't
[46:25] lose a one of us isn't that beautiful
[46:28] here this
[46:29] morning it's
[46:31] soundproof what a hiding place what a
[46:35] hiding place it was when the death angel
[46:38] was passing by that night in Egypt there
[46:41] was a bloodline that kept them safe from
[46:43] the plagues of Egypt for Exodus 8 tells
[46:47] us God severed in that day the land of
[46:51] Goan in other words there brother Travis
[46:53] there was snow flies could enter into
[46:57] Goan right there was no plagues God
[47:02] severed a day in Goan he separated
[47:06] it that he said that I may know that thy
[47:09] am the Lord thy God in the midst of the
[47:13] earth I thought brother Joe I'm glad I
[47:16] know him in the personal way this
[47:18] morning when all hell is going on Amen
[47:21] when everything's going on around us
[47:24] amen we lose loved ones amen we know an
[47:27] everpresent help in a time of trouble he
[47:30] don't forsake
[47:31] you Heen he he's not a God that's
[47:35] somewhere way off in the future
[47:37] somewhere but he condescended down to
[47:40] live in humanity and to let the world
[47:43] know I'm still their God and they're
[47:45] still my people and I'm going to keep my
[47:48] Covenant upon my people amen I'm going
[47:50] to be in the midst of the earth Amen in
[47:54] the midst of her she's going to be Flesh
[47:56] of My flesh bone of my bone life of my
[47:59] life power of my power and brother R

[48:06] him
[48:08] Hallelujah a hiding place he
[48:12] severed and
[48:13] numbers brother Wayne took this uh
[48:16] Thursday night
[48:18] and something had been on my heart too
[48:21] so you're going to hear it twice but
[48:24] God's good isn't he numbers 23 15 said
[48:27] he said unto baac stand here for a burnt
[48:30] offering while I meet the
[48:32] Lord you under in the Lord yet and the
[48:35] Lord met balam and he put a word in his
[48:38] mouth and said go again unto baac and
[48:41] say thus and when you come to him behold
[48:43] stood by Burnt offering and the princes
[48:46] of Moab with him and baac said un him
[48:48] what have the Lord spoken and he took up
[48:50] a parable and said rise
[48:53] up baac and hear hearken unto me me and
[48:58] balam got in the spirit brother Brown
[49:00] said and fell into a
[49:02] trance and instead of cursing Israel he
[49:06] blessed them am why is it because God
[49:10] set all of his Laws and Motion right
[49:14] abah to serve him regardless of
[49:18] conditions to fulfill his purpose and to
[49:21] fulfill his plan and if you're part of
[49:24] the Lamb how many's a part of the Lamb
[49:26] this morning thank God he doesn't
[49:28] examine me he examines the lamb we are
[49:31] part of the Lamb we're part we're buried
[49:33] in that sacrifice if he was forgiven
[49:35] that means we are
[49:37] forgiven if it means if he was accepted
[49:39] we are accepted and then we're a part of
[49:41] the lamb and you're the reason for this
[49:44] season no matter how much hell tries to
[49:47] stop you prevent you curse you God's
[49:50] going to make this trial a
[49:52] blessing Hallelujah he said God is not a
[49:56] man that he should lie neither the son
[49:59] of man that he should repent had he said
[50:01] shall he not do as has spoken shall not
[50:03] make it good behold I receive a Comm a
[50:07] commandment to bless and he had blessed
[50:10] and I cannot reverse it and a commentary
[50:14] says God has blessed them determined to
[50:16] bless them and have promised to bless
[50:19] them and complete the he's going to
[50:21] complete the blessing he's going to
[50:23] bring them to a land he has given them
[50:26] it's
[50:27] irreversible and then brother brw would
[50:29] say it like this that church there's
[50:31] nothing it's irresistible Force he said
[50:36] and God will move everything
[50:40] right Hallelujah God is going will move

[50:54] mine amen every promise in the book is
[50:58] mine every chapter every verse every
[51:00] line and it cannot be reversed it's an
[51:04] irresistable Force brother say yet they

[51:09] blessings they could go to the rock my
[51:13] text this morning rock in a weary land
[51:16] they could go to The Rock when they was
[51:19] thirsty they could go to The Rock when
[51:22] they was
[51:23] hungry he said they was thirsty they
[51:26] would drink and just
[51:28] Rejoice they were just carrying on
[51:32] awful right in the midst of a time that
[51:37] balam and baac was trying to bring a
[51:40] curse against the children of
[51:42] God but church we believe it we've been
[51:46] notified about our God in this hour this
[51:49] message that declared to us who our god
[51:51] really is he told us who we are where we
[51:54] came from where we going told us about
[51:57] our future home told us about uh Christ

[53:16] Supernatural that still s Small Voice he
[53:19] says sister Eve don't worry about it I
[53:22] got
[53:23] this I prepl that's what was going on
[53:26] that day man when Bop and baac was
[53:29] coming against the armies of Israel in
[53:32] such a way to take them up the stor the
[53:34] H parts of Israel the bad place of
[53:37] things that they knew as brother Wayne
[53:38] would say they knew that they did God
[53:41] they would God had a law he' had to
[53:43] curse
[53:44] them but God rich in Mercy already had a
[53:49] brazing Serpent and a smitten rock that
[53:52] was already in
[53:54] effect and effect means the power to
[53:56] bring forth results and when God would
[53:59] look down on the iniquity of Jacob he
[54:02] could only see his
[54:05] Covenant
[54:07] Glory that's the rock that God's
[54:10] provided for you and I and they was
[54:14] rejoicing how many can rejoice in their
[54:17] Calamity right now amen sometime brother
[54:19] Mark it's hard to Rejoice am been on the
[54:22] hounds of Hell's on a trail but once you
[54:25] get a revelation inisha that God is ever
[54:28] presentent he knows all things he's got
[54:31] everything under control amen we forget
[54:34] he does it we let we we we get upset but
[54:37] he doesn't we frit but he doesn't he's
[54:40] got everything under control he knows
[54:43] what's going on in your family he knows
[54:45] what's going in on in your children's
[54:49] life and just when hell thinks he's
[54:52] getting enough that's when God says
[54:54] trouble that's enough
[54:58] that's my God this morning oh how many's
[55:01] fell in love with
[55:04] him so if you need healing you can go to
[55:07] the Rock if you need Deliverance you can
[55:09] go to the Rock numbers 23 and 21 says he
[55:13] has not beheld the iniquity of Jacob
[55:15] neither has he seen the perversion of
[55:16] Israel the Lord God this is what I I had
[55:19] in my notes when brother Wayne was
[55:22] preaching this the shout of the king is
[55:25] among them
[55:27] the shout is a jubilant sound a jubilee
[55:31] sound not a sound of defeat not a sound
[55:35] of of retreat but a sound of Victory the
[55:39] Jubilee sound is which is the presence
[55:42] of the Lord their King is in the midst
[55:46] of
[55:47] them Glory when they was bringing every
[55:50] accusation against them amen and they
[55:53] they had evidence that they done it
[55:56] amen but the power of this amen God
[55:59] couldn't see through the
[56:02] atonement the atonement was in effect he
[56:05] said the sound brother Brown notified us
[56:07] to a shout of the voice of the king down
[56:09] there in Israel Israel the atonement was
[56:13] in
[56:17] effect the atonement is the power to
[56:19] produce the
[56:20] results I'm glad the king is Among Us
[56:24] what is the shout of the king
[56:26] amen it was a brazing
[56:29] serpent it was the smitten rock that was
[56:33] already there amen the children of
[56:35] Israel they didn't have to really say
[56:38] anything but the the the Covenant was
[56:40] speaking in their
[56:42] behalf when they would say look upon the
[56:44] perverseness of Israel amen when God
[56:47] would look down he'd see the Covenant
[56:49] that he placed there amongst them it was
[56:52] a shout of a king in the camp it was
[56:56] speaking in their behalf I say he's the
[56:59] same God here this morning he's a shout
[57:02] of the
[57:04] king
[57:06] hallelujah it's the power which is the
[57:09] authority the right the Liberty the
[57:11] strength or the
[57:13] ability to produce the
[57:15] results Hallelujah and brother say like
[57:19] this but where balam fail to see the
[57:21] Brazen Serpent of smitten Rock going
[57:24] before Israel making the atonement
[57:26] it was God's calling God's election
[57:29] there was God people hallelujah he says
[57:32] God had called them to separate them put
[57:34] a serpent before them a atonement in a
[57:36] smitten Rock and balum failed to see it
[57:39] when balam looked upon Israel and
[57:42] brother Wayne brought this out so
[57:43] beautiful he saw the reason to curse
[57:47] them when man looked upon the church he
[57:51] had reason to curse them but when God
[57:54] looked upon them he saw the
[57:57] atonement and brother Brown said he seen
[57:59] you like a unicorn who will put anything
[58:03] in your way how Godly how righteous are
[58:06] the tents that's the way God saw them
[58:09] not the way that man saw them but the
[58:12] great but the way God saw them he seen
[58:17] them pure he seen them white as snow he
[58:21] seen them not guilty does it sound
[58:23] familiar this morning amen we've been
[58:25] not ified the blood speaks of speaks of
[58:29] Freedom it's a voice of freedom and any
[58:32] person that's under the blood is safely
[58:35] protected amen there's power in this
[58:39] Blood the voice of the blood can never
[58:41] be
[58:43] silenced and Satan cannot stand it the
[58:47] Charles he can't stand
[58:49] it he hates
[58:52] it oh don't you love him but thank God
[58:55] for the power of this Blood what can
[58:58] make me whole
[59:01] again thank you brother Wesley nothing
[59:04] but the blood of Jesus Christ this
[59:06] wasn't just ordinary blood this was a
[59:09] sovereignty of God this had nothing to
[59:11] do with man had nothing to do with a
[59:14] woman it was God who's rich in Mercy

[1:00:38] want you to find all the evidence
[1:00:41] against this Blood I want you to find

[1:02:20] to

[1:03:24] to see the pr of
[1:03:27] Israel what about the shout of the king
[1:03:30] that's in the midst of his beloved
[1:03:33] bride

[1:04:33] Jesus Christ that can take this ill Fame
[1:04:37] woman to the place that she's a virgin

[1:04:42] tormented by the power of this blood and
[1:04:46] that was one witness but I can tell you
[1:04:48] I stand a witness of Jesus Christ that

[1:06:19] can repay Satan that sin that you
