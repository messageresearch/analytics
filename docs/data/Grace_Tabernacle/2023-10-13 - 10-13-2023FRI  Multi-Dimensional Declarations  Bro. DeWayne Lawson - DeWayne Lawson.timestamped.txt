[40:26] then people will go by and they'll wipe
[40:28] actions on it and and they'll touch it
[40:30] every which way they can touch it but
[40:32] they don't have the power to touch back
[40:34] that's right but the god that we serve

[42:33] proud of this young man and what he's
[42:35] doing and uh and the blessing that he's
[42:37] been uh I think he's the greatest weapon
[42:40] we have against the enemy for our young
[42:41] people I believe we are to get behind
[42:44] him with all of our heart encourage him
[42:46] and strengthen him amen and it's a it's

[44:48] turn in the Bible
[44:49] tonight uh I want to go to the book of
[44:52] Hebrews uh the 11th chapter I want to go
[44:56] on the first verse and certainly good to
[45:00] be on the platform here that Brother
[45:02] David and brother Vernon playing that
[45:04] music tonight and takes takes me back
[45:07] many many
[45:08] years amen Hebrews the 11th
[45:17] chapter I want to read the first three
[45:21] verses now Faith is the substance of
[45:25] things hopeful
[45:26] for and the evidence of Things Not Seen
[45:30] I like that word there the
[45:33] evidence everybody wants evidence well
[45:36] faith it is the evidence of Things Not
[45:41] Seen for by it Elders obtained a good
[45:45] report and through faith we understand
[45:47] that the world they were framed by the
[45:50] word of God
[45:52] Amen so the things which are seen they
[45:55] were not made of things which do appear
[45:59] so the things you see was not made from
[46:01] things you see they were made from
[46:02] things you couldn't
[46:03] see and this this this is the report
[46:07] that we have tonight we ask the Lord to
[46:09] bless his word tonight as you can be
[46:10] seated I want to take a title tonight
[46:13] and amen and uh the Lord just placed
[46:15] this on our hearts so I want to share it
[46:17] with you uh I want to speak to you on
[46:20] multi-dimensional
[46:22] decorations multi-dimensional
[46:25] decorations
[46:27] I believe faith is a very powerful thing
[46:31] and Faith it is the very foundation of
[46:34] the Christian church amen God has so
[46:36] arranged things that a person that has
[46:39] faith can have everything that God has
[46:41] amen and a person has no faith has
[46:44] nothing so faith is the F fundamental
[46:47] part of being a Christian it's Faith
[46:50] amen faith is that and the prophet
[46:52] teaches us that faith and and you could
[46:54] go through our quite a a little while
[46:56] teach what faith is but I just want to
[46:58] Pi speak on this very point the prophet
[47:01] of God said that faith of course was our
[47:04] six sense and he said we're grateful
[47:06] that we have five senses he said but no
[47:08] means was five senses given to you to
[47:11] guide you they were given to you for
[47:14] Earthly contacten but there was given
[47:17] you the six sense which belong to the
[47:20] Christian and you cannot have the six
[47:22] sense until you become a Christian right
[47:25] it's only way you can ever have any more
[47:28] than five natural senses the natural
[47:30] person but the sixth is better known to
[47:33] the Christian as faith it is the one
[47:35] that governs and guides you it is
[47:37] superior to all other senses we find out
[47:42] that five senses are giving to you that
[47:44] they may contact this Earthly home you
[47:47] know everybody needs their senses that's
[47:49] what allows you to taste feel smell hear
[47:52] those those dimensions of of of the
[47:54] these three dimensions that we live in
[47:57] they need the five senses to activate in
[48:00] them now you know as well as I that some
[48:02] people live without some of those senses
[48:04] they actually able to move and live
[48:07] without part of those senses but isn't
[48:10] it beautiful to have all the senses is
[48:12] it beautiful that a person's able to uh
[48:14] contact this home in every one of those
[48:17] Dimensions but we find out that five
[48:19] senses were given to you by God and they
[48:21] are used but sometimes see when the five
[48:24] senses are contr to the word then
[48:27] they're lying to you so the six sense
[48:30] cannot lie it's the super sense so when
[48:32] the prophet speaks of this that that you
[48:34] got five senses but you know every one
[48:37] of you's been to a m or most of you has
[48:38] probably been to some kind of magic show
[48:40] or you've seen some slide of the hand
[48:42] and you're sitting there looking right
[48:44] at it and a guy fools you because he's
[48:46] doing it by your senses he's using your
[48:48] side and distraction and you you're sure
[48:51] that something happened a certain way
[48:53] and he used mirror and smoke and it Li
[48:55] to you it was a deceiving portion of
[48:57] that and that can be done you can take
[48:59] and you can take it and you maybe you
[49:02] can put one thing under another make it
[49:04] look like something make something smell
[49:06] like something else and that's an odd
[49:07] thing it sometimes you think it's one
[49:10] thing and it's something else so your
[49:11] senses can actually be deceived and they
[49:13] can lie to you so the prophet of God
[49:15] said see then all of the five senses
[49:18] that we have he says now they're lying
[49:20] to you if they're contrary to the word
[49:22] of God but the six sense it cannot lie
[49:27] it is a super sense now that's a good
[49:29] sermon title you can go home and look it
[49:31] up tonight the super sense that's a
[49:33] sermon brother Ram preaches to explain
[49:35] to us Faith sounds more like a testimony
[49:38] service if you listen to it amen but
[49:40] it's a super sense it's a faith sense
[49:42] it's something that don't lie to you now
[49:44] in super sense brother B will say this
[49:46] the super sense is the holy spirit now
[49:49] that settles a lot of matters amen that
[49:52] the holy spirit is the super sense when
[49:54] a man receives the Holy Ghost he's
[49:57] receiving a super sin see the Holy Ghost
[50:00] is the only thing that will always agree
[50:03] with the word of God your feelings won't
[50:05] always agree with the word amen your
[50:07] mental attitude or your your your body
[50:10] language or or your life or something
[50:12] within that sometimes you don't agree
[50:14] with the word of God but the Holy Ghost
[50:16] will always agree with the word of God
[50:19] so the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[50:21] and that's the faith of God that dwells
[50:24] in you now if you let the five senses be
[50:27] yielded to the six sense it'll guide you
[50:29] and bring all the other five under
[50:32] control of the super for it's far above
[50:35] natural senses the spiritual man is
[50:37] above the natural it's as far as high as
[50:39] the heavens are above amen it is five
[50:42] senses it makes you believe things that
[50:44] you cannot see amen it makes you act
[50:47] when you do not think the five senses
[50:49] would ever think about it the devil can
[50:51] get into five senses and lie to you but
[50:54] he cannot touch that super sense he
[50:57] cannot touch that super sense it's far
[50:59] beyond that come from God it's called
[51:02] Faith see the super sense comes from God
[51:04] and just as your five senses were given
[51:06] to you God gave you a super sense but
[51:09] it's not it's it's here to guide you in
[51:12] this life and here's the thing amen the
[51:14] prophet of God says in super sense then
[51:16] what is the six sense to do then brother
[51:19] brandom why do the six cents come the
[51:21] six cents come for this reason say for
[51:24] this reason the six sense is the faith
[51:27] of the super sense the six sense for
[51:29] some of this reason only was it was to
[51:32] make five senses in you deny anything
[51:36] that's contrary to the word of God
[51:38] that's what the six sense is for that's
[51:40] what the scriptures speaks of you know
[51:42] the Bible said casting down reasoning
[51:45] right and anything that would exalt
[51:47] itself above the word of God that's what
[51:50] super sense does it takes a hold of
[51:52] reasoning and cast it down it takes a
[51:54] hold of un belief and it cast it down
[51:57] that's why it was given to you amen
[52:00] super sense is the holy spirit of God
[52:03] that dwells in you amen the six sense
[52:05] comes upon a human being to make them
[52:08] deny anything that's contrary to the
[52:10] word of God any symptom that's contrary
[52:13] to God's promise the six sense says it
[52:16] isn't there is that amazing makes you
[52:18] sound like a crazy man you say it ain't
[52:21] there now I'm not talking about denial
[52:23] like in some of you that work in medical
[52:25] science know sometimes somebody gets
[52:26] cancer and they say the first stage of
[52:28] cancer is denial people say I don't have
[52:31] cancer when they really do have cancer
[52:33] so I'm not talking about denying cancer
[52:35] in that manner because you know how can
[52:37] I overcome brother Rand will tell us
[52:39] this he'll say now real overcoming is
[52:41] recognizing the devil and overcoming him
[52:44] he said let's say someone has cancer he
[52:46] said now overcoming is not to say I
[52:48] don't have cancer he said it's to
[52:50] recognize you you do have cancer and
[52:53] it's to recognize that there is a real
[52:55] devil he said but then you have to
[52:57] recognize that greater is he that is in
[53:01] me than he that's in that hand greater
[53:04] is he that's in me than the sickness
[53:06] that's in my body greater is he that's
[53:09] in me see that's real overcoming and the
[53:11] six sense is in every man woman and
[53:14] child that is received of God to make
[53:16] them deny anything that is contrary to
[53:19] the word of God am is it beautiful when
[53:22] the scripture says let the weak say that
[53:24] I am strong words you might be weak as
[53:26] you ever been and you recognize I am
[53:28] weak but because that you are not you
[53:31] are not defeated but brother you're
[53:34] Afflicted in your body you can stand
[53:36] there and say to Satan Satan I am not
[53:38] defeated anden I am strong because the
[53:41] word of God says I'm strong listen as
[53:44] long as God's word says you're healed
[53:46] you're healed I don't matter how sick
[53:48] you feel he doesn't matter how troubl
[53:50] you feel the word of God has declared
[53:53] over you that you are healed and by my
[53:56] strip you are healed it's not in the
[53:58] future chance it's in the present chance
[54:01] you have already been healed by the
[54:03] blood of Jesus Christ the payments have
[54:05] been made you have already been saved by
[54:08] the payments of God and been Lo last
[54:10] night there won't be no more blood Jesus
[54:13] won't die again he's already died the
[54:15] blood's already been shed you've already
[54:18] been saved you've already been healed
[54:20] and left the Church of the Living God
[54:23] declare that the word of is true in this
[54:27] Dimension no matter what struggles you
[54:29] come
[54:32] to I anything that's contrary to the
[54:34] word of God any symptom that's contrary
[54:37] to the word of God it'll make them deny
[54:40] it it'll make them tonight Romans the
[54:42] 4th chapter I'll give you a scripture
[54:43] for it amen Romans chapter 4 as it is
[54:46] written I have made thee the father of
[54:49] many nations now that this is Romans 4
[54:52] it says speaking of Abraham who was
[54:54] fatherless he was buried and not only
[54:56] baring he was old he was baren and he
[54:59] was old so it wasn't like he was a young
[55:02] man and he was just starting to try to
[55:04] have children he'd been trying to have
[55:05] children for years and can't do it he
[55:07] can't have children and his wife can't
[55:09] have children and God comes down and
[55:12] seemingly mocks him and said how you
[55:14] doing father of Nations amen God called
[55:17] him a father of Nations and he was yet
[55:21] childless and God was calling him a
[55:24] father you see what God was doing is God
[55:27] knows that his word has the power Amen
[55:30] to shape the future of a man God has the
[55:34] ability not to just know what the
[55:36] problem was or what the problem is but
[55:38] God knows the direction of how to change
[55:41] something to make it come out like it's
[55:43] supposed to I love it when God calls a
[55:45] baren woman a a mother of many nations
[55:48] and stars and dust of the earth I love
[55:50] when he begins to prophesy to a man that
[55:52] don't have children and he's the father
[55:54] of Nations because when God says you are
[55:56] you are When God says it's finished it's
[56:00] finished it doesn't make any difference
[56:02] because watch now Romans 4:17 he said
[56:05] before of him whom he believed even God
[56:07] who quickeneth the dead and calth things
[56:10] which be not as though they were amen
[56:13] that call of things be not as though
[56:15] they were and watch what happens before
[56:17] him even whom he believed even God who
[56:20] Quicken the de it amazing how Paul does
[56:22] this he gets talking about this God he
[56:25] said and he the one that quickens the
[56:27] dead amen so what he's trying to do he's
[56:30] trying to say to like me and you
[56:32] standing out here tonight and and or
[56:33] maybe and we see a we see an animal run
[56:36] across there and I said Hey There Goes
[56:37] an animal and and and Brother David you
[56:39] say what kind amen I said well maybe
[56:42] it's a raccoon or it's a cat You' say
[56:44] what kind well he says he says even God
[56:48] so he say see even God but now he's
[56:50] going to tell you what kind of God he's
[56:53] going to tell you what kind of God we're
[56:55] talking about he's telling you the god
[56:57] that quickeneth the dead other words now
[56:59] whatever the situation is if you're
[57:02] above the ground amen you got to know
[57:04] that God is able to deal with your
[57:07] situation the god that quicken foret in
[57:09] other words everything from a dead man
[57:11] being raised Amen to an old body being
[57:14] changed to a Barren body bringing
[57:16] children it doesn't matter what the
[57:19] condition is that you are in it matters
[57:22] the kind of God that is dealing with you

[1:03:34] of Enoch if you can't believe for the
[1:03:36] impossible then get out of the way while
[1:03:38] somebody else beli The Impossible God
[1:03:42] who can change
[1:03:45] circumstances really what God wants is
[1:03:47] your
[1:03:48] worship really what he desires is your
[1:03:50] adoration your adoration your praise
[1:03:53] your worship amen he's God Amen the
[1:03:57] Bible said that faith is the substance
[1:03:59] of things hope for and the evidence of
[1:04:01] things that are not that's right brother
[1:04:04] looking to the unw into the Inward and
[1:04:06] looking to the Unseen brother said the
[1:04:09] inward man did not come from the earth
[1:04:12] it came from
[1:04:13] heaven and that's the Eternal part of a
[1:04:16] human being yeah but yet strange that he
[1:04:18] tries to figure out his own way yeah we
[1:04:21] find it in the scriptures that when a
[1:04:23] man chooses to walk in his own way he
[1:04:25] does what he wants to God just lets him
[1:04:28] alone how many y'all ever been there you
[1:04:32] get you want to do your own thing you
[1:04:33] know you're serving a gentleman God is a
[1:04:36] gentleman if you want to go a certain
[1:04:38] way he'll back up and let you go right
[1:04:40] so far
[1:04:42] right I tell you kind of God he is he's
[1:04:45] a god that'll let things go so
[1:04:49] far amen he let he let Jonah go so far
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:54] but then Jonah found a place to turn
[1:04:57] around thank you Lord you know it's true
[1:05:01] he let Peter go so far and then that
[1:05:05] chicken saved his
[1:05:07] life
[1:05:09] amen y'all know it's true amen them
[1:05:12] chickens that saved every missionary's
[1:05:14] life we eat them
[1:05:17] things that's where it started but P
[1:05:19] back
[1:05:20] there that chicken cowed that third time
[1:05:23] he knew he's that's far enough
[1:05:26] amen we called him for he could get too
[1:05:28] far right cuz he's that kind of God
[1:05:32] he'll let you he'll let you he'll be a
[1:05:35] gentleman and he'll let you go so
[1:05:38] far but thank God he has that place
[1:05:41] where he says that's far
[1:05:44] enough that's far
[1:05:47] enough some of
[1:05:49] you and you thought for sure you was
[1:05:52] about gone and then he tued in a little
[1:05:54] turn around come home brother Tom always
[1:05:57] remind me when brother Brown was up in
[1:05:59] Jeffersonville they come to him you know
[1:06:01] like the Bible talked about Saul in the
[1:06:03] scripture when he lost his mules and he
[1:06:05] went over and and he went to Samuel
[1:06:06] wasn't he with Samuel and ask and and he
[1:06:08] asked for the mules and that's when
[1:06:10] Samuel told him were to find the mules
[1:06:11] and then they anointed him as king but
[1:06:13] he went to a prophet because he lost and
[1:06:15] brother R said the other day he said
[1:06:16] they come to me there's a car sto it and
[1:06:18] they come to me and ask me where that
[1:06:20] car was see there scripture there and
[1:06:22] they asked him where that car was
[1:06:23] brother R said I I knelt down and began
[1:06:25] to pray and he said I had a vision
[1:06:27] remember the car was going uh it was
[1:06:29] going toward Bowling Green y'all all
[1:06:30] know that trail it's going towards
[1:06:32] Bowling Green and he said the Holy
[1:06:34] Spirit convicted that man now there's a
[1:06:36] little bit there I don't teach on it but
[1:06:37] I'll just say this brother man said it
[1:06:39] was something to convict there was
[1:06:41] something that God could still deal with
[1:06:43] that fell and there he was driving a
[1:06:45] stolen car and the Holy Spirit could
[1:06:47] still convicted is that awesome I don't
[1:06:49] want to ever get past the place
[1:06:52] God something tapped on this heart said
[1:06:54] you're doing wrong and need to take it
[1:06:56] home young man tur the car around and
[1:06:57] took it back
[1:06:58] home I always wonder brother man said he
[1:07:01] walked up the car and said when the guy
[1:07:03] got his car back said the the the
[1:07:05] everything was there all of his clothes
[1:07:06] and all his possessions everything was
[1:07:08] there he said only thing gone was a half
[1:07:10] tank of gas and I always thought to
[1:07:12] myself why did God make that man stop
[1:07:15] and fill that gas tank up why didn't he
[1:07:18] bring the whole thing back and then I I
[1:07:20] and and I was just praying about it the
[1:07:22] Holy Spirit struck my heart he said but
[1:07:24] see that was proof of how far it had
[1:07:26] went had it come back with a full tank
[1:07:29] somebody said oh it didn't go that far
[1:07:31] but when it only had that half tank it
[1:07:33] had just enough gas to on it went down
[1:07:35] there and come back and that's why God
[1:07:37] let some of those memories stay with you
[1:07:40] and that's why when he restores you but
[1:07:42] yet you remember a few of those things
[1:07:43] you used to do and there's still a few
[1:07:45] marks around your life to remind you
[1:07:48] amen that you used to be a certain way
[1:07:51] but you ain't that way no more you used
[1:07:53] to be a certain that she
[1:07:56] kind can turn you around and your back
[1:08:00] Hallelujah he's that kind of God he's
[1:08:04] that kind of
[1:08:05] God you must think say see we are not to
[1:08:09] think for ourselves we are to call
[1:08:11] anything contrary to what he said as
[1:08:13] though it was not no matter what our
[1:08:16] eyes claim to be we do not live by what
[1:08:20] we see we live by what we believe
[1:08:25] life comes from what we
[1:08:27] believe not what we see what we believe
[1:08:31] that's what
[1:08:32] matters what we believe about it
[1:08:35] something happens to you amen what you
[1:08:37] believe about it is what matters amen
[1:08:40] what you believe is what takes place in
[1:08:42] your life I want you to watch the
[1:08:44] scripture in Hebrews 11 the Bible says
[1:08:46] it very clearly it said that Moses
[1:08:48] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:08:52] all right that's how Moses endured now
[1:08:54] if you've ever studied Moses's life and
[1:08:56] Moses had some
[1:08:58] endurance he had to endure some things
[1:09:01] you know when God sitting down there
[1:09:02] with that Supernatural sign he had no
[1:09:04] clue there would be people mocking him I
[1:09:07] mean you know you you left the burning
[1:09:09] bush and he had a he had a stick he
[1:09:10] could throw down and come in the snake
[1:09:12] and pick it up and then stick again I
[1:09:13] bet he thought I I mean this is going to
[1:09:15] be the tops and he gets down and does it
[1:09:18] somebody stands up and says cheap
[1:09:19] magician trick and copies the same
[1:09:22] thing come on
[1:09:24] and and that's when Pharaoh's hardened
[1:09:27] heart came because it devalued that that
[1:09:31] miracle and made it just like anybody
[1:09:33] could do it so God didn't tell Moses he
[1:09:37] was going to encounter that he didn't
[1:09:40] tell him that was going to be that way
[1:09:42] but you see what happens is he had to
[1:09:44] endure that and be certain that God had
[1:09:47] sent him to do it when it happened to
[1:09:49] brother R brother R said but notice
[1:09:50] Moses was
[1:09:52] first Moses was first am now I don't
[1:09:56] have time to preach on it I'll tell you
[1:09:58] this where them sticks
[1:10:02] go where did the sticks of James and
[1:10:04] Jamber go said they were right there in
[1:10:06] Moses's stick he said see because Moses
[1:10:10] had the real gift the others wasn't real
[1:10:12] at all they were only
[1:10:15] impersonations when Moses left he still
[1:10:18] had the real
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:20] thing amen you see then you see a son of
[1:10:23] daughter of God and you see them people
[1:10:25] say well that's no such thing as a real
[1:10:26] son or daughter of God cuz I seen this
[1:10:28] guy and he went that way I seen that guy
[1:10:31] and he went that way now see they were
[1:10:33] copies of a real son and daughter of God
[1:10:36] but the real son and daughter of God is
[1:10:38] still
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:41] here you got to endure see you had to be
[1:10:44] able to endure things and Moses endured
[1:10:47] and I think it's powerful that he
[1:10:48] endured it by
[1:10:49] seeing the invisible right that's how he
[1:10:53] did it by seeing the invisible now the
[1:10:55] prophet teaches us from second
[1:10:57] Corinthians Paul will tell us that we
[1:11:00] also can see the
[1:11:02] invisible second Corinthians 4:1 16 for
[1:11:05] which cause we faint not but though our
[1:11:07] outward man perish the inward man
[1:11:10] Remember That Man From Heaven yeah the
[1:11:12] inward man is renewed day by day for our
[1:11:16] Li Affliction uhhuh which is but for a
[1:11:19] moment worketh for us a far more
[1:11:22] exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory
[1:11:25] while we look not at the things which
[1:11:27] are seen But at the things which are not
[1:11:30] seen for the things which are seen they
[1:11:34] are temporal but the things which are
[1:11:36] not seen they are
[1:11:39] Eternal so see the inward man lives by
[1:11:43] renewing his strength day to day that
[1:11:47] day today renewal of strength comes from
[1:11:49] faith it is that what you feed on the
[1:11:51] word of God you must realize real and
[1:11:54] it's important to realize that faith
[1:11:56] will declare the
[1:11:59] Unseen faith will give you
[1:12:02] multi-dimensional
[1:12:03] declaration it will give you a way to
[1:12:07] declare something that's not in these
[1:12:09] three dimensions at all you can't taste
[1:12:12] it you can't smell it you can't feel it
[1:12:14] you can't hear it but you say it's true
[1:12:17] anyhow because you're accepting that
[1:12:20] From Another Dimension that Dimension is
[1:12:23] conted by faith amen when that is
[1:12:26] contacted by faith faith then therefore
[1:12:28] declares in this life something that is
[1:12:32] not seen in this life but you declare it
[1:12:35] anyhow one of the greatest examples of
[1:12:37] this is when Gesa is with Elijah and the
[1:12:40] Syrian Army comes off the mountain and
[1:12:41] they're there to destroy them and it's
[1:12:43] always amazing because Elisha says
[1:12:45] there's more of us than there is them
[1:12:48] and of course Gesa thinks he's a crazy
[1:12:50] man cuz there's a lot more syrians than
[1:12:53] they are these to and Elisha just said
[1:12:55] Lord open the boy's eyes that he might
[1:12:58] be able to see now what he did was he
[1:13:01] opened the eyes he never brought the
[1:13:03] Angels there have y'all ever noticed
[1:13:05] that there wasn't any Angels come on the
[1:13:07] scene they were actually already there
[1:13:11] but Elijah's Ministry opened their eyes
[1:13:15] to what was in the room now you as a
[1:13:18] Believer sitting here tonight is a
[1:13:21] natural carnal man you might look around
[1:13:23] and say I don't see any angels in the
[1:13:25] building I don't see God in the building
[1:13:28] I just see a chch I just see people but
[1:13:31] see it was Elijah's Ministry that came
[1:13:34] upon the Earth in the last day and
[1:13:37] showed this Pride children there is
[1:13:40] something else in this room besides you
[1:13:43] and me the prophet of God tells us that
[1:13:45] the angel of the Lord is in this
[1:13:47] building now he did it in a way you
[1:13:49] could not ever deny it he declared God
[1:13:52] in the building
[1:13:53] so powerfully so Vindicated so real any
[1:13:58] school boy ought to be able to stand up
[1:14:00] and say he's here tonight in the
[1:14:02] building not because I feel an electric
[1:14:05] presence which I do not because there's
[1:14:08] a certain anointing in the room which I
[1:14:10] do feel that amen but I don't declare
[1:14:13] he's here because of that there's a
[1:14:15] higher level of things than the way I
[1:14:18] feel the way I think the way I see
[1:14:21] because what if I didn't feel good what
[1:14:23] I was sick in my body what if I was
[1:14:25] tired what if I was cold what if it was
[1:14:27] trouble then there's got to be something
[1:14:30] you can reach into another dimension
[1:14:33] when this Dimension is dark and
[1:14:35] tormented and sick and unbelieving you
[1:14:38] got to go somewhere house to come back
[1:14:40] and R the dimension you're living in Oh
[1:14:44] Brother I tell you this amen the word we
[1:14:47] are declaring in this age did not come
[1:14:50] from this Dimension will br Ministry did
[1:14:53] not come from this Dimension It Came
[1:14:57] From Another Dimension it was the
[1:14:59] presence of Jesus Christ beared to this
[1:15:03] church no matter how you feel tonight no
[1:15:06] matter the struggle no matter the trial
[1:15:09] no matter what you're going through in
[1:15:11] the name of the Lord the angels are in
[1:15:14] the building the presence of God is in
[1:15:17] the building and you can just begin to
[1:15:19] believe it you can break out of every
[1:15:21] barrier and every Str
[1:15:26] Hallelujah the power of God is still
[1:15:28] real there's got to be a declaration a
[1:15:31] declaration of the Unseen
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] real I was preaching over Africa West
[1:15:39] Africa a few years ago a guy named Eric
[1:15:40] makoko he worked for the voice of God
[1:15:42] for since he was a young child we went
[1:15:45] to Brother Andrew's been there we went
[1:15:47] there and preached in their meetings I

[1:15:51] that building that night when I got got
[1:15:53] home they started sending emails listen
[1:15:56] while you were preaching something
[1:15:58] really odd happened said there was a fog
[1:16:00] moved in around the platform and said we
[1:16:03] couldn't see you no more all we can do
[1:16:05] is hear your voice amen you said
[1:16:08] preacher what is happening do you
[1:16:10] recognize that in this room right now is
[1:16:12] the angels of the Lord do you realize
[1:16:14] all of the glory of God is in this room
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] now you realize the Angels the Bible
[1:16:22] said that the angels of the Lord encamp
[1:16:24] about them that
[1:16:27] [Applause]
[1:16:28] fear I'm going stand I'm going to stand
[1:16:31] on this word I don't care how you feel
[1:16:34] I'm going to stand right with a
[1:16:36] Vindicated prophet and declare what the
[1:16:38] truth
[1:16:39] is I'm not declaring this because of my
[1:16:43] good feeling I'm declaring this by a
[1:16:45] Vindicated voice from the M age but I
[1:16:49] can believe I can't believe my own life
[1:16:51] I can believe it but I can't believe
[1:16:53] believe the preacher or I can't believe
[1:16:54] the church and I can't believe the devil
[1:16:57] I can't believe my friends there is a
[1:16:59] voice that we can't believe he is a
[1:17:02] voice of Mali for that said I am here to
[1:17:06] declare he is
[1:17:09] here hallelujah it's the only thing I'm
[1:17:12] sure of he is
[1:17:15] here he in this
[1:17:19] SPI Declaration of that come from a
[1:17:22] prophet who said I am God's voice to
[1:17:26] you break Brother come on come on you
[1:17:29] see here's a prophet that stands there
[1:17:33] in a visible
[1:17:34] realm and declares an invisible
[1:17:38] realm people thought he was crazy uhhuh
[1:17:41] until he started telling them the prayer
[1:17:44] uhhuh they thought he was crazy until he
[1:17:47] said well when you were about 8 years
[1:17:49] old you were running up a steps of the
[1:17:50] house and you were wearing a little
[1:17:51] checkered skirt and the dog bit you and
[1:17:53] you've been carrying nervousness your
[1:17:54] whole life is that right you see then
[1:17:58] they had to
[1:18:00] admit somebody here greater than this
[1:18:03] man
[1:18:05] William amen you see because this was a
[1:18:09] messiah sign given to the age to declare
[1:18:13] the realities of God to a church that
[1:18:16] had lost the hope and the realities of
[1:18:19] another dimension now
[1:18:21] today I believe we have a right to
[1:18:24] declare it as a prophet declar I love
[1:18:26] how brother brandom says it in my
[1:18:29] redeemer he said just imagine today that
[1:18:31] his presence is here now the Lord Jesus
[1:18:34] is in another world or another dimension
[1:18:38] right here in the form of a
[1:18:40] spirit right here in the building now
[1:18:43] amen our eyes can't see him because
[1:18:46] they're physical yet unless there would
[1:18:48] be something that we could see the
[1:18:50] vision but here is just as visible he's
[1:18:54] just as real as the day he spoke to Mary
[1:18:57] at the grave or cleopas on the road to
[1:19:00] amus and you've read those stories and
[1:19:03] you thought mine wouldn't be good to run
[1:19:04] into the Lord on a walk in the afternoon
[1:19:07] right but the prophet said he's here
[1:19:08] just as real right now in this building
[1:19:12] his presence is here and I love how he
[1:19:14] says it and it can be felt amen he said
[1:19:17] with an inner charge that's on the
[1:19:19] inside of a human being called the New
[1:19:21] Birth the soul has has been magnetized
[1:19:24] unto him and once in a while I love it
[1:19:27] you you got dry days you got jeury days
[1:19:30] you got sometimes a little bit rougher
[1:19:32] Services than others you've all been
[1:19:33] there but brother R said once in a while
[1:19:36] you begin to let your mind be
[1:19:38] concentrated on him begin Believing on
[1:19:40] him and after a while something a
[1:19:43] reality you begin to feel something
[1:19:45] sweep over your being it's a Vindication
[1:19:48] of his
[1:19:50] resurrection you know if if you just
[1:19:53] begin to set your mind on it and this is
[1:19:56] one of the greatest one of the greatest
[1:19:57] Troubles of the church today yeah is
[1:20:00] there's too many other things on our
[1:20:03] mind come on y might as well get real

[1:20:28] things on your mind that you forget amen
[1:20:31] that if you could just begin to
[1:20:33] concentrate your mind on the Lord the
[1:20:35] Bible said 120 were gathered in the
[1:20:37] upper room and they got in one Accord
[1:20:40] and that wasn't one Accord against
[1:20:41] something it was one Accord believing in
[1:20:43] the promise of the coming of the Holy
[1:20:45] Spirit when they begin to focus on that
[1:20:48] they begin to forget about everything
[1:20:51] else yeah I wonder what it would cost
[1:20:54] you to forget everything else tonight I
[1:20:57] wonder if you forget the little troubles
[1:20:58] that you share the little little
[1:21:00] feelings and

[1:21:30] get in the presence of God and people
[1:21:33] that are a thousand miles from this
[1:21:35] meeting you get in such a contact with
[1:21:37] God that you'll shake them out of their
[1:21:39] beds and Cancers can be healed

[1:22:54] like he's in the building amen the
[1:22:56] presence of God becomes more real and
[1:22:58] more real and more real until it begins

[1:23:04] God will tell us this he said the gift
[1:23:06] of God he gave me to work was by visions

[1:24:50] nowhere we have and we have seen the
[1:24:53] resurrected one by side you have more
[1:24:56] evidence that Jesus is Alive than any
[1:24:58] man since the history that met him
[1:25:00] personally like Apostle
[1:25:03] Paul you have more evidence can I just
[1:25:05] say this if you want to hold a trial
[1:25:07] tonight and you want to put somebody on
[1:25:09] trial to prove the evidence that Jesus
[1:25:11] lives there is no greater evidence on
[1:25:14] this planet than the ministry of William
[1:25:17] Brad there was more done in that
[1:25:20] Ministry than there was the entire life
[1:25:23] of Jesus when he was on the
[1:25:26] earth
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] right see but it wasn't brother random
[1:25:33] was doing
[1:25:34] it it was the ministry of Jesus
[1:25:38] Christ that's why we don't worship the
[1:25:40] prophet amen we worship the God he
[1:25:46] worshiped can I just say it since we're
[1:25:49] here we're all much can I just say it
[1:25:52] you don't put on don't don't you dare
[1:25:54] try to put on this church that we
[1:25:56] worship William Brown Don't You Dare
[1:25:58] come around some some old devil trying
[1:26:00] to tr trying to make it like these
[1:26:02] people worship brother Brown that's the
[1:26:04] biggest lie that's ever been
[1:26:06] told that might be somebody somewhere
[1:26:09] that does it but this little church and
[1:26:11] these people here have been directed to
[1:26:14] Jesus Christ in the power of his
[1:26:17] resurrection you might want to worship
[1:26:19] Jesus in another well we just want to
[1:26:22] Jesus you mean the one that was on the
[1:26:24] cross back there well I got good news he
[1:26:26] rose up on the third day and he still
[1:26:29] alive and he's still working he's still
[1:26:32] doing Miracles the Jesus I worship I
[1:26:36] worship the Jesus that come on and
[1:26:40] change of
[1:26:43] heart Jesus we going to worship
[1:26:49] tonight I I realiz I realiz by my
[1:26:52] Approach some people might think I am
[1:26:54] entirely crazy I I I I I I give you that
[1:26:58] that's okay you think I'm fanatical
[1:26:59] that's okay the prophet of God said
[1:27:01] everybody thinks faith is fanatical
[1:27:03] except the one that has it and the one
[1:27:04] that gave it to
[1:27:08] it but I can show you in science my
[1:27:12] faith is
[1:27:13] true the the the nature testifies with
[1:27:16] my faith death B and Resurrection it's
[1:27:19] the only thing that nature agrees with
[1:27:21] as Christian
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:24] don't speak for Muhammad but it speaks
[1:27:27] for the death burial and Resurrection
[1:27:28] the son every day 24 hours every day you
[1:27:31] can see the birth of Christ the death of
[1:27:33] Christ the resurrection of Christ every
[1:27:35] day every spring you can see you can see
[1:27:38] the flowers come out of the ground and
[1:27:39] they all testify he has risen from the
[1:27:42] grave from the dead heart denomination
[1:27:45] risen but that Resurrection wasn't just
[1:27:47] for Jesus it was for the Church of the
[1:27:50] Living God that they raised out of the
[1:27:52] page tunes and out of the Lutheran tunes
[1:27:55] and out of the denominational tuns that
[1:27:57] shut God away from the people but this
[1:28:00] message come to open the door to bring
[1:28:02] people back to
[1:28:05] God I have proof I even signs proves
[1:28:08] what I'm telling the truth now it's a
[1:28:10] it's a you know when Paul said declaring
[1:28:13] the Unseen when he talks about looking
[1:28:15] to the Unseen to endure or looking to
[1:28:17] the Unseen when Paul said that there was
[1:28:19] no radio or television at all yeah right
[1:28:21] how
[1:28:22] how odd that must have seemed to the
[1:28:24] people for him to say look to the Unseen
[1:28:27] and that's how you're going to overcome
[1:28:29] but in the age we live in yeah isn't it
[1:28:32] odd that television and movies came in
[1:28:36] in the same age a prophet came to the
[1:28:37] Earth right is that odd yes sir I mean
[1:28:41] at the same time watch how it starts out
[1:28:43] it starts out with just motion picture
[1:28:45] real staticy black and white no color
[1:28:48] and look at the
[1:28:49] advancement look at the advancement they
[1:28:51] added voice
[1:28:53] they brought Clarity they brought color
[1:28:55] and to now it's almost a living reality
[1:28:59] in the room with you right because it so
[1:29:02] declares another dimension
[1:29:05] right radio you you can turn on radio
[1:29:08] right here in this building while I'm
[1:29:09] preaching you can listen to something
[1:29:11] else completely different and the voices
[1:29:14] of people that's never been in Arkansas
[1:29:16] can play right in this room that's right
[1:29:18] so even science declares that is a multi
[1:29:22] dimensional declaring age that it's the
[1:29:25] age when science is declaring it a
[1:29:29] prophet of God was declared because it
[1:29:31] is a junction of Time and Eternity and
[1:29:35] if you watch scripture every time that
[1:29:37] Time and Eternity begin to have a
[1:29:39] junction God filled that Junction with
[1:29:42] angels and he filled that Junction with
[1:29:45] Supernatural because he wanted to turn
[1:29:48] his children a certain way yall know the
[1:29:50] Bible said Ministry spiritual sin from
[1:29:52] the presence of the Lord do you know it
[1:29:54] actually says that they're ministering
[1:29:56] Spirits unto The Heirs of the promise of
[1:30:00] Abraham now what's that mean to you
[1:30:02] ministering Spirits never came on the
[1:30:04] earth until Abraham's seed came on the
[1:30:07] earth angels that don't show up in the
[1:30:09] Bible until God gives seed to
[1:30:13] Abraham every time an angel showed up in
[1:30:16] the Bible it spurred the people toward
[1:30:19] the supernatural right
[1:30:22] Angel never came for a natural
[1:30:25] movement Angels always inspired people
[1:30:29] to the supernatural side of life so they
[1:30:32] inspired Mary to believe but she didn't
[1:30:35] have a child she didn't have a man she
[1:30:37] was not no way to believe but the Angels
[1:30:40] said to believe it am because Angels
[1:30:42] declare the supernatural you see right
[1:30:45] here in this room there are colors there
[1:30:47] are dimensions and I I don't have time
[1:30:49] don't have pictures but I can even show
[1:30:51] you the pill of fire that was there with
[1:30:53] Moses that was there with Paul has came
[1:30:55] down into this age the angels of the
[1:30:57] Lord are here in the room brother said
[1:31:00] you can't maybe see them but you could
[1:31:01] feel the influence of
[1:31:03] them isn't that amazing you can feel the
[1:31:06] influence of angels how many how many's
[1:31:08] ever been in service you was I've seen
[1:31:09] some of you right here in this service
[1:31:10] how many ever been in service and all
[1:31:12] like you feel like something just
[1:31:13] charges
[1:31:15] you the point hit a certain way
[1:31:18] just you feel charged you know what that
[1:31:20] is that's influence of angels that's
[1:31:24] Angels influencing you to believe you
[1:31:26] know what Angels done you know what they
[1:31:28] always done what they were created for
[1:31:31] worship for millions of years they
[1:31:34] worshiped God Amen isn't that amazing do
[1:31:37] you know the book of Isaiah says that
[1:31:39] when Isaiah saw the presence of the Lord
[1:31:41] he saw the Holy Temple feel it he said
[1:31:44] that that voice of one Angel shook the
[1:31:47] temple post that was there brother said
[1:31:50] think about that one Angel could shake
[1:31:53] the voice one Angel could move a post of
[1:31:55] a of a temple one Angel he said there's
[1:31:59] millions of them in
[1:32:00] heaven he said what must it sound like
[1:32:03] in
[1:32:05] heaven what must it sound like in heaven
[1:32:08] with a million angels that have never
[1:32:10] come on now that never knew sin that
[1:32:14] never knew condemnation that never in
[1:32:16] trouble they don't even have a reason to
[1:32:18] worship they've never been safe for
[1:32:20] nothing they never delivered from
[1:32:22] nothing they never had any success that
[1:32:25] come from the blood said he said but God
[1:32:28] was so holy that he literally had to
[1:32:30] cover the Angels had to cover their
[1:32:31] wings he said they had to take their
[1:32:33] wings and cover their FA just to say
[1:32:35] holy in the presence of God he said but
[1:32:37] see by the blood of Jesus Christ you can
[1:32:40] step in the presence of God you can
[1:32:43] stand in the presence of God and give
[1:32:46] back worship I tell you that with that
[1:32:48] thought in mine tonight we ought to
[1:32:50] worship like nobody wor not because we
[1:32:53] just want to make some noise but because
[1:32:56] he's worthy of our worship because he
[1:32:58] saved UNS he healed my body he touched
[1:33:02] my life he delivered my
[1:33:05] heart I like it's too loud you going to
[1:33:08] be in
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:14] trouble now you know the prophet of God
[1:33:17] said I I'll just read this one quote I
[1:33:18] know you love it he said sometimes he
[1:33:21] says he says you say I feel a strange
[1:33:23] feeling here tonight looks to me I just
[1:33:25] want to cry shout or something he said
[1:33:27] that's the angels of the
[1:33:30] Lord I take five minutes right now
[1:33:33] angelology would that be
[1:33:35] something demonology y'all yall know

[1:37:24] it's too late for me it's a
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:28] lie it's not
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:34] true every human being is a spirit and
[1:37:37] you have to break from one dimension to
[1:37:40] another that's a prophet yes sir he said
[1:37:43] you are a spirit and you don't have to
[1:37:45] go anywhere but sitting in your seat you
[1:37:50] can move out of depression into
[1:37:54] Joy you can travel sitting in your
[1:38:00] seat said one time what we need is more
[1:38:02] Soul
[1:38:03] travel he said see what's traversing the
[1:38:06] prayer he said so traveling that's what
[1:38:09] happens you travel out of something into
[1:38:11] something else you travel by the spirit
[1:38:15] you can travel now Willam brandom
[1:38:17] literally traveled you've heard you've
[1:38:19] heard witchcraft people talk about they
[1:38:21] get out of their body and go try to put
[1:38:22] curses on stuff in people listen a true
[1:38:25] prophet in this age left his body and
[1:38:27] went places and come back and said to a
[1:38:30] man your house is this color your your
[1:38:32] floor is this color your child is this
[1:38:34] sick this is what's happening because he
[1:38:36] went there and come back and then LED
[1:38:39] people into Faith to believe I've
[1:38:41] already been there and God's going to
[1:38:42] change the situation amen because he
[1:38:45] knew a man could travel if a man can
[1:38:47] travel in his spirit and I can tell you
[1:38:49] this tonight if we could teach you how
[1:38:51] to break out of your spiritual barrier
[1:38:55] you can find the home you can find what
[1:38:57] you're looking for you can find the
[1:38:59] desire that you're searching for because
[1:39:01] you can break out every
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:06] time now I I'll just read what a prophet
[1:39:09] said he said he broke all the sound
[1:39:11] barriers amen amen and all the reason
[1:39:14] barriers and went beyond reasoning and
[1:39:17] beyond anything else Jesus went beyond
[1:39:21] all
[1:39:23] reasons wouldn't that be wouldn't that
[1:39:25] be amazing tonight if I said you could
[1:39:26] receive the Holy Ghost you said well I
[1:39:28] can't because see that's a
[1:39:32] reason you you give me a reason why why
[1:39:35] somebody can't be saved you give me a
[1:39:36] reason why somebody can't be healed you
[1:39:37] give me a reason why Jesus went beyond
[1:39:40] the
[1:39:42] reason and look at the power of that
[1:39:45] because he says you can do the same
[1:39:47] thing you can take God at his word and
[1:39:50] go beond the reason brother ad said this
[1:39:54] is an astronaut
[1:39:57] age a preacher what are you talking
[1:39:59] about it's the age that man broke out of
[1:40:04] Gravity Man didn't just break the sound
[1:40:06] barrier in this age he broke the gravity
[1:40:10] barrier in this age he literally went
[1:40:13] beyond his own abilities and God gave
[1:40:16] him away and brother BR said any man or
[1:40:19] any woman he says God been able to do it
[1:40:21] by his church a spiritual people who
[1:40:23] will believe a man or woman who will
[1:40:25] dare at any time to take God at his word
[1:40:29] is an
[1:40:31] astronaut now the prophet says in faith
[1:40:34] of Abraham you'll never receive the Holy
[1:40:35] Ghost in his fullness you'll never walk
[1:40:37] in the spirit of God until you totally
[1:40:40] separate your things from unbelief amen
[1:40:43] you got to get away from the world you
[1:40:45] got to come out of the world and Sh
[1:40:48] brother says it doesn't take too much
[1:40:51] prayer it takes some
[1:40:54] believing that's powerful Church CU I've
[1:40:58] seen peopleall that have met barriers in
[1:41:01] prayer because they just wouldn't
[1:41:04] believe anybody that's been in church
[1:41:06] long has seen it you've seen people that
[1:41:08] visit the altar almost on a regular
[1:41:10] basis and they weep and cry and they go
[1:41:12] back to their seat and they got the same
[1:41:13] problem they had when they came up they
[1:41:15] went cuz they're praying and they're
[1:41:17] praying and they're praying let me tell
[1:41:18] you what a prophet said he said you can
[1:41:20] pray till you get blue in the face but
[1:41:23] until you change your
[1:41:26] confession until you change your
[1:41:28] confession now long does it take it
[1:41:29] takes trust it takes trust to change
[1:41:32] confessions and there ain't nobody can
[1:41:34] come up here and take your sin away
[1:41:36] there's nobody can give you a wife
[1:41:38] across the head or a shake of the hand
[1:41:40] to take away the problem you're having
[1:41:43] come on Amen what removes the barrier of
[1:41:46] your problem is your absolute faith in
[1:41:48] the blood of Jesus Christ you look at
[1:41:51] that blood and you say Satan I'm no one
[1:41:53] get you but the blood P the price for me
[1:41:57] and I will not carry this another day
[1:41:59] but by the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:42:02] believe I'm saved I believe I'm Healed I
[1:42:05] believe I'm forgiven now your faith has
[1:42:08] took a hold of the promise of God and
[1:42:11] you're ready to get outside the Buri
[1:42:13] you're ready to take off out you know
[1:42:16] you while because you made no longer
[1:42:19] hell
[1:42:21] come on you make a ritual out of prayer
[1:42:24] come on Muslims pray Hindus pray
[1:42:26] Christians pray and believe they don't
[1:42:29] just pray and pray and pray they believe
[1:42:33] the word of
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:38] God by gra you are saved and that is
[1:42:41] true
[1:42:43] faith and everyone of them that believed
[1:42:46] be baptized in the name of Jesus it
[1:42:48] didn't say come and pray for 5 hours

[1:42:54] a you'll make a way for the devil to
[1:42:57] cause somebody to Totally Miss God
[1:43:00] because they keep praying and praying
[1:43:02] and praying when the answer's already
[1:43:05] here when the power of God is already
[1:43:07] released what you need is Faith to break
[1:43:10] into that soul and say Yes Lord I
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:17] believe I know that's theologically
[1:43:20] challenging
[1:43:23] you're saved by what you
[1:43:26] believe come now you're healed by what
[1:43:29] you
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:33] believe so at some point you got to and
[1:43:38] I believe in prayer folks it's the most
[1:43:39] powerful weapon there
[1:43:41] is good but if you're praying without
[1:43:45] believing come on you know what I'm
[1:43:47] talking about right amen Lord go do Lord

[1:50:59] your heart you want to be a Christian
[1:51:01] but there's something won't let you be a
[1:51:03] Christian is that right he said I say
[1:51:06] it's the devil and that's unbelief do
[1:51:09] you believe that I said Do you believe
[1:51:11] if I ask God he'd break the power of
[1:51:14] that
[1:51:16] unbelief do you know people sitting in
[1:51:18] this room right now would have been
[1:51:20] saved when they was comeing to the age
[1:51:21] of canil I seen them I seen people that
[1:51:24] would have been saved I I watched my
[1:51:26] nephew Jared I watched him for years you
[1:51:29] all know Jared no matter where he God
[1:51:32] what he done he talked to me I said God
[1:51:33] going to get
[1:51:35] you cuz I can see it in than Lord I
[1:51:39] remember when Matt was in seventh grade

[1:51:44] way even Sarah got married and he was
[1:51:46] going his own way he can tell you this
[1:51:48] and I take him out to eat not hang out
[1:51:50] with them something other people say

[1:51:53] your
[1:51:54] time but I can say
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:51:58] something I could see that if that
[1:52:00] Spirit of unbelief would get away from
[1:52:02] that seed he would lead people to God I
[1:52:05] seen an influential person that would
[1:52:08] influence others if he get that Spirit
[1:52:11] of unbelief away from him he'd be a

[2:04:46] you've watched them year after after
