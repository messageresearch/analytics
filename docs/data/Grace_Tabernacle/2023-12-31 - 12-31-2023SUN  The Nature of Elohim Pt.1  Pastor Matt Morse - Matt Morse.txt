Liberty in this place in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the church says amen amen may God bless you this morning we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the Book of Genesis in the first chapter and the first verse and then we're also going to read uh from Deuteronomy the 6th chapter and the fourth verse so I'll give you just a moment uh to find those scriptures Genesis 1 and one Deuteronomy 6 and4 amen you love the Lord this morning amen what a privilege it is to be in the house of God Amen just to gather around God's children it just touches my heart to to look and and to see each one of you here this morning I thank God for you I thank you thank him that you would he would have men and women today that'll stand upon the word of God Amen how many loves the Lord amen how many loves your brother beside you your sister across the room amen amen do you love everybody that's the way you know that you love the Lord that we have love one for another amen God bless you this morning we want to read Genesis 1 and one the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and now we'll read from Deuteronomy the 6th chapter in the fourth verse this is Moses writing he said here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up you shall bind them for a sign upon thy hand and th shall be the frontlets between your eyes and thou shalt ride up on the post of thy house and on thy Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought you into the land which he swear unto the fathers of Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not isn't it something how God would give he said he would give you great cities which you built not Houses full of all good things which you filled not whales that were dug which you did dug not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plest not but when thou shallal have eaten and be full then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage but thou shal fear the lord thy God and serve him and you shall swear by his name and we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings uh to the reading of the word this morning and I want to speak on this subject on the nature of Elohim here uh we read this scripture to speak or to swear by his name I I believe that we ought to pray we heard this uh brother spoke this Wednesday night to pray for Revelation more than anything else how many believers do we have here this morning how many believe that that that that uh statement we ought to pray for Revelation more than anything else you say brother Matt why is that our brother was speaking Wednesday night he asked this question which I thought was a was a wonderful question he said which would you rather have would you rather have education or Revelation I pondered on that a little while I thought it was a I thought it was a good question to bring to the hearts of people he said would you rather have education or revelation of course he didn't know that last Sunday it went right along with what we were speaking on on the trees that God had placed in the Garden of Eden one being the tree of of life and other being the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and and so we see how that God has always put this question or put this uh uh uh the the this choice in in amongst humanity is to be able to gain knowledge or to gain Faith or to gain life or or or to eat of this tree of knowledge and so uh but but when we see this we spoke on that last week I I get to thinking about this knowledge and some sometimes people take this and they they go a little over the other side with it and and they get a little bit too far off and and and then and in some backwards thinking that God's people don't need to know anything and that's not true it Ain it ain't that God don't want you to have knowledge it's just the right kind of knowledge it didn't that God wants you to not know anything I know uh that that there are men in this world today that they want people to be ignorant of the word of God you say well why would people want you to be ignorant it ain't really the man but it's the it's the spirit that the man's anointed by but he wants you to be ignorant why would the spirit want you to be ignorant of the word because if you're ignorant of God's word then that man can have control over you or that Spirit could have control over you so so if they know more than you well then you're always beneath them and they're always higher than you and you always had to go for the answer you realize that's the same spirit that Martin Luther had combed in the Catholic church because the church had set themselves up over the people of God and the people were ignorant of the word of God they wouldn't even allow them to have a Bible that they could read in their own language because they didn't want them to have the word because the word of God would bring Liberty to the people of God so you see how that the devil would come and and to bring bondage if he's going to keep the people of God bound then the best way to keep them bound is to keep the knowledge of the Lord out of the hearts of people where they don't know who they are and they don't know where they going but friends let me tell you something about Revelation Revelation doesn't make you ignorant Revelation actually brings knowledge it I know many people misunderstand knowledge that it's wrong or it's no good because they say well educ brings knowledge and that is true it certainly brings knowledge but the reality is is that Revelation also brings knowledge see but it's a different kind of knowledge see whenever you read the book of Daniel the Bible says in the end time knowledge shall increase but as knowledge increases people move further away from God so it doesn't matter how much knowledge they gain they're farther away from God today than they were in the days of Daniel or in the days of Paul or in the days of Peter people continued to get further away from God even though they advance in knowledge even the Bible would say it like this the Bible says they are ever knowing but never come to the knowledge of the truth do you realize that they're ever knowing they ever have knowledge but yet they're not coming to the knowledge of the truth so there's one knowledge that didn't do them no good but there's another knowledge that God is calling us to as the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the this is the knowledge that Peter I may as well just speak to you what's on my heart this morning but this is the knowledge that Peter had spoke of he said he said he said whenever you have the stature of a perfect man it wasn't a knowledge that come from the world brother Wesley but it's a knowledge that came from God it wasn't a knowledge that came from education but it's a knowledge that came by the revelation of the word of God it's a Godly knowledge the knowledge to know the things of God the knowledge to know who you are and where you come from and what was our existence brother Mark and what and and where we're going to and this is this is a Godly knowledge how to handle ourselves as the Bride of Jesus Christ in the world that we live in today in the in the craziness of 2024 that we're that we're approaching brother M but to have the knowledge of God to be able to be able to go forward in this life you say brother Matt what kind of knowledge is this anyway here's what Peter said he said besides this remember he's talking about building a man or building a Christian or a Believer he said besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue what knowledge and knowledge Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and charity he said for if these things be in you and the bound they will make it that you will neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ so Peter tells us if you'll have these things in you then you'll be able to stand in the last day if you'll have these things in you then you'll be able to bear fruit if you'll have these things in you then you won't be a Barren Church but you'll be a church that's able to produce the very life of the one Jesus Christ but Peter said but he that lath these things is a blind man he that lath these things he cannot see a far off and he has forgotten that he was purged by his own sins he said wherefore rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall if you'll have the knowledge of God and brotherly kindness and virtue and and these things and patience and godliness the very the very things that God has given to us Peter said if you'll have these things you shall never fall I love reading this because you see in one place the Bible said well we didn't need that knowledge in the next place Peter said you must have knowledge I think this is so wonderful because when Peter uses this if you read this in the Greek it's actually a different word knowledge it ain't it ain't y like like to have the knowledge that the world has but the Greek word is josco let me tell you what this means Peter said you must have knowledge the knowledge the word josco brother Wesley it means to properly to know something especially through a personal experience in other words it's the knowledge by a firsthand acquaintance this is what the word josco means in other words it means to experientially know something so it didn't just knowledge or head knowledge like the world would put in you or something that you would try to to gain by education but this knowledge Peter speaks of he said it's an experiential knowledge it's something that isn't gained by reading a book it's something that isn't gained by by by trying to further yourself in education but the only way to gain it is to have a firsthand experience it's an acquaintance with something I thought it was so wonderful that this is the same word that that that Mary uses when the angel comes to her and he says unto her you will bring forth a son and you shall call his name Jesus and the Bible said Mary turned to the angel she said how can this thing be for I have not known josco I have not known a man friends let me tell you this morning Mary knew what a man was she had knowledge of a man she had knowledge of what men were she had a knowledge of men all around her but there was something that she didn't know she didn't know one by experience she said I had haven't known josco I haven't known a man he just says so how can this can't be this is the kind of knowledge that Peter said that we had to have it has to be a personal experience with the one Jesus Christ to have the knowledge of God or the experience of God it's an experiential knowledge that's what Jesus said he said when they come to me in the last day they'll say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name have I not cast out devils in thy name have we not have we not done many wonderful Works in thy name and he said I'll say unto you depart from me you worker of in iniquity I never knew you josco I never knew you I didn't have that knowledge of you we didn't have a personal acquaintance we it wasn't an experiential knowledge but brother Mark the Bible tells us we ought to have a knowledge a knowledge of God a knowledge that come by experience brother B would say it like this he said that's the problem that was the difference between Satan and Jesus Remember When say well you may as well preach with me just a minute it's it's the last service of of 2023 make it the best but whenever they came there remember when Satan took him up on a mountain and he tempted him by the word of God he said the difference they both knew the word but they knew the word differently Satan knew the word by knowledge he said but Jesus knowed it by experience he said he knew it by Revelation he knew he was the son of God he knew he' come into the world for a reason he knew where he was standing brother Mark he knew he was born into the world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of God could work through him because he knew what he was that's the only way to be able to defeat the devil is to know who you are it's to know where you come from it's to know where you stand it's to know that that God has called you for a purpose that's the only way you'll ever defeat the Devil brother Mark is to have an experience a real experiential knowledge with the Lord Jesus Christ it ain't coming and sitting in some church somewhere and feeling yourself full of a bunch of head knowledge and going out and trying to quote it it's having an experience where the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the very word that you're reading is living on the inside of you and you're manifesting the life of God and the believer say Amen it's a knowledge by experience so that's the reason the word could work through him because he knew who he was friends I got news for you this morning Satan wants you to be ignorant you say why does why does Satan want me to be ignorant because if he has you ignorant he can rule over you but how many knows this when Apostle Paul would preach Paul said there's four things that the church should specifically he said there's four things that you should not be ignorant of how many knows that he told the Corinthian Church he said do not be ignorant of Satan's devices so here's four things that Paul's going to lay out in the Bible that you need to make sure you're not ignorant of in other words you need to have a knowledge of these things he said the first one is don't be ignorant of Satan's devices you say brother man what's that mean don't be ignorant of the plans and the deceiving the the the the the the tricks that Satan has know the snares that he would lay before you don't be ignorant uh in in in the in the year coming forward maybe in 2023 maybe you fell into some traps and maybe Satan trapped you and maybe he got you caught up in the middle of the night somewhere doing uh things you shouldn't do or or thinking things that you shouldn't think and he and he laid a little trap and you walked right in the Trap and he got a hold of you but Paul says don't be ignorant of his device you say brother man how can I overcome that well now you've had an experience with it now you you've experienced something you you've gained a little bit of knowledge about the tricks of the devil and Paul says don't be ignorant of his plan I say this as a pastor this morning don't be ignorant of Satan's device don't be ignorant of what he's trying to do to the Church of the Living God don't be ignorant of the spirit of the devil that would come and sit right down amongst Believers and try to take the spirit of God out of the out of the Church of the Living God to keep God from being able to move and speak to his children and change hearts and lives don't be ignorant of the trick of the devil that would try to keep your hands down when God desires praise don't be ignorant of the device of the devil that would keep you from singing praises unto the Lord the very thing that would bring a blessing upon your life don't be ignorant of his devices don't be ignorant of his device when he said well don't say amen and don't get into the service and and my you ain't going to get nothing out of it anyhow there ain't nothing different than the other don't be different than Satan's device say today is a different day it don't matter what happened yesterday but today is a new day I believe the word of God I'll stand on it I'll get behind God's word and I'll let the spirit of the Lord move amongst us again don't be ignorant of Satan's devices he's always trying to defeat the believer you say brother Mar what what what do we do he said well God gave us a way to defeat him it was the word of God the revelation of God's word is the only way you'll ever defeat the Devil you think about it but manam said God he could have give his people anything to defeat the Devil with he would have done it he said and so when God he said I always say this when God makes a decision that's the best that there is he never has to alter his decision said the first decision God Made In the Garden of Eden was to combat the enemy with his word they were fortified behind the word but notice Satan because he knows your nature brother Mark so here comes Satan along in the garden when they were fortified behind the word of God they had established the word of God as the only thing that would defend them from the from the uh the the the Ws of the devil and so he said they would know their nature so he studied Eve until finally he found the best strategy he could use on her was that she would reason with the word of God that's why that's what caused the fall in the garden is because she reasoned with the word of God well maybe that's right but you know what I I don't if I can live just like that well I'm sure that was okay for somebody maybe that was for another age but I just don't think God can heal like that anymore I just don't think I I had to live like that anymore see it's it's reasoning with the word of God that's why we as a body of Believers that we never want to reason with God's word somebody say Amen you say well what do you do you just believe it you don't reason with it you believe it you don't re you don't try to explain it you just believe it you don't try to figure it out he said you just believe it for how can you you figure out God anyway somebody enlighten me so I'll know somebody tell me how you figure out God anyway and your vast knowledge I there the the men of today they're so wise beyond their years they know everything but how do you figure out God you explain in this finite mind how that you would look at a universe and and and and figure out God and the vastness of the world that we live in and how that God in the beginning would create a world and speak worlds into existence and I off the palm of his hands that he would blow stars and universes that he would be able to create as somebody help me to understand that how would you even be able to figure out God bam said see you can't figure figure out God he said the word isn't made to figure out it's just made to believe he said and that is the strength of the believer today is just to accept God's word you want to know where the strength of the church is is to accept the word of God you want to know where your power over the devil is your victory over the devil is to accept the word of God your strength over Satan is to accept God's word your mind right now your mind goes to race saying but I got to figure that out I I got to make that statement fit and I I got to make that if you could ever just surrender to the word of God this morning and say I ain't maybe not ever going to be able to figure it out but I'll just believe God's word and I'll live it to the best of my ability the Bible says his ways are past finding out but we believe it Paul said don't be ignorant of this thing next thing second thing he said don't be ignorant of the mystery concerning Israel and the Gentile he said that God in other words God had a time that he raised up this great nation of Israel but then there come a time a new dispensation when God would turn from Israel and he would Minister to the gentile people how many knows that's the age that we're living in now that's our dispensation can you imagine that he God he carved out of space and time just to minister to you here whenever you weren't a people of God but he made you people of God isn't that isn't that something you you you wasn't born of this lineage of Jacob or or Abraham of their natural lineage but here God has made a place for you and I he said don't be ignorant of this thing that God he'll go save Israel in their time but right now he's working on the Gentiles know that it's our age know that it's our dispensation know that it's the time that God is dealing with this church the third thing he says to the Thessalonian Church don't be ignorant of this one thing he said Brethren concerning those that have fallen asleep unless you would sorrow like the rest of the world when they would lose a loved one and there's such sorrow because they'll never see them again there's such sorrow because they've been taken from their life there's such sorrow because they can't put their arm around him and they can't hug him and they can't and it'll never be that way again but Paul said don't sorrow like the rest of the world don't be ignorant of this thing because it's a promise that came from God he said for our sorrow is not like theirs that has no hope he said our sorrow has hope in other words that we he said for we believe that Jesus died and he rose again and God will bring him with or with those with him that sleep in Jesus he said that we say by the word of the Lord that they which are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord they will not proceede those that sleep but he will descend from heaven with a shout and a voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise he said don't be ignorant of that thing what's he trying to he's trying to set the church in order don't be ignorant he said then then he goes on the fourth thing don't be ignorant of the gifts that God has placed in the church he said concerning spiritual gifts I would not have ignorant but the diversity of gifts but there's one Spirit In other words there's all kinds of members of this church but we're not all the same he said but we're all led by The Same Spirit that's why you don't go attack another churches another Minister they're all led by the it's the same Spirit God calls one man to to be one way or have one gift or do it and every man's not going to be the same every Pastor is not going to be the same every church is not going to be the exact same because the ministry isn't the exact same is it something they're preaching the same word you say what makes them different Paul explains this he said there's difference of administrations but there's the same Lord he said there's a diversity of operations but it's the same God that worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit for one is given the spirit of wisdom and the other the word of knowledge but they have the same Spirit he said another is given Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles by The Same Spirit to another prophecy to another the Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues it was different gifts but it was all by The Same Spirit I that something listen what Paul's telling us don't be ignorant church can I just say it in my Arkansas way don't be ignorant of these things as you go into this new year don't be ignorant of these things that God has called he has a lot of a space and time for this Gentile church that God has called a gentile people in order to be one with God and ain't not one of us going to be a liive and every one of us have have different gifts and one of us may have a gift of Prophecy and the other one may have a have a gift of healing and he said but it's the same Spirit we're diverse in there but what we are you going to win anyway we're going to go with him in the Rapture we're going to meet the Lord in the air and if some of us would fall by the wayside along our journey then don't you worry they're going to be with us in that day don't be ignorant church have the knowledge of the word of the Lord see Revelation mark it set you apart Revelation gives you faith I didn't mean to get this long into this Revelation gives you Faith you say well that doesn't Faith come by hearing we sure it does that's what the Bible says but you realize Revelation is actually what gives you Faith you said see brother says see whenever you could be living your whole life and all of a sudden you come to a service or somewhere and you would hear the gospel being preached how come that one person would hear the gospel and you know the Bible says faith cometh by hearing he said but Revelation comes by hearing he said how come that one person there would be two people sitting side by side and the word of God goes forth and this one would hear it and receive it and he would gain faith and the other would never get no faith out of it they both heard the exact same word so it can't just be the hearing with the ear that would bring Faith to the people but there had to be something greater that would give you Faith he says see so Revelation comes by hearing one man right beside you he says I don't believe that stuff it's nonsense I don't believe it it's just like they did on the day of Pentecost when they came out brother Jared they were worshiping God they were filled with a of the day said they thought they were drunk on new wine but it didn't matter to them he said they laughed at them and said they're filled with new wine he said but it didn't matter to the others he said because there was a great thing that was happening to them so they didn't care about the world laughing at them because there was something great that was happening on the inside of them friends let me tell you this morning you may be sitting in the house of God and the word of God goes forth and something begins to steering your heart don't worry about how everybody else reacts don't worry about what everybody else does what matters is there's a a great thing that is working on the inside of you maybe it's a guy by you he didn't get nothing out of it maybe the lady across the road maybe she didn't get nothing out of it but don't worry they can laugh at you if they want to but there's a great thing that's working on the inside of you they can make fun of you if they want to but there's a great thing that's working on the inside of you he said While others laughed these just kept on rejoicing glory to God that makes me feel like having church this morning let them laugh if they want to but they just kept on rejoicing while the others cofed they just kept rejo that's the way I feel about this church let them make fun of us if they want to but I'm going to keep on rejoicing let let them call us what they want to but I'm going to keep on praising God let them let them put us down if they want to you can call us what you want but I thank God that he saved me I thank God that He gave me a place of worship I thank God that He gave me brothers and sisters to have Fellowship I thank God let them say what they want but we're just going to keep on rejoicing let them say let them talk how they want to we keep rejoicing reing he said it was an individual Revelation which is faith faith that's revealed see our faith brother the Mark is a product of our Revelation the greater Revelation that you have then the Revelation is going to bring Faith but it only comes it's not just hearing the word with a natural ear but it's hearing a word that is revealed in the heart see when a revealed word comes brother Mark it gives you such a faith such I get to look at this last night and or all day yesterday yesterday thinking about these Revelations that God has laid in the Bible you find in the first verse in the Bible which we read is one of the greatest Revelations that lays in the scripture the Bible says in Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth how many knows what that word God is in Hebrew it's Elohim says so in the beginning Elohim created the Heaven and the Earth this word Elohim for the mark it means the Lord God or the great one the all efficient one the strong one the almighty God the self-existing one this is the god that created the heavens and the Earth he was self-existing but the mark that means God was there when there was no air God was there when there was no light he was there when there was no Earth and no stars and no solar system there was there was no Universe there was only God he was self-existing you realize that friends that just to have the knowledge with your head knowledge of Elohim in the beginning it bypasses human understanding to even understand Elohim see because our nature what's your nature do look at all of humanity over the past 6,000 years the very number one question that Humanity has tried to answer is where did I come from so they come up with all these theories of of where men came from and how we came from this cell and this big old Atomic blast or and they make shows about it and movies about it and they have a they have they have entire uh uh uh sections of colleges and universities that are dedicated to that very thing of understanding the conception of human life where did we come from because of our nature that's on our nature our nature is to want to know where we came from isin't that something that's why in your own nature or your own mind you could never even understand God because the question would be well God was self-existing he was there when there was nothing and your nature would say but where did he come from well he was just there but how is he just there he was just there but what put him there well nothing put him there he was just there are you with me right now see our our understanding cannot even fathom it because our buildup is that we were created somewhere in our human this flesh man brother Mar it came by creation and so we're always looking to Creation where did it come from how did it start what is the origin of it so we couldn't even understand the basic first thing in the Bible by our own knowledge is that God was a self-existing god you can't even prove it by your own knowledge there ain't no great education no matter how educated you ever become you'll never be able to prove that thing that God was a self existing God you there there's no way to show it where did it come from said see our nature asked this where did we come from he said but the revelation of the name Elohim watch this brother Wes it's the Revelation that shows how Christ would even return in the age that we live in to me it's one of the greatest revelations in all the scripture to be able to recognize Christ in his present form a this something what good is a God that you can't recognize what good is a God that you can't talk to what good is a god of History what good is he being so great but he but he but he ain't nothing to you to see but to be able to recognize him now watch what what what helps us to be able to see God is there's a principle you can Malachi the third chapter the sixth verse the Bible says for I am the Lord and I change not here's a principle that God lays in the scripture this is how that we can recognize God we got to have this as a foundation we're going forward in 24 we got to have this as a foundation that God is a God that does not change he said I am the Lord and I change not Hebrews the seven or in the book of Hebrews Paul says wherein God would more abundantly to show The Heirs of his promise the immutability of his counsel now that word immutable means unchanging over time or unable to be changed so Paul says here God is making a promise to The Heirs and to these heirs This Promise he's going to give is by the immutability of his counsel so for God to be immutable Paul says that God used two immutable things one that it was impossible for God to lie and then God swore an oath it did something so Paul said that God wants to make sure that you're able to accept this that one that God doesn't change he cannot lie and the god that can't lie is the one that made the promise so that you don't have to worry about it whenever God put it in his word it was put there that that it would never go away see brother B said see immutability it means unchangeable this is a principle that you have to have that God is an unchanging God somebody somebody catch that this morning he's an unchanging God he said he's unchangeable he cannot change but he has to remain the same so if he ever healed one sick person he can't change his attitude if he ever forgave one sinner or one prostitute he couldn't change his attitude if he he's immutable he's unchanging of God's word if he ever said in one place I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases then he has to stay with it because he's an infinite God sometimes we give our word brother Mark and we have to change it because we're not infinite we're finite sometimes we'll say brother I'm going to do that I I'm going to do it next week I promise you that you don't have to worry about it it's going to be done next week rolls along something happen circumstances and all of a sudden you sayy brother I'm so sorry I meant to do that but next week it's going to be the week see sometimes we have to change circumstances that cause us to have to change our our word or change our mind but you realize brother R says notice God is not that way he don't change his mind that means whatever he thought about you in the beginning he still thinks about you right now oh that makes me want to preach that Manan it don't matter how bad you got it don't matter how far away way you got from God whatever God thought about you he can't even change his mind about you if he if he created you in His image then he still thinks of you that way today it don't matter where he has to go to get you why cuz God is going to build you back to the way he made you he said we don't change we change our word God always keeps his he say so the question isn't on the word the question is whether you believe the word or not so there's our our principle that we're basing all of this on is that God can't change his word can't change he cannot change how wonderful is it that God cannot change that's why Jesus would say if you can believe then all things are possible so it isn't that God ain't doing it anymore but it's can you believe it it is that God a ain't moving amongst his children anymore but it's can you believe it see God's word is true is is God's word still true is it still inspired is does he still do the same thing is he still a Healer is he still a savior is it still true in 2024 you know there was a there was a story of of a little woman one time her son was off at a seminary school and she got real sick and so they called him and they said you that your mom she's on her deathbed and so just hang on by the phone because we're we don't know what's going to happen to her they're taking her to the doctor and so the he waited around next day they they called him back they said don't worry everything's fine everything worked out he said well good praise the Lord he went on to school few months later he gets out of Seminary and he comes back home to his mom and and you know they got to visit in hadn't seen her in a while finally he says mom you know there's something I meant to ask you he said you remember here a few months ago when you when I was down at school and and and and you you you you were sick and they said that you know something had happened that night and he said you everything was well he said what what what what was wrong with you what what what medicine did they give you the you know what the doctor do to make you well overnight he said here they told me to wait by the phone that you might be on your deathbed he said the next day they told me all was well he said what did the doctor give you that could allow you to be well overnight she said oh son I I didn't have an opportunity to tell you she said but it wasn't nothing the doctor gave me at at all she said but there was a little Mission down here a little church and and there was a couple sisters in there and they got it on their heart when they were in their prayer meeting and they got it on their heart to come and pray for me and so they got their pastor and they came over there and their Pastor sat down in our living room and he got to explaining to me Mark the 16th chapter and he told me about how that God would heal the sick and how how that that the commission was given to the church to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover she said and they laid hands on me and that all that stuff went away from me that very night and I woke up the next morning and I was perfectly well oh my she got to praising God she said my wasn't it wonderful and her son he got a little worked up he said now mama he said no I hope he said now I hope you didn't go over there and start going to church with them and stuff like that she said well honey what do you mean he said well I'll have you know I spent four years in a seminary school and the scripture that they quoted you he said we were actually taught in seminary and proven by theologians that that scripture was not even inspired by God and that little woman got the shouting she said Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord he said oh mama what's the matter with you she said well I've read of all the promises that God has laid in the Bible and just to think that if God could heal my body with a scripture that wasn't Inspire then what about all those that are is I thank God that there's still a word that is inspired by God let me tell you friends Paul said all the scripture is good for Doctrine all scripture is inspired by God it's God's word word and if he ever wrote it he still means it today he's an unchanging God with an unchanging word it's inspired by God yes amen it's something we can build on you can build your family on you can establish your family on it and build it and in 10 years from now you don't have to look back and think you made a mistake this is the year of 2024 friend you say I want to build my life I want a greater life I want everything to work out better build your life on the foundation of the word of God establish your in God's word and allow God to be able to build for you it's a real Foundation now watch this Paradox here the god that don't change I'm going to hurry God that don't change here but when you see God if God doesn't change but when you see God in the scripture isn't it something that every time God presents himself to somebody he always does it differently you notice here you read the Bible says God he doesn't change he's the same God but then when you read about Abraham he goes down to the tent here comes a man that that walked down by Abraham brother Mark and he picked up food and he sat there and ate and had fellowship with Abraham he showed he came to him as a man but then when Moses met him he was a burning bush the god that don't change one day he was a man the next day he was a burning bush the god that don't change the next time we find Gideon over hiding behind a wine press and he comes to Gideon as an angel the next time we see Joshua and Joshua meets him when he's getting prepared for battle to go in into Jericho and the Bible says Joshua met him as the captain of the host he wasn't Abraham met him as MDC Joshua met him as the captain of the host Daniel met him in a in the Lion's Den as a pillar of fire brother said here here was a pillar of fire whenever when the Hebrew children met him brother Mark he was a man the fourth man walking in the fire isn't this something that here is a God that don't change but when you see him but a Mark he's different and every it just seems he's he's different he presents himself in a different way but was Christ that would come in every age Ezekiel saw him as a will in the middle of the whe Abraham said I saw him as mecdc John whenever he looked out across the Wilderness he said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world see he saw him differently but now watch this when you read about this word Elohim brother the mark do you realize that the name Elohim is not a singular word in the Hebrew language Elohim is actually plural so instead of Apple say apples because there's many matter of fact this word Elohim is the very word the very first scripture in the Bible is the word that people use that denominations use to prove the Trinity well there's a father and a son and a holy ghost there's three Gods because right in the Bible it says Elohim his name's Elohim and after all Elohim is a plural word so there must be more than one God because they are them Elohim it's a plural word really is but notice I thank God brother Mark that when you read something see there's a difference way we read and way the the world reads sir see we're not reading it with a question we're reading it with an answer is it something to live after a prophet comes can you imagine living in the age before there was a prophet and you didn't know the answer and everybody it was all this debate and confusion but we're reading it after the Prophet come see see notice he said Elohim the the Elohim certainly it's a plural word but the plurality of Elohim doesn't refer to multiple gods but the plurality of Elohim is not many gods but it's many attributes in one God amen So when you say all of this as as plural then you say well God the Healer God the Savior God the comforter God the Father God the mother oh friends don't you realize it's whatever you have need of he's the same God that heals you he's the same God that heals your diseases he's the same God that comes to you in the Midnight Hour when you need a when you need a comforter by your bedside he's the same God that that that that will save you when you're lost he's the same God the plurality of Elohim is the attributes of almighty God don't you realize that that's what God was everything that was in Him Sister Debbie it was something on the inside of this self-existing God he was a father but he had nobody to be a father to he he he was a mother but he had nobody to be a mother to the very attributes the the nature of God all this was in God's nature he was a Healer but there was nobody sick to heal he was a savior but there wasn't nobody lost that he could save he was a God but there was nobody to worship him so he couldn't be God and it drove him to create it drove him to make life said inside of that was attribute this attribute which meant he was inside the great l or Elohim was an attribute he said you know what it was it was the nature of God he said inside of him was the nature to be a father but he was self-existent there wasn't nothing to be a father by inside of that was a nature to be a God but the god is an object of worship and he was self-existent so there was nothing to worship him inside of that that was a savior but there was nothing lost nothing could be saved inside of that he was a Healer but there was nothing sick that could be healed nothing to be sick to see do you get the picture they were God's attributes and his nature listen friends he said his nature produced what is today the desire of God to be a Healer produced what is today the desire of God to be a father produced what is today the desire of God to be a a savior produce what is today that he could manifest himself as a savior now is this something that this the plurality of the word Elohim brother the Wesley the Old Testament we find that many ways names that he was called by matter of fact he was called by the Redemptive names the seven Redemptive names they all had a different meaning one called him Jehovah Gyra you're my provider one called him Jehovah Jam or shama he's present with me one call him Jehovah Shalom he's my peace one said he's Jehovah nessi he's my victory one Jehovah rehea my shepherd one Jehovah sidono he was my righteousness one called him Jehovah rapi he's my he's my healer he was all those things it it didn't matter what name that they used he was all of those things but notice even though he was all those things listen what Moses writes Deuteronomy the 4th chapter he said here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord now can I read that to you in Hebrew it says Shema Israel Yahweh Yahweh Elohim EAD Yahweh the Lord our God is one Lord Yahweh Elohim EOD Yahweh the Lord our God is one Lord but the Mark here although he would manifest himself in so many ways here when it was written of him Moses would make it plain that God he will come and he will he he was met him in a burning bush and Abraham did meet him as MZ dig but Abraham but but when he writes to that he said Elohim the Lord Our God Elohim is one Lord It's Elohim he's one God but Mark he came to Earth as a baby no wonder whenever they they saw him when he was born in a manger that they couldn't accept him as God because they were looking for something else but he came in a way that men had overlooked the very gift that God had brought to the world here here that they had brought him that God had brought him this way and they would they would look at him and they couldn't they couldn't accept him can you realize that they were looking for this great big God but all of a sudden how could they how could they even understand that Elohim would come in the form of a baby well don't you know brother that Isaiah prophesied that a virgin shall conceive and maybe the men of that day said well we believe that we we believe that she she could conceive but that don't you know but but but but we don't know that that was it and you know they're always they they couldn't apply it to him cuz they just couldn't see El him in a Manger the self-existent one the god of Heaven even though they couldn't they couldn't recognize think of it here Moses recognized him in a burning bush everybody else didn't recognize him that way they took the word of Moses other whenever Abraham met him and and he fed him at the door here Abraham had a faith that his wife didn't even have she was laughing at the promise had she known that was the god of Heaven standing there the creator of Heaven and Earth maybe she wouldn't have laughed so much see but Abraham knew him they saw him as who he was but here he goes through every age brother Mark as an unseen God he comes into every age revealing himself to a people but they don't see him in the in the form that he's in here when he came in a Manger they didn't see him in the form that he's in but watch what David says in Psalms 45 and6 he says but thy Throne oh God speaking Elohim thy Throne oh Elohim is forever and ever and the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter listen here here David writes of it thy throne oh Elohim is forever and ever Paul picks it up in the Hebrews the 1 chapter in the 8th verse he said but unto the son he was speaking thy Throne oh Elohim is forever and ever here Paul lets you know he said the Elohim that David was speaking of was the very Son of God it was Jesus Christ so it wasn't just God in the beginning the very God Of Heaven was Jesus Christ he said th the son he saith thy Throne o Elohim is forever and ever here Paul tells us right Hebrews 1 and8 that the Son of God is Elohim it is God the self-existing one that man Jesus that they crucified it's God the self-existing one he fulfilled the very scripture his righteousness is the scepter of the Kingdom backa said he would be born in Bethlehem Hosea said he'd be called out of Egypt but when you meet him today for the west of you know him by the name of Jesus Christ you know him by his name Jesus you said well how do I know it was Elohim well listen what Paul said Paul or Peter said he said let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus who you've crucified both Lord and Christ the son to the son he said thy Throne o Elohim isn't that something that he called the son Elohim he said the same Lord in Christ that Peter spoke of was the same Lord in Christ that Moses was writing about oh you ever notice this in Mark the 16th chapter and I'm going to hurry and close you ever notice in mark 16 at the beginning of it the Bible says when Jesus was risen the first day of the week he appeared to Mar Mary Magdalene first out of whom he had cast out Seven Devils remember he had just resurrected he appeared to Mary Magdalene first I've never really caught this in this way the next verse it says and she went out and told them they had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her they believed not and after that he appeared in another form unto them two that walked and went into the country a't that something that just after he appears to Mary Magdalene the Bible says but he appeared to them in another form the same God the same Elohim he appeared to him in another form and they went out and told the disciples but they didn't believe them either and afterward he appeared under the 11 as they set at meat Jesus came to the 11 and he up braided them because of their unbelief he had braided them because of their Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him him after he was risen isn't that the condition of the world today that they would believe not them that has saw him after his resurrection you can go and testify of all the things that you've seen God do and vindicate his resurrection but they didn't believe those that saw him after his resurrection but I think it's something see he appeared to Mary Magdalene in one form he appeared to them on the road to EMAs in another form but Mark here he is today he's an unseen God I'm going to close you may as well just preach with me a minute he I know y'all getting tired God bless you but I I know I am but it's I tell you but he's an unseen God but Mark he's an unseen God he in the world when they look to him they look for God they find him they they look for a god with nail scarred hands they're looking for a crown of thorns that they can identify Christ they're looking for something that they can look to and they can put their hands on and say now we have God but he's an unseen God you realize this is the very thing even though the Bible would tell us that's what the brother he would take that very thing he say but the Bible never promised you'd see him with NS cardan that's what the world is full of today it's a bunch of doub and Thomases that are that are looking today let me see the hands of Jesus let let me put my fingers in his hand but you'll never see him that way in this world that we live in I know there was a great Revival some men told me of when I was doing missionary work in India they said you've got to you got to go over into uh into I forget the Iraq or or or Saudi Arabia or somewhere you got to go over there the greatest Revival that's ever struck the Earth they're actually seeing Jesus walked down the road I said I wouldn't want no part of that because my Bible tells me differently I don't care what you're seeing but it sure ain't him cuz the Bible says he won't be there until after the Millennium he wouldn't even be walking upon the Earth that so you don't have to look for him walking on the earth anybody could dress like Jesus and put nail prints in his hands Hollywood can put can put a crown of thorns on a man's head and walk him down in front of you if that's all it takes to believe anybody could produce that but he didn't promise to come that way he promised to come by the word of God and it would be manifested in the preaching of the word would produce the very same thing that it did when Jesus Christ was walking on the earth he's an unseen God remember when John the Baptist came preaching brother Wesley when he came down there he preached he said there's one among you who you know not how many knows that today you couldn't even use that scripture there a you can't even use that no more CU it don't even fit it a't be no different than you saying Noah telling everybody that there's a flood coming there's no flood coming you can't even use the scripture of John the Baptist there's one among you who you know not you can't use it in that way cuz today it's no longer an accurate statement today you know who he is here John was standing amongst a group of people and here Jesus was walking and nobody knew that he was the Christ but notice what John done what what he done brother Mark is he made him known you remember what Paul did when he went on Marsh Hill is that not the same thing Paul did he went up there on their on their altar there was an inscription that said to the unknown God Paul went right up in the midst of them and he went to preaching but Mark he said let me he said let me declare unto you he said I've seen your altar it said to an unknown God he said but you ignorantly worship him but I want to declare to you that the god that made the world and in all things therein seeing that he's the lord of the Heaven and Earth he dwells not in temples made with man's hands neither is he worship with your hands that he needs something from you for he's the one that gives life to all he's the one that gives breath to all he's the one that gives all things to us and he has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the Earth it's God that made men that determined our limits of our habitation determined the the time that we would be appointed he said and that you when you would seek after the Lord he said don't worry if you'll feel for him you'll find him cuz that Creator Elohim is not far from you what was he doing he was making God known to the people you look for a God you're praying to an unknown God you get down on your knees and you're calling out oh god of Heaven somewhere oh come and help me Lord you you know how I need you and how that people today they're praying to a god an unknown God but Paul said but let me make him known unto you if you're seeking after God it's because God put a desire in your heart to find him so if you're seeking him you shall find him cuz he's not far from you let me make you known what was he doing he was declaring God he made him known to the people he said for in him we live in him we move in him we breathe in him we have our being without him we wouldn't even exist We Are The Offspring of Elohim We're The Offspring of God he said listen he's appointed to this day to be the judge of the world in righteousness he by one man that he has ordained he would be the judge of the world but he ha given Assurance unto us in that he ha raised him from the dead what did he do he preached they were looking for a God that was unknown and he made him known to them and the man Jesus Christ the resurrection said what was he doing he was preaching in the power of his resurrection to make him known friend don't you realize that's the same thing that happened today he made God known to the people he used a Prophet by the name of Paul to go down there and preach to him and say let me make him known unto you friends the same thing happened today it wasn't Paul it was a prophet named William brandham but when he preached he proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ what was he doing he wasn't trying to build his own Ministry but he was making God known to the people that had lost their way that had been wrapped up in spiritualism and formalism and denominational uh denominationalism and they' got so wrapped up and they needed a way out and God sent a prophet right down amongst his children to to to vindicate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and to say he ain't some God of History he ain't a dead God he's not a bygone God but he's the same yesterday today and forever and what he did back then he'll still do today he made God known to the people and let me tell you what happened the same thing happened today well you say well what's going to happen well I'll tell you what happened in the days of Paul and that'll show you what'll happen today the Bible says when Paul made Jesus known that many of them mocked him for what he said many of them made fun of him some of them scoffed at him others said well we'll just talk about it later is that not the same thing today some was cough he's made the Resurrection on some made fun but the Bible says I love this heart here's our portion the Bible says how be it there were certain men that clave unto him and believed majority they wouldn't they wouldn't believe it the majority they wouldn't accept this man Jesus that was being Vindicated his resurrection from Vindicated by Paul's Ministry they wouldn't accepted said but there was some that clave unto him and believed said why why why they believe but a m because God had been made known unto them is't it something he said see John you want to go ahead and stand to your feet I'm I'm not going to get to all of it anyway we'll pick it up next Sunday but John said there's one among you whom you know not but said I'll have to change that part of it tonight he said I have to say there's one among you who you see not say not that you don't know he's been made known unto you but you can't see him you see him not he said it's the Holy Spirit he's the one that makes every promise true he's unseen you said well how do you know he's there because he's doing the same works that he done them how do you know always there he's manifesting the same life that he manifested then isn't it something John said the messiah's coming you've lost your mind John the messiah's coming we've been looking for him for thousands of years and then he said he's standing right among you now and brother bam said and so is he tonight he was standing there on the banks of the Jordan River he said and so is he standing here tonight friends let me declare it unto to you the god of the year of 33 ad is the god of 2024 the same Elohim that walked and the same one that went down and was baptized by John that day is the same God that's standing in our midst he hasn't left the church let Mark he's preparing us for the Rapture this is what he's doing he's working amongst his children to prepare us for the Rapture every word that you hear every everything that's spoken is to build your faith to gain revelation to draw closer to God that one day soon you'll make your last step on this Earth brother Amos can you imagine what it'll be like you're sitting there walking along and all of a sudden that next step that you take it don't even touch ground it just goes on up a little higher now I'll tell you for a short boy that makes me shout all over this building I'm going to experience atmospheres I've never experienced brother W oh my can you imagine what it'll be that day one day we'll take our last step on this Earth amen my what a revelation say who is it is the same Elohim that created the world in the beginning he's the same Elohim that's here today what is he doing he's working amongst his children let me just say it his name is Jesus Paul said I want to make him known brother bram's whole Ministry was to make him known see many people get that they get that backwards they look at the ministry brother brandom and so many people following after his ministry and they say Well they're all following after this man and all the the gift that he had but you you fail to realize that it was no different than those that followed after Paul's Ministry they went to Paul's Church they went and sat down under the ministry of Paul who was a prophet of God brother Mark because he had an experience with the Lord and He Vindicated the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what the ministry of William brandham done it proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ let me ask you if you put him on trial today what would you do if you was on trial life or death and they told you you Pro Pro to me that Jesus Christ is still alive you proved to me he's the same yesterday today and forever how would you prove it ask the Muslim that well I know he's alive cuz he's living in my heart that's wonderful but the Muslim says well my God's alive he's living in my heart well I know he's alive because he makes me feel good the Muslim says well our God's Alive he makes me feel good well I know he's alive because all of us gather from around the world and there's such a a people that are so supportive of the ministry well our Gods alive people gather around the world matter of fact they're the greatest prayer warriors that there are daylight the dark they get up every morning before most of us even get out of bed and praying see so that that can't be it said well what would you do to prove it you would find him in the power of his resurrection it isn't just to know that he resurrected but it's to see him in the power of the Resurrection but in other words Jesus said whenever they came to him and they were they were going to Stone him he said Don't Judge Me for for what I say he said but the works that I do see you say you're the Son of God he said but what works but look at the works that I've done are they not the very prophecy fulfilled is it not God is it not the same work of God is it not the Fulfillment of scripture isn't it something you said well brother man how would we prove it there ain't but one way to prove it is to see him manifested in the power of his resurrection that's what the ministry of William brandham done it proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ it didn't prove William brandom it proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ it was a man that had dedicated friends this is all free this morning but but it was a man that had dedicated his life to proving Jesus Christ to say I'm not here to build a church I'm not putting my name on I'm not trying to make a denomination I'm trying trying to make a church of me I'm not trying to get y'all to all follow after me but look to Jesus Christ he's alive and well he's here in the power of his resurrection and he's not out there in that the denominational system that that men have made and all this Seminary knowledge that men have built up he's here just like he was in the book of Acts when people went down in the upper room and they prayed and they got their heart and one mind and one Accord until the spirit of the Lord fell upon them and they became one with him he's the same God here today amen do you believe that won't you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise I am redeemed I am redeemed I hand again I've been bought with the ch Jesus has changed my whole life and if anybody ask you just who I am
