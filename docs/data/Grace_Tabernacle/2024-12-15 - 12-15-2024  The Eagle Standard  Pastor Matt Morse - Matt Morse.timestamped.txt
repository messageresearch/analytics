[44:45] I just enjoy uh the right atmosphere
[44:48] amen just people to come and you know
[44:51] all it takes is a people that will get
[44:52] out of the way and let God Amen if we
[44:55] can do that then God moves in a special
[44:57] way amen so we just want to read out of
[44:59] the Book of Ezekiel we going to start in
[45:01] the first chapter in the fourth verse
[45:03] and and um I know I kind of held a
[45:06] little uh long uh last week and brother
[45:10] Mark said I hadn't preached but two
[45:11] times I don't know how how many but
[45:14] certainly a little more but maybe I was
[45:16] trying to make up for it last week but I
[45:18] won't do that to you this morning so
[45:20] somebody keep an eye on me but Ezekiel
[45:22] the first chapter I know they have the
[45:25] uh the the dinner and today and so I
[45:28] don't want to get everybody's mind I
[45:29] don't want to be like brother Tim Pur
[45:31] that day he said he turned into two
[45:32] pizzas so I don't want to be two pizzas
[45:34] this morning amen we just we just want
[45:36] to be able to preach the word and it be
[45:38] effective amen so I want to read out of
[45:41] Ezekiel uh the the first chapter the
[45:44] fourth verse the Bible says and I looked
[45:47] and behold a whirlwind came out of the
[45:49] North a great cloud and a fire including
[45:51] or infolding itself and a brightness was
[45:53] about it and out of the midst thereof as
[45:55] the color of amber out of the midst of
[45:57] the fire also out of the midst thereof
[45:59] came the likeness of four living
[46:01] creatures and this was their appearance
[46:03] they had the likeness of a man and every
[46:05] one of them had four faces and everyone
[46:08] had four wings now I want to read down
[46:10] at the 10th verse the Bible says As for
[46:12] the likeness of their faces because
[46:14] here's where we're focusing this morning
[46:16] as for the likeness of their faces they
[46:18] they for had the face of a man and the
[46:20] face of a lion on the right side and the
[46:22] four had the face of an ox on the left
[46:25] side and the face of an eagle eag and I
[46:27] want to take this this morning and I
[46:29] would like to preach on an eagle
[46:31] standard and we'll just allow you to
[46:33] take your seats this morning on an eagle
[46:36] standard amen we just certainly I know
[46:39] we certainly couldn't get into all of
[46:41] this this morning and uh uh there's so
[46:43] many wonderful things in this scripture
[46:45] that we could uh go through but I just
[46:47] want to uh maybe kind of go in the
[46:49] direction we had started last week and
[46:52] and uh I believe that we have a purpose
[46:54] in this life amen as a church how many
[46:56] believe that we have
[46:57] a purpose as a body of Believers and I
[46:59] believe that our purpose is to spread
[47:01] this Full Gospel message to the world
[47:03] and I believe that God has allotted that
[47:05] to us that's our allotment to be able to
[47:07] spread uh this gospel I know everybody
[47:10] has their their own calls to spread but
[47:12] this is ours brother wesle this is what
[47:14] God has given to us and you know
[47:16] sometimes that uh that we get people on
[47:18] our heart and we go to praying for them
[47:19] or a person or a family on our heart and
[47:22] I think that's a wonderful thing you
[47:23] know to pray for people and pray for
[47:25] their salvation and pray that uh that
[47:27] the Lord would bring them in and you
[47:28] know don't quit because I believe prayer
[47:30] Works how many believe that I I believe
[47:32] it works and I believe Prayer Changes
[47:33] Things so don't quit praying for them
[47:35] but uh but if you want to see a
[47:36] transformation in somebody's life or or
[47:39] a family the only way to see a
[47:40] transformation is you can't stop at the
[47:42] prayer there has to be some more things
[47:44] that are done I I remember reading out
[47:46] of U out of apostle Paul and when he
[47:48] went in in went into jail remember the
[47:50] book of Acts and they had put him in
[47:51] jail and the Bible said whenever
[47:54] whenever they were in this jail that in
[47:56] in their time of being in prison there
[47:58] was a Jailer and his family was
[47:59] converted how many remember that you
[48:01] know what it was it wasn't just the
[48:02] prayer of apostle Paul and and Silas
[48:05] that converted the family but while he
[48:07] was in that jail cell the Bible says
[48:09] that they were locked in prison and they
[48:11] began to pray and to sing songs to God
[48:13] and make an atmosphere and all of a
[48:15] sudden a great earthquake came and the
[48:17] earthquake it it it tore down the jail
[48:19] cell it opened up all the doors it broke
[48:21] all the chains that were binding them
[48:23] and and as it was broke you notice here
[48:26] the Bible said they sang and they
[48:28] praised God in other words they created
[48:30] an atmosphere in the prison cell that
[48:32] brought the power of God to where they
[48:33] were and when the power of God came the
[48:36] power of God is what made a way of
[48:37] Escape it wasn't just a way of Escape
[48:39] for Paul and Silas but it was a way of
[48:41] Escape for the Jailer and his family and
[48:44] I thought you know that's the way it is
[48:45] with us we've all been bound at some
[48:47] point every one of us we've all been
[48:49] prisoners to something there's something
[48:50] there may be a mental battle maybe a
[48:52] struggle or something that we've been
[48:54] abound by but you know what God has done
[48:56] in this hour as God has provided a way
[48:59] of Escape I say God done that in every
[49:00] hour he's always provided a way of
[49:03] escape to the Believers and you notice
[49:04] that God's provision not only does it
[49:07] free you brother Wesley but it provides
[49:09] a testimony IT Supplies a faith-building
[49:11] testimony to those that are around you
[49:13] so when God frees you and he supplies a
[49:15] way of Escape for you it provides a way
[49:18] a testimony for those uh that look at
[49:20] your life it's a faith-building
[49:22] testimony that God has given you and I
[49:24] realize it this morning that you're and
[49:26] I want you to hear this before I get
[49:27] into my message that your testimony
[49:29] provides a way of Escape for others your
[49:32] testimony that you're living in the life
[49:34] that you live it provides a way of
[49:36] Escape for the people that are around
[49:37] you don't you see what that's what
[49:39] happened they there's people around you
[49:41] that they may be hanging on by a thread
[49:43] and your testimony is the very things
[49:45] that is going to turn things around for
[49:47] them it's what's going to it's what's
[49:49] going to bring them home you see how
[49:50] important your testimony is brother Mark
[49:52] how you how you react to the word and
[49:54] how how you receive the word of God and
[49:57] how you live this gospel it is a it will
[49:59] turn people their lives that are barely
[50:01] hanging on it'll turn them to the Gospel
[50:04] of Jesus Christ can I can I give you
[50:05] some free pastoring this morning we may
[50:07] we may as well we're going we're going
[50:08] to preach anyhow but but but but but you
[50:11] realize that that people see your life
[50:13] and they see your testimony that means
[50:15] they see everything that you say they
[50:17] see everything that you post they they
[50:19] hear the words that you speak and I know
[50:21] sometimes we wonder L Lord Lord help me
[50:23] this morning but you know sometimes you
[50:25] wonder why people won't go to church
[50:27] with me let me tell you why that is a
[50:28] lot of times is a lot of times that
[50:30] people's testimony is a negative
[50:32] testimony and you let me tell you a
[50:34] secret there's never a negative
[50:35] testimony ever w a single soul a
[50:38] negative testimony it don't win people
[50:40] it ain't going to win them to the Lord
[50:41] it ain't going to cause them to have a
[50:43] desire to go to church with you how many
[50:45] believe the Bible this morning I believe
[50:47] the Bible and I believe the Bible gives
[50:48] us the answer to all things I believe
[50:50] the Bible it's it's been established in
[50:53] this hour and so I I believe that we God
[50:56] has given us a direction he's given us a
[50:58] direction a way to live and a way to
[51:00] find escape and a way to get our
[51:02] families out of this place of bondage
[51:04] and and God has given us that how many
[51:06] believes that do do you believe Apostle
[51:08] Paul go ahead and let me know it I just
[51:10] I don't say that to be smart but I I
[51:12] want to know how many believe Apostle
[51:13] Paul how many believe him to be a man of
[51:15] God that was sent by God to be a
[51:17] messenger to the Gentile church and do
[51:19] you believe that this morning how so so
[51:21] if you believe that how many can say I
[51:22] believe Ephesians the 4th chapter I
[51:24] believe that it was inspired by God how
[51:26] how believe that say Amen how many that
[51:28] can accept Paul's letter to the Church
[51:30] of Ephesians and say I don't just
[51:32] believe it was a letter to the Ephesians
[51:34] but I believe that was a letter to me
[51:35] how many say that this morning I believe
[51:37] that God wrote that for me and so so
[51:40] that means that the words that Paul
[51:41] spoke that that that it wasn't to
[51:43] another person or or it wasn't just to
[51:45] somebody else but it was just for me and
[51:47] how many believes that Paul's word that
[51:49] he spoke that there ain't no angel from
[51:51] heaven that could come and preach
[51:52] something different that would that
[51:54] would be greater than what Paul has
[51:55] already spoke how many believe that I
[51:57] believe him to be a messenger of God I
[51:59] believe Ephesians 4 to be anointed of
[52:01] God so let well let's just read it this
[52:03] morning here's what he said so when Paul
[52:05] said that there's one Lord and one faith
[52:08] and one baptism and one God and Father
[52:10] of all he's above all and he's through
[52:13] all and he's in you all how many can say
[52:15] Amen to that that's Ephesians 4 Apostle
[52:17] Paul you say you mean the father of all
[52:19] the father's in me I thought I thought
[52:21] it was the Holy Ghost well it's the same
[52:23] Spirit of the father is the same spirit
[52:25] that was in the Holy Ghost and he's the
[52:27] same one that's dwelling in the heart of
[52:29] the Believers this morning how many
[52:30] believe that see do you accept it or do
[52:32] you resent it it's the word of God we
[52:35] have an opportunity every time we hear
[52:37] the word of God pre to preach to either
[52:39] be able to accept it or do we resent the
[52:41] word of God let me tell you what Paul
[52:42] said he said he that descended is the
[52:45] same one that ascended Above All The
[52:47] Heavens that he might fill all things so
[52:50] in other word that same Jesus that was
[52:52] on the cross of Calvary the one that
[52:54] descended he's the same one that
[52:56] descended to the throne he's the same
[52:58] one that descended to the bottomless pit
[53:00] that overcome the devil and and overcome
[53:03] all of hell and overcome death he said
[53:05] he is the same one that came in this
[53:07] hour to fill all things so that same
[53:10] Jesus that same father that same Holy
[53:13] Ghost he's the one that is fing us this
[53:15] morning do you accept it or do you
[53:17] resent it see this is Ephesians the 4th
[53:19] chapter Paul said and he gave some
[53:21] Apostles and some prophets and some
[53:23] evangelists and some pastors and
[53:25] teachers for the protecting of the
[53:27] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[53:29] the edifying of the body of Christ until
[53:31] we all come in the unity of the faith
[53:34] and the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[53:36] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[53:38] stature of the fullness of God do you
[53:41] accept it or do you resent it see it's
[53:43] Ephesians 4 this is the same chapter I'm
[53:45] not I'm not changed books on you it's
[53:46] the same chapter it's still Ephesians 4
[53:49] how many say Amen to it it's God's word
[53:51] so God sends his prophets he sends
[53:53] evangelists he sends teachers he sends
[53:56] pastors how many believe in the
[53:57] five-fold ministry this morning why
[53:59] because it was Apostle Paul that spoke
[54:01] it in Ephesians 4 it was an anointed
[54:03] word it was anointed oh let me tell you
[54:05] what I'm looking at this I'm looking at
[54:06] a group of pites this morning man we're
[54:08] we're just a bunch of pites that believe
[54:10] the message of apostle Paul we're a
[54:12] bunch of polites if father you can call
[54:14] us what you want to but I believe he was
[54:16] an anointed man of God a messenger that
[54:18] was sent from God and we're still
[54:20] preaching that same message this morning
[54:22] and it's still just as anointed as it
[54:24] was in the days of Paul when he walk
[54:26] walked along the road and he preached
[54:28] and and he took those that were sick and
[54:29] brought healing to their body and he
[54:31] spoke the very Mind Of God I still
[54:33] believe it this morning do you accept it
[54:36] or do you resent it what are we anyhow
[54:39] think about it Paul said let me tell you
[54:41] if we're if we're going to believe
[54:42] Ephesians 4 let me tell you about our
[54:44] Our Testimony Paul said let no
[54:46] communication this is me pastoring let
[54:49] no corrupt communication proceed out of
[54:51] your mouth Ephesians 4 verse 29 but he
[54:54] but that which is good into the of
[54:56] edifying that it may Minister grace to
[54:58] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[55:00] spirit of God whereby you were sealed
[55:02] into the day of redemption but let all
[55:04] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[55:06] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[55:08] with all malice and be kind one to
[55:10] another tenderhearted forgive one
[55:12] another even as God for Christ's sake
[55:14] has forgiven you Ephesians 4 do you
[55:17] accept it or do you resent it the
[55:20] Amplified Bible would say it like this
[55:22] let no foul or polluting language nor
[55:25] evil word nor UNH wholesome or worthless
[55:28] talk ever come out of your mouth but
[55:30] only such speech as is good and
[55:33] beneficial to the spiritual progress of
[55:35] others as is fitting to the need and the
[55:37] occasion that it may be a blessing and
[55:40] give Grace in other words God's favor to
[55:43] those that hear it my I say we have a
[55:45] testimony this morning we have a message
[55:48] to share we have a testimony and God has
[55:51] given us our testimony that it would
[55:53] provide a way of Escape is't that
[55:55] something what Paul's testim done you
[55:57] watch that Jailer and whenever the the
[55:59] walls opened up and the Bible said the
[56:01] Jailer came to them he said what must we
[56:02] do to be saved remember he was so
[56:04] anointed by by or moved by the the the
[56:07] the gift that Paul had you realize that
[56:09] Paul prophesied unto him here Paul being
[56:11] a prophet of God the Bible said the
[56:13] Jailer I'm I'm not going to get to my
[56:15] message this morning but the Bible said
[56:16] the Jailer he thought in his heart that
[56:19] they had escaped from the jail and he
[56:21] took his own sword to take himself in
[56:23] the middle of the darkness but Apostle
[56:25] Paul was sitting there in the dark and
[56:27] knew what the man was thinking and he
[56:29] called out unto him and said don't take
[56:31] your own life don't you worry sir but
[56:33] we're all still here he was going to
[56:35] take his life because he thought here
[56:37] the the ones I've been given charge over
[56:39] had escaped but Paul being anointed of
[56:41] God being a prophet of God knew what
[56:43] happened in the middle of the dark he
[56:44] said don't worry sir we're all still
[56:46] sitting here and the Bible says when he
[56:48] heard Paul cry out he lit him a light
[56:51] and went down to the feet of Paul and
[56:53] asked him what must I do to be saved he
[56:56] saw a prophet of God being able to
[56:58] discern his heart in the middle of the
[57:00] night and discern the very thoughts of
[57:02] his heart and when a prophet of God
[57:03] called out what was going on in his
[57:05] heart he fell down at his feet and he
[57:07] said what must I do to be
[57:10] saved and Paul said believe on the Lord
[57:13] Jesus Christ and you and your house will
[57:15] be saved and he began to preach unto him
[57:17] the word of the Lord and all that were
[57:19] in his house and the Bible says and that
[57:21] Jailer took him that same night into his
[57:23] house and they were baptized straight
[57:25] away and they went now and they they
[57:27] were brought out of the house and they
[57:28] rejoiced and they believed in God and
[57:30] all of his house believed Now isn't that
[57:33] something it wasn't just a testimony it
[57:36] wasn't just that he was praying for him
[57:38] but he shared the gospel verse 31 he was
[57:40] told to believe in the Lord in verse 32
[57:43] Paul and Silas shared the news about
[57:45] Jesus with his family in verse 33 they
[57:48] took a hold of the Gospel that was
[57:49] preached to him and they expressed their
[57:51] faith outwardly and they went down to a
[57:53] water and they were baptized a watery
[57:55] grave and were baptized in the water and
[57:57] then in verse 34 they went away
[57:59] rejoicing at their new found salvation
[58:02] see that's the gospel story in my
[58:04] opinion I believe we ought to pray for
[58:05] one another but we ought to testify we
[58:07] have a testimony we have a gospel to
[58:10] preach and when a person can take a hold
[58:11] of that gospel it'll save a whole family
[58:14] it'll cause them to go turn away from
[58:16] their old way of thinking and turn away
[58:18] from their old teaching and all the
[58:19] things that Satan has been trying to put
[58:21] on their mind and it'll cause them to
[58:23] turn back to God and in their turning to
[58:25] God they they'll see the salvation of
[58:27] the
[58:28] Lord and then they'll go away rejoicing
[58:30] why cuz they found the new found favor
[58:32] with God it's wonderful to pray but
[58:35] proclaim the gospel have a testimony I
[58:38] believe as Believers that's what we have
[58:39] to do this morning is we are spreading
[58:42] this Full Gospel message to the world
[58:44] you realize the responsibility that's
[58:46] been given to us I see our testimony
[58:48] it's going to bring forth a fruit you
[58:50] believe that you're the the the the
[58:52] church it's going to manifest the fruit
[58:54] of what's being planted or manif EST the
[58:56] fruit of what's being preached and I
[58:58] know there's a lot of churches and they
[58:59] preach a lot of different things but you
[59:01] realize that that that the fruit of the
[59:03] church is manifested by what seed is
[59:05] planted into it so I believe that we
[59:07] ought to plant the right seed I think
[59:09] sometimes people get so far off on one
[59:11] side or the other and they failed to
[59:13] plant the right seed or the True Heart
[59:15] of what the gospel was or what was being
[59:17] said that's why we guard the pull pit we
[59:19] don't just let anybody have an
[59:20] opportunity to stand behind this desk
[59:22] and to preach the gospel because we
[59:23] guard the pull pit that the word of God
[59:25] can go for so that people don't lose
[59:27] respect for the pull Pitter they don't
[59:29] lose respect for the gospel there's been
[59:31] so many things so many my goodness
[59:33] there's so many uh awful things been
[59:35] said behind pull pits that that men have
[59:37] built that cause people to lose faith in
[59:39] God and lose faith in Ministry and lose
[59:42] faith in in what God has brought them to
[59:43] in this hour but I thank God that we
[59:45] still have a place to go to that he can
[59:47] restore our faith and that very thing
[59:50] that men has tore down that God has
[59:52] provided a place that it could be
[59:53] restored again oh friend don't let let
[59:55] me take tell you this morning you don't
[59:57] have to remain in a bound State you
[59:59] don't have to remain in a confused State
[1:00:01] you don't have to accept everything that
[1:00:03] everybody tells you that God has given
[1:00:05] us a place to go this morning that the
[1:00:07] very faith that he gave you the first
[1:00:09] time you knelt down at an altar that
[1:00:11] that same faith can be restored right
[1:00:13] here today it's a place that God has
[1:00:16] provided so we guard it because we want
[1:00:18] a certain fruit you say well what kind
[1:00:20] of fruits it going to bring forth you
[1:00:22] you've heard me preach it before but the
[1:00:23] B but but the the prophet would tell it
[1:00:25] like this he said the church is going to
[1:00:27] have to produce the right kind of
[1:00:28] children the church World think about it
[1:00:30] they're producing children they they
[1:00:32] have a seed in there because they're
[1:00:33] bringing forth children all the time but
[1:00:35] they're not bringing forth the right
[1:00:36] kind of children it's all those Society
[1:00:39] types and all all this cold and formal
[1:00:41] types he said but the only church that
[1:00:43] the word of God would bring forth is a
[1:00:45] screaming hollering blabbering acts 238
[1:00:48] miserable creatures that the world
[1:00:49] thinks they are I don't care what the
[1:00:51] world thinks about them brother Wesley
[1:00:53] but that's the only kind of church that
[1:00:55] the word of God will produce how many
[1:00:58] say Amen to it this morning that's the
[1:01:00] only kind the church world don't want
[1:01:01] that kind of seed you know they don't
[1:01:03] want that kind of children so they don't
[1:01:04] plant that kind of seed but that's the
[1:01:06] only kind of children that the word of
[1:01:08] God is going to produce it'll produce
[1:01:10] Full Gospel children that's the kind of
[1:01:13] children that the word will manifest
[1:01:15] Born Again Holy Ghost filled children of
[1:01:17] God that's why we're a Full Gospel
[1:01:19] Church because we're preaching a full
[1:01:21] you know it's so odd I was speaking of
[1:01:23] this last Sunday people have been told
[1:01:25] so many things they don't even know what
[1:01:26] they are anymore they're so confused if
[1:01:28] somebody asked you what they are they've
[1:01:30] been down so many uh trails and heard so
[1:01:32] many things they don't even know how to
[1:01:33] identify themselves and what they are I
[1:01:35] thought I I spoke it last Sunday I said
[1:01:38] we're a Full Gospel Church somebody kind
[1:01:39] of some people kind of looked at me
[1:01:41] funny but let me say it this morning to
[1:01:42] make it a better understanding we are a
[1:01:44] fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church let
[1:01:48] me make it make it a better
[1:01:50] understanding I want everybody to know
[1:01:51] where I stand this morning that's what
[1:01:53] we are as a body of Believers you know
[1:01:55] some people are afraid to say that
[1:01:57] because they they've been so twisted up
[1:01:58] in their theology they don't know even
[1:02:00] know what it is to be a Full Gospel
[1:02:02] Church anymore but it ain't something
[1:02:04] new a Full Gospel that that came all the
[1:02:07] way back from what Jesus was you think
[1:02:09] about many many associate that I I might
[1:02:11] as well get in here I'm already here
[1:02:12] brother Tom he's a historian but you
[1:02:14] know many associate this term with a
[1:02:16] fourfold gospel remember in the 1800s in
[1:02:19] Canada there was this great movement
[1:02:21] called The four-fold Gospel remember Amy
[1:02:23] mcferson a great sister that went out
[1:02:25] and she started a great movement you
[1:02:26] realize that today that the movement she
[1:02:28] started which was called The Four Square
[1:02:30] movement it came from that Full Gospel
[1:02:32] teaching and that four square movement
[1:02:34] here that that that that her
[1:02:36] fundamentals were that God that Christ
[1:02:38] was a savior A sanctifier A Healer and
[1:02:41] the oncoming King so that was the the
[1:02:43] four parts the four bases of her of of
[1:02:45] her belief but but you realize that the
[1:02:47] foundation of that four square movement
[1:02:48] that happened in the 1800s she would
[1:02:50] take this and say she she would change
[1:02:52] that that that four parts and she'd say
[1:02:54] well he's a savior and he's a filler of
[1:02:56] the Holy Ghost he's a Healer and a king
[1:02:59] and she started that movement and today
[1:03:01] there's 8 million people that follow
[1:03:03] that same movement they you know and
[1:03:05] here uh later that mainstream Pentecost
[1:03:08] they took that same thing and they
[1:03:09] combined that fourfold with the four
[1:03:11] square and so now they said there's that
[1:03:14] that Christ is all five things so they
[1:03:16] they combine the two things that sister
[1:03:18] mcferson had and they say in the
[1:03:20] mainstream Pentecost said he's a savior
[1:03:22] he's a sanctifier and he's a filler of
[1:03:24] the Holy Ghost he a Healer and he's a
[1:03:27] king but let me tell you something this
[1:03:28] morning do you realize that as a body of
[1:03:30] Believers that we still believe all five
[1:03:33] of those things I still believe that
[1:03:35] he's a savior I believe he's a
[1:03:37] sanctifier I believe he's a filler of
[1:03:39] the Holy Ghost I believe he's a Healer
[1:03:41] and I still believe he's a
[1:03:43] king but where we differ in our Doctrine
[1:03:46] is we differ in the evidence of the Holy
[1:03:48] Ghost is being the speaking of tongues
[1:03:51] because people had manufactured it and
[1:03:53] they would force people to speak in
[1:03:54] tongues and beat them on the chin and
[1:03:56] make them say some words to prove that
[1:03:58] they had the Holy Ghost we differ in the
[1:04:00] bapt the baptism being baptized with
[1:04:03] titles and not having a revelation of
[1:04:05] who the Lord Jesus Christ was we differ
[1:04:08] in forming denominations and and
[1:04:10] following after man-made Ministries and
[1:04:12] and building up hierarchies that that
[1:04:14] men would rule over the church we differ
[1:04:17] in in the spirit of nanism where where
[1:04:19] the Ley would be conquered by by the
[1:04:21] ministry or by Bishops we differ in all
[1:04:23] those things we differ in that the Holy
[1:04:26] Ghost is the ruler over the church the
[1:04:28] Holy Ghost is the is the head of the
[1:04:30] church that that's what this message has
[1:04:32] produced is a Bible Church that's being
[1:04:34] led by the Holy Ghost not to be a bunch
[1:04:36] of man followers and people at following
[1:04:38] after the theologies of some man but the
[1:04:41] only theology we have is the Bible it's
[1:04:43] the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's been
[1:04:45] anointed in this hour it was came it
[1:04:48] came down on the cross of Calvary it
[1:04:50] spoke in the in the book of Acts and
[1:04:52] it's the same gospel that's being
[1:04:53] preached this morning
[1:04:56] that was the need for a word Prophet is
[1:04:58] to get people away from all those things
[1:05:00] and back to a true Bible Church to point
[1:05:03] the people back to a to a Bible gospel
[1:05:06] back to a true Full Gospel but you know
[1:05:08] even in all that here when brother Brown
[1:05:10] came you realized that he was still not
[1:05:12] disrespectful you realize that when he
[1:05:14] preached the message the Masterpiece how
[1:05:16] many remember that message you've all
[1:05:17] heard it you remember the great moving
[1:05:20] message of the Masterpiece and how that
[1:05:22] he had talked about going down and
[1:05:23] seeing Michelangelo and the statue or or
[1:05:25] the statue of Moses remember how it been
[1:05:27] struck and he said it became God's
[1:05:29] Masterpiece how many knows where he was
[1:05:31] at whenever he saw that statue to see
[1:05:33] when he saw it he was actually visiting
[1:05:36] the tomb of Amy mcferson with her son
[1:05:39] and let me tell you how he said about it
[1:05:40] he said you know even though I differ I
[1:05:42] don't agree in women preachers and I
[1:05:44] differ in some of the beliefs but but I
[1:05:47] went down to pay my respects and I paid
[1:05:49] a tribute to her and we went down to her
[1:05:51] grave and I stood there with my hat off
[1:05:53] and I bowed my head and I gave thanks to
[1:05:55] God for a noble life of his little
[1:05:58] handmaid watch the difference the way
[1:06:00] that people treat one another today but
[1:06:02] that was never the nature I know what
[1:06:03] they're trying to do today they're
[1:06:05] trying to paint the nature of a prophet
[1:06:07] and make him something that he wasn't
[1:06:09] but I don't accept that I don't accept
[1:06:11] what people say that he was and the
[1:06:13] nature that he was and this was his
[1:06:14] motive and this was all that but this
[1:06:16] was a true heart said I I may not agree
[1:06:18] with it but I still wanted to honor what
[1:06:20] God had done with her life I think
[1:06:22] that's the way we ought to be today I
[1:06:23] may not agree with you we may not see
[1:06:25] everything to eye to eye but I still
[1:06:27] want to honor what God has done with her
[1:06:29] life be still respectful to one another
[1:06:32] you know why because she stood for many
[1:06:34] true things the Full Gospel it wasn't
[1:06:37] sister McPherson's movement it wasn't a
[1:06:39] Pentecost movement it was a Jesus
[1:06:42] movement it was a Jesus movement listen
[1:06:45] today people take their families to all
[1:06:47] kinds of churches here's what a prophet
[1:06:49] said he said if I was choosing a church
[1:06:51] he said I'd choose a genuine fundamental
[1:06:54] Full Gospel Bible Church if I was
[1:06:56] looking for a church to put my family in
[1:06:58] he said that's the only kind of church
[1:07:00] I'd take my family to I know people say
[1:07:02] it don't matter you can go to wherever
[1:07:04] Church you want to but I'm just saying
[1:07:05] what a prophet said that's the only kind
[1:07:07] of church I'd put my family in can I say
[1:07:09] it a little bit further than that he
[1:07:11] said it's the only kind of church that
[1:07:13] Jesus would preach in is a Full Gospel
[1:07:16] Church he said why would it be the only
[1:07:18] church he would preach in because he was
[1:07:21] the Full Gospel he couldn't deny himself
[1:07:24] brother wesle Full Gospel Church it
[1:07:26] teaches that Jesus is the Full Gospel
[1:07:29] he's the fullness of the word of God a
[1:07:30] fundamental Full Gospel Church it
[1:07:32] teaches that Jesus is the son of God but
[1:07:35] it also teaches that he was God in flesh
[1:07:38] it teaches that he was all God but it
[1:07:40] also teaches that he was all men it
[1:07:42] teaches that when he went down to the
[1:07:44] tomb you say Where's that in the Bible
[1:07:45] when he went down to the tomb of Lazarus
[1:07:47] and the Bible said that he had
[1:07:49] compassion upon them the man that was
[1:07:51] Jesus that old man he be to weep at the
[1:07:53] tomb why because he felt that their
[1:07:56] compassion they were they were his
[1:07:57] friends and when he stood there and wept
[1:07:59] he was all man but when he walked down
[1:08:01] to the tomb and he called Lazarus by
[1:08:03] name and a dead man got up and walked
[1:08:05] out of the Grave it had nothing to do
[1:08:07] with a man it was God himself calling a
[1:08:10] dead to
[1:08:11] rise a Full Gospel Church it teaches
[1:08:15] Hebrews 13 and8 what God was he still is
[1:08:18] so if he was a savior I feel like
[1:08:20] preaching this morning if he was a
[1:08:22] savior then he still is a savior if he
[1:08:24] was a Healer he still Is A Healer if he
[1:08:26] was a sanctifier he's still a sanctifier
[1:08:29] if he ever filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:08:31] still fills with the Holy Ghost he was
[1:08:33] crowned the king of glory and he's still
[1:08:35] the king of glory he's the king of
[1:08:37] righteousness he's the king of Peace
[1:08:40] Zachariah said Rejoice oh Daughter of
[1:08:42] Zion Oh daughter of Jerusalem for Behold
[1:08:44] thy King cometh unto
[1:08:46] thee and ha
[1:08:49] salvation he's a king of
[1:08:51] kings he's coming to thee to bring
[1:08:54] Salvation you say what do he come for
[1:08:56] he's coming to save coming to catch the
[1:08:59] church away Behold thy King is Coming
[1:09:02] glory to God and he has
[1:09:06] salvation he said well what's he coming
[1:09:09] for let me tell you what the Bible said
[1:09:10] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:09:12] it be in the coming of the son of man I
[1:09:14] got a minute to preach
[1:09:16] now got that off my chest as it was in
[1:09:19] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:09:21] coming of the son of man the Bible said
[1:09:23] in the same day that lot went out of
[1:09:24] Sodom it raised fire and brimstone from
[1:09:26] heaven and Destroy them all even thus
[1:09:29] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:09:31] man is revealed said notice it was not
[1:09:33] the Son of God no more it was the son of
[1:09:35] man he would come back as this prophetic
[1:09:37] age and the eagle would be flying now
[1:09:40] how many so so listen this this age or
[1:09:42] this day in other words he said it would
[1:09:44] be the day of the eagle how many knows
[1:09:46] this reference the day of the eagle
[1:09:48] watch we read it read it in Ezekiel
[1:09:50] Ezekiel said I looked and behold a
[1:09:51] whirlwind came out of the North a great
[1:09:53] cloud and folding itself brightness
[1:09:54] midst their of in the midst there was a
[1:09:56] likeness of living creatures in their
[1:09:58] appearance they had the likeness of a
[1:10:00] man everyone had four faces and four
[1:10:02] wings one had the face of a lion one of
[1:10:05] a man one of an ox and one of an eagle
[1:10:07] now notice as Ezekiel would make this
[1:10:09] plain this is in the first chapter but
[1:10:10] in Ezekiel the 10th chapter the 15th
[1:10:12] verse Ezekiel would say these were choms
[1:10:15] he said I saw them they were lifted up
[1:10:16] remember they had four wings he said
[1:10:18] they were living creatures that I saw by
[1:10:20] the river chear so that so but in the
[1:10:22] Old Testament it would show us that
[1:10:24] these cherubs that Ezekiel saw that and
[1:10:26] as he would explain what they look like
[1:10:28] that that in the Old Testament they were
[1:10:30] protectors or guards and how many how
[1:10:32] many how many realize the first time we
[1:10:34] saw this in the Bible you actually see
[1:10:36] it in the Garden of Eden remember uh the
[1:10:38] Bible says after man had fell in the
[1:10:40] garden and God had pushed him out of the
[1:10:42] garden that he set up to block the way
[1:10:44] to the Tree of Life what did God set in
[1:10:46] the east of the garden he said I set up
[1:10:48] chams that were there see they were
[1:10:50] guards and they had flaming swords that
[1:10:52] went Every Which Way that would guard
[1:10:54] the way of the Tree of Life so you
[1:10:55] realize that this is uh these these
[1:10:57] choms they were guards this is what
[1:10:59] Ezekiel was seeing see but you realize
[1:11:02] they guarded because it was only granted
[1:11:04] by those that God would Grant access so
[1:11:06] here if God would give you if it was
[1:11:08] God's purpose that you'd have access to
[1:11:10] that then you'd be able to get past the
[1:11:11] guard and you realize that no man could
[1:11:13] go without invitation and and I say it
[1:11:15] this this way this morning they were
[1:11:17] effective guards so for thousands of
[1:11:20] years no one had access to this tree of
[1:11:22] life it was it was guarded it was
[1:11:24] guarded now watch the spiritual uh type
[1:11:26] of this it was guarded so for thousands
[1:11:28] of years here that God had established
[1:11:30] guards these great chones that would
[1:11:32] guard over these spiritual things but
[1:11:34] now but now notice we see this again
[1:11:36] remember thinking of guards we see this
[1:11:38] again when God would give Moses the
[1:11:40] instruction to build the Ark of the
[1:11:42] Covenant notice in Exodus 25th chapter
[1:11:44] he said when you build the ark make two
[1:11:46] choms of gold and beaten work in the two
[1:11:49] ends on the two ends of The Mercy Seat
[1:11:51] make one CH on one end and one CH on the
[1:11:54] other that The Mercy Seat she the chals
[1:11:56] have two will be on the two ends and
[1:11:58] they will stretch forth their wings on
[1:11:59] high covering the mercy seat with their
[1:12:01] wings and their faces shall look one to
[1:12:03] another toward the mercy seat that the
[1:12:06] shall the faces of the chams be and that
[1:12:08] shall put The Mercy Seat above upon the
[1:12:10] ark and the Ark shall be put the you
[1:12:12] shall put the testimony that I shall
[1:12:14] give thee and there I will meet with
[1:12:17] thee and I will commune with thee from
[1:12:19] above the mercy Sea from between the two
[1:12:22] choms of which are upon the Ark of the
[1:12:24] testimony the things which I will give
[1:12:26] commandment unto the children of Israel
[1:12:28] so in other words here what God gives
[1:12:30] order he said here is the Ark of the
[1:12:32] testimony here is here is The Mercy Seat
[1:12:35] here is where Moses would go to hear the
[1:12:37] order that God would give him to be able
[1:12:39] to speak to the children of Israel but
[1:12:41] even in this place in even the The Mercy
[1:12:43] Seat in the ark of the testimony here
[1:12:45] once again we find these great cherums
[1:12:47] that God has placed watch's the
[1:12:49] spiritual typ again we find these choms
[1:12:51] that God has placed as a guard Over The
[1:12:54] Mercy Seat or or a guard over the Ark of
[1:12:56] testimony so we realize you say well
[1:12:59] what were they guarding they were
[1:13:00] guarding uh that they were guarding this
[1:13:02] testimony or or the Ark of the Covenant
[1:13:04] I think I think this is so powerful
[1:13:06] because in ezekiel's Vision notice what
[1:13:08] he sees he said they had four faces one
[1:13:10] had the face of a lion one the face of a
[1:13:13] of an ox the other a face of a man and
[1:13:15] then fourth the face of an eagle how
[1:13:17] many members those same four things is
[1:13:19] the same four faces that John saw in
[1:13:22] Revelations the fourth chapter remember
[1:13:23] he saw the same types but notice how
[1:13:25] John worded it he said and he saw in
[1:13:27] around the Throne of God he said they he
[1:13:29] called them beasts he said the first
[1:13:31] Beast was like a lion the second beast
[1:13:33] was like a calf the third Beast the face
[1:13:35] of a man and the fourth Beast was a
[1:13:37] flying eagle now you notice that when
[1:13:39] you read this word it you know it kind
[1:13:41] of gets gets lost in confusion because
[1:13:43] people would look and say well these
[1:13:44] were beasts and and you know those that
[1:13:46] that Ezekiel Saw they were living
[1:13:48] creatures but I'm just going to read
[1:13:49] this to you out of the Greek the word
[1:13:50] beast in Revelations 4 comes from the
[1:13:53] Greek word zon is z n and this word zon
[1:13:56] means a living creature in other words
[1:13:58] it's something that's alive so it's the
[1:14:00] very same word that Ezekiel used one was
[1:14:03] written in Hebrew one was written in
[1:14:04] Greek but Zan it meant a living creature
[1:14:07] it's unlike the beast in Revelation 13
[1:14:09] remember these were Savage beasts that
[1:14:11] that word was a different word that was
[1:14:12] the word Theon which meant they were
[1:14:15] Savage they were they were venomous
[1:14:16] beasts they were great they were great
[1:14:18] Savage Beast SS in Revelations 13 and 11
[1:14:21] and different places in the scripture
[1:14:22] you'll find these are Savage beasts but
[1:14:24] but Before the Throne of God it wasn't
[1:14:26] that kind of a beast what John saw he
[1:14:28] said here were living creatures that
[1:14:30] were standing Before the Throne of God I
[1:14:33] I think it's something but notice you
[1:14:34] say well it was the angels of God but
[1:14:36] that ain't that ain't what John said
[1:14:38] Revelations 5:11 he said I heard the
[1:14:40] voice of many angels around the throne
[1:14:44] and the Beast and the elders so here he
[1:14:47] would show us that that they wasn't the
[1:14:49] Angels it was angels and the living
[1:14:51] creatures and the elders but mam said
[1:14:53] see so think about it he said they
[1:14:54] weren't weren't angels and they weren't
[1:14:56] Elders they were living creatures at the
[1:14:57] throne he said well if they were living
[1:14:59] creatures s what what were they if they
[1:15:01] weren't angels and they weren't redeemed
[1:15:03] men what are they he said here's here's
[1:15:05] what they are I believe that they are
[1:15:07] the God's guards to his throne so watch
[1:15:10] the same thing that Ezekiel had spoke of
[1:15:13] that would that would guard that or that
[1:15:15] Moses was told that would guard the the
[1:15:17] the the mercy seat and the would guard
[1:15:19] The Arc of the testimony it's the same
[1:15:21] thing that that would that God would
[1:15:23] place before the garden of it was the
[1:15:25] guard that would keep the way of a tree
[1:15:27] of life and the same thing Before the
[1:15:29] Throne of God here's the guards that
[1:15:31] would keep the Throne of God he say see
[1:15:33] now notice he said these same things
[1:15:35] also were anointings that came through
[1:15:37] the ages and every time you think about
[1:15:39] these great guards this morning every
[1:15:41] time a religious power or something has
[1:15:43] raised up God has had God has raised
[1:15:45] something up to be able to combat the
[1:15:47] spirit that is in that age I mean how
[1:15:49] many believes that whenever there's a
[1:15:50] spirit in an age do you think that God
[1:15:52] don't have something that he would raise
[1:15:53] up in that age to come comat the spirit
[1:15:55] that we're fighting to see so you look
[1:15:57] back in the first age in that that great
[1:15:59] Roman power that raised to destroy the
[1:16:01] church but notice what God used in that
[1:16:04] age the first thing he used the lion
[1:16:06] anointing it was the anointing of the
[1:16:08] lion to combat that spirit so in the age
[1:16:11] of the lion what was it it was Apostle
[1:16:13] Paul being a man of God an angel to the
[1:16:15] church a messenger of God and and and as
[1:16:19] he would come and that great Roman
[1:16:20] Empire would try to to to to wipe away
[1:16:23] the people of God but here Paul under
[1:16:25] that Lon anointing would be able to
[1:16:27] preach the word of God he said because
[1:16:28] that was the spirit in the land at that
[1:16:31] time and what was he it was a line of
[1:16:33] the tribe of Judah what did he type the
[1:16:35] line of the tribe of Judah Judah that
[1:16:37] great warrior which was Christ the word
[1:16:39] and Paul being Anointed with the word of
[1:16:41] God you realize in that age that Paul
[1:16:42] went and spoke it it was under the
[1:16:44] anointing of a lion but then watch the
[1:16:45] next age the bible say that when it came
[1:16:48] down here the ox or the spirit of the ox
[1:16:51] went forth notice as as the Bible would
[1:16:53] go into this uh leading Into the Dark
[1:16:55] Ages and after the Bible was written you
[1:16:57] remember how the church had went into
[1:16:58] these great ages of of sacrifice and say
[1:17:01] see notice how in this time they were
[1:17:03] sacrificed they would give their lives
[1:17:05] it was it was a time in the Dark Ages it
[1:17:07] was a time of work and labor and
[1:17:09] sacrifice to give their lives you see
[1:17:11] that it was the anointing of the ox that
[1:17:14] was upon the church so that's what the
[1:17:15] church did under the anointing of the ox
[1:17:18] it was Labor and work and sacrifice that
[1:17:21] that was the only thing they knew
[1:17:22] because they were living under that hour
[1:17:24] it was the sacrif hour that that the ox
[1:17:26] went but then it came to the next age it
[1:17:28] came the age of the reformers this is
[1:17:30] when the church begin to rise and people
[1:17:33] they they they got Bolder say what
[1:17:35] caused them to get Bolder it was because
[1:17:37] the anointing had changed it went from
[1:17:39] the age of the ox into the age of men
[1:17:41] and that anointing had shifted no it
[1:17:43] wasn't about the sacrifice and the work
[1:17:46] and labor it was about standing up as
[1:17:48] men and saying the theology wasn't right
[1:17:50] and and and and the just shall live by
[1:17:52] faith and and in the time of reformation
[1:17:54] how many knows what the Reformation was
[1:17:56] if you if you study about it it was
[1:17:58] about Great Men of God that would Point
[1:18:00] people back to God and here under that a
[1:18:03] under the the age of man they came when
[1:18:05] they were calling people out into the
[1:18:07] into the Lutheran age and Wesley age all
[1:18:09] this it came under the spirit of the man
[1:18:12] so see so these reformers they come all
[1:18:14] the way down to the P Pentecostal age
[1:18:16] from justification down to
[1:18:18] sanctification all the way what was it
[1:18:20] it was the man anointing following after
[1:18:22] the ways of man but notice how showing
[1:18:24] how it was the age of man is that every
[1:18:27] time they started a movement it went
[1:18:29] right into
[1:18:30] denominationalism do you realize that
[1:18:32] every reformer every reformer message
[1:18:34] any great reformer that you read about
[1:18:36] there's a denomination that followed his
[1:18:38] ministry see because it was a it was the
[1:18:40] it was the uh the spirit of a man so so
[1:18:43] we come each time that creating an
[1:18:45] organization but but then when we come
[1:18:47] to the last age it's a different kind of
[1:18:49] anointing see in the last stage it was
[1:18:51] an eagle anointing how many how many
[1:18:53] knows what Brother David preached the
[1:18:54] message on the other day an eagle has
[1:18:56] great vision an eagle flies to higher
[1:18:58] Heights All Through the Bible prophets
[1:19:00] are typed as Eagles so here all through
[1:19:03] the scriptures we're looking for this
[1:19:05] final age we're looking for the age of
[1:19:07] the eagle and you friends let me tell
[1:19:08] you this I read a lot of Bible and you I
[1:19:10] read a lot of theologians and Scholars I
[1:19:13] spend a lot of time studying and and and
[1:19:15] and you know I I I I've never found a
[1:19:17] scholar one I've never found a any of
[1:19:20] the great religious Scholars that don't
[1:19:21] believe that we're living in a prophetic
[1:19:23] age that's something almost every one of
[1:19:25] them have in common that this is an age
[1:19:27] of fulfillment of Prophecy or this is
[1:19:29] the age a prophetic age this isn't
[1:19:32] something that is denounced by by any
[1:19:34] any man that reads the Bible we realize
[1:19:36] that this is a prophetic age so here the
[1:19:38] prophet would say here it's an eagle age
[1:19:41] this is where we are he said see but
[1:19:43] this last message when it would go forth
[1:19:45] it would come as a flying eagle in the
[1:19:47] eagle time it's revealed time the word
[1:19:49] of God made manifest and the word of God
[1:19:52] proved you said well brother matter if
[1:19:53] we're living in the eagle age what is
[1:19:55] the eagle saying here here's the Cry of
[1:19:57] the eagle can I just tell you this
[1:19:58] morning make it plain he said let's walk
[1:20:00] into the baptism of the Holy Spirit come
[1:20:03] in and believe it with all your heart
[1:20:05] and let God feel you so what the
[1:20:08] ministry was in this Eagle age is to
[1:20:10] call a people back to a true filling of
[1:20:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't
[1:20:16] cause them to follow after a man it
[1:20:18] wasn't to cause them to build up
[1:20:20] churches and build up all these things
[1:20:21] between one another and make this big
[1:20:23] religion and all these things that
[1:20:24] people do today but it was to call a
[1:20:27] people back to a Bible Holy Ghost back
[1:20:30] to the way it was in the book of Acts
[1:20:33] this was the very purpose I know people
[1:20:34] got it all twisted up and they make it
[1:20:36] to be a bunch of things that it ain't
[1:20:37] and then other people they they come and
[1:20:39] attack what what they say it is but
[1:20:41] friends let me tell you the only thing
[1:20:42] we have to do is to go back to what God
[1:20:45] said he said there'll come a man or
[1:20:47] there'll come an anointing in this hour
[1:20:49] and that anointing it'll lead God's
[1:20:50] children right back to the Holy Ghost
[1:20:52] again we're under an eagle anointing why
[1:20:54] would he lead you back to a holy ghost
[1:20:56] cuz that's what the church would have
[1:20:58] need of in order to take a Rapture isn't
[1:21:00] it something the eagle age Rapture of a
[1:21:02] church you see the correlation the eagle
[1:21:05] flies high it's the Rapture of the
[1:21:07] church you see the age that we're living
[1:21:09] in to see it's they call us in this age
[1:21:11] but notice just as these four the
[1:21:13] anointings guarded when they entered
[1:21:16] into the ark think about it they were
[1:21:17] guarding the Ark of the Covenant you
[1:21:19] realize that the Arc of the Covenant
[1:21:20] that was the Old Law you said well what
[1:21:22] what about now we're living under a new
[1:21:24] Covenant and our New Covenant of the
[1:21:26] church today is the holy spirit that's
[1:21:28] the New Covenant that God has given the
[1:21:30] church that's what that that's where our
[1:21:31] Salvation is fine see but notice but
[1:21:33] even the natures the taking the same
[1:21:36] nature of those of those anointings each
[1:21:38] one of those were a type of the four
[1:21:40] gospels that we believe today how many
[1:21:42] how many see that each one was the Tope
[1:21:44] of the four gospels see this is where
[1:21:46] unbelievers miss it when they say they
[1:21:48] can't believe Jesus I my son all the
[1:21:51] time I are y are y'all too tired my son
[1:21:54] all the time he's getting in trouble he
[1:21:55] acts just like his mama he was he was on
[1:21:58] he was online the other day talking to
[1:22:00] he was talking to about a hundred
[1:22:01] atheist and Muslims and all they have a
[1:22:03] big group chat and I was like son quit
[1:22:05] you know what are you doing and he's
[1:22:06] like well I'm I'm I'm setting them there
[1:22:08] all having this big discussion and of
[1:22:10] course one of them that they they
[1:22:11] started telling they said well we can't
[1:22:12] believe we can't be a Christian because
[1:22:14] the Bible isn't right and the go the
[1:22:16] gospels they contradict each other and
[1:22:18] you know they kind of put Salem on the
[1:22:19] spot I was eavesdropping and they put
[1:22:21] him on the spot and one of the guys he
[1:22:22] was a a Muslim and he said well read it
[1:22:24] in your own Bible what is God and Salem
[1:22:26] said well God is a spirit he said well
[1:22:27] that's good he said well then go read
[1:22:28] over here and he gave Salem another
[1:22:30] scripture Salem turned over in his Bible
[1:22:32] and he says when Jesus came into the
[1:22:34] room with the disciples he said now what
[1:22:35] did Jesus say he said touch me am I not
[1:22:38] flesh are my feet not flesh I am not a
[1:22:40] spirit I'm flesh he said see Jesus
[1:22:42] couldn't be God because he was flesh and
[1:22:44] God is a spirit and old Josh me and
[1:22:46] brother Josh Martin was standing there
[1:22:47] and Josh said Josh kind of whispered
[1:22:48] something in his ear and Salem said well
[1:22:50] he said well that's wonderful that that
[1:22:52] you found that he said but can you tell
[1:22:53] me one more thing can you turn back a
[1:22:55] couple of verses and tell me how that
[1:22:56] flesh man walked through a wall that
[1:22:58] didn't have a door tell me how that
[1:22:59] flesh man stood in there with a group of
[1:23:01] disciples he said why because he was all
[1:23:04] God and He was all man they didn't want
[1:23:05] himar him on the chat no more I well go
[1:23:07] ahead and preach it to them anyhow and
[1:23:09] let let we we believe that God they they
[1:23:11] they they don't believe that that that
[1:23:13] the four gospels there's all kinds of
[1:23:14] controversy around it well they they
[1:23:16] differ from one another and one gospel
[1:23:17] says one thing the other gospel says
[1:23:19] another but the reason they can't find
[1:23:21] that is because they don't realize what
[1:23:23] these four Gospels are but as a Believer
[1:23:26] you see this that whenever they miss
[1:23:28] this because the four stories are all
[1:23:30] different how many ever read Matthew
[1:23:32] Mark Luke and John they're all four when
[1:23:34] you read the stories they're all
[1:23:35] different stories you you read about the
[1:23:37] the lion you watch what a lion was in
[1:23:40] The Book of Matthew he talked about the
[1:23:41] lion of the tribe of Judah and how you
[1:23:43] know the lion was a king and he he
[1:23:45] presented Jesus as the king of Israel
[1:23:47] why because Matthew was under that lion
[1:23:49] anointing so when he writes about Jesus
[1:23:52] he writes it under a lion anointing but
[1:23:54] then you watch how Mark RS when Mark
[1:23:55] talks about him here comes that great
[1:23:57] age of ox watch Mark 10:45 he said to
[1:24:00] serve and to give Life as a ransome for
[1:24:02] many so he's talking about serving and
[1:24:04] sacrificing giving life why would Mark
[1:24:06] write this way because Mark was riding
[1:24:08] under that Ox anointing since see and
[1:24:11] now watch when Luke being under under
[1:24:13] that man or the face of a man or the
[1:24:14] anointing of man Luke Luke what was
[1:24:16] Luke's whole book about he said this is
[1:24:18] the eyewitness testimonies of men this
[1:24:21] is the I went and got these testimonies
[1:24:23] from all all the men and I've gathered
[1:24:25] testimonies and when he wrote about it
[1:24:26] he wrote about the son of man this and
[1:24:28] the son of the son of man everything you
[1:24:30] read about in Luke was about the son of
[1:24:32] man why because he was riding under the
[1:24:34] anointing of man or under that man type
[1:24:37] anointing but then watch about whenever
[1:24:39] John wrote John was writing under a
[1:24:41] different anointing John was writing
[1:24:42] under an eagle anointing so when John
[1:24:44] wrote about it he wrote it would seem
[1:24:46] like that John and Matthew didn't have
[1:24:48] anything in common because the things
[1:24:50] they write about Jesus seems like they
[1:24:52] come from two far different Spectrum let
[1:24:54] let me tell you why it was because
[1:24:56] Matthew when he would write about Jesus
[1:24:58] he starts out in the lineage of Abraham
[1:25:00] and he said he was the natural he talked
[1:25:02] about his natural birth he said Jesus
[1:25:04] was the son of David he come the son of
[1:25:06] Abraham he come from Abraham down down
[1:25:09] to Isaac and down to Jacob and Matthew
[1:25:11] goes all the way down the lineage of
[1:25:13] Abraham until he comes to Joseph he said
[1:25:15] and Joseph there was a spouse to Mary
[1:25:17] whom Jesus was born unto so he took the
[1:25:20] the natural lineage of Abraham but
[1:25:21] notice whenever John talked about Jesus
[1:25:24] John didn't write about that he said in
[1:25:26] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:25:28] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:25:30] the Word was made flesh and it dwelt
[1:25:32] among us you say why did they write
[1:25:34] different things because John was riding
[1:25:36] from an eagle anointing oh my I think
[1:25:39] about what John it was John that wrote
[1:25:41] in John the 8th chapter he said your
[1:25:43] father Abraham rejoiced to see my day
[1:25:45] and he saw it and was glad and the Jews
[1:25:47] said to him you're only 50 years old and
[1:25:49] you've seen Abraham but here's what John
[1:25:51] writes about Jesus he said but Jesus
[1:25:53] said before Abraham was I am that wasn't
[1:25:57] written in Matthew and Mark and Luke It
[1:25:58] Was Written in the Book of John because
[1:26:00] John seemed beyond the lineage of
[1:26:03] Abraham why because he was under an
[1:26:05] eagle anointing it wasn't it wasn't the
[1:26:07] anointing of the of the lion it was the
[1:26:09] anointing of the eagle he seemed Beyond
[1:26:12] Abraham Matthew couldn't Rite like John
[1:26:14] because he was under a different kind of
[1:26:16] anointing notice how here they were all
[1:26:19] important they all had their place in
[1:26:20] the gospel you said what were they doing
[1:26:22] they were guarding one talked like a
[1:26:23] lion one like an ox one like a like a
[1:26:26] man the other like an eagle all the four
[1:26:27] gospels he said what were they sent for
[1:26:29] they were sent as a protection of the
[1:26:31] Holy Spirit why because they're God's
[1:26:34] guards All Through the Bible they're his
[1:26:37] guards so here they are again they're
[1:26:39] protecting the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:26:41] John saw in heaven when he saw these
[1:26:43] four cherums on the sides of the arcs of
[1:26:45] the Throne of Heaven they were guards of
[1:26:47] the arc they were cherubs guarding The
[1:26:50] Mercy Seat think about they're guarding
[1:26:53] this place of Mercy can I just read you
[1:26:54] something this morning said father today
[1:26:57] we stand in your grace not that it's a
[1:26:59] special people but it's because just
[1:27:01] like the day of the lon or the ox or the
[1:27:03] man it's Eagle
[1:27:05] time it's the time it's the anointing of
[1:27:08] the hour it's the time we're living in
[1:27:10] it's the working of the holy spirit for
[1:27:11] this time to prove that Jesus is not
[1:27:14] dead you see the purpose of the message
[1:27:16] the things that he said he would do just
[1:27:18] before the evening lights went out here
[1:27:19] we've been seeing him do that here the
[1:27:21] picture of the pillar of fire that great
[1:27:23] Pillar of Fire led the children of
[1:27:25] Israel the same one that Moses met on
[1:27:27] the back child of desert the same one
[1:27:29] that met Paul on the road here he is
[1:27:31] today the Lord that same Pillar of Fire
[1:27:33] by evidence and proof of the word even
[1:27:35] by scientific research revealing the
[1:27:36] word of the Lord God let the people be
[1:27:39] awakened this morning Lord let them
[1:27:41] quickly be awakened that those that have
[1:27:43] their names on The Book of Life when
[1:27:45] this flashes across their path may they
[1:27:46] see just like that little ill Fame woman
[1:27:49] at the well that day she recognized
[1:27:51] quickly and she knew it was the
[1:27:52] scripture and now father I pray that we
[1:27:54] will receive you in this time in our
[1:27:55] hearts and it will settle it forever at
[1:27:57] this hour that they're finished with sin
[1:28:00] that they will rise and make
[1:28:01] preparations for a public confession of
[1:28:03] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:28:05] the remission of their sins to believe
[1:28:07] that that God has forgiven them and they
[1:28:09] take on the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:11] then father pour down the Holy Spirit of
[1:28:14] oil upon them that they might be placed
[1:28:16] into the service of the Lord God that
[1:28:18] they might be workers in this last evil
[1:28:20] day for we realize we have a short
[1:28:23] time see MAA you think about it our
[1:28:25] approach to God it has to come a certain
[1:28:27] way here that God has given us an
[1:28:30] invitation into the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:32] Ghost but do you realize in order to be
[1:28:33] able to access this place of Mercy you
[1:28:36] had to first get past the
[1:28:38] guards that's why people can't pull me
[1:28:40] into all kinds of unbelief because I
[1:28:42] have a revelation of the of the
[1:28:43] scripture they can't they can't just
[1:28:44] take a quote and say well this was
[1:28:46] missed here because I have enough
[1:28:48] revelation of the scripture you see it
[1:28:50] was guarded you can't just take and and
[1:28:52] and just walk in there why because it
[1:28:54] was guarded you realize your approach to
[1:28:56] God has to be a certain way that's why I
[1:28:58] don't follow after denom denominational
[1:29:00] churches can I say this without y'all
[1:29:01] thinking uh uh different of me I went to
[1:29:04] church at the Pentecost church I went to
[1:29:05] church at the Baptist Church I went to
[1:29:07] church at the church of Christ Church
[1:29:09] I've been to church at the Episcopalian
[1:29:10] Church I went to church at the Catholic
[1:29:12] church I've been to church at the
[1:29:13] Methodist Church I've been to a lot of
[1:29:14] different
[1:29:15] churches but you know what I find out is
[1:29:18] in the church there's no Holiness right
[1:29:21] in the church they're trying to find The
[1:29:22] Mercy Seat in the church they're trying
[1:29:24] to get to the same place trying to gain
[1:29:26] access to the throne of God but you
[1:29:28] realize that this Throne of God is being
[1:29:30] guarded by the gospels they're guarded
[1:29:32] by these great anointings to see so your
[1:29:34] approach to God has to come a certain
[1:29:36] way how many believe that so you can't
[1:29:38] just go to God and just some any a way
[1:29:40] that's way that's way the church wases
[1:29:41] make it can I don't say this to be a
[1:29:43] mockery but but but they stand outside
[1:29:45] smoking cigarettes walk in start
[1:29:46] preaching the gospel and just unclean
[1:29:48] things are drinking and getting drunk
[1:29:50] then going to the pool pit and all all
[1:29:51] this garbage that people call the gospel
[1:29:53] that everybody bring brings coffee in
[1:29:54] there's nothing sacred about it any
[1:29:56] longer but but the gospel never was
[1:29:58] supposed to be a social club a church
[1:30:00] ain't supposed to be a a social club
[1:30:02] it's supposed to be a place where the
[1:30:03] anointing of God can fall in among his
[1:30:05] people like it was on the day of
[1:30:07] Pentecost in the book of Acts it's a
[1:30:09] place where people can leave the world
[1:30:10] on the outside and come in and meet with
[1:30:13] God and allow the anointing of the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost to pour out upon them again a
[1:30:17] place where people could have fellowship
[1:30:18] with God and just because you went
[1:30:21] somewhere that that anointing wasn't had
[1:30:22] or maybe that anointing had fallen away
[1:30:24] don't mean that God ain't still real it
[1:30:26] don't mean his word ain't still true
[1:30:28] just because you've had a bad experience
[1:30:29] it don't mean that God God's word ain't
[1:30:31] still true because we're living under
[1:30:33] the anointing of the hour you say
[1:30:35] brother man I want to be free this
[1:30:36] morning we'll get under the anointing of
[1:30:38] the message of the hour I want to had
[1:30:40] Deliverance this morning then get under
[1:30:41] the anointing of the message of the hour
[1:30:45] it's an eagle anointing it's called it's
[1:30:46] Church think about it in order to access
[1:30:49] the Throne of God you have to get past
[1:30:51] those guards these are Mighty guards you
[1:30:52] can't just walk in there in your way you
[1:30:54] can't just come to God any way and say
[1:30:56] well god'll accept me like this if I'm
[1:30:58] if I it don't matter what I am if I if I
[1:31:00] can be a sinner if I want to God god'll
[1:31:02] just accept me that way but God don't
[1:31:04] just accept us
[1:31:06] anyway think about it here at the when
[1:31:09] you come down to the altar it's to turn
[1:31:12] from it's to it's to it's to take on
[1:31:14] Holiness that we might be able to be
[1:31:17] worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:31:19] stand in the presence of God not to make
[1:31:21] a mockery of the grace of God to our
[1:31:23] approach to God it has to be a certain
[1:31:25] way you remember Aaron the priest how
[1:31:28] that he went into The Mercy Seat how
[1:31:29] many remembers only once a year he could
[1:31:31] even go in but Aaron he went in he had
[1:31:33] to have the the road built just right
[1:31:36] the bells ringing on the bottom every
[1:31:37] step he would remember they say they
[1:31:39] would ring out holy holy holy unto the
[1:31:41] Lord but here when when he would go in
[1:31:43] before him he would have the blood of
[1:31:45] the sacrifice sprinkling before him why
[1:31:47] he was going before the mercy seed you
[1:31:48] say what was he doing he was getting
[1:31:50] past the guards so here he took the
[1:31:52] blood of the sacrifice and he put it
[1:31:53] before him cuz that's the only way he'd
[1:31:55] ever get past him you you know there was
[1:31:57] people that went in before there that
[1:31:58] was struck with Leprosy there was people
[1:32:00] that lost their lives you tell me it
[1:32:01] wasn't guarded it's a guarded place in
[1:32:04] order to get to The Mercy Seat of God it
[1:32:06] is a guarded place and the only way to
[1:32:08] have access to the mercy of God is to
[1:32:10] take the blood of the sacrifice and put
[1:32:12] it before you so therefore every step
[1:32:14] that he took he was walking with the
[1:32:15] blood had already been shed I thought my
[1:32:18] is't that what we have to do this
[1:32:19] morning here as we walk Before the
[1:32:20] Throne of God the only way you'll ever
[1:32:22] get to God is let the blood of the
[1:32:24] sacrifice be sprinkled before you oh God
[1:32:26] I don't know where I I come from Lord I
[1:32:28] know I've made a lot of mistakes but let
[1:32:30] the blood of the sacrifice be sprinkle
[1:32:32] before me let me walk the path of the
[1:32:34] sacrifice this morning as I make my way
[1:32:37] to the throne of
[1:32:38] God and as he would go in this journey
[1:32:41] here he was anointed with oil remember
[1:32:43] Aaron's oil you know what it was made
[1:32:44] out of it was made out of the Rose of
[1:32:46] Sharon oh my is there something here it
[1:32:49] was that great Rose of Sharon that that
[1:32:51] sweet smelling Savor isn't that what
[1:32:53] Jesus was typed there he was typed as a
[1:32:55] Rose of Sharon I thought isn't it
[1:32:57] something but you realize before he
[1:32:58] could have that anointing see he had to
[1:33:00] have the blood and he had to have the
[1:33:02] right anointing but in order to have
[1:33:04] that anointing that that Rose had to be
[1:33:07] crushed down it had to be torn apart and
[1:33:09] the beauty of the Rose had to be tore
[1:33:11] down though it wasn't beautiful anymore
[1:33:13] that the anointing that was in the Rose
[1:33:15] could come upon the man Aaron oh friends
[1:33:17] don't you realize that's the only way we
[1:33:18] have access to The Mercy Seat of God I
[1:33:21] thank God that we've had a sacrifice
[1:33:23] that's come for us a blood that we can
[1:33:25] sprinkle before our path as we access
[1:33:27] the Throne of God and I thank God this
[1:33:29] morning that we have a Jesus that arose
[1:33:32] of sharing that was crushed on the cross
[1:33:34] of Calvary that the anointing would be
[1:33:36] poured upon the church that's the only
[1:33:39] way you'll get past the
[1:33:41] guards they had the right sacrifice and
[1:33:44] the right anointing and because he had
[1:33:46] the right sacrifice and the right
[1:33:47] anointing that he can walk past the
[1:33:49] guard see we now we're living in this
[1:33:51] age but said we're living in another age
[1:33:53] think about it he said I love this age
[1:33:56] why because God just like it was God has
[1:33:58] a mercy seat today to be guarded you
[1:34:01] said well where's that mercy seat at
[1:34:03] it's in the heart of man when did it
[1:34:06] come in the heart of man at the day of
[1:34:08] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell it's
[1:34:10] when it came down into the human heart
[1:34:12] you say well how did the church get
[1:34:13] there to Pentecost think about it in the
[1:34:15] book of
[1:34:16] Acts how did the church get to this
[1:34:18] place you know what people say I'm I'm
[1:34:20] just maybe five more minutes you know
[1:34:23] what they say the book of Acts is the
[1:34:24] framework of the church how many heard
[1:34:26] that the book of Acts is the framework
[1:34:27] of the church any denomination says that
[1:34:30] the book of Acts is the framework of the
[1:34:31] church but notice but the gospels were
[1:34:33] the framework of the book of Acts see
[1:34:36] there had to be something that caused
[1:34:37] the book of Acts to take place to see so
[1:34:40] here watch where these gospels these
[1:34:41] four gospels are the framework to back
[1:34:43] Pentecost after they had the framework
[1:34:46] up then Pentecost come into existence so
[1:34:48] here Matthew Mark Luke and John these
[1:34:50] Great Men of God here they wrote their
[1:34:52] they preach their gospel and they talk
[1:34:53] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ each
[1:34:55] anointing he was laying a
[1:34:57] foundation of of of that of that of that
[1:34:59] uh anointing that he was under so what
[1:35:01] was it doing it was building a frame of
[1:35:03] a framework that the day of Pentecost
[1:35:05] could even come into existence it was
[1:35:08] the framework that built it up so
[1:35:09] Matthew Mark Luke and John is the
[1:35:10] framework or they're the guard work that
[1:35:12] protect that protects the main Temple
[1:35:14] the throne and they protect the
[1:35:16] Pentecostal blessing that makes me want
[1:35:18] to shout all over this building that
[1:35:20] hear these four gospels that they were
[1:35:23] the the guards that protect the
[1:35:25] Pentecostal blessing see so there's only
[1:35:28] one way to get to it I know the the
[1:35:30] world makes all kinds of ways to get to
[1:35:32] this Pentecostal blessing but you won't
[1:35:34] get there without going through Matthew
[1:35:35] Mark Luke and John see it's the gospel
[1:35:38] see the see see what they're directing
[1:35:40] us they're directing us to be able to
[1:35:42] have access to that Pentecostal blessing
[1:35:44] to have access to the to to that book of
[1:35:46] Acts experience you see so here were
[1:35:48] these four gospel guards notice what the
[1:35:50] Bible says they were guards of the mercy
[1:35:52] seat and see see said we still got
[1:35:54] guards today we found out that those
[1:35:56] guards are Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:35:57] they're guarding the book of Acts the
[1:35:59] acts of the Holy Spirit done in the book
[1:36:00] of the Apostles or the book of Acts in
[1:36:02] the New Testament and the four writers
[1:36:04] Matthew Mark Luke and John all guard The
[1:36:06] Mercy Seat to show that it is God the
[1:36:09] Holy Spirit today than you each one has
[1:36:13] taken their position to guard access to
[1:36:16] this Mercy Seat of God you think of
[1:36:18] these four beasts four powers the living
[1:36:21] uh creatures all these they were ringing
[1:36:23] out in the presence of God I thought my
[1:36:25] isn't it something if men lived under
[1:36:26] the power of the lion and then men lived
[1:36:29] under the power of the ox see he said
[1:36:31] there were Beast they were Powers men
[1:36:33] lived under the power of the man then I
[1:36:35] believe that there's a men a people that
[1:36:38] will live under the power of the
[1:36:39] eagle that great omnipotent power of God
[1:36:42] that that's moved into this church you
[1:36:44] think about it what we're living under
[1:36:45] today under the shakana glory of God
[1:36:48] what was in The Mercy Seat what what was
[1:36:50] what were they guarding when they were
[1:36:51] guarding the Ark of the Covenant it was
[1:36:53] to guard it was guarding the shika Glory
[1:36:55] it was guarding access into the presence
[1:36:57] of God so see it's it's being guarded
[1:36:59] today that that same Shak glory and they
[1:37:02] went in and they and they would dwell
[1:37:04] under the interlock wings of those
[1:37:06] cherubs here's where the prophet of God
[1:37:08] would go that he would have access to
[1:37:10] the shika Glory I thought my this is
[1:37:12] where we are today Church we're not
[1:37:13] trying we're we're trying to have access
[1:37:16] to that same Glory that same Shina Glory
[1:37:18] that's moved in upon this church this
[1:37:20] morning but you won't find it looking
[1:37:22] under wings we're not trying we're not
[1:37:24] looking for it in a box we're looking
[1:37:26] for it in the word of God we're not
[1:37:28] looking to to an arc or some old law or
[1:37:31] going to Jerusalem trying to find some
[1:37:32] place to find it but we'll find it in
[1:37:34] the word of God not under the wings of a
[1:37:37] chable but under the outstretched horns
[1:37:39] of Jesus Christ that hung up on the
[1:37:41] cross of Calvary that the the very
[1:37:43] protector of the glory of God and under
[1:37:46] those outstretched wings for the West
[1:37:47] you we have access to The Mercy Seat of
[1:37:50] God under those outstretched arms we
[1:37:52] have access to the the kind of Glory of
[1:37:54] God that this church this morning 2,000
[1:37:57] years later can experience the same
[1:37:58] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that they
[1:38:00] had on the day of Pentecost friends this
[1:38:02] ain't a message for a day gone by this
[1:38:05] ain't a new message for a new people
[1:38:07] it's the gospel that Jesus preached it's
[1:38:09] the gospel that Paul preached it's the
[1:38:11] gospel that the disciples preached and
[1:38:13] it's the same gospel today it's been
[1:38:16] guarded and kept into this age till you
[1:38:18] and I can say I'm a member of the book
[1:38:20] of Acts I'm a I'm one of them that the
[1:38:23] that the spirit of God poured out upon
[1:38:25] in the book of Acts it's been guarded by
[1:38:27] all these gospels all these guards down
[1:38:29] through this age until that time of the
[1:38:31] Great Eagle anointing would take the
[1:38:32] church into a place that they could
[1:38:34] receive
[1:38:35] it my the Bible said and shall they fear
[1:38:39] the name of the Lord from the West when
[1:38:42] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:38:46] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:38:48] standard against him think about what
[1:38:50] God's done in this age see not if the
[1:38:53] enemy
[1:38:54] comes but when the enemy
[1:38:57] comes you remember remember Paul rever
[1:38:59] when he went out riding and what what
[1:39:02] what was his message when he wrote he
[1:39:03] said the enemy's coming the enemy's
[1:39:06] coming the enemy's coming you said well
[1:39:08] when will he come I tell you what a
[1:39:10] prophet said he said I'm an American too
[1:39:11] and I'm riding this Midnight Hour I'm
[1:39:13] not saying the enemy's coming but I'm
[1:39:14] saying he's here he ain't coming he's
[1:39:17] already here he's conquered many he's he
[1:39:20] he's conquering and destroying in this
[1:39:22] Midnight Hour don't you realize that
[1:39:23] we're living in the age that the enemy
[1:39:25] has arrived we're in the age where the
[1:39:28] enemy has arrived he he he he's arrived
[1:39:30] you say what what's he doing he's
[1:39:31] against this church he's against you
[1:39:35] he's against your family he's tormenting
[1:39:37] homes he's not coming he's here he's
[1:39:39] trying to destroy your faith just trying
[1:39:41] to to destroy your home trying to
[1:39:43] destroy you the love between a husband
[1:39:45] and a wife you think it just stops with
[1:39:47] scripture oh no it comes right down in
[1:39:49] the middle of the home you think what
[1:39:51] what it'll do it'll introduce the spirit
[1:39:52] you you oh my friends you take you take
[1:39:54] a man that would that would walk away
[1:39:56] from his faith watch you the enemy ain't
[1:39:58] done with you there when you walk away
[1:40:00] from your faith he'll introduce do
[1:40:01] things into your life what he's trying
[1:40:03] to take you into alcoholism and and
[1:40:05] trying to take you into having
[1:40:06] bitterness for for others where you you
[1:40:08] can't even communicate anymore try to
[1:40:10] destroy your home because the enemy is
[1:40:13] here he's on your
[1:40:15] doorstep he's trying to destroy us he's
[1:40:18] brought Tor torment to homes and
[1:40:20] sicknesses that medical science has no
[1:40:22] cure for the enemies here here he's
[1:40:23] brought trouble that there's no answer
[1:40:25] to the enemy's here but what's the Bible
[1:40:28] say but when the enemy comes in like a
[1:40:33] flood somebody quote it with me God will
[1:40:36] raise up a
[1:40:37] standard you say well what is that
[1:40:40] standard can I just say what a prophet
[1:40:41] said he said that standard is the eagle
[1:40:45] anointing that's what that standard is
[1:40:47] you said well how does God raise it
[1:40:48] because he brings Revelation it's that
[1:40:51] anointing of this age what what was the
[1:40:53] purpose of the eagle anointing it was
[1:40:55] the I don't have time to preach this it
[1:40:57] it was to bring the church to a place of
[1:40:58] Revelation that they could overcome the
[1:41:00] devil see somebody can tell you anything
[1:41:02] about water baptism I you I sat down
[1:41:05] with a lot of friends that would try to
[1:41:06] tell you different about water baptism
[1:41:07] but when you catch a revelation of it in
[1:41:09] the scripture then then nobody can take
[1:41:11] it from you that's why I that's why I
[1:41:13] challenge people to read their Bible you
[1:41:15] know what happens today most people
[1:41:16] don't even read their Bible they don't
[1:41:17] know what this is anymore why they they
[1:41:19] they oh I get myself in trouble but they
[1:41:22] just quote most of the the sermons
[1:41:23] preached today are plagiarized sermons
[1:41:26] that it's just it's plagiarized off what
[1:41:28] somebody else said people don't study
[1:41:30] and read their Bible anymore but I think
[1:41:31] what people need is they need a Bible
[1:41:33] Revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:41:35] and if you ever get a Bible Revelation
[1:41:37] then the devil can't take it away from
[1:41:39] you so what we need is a revelation
[1:41:42] abely that's why you have a a Bible Holy
[1:41:45] Ghost filled Full Gospel Church that can
[1:41:47] give you a Bible Revelation where's it
[1:41:48] at in the Bible I want to know it in the
[1:41:50] scripture why because God sent a word
[1:41:52] Prophet to show the word in the Bible
[1:41:55] and every word of it was in the Bible
[1:41:57] that's why people couldn't ever take me
[1:41:58] away from this message they can talk
[1:42:00] about the man they can talk about what
[1:42:02] he preached and what he done and this
[1:42:03] and that what people said you realize
[1:42:05] that ain't none of that matters to me I
[1:42:07] want you to take this word and you
[1:42:09] challenge the doctrine and you take that
[1:42:11] and show me different from the
[1:42:12] Revelation that have i that that I've
[1:42:14] already gained see they don't they want
[1:42:16] sit down why they're not theologians
[1:42:17] they're not going to sit down and show
[1:42:18] you because there's always a scripture
[1:42:20] that'll that'll contradict what they're
[1:42:21] saying you realize that's what the devil
[1:42:23] done he done that to Jesus he took him
[1:42:25] up on the mountain he said well it is
[1:42:26] written why he would try Jesus said but
[1:42:28] it is also written why because he was
[1:42:30] one with Revelation and that's what this
[1:42:32] a that's what this message was sent for
[1:42:34] it was sent to give the church a
[1:42:35] revelation of the
[1:42:37] Bible it was sent us to give a
[1:42:39] revelation that would help us through
[1:42:40] this hour that when men would bring
[1:42:42] teachings and false teachings and try to
[1:42:44] get you in all these churches and things
[1:42:46] you say but that ain't the revelation of
[1:42:47] the Bible it was sent to give you a
[1:42:50] revelation of the Bible think about it
[1:42:52] you say well what does revelation can do
[1:42:53] it destroys the enemy see your friends
[1:42:56] can come by as the music players come
[1:42:58] friends can come by I don't want to be a
[1:43:00] liar too many times this
[1:43:02] morning but they come by and they can
[1:43:04] say anything they want to you but but
[1:43:06] see it may bring confusion until you
[1:43:08] have a revelation see the Revelation
[1:43:10] takes away the confusion well I already
[1:43:13] see it in the scripture how many can say
[1:43:15] this morning I've gained Revelation this
[1:43:17] morning see that it's something that God
[1:43:20] gives us here with revelation it removes
[1:43:23] doubt with Revelation it it overcomes it
[1:43:27] overcomes unbelief that's what the
[1:43:29] church really needs you say well they
[1:43:30] need to listen to this they didn't do
[1:43:32] what we really need is just revelation
[1:43:34] we need a real revelation of the word of
[1:43:36] God and a real Revelation is what'll
[1:43:39] hold you it's the only thing that'll see
[1:43:40] you through Revelation is it's it it'll
[1:43:43] break every barrier that you ever face
[1:43:46] you realize that you're going to go
[1:43:47] through things in your life great
[1:43:50] barriers that you'll have to overcome
[1:43:52] and your walk with God there's many just
[1:43:54] starting just
[1:43:56] baptized our church is full of them we
[1:43:58] baptize people all the
[1:44:00] time that's our calling but do you
[1:44:03] realize in your walk with God some that
[1:44:05] are young some that are new how many's
[1:44:07] been serving the lord less than a year
[1:44:08] go ahead and raise your hand several in
[1:44:11] the room God bless you how many been
[1:44:12] serving the lord longer than for five
[1:44:15] years or less several how many how many
[1:44:17] 10 years or
[1:44:19] less how many how many 20 years how many
[1:44:22] serving 30 40 50 years see we have them
[1:44:24] from all all
[1:44:27] sorts I won't say any bigger
[1:44:31] numbers but we have all all ages some's
[1:44:33] been serving the lord for 50 years some
[1:44:35] been serving the lord for a year but you
[1:44:38] realize that no matter where you are in
[1:44:39] your walk with God we come to
[1:44:41] barriers there's things that come up in
[1:44:43] our life that we can't get through
[1:44:45] things that are that are raised up and
[1:44:47] you realize that's the enemy the enemy
[1:44:50] that comes in like a flood and God said
[1:44:52] any any time that he comes I will raise
[1:44:54] a standard but what is he doing he's giv
[1:44:56] us an anointing in this age to bring a
[1:44:58] revelation to the church that we' be
[1:45:00] able to overcome that no matter where we
[1:45:02] are in our
[1:45:03] walk not what people do and they make it
[1:45:06] worshiping men goofy stuff but be but
[1:45:10] real Christians Holy Ghost filled
[1:45:11] Believers that don't care to walk around
[1:45:13] like
[1:45:14] this where are them there're few far
[1:45:17] between
[1:45:18] nowadays people that don't care to walk
[1:45:20] around carry a Bible one preaching the
[1:45:22] revelation of the of the scripture but I
[1:45:24] I believe that's what we ought to be but
[1:45:26] when you come to these great barriers
[1:45:28] here God would give you a way to pass
[1:45:30] through it you realize there was you
[1:45:31] remember you remember whenever the back
[1:45:34] in
[1:45:35] 1947 when the sound barrier was broke
[1:45:37] for the first time it was an age where
[1:45:40] people feared of going at that speed the
[1:45:43] fear of the people was that there was an
[1:45:45] invisible barrier in the sky that if you
[1:45:48] ever broke it it would destroy you that
[1:45:50] you never could go that fast here was an
[1:45:52] invisible barrier they knew the speed of
[1:45:53] sound but here's an invisible barrier in
[1:45:56] the sky so at the time they feared
[1:45:57] supersonic flly the in in the fear of it
[1:46:01] was because in flying flying builds up
[1:46:04] so much pressure now think think about
[1:46:06] this so here these Pilots would get in
[1:46:09] and they would go and and Chuck Yer he
[1:46:11] would go in that that famous X1 plane
[1:46:13] and they and he would try to they' get
[1:46:15] faster and faster and the planes would
[1:46:17] shake so much they they was trying to
[1:46:18] change the aerodynamics of it and the
[1:46:20] closer they'd get to the speed of sound
[1:46:22] the the more the airplane would Shake
[1:46:25] but they they just keep flying and keep
[1:46:26] building and keep working while they
[1:46:27] were trying to get this place even
[1:46:29] though they didn't know what was going
[1:46:30] to happen when they broke it here you're
[1:46:31] talking about a a man that was taking a
[1:46:33] risk he was the best pilot in the entire
[1:46:35] United States Air Force at the time but
[1:46:37] he was willing to risk his own life not
[1:46:39] knowing what would happen he didn't know
[1:46:40] if the plane would explode why he said
[1:46:42] because there was an invisible barrier
[1:46:43] and people feared it but notice what was
[1:46:45] happened is because there was such a
[1:46:47] pressure built up around it you know
[1:46:49] what I thought about when I thought
[1:46:50] about that I thought you know as long as
[1:46:52] you were standing on the ground you had
[1:46:54] no pressure but where did the pressure
[1:46:56] come from it the pressure came because
[1:46:58] he was trying to break through the
[1:47:00] barrier and the more he flew and the
[1:47:02] faster he went and the more he tried and
[1:47:05] the harder he tried to get through the
[1:47:06] bar the barrier the more pressure that
[1:47:08] was built up around the plane you
[1:47:11] realize you if we could experimented
[1:47:12] this morning but if you took your hand
[1:47:14] and you do this you feel a wind on your
[1:47:16] other hand you ever noticed see what
[1:47:18] that is is because the moving of this
[1:47:20] hand is creating a pressure out in front
[1:47:22] of and that's what happens with a plane
[1:47:24] that's why it would shake and there
[1:47:25] would build up so much pressure here my
[1:47:28] here here a plane is in a it actually
[1:47:30] creates if you can see it by graph it
[1:47:32] creates a sphere of pressure so here the
[1:47:35] plane is in the middle of that sphere so
[1:47:37] as it's pushing and it's displacing air
[1:47:39] it's pushing air out in front of it
[1:47:41] which causes a pressure that it has to
[1:47:43] go through so it's pushing it and then
[1:47:45] hitting it and pushing it and hitting it
[1:47:46] and pushing and hitting it so it's a
[1:47:47] great sphere around the the nose of a
[1:47:50] plane so it's building up pressure I
[1:47:51] thought here here here here he is and as
[1:47:54] he would go and they were afraid of what
[1:47:55] would happen but notice what happened he
[1:47:57] said as as a little while as as the
[1:47:59] plane would get faster and faster notice
[1:48:01] the pressure gets closer and closer to
[1:48:03] the plane but as the sphere is still
[1:48:05] moving with the speed of the plane
[1:48:06] eventually the nose of that plane it
[1:48:09] hits the tip of that sphere and when it
[1:48:11] gets to the tip of that sphere it
[1:48:13] actually just the very moment it's a
[1:48:16] micro moment whenever it breaks through
[1:48:18] that sphere the entire time that sphere
[1:48:20] of pressure has been around the plane
[1:48:22] but the very moment that it goes past
[1:48:24] the speed of sound and goes into
[1:48:26] supersonic speed that actual sphere
[1:48:29] disappears and it turns into a cone so
[1:48:32] when he hits it here this sphere's been
[1:48:34] going along 200 300 400 500 mph all the
[1:48:37] way to 700 mph and finally when he hits
[1:48:39] it now it's no longer a sphere but it
[1:48:41] actually turns into a cone in other
[1:48:43] words all of the pressure that was
[1:48:45] before the plane the plane is going so
[1:48:47] fast that no pressure is able to go out
[1:48:50] in front of it but it displaces all
[1:48:51] pressure that's why you hear a sonic
[1:48:54] boom whenever a plane goes by at 700 mph
[1:48:57] because they broke the barrier or the
[1:48:59] they call it the sound barrier but I can
[1:49:01] say it like this this morning they broke
[1:49:02] the pressure barrier so now because all
[1:49:05] the pressure and all those waves that
[1:49:06] was hitting back at the plane all those
[1:49:08] waves are now behind the plane and you
[1:49:10] realize I I know you say well that Sonic
[1:49:13] Boom it's not just one blast like a big
[1:49:14] boom but that Sonic Boom is a continuous
[1:49:17] sound the only time it's a boom is
[1:49:19] because you're on the ground and you
[1:49:20] hear it go by and you hear that big boom
[1:49:23] but that noise is happening the entire
[1:49:24] time the plane is in that speed of
[1:49:26] flight so it's a continuous sound it's a
[1:49:29] continuous roaring noise that is behind
[1:49:31] it that make that Sonic Boom it's called
[1:49:33] It's called The Boom carpet and that
[1:49:34] carpet is continuously sounding all this
[1:49:37] sound that is so great that when you go
[1:49:39] by the United States outlawed flying
[1:49:41] supersonic flights over land because it
[1:49:42] was so great that it it would disturb
[1:49:44] the neighborhoods or even maybe cause
[1:49:46] damage to some buildings and things like
[1:49:48] that but you realize that all of this
[1:49:50] great noise that the only people that
[1:49:52] can't hear the noise is the people that
[1:49:54] are on the plane see whenever he passed
[1:49:57] that barrier all that pressure that he
[1:49:59] heard and roaring of the noises and all
[1:50:01] all that that he heard when he broke
[1:50:03] through the speed of sound now he
[1:50:05] couldn't hear it because all the sound
[1:50:06] was behind him thought I make a Believer
[1:50:08] want to shout see that's what happened
[1:50:10] in this age Brother David as we passed
[1:50:13] through this barrier I thought isn't it
[1:50:15] something this is just me it's free you
[1:50:16] don't have to take it if you don't want
[1:50:17] to it's is just mad but isn't it
[1:50:19] something that the year they broke the
[1:50:20] speed of sound and broke the sound
[1:50:22] barrier was 1947 that's the same year
[1:50:24] they started recording the message on
[1:50:25] tape I thought that's just a free
[1:50:27] coincidence but but I thought here here
[1:50:29] whenever that sound Barry was broken
[1:50:31] what did it do it allowed the church to
[1:50:32] break free from all the noises and all
[1:50:35] the pressure that was built up all that
[1:50:37] denominationalism that was built up the
[1:50:39] pressure around the people of God that
[1:50:41] just wanted to be holy ghost filled
[1:50:42] believers they just wanted to be Church
[1:50:44] uh uh they just wanted to be right with
[1:50:46] God and every one of them wound up in
[1:50:48] another denomination trying to find The
[1:50:50] Mercy Seat of God and what it took is it
[1:50:53] took one a pilot that was able to get
[1:50:55] into a plane that would take up in a
[1:50:57] under an eagle anointing and fly in a at
[1:50:59] a speed that no other man could fly what
[1:51:01] was he trying to do get to a place where
[1:51:03] it would displace the pressure off the
[1:51:05] people of God and it wasn't very long
[1:51:07] you know what they did it wasn't just
[1:51:08] Chucky jager's fly but they made
[1:51:10] commercial planes where other people
[1:51:11] could get on board glory to
[1:51:13] God wasn't just a pilot but they made
[1:51:16] him commercial I heard this the other
[1:51:18] day that they're actually trying to
[1:51:19] bring those back transatlantic flight in
[1:51:20] just a few hours it make a trip to
[1:51:22] London a day trip they're trying to
[1:51:23] bring them back but is it something but
[1:51:25] here they made commercial flights that
[1:51:27] would fly supersonic speed I believe
[1:51:30] that's what's happened in the church
[1:51:31] today here the pilot has gone on that
[1:51:33] that under that great Eagle anointing
[1:51:35] that would break through and show the
[1:51:36] church the access to the Holy Ghost it
[1:51:39] was it was the access that here here's
[1:51:41] the true word of God here's the here's
[1:51:43] the Holy Ghost it wasn't to start a a
[1:51:45] belief or start some thing where people
[1:51:47] get all this stuff that people do it was
[1:51:49] to show you that there was a real access
[1:51:50] to the throne of God he showed the way
[1:51:52] to get past the
[1:51:54] guards and to be able to receive the
[1:51:56] very Promises of God in this hour he
[1:51:58] said we're but them out what I got to do
[1:52:00] to receive them can I just say it get on
[1:52:04] board how do I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:52:07] get on board how do I receive the
[1:52:09] promises of God get on board how do I
[1:52:11] get past this sphar of pressure that's
[1:52:13] on my life get on board won you stand to
[1:52:16] your feet this
[1:52:18] morning I love what he said Chuck Jager
[1:52:23] he said there was a barrier he said but
[1:52:26] the real barrier it wasn't in the sky
[1:52:27] they thought there was a barrier you'd
[1:52:28] had to break he said the real barrier
[1:52:30] wasn't even in the sky he said the real
[1:52:32] barrier was in our knowledge and
[1:52:34] experience of SuperSonic flight the real
[1:52:37] barrier was in our own thoughts isn't
[1:52:39] that where it is today where's the real
[1:52:41] barrier it's in our own thinking that we
[1:52:44] can't break through to a move of God
[1:52:46] can't break through to a supernatural
[1:52:48] move of God but friends let me tell you
[1:52:50] I believe we've had a sonic boom today
[1:52:53] I believe the church is moving at an
[1:52:54] all-time high I believe that we're I
[1:52:57] believe that we are that we're we're a
[1:52:58] church that's living under an eagle
[1:53:00] anointing that's broke through the the
[1:53:02] barrier of denominationalism and broke
[1:53:04] through the barrier of fear and broke
[1:53:05] through the barrier of unbelief and
[1:53:07] through the barrier of the
[1:53:09] Unseen we broke broke through the
[1:53:12] barrier to live again do you believe
[1:53:16] that I wonder how many say brother man
[1:53:18] that's my prayer I want to break through
[1:53:19] the
[1:53:20] barrier say how do I do it get on board
[1:53:23] on board with what with the baptism of
[1:53:25] the Holy
[1:53:26] Ghost on board with an eagle anointing
[1:53:29] that would take the church to a higher
[1:53:31] Heights don't let it be what what men
[1:53:34] say it is and they can paint you any
[1:53:36] picture do you realize I know I'm done
[1:53:39] preaching I've done lie to y'all me
[1:53:41] y'all may as well fire
[1:53:42] me do you realize how easy it is to
[1:53:45] deceive people you think about what the
[1:53:47] world does the media all they have to do
[1:53:50] is change the definition of something
[1:53:52] and then say then they make up a word
[1:53:54] and now everybody falls under that
[1:53:56] definition so if I if I say it this
[1:53:58] morning say all all blondes or are to be
[1:54:02] a cult it means to be blond-headed
[1:54:05] that's what a cult means be blond-headed
[1:54:08] so then you could look around and say
[1:54:10] well she's in one she's in one she's in
[1:54:12] one she's in one he's in one why because
[1:54:14] they were blond-headed he said well
[1:54:15] how'd you do that change the definition
[1:54:17] of what a cult was so as long I make the
[1:54:20] definition fit my narrative well then I
[1:54:22] can turn around and apply everybody to
[1:54:23] it because it fits my narrative my
[1:54:25] definition why do you think they
[1:54:26] redefine things all the time it's what
[1:54:28] the media does re redefine things that
[1:54:31] where can fit you in it but I'm not
[1:54:32] going to let them redefine me you you
[1:54:34] can call it what you want you can you
[1:54:36] can make up a definition you can call
[1:54:38] but but I'm not going to let them
[1:54:38] redefine me I know what I am I'm a
[1:54:42] fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church
[1:54:45] that believes the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:54:48] the message of apostle Paul and I
[1:54:49] believe God in this hour has seen an
[1:54:51] eagle anointing to to call the church
[1:54:53] back to that very thing I don't think it
[1:54:55] was a new message I believe it was the
[1:54:56] same message that Paul preached and
[1:54:58] that's what the church ought to be today
[1:55:00] not to lift up a man or to lift up a
[1:55:02] people but to lift up Jesus Christ above
[1:55:05] why because he's the ego standard for
[1:55:08] the Church of the Living God that's what
[1:55:10] I believe this
[1:55:12] morning do you believe that this morning
[1:55:15] amen let's just bow our heads gracious
[1:55:16] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord
[1:55:19] for your word this morning God I pray I
[1:55:22] pray you'd forgive me Lord I didn't mean
[1:55:23] to go so long and Lord I pray you'd help
