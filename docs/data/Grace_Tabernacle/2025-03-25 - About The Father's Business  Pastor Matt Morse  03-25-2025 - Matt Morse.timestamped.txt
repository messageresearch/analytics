[6:10] Let's all stand and sing that chorus.
[6:13] Oh, and the more that I
[6:19] surrender, higher my
[6:23] Lord, the more that I release my cares,
[6:29] the more you take
[6:33] control. And the more that I can humble
[6:39] myself, the more he lifts me up. Oh,
[6:44] every day I
[6:47] live. Lord, I love you
[6:53] more. Oh, it gets
[6:56] easier to
[6:59] understand this road I'm traveling down.
[7:05] No more
[7:07] wavering or
[7:09] wondering. I'm standing on solid
[7:14] ground. Oh, and I know I'm heading to my
[7:18] future home. And the voice I hear is
[7:23] yours alone. Every day I
[7:27] live. Lord, I love you
[7:34] more. And it's the more that I
[7:39] surrender, the
[7:41] lighter my
[7:44] Lord. Oh, the more that I release my
[7:49] cares, the more you take
[7:54] control. And the more that I can humble
[7:59] myself, the more he lifts me up. Oh,
[8:05] every day I
[8:07] live. Lord, I love you. Let's sing that
[8:11] second verse.
[8:14] Oh, when the problems I had on
[8:20] yesterday are stepping stones to a
[8:23] higher place. The trials that seem so
[8:28] awesome to me are now my patterns of
[8:34] victory. And I know I'm headed to my
[8:39] future home. And the voice I hear is
[8:44] yours alone. Every day I
[8:48] live. Lord, I
[8:50] love. Oh, if that's your prayer this
[8:53] morning, just lift your hand and sing it
[8:54] to him. Oh, the more that I
[9:00] surrender, the
[9:02] lighter my
[9:05] Lord. Oh, the more that I release my
[9:10] cares, the more you take
[9:15] control. And the more that I can humble
[9:20] myself, the more you lift me up. Oh,
[9:25] every day I
[9:28] live. Lord, I love you
[9:33] more. I mean, you can say that's your
[9:35] prayer this morning. Just come just
[9:37] whatever we have burdened down, we could
[9:38] just surrender to him and let him take
[9:40] control this morning. Want to welcome

[25:18] [Music]
[25:35] [Music]
[25:45] If it's a
[25:47] foreign
[25:49] battlefield where I
[25:51] finally find your
[25:54] will, Lord, that's
[25:56] where I long to be.
[26:04] In a desert without a drink or some old
[26:09] ship about to
[26:12] sink. Lord, I'll go if you'll just speak
[26:18] to
[26:21] me. Oh, speak the word,
[26:25] Lord. My ears long to hear you.

[27:12] grain. I recall those times you took me
[27:18] to my
[27:21] knees. But there's one thing I can do.
[27:27] And I still owe these thanks to you that
[27:32] you Lord

[28:20] [Music]
[28:22] Now, there's been times that I've
[28:26] complained as life rubbed against the
[28:31] grain. And I recall those times you took
[28:36] me to my
[28:40] knees. But there's one thing I can do,
[28:46] and I still give these thanks to
[28:50] you. that you
[28:52] took my cross to

[29:35] serant will
[29:45] go. God will make a way. God will make a
[29:49] way. We ask the Lord just to speak to
[29:51] you this morning. I mean, aren't you
[29:54] thankful? You know, Brother Andrew said
[29:55] this, I think it was last service, he
[29:57] said, you know, if God calls you to
[29:59] something, everything you need for that
[30:01] calling, he'll place in front of you and
[30:02] there for you and he'll provide for you.
[30:05] So, no matter what you're going through,
[30:06] God will make a way for you this
[30:08] morning. Let's just sing this song. Oh
[30:13] God who will make a
[30:18] way when there seems to be no way.
[30:24] Oh, forever. He is
[30:29] faithful. And
[30:31] he will make a
[30:36] road when you bear a heavy
[30:41] load. And I
[30:44] know, oh, God will make I'll sing that
[30:48] chorus once
[30:49] more. And
[30:51] God will make a
[30:57] way when there seems to be no way. Can
[31:02] you say he's
[31:03] faithful ever? He is
[31:07] faithful and
[31:09] he will make a
[31:14] road when you bear a heavy load.
[31:20] And I
[31:23] know God will make sing that first
[31:27] verse.
[31:28] But oh, it must have felt strange to end
[31:33] up
[31:34] stranded between an army and the sea. It
[31:40] must have been forsaken, wondering why.
[31:45] God said it all they would. it
[31:50] be. But when your back's against the
[31:55] wall, that's the hardest place of
[32:00] all. Oh, but somewhere between
[32:05] provision and
[32:09] impossibility. Oh, I know that
[32:13] God will make a way.
[32:19] when there seems to be no
[32:23] way. Forever he is
[32:28] faithful and
[32:30] he will make a
[32:35] road when you bear a heavy
[32:40] load. And I
[32:44] know God will make the
[32:48] ring. And when all the
[32:53] circumstances leaves you crying in the
[32:58] night and you struggle till your
[33:02] strength is almost
[33:06] gone. Yes, God will gently hold you in
[33:12] the shelter of the
[33:16] song and he'll carve a road for you to
[33:21] carry on.
[33:25] I know my
[33:28] God will make a
[33:33] way when there seems to be no
[33:39] way forever.
[33:41] He is
[33:44] faithful and
[33:46] he will make a
[33:51] road when you bear a heavy
[33:56] load and I
[33:59] know oh God will make a way. Aren't you
[34:04] thankful for that this morning? Let's

[46:23] all that out to our good. Amen. So I
[46:25] always believe that and just trust the
[46:27] Lord. So, we just want to remember in
[46:29] prayer uh for my friend Joy Ashlock
[46:33] having surgery on her legs. That's from
[46:34] Sister Joyce. Also for Cody Treadway not
[46:38] feeling well this morning, just remember
[46:40] him in prayer. If you have a need on
[46:42] your heart, won't you just lift your
[46:43] hand to the Lord and we just want to
[46:45] invite the Lord to come and before we
[46:48] open the word and and allow him to come
[46:50] and anoint the word. I know we have
[46:51] needs and I know God knows those needs.
[46:54] He's mindful of us and we just ask him
[46:57] to come and and take this word and
[46:59] enlighten it to our hearts. How many
[47:00] would do that this morning? Lord, let
[47:02] something come alive. Let me catch a
[47:04] revelation in the word of God that would
[47:05] bring me closer to you. Amen. Let's just
[47:08] bow our heads and ask him to come.
[47:09] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just
[47:12] love you, Lord, this morning. God, we're
[47:14] so thankful of your presence, Lord.
[47:16] We're mindful of you here, Lord. We
[47:19] thank you for all that you do for us,
[47:21] Lord. And God, the work that you've done
[47:23] amongst your children, among your
[47:25] church. And Lord, we just ask you, Lord,
[47:27] that you would come and anoint this
[47:29] word. And God, I pray that it would go
[47:31] forth and take every sickness, Lord, out
[47:33] of this building, Lord. Any spirit that
[47:35] is unlike you, Lord, let it be bound
[47:37] this morning. God, we just want to read
[47:39] the word and Lord, allow you to anoint
[47:41] it, Lord, that we would catch something
[47:43] in there, Lord, that would draw us
[47:44] closer unto you. And Lord, just to that
[47:47] time of departure, Lord, we just thank
[47:50] you for all you do for us, Lord. We give
[47:52] you the glory for for the greatness that
[47:54] you've given us. And Lord, we just ask
[47:56] you to be with us this morning. We thank
[47:58] you in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[48:01] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We just
[48:04] want to invite you uh to the scripture.
[48:06] We're going to read out of Galatians the
[48:08] fourth chapter and we'll start in the
[48:10] first verse and pick up on uh the series
[48:12] that we've been speaking on out of the
[48:14] book of Galatians. And uh we had started
[48:16] in the in Galatians 3 and had gone
[48:19] through uh all of what apostle Paul had
[48:22] been bringing to the Galatian church.
[48:24] And of course we realize that this was
[48:27] not just for the Galatians. It was for
[48:28] us and it was written uh in the
[48:31] scripture for how many believes that?
[48:33] Amen. God bless you. So it was written
[48:35] there for us. But I want to read out of
[48:37] Galatians the 4th chapter and then we
[48:39] also want to read out of Luke the 18th
[48:41] chapter in the first verse. So, uh,
[48:43] Galatians 4, and we're just going to
[48:45] read the first two verses this morning.
[48:46] He says, "Now I say that the heir, as
[48:49] long as he is a child, differereth
[48:51] nothing from a servant, though he be the
[48:53] lord of all, but is under tutors and
[48:55] governors until the time appointed of
[48:58] the father." And then I want to also
[49:00] read out of Luke the 18th chapter in the
[49:03] first verse. And the Bible says, "And he
[49:06] spake a parable unto them to this end
[49:09] that men ought always to pray and not to
[49:12] faint, saying that there was in a city a
[49:15] judge who feared not God, neither
[49:17] regarded man." And there was a widow in
[49:20] that city, and she came unto him,
[49:21] saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary."
[49:24] And he would not for a while. But
[49:26] afterward he said within himself,
[49:28] "Though I fear not God, nor regard man,
[49:30] remember this is the unjust judge. Yet
[49:33] because this widow troubleth me, I will
[49:35] avenge her, lest by her continual coming
[49:37] she weary me. And the Lord said, "Hear
[49:40] what the unjust judge saith, and shall
[49:42] not God avenge his own elect, which cry
[49:45] day and night unto him, though he bear
[49:48] along with them." I tell you that he
[49:50] will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless,
[49:52] when the Son of Man cometh, shall he
[49:55] find faith upon the earth." And we'll
[49:57] just ask the Lord to add his blessing to
[50:00] the reading of the word as you take your
[50:01] seats up. And I'd like to uh title this
[50:04] this morning on on um on being about the
[50:09] father's business. Being about the
[50:11] father's business. Last uh Sunday uh we
[50:14] had spoke on becoming sons and how uh
[50:17] that we are the children of God by our
[50:19] faith seed and not by our natural seed.
[50:22] And and uh and I know there was many
[50:24] that was here. It's been a couple
[50:25] Sundays and uh one of the young ladies
[50:27] in the church, he said, "It's it's kind
[50:29] of hard for uh for me to remember one
[50:31] service to the next." So, when you
[50:33] preach a series, you know, sometimes
[50:34] it's it's hard to to pick up where you
[50:36] left off. It's easy for me because I'm
[50:38] studying on it all week. And so, uh,
[50:40] maybe just, uh, to kind of bring
[50:42] everybody up to speed, but, uh, we were
[50:44] speaking on becoming sons and how that,
[50:46] uh, you know, we've been going through
[50:47] Abraham's, uh, seed all the way through,
[50:50] uh, being an heir and and coming into,
[50:52] uh, receiving the the promise of God as
[50:55] the seed of Abraham. And, and, uh, last
[50:57] time we had talked about how that we
[50:58] were the children of God by our faith
[51:00] seed and not by our natural birth. And
[51:03] uh, and not and and we didn't just
[51:05] become sons today. And you know just uh
[51:07] uh becoming a son of God is not by your
[51:10] efforts. It's not by what you can
[51:11] produce or what you can uh what you can
[51:14] manufacture or how good of a Christian
[51:16] you were last week. And if I asked
[51:18] everybody to look back on last week, I'm
[51:19] sure you had some good times and some
[51:21] bad times and uh you said some good
[51:23] things. You probably said some bad
[51:25] things. And you know we you thought some
[51:26] good thoughts and you thought some bad
[51:28] thoughts because we are human beings.
[51:30] But uh but we realize that us becoming
[51:32] sons is not based on decisions that we
[51:34] made in this time or or or efforts that
[51:37] we made. But uh in in fact in the
[51:39] message of the God who is rich in mercy,
[51:41] brother Ramble says this. He said, "I'm
[51:43] only saying this not to mix up doctrine,
[51:45] but I want to straighten it out that we
[51:47] might get away from this fear and scare
[51:49] that you don't know who you are." How
[51:51] many like to get away from that? He said
[51:53] that you are not going to be, but now
[51:55] you are the sons of God. See, you always
[51:58] were the sons of God. And when God had
[52:00] you in his thinking at the beginning,
[52:02] you have to be some part of you. Your
[52:04] life that's in you had to be with God
[52:06] before. Before there was ever material
[52:08] on earth, before there was anything but
[52:10] God, you were one of his attributes. And
[52:13] he knew what your name would be. He knew
[52:15] what color your hair would be. He knew
[52:17] all about you. You see, because you were
[52:19] always a son of God. Have you ever
[52:21] thought about this, Brother Charles?
[52:22] even as a young man and a young woman,
[52:25] you know, other kids, they could go and
[52:26] they could do things and they they could
[52:28] get into all kinds of trouble and lie
[52:30] and cheat and steal and all these
[52:31] things, but but there was something in
[52:33] you that when other kids would do it and
[52:35] it seemed like it never bothered them,
[52:36] but when you would do something wrong,
[52:37] it always bothered you. Something it was
[52:39] troubling that I shouldn't have done
[52:40] that. Anybody ever feel that way but me?
[52:42] You know, but but but because of who you
[52:44] are, but said even though you was yet a
[52:46] sinner, but because there was a God
[52:48] there somewhere here there that God was
[52:50] in there. And so here that little part
[52:52] of God was always telling you that that
[52:54] wasn't right and that wasn't a good
[52:56] thing to do. He said, "But Z see because
[52:58] God was there. It was a little form of
[53:00] life that was in you then." said, ' But
[53:02] then after a little while, you heard the
[53:04] gospel and you uh maybe you went to a
[53:06] church and you went to maybe one church
[53:08] and maybe you went started out in one
[53:09] denomination and then went to another uh
[53:12] picked this one or another. But then one
[53:13] day because you were a part of God, then
[53:16] you had to be a part of God's word. And
[53:18] one day you heard the word of God and
[53:21] when that word sounded in your ears and
[53:23] you heard the word, then you knew where
[53:25] you come from and you knew it was the
[53:26] truth. And and because you were always
[53:29] his seed, you were always it was that
[53:31] word. The word that was see that word
[53:33] that came forth seen the word that was
[53:35] inside of you. And because you were
[53:37] always God, it was in you before the
[53:39] foundation of the world. That word saw
[53:41] it in you. It seen it in you. It called
[53:43] it out in you. And you came to it
[53:45] because of who you were. Isn't that what
[53:48] Paul preached? Paul in in Romans the 8th
[53:50] chapter, he said that's the very
[53:51] fulfillment of Paul's message in Romans
[53:53] 8. He said, "For whom God forneew, he
[53:56] did al also predestinate to be conformed
[53:58] to the image of his son that he might be
[54:01] the firstborn among many brethren." In
[54:03] other words, that you were predestinated
[54:05] to come to this because you always
[54:06] belong to God. So, it wasn't something
[54:09] that just happened. It wasn't something
[54:10] that just heard. It w it wasn't how
[54:12] people tell it today that well, you only
[54:14] believe what you I know how people tell
[54:16] it. You believe what you believe because
[54:18] of who your parents were and because of
[54:19] where you was raised and and because you
[54:21] was raised in a message church, well
[54:23] then you believe the message and because
[54:24] you was raised this way, well, that's
[54:26] the reason you believe what you believe.
[54:27] But that that's not the way it is. But
[54:29] the reality is is that you was raised
[54:31] the way you was raised because of who
[54:33] you are. You was born to who you were
[54:34] born to because of who you are. You was
[54:36] introduced to the message because of who
[54:39] you are. You was always a part of God.
[54:41] God gave you the family that you had. He
[54:43] caused you to be raised up there. He
[54:45] caused you to hear the word at the right
[54:46] time. He caused you to sit in the right
[54:48] atmosphere, be in the right church uh
[54:51] for for the for a season of your life
[54:53] until the right time because God is the
[54:55] one that is in control in control. He's
[54:57] orchestrating our life because we belong
[54:59] to God. And Paul said we were
[55:01] predestinated to be conformed to the
[55:04] image of the son. That means there ain't
[55:05] nothing you could do to stop him. He was
[55:07] predestinated. That mean predestined,
[55:09] predetermined by God to be conformed to
[55:11] the image of God. I know how it is. We
[55:13] try our best to be in his image. We try
[55:16] to manifest the image of God. But Paul
[55:18] said, "You was predestinated to be
[55:19] conformed into his image." That means
[55:21] there ain't no matter how hard you try
[55:23] to uh stop it or how hard you fight
[55:25] against it, brother Wesley, there's
[55:26] something that was predetermined by God
[55:28] that will cause you to be conformed to
[55:30] the image of Jesus Christ. I don't know
[55:33] about y'all, but that makes me feel good
[55:34] this morning. You know why? Cuz I don't
[55:36] ever feel good enough. I don't ever feel
[55:38] like I can do enough or or be worthy
[55:40] enough. But thank God that he would
[55:41] predestinate something in me that would
[55:44] cause me to be conformed to his image.
[55:46] Paul said he was Abraham's seed and he
[55:48] was the firstborn among many. In other
[55:50] words, he was always the son of God. He
[55:52] didn't just become the son of God when
[55:54] he was born. He when he was born of
[55:56] Mary, but he said Jesus Christ was the
[55:58] son of God before the foundation of the
[56:00] world. He was in the father. He was part
[56:02] of the father. Then he was expressed as
[56:04] an attribute of the father just like you
[56:07] and I were. If you belong to God, you
[56:09] always belong to God. Somebody say, I
[56:11] always belong to God. That's why Jesus
[56:15] could make this statement. I've never
[56:17] lost a one because you were already his.
[56:20] He said, I've never lost a one. All that
[56:22] the father has given me will come to me.
[56:24] I've never lost a one. He'll not cast
[56:26] them out. They belong, they belong to
[56:28] him. You belong to God. Listen what
[56:30] Paul's message was. He was in Galatians
[56:32] the third chapter. This is what Paul was
[56:34] battling. He says, "Oh, you foolish
[56:36] Galatians." Remember, he's showing them
[56:38] that receiving the Holy Spirit was not a
[56:40] result of following after the law, but
[56:42] it was only a sign of true faith in
[56:45] Jesus Christ. Isn't that so backwards
[56:47] from the way that that that many times
[56:49] we think of it that that it's that it's
[56:51] result of how good of a Christian we can
[56:53] be. Then we can receive the Holy Ghost.
[56:54] He said, but no, it's a sign of true
[56:56] faith in Jesus Christ. So, in other
[56:58] words, you can say it like this, and we
[56:59] preached this last time, but by faith,
[57:01] you are a child of God. Somebody say, by
[57:03] faith. But Abraham said faith is the
[57:05] keyyn note to the scripture. In other
[57:07] words, the Bible said without faith it
[57:08] is impossible to please to please God.
[57:11] But even in that notice this was when
[57:13] God made this covenant with Abraham
[57:14] knowing that it was based on faith. He
[57:17] said see therefore it is of faith that
[57:19] it might be by grace. So remember what
[57:21] Paul said that God had to make the
[57:24] promise sure. So even when God would
[57:26] give this promise to Abraham, God was so
[57:28] concerned that you would receive the
[57:30] inheritance that lay within this
[57:32] promise. brother quy that he that he was
[57:35] so concerned with you receiving this
[57:37] covenant that he put a a shity upon the
[57:40] promise of God by his own grace. So he
[57:43] said you'd receive it by faith but just
[57:45] so I can make it sure I'm going to give
[57:47] enough grace that it'll be sure to come
[57:48] to pass. I see it's by his grace that
[57:51] the shity of the promise. That's why
[57:53] that's why it's not on our ability.
[57:55] That's why when you don't feel like you
[57:56] can receive it and you don't feel like
[57:57] you're worthy and you don't feel like
[57:59] you can you can fulfill the covenant.
[58:01] But his grace made sure that the
[58:02] covenant would come to pass in your
[58:04] life. It made sure that it would find
[58:06] you. Grace made sure that it didn't
[58:08] matter how far you had gone or how low
[58:10] you were or how how how much that you
[58:13] had amnesia not knowing who God was that
[58:15] grace could still find you because you
[58:17] belong to God. It was assurityity of the
[58:20] purpose of God coming to pass. Now
[58:22] notice as Paul is speaking this, he's
[58:24] speaking of a time when this promise
[58:26] would be fulfilled. He's speaking and I
[58:29] love the terminology that Paul uses
[58:31] because he uses sons and heirs and
[58:33] inheritance. All that stuff I love
[58:35] inheritance, receiving a promise. In
[58:37] other words, you know what it would be
[58:38] like to to receive an inheritance. In
[58:40] other words, you receive a will and and
[58:42] you and all that the father had was
[58:44] given unto you. Remember you remember
[58:45] the story about the the little woman
[58:47] that went to church, Brother Tom, and
[58:48] and here she was, you know, it was in
[58:50] the over in a foreign country where they
[58:52] had stopped people from from being
[58:54] Christians. And here she got up and and
[58:56] she was on her way to to to gather and
[58:58] meet with the saints and have church.
[58:59] And one of the police officers stopped
[59:01] her on the road. When she was on her
[59:02] way, he said, "Lady, where are you off
[59:04] to?" You know, they have a curfew and
[59:05] everything. And she said, "Well, my
[59:07] brother died and I'm off to to hear the
[59:09] reading of the wheel." And here she went
[59:11] off into the church and and they boy,
[59:12] they had them a good service, a good
[59:14] Holy Ghost church service. And on her
[59:16] way back, that same cop stopped her. And
[59:18] he said, "Well," he said, "How did it
[59:19] go?" She said, "Well, I found out he
[59:21] left me everything." I said, "That's the
[59:22] way it is today. He gave us his will and
[59:25] in his will we have an inheritance and
[59:27] and in that inheritance this is what
[59:29] Paul was talking about that there's
[59:30] something that belongs to the believers
[59:32] and here was a people that were living
[59:34] beneath their privilege but of an
[59:37] inheritance that God had given them and
[59:39] Paul said an heir as long as he is a
[59:41] child he's nothing from a servant though
[59:43] he be the lord of all but he's under
[59:45] tutors and governors until the time
[59:47] appointed of the father now notice what
[59:49] Paul is showing he's showing that there
[59:51] is coming a time that no longer is he
[59:53] living as a servant, but there will come
[59:55] a time that he lives as a son. He said,
[59:57] "And so for all this time you've lived
[59:59] as a servant. All this time you've lived
[1:00:01] as ah beneath your your ability or
[1:00:04] beneath your inheritance because you're
[1:00:06] living as a servant. Although inside of
[1:00:08] you is the very ability or the potential
[1:00:11] to be the Lord of all, but you've been a
[1:00:13] servant." But then there comes a time of
[1:00:15] adoption that no longer are you a
[1:00:17] servant, but you become a son. It's a
[1:00:19] and and I love how Paul said it. He said
[1:00:21] he's only under a tutor until the time
[1:00:24] appointed of the father. In other words,
[1:00:25] he's showing us there's a difference of
[1:00:27] a time of tutorship and the time of
[1:00:29] adoption. There's a difference of the
[1:00:30] time of training and the time of
[1:00:32] manifesting. But I I got news for you
[1:00:34] this morning that we're living in an
[1:00:36] appointed time. We're living in a time
[1:00:38] that has been appointed of the father.
[1:00:40] There's a time of prophecy, but there's
[1:00:42] a time of fulfillment. There's a time of
[1:00:44] promise, but then there's a time of
[1:00:46] receiving the promise. I thank God this
[1:00:48] morning when I read my Bible that it's
[1:00:50] not just a time of a word that's being
[1:00:52] promised. It's not the time of something
[1:00:54] future that is to come. But here we are
[1:00:56] living in the last age in the last days
[1:00:59] in the time that has been appointed of
[1:01:01] the father that the sons of God would
[1:01:03] receive the adoption of almighty God.
[1:01:06] The father has a time appointed for the
[1:01:08] church to come to a place of adoption.
[1:01:11] Now we we we realize this according to
[1:01:13] the message. You can read in revelations
[1:01:14] the 10th chapter. Notice I I want you to
[1:01:16] notice the connection between what Paul
[1:01:18] is saying until the time appointed of
[1:01:20] the father. And I'm going to hurry into
[1:01:22] this so I can get where I'm going. But
[1:01:23] but in Revelations 10:4, the Bible says,
[1:01:25] "When the seven thunders uttered their
[1:01:27] voices, I was about to write, I heard a
[1:01:29] voice from heaven saying unto me, seal
[1:01:31] up those things which the seven thunders
[1:01:33] uttered and write them not." Now notice
[1:01:35] whenever God tells John to seal these
[1:01:38] things, this was not a seal that would
[1:01:40] last forever. It was not an eternal or
[1:01:42] an everlasting seal, but it was only a
[1:01:44] seal until a certain time. Now, we're
[1:01:47] talking about an appointed time. So, he
[1:01:48] says, "Seal up these things until," you
[1:01:51] say, "Well, what time?" He tells us in
[1:01:52] the seventh verse. He said, "But in the
[1:01:54] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:01:56] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:01:58] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:02:00] hath declared to his servants the
[1:02:02] prophets." Now, we know in the Amplified
[1:02:04] Bible, it would say it like this, that
[1:02:06] God's mystery, in other words, God's
[1:02:08] hidden purpose would be completed at
[1:02:10] this time, at the voice at the at the at
[1:02:13] the at the the voice of the seventh
[1:02:15] angel, that God's hidden purpose, it was
[1:02:17] the time of appointed of the father that
[1:02:19] his hidden purpose would be completed.
[1:02:21] So, we're looking all through the
[1:02:23] scripture here when John writes this
[1:02:25] down 2,000 years ago. Here he wrote in
[1:02:28] the book of Revelations that there's
[1:02:29] coming a time appointed of the father
[1:02:32] that the mystery of God would be
[1:02:33] finished. It would and now notice what
[1:02:36] it would do. It was a hidden purpose but
[1:02:38] it would be completed in this time. In
[1:02:40] other words, that there's something that
[1:02:41] is going to take place that would bring
[1:02:43] the children of God back to their
[1:02:45] father. Here Paul would call it a time
[1:02:47] of adoption. It it's a time that we're
[1:02:49] not living as servants but the time that
[1:02:51] we're going to come forth as sons. And
[1:02:53] so here, this appointed time that God is
[1:02:56] calling out, there had to some come
[1:02:57] something that would cause children to
[1:02:59] come to this place of adoption or
[1:03:01] children. Y'all know where I'm going
[1:03:02] with this, but but but children that
[1:03:04] would come to their back to their
[1:03:05] father. But wasn't that the very purpose
[1:03:07] of what Malachi 4 came for? The Bible
[1:03:10] said it was to turn the heart of
[1:03:11] children back to their fathers to bring
[1:03:13] them. In other words, you can say it
[1:03:15] like this. The purpose of Malachi 4 was
[1:03:17] to bring them to their place of
[1:03:19] adoption. That was the purpose of the
[1:03:20] message. you it it was not to leave us
[1:03:23] as servants. It wasn't to leave you
[1:03:24] wandering or or leave you back back
[1:03:27] there where the back there where the
[1:03:28] church was in its infancy, but it was to
[1:03:31] bring the church to this place of
[1:03:33] maturity that God could receive it unto
[1:03:35] himself. God's looking for a full-grown
[1:03:38] church. He's looking for a mature bride.
[1:03:40] He's coming for a mature people of God
[1:03:42] that are feeding on the meat of the
[1:03:44] word. That's what God's waiting on.
[1:03:47] I know there's a lot of people that
[1:03:48] don't want that. They they like the
[1:03:49] milk. Well, that's wonderful. You know,
[1:03:51] put it in the sippy cup and drink it all
[1:03:52] you want to, but but there's room at the
[1:03:54] table for the meat of God's word. And I
[1:03:56] thank God that there's some meat eaters
[1:03:58] in this hour that ain't just looking for
[1:04:00] some feel-good sermon, but we're looking
[1:04:02] for the meat of God's word. There's too
[1:04:04] many sitting around the table just
[1:04:06] playing. That's what my mama used to
[1:04:07] tell me. Quit playing with your food and
[1:04:08] go ahead and eat it. It's the meat of
[1:04:10] God's word. Go ahead and fill up on it.
[1:04:12] It don't have to be milk. Sometimes you
[1:04:13] have to push through and just eat the
[1:04:15] meat. But it's the meat of God's word
[1:04:16] that makes you a mature Christian to
[1:04:19] see. So there's coming a time that's
[1:04:20] appointed of the father to reveal his
[1:04:22] hidden purpose. It's this place of
[1:04:24] adoption. You realize that the Bible
[1:04:26] would tell us that that's what this
[1:04:27] world is waiting on. The Bible said the
[1:04:30] whole the earnest expectation of the
[1:04:32] creature is waiting on the manifestation
[1:04:34] of the sons of God. In other words, the
[1:04:36] earth is looking for the sons of God to
[1:04:39] be manifested. You know what they've
[1:04:41] done? They've tried many ways to
[1:04:42] manifest that very thing. Well, they
[1:04:44] tried it by having a great revival, but
[1:04:46] it never manifested sons of God. They
[1:04:48] tried to have great campaigns, but it
[1:04:50] didn't manifest sons of God. They could
[1:04:51] have healing campaigns, but it wouldn't
[1:04:53] manifest sons of God. They They could
[1:04:55] make great unions, but it wouldn't
[1:04:56] manifest sons of God. We could have
[1:04:58] great big meetings, but it'll never
[1:04:59] manifest sons of God. But there ain't
[1:05:01] but one thing with that will. It'll take
[1:05:03] the revelation of the word to manifest
[1:05:06] adopted sons of God. It takes God's
[1:05:08] revealed word in this hour to manifest
[1:05:11] an adopted son. I want you to hold on to
[1:05:12] that just a minute. It takes God's
[1:05:14] revealed word. So in other words, if
[1:05:16] it's going to take God's word revealed,
[1:05:18] it would have to bring a spirit in the
[1:05:19] last tower to take the mystery of God
[1:05:22] and open it up and reveal it to the
[1:05:24] church that we can manifest what God has
[1:05:26] called us to manifest. And the Leoian
[1:05:29] church age, he said, now this messenger
[1:05:30] of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 is going
[1:05:33] to do two things. One, according to
[1:05:35] Malachi 4, it'll turn the hearts of the
[1:05:37] children to the fathers. Two, he'll
[1:05:39] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:05:41] thunders in Revelations 10, which are
[1:05:43] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:05:44] seals. And it will be these divinely
[1:05:47] revealed mystery truths that literally
[1:05:49] turn the hearts of the children to their
[1:05:51] Pentecostal fathers. It, in other words,
[1:05:54] it'll take the message to bring the
[1:05:56] children to this place of adoption. I
[1:05:58] know because this world is trying, you
[1:06:00] know, I know how people they they try to
[1:06:02] separate the the message and the Bible
[1:06:04] and all the all these things that
[1:06:05] they're trying to do. But do you realize
[1:06:07] the only thing that'll ever bring this
[1:06:08] church to a place of adoption is the
[1:06:10] message of the hour. It's a divinely
[1:06:12] revealed truth. It's the only thing
[1:06:14] that'll bring us to this place. And Paul
[1:06:16] said we're under that spirit today. He
[1:06:18] said we're under the spirit of adoption
[1:06:20] where whereby we cry aba father. And I
[1:06:22] say this today that the spirit of
[1:06:24] adoption is present among the church.
[1:06:26] That's the very spirit. You say, "Well,
[1:06:28] what will it do?" It'll cause you to
[1:06:30] become one with the word of God. It'll
[1:06:32] cause you to manifest or the word to be
[1:06:34] manifested into you. Or don't you
[1:06:36] realize that there ain't no man that can
[1:06:38] manifest it by himself. You couldn't
[1:06:40] manifest the word of God. We try our
[1:06:42] best to do it. We We try to produce the
[1:06:44] word. We try to live the best we can. We
[1:06:46] try You can recite all the Bible you
[1:06:48] want to. You can memorize all the
[1:06:50] scriptures you want to, but you can
[1:06:51] never get this life to manifest the word
[1:06:54] of God on your own. You don't have the
[1:06:56] ability to manifest it. You can't work
[1:06:58] it enough. You can't muster it up. You
[1:07:00] can't do enough good. You can't make a
[1:07:02] big enough resume to manifest the word
[1:07:04] of God. But Abraham said, "There ain't
[1:07:06] no way you can educate it into you. You
[1:07:08] can't join it. You can't baptize into
[1:07:10] it. There's no way of doing it. There
[1:07:12] ain't but one way for this nature to
[1:07:14] manifest God's word, and that's to kill
[1:07:17] it and let it be born again."
[1:07:19] Hello, somebody. Let a new nature come
[1:07:22] in. That's the only way is to kill that
[1:07:24] nature of yourself and then the word
[1:07:26] becomes a living thing and it just
[1:07:28] expresses itself through you and then
[1:07:30] you're looking in a looking glass and
[1:07:32] people see you as a mirror. You know
[1:07:34] that's the way that God made it. You
[1:07:37] know why he said cuz people don't read
[1:07:39] their Bible anymore so God has made you
[1:07:42] a Bible. Glory. They don't read their
[1:07:45] Bible anymore. So God made you a Bible.
[1:07:47] He said see what do you do? People's
[1:07:49] looking at you. God sent his mirror. his
[1:07:52] expression of himself in his prophets
[1:07:53] because the word came to the prophets.
[1:07:55] They expressed God in the prophecy that
[1:07:57] God gave them. But now God expresses
[1:08:00] himself through his son Christ Jesus.
[1:08:02] And he takes us in as adopted children
[1:08:05] and he puts his spirit in us crying aba
[1:08:08] father or in other words my god my god.
[1:08:11] And then the holy spirit in us is Christ
[1:08:14] spirit expressing Jesus Christ. Isn't
[1:08:17] that wonderful? So the very expression
[1:08:18] of God was manifested in Jesus Christ.
[1:08:22] He said, "But then Christ takes us in as
[1:08:24] adopted sons puts that same word that's
[1:08:27] that's that's in you and he brings it to
[1:08:29] life that you can express God." That the
[1:08:31] very my something is so it's so hard to
[1:08:34] look at your flesh, brother Tom and
[1:08:35] thing that I'm expressing God and in the
[1:08:38] in all my failures, but I'm expressing
[1:08:39] God. But something in your nature is
[1:08:41] expressing God because there's God in
[1:08:44] there. Right. We get messed up in our
[1:08:46] flesh and we we get all we all it just
[1:08:48] seems like that's the focus of everybody
[1:08:50] is this old flesh man. But but let our
[1:08:52] focus be on the real thing. It's the
[1:08:54] expression of God that is in our lives.
[1:08:57] See, that's the age that we're living
[1:08:58] in. The age of adoption, the age of
[1:09:01] manifesting, manifesting God. It's the
[1:09:03] time of adoption. It's the It's the time
[1:09:05] of divinely revealed truth. That's
[1:09:07] right. Listen what the Bible said. He
[1:09:09] said at the sounding of the seventh
[1:09:11] angel, it'll reveal God's hidden
[1:09:13] purpose. Now, here's what I want you to
[1:09:15] catch this morning. It'll reveal God's
[1:09:16] hidden purpose. Now, notice this is a
[1:09:18] teaching. Brother Bum would preach the
[1:09:20] message on the seventh seal. Are y'all
[1:09:21] with me? Can just a just a few minutes?
[1:09:23] He would preach a message on on the
[1:09:24] seventh seal. I want to take my time
[1:09:26] just so you catch it. But but notice
[1:09:28] when he preached the six when he when he
[1:09:30] was preaching on the seventh seal, he
[1:09:31] speaks of the sixth seal and he says the
[1:09:33] sixth seal had a three-fold purpose. And
[1:09:35] remember, he had gone through it. But
[1:09:37] then he also he said but the seventh
[1:09:39] seal had a three-fold purpose as well.
[1:09:41] Now, if you if you'll go on and listen
[1:09:43] to Christ the mystery of God revealed,
[1:09:45] you'll find out what that purpose was.
[1:09:47] And Christ the mystery. He says that God
[1:09:49] wanted to be revealed in his son. That
[1:09:51] was the first. Then he wanted the life
[1:09:53] of his son to be in his church. And then
[1:09:56] he wanted to take the church or the
[1:09:58] bride back to that Eden condition.
[1:10:00] Remember the the relationship with God
[1:10:02] that had been lost. So this is God's
[1:10:03] three-fold purpose. It was he wanted to
[1:10:05] be revealed in his son. He wanted that
[1:10:07] that son to have preeminence in the
[1:10:09] church. And then he wanted to take the
[1:10:11] church back to this Eden condition. So
[1:10:13] then whenever you then you go on and
[1:10:15] listen to the rapture uh message, you'll
[1:10:17] see he would when he was preaching this,
[1:10:19] he would say the bride is waiting on a
[1:10:21] revelation. Now I've heard many take
[1:10:23] that and and preach that that way and
[1:10:24] say we're waiting on a revelation and
[1:10:26] that revelation is going to take us into
[1:10:28] a rapture. But the reality is if you'll
[1:10:29] listen to the whole the whole uh uh
[1:10:31] sermon uh just a few minutes later, he
[1:10:34] tells us what the revelation is. So it's
[1:10:36] not like today we're still waiting on he
[1:10:37] said we're waiting on a revelation. But
[1:10:39] here is that revelation. It's in the
[1:10:41] three-fold purpose. And he takes that in
[1:10:43] first Thessalonians. It's the shout and
[1:10:45] the voice and the trump of God. So now
[1:10:48] you can find these you you take the the
[1:10:50] the the connection of these things and
[1:10:52] go all through the scripture and you'll
[1:10:53] see this as being God's purpose in the
[1:10:56] end time. Remember remember I'm talking
[1:10:58] about an appointed time. I'm talking
[1:10:59] about a time of adoption. Paul's Paul's
[1:11:02] telling when the church is going to come
[1:11:03] to this place or we're going to come out
[1:11:05] of servantthood and become sons of God.
[1:11:07] And so he says, see see all through the
[1:11:10] scripture we'll find this even today. So
[1:11:12] watch in Christ the mystery. It was the
[1:11:13] revelation of of the of the son of God.
[1:11:16] And then it was it was the it was the
[1:11:18] the the the preeminence of him in the
[1:11:20] church and then it was a taken away.
[1:11:22] Watch. It was a three-fold purpose. Now
[1:11:24] watch what Paul said. It was a
[1:11:25] tutorship. It's the maturing of the son
[1:11:28] and it's the changing of the body,
[1:11:29] right? It's the fullness of adoption.
[1:11:31] That's that's why the fullness of
[1:11:32] adoption is our body change. You won't
[1:11:34] receive it on this side of earth. So
[1:11:37] watch, it's still a three-fold purpose,
[1:11:38] brother. I'm going to say the shout, the
[1:11:40] voice, and the trump. First
[1:11:41] Thessalonians, it's a three-fold
[1:11:43] purpose. So I can say this like this
[1:11:45] today. You say, "Well, what is that
[1:11:47] three-fold purpose?" Here's how you can
[1:11:48] see it. It's the message of the hour.
[1:11:51] It's the bride believing the message and
[1:11:53] then it's the body change. So here it's
[1:11:55] what God is sending in this hour to
[1:11:58] bring the church to a place of adoption.
[1:12:00] It's you believing it. That's our our
[1:12:01] tutorship under the Holy Ghost is you
[1:12:04] believe in that. That's that's what
[1:12:05] allows the preeminence of Christ to come
[1:12:07] into the church is you believe in the
[1:12:09] message that God sent. If God would send
[1:12:11] you, think about it. If God's going to
[1:12:13] have to change them, he's going to have
[1:12:14] to change their body. He would have to
[1:12:16] change them from a servant to a son. He
[1:12:18] would have to bring them to a place of
[1:12:20] adoption. Then he would have to send
[1:12:22] something that would bring them from a
[1:12:23] child back to their father. That was
[1:12:25] what Malachi 4 was. It was to turn the
[1:12:27] heart of the children to their fathers.
[1:12:29] And then would come the changing of the
[1:12:31] body or the rapturing of the church.
[1:12:34] See, that's why that's why God sent a
[1:12:35] message in this hour. It was to bring
[1:12:38] rapturing faith. It was there. You
[1:12:40] You'll never get it outside of that.
[1:12:41] That's why you hear message preachers
[1:12:43] preaching and saying, "You'll not go in
[1:12:44] the rapture without the message of the
[1:12:46] hour." That's the only thing that brings
[1:12:48] a rapture because that's what takes us
[1:12:50] and turns our heart back to the father.
[1:12:53] That's what brings us to the fullness of
[1:12:55] our adoption. It's the message of the
[1:12:57] hour. Well, I don't know about you, but
[1:12:58] that does something to me. It's God's
[1:13:00] three-fold purpose. Receiving. You see,
[1:13:02] you can't do it without the message.
[1:13:03] Don't let somebody tell you that because
[1:13:05] it ain't true. You have to have the
[1:13:07] message to make a rapture. That was the
[1:13:09] very purpose of God sending the message
[1:13:11] in this hour for you to make a rapture.
[1:13:14] It was to bring you out of
[1:13:15] Pentecostalism and denominationalism and
[1:13:18] intellectualism and bring you into the
[1:13:20] place of a of a sunship to where you can
[1:13:22] receive the adoption of God. That's the
[1:13:25] purpose of the message. You won't get
[1:13:27] there without it. Say, see, but what
[1:13:30] does it do? It'll bring rapturing faith.
[1:13:32] Can I ask you this? I feel like
[1:13:34] preaching for a minute. Can I ask you
[1:13:36] where does true faith come from? See,
[1:13:38] the Bible says faith I know the answer.
[1:13:40] Faith cometh by hearing of the word.
[1:13:41] Well, that's good. But in a sense, let
[1:13:45] let me say it like this. The only reason
[1:13:47] that hearing the word gives you faith is
[1:13:49] because the word has been vindicated.
[1:13:52] So if God's word never came to pass,
[1:13:54] then you could read the word all you
[1:13:55] want. It would never give you faith.
[1:13:57] Say, "Well, but well but God never does
[1:13:58] it. Everything he says it never happens.
[1:14:00] He said he was going to lead the
[1:14:02] children of Israel and they let him and
[1:14:03] and he never let him. He never, you
[1:14:04] know, all the things. If nothing but
[1:14:06] God's word came to pass, well then you
[1:14:07] could read his word. It wouldn't it
[1:14:09] wouldn't give you faith. But it gives
[1:14:11] you faith because his word is vindicated
[1:14:13] to you. So when you see the word being
[1:14:16] vindicated, that's where true faith
[1:14:17] comes from. So see, when you read it,
[1:14:20] you you can hear that word and and he
[1:14:21] says he says, "I I am the Lord thy God
[1:14:23] that health all thy diseases." You say,
[1:14:25] "Amen." There's a faith that comes from
[1:14:27] that because you recognize God as a
[1:14:29] healer. You've seen the healing
[1:14:30] attribute of God as it's been displayed
[1:14:33] down through the ages. When God said,
[1:14:34] "Let there be light." There was light.
[1:14:36] You see the effects of it or or or the
[1:14:38] promise of God coming to pass. And
[1:14:39] because that word has been vindicated to
[1:14:41] you, then when you hear the word, it
[1:14:43] gives you faith. So you can say this a
[1:14:45] word. It's not just a word, but it's a
[1:14:47] word vindicated is where true faith
[1:14:49] comes from. Ma matter of fact, I can
[1:14:50] show you this in the scripture in Luke
[1:14:52] 24th chapter. When Jesus comes to the
[1:14:54] disciples, remember when he appears to
[1:14:56] them, he gives them a promise of the
[1:14:58] Holy Ghost. Notice he says, "Do you tar
[1:15:00] in Jerusalem until you're endued with
[1:15:02] power from on high?" But do you realize
[1:15:05] that that that the power wasn't in the
[1:15:07] promise? There was a potential for
[1:15:08] power. Now, I know I know we preached
[1:15:10] that, but that's because the potential
[1:15:12] is laying there, but but it'd be just
[1:15:13] like the the man that was blind that
[1:15:15] Jesus told him, "Go wash in the pool of
[1:15:17] Saleom and you'll receive your sight."
[1:15:19] The man could have said, "I believe it.
[1:15:20] That's a promise of God. I'm going to
[1:15:21] receive my sight." But had he never went
[1:15:23] and washed in the pool, he would have
[1:15:24] never came sick. See, see the So the
[1:15:27] potential for power lay in the promise
[1:15:29] of God, go wash in the pool, you'll
[1:15:31] receive your sight. So So the potential
[1:15:33] for power is there, but the power
[1:15:35] actually came after the fulfillment came
[1:15:37] in the upper room. Jesus said when you
[1:15:39] tar here until power until you're endued
[1:15:42] with power from on high. So the
[1:15:44] potential lay in the promise. But when
[1:15:46] they were in the upper room and the Holy
[1:15:47] Ghost fell, then the power of God fell
[1:15:49] upon them. You see, notice when the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost fell, it wasn't just in promise
[1:15:54] then, but it was in vindication. It
[1:15:56] vindicated the word that Jesus had
[1:15:58] spoke. Now, the very promise that he had
[1:16:01] made had came to pass in their life. And
[1:16:03] now, because you realize that Jesus had
[1:16:05] appear appeared before them many times,
[1:16:08] but they never had power. But now,
[1:16:10] because the vindication of the promise
[1:16:12] that he had made, and when they saw that
[1:16:14] vindication, it changed their nature. No
[1:16:17] longer did they hide up in an upper
[1:16:18] room, but they boldly went down on the
[1:16:20] street and said, "In the name of Jesus
[1:16:22] Christ, you can receive your healing. In
[1:16:24] the name of Jesus Christ, you can
[1:16:26] receive salvation." They weren't hiding.
[1:16:29] They weren't cowards. They had received
[1:16:31] power by the vindication of the word of
[1:16:33] God. See, so it's vindication that
[1:16:36] brings faith. It brings or or in other
[1:16:39] words, it brings you to another level of
[1:16:41] faith. That that's why it's important to
[1:16:42] receive vindication. It can't be a
[1:16:44] guess. We can't just be be guessing and
[1:16:46] hoping and wishing and all these things
[1:16:48] that people do, but we must see the
[1:16:50] vindication of the word of God. That's
[1:16:52] what brings rapture and faith. That's
[1:16:54] why God don't give every man the same
[1:16:56] gift. Otherwise, there'd be no
[1:16:58] vindication. Well, they all have it. So,
[1:16:59] whose word is true? But God, there's
[1:17:02] there's one to an age for a reason. God
[1:17:04] didn't give that gift to everybody. That
[1:17:06] the gift of discernment that Brother
[1:17:07] Benham had, he didn't give that to
[1:17:08] everybody. I know people go around doing
[1:17:10] it and all. Sometimes they're right,
[1:17:12] sometimes they're wrong, but he didn't
[1:17:13] give that to everybody. It was a
[1:17:14] vindication of his ministry of the
[1:17:17] message that we'd be able to receive it.
[1:17:19] Think about it. Otherwise, it'd be
[1:17:20] confusion like we have with with four
[1:17:22] million churches reading the same Bible.
[1:17:24] That's confusion. But he brought a
[1:17:26] vindication. Now notice, vindication is
[1:17:28] what's going to give us faith. Somebody
[1:17:29] say vindication. Vindication brings
[1:17:31] faith. Listen, Luke 18, Jesus is given
[1:17:34] this parable. He said, "There was in a
[1:17:36] city a judge which feared not God and
[1:17:37] regardeth not man. Oh, and there was a
[1:17:40] widow in that same city, and she came
[1:17:41] unto him, saying, Avenge me of my
[1:17:43] adversary, he would not for a while. But
[1:17:45] afterwards, he said, "Though I fear not
[1:17:47] God, nor regard man, yet because this
[1:17:48] widow troubles me, I will avenge her,
[1:17:50] lest by coming away she weary me." And
[1:17:52] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[1:17:54] judge says. Shall not God avenge his
[1:17:57] elect which crith unto him day and
[1:17:58] night, though he bear along with them?
[1:18:01] But I tell you that he will avenge them
[1:18:03] speedily." Now in this word avenge in
[1:18:06] the Greek it comes from the Greek word
[1:18:08] eddicil which means to vindicate. So
[1:18:12] here this is the question I want you to
[1:18:14] notice what's taking place in this
[1:18:15] parable. The question is shall not God
[1:18:18] vindicate his elect. Other words he's
[1:18:20] talking about bringing a vindication
[1:18:22] which crith unto him day and night
[1:18:24] though they bear along with him. He said
[1:18:26] but I tell you now watch what Jesus
[1:18:28] says. I tell you that he will avenge or
[1:18:30] we can say vindicate. He he will
[1:18:31] vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless,
[1:18:34] when the Son of Man cometh, shall he
[1:18:35] find faith on the earth? Now, isn't that
[1:18:37] an odd connection that Jesus makes? He
[1:18:39] said, he will vindicate them speedily,
[1:18:42] but will I find faith on the earth?
[1:18:45] Isn't that an odd odd odd odd way to
[1:18:47] turn this, but I love how the prophet of
[1:18:49] God takes this scripture because as he
[1:18:51] reads this scripture, he says, see, it's
[1:18:53] a promise of indication, but then it's
[1:18:55] followed with a question of will I find
[1:18:57] faith. So, Jesus lays this parable said,
[1:18:59] now here's the question. Will I find
[1:19:01] faith? He said, in other words, the
[1:19:03] question he was asking is, will Malachi
[1:19:05] 4 be fulfilled at this time? Will he
[1:19:08] restore the faith of the children back
[1:19:10] to the faith of the fathers, that
[1:19:11] original word? So here he's showing us
[1:19:13] that the vindication of God's word being
[1:19:16] true is what brings a restored faith. So
[1:19:19] in the time, if you want to see, he said
[1:19:21] he will vindicate them. He will bring
[1:19:23] vindication. And then Jesus said, but
[1:19:25] will will Malachi 4 be fulfilled during
[1:19:27] this time? So in other words, in order
[1:19:29] for vindication to come, there had to
[1:19:31] come Malachi 4 before there could ever
[1:19:33] come vindication. That's what brought
[1:19:35] vindication. So see, so when he comes,
[1:19:37] he said, will he find Malachi 4
[1:19:39] fulfilled by? I don't know about y'all,
[1:19:41] but that just does something to me to
[1:19:42] think that God said, I will vindicate
[1:19:44] them. And how's he going to do it? He'll
[1:19:46] do it by sending Malachi 4, the to
[1:19:48] vindicate the very message of the hour
[1:19:50] that would be vindicated by God. That
[1:19:52] would vindicate the bride of Jesus
[1:19:54] Christ that you don't have to wonder
[1:19:56] about what you believe. You don't have
[1:19:57] to you don't have to hide from what you
[1:19:59] believe. Said because at the time of
[1:20:01] vindication, hear the message of Elijah.
[1:20:04] The spirit of Elijah will come forth and
[1:20:06] vindicate the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:08] Vindicate who the sons and daughters of
[1:20:10] God are. Who's the son of God? You'll be
[1:20:12] vindicated of being a son. He said,
[1:20:14] "Will I will Malachi 4 be fulfilled?" In
[1:20:17] other words, he'll will he find a
[1:20:19] message that has gone forth. Will I find
[1:20:21] a believer that has believed him? Will I
[1:20:23] find a faith that has been restored? Not
[1:20:26] a knowledge of the word, not a power.
[1:20:28] Not all men desire power. All these
[1:20:31] things, you know, but but that ain't
[1:20:33] what we're looking for. Says, see, we
[1:20:35] got the best doctors we've ever had. You
[1:20:36] think of the condition of this world.
[1:20:38] We've got the best hospitals we've ever
[1:20:39] had. We've got the best drugs that's
[1:20:41] ever been practiced with, but we've got
[1:20:43] more sickness than we've ever had. You
[1:20:46] know why? Because we got the worst pull
[1:20:48] pits that we've ever had. We've got the
[1:20:51] weakest pull pits and the weakest
[1:20:52] churches that we've ever had. They may
[1:20:54] be the best churches, the best educated
[1:20:56] men, but we got the weakest churches
[1:20:57] we've ever had. There's more sin than
[1:20:59] the world's ever known. You say, "Well,
[1:21:01] what is sin?" It's unbelief. For the
[1:21:02] Bible said, "He that believeth not is
[1:21:04] condemned already." That's what sin is.
[1:21:06] He said, "That's right. It ain't smoking
[1:21:07] and drinking." That's an attribute of
[1:21:08] unbelief. But you're a sinner because
[1:21:10] you don't believe. So when Jesus asked
[1:21:12] this question, he said, "When I come to
[1:21:14] the earth," he didn't say, "Will I find
[1:21:16] churches? Will I find sincerity? Will I
[1:21:18] find teachers? Will I find them
[1:21:20] preaching the Bible? Will I find power?
[1:21:22] Will I find people that are dedicated?
[1:21:24] Will I find them doing this? But Jesus
[1:21:26] said, "Will I find faith?" He said,
[1:21:29] "You've got power, but what we need is
[1:21:31] faith to positionally know where we are
[1:21:33] in Christ and then yield oursel to know
[1:21:36] your position as a son and not a
[1:21:39] servant. Amen. To yield yourself to the
[1:21:42] tutor, which is the Holy Ghost. To yield
[1:21:45] yourself to his will, to know your
[1:21:47] position in Christ. This is what he's
[1:21:49] looking for. Will I find faith? Will I
[1:21:52] find Malachi 4 being fulfilled? Because
[1:21:54] that's what's going to bring faith. Will
[1:21:56] I find faith? Will I find somebody that
[1:21:58] believes it? Will I find somebody that's
[1:22:00] still standing on the message of the
[1:22:02] hour that that God would come? Will I
[1:22:04] will I find some sons and daughters of
[1:22:06] God that have been adopted sons that
[1:22:08] know where they came from and they know
[1:22:10] their position in the father and they
[1:22:12] heard the call of God in this hour and
[1:22:14] they're standing and believe in the word
[1:22:16] of God.
[1:22:18] See, we have a heavenly father. Yes,
[1:22:20] sir. You said what? He's always been our
[1:22:23] father. But what he wanted to do, he
[1:22:26] loved fatherhood for he was a father.
[1:22:29] Y'all excuse
[1:22:31] me, but the only way that he could
[1:22:33] express it was to become a son, a
[1:22:36] man said, that's the reason that Jesus
[1:22:39] kept saying the son of man. See, they
[1:22:41] didn't know what he was talking about.
[1:22:43] But now we get it. So, see, he wanted to
[1:22:46] express himself. That was one of his
[1:22:48] great three-fold purposes was to express
[1:22:51] himself or identify himself with human
[1:22:53] beings, to reveal himself in Christ.
[1:22:56] That's right. See, he was a father. He
[1:22:58] wanted to express himself as a father.
[1:23:00] You see, but just like he done with
[1:23:02] Christ, that same father, think about
[1:23:04] it. When he when he sent his son, what
[1:23:06] was his son? His son was the word made
[1:23:09] flesh. The Bible says in the beginning
[1:23:11] was God. The word was with God. The word
[1:23:14] was God. In the beginning, it was the
[1:23:17] word. The word was God. And then that
[1:23:19] word became flesh, which was the man
[1:23:21] Jesus Christ. So we see that when the
[1:23:24] father would send his son, in other
[1:23:25] words, it was his word made flesh. Paul
[1:23:28] would call him when he would speak of
[1:23:30] Jesus, he would say that that he was the
[1:23:32] image of an invisible God. He was the
[1:23:35] word made flesh and he dwelt among us.
[1:23:37] And here when he would come to the
[1:23:39] earth, you realize that he came in a way
[1:23:42] that the world could not receive him.
[1:23:43] The Bible says that he came as a babe
[1:23:45] that was wrapped in swaddling clothes.
[1:23:48] Isn't this something? The word made
[1:23:49] flesh would come as a babe. were talking
[1:23:52] about a b a word being born. He said,
[1:23:54] "See, when they looked at the Messiah,
[1:23:56] they looked for him to be wrapped in
[1:23:58] something else. That's why they couldn't
[1:23:59] receive him because he was wrapped in
[1:24:01] the wrong thing. He was wrapped in a
[1:24:02] swaddling cloth. He was he was wrapped
[1:24:04] as a baby." And there therefore, even
[1:24:06] though it was the word itself and God
[1:24:08] had promised to send it, but but and he
[1:24:11] promised he would send it in the very
[1:24:12] swaddling cloth that it came in, but but
[1:24:14] the different but it was different than
[1:24:16] the swaddling cloth that they had
[1:24:17] expected it to be in. He said, "And it's
[1:24:20] the same way it is today." Think of it.
[1:24:22] It's the same thing today. If you can
[1:24:24] look, let me say it like this. If you
[1:24:25] can look at this message and not see
[1:24:27] Christ, then you're looking for the word
[1:24:29] to be wrapped in a different swaddling
[1:24:31] cloth. If you can look into this and
[1:24:33] say, "I don't see Christ in that." Well,
[1:24:35] it's because you're looking for Christ
[1:24:37] to be wrapped in some other blanket.
[1:24:38] You're looking for him to be wrapped in
[1:24:40] some other way. He says, "See, so, so
[1:24:42] you're looking for a different
[1:24:43] wrapping." But do you realize that the
[1:24:45] word of God whenever it would come, it
[1:24:47] wasn't to be wrapped in the swaddling of
[1:24:49] denominationalism. It it wasn't to be
[1:24:51] wrapped in the swaddling of
[1:24:53] intellectualism. It wasn't to be wrapped
[1:24:55] in the swaddling of of men's thinking
[1:24:57] and people's thoughts. But brother Bam
[1:24:59] said it was to be swaddled in the power
[1:25:01] and the resurrection and the
[1:25:02] manifestation of a risen Christ. So when
[1:25:05] the word of God came, it had to come in
[1:25:08] power. It was wrapped in the power of
[1:25:10] his resurrection. You say, "What did it
[1:25:12] do?" It brought a vindication of what it
[1:25:14] was. It It vindicated to the world that
[1:25:17] it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:25:19] today, and forever. It was the word of
[1:25:22] God wrapped in the swallowing of the
[1:25:24] power of his resurrection. And that
[1:25:26] word, oh my, don't you realize that it
[1:25:28] was born into this world. Even though it
[1:25:30] was an infant whenever it was born, but
[1:25:32] it was in the power of his resurrection,
[1:25:34] there was supernatural that surrounded
[1:25:36] it. Even a gift at a young age, it has
[1:25:39] supernatural that's surrounding it. Even
[1:25:41] when a prophet was born, there was a
[1:25:43] there was a light that appeared over his
[1:25:45] over his birth right in the house that
[1:25:47] his mom would testify that came. What
[1:25:49] was it? It was the supernatural that was
[1:25:51] swaddling a word being born. Oh, don't
[1:25:54] you realize that's what's taking place.
[1:25:55] The same thing I I know people are to
[1:25:57] doubt. I I know people don't believe it,
[1:25:59] but I'm going to preach it anyway. I I I
[1:26:01] can't help what people believe, but I
[1:26:02] know what the Bible says. I I know that
[1:26:05] that that that there ain't never been
[1:26:06] the word born that it wasn't surrounded
[1:26:08] by the supernatural.
[1:26:10] That's I know the churches are trying to
[1:26:12] do away with it. They try to get rid of
[1:26:14] a supernatural birth and a new birth and
[1:26:16] you can just recite some poem or or
[1:26:18] something. They may as well call it
[1:26:19] that. They recite some scripture that
[1:26:21] just became a poem, but recite some
[1:26:23] scripture and it'll give you salvation,
[1:26:25] but that ain't never going to do it. It
[1:26:27] takes a supernatural birth of the word
[1:26:30] of God. The word must be born. Oh, don't
[1:26:32] you realize that's what that's where
[1:26:34] Mary made her mistake whenever she
[1:26:36] denied a supernatural birth. You
[1:26:38] remember when Jesus was down there, they
[1:26:40] went to the feast that day and after
[1:26:42] they had been at the feast for eight for
[1:26:43] eight days? When when they they went
[1:26:45] back and realized that Jesus wasn't with
[1:26:47] them and here he was a 12-year-old boy
[1:26:49] and Mary and Joseph went back into
[1:26:51] Jerusalem. They searched for him for
[1:26:53] three days. They looked day and night
[1:26:54] and finally they found him in the
[1:26:56] temple. And here he was speaking in
[1:26:58] front of the priest and and he was
[1:26:59] confounding them with the wisdom of God.
[1:27:02] And the Bible says, "But Mary, whenever
[1:27:04] she saw him, she said, "Why have you put
[1:27:06] this on us? Where have you been? You've
[1:27:08] troubled your father and I. We've been
[1:27:10] looking for you. Do you realize what she
[1:27:12] did when she made that statement,
[1:27:14] Brother Wesley? She denied his
[1:27:15] supernatural birth. She said, "You've
[1:27:17] troubled your father and I." Speaking of
[1:27:19] her and Joseph, right in the middle of
[1:27:21] the theologians, in the middle of the
[1:27:23] Pharisees here, this mother that was
[1:27:25] supposed to be a spiritual lady here
[1:27:28] that she would say, "You've troubled
[1:27:29] your father and I." But let me tell you
[1:27:30] what the word does. The word always
[1:27:32] corrects the church. And he looked right
[1:27:34] back at her. He said, "How can I have
[1:27:36] troubled you for I must be about my
[1:27:39] father's business." He wouldn't allow
[1:27:41] her to leave even leave that in some
[1:27:44] place that he was just some man or that
[1:27:46] he was just something natural. He said,
[1:27:48] "But I must be about my father's
[1:27:50] business."
[1:27:52] See, that's what the church has done is
[1:27:54] to take a supernatural birth of the word
[1:27:56] of God out of the heart of the believer.
[1:27:58] They've taken it out of the church and
[1:27:59] replaced it. If they can get you to
[1:28:00] babble and speak in tongues, well, then
[1:28:02] you receive the Holy Ghost. If you go to
[1:28:04] church enough times, well then you can
[1:28:05] receive the Holy Ghost. But friends, it
[1:28:07] takes a supernatural birth of the word
[1:28:10] of God.
[1:28:12] He said, "See, the word always corrects
[1:28:14] the church." Said, "I must be about my
[1:28:16] man, that makes me want to preach." He
[1:28:19] said, "I must be about my father's
[1:28:21] business." In other words, I appreciate
[1:28:24] the church and what they've done. They
[1:28:26] brought us that far. He said, "There
[1:28:27] comes a time that you're no longer a
[1:28:29] servant, but a son. There comes a time
[1:28:31] I'm no longer the tutor under the tutor,
[1:28:34] but I've been brought into the place of
[1:28:35] sunship or or the adoption of sons. We
[1:28:39] were living under denominations for many
[1:28:41] many years. And brother Tom, it had its
[1:28:43] purpose. It was a carrier of the word.
[1:28:45] But whenever the word was birthed, it
[1:28:47] was birthed by a supernatural birth that
[1:28:50] we would come out of being servants into
[1:28:53] being sons. My isn't that good? That's
[1:28:56] just powerful scripture. Amen. So, see,
[1:29:00] it's God's word being
[1:29:02] vindicated in this hour. The vindication
[1:29:05] is what brings the children uh uh the
[1:29:08] children's faith back to their fathers.
[1:29:10] Think of this is what Paul's preaching.
[1:29:12] He said in Galatians 4, he was speaking
[1:29:14] of a son being elevated to the position
[1:29:16] of a son and not a servant. So, in other
[1:29:18] words, the son can now be about the
[1:29:22] father's business. This is what Paul is
[1:29:24] trying to get the church to. See, if
[1:29:26] your father was a farmer to be about the
[1:29:29] father's business, then you grow up and
[1:29:30] learn how to be a farmer. You'd learn
[1:29:31] how to put crops, learn how to plant and
[1:29:34] harvest. And if your far father was a
[1:29:36] banker, you'd learn how to add and
[1:29:38] subtract, hopefully add, but you you'd
[1:29:41] learn all those things because that's
[1:29:43] that's your father's business. You'd
[1:29:44] learn the trade of your father that you
[1:29:47] could be about his business. If your
[1:29:49] father was a a salesman, you'd learn the
[1:29:51] trade of your father that you could take
[1:29:53] over the father's business. you could
[1:29:55] come into this place of sunship. The
[1:29:56] place of sunship was not to be a
[1:29:58] servant. Are you hearing me? I want you
[1:29:59] to catch it. The place of sunship is not
[1:30:02] to no longer be a servant. It's to be a
[1:30:04] son. And to be a son, an adopted son, is
[1:30:07] not to be under the foot of the father.
[1:30:08] That's not it was his purpose. He see
[1:30:11] they were the body. He was the head. But
[1:30:13] but but it was so that he could work
[1:30:15] through them. It wasn't that he could
[1:30:16] put his foot on them and stomp on them
[1:30:18] and beat them down and and and rule over
[1:30:20] them. It wasn't like that. It was that
[1:30:22] the son would have a place of rulership.
[1:30:24] Paul said, "Though he be the ruler of
[1:30:26] all." Yet he's a servant until he comes
[1:30:28] to the place of adoption. So here the
[1:30:31] purpose of God is so that you can come
[1:30:33] to this place of adoption to be about
[1:30:35] the father's business. You say, "Well,
[1:30:37] what is the father's business today?" He
[1:30:39] says, "See, well, our father, he wasn't
[1:30:41] doing those things. He wasn't a banker.
[1:30:42] He wasn't a logger. He wasn't a he
[1:30:44] wasn't a salesman. But our father's
[1:30:46] business is vindicating his word." Amen.
[1:30:49] But said, see, that's his business. So,
[1:30:51] if we're going to be about the father's
[1:30:53] business, well, I can say this, but
[1:30:55] David, our his business has become your
[1:30:57] business. Hello, somebody. His business
[1:31:00] has become your business. It's become,
[1:31:03] in other words, it's our business to
[1:31:04] preach that God is still a God of
[1:31:06] miracles. It's our business to preach
[1:31:08] that God still heals the sick. It's our
[1:31:11] business to stand and say that he still
[1:31:13] cleanses the leper. It's my business to
[1:31:15] say he delivers people from drugs and
[1:31:17] alcohol. It's our business to be about
[1:31:19] the father's business. It's our business
[1:31:21] to say that it takes a supernatural
[1:31:23] birth of the word in you. That that's
[1:31:25] what changes you and not to deny the
[1:31:28] power of God. It's our business because
[1:31:30] we must be about the father's business.
[1:31:33] It's our business to fulfill. You'd
[1:31:35] think, well, what was what was the what
[1:31:37] was the Jesus when he came? He said, I
[1:31:39] must be about the father's business. You
[1:31:41] notice what he said? He said to fulfill
[1:31:42] the scriptures that pertainth to him.
[1:31:45] That was his business. So when Isaiah
[1:31:47] said, "A virgin shall conceive," Jesus
[1:31:49] had to fulfill it because that was his
[1:31:50] business to fulfill it. The Bible said,
[1:31:52] "The lame should leap like a heart, the
[1:31:54] blind would see, the dumb would speak."
[1:31:56] These were the the the the the words
[1:31:58] that was spoke about his life. So it was
[1:32:00] his business to fulfill that as a son to
[1:32:04] fulfill the prophecy that pertainth to
[1:32:06] him. It was his business to fulfill it.
[1:32:08] That's why Moses said, "The Lord your
[1:32:10] God should raise up a prophet among you
[1:32:12] like unto me." He said it was the
[1:32:14] father's business to fulfill the word
[1:32:16] that was spoken of him. He said, "So if
[1:32:18] that's the father's business for Christ
[1:32:20] to fulfill the word, then what do you
[1:32:22] think your business is now?" Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ, the Bible said, he's the same
[1:32:26] yesterday, today, and forever. And a
[1:32:28] spirit has come upon the bride to do the
[1:32:31] same things that he has done.
[1:32:33] Hallelujah. A spirit has come upon the
[1:32:35] bride. You say, "What spirit is it?"
[1:32:37] It's the spirit of adoption that has
[1:32:39] come upon the bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:32:41] bring her to a place of sunship to do
[1:32:44] the same things that he's done. Oh
[1:32:46] friends, isn't it something? You know,
[1:32:47] as a as a as even as a young boy, he
[1:32:50] would say he as a young man, he said,
[1:32:52] "But I must be about my father's
[1:32:53] business." He said, "Oh, think about it.
[1:32:55] If he was at 12 years old saying, I must
[1:32:57] be about the father's business." Then
[1:32:59] what about the church today in its stage
[1:33:01] of maturity? How much more ought we say
[1:33:04] we must be about our father's business?
[1:33:06] Amen. He said that's the secret of the
[1:33:08] message now is the father's business. We
[1:33:11] must be about it. He said the bride is
[1:33:13] to fulfill what the word said about her.
[1:33:15] Yes, sir. We must do it. So if he said
[1:33:17] Malachi 4 would come and and behold, I
[1:33:20] would send you Elijah the prophet and
[1:33:22] somebody's going to believe it. Well,
[1:33:23] then guess what the bride's going to do?
[1:33:25] She's going to be about the father's
[1:33:26] business. So when she hears the word
[1:33:28] that pertainth to her, she's going to
[1:33:30] step right into it. when she hears Luke
[1:33:32] 17:30 and how it'll be when the son of
[1:33:34] man is revealed. You know what the bride
[1:33:36] will do? She'll step right over into it.
[1:33:38] Why? Because she's a son and daughter of
[1:33:40] God. And it's she's about the father's
[1:33:42] business. When she hears the scripture
[1:33:45] that is pertaining to her and she'll
[1:33:47] step into it because we're about the
[1:33:49] father. Yeah. I know how people say, "I
[1:33:51] can't hardly believe believe that
[1:33:53] stuff." But you know what? It's I you
[1:33:56] know how how the spirit of one man can
[1:33:57] be upon another. But it's because it's
[1:33:59] the spirit of God. And the spirit of God
[1:34:01] in one man can be the same spirit of God
[1:34:03] in another. But we must be about the
[1:34:05] father's business. He says, "See, if you
[1:34:07] love, if you love, if you believe the
[1:34:09] word to be the word of God, before
[1:34:11] judgment could come, there would have to
[1:34:13] come an Elijah." He said, "Well, how can
[1:34:15] Elijah come?" Well, it's not Elijah the
[1:34:17] man. It was the spirit that was on
[1:34:18] Elijah. It was the spirit of God that
[1:34:20] was upon Elijah. I I never thought that
[1:34:22] was the spirit of Elijah as far as a
[1:34:24] man. I don't think Elijah had the
[1:34:26] ability to part. People give too much
[1:34:28] credit to a man. I It's funny to me that
[1:34:31] people think a man done that. A man
[1:34:33] didn't part the waters of Jordan and
[1:34:34] walk across it. It was the spirit of God
[1:34:36] upon Elijah. I I It's just funny. People
[1:34:38] are such man followers. The Elijah
[1:34:40] Elijah didn't do it. Moses didn't do it.
[1:34:42] It was God in Moses. It was God in
[1:34:44] Elijah. It was God in brother. It's God
[1:34:45] in you. It was God in Jesus. It was the
[1:34:48] spirit of God. It's always the spirit of
[1:34:50] Christ in the church that does the work.
[1:34:52] That's what we're following after. So,
[1:34:54] we're about the father's business to
[1:34:57] vindicate what the prophets have written
[1:34:58] about us. So, we vindicate Hebrews 13:8.
[1:35:02] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:35:04] today, and forever. We vindicate. We
[1:35:06] vindicate John 14:12, "The works that I
[1:35:09] do shall you do also." He said, "It's
[1:35:11] his business to vindicate, and it's our
[1:35:13] business to do his business." To
[1:35:16] vindicate all of his word to vindicate
[1:35:18] Revelation the 10th chapter, the opening
[1:35:20] of the seals, the mysteries of God.
[1:35:21] That's the father's business. And it has
[1:35:23] become our business.
[1:35:26] Ain't that what your mama used to tell
[1:35:27] you? I'm closing. Musicians can come.
[1:35:30] You remember what your mama used to tell
[1:35:32] you, brother Kyle? Mind your own
[1:35:34] business. And my mom used to tell me
[1:35:35] that a lot. I don't know if your mama
[1:35:36] said it, but that was one of my mom's
[1:35:37] favorite words. I don't know why. I just
[1:35:41] But but she used that a lot. Mind your
[1:35:42] business. But you know where that
[1:35:44] actually come out of the Bible. That
[1:35:45] come out from Apostle Paul. First
[1:35:47] Thessalonians. He said, "Study to be
[1:35:49] quiet. Mind your own business. work with
[1:35:50] your own hands that you don't lack of
[1:35:52] nothing. Come right out of the Bible. So
[1:35:55] do your own business. Mind your own. You
[1:35:56] know what? And that's what's happened
[1:35:58] today. Is that the way that's the way it
[1:36:00] feels sometimes because these great
[1:36:01] churches and these great systems has
[1:36:03] been built up. Great theologians that
[1:36:05] look down on you and that's the way they
[1:36:07] look at you. Mind your own business.
[1:36:09] Mind your own business. You don't you
[1:36:11] haven't been to theology school. You
[1:36:13] hadn't been to no seminary. So mind your
[1:36:15] own business. But me tell you a secret.
[1:36:18] This is our business.
[1:36:20] I don't have to have that to for that to
[1:36:22] be my business. It is my business. You
[1:36:25] say, "How is it?" He said, "See, because
[1:36:27] we're no longer servants, but we're
[1:36:28] sons." And the father's business has
[1:36:31] become our business to see God's message
[1:36:33] vindicated in every life
[1:36:36] to fulfill the desire of the father. Do
[1:36:38] you realize that's his business? So,
[1:36:40] what's his desire? His desire, the Bible
[1:36:42] says, is for all to be saved and come to
[1:36:44] the knowledge of the truth. His desire
[1:36:46] is for you to receive spiritual
[1:36:48] blessings. Won't you stand to your feet
[1:36:50] this morning? His desire is for you to
[1:36:52] receive your inheritance. His desire is
[1:36:55] for you to be filled with joy. Do you
[1:36:57] realize that that the desires of God for
[1:37:01] your life was not for God's benefit?
[1:37:04] Listen to this. But the desire of God
[1:37:08] for your life was for your own benefit,
[1:37:10] but for God's glory. So he desired for
[1:37:13] you to have joy not for God's benefit.
[1:37:15] He desires you to have joy for your
[1:37:16] benefit. He desired you to be free, not
[1:37:19] for his benefit, but your benefit. He
[1:37:21] desired you to be about his the father's
[1:37:24] business, not his benefit, but your
[1:37:26] benefit. That you could receive all that
[1:37:29] belong to you. See, that's God's desire
[1:37:33] for you to receive the benefits of God
[1:37:35] and him to receive the glory
[1:37:38] forgiven. Oh my, think about it. It's
[1:37:42] God's
[1:37:43] desire to fulfill all the word
[1:37:46] pertaining to you. Amen. I don't know
[1:37:48] about you, but I don't just want to
[1:37:49] fulfill all of it or part of it. I want
[1:37:51] to fulfill it all. There's something
[1:37:54] that came in the heart of every believer
[1:37:55] that brought joy to them. I want to
[1:37:57] fulfill that. We're not a We're not a
[1:37:59] bunch of bunch of getting by a bunch of
[1:38:02] people that barely come to church. We're
[1:38:05] the children of God. You're the sons and
[1:38:07] daughters of God. It brings great joy to
[1:38:09] your heart. How many believe that? Say
[1:38:10] amen. How many say, "I'm a daughter of
[1:38:12] God." Lift your hand. How many say, "I'm
[1:38:13] a son of God." Raise your hand. And
[1:38:16] you've been called to a place of
[1:38:17] adoption by the message of the hour that
[1:38:19] you wouldn't remain in servantthood, but
[1:38:21] you would be brought to sunship that you
[1:38:23] would have power over this life. And he
[1:38:26] gave you an earnest of that adoption
[1:38:28] called the Holy Ghost. That you would
[1:38:30] have power over this flesh. It ain't
[1:38:32] something that you had to work up,
[1:38:33] Brother David. It was something that God
[1:38:34] put in you because you belong to God in
[1:38:36] the beginning. It makes me want to run
[1:38:37] around this building because you belong
[1:38:39] to God in the build in this in the very
[1:38:42] beginning and he predestinated to you to
[1:38:44] this very moment this appointed time
[1:38:47] that he could bring you to this place of
[1:38:49] adoption.
[1:38:50] You know what happened to the disciples
[1:38:52] whenever they saw this? When they were
[1:38:54] coming to their position the Bible says
[1:38:56] he ascended to his you know it's what
[1:38:58] Jesus said he said if I be lifted up
[1:39:00] I'll draw all men unto me. In other
[1:39:02] words if he's in his position he can
[1:39:03] bring all of us into ours. And you know
[1:39:05] what they've done? Bible said whenever
[1:39:07] he ascended, then they they went and
[1:39:09] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[1:39:11] with great joy. And they were
[1:39:13] continually in the temple praising and
[1:39:15] blessing God. You know why? They were
[1:39:17] fulfilling what the scripture said about
[1:39:19] them. They were fulfilling the will of
[1:39:22] the father. Isn't that what Jesus said?
[1:39:24] He said, "Our Father, who art in heaven,
[1:39:26] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[1:39:28] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:39:31] heaven." But let me ask you this. If
[1:39:33] it's going to be done on earth as it was
[1:39:35] in heaven, then what were the sons of
[1:39:37] God doing in heaven? What was the will
[1:39:39] of God when they were in heaven? I know
[1:39:40] what he told Job. He said, "Where were
[1:39:42] you when the sons of God were shouting
[1:39:44] for joy?" There was jubilee amongst the
[1:39:46] church of the living God. There was joy
[1:39:48] among the sons of God. There was
[1:39:50] shouting and praising God. That was the
[1:39:52] will of God in heaven. And that's the
[1:39:54] will of God on earth is the sons of God
[1:39:56] to be free to worship God. Free to
[1:39:59] praise God. Free to have joy in their
[1:40:01] heart. Not to be bound up by religion,
[1:40:04] but to be freed by the word of God, by
[1:40:07] the message of the hour. My you're sons
[1:40:09] and daughters of God. Don't let that
[1:40:10] confusion, that spirit of you know why
[1:40:12] it's moving around the church. It's
[1:40:14] trying or the churches because it's
[1:40:16] trying to take you out of your position
[1:40:17] as a son and daughter. I don't know if
[1:40:20] this is right or this is true, but it's
[1:40:22] trying to take you out of your position.
[1:40:23] But let me tell you what you do. You
[1:40:24] boldly walk right back up into your
[1:40:26] place and you say, "I'm a son and
[1:40:28] daughter of God. I was bought by the
[1:40:30] blood of Jesus Christ. God sent a
[1:40:32] message that called me out of this
[1:40:33] world. It called me out of sin. It
[1:40:36] called me out of unbelief. It called me
[1:40:37] out of doubt. It called me out of
[1:40:39] criticism. It took the desires of this
[1:40:41] world and this flesh out of my life and
[1:40:43] caused me to want to serve God. And I
[1:40:46] believe it with all my heart. and you
[1:40:48] stand as a son and not a servant. My
[1:40:52] imagine how proud the tutor must have
[1:40:53] been. When he looked at the son, stand
[1:40:56] in his position and say, "Man, I've done
[1:40:59] a good job." There he stands. He's able
[1:41:02] to handle things and trials and troubles
[1:41:04] and tribulations and persecutions that
[1:41:06] come. He's able to deal with the
[1:41:08] problems. I've done a good job. I
[1:41:12] imagine he's proud when he looks out at
[1:41:15] us. Can you imagine? You ever think of
[1:41:18] that? That God's proud of you. He's
[1:41:21] proud of of what you've become and how
[1:41:24] that you've grown to this place. Oh, I I
[1:41:28] think God shows us off. That's what he
[1:41:30] done with Job. Remember when Satan come
[1:41:32] around, he said, "Have you considered my
[1:41:33] servant?" I think God shows us off. You
[1:41:36] know, like you go to somebody's big
[1:41:38] house, some of them rich folks, you go
[1:41:40] in there, they want to show you all
[1:41:41] around their house and stuff, all their
[1:41:43] rooms and stuff. Y'all all the all their
[1:41:47] rooms and stuff. They got to show you
[1:41:49] through through all the passageways and
[1:41:51] show you all the all all the things that
[1:41:53] they build. Y'all ain't right. Messed up
[1:41:56] my
[1:41:57] thought. God help
[1:41:59] me. But that's the way our God is.
[1:42:02] That's the way God is. I I think he
[1:42:04] wants to show us off. He wants to show
[1:42:07] us off. And when you come into God's
[1:42:09] house, can you imagine you come by to
[1:42:11] visit, you take somebody say, "Well,
[1:42:12] come back here. Let me show you what I
[1:42:14] got on this shelf. And over there on the
[1:42:16] shelf here, here's a Joe Bourne Trager.
[1:42:18] Well, what who's that? Well, that boy,
[1:42:20] he used he he he used to be bound up
[1:42:22] with all sorts of things, and the devil
[1:42:23] thought he had him, but I delivered him,
[1:42:26] and now he stands here as a trophy in my
[1:42:27] house. He God has showed us all. He
[1:42:30] looks back there at Brother Ed. Said,
[1:42:32] "For many years, it looked like he was
[1:42:34] gone. Looked like he gave up. Looked
[1:42:35] like there was no hope for him. But you
[1:42:37] know what he does when he brings him
[1:42:38] into his house? He comes all the way to
[1:42:40] brother Ed is. He say, "Look at brother
[1:42:41] Ed. Look how far he's came. Look at what
[1:42:45] God's done in his life. Look how he
[1:42:47] stands as a trophy of the grace of God.
[1:42:49] Look at this one for 35 years that he
[1:42:51] wouldn't serve God. 35 years he wouldn't
[1:42:54] even come into a church. But he stands
[1:42:56] there as a trophy of God's grace. This
[1:42:58] one was about to be gone with drugs and
[1:43:00] alcohol. He looked like all hope was
[1:43:02] lost. But God was 10 and say, "But look
[1:43:04] at him. He's a trophy. Amen. He's proud
[1:43:07] of you
[1:43:09] to display his trophies. He's proud of
[1:43:13] you. Oh, the place that you've came to.
[1:43:17] He's fell on his face. He's got back up.
[1:43:19] She's wanted to quit a hundred times.
[1:43:21] She's made the promise, I'll never go
[1:43:23] back to church again. I'm just going to
[1:43:24] give up. But something kept calling you
[1:43:26] to take another step and get up another
[1:43:28] day. What is it? You've been trained.
[1:43:31] There's a tutor that's lifting you and
[1:43:33] raising you and leading you. He said,
[1:43:35] "I'm proud of you. Look at what they've
[1:43:37] become. The sons and daughters of God."
[1:43:41] My isn't it wonderful to know God. Amen.
[1:43:45] Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:43:47] praise this
[1:43:49] morning? Amen. Isn't he
[1:43:52] wonderful? Can you be I
[1:43:54] think Well, what can I wash away my sin?
[1:44:01] Nothing but the blood of
[1:44:04] Jesus will walk can make me whole
[1:44:10] again. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:44:16] Oh, precious is the
[1:44:20] flow that makes me white as snow. No
[1:44:28] mother, I know nothing but the blood of
[1:44:37] Jesus. This I see nothing but the blood
[1:44:42] of Jesus.
[1:44:46] Oh my calling is my plea. Nothing but
[1:44:51] the blood of

[1:45:23] Jesus. Well, now by this I'll reach my
[1:45:28] home. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:45:34] Oh, how
[1:45:35] precious is the flow that makes me white

[1:46:38] white as snow. No other found. I know
[1:46:46] nothing but the blood of
[1:46:52] Jesus. How many knows that blood this
[1:46:56] morning? Amen. How many's free? Free

[1:47:05] to entertain the Lord Jesus Christ this

[1:47:10] morning?

[1:47:13] praise.

[1:49:59] of us.
[1:50:01] Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:50:03] Even when he looked down upon his son,
[1:50:05] he said, "This is my son who I'm well
[1:50:07] pleased to dwell in." He was excited.
[1:50:11] How much more is he in the evening time
[1:50:13] when the heads came over the body, he's
[1:50:15] looking down in this thing, this is my
[1:50:17] son whom I'm well pleased to dwell in.

[1:50:22] praise this

[1:50:27] morning. Well, a long time I
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:35] travel. We'll get it. For a long time I
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:40] travel down a long lonely
[1:50:45] road. My heart was so heavy. said I
[1:50:51] saw that I heard about
[1:50:56] Jesus. What a wonderful
[1:51:00] hour. Well, I'm so glad that I found out
[1:51:04] he could bring me out through his saving
[1:51:10] power. Thank God I am free,
[1:51:14] free from this world of sin.
[1:51:20] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.

[1:51:27] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved.
[1:51:34] Saved. Are you thankful
[1:51:36] now? I'm so glad that I found out he
[1:51:40] could bring me out. Show me the way.
[1:51:46] Like a bird out of
[1:51:50] prison that has taken his
[1:51:55] flight. Like a blind man that God gave
[1:51:59] back his
[1:52:01] side. Like a poor wretched
[1:52:06] record. I found fortune and fame.
[1:52:12] I'm so glad that I found out he could

[1:52:20] name. Thank God I am

[1:53:04] this morning as a word penetrated our
[1:53:07] our ears down into our hearts, Lord.
[1:53:10] spiritual food in due season. Lord, we
[1:53:13] pray, Lord, that they'll allow the
[1:53:14] believers this morning to grow and get
[1:53:17] closer to you. Make another step, Lord,
[1:53:19] as we're growing toward that light
[1:53:21] that's been given in this hour to take
[1:53:23] us out of mortal into immortality, Lord.
[1:53:26] Thank you for the vindicated word. Thank
[1:53:28] you for a vindicated message, Lord.
[1:53:30] Lord, we thank you for the service this
[1:53:32] morning, Lord. We pray that you'll go

[1:53:37] that you'll bless our pastor, Lord.

[1:53:41] body in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:53:46] Hallelujah. Well, I've been
[1:53:48] changed. I've been reborn now all my

[1:54:10] been baptized. I've been washed in the
[1:54:14] blood of the
[1:54:16] lamb. Oh, I've been changed from the
[1:54:19] creature that I once was and redeemed is
[1:54:24] now my
[1:54:26] name. Oh, I've been changed.
[1:54:30] I've been reborn now. All my life has
