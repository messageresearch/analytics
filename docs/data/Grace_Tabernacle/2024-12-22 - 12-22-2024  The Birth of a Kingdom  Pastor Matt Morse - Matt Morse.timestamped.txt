[46:54] uh this is that uh time of year and
[46:57] certainly a time of remembrance for us
[46:59] as Believers but we just want to invite
[47:01] you to the book of Hebrews and we'll
[47:03] read out of the 11th chapter and uh and
[47:06] we'll start there in the eth verse and
[47:08] uh we'll just uh give you a moment to uh
[47:11] to find that that place Hebrews 11th
[47:14] chapter and the 8th verse we want to
[47:16] welcome our visitors here this morning
[47:18] trust something would be said that would
[47:21] be a blessing to you this morning and we
[47:25] certainly appreciate the uh the those
[47:28] that have been coming and just seems
[47:30] like you know somebody told me the other
[47:31] day this only church I ever been to that
[47:33] had a new congregation every week and I
[47:35] said well that's the signs of a growing
[47:37] Church there always always new faces and
[47:40] we just we just love to be an Outreach
[47:42] and uh to be a a light in this place and
[47:45] in this time and so I believe that God
[47:48] has given us the opportunity to be that
[47:50] all right so uh how many love the Lord
[47:52] amen you love his word amen let's read
[47:54] it together Hebrews 11th chapter and the
[47:56] 8 verse the Bible says by faith Abraham
[47:59] when he was called to go out into a
[48:01] place which he should after receive for
[48:03] an inheritance he obeyed and he went out
[48:05] that's that's quite a lesson right there
[48:07] isn't it when he was called To The Lord
[48:09] he obeyed and he went out not knowing
[48:11] whether he went but by faith he
[48:13] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[48:16] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[48:18] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[48:21] of the same promise for he looked for a
[48:23] city which hath foundations whose
[48:25] Builder and maker is God and I also want
[48:29] to read out of the book of Isaiah and
[48:31] I'll read from the seventh chapter in
[48:33] one verse of scripture very familiar
[48:35] especially this time of the year but out
[48:37] of the 14th verse the Bible says
[48:39] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[48:41] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[48:44] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[48:47] his name Emmanuel and I'd like to speak
[48:50] this morning as you take your seats on
[48:52] the birth of a kingdom uh here a few uh
[48:55] months ago we had been speaking on a
[48:58] kingdom series and this just kind of had
[49:00] came on my heart and uh and for this for
[49:04] this time to be able to minister it uh
[49:06] certainly in this time of year I I I I I
[49:09] I appreciate the uh you know this this
[49:12] time of the time of the birth of Jesus
[49:15] and the time of Christmas and uh you
[49:17] know I've always uh always thought
[49:19] there's it doesn't matter what time it
[49:21] is there's those that can do good with
[49:22] it and those that can do bad with it and
[49:25] uh I certainly appreciate it I believe
[49:26] that God has given us many great gifts
[49:28] and uh this is a time to be able to
[49:30] remember that and reflect on the things
[49:32] that God has done for us you know the
[49:34] Lord uh just kind of spoke something to
[49:36] my heart the other day and and we were
[49:39] brother DAV and sister Eve he was having
[49:41] his birthday and they invited us over to
[49:43] uh to have dinner uh there with them and
[49:46] and at the end of the at the end of the
[49:48] dinner we got up to leave and I said
[49:49] brother Dave I just want to wish you a
[49:51] happy birthday and and certainly I
[49:53] appreciate everything you do I love you
[49:55] and God bless you and he said well
[49:57] brother Matt I appreciate that thank you
[49:58] thank you for that and and uh started to
[50:00] walk out and sister Eve she said well
[50:02] you know today's not his birthday his
[50:04] birthday is not uh for another few days
[50:06] and I thought as I said well well that's
[50:08] that's wonderful and I thought as I was
[50:10] walking out I didn't say nothing to
[50:11] nobody I thought you know isn't it odd
[50:13] that today wasn't really his birthday
[50:15] but whenever I gave him praise he
[50:16] accepted it and when I told him I
[50:18] appreciated him he accepted it and and I
[50:20] told him how much he meant to me and he
[50:21] accepted I thought that's the way it is
[50:23] with our Lord we we may not know what
[50:25] day he was born on or what uh no man
[50:28] really knows the day we know we know it
[50:30] wasn't in the in the winter time of the
[50:32] year but whatever day that you choose to
[50:34] worship God and uh for the gift that God
[50:36] has given us God will accept the worship
[50:38] and he will accept the praise and and uh
[50:41] I think that's the way we ought to be
[50:42] this morning we ought to make uh uh uh
[50:45] something uh mean or get some mean
[50:47] Spirit towards people that want to
[50:48] Worship the Lord and but we ought to
[50:50] make it a time of worship amen and so
[50:52] that's what it means to us as a Believer
[50:54] you know what you know that I know
[50:56] people people get this all twisted up
[50:58] sometimes but uh you know what it means
[51:00] to be a light in the time of Darkness
[51:01] many men have taken that and and said
[51:03] well Darkness was Christmas but
[51:05] Christmas is never a time of Darkness
[51:07] but if there wasn't a Christmas we'd
[51:08] never have a resurrection if there
[51:09] wasn't a Christmas we'd never there had
[51:11] never been a crucifiction there would
[51:13] never be salvation so there had to come
[51:14] a Christmas and there you know there had
[51:17] to come that time and so uh Christmas
[51:19] was not the time of Darkness the time of
[51:21] Darkness was paganism surrounding this
[51:23] time of year and so uh it is our purpose
[51:26] purp to be a light in the time of
[51:28] Darkness isn't it something so if the
[51:30] world is going to make this a dark time
[51:31] this is when we should shine our light
[51:33] this is when you say well I'm going to
[51:34] wait till I'm going to wait until Easter
[51:36] and then I'm going to shine my light but
[51:37] in the time of Darkness let your light
[51:39] shine and uh let let the world know what
[51:42] it is all about amen we have uh we
[51:44] certainly have been given a great gift
[51:46] in this hour how many believe that amen
[51:48] we so we just want to keep a a good
[51:51] spirit about it I just think God is
[51:52] wonderful and but I want to take a
[51:55] moment this morning to speak on the
[51:56] birth of a kingdom and uh I I feel like
[51:59] there's such a wonderful connection here
[52:01] between these two scriptures and of
[52:03] course we know that through the Bible
[52:05] that Abraham and Isaiah that they lived
[52:07] over a thousand years uh apart from the
[52:10] time of their life but uh but we also
[52:12] can see that the prophecy of Isaiah he
[52:15] would actually carry on the purpose that
[52:17] Abraham had and you remember the story
[52:19] of Abraham each one of us have read it
[52:21] and preached on it many times but uh you
[52:23] remember as God had came to Abraham and
[52:25] he called him away from his family and
[52:27] his and his uh and and his people and he
[52:30] said go into a land that I will show you
[52:32] and the Bible would tell us in Hebrews
[52:33] the 11th chapter that that Abraham
[52:35] obeyed God and he began to go and and he
[52:38] traveled and he sojourned into a Strange
[52:40] Land and he went out into a place that
[52:42] he would receive for an inheritance and
[52:45] and as you would go to this place it
[52:46] would be to a strange country it was a
[52:48] place that Abraham knew nothing of but
[52:50] the Bible says but by faith he walked
[52:52] out and and by faith he he followed the
[52:55] Lord and he went to this place that God
[52:56] would call him to and and and his
[52:58] purpose is that he looked for a city
[53:00] that had foundations whose Builder and
[53:03] maker was God see Abraham was a special
[53:05] kind of a Believer he was the kind of
[53:07] believer that had faith that when God
[53:09] said something was out there even though
[53:11] that he couldn't see it that he believed
[53:12] that it was out there even though he may
[53:14] have not could have touched it but he
[53:16] believed it was out there he may uh he
[53:18] may have not none of his natural senses
[53:19] would be able to identify this city but
[53:21] the Bible says but he went by faith and
[53:23] here here we find him in the chapter of
[53:25] Hebrews in the chap that would depict
[53:27] The Heroes of Faith throughout the Bible
[53:29] and Abraham was was said to be one of
[53:31] the great Heroes of Faith because he
[53:33] believed God and he called things that
[53:36] as they were even though they were not
[53:37] to the natural eye and so Abraham being
[53:40] a man as he went out and he searched for
[53:42] this place that do you realize that
[53:44] Abraham that he searched for the very
[53:45] thing that we are looking for today that
[53:48] with his with that with his natural eye
[53:50] he went out searching for this thing for
[53:51] Jesus would say he said we are not of
[53:54] this world they are not of this world
[53:56] even even as I am not of this world so
[53:58] here we are in this world just like
[54:00] Abraham was in this world but brother
[54:02] Mark he separated himself from the
[54:04] things of the world and he walked into a
[54:06] strange country and he professed himself
[54:08] to be a pilgrim and a stranger he said I
[54:11] don't belong in this place I'm a pilgrim
[54:13] and a stranger I come from another place
[54:15] and I'm I'm looking for it this morning
[54:17] I I've started my journey i' I've made a
[54:19] connection with some other with some
[54:21] other Kingdom and I'm and I'm going out
[54:23] searching for it for the Bible said he
[54:25] was looking for a city he wandered
[54:27] through the deserts he went through the
[54:28] Wilderness he was looking for a city he
[54:30] was watching for it day and night and
[54:32] brother bam said that we today as
[54:34] Believers every Seed of Abraham we're
[54:37] doing the same thing that Abraham done
[54:39] we've laid aside every weight we profess
[54:42] that we are pilgrims and strangers how
[54:43] many can make that profession this
[54:45] morning we're not church members but
[54:47] we're pilgrims and strangers we're we're
[54:49] not we're not just members of some group
[54:51] or something but we're pilgrims and
[54:52] strangers we're not of this world
[54:54] because we're pilgrims and strangers we
[54:56] don't act like the world because we're
[54:58] pilgrims and strangers we you know some
[55:00] things as as a body of Believers we do
[55:03] things that is odd to the rest of the
[55:05] world you ever thought about it you
[55:06] you're a people that walk around reading
[55:08] your Bible it may seem odd to the world
[55:10] we pray to a we pray to a god that the
[55:12] world can't see it may seem odd to the
[55:15] world we come to church we sing song to
[55:17] a god that the world can't see we lift
[55:19] our hands we bow down our faces and we
[55:21] worship Him and and we give him glory
[55:24] and we praise him and we say amen and
[55:26] Hal Hallelujah and there's something in
[55:27] us that causes us to worship a god it
[55:30] may seem odd to the world but it's
[55:32] because we're not of this world but
[55:34] we're pilgrims and strangers and we're
[55:36] seeking a city whose Builder and maker
[55:38] is God he said what we're looking for is
[55:41] we're looking for a kingdom that's to
[55:42] come how many believe that say Amen
[55:44] we're looking for a kingdom you realize
[55:46] Abraham he looked for this same Kingdom
[55:48] he was looking for a spirit or very
[55:50] natural Kingdom and I I thought isn't it
[55:52] something that through the life of
[55:54] Abraham I'll take just a minute on this
[55:56] but through the life of Abraham in his
[55:58] natural lineage they have always looked
[56:00] for this Kingdom that Abraham spoke of
[56:03] all the way back in the Book of Genesis
[56:04] they they've looked for it Israel has
[56:07] longed to see the ushering end of this
[56:08] kingdom do you realize today that they
[56:10] still look for this Kingdom they look
[56:12] they look for the rise and uh through or
[56:14] or or through the rise and the fall of
[56:16] many great kingdoms they look for this
[56:18] one to come through the changes of
[56:20] regime from from King to Queen to
[56:23] Monarch unto unto the prime minister to
[56:26] the cabinet that they have today they
[56:28] have awaited the coming of a king and a
[56:30] savior I thought but here here they had
[56:33] awaited all of this time and through all
[56:35] these Thousand Years had gone by they
[56:37] had been waiting for what Abraham had
[56:39] spoke of and waiting for God to lead
[56:41] them out of out of the these periods
[56:44] that they had gone through in periods of
[56:45] failure and and turmoil and wars and all
[56:49] these things but they're waiting for one
[56:50] that that would come that would deliver
[56:52] them from all of this and so here we we
[56:54] find oursel in the time of of Isaiah do
[56:57] you realize when Isaiah would prophesy
[57:00] it was during one of the darkest periods
[57:02] in Israel's history and in this period
[57:04] you realize that Israel was actually
[57:06] preparing for an invasion and here here
[57:09] they were they were troubled and and
[57:11] King ahaz he was he was uh so troubled
[57:14] he was looking at the face of captivity
[57:16] and and and they were looking at a
[57:18] coalition an army that had built up in
[57:20] the northern part of Israel that would
[57:21] come uh to destroy this great nation and
[57:24] and the Bible would tell us the story of
[57:26] how that Syria and Ephraim and how they
[57:28] they had built this Army and the and and
[57:31] Ralia the they they had came to to bring
[57:34] evil against Judah and the Bible said
[57:36] that they had purposed in their heart
[57:37] that they would come into Judah and they
[57:39] would take over this place and and they
[57:41] would they would Outcast the king of
[57:43] Judah and they would put him away and
[57:45] they said Well what we'll do is we'll go
[57:46] in we'll take over this land and when we
[57:48] take it over we'll put a king in his
[57:52] place so here they had purposed in their
[57:54] heart that they would take out the king
[57:55] that God had established or this nation
[57:58] that God had established and they would
[58:00] raise up their own King and they would
[58:01] set him in this place and so it was
[58:03] during this time that Isaiah would come
[58:06] and he would prophesy to the king ahaz
[58:08] and of course here in this very troubled
[58:10] time that Isaiah would begin to speak he
[58:12] said that nations would fall and God
[58:15] will come and God will be a God to you
[58:17] and you will see the greatness of God
[58:19] and and the Bible says and moreover the
[58:21] Lord spoke again to ahaz and here he
[58:24] would begin to show show all the things
[58:26] that God was going to do for him he says
[58:28] but the Lord spake to ahaz I thought
[58:30] here here here is a good lesson because
[58:32] when ahaz heard Isaiah speak he didn't
[58:35] take it as a word from God he took it as
[58:37] a word from Isaiah I thought many people
[58:39] make that mistake today is they'll hear
[58:41] a man speak and say well there was just
[58:43] a man watch watch ahaz his response or
[58:45] he's just a a prophet he's not my
[58:47] Prophet he's the people's Prophet
[58:48] they're the one that made him there but
[58:50] I'm not going to accept accept him as
[58:52] that so to ahaz he was just a man but I
[58:55] thought you know how is that although it
[58:57] was just the voice of a man but we got
[58:59] to be careful not to dismiss the voice
[59:01] of a man because sometimes it may seem
[59:03] as the voice of a man but it's actually
[59:05] a word from the Lord and so here the
[59:08] Bible says the Lord spoke to ahaz so it
[59:11] wasn't Isaiah speaking to ahaz it was
[59:13] through the mouth of Isaiah but the Lord
[59:15] spoke to ahaz and when he he spoke to
[59:17] him he said he he Isaiah said ask the
[59:20] Lord for a sign I want you to notice the
[59:22] answer that ahaz gave here they were in
[59:24] such a trouble that the the war was
[59:26] about to take place there was a a great
[59:28] enemy on the northern border they were
[59:30] coming in he needed help they needed
[59:32] defense they needed somebody to stand
[59:33] with them somebody to stand by their
[59:35] side they needed they needed the ability
[59:37] the strength to be able to fight this
[59:38] enemy and Isaiah said ask the Lord for a
[59:41] sign that he's going to deliver you ask
[59:43] the Lord for a sign that he'll be able
[59:45] to defend you and and the Bible says but
[59:46] ahaz answered and he said I will not ask
[59:50] and neither will I tempt the Lord you
[59:52] know from the outside it looks like that
[59:54] it might have been a good answer well
[59:56] how can I tempt the Lord God this is
[59:58] ahaz the great king ahaz this answer he
[1:00:00] said I shall not tempt the Lord I w't I
[1:00:03] certainly won't temp the Lord you know
[1:00:04] to us it may look like a good answer but
[1:00:07] without knowing the heart of ahaz you
[1:00:08] wouldn't know what it really meant see
[1:00:10] because ahaz according to the history we
[1:00:12] find out that here what Isaiah was
[1:00:14] offering him he was telling him as he
[1:00:16] was sent by God he was showing a sign
[1:00:19] that would reassure him that God would
[1:00:20] protect Judah in this great battle he
[1:00:22] said ask God for a sign that that that
[1:00:25] that he would he would protect you but
[1:00:27] but ahaz he refused to ask for a sign
[1:00:29] and what he was actually showing is that
[1:00:31] that he didn't have the faith that God
[1:00:33] was able to perform what what what
[1:00:35] Isaiah was saying so he couldn't take
[1:00:36] the word of Isaiah he didn't have the
[1:00:38] faith that God could perform it and and
[1:00:41] after all if God did perform it and he
[1:00:43] did rely on God and he did he did hear
[1:00:45] the sign that Isaiah would bring that
[1:00:48] then he would have to be forced to
[1:00:49] follow Jehovah and that means he would
[1:00:51] have to be forced to to turn away from
[1:00:53] the world and ahaz was a man that was
[1:00:55] drawn to the world he was a man that had
[1:00:57] been to Assyria many times he had he had
[1:01:00] great friendships in Assyria this great
[1:01:01] nation and and and and and he loved the
[1:01:04] things the way that Assyria was ran he
[1:01:06] loved the nation he Lov the great part
[1:01:08] about it he loved their military he even
[1:01:10] went to some of their church services
[1:01:12] and he thought my isn't it quite nice
[1:01:14] and you know he he actually loved this
[1:01:16] and here here as he would show this that
[1:01:18] his heart was to was to follow after
[1:01:21] Assyria and here Isaiah would come he
[1:01:23] said don't follow after Assyria but turn
[1:01:25] to God don't put your trust in Assyria
[1:01:28] but put your trust in God and then
[1:01:29] Isaiah as he as he begin to speak it you
[1:01:32] notice he would say to him he said here
[1:01:34] now oh House of David he said is it a
[1:01:37] small thing to weary men but will you
[1:01:39] not weary God also in other words that
[1:01:41] you would rely on men but you wouldn't
[1:01:43] rely on God you don't it don't trouble
[1:01:45] you to go to the king and ask the
[1:01:47] Assyrian King for hell but it troubles
[1:01:49] you to go to God and ask God for help
[1:01:51] and here oh my what a message as you
[1:01:52] begin to speak to him but notice the
[1:01:54] Bible says but a has refused to hear the
[1:01:57] sign but because he refused to hear the
[1:02:00] sign notice what God's going to do he
[1:02:02] gave him a sign anyway he said I I'm not
[1:02:04] going to ask for it I refuse to hear it
[1:02:06] but Isaiah said but therefore the Lord
[1:02:09] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:02:12] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:02:14] shall call his name Emmanuel I thought
[1:02:17] isn't it something that hear the king
[1:02:18] said I don't want to hear the sign but
[1:02:20] God said I'm going to give the sign
[1:02:22] anyway because I got another purpose for
[1:02:24] it so just because the king said I don't
[1:02:26] want to hear it I I don't want it spoken
[1:02:28] and I don't want it written down but God
[1:02:30] had a purpose for the sign that would be
[1:02:32] spoken from the mouth of Isaiah even
[1:02:34] though he may not have had a good
[1:02:35] platform to speak it but still yet
[1:02:37] Isaiah came and he spoke the word of the
[1:02:39] Lord behold the Lord himself shall give
[1:02:41] you a sign you realize that this
[1:02:42] prophecy that Isaiah made it was about a
[1:02:45] future child that would come to the
[1:02:46] world that would bring righteousness and
[1:02:48] he he would rule forever and this child
[1:02:51] he would be a descendant of King David
[1:02:53] he would be the Messiah the anointed one
[1:02:54] he would be Christ the king and the
[1:02:56] savior of the world and you realize that
[1:02:58] ahaz he didn't want another leader he
[1:03:01] didn't want another king he didn't he
[1:03:02] didn't want a savior he he he he was a
[1:03:05] he was a man that was in his 20s and and
[1:03:08] in his age he was an arrogant King and
[1:03:10] he didn't want to have that kind of
[1:03:11] relationship with God but history would
[1:03:13] tell us that ahaz he rejected the sign
[1:03:16] and he accepted the Assyrian army
[1:03:18] instead I thought ma what what a way it
[1:03:21] was you realize that what ah has done is
[1:03:23] whenever he had went to this place that
[1:03:25] he allowed a Syria to come into His
[1:03:27] nation and to be his friend he allowed
[1:03:29] him to come and to set up strongholds in
[1:03:31] the land in the land of Judah he allowed
[1:03:34] them to bring their army in and to set
[1:03:36] up a defense so they could defend Israel
[1:03:39] and let me tell you what happened the
[1:03:40] Bible would tell us through history uh
[1:03:42] that that that that ain't all that ahaz
[1:03:44] has done he as they begin to bring their
[1:03:46] army in and they set up to defend and
[1:03:48] they set up these strongholds that also
[1:03:50] that ahaz went over into into the land
[1:03:52] of Assyria and he went to the the temple
[1:03:55] and he said you you know what I like
[1:03:56] what they do in their Temple and M they
[1:03:58] have quite a nice altar over there so he
[1:04:00] said went back to Israel he said let's
[1:04:02] build an altar like they got in Assyria
[1:04:04] and let's put it in the house of God you
[1:04:06] know I like the way they worship so
[1:04:08] let's worship like they did over in
[1:04:09] Assyria in the house of God but do you
[1:04:11] realize that God don't want us
[1:04:13] worshiping like somebody else he don't
[1:04:15] want us copying after somebody else or
[1:04:17] something that you came out of or some
[1:04:18] old old church or something or some
[1:04:20] religion but he said but but he came and
[1:04:22] he established this in the in the
[1:04:24] kingdom of God but you realize what the
[1:04:26] Bible would tell us within 10 years that
[1:04:29] Assyria no not only did they drive out
[1:04:31] all the enemy and they used the the the
[1:04:34] the the uh uh the unity of Israel the
[1:04:36] union with Israel to destroy any threat
[1:04:38] of an oncoming enemy but the Bible says
[1:04:41] that after they had drove out the enemy
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:44] after or Israel was established again or
[1:04:47] Judah as this great nation then Assyria
[1:04:50] turned on the people that allowed them
[1:04:52] in and they begin to take over the lands
[1:04:54] of Judah that that they were already in
[1:04:56] and the Bible tells us that after a
[1:04:58] little while that they own that land too
[1:05:00] so here ahaz had allowed them in in just
[1:05:02] a few years the Israel was under bondage
[1:05:05] they were they were their temples were
[1:05:07] filled with the worship of the Assyrian
[1:05:09] people because he wouldn't see the sign
[1:05:11] of God and the world had came in Assyria
[1:05:14] had came in it took over his kingdom and
[1:05:17] it took the life of a king and the
[1:05:18] people were so disappointed with the
[1:05:20] decisions that ahaz made that they
[1:05:22] wouldn't even bury him in the Tomb of
[1:05:23] the Kings but they buried him off out in
[1:05:25] the field somewhere because he had
[1:05:27] failed to see the sign that God has sent
[1:05:30] I thought my is't that the way it is he
[1:05:32] rejected the sign that God sent and
[1:05:34] accepted the world I think that's the
[1:05:36] way it is today there's too many people
[1:05:38] in trouble because they reject the sign
[1:05:40] that God sent and they accept the world
[1:05:42] in instead that's what Isaiah said he
[1:05:45] said behold the Lord himself shall send
[1:05:47] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:05:49] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:05:52] his name Emmanuel see it was God's sign
[1:05:54] oh friends I want you glad this morning
[1:05:56] that God don't judge the whole world by
[1:05:58] the decision of one man what makes me
[1:06:01] want to shout this morning I'm so
[1:06:03] thankful that God don't judge all of us
[1:06:05] because of the decision of one man there
[1:06:07] may be a man that would reject the sign
[1:06:09] and accept the world but I think God
[1:06:11] that he still gives us an opportunity
[1:06:13] this morning to accept the sign that God
[1:06:16] has
[1:06:17] given every one of us had the same
[1:06:20] opportunity said he shall call his name
[1:06:22] Emanuel how many knows the meaning of
[1:06:24] that great name
[1:06:26] when you read Emmanuel in the Hebrew
[1:06:28] it's a compound word the word I am which
[1:06:31] is with the word an you which is us and
[1:06:33] the word L which is God the angel of
[1:06:36] Lord of course when Mary would meet him
[1:06:38] the Bible says in Matthew the first
[1:06:40] chapter Behold a virgin shall be with a
[1:06:42] child and shall bring forth a son and
[1:06:44] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[1:06:47] means God With Us amen ain't that a
[1:06:50] wonderful thing to think about God With
[1:06:52] Us can we think about that just a minute
[1:06:54] this morning a god that is with us do
[1:06:57] you realize that this is God's desire
[1:06:59] from the beginning when God made man and
[1:07:01] he and he created man in the beginning
[1:07:03] the Bible says God made man in his own
[1:07:04] image and here that God was so pleased
[1:07:07] with the man that he had created and he
[1:07:09] went down into the ground and brother
[1:07:11] Wesley out of the the dust of the ground
[1:07:13] the Bible said he formed the Flesh of
[1:07:14] Adam even the and and he called his name
[1:07:16] Adam even the name Adam it means son of
[1:07:19] the earth and so here as Adam would come
[1:07:22] uh to be and here Eve and they would go
[1:07:24] in the garden they would would go
[1:07:25] through the time of the fall in the
[1:07:27] garden the Bible would tell us that all
[1:07:28] of creation was lost because of the fall
[1:07:30] in the garden and here God wanted to be
[1:07:33] a god with his children he wanted to
[1:07:35] have communion and have the fellowship
[1:07:36] with him but because the human race was
[1:07:38] in a fallen condition you realize that
[1:07:40] God being the kind of God that he is God
[1:07:43] just couldn't leave it there that's the
[1:07:44] way he is with every one of us that
[1:07:46] sometimes we find oursel in a fallen
[1:07:48] condition but God can't leave in there
[1:07:50] it's not his nature says so he couldn't
[1:07:52] leave it in that place so in the mind of
[1:07:53] God he be to plan for a that he could
[1:07:56] bring Deliverance to the world and that
[1:07:57] a sacrifice that that he can make that
[1:07:59] would be a worthy sacrifice that would
[1:08:01] meet the requirements of the law that
[1:08:03] would meet God's standard and it would
[1:08:05] provide a true atonement for the sin of
[1:08:07] man this is what was taking place in the
[1:08:09] mind of God let me tell you what God
[1:08:11] done he didn't just leave it in his mind
[1:08:13] brother Wesley but he wanted to make a
[1:08:15] way that he could redeem a fallen man he
[1:08:17] wanted to bring something to the Earth
[1:08:18] that would restore that that had been
[1:08:20] broken how they had become alienated
[1:08:22] from God that God wanted to make a way
[1:08:24] that he could bring it back together
[1:08:25] aren't you glad that God is a god of
[1:08:27] restoration and he he's a god of
[1:08:29] redemption and so because God had it in
[1:08:31] his mind he couldn't just leave it in
[1:08:33] his mind but then he begin to speak it
[1:08:35] you say well how did God speak it he
[1:08:37] took his prophets and begin to anoint
[1:08:39] them with a word from the Lord and the
[1:08:41] Bible says through history we see the
[1:08:43] mind of God being able to be displayed
[1:08:46] through the mouth of the prophecy and we
[1:08:47] find over in Isaiah the nth chapter
[1:08:49] Isaiah said For unto us a child is born
[1:08:53] unto us a son is given and the
[1:08:55] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:08:57] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:08:59] and counselor the Mighty God and the
[1:09:02] Everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:09:04] and of the increase of his government in
[1:09:06] peace there shall be no end glory and of
[1:09:10] the increase of his government and of
[1:09:12] peace that shall be no end in other
[1:09:14] words it'll continue to grow it'll never
[1:09:16] be destroyed it'll never be turned down
[1:09:19] or cast down or beat down but upon the
[1:09:21] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[1:09:24] order it he will establish it with
[1:09:26] judgment and with Justice and henceforth
[1:09:28] forever more and the Zeal of the Lord of
[1:09:31] hosts will perform this so Isaiah begins
[1:09:35] to talk about what God is going to do
[1:09:37] and how that a child would be born and
[1:09:40] then we find the prophet Mah as he would
[1:09:42] pick it up he said and he this child you
[1:09:44] said where would he be born he said out
[1:09:45] of Bethlehem uh there would be one that
[1:09:48] would be born that would be the ruler of
[1:09:49] Israel whose goings forth have been from
[1:09:52] old and otherwise he didn't just come as
[1:09:54] a thought today but it came from out of
[1:09:56] the mind of God he he's been going since
[1:09:58] the beginning of creation and and from
[1:10:01] Bethlehem would be born a child that
[1:10:03] came all the way back out of the mind of
[1:10:05] God from the very beginning
[1:10:08] Nebuchadnezzar 150 years later has a
[1:10:10] dream of this great image of of gold and
[1:10:13] brass and iron and Clay remember the
[1:10:15] story we' preached on it many times but
[1:10:17] he calls upon Daniel the Prophet and
[1:10:19] Daniel begins to interpret his dream he
[1:10:21] said here he said oh he said what will
[1:10:23] happen he said is that that as you build
[1:10:25] up this Kingdom every Kingdom after you
[1:10:27] will be a worse Kingdom but it's going
[1:10:29] to come a time that out of the mountain
[1:10:31] would come a stone and it was track the
[1:10:33] foot of this great image and it would be
[1:10:35] destroyed he said and at that time the
[1:10:37] Lord himself at the time of these Kings
[1:10:40] the god of heaven will set up his own
[1:10:41] kingdom and his kingdom will never be
[1:10:44] destroyed Prophet after Prophet begin to
[1:10:47] prophesy of the coming of the kingdom of
[1:10:49] God he said and then the kingdom I love
[1:10:52] this part he said can we just preach it
[1:10:53] a minute he said the king om shall not
[1:10:55] be left to other people but it'll break
[1:10:58] in pieces and consume all of these
[1:11:00] kingdoms and it shall stand forever that
[1:11:03] means that God is going to establish a
[1:11:04] kingdom on this Earth and it ain't going
[1:11:06] to be left to the hands of men it ain't
[1:11:08] going to be left to the failures of men
[1:11:10] or the misleading or the misguiding
[1:11:11] where people could take this part and
[1:11:13] this part away from you he said but God
[1:11:15] is going to come in the end and he's
[1:11:17] going to establish a kingdom upon the
[1:11:18] Earth and that Kingdom it'll never fall
[1:11:21] it'll never be destroyed there ain't no
[1:11:23] man that can tamper with it that can
[1:11:24] take it away from the people of God but
[1:11:26] it was given to them by God and they're
[1:11:28] ordained of God to be able to receive it
[1:11:31] it'll stand forever but then there come
[1:11:34] a time for that Kingdom to come present
[1:11:37] on the earth I think about this this
[1:11:40] morning that here you realize what a
[1:11:42] kingdom is God has prophesying a
[1:11:44] becoming Kingdom but a kingdom by
[1:11:46] definition is a territory that is ruled
[1:11:49] by a
[1:11:50] monarchy so in other words let me say it
[1:11:52] like this that you can't have a kingdom
[1:11:54] without not a king or a queen there has
[1:11:58] to be a monarchy so if God is going to
[1:12:00] bring a kingdom then there first had to
[1:12:02] be a king otherwise it was just a group
[1:12:04] of people so see here he's prophesying
[1:12:07] of this coming Kingdom says so if God is
[1:12:09] going to establish a kingdom then the
[1:12:11] first thing he'd have to do is to bring
[1:12:13] forth a king and under that King and
[1:12:16] then maybe it'd be one subject and then
[1:12:18] two subjects and three subjects but as
[1:12:20] the subjects would begin to grow the
[1:12:23] kingdom of God grew upon the Earth I
[1:12:25] thought watch this great spiritual
[1:12:26] Kingdom at the birth of Jesus that the
[1:12:29] kingdom of heaven was born upon the
[1:12:31] Earth this is this is what Jesus brought
[1:12:33] to the Earth here and do you realize
[1:12:35] that it wasn't after he got to a certain
[1:12:37] age let me just say this I know it
[1:12:39] debunks some theologians but Jesus was
[1:12:41] born as a king he was born as a king he
[1:12:44] was born as a ruler he was born as a
[1:12:47] savior he didn't work his way to become
[1:12:49] a savior he was born a savior he was
[1:12:51] born a deliverer he was born a Healer
[1:12:54] even at the time of his birth he was all
[1:12:56] of
[1:12:57] that God's gift to the Earth even the
[1:13:00] name that he was given the angel said
[1:13:02] you should call his name Jesus or call
[1:13:05] his name what what did the angel say you
[1:13:06] shall call his name Yeshua which meant a
[1:13:09] Lord that saves we we translate that to
[1:13:12] the to the name Jesus but the Lord the
[1:13:14] Lord saves even in the in his own name
[1:13:17] the meaning of his name showed the
[1:13:19] purpose of his ministry on Earth that
[1:13:21] the Lord saves so here you say well what
[1:13:23] was it it was the spiritual salvation of
[1:13:26] God's people it was to to remove that
[1:13:29] the alienation that they had with God
[1:13:31] that that their sins that that they
[1:13:33] created that God would remove that from
[1:13:35] them that they'd be able to be with God
[1:13:37] again you know I think about that here
[1:13:39] that here as the angel would say you
[1:13:41] call his name Yeshua you call his name
[1:13:44] Jesus it meant that the Lord saves you
[1:13:46] know that he's been called many things
[1:13:49] but what I find today is every name that
[1:13:51] Jesus was called it was used to define
[1:13:53] or identify a
[1:13:55] a characteristic that he had in a
[1:13:57] relationship that he has with someone
[1:14:00] see I'm a I'm a dad to some people so
[1:14:02] they call me dad you may not call me dad
[1:14:04] cuz I'm not your dad but I have children
[1:14:05] here that they call me dad but it's my
[1:14:07] name because I have that relationship
[1:14:09] with them and so the names that Jesus is
[1:14:11] called is to identify a relationship
[1:14:14] that he has with those that's why he was
[1:14:16] called God he was called father he was
[1:14:18] called son I wonder if some of us can
[1:14:20] Define uh Define him by a relationship
[1:14:22] that you've had with him the Bible in
[1:14:24] one place the said he was called
[1:14:26] Advocate how many how many can say am
[1:14:28] man this morning and say he's been an
[1:14:29] advocate to me when I was in trouble but
[1:14:31] he stood in my stand he defended me when
[1:14:33] I was on trial and I should have I
[1:14:35] should have gone away but he was an
[1:14:37] advocate and he stood in my stad he's
[1:14:39] been called many things to identify his
[1:14:41] relationship I say he's been called the
[1:14:43] master how many say Amen he's been my
[1:14:46] master he he's been called the the the
[1:14:48] leader of the church he's been called
[1:14:50] he's been called a rock how many say
[1:14:52] Amen he's a rock he he's been called the
[1:14:54] alpha and the Omega he's the Messiah he
[1:14:57] was the teacher he was the Beloved he
[1:14:59] was the branch of the Lord he was a good
[1:15:01] shepherd He was the light of the world
[1:15:03] he was a savior he was the author he was
[1:15:05] an everlasting father he was the line of
[1:15:08] the tribe of Judah that mean he went
[1:15:09] into battle for me so when I go into
[1:15:11] battle I can win every battle cuz the
[1:15:13] line of the tribe of Judah is on my side
[1:15:16] he was called the Dayspring he was
[1:15:18] called Emanuel and he's been an Emmanuel
[1:15:20] to me because he's God with me whenever
[1:15:22] I have when I have need of him in the
[1:15:24] time of Darkness he was my bride and
[1:15:26] Morning Star when I needed a guide on my
[1:15:29] way and I lost my path he was a guide un
[1:15:31] me I say he's been called many things
[1:15:34] but that's his relationship with me he's
[1:15:36] the way he was the truth he was the life
[1:15:39] he was the king of Jews he was the son
[1:15:41] of man he was the bridegroom he was the
[1:15:43] Prince of Peace he was the almighty he
[1:15:45] was a servant he was a he was a Chief
[1:15:47] Cornerstone he was the image of an
[1:15:49] invisible God that's our Jesus praise
[1:15:53] God he's been called things in the Book
[1:15:56] of Revelations he was called a faithful
[1:15:58] witness but you realize that whenever
[1:16:00] jesus takes on a name that he actually
[1:16:03] he actually displays an attribute that
[1:16:05] he gives to you as a Believer so if he
[1:16:07] was called an overcomer it means you're
[1:16:09] an overcomer if he was called a savior
[1:16:11] you said well how can I be a savior the
[1:16:13] Christ in you is what's saving the world
[1:16:15] it's the it's the very thing the word
[1:16:17] that you minister to somebody else that
[1:16:19] brings him to Salvation you say well how
[1:16:21] can I be a Healer the Bible said he
[1:16:23] gives us Gifts of healing why would he
[1:16:25] asked us to lay hands on one another
[1:16:26] that we' receive healing because that
[1:16:28] same healer that walked upon the Earth
[1:16:30] is dwelling on the inside of you this
[1:16:32] morning the Bible said that he was a
[1:16:34] faithful I feel like preaching this
[1:16:36] morning don't don't let me go long he
[1:16:38] was a faithful witness he was a faithful
[1:16:40] from that means from his birth you
[1:16:41] realize that from his birth that Jesus
[1:16:44] was always found faithful in his calling
[1:16:46] he was faithful in his purpose he was a
[1:16:48] Fai you say well what was he a witness
[1:16:49] of well here's what the Bible said
[1:16:51] whenever he stood before Pilate pilate
[1:16:53] said just answer this one question are
[1:16:55] you a king or
[1:16:56] not and Jesus said you say that I am a
[1:16:59] king but to this end was I born and this
[1:17:02] cause I came into the world that I
[1:17:04] should bear witness unto truth yeah
[1:17:06] right and everyone that is of Truth
[1:17:08] hears my voice see he spoke truth he
[1:17:12] lived truth even in his own death he
[1:17:14] stood for truth he would go by by the by
[1:17:17] the the cross of crucifixion but it
[1:17:19] didn't matter he stood for truth you
[1:17:21] know what you know what this shows us
[1:17:22] that Jesus understands the challenges
[1:17:25] that it takes for us to be faithful
[1:17:26] that's right all the things that he was
[1:17:29] he gone through it to understand the
[1:17:31] challenge that you would face in this
[1:17:33] hour so here to be an overcome he
[1:17:36] understands the challenge of what it
[1:17:37] takes to be an overcomer he understands
[1:17:39] the challenge of what it takes to have
[1:17:41] faith he understands the challenge of
[1:17:43] what it takes to be able to fulfill your
[1:17:45] your purpose with God or to be able to
[1:17:46] walk with God he understands the
[1:17:48] pressure that we're living in and don't
[1:17:50] you realize this morning that we're
[1:17:51] living under a real pressure there's so
[1:17:53] much pressure on the Believers today to
[1:17:56] be a believer there there's a pressures
[1:17:58] to be uh finances and pressure there's
[1:18:01] spiritual pressure great great natural
[1:18:03] pressures that we face but you realize
[1:18:05] that we're living under the age of great
[1:18:06] pressure and here in this age the
[1:18:08] greatest pressure that we have on the
[1:18:10] Christian Church it ain't money it ain't
[1:18:12] finances it that that's not the pressure
[1:18:14] we have but the pressure that the church
[1:18:16] according to the Bible the pressure that
[1:18:18] the church would have in the end time is
[1:18:19] the pressure to compromise on truth
[1:18:22] that's what the Bible says Matthew 24
[1:18:24] there would in the end time there'd be
[1:18:26] earthquakes and persecution and famine
[1:18:28] and and and and in second Timothy that
[1:18:30] people would would look for answers and
[1:18:32] they'd go and try to find some that
[1:18:33] would have itching ears and looking for
[1:18:35] answers and many false prophets and
[1:18:37] false Christ would arise and they' say
[1:18:38] come over here and find God or follow me
[1:18:40] out here and we'll find God he said but
[1:18:42] don't look to all those things but but
[1:18:44] for the Bible says it may all sound good
[1:18:46] but Jesus said Matthew it all will lead
[1:18:49] to your death so be faithful our
[1:18:52] Faithful is faithfulness is not just to
[1:18:54] follow after whatever come by he said
[1:18:56] But Here We ought to be faithful do you
[1:18:58] realize that that our faith is
[1:19:00] constantly tested in this hour but to be
[1:19:02] faithful it means to remain loyal or
[1:19:04] steadfast to be reliable it means to
[1:19:07] stay the course not not to be a witness
[1:19:09] against one another but to be a witness
[1:19:11] against the devil to be to be able to
[1:19:13] stand for God and stand for his word to
[1:19:15] be faithful in this hour for Paul said
[1:19:18] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[1:19:21] somebody say if if we hold the beginning
[1:19:24] of our confidence steadfast to the end
[1:19:28] what is he talking about if we remain
[1:19:29] faithful the confidence that we had in
[1:19:32] the beginning if you hold that until the
[1:19:34] end he said you are made partakers with
[1:19:36] Christ in other words don't lose your
[1:19:39] confidence in God don't lose don't lose
[1:19:42] your trust in God that God is able to
[1:19:44] lead the church don't lose our
[1:19:45] confidence in God that God is still
[1:19:47] leading us and God is still making a way
[1:19:50] you realize that so many today that
[1:19:51] they'll follow they my goodness I'll get
[1:19:53] myself in trouble they follow after too
[1:19:55] many other things than to follow after
[1:19:57] God but don't lose your confidence in
[1:19:59] God let God lead you let let God lead
[1:20:01] the church let God continue you realize
[1:20:04] our church has made some shifts you know
[1:20:06] why it's called it's called growth and
[1:20:07] and you see the you see the growth of
[1:20:09] the church because God has wanting to
[1:20:11] take the church somewhere and I and how
[1:20:13] be it that any of us would get in God's
[1:20:15] way but I say Lord don't let me get in
[1:20:16] your way just let me be in your will
[1:20:18] Lord let let you use us let God lead the
[1:20:21] church and let us move us to a higher
[1:20:23] Heights and further down the told to one
[1:20:25] day that we'll walk out of this world
[1:20:27] into the Rapture that's our desire as a
[1:20:29] body of Believers Lord put me where you
[1:20:31] need me let me serve where I'm needed
[1:20:33] why because I want to be faithful to the
[1:20:35] cause of God you know somebody could
[1:20:37] come in from the outside and so well you
[1:20:38] don't belong there you belong here I
[1:20:40] can't believe they'd use you there they
[1:20:41] ought to use you here and my why it
[1:20:43] ain't nothing but a devil speaking in
[1:20:44] your ear to make you lose confidence in
[1:20:46] what God has given you but I say we
[1:20:48] ought to remain faithful to what God has
[1:20:50] given us remain faithful to our post to
[1:20:53] duty and remain faithful to to our place
[1:20:55] in the house of God God called you here
[1:20:57] for a
[1:20:59] reason don't lose conf I feel like
[1:21:01] preaching don't lose confidence in God
[1:21:04] lord don't lose confidence in God God is
[1:21:06] still able to lead God's still leading
[1:21:07] the church God still has pastors that
[1:21:09] are called of God that'll keep true to
[1:21:11] the word of God that'll bring a balance
[1:21:13] to his word God still has men that'll
[1:21:15] stand upon the word of God he still has
[1:21:17] a body of believers they can walk out in
[1:21:19] this world and they still live the same
[1:21:21] thing from one day to the next the same
[1:21:23] on in churches that knew out of church
[1:21:26] cuz they're
[1:21:27] faithful be faithful Jesus said in the
[1:21:31] end remember the parable the faithful
[1:21:34] will receive the reward that's right
[1:21:37] many will fall but the faithful will
[1:21:38] receive the reward that's it remember
[1:21:40] when he did gave the parable of the of
[1:21:42] the servant and the king and he said but
[1:21:44] then the then the master came to the
[1:21:46] servant and he said unto him well done
[1:21:48] my good and faithful servant thou Hast
[1:21:50] been Faithful over a few things you know
[1:21:53] that's a way to today people want great
[1:21:56] things they want a great wealth they
[1:21:57] want great Ministries they want great
[1:21:59] they want they want a a great status a
[1:22:01] great position or something like that
[1:22:03] but you realize what Jesus said he said
[1:22:05] I found him a good and faithful servant
[1:22:08] because he was Faithful over little
[1:22:10] things over a few things he said and
[1:22:13] because he was Faithful over a few
[1:22:15] things I thought my that's the way we
[1:22:16] ought to be this morning we ought to
[1:22:18] just be faithful Christians Faithful
[1:22:20] Servants faithful you know people we
[1:22:23] want to be something that but let's just
[1:22:24] be faithful Christians and Faithful
[1:22:26] Servants and and follow God he said but
[1:22:28] because you've been Faithful over a few
[1:22:30] things I will make you ruler over many
[1:22:32] things so we found them faithful
[1:22:36] faithful in what God has given us and
[1:22:38] faithful in our in our call of God Jesus
[1:22:40] was a faithful witness he wants us as a
[1:22:43] body of Believers to be a faithful
[1:22:44] witness listen what Paul said he said
[1:22:46] let every man abide in the same calling
[1:22:49] wherein he was called I know most people
[1:22:51] quote that and use it to Define
[1:22:53] ministers or talking about preachers but
[1:22:55] notice this word calling it comes from a
[1:22:57] Greek word Claus which means a a calling
[1:22:59] or an invitation a Divine invitation of
[1:23:02] God so it's not just speaking of
[1:23:04] ministry but in other words it's
[1:23:05] actually speaking of all of those that
[1:23:07] have been called by God into the
[1:23:09] household of faith so Paul said is abide
[1:23:12] in the calling wherein you were called
[1:23:14] in other words he begins to talk about
[1:23:16] servants and how that they belong to one
[1:23:18] master but Paul said but in this same
[1:23:20] scripture at 1 Corinthians 7 he said but
[1:23:22] but he said but but God has purchased
[1:23:24] you you've been purchased by God you
[1:23:26] were bought with a price in other words
[1:23:28] you may have belong to another Master
[1:23:29] but now you've been bought with a price
[1:23:31] so you're Christ purchased possession he
[1:23:34] said therefore because you've been
[1:23:36] bought with a price no longer are you
[1:23:38] the servant of men but you're a servant
[1:23:40] of God therefore let every man when he
[1:23:43] is called abide in his calling with God
[1:23:46] abide with God because he is purchased
[1:23:48] to you might you may have been bound by
[1:23:50] another Master you may have been ruled
[1:23:52] by another Master you may have been
[1:23:53] ruled by sin are rued by the flesh but
[1:23:56] Paul said but when you recognize that
[1:23:57] you've been bought with a price this
[1:23:59] morning then abide in the invitation
[1:24:01] that God has given you that I don't have
[1:24:03] to remain back there cuz God has called
[1:24:05] me out he said abide with God be
[1:24:08] faithful serving the lord abide with him
[1:24:11] he said but God is faithful he will not
[1:24:13] suffer you to be tempted above that
[1:24:15] you're able he say how can I be faithful
[1:24:17] with God he said because God is faithful
[1:24:19] with you he will not suffer you to be
[1:24:21] tempted more than than you're able he
[1:24:23] said but when tempt would come he will
[1:24:25] also provide a way of Escape that you
[1:24:27] may be able to bear in other words God
[1:24:29] won't allow anything to tempt you that
[1:24:30] he won't give you a way to overcome it
[1:24:32] hello somebody he said brother Matt I've
[1:24:35] gone through some great trial there
[1:24:36] ain't a trial God would ever allow to
[1:24:38] come on your life that he didn't give
[1:24:39] you a way to get out of it oh I've come
[1:24:41] under a heavy burden I don't know if I
[1:24:43] can carry this one there ain't a burden
[1:24:44] that God would allow to come on your
[1:24:46] life that he wouldn't give you the
[1:24:47] strength to be able to bear I don't know
[1:24:48] if I can go another mile but God
[1:24:50] wouldn't allow you to go down a path
[1:24:52] that he wouldn't give you a way to
[1:24:53] finish
[1:24:55] when God calls you think about it he's
[1:24:58] faithful to see you through think about
[1:25:01] our God this morning he's the god that
[1:25:04] took the children of Israel to the walls
[1:25:06] of Jericho you say wow what an
[1:25:07] impossible place but he was faithful to
[1:25:09] see them through he took him to the Red
[1:25:12] Sea what an impossible situation but he
[1:25:14] was faithful to see him through friends
[1:25:16] don't you realize that God will never
[1:25:17] bring you anywhere that he won't bring
[1:25:19] you through that's it he'll never bring
[1:25:21] you anywhere he didn't bring you this
[1:25:22] far to leave you out in the wilderness
[1:25:24] he he that was the challenge that Moses
[1:25:26] made to God you can't leave us abandoned
[1:25:28] out here for the people will say that
[1:25:29] you brought us this far but you couldn't
[1:25:31] take us in he said but I'm a God that's
[1:25:33] a finisher he's the author and the
[1:25:35] finisher of our faith he don't just
[1:25:37] begin a journey but he'll finish it
[1:25:39] that's right you say well how can we
[1:25:41] stand faithful brother Joe because God
[1:25:42] is faithful that's it he's faithful to
[1:25:45] make a way that you'd be able to stand
[1:25:46] you know there's many rulers many kings
[1:25:49] that have come upon the Earth they have
[1:25:51] many subjects that follow after them but
[1:25:53] I thank God this morning that Heaven has
[1:25:54] a king oh Hallelujah Heaven has a king
[1:25:57] and his name is Jesus he was called in
[1:26:00] the Book of Revelations the Bible said
[1:26:02] they would make war with the lamb and
[1:26:03] the lamb shall overcome them for he who
[1:26:07] is he somebody say the lamb lamb who was
[1:26:10] that Jesus the Lamb of God which was
[1:26:13] Jesus and he is the Lord of lords and
[1:26:17] the king of kings and they that are with
[1:26:20] him are called and chosen and a faithful
[1:26:23] people
[1:26:25] say how can we be faithful because
[1:26:27] Christ is faithful we have a faithful
[1:26:29] King and because we have a faithful King
[1:26:31] we can be faithful to our calling
[1:26:33] because we have a faithful King we can
[1:26:34] be faithful to to the position that he
[1:26:37] has given us and we we can be faithful
[1:26:38] do you realize that that's what God is
[1:26:40] calling us to do he's calling us to
[1:26:42] dedicate ourselves in this hour to serve
[1:26:44] him and and to dedicate oursel to be
[1:26:47] able to uh to be a Christian and to be a
[1:26:49] real servant of God and to and to take
[1:26:51] the invitation that Christ has given us
[1:26:53] to this hour and manifest to life in
[1:26:55] this dark and Dying World said you

[1:27:17] have any peace in your family and and
[1:27:19] and God never work that out you're
[1:27:20] always going to be stuck in this
[1:27:21] situation but you realize you can't go
[1:27:23] over there you know well you know
[1:27:24] sometimes we just need to go and get
[1:27:26] something sometimes brother Wester we
[1:27:27] need something we need a a spiritual
[1:27:29] move we need a we need a refilling of
[1:27:31] the Holy Ghost we need God we need a
[1:27:33] Revival in our heart and so we we're
[1:27:35] walking around in the kingdom of God and
[1:27:37] we're looking for something from God and
[1:27:38] you go over on the grounds of healing
[1:27:40] and say I want to get some healing and
[1:27:42] Satan comes over he says you can't be on
[1:27:44] these grounds but I thank God we have an
[1:27:46] answer this morning you say well what's
[1:27:48] the answer your answer is oh I'm here
[1:27:51] with the King amen amen so you can't be
[1:27:54] over here no I don't no no no I'm I'm
[1:27:56] here with the King can you imagine being
[1:27:58] in the Kingdom of the great king and
[1:28:00] when somebody would come by and say you
[1:28:02] can't go in the hall no I'm here with
[1:28:04] the King you can't go into them Chambers
[1:28:06] but I'm here with the King you can't go
[1:28:08] to the dining room but I'm here with the
[1:28:10] King matter of fact let me tell you
[1:28:12] friends you don't even have to say it
[1:28:13] there's a porter that's standing there
[1:28:15] that say it on your behalf that any
[1:28:17] devil that would try to stand in your
[1:28:19] way to to keep you from a promise of God
[1:28:21] and say I don't think you know who
[1:28:23] you're dealing with but he came in here
[1:28:25] with the King that means all the grounds
[1:28:27] belong to you you have access to every
[1:28:30] ground let me tell you when the king
[1:28:32] gives an invitation it's an open
[1:28:33] invitation it don't come with a with a
[1:28:35] pass like it does in my house when I
[1:28:37] invite you over that don't mean go in my
[1:28:38] bedroom it means you can go anywhere
[1:28:40] else in the house but my bedroom but you
[1:28:42] know when the king invites you it's an
[1:28:44] open
[1:28:45] invitation he gave you an invitation go
[1:28:47] into the go in and make yourself a home
[1:28:49] take off your shoes I'd hate to be a
[1:28:51] guest in the house that they keep you
[1:28:53] put your jacket there put you it it
[1:28:54] makes you feel leave your shoes on if
[1:28:56] you want to take them off if you want to
[1:28:58] prop your feet up on the couch if you
[1:28:59] want to make yourself at home amen why
[1:29:01] because you came with a king we've been
[1:29:03] we've been giving an invitation this
[1:29:05] morning I'm with King Jesus I wonder how
[1:29:07] many say that this morning I'm here with
[1:29:09] King Jesus you can't be healed but I'm
[1:29:11] here with King Jesus you can't have a
[1:29:13] Revival I'm here with King Jesus you
[1:29:16] can't receive it I'm here with King
[1:29:18] Jesus let me tell you not only are you
[1:29:21] here with the King not only did he
[1:29:23] invite you this morning but you have a
[1:29:26] great relationship with him see you know
[1:29:29] maybe they say well he was just a guest
[1:29:30] for a little while but friends let me
[1:29:32] show you in the scripture we're not just
[1:29:33] a guest for a little while you realize
[1:29:35] that the names of family members that we
[1:29:37] give one another I got to think about
[1:29:39] this how that you know that you know
[1:29:40] that your your son is called a son and
[1:29:42] then and then then the next child is
[1:29:44] called a grandson one of these days I'm
[1:29:46] going to have one of them praise the
[1:29:47] Lord but then the next child's a great
[1:29:49] grandson and the next one's a great
[1:29:51] great grandson so as it goes on down you
[1:29:54] you know what the the name that you give
[1:29:56] it actually identifies their place in
[1:29:58] the
[1:29:59] genealogy but do you realize in the
[1:30:01] natural genealogy no matter no matter
[1:30:03] what you're called you know you call
[1:30:04] Aunts Uncles and by the name that we
[1:30:06] give we can identify where they are in
[1:30:08] our genealogy that's the purpose of
[1:30:09] those names and so here whenever we read
[1:30:12] this or or hear about uh being a son or
[1:30:15] a grandson in the genealogy do you
[1:30:17] realize that with each generation the
[1:30:19] DNA that came from the original father
[1:30:21] is cut in half so here he has a son the
[1:30:24] son gets half the DNA from his father he
[1:30:26] gets half the DNA from his mother well
[1:30:28] then when that son would have a son he's
[1:30:30] got a quarter of the DNA from his
[1:30:32] grandpa and see so it goes on he's only
[1:30:34] the DNA is passed down and by every
[1:30:36] generation it loses the amount of DNA
[1:30:39] from the original ancestor by half it's
[1:30:41] called genetic delusion and so as the
[1:30:44] genetics as it passes down continues So
[1:30:47] eventually it's so such a small a small
[1:30:50] part it's such a small part uh uh that
[1:30:52] that that you almost can't even
[1:30:54] recognize it but they're still a little
[1:30:55] part but but you know it's not the same
[1:30:57] anymore they don't really have the same
[1:30:58] characteristics they don't really look
[1:31:00] like them anymore because they've been
[1:31:02] so many things that I'm I'm I'm getting
[1:31:03] somewhere but but there've been so many
[1:31:05] things that that have been entered into
[1:31:07] that seed line and so many different
[1:31:09] parents and different fathers but that
[1:31:11] ain't the only thing uh that that that
[1:31:13] that is lost but also the science would
[1:31:15] tell us that in that that actually the
[1:31:18] the the experiences and memories that
[1:31:20] that first generation had that as you go
[1:31:22] down in Generations that the experience
[1:31:24] is no longer there as well because they
[1:31:27] weren't with great grandpa and they and
[1:31:28] so the experiences and the memories
[1:31:30] change and and and they become less
[1:31:32] accessible and they're replaced with new
[1:31:34] memories of new family members and and
[1:31:36] and through the through the the lens of
[1:31:38] each generation it is filtered into a
[1:31:40] new life and new stories but realize
[1:31:42] that this morning we're not talking
[1:31:44] about an Earthly family we're not
[1:31:46] talking about an Earthly Kingdom but
[1:31:48] we're talking about a Heavenly Kingdom
[1:31:50] and a Heavenly family we're not talking
[1:31:52] about a natural lineage but talking
[1:31:54] about a Heavenly lineage an eternal
[1:31:56] lineage with God and you realize in the
[1:31:58] family of God that God has no
[1:32:00] grandchildren so that means there is no
[1:32:03] loss there is no genetic loss that in
[1:32:05] the family of God it don't matter if
[1:32:07] it's 2,000 years later and 100
[1:32:09] Generations later a person but telling
[1:32:12] another one and telling another one when
[1:32:14] that seed is born upon the Earth in 2024
[1:32:17] they got the same DNA that they had in
[1:32:19] the book of Acts they belong to God and
[1:32:22] the same thing that God gave them in the
[1:32:24] in the upper room is the same thing he
[1:32:26] gives you today we belong to God there
[1:32:28] ain't no regress in the DNA of God there
[1:32:31] ain't no regress in the experience there
[1:32:33] ain't no regress in the memory you don't
[1:32:34] have to have a memory of a great grandpa
[1:32:37] going by God don't have to be a god of
[1:32:39] history that he's a god of a today
[1:32:42] experience a today God a today
[1:32:46] experience we we're we're God's children
[1:32:49] we're not God's grandchildren the Bible
[1:32:50] said as many first John or John the
[1:32:53] first chapter as as many as received him
[1:32:55] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:32:58] of God somebody say Sons son to them
[1:33:01] gave you power to become the sons of God
[1:33:04] even to them that believe on his name
[1:33:06] which were born not of blood nor the
[1:33:08] will of Flesh nor the will of man but
[1:33:09] they were born of God you said well what
[1:33:12] about the daughters let me just tell you
[1:33:13] that word sons of God wasn't just
[1:33:15] talking about boys but it was as many
[1:33:18] they would become the sons that word
[1:33:19] come from the Greek word techon which
[1:33:21] means the child or The Offspring of God
[1:33:24] so whether you're a son or a daughter of
[1:33:26] God that when you're when you when you
[1:33:28] receive him then you have been given
[1:33:31] power to become a child of God you
[1:33:34] realize that not only are you given
[1:33:36] power the reason why you were given
[1:33:40] power can I make one more there's a
[1:33:43] reason why you were given power because
[1:33:45] it was your ordained Destiny as a
[1:33:47] Believer you realize that everything has
[1:33:49] a destiny every every church has a
[1:33:52] Destiny the world has a destiny the
[1:33:53] Earth has a Destiny the heavens has a
[1:33:55] destiny our nation the America it has a
[1:33:58] destiny you can find you can read about
[1:34:00] it it's a sad Destiny but you can read
[1:34:02] about in Revelations the 13th chapter
[1:34:04] about how that great image would be
[1:34:05] destroyed you this nation is it won't
[1:34:08] stand forever that's why we don't put
[1:34:09] our confidence in it but it has a
[1:34:11] destiny we're we're the nation of 13 we
[1:34:13] had 13 stripes or our flag had 13 uh
[1:34:16] Stars when it originated and so here in
[1:34:19] Revelations 13 we find the destiny of
[1:34:21] this great nation but I thought my here
[1:34:23] if the country country would have a
[1:34:24] destiny then so do the children of God
[1:34:26] have a destiny if the world has a
[1:34:28] destiny then so do the children of God
[1:34:30] and not only do we have a destiny but
[1:34:31] God has given us a way to view our
[1:34:33] destiny how many want to hear it he's
[1:34:35] given us a way to look at it but said
[1:34:37] see he said election looks back at for
[1:34:39] knowledge but predestination looks to
[1:34:42] Destiny one looks back and one looks
[1:34:44] forward he say see the election back
[1:34:46] here he uses an illustration of a
[1:34:48] cockabur how many you ever heard this
[1:34:49] you know what we're from Arkansas you
[1:34:51] know what a cockabur is that old that
[1:34:53] old thing that sticks on your pants when
[1:34:55] you go out in the deer woods and it it
[1:34:57] sticks on there it's got stickies all
[1:34:58] over it and you can't get rid of it he
[1:35:00] said that's the kind of nature that we
[1:35:02] have with this flesh and here he uses
[1:35:04] this illustration of how that we would
[1:35:06] go out and and then this we had that
[1:35:08] Cocker nature and you can't tell one
[1:35:10] from the other because they had the old
[1:35:11] the same old sticky nature he said but
[1:35:13] then God before the foundation of the
[1:35:15] world by his forn knowledge he saw that
[1:35:18] cocka bear and inside of it he placed a
[1:35:20] wheat seed So then whenever it would go
[1:35:23] through its life it may look like the
[1:35:24] rest of the cocko birs they have the
[1:35:25] same old sticky nature they make the
[1:35:27] same mistakes they say the same things
[1:35:29] they do the same things they fall in the
[1:35:31] same problems in the same path but at
[1:35:32] some point that seed that's on the
[1:35:34] inside of it begins to grow and all and
[1:35:37] that cckar f it comes out of that old
[1:35:39] cockabur sticky nature that that's going
[1:35:41] to be there until the day you die you
[1:35:43] never get rid of this old flesh said but
[1:35:46] but out of it will come a different life
[1:35:47] it'll come a new nature and brother
[1:35:49] Wesley and that will be the nature of
[1:35:51] that wheat seed he said that's the way
[1:35:52] it was he said I was born in in iniquity
[1:35:54] I was born a sinner from a father and
[1:35:56] mother a family of Sinners I was a
[1:35:58] Cocker bird but then I become a wheat
[1:35:59] seed you say well how did that happen it
[1:36:01] was God's election for before the
[1:36:04] foundation of the world he elected that
[1:36:06] Cocker to become a grain of wheat by his
[1:36:08] forn knowledge God knew every decision
[1:36:10] You' ever make God knew every choice
[1:36:12] You' ever made how can God be an eternal
[1:36:14] God if God don't know what you would do
[1:36:16] God knew you would do it is that
[1:36:18] something that's something about our God
[1:36:19] if you knew what what if we knew what
[1:36:22] each of us would do to each other You'
[1:36:23] never even have a relationship with them
[1:36:25] I ain't never going to talk to them cuz
[1:36:26] I know what they're going to do to me
[1:36:27] down the road I know how they're going
[1:36:29] to treat me I know what they're going to
[1:36:30] say about me I know how they're going to
[1:36:31] talk about me so I'm just not going to
[1:36:33] talk about him if God showed us
[1:36:34] everything we did to one another we'
[1:36:36] never meet
[1:36:37] anybody we' never meet anybody on but he
[1:36:41] didn't show us that but he knew it and
[1:36:43] God that knew all that he accepted us
[1:36:45] anyway he's different he got a different
[1:36:47] nature than we got he accepted us anyway
[1:36:50] knowing we' turn our back and knowing
[1:36:51] we'd walk away from him knowing many
[1:36:53] times we do wrong things but but but but
[1:36:56] yet he would make a way anyway so what
[1:36:58] was it it was election that we would
[1:37:00] become a great and weed you said well
[1:37:01] how did it how did you do it well look
[1:37:04] back is God because God predestinated it
[1:37:06] a long time ago and by his for knowledge
[1:37:09] his election was placed by Forge but
[1:37:11] then he would come into the time of
[1:37:13] predestination to show you what your
[1:37:16] destiny is you say see because election
[1:37:19] shows the forn knowledge of God but
[1:37:21] predestination think about the word
[1:37:23] Destin ination is actually referring to
[1:37:25] your destination or your Destiny says so
[1:37:28] predestination is looking forward to the
[1:37:30] destiny that God has given you you see
[1:37:33] it looks to your destiny you said well
[1:37:35] where will God take me to where am I
[1:37:37] going he said it doesn't matter God
[1:37:39] looks to your destiny he's already made
[1:37:41] a way that you'll be able to make it do
[1:37:43] you realize that God made you a Destiny
[1:37:46] and there ain't nothing that can stop
[1:37:47] you from arriving
[1:37:49] there for the Bible you say well I'm not
[1:37:51] so sure about all that well can I read
[1:37:52] it to you in the Bible oh yeah Paul said
[1:37:54] Ephesians 1:4 according to he has chosen
[1:37:57] Us in him before the foundation of the
[1:37:59] world that's election he chose us in him
[1:38:01] somebody say Amen to that it's the Bible
[1:38:03] it ain't M he has chosen Us in him
[1:38:05] before the foundation of the world so
[1:38:07] when did God choose you somebody spell
[1:38:09] it out before the foundation of the
[1:38:11] world he has chosen Us in him before the
[1:38:13] foundation of the world it ain't a false
[1:38:14] Doctrine it ain't contrary to the
[1:38:16] Scripture it ain't something that
[1:38:17] somebody made up in in the past few
[1:38:19] years it's the Bible That's What Paul
[1:38:20] taught he chose us in him before the
[1:38:22] foundation of the world that's our
[1:38:24] election that we should be holy and
[1:38:26] Without Blame before him in love you
[1:38:28] mean God chose me to be holy knowing I
[1:38:30] was going to be a sinner he chose me to
[1:38:32] be blameless knowing I'd be full of
[1:38:34] blame he chose me he elected me before
[1:38:37] the foundation of the world how about
[1:38:39] the next verse that was election and
[1:38:41] Paul said having predestinated
[1:38:44] us unto the adoption of children so now
[1:38:48] not only did he choose us not only did
[1:38:49] he elect us but he showed us what our
[1:38:51] destiny was he Ed us he predestinated us
[1:38:55] to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:38:56] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:38:58] pleasure of his will so before the
[1:39:00] foundation of the world we were elected
[1:39:02] by God you were chosen by God and then
[1:39:05] you were predestined to a predetermined
[1:39:07] destiny that God had purposed in his
[1:39:10] heart before the world was ever created
[1:39:13] before he said let there be light before
[1:39:15] the darkness was upon the face of the de
[1:39:17] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:39:19] in the mind of God he elected you he
[1:39:21] chose you he Brees ated you to this hour
[1:39:24] he knew you'd be born in this age he
[1:39:26] knew who you were he knew who you'd be
[1:39:28] born to he knew you'd be sitting here
[1:39:30] this morning I don't know what kind of
[1:39:31] God you serve that my God ain't
[1:39:33] something that came out of the figment
[1:39:35] of some man's imagination but it is us
[1:39:37] that came out of the mind of God God
[1:39:40] didn't come out of our mind but we came
[1:39:42] out of his mind and here we are today
[1:39:44] manifesting who God said that we would
[1:39:46] be we're the Church of the Living God
[1:39:48] with the bow of Jesus Christ you're Sons
[1:39:50] and Daughters of God you're you're a son
[1:39:52] of the king this
[1:39:54] morning it's our destiny you say oh our
[1:39:58] destiny was to be a child of God say
[1:40:00] what about my failures don't you realize
[1:40:02] it wasn't based on our worthiness
[1:40:04] brother Joe preached it fine Wednesday
[1:40:06] night it wasn't based on our worthiness
[1:40:08] but the Bible says but to the praise and
[1:40:11] the glory of his grace can you leave
[1:40:13] that up there brother Ben but to the
[1:40:15] praise and the glory of his grace listen
[1:40:17] to this you being a Son of God gives
[1:40:21] praise to the greatness in the glory of
[1:40:24] God in other words he done
[1:40:26] that so that so that in your old mixed
[1:40:29] up life that your life being transformed
[1:40:32] would be a praise to his grace isn't
[1:40:35] that something you think of it like that
[1:40:37] that old messed up life that we live you
[1:40:39] say oh what a wreck I can never be right
[1:40:41] with God but but but he' done that that
[1:40:44] your life would be a testimony of his
[1:40:46] grace Paul said he done it he
[1:40:48] predestinated us to the praise of the
[1:40:50] glory of his grace of his favor that he
[1:40:54] gives us he said see you're we're praise
[1:40:56] you realize that you in church this
[1:40:58] morning serving God even when the devil
[1:41:00] thought he had you but you being here is
[1:41:02] a praise to the glory of God's grace do
[1:41:05] you realize you lifting your hands this
[1:41:07] morning when the devil says well I'll
[1:41:08] just keep them down they'll never be
[1:41:11] free again I'll never let them go back
[1:41:12] to church I I'll just weigh them down
[1:41:14] with so many pressures of the world that
[1:41:15] they can't even serve God no more but
[1:41:17] here you are this morning with your hand
[1:41:18] raised what is it it's a testimony a
[1:41:21] praise to the glory of God's grace here
[1:41:23] we are you said what are we doing we're
[1:41:25] praising his grace our sisters when you
[1:41:26] go out in the world you live a life of
[1:41:28] Holiness what is it it's a praise to the
[1:41:30] glory of his grace you brothers that go
[1:41:32] out and you live a life of Holiness it's
[1:41:34] a praise to the glory of the grace of
[1:41:36] God the Bible says wherein he has made
[1:41:38] us accepted in the
[1:41:40] Beloved in other words he is we we're a
[1:41:45] part of this group of people that are
[1:41:47] called The Beloved right a group of
[1:41:49] people that God has called before the
[1:41:51] foundation of the world God has made us
[1:41:53] accepted in the family of the Beloved in
[1:41:56] other words you know what that means
[1:41:57] beloved it's a gapo which came from the
[1:42:00] love of God it means those that have
[1:42:02] received the love of God and here he has
[1:42:04] made us accepted in the family of those
[1:42:07] that have received the love of God you
[1:42:09] know what it is the love of God this
[1:42:11] word by definition it's a love that is
[1:42:13] unconditional it's a love that is not
[1:42:15] reciprocated you realize that God don't
[1:42:17] love you as long as you love him back he
[1:42:19] loves you even if you don't love him
[1:42:20] back he loves you even if you don't give
[1:42:22] him no attention he loves you even if
[1:42:24] you don't worship him even if you don't
[1:42:25] praise him that's why we do praise God
[1:42:27] that's why we come in the house of God
[1:42:29] and give Glory unto God because he gave
[1:42:31] us an unconditional love when we wasn't
[1:42:33] worthy of it I thought my isn't it
[1:42:35] something about our destiny we've been
[1:42:37] given a destiny this morning but
[1:42:39] something about our destiny is that that
[1:42:40] that a prophecy always speaks of Destiny
[1:42:43] you realize when a prophecy Goes Forth
[1:42:44] it's always speaking of a Destiny or
[1:42:46] something that God is going to bring
[1:42:48] about every prophecy is speaking of
[1:42:50] Destiny it's talking about something God
[1:42:52] is going to do you know I thought how
[1:42:54] how it is to see the Bible says a virgin
[1:42:56] shall conceive do you realize that was
[1:42:58] Mary's Destiny she'll bring forth a a
[1:43:01] son he would be born in the town of
[1:43:03] Bethlehem that was Mary's Destiny and
[1:43:06] you realize it don't matter what
[1:43:07] happened whatever she had to go through
[1:43:10] but God had already spoke it through the
[1:43:11] prophets concerning her Destiny and
[1:43:13] there ain't nothing she could do to
[1:43:14] change it because that was her Destiny
[1:43:18] can I close with this think about here
[1:43:21] Mary she had been given a destiny that
[1:43:24] was given by God and you realize in her
[1:43:27] life here her and Joseph and this little
[1:43:30] uh child that she was about to give
[1:43:32] birth to and carrying this little baby
[1:43:35] in her womb and here they were a poor
[1:43:37] family do you realize they had no money
[1:43:39] this was a a very poor family the Bible
[1:43:41] would tell us this of how how that that
[1:43:43] whenever they went after Jesus was 40
[1:43:45] days old they went to the priest to give
[1:43:47] their sacrifice to how many knows what a
[1:43:49] worthy sacrifice was or what a customary
[1:43:51] sacrifice for a newborn baby was for
[1:43:53] purification it was a lamb but they
[1:43:56] didn't have the money to buy a lamb so
[1:43:57] when they went to make the sacrifice
[1:43:59] they bought two Turtle dos instead which
[1:44:01] was a makeaway offering for the poor
[1:44:03] people so here they were a poor people
[1:44:05] on their way they they had no money for
[1:44:07] a journey and they had been called by
[1:44:09] the king's orders here it wasn't by
[1:44:11] Joseph's own will that he went into
[1:44:13] Bethlehem but it was the king's orders
[1:44:14] of their Earthly King that they have to
[1:44:16] go in uh in in to be able uh to the
[1:44:19] census and so they went in after the
[1:44:21] orders of an Earthly King and I thought
[1:44:22] my here they sit here this lady that was
[1:44:25] just about to have a baby sitting on the
[1:44:27] back of a donkey traveling 90 miles
[1:44:29] through lands of robbers and and up and
[1:44:31] down these mountains and and through
[1:44:33] people uh all kinds of treacherous
[1:44:35] people and had no way to defend
[1:44:37] themselves but they had to go because it
[1:44:38] was the king's orders and they followed
[1:44:40] after the king's orders I thought but
[1:44:42] you know what that wasn't the only King
[1:44:44] that had given them an order see but
[1:44:46] because before the foundation of the
[1:44:47] world there was another king that would
[1:44:49] give an order in the mouth of Isaiah he
[1:44:51] would ordain that the destiny of Mary
[1:44:53] that she would be in Bethlehem out of
[1:44:55] the mouth of Mah that there would be a
[1:44:57] kingdom that would be born out of the
[1:44:58] mouth of Daniel and so here because
[1:45:01] another king had given an order it
[1:45:02] didn't matter what she went through she
[1:45:04] had to make it to Bethlehem and that's
[1:45:07] the way it is with you and I is God has
[1:45:09] given you a destiny then you're then
[1:45:11] you're bound to be able to receive it
[1:45:13] you realize the natural King may give an
[1:45:15] order we have orders in this life we
[1:45:16] have to go through sometimes we do
[1:45:18] things that we don't like to do we have
[1:45:20] to work places we don't like to work
[1:45:21] it's the natural order that was given to
[1:45:24] us by the natural King but I thank God
[1:45:26] we have a Heavenly king that's also
[1:45:27] given us an order he said you're going
[1:45:29] to make it through this life you're
[1:45:31] going to make it through persecution
[1:45:32] you're going to make it through the up
[1:45:33] days you're going to make it through the
[1:45:35] down days you're going to make it
[1:45:36] through the times when you're bow you're
[1:45:37] going to make it through the times when
[1:45:39] you're sick because I've given you an
[1:45:40] order that you're going to make it to
[1:45:42] the other side I thank God this morning
[1:45:44] that God has given us a destiny we have
[1:45:47] an order from King Jesus that's our
[1:45:49] destiny as
[1:45:51] Believers brother said you know maybe
[1:45:53] sometimes married with a ask why has God
[1:45:55] put me on this path some of you ask that
[1:45:57] some of us are too prideful to ask why
[1:45:59] has God put me on this path said but you
[1:46:02] ought to give us consolation to know
[1:46:04] this that we can I read it as you stand
[1:46:07] to your feet we do not hold our
[1:46:10] destiny god holds our destiny that makes
[1:46:13] me want to shout all over this building
[1:46:15] we don't hold our destiny it's God that
[1:46:18] holds our destiny and he has ordained it
[1:46:20] to be so and there will nothing ever
[1:46:22] never interrupt the program of God for
[1:46:25] we are bound to
[1:46:27] arrive don't that make you feel good
[1:46:29] this morning amen just as much as that
[1:46:32] child would be bound to make it to give
[1:46:34] birth or or or or that Mary would make
[1:46:37] it to give birth you realize there was
[1:46:39] nothing from stop nothing that could
[1:46:40] stop her because she had an order from
[1:46:43] the King a real order whose orders are
[1:46:47] you following this
[1:46:48] morning think about it we give or
[1:46:51] everybody will give you orders Direction
[1:46:52] how you ought to do things that handling
[1:46:54] live anybody give you an order but what
[1:46:56] about the king's
[1:46:57] orders say she had an order from the
[1:47:00] King you say what king King
[1:47:03] Jesus king god king Holy Ghost he's the
[1:47:08] same one that's what he said to John he
[1:47:11] said I am the Alpha and the
[1:47:14] Omega the first and the last see it
[1:47:17] matters who gives the order where are we
[1:47:20] getting our orders from see a man I I
[1:47:23] could give you an order it may seem like
[1:47:25] an easy thing to do you might get down
[1:47:26] the road and not even be able to do it
[1:47:28] but let me tell you something about this
[1:47:29] King when he gives an order he'll always
[1:47:32] make a way for you to do it you may come
[1:47:35] to a place that seems completely
[1:47:37] impossible but because the king gave the
[1:47:40] order you know there's going to be a
[1:47:43] way the king gave the
[1:47:46] order if God called you think about it
[1:47:50] if he called you then he'll make a way
[1:47:52] for you to serve serve him that's he
[1:47:54] called you to be a Christian he's going
[1:47:55] to make a way he called you to be an
[1:47:57] overcomer then he'll make a way for you
[1:47:58] to
[1:47:59] overcome he called you to be a minister
[1:48:02] he'll make a way that you can be a
[1:48:04] minister if he called you to sing he'll
[1:48:06] make a way for you to sing he'll make a
[1:48:08] place why because the king gave the
[1:48:09] order and the King will make a way if he
[1:48:12] called you to be the leader of men he'll
[1:48:14] give you the men to lead over because
[1:48:16] the king will make a way he'll never
[1:48:18] give you an order that you can't perform
[1:48:20] he always provides a way isn't it
[1:48:22] something it's our destiny to arrive say
[1:48:25] and you're bound to
[1:48:26] arrive you're bound to arrive because
[1:48:29] our destiny came from the
[1:48:32] King you say where is this Kingdom today
[1:48:35] I'm seeking it I want to see
[1:48:38] it I want to be a part of it I I want to
[1:48:41] see the kingdom that Abraham had sought
[1:48:43] after let me tell you what Jesus said he
[1:48:45] said except a man be born again he
[1:48:47] cannot see the kingdom of
[1:48:49] God the very thing Abraham sought for he
[1:48:52] said if man ain't born again he cannot
[1:48:54] see it but listen if he would give that
[1:48:57] as a destiny I want to be in this
[1:48:59] Kingdom except a man be born again
[1:49:01] you'll never be in the kingdom of God
[1:49:03] this is the King's order I I really want
[1:49:05] to be a part of that I want to make my
[1:49:07] way in I I want to be saved I want to
[1:49:09] have eternal life except to me a man be
[1:49:11] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:49:13] God see that's the king's order but see
[1:49:17] there's something about this King
[1:49:18] remember he won't give an order that he
[1:49:20] don't make a way to perform see so if
[1:49:22] that's the king's order you had to be
[1:49:23] born again in order to see the kingdom
[1:49:26] of God well then he has to make a way
[1:49:28] for you to be born
[1:49:29] again isn't that what Jesus told
[1:49:31] Nicodemus he said how can a man be saved
[1:49:34] he said he said that he would he would
[1:49:36] have to be born again he would he would
[1:49:38] have to be he would have to be birthed
[1:49:40] and remember Nicodemus he didn't
[1:49:42] understand it but God gives an order and
[1:49:44] he gives a way to do it and matter of
[1:49:46] fact it is the mystery of what Jesus
[1:49:48] said he was he said I am the way the
[1:49:50] truth and the life and no man cometh
[1:49:52] under the father but my me that was a
[1:49:53] great mystery but Peter caught a
[1:49:56] revelation of that mystery of who Jesus
[1:49:58] was and when he caught a revelation he
[1:50:00] recognized the deity of Jesus and what
[1:50:02] did he do he said I give unto you the
[1:50:03] keys to the kingdom and Peter took those
[1:50:06] keys to that Kingdom and unlocked every
[1:50:08] door to every believer he unlocked the
[1:50:11] door to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:12] they said how do we get saved he said
[1:50:14] repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:50:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[1:50:18] the king gave an order and then the king
[1:50:20] provided away repent and be back baptize
[1:50:23] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost but
[1:50:25] said the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of
[1:50:27] God and by this way that God has made we
[1:50:30] are born into that Kingdom and we're
[1:50:32] subjects and delegates it's within us I
[1:50:36] think about it this morning you think
[1:50:38] with that key every door has been open
[1:50:40] to the
[1:50:41] believer every door every the door of
[1:50:44] healing it's been open to the believer
[1:50:47] here great men of God what did Jesus say
[1:50:49] what did the or what did the Bible say
[1:50:51] about your entance into the Kingdom of
[1:50:53] Heaven he said it was ministered unto
[1:50:56] you said what did Peter do he preached
[1:50:59] unto them and by the preaching the
[1:51:01] anointed preacher of the Gospel it
[1:51:03] opened the door into the kingdom of
[1:51:05] heaven or Heaven it opened way so every
[1:51:08] promise of God every door that's in this
[1:51:10] great kingdom do you realize that by
[1:51:12] these men that are anointed of God that
[1:51:14] the door has been unlocked to the
[1:51:15] believer so if you need healing this
[1:51:17] morning the door's been open to you if
[1:51:19] you need a Revival the door's been open
[1:51:21] to you if you need God to move on the on
[1:51:23] behalf of your children it don't matter
[1:51:25] you can't come to a door that hasn't
[1:51:27] been
[1:51:28] opened Satan wants to make it look like
[1:51:30] it's closed my children are going to be
[1:51:32] lost but let me tell you this is a
[1:51:35] Christmas
[1:51:36] message I don't think of a I can't think
[1:51:38] of a greater gift that God could give
[1:51:39] you than your own children it's the
[1:51:42] greatest gift that there have that you
[1:51:44] have and I know that many of you sitting
[1:51:47] here today you have loved ones that
[1:51:48] that's your wish in this time of
[1:51:51] Christmas that's the the gift that I'd
[1:51:53] like to receive but you realize let me
[1:51:55] tell you this morning that door is an

[1:52:09] church with them and set an extra Bible
[1:52:10] in the seat down beside them he said
[1:52:12] well what's that extra Bible for that's
[1:52:14] for my son or for my daughter one of
[1:52:16] these days they'll sit in that very seat
[1:52:18] why because that's our that's our desire
[1:52:21] and it's an Open Door
[1:52:23] maybe you've been troubled in your
[1:52:24] spirit or in your body been having some

[1:52:35] and in the middle of the preaching of
[1:52:36] the word there something come over me
[1:52:38] from the back of my back all the way
[1:52:40] across to the front of my head she said
[1:52:42] I never felt nothing like it and from
