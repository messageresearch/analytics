[43:03] visiting with if they Beyond we want to
[43:05] greet them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:07] Christ as well amen God's good isn't he
[43:11] Hebrews 11:1 says now Faith is a
[43:15] substance of things hoped for the
[43:17] evidence of Things Not Seen for by the
[43:20] elders obtained a good report through
[43:23] faith we understand the worlds refrained
[43:25] by the the word of God so the things
[43:27] which are seen were not made of things
[43:29] which do appear by faith Abel offered
[43:32] unto God a more excellent sacrifice then
[43:35] came by which he obtained witness that
[43:37] he was a righteous God testifying of his
[43:40] gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh
[43:43] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[43:47] should not see death and was not found
[43:49] because God had translated him for
[43:53] before his translation he had a
[43:55] testimony that he pleased God but
[43:58] without faith it is impossible to please
[44:01] him for he that come to God must believe
[44:04] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[44:06] them that disly seeks him amen God bless
[44:09] you just bow our hearts one more time
[44:12] tonight if you got a need just make it
[44:14] known to the author I believe he can
[44:16] minister to your needs through the
[44:18] ministering of the word tonight that's a
[44:20] that's a beauty of the gift that God
[44:22] places in a man's life that that can be
[44:25] operated by you and I tonight if you're
[44:27] willing to pull on the gift God's
[44:29] willing to answer and and minister to
[44:32] your need tonight God bless you let's
[44:33] pray Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for
[44:37] this opportunity tonight Lord to worship
[44:39] you one more time father and we come to
[44:41] your throne of mercy and Grace Lord and
[44:44] Lord we want to give you a special
[44:46] thanks for the outpouring of your spirit
[44:48] over the last few Services here our
[44:50] anniversary meetings Lord how that you
[44:52] showed up and showed out Lord you
[44:54] ministered to people's lives Lord L God
[44:56] and Lord we're here tonight Lord God
[44:58] expecting you to move One More Time Lord
[45:01] God and speak to each and every one of
[45:02] our hearts Lord we pray Lord God every
[45:04] hand that risen every heart that's
[45:06] needing tonight Lord we pray that you'll
[45:08] Minister through those needs Lord we ask
[45:10] you to bless the reading of your word
[45:12] and every word that would be spoken
[45:14] tonight Lord we commit this time into
[45:15] your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen
[45:19] amen God bless you you can
[45:24] have
[45:31] now Paul States here that in Hebrews
[45:35] that faith is a substance of things
[45:38] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[45:40] Seen and and then he goes on to say
[45:43] through this Faith this element of faith
[45:46] we understand that the world was framed
[45:50] by the word of God and I thought how
[45:52] powerful that is tonight that God had
[45:56] faith in his own word amen when he spoke
[45:59] it amen he wasn't questioning it he
[46:02] actually he's already seen it and he
[46:04] already seen it materializing and my he
[46:08] can speak by faith and faith is a
[46:10] revelation amen and faith is a
[46:13] revelation of the will of God in your
[46:15] life and faith unlocks and Faith sees
[46:17] and Faith hears and Faith understands
[46:20] and faith is Burly and my you can come
[46:23] through the message and and as the
[46:25] Propet of this age begin to tell us and
[46:27] Faith could see and Faith could hear and
[46:29] faith is a victory that overcomes the
[46:31] world and and then Hebrews would begin
[46:34] to tell us fa by faith Enoch by faith uh
[46:38] uh uh uh uh Abel by faith Noah by faith
[46:41] Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Rahab
[46:44] the Harlot by faith Moses and and they
[46:47] overcome by faith and he goes on and and
[46:49] then Paul makes a statement here and he
[46:51] says you know it's impossible to please
[46:55] God with without
[46:56] faith and I was thinking if it's
[46:59] impossible to please
[47:01] God without faith and it's
[47:05] impossible without faith things are
[47:10] impossible but on the other
[47:13] hand what will Faith
[47:16] do amen if you if you're a message
[47:20] listener tonight you can't hardly listen
[47:23] to a message that our Prophet preached
[47:25] amen don't elaborate on faith in some
[47:28] way because it's who we are we're moved
[47:31] by the faith of God Heen we're led by
[47:33] the faith of God we make Footprints by
[47:36] the faith of God Amen the believer is
[47:39] led by the spirit of God which is
[47:42] orchestrated by faith and the prophet of
[47:45] God would say a six
[47:48] sense so faith is the victory that
[47:51] overcomes the
[47:53] world mine and it releases if I had a
[47:57] title tonight is releasing the power
[47:59] amen Faith actually releases the power
[48:04] and I was thinking here a few months ago
[48:06] when I was preaching on those those
[48:08] lepers and and those lepers was coming
[48:10] to Jesus needing an answer needing some
[48:13] healing amen needed Deliverance they was
[48:16] well stricken and and sickness and their
[48:19] body was felling them amen they came to
[48:22] the master said thest thou son of David
[48:25] have mercy upon me and and G and God
[48:28] begin to move in their behalf and and
[48:30] all he was all he did Brother David was
[48:32] give him a
[48:34] word he said go show yourself to the
[48:39] priest and the scripture says as they
[48:43] went and then it goes on and says as
[48:46] they went it began to release a power to
[48:49] them that leprosy could not hold them
[48:52] any
[48:53] longer praise God
[48:56] amen so obedience to the Master's words
[48:59] released a power that hell couldn't
[49:04] handle Hallelujah and we realize tonight
[49:07] is we uh We've if we come through the
[49:11] Bible and and we can look at all the
[49:13] promises in the Bible brother Noah amen
[49:16] I believe that it's told that there's
[49:18] over what 8,000 different promises
[49:21] concerning the church and my there's
[49:24] promises laying down All Through the
[49:26] Bible and but what good would it be to
[49:30] be written on the pages if there wasn't
[49:32] a power that could release unto us the
[49:36] promises of God and make it not just a
[49:39] letter in a book but let it become a
[49:42] real reality in our lives and in our
[49:46] church
[49:47] services come on somebody amen we can
[49:50] release a a power if we have enough
[49:52] Faith tonight I believe there could be a
[49:55] power that's released in this Tabernacle
[49:57] tonight amen that that every demonic
[50:00] power of hell would feel
[50:03] uncomfortable as brother wayy was
[50:05] preaching here Friday night amen I
[50:07] believe there's a lot of demons that
[50:09] begin to feel uncomfortable amen as he
[50:12] begin to minister on just praising him
[50:15] amen listen friends I I don't care what
[50:17] the church down the road says about
[50:19] praising God Heen you take worship and
[50:22] praise out of the church you've got a
[50:24] dead assembly Heen listen friends if
[50:26] there's no praise and worship there's no
[50:29] moving right come on and we may get to
[50:33] that if time terries
[50:36] tonight we always got to throw that in
[50:39] you know the preacher once said you know
[50:41] and I got a watch here on my phone but I
[50:43] don't wear a watch he said you know what
[50:45] a watch means to a preacher absolutely
[50:50] nothing but we'll try to be mindful of
[50:52] it on Wednesday night for
[50:54] sure but but there's thousands of
[50:58] promises and even these lepers obedience
[51:03] to the word of God it changed their
[51:09] lives come on somebody it wasn't they
[51:12] didn't they didn't go to the Revival
[51:14] down the
[51:15] road they didn't have to wait on a
[51:17] special meeting
[51:19] somewhere they begin to cry we'll get to
[51:22] these things if you bear with me tonight
[51:24] they begin to cry cry unto the master
[51:27] and the master heard their cry and he
[51:30] just brother Ben he just simply gave
[51:32] them a word amen and they obeyed the
[51:35] word just like they did amen and my mind
[51:38] goes back just like they did that day in
[51:40] Egypt amen when the death angel was
[51:43] fixing a Passover that God ministered to
[51:46] the hearts of his Believers amen he
[51:48] dropped the word down there and told him
[51:50] amen apply the blood kill the innocent
[51:53] lamb and apply the Blood on the doorpost
[51:56] of your
[51:58] homes amen and when they begin to apply
[52:01] the blood according to the word of a
[52:05] king that night when the death angel was
[52:08] passing by amen listen friends he went
[52:11] into a lot of
[52:14] homes there was a lot of innocent kids
[52:17] that died that
[52:19] night Brother David but every
[52:23] home that appli the
[52:27] token on it released a
[52:31] power that hell could not entered into
[52:34] that
[52:35] home I say if he's the same God
[52:38] yesterday he's a still the same God here
[52:42] tonight and if we'll be obedient to the
[52:45] word of
[52:47] God and we apply the token the life of
[52:51] Jesus
[52:53] Christ my when that Death Angel passed
[52:57] by he might have tried everything
[52:59] Brother David he could do to get into
[53:02] that home but that home was
[53:05] sealed there was peace in the
[53:08] home there was Revival in the
[53:11] home I say there's Revival in the
[53:15] home I believe there's a Revival in our
[53:18] this house too amen it's a bubbling
[53:22] tonight you love the Lord Mark 9 and 23
[53:26] says Jesus said unto him if thou C
[53:30] believe all can you say all withen
[53:33] tonight all things are possible to him
[53:37] that believeth so there's no limit to
[53:39] what God can do tonight if we will
[53:45] believe so God brother B said God will
[53:50] bless he said but the blessing sister
[53:52] Tammy has got to come under under
[53:55] certain circumstances or requirements
[53:59] certain requirements that you must meet
[54:01] we've always heard the the the the the
[54:04] slogan you know amen if one person gets
[54:07] healed if the next person could ever
[54:09] come under that same place or that same
[54:12] meet God with that same requirement
[54:15] right that he's he was God and he's
[54:18] faithful church we we're many times
[54:21] we're not faithful but we serve a god
[54:23] that is very faithful
[54:25] he's faithful to his
[54:28] word listen friends he's faithful to
[54:31] this
[54:34] message
[54:37] my and he goes on he said if you don't
[54:39] meet those requirements then the
[54:41] blessings or the promise of God is none
[54:45] effect to you anywhere that you meet
[54:49] God's requirements that's where you're
[54:52] healed the power he goes he say says
[54:55] then the power that will rais us up is
[54:57] right in us now how many believes that
[55:01] how many really believes that tonight
[55:03] the power that raised us up is right in
[55:06] us now we are now in Heavenly places we
[55:10] are now in the power of Resurrection if
[55:14] there wasn't a law to that Sons and
[55:16] Daughters would create a world out here
[55:18] and go live on a private life on it you
[55:21] have the power in you to do it brother
[55:24] ch got a shadow the power of God in you
[55:28] you got power to do it he says God's
[55:30] omnipotent see he says see what I mean
[55:34] the power that's in you he said you
[55:36] could speak a world into existence and
[55:38] go live on it he says hallelujah he says
[55:41] there you are that's what the power is
[55:44] in the church now but it's controlled by
[55:46] a
[55:47] law and that law is he said that law is
[55:51] not keeping a bunch of Commandments he
[55:54] simply says
[55:55] it's the loss is a joice of
[55:58] Faith Jesus said all things are possible
[56:02] that them that
[56:04] believe and if you can believe it
[56:07] whatever God would lead your soul to
[56:09] believe he says that is
[56:12] yours every place The Souls of your your
[56:16] foot can set upon by faith God gives it
[56:21] to you right there's a law when a
[56:23] Believer takes the step of
[56:26] faith it releases a power that leprosy
[56:30] can't
[56:31] handle amen so when there's a there's a
[56:35] law and then whenever a person meet that
[56:39] law my it releases a power it releases
[56:48] Heaven just like it did to those 10
[56:51] lepers that received their healing as
[56:53] they went to meet the
[56:55] priest he says amen it's yours you
[56:59] possess it if you can find the key to
[57:03] this law of faith it opens up to you he
[57:06] says see what I mean the power is
[57:09] controlled by it if you're a Son of God
[57:12] you're a daughter of God it that listen
[57:15] this that never leaves
[57:18] you oh isn't that good
[57:21] tonight that never leaves you it's with
[57:25] you all the
[57:27] time but your faith is away from it but
[57:31] it's still
[57:33] there says hallelujah no matter where
[57:36] you are
[57:37] tonight amen just like brother Brown
[57:40] said I quoted in my after my prayer
[57:42] brother Matt that line run loose for a
[57:44] season but it was always there job was
[57:48] tied to his absolute but he said it was
[57:51] running loose sometimes we get to that
[57:54] place ch church amen it runs loose in
[57:56] our lives brother the prophetic gift in
[57:58] this hour says Sister Janice it never
[58:01] left you it was always with you it was
[58:04] always by your side it was there all the
[58:09] time
[58:12] Hallelujah he says when you are saved
[58:15] God gives you the faith same quote to
[58:18] rise from the muck of the earth your
[58:21] faith overcomes the things of the world
[58:23] he said what is your Faith your faith is
[58:26] the act that God had did in you to make
[58:28] you a Son of God you quit your lion you
[58:32] quit your stealing you quit your
[58:34] drinking you quit your doping you quit
[58:36] your
[58:39] smoking
[58:40] Hallelujah my that brings a
[58:43] freedom a freedom to worship a freedom
[58:47] to praise him tonight I come to church
[58:49] tonight for one reason to praise my God
[58:53] the move is on Satan keeps padding
[58:56] things in our
[58:59] lives but we as a Believer just keep on
[59:02] keeping
[59:03] on and no matter what comes our way
[59:07] we're willing to praise the god tonight
[59:09] we're willing to let go of our feelings
[59:12] we're really we're will to let go of
[59:14] things that that so easily beset us
[59:16] tonight things that keeps our spirit
[59:19] troubled things that keep us down a
[59:21] little bit things that keeps the little
[59:23] differences between the brother and
[59:25] sisters amen we're willing tonight to
[59:27] let those feelings
[59:29] go cuz if we would ever realize it is
[59:32] not your brother it's not your sister
[59:35] but it's only a demonic power of hell
[59:38] that's trying to break unity in a body
[59:41] of
[59:42] Believers no matter how much you dislike
[59:45] somebody's
[59:47] dominor maybe they don't act the way
[59:49] that you act this is free brother man
[59:51] this is your job no matter how they act
[59:55] you know what me and Matt brother Matt
[59:57] we hang out a lot we maybe go to places
[1:00:00] a lot but just because I like pretzels
[1:00:03] doesn't mean that Matt likes
[1:00:06] pretzels there's some things brother
[1:00:08] Matt don't like that I do and there's
[1:00:10] some things I probably don't like about
[1:00:12] brother Matt I had found one yet but
[1:00:13] I'll find one
[1:00:16] eventually but no matter what we we as
[1:00:19] brothers and sisters in a church body
[1:00:23] will have to come to grip
[1:00:25] we're realizing we are individuals and
[1:00:29] we're trapped in
[1:00:31] mortality and we we all got our own

[1:03:43] promise are you hearing me tonight
[1:03:45] brother John that whip that setting on
[1:03:48] your

[1:03:52] don't need your whip he said your wh
[1:03:54] whip that is standing by your side can
[1:03:58] take you brother Cody to every promise
[1:04:01] in the
[1:04:05] book Mark
[1:04:09] 5 Mark
[1:04:17] 523 is that my grandson praising the
[1:04:19] Lord back
[1:04:23] there something like
[1:04:26] that and besought him greatly saying my
[1:04:30] little daughter layeth at the point of
[1:04:32] death I pray thee come lay hands on her
[1:04:36] that she may be healed and she shall
[1:04:38] live and Jesus went with him and much
[1:04:40] people followed him and thronged him and
[1:04:44] a certain woman which had an issue of
[1:04:47] blood for 12 years and has suffered many
[1:04:50] things from many Physicians spent all
[1:04:54] the that she had listen and was not none
[1:04:57] better but rather grew
[1:05:01] worse now we realize that probably God
[1:05:04] would tell us that this lady lived on a
[1:05:07] hill up
[1:05:08] there and I ain't got that in my notes
[1:05:10] but he said he would go begin to tell us
[1:05:12] that sister Tammy that she could even
[1:05:14] walk she didn't have a strength to carry
[1:05:18] on but she heard Jesus was passing
[1:05:23] by
[1:05:24] my brother ra said that lady you know 12
[1:05:28] years with a blood issue had no energy
[1:05:31] had no strength she couldn't even hardly
[1:05:34] walk without somebody helping her made
[1:05:36] her way off the top of that mountain
[1:05:38] crawling down to
[1:05:44] Jesus she's been through a
[1:05:47] lot she spent all of her
[1:05:50] money and she only got
[1:05:53] worse
[1:05:55] but when she heard of Jesus coming she
[1:05:59] pressed through every trial everybody
[1:06:03] tell him there's no hope for her
[1:06:05] everybody tell him there's no way you
[1:06:06] can get to Jesus there's no way you
[1:06:09] could stop him tonight you've got too
[1:06:11] bad of a pastor ever stop Jesus but she
[1:06:14] had one thing on her mind if I can only
[1:06:17] touch but the HM of His Garment right
[1:06:21] come on and that hym just dangled off of
[1:06:23] his
[1:06:24] garment see and maybe Jesus sister
[1:06:28] Destiny maybe Jesus could even naturally
[1:06:31] feel
[1:06:33] it that
[1:06:35] woman brother Travis maybe spent hours
[1:06:39] hours on top of hours coming down that
[1:06:42] Hillside to make her way to Jesus she
[1:06:45] crossed a lot of Rocky places and Shop
[1:06:48] rocks and logs and traps of hell every
[1:06:52] demonic power and amen was trying to
[1:06:54] stop this visitation every demon the
[1:06:58] Demonic power of hell was trying to stop
[1:07:00] this predestinated moment of
[1:07:04] time remember he was trying to stop
[1:07:06] Sarah
[1:07:08] visitation brother I don't know how he
[1:07:10] knew it but she was he was trying to
[1:07:12] stop it and no doubt everything he could
[1:07:16] do to throw in her way he was trying to
[1:07:19] stop her from receiving her healing Heen
[1:07:22] she Hey listen the
[1:07:24] the devil didn't care for going to the
[1:07:27] doctors but she he didn't he had a real
[1:07:30] problem with her getting to
[1:07:35] Jesus
[1:07:38] amen for she said I must touch brother's
[1:07:42] clothes and I shall be
[1:07:45] whole and straight way the fountain her
[1:07:49] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[1:07:53] body body that she was healed of that
[1:07:57] plague glory and Jesus immediately
[1:08:01] knowing in himself listen friends she
[1:08:03] was healed even before she heard her
[1:08:05] words of
[1:08:07] Jesus Amen then G it stopped Jesus in
[1:08:10] IMM knowing in himself that virtue had
[1:08:14] gone out of him turned him about in the
[1:08:17] press and said who touched my
[1:08:21] clothes and the disciples said to him
[1:08:23] thou the multitude they're all touching
[1:08:26] you they're all reaching out to
[1:08:29] you what do you mean who touched me and
[1:08:33] he looked around about to see her that
[1:08:35] has done this thing but the woman
[1:08:37] fearing and tremoring knowing that was
[1:08:39] done into her came and fell down before
[1:08:41] him and told him all the truth and he
[1:08:43] said unto her
[1:08:45] daughter thy
[1:08:47] faith thy faith released the power to
[1:08:52] heal your body
[1:08:54] hallelujah amen your faith what faith
[1:08:58] conquering Satan's traps right
[1:09:01] Conquering the the ability that she said
[1:09:05] there's no way I can make it it was her
[1:09:08] faith that she took a step past the
[1:09:11] negativity of the church negativity of
[1:09:13] the doctors negativity of her mind
[1:09:17] negativity of her
[1:09:20] body and made her way to the foot of
[1:09:25] Jesus and just simply church as you can
[1:09:29] do tonight just simply she wasn't making
[1:09:33] a fuss she wasn't making a stew she
[1:09:35] didn't need anybody's attention she just
[1:09:38] simply by faith the whole journey was by
[1:09:44] faith the whole journey was of faith and
[1:09:47] when she reached up and touched the
[1:09:50] Garment by faith it released heaven
[1:09:54] brother R would picked that up he said
[1:09:56] like the woman with the blood issue all
[1:09:59] the people passing by all of them
[1:10:02] standing up saying there goes Rabbi
[1:10:05] that's a guy that claims to be a Prophet
[1:10:07] this is fanatic and all such as that but
[1:10:09] what happened this little woman had an
[1:10:12] issue of blood and she had heard about
[1:10:14] him and when she came down there
[1:10:16] regardless of what anybody would say she
[1:10:18] recognized Who the Master was and said
[1:10:21] if I can only touch His Garment
[1:10:25] and when that genuine faith in God
[1:10:28] became a positive thing to her what did
[1:10:31] it release he said it released his power
[1:10:36] to
[1:10:37] heal she fought through many
[1:10:40] things no I'm not giving up come on
[1:10:45] Church many time brother Cody she got to
[1:10:48] a place her energy was all gone maybe
[1:10:51] her knees was bleeding from all the
[1:10:53] Rocks brother the mark she was she was
[1:10:55] fighting with the the infirmity in her
[1:10:57] body of weakness and loss of strength
[1:11:01] she was skin and
[1:11:04] bones but there was just something
[1:11:06] inside of her says don't give up keep
[1:11:10] pressing the
[1:11:12] battle amen what was it the same quote I
[1:11:15] read to you he said many times you don't
[1:11:17] feel it but he's never left
[1:11:19] you and she felt like she was deserted
[1:11:22] on her journey down to Jesus but there
[1:11:25] was a there was
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:27] anointing man I I believe this I it was
[1:11:31] a coincidence that Jesus was passing by
[1:11:33] her way but before the foundation of the
[1:11:36] world God seen her
[1:11:40] delivered I say he's a save God here
[1:11:46] tonight Hallelujah if we could just

[1:51:18] appreciates brother Joe and pouring his
[1:51:20] heart out tonight I thought that was
[1:51:22] good releasing the power of God what
[1:51:25] releases the power of God in your life
[1:51:27] Faith releases the power of God praising
[1:51:30] God releases releases the power of God
[1:51:33] spiritual worship releases the power of
[1:51:35] God isn't it something to release God's
[1:51:38] power in your life there's ways to
[1:51:40] release his power the potential is there
[1:51:42] but we just have to release it in our
[1:51:44] life that just makes me feel good
[1:51:45] tonight you realize brother Mark people
[1:51:47] worship all over the world and they
[1:51:48] don't get nothing from God that's right
[1:51:50] you know just worship ain't what it
[1:51:52] ain't just spiritual worship that gets
[1:51:55] makes you closer to God or ain't just
[1:51:57] spiritual worship that does it but it's
[1:51:59] knowing what you worship one one person
[1:52:02] they can praise and shout and dance all
[1:52:04] over and it won't get nothing no never
[1:52:06] get any closer to God but when you know
[1:52:08] who it is that you
[1:52:10] worship it opens up a power that there
[1:52:13] ain't the devil can't take away when you
[1:52:15] know who it is brother B say that's what
[1:52:17] the problem with these people are today
[1:52:19] he said that don't believe believe in
[1:52:20] the power of God or the power of healing
[1:52:22] is because they don't have a real father
[1:52:24] they don't know who their real father is
[1:52:26] but I thank God I have a real father
[1:52:28] that when I worship I I'm not just
[1:52:29] making noise I'm talking to the god that
[1:52:31] created me whenever we come to church
[1:52:33] and you lift your hand and praise God I
[1:52:35] don't I don't believe in a quiet church
[1:52:37] I don't I just don't believe in it I I
[1:52:39] can't find a place in the Bible where
[1:52:40] Jesus came present that nobody made any
[1:52:42] noise I believe that we ought to be able
[1:52:44] to worship God there's some life in us
[1:52:46] there's some emotion in us they call it
[1:52:48] an emotion it is an emot emotion but
[1:52:50] it's an emotion that has been caused by
[1:52:52] something on the inside of it it's a
[1:52:54] Sanctified life that's been changed by
[1:52:56] God that makes an emotion come out of
[1:52:57] this old dead corrupted old Corporal
[1:52:59] body and causes me to worship my God
[1:53:02] he's a wonderful God I know who my
[1:53:04] father is therefore I worship him I make
[1:53:06] it known but Joe said Till the devil
[1:53:08] knows that he said devil just stick
