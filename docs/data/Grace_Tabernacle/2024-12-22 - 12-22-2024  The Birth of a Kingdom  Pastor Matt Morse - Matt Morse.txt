his growth and keeping me and and we just certainly love the Lord this morning amen do you love him amen and we just uh just want to come and bring the word of God and bring a a Christmas message to you and uh this is that uh time of year and certainly a time of remembrance for us as Believers but we just want to invite you to the book of Hebrews and we'll read out of the 11th chapter and uh and we'll start there in the eth verse and uh we'll just uh give you a moment to uh to find that that place Hebrews 11th chapter and the 8th verse we want to welcome our visitors here this morning trust something would be said that would be a blessing to you this morning and we certainly appreciate the uh the those that have been coming and just seems like you know somebody told me the other day this only church I ever been to that had a new congregation every week and I said well that's the signs of a growing Church there always always new faces and we just we just love to be an Outreach and uh to be a a light in this place and in this time and so I believe that God has given us the opportunity to be that all right so uh how many love the Lord amen you love his word amen let's read it together Hebrews 11th chapter and the 8 verse the Bible says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance he obeyed and he went out that's that's quite a lesson right there isn't it when he was called To The Lord he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went but by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God and I also want to read out of the book of Isaiah and I'll read from the seventh chapter in one verse of scripture very familiar especially this time of the year but out of the 14th verse the Bible says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and I'd like to speak this morning as you take your seats on the birth of a kingdom uh here a few uh months ago we had been speaking on a kingdom series and this just kind of had came on my heart and uh and for this for this time to be able to minister it uh certainly in this time of year I I I I I I appreciate the uh you know this this time of the time of the birth of Jesus and the time of Christmas and uh you know I've always uh always thought there's it doesn't matter what time it is there's those that can do good with it and those that can do bad with it and uh I certainly appreciate it I believe that God has given us many great gifts and uh this is a time to be able to remember that and reflect on the things that God has done for us you know the Lord uh just kind of spoke something to my heart the other day and and we were brother DAV and sister Eve he was having his birthday and they invited us over to uh to have dinner uh there with them and and at the end of the at the end of the dinner we got up to leave and I said brother Dave I just want to wish you a happy birthday and and certainly I appreciate everything you do I love you and God bless you and he said well brother Matt I appreciate that thank you thank you for that and and uh started to walk out and sister Eve she said well you know today's not his birthday his birthday is not uh for another few days and I thought as I said well well that's that's wonderful and I thought as I was walking out I didn't say nothing to nobody I thought you know isn't it odd that today wasn't really his birthday but whenever I gave him praise he accepted it and when I told him I appreciated him he accepted it and and I told him how much he meant to me and he accepted I thought that's the way it is with our Lord we we may not know what day he was born on or what uh no man really knows the day we know we know it wasn't in the in the winter time of the year but whatever day that you choose to worship God and uh for the gift that God has given us God will accept the worship and he will accept the praise and and uh I think that's the way we ought to be this morning we ought to make uh uh uh something uh mean or get some mean Spirit towards people that want to Worship the Lord and but we ought to make it a time of worship amen and so that's what it means to us as a Believer you know what you know that I know people people get this all twisted up sometimes but uh you know what it means to be a light in the time of Darkness many men have taken that and and said well Darkness was Christmas but Christmas is never a time of Darkness but if there wasn't a Christmas we'd never have a resurrection if there wasn't a Christmas we'd never there had never been a crucifiction there would never be salvation so there had to come a Christmas and there you know there had to come that time and so uh Christmas was not the time of Darkness the time of Darkness was paganism surrounding this time of year and so uh it is our purpose purp to be a light in the time of Darkness isn't it something so if the world is going to make this a dark time this is when we should shine our light this is when you say well I'm going to wait till I'm going to wait until Easter and then I'm going to shine my light but in the time of Darkness let your light shine and uh let let the world know what it is all about amen we have uh we certainly have been given a great gift in this hour how many believe that amen we so we just want to keep a a good spirit about it I just think God is wonderful and but I want to take a moment this morning to speak on the birth of a kingdom and uh I I feel like there's such a wonderful connection here between these two scriptures and of course we know that through the Bible that Abraham and Isaiah that they lived over a thousand years uh apart from the time of their life but uh but we also can see that the prophecy of Isaiah he would actually carry on the purpose that Abraham had and you remember the story of Abraham each one of us have read it and preached on it many times but uh you remember as God had came to Abraham and he called him away from his family and his and his uh and and his people and he said go into a land that I will show you and the Bible would tell us in Hebrews the 11th chapter that that Abraham obeyed God and he began to go and and he traveled and he sojourned into a Strange Land and he went out into a place that he would receive for an inheritance and and as you would go to this place it would be to a strange country it was a place that Abraham knew nothing of but the Bible says but by faith he walked out and and by faith he he followed the Lord and he went to this place that God would call him to and and and his purpose is that he looked for a city that had foundations whose Builder and maker was God see Abraham was a special kind of a Believer he was the kind of believer that had faith that when God said something was out there even though that he couldn't see it that he believed that it was out there even though he may have not could have touched it but he believed it was out there he may uh he may have not none of his natural senses would be able to identify this city but the Bible says but he went by faith and here here we find him in the chapter of Hebrews in the chap that would depict The Heroes of Faith throughout the Bible and Abraham was was said to be one of the great Heroes of Faith because he believed God and he called things that as they were even though they were not to the natural eye and so Abraham being a man as he went out and he searched for this place that do you realize that Abraham that he searched for the very thing that we are looking for today that with his with that with his natural eye he went out searching for this thing for Jesus would say he said we are not of this world they are not of this world even even as I am not of this world so here we are in this world just like Abraham was in this world but brother Mark he separated himself from the things of the world and he walked into a strange country and he professed himself to be a pilgrim and a stranger he said I don't belong in this place I'm a pilgrim and a stranger I come from another place and I'm I'm looking for it this morning I I've started my journey i' I've made a connection with some other with some other Kingdom and I'm and I'm going out searching for it for the Bible said he was looking for a city he wandered through the deserts he went through the Wilderness he was looking for a city he was watching for it day and night and brother bam said that we today as Believers every Seed of Abraham we're doing the same thing that Abraham done we've laid aside every weight we profess that we are pilgrims and strangers how many can make that profession this morning we're not church members but we're pilgrims and strangers we're we're not we're not just members of some group or something but we're pilgrims and strangers we're not of this world because we're pilgrims and strangers we don't act like the world because we're pilgrims and strangers we you know some things as as a body of Believers we do things that is odd to the rest of the world you ever thought about it you you're a people that walk around reading your Bible it may seem odd to the world we pray to a we pray to a god that the world can't see it may seem odd to the world we come to church we sing song to a god that the world can't see we lift our hands we bow down our faces and we worship Him and and we give him glory and we praise him and we say amen and Hal Hallelujah and there's something in us that causes us to worship a god it may seem odd to the world but it's because we're not of this world but we're pilgrims and strangers and we're seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God he said what we're looking for is we're looking for a kingdom that's to come how many believe that say Amen we're looking for a kingdom you realize Abraham he looked for this same Kingdom he was looking for a spirit or very natural Kingdom and I I thought isn't it something that through the life of Abraham I'll take just a minute on this but through the life of Abraham in his natural lineage they have always looked for this Kingdom that Abraham spoke of all the way back in the Book of Genesis they they've looked for it Israel has longed to see the ushering end of this kingdom do you realize today that they still look for this Kingdom they look they look for the rise and uh through or or or through the rise and the fall of many great kingdoms they look for this one to come through the changes of regime from from King to Queen to Monarch unto unto the prime minister to the cabinet that they have today they have awaited the coming of a king and a savior I thought but here here they had awaited all of this time and through all these Thousand Years had gone by they had been waiting for what Abraham had spoke of and waiting for God to lead them out of out of the these periods that they had gone through in periods of failure and and turmoil and wars and all these things but they're waiting for one that that would come that would deliver them from all of this and so here we we find oursel in the time of of Isaiah do you realize when Isaiah would prophesy it was during one of the darkest periods in Israel's history and in this period you realize that Israel was actually preparing for an invasion and here here they were they were troubled and and King ahaz he was he was uh so troubled he was looking at the face of captivity and and and they were looking at a coalition an army that had built up in the northern part of Israel that would come uh to destroy this great nation and and the Bible would tell us the story of how that Syria and Ephraim and how they they had built this Army and the and and Ralia the they they had came to to bring evil against Judah and the Bible said that they had purposed in their heart that they would come into Judah and they would take over this place and and they would they would Outcast the king of Judah and they would put him away and they said Well what we'll do is we'll go in we'll take over this land and when we take it over we'll put a king in his place so here they had purposed in their heart that they would take out the king that God had established or this nation that God had established and they would raise up their own King and they would set him in this place and so it was during this time that Isaiah would come and he would prophesy to the king ahaz and of course here in this very troubled time that Isaiah would begin to speak he said that nations would fall and God will come and God will be a God to you and you will see the greatness of God and and the Bible says and moreover the Lord spoke again to ahaz and here he would begin to show show all the things that God was going to do for him he says but the Lord spake to ahaz I thought here here here is a good lesson because when ahaz heard Isaiah speak he didn't take it as a word from God he took it as a word from Isaiah I thought many people make that mistake today is they'll hear a man speak and say well there was just a man watch watch ahaz his response or he's just a a prophet he's not my Prophet he's the people's Prophet they're the one that made him there but I'm not going to accept accept him as that so to ahaz he was just a man but I thought you know how is that although it was just the voice of a man but we got to be careful not to dismiss the voice of a man because sometimes it may seem as the voice of a man but it's actually a word from the Lord and so here the Bible says the Lord spoke to ahaz so it wasn't Isaiah speaking to ahaz it was through the mouth of Isaiah but the Lord spoke to ahaz and when he he spoke to him he said he he Isaiah said ask the Lord for a sign I want you to notice the answer that ahaz gave here they were in such a trouble that the the war was about to take place there was a a great enemy on the northern border they were coming in he needed help they needed defense they needed somebody to stand with them somebody to stand by their side they needed they needed the ability the strength to be able to fight this enemy and Isaiah said ask the Lord for a sign that he's going to deliver you ask the Lord for a sign that he'll be able to defend you and and the Bible says but ahaz answered and he said I will not ask and neither will I tempt the Lord you know from the outside it looks like that it might have been a good answer well how can I tempt the Lord God this is ahaz the great king ahaz this answer he said I shall not tempt the Lord I w't I certainly won't temp the Lord you know to us it may look like a good answer but without knowing the heart of ahaz you wouldn't know what it really meant see because ahaz according to the history we find out that here what Isaiah was offering him he was telling him as he was sent by God he was showing a sign that would reassure him that God would protect Judah in this great battle he said ask God for a sign that that that that he would he would protect you but but ahaz he refused to ask for a sign and what he was actually showing is that that he didn't have the faith that God was able to perform what what what Isaiah was saying so he couldn't take the word of Isaiah he didn't have the faith that God could perform it and and after all if God did perform it and he did rely on God and he did he did hear the sign that Isaiah would bring that then he would have to be forced to follow Jehovah and that means he would have to be forced to to turn away from the world and ahaz was a man that was drawn to the world he was a man that had been to Assyria many times he had he had great friendships in Assyria this great nation and and and and and he loved the things the way that Assyria was ran he loved the nation he Lov the great part about it he loved their military he even went to some of their church services and he thought my isn't it quite nice and you know he he actually loved this and here here as he would show this that his heart was to was to follow after Assyria and here Isaiah would come he said don't follow after Assyria but turn to God don't put your trust in Assyria but put your trust in God and then Isaiah as he as he begin to speak it you notice he would say to him he said here now oh House of David he said is it a small thing to weary men but will you not weary God also in other words that you would rely on men but you wouldn't rely on God you don't it don't trouble you to go to the king and ask the Assyrian King for hell but it troubles you to go to God and ask God for help and here oh my what a message as you begin to speak to him but notice the Bible says but a has refused to hear the sign but because he refused to hear the sign notice what God's going to do he gave him a sign anyway he said I I'm not going to ask for it I refuse to hear it but Isaiah said but therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel I thought isn't it something that hear the king said I don't want to hear the sign but God said I'm going to give the sign anyway because I got another purpose for it so just because the king said I don't want to hear it I I don't want it spoken and I don't want it written down but God had a purpose for the sign that would be spoken from the mouth of Isaiah even though he may not have had a good platform to speak it but still yet Isaiah came and he spoke the word of the Lord behold the Lord himself shall give you a sign you realize that this prophecy that Isaiah made it was about a future child that would come to the world that would bring righteousness and he he would rule forever and this child he would be a descendant of King David he would be the Messiah the anointed one he would be Christ the king and the savior of the world and you realize that ahaz he didn't want another leader he didn't want another king he didn't he didn't want a savior he he he he was a he was a man that was in his 20s and and in his age he was an arrogant King and he didn't want to have that kind of relationship with God but history would tell us that ahaz he rejected the sign and he accepted the Assyrian army instead I thought ma what what a way it was you realize that what ah has done is whenever he had went to this place that he allowed a Syria to come into His nation and to be his friend he allowed him to come and to set up strongholds in the land in the land of Judah he allowed them to bring their army in and to set up a defense so they could defend Israel and let me tell you what happened the Bible would tell us through history uh that that that that ain't all that ahaz has done he as they begin to bring their army in and they set up to defend and they set up these strongholds that also that ahaz went over into into the land of Assyria and he went to the the temple and he said you you know what I like what they do in their Temple and M they have quite a nice altar over there so he said went back to Israel he said let's build an altar like they got in Assyria and let's put it in the house of God you know I like the way they worship so let's worship like they did over in Assyria in the house of God but do you realize that God don't want us worshiping like somebody else he don't want us copying after somebody else or something that you came out of or some old old church or something or some religion but he said but but he came and he established this in the in the kingdom of God but you realize what the Bible would tell us within 10 years that Assyria no not only did they drive out all the enemy and they used the the the the the uh uh the unity of Israel the union with Israel to destroy any threat of an oncoming enemy but the Bible says that after they had drove out the enemy and after or Israel was established again or Judah as this great nation then Assyria turned on the people that allowed them in and they begin to take over the lands of Judah that that they were already in and the Bible tells us that after a little while that they own that land too so here ahaz had allowed them in in just a few years the Israel was under bondage they were they were their temples were filled with the worship of the Assyrian people because he wouldn't see the sign of God and the world had came in Assyria had came in it took over his kingdom and it took the life of a king and the people were so disappointed with the decisions that ahaz made that they wouldn't even bury him in the Tomb of the Kings but they buried him off out in the field somewhere because he had failed to see the sign that God has sent I thought my is't that the way it is he rejected the sign that God sent and accepted the world I think that's the way it is today there's too many people in trouble because they reject the sign that God sent and they accept the world in instead that's what Isaiah said he said behold the Lord himself shall send you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel see it was God's sign oh friends I want you glad this morning that God don't judge the whole world by the decision of one man what makes me want to shout this morning I'm so thankful that God don't judge all of us because of the decision of one man there may be a man that would reject the sign and accept the world but I think God that he still gives us an opportunity this morning to accept the sign that God has given every one of us had the same opportunity said he shall call his name Emanuel how many knows the meaning of that great name when you read Emmanuel in the Hebrew it's a compound word the word I am which is with the word an you which is us and the word L which is God the angel of Lord of course when Mary would meet him the Bible says in Matthew the first chapter Behold a virgin shall be with a child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which means God With Us amen ain't that a wonderful thing to think about God With Us can we think about that just a minute this morning a god that is with us do you realize that this is God's desire from the beginning when God made man and he and he created man in the beginning the Bible says God made man in his own image and here that God was so pleased with the man that he had created and he went down into the ground and brother Wesley out of the the dust of the ground the Bible said he formed the Flesh of Adam even the and and he called his name Adam even the name Adam it means son of the earth and so here as Adam would come uh to be and here Eve and they would go in the garden they would would go through the time of the fall in the garden the Bible would tell us that all of creation was lost because of the fall in the garden and here God wanted to be a god with his children he wanted to have communion and have the fellowship with him but because the human race was in a fallen condition you realize that God being the kind of God that he is God just couldn't leave it there that's the way he is with every one of us that sometimes we find oursel in a fallen condition but God can't leave in there it's not his nature says so he couldn't leave it in that place so in the mind of God he be to plan for a that he could bring Deliverance to the world and that a sacrifice that that he can make that would be a worthy sacrifice that would meet the requirements of the law that would meet God's standard and it would provide a true atonement for the sin of man this is what was taking place in the mind of God let me tell you what God done he didn't just leave it in his mind brother Wesley but he wanted to make a way that he could redeem a fallen man he wanted to bring something to the Earth that would restore that that had been broken how they had become alienated from God that God wanted to make a way that he could bring it back together aren't you glad that God is a god of restoration and he he's a god of redemption and so because God had it in his mind he couldn't just leave it in his mind but then he begin to speak it you say well how did God speak it he took his prophets and begin to anoint them with a word from the Lord and the Bible says through history we see the mind of God being able to be displayed through the mouth of the prophecy and we find over in Isaiah the nth chapter Isaiah said For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful and counselor the Mighty God and the Everlasting father the prince of peace and of the increase of his government in peace there shall be no end glory and of the increase of his government and of peace that shall be no end in other words it'll continue to grow it'll never be destroyed it'll never be turned down or cast down or beat down but upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it he will establish it with judgment and with Justice and henceforth forever more and the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this so Isaiah begins to talk about what God is going to do and how that a child would be born and then we find the prophet Mah as he would pick it up he said and he this child you said where would he be born he said out of Bethlehem uh there would be one that would be born that would be the ruler of Israel whose goings forth have been from old and otherwise he didn't just come as a thought today but it came from out of the mind of God he he's been going since the beginning of creation and and from Bethlehem would be born a child that came all the way back out of the mind of God from the very beginning Nebuchadnezzar 150 years later has a dream of this great image of of gold and brass and iron and Clay remember the story we' preached on it many times but he calls upon Daniel the Prophet and Daniel begins to interpret his dream he said here he said oh he said what will happen he said is that that as you build up this Kingdom every Kingdom after you will be a worse Kingdom but it's going to come a time that out of the mountain would come a stone and it was track the foot of this great image and it would be destroyed he said and at that time the Lord himself at the time of these Kings the god of heaven will set up his own kingdom and his kingdom will never be destroyed Prophet after Prophet begin to prophesy of the coming of the kingdom of God he said and then the kingdom I love this part he said can we just preach it a minute he said the king om shall not be left to other people but it'll break in pieces and consume all of these kingdoms and it shall stand forever that means that God is going to establish a kingdom on this Earth and it ain't going to be left to the hands of men it ain't going to be left to the failures of men or the misleading or the misguiding where people could take this part and this part away from you he said but God is going to come in the end and he's going to establish a kingdom upon the Earth and that Kingdom it'll never fall it'll never be destroyed there ain't no man that can tamper with it that can take it away from the people of God but it was given to them by God and they're ordained of God to be able to receive it it'll stand forever but then there come a time for that Kingdom to come present on the earth I think about this this morning that here you realize what a kingdom is God has prophesying a becoming Kingdom but a kingdom by definition is a territory that is ruled by a monarchy so in other words let me say it like this that you can't have a kingdom without not a king or a queen there has to be a monarchy so if God is going to bring a kingdom then there first had to be a king otherwise it was just a group of people so see here he's prophesying of this coming Kingdom says so if God is going to establish a kingdom then the first thing he'd have to do is to bring forth a king and under that King and then maybe it'd be one subject and then two subjects and three subjects but as the subjects would begin to grow the kingdom of God grew upon the Earth I thought watch this great spiritual Kingdom at the birth of Jesus that the kingdom of heaven was born upon the Earth this is this is what Jesus brought to the Earth here and do you realize that it wasn't after he got to a certain age let me just say this I know it debunks some theologians but Jesus was born as a king he was born as a king he was born as a ruler he was born as a savior he didn't work his way to become a savior he was born a savior he was born a deliverer he was born a Healer even at the time of his birth he was all of that God's gift to the Earth even the name that he was given the angel said you should call his name Jesus or call his name what what did the angel say you shall call his name Yeshua which meant a Lord that saves we we translate that to the to the name Jesus but the Lord the Lord saves even in the in his own name the meaning of his name showed the purpose of his ministry on Earth that the Lord saves so here you say well what was it it was the spiritual salvation of God's people it was to to remove that the alienation that they had with God that that their sins that that they created that God would remove that from them that they'd be able to be with God again you know I think about that here that here as the angel would say you call his name Yeshua you call his name Jesus it meant that the Lord saves you know that he's been called many things but what I find today is every name that Jesus was called it was used to define or identify a a characteristic that he had in a relationship that he has with someone see I'm a I'm a dad to some people so they call me dad you may not call me dad cuz I'm not your dad but I have children here that they call me dad but it's my name because I have that relationship with them and so the names that Jesus is called is to identify a relationship that he has with those that's why he was called God he was called father he was called son I wonder if some of us can Define uh Define him by a relationship that you've had with him the Bible in one place the said he was called Advocate how many how many can say am man this morning and say he's been an advocate to me when I was in trouble but he stood in my stand he defended me when I was on trial and I should have I should have gone away but he was an advocate and he stood in my stad he's been called many things to identify his relationship I say he's been called the master how many say Amen he's been my master he he's been called the the the leader of the church he's been called he's been called a rock how many say Amen he's a rock he he's been called the alpha and the Omega he's the Messiah he was the teacher he was the Beloved he was the branch of the Lord he was a good shepherd He was the light of the world he was a savior he was the author he was an everlasting father he was the line of the tribe of Judah that mean he went into battle for me so when I go into battle I can win every battle cuz the line of the tribe of Judah is on my side he was called the Dayspring he was called Emanuel and he's been an Emmanuel to me because he's God with me whenever I have when I have need of him in the time of Darkness he was my bride and Morning Star when I needed a guide on my way and I lost my path he was a guide un me I say he's been called many things but that's his relationship with me he's the way he was the truth he was the life he was the king of Jews he was the son of man he was the bridegroom he was the Prince of Peace he was the almighty he was a servant he was a he was a Chief Cornerstone he was the image of an invisible God that's our Jesus praise God he's been called things in the Book of Revelations he was called a faithful witness but you realize that whenever jesus takes on a name that he actually he actually displays an attribute that he gives to you as a Believer so if he was called an overcomer it means you're an overcomer if he was called a savior you said well how can I be a savior the Christ in you is what's saving the world it's the it's the very thing the word that you minister to somebody else that brings him to Salvation you say well how can I be a Healer the Bible said he gives us Gifts of healing why would he asked us to lay hands on one another that we' receive healing because that same healer that walked upon the Earth is dwelling on the inside of you this morning the Bible said that he was a faithful I feel like preaching this morning don't don't let me go long he was a faithful witness he was a faithful from that means from his birth you realize that from his birth that Jesus was always found faithful in his calling he was faithful in his purpose he was a Fai you say well what was he a witness of well here's what the Bible said whenever he stood before Pilate pilate said just answer this one question are you a king or not and Jesus said you say that I am a king but to this end was I born and this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto truth yeah right and everyone that is of Truth hears my voice see he spoke truth he lived truth even in his own death he stood for truth he would go by by the by the the cross of crucifixion but it didn't matter he stood for truth you know what you know what this shows us that Jesus understands the challenges that it takes for us to be faithful that's right all the things that he was he gone through it to understand the challenge that you would face in this hour so here to be an overcome he understands the challenge of what it takes to be an overcomer he understands the challenge of what it takes to have faith he understands the challenge of what it takes to be able to fulfill your your purpose with God or to be able to walk with God he understands the pressure that we're living in and don't you realize this morning that we're living under a real pressure there's so much pressure on the Believers today to be a believer there there's a pressures to be uh finances and pressure there's spiritual pressure great great natural pressures that we face but you realize that we're living under the age of great pressure and here in this age the greatest pressure that we have on the Christian Church it ain't money it ain't finances it that that's not the pressure we have but the pressure that the church according to the Bible the pressure that the church would have in the end time is the pressure to compromise on truth that's what the Bible says Matthew 24 there would in the end time there'd be earthquakes and persecution and famine and and and and in second Timothy that people would would look for answers and they'd go and try to find some that would have itching ears and looking for answers and many false prophets and false Christ would arise and they' say come over here and find God or follow me out here and we'll find God he said but don't look to all those things but but for the Bible says it may all sound good but Jesus said Matthew it all will lead to your death so be faithful our Faithful is faithfulness is not just to follow after whatever come by he said But Here We ought to be faithful do you realize that that our faith is constantly tested in this hour but to be faithful it means to remain loyal or steadfast to be reliable it means to stay the course not not to be a witness against one another but to be a witness against the devil to be to be able to stand for God and stand for his word to be faithful in this hour for Paul said for we are made partakers of Christ if somebody say if if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end what is he talking about if we remain faithful the confidence that we had in the beginning if you hold that until the end he said you are made partakers with Christ in other words don't lose your confidence in God don't lose don't lose your trust in God that God is able to lead the church don't lose our confidence in God that God is still leading us and God is still making a way you realize that so many today that they'll follow they my goodness I'll get myself in trouble they follow after too many other things than to follow after God but don't lose your confidence in God let God lead you let let God lead the church let God continue you realize our church has made some shifts you know why it's called it's called growth and and you see the you see the growth of the church because God has wanting to take the church somewhere and I and how be it that any of us would get in God's way but I say Lord don't let me get in your way just let me be in your will Lord let let you use us let God lead the church and let us move us to a higher Heights and further down the told to one day that we'll walk out of this world into the Rapture that's our desire as a body of Believers Lord put me where you need me let me serve where I'm needed why because I want to be faithful to the cause of God you know somebody could come in from the outside and so well you don't belong there you belong here I can't believe they'd use you there they ought to use you here and my why it ain't nothing but a devil speaking in your ear to make you lose confidence in what God has given you but I say we ought to remain faithful to what God has given us remain faithful to our post to duty and remain faithful to to our place in the house of God God called you here for a reason don't lose conf I feel like preaching don't lose confidence in God lord don't lose confidence in God God is still able to lead God's still leading the church God still has pastors that are called of God that'll keep true to the word of God that'll bring a balance to his word God still has men that'll stand upon the word of God he still has a body of believers they can walk out in this world and they still live the same thing from one day to the next the same on in churches that knew out of church cuz they're faithful be faithful Jesus said in the end remember the parable the faithful will receive the reward that's right many will fall but the faithful will receive the reward that's it remember when he did gave the parable of the of the servant and the king and he said but then the then the master came to the servant and he said unto him well done my good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things you know that's a way to today people want great things they want a great wealth they want great Ministries they want great they want they want a a great status a great position or something like that but you realize what Jesus said he said I found him a good and faithful servant because he was Faithful over little things over a few things he said and because he was Faithful over a few things I thought my that's the way we ought to be this morning we ought to just be faithful Christians Faithful Servants faithful you know people we want to be something that but let's just be faithful Christians and Faithful Servants and and follow God he said but because you've been Faithful over a few things I will make you ruler over many things so we found them faithful faithful in what God has given us and faithful in our in our call of God Jesus was a faithful witness he wants us as a body of Believers to be a faithful witness listen what Paul said he said let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called I know most people quote that and use it to Define ministers or talking about preachers but notice this word calling it comes from a Greek word Claus which means a a calling or an invitation a Divine invitation of God so it's not just speaking of ministry but in other words it's actually speaking of all of those that have been called by God into the household of faith so Paul said is abide in the calling wherein you were called in other words he begins to talk about servants and how that they belong to one master but Paul said but in this same scripture at 1 Corinthians 7 he said but but he said but but God has purchased you you've been purchased by God you were bought with a price in other words you may have belong to another Master but now you've been bought with a price so you're Christ purchased possession he said therefore because you've been bought with a price no longer are you the servant of men but you're a servant of God therefore let every man when he is called abide in his calling with God abide with God because he is purchased to you might you may have been bound by another Master you may have been ruled by another Master you may have been ruled by sin are rued by the flesh but Paul said but when you recognize that you've been bought with a price this morning then abide in the invitation that God has given you that I don't have to remain back there cuz God has called me out he said abide with God be faithful serving the lord abide with him he said but God is faithful he will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able he say how can I be faithful with God he said because God is faithful with you he will not suffer you to be tempted more than than you're able he said but when tempt would come he will also provide a way of Escape that you may be able to bear in other words God won't allow anything to tempt you that he won't give you a way to overcome it hello somebody he said brother Matt I've gone through some great trial there ain't a trial God would ever allow to come on your life that he didn't give you a way to get out of it oh I've come under a heavy burden I don't know if I can carry this one there ain't a burden that God would allow to come on your life that he wouldn't give you the strength to be able to bear I don't know if I can go another mile but God wouldn't allow you to go down a path that he wouldn't give you a way to finish when God calls you think about it he's faithful to see you through think about our God this morning he's the god that took the children of Israel to the walls of Jericho you say wow what an impossible place but he was faithful to see them through he took him to the Red Sea what an impossible situation but he was faithful to see him through friends don't you realize that God will never bring you anywhere that he won't bring you through that's it he'll never bring you anywhere he didn't bring you this far to leave you out in the wilderness he he that was the challenge that Moses made to God you can't leave us abandoned out here for the people will say that you brought us this far but you couldn't take us in he said but I'm a God that's a finisher he's the author and the finisher of our faith he don't just begin a journey but he'll finish it that's right you say well how can we stand faithful brother Joe because God is faithful that's it he's faithful to make a way that you'd be able to stand you know there's many rulers many kings that have come upon the Earth they have many subjects that follow after them but I thank God this morning that Heaven has a king oh Hallelujah Heaven has a king and his name is Jesus he was called in the Book of Revelations the Bible said they would make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he who is he somebody say the lamb lamb who was that Jesus the Lamb of God which was Jesus and he is the Lord of lords and the king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and a faithful people say how can we be faithful because Christ is faithful we have a faithful King and because we have a faithful King we can be faithful to our calling because we have a faithful King we can be faithful to to the position that he has given us and we we can be faithful do you realize that that's what God is calling us to do he's calling us to dedicate ourselves in this hour to serve him and and to dedicate oursel to be able to uh to be a Christian and to be a real servant of God and to and to take the invitation that Christ has given us to this hour and manifest to life in this dark and Dying World said you realize that he's faithful Heth a't it something yes sir man to think about it to go into a kingdom my we feel I feel good anyway to go into a kingdom and to know that you came with the right person can you imagine going in this I know there's a lot of people a lot of devils today say well you can't have that and you'll never be healed and you'll never have any peace in your family and and and God never work that out you're always going to be stuck in this situation but you realize you can't go over there you know well you know sometimes we just need to go and get something sometimes brother Wester we need something we need a a spiritual move we need a we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost we need God we need a Revival in our heart and so we we're walking around in the kingdom of God and we're looking for something from God and you go over on the grounds of healing and say I want to get some healing and Satan comes over he says you can't be on these grounds but I thank God we have an answer this morning you say well what's the answer your answer is oh I'm here with the King amen amen so you can't be over here no I don't no no no I'm I'm here with the King can you imagine being in the Kingdom of the great king and when somebody would come by and say you can't go in the hall no I'm here with the King you can't go into them Chambers but I'm here with the King you can't go to the dining room but I'm here with the King matter of fact let me tell you friends you don't even have to say it there's a porter that's standing there that say it on your behalf that any devil that would try to stand in your way to to keep you from a promise of God and say I don't think you know who you're dealing with but he came in here with the King that means all the grounds belong to you you have access to every ground let me tell you when the king gives an invitation it's an open invitation it don't come with a with a pass like it does in my house when I invite you over that don't mean go in my bedroom it means you can go anywhere else in the house but my bedroom but you know when the king invites you it's an open invitation he gave you an invitation go into the go in and make yourself a home take off your shoes I'd hate to be a guest in the house that they keep you put your jacket there put you it it makes you feel leave your shoes on if you want to take them off if you want to prop your feet up on the couch if you want to make yourself at home amen why because you came with a king we've been we've been giving an invitation this morning I'm with King Jesus I wonder how many say that this morning I'm here with King Jesus you can't be healed but I'm here with King Jesus you can't have a Revival I'm here with King Jesus you can't receive it I'm here with King Jesus let me tell you not only are you here with the King not only did he invite you this morning but you have a great relationship with him see you know maybe they say well he was just a guest for a little while but friends let me show you in the scripture we're not just a guest for a little while you realize that the names of family members that we give one another I got to think about this how that you know that you know that your your son is called a son and then and then then the next child is called a grandson one of these days I'm going to have one of them praise the Lord but then the next child's a great grandson and the next one's a great great grandson so as it goes on down you you know what the the name that you give it actually identifies their place in the genealogy but do you realize in the natural genealogy no matter no matter what you're called you know you call Aunts Uncles and by the name that we give we can identify where they are in our genealogy that's the purpose of those names and so here whenever we read this or or hear about uh being a son or a grandson in the genealogy do you realize that with each generation the DNA that came from the original father is cut in half so here he has a son the son gets half the DNA from his father he gets half the DNA from his mother well then when that son would have a son he's got a quarter of the DNA from his grandpa and see so it goes on he's only the DNA is passed down and by every generation it loses the amount of DNA from the original ancestor by half it's called genetic delusion and so as the genetics as it passes down continues So eventually it's so such a small a small part it's such a small part uh uh that that that you almost can't even recognize it but they're still a little part but but you know it's not the same anymore they don't really have the same characteristics they don't really look like them anymore because they've been so many things that I'm I'm I'm getting somewhere but but there've been so many things that that have been entered into that seed line and so many different parents and different fathers but that ain't the only thing uh that that that that is lost but also the science would tell us that in that that actually the the the experiences and memories that that first generation had that as you go down in Generations that the experience is no longer there as well because they weren't with great grandpa and they and so the experiences and the memories change and and and they become less accessible and they're replaced with new memories of new family members and and and through the through the the lens of each generation it is filtered into a new life and new stories but realize that this morning we're not talking about an Earthly family we're not talking about an Earthly Kingdom but we're talking about a Heavenly Kingdom and a Heavenly family we're not talking about a natural lineage but talking about a Heavenly lineage an eternal lineage with God and you realize in the family of God that God has no grandchildren so that means there is no loss there is no genetic loss that in the family of God it don't matter if it's 2,000 years later and 100 Generations later a person but telling another one and telling another one when that seed is born upon the Earth in 2024 they got the same DNA that they had in the book of Acts they belong to God and the same thing that God gave them in the in the upper room is the same thing he gives you today we belong to God there ain't no regress in the DNA of God there ain't no regress in the experience there ain't no regress in the memory you don't have to have a memory of a great grandpa going by God don't have to be a god of history that he's a god of a today experience a today God a today experience we we're we're God's children we're not God's grandchildren the Bible said as many first John or John the first chapter as as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God somebody say Sons son to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor the will of man but they were born of God you said well what about the daughters let me just tell you that word sons of God wasn't just talking about boys but it was as many they would become the sons that word come from the Greek word techon which means the child or The Offspring of God so whether you're a son or a daughter of God that when you're when you when you receive him then you have been given power to become a child of God you realize that not only are you given power the reason why you were given power can I make one more there's a reason why you were given power because it was your ordained Destiny as a Believer you realize that everything has a destiny every every church has a Destiny the world has a destiny the Earth has a Destiny the heavens has a destiny our nation the America it has a destiny you can find you can read about it it's a sad Destiny but you can read about in Revelations the 13th chapter about how that great image would be destroyed you this nation is it won't stand forever that's why we don't put our confidence in it but it has a destiny we're we're the nation of 13 we had 13 stripes or our flag had 13 uh Stars when it originated and so here in Revelations 13 we find the destiny of this great nation but I thought my here if the country country would have a destiny then so do the children of God have a destiny if the world has a destiny then so do the children of God and not only do we have a destiny but God has given us a way to view our destiny how many want to hear it he's given us a way to look at it but said see he said election looks back at for knowledge but predestination looks to Destiny one looks back and one looks forward he say see the election back here he uses an illustration of a cockabur how many you ever heard this you know what we're from Arkansas you know what a cockabur is that old that old thing that sticks on your pants when you go out in the deer woods and it it sticks on there it's got stickies all over it and you can't get rid of it he said that's the kind of nature that we have with this flesh and here he uses this illustration of how that we would go out and and then this we had that Cocker nature and you can't tell one from the other because they had the old the same old sticky nature he said but then God before the foundation of the world by his forn knowledge he saw that cocka bear and inside of it he placed a wheat seed So then whenever it would go through its life it may look like the rest of the cocko birs they have the same old sticky nature they make the same mistakes they say the same things they do the same things they fall in the same problems in the same path but at some point that seed that's on the inside of it begins to grow and all and that cckar f it comes out of that old cockabur sticky nature that that's going to be there until the day you die you never get rid of this old flesh said but but out of it will come a different life it'll come a new nature and brother Wesley and that will be the nature of that wheat seed he said that's the way it was he said I was born in in iniquity I was born a sinner from a father and mother a family of Sinners I was a Cocker bird but then I become a wheat seed you say well how did that happen it was God's election for before the foundation of the world he elected that Cocker to become a grain of wheat by his forn knowledge God knew every decision You' ever make God knew every choice You' ever made how can God be an eternal God if God don't know what you would do God knew you would do it is that something that's something about our God if you knew what what if we knew what each of us would do to each other You' never even have a relationship with them I ain't never going to talk to them cuz I know what they're going to do to me down the road I know how they're going to treat me I know what they're going to say about me I know how they're going to talk about me so I'm just not going to talk about him if God showed us everything we did to one another we' never meet anybody we' never meet anybody on but he didn't show us that but he knew it and God that knew all that he accepted us anyway he's different he got a different nature than we got he accepted us anyway knowing we' turn our back and knowing we'd walk away from him knowing many times we do wrong things but but but but yet he would make a way anyway so what was it it was election that we would become a great and weed you said well how did it how did you do it well look back is God because God predestinated it a long time ago and by his for knowledge his election was placed by Forge but then he would come into the time of predestination to show you what your destiny is you say see because election shows the forn knowledge of God but predestination think about the word Destin ination is actually referring to your destination or your Destiny says so predestination is looking forward to the destiny that God has given you you see it looks to your destiny you said well where will God take me to where am I going he said it doesn't matter God looks to your destiny he's already made a way that you'll be able to make it do you realize that God made you a Destiny and there ain't nothing that can stop you from arriving there for the Bible you say well I'm not so sure about all that well can I read it to you in the Bible oh yeah Paul said Ephesians 1:4 according to he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that's election he chose us in him somebody say Amen to that it's the Bible it ain't M he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so when did God choose you somebody spell it out before the foundation of the world he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world it ain't a false Doctrine it ain't contrary to the Scripture it ain't something that somebody made up in in the past few years it's the Bible That's What Paul taught he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that's our election that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love you mean God chose me to be holy knowing I was going to be a sinner he chose me to be blameless knowing I'd be full of blame he chose me he elected me before the foundation of the world how about the next verse that was election and Paul said having predestinated us unto the adoption of children so now not only did he choose us not only did he elect us but he showed us what our destiny was he Ed us he predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so before the foundation of the world we were elected by God you were chosen by God and then you were predestined to a predetermined destiny that God had purposed in his heart before the world was ever created before he said let there be light before the darkness was upon the face of the de and the Earth was without form and void in the mind of God he elected you he chose you he Brees ated you to this hour he knew you'd be born in this age he knew who you were he knew who you'd be born to he knew you'd be sitting here this morning I don't know what kind of God you serve that my God ain't something that came out of the figment of some man's imagination but it is us that came out of the mind of God God didn't come out of our mind but we came out of his mind and here we are today manifesting who God said that we would be we're the Church of the Living God with the bow of Jesus Christ you're Sons and Daughters of God you're you're a son of the king this morning it's our destiny you say oh our destiny was to be a child of God say what about my failures don't you realize it wasn't based on our worthiness brother Joe preached it fine Wednesday night it wasn't based on our worthiness but the Bible says but to the praise and the glory of his grace can you leave that up there brother Ben but to the praise and the glory of his grace listen to this you being a Son of God gives praise to the greatness in the glory of God in other words he done that so that so that in your old mixed up life that your life being transformed would be a praise to his grace isn't that something you think of it like that that old messed up life that we live you say oh what a wreck I can never be right with God but but but he' done that that your life would be a testimony of his grace Paul said he done it he predestinated us to the praise of the glory of his grace of his favor that he gives us he said see you're we're praise you realize that you in church this morning serving God even when the devil thought he had you but you being here is a praise to the glory of God's grace do you realize you lifting your hands this morning when the devil says well I'll just keep them down they'll never be free again I'll never let them go back to church I I'll just weigh them down with so many pressures of the world that they can't even serve God no more but here you are this morning with your hand raised what is it it's a testimony a praise to the glory of God's grace here we are you said what are we doing we're praising his grace our sisters when you go out in the world you live a life of Holiness what is it it's a praise to the glory of his grace you brothers that go out and you live a life of Holiness it's a praise to the glory of the grace of God the Bible says wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved in other words he is we we're a part of this group of people that are called The Beloved right a group of people that God has called before the foundation of the world God has made us accepted in the family of the Beloved in other words you know what that means beloved it's a gapo which came from the love of God it means those that have received the love of God and here he has made us accepted in the family of those that have received the love of God you know what it is the love of God this word by definition it's a love that is unconditional it's a love that is not reciprocated you realize that God don't love you as long as you love him back he loves you even if you don't love him back he loves you even if you don't give him no attention he loves you even if you don't worship him even if you don't praise him that's why we do praise God that's why we come in the house of God and give Glory unto God because he gave us an unconditional love when we wasn't worthy of it I thought my isn't it something about our destiny we've been given a destiny this morning but something about our destiny is that that that a prophecy always speaks of Destiny you realize when a prophecy Goes Forth it's always speaking of a Destiny or something that God is going to bring about every prophecy is speaking of Destiny it's talking about something God is going to do you know I thought how how it is to see the Bible says a virgin shall conceive do you realize that was Mary's Destiny she'll bring forth a a son he would be born in the town of Bethlehem that was Mary's Destiny and you realize it don't matter what happened whatever she had to go through but God had already spoke it through the prophets concerning her Destiny and there ain't nothing she could do to change it because that was her Destiny can I close with this think about here Mary she had been given a destiny that was given by God and you realize in her life here her and Joseph and this little uh child that she was about to give birth to and carrying this little baby in her womb and here they were a poor family do you realize they had no money this was a a very poor family the Bible would tell us this of how how that that whenever they went after Jesus was 40 days old they went to the priest to give their sacrifice to how many knows what a worthy sacrifice was or what a customary sacrifice for a newborn baby was for purification it was a lamb but they didn't have the money to buy a lamb so when they went to make the sacrifice they bought two Turtle dos instead which was a makeaway offering for the poor people so here they were a poor people on their way they they had no money for a journey and they had been called by the king's orders here it wasn't by Joseph's own will that he went into Bethlehem but it was the king's orders of their Earthly King that they have to go in uh in in to be able uh to the census and so they went in after the orders of an Earthly King and I thought my here they sit here this lady that was just about to have a baby sitting on the back of a donkey traveling 90 miles through lands of robbers and and up and down these mountains and and through people uh all kinds of treacherous people and had no way to defend themselves but they had to go because it was the king's orders and they followed after the king's orders I thought but you know what that wasn't the only King that had given them an order see but because before the foundation of the world there was another king that would give an order in the mouth of Isaiah he would ordain that the destiny of Mary that she would be in Bethlehem out of the mouth of Mah that there would be a kingdom that would be born out of the mouth of Daniel and so here because another king had given an order it didn't matter what she went through she had to make it to Bethlehem and that's the way it is with you and I is God has given you a destiny then you're then you're bound to be able to receive it you realize the natural King may give an order we have orders in this life we have to go through sometimes we do things that we don't like to do we have to work places we don't like to work it's the natural order that was given to us by the natural King but I thank God we have a Heavenly king that's also given us an order he said you're going to make it through this life you're going to make it through persecution you're going to make it through the up days you're going to make it through the down days you're going to make it through the times when you're bow you're going to make it through the times when you're sick because I've given you an order that you're going to make it to the other side I thank God this morning that God has given us a destiny we have an order from King Jesus that's our destiny as Believers brother said you know maybe sometimes married with a ask why has God put me on this path some of you ask that some of us are too prideful to ask why has God put me on this path said but you ought to give us consolation to know this that we can I read it as you stand to your feet we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny that makes me want to shout all over this building we don't hold our destiny it's God that holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so and there will nothing ever never interrupt the program of God for we are bound to arrive don't that make you feel good this morning amen just as much as that child would be bound to make it to give birth or or or or that Mary would make it to give birth you realize there was nothing from stop nothing that could stop her because she had an order from the King a real order whose orders are you following this morning think about it we give or everybody will give you orders Direction how you ought to do things that handling live anybody give you an order but what about the king's orders say she had an order from the King you say what king King Jesus king god king Holy Ghost he's the same one that's what he said to John he said I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last see it matters who gives the order where are we getting our orders from see a man I I could give you an order it may seem like an easy thing to do you might get down the road and not even be able to do it but let me tell you something about this King when he gives an order he'll always make a way for you to do it you may come to a place that seems completely impossible but because the king gave the order you know there's going to be a way the king gave the order if God called you think about it if he called you then he'll make a way for you to serve serve him that's he called you to be a Christian he's going to make a way he called you to be an overcomer then he'll make a way for you to overcome he called you to be a minister he'll make a way that you can be a minister if he called you to sing he'll make a way for you to sing he'll make a place why because the king gave the order and the King will make a way if he called you to be the leader of men he'll give you the men to lead over because the king will make a way he'll never give you an order that you can't perform he always provides a way isn't it something it's our destiny to arrive say and you're bound to arrive you're bound to arrive because our destiny came from the King you say where is this Kingdom today I'm seeking it I want to see it I want to be a part of it I I want to see the kingdom that Abraham had sought after let me tell you what Jesus said he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God the very thing Abraham sought for he said if man ain't born again he cannot see it but listen if he would give that as a destiny I want to be in this Kingdom except a man be born again you'll never be in the kingdom of God this is the King's order I I really want to be a part of that I want to make my way in I I want to be saved I want to have eternal life except to me a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God see that's the king's order but see there's something about this King remember he won't give an order that he don't make a way to perform see so if that's the king's order you had to be born again in order to see the kingdom of God well then he has to make a way for you to be born again isn't that what Jesus told Nicodemus he said how can a man be saved he said he said that he would he would have to be born again he would he would have to be he would have to be birthed and remember Nicodemus he didn't understand it but God gives an order and he gives a way to do it and matter of fact it is the mystery of what Jesus said he was he said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh under the father but my me that was a great mystery but Peter caught a revelation of that mystery of who Jesus was and when he caught a revelation he recognized the deity of Jesus and what did he do he said I give unto you the keys to the kingdom and Peter took those keys to that Kingdom and unlocked every door to every believer he unlocked the door to the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said how do we get saved he said repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so the king gave an order and then the king provided away repent and be back baptize and you shall receive the Holy Ghost but said the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God and by this way that God has made we are born into that Kingdom and we're subjects and delegates it's within us I think about it this morning you think with that key every door has been open to the believer every door every the door of healing it's been open to the believer here great men of God what did Jesus say what did the or what did the Bible say about your entance into the Kingdom of Heaven he said it was ministered unto you said what did Peter do he preached unto them and by the preaching the anointed preacher of the Gospel it opened the door into the kingdom of heaven or Heaven it opened way so every promise of God every door that's in this great kingdom do you realize that by these men that are anointed of God that the door has been unlocked to the believer so if you need healing this morning the door's been open to you if you need a Revival the door's been open to you if you need God to move on the on behalf of your children it don't matter you can't come to a door that hasn't been opened Satan wants to make it look like it's closed my children are going to be lost but let me tell you this is a Christmas message I don't think of a I can't think of a greater gift that God could give you than your own children it's the greatest gift that there have that you have and I know that many of you sitting here today you have loved ones that that's your wish in this time of Christmas that's the the gift that I'd like to receive but you realize let me tell you this morning that door is an Open Door amen you said what I do you just walk in the the door and you claim it do like they did in the old days you know you've heard so many testimonies of those that took their Bibles in the church with them and set an extra Bible in the seat down beside them he said well what's that extra Bible for that's for my son or for my daughter one of these days they'll sit in that very seat why because that's our that's our desire and it's an Open Door maybe you've been troubled in your spirit or in your body been having some health problems you know the sister Patricia gave a testimony she been troubled with these migraines for so long and and for many years and she said I was sitting in service the other day and in the middle of the preaching of the word there something come over me from the back of my back all the way across to the front of my head she said I never felt nothing like it and from that time I've not had one single migraine head the door's open the door's open for our healing this morning see I don't care what the devil does he'll come by he tries to slam the door in your face well what about this I I'll poke at you here and I'll poke at you there don't worry about it you just keep claiming an open door this morning but the door's been open don't you realize we don't have to unlock anything that's already been unlocked whatever you have need of this morning won't you just bow your heads and lift your hand to the Lord here here is God in the presence of the king of kings here stands The Gift Giver the one that has the ab ility to to give what you have need of I wonder how many could treat him like a king this morning and say

a Revival Lord God if they need a refreshing from the presence of the Lord God I pray you would refresh him this morning God that we would go from this place and be able to say that we've received

devil's done lately he's took you back into it you know what he's done he's used his instruments he's used his instruments and allowed them to speak to you and speak in your ear and speak to your heart until you don't have enough Faith to even talk to your own sister and put your arm around her and tell her you love her anymore because Satan uses his instruments to put that in your heart cause
