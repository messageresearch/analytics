and just want to make a couple of quick announcements before we get started so I don't forget um just want to uh first of all I want to invite the church my daughter's getting married uh on November 15th on Friday uh this not this coming Friday but the next Friday uh I don't normally get up and make wedding announcements but I certainly can't have anybody in the church think they weren't invited or or we didn't send them a text or or they got left out of it cuz that's not the case we uh uh sometimes we just don't don't uh have everybody's number or maybe something would fall through the cracks or something like that so we don't want that to happen we're all welcome to come we'd certainly love uh to to have everybody there to celebrate that uh time with us and um and I know there's several that are looking forward to it so if nothing else y'all come and be moral support for me no I really am proud of proud of them and but just we just wanted to make the church welcome that everybody could come and also uh we we got some new grandparents here this morning and you wouldn't ever known it by looking at him but uh brother Dave Gates is a grandpa now and sister Eve is a grandma amen which you know truthfully they've been they've been Grandma and Grandpa to a lot of our kids for a long time so he he's been paaul Dave to a bunch of these kids around here but but we just want to congratulate him and their family and it my new life is always a wonderful thing isn't it amen so we just want to ask you also that you would remember uh in prayer uh our India trip we've made arrangements with the brothers in uh India to go on the last week of of January uh be the first uh few days of February it'll be about a 12 to 14 day trip total then I'll I'll be out of the the country and it's been several years since we've been able to go and and be there and a lot of young people that we W to the Lord have grown up up and preaching and and there just so many testimonies that we've heard and and uh just look forward to what God has in store so we just ask for your prayer for those meetings and a couple of young Brothers have talked to me about going uh uh over there with me so y'all just be in prayer about that and I know they will uh they they may not have the all the the funds to be able to go so if the Lord put something on your heart to give to help in that I really believe it' be good for them to be able to go and so uh just be praying about that as as it as it comes closer and uh so also remember in prayer this morning uh brother Bobby's Aunt uh her grandson Leo needs prayer has asked the church to pray for for him this morning maybe if there's somebody else that has a need on their heart just lift your hand to the Lord I believe God is mindful of what we have need of and I I believe that he's he's certainly more than able and willing to meet our needs this morning so won't we just bow our heads together and just maybe each one just ask him in your own way just ask the Lord to come into this service and speak to our hearts and be a help to us this morning that we could draw closer to him amen is that your desire and won't we just invite him to come gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord this morning Lord we're so grateful Lord for another opportunity to be able to come and gather in the house of God and Lord knowing that we just love you Lord and Lord there's nothing that we could ever do that would that would make us worthy of receiving the goodness that you've given to us in this hour but Lord we just want you to know we're thankful for it and Lord we just thank you for all that you've done for us our families Lord for raising us in this place and God giving us a place to fellowship and to preach the word of God and Lord we thank you for a body of people Believers Lord that come to hear your word and God I just ask you this morning that you would strengthen this church and Lord I pray God that you would fill everyone Lord Maybe some are are just a little down or low but God I pray you would strengthen them this morning you would revive them God let your word go forth and bring life as it always does and Lord we'll just give you the glory for everything you do Lord I pray you'd heal the sick that are Among Us in Jesus name we ask amen amen amen you believe that he will amen I won't you to turn around somebody shake their hand this morning say I'm a Believer amen you love the Lord this morning amen somebody say I'm a believer real loud I'm a Believer my yeah that's a bunch of whisperings going on in here I feel like me there ain't nobody you don't have to be afraid to say it I'm a Believer I mean tell them like you mean it you know I'm a Believer I don't want the devil to know I want I want everybody to know I'm a Believer God bless you brother Jonah this morning I'm a Believer amen you a Believer amen praise the Lord amen you love the Lord amen we just thankful to be able to come in the house of God and fellowship around God's word amen so we just want to invite you to the scripture this morning we're going to uh take a turn in John the 11th chapter and we're going to read out of the 11th verse and then uh we'll go up to the uh about the 25th verse we'll give you just a moment to get there John 11 and 11 and I know we had some just a really Mighty move of God Wednesday night certainly appreciate what how many that the Lord touched in the meeting Wednesday night amen God bless you and I had a sister telling me when she's like you got got to reading that quote about the angel of the Lord being near and I saw that Pillar of Fire right there on the platform I thought isn't it he's the same Pillar of Fire that he always has been amen and he's still present with us this morning amen so even even when you don't see him he's still present amen so we just appreciate God for that and but we do we want to read out of the 11th chapter and the 11th verse a very familiar reading the Bible said these things said he after he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth sleepeth but I go that I may wake him out of his sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleeps he shall do well how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought he spoke of him taking a rest in sleep but then Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said Thomas which is called dimus unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him and then Jesus came and he found that he had Lain in the grave 4 days already now Bethany was n un Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and to Mary to comfort them concerning their brother but then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming she went out and met him but Mary and uh sat still in the house and then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had us been here my brother had not not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Now isn't that isn't that something you got to notice here that it was her approach to the word of God brother man would use that in blind birus he said see if you come to a gift of God you've always got to come with the right approach or come with the right mental attitude so he said if you don't come with the right approach you'll never receive nothing so she says Lord I believe that that whatever th will ask of God God will give it to thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and Martha said to him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day but Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen we want to preach this morning on bound to be free as you take your seats on bound to be free I know this is a very familiar reading and just to kind of lay a foundation this this morning uh we we realized that here as Jesus was entering into this place as he begin to talk to the disciples and telling them something uh that that he had saw by Vision knowing that Lazarus was going to raise from the dead and uh we realized that that that I I I'm a firm believer of this that uh that this was something that Jesus knew that you know no no doubt that they had sent word to him and told him that he was sick and they sent word and telling him that uh he was in a bad way and this was you realize that these were friends of Jesus they were very uh close friends and they were uh there was as family as there was family in order uh you know many times that he had sat in that very house and they had prepared meals for him and many time had had Fellowship in that way and but when they called upon him for healing but he didn't go and he delayed his coming and he delayed his his departure and the longer it got the sicker got and uh finally broke into this his sickness broke over into death and and as he would tell the disciples that you know uh that that he realized that that death had came to him and he went to tell the disciples that that Lazarus is sleeping and so they uh so they begin to make their Journey down to where Lazarus was and uh we realize whenever they came to this place that uh as as they went there I really believe this that Jesus knew the condition of Lazarus the whole time he knew that he was going to die and he knew that he was going to be raised again he knew that God was going to use him to show his glory he knew that there was something that had to be shown known in this time and Lazarus just happened to be the one that was anointed for the hour for God to be able to use as a as a sign of resurrection and uh so we we see as he went down to this place and and he came to where he was and and they come out to meet him and they come to speak to him and and but but as he came to this place as Jesus um as he as he come to the tomb and and you know you can see the scene as here these many Jews had gathered around and the family and the loved ones and here they were weeping and and crying and and see in this condition and but Jesus stood out there and and the Bible said he was grieved in his Spirit he he wept because of uh you know he had such a burden for the people and but as he stood in that place as he he looked out and here was a there was a man that was laying in a tomb and on that tomb was a stone that blocked him in and he comes out and he said take the stone off or the stone off of the Tomb and and roll it away let the let the cave be opened up and you know and here Martha said Lord you know he's been dead for 4 days I'm sure his body is stinking now he said but just get the stone out of the way and so as they rode the stone away and then the Bible says and he cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and the Bible says when Jesus said the words Lazarus come forth that he that was dead came forth I always thought it was powerful that b he was he that was dead now he came forth and but the Bible says but whenever he came out he came out and he was bound at his hands and he was bound at his feet and he had a napkin over his face and he was bound with a napkin and brother Mark in other words all that he had was bound up even though he was called from the dead into the land of the living still yet he walked out after the resurrection and he walked out bound and you know I think that you look at from a spiritual sense but said according to To His abundant Mercy quoting what Peter said according to His abundant Mercy Heath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead being born again not of a corrupt able seed but of an Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever so here we see this that that that Jesus has called us into this place of resurrection and here as we've seen just like Lazarus in the natural we saw this same thing in the spiritual that we've been called to a place of Resurrection you've been called to a new birth you've been called um uh uh to a uh to a new life or to be borned again and and you know what I find it many times that there are many people that are bound by many things things and you know you say well brother mat well I've had a new birth and you know I've been born again and I and I really believe that I say Amen but you know many times you'll find those that after they've been born and after their birth but still yet they're Bound by many things and what these are is brother wesy they are good people that are bound they are free people that are bound they are born again people that are bound they're people that have been called out of out of death and under life but still yet they come outbound and you know you if you ever go study the scripture you'll find out that no matter where you go in the Bible you'll find that God never wants his children to be bound somebody say amen he never wants his children to be bound you'll find them bound he's going to find a way to set them free because it's not the desire of God for you to be bound in any way it's not God's desire for your spirit to be bound up it's not his desire for you to be bound Up In the Flesh or bound up in your in your spirit or bound up in your walk with God it's God's desire let me just establish something this morning it's the desire of God for his children children to be free that's God's desire it's not his desire to be bound you know many places you find in the scripture and you'll find that the children of God were found in a place of bondage you even as as as back in the early church you'll see that they were they were the nicians and that was binding the children of God but we realize that this Spirit even in the early church now how many knows what nickon is there here it was a spirit that was binding God's church now that comes from a Greek word which was Nel which meant to conquer and then Leos which meant leoty so here this this word nickan it was a binding of the people of God and so we see even in the early Church in the Ephesus Church this was the good thing that God noticed about the church he said he said that you hate the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate but by the third Age The Very Deeds the things that they were doing had turned into the doctrine of the church so by the time we get to the perous age no longer was it just a deed but now it had became Doctrine where Jesus would say so you have uh this is what I hate about this age or this church age he said is that you also have them that hold the doctrine of the nians which thing I hate so now the very Deeds that they done now it had become Doctrine brother Bram said just to be plain with you he said in other words somebody was doing something in that early church that was Conquering the leoty somebody say Amen in other words they were being conquered so brother Mark if they were being conquered then there had to be an authority that was conquering them there had to be something that was was holding them or something that was binding them say so see in other words the people they were being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of God now think of this these are God's children this is God's church this is God's people but somehow someway they were being subjected to in a way that was contrary to the word of God in other words they were brought subject in a contrary way now let me just lay a a foundation here this morning it's not bad to be under subjection can I just say that that way it's not bad to be subject it's not bad to be under subjection matter of fact the Bible would teach us to the contrary it would say that to be subjection means to surrender to another's control but the question is is what are you surrendering to see it's not bad to be subject it's not bad to be under subjection but the question is what are you being under subjection to I tell you what James said he said wherefore God sayith God resisteth the proud but but but giveth grace to the humble so therefore submit yourselves therefore to God so it's okay to submit but submit to the right thing he said submit yourselves to God and resist the devil and he'll flee from you even Peter would write about it he said humble yourselves under God's Mighty hand and God will lift you up Paul in Ephesians the five fth chapter he would use the natural relationship between a husband and wife to type uh the relationship between Christ and the church remember what he said he said wives submit yourselves to your husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now I know there's many evil-minded men that have taken this scripture and abused it and and and used it to put a I'll just put that woman in her place that's what they say you know I I'll just keep her down here and I'll put her under my foot and I'll just rule over and I I'm the head of my household I'm the king of my you know these evil-minded men that try to rule over their life in some evil way like that but they failed to read the rest of I may as well just pre may as well give it all to you this morning but they failed to read the rest of the scripture where Peter said but also or Paul said husbands also love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it so ought to men love their wives as their own bodies so all this stuff you do and I'm going to give you some free pastoring but all this stuff you do to take care of you and you got to make sure your your belly's full and make sure you feel good and make sure you're comfortable make sure everything works to your liking but PA but Paul said but you ought to love your wife as your own body for he that loveth his wife loveth himself so then he speaks so he makes a good balance and when the husband gets in his position it's a lot easier for the wife to get into hers amen somebody thank you brother man preach it I believe I will concerning the church listen what Paul said he said therefore as the church he said submit yourselves one to another submit one to another in the fear of God so it's not bad to be under submission but submit to the right thing say see so we submit ourselves one to another in other words we ought to be accountable one to another and subject one to another according to the word of God in Philippians the Bible say let nothing be done in strive for vain Glory but in humility Let each esteem other better than themselves now this is not a suggestion this is the nature of a Believer to esteem others better than yourself you know why because God hates that old evil highminded selfish attitude that people have that everything is about them and every Everything has to take care of their feelings and their likings and has to fit the way they see it or the way like it God hates that Spirit he he doesn't like it he said we ought to we ought to prefer our brother we ought to we ought to prefer our sister that's the nature of a Believer for the Bible says look not every man on his own things but look every man on the things of others in other words consider your brother and consider your sister you know oh I know it gets a little Sicky when you get into this but sometimes better if you can consider their feelings and consider what they're going through and consider what what caused them to to act the way that they act see but the Bible says consider one another and I I'm not just preaching this so you can hear it I'm preaching it to you so you so it can change you that this is the nature of a Believer this is the way we ought to be the Bible said let this mind this is where this scripture come from he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus this was the mind that Christ had was to consider the other it was a it was to be a servant to to the world it was to consider his Brethren or his sister the mind of Christ is to serve the mind of Christ is to be humble the mind of Christ is to be little and not to be big the mind of Christ is to be is to go to the cross of Calvary and pay and pay a way that you wouldn't have to bear the cross the mind of Christ is to carry your burden and this is the nature that the Bible teaches us to have is to carry one another's burden lift one another edify one another keep them help them strengthen them along the way it ain't to fight H against each other it's not to fight against Authority it's not even uh to keep from being subject under Authority but it's to be subject to the right thing and be subject to the right Spirit you know many times you'll find this because we're a Triune being how many believe that we're a Triune being we're made of a body Soul and Spirit and because we're Body Soul and Spirit we realize that our spirit is subject to spirits and so sometimes sometimes we surrender to the wrong Spirit we allow this flesh to get under the subjection to wrong spirits and Friends what happens is because we're in a spirit realm and in this Spirit realm a spirit gets a hold of a person it'll take them and it'll completely change their nature and you know them very well and you're not that's not like them that's not like her to to act that way it's not like that brother to lash out like that it's not it's not like him to ignore you it's not like her see because we prefer one another and because we know one another and we're we're brothers and sisters in Christ then we realize that sometimes that Spirits get a hold of people and they cause them to do or say things that they don't mean to say or they don't mean to do I know what we want to do we want to cut their head off but let me I I'll just tell you where that Spirit comes from it come from the same place that caused them to act out in the first place so we just want to identify being subject to the wrong thing sometimes in our spirit we get subjected to the wrong thing and demon powers they control you and they build they they they control your thoughts and they control your actions and can you imagine it this morning that an actual demon a spirit would would would to take control of a human being it would C them to do certain things or say things but you say well brother man I I I just don't see how that happens but it's a reality you realize you realize what a demon is see a demon or a devil in our English language is is is a Tormentor that's that's what is identified as a as a demon so in other words it's a fellow that torments brother said a fellow that torments is a devil it's an evil one and demons are tormentors that torment Us in other words a Tormentor is a person who inflicts severe mental or physical s suffering on someone else so notice it's not a person that's doing it it's a demon that does it it's a Tormentor that's why when you when you see somebody that's just torturing or a big old bully just that's tormenting somebody well you say well that's pure demonic well it is demonic because it's a demon power that is behind them causing them to do it it's a demon let me just be straight with you it's a demon that is attached to your spirit it gets in your spirit and it begins to cause you to say things and and do things and before long you look back and say well I don't know why I even ask acted like that I I love that person I don't know why I even said that or why why why why would I even do something like that because sometimes demons being a spirit they use our flesh they get in control of our flesh and then they use us to do and say things you say well I I don't really believe demons can do that well let me just take you to the Bible you remember the story of Ahab and the prophet Micaiah when he would come and warn him about going into battle remember when he come down he said he had 400 prophets that said go into battle but when Micaiah came he said but no but I see when I looked out I seen Israel as a shepher or as sheep without a Shepherd that their Shepherd had fallen in battle and they were all scattered and they they were going back to their homes they had nothing to go back to because they went into this battle and Ahab said but I have 400 prophets that says contrary he said but let me tell you about those prophets he said I also saw at the Throne of God I saw a lying Spirit come to the throne of God and say Lord would you send me down and I will anoint those prophets that they will lie to Ahab and allow thy judgment to come upon him so here lying spirits that came down they were sent from the Throne of God and they anointed men and caused those men to prophesy lies unto Ahab that would cause him to go into battle that the Judgment of God would come about so Spirits can get on people Spirits can control people Spirits can cause you to say things they can cause you to do things demonic spirits you said you mean the devil can use my tongue but abam said certainly he does he'll make you say things that you don't want to say he'll make you lie he'll make you steal he'll make you tell tell things that ain't right he'll make you say bad words that God don't want you to say when the devil gets complete control of you there ain't no telling what you will do see a spirit that can get a hold of a human body said if he ever gets all the way control of you you don't know what you're going to say you just become a mad man that's like that the the man the the gatan that went out remember Legion had so many demons on him that that he couldn't even be identified of who of who he was he he was F with so many demons that when they would put chains on him he would break the chains he would he they they couldn't bind him they he was living out in caves he was an outcast to society and you know you know the prophet would tell us that every bit of that happened to that man because of one little lie that he told think about it it had to start with something he didn't he wasn't just an open vessel and filled with all these demons but it started with one thing and that's what devil does is Satan will use anything to bring you subject unto him I'm trying to to show you what the devil trying to do this morning he's trying to make you subject unto him and he'll use anything to do it he'll use a little lie or he'll use a little drug or he'll use a little music or he'll use a little perversion he'll use a little of anything to open the door to allow him to come into this body in the spirit realm because he he knows the weakness of the flesh he's always tormenting he's trying to find a way to torment you to bring you down that that he could use you and you'd be so tormented that you wouldn't be able to find your way out he's trying to find a way to bind the people of God that's right but let me tell you though you may fall subject to a demon Spirit can I just say it this way this morning you don't have to remain that way though you fall subject to a demonic power you don't have to remain that way it may get on your spirit and maybe go for a few days or a few weeks or a few months some people a few years that that demon power would control the way you act or react or the way you talk to one another but here you are you're a son of God and the daughter of God and you don't have to remain that way but one day it'll come a time like it was when Jesus came across the sea and he met that gaan standing there and the Bible says when Jesus looked into his eyes the demon spoke out of him he said what have I to do with thee oh Jesus of Nazareth let me tell you what he done he peered past the flesh Through The Eyes of Flesh into the spirit of a man and he talked to the demon that was on the inside of it and said you have no right to linger in that vessel any longer you have no right to to inhabit that house any longer and I command you to leave and the demon came out of the man think about this demon there was so many that was on upon him he said what is thy name he said our name is Legion for we are many you think about that Old Demon for he he could have been outnumbered a million to one but let me tell you something about Jesus Christ there ain't no number of demons that ever outnumber the Son of God there ain't no number of demons that'll ever have power power over the Son of God demons are powerless before him Spirits are powerless before him all of death and hell they're powerless before him sickness is powerless before him death is powerless before him evil spirits are powerless before him and not only are they powerless before him you think about him may see what happened with Lazarus here Lazar Lazarus was laying in a grave filled with death his life had left his body but even death couldn't hold him Jesus all he did was called out his name he said Lazarus come forth and inside of that grave inside of that old body that was laying there that had no life in it the real life of Lazarus came and it inhabited that body again and that body stood up and he began to walk he called him out of the grave and let me tell you this when he called him out he didn't call him out to keep him bound but he called him called him out that he could go free he didn't call him to leave him in that condition he called him that he could stand and be a free man just like he called you when God called you he didn't called you for you to be bound he didn't call you you weren't born again to remain bound you wasn't born again to let to to be uh inflicted with death in your spirit you was born again to be a free son and daughter of God and your spirit to be free of the things of the devil that would have you bound you were born to be free you were called called raised and loosed that's what God done for us today he walked out there all bound up in those grave clothes I can just see Lazarus when he come out can you imagine the scene I I know you know the story but can you imagine the scene this morning he said Lazarus come forth I can imagine here he walked out there I know some of y'all May some saw some of it this week but here was the real thing he come out there he was all bound up the Bible said his feet was bound his hands was bound with grave clothes his feet was bound with grave clothes his face was bound with a napkin with grave clothes hear this old mummified looking grave cloth rap man come walking out of the grave but that ain't the way that Jesus had intended on him being he I called you for a reason and I didn't call you to walk around like a dead man I didn't call you to limp around like a dead man I didn't call you that you couldn't speak like a man that hadn't come to Li but I called you to live I called you I raised you I called you I called you out of this place he called you out of the Grave he gave you life that you wouldn't be bound but you'd be free and Jesus looked over at him oh I can just see him standing there hear that man come out and as the crowd begin to back up in my I don't know what just happened here a man come out of the Grave did somebody check his pulse I checked his pul four days ago I checked his PA he come out there you know what Emanuel when he came out he still stunk like a dead man he still looked like a dead man he had grave clothes all over but it wasn't enough to leave him in that place but Jesus said I say loose him and let him free you know what they done they took the grave clothes off of the man they took the napkin off of his face they Unbound his feet and they Unbound his hands that he could move again he could walk a little bit he could raise his hand a little he was free to serve God loose him and let him free he said you were called raised and loosed he didn't just born it you didn't just get a new birth to stay bound but he was raised and loosed let me tell you this not only is Satan powerless before Jesus but he's also can I say it this way he's just as powerless before his name that's what the Bible said can you think of it he's even powerless before the name of Jesus well the devil don't like this I'm going to preach it I can just feel it he don't like it Oh Glory thank you Lord he don't like it I'm going to preach it you know why he's powerless before the name of Jesus you remember when Jesus sent his disciples out the 70 and they went in he said you go into every house and you witness you tell of the gospel and they went out and they laid hands on sick and the sick recovered and demons left people and they came back when they gave their testimony of all the work that had been done the Bible says when they returned with joy they said even the devils are subject to us through thy name and Jesus said I saw Satan as a lightning fall from Heaven he said behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you you me read that to you again since the devil don't want you to hear it he said I give unto you power to tread on serpents I give you power to tread on scor and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you I know what the devil does he wants to remind you of the scripture you know because Jesus did say it after all every time you hear that you know Jesus said Rejoice not that Spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven I say Amen but do you realize that the only only reason you have power over the enemy is because your name is written in heaven the only reason you have power over the devil is because of who you are that's your that's your identification you realize that having that Revelation is what causes the church to Rejoice you remember what John saw when he looked up there he said I saw him sitting upon the throne in the right hand of him that said he had a book and on the backside it was sealed with Seven Seals he said but I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I looked in all over the world there was no man that was found worthy to open the book there was no man that could loose the seal he said and I wept much because no man was worthy to find the book and neither to read the book or to even look their own but then as John was set in this place and here he found that there was no man worthy there was no man that could open the book and there's no man that could take it and there's no man that could loose it and reveal it to the people he said and then one of the elders said weep not John for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and you know what he done he turned around to see that great line he turned around to see that great warrior of the tribe of Judah and when John turned he said when I turn I saw a lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world he slain it in this in the mind of God that one day we would come down to this place that he would go before the cross of Calvary he would be slain and stripped of his life that he would stand there before the Throne of God and be victorious over the devil and take the book of life and open it to the people of God that you may know who you are said he opened the book and John said when I saw it you know what he saw he saw his name written there he said when I saw it he said everything in heaven everything in the earth everything under the Earth everything that dwell in the Seas heard I John shouting blessing and honor and glory to him and Power to him that set it upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever see why was he shouting about because he saw his name that's the same thing with you and I you know you that you know why we're why the there's so much joy in the church but because we found our name written in the book we know who you realize that's what the whole church world uh can't do they can search the whole entire Bible but they can't find their identity in the Bible you say where' your church come from well well you know it come from the book of Acts they all say that but but but then they changed the the very identification of what the book of Acts church was and try to identify with the same thing isn't that just the spirit of our world today try to be one thing and identifies another he said but there had to be a reality there had to be a real identification there has to be somebody that can look back and say that's what I am because that's the character the characteristics they have and I bear the same characteristic this morning see so they search for their identity we're all looking for this but when the book was open listen when the book came open and then Jesus CHR CHR himself came in his Spirit to reveal who you are in this end time that you're the Bride of Jesus Christ see it wasn't until the opening of these seals that you realize who the Bride of Jesus Christ was it's not talked about in the church world this isn't we're not trying to be the bride we're trying to be the church isn't that the church we're trying to be the church we're the Church of God but here when the book became open now all of a sudden the Revelation uh is open to the believer it says you're not the church you're the bride the church separated you're the C out and then you can go back into the whole scripture and you find out everything in the Bible was written about you it wasn't to talk about the church at all it was to talk about the bride that's what happened when Israel came out of Egypt it was a type of a bride being called out of a church a nation out of a Nation said you're the Bride of Jesus Christ right in the middle of this church World here's the bride here's here's my beloved here here's Mrs Jesus and you realize that because of who you are that the devil can't rule over you and then because of who you are for the Tom he has no authority over you so I can say that this morning I'm not rejoicing because because Spirits are subject to me but I'm rejoicing because I'm not subject to them because of who you are you don't have to be subject to the devil said my my name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm rejoicing because I saw my name I'm rejoicing because who I am Bible says is Rejoice ever more we got a right to Rejoice don't you realize I'm not rejoicing in my power I'm rejoicing in my Liberty I'm rejoicing in my freedom I believe we have a right to it we got a we got a right as a body of Believers to Rejoice this is what a prophet said he said Christ was sent to you the Believers and you have a right to enjoy his fellowship and His blessings and everything that he died for you've got a right to enjoy it I got news for you I enjoy the presence of God I enjoy the blessings of God I I enjoy the word of God I enjoy coming to church I I enjoy to hear the preaching of the word I enjoy gospel singing it brings a joy to me I enjoy it said you've got a right to it see n think about it if a demon Spirit an evil spirit can take a man's life completely control it till he has no control over himself then what about a Holy Spirit what would it do am I am I do I got time if what about the Holy Spirit demon Spirit can take a man into such control cause him to say things and do things now it's easy to see that we see many people like that man's demon possessed he wouldn't do that if he didn't have demons it's he's got to be demon possessed but if a demon Spirit can do it what about a Holy Spirit what about the spirit of God if it could ever get complete control of a person what would it do you think about it you you you know some of you that that that like Watchers I know brother West he's got quite the watch collection he he likes he likes Watchers you know the old old watches they used to run on a on a tension coil which was called a main spring so if you take a watch and that watch inside of it had has all sorts of Gears the old the old uh uh big grandfather clocks and the and and and alarm clocks everything used to be made this way and now of course they have mechanical or or they have automatic watches and that that are made and all this but but here these mechanical watches they were they had all these gears but the problem is is because all these gears are connected and they're connected to all the hands but the gears can never turn on their own see they had to have a power source so the old watch makers in the middle of this you can't you can't hardly see one but if you ever look at one there's a there's a there's a hundreds it seems like hundreds of of little teeth and gears all through this watch and and in the middle of it right in the center there's this tiny little button that that just looks like a little brass piece and and but inside of that brass piece is what they call a main spring and that main spring is a tension coil and so it's it's it's it's notched all the way around it and so what they do is the watchmaker as he would put that in there and of course that little piece of metal it's notched all the way around it and so it it can grab a hold of those gears with The Notches so they actually wind up that tension coil inside of a main spring until it would become so tight and what happens is as a coil is tighten it's a little science lesson but as a coil is tightened it builds up an energy that it's trying to release so it's tighten that's why a spring bounces because the energy that's built up in it by compressing it or suppressing it it's building up an energy and something in the energy eventually the Energy's got to give it's it's trying to find a place to let go or or or or the power to be able to come out of it and so as they wind it up that it it has a stored power on the inside of this main spring and as this power or this stored power as it as it begins to unwind it releases the power that's in that main spring begins to release under the mechanics of the watch and so now as that power begins to release it starts to turn and now with the Restriction in the gears that you built in it causes the hands to move a little bit so it starts to it changes time and then the the little the second hand it starts ticking why is it ticking it has no power on its own it can't control its ticking it can't control its movement but there's a mainspring on the inside of it that's releasing a power and as the power is released then the hand can't do nothing but go because it's attached to the Gear see the Power released in the mechanics it begins to move but said so this is what happens when the Holy Spirit comes in he said there's something that moves you you may not be able to understand what it is but it's a supernatural being inside of you it's moving and it's controlling your emotions it'll make you scream when you don't feel like screaming it'll make you run when you don't feel like running it'll make you shout when you don't feel like shouting it'll make you pra he said it'll make you praise God automatically you don't even have no control over it what's happening there something on the inside of you that causes you to praise God it's a power sword and inside you this power that is tore is unwinding and it's releasing its power into the mechanics of this human body and now all those mechanics that have been built up all of a sudden they begin to move differently they the alarm clock goes off and it wakes you up in the middle of the night why because there's a power on the inside of it that's releasing in the mechanics you say what is it he said it's the spring of God's grace in the middle of your heart it's controlling you making you shun evil making you leave accept life and Lead death and get away from doubt and have faith let me tell you friends we may as well have church anyway but you may not have moved in years but when you you may have been walking around you may have had your hands down you may have been tied up they may have been hanging down there both hands around 6:00 for a lot of years but all of a sudden there's a power on the inside of you and when the Master Watch makes her when he releases that power it begins to move and now those same oh let me tell you it changes you that same old hand they begin to come up in the air the ones that couldn't praise God now they begin to praise and the voice that couldn't speak now it begins to speak again the legs that couldn't move now they begin to run again why something happened on the inside of you you have no control over yourself it's a main spring it's the spring of God's grace oh my used to you walk in church you walk in and people would look at them am I here they come here sister droops and brother drab but now all of a sudden that m gets a hold of you and you get a name change now it's sister joy and brother glad something happened on the inside of you that has control over you he said that mainspring it'll make you cast down all your reasoning it'll cause you to accept God's word you go 40 years being one way but you let that main spring turn loose all of a sudden he said it's moving it's ticking it's going around and around it'll make your whole emotion come right in control with God what a marvelous thing that it is when the Holy Spirit controls you see you become a new creation that's why you can tell it's not it's not hard to identify some people say well M what discernment you have to recognize that somebody's not under the control of the Holy Spirit and they're being controlled by a demon they don't take a lot of discernment it's the characteristic of the of the flesh is is showing you what is controlling them on the inside that don't mean they're lost hello it don't mean they're not a son of God or not a daughter of God it didn't mean Lazarus was still dead he was just bound come on but it had to be something to release power see when the Holy Spirit controls you says you become a new creation because the life of Jesus Christ has took your spirit into controlling you you're a new creature and once purged it has no more desire of sin as long as you live on this Earth what the main spring does my I'm too I'm too long can I can I can I read you something this might get a little sticky but I'm going to read it to you anyway I believe y'all been here long enough I couldn't run yall said you know word the word wouldn't never run off a Believer anyway would it so you know the real Christian way is to hide everything from a brother understand this in other words don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell what you know about him is good if anything's bad let it alone I'm showing you the nature of the mainspring said the poor Fell's got enough against him anyhow don't try to take a pole and shove him in the ditch the Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch don't ever try to shove him down he's already down try to help him up too many today too many people today try to do that said if I could get something other on them that they could say was really bad then we can use that for our conversation that we can talk about how bad they are you know how it is is some they they want to hurt and tear down others said but see that's what the Pharisees done the leaders of the that day they always tried to belittle Jesus before the people they wanted to belittle him isn't that the way it is you see a brother that in a fault or a brother makes a mistake said they always they always try to tear him down and belittle him but said see but that's just the way that the devil has of working the Pharisees and the teachers they constantly try to belittle him they threw off on how they could give him what or could give to him all that that they done it they watched him constantly to find out if they could find a fault they never spoke of his good things they always finding something they could belittle him about and say see look you there if he was a man of God he wouldn't do it that way if he was a man of God he wouldn't do this he said they were always trying to cast a shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieve him that is the work of the devil always trying to find a fault in another you say well if there's a real Christian they wouldn't be doing that if if she was a real Christian she wouldn't be saying that if she's real I wouldn't have nothing to do with her if she was real why she ain't she's a hypocrite anyway they're always trying to find fault in one another he said that's the work of the devil listen friends that's the work of the devil that's not God that's the work of the devil you say well you know that's why they did with Jesus but that wasn't the end of it he said and that old scheme has never ceased many times you'll find a brother that go in and preach the gospel or do something or somebody wants to do a work that's made a mistake comes into the neighborhood and people look back and they'll go all in their path say well I heard this about them and I heard that about them I Heard they' done this so what are they doing here somebody's trying to help try to be a help even a minister trying to lead somebody the right way but the devil is going to point out to every unbeliever every so-called chrisan everything that they ever done so that they won't have confidence in them think about what he's doing say so said but what we ought to do Brethren is somebody would do something wrong then you because we're subject to do it every one of us we're subject to fall we're subject to make mistakes we're subject to to be an error and because we're all subject to be an error he said every one of us I am too but as we go along let's remember this we are brothers somebody say we are brothers can we add this in we are sisters we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ so what we ought to do if we if we have a fight well that's fine we'll just fight it out in the backyard but we ain't going to bring it out in the front we're not going to try to take them public and try to go to somebody else and tell them every mistake they did and how I think they are to handle it and how their daddy should have got them how well everybody has a a fix for everything he said but what we ought to do is hide their wrong and expose their right isin't that opposite of the the the spirit of the devil it ain't people I'm just showing you two Spirits so Jesus they tried to find every little Shadow they could find to belittle him in the sight of people and that's what the devil wants he wants to hurt your influence before people isn't that isn't that right he wants to hurt your influence before people he says so let's watch what we do walk let's walk like real men of god let's talk like men of god let's act like men of god let's live like men of God because the devil your adversary is is going about like a roaring lion trying to devour everyone that he can my isn't it something brother M they tried to belittle him you say why did they why did they want to belittle him because he had a Ministry of God why would Satan want to belittle you why why does he want to tear down the Believers because you have a Ministry of God here you are a testimony of Jesus Christ so they would take every flaw that they could find to get him out of the way they wanted him to quit they wanted him they wanted the people to denounce him they wanted him to back up they wanted him they wanted they wanted him to destroy in the towel and quit so they put all this pressure on him that he would give up a't that what the devil does so see that's what he's still doing today to put all this pressure on you so that You' just give up if you can hear what somebody said oh my God God help me but but don't come and tell me what somebody says I used to have some real good friends and they're they're friends and loved ones and and people that you love but I always love those loved ones that come and tell you what somebody else said about you I tell them to shut up I don't care I I have real good loved ones that says well you know what this person said about you I said I don't want to hear it no more you right WR it down on piece of paper put it in that box over there I'll never read it when I get time maybe I'll get to it you know why because I don't want to hear it I don't want to read about it I don't want to know what they said I don't want to know what they think it ain't nothing but an enemy using you to cause somebody's Spirit to be tore down you say oh brother Matt don't say that about me I'm not saying it about you I'm telling you it's an enemy it's an enemy it's a demon spirit that is using you causing you to make somebody feel little you say you mean the devil would do that he'll cause them to say it and he'll cause you to repeat it it same devil he'll cause them to say it and you to repeat it just so they'll feel little why so they don't feel like a daughter of God so they don't feel like a Son of God so they can't go around their brother now they can't shake their hand now they can't look him in the eye now they can't sit and have Fellowship y'all have already kicked me out so I may as well go on but now you can't even fellowship with him anymore and when did that ever become the nature of Jesus Christ it ain't the nature of Christ it's the nature of the devil if I'm the last man standing in this church I'll preach it to those walls it ain't the nature of Christ it's the nature of the devil and he's still doing it today to cause division amongst the children of God the Sons and Daughters of God but the spirit of Christ it overlooks their wrongs it overlooks their mistakes it overlooks their binding that the devil has put on their Spirit it overlooks those things and it hides their wrong and it lifts their right it's the difference of the spirit of Christ he said they'll find every little flaw they can because he wanted him to quit that's what the devil he wants you to see every little flaw in one another he wants you to quit he wants you give up he wants you to have no confidence in each other have no confidence in anybody else well I just won't talk to nobody then I'll just sit by myself cuz I can't trust nobody anyhow look what the devil's doing to you destroying your spirit you say what is he doing he's trying to bind the Free People of God trying to bind us that we can't even can't Lord help us this morning that we can't love one another like we should see what was he doing what they do in Jesus's day they were trying to keep people from getting to Christ trying to keep them the same you realize that's the same devil because he knows if he could ever keep you from getting to Christ that he can rule over you if he can ever keep you from getting to Christ men men have taken this or the devil used many men to take advantage of people in this very way they set guards up that you can't get past you can't get to Jesus because I've got a guard in the way think about it if you don't go to my church you'll never make it what is it it's it's a guard to keep you from getting to him if you're not a part of this assembly well then you're lost anyhow it's a guard to keep you from getting to him if you don't belong to this organization well then you you can't be a believer it's a guard to keep you from getting to him if you don't if you don't look like this sister or look like this brother you'll never make it it's a guard to keep you from getting to him well my my grandpa he said we ought to wear shoes like this but if you don't wear them you're going to be lost it's a guard to keep you from they build up all kinds of guards to keep you from getting to Jesus but do you realize that that there is no guard blocking you the Bible only tells us of one place that that was ever guarded and it was in it was in the Book of Genesis whenever the the fall in the garden took place and Jesus came or God came down in the garden you remember what he told him he said he when he cast them out of the garden because of the Fall he put up a chair of thems on the east side of the garden garden the gate and they had flaming swords that guarded every way to keep the way to the tree of life and at that time men had no access to that tree of life in other words eternal life they had no they had no access to it because of the fall of Man there was no access but when Christ came notice what he said brother Bobby he said I am the bread of life and any man would eat of this bread he would never die here in other words he took the guard away but man said you know what happened he said what a thrilling thought it is that the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden it couldn't be approached because of the fall of Adam but it's now given to the Overcomer you say where's that at it's in the Bible revelations 2:7 it says to him that overcometh I will live to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of my God and Bam said that flaming sword that kept you away from him has been sheathed that makes me want to shout all over this it's Sunday morning you can shout it makes you want to shout all over this building that flaming sword that kept you away from Jesus Christ or from the Tree of Life it has been sheath this morning it's not it's not moving every way the guard has been taken away therefore there ain't no man that has a right to keep you away from from Christ there's no man has a right to bind you or keep you from eternal life there ain't no man has a right to keep you from eating of this bread this Word of Life that'll give eternal life let me tell you what friends we got a right to possess it we got a right to eat it I know what we're going to do every Sunday every Wednesday every time we come in the house of God give me the word of God let me feed on it and I'm going to eat it until I get into a body change I think that's what we ought to do this morning we ought to eat oursel right into a body change eating enough word that it begins to change our body my go I feel good this morning that it'll change our Natural Body it'll take this whole body of corruption and cause it to put on incorruption said here he stands this Jesus Christ we stand before him there ain't nothing guarding him hello somebody there ain't nothing guarding him he's a he's accessible and here he stands and he stood as he stands he said notice but what does he stand for he stands for the love of God where everyone has a chance man ain't that good he stands for the love of God where everyone has a chance the love of God that's what Jesus stood for he didn't stand for laws or Creeds or affiliations or denominations but he stood for the love of God men today is constrained by the Holy Spirit to come and love him and serve him and he's seeking for such to do that God is looking for somebody who will stand out on the front line with love a't that something you want a big front liner that can Will build a sword he said but he's looking for somebody that can stand on the front line with love the nature of Jesus Christ my as a music player come see he's looking for somebody that'll stand friends if we ever get a taste of this life it changes who you are brother Weser the Holy Ghost it brings life it don't bring death it's not bringing judgment to the believer it's not bringing bondage it's not it's not trying to I was preaching it Wednesday night you know people say well when I get baptized with the Holy Ghost well maybe the Lord will take me out of here he said that ain't what we're trying to do we're not getting ready to die we're getting ready to live I don't know about the rest of the world but I know about us we're not we're getting ready to live we're we're we're he he didn't call us said see the the Holy Ghost come you ain't living until you have the Holy Ghost says so I'm getting ready to live that's the thing of it I'm getting ready to live in Christ I want to live a life that's Victorious over sin I want to live a life that's Victorious over death how many say Amen I'll give a I want to have a life that's Victorious over hell I I want to have the victory that's what the Holy Ghost is sent for to be victorious think about it he's a God that brings the dead to life that's what he does he brings the dead to life you remember what the Bible says Paul said it like this he said none of us lives to himself no man dies to himself he said whether we live or whether we die it's unto the Lord for Christ is both died and Rose and revived that he might be the Lord both of the dead and the living for on the cross he bought the whole world of people they are his a't that contrary to a lot of people's teaching said they are all his he bought the dead and the living that's why Jesus was standing in the Book of Revelations with the with those lampstands in his hand remember the church had fallen away in leoda but when you seen him standing there he still had it in his hand it was still his e even though when read and talk about how it fell away and how how how that it had gone so far but here he was standing there said but it's still his it's his those that are dead those that are alive it's still his he bought it he paid for it you think about it in the name of Christianity but the mark there's life and there's death there's so many there's a True Vine there's a false Vine there's a there's a wheat and A Tear there's a just and unjust but friends I got news for you we don't go to a dried up church we don't go to we don't go to a dead thing we're we're not looking for dead we're looking for life we don't come to church looking for dead there's so many that they dimm down the lights and they but they take it all the way down why they're trying to create this old this old atmosphere we ain't got to create that we're not trying to create the atmosphere of a death and a burial it's the atmosphere of Resurrection that we're interested in the atmosphere of life that's why we don't go to a dried up formal church that's why your pastor won't ever quit that's why that's that's why he pushes every every service to bring life to the people to to pick people up when they're down saying don't be down be up God didn't cause you to be cast down he caused you to be lifted up the word of God it wasn't meant for you to walk around all beat down and dead it was meant for you to be alive to be a living testimony of the word of God we're not looking for dead we're looking for life let me tell you a secret I'm I'm I'm going to make this statement you can't find life everywhere you can't find life everywhere sometimes see sometimes people go they go to dead places looking for life and then they're shocked cuz they couldn't find any life there can you imagine going into a dead church trying to find life there's no life in it oh some old dried up denomination somewhere that's ran by a bunch of men but there's no life in there ain't no moving of the Holy Ghost what is it it's because it's a place of the dead and we're looking for something that's alive amongst the dead I can prove that when the when they went to the supper that day and Jesus was laying in the Tomb remember he had already resurrected and when they came out came to the supper they they prepared they found that the stone was rolled away and when they entered in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus and the Bible said it came to pass that they were perplexed in other words they were completely baffled you see I could see the confusion Destiny because they were looking for a dead thing amongst the dead and found it missing how would a dead thing be missing where could it go so you could see the the confusion when you're looking for dead among dead and you don't find it the dead is missing it causes confusion but there's no need to be confused when you're searching for living things among dead and you don't find it see there's no need to be confused because the living thing isn't dwelling among the dead to see you come into a you can go into a dead place and say well I can't find life and I can't find Christ what's going on I'm so confused I'm so perplexed to this but it shouldn't cause us to be perplexed cuz you're not going to find living among the Dead the Bible says here when they were confused he said as they were afraid they said the angel said to them why seek you the living among the dead see they were looking for a dead thing they were looking for history looking for something that was going on something that was that was passed they had to be informed that what you're searching for it's not dead but it's alive had somebody come inform them now you're dwelling in the wrong place because you've been coming here all this time you come to you come to to to to find him but you'll never find him here again this is a place where dead things lay but life has left it so stay out of the dead and go find the life get out of the graveyard and go among the land of the living and find he that is living said what you're searching for is alive see when you search for life in a dead place and you don't find it don't be alarmed just get away from the dead place to go where there's life and search for Life there and you'll be sure to find it let me tell you friends you know why cuz say that because we're not among the dead this morning we're among the living and among the living you know what I expect to see life God's church is a Living Church we're alive we're not a bunch of dead people we're not a bunch of a dead religion but you're God's free men and women and you're living you've been called out by God you've been raised from the death of this sin the death of this world and you've been resurrected to life and as you stand to your feet this morning let me tell you you was raised for a purpose you was raised to do the work of God God you wasn't raised to be bound you wasn't raised to be tormented you was raised to be free so I wonder if there's somebody here this morning that could lift your hand and say brother may I want to be free I don't want nothing to bind me I see how the spirit of the enemy would come in and try to bind my spirit against my brother or my sister but I rebuke you devil in the name of Jesus Christ you have no authority over these Believers we got a right to be free you got a right to put your arm around your brother and around your sister and say I love you and me it from your heart you got a right to it the devil's a liar God's word is true you got a right to it let's bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord the power of God in this building Lord we realize that you come to set us free as a body of Believers Lord we stand as free men and women God knowing how the enemy would come to bind and God caused those to be so bound up in their Spirit but God may we find this this little simple thought this morning that we weren't raised to be bound but we were bound to be free God may you may you bring that Liberty to every heart God may you take every Spirit Lord God that's been binding these children these Sons and Daughters of God God maybe some spirit that is that's been tormenting them that old Tormentor but Lord we just ask you this morning God as Jesus looked at that demon and said you have no right God we look across this congre ation this morning and that same demon recognizing the power of almighty
