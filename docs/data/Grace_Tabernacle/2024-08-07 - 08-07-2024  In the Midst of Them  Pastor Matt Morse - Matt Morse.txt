amen amen amen won't you reach around Shake somebody's hand tonight welcome in the house of the Lord and amen we just love the Lord how many loves the Lord amen how many loves his word amen it's just good to be in the house of the Lord amen so we we want to invite you to the scripture to the Book of Revelation and we're going to read out of the first chapter and we'll start in the 10th verse and read down through the 16th verse Revelations one and we'll read in the 10th verse just give you a moment to to get there and and just be praying about the the youth meetings uh was messaging with brother Nathan he kind of puts that uh or heads up the meeting at brother Wayne's Church there in Ohio and uh we're expecting a real move of the Holy Ghost amen so y'all I I I know that's needed and especially in in every in every hour it's needed but especially today I don't know of a greater need uh then a moving of the spirit of God amongst the young people amen so just want to keep that near to our heart tonight as as we go so I just want to speak out of Revelations the first chapter and we'll start in the 10th verse the Bible said and I I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in the book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus samna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and un Le oosa and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man he was clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool and as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass and they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and we'll just ask the Lord to add his blessing upon the reading of the word tonight now I won't be able to preach all this tonight but as you take your seats uh I I would like to speak if uh just just for the sake of the brother and the uh the the the video if they could maybe have a title in the midst of them but I'd like to take a portion of this as we've been speaking um over over the Revelation and and and the purpose of Revelation in the church and we took several Services uh going in this direction and uh and the Lord willing we'll we'll try to take uh this portion of scripture and maybe take some different things things out of it each uh Wednesday that we that we're able to speak and and and kind of go in that direction and U but but we realize that uh as we've been speaking on this on Revelation and the church is growing and and uh going into the place where God wants us to be I I I really believe this tonight I believe that the church can only go as high as its Revelation I believe that's our uh that that that is our limitation is the Revelation that we have and and I also believe that the Revelation comes by the spirit of God and so if God is going to take us to new heights and he's going to continue to take the church into this uh uh place that God wants to take us into then it'll take the spirit of God I believe that's why brother brandham preached so many messages concerning the spirit of God many times he would preach a message called being led by the spirit or or the leading of the spirit he preached on spiritual food in due season he preached on on the manifestation of the spirit he preached on getting into the spirit so many times this was a uh this was a real theme in his ministry was the spirit of God God moving amongst the Church of God and and even whenever John would write this when he wrote in the Book of Revelation first John would say I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice so here before you even see the revelation of what John was writing we realize that first if it took John getting in the spirit in order to ride it then what's it going to take in order for you to see it see so if he had to get in the spirit to ride it then it'll take you getting into the spirit in order to receive the revelation of it so brother R would say this he said see the kingdom of God is established in the heart and the soul of a man by the revelation of Jesus Christ how many believe that the kingdom of God is established in the heart of man by the revelation of Jesus Christ for he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so in other words it was upon this Revelation he says see so it's going to take a revelation for you to get there and to have a revelation then you have to become a Believer and if you're going to be a believer then there'll be signs that follow what you believe say well how's it be because the same things that Jesus done the church would do because she is what he was see whenever you read about Christ and see what what was Christ in the scripture brother Jared you'll find that Christ he was the Messiah he said he the he but what is the Messiah the Messiah is the kingdom of God it was the anointed ones it was brother said the Messiah today is the kingdom of God anointed ones them Anointed with the same spirit that God or that Jesus was anointed with so if he was called the Messiah which he was because he was anointed with the Holy Spirit then any church that's Anointed with the same Holy Spirit today is a messiah they're a little or a smaller God and someday when this body is resurrected he said I hope beforehand I hope before we get to this place that God can get a hold of a bunch of people that'll manifest his power in every Dimension that it's supposed to be in I thank God that God would send somebody to remind the church that he's calling the church to something else it's something greater than the things that that's going on around us and these little the little things and the little trials and the little tribulation and the little pressures and the and the little Temptations and the things that all the world gets so wrapped up in and they cause these these great marches and great uh uh these great movements and things just some little thing that would happen but here a prophet of God would take the church and say but when the spirit of God comes to the church and a church has the same spirit that Christ had that church would be the very Messiah it would be the kingdom of God that came into the heart of Believers to see so the spirit of God is what allows you to overcome says so it'll take the spirit of God it'll allow you to overcome the church how many believe this today that we are a spiritual church how many say that with me we're a spiritual church we're a spiritual people I realize when you look around this world today you find out that people are bound by carnality people are bound by the Flesh and you know they're they're Bound by uh by the things that goes on in this flesh but we realize that that that in this carnality that we as a people in our flesh have been living under this law called The Law of sin and death how many's familiar with it we've been living under this law we've been we we've been bound under this law and you realize that the law of sin and death that it was actually the law over flesh in other words it was the law of sin and death it binds you to flesh in fact the there was a flesh act that caused the curse of the law to come upon the people of God so so you see this is this is the law that we've been bound under there there's so much pressure and all the things that come upon your flesh it's because of this law the things that we battle in our carnal mind it's because of this law and in and in this flesh life that we live in but you realize what the Bible says is that the church isn't to follow after the flesh but the Bible gave us an escape from the flesh so I I thank God that here that we we realize that because of our flesh birth and because of our nature that we're with that we're in all of this and we're in this great battle and there's this great carnality and this war that's going on but then when you'd open up your Bible it would show an escape path it says see Paul said see the church he said there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirit so here here Paul says we have a release from condemnation and that release is is to don't follow after the flesh but follow after the spirit of God don't mind the things of the flesh but mind the things of the spirit keep your heart not set on the things of the flesh but keep your heart set upon the spirit of God he said it'll release you from condemnation it it releases you from bondage it releases you from the the pressures and things that keep you so wrapped up that you can't even worship God and you you can't really be a believer and you can't really manifest what what you want to manifest and you you don't you don't have the joy in your salvation and you know there's something that just kind of keeps you down and and you know you're a Christian and you know you're a Believer but but there's something that just won't let you break through and really show the joy that you feel on the inside of you but Paul said but here's a release from all of that to not walk after the flesh but walk after spirit I think it ought to be the call of the church today is to mind spiritual things it's a call to the church to follow after the spirit of God for Paul he said see the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free somebody say free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do because it was weak through the flesh but God sending his own son in the likeness of Flesh condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us I think this is a powerful scripture he said the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us see many many times when you read this scripture you in Romans 8:4 but when you read this it looks like that that that when Paul says the righteousness of the law it looks like that in this law there is righteousness laying there it looks like that there in other words that the law possesses righteousness because he says the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled but that's see that's what they taught that's what Judaism taught and in the in the time of Paul it was taught that this righteousness came from the sacrifice that you made in other words there was uh that in the sacrifice lay righteousness and it's what that that's why that men could go out and they could make a sacrifice and they in in any other way they could live it didn't matter as long as they made their sacrifice and every every month they came before the priest and they they they done the duty as they should do but because their righteousness laid in the sacrifice but whenever Christ came he pointed to him that this is a this is a dead religion this is a th this isn't this isn't the children of God this isn't what God's calling us to he's calling you to a new nature he's calling you to a New Life it ain't going through some ritual the the righteousness don't love in the law that you're trying to live he said that that ain't where it is and in fact when you read this scripture when you read it correctly you'll find this word righteousness it comes from a Greek word called uh di Yoma which actually means a righteous deed or a righteous act so when you read this it's showing us that it wasn't that that it wasn't that the righteousness was in the law but it was actually speaking of the act of righteousness or a deed of righteousness so so when you read this uh scripture you realize that never that never did a sacrifice ever make a righteous act so think about Paul's talking about a righteous Act of the law might be fulfilled in you but never answer when when did a sacrifice ever make a righteous act when did a when did a lamb ever go and and be sacrificed on his own free will when did a goat ever go and say it was on my own will this was the desire of my heart was was to to to to to make this sacrifice but never was there a willing sacrifice but when it came to Jesus everything changed cuz remember when Jesus when he went and he talked to the father he said Lord if that be possible let this cup pass from me but then he went on and said but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done here he was willing in his flesh to allow the will of God to take over his life do you realize what happened here here when he said this Brother Kyle all of a sudden now we have a righteous act we have we have a man that would surrender his own life willingly it it was an act of righteousness it was something that he knew brother bam said it was on his mind he knew what was going to happen to him he he knew that he was going to Calvary he knew that he was going to Gethsemane he knew that he would go to Pilot's judgment Hall he he knew that he would be beaten and mocked he knew that his great gifts would be put on trial he knew those things but he continued to walk he continued to walk in the in in in the vision that the father had showed unto him because brother brother Morgan it was it wasn't the men that was driving him you realize it was a righteous act that was walked up calvary's hill it wasn't the beating that made him take another step it wasn't the whips that they had behind him that forced him to take another step it it wasn't nobody pushing him that caused him to continue to walk it it wasn't because he was was afraid that caused him to go in that way but you realize that he went to make a sacrifice so that the spirit of Life Could dwell in humanity again listen what Christ was doing you you remember brother I'm telling the story even though a sacrifice was accepted accepted by God don't don't mean that it was a righteous act you you realize that when Adam or that it was a willing act but when Adam took when he when he went took that sacrifice he said he took an old grape vine around his neck and that by that grap Vine he dragged it down to an altar and he bound it and and and he took his life but that ain't the way Christ went to Calvary he went willingly he took a it was a righteous act and brother brother Kyle it wasn't just that the spirit of God would be alive it was so that it would dwell in humanity it was a place to bring the spirit of God upon the people of God that he could dwell in their midst and it wasn't just see many has taken this well well he came to the Jews he was was born of the Jews but notice it wasn't just to the Jews but he came to open a door to the Gentiles that by this righteous act that this gentile people could possess the spirit of God now that makes me want to shout that he came to the Gentiles that this righteous act could possess by this righteous act that we could possess the spirit of God I think it's something to think about of how that we realize that this act of sacrificing that that that this was something that the Jewish people were accustomed to do you realize that sacri sacrifices they weren't made by everyone in the world it wasn't this was this is what God had raised his people to this is the law that he had given to the Jews and and they went out and they made sacrifices according to the law of Moses but but the gentile people they were outside the temple they weren't they weren't in making sacrifices but when Christ came he came from the Jews to the gentile people you can you can find this in the Bible it's a it's a perfect type in the story of Jonah you notice when God called Jonah he said go into Nineveh he said the Lord came to him go to Nineveh this great City and cry out against it for their wickedness has come up before me butam said notice what this was he said I think the principal reason that I believe God did this great thing is because Jonah was a Jew he said the reason he said so he asked him to go to a gentile City and to cry out against it thinking that he would he would not be received because the Gentiles would say what's this Jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that God not only is he the god god of the Jew but he's also the god of the Gentile he's a God of all people so God just chose the Jews he says see the Jews they were called they were God's chosen people but they were chosen for a specific cause and that cause was to give them the law and they could not keep it he said that was the purpose of God calling them God chose them to give them the law and they couldn't keep the law that God gave them and he used them and he showed by that people that the law could not be kept and that he was the god of righteousness so here God would use these people that that they would go through this time Brother Kyle and they would live this life they couldn't keep the law he said but he would this law it would demand righteousness but they weren't able to keep it it would demand it of them but there was no Grace in it to bring a man out of it he said the penalty was paid there was no penalty paid by the law but it would take Grace to pay the penalty that the law had put us under that's why Paul would take this and he would say speaking of Christ he would say that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who who who would the righteousness of the law be fulfilled in he said those who walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirit so here Paul lays this for the Believers that we are a spiritual people and if we those that walk after the spirit he said because we are after The Flesh those that are after The Flesh they mind the things of the flesh but the spirit mind the things of the spirit but to be carnally minded is death but spiritually minded his life because the carnal mind is an enemy against God and it is no not subject to the law of God and it can't be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but you're in the spirit how many say Amen if so the spirit of God dwelleth in you and if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his isn't that wonderful if the spirit of God dwelleth in you cuz that's the that's the battle that we get into as Believers am I in the flesh or am in the spirit am I am I minding the things of the flesh am I minding the things of the spirit I I have a job and I try to focus on taking care of my family so does that mean I'm minding the things of the Flesh and no no it ain't got nothing to do with it here he said if the spirit of Christ dwelleth in you then you are not in the flesh but in the spirit that's what it takes is the spirit of God to dwell in you see many many call theirselves Christians they call Believers around the world but I believe this today I believe we have a Bible standard of what a believer is I believe in the spirit of God how many say amen I believe that spirit that that real believers they follow after the spirit of God I believe in the Holy Ghost I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I I don't believe in anointing of the Holy Ghost I believe in the indwelling of the Holy Ghost I believe that God can come down and dwell in the heart of a man in the soul of a man and he can change that man's nature and he can change his life and he can take the desires of the flesh out of his life and that man can have victory over the flesh by the power of the spirit of God I'm here to today I can tell you as a testimony that God can change your desire I can tell you as a testimony that God can change your flesh I can tell you as a testimony that God can change the way you see things and the way that you see people and the way that you view one another God can change it by the spirit of God not by the flesh will we ever get to where we need to be but by the spirit we'll get just to where God wants us to be I believe that today I believe we ought to take a stand to be able to serve God I believe that's what God's called us to we got a right to serve him we've got a we got a right to stand upon the things you don't mind if I take my coat off do you we got a right to stand upon the things of God but you know what happens is whenever you take a stand to serve God don't don't think for a minute that you say well brother Matt I want to do this I I I want to live this life I want the spirit of God to dwell in me I I want to live a life after the spirit I want to I want to be pleasing unto God but whenever you make this stand it it's always met with adversity I can't find a person in the scripture that ever followed the Lord that didn't have some adversity or didn't have have some trial or some sickness or some loved one or some problem things that were always uh that there's always something an adversity to doing something for the Lord how many believes that how many testify that it's there's always an adversity to meet even in the world you you you go stand up and say I'm going to serve God and the world will meet you with all kinds of things they'll meet you with every unbeliever that there is will will come by and tell you everything that's wrong in the church you get a you get a little I'm going to preach to you a minute but you get a little bit of a spirit on you and get a a little bit of stayhome spirit on you well you know I just don't feel like going to church right now you know got a lot of things going on and you know and I I don't know if I really want to follow through with this and you you just better believe it when you go to the the Dollar General that somebody's going to meet you and say you know what I can't believe that anybody goes down there that that place anyway you know there ain't nothing but but trouble down there you know them people ain't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites you better believe that the devil's going to find you when you go down the road to to so to water the seed that he planted did you hear me to water the seed that Satan planted in your in your mind see they're going to laugh at you they'll scoff you they'll ridicule you they'll poke at you they'll they'll make fun of you you you I I promise you you go to telling people that you believe in the power of the Holy Ghost you're going to meet an unbeliever you're going to meet a scoffer you're going to you're going to meet a loved one you're going to have a sister that'll they that'll tell you you're crazy you go tell somebody you believe in Divine Healing somebody's going to tell you that you've lost your mind there's always somebody that's an adversary to what you believe we have an adversary and he he anoints people and he and he he leads them to to to follow after the things that are ungodly you you tell them you believe in Holiness you're going to meet scoffers you tell them you're waiting on a Rapture you're going to meet unbelievers they're going to laugh and make fun out you but let me tell you what it'll never affect the believer hello somebody it'll never affect the believer you know why because I know that unbelievers just as much as I fulfill the scripture as a believer that the unbeliever is fulfilling the same Bible that I'm fulfilling do you realize that every scoffer is talked about in the Bible every m Believers talked about in the Bible every every every every unbeliever every critic they're talked about in the Bible all of those that would come against you they're talked about in the Bible so just like you are the scoffers are fulfilling scripture too that's what the Bible said Peter said know this first he said there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust and you know what they'll do brother Travis they got their own message too they'll come out and they preach their own message you say they got a message that's what Peter said he said and they'll be saying where is the prom promise of his coming man isn't that something to think there's scoffers in this world and they're walking around just like you and I and saying I don't believe that nonsense but we've been hearing about this Rapture for for 50 years and ain't never seen no sign of it we've been hearing about the Lord coming back our whole life and we've never seen no sign of it but Peter said know this first scoffers will walk among you and they'll be saying this that where is the sign of his coming where's the promise of his coming since our fathers have fell asleep everything continues as it was but Peter said but know this thing he said they are willingly ignorant you know what that means it means that they lack knowledge or awareness he said they willingly are ignorant that by the word of God that the heavens and the Earth were formed willingly they are ignorant that it was God that came in the days of Noah and he destroyed the Earth by water and willingly they are ignorant that it's the same God by his same word that with that that upholds this world today and that's the only reason that the world is standing and willingly they are ignorant ignorant that it is reserved for fire of judgment against those that are enemies to God or unbelievers Peter said there willingly ignorant of this thing he said but but but my beloved but don't be ignorant of this one thing that a day with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is a day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise to us he said but he's longsuffering that not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance a't that something they're looking at it one way but Peter said but here's the reality of it God is a merciful god and every day that he gives us is a sign of his Mercy every year that goes by if we go on into 20 25 or 26 or 27 down the road into every year that God gives up upon this Earth is just another sign of the mercy of God of the the longsuffering mercy of almighty God that mean that's why scoffers they don't discourage Believers because they're fulfilling scripture see it's predicted that's the that's the reason people are acting the way they're acting in the world today is because the Bible says they would do it why is the country in the shape it's in well the Bible says it would be that way why is the world in the shape it's in the Bible said it would be that way see as Believers we expect it because the Bible says it can I read it he Paul said in the last days they'd be heady and high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they'd be truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof and from such turn away see so if the Bible says it some 2,000 years ago Paul wrote this in the scripture so that when I see these things going on I don't have to stand here discouraged but brother Joe in fact when I see the world falling apart it encourages me to know that what God Said is true when I see people in the condition that they're in it encourages me that the word of God is true when you see those that are truce Breakers and heady and high-m minded and the lovers of pleasure that it encourages you in in your faith in the word of God that the word of God is true their fulfillment of the scripture see everybody has a place in scripture every believer they're in the Bible how many say Amen every unbeliever they're written about in the Bible you can't get away from it every scoffer they're in the Bible every critic they're in the Bible every every fighter every guilty one they're in the Bible every innocent they're in the Bible the the false the true the failure the Overcomer everyone has their place in the Bible it's all written about before you and I was ever born it was all seen before the foundation of the world and it don't matter what you are it was written about in this Bible you can turn from the ways of God but you was wrote about in the Bible you can serve other gods but you was wrote about in the Bible you can be an unbeliever but you was wrote about in the Bible oh friends let me tell you if you're going to fulfill it if you're going to fulfill second Timothy 3 and 2 you was wrote about in the Bible if you're he and high minder and a lover of the flesh you was wrote about in the Bible you'll never be able to escape it for the Bible says all of these things would take place and the Bible speaks of you no matter what you do or for who you are the Bible speaks of you it it speaks concerning you no matter what kind of person you are it speaks concerning you you're fulfilling scripture ain't that something that no matter what you do you're fulfilling scripture no matter who you are you can't get away from it well I don't believe the Bible I don't believe that n well you're fulfilling your scripture see but I think if we're going to fulfill scripture we ought to fulfill some different scriptures I know I've said this before but if you're going to fulfill a scripture why not fulfill acts 237 the Bible says when they heard the word they were pricked in their heart and they said what should we do to be saved see if you're going to fulfill a scripture won't you fulfill John 1:12 he said but as many as received Christ to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name if you're going to fulfill a scripture anyway fulfill Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne if you're going to fulfill a scripture why don't we fulfill Revelations 19 the Bible said and the bride hath made herself ready if you're going to fulfill his scure don't let your testimony be that of the unbeliever don't let your testimony be that of the scoffer or that of the critic or that of the make believer but if you're going to fulfill scripture let your testimony be of David when he said My Flesh and my heart May Fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever the Bible covers us all this flesh may fail my heart May Fail but God is my portion this Bible is the only thing there is but a cow that covers everything in our life it answers aners every question that we ever have it's the only thing that we can ever live by that won't lead us astray it's the only place you can ever get advice from that it won't lead you down the wrong road and it's still true and it's still powerful and it was still inspired by God and it still means the same today it's more relevant today than it was the day it was wrote it's God's word and it it's it's something that we ought to read it don't ever get old you and I get old we get weaker in our flesh we we get we get down in our flesh the older we get but let me tell you something about an etern God he don't ever get old he don't ever get weak he don't ever lose his power This Is Our God he's grow he he's the same God that he's always been he's still standing in the power of His might doing the same work that's our almighty God the same Jesus that walked on water is walking amongst the church today he's never lost his power let me tell you if God don't get old the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you know what that tells me that if God get old then his word don't get old either it's still relevant today it still means something today it's the word of God but B said 2,800 years they've been reading this read by men and Priests and it never grows old I've been reading it for 35 years and AG time I read it I find something new that I looked over the first time because it is inspired it is God in letter form it's the attributes of God speaking forth and it's placed on paper now isn't that good the attributes of God being placed on paper I thought that was good you know I think about these brothers we go out and shooting up our shooting our guns and you know you ever went and SED in a rifle but Morgan he's he's pretty good but you know if a guy goes out and he takes his rifle out there and it needs the sights tuned in and he just goes out and fires it up in the air three or four shots but a man can you fix my rifle I don't know if it's hitting or not well neither do I see he's just shooting up in the air well can you can you side it in well there's no way to to S it in because there's nothing to judge it by see so it's just shooting out in the air and say well I think that one may have went a little right I'm not sure maybe that one went a little left I I don't know but see if you really want to s in a rifle then you got to take a piece of paper and on that paper you put a Target on it so see them whenever you go to Fire and at the Target then you can look at the paper and when you see the paper you can say well you're about three inches to the right and and and you're dead center you're a little high see because it's on the paper I thought that was good cuz B said this is the attributes of God and they're placed on paper I thought isn't it something what God done he gave us a Target something that when you're trying to manifest or display the attributes of God and you really want to be a believer that God gave something to be able to Target by and something that we could hone in or we could s in by that we're not just shooting out in the air and say well maybe this will be pleasing to God and maybe maybe God likes it people act this way and maybe maybe well I may as well preach it but maybe maybe God maybe maybe god'll accept this but no but he put it on paper that we would that we would be able to read it don't ever don't ever uh uh uh take and and disregard the Bible that God has given us don't I know it's it's become less in the house of Congress and it's become less in the court of law and it's become less in the schools and it's become less in the churches but I thank God that there's still a people that would take a hold of the Bible of God's word and say it's the attributes of God it's been placed on paper it's how we can use it it's the very thing we can use as a Target to to hone our life in I I think that's what we ought to do tonight I think we ought to get back to God's Target I think we ought to get back to the Bible I think we ought to get back to a five-fold Ministry and back to Ephesians 4 and back to to people that will take hold of the word of God and manifest the attributes of God it's written on paper it's God's attributes so see he wrote it there and then he would come do you realize this is the purpose this is the purpose of every of every messenger that God has ever sent do I have just a few minutes every messenger that God has sent you realize that that that's what they were called for in every age I I think this is something that here that that although each age they battled different things there was different there was different battles different struggles and things that were going on but the answer was always the same it was the same Jesus it was the it was the same one to turn to you can see this in John's Vision in Revelations 2 he said these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand remember the vision that he saw and now he's beginning to speak he said who walketh in the midst of the the seven golden candlesticks said see these seven candlesticks we know that they represent the seven Church ages but but said see there he is the savior he's walking in the midst of the churches throughout the Seven Ages what he was in the first age he is in all ages man what an image that this is Christ walking among the amongst the ages said see here he is to every believer he's the same Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he's still doing it and he will keep on doing it why because see no well who was it see the answer is he said notice that it was Jesus Christ Alone that was walking in the midst of his churches it was he so it's not it's not some new thing or some new doctrine but it was always the same Christ It Was the Same Spirit it was it was a word to the church it was the Turning of the hearts of the people back to him said see it couldn't be nobody else it must have been him so it was he alone that worked her salvation speaking of the church it was he alone that purchased her with his own blood that's why I used say why was it him that was walking amongst this when John saw this vision and here these seven CH these seven candlesticks which represented Seven Ages he saw this one that was walking in the midst of them he said why was it him he was showing that it was him that he had power over it it was showing that it was him that had in his control he was he never left it alone he you realize he never left the church and and to wander through an age by herself he said but he Pur her with his own blood he's her Lord and her master he alone he will he will we give Glory and Honor he'll not share it with anybody it's him and him alone my a it something that wasn't Jesus and a pope standing in amongst the candlesticks it wasn't a a bishop or or an Archbishop or some Pastor or something like that or some great man but it was Jesus Christ and Jesus alone he said what this ought to show us is he'll not share this with anybody he he ain't going to share it with a pastor he won't share his glory with a pope he won't share it with a bishop he won't share it with a priest he won't share it with a prophet and he won't share it with an Ang Ang it's Jesus Christ and he alone and he's standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks here he would anoint a prophet of God to declare this under the church to recognize who it was in the midst of the church who is working in the church today he said it's he alone he don't speak and turn to the father because he was the father he didn't turn and give orders to the holy spirit because he was the Holy Spirit it was he alone the very God of creation that was walking it was the godhead dwelling in this one in this man Jesus Christ and he was walking amongst the candlesticks showing that he's in every Church age the same Jesus he said notice what he's doing it's him and and and it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life for salvation is of the Lord man ain't that good there was no one with him when he T down the fierceness of the Wrath of the fiery furnace he said there was no with him it was not another but it was him who hung on the cross and gave gave his blood he's the author and the finisher of our faith he's the Alpha and the Omega of our Salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him it was he alone my isn't this a powerful Revelation that our relationship is between you and Jesus Christ he's who we married he he's who this is the spirit that that Christ wants you to have he said it's he alone his word is law Creeds dogmas B constitutions they have no effect on us because it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is God in her willing and doing of his good pleasure don't ever forget that don't ever forget that that it's Jesus Christ alone that's walking in the midst of the church don't ever forget that that it's Christ Alone that is walking in our midst do you realize you only have one relationship to God and God has one relationship to you he said it's Jesus and Jesus alone this is what John saw he said there he is in the Seven Stars in his right hand and here this right hand notice in his right hand there were seven stars now this right hand said notice it would it would signify that there was power and the authority of God I'm just going to lay this in here and I I won't hold you but there was power and authority in God it was a right hand of power this come from Psalms 44 remember David said for they got not the land in possession but by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand thine arm thy light of thy countenance because thou had favor with them so here here here whenever John's writing this and saying it that here the Seven Stars were in his right hand you can read psalms 44 and recognize what it signifies it signifies that they were in the power of God so when he had them in his right hand he said see it was his right hand of power they were seven stars and and you say well who was it well according to Revelations 1:20 he Jesus actually tells us what they were he said it was the seven Church age Messengers these Seven Stars represented the seven Messengers to the church he says see so it signifies that the power or the authority of God is behind the messenger to every age friends that's quite a revelation to have that the power and the authority of God is behind every messenger that's why whenever John saw him in this right hand of power that he was holding these Seven Stars he said it was to show that the power behind every messenger came from the power of God it was his authority it was behind them so they go forth in the fire and the power of the Holy Ghost and in the word you say you say well why why were they represented as stars there's so much in here but why were they Stars it see because Stars they actually reflect light see the stars what a star is is in our darkest hour it's when there a star shines the greatest in the you you go out in the middle of the day you can't hardly see a star you know but but you let it get closer to night and then Darkness begins to creep on and in the middle of the night when you go out away from City you ever notied that in the absence of light is when you can see stars the greatest you go out and and you live in a big city or go visit a big city they they they hardly see what we see out here in in Old Country place where we live but you can go out in one of these fields and just and see the greatness and the vastness of God and all these wonderful stars that God has made and see it's because in darkness is when is when stars shine the greatest so see so in the absence of the Su we see these stars and they're the star become greater see and it's the same way it is with Christ in the absence of the Corporal body of the s o n then God would send a star to shine in a time of Darkness see see so here they are they're represented as stars and while we're here here remember because Christ ascended so he would send back this as stars to the age they would they would light the age and so here these seven Messengers they are making God known before the people isn't it something I don't have time to get into the science of it tonight but just to I'll just lay this you can go look it up if you want to but I thought it was something that whenever you look at these Stars it took a while for science to be able to find this out whenever they had the ability to be able to look at a star but when you look at a star they actually how they identify the Sun as a star is they realize that the very things that the sun puts off the the hydrogen or the different uh uh chemicals or or elements that that are of the sun when they look through a telescope is the same elements that those Stars put off I thought isn't that something that's how they're identified as a star because in them is the very same thing that's in the sun it's the same elements that that that gives life to us is the same elements that's in every Star that's what makes it a star say see so here here here these Messengers would come it's going to be the same elements as as as Christ the same thing that was in Jesus Christ would be in his messenger or otherwise you would be able to identify well that ain't a messenger of Christ because it ain't the same thing that's got to be a moon that's got to be a planet that's got to be something else because it don't manifest the same thing that the sun puts off say see so they were stars because they reflect that same kind of light it's the same Light Of The Sun It's a lesser light of a greater light you see when ever so he sends these stars and you know I know that many would look at this today and they'd say well you know I I have a hard time receiving that you realize that people's biggest hangup the in today is to receiving the message that God sends is actually receiving the messenger that God sent to bring it it's not really the message itself it's because you say that a messenger brought it but you realize I I I can say this openly that I Reed the messenger that God sent how many can say that I received the messenger that God sent let me tell you why I can say that so boldly because Jesus said in John 13:20 verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so if you can't receive who God sins or who Christ would sin well then you couldn't even receive Christ so here he tells us that by receiving whom I sin that you're receiving me so it's not some foreign thing to believe that God would send somebody or he would send a a five-fold Ministry or he would send a messenger to the church here Jesus would say I'm going to send you out I'm going to anoint you I'm going to fill you with my spirit you're going to go manifest the very life the very things that I've done you shall do and people will believe on you for the works that you've done and by believing you they'll believe me think of this the very thing that they have it would manifest Jesus Christ so they speak and they act upon his authority and he stands behind them with all the power of the godhead you said well how do you know he stands behind them well let me just tell you what Jesus said Matthew 28:18 he said Jesus came and spake unto them he said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations in heaven and baptize them in in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world how do you know that he with them because he said I will be with you always even unto the end of the world said see what was it it was to the consummation of all ages to the end of the world he said I will be with them so it didn't matter if it was a messenger 2,000 years ago if it's a messenger today Jesus said I'll be with you until the end of the world why would he tell the disciple I know what the the the the churches say the church world says well he was just telling that to his disciples why would he tell his disciples those those few that were with him him that I'll be with you till the end of the world I don't know any one of them that's alive today and if you believe that join you may as well sign up with the Elvis Bunch because they but they're not alive today walking around the earth doing these works of God but he said I'll be with you until the end of the world who is he speaking of those disciples The Messengers the ones that he was sent the sent ones the ones that God sins he promised to be with them he promised in every age but says see so there they are they're full of the Holy Ghost and Faith they're on fire with the fire of God they're holding forth the word of Truth and there he stands to back them up brother Kyle not just in the first age but in every age he said think of it that's why that we don't as any believer not one of us has to look back to another age and cry in our heart and say oh Lord that I could have just lived back in that first age when the apostles were sent out he said there ain't no need to look back just look up and behold him who is even now walking in the midst of the church through all the ages it ain't time to look back it's time to look up I think that's what we ought to do tonight I think we need to quit looking back and look up and Behold Him Behold Him who is present he's the same yesterday today and forever Behold Him who promised he would be in the midst of the church Behold Him who said where two or three are GA together in my name there shall I be in the midst of him I think we need to quit looking around and looking back and looking at our problems and looking at our failures and looking at everybody else's fault and look up and behold him that is in the midst of the church today it is Jesus Christ and Christ alone and he's walking amongst the Believers we are in the spirit of him we're in the spirit of God why because the spirit of God lives in us we're not walking after the flesh we're walking after the spirit Behold Him as the music players would come tonight he said see he's in their midst and this is a good thing he said but they're not he's not in their midst as an onlooker glory to God Jesus is in our midst brother the Tom but he's not in our midst as a complacent onlooker but there he's not even in our midst as a recording angel I know that's what a lot of people do they're just kind of in the midst of everybody as a recording Angel they're just making a record of everything everybody does said but that's not what he's doing here I don't know about you but that that made me feel good but the cow that he's not he's not in our midst as a recording angel record all your faults and all your mistakes and errors and to to make a book of all your failures that's not what his purpose is here he said but here he is in our midst he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church that's what he's doing in our midst he's walking among us we don't have to look we don't have to look back said but look up look up it's him that is walking in our midst how meaningful are those words when View vied in the light of the scripture for Christ is our life he's the life of the church she has no other life without him she's simply a religious Society or a club or a meaningless Gathering of people as a corpse Bejeweled is still a corpse so the church no matter what programs and her gracious efforts she might achieve but without a Christ without Christ it's still a corpse but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth All In and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last ages golden Candlestick IM this something here we are represented we we have a Candlestick in our age but in the last age in the midst of our Candlestick that same Jesus is Walking In This Very hour what he was then as he walked in the first stage even he is now in this last stage he's the same yesterday today and forever want you to stand to your feet tonight the golden candlesticks here we stand so pure can I read this as I close says see why would he use a Candlestick to type this he said see this is what Moses used when he talked about a Candlestick in Exodus he said remember what God told him to put in the Tabernacle said Thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold and a beaten work shall the Candlestick be made shafts branches and bowls and knops and flowers shall be the same it'll be a beaten work this is what God demanded that this Candlestick he said see the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold he's been made more than conquerors if you want to said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold and her righteousness is his righteousness and her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there's no fault in her she is all glorious with within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord and all of his works are perfect my isn't that good thinking about you from the beginning to the ending you are the work of the Lord and all of his works are perfect how many can say that I am the work of the Lord and all of his works are perfect W is't that wonderful tonight he's walking in our midst can we sing this together we've been made more than [Music] conquerors
