[26:00] have fellowship with him. We can
[26:01] fellowship with each other on the
[26:03] outside, brother Brian, but on the
[26:04] inside, let's just have fellowship with
[26:06] the Lord Jesus. How many say that's the
[26:08] desire of your heart this morning? Amen.
[26:12] We just want to invite uh brother
[26:14] Matthew McGary to come and speak for us
[26:17] this morning. And certainly look forward
[26:19] to what God has in store. And I know
[26:23] that that the Lord will use him. And how
[26:25] many believes if you come in expectation
[26:26] that God is more than able to speak to
[26:29] your heart. Amen. And Amen. We don't
[26:31] come we don't come to be entertained. We
[26:33] come to entertain him. Amen. So we we
[26:36] give our all to the Lord and ask him to
[26:38] come to speak to our hearts. And so we
[26:41] just want to make ready and invite our
[26:44] brother to come. And maybe we can just
[26:46] uh sing that song, Falling in Love with
[26:48] Jesus. Was the best thing I've ever
[26:50] done. And we just How many believes
[26:52] that? Amen. Just want to give our
[26:55] brother a time to be able to speak and
[26:57] just pull from the gift of God. And I I
[27:00] know he's not afraid of amens. And we're
[27:01] not afraid to to amen the word of God.
[27:03] How many's got the Holy Ghost this
[27:05] morning?
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you what a prophet
[27:07] said that the Holy Ghost it backs the
[27:09] word of God. Amen. So that's what we
[27:11] want. We want to pull from a gift of
[27:12] God. And I pray that God will just pull
[27:14] him right into your very need this
[27:16] morning that he can speak to your heart.
[27:18] He walk right through your living room
[27:19] and deal with what you have need of. And
[27:21] if you'll approach God that way, then
[27:23] God can he can help you this morning. So
[27:25] won't we just invite him to come falling
[27:29] in love with Jesus?
[27:34] [Music]
[27:35] in love with Jesus.
[27:38] [Music]
[27:41] Falling in love with Jesus
[27:46] was the best thing I've ever
[27:49] done. Well, I say
[27:53] falling in love with Jesus.
[27:56] [Music]
[27:59] Falling in love with Jesus.
[28:05] Falling in love with Jesus
[28:10] was the best thing I've ever
[28:14] done. For I know
[28:18] when I was lost, it was Jesus who found
[28:22] me.
[28:24] when I fall down. His grace that
[28:28] surrounds me.
[28:30] Oh, how I feel his love all around me is
[28:36] the best thing I've ever
[28:39] done.
[28:40] For I know
[28:43] falling in love. How many fell in love
[28:46] with him this morning? And won't you
[28:48] just close your eyes and lift your hand
[28:49] to the Lord and and just sing it to him
[28:51] from your heart this morning and make
[28:53] him welcome. Well, falling in love with
[28:58] Jesus
[29:01] was the best thing I've ever
[29:04] done. Well, I say
[29:08] falling in love with Jesus.
[29:14] [Music]
[29:17] Jesus.
[29:19] [Music]
[29:21] Falling in love with Jesus.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just sing it one more time.
[29:30] Falling in love.
[29:34] Falling in love with Jesus.
[29:38] [Music]
[29:40] Falling in love with Jesus.
[29:44] [Music]
[29:46] Falling in love with Jesus
[29:51] is the best thing I've ever done.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you agree with that?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus. I I say if
[30:02] you haven't done it, why don't you just
[30:04] uh purpose that in your heart this
[30:07] morning that you know what, maybe maybe
[30:09] you fell in love and you know sometimes
[30:11] we let our love wayne a little bit and
[30:13] it gets a little cold and we got to
[30:16] shake ourselves and be reminded Lord I'm
[30:19] I'm sorry you you did everything for me
[30:21] and Lord I want to give a little bit
[30:23] back to you that you could just have
[30:25] your way and have your preeminence in my
[30:28] life and you know it's easy to get
[30:30] caught up with the things of life. But
[30:33] but I say, you know, it's good to fall
[30:34] in love with him
[30:36] &gt;&gt; because he loved us before the
[30:37] foundation of the world. And and I like
[30:39] to tell the church, you know, this whole
[30:41] thing is rigged.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to make it.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; We're going to make it.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; You know, there shouldn't be any fear.
[30:49] There shouldn't be any gloom. And my we
[30:51] should just be able to love him with all
[30:52] of our heart. Let's just go before him.
[30:54] Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful,
[30:56] Lord, that we could just be gathered
[30:58] into your presence, Lord. and just have
[31:01] another opportunity that you could come
[31:02] by our way. And
[31:05] Lord, we're just looking to you that you
[31:06] would come and minister. Lord, you know
[31:08] where each one of us are at in our lives
[31:10] and in our walk. And Lord, if our heart
[31:13] is far from you, if we've been turned
[31:16] away or if we're looking to turn back,
[31:18] but Lord, I'm so thankful that you won't
[31:21] lose a one. And Lord, you're always
[31:24] looking and coming for us even when
[31:26] we're not looking for you. And Lord, I
[31:28] pray that our heart would just turn to
[31:29] you and that we'd fall more in love with
[31:31] you this morning, Lord. And as your word
[31:33] goes forth, we just pray that you'd
[31:34] break the bread of life and feed your
[31:36] people. Bless bless this assembly. Bless
[31:38] our pastor, Brother Matt, and all the
[31:40] saints that have gathered, those that
[31:41] aren't able to make it, those that are
[31:43] out on the airways. Lord, I just even
[31:45] thought as it was hard to get the stream
[31:48] up and maybe get the video going, I
[31:50] thought maybe maybe there's the devil's
[31:52] fighting against something because
[31:53] there's coming a blessing for somebody
[31:55] that maybe weren't able to make it into
[31:57] these four walls, but they they have a
[31:59] heart to hear from you, Lord. And I know
[32:01] that you're the same yesterday, today,
[32:02] and forever. And I believe you're coming
[32:04] with a specific word for each one of us.
[32:06] We love you. We ask these blessings in
[32:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[32:10] Praise the Lord. If you have your
[32:11] Bibles, let's just turn in Colossians
[32:13] chapter 3. Just thank brother Matt for
[32:16] the opportunity to stand here before you
[32:18] and minister. It's always good to come
[32:20] and just appreciate him and his wife and
[32:22] all the hospitality and and their
[32:24] family. They're just a joy to be around
[32:26] and just love love to see uh people give
[32:28] all their heart to the Lord and just see
[32:30] what they can do for the kingdom of God.
[32:32] And you know, I I say it's it's a late
[32:34] hour. We ought to be doing everything to
[32:36] get people in.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, we ought to be
[32:39] seeking and saving that which is lost.
[32:41] You know, sometimes we make everything
[32:43] so predestinated that we don't have a
[32:44] job to do. But but God only has your
[32:47] hands as you yield your hands and eyes
[32:48] as you yield your eyes and a mouth as
[32:50] you would yield your mouth. And then God
[32:52] could speak through you.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just see how the Lord will
[32:57] help us uh this morning just to uh
[32:59] minister. Colossians chapter 3 and verse
[33:03] one and two. It says, "If ye then be
[33:06] risen in Christ, seek those things which
[33:08] are above, where Christ siteth on the
[33:11] right hand of God, set your affections
[33:13] on things above, not on things on the
[33:17] earth." My, I tell you what, it's it's
[33:19] hard not to uh allow earthly things and
[33:22] the five senses to uh get all your time
[33:24] and attention, but we need to set our
[33:26] affections on things above. in Hebrews
[33:28] 6:1.
[33:38] Just another familiar reading there.
[33:40] Hebrews 6:1. Therefore, leaving the
[33:41] principles of the doctrine of Christ,
[33:44] let us go on unto perfection, not laying
[33:47] again the foundation of repentance from
[33:49] dead works and faith toward God. Amen.
[33:52] We just ask a blessing on the reading of
[33:54] the word. You may have your seats.
[33:57] Uh, brother Brandham would say this in
[34:00] uh, Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[34:03] today, and forever.
[34:05] He would say uh, don't be afraid to put
[34:08] Christ to a showdown. For if he is
[34:11] Christ, he is the same yesterday, today,
[34:13] and forever. We don't have to be afraid.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; If a servant of Christ should be afraid,
[34:19] there's something wrong with the
[34:20] servant. When Moses looked this way and
[34:24] that way, when he slew the Egyptian, it
[34:26] showed he was out of the divine presence
[34:28] of God. For a servant of Christ don't
[34:31] have to look and see if a man said, "Am
[34:33] I doing all right? Is that fine?" Or, "I
[34:36] I'm afraid you'll say something about
[34:38] me."
[34:38] &gt;&gt; A man that's commissioned of God looks
[34:42] upward and onward.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; You don't have to care what the world
[34:46] says about it anyhow.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; He's not listening to the world. He's
[34:51] got a divine commission from God and
[34:54] enjoying that presence.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I like that. I just maybe something on
[34:58] my heart I want to preach to you this
[34:59] morning is upward and onward.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; I I love that so much. A man that's
[35:04] commissioned of God looks upward and
[35:06] honored. And I believe the bride of
[35:08] Christ, we have a commission.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; We have an objective and our objective
[35:12] is glory. We are we are going into a
[35:15] rapture. And and you know, we ought to
[35:17] not care about what the world has to say
[35:18] about it anyhow. You know, so many
[35:20] times, uh, the critics and people want
[35:22] to come up and say, well, you know, so
[35:24] and so said this and so and so said
[35:26] that. Well, do you know that that's how
[35:27] they feel about it? Well, you know, you
[35:29] know, I know we're humans and we have
[35:30] emotions and when we have feelings, but
[35:32] you know, as the bride of Christ, we
[35:34] have one objective and and that's the
[35:36] word of God and that's glory. And and
[35:38] sure, things hurt when people say this
[35:40] and they try to discourage, but what did
[35:41] God say about it? And if God has given
[35:43] you his word and he's given you a
[35:45] commission, then don't worry about the
[35:46] critic. Don't worry about the naysayer.
[35:48] You're not listening to the world. You
[35:50] got a divine commission from God. And I
[35:52] say we ought to enjoy his presence. I I
[35:54] think the bride ought to get back to
[35:56] enjoying the word of God and enjoying
[35:57] the presence of God. And who cares what
[35:59] the critic says and and this person said
[36:01] and and the person sitting next to me, I
[36:03] come to the house of God to worship. I'm
[36:05] going to praise him. I'm going to enjoy
[36:06] the word. I'm going to enjoy his
[36:08] presence. He's worthy of praise. He's
[36:10] worthy of my voice. He's worthy of my
[36:12] shout. He's worthy of my dance. He's
[36:13] worthy of my strength. He's worthy of
[36:15] every amen and everything I give to him,
[36:17] Lord. And I want to enjoy his presence.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; I want to go upward
[36:22] &gt;&gt; and onward. The scripture would say,
[36:24] Jesus speaking in Matthew 5:48 says, "Be
[36:26] therefore perfect,
[36:28] &gt;&gt; even as your father which is in heaven
[36:30] is perfect." Colossians 3:2, "Set your
[36:32] affections on things above," which is
[36:34] our text, not on things on earth. Come
[36:36] on, man.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; My If we ever live in an age
[36:40] where it's easy to set your affection
[36:43] on the on your job and your work and
[36:45] your car and your your house and and
[36:48] entertainment and all these things, you
[36:49] know, we ought not to do that. Our our
[36:51] our affection should be for him and for
[36:53] his word and and we ought to always be
[36:55] looking for a way to please him and make
[36:56] oursel available to him and Lord, what
[36:58] would you have me to do do today? You
[37:00] know, we get such a rigid schedule where
[37:02] we ain't got no time for God. You know,
[37:04] it would be a shame if if if if we wrote
[37:06] out our whole schedule and it was it
[37:08] said, "Okay, Lord, you have you have 7
[37:11] to 9 on Wednesday night and you have 11
[37:14] to 2 on Sunday and then you just pencil
[37:16] in everything else." No, it ought to be
[37:18] every minute, every hour.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture even tells us
[37:21] pray without ceasing. You know, that
[37:23] there ought to be something in our heart
[37:25] bubbling up and and looking upward and
[37:27] onward. And you know, Paul said,
[37:29] "Forgetting those things which are in
[37:30] the past, I press toward the mark of the
[37:32] high calling in Jesus Christ." You know,
[37:34] uh that also means for for the good and
[37:36] the bad. You know, many times we we
[37:38] might feel accomplished. We we we we've
[37:40] done a little bit for the kingdom of God
[37:41] and and we put in some work and we feel
[37:44] pretty good and you're just on cruise
[37:45] control. You know, we got to we got to
[37:46] forget that.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, you you got to not live
[37:51] like I've apprehended and I've obtained,
[37:53] you know, and I I I I've made it and I
[37:55] go to church and I I do my job. And so
[37:58] now I can just take care of myself. I
[38:00] can work for my retirement. I can work
[38:01] for that new car. I can work for that
[38:03] new house. I go to church on Sunday. I
[38:05] go on Wednesday and I I listen to a tape
[38:06] every once in a while. But you're not
[38:08] careful. Your affections are on the
[38:09] things of the world and not on the
[38:11] things of God. I say we got to leave the
[38:13] past in the past.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; You know, that's wonderful. You got a
[38:17] good track record. I'm glad you've been
[38:18] coming to church for 20 years. I I'm
[38:20] glad you listen to tapes. But you know
[38:22] what? That was yesterday. And we got
[38:23] today. And he's the same yesterday,
[38:25] today. I say, God, what do you have for
[38:26] me today, Lord? What's my commission
[38:28] today, Father? I want to serve you. I
[38:30] want to give you my heart. I want to
[38:31] give you my life, Lord. I want to open
[38:33] up in a full surrender. Lord, I'm
[38:34] leaving those things behind, and I'm
[38:36] pressing toward the mark of the high
[38:38] calling of Jesus Christ.
[38:41] And I was just thinking about how how
[38:43] Paul says that forgetting those things
[38:44] that are in the past,
[38:47] you know, I say, "What what an
[38:48] opportunity we have this morning
[38:52] that the past can be put behind us."
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; I say, "What what what an opportunity
[38:57] that God has provided."
[39:00] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say the reason some
[39:01] of us can't go forward, we're too busy
[39:03] hanging on to the past.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Come on.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; You know, uh uh so many times we we get
[39:10] to places in our walk and in our lives
[39:12] and maybe God does something for us and
[39:14] and we start out, you know, I like the
[39:16] scripture says, "Oh foolish, you know,
[39:18] you are you so foolish having begun in
[39:20] the spirit. Are you now perfected in the
[39:22] flesh?" We wonder why we get into
[39:23] situations and problems. You wonder why
[39:25] you feel backslid.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times people will
[39:29] come like, "Well, hey, what's going on?
[39:31] What are you going through?" It's like,
[39:32] "You left off doing all the things you
[39:33] were doing. and you ain't reading your
[39:35] Bible like you used to. You ain't
[39:36] listening to tapes like you used to. You
[39:38] ain't in fervent prayer for your
[39:39] brothers and sisters. You ain't seeking
[39:40] God. You wonder why you're in a funk.
[39:42] Well, get back to praying.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Get back to reading. Well, I don't feel
[39:46] anything when I when I read. I I not get
[39:48] out anything when I listen. Well, I tell
[39:50] you what, I don't care what the bag of
[39:51] bones feels. There ought to be something
[39:53] inside of say, you little bag of bones.
[39:55] I don't care if you feel like you ain't
[39:56] getting anything out of it. I'm going to
[39:58] pray if I don't feel like my prayer is
[39:59] getting out of this building. I'm going
[40:01] to listen to a tape and if I don't feel
[40:02] like I'm getting anything out of it, I'm
[40:04] going to church and if I don't feel a
[40:05] thing, I'm just going to lift my hand.
[40:07] I'm going to say, "Praise God." Anyhow,
[40:12] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we just letting all the
[40:14] things God brought us out of hang on to
[40:15] us.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I wonder if some message
[40:19] believers or or or some preachers out
[40:21] there, we're just becoming good
[40:22] Catholics.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; You got to do repentance and and well,
[40:27] you know, you did because you did this,
[40:28] you're reaping that and you're reaping
[40:29] that. You know what? I serve a God that
[40:32] is able.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; He can wash you white. I don't care how
[40:36] bad your past was. I don't care how bad
[40:38] your faults and your failures was. I
[40:40] don't care if you made a mistake
[40:41] yesterday. Well, I tell you, the blood
[40:43] still has power this morning. If you
[40:45] plead the blood of Jesus Christ, you are
[40:47] forgiven. Hallelujah.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; But oh, in in our flesh, in our in our
[40:54] senses, it's so easy to allow the things
[40:56] of our past just to kind of hang on to
[40:58] us or or oh my, I tell you what, uh uh
[41:02] uh so and so didn't invite me over and
[41:04] and you know, and they went on that
[41:06] vacation and I wasn't invited and and
[41:08] you know, the pastor did that for soand
[41:10] so and he didn't do it for me and and
[41:12] all of a sudden we allow all these
[41:14] things to start hanging on to us and you
[41:15] know what? But then you come to the
[41:16] house of God and you wonder why you're
[41:18] not enjoying his presence. You wonder
[41:20] why you're not enjoying a blessing?
[41:21] Because you got all these things hanging
[41:23] on you.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Well, you know why? You know, why does
[41:26] God blesses so and so? Why doesn't he
[41:28] bless me?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; You know, so many times we we start to
[41:35] look at things in the natural and the
[41:37] carnal and why what is it? Maybe we got
[41:38] our affections on the things on the
[41:40] earth. Well, we're foolish to compare
[41:42] ourselves one to another. Come on.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; I say, let's get back to the main thing.
[41:47] Let's get back to the word. I said, did
[41:49] did Christ die for you?
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Did he save you?
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Did he write your name on the lamb's
[41:55] book of life?
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Are you going in a rapture? Did you
[41:59] receive a message, a vindicated message
[42:02] by a vindicated prophet that called you
[42:04] out of denominations, that called you
[42:06] out of the chicken yard of the world? I
[42:08] I I say it's a finished work.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Then what are you sad about? What you
[42:13] worried about? Why are you crying about
[42:15] it? I say we ought to be the most
[42:17] happiest people on the face of the earth
[42:19] to know that we are going in a rapture.
[42:22] We got an objective. Our objective is
[42:24] glory. I'm going upward. I'm going
[42:27] onward. I'm not worried about my past.
[42:29] God took care of my past.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, if he took care of
[42:34] your past, he'll take care of your
[42:35] future.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go upward. Let's go onward.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; And I've been just feeding on this
[42:50] message. Why Christ speak? And
[42:53] you know it just Moses was never settled
[42:56] until he met the pillar of fire.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you he's the same
[43:01] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And the reason why a lot of people
[43:04] aren't settled and and they're not
[43:07] secure in their salvation and and
[43:09] they're always looking for something
[43:11] else or a certain way or or or uh just
[43:14] follow me here. May maybe they they look
[43:17] for some man to speak a word over them
[43:19] or or or they're always I need
[43:21] something. I need something to speak to
[43:24] me in my I I tell you what, you know,
[43:25] Moses, that's what the our opening quote
[43:27] said. Moses, he he was trying to fulfill
[43:30] the word of God in his own in his own
[43:32] right.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And you go through this message here,
[43:35] why Christ speak, he said, brother Bam
[43:37] says, oh, he had intellectual faith. He
[43:39] was born for a purpose. He was the
[43:40] chosen one for the job.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; But he had intellectual faith.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; And brother said with all that
[43:46] intellectual faith, he he said, you
[43:48] know, all that accomplished was a dead
[43:50] Egyptian.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And he was worried and looking this way
[43:54] and that way. And he ran and he fled. I
[43:56] say a lot of us, are we that way? Hey,
[43:57] you know, we we try to do something for
[43:59] God and oh, did I do it right? Or what's
[44:01] so and so going to say? Well, I'll go do
[44:03] this for the Lord, but what happens if
[44:04] so and so thinks I'm trying to do this
[44:05] or that?
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be afraid. We shouldn't be
[44:10] fearful.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; But when Moses finally met that pillar
[44:13] of fire,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; prophet of God said, "The pillar of fire
[44:17] had what Moses lacked."
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know about you, but I know
[44:21] one thing. The pillar of fire has what I
[44:23] lack. And I say, "What an opportunity we
[44:26] have this morning." The same pillar of
[44:28] fire that was up there on the side of
[44:30] that mountain in a burning bush that
[44:32] spoke out to Moses is the same pillar of
[44:34] fire that is right here in Black Rock,
[44:37] Arkansas to speak to your heart, to
[44:39] speak to your need, to erase your past,
[44:41] to show you your future, to take you
[44:43] upward and onward.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; I say he's here this morning.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity we have.
[44:56] You don't have to wait another service.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; That thing that's been bothering you,
[45:01] that thing that you're holding on to,
[45:04] &gt;&gt; you got something you need to make right
[45:05] with your wife, brother,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; don't put it off.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't go another day. Don't go
[45:13] another service.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; You wonder why the wife is nervous and
[45:16] she's frustrated around in the home. She
[45:18] don't know what's wrong, but you do.
[45:20] Come on.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; You need to make that right.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Get the presence. You know, hey, just
[45:27] let God speak to your heart. Come on.
[45:29] We're living in a wicked age.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; The lid of hell has been torn off. And
[45:33] there's 200,000,000 demons that have
[45:35] been loosed on the bride. They're
[45:37] attacking your mind. They're attacking
[45:38] your marriage. They're attacking your
[45:40] church. They're attacking your pastor.
[45:41] We're in a fight. We're in a battle.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; We can't just be going along like loosey
[45:47] goosey like nothing's going on. and and
[45:49] maybe there's a little frustration in
[45:51] the house and well why is my wife
[45:53] feeling a little frustrated? Why are
[45:54] things going why are things just don't
[45:56] feel right in the home? You're in a
[45:57] battle.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; We're in a fight.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; I say some of us brothers, we need to
[46:03] man up and say, "You know what? I'm
[46:04] going to possess my vessel and
[46:05] sanctification and honor. I'm going to
[46:07] apply the token to my home. These
[46:09] spirits that I let in here and this
[46:11] nervousness that I let in here, I'm
[46:13] going to apply the token of the living
[46:15] God. I'm going to kick that nonsense
[46:17] out."
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:19] [Applause]
[46:23] Don't Don't wait.
[46:26] We're not guaranteed tomorrow.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Have we got so comfortable that we're
[46:32] just coasting now? You know,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; he'll come when he comes.
[46:38] I'm going to Disney World in two weeks.
[46:40] He'll come when he comes. I I sure hope
[46:43] the Lord don't come because I'm looking
[46:45] forward to Disneyland.
[46:48] Let me get my pay raise first. Let me
[46:50] build a bigger house. Let me get a nice
[46:52] Are you kidding me?
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Let's get our affections back on the
[46:55] word of God.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; And I say we have an opportunity this
[46:58] morning.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; I I say what happens if I we you know
[47:02] what? We ought to we ought to act like
[47:04] this is our last service.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Let's just act like this might be the
[47:09] last service we ever have.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; This is going to be my opportunity to
[47:13] let my brothers and sisters know I
[47:15] believe this message.
[47:16] You know, I might have not I might not
[47:18] have raised my hand before and I might
[47:20] have got excited before, but you know
[47:21] what? I realized something. I'm a child
[47:24] of God. I'm the bride and I'm going in
[47:26] the rapture. If I got excited for the
[47:28] things of the world, if I got excited at
[47:30] a ball game. If I got excited for the
[47:33] things of the flesh, you know what? I'm
[47:34] finally I'm going to get free in the
[47:36] presence of God. I'm going to get
[47:38] excited because I have an objective. I
[47:41] got a commission from God. I am going in
[47:43] a rapture.
[47:45] [Applause]
[47:48] Oh, what kind of service could we have?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; We start getting our eyes off the things
[47:54] of the world.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Get our eyes
[47:59] on his word.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God would say it a certain
[48:02] way. Oh, if we could just break away
[48:03] from this sensebound existence.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, may we break away from
[48:08] this sense bound existence this morning.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. get a revelation of the word and
[48:13] your will for our life.
[48:17] Brother Brandham says this in why Christ
[48:19] speak. He says, "And one day while
[48:20] attending the flock,
[48:23] all at once he seen a burning bush up on
[48:26] top of the mountain burning and went up
[48:28] there and not an intellectual and
[48:30] imagination or delusion, optical
[48:33] illusion, but there was the God of
[48:35] Abraham in a light, a pillar of fire
[48:38] back in the bush.
[48:40] the fire like waves going out, but it
[48:42] didn't bother the bush.
[48:44] And the voice of the scripture, the
[48:46] voice of God, spoke
[48:49] through there and said, "I have chosen
[48:51] you. You are the man. I've raised you up
[48:55] for this purpose. I'm proving to you
[48:58] here by signs you're going down to
[49:01] deliver the children of Israel because
[49:04] my word has got to be filled." I I just
[49:06] want to say this. Don't don't don't
[49:08] gloss over that too quick.
[49:11] You are here for a purpose.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; God is calling you. You are the man. You
[49:15] are the lady that God has called.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; I've raised you up for a purpose to put
[49:21] every devil under your foot.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; I've raised you up to go on a body
[49:25] change. I've raised you up to lay hands
[49:26] on the sick and they recover.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, his word of this day has
[49:31] got to be fulfilled." We're living in
[49:34] the hour. No matter what anyone else
[49:36] says, the word has to be fulfilled.
[49:38] Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[49:41] not his word. Now, when Moses got all
[49:44] this together and seen by every
[49:47] direction,
[49:49] it anointed his faith.
[49:53] What a thought.
[49:56] Now, if I can just maybe
[49:59] show how that speaks to me when when I
[50:02] see the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5
[50:06] when I see that God has sent a
[50:08] vindicated prophet and Revelations 10
[50:10] 1-7 has been fulfilled. The mighty angel
[50:13] has come down, God has has spoken and
[50:16] loosed the seven seals. And and we might
[50:18] not have been in the meetings.
[50:21] I I don't know about you, but I wasn't
[50:23] there. I wasn't there in Jeffersonville,
[50:25] Indiana when he preached the seven
[50:28] seals. I wasn't there when he preached
[50:31] preached Christ the mystery of God
[50:32] revealed. But then a prophet comes and
[50:34] he'd start talking about identification
[50:36] and say, "I was there when Moses crossed
[50:38] the Red Sea. I was there when he went to
[50:40] Calvary." And then by faith, I see
[50:42] physically in this body, I might not
[50:45] have been there. Oh, but I come from
[50:46] somewhere. There's something in me that
[50:49] was there. There's something in me that
[50:51] was there when Moses crossed the Red
[50:53] Sea. There was something in me with
[50:54] Abraham up on that mountain. There was
[50:57] something in me. I say, why? Because
[50:59] you've come from God and you're going
[51:01] back to God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; So then when my prophet says, when you
[51:04] see all these things, no, I might not
[51:06] have been there in 1963, but there's
[51:09] something in me by faith. I can see it.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; I see it laying in the word, and by
[51:14] faith it's vindicated. Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "When Moses got all this
[51:22] together and seeing by every direction,
[51:25] it anointed his faith." Oh my, what a
[51:28] thought
[51:30] itself. Seeing the scriptures pointing
[51:32] right straight to what it was and
[51:33] speaking God and the evidence of it
[51:34] there, it anointed what faith he had in
[51:38] him to go to work.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Well, some of us need to go to work.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that don't mean clock in at
[51:45] your job.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; We need to go to work.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Our faith needs to be anointed.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; We need to go to work. What ought that
[51:53] do to us? We need a repentance.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; We need a revival.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; I'm saying myself, see, I need a
[52:02] shaking. I need something. I I wonder if
[52:05] we could just identify with that a
[52:07] little bit this morning. If somebody can
[52:08] be honest with themselves and say, you
[52:10] know what? I I I need to repent. Come
[52:12] on.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; I You know what? I I I I I looking in my
[52:16] life. You know what? I need I need to
[52:17] repent of some things. I I need to make
[52:19] some things. I really need a shaking.
[52:22] Maybe you look into your life and
[52:23] realize, hey, so you know what? I need a
[52:25] revival. I I I say that for I need a
[52:28] revival, Lord. I I need a revival.
[52:30] Father, stir up the water. Stand get all
[52:32] the trash out of my life, Lord Jesus. I
[52:34] I need something. And I say if the
[52:36] prophet of God could stand there and
[52:38] openly make a confession to the
[52:40] congregation, say, "I'm I'm saying I
[52:42] need something myself." I believe every
[52:44] believer in here can identify with that
[52:45] word. Say, "Oh, God, I need something.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I I need the Holy Ghost, Lord.
[52:56] I need you, Lord, to come into my home.
[53:00] I realize I've made a mess of things
[53:03] and I've tried to make it right and I've
[53:05] only made it worse. And Lord, I need
[53:08] your help in my marriage. I I I need you
[53:11] to help me love my wife better. You
[53:14] know, one of the the the scriptures that
[53:16] I marvel at is
[53:18] husbands, love your wives as Christ
[53:20] loved the church.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm getting myself in trouble now.
[53:26] Lord, I I I I I need you.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Sorry, son. I'm hunting.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I need to talk to you about
[53:34] something. Well, I I'm I'm going on a
[53:36] trip with the brothers, Lord. I
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Is God too busy for you?
[53:45] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers. We We shouldn't get too
[53:47] busy.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't get too busy for our wives.
[53:51] We shouldn't get too busy for our kids.
[53:53] They need you.
[53:54] Husbands, love your wives as Christ
[53:56] loved the church.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; I can't do that.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Dead silence.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I don't have the ability.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; But if I can let him come.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Look, we we we could go right into a
[54:13] filio love and agape. I ain't talking
[54:15] about a a filio love.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives as that Christ
[54:20] love the church. That's an agapeo love.
[54:21] say, "Oh, God, I need agape love in my
[54:23] life, Lord. I I I've been a little
[54:26] selfish, Lord. I I I've tended to myself
[54:28] a little bit, but let me start looking
[54:29] on the needs of my family, more. Let let
[54:31] me start to to to really uh look out on
[54:34] the kids and and look out on their
[54:36] well-being and see what I could do
[54:38] better. Maybe you could sac sacrifice a
[54:40] little bit so they could do a little bit
[54:41] better. Are you hearing me? Is that
[54:43] okay? I I I don't know. I just know the
[54:45] capstone is love. And and the only way
[54:47] we're going to get out of here, church,
[54:49] is when we can get back to real agape
[54:52] love in the hearts and lives of
[54:53] believers. Where when you hear a need
[54:55] right over the pulpit, you just go, "Oh,
[54:57] God bless so and so." But we can really
[54:59] get a burden in our hearts for lost
[55:01] souls and and people's family and
[55:03] prodical sons and daughters. And we can
[55:04] have a real love in our heart pouring
[55:07] out for our wives and our children and
[55:08] our church and our pastor. We can be in
[55:11] a real prayer. Oh God, bless brother
[55:13] Matt. We need a real dynamic word to
[55:15] come forth, Lord. But anoint my ears to
[55:17] hear. Lord, there's needs. May you send
[55:19] a word, Father. Your word is sharper
[55:21] than any two-edged sword. May you come
[55:23] in power and demonstration.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll start having a revival. All
[55:30] right.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Start to get in one mind and one accord.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; I see some sitting on me. Yeah, you
[55:36] might need it the most.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. I see it.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not afraid. I got a commission.
[55:43] Come on.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have to look left or look right.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; We got a commission.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I long for the
[55:52] days of Ananas and Safia when sin's
[55:54] called out at the door."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Make no mistake, there's times, I would
[55:58] even say your pastor of the anointed
[56:00] could call it out.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; A man of God could be preaching on the
[56:04] anointing and there's a resistance in
[56:06] the spirit and you can discern what that
[56:08] spirit is and you're resenting. Why?
[56:11] because you're not allowing deliverance.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; You can't love that spirit. If you're
[56:17] guilty, why don't you say, "Lord,
[56:18] forgive me."
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Make it right. Your attitude can hinder
[56:25] the move of the Holy Ghost.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet taught me. Your
[56:31] attitude.
[56:39] I say let's let's get it under the
[56:40] blood.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Let's look upward and onward. Prophet of
[56:45] God said, "Don't look at where you were.
[56:48] Look at where you're going."
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we get too busy living
[56:54] life in a rearview mirror.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Just always looking to the past. Look to
[57:00] the past. He said, "That's how you end
[57:02] up in a wreck."
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Let's quit looking at the past. Let's
[57:07] start looking at where we're going.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; That's what I say. We we sometimes we
[57:13] just let the past hang all over us.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I believe I had an experience.
[57:17] I got filled with the Holy Ghost and and
[57:19] then I did good for three or four months
[57:20] and and I gave right back into that that
[57:22] temptation. Okay.
[57:25] Well, what are you gonna do about it?
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You gonna throw Are you gonna quit?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; You're throwing the towel. Well, God,
[57:30] you your power wasn't good enough. I'm
[57:32] going to go back to the word now. Just
[57:34] make it right,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Lord. I messed up again. Forgive me. But
[57:38] I know your grace. I know your mercy. I
[57:40] know your blood is more than able to
[57:43] save and sanctify my life again, Lord.
[57:46] Maybe I didn't have what I thought I
[57:47] had, Lord. But I know there's more for
[57:49] me, Lord. So, I'm coming back, Lord, in
[57:51] a true repentance, Lord. I'm sorry. I
[57:54] failed you once again. I'm pleading the
[57:56] blood of Jesus Christ, Lord. But I'm
[57:57] going to get back up and I'm going to
[57:59] face that enemy one more time. And if I
[58:02] fall, I'll make it right and I'll get
[58:04] right back up. And one of these days,
[58:06] I'll get the full total victory.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; I say, let's put it under the blood.
[58:13] Let's go forward.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans 8:1, "There is
[58:18] therefore now no condemnation,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh, but after
[58:26] the spirit."
[58:28] &gt;&gt; In Christ.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you get in?
[58:36] By one spirit.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; We're all baptized
[58:40] &gt;&gt; into his body.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Well, how do I do that? Repent.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Make it right. Turn from it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do it anymore.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[58:55] Jesus Christ.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And you shall.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You know, you can take that right there
[59:03] and whoop the devil.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe say, "Maybe I don't got it. Maybe
[59:07] I I don't have what I thought I had, but
[59:09] I got a promise.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; I have repented. I have been baptized in
[59:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[59:16] my God told me I shall receive the gift
[59:19] of the Holy Ghost. Devil, back up. Watch
[59:22] out. If I ain't got it now and I'm
[59:24] living like this, wait till I get it.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; But that's just a battle in your mind.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we got to fight like that.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've made
[59:38] it. I made some pretty bad mistakes.
[59:41] Come on.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And I'd be like, dude, I you don't got
[59:44] what you think you had.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And I've been sitting there like, maybe
[59:48] I don't.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; So, what am I going to do?
[59:56] &gt;&gt; I ain't I ain't going back to the world.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; I I there there's nothing in
[1:00:01] denomination that that entices me.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, it is dead than dead can be.
[1:00:06] Come on.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I come out the world.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And it's dead than dead can be.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; I made a horrible mistake. I messed up.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; I should have never done it.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; I ain't got nowhere else to go, brother
[1:00:20] Matt.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I ain't got nowhere else to go, Lord. I
[1:00:27] made a mistake, but Lord, I'm coming
[1:00:29] back to you because I ain't got nowhere
[1:00:32] else to go. Lord, I need you. I need
[1:00:34] your grace. I need your word. I need
[1:00:36] revelation. I need your strength. I need
[1:00:38] your power.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching about going upward and
[1:00:43] onward.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the past. Look at what
[1:00:48] you're going to be.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Well, my scripture tells me there's
[1:00:52] therefore now no condemnation.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you what, the devil sure
[1:00:56] likes to heat that onto you.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; But if you have truly made it right,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] and you have repented of your sins,
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; there is no condemnation.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And and I just want to maybe say this. I
[1:01:13] I really feel like
[1:01:15] that's where a lot of us struggle in our
[1:01:17] walks with the Lord is we are always
[1:01:21] struggling with condemnation.
[1:01:24] We're always struggling with uh uh well,
[1:01:28] you know, I I believe I got the Holy
[1:01:30] Ghost and and God done something
[1:01:32] supernatural in my life, but but I fell
[1:01:34] to that temptation.
[1:01:36] Well, I just want to say this that
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; doesn't change the word.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; What are you going to put your faith in?
[1:01:44] Are you going to put your faith in your
[1:01:45] failure or are you going to put your
[1:01:46] faith in the word?
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Are you going to put your faith in your
[1:01:50] works or are you going to put your faith
[1:01:51] in the word? Come on.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Are you going to put your faith and and
[1:01:56] the mistakes and failures that you made
[1:01:58] or you going to say, you know what,
[1:01:59] Lord?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You said, if I call on the name of the
[1:02:01] Lord, I shall be saved. You said if if I
[1:02:04] confess that you're just and faithful to
[1:02:06] forgive me. Well, I want to say, is God
[1:02:08] a liar?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; God is not a man that he can lie. Then
[1:02:12] if he gave you his word, then take God
[1:02:14] at his word.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the devil. Quit
[1:02:18] listening to your past. Quit listening
[1:02:20] to the condemnation. rise above it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; I like this. Ephesians
[1:02:32] says in Ephesians 1:4, "According as he
[1:02:34] has chosen us in him before the
[1:02:35] foundation of the world,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; that we should be holy and without blame
[1:02:40] before him love." Remember we said you
[1:02:41] got a purpose. You are called for a
[1:02:43] purpose. We're not looking at what we
[1:02:45] were. We're looking at what we're going
[1:02:46] to be. He He has chosen you before the
[1:02:48] foundation of the world that you would
[1:02:50] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:02:52] love.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; He predestinated you unto adoption by
[1:02:56] the children of Jesus Christ according
[1:02:58] to the good pleasure of his will.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I like to say this because it's not
[1:03:03] a question as if you can. It's not a
[1:03:05] question of if he will.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; It's not a challenge. Can I get it all
[1:03:09] together? It's a promise of what God is
[1:03:11] doing in your life.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. You don't have
[1:03:14] to wonder, well, will I ever come to
[1:03:16] adoption? Will I ever get the Holy
[1:03:18] Ghost? Will I ever get total victory?
[1:03:20] Will I ever get total deliverance? I'm
[1:03:22] saying you got a word from the Lord that
[1:03:23] he has chose you before the foundation
[1:03:26] of the world that you should be holy
[1:03:28] without blame before him in love and has
[1:03:31] predestinated you unto adoption. That is
[1:03:34] not a challenge. That is a promise for
[1:03:36] the purpose of your life. That every one
[1:03:38] of you are coming into the stature of a
[1:03:40] perfect man. And there ain't no demon in
[1:03:42] hell. There ain't no complex. There
[1:03:44] ain't no fear. There ain't no anxiety.
[1:03:46] There ain't nothing can stop you from
[1:03:48] coming into the word of God that he's
[1:03:50] promised to you.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:30. You like your Bible?
[1:04:01] Romans 8:30 would say this, "Moreover,
[1:04:03] whom he did predestinate."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Them he also called,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; and whom he called,
[1:04:11] them he also justified.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And whom he justified,
[1:04:15] them he also glorified.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Sounds like this thing's rigged.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; So maybe you're justified.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe he's working on sanctification in
[1:04:27] your life.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; It's all a work of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; So don't let the devil beat you up and
[1:04:33] rob you of your joy of the work of God
[1:04:34] that he's doing in your life.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; If God before us,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know we're in a battle. I I know
[1:04:52] I know 200,000,000 demons have been
[1:04:55] loosed on the bride and and I know
[1:04:57] they're fighting against us and trying
[1:04:59] to keep you from going upward and going
[1:05:01] onward. Oh my. The scripture says in
[1:05:03] Ephesians 6:12, "For we wrestle not
[1:05:05] against flesh and blood, but against
[1:05:07] principalities and powers and rulers of
[1:05:09] darkness of this world, against
[1:05:11] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You wonder why it's so hard to pray.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Well, quit wondering.
[1:05:20] We got a real devil, a real adversary.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought. That's
[1:05:25] what brother Brandham said. You know,
[1:05:26] you might not have run into the devil,
[1:05:28] but you will.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; He said, you got to recognize him real.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; There is a real devil.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And if you just, you know, as the old
[1:05:40] saying goes, you walk, you know, walking
[1:05:42] through a graveyard whistling because
[1:05:44] you're acting like nothing's there, I
[1:05:45] tell you, they're all around.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:50] They're trying to hinder you from
[1:05:51] praying. They're trying to hinder you
[1:05:52] from going to church.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And you know, sometimes not the biggest,
[1:05:58] most obvious things.
[1:06:00] You can you can get everything together
[1:06:02] and and you just make my family is
[1:06:05] finally going to be 20 minutes early to
[1:06:07] church.
[1:06:09] Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] and you dump your coffee in your lap
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; or the child throws this on the ground
[1:06:18] or you get in the car and honey I told
[1:06:21] you to put gas in the car.
[1:06:24] I I mean I didn't say like that honey.
[1:06:27] Um I should have put gas in the car for
[1:06:29] you.
[1:06:30] We're going to be late again.
[1:06:34] But it's always something.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; But but you know something was on my
[1:06:37] heart. You know we got to have some
[1:06:39] spiritual awareness. Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Like we we we and
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; the devil, you know, there's coming a
[1:06:48] time in the millennium that we know the
[1:06:49] devil will be chained by circumstance
[1:06:51] because he won't have anybody to work
[1:06:52] through.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; But I I hope this doesn't surprise any
[1:06:57] of you, but we are not in the
[1:06:58] millennium.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; And if you are, I haven't got there yet
[1:07:01] because And if we are, I'm disappointed.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; We ain't there yet.
[1:07:11] Because there's plenty of things for the
[1:07:12] devil to work through.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; He'll work through your job. He'll he'll
[1:07:17] work through your neighbor. He'll work
[1:07:19] through your car. He'll work through the
[1:07:21] streaming and the video.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Make it crash. Make the microphones mess
[1:07:25] up. Look, there's even quotes from
[1:07:26] Brother Bam. Talk about it.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Devil's going to try to get into
[1:07:30] something. Why? To try to disrupt, to
[1:07:32] try to discourage.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; He going to work through whatever he
[1:07:36] can. And you know, you know, one of the
[1:07:38] things he likes to to to to work through
[1:07:40] the most, me,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; the guy in the mirror.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I'm my own worst enemy.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And I say we ought to have some
[1:07:49] spiritual awareness in our lives
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; and start recognizing in our home, in
[1:07:53] our situations, in our car, and on our
[1:07:55] jobs, and everything that we are in a
[1:07:57] battle. We are in a real war. And we got
[1:07:59] to say, you know, why did so and so say
[1:08:01] that? We got to be looking for
[1:08:02] opportunities to let God come in and
[1:08:04] realize, you know, that's just the
[1:08:05] devil. He's just trying to He's just
[1:08:07] trying to hinder something. He's just
[1:08:08] trying to cause some I say we there
[1:08:10] ought to be some discernment. There
[1:08:11] ought to be some real spiritual
[1:08:12] awareness and the bride of Christ to
[1:08:14] realize, hey, we are in a battle. We are
[1:08:16] in a real war. And to recognize some of
[1:08:18] the entertainment and some of the things
[1:08:20] that we give our time and attention to.
[1:08:22] Satan's want to use those things to
[1:08:24] distract and pull away and to bring
[1:08:26] spirits in. I say we ought to we ought
[1:08:28] to get some spiritual awareness in our
[1:08:29] lives.
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Recognize the devil is real. Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I like how the prophet goes on.
[1:08:37] He says, "But then what do you do?" He
[1:08:38] says, "Recognize that greater is he
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; that is in you
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than this
[1:08:48] trial that I'm going through. Greater is
[1:08:50] he that is in me than the bills that I
[1:08:53] got to pay."
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of us depend way too much
[1:08:56] on our job and not on God.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I see it all the time because they give
[1:09:00] their job more preeminence than the
[1:09:02] word. Come on.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm sorry. I'm oldfashioned. I I
[1:09:06] don't know anywhere anywhere else to
[1:09:08] live. I just know one thing. If you put
[1:09:10] God first,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I I'm often met with people, you know,
[1:09:14] in business and and they'll they'll
[1:09:15] they'll say, you know, I I I want to
[1:09:17] start a business and it seems like maybe
[1:09:19] you've been able to to to to get
[1:09:21] somewhere and and they I said, "Look, I
[1:09:23] can sit down and talk to you business
[1:09:24] all day and and I I I can talk to you
[1:09:27] about the numbers and everything, but I
[1:09:28] just let me just tell you my business
[1:09:30] plan." My business plan comes out of the
[1:09:32] book of Matthew. Seek ye first the
[1:09:33] kingdom of God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. Some of us want to
[1:09:37] be blessed and we're not seeking God.
[1:09:39] You want a new car, you're not seeking
[1:09:41] God. We're seeking worldly things, but
[1:09:43] we're not seeking his righteousness.
[1:09:45] We're not seeking his word. I want to
[1:09:46] tell you, if you put God first,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; all these things
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; will be added unto you.
[1:09:59] I say if you if you by faith can take
[1:10:01] that word,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; what did that opening quote say? Don't
[1:10:06] be afraid to put Christ to a showdown.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You want to be in church and it's a
[1:10:12] choice between work and church.
[1:10:15] Go to church.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But it better be by faith
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; because if it's not by faith, you'll be
[1:10:22] broke with no faith.
[1:10:29] Hey, Moses when he slayed that Egyptian,
[1:10:31] it wasn't by faith.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I'm a deliverer.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; I guess I got to do my my job. How am I
[1:10:38] going to do it? Well, I guess I'll start
[1:10:41] one by one.
[1:10:43] Own efforts, own ability.
[1:10:46] But when he came into that presence of
[1:10:48] that pillar of fire
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; and it anointed his faith
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; so then now oh okay Lord I see something
[1:10:57] laying in your word I'm going to come
[1:10:59] into prayer Lord Jesus I need you to
[1:11:02] come father anoint my faith I'm going to
[1:11:04] take you at your word not not not not
[1:11:06] not to benefit myself not not to b but
[1:11:09] Lord Jesus I I'm taking you at your word
[1:11:11] father and now Lord by by by by the
[1:11:14] faith that you you've given me. I'm
[1:11:16] going to take that you earned and I'm
[1:11:17] going to go for it and I'm going to put
[1:11:19] you first. Oh, I'd say go ahead and put
[1:11:21] Christ to a showdown.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; He won't disappoint you.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; He will never fail you. He will never
[1:11:29] leave you.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:11:33] righteousness.
[1:11:35] And greater is he that is in you than he
[1:11:37] that is in the world.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Just speaking along the long lines of
[1:11:41] faith.
[1:11:42] Brother Benham says this in why Christ
[1:11:44] speak. He says faith sees what God wants
[1:11:46] you to see.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God sees.
[1:11:52] Reasoning and senses sees what the world
[1:11:55] wants you to see. Notice reasoning. Why?
[1:11:59] It's only human sense. It's only uh
[1:12:02] reasons. Well, a ain't this just as
[1:12:05] good. See that? That's just exactly, you
[1:12:08] know, I don't know why that pops in my
[1:12:10] head, but streaming's not just as good.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; It It's not as good.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You want me to I I Let me just tell you,
[1:12:23] I've done it.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I'd much rather be in a meeting than
[1:12:28] stream a meeting.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be in church than stream
[1:12:33] church. Now, if you're Now, if you're
[1:12:35] Now, if you're sick and you can't make
[1:12:36] it or something comes up, man, praise
[1:12:38] God, we can stream.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's archived so that I if I
[1:12:42] miss something, I can go back and hear
[1:12:44] what my pastor had to say or the local
[1:12:46] ministry had to say
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and I can get caught up because the
[1:12:51] five-fold ministry has been given for
[1:12:52] your edification and the perfecting of
[1:12:54] the saints.
[1:12:57] But I I it seems like people's faith is
[1:12:59] deteriorating
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; and certainly there's been a lot of
[1:13:03] jokes that have raised up. But I say you
[1:13:05] ought to thank God that God has given
[1:13:06] you a God called pastor and a local
[1:13:08] five-fold ministry that loves the
[1:13:10] message of the hour and preaches the
[1:13:11] message and says what a messenger said
[1:13:13] and doesn't put his thoughts and his
[1:13:15] ideas and try to twist it and spit it,
[1:13:17] but brings the the unadulterated word of
[1:13:19] God and preaches it so you can live it
[1:13:21] and believe it and be free.
[1:13:27] And if all you can do is stream, well,
[1:13:29] we're glad you can stream. But I say
[1:13:30] there's nothing like being being
[1:13:32] gathered together of the saints of God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being able to come
[1:13:37] together.
[1:13:39] He said, you know, your reasoning says,
[1:13:41] "Well, a ain't this just as good?"
[1:13:43] That's just exactly when you see when
[1:13:45] you use those senses which is contrary
[1:13:47] to the word, then that's what the world
[1:13:49] wants you to see.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But faith don't look at that. Faith
[1:13:53] looks what God said.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; See, you know, you cast down reasons.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; cast it down.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; I If God didn't say it,
[1:14:11] leave it alone.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; So many times we listen to our thoughts
[1:14:16] and and listen to all these ideas and
[1:14:18] things that are contrary to the word.
[1:14:19] Look, if it's contrary to the word, cast
[1:14:22] it down.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, I believe in uh
[1:14:26] maybe his greatest battle ever fought,
[1:14:28] he said, he said, uh uh uh Satan's army
[1:14:30] brings diseases.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Satan's army brings all these things to
[1:14:34] throw it on. He said, "But God's army is
[1:14:36] commissioned to cast it out."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we start to cast
[1:14:43] out some of the things that have come on
[1:14:45] our lives. Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're battling
[1:14:48] nervousness, you ain't got to live like
[1:14:49] that.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; If you're battling anxiety, you don't
[1:14:52] got to live like that.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Satan put it on you. But I say, I got a
[1:14:56] commission
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; from Almighty God to cast it out.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; We can cast down reasoning, cast down
[1:15:02] imagination, cast down wickedness, cast
[1:15:05] down lust, cast down those demon
[1:15:07] spirits.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. You don't have
[1:15:13] to wonder.
[1:15:15] Some of us are so caught up with the
[1:15:17] past and and the things that we've gone
[1:15:19] through, we're we're worried and wonder,
[1:15:21] am I going to make it, brother Matt? Am
[1:15:23] I going to make it?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; The word says you're going to make it.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; The word said you already made it.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; That makes me happy because I've made a
[1:15:38] lot of mistakes. I've done a lot of
[1:15:39] things that I shouldn't have done, but I
[1:15:41] can look into my Bible and it tells me I
[1:15:44] chose you.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; When did he choose you?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; When when you when you finally made up
[1:15:52] your mind to do right?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; When did he choose you when you repented
[1:15:56] of your sins?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Did he choose you when you got baptized?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of
[1:16:03] the world. That ought to be enough right
[1:16:05] there to make you scream and shout to
[1:16:08] know that before the world was ever
[1:16:09] created, he wrote my name on the Lamb's
[1:16:12] Book of Life. And no matter how many
[1:16:14] times I fail,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I can't even mess it up.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Now, that ought to produce a love in
[1:16:21] your heart,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; not a license for for for living any
[1:16:26] kind of way you want.
[1:16:29] Some people, well man, I'm just
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I'm so justified and sanctified and
[1:16:33] predestinated, I can go to the bar.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Well, you know them by their fruits.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you got an intellectual faith,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; if you got an intellectual
[1:16:44] understanding, when you come into the
[1:16:46] presence of that pillar of fire,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; it'll change you.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "We can cast down
[1:16:54] all these things." He said, "You're
[1:16:55] above it, resurrected in Christ Jesus."
[1:16:58] setting in heavenly places with every
[1:17:00] devil under your foot.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to preach right there
[1:17:05] for a minute.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; We got we got men raising up and
[1:17:10] diminishing the power of God and and
[1:17:12] preaching a halfway gospel and a sofa
[1:17:14] religion and and making excuses for the
[1:17:17] flesh and the power of God in the
[1:17:18] individual's life. I say don't let any
[1:17:20] preacher diminish the power of God. God
[1:17:23] can have so control of you that the
[1:17:25] devil don't know what to do with you.
[1:17:27] You can be so surrendered. You can speak
[1:17:29] mountains into existence. You can speak
[1:17:31] them into the sea. You can speak
[1:17:32] squirrels into existence. Oh, brother
[1:17:34] Matthew, that was just for the prophet.
[1:17:35] That was a first one to maturity.
[1:17:38] Showing the bride of Jesus Christ, we're
[1:17:40] all coming to the stature of a perfect
[1:17:42] man. And if you have a need, if you say
[1:17:44] to this mountain, that puts you back in
[1:17:47] the word.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; If you say,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; We got uh men making excuses for the
[1:17:56] flesh. Well, you know, it's just going
[1:17:57] to it's just going to be that way and
[1:17:59] and you know, that's the way you were
[1:18:00] born and this and that. I rebuke that.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stop short of
[1:18:05] perfection. I'm not going to stop short
[1:18:07] of manifesting every promise that was
[1:18:09] spoke by Malachi 4:5.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I'll say like Paul said, "My preaching
[1:18:14] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:18:16] wisdom, but in power and demonstration
[1:18:18] of the Holy Spirit, that your faith not
[1:18:20] might not stand in the wisdom of man,
[1:18:22] but in the power of God."
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] Prophet of God picks that up and says
[1:18:27] the power of God to change the man.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know where we're the rest
[1:18:34] of the way we're going to go in the
[1:18:35] service, but I say one thing.
[1:18:37] Is there somebody here says, "I need to
[1:18:39] change."
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I need the power of God to change me,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. Make me more like you,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Lord. I I need more of you. I need that
[1:18:50] shaking. I need that repentance, Lord. I
[1:18:53] need that revival. Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see that word so
[1:18:56] manifested in my life. Lord, I I don't
[1:18:59] want to settle short. I don't want to
[1:19:00] stop short.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Look, friends, we have a message of
[1:19:04] restoration.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, everything that Adam has lost
[1:19:09] has been given back to the believer,
[1:19:11] full authority, full power.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Why would we stop short?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Like the children of Israel crossing
[1:19:19] over Jordan say, "Hey, we made it to the
[1:19:22] promised land.
[1:19:24] Well, yes and no.
[1:19:28] There's so much more God has in store
[1:19:30] for us, church.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Let's not stop short. Let's keep going
[1:19:34] upward and onward.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, there is a power
[1:19:39] here this morning to change you.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; There's a power here. There's a
[1:19:42] revelation here for you this morning.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is there somebody here
[1:19:48] that in your heart you you you're crying
[1:19:50] out for more revelation?
[1:19:54] Somebody,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; is there somebody that wants total
[1:19:58] victory over that thing that you've been
[1:20:00] battling?
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to wait any longer.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:08] forever, he's right here, right now.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart that that
[1:20:13] same pillar of fire that met Moses on
[1:20:15] the back side of the desert, he's here
[1:20:17] right now, this morning.
[1:20:24] When I read things like this in the
[1:20:25] message,
[1:20:27] when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in
[1:20:29] faith takes the word into his heart and
[1:20:31] places it upon his lips.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Why? That is the same as deity speaking.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Every mountain has to go.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to put Christ to a
[1:20:44] showdown.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; We're commissioned to cast out evil
[1:20:48] spirits. Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have you don't have to fear
[1:20:52] that thing that you've been battling.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; I say I pray God would anoint your faith
[1:20:58] this morning
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; to speak to that mountain.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Fear, you've plagued me long enough.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I I'm casting you down. Anxiety, you've
[1:21:08] plagued my life long enough. I I I'm
[1:21:10] speaking to you. Anxiety, there ain't no
[1:21:12] place for you anymore. The word has come
[1:21:14] and the pillar of fire is here to anoint
[1:21:16] my faith. You got to go, devil. Get out
[1:21:19] of my way. I cast you down in the name
[1:21:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lust, you got
[1:21:24] to go. Complexes, you got to go. Fear,
[1:21:27] you got to go. Devil, get out of my
[1:21:29] life. Get out of my family. Get out of
[1:21:31] my church.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I cast you down.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Speak to the mountain. Every mountain
[1:21:37] got to go.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You don't got to back up. That's right.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, you're just saying
[1:21:48] that. Well, I might be just saying that.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I've seen it.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Talking about a
[1:21:58] commission. I believe God's given your
[1:22:00] pastor a divine commission to go into
[1:22:02] all the world and preach the gospel. To
[1:22:03] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:22:05] recover, to cast out evil spirits.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; I believe I've been called. I believe we
[1:22:10] have a commission.
[1:22:13] Then I say, I am not afraid to put
[1:22:16] Christ to a showdown.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Faith knows where it's standing.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Fa There's no fear in faith.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; There's no fear in faith. Faith knows
[1:22:28] about it.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Faith got big, great, big muscles and
[1:22:32] hairs on the chest. Faith says, "Shut
[1:22:33] up." And everybody else sits down. I
[1:22:35] know where I'm at.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Well, do you know where you're standing
[1:22:39] at this morning? Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Then I say, why don't we quit tolerating
[1:22:42] some of the stuff that we're tolerating?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; We've allowed some things into our
[1:22:45] house. We've allowed some things into
[1:22:47] our home. We've allowed some
[1:22:48] entertainments in. We're doing some
[1:22:49] things we should not do. We've allowed
[1:22:51] atmospheres and complexes and things. I
[1:22:54] say it ought not to be that way.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; We We don't need a sixstep counseling
[1:22:59] program to fix it either.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I don't need to go down to some shrink
[1:23:03] down the street to fix my mind. All I
[1:23:06] need is Jesus. Just give me Jesus. Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ. the same yesterday, today, and
[1:23:10] he knows all about it. If you can just
[1:23:12] get to Jesus, and I want to tell you,
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ is here this morning, he
[1:23:16] can make the wrongs right.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He can fix your mind. He can fix your
[1:23:21] marriage. He can deliver you from lust
[1:23:22] and complexes and fear.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what I'm talking about.
[1:23:30] Scripture says, "For whosoever is born
[1:23:32] of God," 1 John 5:4, "For whosoever is
[1:23:36] born of God overcometh the world, and
[1:23:37] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:23:40] world, even our faith."
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; There is no fear in faith.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, you got five senses, but
[1:23:48] there's another six sense.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We just try to move towards a close
[1:23:52] here.
[1:23:55] The prophet of God said, "Moses never
[1:23:57] feared Pharaoh.
[1:23:59] He said he didn't care
[1:24:03] what Pharaoh said.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; The most mighty ruler in all the world.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Moses had a commission from God.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And once he came into that pillar of
[1:24:14] fire, the prophet of God said, "A man
[1:24:16] commissioned of God,
[1:24:18] he's enjoying his presence."
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I like that. I just want to enjoy
[1:24:24] his presence.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; I want to enjoy his word. I want to
[1:24:28] enjoy where I'm going. He said, "A man
[1:24:30] that's commissioned of God looks upward
[1:24:31] and onward." You don't have to care what
[1:24:33] the world says about it anyhow.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Well, my Bible says, "These signs shall
[1:24:38] follow them that believe. In my name,
[1:24:39] they shall cast out devils.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; They shall speak in tongues, they shall
[1:24:42] take up serpents, and if they drink any
[1:24:44] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[1:24:46] They shall lay hands on the sick, and
[1:24:47] they shall recover." Look, I do not have
[1:24:49] to look to the left and to the right. I
[1:24:51] don't have to fear, and I don't have to
[1:24:53] wonder. If somebody comes up for prayer,
[1:24:55] I am not wondering and questioning if I
[1:24:57] have a divine commission to take God at
[1:25:00] his word. And my God is not a liar. And
[1:25:02] if God anoints your faith to take God at
[1:25:05] his word, I say that mountain's got to
[1:25:06] go. Satan, you got to go. Cancer, you
[1:25:09] got to go. Sickness, you got to go.
[1:25:11] Fear, you got to go.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:18] Prophet of God said this. He said,
[1:25:22] just bringing this out of why Christ
[1:25:24] speak. He says the real Christian
[1:25:25] believer today, no matter what the
[1:25:28] church says, what anybody else says,
[1:25:31] when that light strikes
[1:25:34] and they see the very vindication of
[1:25:36] God, that pillar of fire hanging there
[1:25:39] and the signs and wonders that's
[1:25:40] promised, the scripture being laid in,
[1:25:43] it comes to life. Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I I don't know about you, but
[1:25:49] I believe as we are all predestinated
[1:25:51] sons and daughters of God that there is
[1:25:53] a seed laying there within you.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And you and you can you can try in your
[1:25:58] own efforts. You can run into the world.
[1:26:00] You can do all these things. Just as
[1:26:02] brother Bannon was laying in there about
[1:26:03] Moses, he had an intellectual faith, an
[1:26:05] intellectual standing that he was born
[1:26:07] for a purpose. And even though it was
[1:26:09] intellectual, he was intellectually
[1:26:11] right.
[1:26:12] He had been raised him and told him,
[1:26:14] "You were born for a purpose. You're a
[1:26:16] proper child." Moses knew he was born to
[1:26:19] be a deliverer. Moses, he knew the ways
[1:26:21] of his people. He was raised in church.
[1:26:23] He was raised in a message church. He
[1:26:25] knew he was going in a rapture. He he he
[1:26:27] knew that he was the bride of Jesus
[1:26:29] Christ, but it was all under an
[1:26:31] electoral faith. All the equipment was
[1:26:33] there. All the ability was there.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; He could quote the quotes. He could
[1:26:37] quote the prophet. He could say all
[1:26:38] those things and he'd be right.
[1:26:42] But yet the seed had never been
[1:26:44] quickened.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; It had never been made alive. You
[1:26:48] wonder, well, when I I start out, see,
[1:26:50] when when Moses tried to manifest the
[1:26:52] word in his own ability, it didn't work.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You wonder why sometimes we try to
[1:26:57] manifest the word and it doesn't work.
[1:26:59] Maybe it's in our own ability. It's not
[1:27:01] his time. It's not his season. You might
[1:27:03] not be the right person for it. You
[1:27:04] know, all those must.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Must be the time. Must be the season.
[1:27:07] Must be the right person.
[1:27:10] So many times something needs to be done
[1:27:11] and and it's the will of the Lord that
[1:27:13] it get done, but you ain't the right
[1:27:14] person.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that all right?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And that we've been taught that by a
[1:27:20] prophet.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; We got to wait for the time and the
[1:27:22] season. Sometimes the reason why we
[1:27:23] can't have an overcoming life,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; we're like Moses. You're trying to make
[1:27:28] this message work. Look, you can never
[1:27:30] make the message work in your flesh and
[1:27:32] you can never make it work in your mind.
[1:27:34] It will drive you insane
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; or you'll walk away.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; But if you ever come into the presence
[1:27:42] of that light,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me right now. If you
[1:27:47] ever come into the presence of that
[1:27:48] pillar of fire,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; it'll quicken that seed to life."
[1:27:54] I
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that woman at the
[1:27:56] well,
[1:27:58] how many times she had tried, how many
[1:28:01] mistakes, how many husbands
[1:28:05] buried in mistakes and failures and
[1:28:07] buried in religion.
[1:28:09] A and because of her own choices and her
[1:28:12] own mistakes, she was an outcast. And
[1:28:14] she's coming to the well
[1:28:18] and behold, there's somebody waiting on
[1:28:20] her.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] Maybe I can say it like that. Maybe
[1:28:24] maybe maybe you've been going through
[1:28:26] things and you've been wondering. But I
[1:28:28] want to say when you came here this
[1:28:30] morning, somebody was waiting on you.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; He knew all about your faults. He knew
[1:28:36] about your failures. He knew about the
[1:28:37] mistake. But he was waiting there for
[1:28:40] you.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "I got needs to go by Samaria."
[1:28:45] And to think in in all of her efforts
[1:28:47] and all of her struggles and all of her
[1:28:49] trials,
[1:28:51] buried in all of that, there was a
[1:28:53] predestinated seed. And all it needed to
[1:28:55] do was come into his presence.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Give me a drink.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; It's not customary for for us Samaritans
[1:29:04] to talk to you.
[1:29:07] If you knew who you were talking to, you
[1:29:09] would ask me for a drink.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing to draw with.
[1:29:14] Are you greater than our fathers, Jacob?
[1:29:17] There's coming a time where you'll
[1:29:18] neither worship on that mountain and
[1:29:19] this one.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, what what was he doing? He was
[1:29:23] catching our spirit.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Some of us, we allow our hearts to be so
[1:29:28] hard.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; We don't let the anointed word catch our
[1:29:31] spirit in the service. We're just so
[1:29:33] shut off and locked up. And I say, if if
[1:29:35] you'll just start communing just for a
[1:29:37] minute, say, Lord, you know, you're
[1:29:38] right. I'm just going to let you have
[1:29:39] the ride away, Lord. Come on.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I I want I want to talk it over. I I've
[1:29:44] been a little hurt and I haven't wanted
[1:29:45] to really talk about it much, but but
[1:29:48] Lord, I I'll I'll entertain for a
[1:29:50] minute.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; I start to open up my heart. He said,
[1:29:53] "Well, why don't you go get your
[1:29:54] husband?"
[1:29:57] You don't have a husband. You've told
[1:29:59] the truth and the one you're living
[1:30:00] with, you've had five. And the one you
[1:30:02] What was it doing? The word was starting
[1:30:03] to discern her heart.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; What was it? that it was that anointed
[1:30:08] word flashing upon that predestinated
[1:30:10] seed.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; And even in her condition,
[1:30:15] when that light struck that seed,
[1:30:17] something spoke back. I perceive that
[1:30:19] thou art a prophet.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; When Messiah comes,
[1:30:24] he will tell us these things.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I am He.
[1:30:30] And just in a moment in his presence,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; think of the years, think of the
[1:30:35] marriages, think of the hurt, think of
[1:30:37] the pain, think of how much she was an
[1:30:39] outcast.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And in a minute,
[1:30:44] all of her past.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Became a testimony. Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Now she's running back into the city.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Which once would have been,
[1:30:58] oh,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; I'm an outcast. I'm a sinner. Look at
[1:31:02] the things I've done. But now that she's
[1:31:04] been in his presence, come see a man
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; who told me all the things that I done.
[1:31:10] Is this not the Messiah? And she
[1:31:12] converted a whole town.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; But I want to say that same Jesus is
[1:31:17] here this morning.
[1:31:19] Maybe we'll just invite the musicians to
[1:31:21] come as we look for a place to close.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus is here
[1:31:31] that you can come into his presence.
[1:31:34] That that seed can be quickened, that
[1:31:36] seed can be made alive.
[1:31:39] My Bible tells me in Romans 8:35, "What
[1:31:42] shall separate us from the love of
[1:31:43] Christ? Shall tribulation, shall
[1:31:46] distress, persecution, famine,
[1:31:48] nakedness, peril, sword? As is, as it is
[1:31:51] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[1:31:53] the day long. We are counted as sheep
[1:31:55] for the slaughter.
[1:31:57] Nay, in all these things, we are more
[1:32:00] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:32:02] us.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Look, we have a commission. Take the
[1:32:05] land. Footsteps our possession. Total
[1:32:07] victory, total deliverance. You don't
[1:32:09] have to you don't have to uh uh settle.
[1:32:12] Come on.
[1:32:15] You don't have to settle for partial
[1:32:17] victory.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; brother. Brother Brandham goes in and
[1:32:21] and and it says about how, you know,
[1:32:23] Pharaoh
[1:32:24] once he started seeing all the plagues
[1:32:26] and everything, he finally told Moses,
[1:32:28] he said, "You know what, Moses, why
[1:32:29] don't you just just go worship
[1:32:33] and then come back?"
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God starts moving in our
[1:32:38] life and and we make a deal with the
[1:32:40] devil. Well, you can come to church
[1:32:42] three times or two times a week,
[1:32:45] but you know, come back to your job.
[1:32:47] Come back to your music. Come back to
[1:32:48] your entertainment.
[1:32:52] But I like how the prophet starts to
[1:32:53] talk about Moses.
[1:32:57] He said, "Haven't we got that today? If
[1:32:59] you just join church, that's all right."
[1:33:03] He said, "You know, the faith that Moses
[1:33:05] had didn't believe in a so far
[1:33:06] religion." He said, "We're all going.
[1:33:10] We're going all the way.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; We're going to the promised land.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; We just don't go out here and make a
[1:33:16] denomination and stop. We're going on
[1:33:18] through.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; I am going to the promised land God
[1:33:22] promised us.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Look, I want to tell you church, there
[1:33:24] ain't no obstacle. There ain't no Red
[1:33:26] Sea. There ain't no Pharaoh. There is
[1:33:28] nothing that can stop you from going
[1:33:30] upward and onward into every single
[1:33:32] promise that God has given you.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Look, this bride doesn't believe in a
[1:33:36] sofa religion. We don't believe in a
[1:33:38] halfway religion. We we we we believe in
[1:33:41] total victory. You don't have to settle
[1:33:43] for a halfway religion. You don't have
[1:33:45] to settle for a partial victory. You
[1:33:48] don't have to settle for your kids being
[1:33:49] out there in the world. I serve a God
[1:33:51] that's more than able. He can save your
[1:33:53] family. He can save your kids.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; We're all going and I ain't leaving a
[1:33:58] hoof behind.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Every blessing in the Bible is yours.
[1:34:02] Every promise for the age is yours.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:11] We're going all the way.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "It's just not me going.
[1:34:18] We're all going."
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "We got something to do.
[1:34:22] We've all got to be anointed."
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; I'd like to maybe end right around them
[1:34:28] lines. We all got to be anointed.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; You can't just depend on your mommy and
[1:34:34] your daddy.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; You can't just depend on the preachers.
[1:34:38] We all need one another. We all got to
[1:34:40] be anointed.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe we all just stand.
[1:34:49] Faith sees what God wants.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be delivered.
[1:34:56] God wants you to be healed. God wants
[1:34:58] you to be free. God wants to fill you
[1:35:01] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; God wants to end you with power on high.
[1:35:07] You know, I brought this quote up, so
[1:35:09] I'm going to read it because many times
[1:35:12] I feel like where a lot of us get stuck
[1:35:14] is
[1:35:16] we lack. And I say, "God, give me more
[1:35:18] revelation of this."
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; But how are we ever going to go into the
[1:35:22] greater works? How are we ever going to
[1:35:24] speak bounds? How are we ever going to
[1:35:26] do all these things when when we ain't
[1:35:27] got a a true revelation of
[1:35:29] justification?
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; We're still letting the devil uh remind
[1:35:33] us of our past. We're still letting
[1:35:34] things kind of overshadow us.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I wonder if it was all Hey, if it's
[1:35:38] under the blood, it's taken care of.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it like this. You
[1:35:43] are standing completely justified.
[1:35:47] Look, we're preaching about going upward
[1:35:48] and onward.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; We're talking about leaving the past
[1:35:51] behind.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; We're talking about don't look at what
[1:35:53] you were. Let's look at what you're
[1:35:55] going to be. My prophet said, "You're
[1:35:56] standing completely justified as though
[1:35:58] you never did it at the beginning."
[1:35:59] Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; This is my message to the church.
[1:36:05] He says,
[1:36:07] "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:36:09] bride of the son of the living God."
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Every man and woman that's born of the
[1:36:13] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:36:14] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:36:16] God stands as though you never sinned at
[1:36:19] the first place.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You are perfect.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to say this. If if if I
[1:36:26] could just catch a revelation, a greater
[1:36:29] revelation of that,
[1:36:34] then what do I got to be afraid of?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I'm justified.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I never did it in the first place.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; I'm perfect.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; That means I can take God at his word. I
[1:36:46] can march forward into every single
[1:36:48] promise. I don't have to be looking to
[1:36:49] the left and to the right. Well, what
[1:36:51] does so and so have to say about that?
[1:36:53] Well, maybe maybe I'm not this and maybe
[1:36:55] I'm not that. Don't be afraid to put
[1:36:56] Christ to a showdown.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:37:00] forever.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; A man that's commissioned of God looks
[1:37:05] upward,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and onward.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to care about what the
[1:37:10] world says about it anyhow. He's not
[1:37:13] listening to the world.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; He's got a divine commission from God
[1:37:18] and enjoying
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; that presence. I say, why don't we start
[1:37:23] enjoying his presence?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe as we just sing a song of worship.
[1:37:28] Let's get our eyes back on the word.
[1:37:29] Let's set our affections on the word,
[1:37:31] not on the things of the world. Start to
[1:37:34] look, hey, I I have a commission of
[1:37:36] almighty God.
[1:37:38] I I I got I got to possess my vessel in
[1:37:40] sanctification. I got to be a leader of
[1:37:42] my home. I got to be be a real husband.
[1:37:44] I got to be a real father. I I got to
[1:37:46] take this word and I got to press it
[1:37:48] into the coming of the Lord.
[1:37:51] I don't have to worry about my past, my
[1:37:53] failures. If I made a mistake, I plead
[1:37:54] the blood. I get back up. I go onward.
[1:37:56] If I'm not seeing the fruits of God in
[1:37:58] my life, go. You know where you're
[1:38:00] living.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You know whether you're living right.
[1:38:04] You know whether you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; And many times if you're hearing some
[1:38:08] negative condemnation, you don't got the
[1:38:10] Holy Ghost. You made a fail. You know
[1:38:11] what? Whenever you want to know the
[1:38:12] devil's lines when he's talking,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And that's where you say, "Well, if I
[1:38:16] don't got it, I got a promise. I'm going
[1:38:18] to get it. I'm going to keep going on
[1:38:19] with God. You ain't got don't don't
[1:38:21] argue. Don't wonder.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He who started the work in you is just
[1:38:25] and faithful to finish it.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; I say it's time to take the word of God
[1:38:29] and start beating back the devil.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said if he don't move
[1:38:32] the first time, what do you do? Hit him
[1:38:33] again.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Hit him again. I said, let's get back to
[1:38:36] enjoying the presence of Almighty God.
[1:38:38] God bless you.
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] trusting
[1:38:55] all these things will work for my good.
[1:39:00] He walks beside me.
[1:39:06] Heaven is in my view.
[1:39:11] I'm
[1:39:13] going to make it through.
[1:39:19] Will I say I'm
[1:39:23] going to make it?
[1:39:26] He all said I would.
[1:39:31] They
[1:39:33] just keep trusting
[1:39:36] all these things will work out for my
[1:39:40] good.
[1:39:42] He walks beside me.
[1:39:47] Heaven is in my view.
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:52] I'm
[1:39:54] going to make it through. Can you sing
[1:39:58] that with me this morning? Will I say
[1:40:02] that I'm
[1:40:04] going to make it?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; For he said that I would.
[1:40:13] I'll just keep trusting.
[1:40:17] All these things will work for my good.
[1:40:22] For he walks beside me and heaven is in
[1:40:29] my view.
[1:40:31] Oh, I'm
[1:40:34] going to make it through.
[1:40:39] For I know he
[1:40:42] walks beside me.
[1:40:45] Heaven is in my view.
[1:40:50] I'm
[1:40:52] going to make it
[1:40:56] through.
[1:41:02] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:41:04] Amen. Certainly appreciate brother Matt
[1:41:07] what he had to say. And how many say the
[1:41:10] Lord spoke to your heart this morning?
[1:41:12] Go ahead and just lift your hand.
[1:41:14] God bless you.
[1:41:20] Can we sing a key of CC?
[1:41:24] Well, shackled by a head,
[1:41:29] heavy burden.
[1:41:33] I was beneath
[1:41:36] a load of guilt and shame.
[1:41:44] Oh, but then this hand of Jesus
[1:41:48] reached down and touched me.
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] And now I am no longer
[1:41:58] the same.
[1:42:01] For I say
[1:42:03] he touched me.
[1:42:06] Oh yes, he touched me.
[1:42:13] And all
[1:42:15] the joy that floods my soul.
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:22] I know something
[1:42:24] wonderful happened.
[1:42:27] And now I know
[1:42:32] he touched me and made
[1:42:37] me whole.
[1:42:41] Well, ever since I met this blessed
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:47] savior,
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] since he cleansed and made
[1:42:56] me whole,
[1:43:01] I will never cease
[1:43:06] to praise him.
[1:43:10] Oh, I'll shout
[1:43:12] while eternity
[1:43:15] rolls. How many's been touched by the
[1:43:18] master's hand this morning?
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, my Lord, I know that you have
[1:43:25] touched me.
[1:43:28] And
[1:43:30] oh, what a revival
[1:43:33] that floods my soul.
[1:43:38] For I know something
[1:43:41] has happened.
[1:43:44] And now
[1:43:45] I can testify.
[1:43:48] He touched me and made
[1:43:52] me whole.
[1:43:56] Oh, ever since
[1:44:00] I met this blessed
[1:44:02] Savior.
[1:44:05] For ever since he cleansed and made
[1:44:11] me whole,
[1:44:17] I will never cease
[1:44:21] to praise him.
[1:44:25] And I'll shout it while eternity
[1:44:31] roll.

[1:47:35] song of your redeemed as the saints of
[1:47:39] every nation are awakening to sing. From
[1:47:44] our hearts there comes an anthem. Oh,
[1:47:48] hear the praises ring. This is our song.
[1:47:52] I sing to my king. Let the worshippers
[1:47:56] arise.
[1:48:00] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[1:48:06] Well, I'm surrendering my all.
[1:48:12] I surrender to the king. Let the
[1:48:16] worshippers arise.
[1:48:21] How many can rise this morning?
[1:48:24] Lord, I want to sing.
[1:48:28] Surrendering my all.
[1:48:32] Yes, my Lord. I surrender to the King.
[1:48:37] Let the worshippers arise.

[1:48:48] I'm surrendering my all.
[1:48:54] I surrender to the King.
[1:48:58] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[1:49:00] clap of praise this morning?
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:08] Amen. If we don't know it, we're going
[1:49:09] to learn it. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:12] Amen. Ain't no better time than now.
[1:49:13] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just certainly appreciate our
[1:49:18] brother speaking. We I just want to
[1:49:21] point out where brother Chris is right
[1:49:23] there. Brother Chris, raise your hand.
[1:49:24] Don't be embarrassed. Just go ahead and
[1:49:25] raise your hand. That's brother Chris.
[1:49:27] Amen. and y'all just turn around and and
[1:49:30] greet him this morning. They're they're
[1:49:32] our canons now. So, we just got
[1:49:36] everything moved in and his wife and
[1:49:38] family and so they certainly mean a lot
[1:49:40] to us and have had a desire to to be
[1:49:44] here for some time and so they've
[1:49:46] finally been able to get moved in. So,
[1:49:49] y'all just welcome them and if any way
[1:49:51] we can help and be reach out and be a
[1:49:53] support to them, we certainly uh want to
[1:49:56] do that. So, I just want to maybe I'll
[1:49:58] just give him a warm welcome this
[1:49:59] morning.
[1:50:01] God bless you, brother.
[1:50:05] And I know sister Sandy, we left her
[1:50:09] with her family there for a few days.
[1:50:10] And so, until she gets a a real ID and
[1:50:13] an up-to-date passport, uh she's she's
[1:50:16] going to be looking looking for a way to
[1:50:18] get I don't know how we got her out
[1:50:19] there. Sarah said they had to coax the
[1:50:22] people who let her in the airport. So,
[1:50:24] her passport was expired and the ID was
[1:50:26] out of date and they let her on the
[1:50:28] plane. I They'd have never let me by
[1:50:30] with that. But she's a sweet little lady
[1:50:32] and and they let her board the plane and
[1:50:34] she was a non-threat. And I don't know
[1:50:36] where how they gathered that. But um but
[1:50:40] see, we we certainly had a good time.
[1:50:42] But she had been witnessing to some of
[1:50:44] her uh grandkids. And last Thursday, um,
[1:50:48] we we went down to the river there and
[1:50:50] and baptized and had quite a little
[1:50:52] baptism service there, uh, Thursday and
[1:50:55] we baptized three of her grandchildren.
[1:50:58] And, uh, and I we was baptizing the boy.
[1:51:01] And then this, uh, young girl, Brother
[1:51:03] Brian, was part of the service there.
[1:51:05] And that young girl, she came there, she
[1:51:08] wanted to get baptized. And of course,
[1:51:09] you know, me as a being a pastor, I I'll
[1:51:11] baptize anybody. I don't I don't I'm not
[1:51:13] going to turn anybody away. we don't
[1:51:15] turn anybody away from communion. We
[1:51:16] don't turn anybody away from fellowship
[1:51:18] and we don't turn anybody away from
[1:51:19] baptism. And so they feel like that's on
[1:51:22] their their heart to do. We sure would
[1:51:24] never get in the way of that. And and so
[1:51:26] uh uh but this little girl, she walked
[1:51:28] in there and I said, "Do you I said, "Do
[1:51:30] you uh do you know what baptism means? I
[1:51:32] mean, cuz here she comes walking in the
[1:51:34] water." She said, "It means I want to
[1:51:36] live my life for God." I said, "Well,
[1:51:38] that's good enough revelation for me."
[1:51:40] Well, come on in here. Amen. So we just
[1:51:43] appreciate the Lord. Amen.
[1:51:46] I believe he can give that revelation to
[1:51:48] a little girl. Amen. And I think that if
[1:51:50] I if if that God is merciful, I think
[1:51:53] it's the mercy of God that he would give
[1:51:55] you that revelation as a child. Amen.
[1:51:57] And keep you through all the the things
[1:51:59] that we go through in this life. So we
[1:52:01] just appreciate what God has been doing.
[1:52:03] And a lot of these young people's been I
[1:52:05] know little Emma got baptized the other
[1:52:07] day and and uh and and one of uh brother
[1:52:11] Brian's nephew there had been baptized
[1:52:13] in in the past few weeks. So we just
[1:52:15] really appreciate what God is doing
[1:52:17] among the uh the young people. And you
[1:52:20] realize that's another generation of
[1:52:23] believers and and what we instill in
[1:52:25] them. I thank God. I thank God. But I
[1:52:28] heard a a song this morning that was
[1:52:30] talking about the uh the pre the
[1:52:32] preacher that prayed for the preacher
[1:52:33] that prayed for me. I thank God there
[1:52:35] was somebody that witnessed to them long
[1:52:38] enough that they would be able to
[1:52:39] witness to me. Amen. Otherwise, we'd be
[1:52:41] without hope. I appreciate our elders
[1:52:43] and uh standing on the word. And we have
[1:52:45] such wonderful elders in our church.
[1:52:48] This is a real it's a holiness church
[1:52:50] and we get so many compliments on the
[1:52:52] way that our our brothers and sisters
[1:52:54] present themselves in the world. And I'm
[1:52:56] so proud of you, all you young people
[1:52:58] and young brothers and sisters and how
[1:53:00] you present yourself. And uh it just
[1:53:02] every everywhere we go, we get
[1:53:04] compliments coming back from the camp of
[1:53:06] other churches and uh people
[1:53:07] complimenting our church and how that
[1:53:09] the uh the young people conduct
[1:53:11] themselves and the way they act and the
[1:53:13] way they dress and look. And so I just
[1:53:14] say God bless you. I I thank God that
[1:53:16] we're able to be a part of a church that
[1:53:19] would have that kind of a life. And and
[1:53:21] I I just I just appreciate what God is
[1:53:24] doing. And I appreciate brother Madd and
[1:53:26] just opening up his heart and and my
[1:53:28] what a what a reminder to keep our eyes
[1:53:31] on the things the look on the things of
[1:53:34] God and not the things of the world.
[1:53:36] Amen. My isn't that a isn't that a right
[1:53:38] thing that we ought to be able to follow
[1:53:39] the will of God regardless of what would
[1:53:42] happen in this world. Well, regardless
[1:53:44] of our job or our boss and you know,
[1:53:46] well, I'd like to serve God and Lord's
[1:53:48] put something on my heart, but you know,
[1:53:49] but what about if my boss wouldn't let
[1:53:51] me, but you know, but if the boss fires
[1:53:53] you, just go ahead and follow what God
[1:53:55] puts on your heart. That that ought to
[1:53:56] be our desire is just to go follow God.
[1:53:59] Amen. And once you get that place, God
[1:54:01] will work the rest of it out. I believe
[1:54:02] that. Do you believe that this morning?
[1:54:04] And and so we sure appreciate our
[1:54:06] brother just opening up and letting God
[1:54:08] use him this morning. And and we just
[1:54:11] want to be in that commission. We don't
[1:54:13] want to be unsettled. There's too many
[1:54:15] unsettled people today. And that brother
[1:54:17] opened up with that this morning. You
[1:54:19] know, talking about Moses. You know,
[1:54:20] Moses lost out on 40 years of years that
[1:54:24] God could have used him. He lost 40
[1:54:26] years because he was running instead of
[1:54:28] just following the pillar of fire,
[1:54:29] looking for an answer somewhere else or
[1:54:31] maybe I'll find it here, maybe I'll find
[1:54:33] it there. So unsettled. But whenever he
[1:54:36] met the pillar of fire, then God was
[1:54:38] able to use him. I thought, Lord, don't
[1:54:39] let me lose 40 years. Don't let me
[1:54:41] wander here and there and waste 40 years
[1:54:43] before I find that you could use me
[1:54:45] right there. Amen. So, I just thank God
[1:54:47] that he would bring a man uh to remind
[1:54:50] us of that. And brother Bram said we are
[1:54:51] following that same pillar of fire. Do
[1:54:53] you believe that this morning? Matter of
[1:54:54] fact, he said that same pillar of fire
[1:54:56] is what will lead us into the
[1:54:58] millennium. So, if you're not following,
[1:55:00] you're never going to be led into there.
[1:55:02] So, we have a pillar of fire that we're
[1:55:03] following after. He leads us right into
[1:55:05] his word and he he he he he corrects us
[1:55:08] sometimes and it ain't it ain't fun when
[1:55:10] you get talked to like a child
[1:55:12] sometimes. But but sometimes he but just
[1:55:14] like a good daddy after he corrects you,
[1:55:16] he tells you you're the you're the best
[1:55:18] son there ever was and you're you're the
[1:55:20] best you're the best player on the
[1:55:22] field. You're the you're the best one
[1:55:24] out there. You're the best kid in the
[1:55:25] school. And so we like a good a good
[1:55:27] heavenly father that can correct us and
[1:55:29] then encourage us. Amen. Don't you love
[1:55:31] that this morning that God cares enough
[1:55:33] about our needs to lead us? We sure love
[1:55:36] the Lord and and appreciate Brother
[1:55:38] Matt. And so we just want to bow our
[1:55:40] head. Brother Brian, could you close us
[1:55:42] in a word of prayer this morning?
[1:55:48] We bow our heads.
[1:55:51] Most gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[1:55:54] Father God, you sent your word to heal
[1:55:56] us, Lord.
[1:55:58] Father God, and so many times we've
[1:56:00] heard messages lately about the battle,
[1:56:02] Lord God. And we stand on a battlefield,
[1:56:04] Lord. Father God, and you sent Brother
[1:56:07] Matt unto us this morning, Lord God,
[1:56:09] that would tighten up our armor, Lord.
[1:56:12] Father, it would tighten up our helmet,
[1:56:14] tighten up our shield, Lord. Father, and
[1:56:16] sharpen our sword, Lord, that we could
[1:56:18] stand upon the very word, Lord God, and
[1:56:21] go to battle, Lord God. Give us the
[1:56:24] skill and the understanding, Lord, to
[1:56:26] fight the battle that lays before us,
[1:56:28] Lord. Father God, I pray, God, that you
[1:56:30] would give strength to Brother Matt,
[1:56:32] Lord God, as he poured himself out,
[1:56:34] Lord. Father God, be with him and his
[1:56:36] family as they travel, Lord God, not
[1:56:39] knowing what their itinerary is. But I
[1:56:41] know, Lord, one thing, Father God, he's
[1:56:44] on the field for you, Lord. And I pray
[1:56:46] Lord Lord that you would give him
[1:56:49] strength Lord to do what you've called
[1:56:51] him to do Lord knowing Lord God he's not
[1:56:54] backing down but going forward Lord and
[1:56:56] I know that every servant of God that is
[1:56:59] here this morning Lord every child of
[1:57:01] God that is here this morning no matter
[1:57:03] what age Lord they're going forward and
[1:57:06] upward Lord Jesus and I pray that you
[1:57:08] give each one of them strength to stand
[1:57:11] Lord God Father for I know if we do all
[1:57:13] we can do to stand Lord you'll swoop
[1:57:15] loop in, Lord, and you'll carry us
[1:57:17] through. Lord, I praise you for this
[1:57:20] church, for my pastor, for each member
[1:57:22] here. Lord, I thank you and I love them,
[1:57:25] each one. And we love you, Lord. Father,
[1:57:28] because you brought your word to us,
[1:57:30] Lord. Father, you didn't leave us out in
[1:57:32] the cold, Lord God, not knowing, Lord,
[1:57:35] what your word means to us, Lord.
[1:57:37] Father, you sent us a prophet, Lord,
[1:57:39] that read the love letter to us, Lord.
[1:57:42] Now we can go with assurance to know
[1:57:44] Lord God that we are yours and you are
[1:57:47] ours Lord. We love you and we praise you
[1:57:49] Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:58:08] My God is so much bigger than troules I
[1:58:13] feel.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say
[1:58:18] why would I hunger for power or riches
[1:58:22] or fame?
