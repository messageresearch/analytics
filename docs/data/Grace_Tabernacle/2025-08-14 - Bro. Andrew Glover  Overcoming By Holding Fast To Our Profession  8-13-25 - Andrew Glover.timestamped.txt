[36:01] atmosphere. Amen. And the beautiful
[36:03] thing about it is it's not still in
[36:05] Ohio. We brought it right back here home
[36:06] with us tonight. And the same God that
[36:09] was up there is right here tonight. And
[36:10] he's still saving, still healing, still

[36:14] he would do, he's still doing it. And we

[36:39] you all know Matt, he's always on the
[36:40] mission field. So, Amen. We know he's
[36:42] out there witnessing about the the
[36:44] things of God and enjoying some time
[36:46] with them. So, we pray the Lord just
[36:48] give him a wonderful time there and a a
[36:50] good trip back home. And maybe tonight
[36:52] we just bow our hearts with a word of
[36:53] prayer. I know there's many needs among
[36:56] us. We want to remember Sister Lillian
[36:58] tonight in prayer. Also remember Sister
[37:00] Sophie in prayer. And Amen. I know the
[37:02] Lord's here tonight. Maybe you have a
[37:04] special need upon your heart tonight.
[37:05] Something you just like to make it known
[37:07] by the lifting of your hand. I know God
[37:09] sees that hand and he knows the need.
[37:11] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we gather here
[37:14] on this Wednesday evening, we're very
[37:16] grateful for your presence, Lord. We
[37:18] don't ever want your presence to become
[37:20] common to us. Lord, we're thankful for
[37:22] the faith that's in our hearts tonight,
[37:24] Lord, to love you and to live for you.
[37:27] Lord, we want to take this moment
[37:28] tonight and just thank you for the place
[37:30] that you've given us, Father, Lord,
[37:32] together with believers of like precious
[37:34] faith. Lord, we're so thankful for a
[37:37] place that we can come and Lord, we can
[37:39] pull up to the table as it were and we
[37:41] can, Lord, rub shoulders with believers,
[37:43] Lord, and we can, Lord, express
[37:45] ourselves in your presence and we,
[37:47] Father, can feed upon your word and
[37:49] worship you without our guard up, Lord.
[37:51] Just a a clean atmosphere, Lord, where
[37:54] the power of God can move. We want to
[37:56] thank you for it tonight, Lord. We have
[37:58] come here tonight to serve you and to
[38:00] serve your children by the ministering
[38:02] of your word. Lord, you've seen every
[38:04] hand that was raised behind those hands
[38:06] or needs. Father, Lord, I pray for
[38:08] Sister Lillian. Father, may you touch
[38:10] her body, dear God. Lord, may you touch
[38:12] Sister Sophie. Lord, may you, Lord,
[38:15] bring that that gallbladder under
[38:16] control of the Holy Spirit. Father, for
[38:19] those that are home tonight, may be sick
[38:20] in their body. I pray the angel of
[38:22] healing would pass by every house
[38:24] tonight, dear God. Lord, for those that
[38:26] are away, may you keep your hand up on
[38:28] them, Father. And I pray Lord for
[38:30] brother Matt, sister Sarah there, sister
[38:32] Sandy Father with a family, oh God.
[38:34] Lord, may you just may you move among
[38:36] them in a special way. Give them a
[38:38] wonderful time in your presence, oh God.
[38:40] And Lord, I pray as we open your word
[38:42] tonight. May you send this spirit of
[38:43] wisdom and revelation into the building,
[38:46] Father, binding the hand of confusion
[38:48] that your word could find a right away
[38:50] in the hearts of your children. Now
[38:52] Lord, forgive us of our failures and our
[38:54] shortcomings. Lord, transform us tonight
[38:56] by thy word. Fill every empty vessel
[38:58] here. refill, oh God, and we'll be sure
[39:00] to give thee all the praise, all the
[39:02] honor, and all the glory. In the
[39:04] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[39:06] Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the
[39:09] believers says,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. How many believes he's
[39:13] in the building tonight? Amen. If you
[39:15] have your Bibles tonight, we want to go
[39:17] to the word of the Lord for just a few
[39:18] moments with you this evening. We want
[39:20] to turn to the book of Hebrews, the 10th
[39:22] chapter, the book of Hebrews, chapter
[39:24] 10, and also the book of Revelation,
[39:27] chapter 12. Amen. We have just a few
[39:30] things tonight here on our heart and we
[39:31] just pray it'll be a blessing to you, an
[39:33] encouragement. And Amen. Hebrews chapter
[39:36] 10 and verse number 22.
[39:39] Paul here writing, he says, "Let us draw
[39:43] near with a true heart in full assurance
[39:46] of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
[39:49] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[39:52] washed with pure water. Now, let us hold
[39:56] fast the profession of our faith. So,
[39:58] there's that approaching God. Let us
[40:00] draw near. And there's our speaking. Let
[40:03] us hold fast the profession of our faith
[40:06] without wavering.
[40:08] For he is faithful
[40:10] &gt;&gt; that promised.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we could say amen right
[40:14] there.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; He is faithful that promised. In the
[40:18] book of Revelation, the 12th chapter,
[40:20] Revelation 12 and verse number 11. I was
[40:24] planning to move ahead and and and
[40:26] thought tonight, but just a few more
[40:28] things on my heart from the things we've
[40:30] been speaking to you on. So, I just want
[40:31] to take a little more of it tonight if
[40:33] that's okay. In Revelation 12 and verse
[40:36] 11,
[40:38] and they put your name there.
[40:41] And they overcame him by the blood of
[40:45] the lamb.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and by the word of their
[40:49] testimony.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And they loved not their lives unto the
[40:53] death. So many people say, "If there's
[40:55] something the Lord could just do for me
[40:56] to overcome, he's already done his part.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; The blood is already there.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Now, your part is the word of your
[41:04] testimony." Amen. We ask Lord this
[41:07] evening to bless the reading of his word
[41:08] as you can have your seat here tonight.
[41:10] I want you by the help of the Lord, if I
[41:12] would take a title tonight for just a
[41:14] few moments here. I want to speak to you
[41:16] on this thought of overcoming by holding
[41:19] fast to our profession. Amen. Overcoming
[41:22] by holding fast to our profession.
[41:24] Brother Bram would preach a message
[41:26] 1959, "Thy seed shall possess the gate
[41:29] of his enemy." He would say, "If I
[41:31] should call it a subject just for a few
[41:33] moments, I would say this, thy seed
[41:36] shall possess the gate of his enemy." He
[41:38] said God had been trying Abraham to see
[41:41] if he would hold fast his promise with a
[41:44] heart that was an unadulterated faith.
[41:46] He said now you know there's so many
[41:48] people that can grasp the word for a
[41:51] minute. He said it seems real good to
[41:53] them and then after a few hours
[41:55] something comes along contrary to what
[41:57] the seeds seem to tell them and finally
[42:00] it'll wither away. He said then there's
[42:02] some that can keep it for a few days. He
[42:04] said but there's others now. Amen. I
[42:06] don't want to be in the first part of
[42:08] that. I want to be in this part. But
[42:09] there's others that seem to catch such a
[42:12] hold of it till they never let it loose.
[42:14] Amen. Amen. Jesus spoke of those in the
[42:17] time about where the seed fell on stony
[42:19] ground and on thorns and on thistles,
[42:21] but then some in good ground. So, Amen.
[42:24] There's some that can hold the word for
[42:26] just a few minutes. And then there's
[42:27] others can hold it, amen, for a few
[42:29] hours, but then there's others that can
[42:31] hold it, amen, and they never turn it
[42:34] loose. And I believe that those are the
[42:36] ones that are spoke of, amen, in
[42:38] Revelation 12. The ones, Amen, who will
[42:40] overcome their enemy, amen, by the blood
[42:43] of the lamb and by the word of their
[42:45] testimony. Now, as we've been speaking
[42:47] to you here on about the approaching God
[42:49] by saying the right thing, amen. Last
[42:51] time we were talking to you on this, we
[42:53] found out that the book that is
[42:55] unsealed, Amen, is no other book. And we
[42:58] found out that it's God's provided plan.
[43:00] It's a, amen, it's the opening of seven
[43:02] seals. And the time is at hand, amen,
[43:05] for someone to say what has been
[43:07] unsealed. Now, amen, as we as we close
[43:10] last Sunday, we spoke to you on this. We
[43:12] were speaking about how, amen, that it's
[43:14] not enough to thank it. You've got to
[43:16] speak it. And I just want to revisit
[43:18] that quote from the third seal. Brother,
[43:19] I'm speaking of the word returning to
[43:22] the bride. He said, "Now God full of
[43:24] mercy made a way, amen, to redeem that
[43:26] woman." How many knows the way to redeem
[43:28] was by the blood? He said, "Now he
[43:30] promised her, telling her, Amen, that
[43:32] sometime in the future, the true word
[43:35] would come to her again." He said, "See,
[43:37] the true word will be made known to
[43:40] her." Amen. I want to say tonight, the
[43:42] true word is foreign to organizations.
[43:45] It is foreign to denominations, but not
[43:47] to this bride. Amen. We are not waiting
[43:50] for the true word. We are in possession
[43:53] tonight, amen, of the true word that was
[43:55] prophesied to return to the church. He
[43:58] said, "Now remember that cuz he promised
[44:00] Christ through the woman." Amen. Christ
[44:02] is the word. Amen. You can turn these
[44:04] four monitors down and just leave it in
[44:06] my ear. Amen. Christ is the word. See,
[44:08] St. John 1, in the beginning was the
[44:10] word. Thank you. And the word was with
[44:12] God and the word was God and the word
[44:15] became flesh and dwelt among us. He
[44:17] said, now, Amen. God, the word dwelt
[44:20] with us in the flesh. He was the word.
[44:23] He said before a word, it's a fault.
[44:25] Right? Amen. And a thought has to be
[44:28] created. So God's thoughts become
[44:30] creation when it was spoke by a word. He
[44:33] said that's when he presents it to you
[44:35] as a thought. Amen. His thoughts and it
[44:38] is revealed to you. Amen. Then it's
[44:40] still a fault until you speak it. Amen.
[44:43] Amen. It's still a fault until you speak
[44:46] it. Amen. Or until you confess it,
[44:48] right? Amen. And to confess means to
[44:51] say, Amen. the same thing. Now, Amen.
[44:54] What makes a confession is when you are
[44:56] in union with the word. Amen. And you're
[44:59] saying the same thing the word is saying
[45:01] about the thing you're thinking about.
[45:03] Amen. I'll say tonight, God has unsealed
[45:06] the book to you. Amen. God has revealed
[45:08] the thought to you. Amen. These things
[45:10] are wonderful, but it's time to take
[45:13] another step.
[45:15] Amen. It's time to take another step and
[45:17] to speak it. Amen. And to confess it,
[45:20] and then it becomes a divine anchor
[45:22] within you. Now, amen. You all can agree
[45:24] tonight that we're living in a day and
[45:26] time, amen, of uncertainty. Everything
[45:28] around us is uncertain. And everyone is
[45:31] looking for something, amen, to give
[45:34] them hope. They're looking for something
[45:35] to hold on to. They're looking for
[45:37] something to satisfy them. Amen. The
[45:40] prophet of God would say, "The world
[45:41] we're living in is full of uncertain
[45:43] sounds." He He would say, "If the
[45:45] trumpet give an uncertain sound, Amen.
[45:48] then who shall prepare himself for the
[45:50] battle?" That word sound actually means
[45:52] the sound of uttered words. So, amen.
[45:55] Paul here is speaking to the Corinthians
[45:57] and many of them were soldiers in those
[45:59] days in the Roman army. Now, he said if
[46:02] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound,
[46:04] Amen. then who shall prepare himself?
[46:06] See, Amen. You've got to have the
[46:08] certainty of anything. See, we got to
[46:11] know whether it's right or whether it's
[46:13] wrong. Amen. I don't believe there ever
[46:15] was a time since the first time, Amen,
[46:18] in the Garden of Eden when sin came in.
[46:20] Amen. And broke eternity into time. He
[46:23] said, I do not believe there's ever been
[46:25] a space of time with so much uncertainty
[46:28] as today. Now, amen. That ought to make
[46:30] you that ought to take some pressure
[46:32] off. Amen. There's never been a time of
[46:35] uncertainty. Amen. Like it was today
[46:38] since the Garden of Eden. Amen. because
[46:40] there's not one hope left in the natural
[46:43] world today. But I don't want to leave
[46:45] it on the negative side. I I don't want
[46:47] to leave it on the gloom and doom side.
[46:49] I want to tell you, amen. There may not
[46:51] be hope in this world, but God who is
[46:54] rich in mercy has sent a message into
[46:56] this generation. And it's not an
[46:58] uncertain sound. It's a certain sound.
[47:01] Amen. The church of the living God is
[47:03] not idle. Amen. Amen. She's not wasting
[47:05] her time. Amen. But we're in a battle.
[47:08] Amen. It's not a national battle. It's
[47:10] not a political battle. It's a spiritual
[47:12] battle. And the prophet of God said,
[47:14] "It's the battle for truth." Amen. Amen.
[47:17] The last thing the devil wants coming
[47:19] into this service tonight, amen, is the
[47:21] truth. Because he knows, amen, if you
[47:24] meet the truth, he shall know the truth.
[47:26] And the truth shall make you free. But I
[47:28] want to tell the devil tonight, there's
[47:30] not enough he can do, amen, to defeat
[47:33] the truth of God. The truth is not
[47:35] coming. The truth is here. It is here
[47:38] tonight. And if you want to be free in
[47:40] your spirit, if you want to be free in
[47:42] your confession, if you want to be free
[47:44] in the Holy Ghost, you ain't got to take
[47:46] a backseat to that devil and believe his
[47:48] lies and believe his negativity. His
[47:51] word is the truth and it's here if you
[47:54] can confess it. Amen. We're not in a
[47:56] natural battle. Amen. We're not in a
[47:58] flesh and blood battle. Amen. We're in a
[48:00] spiritual battle. Amen. Can I tell you
[48:02] what our spiritual battles are today? We
[48:05] We Is that okay? Amen. to stay positive
[48:08] while surrounded by negativity. Amen. To
[48:11] stay sound while surrounded by
[48:14] unsoundness. Amen. To stay certain while
[48:17] surrounded by uncertainty. Amen. To stay
[48:20] stable while surrounded by instability.
[48:24] Amen. That's our battle today. But I
[48:26] want to tell the devil again, it may
[48:28] look like I'm surrounded by
[48:30] unstableness. It may look like I'm
[48:32] surrounded, amen, by unsoundness. Hey,
[48:34] but my Bible says there is a host of
[48:36] angels that will gather around the
[48:38] subjects of God. It may look like we're
[48:41] surrounded, but we're not surrounded
[48:43] just by enemies. We're not surrounded
[48:45] just by problems, but there's a mighty
[48:47] angels of God in this building tonight.
[48:50] We're surrounded by the Lord.
[48:52] Hallelujah.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; We're not just here as church members.
[48:56] Amen. But we are soldiers in the battle
[48:58] for truth. Amen. Can I tell you some
[49:01] good news? You didn't choose to be a
[49:03] soldier. He chose you. You didn't sign
[49:06] up, brother David Paul, for this army.
[49:08] Amen. God signed you up before the
[49:10] foundation of the world. That's why Paul
[49:12] said that no man warth and tangled
[49:15] himself with the affairs of this life
[49:17] that he may please him who hath chosen
[49:20] him to be a soldier. Amen. God chose you
[49:24] to be a soldier in the army of the
[49:26] living God. I love how the prophet of
[49:28] God will say it. It almost breaks your
[49:30] heart when he says it. He says, "You
[49:31] know, the Army of the United States,
[49:33] they didn't receive me because I suppose
[49:36] there were men more eligible." He said,
[49:38] "But I'm glad that I got enlisted in the
[49:41] army of the Lord and he gave me a
[49:44] uniform." Brother Joel, the world might
[49:46] have rejected us. Denominations might
[49:48] have pushed us aside. Amen. But God
[49:51] chose us to be a soldier in the army of
[49:54] the living God. Listen, I don't know a
[49:56] greater honor tonight than to know that
[49:58] I have been chosen by the King of Kings
[50:00] and the Lord of Lords to be a soldier in
[50:03] the army in the battle of truth to
[50:05] overcome every devil that's come against
[50:07] the church. Amen. We are in the army of
[50:09] the Lord. Amen. Then in this army,
[50:11] soldiers, Amen, they must find their
[50:14] position. Amen. Amen. Every soldier has
[50:16] a position. Now, here's the thing. You
[50:19] got to find your position and you got to
[50:22] hold your position. He said, "See, the
[50:24] great battle is at hand. We've played
[50:27] church for years and years, but the hour
[50:29] has come now that when Janice and
[50:31] Jambers will withstand Moses
[50:35] &gt;&gt; as the Bible said they would, it's going
[50:38] to be spiritual battle. It's going to be
[50:41] spiritual conflict." He said, "There
[50:43] will be some that will just continue on.
[50:45] The denominational church will just move
[50:47] right on into denomination and go the
[50:50] way it goes." But I mean the real true
[50:53] believer is coming to that battlefield
[50:56] and you had better be versed and know
[50:58] that what you're doing or you could take
[51:00] an evil spirit. Amen. So easy and not
[51:03] know it. Now can you take a prophet's
[51:05] word? If it's contrary to the word then
[51:08] don't you believe it. Amen. You stay
[51:11] with that word. If it's contrary to the
[51:14] word don't you believe it. You stay with
[51:17] that word. In the last days, he said,
[51:19] what's it going to take to stand? It's
[51:21] going to take a scriptural trained
[51:23] church on the line for there's going to
[51:26] be carnal impersonations arise. Now,
[51:29] amen. Paul says it like this. He says,
[51:32] "Prove all things and hold fast to that
[51:35] which is good." Now, I'll say this.
[51:37] There's one thing the Christian soldier
[51:39] must do is he must hold fast. Amen. It's
[51:43] not enough to get idle. It's not It's
[51:45] you can't get complacent. you you can't
[51:48] get discouraged and and you can't get
[51:49] all tore up and you Amen. cuz that demon
[51:52] of nervousness will move you right out
[51:53] of your position. That demon of anxiety
[51:56] will move you Amen. right out of your
[51:58] position. That demon of complacency will
[52:01] move you right out of your position. But
[52:03] as the sons and daughters of God are
[52:06] coming to the battlefield in the
[52:08] greatest battle that's ever been fought,
[52:09] I want to tell that devil, you might
[52:12] have moved the first Eve, but you won't
[52:14] move the second Eve because she's not a
[52:16] man-made bride. She's not a church age
[52:19] bride. She's a word born bride. The word
[52:22] has moved into her soul and she's a
[52:24] living manifestation of all the
[52:27] authority of that word. Yes, sir. Hold
[52:29] fast. Amen. He said, in other words,
[52:31] grip it. Amen. Don't turn it loose. Hold
[52:34] it fast. Amen. Hold it tight so that it
[52:37] will not slip. Hold fast to that which
[52:39] is good after it's been proven right. So
[52:42] when something has been proven right.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That's the time to get a hold of it and
[52:49] grip it and don't turn it loose. Amen.
[52:51] See, and anything that's proven not
[52:53] right, then turn it loose as quick as
[52:56] you can. Get away from it. Don't you
[52:59] never hold on to the wrong thing. See,
[53:01] now it's possible that staunch
[53:04] Christians find people hold sometimes to
[53:07] the wrong thing. Amen. Thinking that
[53:10] it's right. Amen. So, there's the key.
[53:13] You can hold to the wrong thing, but
[53:15] what's holding you to it is your
[53:17] thinking.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. You can be
[53:20] holding the wrong thing, but what's
[53:22] holding you to the wrong thing is your
[53:25] thinking. I love what Paul tells Timothy
[53:27] in 2 Timothy 1:13. He says, "Now hold
[53:30] fast the form of sound words." He said,
[53:34] "Which thou has heard of me in faith and
[53:36] love which is in Christ Jesus." Look at
[53:39] this word sound. It means to be in good
[53:42] health. It it is used of Christians
[53:45] whose opinions are free from any ad
[53:48] mixture of error. So if they're sound
[53:50] words, they're not full of contaminated
[53:53] error, but they're free of error. Now I
[53:56] find it amazing, brother Ed, that there
[53:58] is a connection, amen, between our words
[54:01] and our health. Amen. There's a
[54:03] connection between what we say and the
[54:05] health that we have. John said it like
[54:07] this. He said, I wish above all things
[54:09] that thou mayest prosper and be in
[54:12] health even as thy soul prosperth.
[54:14] Brother Bram come along and said, "God's
[54:16] got in his bounties of blessings,
[54:18] everything we have need of, all the
[54:20] vitamins, everything that we have need
[54:22] of to make us full, sturdy, healthy
[54:25] Christians." Amen. Filled with the Holy
[54:28] Spirit. Amen. Washed in his blood. What
[54:31] a time of fellowship we can have. See,
[54:34] it's a spiritual strength. Amen. Amen. I
[54:36] love what he says. He said, "Look, if we
[54:38] set ourselves off from the glory of God,
[54:40] from the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[54:42] the fellowship of the spirit, the first
[54:44] thing you know, we become pale, sickly
[54:47] Christians. Our experience is growing
[54:50] out and dim. And when the great trials
[54:52] come, amen, we shrink and go back." It
[54:55] takes that soldier who has lived in the
[54:58] sunlight of God. It takes the spirit who
[55:00] knows God when there's not a wave of
[55:03] doubt. They can stand in the midst of
[55:05] trouble and they can cry out, "My
[55:08] redeemer liveth." Oh, church, I want to
[55:11] tell that devil, these young people that
[55:13] have just returned from youth camp are
[55:15] not a bunch of emotionally worked up
[55:17] young people. These are sons and
[55:19] daughters of God who've got a revelation
[55:21] in their soul and they can stand in the
[55:24] middle of trial. They can stand in the
[55:26] middle of test and say, "I know my
[55:28] redeemer liveth."
[55:31] The prophet of God said, "We want a
[55:32] healthy Christian that has a healthy
[55:34] spirit." He said, "Brother, that soul
[55:36] cannot get too healthy." Amen. That soul
[55:40] cannot get too healthy. Amen. I'll say
[55:42] this. The words of Christ, Amen, are the
[55:45] vitamins to the soul of the soldiers in
[55:47] the army of the living God. And I want
[55:49] to tell you, the words of Christ are not
[55:51] suggestions. The words of Christ are not
[55:54] opinions. The words of Christ are
[55:56] absolute. They are not theories. They
[55:59] are not philosophies. They are not
[56:01] educated guesses. Amen. People live by
[56:04] theories and they live by philosophies
[56:06] and they will perish by those theories.
[56:08] They will perish by those philosophies.
[56:10] They will perish by those feelings. Hey,
[56:13] but a prophet said, "Amen." Jesus had to
[56:16] die to produce eternal life. Now, listen
[56:19] closely, Christian friends, unless you
[56:21] die to yourself and your feelings and
[56:24] act on God's word, you'll never have
[56:27] life. Now, can you take a prophet? Amen.
[56:30] Forget your feelings and just take what
[56:33] God said. Amen. Your feelings are not
[56:36] absolute. They change. They're up one
[56:38] day and they're down the next. Amen.
[56:40] You're happy one minute and sad the
[56:42] next. But if you ever anchor to
[56:44] something that goes beyond philosophy,
[56:47] it goes beyond theories. It's tied into
[56:50] the word of God. It don't matter. Come
[56:52] hell or high water, you'll be in the
[56:54] house of God with your hands up in the
[56:56] air saying, "Hallelujah. Thank you,
[56:58] Jesus. You've been so good to me." Hey,
[57:01] this is not a church full of pale,
[57:04] sickly Christians. These are healthy
[57:06] Christians. These are sons and daughters
[57:08] of God that are standing on the
[57:10] battlefield with a healthy soul and the
[57:13] power of God in their heart. Yes, sir.
[57:16] Amen. God's words ought to be held fast
[57:18] to. God said, "Hold fast to his words."
[57:21] Can I say this? His words are sound
[57:24] words.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I take it a step further? And
[57:28] we are judged by those sound words.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus stood there and said,
[57:34] "Heaven and earth will pass away,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; but my words."
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Well, that ought to make you say, "Amen.
[57:41] The heavens and earth will pass away,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; but my word shall never pass away."
[57:47] Amen. The word will judge us in the last
[57:49] day. He said, now see, the word of truth
[57:52] was the criterion then, it's the
[57:55] criteria now. He said, there isn't
[57:57] another standard. There isn't another
[58:00] plum line. He said, see, as he stood
[58:02] there with the word, he was examining
[58:05] their lives in the light of the
[58:07] blueprint he had laid out for them. and
[58:10] he must have been pleased in a goodly
[58:12] measure. For they, like the others who
[58:15] had gone on before, were enduring the
[58:18] persecution of the unjust, and still
[58:21] joyfully cleaving unto the Lord. He
[58:24] said, "Difficult though it was at times
[58:26] to serve the Lord." Amen. Can I get a
[58:28] witness here tonight? Amen. Difficult
[58:30] though it is at times, Amen. to serve
[58:33] the Lord.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; We got any humans here tonight?
[58:36] difficult though at times it is to serve
[58:39] the Lord yet they served him and brother
[58:42] Morgan they worshiped him in spirit and
[58:44] in truth. That's why the devil hates
[58:46] this church is we don't just worship
[58:48] when things are going good. We don't
[58:51] just bless his name when everything's
[58:53] working well. We bless him in the face
[58:55] of difficulty. We worship in the face of
[58:57] adversity because we're not just church
[59:00] members. We're soldiers in the battle of
[59:02] the Lord and we're here to do deals with
[59:04] God and defeat the devil.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. With a false vine,
[59:10] it was not so. He said, "Alas, they
[59:12] reputed the life that is built upon the
[59:15] word and we're now going further and
[59:17] further away from the truth." He said,
[59:19] "Their actions bore witness."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Their actions bore
[59:25] witness to the depths to which they had
[59:27] sunk.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[59:30] You don't have to tell me you're going
[59:32] through something.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Your actions bear witness
[59:41] &gt;&gt; to the thing you're going through.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; See, but I want to say this. We ought to
[59:45] let the Holy Ghost become the absolute
[59:47] of our life.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And then we should let the devil become
[59:51] the dictator of when we praise God and
[59:54] when we don't. Cuz I'll tell you what my
[59:56] prophet said. He said cloudy skies are
[59:59] no sign of God's disapproval. And he
[1:00:01] said sunny skies are no cloud of God's
[1:00:04] disapproval. And I just want to go on
[1:00:06] record tonight and say the devil might
[1:00:08] have done everything he could. Amen. And
[1:00:10] flew against us, brother Mark. Amen. But
[1:00:12] I want to tell the devil, he didn't win.
[1:00:14] He didn't win in one situation. He
[1:00:16] didn't win in one problem. He didn't win
[1:00:18] in one circumstance. Sister Destiny, no
[1:00:21] matter how dark it got, no matter how
[1:00:23] hard it got, Amen. God still remained
[1:00:26] God. because he who promised is faithful
[1:00:29] and he'll work it out for his good and
[1:00:31] we'll just worship him while he's doing
[1:00:33] it.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. I don't think we
[1:00:37] ought to let the devil dictate our
[1:00:39] praise.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to let the devil
[1:00:43] take control of our profession.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Brother said it beautiful. He said
[1:00:47] there's a force behind words. Do you do
[1:00:50] you know many times we underestimate
[1:00:52] Amen. the force behind our words? You
[1:00:55] know what Solomon said? He said, "Please
[1:00:57] words are as a honeycomb. They are sweet
[1:01:01] to the soul and they are health to the
[1:01:03] bones." Brother, sister, the words,
[1:01:06] amen, are honeycombs. They are sweet to
[1:01:09] the soul and they are health to the
[1:01:11] bones.
[1:01:13] Words carry great power. And wise people
[1:01:16] speak words that have a powerful impact.
[1:01:19] They edify the hearts and the lives of
[1:01:22] others. That's it from a commentary.
[1:01:23] Take or leave it. It's not of authority.
[1:01:25] Proverbs 25:11, "A word fitly spoken is
[1:01:29] like apples of gold in pictures of
[1:01:32] silver." Again, a commentary. Saying the
[1:01:35] right thing in the right way at the
[1:01:37] right time can be very effective in
[1:01:40] making peace with another person.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; The reference to gold apples is a silver
[1:01:46] setting describes something that is both
[1:01:48] exceptionally beautiful and extremely
[1:01:51] valuable. It applies and it illustrates
[1:01:55] the benefits of well-chosen, properly
[1:01:57] spoken words, amen, that bring
[1:02:00] reconciliation.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you if you had a little
[1:02:04] cross word with your wife, for your
[1:02:05] husband, Amen, before church, Amen. It
[1:02:08] probably is the time to tell them the
[1:02:09] cornbread was cold or
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:02:16] If things been a little up and down, it
[1:02:18] probably ain't the time. See, you got to
[1:02:20] choose your words because words can
[1:02:23] drive things further apart or words can
[1:02:26] bring things closer together. Do you see
[1:02:28] what the prophet of God said? He said
[1:02:30] that brings reconciliation. There's
[1:02:33] power behind our words. And I love what
[1:02:35] Solomon says in Ecclesiastes 12:11. He
[1:02:38] said, "The words of the wise are as
[1:02:39] goats and his nails fastened by the
[1:02:42] masters of assemblies which are given
[1:02:44] from one shepherd." Isaiah 50 and:4,
[1:02:47] "The Lord God hath given me the tongue
[1:02:48] of the Lord." How many How many could
[1:02:50] say, "Lord, give me the tongue of the
[1:02:51] learned." Amen. The Lord God has given
[1:02:54] me the tongue of the learned that I
[1:02:55] should know how to speak a word in
[1:02:58] season to him that is weary.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. If somebody's already weary, it
[1:03:04] ain't the time to tell them. You noticed
[1:03:05] in church they didn't hardly raise their
[1:03:07] hand.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody's already down, it
[1:03:11] ain't the time to tell them you noticed
[1:03:13] they ain't been there in a few services.
[1:03:15] It's the time to look at him and say,
[1:03:17] "Listen, I know the devil's fighting you
[1:03:19] and trying to keep you out of the house
[1:03:20] of God." But I want to tell you, I'm
[1:03:22] praying for you. I want to tell you, I'm
[1:03:24] pulling for you. I want to tell you, I'm
[1:03:26] on your side. I want to tell you, hell
[1:03:28] may be against you, but greater is he
[1:03:30] that is with us than he that is against
[1:03:32] you. I say we ought to get the tongue of
[1:03:35] the Lord.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prodigal God said, "I can't do
[1:03:38] very much about the conditions today."
[1:03:40] That's what you say. He said, "But just
[1:03:42] a little kind word to someone.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Just a little kind word to someone as an
[1:03:49] invitation, a little testimony, a little
[1:03:52] kind smile or a greeting to a passer by
[1:03:56] might mean more than you think it does."
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that ain't much." Well,
[1:04:01] I want to say this. Amen. It's not the
[1:04:03] quantity of the words, folks. Amen. It's
[1:04:06] the quality of the words that's spoken.
[1:04:10] Now, y'all know I'm telling the truth.
[1:04:12] Amen. There's people can say paragraphs
[1:04:13] to you and you didn't feel a thing from
[1:04:15] it, but let somebody else say just a
[1:04:18] sentence to you and you feel such a
[1:04:20] charge. Yes, sir.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Amen. I believe God puts
[1:04:24] encouragers in the body. Amen. I don't
[1:04:26] want to I don't want to single Brother
[1:04:27] Brian out, but I just want to take a
[1:04:29] minute here and say, "God bless you,
[1:04:30] brother Brian." Amen. What a what a
[1:04:32] brother of encouragement. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:34] I'm praying for you. You're going to
[1:04:36] make it. Amen. God is with us. I love
[1:04:38] you. Amen. The devil may tell you you're
[1:04:40] wasting your breath. Amen. But my Bible
[1:04:43] says the words can bring healing and
[1:04:45] strength to those that are weary.
[1:04:47] Listen, I want to say this. Amen. You
[1:04:49] ain't got to get a sermon together for
[1:04:51] somebody. Just get in the presence of
[1:04:53] God and let the power of God drop over
[1:04:55] you and you'll walk by him and say, "You
[1:04:57] know what? You're my brother. You're my
[1:05:00] sister. We're going to fight this devil.
[1:05:02] We're going to overcome because greater
[1:05:04] is he that is in us than he that is in
[1:05:06] the enemy against us.
[1:05:09] The Bible says in Genesis 1:3, you know,
[1:05:12] this whole earth you're sitting on
[1:05:14] tonight is the result of the spoken
[1:05:16] word.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know, brother Joe, God did not
[1:05:19] use paragraphs to create the earth
[1:05:20] you're sitting on. He used three little
[1:05:23] words. Let there be.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Let there be. And there was a sun. Let
[1:05:31] there be. And there was an earth. Let
[1:05:33] there be. And there was a moon. Let
[1:05:35] there be. And there was water. Let there
[1:05:37] be. And there was a firmament.
[1:05:40] Are you hearing me? It wasn't the amount
[1:05:42] of words. It was what was behind those
[1:05:45] words. Oh, church of the living God, the
[1:05:48] power of creation was behind those three
[1:05:50] little words, let there be.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You know, when the Bible says in St.
[1:05:55] John 11:17 that when Jesus came to the
[1:05:58] grave of Lazarus, he found where he had
[1:06:01] been laying for four days. You know what
[1:06:03] the prophet of God said? He said, "These
[1:06:05] little words here tonight of these four
[1:06:08] letters that's been read from the text,
[1:06:10] they conceal your eternal destination.
[1:06:13] It's your attitude towards them." That's
[1:06:16] right.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Let there be, brother Wesley. And the
[1:06:19] earth was created. Here the prophet of
[1:06:21] God says, "And and I show myself. And
[1:06:25] then Jesus came." Four words. And then
[1:06:29] Jesus came. You know what the prophet of
[1:06:31] God said? He said those little words
[1:06:33] could set you free from sin tonight.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; He said those little words could condemn
[1:06:39] you tonight. He said those little words
[1:06:41] could set you free from sickness and
[1:06:44] suffering tonight if you will receive
[1:06:47] them. But they've got to be received. So
[1:06:52] do you see it don't matter how much is
[1:06:54] spoken unless you receive what's being
[1:06:57] spoken it'll never have an effect upon
[1:06:59] you. Amen. And I think what Peter said
[1:07:02] in Acts 2:41, he said, "Then they that
[1:07:05] gladly received his word were baptized,
[1:07:08] and the same day they were added to
[1:07:10] them, about 3,000 souls." Amen, brother
[1:07:13] Mark. 3,000 souls were the results of
[1:07:17] the words of God spoken through Peter,
[1:07:20] but they never affected nobody until
[1:07:22] they were received.
[1:07:25] Now, I can tell y'all something. Amen.
[1:07:27] The word will never affect you until you
[1:07:30] receive it.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know people can talk about you,
[1:07:34] they can ridicule you, they can
[1:07:36] criticize you, and it will never affect
[1:07:39] you until you receive what they're
[1:07:41] saying about you.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I picked that devil up.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; It'll never affect you until they until
[1:07:49] you receive what they're see. Amen.
[1:07:52] People been talking about me since I
[1:07:53] started preaching. He's too loud. He's
[1:07:55] too quiet. He's too revelated. He's too
[1:07:57] this. He don't say this. He's too deep.
[1:07:59] He's Amen. They've said all kinds of
[1:08:01] things. Amen. He's too emotional. He
[1:08:03] sweats too much. He Amen. But you know
[1:08:05] what? It's never affected me because
[1:08:08] I've never embraced what they think
[1:08:09] about me because they didn't die for me.
[1:08:12] They didn't reveal the God to me.
[1:08:15] They didn't give me my family. They
[1:08:17] didn't give me my future. So, I don't
[1:08:19] care what they say about me. And I think
[1:08:21] it's time for some of you to turn loose
[1:08:24] of what people think about you. and what
[1:08:26] people whisper about you. And come back
[1:08:28] to the word of God and get a hold of a
[1:08:30] profession from the word of God. The
[1:08:33] word says I'm fearfully and wonderfully
[1:08:35] made. The word says I'm an overcomer.
[1:08:38] The word says greater is he that is in
[1:08:40] me than he
[1:08:43] that is in the world. See, the word is
[1:08:45] not the paper.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; It's just a book, but it's Christ made
[1:08:51] manifest on the paper. He said, "So we
[1:08:53] just receive his word like it was he
[1:08:56] himself. When I see his promise to me,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; that's Christ."
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "I embrace it.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; He can't lie.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; To me, that's exactly the truth. Now, I
[1:09:09] might not know how to take a hold of it,
[1:09:12] but it's the truth.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And I hold right with it because it's
[1:09:17] Christ to me." He said, "Then when God
[1:09:20] speaks a word, it's already finished."
[1:09:24] What about his promises that he's given
[1:09:26] us, everything he has said, "It's
[1:09:29] already a finished work." He said, "So
[1:09:32] therefore, when we receive his word into
[1:09:35] our heart, it's already done. It's
[1:09:39] completed."
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; See, every word in the Bible is God's
[1:09:43] thoughts laying in seed form. And if
[1:09:46] they're received into the human being
[1:09:49] and spoke, oh God, and spoke by the same
[1:09:53] thought that materialized the Bible,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; folks, I don't have enough room up here
[1:09:58] to preach. The same God that was
[1:10:00] thinking is the same God that's in you.
[1:10:03] You say, "Preacher, how can you say
[1:10:04] that?" Because we now have the mind of
[1:10:07] Christ. We now have the mind of Christ.
[1:10:11] You know why you're a powerful people?
[1:10:13] You know why this is a powerful bride?
[1:10:15] It's because the same mind that was in
[1:10:18] Christ has come into the bride. She's
[1:10:21] thinking the way he thinks and things
[1:10:23] are materializing because of the mind.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. The same
[1:10:31] thought that materialized the Bible
[1:10:34] brings the thing to pass.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; What a power has been given to the
[1:10:40] church. It's a real revelation of God.
[1:10:44] Your heart and mind is so filled with
[1:10:47] God's spirit until your thoughts become
[1:10:50] his thoughts. There you are. When your
[1:10:53] mind, somebody say, "My mind,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; my mind,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; my leading,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; my leading,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; my guiding,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; my guiding
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; becomes a direct place or a direct
[1:11:03] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:11:06] moving your mortal being."
[1:11:09] What kind of people should we be?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; If the very Holy Spirit has you so
[1:11:15] embodied or empowered that, brother Joe,
[1:11:18] you don't use your own thoughts, you
[1:11:20] don't use your own mind, you don't use
[1:11:22] your own opinions, but the Holy Spirit
[1:11:25] has you so built into your thoughts and
[1:11:29] your being is God's spirit expressing
[1:11:32] itself through you. What kind of church
[1:11:35] would we be when the human element goes
[1:11:37] out and the spirit of God fills that
[1:11:40] vacancy where you empty yourself? Then
[1:11:42] will be the church in his power of the
[1:11:45] resurrection of Jesus. We will walk in
[1:11:47] his steps. We will walk in his power. We
[1:11:50] will walk in his thoughts. We will walk
[1:11:52] in his being because it's his moving.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Can I bring it on down, brother Jared?
[1:12:01] Then your thoughts will become words.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That's powerful, ain't it? Your thoughts
[1:12:07] will become words. But let's not leave
[1:12:09] it there. And your words will become
[1:12:12] material.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts will become your words and
[1:12:18] your words will become material. I
[1:12:20] believe it's on the road when the church
[1:12:23] will be so wrapped in Christ that the
[1:12:25] Holy Spirit mankind so away from
[1:12:27] theirelves that they don't see
[1:12:29] themselves. They don't see no thought of
[1:12:31] themselves. The only thing they think
[1:12:33] about is serving God. And their thoughts
[1:12:36] just move on.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; They refuse the things of the world.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; They just move in the spirit. They walk
[1:12:46] in the spirit. They live in the spirit.
[1:12:49] So fulfill the law of Christ. Then the
[1:12:51] love of Christ in the human heart moving
[1:12:54] in the Holy Ghost, that great wonderful
[1:12:56] church will go forth with power and
[1:12:59] deity. Are y'all ready for this? Because
[1:13:02] deity will be revealed in human beings
[1:13:06] by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the
[1:13:09] thought of their mind.
[1:13:12] My goodness. That's why the devil's got
[1:13:14] you in a mind battle is cuz he knows if
[1:13:17] you ever lose your mind and get the mind
[1:13:20] of Christ then it'll go from thoughts
[1:13:22] from words into material.
[1:13:26] The devil knows if you ever lose the way
[1:13:28] you see yourself and begin to look at
[1:13:31] yourself the way the word looks at you,
[1:13:33] you will not just be a church member.
[1:13:36] You will be an invincible army. Well, I
[1:13:38] stand tonight as a son of God and I
[1:13:41] renounce the human mind and I say, Lord,
[1:13:44] we receive the mind of Christ. We
[1:13:47] receive
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; we receive the mind of Christ. I tell
[1:13:52] you this tonight, receive the mind of
[1:13:54] Christ about what you're going through
[1:13:55] right now.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Not a crazy man. Come on.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Receive the mind of Christ
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; about what you're going through right
[1:14:06] now and it'll change the way you come
[1:14:08] out of it.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Now that devil's roaming around here,
[1:14:14] Satan, I rebuke you.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I rebuke that devil. I rebuke that
[1:14:20] devil. This is the house of God and the
[1:14:23] human mind is gone out so the spirit of
[1:14:26] God can fill our hearts with the
[1:14:28] thoughts of God. Glory to God. When the
[1:14:32] thoughts begin to become words, you're
[1:14:34] going to see
[1:14:36] you're going to start seeing material.
[1:14:38] You're going to start seeing material.
[1:14:40] Come on. You can't think about it long
[1:14:41] enough and then speak it and it not
[1:14:43] become material.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, Hatty. Right. You've been
[1:14:48] thinking about them boys being saved.
[1:14:50] You've been speaking about them boys
[1:14:51] being saved, but now you're in the
[1:14:53] presence of the mind of Christ. And when
[1:14:56] the human element goes down, the spirit
[1:14:58] of God fills the vacancy.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say away with negativity.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Anybody want to join me? Away with
[1:15:12] negativity. I'm tired of it.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of
[1:15:17] negativity. I'm tired of rousy, rousy,
[1:15:20] poor, pitiful, mentality. I'm ready to
[1:15:23] see the church of the living God rise in
[1:15:26] the power of the authority of the
[1:15:28] revelation of the spoken word. I'm ready
[1:15:31] to see somebody start thinking about the
[1:15:34] power of God and begin to speak the word
[1:15:36] of God and watch the materialization of
[1:15:39] the thoughts become reality.
[1:15:43] Aren't you buddy? Amen. I'm ready to see
[1:15:45] it. Well, can I tell you it's not on its
[1:15:47] road. It's here.
[1:15:51] Negative thoughts
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; produce negative words
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; which produce negative expressions
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; but positive thoughts
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; produce positive words
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and they produce positive expressions
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; see the prophet of God said it's a
[1:16:14] strange thing that it is so much the
[1:16:16] thought of people
[1:16:19] Now, here's what their thought is. And
[1:16:21] brother Mark, because it's their fault,
[1:16:23] they say, "Listen, well, I'm weak
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; and my faith is not very much. And
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not a very good Christian." That's
[1:16:31] just what the devil wants you to say.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You're just talking his language right
[1:16:40] then.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You mustn't never say that.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Don't never let your testimony be
[1:16:47] negative.
[1:16:49] Let it be positive all the time.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Say this. I am saved.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I have God in my heart. I believe him
[1:16:57] with all my heart. And somebody come by
[1:17:00] and say, do you believe in divine
[1:17:01] healing with all of my heart?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Never permit a negative thought to come
[1:17:08] into your mind if you can help it.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stand here and
[1:17:14] dehristianize you because I think you're
[1:17:16] a powerful people.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But sometimes powerful people get
[1:17:20] negative thoughts.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "When it starts, don't
[1:17:26] entertain it."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I can't help the
[1:17:29] thoughts from coming." Well, that'll be
[1:17:31] like the farmer that said he couldn't
[1:17:32] stop the birds from flying over his
[1:17:35] place, but he could sure stop them from
[1:17:37] roosting. So, that's a good thing. You
[1:17:40] see, you cannot help the thoughts when
[1:17:42] they come, but don't entertain them.
[1:17:45] Just pass it on. No sir. You want to
[1:17:48] hear a prophet? No sir. Jesus Christ is
[1:17:51] my savior. All things are mine by God
[1:17:54] and I'm going to keep them and I'm going
[1:17:56] to testify of them. And God can only
[1:17:59] bless you as you confess he has done it
[1:18:02] for you.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see? He's the high priest of your
[1:18:07] confession.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said that he's the
[1:18:10] high priest of your confession. He can
[1:18:12] only do it for us as we accept it.
[1:18:16] We believe it and confess it. That's why
[1:18:19] David said, "Let the words of my mouth
[1:18:21] and the meditation of my heart be
[1:18:24] acceptable in his sight." Do you know
[1:18:26] when you go to thinking about God is
[1:18:27] when he appears.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know that when you go to thinking
[1:18:31] about God, he appears? Now, I got a
[1:18:34] question for you. Okay? If you can think
[1:18:36] about him and your thoughts can be so
[1:18:38] powerful, he can appear, what would
[1:18:41] happen if you started speaking about
[1:18:42] him?
[1:18:47] Hallelujah.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Can I show you something? Even in a
[1:18:53] negative condition, you can still think
[1:18:54] about him and bring him on the scene.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're getting way
[1:19:00] out there." No, I'm not. Brother Peter,
[1:19:01] in Luke 24, the Bible says there were
[1:19:03] two and they were walking the Emmas
[1:19:05] road. Brother said Jesus appeared
[1:19:08] because they were thinking about him.
[1:19:11] But they were thinking he was dead and
[1:19:13] he was in a grave and he was gone
[1:19:15] forever. He said and while they were
[1:19:17] walking Jesus stepped out and he
[1:19:20] appeared before them and he said why do
[1:19:23] you think like this? I love what a
[1:19:25] prophet said. He said look what he said.
[1:19:27] He said why are you so sorrowful this
[1:19:29] morning? Brother said Jesus looked at
[1:19:31] him and said my you look terrible.
[1:19:35] Look what a frown is on your face. You
[1:19:39] being Jews. Why do you look like that?
[1:19:42] Why aren't you smiling? He said, "You're
[1:19:44] a stranger here." He said, "No." Now,
[1:19:46] look here. Reb said he was not a
[1:19:48] stranger. He was the divine person.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, they didn't believe that. So, they
[1:19:55] were just going down the road
[1:19:56] discouraged. And if you notice, it's
[1:19:59] when you're discouraged.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's when the devil can
[1:20:04] really pour it on you.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; brother. Brother, brother,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; when you're discouraged, Brother Tim,
[1:20:12] that's when the devil can can really
[1:20:14] pour it on you.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; See, that's when he gets you and you
[1:20:19] come to church and say, "Well, I don't
[1:20:21] know. I don't know whether I'll get any
[1:20:23] better or not. I've been prayed for
[1:20:25] twice. Oh my, you might as well go home.
[1:20:28] That's all." But when you can cast that
[1:20:30] aside, Come on.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; God don't want you to be frowning.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. We got a pump handle
[1:20:40] handshake. We're going to get a Holy
[1:20:41] Ghost smile.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; See, right now's the time to cast that
[1:20:47] devil off.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Right now is the time to turn that frown
[1:20:50] into a smile. You say, "Preacher, you
[1:20:52] don't know how bad it is. How much worse
[1:20:54] could it be than them walking down the
[1:20:56] street thinking the Lord was dead?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; But then he stepped out and revealed
[1:21:02] himself to him. Oh, I say tonight that
[1:21:04] devil may convince you your situation's
[1:21:06] hopeless. You're finished. This is your
[1:21:08] end. But I want to bind that devil
[1:21:10] tonight and say the divine person of the
[1:21:13] word of God has stepped into Grace
[1:21:15] Tabernacle tonight. And he's here. He's
[1:21:18] here in power. He's here in authority.
[1:21:21] He's here to take that frown and turn it
[1:21:23] into a Holy Ghost smile.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; God don't want you frowning.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm deep. No, you're depressed.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; We've made frown and spiritual
[1:21:52] God wants you to be happy.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; The human heart was made to be happy.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Worry will cause cancer.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Temper will cause cancer. Don't never be
[1:22:04] upset.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; just walk in his love knowing that
[1:22:12] you're walking in him and nothing can
[1:22:15] harm you. There's neither powers, things
[1:22:18] present, things future that can separate
[1:22:21] us from him. We're in him and we never
[1:22:25] come in by our own will. That's right.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; He by choice elected us and brought us
[1:22:33] into him. So it's Oh, God. So it's his
[1:22:37] business to take care of what he took
[1:22:40] himself into.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you're in the church,
[1:22:45] then the church is going to keep you up.
[1:22:47] If you're in the church, the church is
[1:22:49] going to keep you going. But if you ever
[1:22:51] get into Christ, if you ever get into
[1:22:53] Christ, it don't matter if nobody shows
[1:22:56] up. As long as Christ shows up, you can
[1:22:59] shout hallelujah. As long as Christ
[1:23:01] shows up, you can sing and praise and
[1:23:04] worship God because you're not in the
[1:23:06] church. You're in Christ.
[1:23:11] Hallelujah.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe that's a secret
[1:23:16] of it. He said is the preparation of the
[1:23:19] human heart. Now, I want to say
[1:23:21] something to you. There's got to be a
[1:23:23] change in your heart.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; A change of the heart, not of this
[1:23:29] physical thing,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; but the heart of your soul.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And in there,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; something anchors.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:42] that till your thoughts become dull.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Your habits, your being has changed from
[1:23:51] a sinner to a Christian.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You're expressing Christ. Now, can I can
[1:23:56] I just say something to you?
[1:23:59] Christianity's got to come from the
[1:24:00] heart.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to come from the feet.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Morgan, I preached many
[1:24:07] sermons. I didn't feel like dancing.
[1:24:12] Dear God,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest with you.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I've got I I've preached sermons. I
[1:24:21] didn't feel like shouting and running
[1:24:23] all over the place.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I did it.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Andrew, bless
[1:24:28] God. You just got in the flesh and
[1:24:30] worked yourself up." No. I surrendered
[1:24:32] myself.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I surrendered myself to the one who
[1:24:35] chose me to go to battle against those
[1:24:38] spirits. and I become a weapon in the
[1:24:40] hands of God. I don't control my
[1:24:42] thoughts.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; You all don't know the times I've got in
[1:24:47] my car and said, "I'm going to go to
[1:24:49] church and I'm going to preach a sermon
[1:24:50] and I'm not going to be up there, but
[1:24:52] just a few minutes I'm not going to
[1:24:53] sweat. I'm not going to run. I get so
[1:24:55] tired of being made fun of or those
[1:24:57] things." But in just a few minutes, I
[1:24:58] forget all that because I'm not
[1:25:01] controlled by myself. I'm controlled by
[1:25:04] the one who called me into himself.
[1:25:07] Well, if that's for the preacher, it's
[1:25:09] for the church, too. You say, "Well, I'm
[1:25:11] going to go down the church house. I
[1:25:13] ain't going to raise my hands. I ain't
[1:25:15] going to clap my hands. I'm just going
[1:25:17] to sit there." Amen. But just a few
[1:25:19] minutes, Brother David, and the songs
[1:25:21] get to singing and the Holy Ghost gets
[1:25:23] to moving and something takes over and
[1:25:26] you begin to raise your hands and you
[1:25:28] begin to shout, "Hallelujah!" You know
[1:25:30] what's happening? You're a soldier.
[1:25:32] You're a chosen soldier and the captain
[1:25:35] is controlling you.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; This is not a natural battle.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual battle.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Now remember, it's not Christian
[1:25:48] science.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Direct quote.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; It's not mind over matter.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; The mind accepts the life which is the
[1:26:02] word of God and there brings the life.
[1:26:05] Just your thoughts doesn't do it.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But the word of God
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; brought in the channel of your thought.
[1:26:15] It's not the thought as Christian
[1:26:17] science makes it mind over matter, but
[1:26:20] your mind accepts it
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; and it grasps it.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; brother Cody. Your mind accepts it.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And it grasps it.
[1:26:33] What is your mind controlled by? Your
[1:26:36] spirit.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And your spirit catches the word of God.
[1:26:43] And that's the thing that's got life in
[1:26:45] it.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory. Your feelings ain't got no
[1:26:49] life in it. Your emotions ain't got no
[1:26:52] life in it. But the word has got eternal
[1:26:54] life in it. And if your spirit can grasp
[1:26:57] it,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it brings life in you. Oh
[1:27:02] brother, when that takes place, when
[1:27:04] life comes down in that channel into
[1:27:06] you, the word of God is manifested in
[1:27:09] you,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; devil get out of their way.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. When the word catches you,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; when you get a hold of the word,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; when you grasp it,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; let me say this. We fight the good fight
[1:27:27] of faith
[1:27:29] by holding fast our profession. Look
[1:27:32] what Timothy says. Fight the good fight
[1:27:35] of faith. Lay hold
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; on eternal life.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Where unto thou art also called and hast
[1:27:42] professed a good profession before many
[1:27:46] witnesses.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna just just punch that devil
[1:27:50] square in the face.
[1:27:53] But brother Caleb, sometimes we say it's
[1:27:56] too hard to hold my profession.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "I give thee charge in
[1:28:03] the sight of God, who quickenth all
[1:28:05] things, and before Christ Jesus,
[1:28:10] who before Pontious Pilate
[1:28:13] witnessed a good confession."
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; brother Emanuel. He's standing before
[1:28:21] the man that's getting ready to sentence
[1:28:22] him to death.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And he's done nothing wrong.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; It's the darkest trial of his life.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And brother Carter, all he's got to do
[1:28:34] is recant. I'm not the king of the Jews.
[1:28:37] I'm not the son of God. I'm not I'm not
[1:28:40] I'm not who they say I am. And Pilot let
[1:28:43] him go. But even in the face of Pontius
[1:28:46] Pilate, he held Oh, God. He held his
[1:28:51] confession.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Quit giving up your
[1:28:55] confession in the face of depression.
[1:28:58] Quit giving up your profession in the
[1:29:00] face of every negative thought that
[1:29:02] comes by your way. Hold your profession
[1:29:04] in the face of your enemy and say,
[1:29:06] "Devil, pour on as much as you want, but
[1:29:09] you will not shake me. I know who I am.
[1:29:12] I know where I come from."
[1:29:17] They overcame him by the blood of the
[1:29:20] lamb.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; And by the word
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; of their testimony.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; No, they open their mouth.
[1:29:46] See, the prodigal God said, "God made
[1:29:48] the promise. Let's stay with it."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You got to have a battle.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; If everything comes lazy, well, what are
[1:29:57] you overcoming?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; They overcome by the word of God and
[1:30:02] their testimony, the blood of Christ.
[1:30:06] You've got to overcome something.
[1:30:09] You've got to have some obstacles and
[1:30:12] people that different and fuss with you
[1:30:14] and tell you you're holy rollers and
[1:30:16] things that's put before you. It's a
[1:30:19] trial.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; The things people say about you is
[1:30:24] equivalent to Pontius Pilate and Jesus
[1:30:27] standing in front of him. It's a trial.
[1:30:30] If you haven't got that, then you're not
[1:30:32] even in the battle. What did you join
[1:30:34] the army and get the training for? To
[1:30:37] lay around.
[1:30:39] to strut up and down the streets and
[1:30:41] show off. That's the way some Christians
[1:30:43] act. That's the way they want to be
[1:30:45] looked up to. You're not going to be
[1:30:47] looked up to. You're going to be looked
[1:30:50] down on.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be looked up to.
[1:30:55] You're going to be looked down on. For
[1:30:57] all that live and godly in Christ Jesus
[1:31:00] shall suffer persecutions.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, Brother Bam said, "Come
[1:31:05] over here, and let's have a little pity
[1:31:08] party, and let's tell you, you're going
[1:31:10] to let's just tell you, you're going to
[1:31:11] be looked down upon, and ain't nobody
[1:31:14] going to look up to you, and it's poor
[1:31:16] pitiful man. It's always going to be
[1:31:17] hard, Peter. It's awesome. And nobody's
[1:31:20] going to be times nobody wants to and
[1:31:22] you just going and
[1:31:24] s
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He said, "Pick up
[1:31:28] your sword
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; and cut free everything and keep going
[1:31:33] on.
[1:31:36] Come on, Grace Tabernacle. We just come
[1:31:38] out of a powerful youth camp, but this
[1:31:40] ain't the time to lay down. The devil's
[1:31:43] already in front of you. The devil's
[1:31:45] already pushing you, but it's time to
[1:31:47] pick up your sword and fight back
[1:31:49] against that devil and overcome him by
[1:31:52] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:31:55] your testimony.
[1:31:57] God did something for me.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; God, give me the Holy Ghost. God, give
[1:32:02] me a victory. God gave me a
[1:32:04] breakthrough.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; If you're going to battle, you better
[1:32:09] have a weapon.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; If you're going Oh, I'm doing good on
[1:32:15] time. If you're going to battle, you
[1:32:16] better have a weapon.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He gives his children the best.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's his word.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He equips his army with the best.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Can I go on? Yes, sir.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And the latest.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You got the best. And you got the latest
[1:32:42] weapon.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; He said he give us the best. That's his
[1:32:46] word. The best can be given. God gives
[1:32:49] his people the very best.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what Paul said? He said,
[1:32:53] "We walk in the flesh."
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But we do not war after the flesh.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He said, "The
[1:33:01] weapons of our warfare,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; they're not carnal,
[1:33:06] but they're mighty through God
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; to the pulling down of strongholds."
[1:33:12] Can I go on?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Casting down imaginations.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And every high thing that exalteth
[1:33:21] itself against
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; the knowledge of God,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; and bringing into captivity every
[1:33:28] thought to the obedience of Christ. He
[1:33:31] said, "Now the Bible said we've got to
[1:33:34] cast down reasonings." Amen.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Then when your soul says,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; "Jesus is my healer. I now believe it
[1:33:42] and accept it," then reasonings move out
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; and your soul comes in first place. And
[1:33:49] whatever God says, it won't reason at
[1:33:52] all. It'll take God at his word.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody say this with me. The most
[1:33:59] powerful weapon,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; the most powerful weapon
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; that God put in the hand of a man
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; is a committ
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and a confession.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; You're armed
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and dangerous.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; You're armed
[1:34:24] and dangerous.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. You may be carrying a 45 around
[1:34:28] on your side or a 9mm, but you're still
[1:34:30] more powerful.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; If you got a confession from the word of
[1:34:35] God and you're under the blood of Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ,
[1:34:39] it'll do it every time if you'll believe
[1:34:42] it, accept it, and confess it and just
[1:34:45] keep confessing it.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; There it is. Don't just believe it and
[1:34:49] accept it at youth camp and confess it
[1:34:51] in the prayer line. Keep on confessing
[1:34:53] it. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed.
[1:34:57] I'm healed. I'm saved. I'm saved. I'm
[1:35:00] delivered.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; You're not going to fight the devil from
[1:35:05] your mind.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You're going to fight him from your
[1:35:09] soul. You know what Paul said? He said,
[1:35:11] "The word is nigh thee.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; It is even in thy mouth
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; and in thy heart.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That is the word of faith which we
[1:35:20] preach." Yes, sir.
[1:35:23] Come on.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; If thou shalt confess,
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; somebody say confess
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; and shall believe in thy heart that God
[1:35:36] raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
[1:35:39] saved.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Y'all ready for that confess?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Ready for that Greek word confess?
[1:35:48] Put a frown on your face.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and drop your head real low.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Give thanks.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Say the same thing as another. Agree
[1:36:01] with
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; To admit or declare oneself guilty.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Of what one is accused of.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Well, you're just a holy roller. Sure
[1:36:23] am.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; That's what you want to call me. That's
[1:36:26] what I Well, you're just listening to
[1:36:28] too many tapes. Sure am.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Well, you just got your head in the
[1:36:32] message. No, it's in the inner veil.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Well, well, well, you're just a man
[1:36:37] follower. Well, if that's what you want
[1:36:38] to think about me, go ahead and f Well,
[1:36:40] let me tell you this. You won't
[1:36:41] intimidate me
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; and you won't back me off of my
[1:36:44] confession because the minute I give up
[1:36:47] my confession is the minute that spirit
[1:36:49] disarms me. But I refuse to become a
[1:36:52] defenseless Christian. I refuse to
[1:36:55] become a defenseless a defenseless
[1:36:58] soldier. I got a weapon. I got a
[1:37:00] confession. I got a testimony. I'm
[1:37:03] underneath the blood. Jesus saved my
[1:37:06] soul. He filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:08] And one of these mornings between 6:00
[1:37:10] and 9, I'm going to change my body.
[1:37:14] Yes, sir. I'm going to confess it until
[1:37:17] every devil dies. I'm going to confess
[1:37:20] it until my body obeys my confession.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're just getting out
[1:37:29] there. Am I Am I?"
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; It's the six sense,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; brother said. It's the most powerful
[1:37:38] force
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; that ever hit the earth.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Is that super sense?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Are you okay?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's called the sixth sense.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with this down
[1:37:56] here.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; If this down here declares it and says
[1:38:02] amen to it,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; all right, you're moving on.
[1:38:07] There's where the power is sir.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; If you believe
[1:38:12] in your heart.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Now folks, I about shouted
[1:38:19] my little office all to pieces today.
[1:38:24] Your fifth sense
[1:38:27] of thinking lays within your brain,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; but the sixth sense lays in your heart.
[1:38:37] You believe with your heart.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Confession is made by the mouth.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; So from the heart, the mouth confesses.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; You believe with your heart the six
[1:38:50] sense. That's the powerful force.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Do you all know in Revelation 1, there's
[1:38:55] a patmas vision. Do you know there's a
[1:38:58] sevenfold revealing of the personage of
[1:39:01] Jesus Christ?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; That's where I about shouted it down.
[1:39:04] Brother Mark, John describes that
[1:39:06] sevenfold personage and he comes down to
[1:39:09] the sixth one.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what he says? He says, "Out
[1:39:15] of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:39:18] sword."
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Are you awake?
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Sorry. I'm like a little kid at Disney
[1:39:28] World. Are you awake? The sixth sense is
[1:39:32] in your heart. And the sixth revealing
[1:39:35] of the son of man is a sharp two-edged
[1:39:37] sword that goes out of your mouth. Oh,
[1:39:40] Grace tabernacle. No wonder the devil
[1:39:42] can't bind you. You got the six sense in
[1:39:45] your heart and you got the six revealing
[1:39:47] of Christ in your mouth. It's a sharp
[1:39:50] two-edged sword.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; The word of God went forth from the
[1:39:57] church's mouth. He said, "Now see, hold
[1:40:00] fast. Look here. Look here. Say
[1:40:03] something loyal. That's how you kill
[1:40:05] devils."
[1:40:08] Glory to God. Revelation 10:8. And the
[1:40:11] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[1:40:13] unto me again. And said, "Go and take
[1:40:15] the little book which is open in the
[1:40:19] hand of the angel, which standeth upon
[1:40:21] the sea and upon the earth." And I went
[1:40:24] unto the angel, and I said unto him,
[1:40:26] "Give me the little book." And he said
[1:40:28] unto me, "Take it and eat it up, and it
[1:40:32] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[1:40:36] shall be in thy mouth
[1:40:38] sweet as honey."
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; The words are like a honeycomb.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; They're sweet
[1:40:48] and they're strength to the bones.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Can I tell y'all something tonight? Will
[1:40:55] you Will you believe me? You're going to
[1:40:57] confess your way out of some situations.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're going to have to
[1:41:05] confess your way out of situations.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, if we could just get the
[1:41:10] right preacher here and just get the
[1:41:11] right meeting and get the right service
[1:41:13] and the right atmosphere and
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; sometimes you're going to have to open
[1:41:18] your mouth
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and begin to confess your way out of
[1:41:22] that situation. Look here. And I took
[1:41:24] the little book out of the angel's hand
[1:41:25] and ate it up. And it was in my mouth
[1:41:27] sweet as honey. But as soon as I eat it,
[1:41:30] my belly was bitter. And he said unto
[1:41:32] me, "Go fill up a pew." Memorize some
[1:41:35] quotes.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Go to church when you can find time.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; He said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:41:43] again
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; before many peoples, many nations, and
[1:41:47] tongues and kings." You know what that
[1:41:48] word prophesy means? It means to declare
[1:41:51] a thing which can only be known by
[1:41:54] divine revelation. You know what the
[1:41:56] prophet God said? He said, "We had him
[1:41:58] coming last night with this great sword
[1:41:59] to kill and the four seal. We found out
[1:42:01] that that it gets killed with a sword,
[1:42:03] too. The sword of the word of God." He
[1:42:05] said, "Now wait till them seven thunders
[1:42:07] utter their voices to get that group who
[1:42:09] really can take the word of God and hand
[1:42:11] it there. It'll slice and cut. They can
[1:42:13] close the heavens. They can shut this or
[1:42:15] do that, whatever they want to. Glory.
[1:42:17] He will be slayed by the word that
[1:42:21] proceeds from his mouth.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; It's sharper than a two-edged sword.
[1:42:27] They could call for a 100red billion
[1:42:29] tons of flies if they wanted to.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Whatever they say
[1:42:35] is going to happen because it's the word
[1:42:38] of God coming from the mouth of God.
[1:42:41] Listen, the word has never failed in the
[1:42:44] mouths of believing Christians.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] And in this last age,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; it's here stronger.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And greater than ever.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't get mad at me, but the
[1:43:08] word is here greater. It's here stronger
[1:43:11] tonight in the mouth of the true word
[1:43:14] bride than it was in Hadty Wright.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hadty Wright and Banks Woods
[1:43:20] had their day, but this is your day.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; This is your turn. The true word will
[1:43:26] return to the bride. Listen, the true
[1:43:28] word is here and it's nigh thee. It's in
[1:43:32] thy heart. Then put it in thy mouth and
[1:43:34] begin to speak it until giants fall.
[1:43:40] Come on. I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[1:43:41] just going to preach right here and
[1:43:42] we'll just go home. Amen. I'm going to
[1:43:44] say this to you. You don't need
[1:43:45] squirrels tonight.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; No. No. You don't need squirrels. Come
[1:43:51] on, brothers. We've sat in tree stands
[1:43:53] and tried to speak storms out of
[1:43:54] existence. We don't need storms out of
[1:43:56] existence tonight.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; You know what we need? We need a
[1:44:01] positive confessional
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; to take a hold in the soul of the bride.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:09] Well, I'm the bride. I'm the bride.
[1:44:12] You're the bride. You're the bride.
[1:44:14] You're the bride. Brother Matt says
[1:44:15] you're the bride. Brother says, "You're
[1:44:17] the bride." Brother Joe says, "You're
[1:44:18] the bride." Every preacher you hear,
[1:44:19] you're the bride. You're the bride.
[1:44:21] You're the bride.
[1:44:23] Well, they said I'm the bride. Well,
[1:44:25] they said I'm the bride.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, Rebecca.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, Rebecca.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet Eleazar on your own
[1:44:35] profession.
[1:44:37] Come on, Rebecca. If you're going to
[1:44:39] leave this whale and go meet me that
[1:44:42] promised one, you're going to have to
[1:44:44] open your mouth.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:44:47] Rebecca, which was to be the mother of
[1:44:48] this noted promised weighted son, when
[1:44:50] she was called to the final test of a
[1:44:53] strange man she had never seen before,
[1:44:56] only she seen the working of the Holy
[1:44:59] Spirit. when her parents could not fully
[1:45:02] decide.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; When her parents could not fully decide
[1:45:08] whether she was going to go with this
[1:45:10] stranger or not to be the wife of the
[1:45:13] man she had never seen, she was brought
[1:45:16] to the final test.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; How many can say, "Thank God for praying
[1:45:21] parents."
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God for praying parents. Can I
[1:45:25] tell you something? That's not enough.
[1:45:28] Thank God for praying parents, but
[1:45:31] that's not enough to put you in the
[1:45:33] rapture. The prophet of God said, "When
[1:45:35] it come to final test, we'll get the
[1:45:38] damsel and let her speak."
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Glory. Give me some dancing room. We'll
[1:45:46] get the damsel and we'll let her speak.
[1:45:49] You know, as she come out there, they
[1:45:51] said, "We'll hear from her mouth whether
[1:45:53] she will go, yes or no." He said,
[1:45:56] "That's the way it's brought to all the
[1:45:57] seed of God." It's got to be your mouth.
[1:46:00] God wants to hear from you.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Rebecca, do you want to go? Oh,
[1:46:06] Rebecca's going to go. My daughter
[1:46:08] Rebecca's going to go. My daughter
[1:46:09] Rebecca's going to go. It wasn't enough
[1:46:12] for her mama to say it.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I'm closing right here, Brother Joe. It
[1:46:16] wasn't enough for her daddy to say it.
[1:46:19] She had to say it.
[1:46:21] I'm going. I'm going. Are you going with
[1:46:25] Eleazar? I'm going with Eleazar.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah. You know what happened? Her
[1:46:32] voice become her confession and it
[1:46:34] become an anchor. It become a divine
[1:46:36] absolute oh grace tabernacle. I got a
[1:46:39] question for you. Are you going in the
[1:46:41] rapture?
[1:46:43] Is your name in the lamb's book of life?
[1:46:46] Are you the sinless, spotless bride of
[1:46:48] the Lord Jesus Christ? Is Christ the
[1:46:51] healer? Is Christ the redeemer? Is
[1:46:54] Christ the Holy Ghost giver? Does Christ
[1:46:57] bring prodals home? I say yes. I say
[1:47:01] yes. I say yes. I'm going to open my
[1:47:04] mouth. I'm going to overcome that devil
[1:47:07] by saying yes.
[1:47:09] Stand on your feet and say yes.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you going all the way?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going all the way?
[1:47:21] Are you going to take a rapture?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Are you going to sit down and quit? No.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; I'll go.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I'll go.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; See, when Revelation
[1:47:40] finds its bedding ground, come on,
[1:47:42] musicians. When Revelation finds its
[1:47:44] betting ground,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; circumstances Come on.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; are no longer considered.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; When the word finds
[1:48:00] its bedding ground,
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; That's it,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; brother. Sister
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; circumstances.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Is no longer considered.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible says? The Bible
[1:48:13] says Abraham considered not the deadness
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; of Sarah's womb.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Neither did he consider
[1:48:20] the deadness of his own life. You know
[1:48:22] what he did? He considered the promise
[1:48:24] of God.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Now, see, you got to have something to
[1:48:28] consider.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And you you you know why the devil you
[1:48:33] know why the devil points out
[1:48:34] circumstances?
[1:48:36] It's because he wants you to consider
[1:48:38] the circumstances.
[1:48:40] Because when you begin to consider the
[1:48:42] circumstances and you begin to focus on
[1:48:44] them and you begin to look at them and
[1:48:46] you begin to read about them and you
[1:48:47] begin to you begin to feed on them, then
[1:48:49] before long those circumstances form
[1:48:51] your profession.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; But can I say to you tonight what Paul
[1:48:56] said? He said, "Let us consider,"
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; brother David, he said, "Let us consider
[1:49:02] the high priest."
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Don't consider the circumstances,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; brother Joel. consider the high priest.
[1:49:12] You say, "Brother Andrew, I don't I
[1:49:13] don't know. I I don't know. I don't know
[1:49:15] where to go. I don't know how to handle
[1:49:16] this. I don't know how to get out of
[1:49:17] this situation. I don't know if I'll
[1:49:19] ever get over this stronghold. I don't
[1:49:21] know if I'll ever get out of this out of
[1:49:22] this sickness. I don't know." Well,
[1:49:25] first thing I want to ask you is, what
[1:49:27] are you considering?
[1:49:31] Because what you're considering is
[1:49:32] shaping your confession.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:36] But how many tonight like to raise your
[1:49:37] hand and say, "Lord, I want to consider
[1:49:39] the high priest."
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I want to consider the high priest.
[1:49:48] Oh my.
[1:49:50] I thought I I thought I'd get done
[1:49:53] tonight.
[1:49:55] I want to consider the high priest.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; What does he have to say?
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; What What What does he say about my
[1:50:03] future?
[1:50:06] Abraham said, "What you confess you are,
[1:50:08] that's what you're going to be."
[1:50:11] He said, "Any man will never live any
[1:50:13] further or any higher than what he's
[1:50:15] believing he's living." He said, "You
[1:50:18] take a man that talks about drinking all
[1:50:20] the time, he talks about drinking, he
[1:50:21] thinks about drinking, he drops right
[1:50:24] down in that category and becomes a
[1:50:26] drunkard." That's right.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you see a man always
[1:50:29] thinking about vulgar things, looking at
[1:50:31] vulgar things, thinking of vulgar
[1:50:32] things, reading vulgarity?" He drops
[1:50:35] right down in that category.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your body obeys your
[1:50:39] confession."
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Now, we thought we talk about that a
[1:50:42] lot, Brother David, in the positive, but
[1:50:44] it also happens in the negative.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look here." He said, 'Now if
[1:50:48] you, he said, uh, right here, he said,
[1:50:51] 'Let the saintliest person in this
[1:50:53] building right now,
[1:50:56] just make up your mind you're not a
[1:50:59] Christian anymore. That's when you
[1:51:01] become not a Christian.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Your body obeys your confession. He
[1:51:08] said, "But see right now, he's not the
[1:51:11] high priest of your feelings. He's the
[1:51:14] high priest of your confession." Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you see? Then right now
[1:51:18] cast away the thought of sickness. Take
[1:51:21] God's healing thought. Let them become
[1:51:24] your thoughts. Think upon these things."
[1:51:27] The Bible said, "If there be any praise,
[1:51:29] if there be any virtue, here's what."
[1:51:30] Now, now, how many will say, "Lord, I'll
[1:51:32] take this confession."
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; How many will take it? He said, "Now,
[1:51:36] here's what you say. I believe in thee.
[1:51:39] I accept thee as my savior, my only
[1:51:41] salvation. I need your strength for my
[1:51:44] health. I cannot go forward without you.
[1:51:47] I now accept you as my healer. I
[1:51:50] renounce the devil and all of his works.
[1:51:53] From this time henceforth, I will think
[1:51:55] positive. I will believe every promise.
[1:51:59] The scripture says, I by his stripes I
[1:52:02] am healed. I now accept it. I believe
[1:52:05] it. It is mine. I thank you, Lord. And I
[1:52:08] will continue testifying of my healing
[1:52:11] until I am perfectly well.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Testifying is not lying.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It's confessing.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; It's confessing. Listen tonight, I say
[1:52:29] this to you. Hold fast your profession.
[1:52:32] Brother said, just take a hold of the
[1:52:33] promise and be satisfied. He said, 'Now,
[1:52:36] that's the way every believer, no matter
[1:52:38] how bad the cancer's got you, how long
[1:52:40] you've been sitting in that wheelchair,
[1:52:42] any of those things, just if you can
[1:52:44] grasp that revelation from God, then be
[1:52:47] satisfied knowing it's going to happen
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; because faith waits patiently
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; for the promise.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, I could tell you tonight about
[1:52:57] Moses. I could tell you tonight about I
[1:53:00] could tell you tonight about John the
[1:53:02] Baptist. I could tell you about Paul. I
[1:53:04] could tell you about Allah. I could tell
[1:53:06] you about Upshaw. Maybe sometime I'll
[1:53:08] preach it to you. I could tell you about
[1:53:10] John Ryan,
[1:53:13] but what about today?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; What about What about warriors in the
[1:53:18] battle today?
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; What about you sitting on those pews
[1:53:21] right now?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; What about your confession?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say, "Lord, fill my mouth.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Fill my mouth with positive things."
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:35] talked to our brother, brother Ron
[1:53:37] Spitzer today and I couldn't help but
[1:53:38] ask him. I said, "Brother Ron, in this
[1:53:40] battle of cancer," I said, "Your
[1:53:42] confession, you know how many times that
[1:53:44] man in five years has taken a pullpit
[1:53:47] with stage four cancer and stood there
[1:53:49] and said, "God's greater than cancer."
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Cancer in his body, but a confession in
[1:53:57] his soul.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; God is greater than cancer. Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Andrew, I wish I had a
[1:54:05] pull pit tonight. I I wish I had a
[1:54:07] microphone tonight. I' i'd like You
[1:54:09] realize right here, you standing in
[1:54:10] those pews tonight, raising your hands,
[1:54:12] you're confessing to the devil."
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Devil. Some of y'all, Brother Brother
[1:54:16] Phil sitting back there with his hand
[1:54:17] wrapped up. Amen. He's standing right
[1:54:19] there confessing God is a healer.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; He ain't had he ain't held a microphone
[1:54:24] tonight. He ain't preached a sermon
[1:54:26] tonight. But there stands an end time
[1:54:27] warrior in the house of God testifying
[1:54:30] and confessing.
[1:54:32] He could be at home tonight,
[1:54:35] but he's right here in this building.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sister Sophie.
[1:54:40] Right there. Amen. Sick in her body, but

[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm telling you tonight, you're
[1:54:51] overcomers.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Hold fast your professional, sir,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; and overcome. Let's bow our hearts
[1:54:56] tonight.
[1:54:58] Hold fast.
[1:55:00] Hold fast means to master. It means to
[1:55:03] control. I wonder tonight how many say,
[1:55:06] "Lord, wash me tonight with the pure
[1:55:09] water of your word.
[1:55:11] Lord, wash me of the negativity.
[1:55:14] Lord, I'm tired of it. Lord, I'm tired
[1:55:17] of negativity. I'm tired of negative
[1:55:19] thoughts.
[1:55:21] I'm tired of negative words. I'm tired
[1:55:23] of negative expressions.
[1:55:26] Lord, I'm tired of I'm tired of it. I'm
[1:55:29] ready for the positive gospel. Brother
[1:55:32] said, "There's no negativity at all in
[1:55:33] Christianity.
[1:55:35] There's a positive token. This is a
[1:55:38] positive gospel. This is a positive
[1:55:40] message." I say to you tonight,
[1:55:44] let the Holy Spirit come by right now
[1:55:46] and let him wash away all the
[1:55:48] negativity.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; How many say tonight, Lord, give me a
[1:55:51] new language.
[1:55:53] Lord, give me a new vocabulary.
[1:55:56] Lord, as how I wonder how many parents
[1:55:58] in this building could say, Lord, give
[1:56:00] me the words of life to speak over my
[1:56:03] children.
[1:56:04] Let me speak over my children the words
[1:56:06] of life that'll that'll that'll change
[1:56:08] their destinies.
[1:56:10] Lord, I I wonder how many how many would
[1:56:12] say tonight, Lord, let me let me begin
[1:56:14] to speak out healing over sick bodies.
[1:56:17] Lord, Lord, give me that word fitly
[1:56:19] spoken. I don't know tonight. But I
[1:56:22] wonder how many say, "Lord, as a member
[1:56:23] of this church, I I want to become a
[1:56:25] channel of encouragement.
[1:56:27] I want my mouth and my voice to become a
[1:56:29] channel of encouragement in the house of
[1:56:31] God. I don't want to have a negative
[1:56:33] word. I don't want to have a negative
[1:56:35] thought. I want to have a positive word
[1:56:37] about my brother. I want to have a
[1:56:39] positive word about my sister. I want to
[1:56:41] have a positive word about the service.
[1:56:44] I want to have a positive word about the
[1:56:45] sermon. I want to have a positive word
[1:56:48] about my about my healing, Lord.
[1:56:52] Almighty God, you're in this building
[1:56:53] tonight. Lord, these faithful believers,
[1:56:56] these faithful soldiers have shown up
[1:56:58] tonight to the house of God. Lord, I
[1:57:01] know some of them have come from great
[1:57:03] distances to be here tonight. Lord, I
[1:57:06] know some have pushed through every
[1:57:07] every demon, every spirit of hell today
[1:57:09] to block them from coming to the house
[1:57:11] of God. But Lord, they're here in this
[1:57:13] building tonight to let the devil know
[1:57:16] whose side they're on. Now Lord, as we
[1:57:18] have spoke your word tonight, I know
[1:57:21] these things are simple. Lord, I know
[1:57:23] these things have been no doubt spoken
[1:57:24] over their hearts and over their lives
[1:57:26] and over their minds many, many times,
[1:57:28] Lord Jesus. Father, many of them have
[1:57:31] heard these things since they were
[1:57:32] little children raised in this message.
[1:57:34] But Lord, just over the last little bit,
[1:57:36] you've just been dealing with my heart
[1:57:38] so heavy and so strong.
[1:57:40] Lord, as we were just there ministering
[1:57:42] in the youth camp last weekend, Lord,
[1:57:43] and Father, it just becomes so real to
[1:57:46] my heart.
[1:57:48] Lord, we'll you'll fill our mouth with
[1:57:50] the word of faith. And by the confession
[1:57:53] of our faith, it will bring to pass the
[1:57:56] desires of our heart. And Lord, I know
[1:57:59] there's many believers here tonight in
[1:58:01] this building. And Lord, they're
[1:58:02] desiring things from you. They're
[1:58:04] desiring healings and miracles. And
[1:58:07] Lord, they're desiring and needing
[1:58:08] answers. Dear God, but Father, we're not
[1:58:11] looking tonight at the problems. Lord,
[1:58:14] we're going to be Abrahams and not
[1:58:15] consider the circumstances.
[1:58:18] Father, I think of Rebecca. Lord, when
[1:58:20] Eleazar come to her, Lord, she didn't
[1:58:23] consider the circumstances.
[1:58:25] She was going to a strange place. She
[1:58:28] was leaving with a strange man to go
[1:58:30] meet another strange man that she had
[1:58:32] never seen before. But Lord, she had to
[1:58:36] confess it. Lord, Father, Rebecca's
[1:58:39] confession brought her body under under
[1:58:41] subjection.
[1:58:43] And Lord, I believe there's a bride here
[1:58:45] in these last days. I believe there's a
[1:58:48] portion of that bride, a powerful
[1:58:49] portion of that bride standing before me
[1:58:52] tonight. And Lord, I believe the devil
[1:58:54] knows if they really get a hold of these
[1:58:56] things we're speaking, Lord, if they
[1:58:58] really move out of the realm of
[1:59:00] negativity and they move out of the
[1:59:02] realm of being conscious of criticisms
[1:59:04] and circumstances and all those things,
[1:59:08] Lord. And Father, they climb up into
[1:59:10] that dimension of positivity.
[1:59:12] Lord, the devil knows he can't do
[1:59:14] nothing with them. Lord, I pray tonight,
[1:59:17] dear God, that the word of Lord, word of
[1:59:19] life will pick up in their heart.
[1:59:21] They'll hold their swords and they'll
[1:59:23] cut through every negative thought in
[1:59:26] the name of Jesus Christ. Father, may
[1:59:28] miracles begin to become material right
[1:59:31] in front of their eyes. Father, may they
[1:59:33] receive your mind. May they receive your
[1:59:36] thoughts
[1:59:38] and may those thoughts
[1:59:40] become material
[1:59:42] in this sanctuary.
[1:59:45] In Jesus name we pray. In Jesus name we
[1:59:48] pray.
[1:59:50] I wonder tonight how many could just
[1:59:52] raise your hands and say, "Lord, take my
[1:59:53] mind away. I want the mind of Christ."
[1:59:58] Let the human element go out tonight,
[2:00:00] Lord, and fill that vacancy with the
[2:00:03] spirit of God. Fill that vacancy with
[2:00:06] the spirit of God. Amen. I believe it
[2:00:09] tonight. I believe miracles are
[2:00:10] happening right here.
[2:00:13] I know we've just come out of youth camp
[2:00:14] and some of you were there with us. No
[2:00:16] doubt the devil's already fighting and
[2:00:18] pushing against you.
[2:00:19] But hold fast.
[2:00:22] Hold fast your profession without
[2:00:24] wavering. For he that promised is
[2:00:28] faithful. Amen. Lord, I give you my
[2:00:30] heart. I give you my mind. I give you
[2:00:34] everything I am tonight, Lord. Come and
[2:00:36] use me as a channel
[2:00:39] to bring to pass your will in Jesus
[2:00:42] name. Amen. We want to say God bless you
[2:00:45] all tonight. And I thank you for your
[2:00:48] attention to the word of the Lord. Amen.
[2:00:50] You all, I'm sorry. I'm going to say it.
[2:00:52] Y'all make preaching easy and fun. Amen.
[2:00:56] Word of the Lord is rich to our hearts.
[2:00:57] We love you. The love of the Lord. Amen.
[2:00:59] We'll be gone this weekend over to South
[2:01:02] Carolina preaching some meetings there
[2:01:03] for brother Fred Mullen. So y'all
[2:01:05] remember us in prayer and and then we'll
[2:01:07] be praying for you and I know brother
[2:01:09] Matt will be back home Sunday. Brother
[2:01:10] Matt McGary will be speaking Sunday. And
[2:01:12] Amen. I want to say God bless you all. I
[2:01:14] know we got the Keading family here. God
[2:01:16] bless you and they had Sister Monica and
[2:01:18] others drive great distances to be here.
[2:01:21] Amen. On these Wednesday nights and we
[2:01:23] say God bless you all. May God reward
[2:01:25] you and your faithfulness and Amen.
[2:01:27] everyone that puts forth an effort.
[2:01:28] Amen. Maybe you don't drive an hour,
[2:01:30] hour and a half. Maybe you drive 10
[2:01:32] minutes or 20 minutes or maybe maybe
[2:01:34] five minutes or Amen. But everybody's
[2:01:37] putting forth an effort to bring to
[2:01:39] pass. Amen. Brother Mark, maybe you come
[2:01:42] 30 seconds. Amen. But everybody's
[2:01:45] putting forth an effort to see the power
[2:01:48] of God come among the church of God. And
[2:01:50] I want to say we love you with all their
[2:01:51] hearts. And may God richly bless you be
[2:01:53] our prayer. Amen. How many How many you
[2:01:54] going to go fight that devil this week
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; with a positive confession.
[2:02:00] How many's going to overcome him by the
[2:02:01] word of your testimony?
[2:02:03] Devil say you ain't got a testimony.
[2:02:05] Just say, "I got one, devil.
[2:02:07] God's working on it." Amen. Brother Ben,
[2:02:10] would you come? Amen. We love you for
[2:02:12] the love of the Lord. God bless you

[2:07:15] Lord. Father, we ask that you would just

[2:07:27] safe. Lord, we ask that you would just

[2:07:30] evening, Father. May we just apply it to
[2:07:32] our lives, Lord. In every situation, may
[2:07:35] we have a positive confession, Lord,
[2:07:37] believing that everything is working for
[2:07:38] our good, Lord. We just ask that you
[2:07:40] would just take these carnal minds,
[2:07:42] Father, and just may we cast them away.
[2:07:45] put on the mind of Christ. Lord, we ask
[2:07:47] that you would just be with us, watch
[2:07:49] over us, keep us safe the rest of the
[2:07:51] week, Lord. Bring our pastor home
[2:07:53] safely, let him have a good time, Lord.
[2:07:55] We just commit everything to you, Lord.
[2:07:57] And we just say we thank you, we love
[2:07:59] you, we praise you for all you do. In
[2:08:00] Jesus name, I pray. Amen and amen. Let's
