word tonight how many loves the word amen i' like to speak here out of Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 also will'll turn to Revelations 5 verse1 Hebrews chapter 9:1 says but Christ been come as an high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is a say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and Ashes of he sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through eternal spirit offered up himself without a spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is a mediator of a new testament that by means of death for the Redemption of transgressions that were under the first testament that which are called might receive the promise of the Eternal inheritance for where the Testament is there must also be the necessity by the death of the testator for The Testament of the force after man are dead otherwise is no strength at all while the testator liveth Revelation chapter 5 excuse me verse one says and I saw on the right of the him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book then loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither look thereon and John said I read much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the L of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book hath overcome and conquered and open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof and then behold alone in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the eldest to the lamb as he been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had tooken the book four beasts four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden V full of odas which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying they are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has has redeemed us to God by the blood can you say by the blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth can we bow our hearts one more time tonight Lord Jesus thank you Lord for giving us opportunity Lord to come and worship you in spirit and Truth father we pray now that you'd come in a special way anoint the reading of your word Lord God anoint the words Lord that's spoken tonight Lord anoint the ears to hear Lord God Lord we know that you're in this Tabernacle to tonight Lord for you said where there's two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst Lord we believe you're here Lord have your way in every part every word that is spoken Lord we commit this time unto your hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen can you say praise the Lord amen God bless you tonight as you take your seats we like to take a thought tonight on the contents of the whe and we realize here that even there in Revelation that he says that he's made us unto God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth we realize that we was born of a woman in a few days and full of trouble amen we were born with a sin nature amen nobody had to talk Us in the lon it was just our nature to do those things but we realized down inside of a Believer amen there was a germ seat of Life there was land there dormant all the time Amen brother Braham said it like this you know we're no longer you know we we was always a son we was always an eagle amen you don't receive seed at an altar you always was a seed you the prophet of God said it like this he was existing in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and amen that the king of this world Amen we was we leaned to it we we uh we you know took a uh took a cookie out of the cookie jar and lied about it many times and we follow the nature of that King but there one day if you're a Believer and you're sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight there was another king that was born Amen in the manger of your heart amen that changed you he stuck right back into Earth again Amen to reverse the curse that somebody can live victorious in the hour that we're living in now many times brother Brown would take us back to the Garden of Eden and how brother mad that there was there and there was Perfect Harmony and there was a there was no tears there was no suffering brother Joel there was no sickness there was peace there was Harmony he been in the cool of the evening we find the probably God would tell us that God would come down in the cool of the evening and have fellowship with Adam and Eve amen and we realize what happened there in the Garden of Eden how that the serpent got in and placed his seed in the womb of of Eve and and and because of the love of Adam brother B says many times that Adam was never deceived it was a love that he had for Eve that strained him to go out with her his love for her he took her place in death with her and then we find that how that God would come back down screaming Adam Adam Where Art Thou and there was hiding the over in the bushes ashamed of what what just happened knowing that everything was fixing the changeing there was God he he went and sacrificed the first lamb and took the bloody lamb skins and toss them over to Adam and Eve and they covered themselves and listen what brother BR says here look at it now I see their shoulders stooping around his big body Here Comes an old bloody sheep skin running down those big mangly legs comes blood tears is dripping off their cheeks patting on the top of Eve's head as she leans over to his bosom little believe crying tears patting down it mixed with blood running down her bosom he says what's the matter he says something happened they can cry now they're Mortals now they're dying now he says there you are I can see God say depart out of my presence and he couldn't stand it I can see Adam start walking away as he did and I he can hear something going brother B said clapping his hand amen the blood of the Sheep's can flopping against his leg as it was going out of his presence he says oh I can see God who covers space and time who has no beginning or ending could see it all bottled down like a funnel coming down like this one fourl letter word l ove e he couldn't see his children departing from him he said why he made the Covenant conditionally with Adam but now he's making it an unconditional Covenant he stopped and he couldn't stand it any longer a been seeing his creation seeing Adam and Eve walking out of his presence oh my there was something begin to stir in God in the place brother R said he couldn't stand it any longer that he be to scream out I would put emity between thy seed and the Serpent's Seed amen it was screaming out there's coming a Redeemer there's going to be a deliverer I'm going to bring back what was lost in the Garden of Eden hallelujah amen it was a it was a solemn time it was a solemn hour amen it looked like darkness is going to uh take preeminence but in God's mind amen that he had in his mind from that moment as we pick it up and Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said God had in his mind he's going to restore he's going to bring back amen he's going to have preeminence again like he did in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah and we find it amen it's promising that redeemer's coming it's going to bring back to restore preeminence to restore an Eden again that was his threefold purpose of being first that all that was in God was poured into son Jesus Christ to have preeminence in his body amen all that was in Jesus Christ amen that would be poured out among his Bri to have preeminence once again that he was going to restore again he's going to now take it from the Garden of Eden Tu it from a perfect condition amen and then it turned amen now they can cry now they can taste the feed they can take the taste discouragement and taste death but God says I'm going to come and live in her I'm going to to reverse the curse Hallelujah now bear with me a few moments tonight let's turn our cameras to the another picture 4,000 years later we're in Jerusalem he says I hear a noise he said said what is it it's a screaming mob hollering some people may some poor man has come against it we raise up the shade and look out the window and coming down the streets comes an Old Rugged Cross bouncing over the cobblestones bearing rubbing up the bloody Footprints of the barrier oh Hallelujah my could you just take your vision there tonight he's going to Calvary his back is beaten till his ribs is showing through nearly there he starts up the world walking along here he's going look at him look all over his back there's little red spots over the little old garment that wo with without a seam look at those red spots what are they directly they get bigger and bigger and bigger and the first thing they all run into one big spot now I hear something again I hear something again there's clap brother B claps his hands what is it there goes the second Adam one brought death here goes one bringing life there's one who took life out of the world but here's one who's bringing life back into the world again amen that was in God's mind when he saw him walking out of his presence I'll come again no man can take this place I ain't going to come down I ain't going to become man I ain't going to become kinsman redeemer Hallelujah and he said the second he Adam with his own blood hdden against his legs like that there's one who took life out of the world and here's one's bringing life back in the world again the Son of God going to Calvary to bear away our sins though the shedding of the blood to perfect a man or woman un conditionally brother okay we don't have to do nothing it ain't by works it ain't something that you're doing it's what he done it's called grace Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me it was by his blood by his blood I am healed by his blood I'm delivered by his blood I am free who the son is made free is free indeed God in his body Jesus began to fulfill the contents of the will he walked the shores of Galilee for me he walked the shores of Galilee for you he took those stripes for you he died for you brother zaver he went to hell for you he knocked on the doors of hell for you he went into the devil's headquarters for you amen he told Satan you've tempted my children long enough for you he took the keys of death hell gr and conquered Satan's Trinity for you he said give me those keys you're not going to torment my children any longer and from that point he had in his mind a bring a Shalom to the people he did it for you he was writing sister Sarah he was writing out his will listen to this quote this is powerful listen make uh brother Matt feel like shouting all over this building we're not worthy of living come on somebody brother Morgan from the where you're at to me we're not worthy even to live we're not worthy to come to Christ we're not worthy to ask anything but God never looks at our unworthiness he looked at the lamb if he can find no fault in Christ then he says you are free he died in your stead he said if there's any fault with him you're not free but God don't examine you oh hallelujah sister Eve he doesn't examine you he examines a lamb and when he examines a lamb and there's no spot called in the wrinkle amen that's where he sees you tonight spotless Shameless without a blemish he examines the lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out of the wheelchair tonight he says that that's right sister Denisha you're not but God don't examine you he examines Christ and if he's worthy then you can walk he says if he's worthy he says I he says he examined Christ he said youo I'm not worthy walk out of the wheelchair tonight he says but if he's worthy if Christ the lamb is worthy you can walk out of your wheelchair tonight brother brandom I'm awful woman I've lived illegally I broke my marriage bows Mr Brandon I tell you I've been a drunker I've done this no matter what you done I know that tears illegalist up tonight aen our Prophet tells us no matter what you done God never looks at you he looks at the the [Applause] lamb aren't you thankful tonight we're not worthy tonight but thank God he's not looking at our worthiness tonight he's looking at the lamb and if the lamb is worthy praise God tonight brother Ben you're worthy he looks at the he's already accepted the lamb it's not a future work he said he's already accepted the lamb he's already examined the lamb amen he's already accepted the lamb I know I say this a lot I'm going say it again tonight if that sacrifice is accepted so am I and I say the prophetic voice said tonight he's already don't look at what you've done he looks at the lamb and the lamb has already been accepted God can't see you he sees the lamb dies in your stead he said that's enough to make a fell shout I'm accepted in the Beloved I'm free tonight because of the Lamb I can be healed tonight because of the Lamb I can be delivered tonight because of the Lamb I'm white as snow tonight because of the Lamb Oh my he said there's God's lamb that pulled the stinger out of death that's the one that was perfect he's riding his will Hallelujah there's one that was perfect this is my beloved Son hear you him he said that's Perfection that's what the law could not do the law was Shadow back Y and the offering of sheeps and goats shadow of the Lamb of God slain from the foundation world when he come and was made flesh anchor the Stinger of death he pulled it out for you and I can walk in the face of death and it can't bother us hallelujah it hasn't got any Stinger it can Buzz hum and threaten he said make Bless but that's all it can do death has no more Stinger for every believer that's in Christ Jesus is perfected forever forever you're perfected forever why brother Mar because it's a lamb that's the reason why Hebrews would tell us these priests standed daily offering up the same sacrifice sometimes the same sacrifice over and over again there was no rest there was no peace but that same chapter says but this man offered up once and for all a sacrifice that the father accepted and he said if you're bued in him you are accepted if you're bued in him you're white as snow he said you Devils that's bound these people with sickness I charge thee in the name of the Lamb Jesus Christ to come out of every one of them as a servant of God claiming the word to be truth you leave them you have no rights everything that you ever claim to have oh yeah he's riding his will he's telling us everything that the devil ever claim to have was cancelled was cancelled that day at Calvary and you can't hold them any longer I say if you've been discouraged tonight freedom is yours you don't have to sit there defeated tonight I say there's many times I come to the pull pit I'm wore out I'm tired my flesh may be down my spirit may be torn amen but there's something down inside of the [Applause] Soul another King has been born and it takes over it turns our eyes a different direction everything was cancelled that day at Calvary it it was all redeemed in that one body god brother say God look down upon the sacrifice brother the Caleb God looked down upon the body of Christ he said he saw both male and female the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride see the first Adam seen Eve falling and Adam the Jared because his love for his sweetheart took sin upon himself knowing Brother David knowing but the second Adam seeing that we was lost and took our sins and became one with us hallelujah he took the punishment you've heard me say this before just like Muhammad Ali they say he'd get in the ring he was one of the greatest King at boxing there ever was he would take the beating he would take the punishment he would take the licks he would take the beating and then when he would win the prize he would come back and give the check to his sweetheart and the story says she didn't take one beating she didn't take one lick she didn't take one punishment but she's reaping the benefits of the king I say tonight church at Grace Tabernacle we're reaping the benefits of the king tonight we don't have to take the punishment he's already done it for us we're free because God examine the lamb Hallelujah do you love the Lord now Hebrews 9 and 15 says for this cause he's a mediator of a new testament that means death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament which was called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance where is a testament a covenant that must also be the necessity be the death of the testator now in a natural will a father May ride out his wheel and he begins to include his heirs or Sons or daughters and he begins to put it in a letter form and didn't begins to attach your name to words or promises see the whe is written or typed out but the paper that it's written on is not what's important it's actually the contents of the wheel and he takes that wheel he writes it out and he places a seal upon it and that will stays sealed to the death of the testator and then the executive has the authority to break the seal and read the contents of the wheel when the wheel is about to be read I'm just now getting to the good stuff tonight well the David after the death of the testator the executive begins a summons in other words brother B he begins to notify you not everybody gets the summons you know you might not never know what's going on but those that is part of the will gets their name called out they get notified and the beauty of this is the condescending of God God above us God With Us in Jesus Christ and he condescended down in the form of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit becomes the examp exor of his own will not another Power he couldn't allow any other man to read the contents of the whe so he become the executive of his own will Hallelujah so in other words they don't notify just anybody just those whose name is on the book the message doesn't notify everyone but it does notify Eagles it's a deep calling to a deep sister Debbie some can listen to the message and say he called me a chicken but you and I can listen to the message and we say no no no no he's calling me an eagle one is summon one is notified behold I sin unto you not everybody not everybody that has ears is going to hear what you hear but it called me an eagle brother Morgan he came looking for me Jared he came looking for you Hallelujah he came looking for a woman at the well they had five husbands and the one that she was living with wasn't her own amen he bypassed the priest brother B said because he was never up there his life was blackened out he could tell you the Scrolls he can tell you every word that's written on the Scrolls but he wasn't summoned he wasn't notified Christ become the executor of his own will and condescended down in the form of the Holy Spirit to dwell and roll and rain in his bride to be the final voice to the final AG to execute the contents of the will in our lives to destroy the works of the devil through you and I the will says it's all yours and the executive is living in you to make the contents of his will become alive Hallelujah this is not your work this is his it's Christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah it's his word it's the work of the son of man the word made flesh again I say tonight you are part of the revealing revealing the revealing of the s o n hallelujah amen how could that be because Christ became me that I can become him by Grace Hallelujah there's a man in your kingdom that is a dissolver of doubts the Holy Ghost tonight he says is a dissolver of doubt the executive is living in you brother Amos to come in you and all the fears that you had all the doubt that you had all the weary you had the executive comes to take away and tosolve those doubts how's he going to do that cuz they going to be a mystery revealed Hallelujah the very fear you're not making it the Holy Ghost has come to dissolve every doubt arise walk through this land it's all yours what a present day Revival walk through the land walk through the land tomorrow is a mystery Rel amamos as much as we like to prepare our days tomorrow I have intentions to waking up at 5: in the morning I have intentions to be on the road at 5:30 I have intentions to be in Carwell Missouri at 6 o'clock and loading up but they are just the good intentions we can lose our keys brother xavor and be late we have good intentions but tomorrow's a mystery I can plan all I want to but after tomorrow yesterday is no longer a mystery you know why brother Caleb I've lived it I

contents of the wheel I say there's never been a day brother being like this day brother M was preaching this Sunday morning how's does he reveal it how's he bring it by a prophetic gift so God gave us a prophetic gift in this hour to begin to bring all these loose ends that was laid out here and begin to tie in all these Loose Ends Hallelujah and begin to scream out in the age that we're living in and people call it fanaticism people call it crazy people call it ult people call it whatever they want a pack of Lies a pack of deceits believe a sign but what do you see tonight I hear it ringing out the decorations of the will I hear for the first time a prophetic gift saying here I could tell you tonight this has been a mystery but it's no longer a mystery any longer it is the rising of the sun I know a man that can turn on the lights I know a holy spirit is a dissolver of doubt and he begins to read us the contents of the wheel and he says sister Joyce your Justified as though You' never done it in the first place he told us brother Amos he said hell was created for the devil and his angels hell was never created for you he says there's no shame on you he said every promise in the book is yours claim it tonight you're a pedigree believer and that will says she has never done it in the first place she has not one sin brother Bown said not a thing against her the grace of God has covered her over the bleach has tuck every every sin in our past and broke it down and the will says you don't have to carry the baggage any longer God's going to make the adversary carry your luggage the will says you are free the hour of manifestation are manifesting the contents of the wheel oh church it's Rapture time it's going on time if the content says I'm Healed I'm Healed if the content says I'm going up y I'm going up y if the content says I can walk right out of the storm I'm going to walk right out of that storm right if the contents of the wheel says when the life I'm closing when the life of the head begins to trenle down into the body the Rapture is at hand I say tonight church this bride she's going to start unpacking faster than Satan can pack on her and she says no matter what Satan says devil get out of my way the contents of the will says I'm free Satan get out of my way tonight the contents of the will declares my freedom you know the reason why I sing is because I've heard my name summoned my name I've been notified how many not has got that same Notice come on somebody if you've got that notice and then you got an ear to hear that prophetic voice and the ex the executor of the will is living inside of you sealed to the day of your Redemption and it'sing all our all of my fears it's making me believe I'm going to be one of them and the devil's telling you there's no way brother Matt you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque amen you did the wrong thing amen you should never started this work you should never started preaching the gospel you should have never done this but the executive of the will is thrown in your heart and it begins to break down those thoughts break down those lies and begins to dissolve them to the place it's like no matter what Satan puts on this we're unpacking faster than he could put on that is the bride's Revival you know reason why we shout when we're tired because there's an executive thrown in a h when all of hell is against us yeah there's something down in there saying if God before you if God before you if God before you and old Satan come to you and say no no no no that's not yours we've

hand clap of Praise amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen how many say Amen to that amen amen I just thought that was wonderful brother Joe said Jesus done made a trip that ain't none of us have to ever make a't that right he done made a trip to hell I don't have to go to hell he made a trip to the cross of Calvary I don't have to go that way and I don't even have to see death amen I know how we we may we look at death different than than we ought to look at it but whenever we cross over the other side it it we see somebody leave and we get to feel in that way but when a Believer crosses over they close their eyes in this life and step into another dimension you don't even have to taste the the pain of death brother Mark it's been delivered in this hour I believe that tonight amen that he he made a trip we'll never have to make how many say Amen to that amen can we sing this together will I sought the Lord and he answered me he delivered me from every fear those who look on on him all [Music] radi never be ashamed so magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name together glorify the Lord with me will come exalt his name [Music] forever yes my Lord and he saved me from my enemy God surround him s he deliver them he'll deliver them I say magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name together glorify the Lord with me come exalt his name forever amen how many believe that you have a right to magnify the name of the Lord amen I believe we have a right to it I believe you we we have a purpose brother Mark to come and magnify the name of the Lord Jesus Christ here what a what a a thought tonight that the Lamb of God had paid the price for every every sin and every mistake that we made and you know brother Jo was preaching I got to thinking about how it was in the in the old days when a young man would do something that he shouldn't do and maybe have some sin in his life and you know what he would find himself doing he would go to his father and the father of the house he would go out seeking for a lamb that was worthy of a sacrifice every time there was a failure daddy'd had to go out and search for another lamb but you know he's talking about that tonight how that the price was paid and but Mark you what we realize is that God don't have to go looking for a lamb that the lamb has already been found before the foundation of the world he picked the lamb in so much that whenever Jesus came walking upon the shores of the Jordan River John said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world he was identified before he ever went to the cross of Calvary and if he is identified before them well brother Ben he was identified before you and I before any sin before any mistake before any error any iniquity that would abound in our life that he was already been identified as a spotless lamb and the price was paid you know what tells me Daddy don't have to go looking for a lamb to pay the price for you the price has already been paid the only thing he goes looking for is he goes looking for us and he finds us in our trouble he finds us in our mistakes he finds us in the Blackness of our lives and he brings us to the cross of Calvary and says there's a price that's already been paid on your behalf I thank God that that God ain't looking for a lamb daddy ain't looking for a lamb to cover your sin he's looking for you to bring you to Calvary and show you that the price has been paid how many would heed to the call of God say Lord I'm glad you found me I'm glad you found me when you went out searching for me he found me in the middle of my trouble and he brought me to the cross of Calvary amen I believe we have a right to magnify the name of the Lord amen won't somebody magnify his name tonight somebody say praise the Lord oh let us bless the Lord every day and night and NeverEnding praise let our worship arise let us bless the Lord every day and night a NeverEnding praise Let My Worship arise I magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name together glorify the Lord with me come exalt his name forever magnify the Lord with me come exalt his name forever glorify the Lord with me come exalt his name together oh taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is he who hides in him oh fear the lord all you Saints he'll give you everything thank you Lord he'll give you everything so I say magnify the Lord with me if come all his name together glorify the Lord with me come exalt his name forever oh taste and see that the Lord is good and blessed is he who hides in him amen won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight freedom to worship amen isn't he wonderful amen we have a place to hide in tonight amen we just want to remember uh Brother David mcgard asked the church to uh remember him in prayer and I meant to mention it earlier and slipped my mind but uh he has got recalled on his on his job to work the hour he was working a couple years ago and so uh without trying to explain it all but there's a there's a position on the the job that would allow him to be in church on uh and and not have to worry about being called out and so he's basically on call and and uh you have to get so many uh starts in in order to be able to to keep the job and so um he had all those over the last few weeks and so he just asked the church to remember in prayer that they could move him to the other uh position on the job that he'd be able to be uh back in service and so I I believe that God is mindful of that I believe that we ought to be in church and we ought to have a desire to be in the house of God I know what a prophet of God said he said we'd be there when the doors are open there's some there's a desire in a Believer to come to church and worship God Amen and I know sometimes things gets in the way and jobs and life and all that but uh we'll just pray that the Lord will just move every every block out of our way and I I pray he'd do it for all of us if there's something that that blocks us from being able to be all that God wants us to be I pray God would take it out of my life amen just to free us up to be able to come and worship the Lord amen you love the Lord tonight amen just remember brother Timothy he's still coming had um he'll be here Saturday evening he's being a part of the the funeral services there on Saturday uh afternoon so just be praying for him we tried to excuse him but he just felt led to continue to come this weekend and so we'll just receive him and him and his wife Ruth and daughter out I think are all going to come so we just look forward to having fellowship with them also have our fellowship dinner I believe on uh Sunday afternoon so uh just uh be looking forward to that amen and I just love Fellowship don't schedule don't schedule home dinners on the day of the fellowship dinner you only do it once a month so just uh don't yeah if you if you already had a home dinner plan well praise the Lord bring it on and if and if the girls said that wasn't what you supposed to bring well then y'all blame that one on me but we just want want to come and have some time of Fellowship together and how many loves fellowshipping one with another amen I just believe it really it really is a blessing to the church when we can come and and fellowship uh with each other and how many enjoyed that message again tonight amen y'all be sure amen appreciate brother Joe just yielding to the spirit I don't know why he always asked me if it's okay to do stuff but you got the Liberty to preach go ahead and preach and but we we we trust We Trust our brothers uh to be able to follow the leadership of the Lord amen we've got wonderful uh men that stand uh for the gospel and we appreciate each one of them amen appreciate every one of you for taking a stand for this gospel in this in the crazy world that we live in it takes a real son or daughter of God to be able to stand amen but we're just so thankful so let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord tonight for a wonderful spirit and Lord for coming and speaking to our hearts and Lord what a reminder Lord a a word of evangelism Lord that would come to the church and Lord that would lift us out of sometimes we just get so caught up in our spirit and things and pressures of the life and but Lord that you would just come by and remind us who we are and Lord to speak to our hearts and Lord we're so thankful for everything that's been done and said Lord I appreciate our brother just opening up and speaking and Lord I pray that you would give him an extra blessing Lord and God youd strengthen his body no Lord knowing the labor of work that he is doing this time of year and Lord to take the time just to be able to surrender and to be able to speak to us tonight and Lord I pray that you would bless him and and all of his efforts for that and Lord I pray you would go with each one as we leave this place that we could come back safely expecting to receive something from you and we'll be careful to give you the glory for all you do in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight as you go h we have freedom to worship
