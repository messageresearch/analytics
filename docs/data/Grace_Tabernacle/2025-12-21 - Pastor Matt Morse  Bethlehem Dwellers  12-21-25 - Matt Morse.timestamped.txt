[35:17] Amen. Is that your prayer this morning?
[35:19] Amen. How many love the Lord? Just say
[35:21] it's good to be in the house of the
[35:23] Lord. Want to welcome everybody here
[35:25] this morning and all the home folks,
[35:29] visitors alike. Just trust that the Lord
[35:31] would speak to you this morning. And
[35:34] amen. just a privilege to be in the
[35:36] house of the Lord. I I thank thank each
[35:39] one of you for
[35:41] coming and allowing us to speak to you
[35:44] and just be able to speak what's on on
[35:48] my heart this morning. And I know God is
[35:50] mindful of everything that we have need
[35:52] of. Amen. And he's never failed us. And
[35:56] I don't take this lightly. I never
[35:58] [music]
[35:58] stand before a single person to speak
[36:01] the word of God and in a light way.
[36:04] [music] But uh it's the word of life.
[36:06] It's the most important thing that we
[36:08] could ever hear and the most important
[36:10] decisions that we ever make are in times
[36:13] like these. Amen. And uh before the word
[36:15] of the Lord. So we just want to before
[36:18] we read out of the scripture, we want to
[36:21] bow our heads just ask the Lord to come.
[36:24] Remember sister Barbara requesting
[36:26] prayer for family [music] sickness in
[36:28] her family. Also Aiden sick this
[36:31] morning.
[36:33] Prayer request for Adam Rond Rondell. He
[36:37] was in a wreck on Friday in the ICU in
[36:39] Memphis Hospital. Remember him in
[36:41] prayer. It's from Sister Sandy. If you
[36:44] have a need on your heart, just lift
[36:45] your hand to the Lord. I know he's
[36:46] mindful of what we have need of. And
[36:48] [music] I believe we have a right as
[36:50] believers to approach him and to invite
[36:52] him on the scene this morning. So, let's
[36:53] just pray each one in your own way.
[36:55] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we
[36:58] love you today. Lord, we're so thankful
[37:01] for your presence here, Lord. How
[37:04] wonderful that you are, Lord. Tremendous
[37:07] anointing, Lord, that you've given
[37:08] [music] us in this hour, Lord. And God,
[37:12] you've just been so good [music] to us,
[37:14] Lord. And here, your spirit is here. And
[37:19] Lord, we just ask you, Lord, as we stand
[37:21] in your presence, Lord, and God, that
[37:23] you would take everything that is unlike
[37:25] you, Lord, and let it be moved from this
[37:27] place. And Lord, let us just take a
[37:29] moment just to surrender ourselves to
[37:31] you, Lord. That you could just come and
[37:34] speak to every heart. And Lord, that you
[37:36] would meet every need, every sickness,
[37:38] the sickness would be healed. And God,
[37:40] that we would leave this place, Lord. We
[37:42] would grow in thy word. And we would go
[37:45] out of this [music] building closer to
[37:46] you than we were when we came in. And
[37:49] Lord, we just ask you to anoint the word
[37:50] as we speak it. And we'll give you the
[37:53] glory for all that's done now. [music]
[37:54] In Jesus name we pray.
[37:57] Amen.
[37:58] For you're worthy of [singing] it all.
[38:06] You're worthy [singing and music]
[38:07] of it all.
[38:13] For from you are all things.
[38:17] To you [singing] are all [music] things.
[38:20] You deserve the glory.
[38:27] You're worthy of it all.
[38:32] [singing]
[38:34] You're worthy [music] of it all.
[38:38] [singing]
[38:41] For from you [music] are all things.
[38:44] To you are [singing] all things
[38:48] and you deserve the glory.
[38:50] [singing and music]

[39:16] [music] And you deserve the glory.

[39:24] of it all.
[39:27] Yes, my [singing and music] Lord. You're
[39:30] worthy of it all.
[39:33] [singing]
[39:36] Oh, from [music] you are all things.
[39:40] And to you are all things.
[39:43] and you deserve the glory.
[39:49] Amen. How many declare him worthy this
[39:51] morning? [music] Amen. We just want to
[39:54] give the Lord a hand clap of praise and
[39:56] Amen. just to come and [applause]
[40:01] here in the holiday season around
[40:04] [music] Christmas time and Lord just put
[40:06] a Christmas message on my heart for you
[40:09] this morning. So trust it be a blessing
[40:12] to the church and just want to invite
[40:15] you to the scripture to the book of
[40:16] Zechariah. We'll read out of the 13th
[40:18] chapter and we'll start in the first
[40:20] verse. Zechariah 13 and one. I sure
[40:24] enjoyed that message Wednesday night.
[40:25] Amen. Wasn't that wasn't that good on
[40:28] that throughout the week and some of the
[40:31] brothers testimony being planted. Amen.
[40:34] Amen. We all go through things. How many
[40:36] enjoyed that? Was here Wednesday night.
[40:37] Amen. just tremendous.
[40:40] God bless you, brother Joe, for that.
[40:41] And Amen. It takes a lot just to
[40:44] surrender to the Lord and and we sure
[40:46] appreciate I appreciate our ministers
[40:48] and appreciate our young people. Man,
[40:51] wasn't that wonderful? Those young kids
[40:53] singing and my
[40:56] there was a whole bunch of the little
[40:57] ones. And somebody told me the other day
[41:00] that there was nearly 70 young people in
[41:02] our church and which I didn't there was
[41:05] 25 of the older groups singing the other
[41:07] day and 25 or 30 of these and then I
[41:10] ain't no telling how many babies
[41:13] but there's a there's a bunch of them
[41:15] and but there's a there's a growing
[41:17] youth group and it just does my heart
[41:19] good to see young people on fire for the
[41:21] Lord and and so we just we just thank
[41:24] God for each one of them and but we want
[41:26] to read out of Zechariah the third
[41:28] chapter or the 13th chapter, excuse me.
[41:32] And we're going to read from the first
[41:34] verse. So, Zechariah
[41:36] 13 and one. And the Bible says, "In that
[41:40] day there shall be a fountain open to
[41:42] the house of David and to the
[41:44] inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin, and
[41:48] for uncleanness. And it shall come to
[41:50] pass in that day, sayaeth the Lord of
[41:52] Hosts, that I will cut off that I will
[41:56] thou will cut off of the names of the
[41:58] idols out of the land, and they shall no
[42:00] more be remembered. And also I will
[42:03] cause the prophets and the unclean
[42:05] spirit to pass out of the land. And
[42:08] we'll just ask the Lord to add his
[42:10] blessing to the reading of the word. And
[42:12] as you take your seats this morning, I
[42:14] would like to speak on Bethlehem
[42:16] dwellers. on Bethlehem dwellers
[42:20] here. This book of uh Zechariah, it was
[42:22] written a period as Hagi 500 years
[42:26] before Jesus uh was born on the earth.
[42:29] And of course, if you read of the
[42:30] prophecies of Zechariah, you'll find uh
[42:33] that that he speaks of the future of the
[42:36] salvation of Israel. And when you study
[42:38] Zechariah, there's actually two parts to
[42:40] the uh book of Zechariah. uh the first
[42:43] few chapters, I believe it's the first
[42:44] eight chapters, they speak of of the
[42:47] building or the or the restoration of
[42:49] the temple in in uh Jerusalem or or the
[42:52] rebuilding uh after they come out of
[42:54] that Babylonian captivity. And uh it's
[42:57] the restoration of the natural part of
[42:59] Israel. But uh when you get to the ninth
[43:01] chapter on on uh it's called the oracles
[43:04] is and so uh in the oracles Zechariah is
[43:06] no longer talking about the things that
[43:09] are going on uh presently in Israel
[43:11] because here he was in that time when
[43:13] they were rebuilding and restoring. So
[43:14] God used him for that restoration. But
[43:17] uh when it comes to the other chapters
[43:19] he speaks it's what's called the
[43:20] oracles. He's speaking of a coming uh of
[43:23] a messiah. So there's a there it's it's
[43:26] all about the Messiah or the coming of a
[43:28] Messiah. And the prophecies are no
[43:30] longer local prophecies, but they're
[43:32] spanning across hundreds of years or
[43:34] thousands of years in time. And along
[43:36] with Isaiah, David, the book of Daniel,
[43:39] uh uh many of the Old Testament
[43:41] prophecies, mainly Isaiah and David in
[43:43] Psalms, but uh but Zachchariah was also
[43:45] of those that prophesied of the coming
[43:47] of Jesus. He prophesies of his birth. He
[43:49] prophesies that he would be sold for uh
[43:51] 30 pieces of silver. He even speaks of
[43:53] his crucifixion, how he would be pierced
[43:55] with a sword or or or with a spear. And
[43:58] uh but in the seventh verse of the 13th
[44:00] chapter, Zechariah says, "Awake, oh
[44:02] sword, against my shepherd, and against
[44:05] the man that is my fellow, sayeth the
[44:06] Lord of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and
[44:09] the sheep shall be scattered, and I will
[44:10] turn mine hand upon the shepherd would
[44:12] become a catalyst to the people
[44:14] returning back to the Lord." And so when
[44:16] you read actually when Jesus is
[44:18] arrested, Jesus actually says this
[44:20] written, I will smite the shepherd and
[44:22] the sheep of the flock shall be
[44:24] scattered abroad. So even Jesus declares
[44:26] that the prophecy of Zechariah is
[44:28] speaking of him. He so he said this
[44:30] night you shall be offended for what
[44:32] Zachchariah spoke is going to take place
[44:34] this night that I will smite the
[44:36] shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[44:37] shall be scattered. So it's definitely a
[44:39] prophecy that is concerning Jesus. So we
[44:41] realize that this is actually what it is
[44:44] is what fulfilled the opening of the
[44:46] fountain. So when the Bible says in that
[44:48] day there shall be a fountain open to
[44:51] the house of David for sin and
[44:53] uncleanness. So we realize it's a
[44:55] prophecy. It's certain that it's
[44:57] speaking of Jesus and the smiting of the
[44:59] shepherd would be would bring about the
[45:01] opening of that fountain. Zechariah's
[45:03] talking about a fountain being opened.
[45:04] He's talking about a cleansing that is
[45:06] going to come to Israel. But in order
[45:08] for that to happen, there had to be a
[45:10] shepherd. and the shepherd had to be
[45:11] smitten and the sheep had to be
[45:13] scattered, but then there would come a
[45:14] time that they would all be brought back
[45:16] into this place with God. So, we realize
[45:18] that because this is a prophecy uh from
[45:21] the Lord, it speaks of cleansing. It's
[45:23] speaking of a purification from
[45:24] idolatry. And it's talking about a
[45:26] people coming back to God. And I I don't
[45:28] know if y'all was here last week, but
[45:30] last Sunday we were speaking on the gods
[45:32] of our fathers and and how easy it is to
[45:35] pick up these gods. How many remember
[45:36] that? Remember what a god is? A god was
[45:38] an object of worship. It's something
[45:40] that you worship. It It don't matter
[45:42] what it is. It could be an object. It
[45:43] could be a It It could be anything
[45:46] that's built with a man's hands. It
[45:48] could be an idol. It could be an image.
[45:49] It could be a picture. It could be
[45:51] somebody. But remember what Jesus said?
[45:53] He said, "God is a spirit and they that
[45:55] worship him must worship him in spirit
[45:57] and in truth." But friends, can I tell
[45:59] you something this morning just to be
[46:01] plain with you? That although God is a
[46:03] spirit, do you know that God is not the
[46:05] only spirit? But there's other spirits
[46:07] beside God. So I can say it like this
[46:09] this morning, but yet Satan is a spirit.
[46:12] And they that worship him worship him
[46:13] also in spirit. And it ain't in truth.
[46:16] It may be in the spirit of error, but
[46:18] people worship Satan in spirit just like
[46:20] they worship God in spirit. They get
[46:22] attached to spirits. They worship
[46:24] spirits. They make idols out of these
[46:26] spirits. They they become the rulers
[46:28] over their lives. and and because of our
[46:30] nature and because of humanity and our
[46:32] desire to worship and because we build
[46:35] up these idols and there had to come a
[46:37] cleansing that would cast away the idols
[46:40] of worship out of our life, the gods of
[46:42] our fathers, the things that we picked
[46:44] up throughout our life. There has to
[46:45] come a cleansing in our life that we can
[46:47] cast away people over at the house. But
[46:49] I remember one day when when the when
[46:51] the the dishes was piled up all over the
[46:53] they were in the sink, they were on the
[46:55] they were on the table. They were on the
[46:56] counter and and it was just a big mess.
[46:58] So, mom mom was gone and me and Mark, we
[47:01] had this great idea. We're going to be
[47:02] good Samaritans. We're going to help mom
[47:04] out and and so we got all the dishes and
[47:06] we got a little wagon and we loaded them
[47:07] all up in the wagon. We took them all in
[47:09] the bathroom, filled the bathtub up with
[47:11] water and and and we we got our little
[47:13] sister's bassinet, her little baby
[47:15] bassinet and we brought it in there, set
[47:16] it by the bathtub and and and boy, we
[47:19] just put every dish. It was the best
[47:20] place, wasn't it, Mark CI? Because the
[47:22] the sink wouldn't hold the dishes, but
[47:24] the bathtub, it was a bigger basin. And
[47:26] and so we filled it full for a little
[47:28] while. You know
[47:31] you what we
[47:33] there and of course we don't see what
[47:35] mom sees. We just seen the dishes and
[47:36] the and what we did. Mom seen a mess. I
[47:40] can't imagine. I mean we in the wagon.
[47:42] The wagon had mud on the wheels. It it
[47:44] it was a it was a mess in mom's side.
[47:47] And so so e even though we were washing
[47:49] she she got really up upset at us. And
[47:52] we couldn't figure out we were we were
[47:53] kids. We couldn't figure out why mom was
[47:55] upset. And and uh but but what we didn't
[47:57] realize as children is we didn't realize
[48:00] that conditioner didn't have the ability
[48:03] to take pork chop grease off of a
[48:05] ceramic plate. And so mom knew this. She
[48:08] knew that no matter how much conditioner
[48:09] that you put on it, it wasn't ever going
[48:11] to clean it. And it it didn't matter how
[48:13] it didn't matter how you know how many
[48:15] times you scrubbed it, it wasn't going
[48:16] to turn. It's not an agent that has the
[48:18] ability to remove grease. And so we had
[48:20] quite a moment of understanding with mom
[48:23] about how to wash dishes. And we earned
[48:24] some dish duty and how how to do it
[48:26] properly because we wanted to help. And
[48:28] so uh from that day forward, we knew how
[48:30] to do dishes, didn't we? We and we we
[48:32] sure wasn't afraid to get up there and
[48:34] do the dishes. That's a free one for mom
[48:35] and dad. But but but but we but we
[48:37] learned a little bit about cleansing the
[48:39] the alkalion metals on the periodic
[48:41] table of elements over on the left hand
[48:42] side, three or four down. And so you
[48:44] take sodium and hydrogen and oxygen,
[48:46] they mixed it together and it formed
[48:47] this compound called lie. But in chem
[48:49] class, you would take the lie and mix it
[48:52] with an oil. And when with oil, it would
[48:54] there I forget the uh the name of the
[48:56] process, but the process that occurred,
[48:58] it formed a chemical reaction. It became
[49:01] soap. In other words, it would sud up.
[49:03] It would make suds when you mixed it
[49:05] with water. But with that oil and it
[49:07] became that that agent, it actually
[49:09] created what science calls a lifting
[49:12] agent. And so because so now it's a
[49:14] soap, it had the ability to separate
[49:16] dirt from the oils of the body. that. So
[49:18] that's why they they made up this live
[49:20] soap and you know you when you put it on
[49:21] the body it has the power to do what
[49:24] water by itself can't do. See you can
[49:27] take water all day and you can wash it
[49:29] in water and there's a lot of people
[49:30] that's been washed in water. Preach
[49:32] somebody there. You can take water all
[49:33] day and you can wash them in the water
[49:35] and you can bury them in water and you
[49:37] can dip them in all the water. You can
[49:38] sprinkle them in water. But there has to
[49:40] be an agent that would get a hold of the
[49:43] dirt that would remove the dirt from a
[49:45] body. See it takes more than water. But
[49:47] I say this this morning that just as
[49:49] there was a cleansing agent in the
[49:51] natural that God has made a cleansing
[49:53] agent in the spiritual and the Bible
[49:55] said and the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:58] cleanses us from all sin. You know that
[50:00] tells me that the blood of Jesus is a
[50:02] cleansing agent. It has the ability to
[50:05] do something that water can't do. It can
[50:07] take dirt from your skin. It can take
[50:09] dirt from your life. It can take dirt
[50:11] from your past. all the things that
[50:13] you've been born in and drugged through
[50:14] and out in the mud in the dirt of sin,
[50:17] the filth of this world. But that
[50:18] cleansing agent called the blood of
[50:20] Jesus Christ has the ability to remove
[50:23] the dirt of this life out of your life
[50:25] and cleanse you and set you aside whole
[50:27] on the other side. Oh friends, let me
[50:29] tell you, it's a cleansing agent. It
[50:31] ain't something you can buy in a store.
[50:33] You can't go down to the church
[50:34] bookstore and buy it. You can't go down
[50:36] to the Bible bookstore and get it. But
[50:38] there ain't but one place. It's a David.
[50:40] The Bible said there is a fountain that
[50:42] is open. I say it's a fountain filled
[50:45] with blood. It's drawn from Emanuel's
[50:47] veins. And when the sinners plunge
[50:49] beneath the beneath the flood, they lose
[50:51] all their guilty stains. It's a fountain
[50:55] that's filled with blood. It's an
[50:56] inexhaustible fountain. And listen what
[50:59] David said about this fountain. He said
[51:01] it's opened unto the house of David.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Now think about this house of David. You
[51:06] realize promise here. David was sitting
[51:08] as a king of Israel. I just want to read
[51:10] this to you out of the scripture. The
[51:11] Bible said, "It came to pass when the
[51:13] king sat in his house, and the Lord had
[51:15] given him rest round about from all of
[51:17] his enemies, that the king said unto
[51:19] Nathan the prophet, see now I dwell in a
[51:22] house of cedar, but the ark of the Lord
[51:24] dwelleth within the curtains." And
[51:26] Nathan said unto him, "Go do all that is
[51:30] in thy heart, for the Lord is with
[51:31] thee." And it came to pass that night
[51:34] that the word of the Lord came unto
[51:36] Nathan saying, "Go tell my servant
[51:38] David." So here David has on his heart
[51:41] to build something for the Lord. And God
[51:43] comes that night to the prophet Nathan
[51:45] and gives a message to David. How many
[51:46] remembers what the message was? He said
[51:49] they he said that that thus sayeth the
[51:50] Lord, shalt thou build me a house for me
[51:53] to dwell in? Have I not dwelt in any
[51:55] house since the time I was brought you
[51:56] up out of Israel and out of Egypt? I
[51:58] walk in a tent and a tabernacle. Was
[52:01] there ever a time that I ever asked for
[52:02] a cedar house? Was there ever a time
[52:04] that I asked for you to build me this in
[52:06] such a way? He said, "But thou shalt say
[52:08] unto my servant David that that that I
[52:11] brought you from following uh from the
[52:13] sheep coat and from following the sheep
[52:15] and to be a ruler over my people of
[52:17] Israel. I was with you wherever you
[52:19] went. I've cut you off from your
[52:20] enemies, out of thy sight. I've made
[52:22] thee thy great name like unto the great
[52:24] men that are in thee. Moreover, I will
[52:26] appoint a place for my people Israel,
[52:28] and I will plant them that they may
[52:30] dwell in a place of their own and move
[52:32] no more. Here's here's what God is is
[52:35] settling in David's heart that I am
[52:37] going to plant a place that my children
[52:40] can inhabit that they don't have to move
[52:41] no more. I'm going to give them a
[52:43] permanent dwelling place. I won't have
[52:45] to move no more. And neither shall the
[52:47] children of wickedness afflict them
[52:48] anymore as before. And as since that
[52:51] time I commanded judges over the people
[52:53] of Israel, I've caused you to rest from
[52:55] thine enemies. Also the Lord tellth him
[52:57] that I will make thee that he will make
[52:59] thee a house. And when thy days shall be
[53:02] fulfilled, and you shall sleep with thy
[53:03] fathers. I will set up thy seed after
[53:06] thee, which shall be proceed out of thy
[53:08] boughs, and I will establish his
[53:09] kingdom. And he shall build a house,
[53:12] speaking to David. And he shall build a
[53:14] house for my name, and will establish
[53:16] the throne of his kingdom forever. and I
[53:19] will be his father and he shall be my
[53:21] son. And if he commit iniquity, I will
[53:23] chasen him with the rod of men and with
[53:25] the stripes of the children of men. But
[53:27] my mercy shall not depart away from him
[53:30] as I took it away from Saul. But whom
[53:32] what a promise from God. Yeah, you may
[53:34] fall like Saul did, and you may make
[53:36] mistakes like Saul did, and you may have
[53:38] iniquity just like Saul did. But unlike
[53:40] Saul, I will never remove my mercy away
[53:43] from you. I'm going to build a house
[53:45] that cannot be destroyed. I'm going to
[53:47] build a house that will not fail. And
[53:49] you'll live in it, but your iniquity,
[53:50] you may get in trouble. You may be
[53:52] chasened as I would chasen men, but my
[53:54] mercy will never leave you.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; In thy house and thy kingdom shall be
[53:59] established forever before thee, and thy
[54:01] throne shall be established forever. So
[54:04] here God gives this promise unto David
[54:06] that he has a a a throne that would be
[54:09] there forever. So the house of David is
[54:11] established. But when you read in the
[54:12] history about the house of David,
[54:14] according to the Hebrew Bible, David and
[54:16] his house, they were appointed by God to
[54:18] rule over all of Israel. This is what
[54:20] God promises him. You're going to rule
[54:22] over all of Israel. But but if you ever
[54:23] look up the term what he's speaking of
[54:25] when he speaks of Israel, he's actually
[54:27] speaking of the United Kingdom of
[54:29] Israel. Now, how many knows that
[54:30] whenever David had became king that it
[54:33] included the tribe of Judah, which is
[54:35] which was in the south. That's where
[54:36] David's uh home territory was. That's
[54:38] where that's where Jerusalem was. That's
[54:40] where he came into power. But it also
[54:42] included the 10 northern tribes of
[54:44] Israel, which is where Saul ruled before
[54:47] David took over his kingdom. So Saul
[54:49] ruled over these 10 these 10 tribes. And
[54:51] David here that come from Judah. But
[54:53] when David became the king of Israel, it
[54:56] became a united kingdom. It was no
[54:58] longer divided. So his rulership or
[55:00] dominionship was over the entire
[55:02] kingdom. But you notice as you read
[55:04] through history, you'll find out that
[55:06] after the death of David's son Solomon,
[55:08] that the tribes of is Israel, they split
[55:10] from that united kingdom. And then
[55:12] Rahoboam, which took over Judah, uh the
[55:15] house of David, that's the only part of
[55:17] it that he ruled over. Uh he had his
[55:19] capital in Jerusalem, but all the other
[55:21] 10 uh tribes, they were they had other
[55:24] kings that was raised up. So here, as
[55:26] God had given this promise that he would
[55:28] rule over it all, but just short time
[55:29] through history, it's no longer
[55:31] together. It separated Raboam's only
[55:34] only ruling over a certain part. But
[55:36] then in the then come that Babylonian
[55:39] war and the destruction of Jerusalem and
[55:41] they exiled the the remaining Davidic
[55:44] kings and now Jehoken and Zedekiah they
[55:46] were taken out of there and it actually
[55:48] ended the dynasty of King David. So, so
[55:52] you realize that that even though God
[55:54] had made this promise to David, when you
[55:56] and this kingdom would be established
[55:58] forever, but when you read through
[56:00] history, it wasn't just a few years
[56:01] through history, the kingdom was
[56:03] divided. It was torn apart. Jerusalem
[56:06] was torn down. Babylon had taken over.
[56:08] The kings had been exiled. And no longer
[56:11] was there a dividic king in the throne
[56:12] of Israel. So, it looks like it ended.
[56:15] And brother Mark, in the natural, it did
[56:16] end. But the problem is is the prophecy
[56:19] was still there. See, if you only looked
[56:21] at that in the natural, you'd say,
[56:22] "Well, well, then Zechariah's prophecy
[56:24] didn't come to pass." But his prophecy
[56:26] was still there. He said, "Thy house and
[56:28] thy kingdom shall be established forever
[56:31] before thee, and thy throne shall be
[56:34] established forever." Even though it
[56:36] looked like it was over, but when you
[56:38] read about the house of David, you have
[56:40] to realize that the house of David
[56:42] didn't end with David's natural lineage.
[56:45] It wasn't just talking about David in
[56:46] the natural, but the house of David in
[56:48] the scripture is referring to King
[56:50] David's dynasty that was established by
[56:52] God and promising an eternal rule
[56:55] through David's descendants. But
[56:57] whenever it was fulfilled, it wasn't
[56:59] fulfilled in David or or Jehokin or or
[57:02] these other kings, but it was fulfilled
[57:04] in Jesus Christ. So, it was the promise
[57:07] of a Messiah who fulfilled the lineage
[57:10] to bring a peace upon the earth. So you
[57:13] realize it wasn't just a physical house,
[57:16] but brother Charles, it was it was God's
[57:18] chosen royal line. It wasn't just the
[57:20] physical lineage of David or the
[57:22] bloodline of David, but it was God's
[57:24] chosen royal line. That's why when you
[57:25] read of the birth of Jesus, it includes
[57:28] the lineage of David. Remember in Luke
[57:30] the first chapter, the Bible said, "And
[57:32] in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel
[57:34] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[57:36] named Nazareth to a virgin espouseed to
[57:38] a man named Joseph of the house of
[57:40] David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
[57:42] And the angel came into her and said,
[57:44] "Hail Mary, thou art highly favored. The
[57:46] Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[57:48] among women." And when she saw him, she
[57:50] was troubled at his saying, and cast in
[57:52] her mind what manner of salutation it
[57:54] should be. And the angel said unto her,
[57:57] "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
[57:59] favor with God. And behold, you shall
[58:02] conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
[58:04] son, and shall call his name Jesus, and
[58:06] he shall be great, and he shall be
[58:08] called the Son of the Highest. and the
[58:11] Lord God shall give unto him the throne
[58:14] of his father David. So here we realize
[58:17] that it was not the ending of David's
[58:20] lineage when the natural fell apart, but
[58:22] the Bible said he shall give unto Christ
[58:26] unto his throne f of his father David
[58:29] and he shall reign that the dynasty of
[58:31] David or the lineage of David uh the
[58:33] descendant of King David that would that
[58:36] would that would go go through David
[58:38] that was forming this royal bloodline.
[58:40] But you realize that that bloodline of
[58:42] the house of David when David was born
[58:44] or or became king then the bloodline of
[58:47] the prophecy of Zechariah came to pass.
[58:49] You real you realize he was speaking a
[58:51] bloodline into existence. He was he was
[58:53] talking about a bloodline that was
[58:55] coming through the through the king
[58:56] David. And when that prophecy went
[58:58] forth, there was a bloodline that came
[59:00] out of David that carried on this this
[59:02] physical bloodline into Israel. But that
[59:05] physical bloodline, brother Mark, it
[59:07] died in and Zedekiah. Oh, but I thank
[59:10] God this morning that that wasn't the
[59:12] end of the bloodline. See, there was
[59:13] another bloodline that was greater than
[59:16] the natural. It's greater than a natural
[59:18] birth. Brother David Paul's greater than
[59:20] a natural seed. See, brother Bam said,
[59:22] "We find in Israel when they were
[59:24] compared with Moab how that they stayed
[59:26] true and the bloodline was true." He
[59:28] said, "But we find out there that Moab
[59:30] was illegitimate. They were all
[59:32] fundamental just the same as Israel was.
[59:35] But Israel who had the true bloodline
[59:37] and signs and wonders following them,
[59:38] they had a brass serpent. They had
[59:40] divine healing. They had a shout of a
[59:42] king in their camp. They had a smitten
[59:44] rock for their salvation. So here's
[59:46] talking about how that the bloodline was
[59:49] there before David was even there.
[59:50] Before David was even before king this
[59:53] bloodline that was that that that the
[59:55] prophet was prophesying of is something
[59:57] that was lo that was there long before
[59:59] David ever took office. He said they had
[1:00:01] a heavenly father that fed them from
[1:00:03] above. They were having a glorious time.
[1:00:05] They weren't yolked up. They were an
[1:00:07] interdenominational group of people just
[1:00:09] floating around and they were people
[1:00:11] making fun of them because they wasn't a
[1:00:13] nation. They was a scattered people. I
[1:00:15] wonder how many say amen to that. They
[1:00:16] kind of pick on you because you don't
[1:00:18] belong to a big group or or pick on you
[1:00:20] because you don't belong to a certain
[1:00:21] organization or or you don't have a a
[1:00:23] founding fathers or founding members
[1:00:25] over your door. He said, "But here it
[1:00:27] is. I hope you get it." They were headed
[1:00:29] for their homeland. A perfect type of
[1:00:31] the true church today. Headed for their
[1:00:33] homeland, wandering about in sheep skins
[1:00:36] and goat skins. They were destitute. He
[1:00:38] said, "But we are looking for a city
[1:00:41] whose builder and maker is God. And
[1:00:43] that's the way the true church is moving
[1:00:46] today, brother Mark, because we're led
[1:00:48] by another bloodline. We're not of the
[1:00:50] bloodline of the natural lineage of
[1:00:52] Israel. We're not of the bloodline of
[1:00:53] the natural lineage of David, but and
[1:00:56] therefore because we're not of that
[1:00:58] bloodline, we're not bound by
[1:00:59] denominational rule. Hello, somebody.
[1:01:01] We're not bound by the attacks on our
[1:01:03] church. We're not bound by the attacks
[1:01:05] on the message. We're not I'm not bound
[1:01:07] by I don't care what people say on the
[1:01:08] outside because I'm a part of a royal
[1:01:11] bloodline. I know where I came from and
[1:01:13] I know where I'm going and I know the
[1:01:15] blood that is flowing through the veins
[1:01:17] of every believer. It's a spiritual
[1:01:18] bloodline that was sent from the cross
[1:01:20] of Calvary. Sunday offering. I don't
[1:01:22] care what they say. I heard a guy say
[1:01:24] the other day, he said, "Every time you
[1:01:26] prove these message believers wrong," he
[1:01:28] said, "they just stand up and say,
[1:01:29] "Well, that's fine. I believe it
[1:01:31] anyway." I thought, "Hallelujah. It
[1:01:32] don't matter what you say to them
[1:01:34] because there's something on the inside
[1:01:36] of them that causes them to be a
[1:01:38] believer." You said, "How do you know
[1:01:39] you believe the message?" Can I just
[1:01:41] tell you this morning? Because I believe
[1:01:42] that we're living in Leoa. Hello,
[1:01:44] somebody. I believe that we're living in
[1:01:46] a rapture age. I believe we're living in
[1:01:48] the end time. I believe in laying hands
[1:01:50] on the sick and they recover. I believe
[1:01:52] in divine healing. I believe in the
[1:01:54] supernatural. I don't believe Eve ate an
[1:01:56] apple. I DO. BUT I DO BELIEVE IN
[1:01:58] holiness and I believe that women ought
[1:02:00] to be women and men ought to be men. I
[1:02:02] believe in election. I believe in divine
[1:02:04] appointment. I believe in
[1:02:05] predestination. I BELIEVE IN THE
[1:02:07] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. I BELIEVE IN
[1:02:09] EPHESIANS THE FOURTH CHAPTER. I DON'T
[1:02:10] BELIEVE JUST PART OF IT. I BELIEVE ALL
[1:02:12] OF IT. I BELIEVE GOD SENT PASTORS AND
[1:02:14] TEACHERS AND EVANGELISTS AND AND
[1:02:17] APOSTLES AND PROPHETS UNDER THE LAND.
[1:02:19] I'M A BELIEVER. YOU SAY, "WHY DO YOU
[1:02:21] BELIEVE IT?" BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO.
[1:02:23] WHY ARE YOU A MESSAGE BELIEVER? CUZ THE
[1:02:25] BIBLE SAYS SO. I'M NOT BOUND by a
[1:02:27] denomination or bound by some church
[1:02:30] creed, but I I'm of a different
[1:02:31] bloodline.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You're attacking the wrong thing. Let me
[1:02:34] just tell you out there, you're
[1:02:36] attacking the wrong thing. You say,
[1:02:38] "Well, you know, Brother Brandham lied
[1:02:39] about this or the they lied about this."
[1:02:41] But let me tell you, when you try to
[1:02:42] tell a message believer, you're running
[1:02:44] a fool's errand. You can waste your time
[1:02:46] all you want to. You can call me a
[1:02:48] fanatic if you want to, but let me tell
[1:02:50] you, don't you ever associate God called
[1:02:53] believers. I know what they do. They
[1:02:54] just attack. Well, look what he did. I
[1:02:55] know what they do. They just attack.
[1:02:56] Well, look what he did over here. And
[1:02:58] you know, he was just a man. And one
[1:02:59] time he told a story and I may as well
[1:03:01] just preach. But one time he told a
[1:03:03] story and there was 400. Next time he
[1:03:04] told it there was 600. And they took put
[1:03:06] them side by side. See, he lied because
[1:03:09] one day he said 400, one day he said
[1:03:11] 600. I hope y'all don't ever hear me
[1:03:12] tell a story
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; how many people got baptized in India. I
[1:03:16] don't know how many it was to this day,
[1:03:17] but I remember it was a bunch. And if
[1:03:19] you want to go back and find the first
[1:03:20] time I ever told it, you might find out
[1:03:22] the real number. But because I'm human
[1:03:24] and the weakness of humanity, sometimes
[1:03:27] I think it was 30 and sometimes I think
[1:03:28] it was 50. I don't always remember
[1:03:31] because I'm a human. So when you attack
[1:03:33] THE WEAKNESS OF A PERSON'S HUMANITY,
[1:03:35] don't think that that causes me as a
[1:03:37] believer to be discouraged. Matter of
[1:03:39] fact, the more flaws that you point out,
[1:03:42] the more faith I have.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You know why it gives me faith? It's
[1:03:45] because it gives me faith in my own
[1:03:47] experience because it proves that God
[1:03:50] can use somebody with mistakes and God
[1:03:52] can use somebody with failures and God
[1:03:55] can use somebody that's flesh and God
[1:03:57] can use SOMEBODY THAT FORGETS JUST LIKE
[1:03:59] I DO. AND IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME HOW
[1:04:01] MUCH YOU forgot and how much he TOLD
[1:04:03] SOMETHING WRONG, I SAY, "THANK GOD
[1:04:04] BECAUSE I DO IT ALL THE TIME." BUT THAT
[1:04:06] MEANS GOD CAN STILL USE SOMEBODY LIKE me
[1:04:10] because I'm a part of a different
[1:04:11] bloodline. Therefore, I'm a believer.
[1:04:13] But said, "The one who made the line of
[1:04:15] blood." Listen, this is the bloodline
[1:04:16] we're a part of. He made the line of
[1:04:18] blood all the way from Pilot's judgment
[1:04:20] hall to Galatha. That's the line that we
[1:04:23] stand in. It's the bloodline of the Lord
[1:04:25] Jesus. That's how we gain faith. That's
[1:04:28] how we gain power. That's how we defeat
[1:04:30] the devil. We That's how you look at the
[1:04:33] devil and say you're nothing but a
[1:04:34] deceiver. You have no legal rights to
[1:04:36] hold anything over a Christian.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; He once had you bound, but now he's
[1:04:39] bound.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a part of a
[1:04:42] different bloodline.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's a bloodline. You belong to God.
[1:04:46] You're God's property. Abraham said, "In
[1:04:49] the beginning was the word." This is a
[1:04:50] scripture. The the word was with God.
[1:04:52] The word was God. And and the word was
[1:04:55] made flesh and dwelt among us. And we
[1:04:56] beheld him in the glory of the father.
[1:04:58] You see, we beheld the word that was in
[1:05:00] the beginning. It become flesh on earth.
[1:05:03] What a marvelous thing to think that God
[1:05:05] made flesh to take away sin.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; God made himself flesh
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; to take away sin. And through the
[1:05:14] bloodline, hallelujah,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; it wasn't David,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; but through the bloodline, David was a
[1:05:19] type of Christ, but through the
[1:05:21] bloodline of that flesh, hallelujah,
[1:05:24] that through the bloodline of that
[1:05:25] flesh, that dynasty, that lineage, the
[1:05:28] royal blood of God, you and I have been
[1:05:30] made clean.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's why David said, listen what God
[1:05:34] said. He said, David, your house,
[1:05:36] somebody say, your house
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; will be established forever.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; That ought to make every believer shout
[1:05:41] this morning. Your house shall be
[1:05:43] established forever. Talking about
[1:05:45] Christ. Your house shall be established
[1:05:47] forever. In your kingdom, there would
[1:05:49] never be an end. It was a promise that
[1:05:51] was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. See, it
[1:05:53] was the hope of a Messiah.
[1:05:56] But just like any house, you realize
[1:05:58] that this house of David, it also had a
[1:06:00] key. It wasn't a squatter's house.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Not just anybody can dwell in the house
[1:06:06] of David. It ain't It ain't a squatter's
[1:06:08] house. It had a key. It had a locked
[1:06:10] door. It required a key. Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; See, there there's nothing in this life
[1:06:13] as satisfying as it must be. But said,
[1:06:16] "But you will find the sum of total
[1:06:18] perfection is in one place. It's in
[1:06:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; It's not in no man. It's not in no man's
[1:06:22] ministry. The only place you'll ever
[1:06:24] find perfection is in one man. It's
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ." For the Bible said, "He
[1:06:28] hath the key of David." What a beautiful
[1:06:30] phrase it is. It comes from the
[1:06:32] preceding phrase. He is true. He's
[1:06:34] Christ. He's the perfect realization.
[1:06:36] And and contrasted from a partial
[1:06:38] realization, he's the perfect
[1:06:39] realization. Here it is. Moses was a
[1:06:41] prophet of God, but Jesus, like unto
[1:06:44] Moses, was the prophet of God. David was
[1:06:46] a man after God's own heart. He was a
[1:06:48] king of Israel. But Jesus was the
[1:06:50] greater David. He was a greater Moses.
[1:06:52] He was a greater David. He was a greater
[1:06:54] than Solomon. So, see, he was a greater
[1:06:56] David. He was a king of kings. He was
[1:06:58] the Lord of Lord. He was God himself.
[1:07:01] And David, see, he was born of the tribe
[1:07:03] of Judah out of no whom no priest came,
[1:07:06] but he ate the shoeb bread reserved for
[1:07:08] priests. He was a great warrior. Think
[1:07:09] about David. He overcame his enemy,
[1:07:11] established the people. He he he set as
[1:07:14] a king upon the throne. But yet, he was
[1:07:15] a prophet. He prophesied of things. And
[1:07:18] so, he was a wonderful type of Christ.
[1:07:20] Here's what the Bible said. Isaiah 22
[1:07:22] said, "And the key of the house of David
[1:07:24] will I lay upon his shoulder." See,
[1:07:25] there's a key to this house. And it's
[1:07:28] found in in Isaiah. In the key of the
[1:07:30] house of David, I will lay upon his
[1:07:31] shoulder. So, he shall open and none
[1:07:33] shall shut. And he shall shut and none
[1:07:35] shall open. So it shows us that there's
[1:07:37] only one person that has access to open
[1:07:40] and shut the door of the house of David.
[1:07:42] There ain't but one person that can let
[1:07:43] you in or let you out. There ain't one
[1:07:45] person that can take you in or take you
[1:07:47] out. So he says, see the spirit used
[1:07:49] this Old Testament reference concerning
[1:07:51] the Lord Jesus. Now this is speaking out
[1:07:53] of the book of Revelation. John writes
[1:07:54] this how that that the key was upon his
[1:07:58] shoulder. He talked about that he held
[1:07:59] the key of the house of David. So said,
[1:08:02] see, but this is it's using the Old
[1:08:04] Testament reference. What the key of
[1:08:05] David signified at the time is just a
[1:08:07] mere shadow. It was now fulfilled in
[1:08:09] Jesus standing in the midst of the
[1:08:11] lampstands in the book of Revelation.
[1:08:13] And it's speaking of our Lord after his
[1:08:16] resurrection and not during his earthly
[1:08:18] pilgrimage. So this is very important
[1:08:20] because we're not living in the age of
[1:08:22] Jesus's earthly pilgrimage. Are you with
[1:08:24] me? We're living in the time after his
[1:08:26] resurrection. So it's speaking of a time
[1:08:28] after his resurrection, Brother David.
[1:08:30] after his resurrection. Notice he said,
[1:08:32] "What does this key signify?" Well, the
[1:08:34] answer of it lies in where the key was
[1:08:37] found. It's the position of the key. He
[1:08:39] said, "Notice the key was not found in
[1:08:41] his hand. It was not worn around his
[1:08:43] neck. It wasn't placed in the hands of
[1:08:45] other men." But or the verse or the
[1:08:46] verse couldn't say that he alone has the
[1:08:49] use of the key. For he alone opens and
[1:08:51] he alone shuts. And no man has that
[1:08:54] right but Jesus himself. Isn't that
[1:08:56] right? Jesus himself is the only one
[1:08:58] that has a right. said, "But notice, but
[1:09:00] where is the key?" It wasn't found in
[1:09:02] his hand. It wasn't in his pocket. It
[1:09:03] wasn't worn around his neck. But the
[1:09:05] Bible says, "But the key of the house of
[1:09:08] David will I lay upon his shoulder."
[1:09:10] See, see? So, isn't that an odd thing to
[1:09:12] say that the key is laying on his
[1:09:14] shoulder? Why would the key to the house
[1:09:15] of David be laying on the shoulder of
[1:09:18] one? He said, "But the answer comes in
[1:09:19] Isaiah 9:6. The answer comes from this.
[1:09:22] The government shall be upon his
[1:09:23] shoulder." Says, "What does it mean? The
[1:09:25] answer, the government shall be upon his
[1:09:27] shoulder." It comes from that eastern
[1:09:28] wedding tradition of how that the bride
[1:09:30] would come down the aisle and she was
[1:09:32] veiled when she come to the uh to the
[1:09:34] marriage ceremony. But when she came to
[1:09:36] the groom that she actually removed the
[1:09:38] veil from her face, what covered her
[1:09:40] face and she put it on the shoulder of
[1:09:42] the groom which represented her coming
[1:09:44] under headship of the groom or or being
[1:09:47] subject to the groom under under his
[1:09:49] headship. And so so this is the the
[1:09:51] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[1:09:52] He says see so this is the best part. He
[1:09:54] says, "So whenever the bride comes down
[1:09:56] to the groom, notice what takes place
[1:09:58] now. The groom bears the responsibility
[1:10:01] and the care and he and he alone." That
[1:10:04] means no one else. He and he alone. No
[1:10:06] other man, no other power has any right
[1:10:09] or responsibility to her. And that is
[1:10:12] the key of David. So here it shows that
[1:10:15] Christ, he holds the key. That means, oh
[1:10:17] hallelujah, that means God being
[1:10:19] sovereign. Brother Mark, he knew by
[1:10:20] divine decree who would be in his bride.
[1:10:23] Abraham said he chose her. She did not
[1:10:25] choose him. He called her. She did not
[1:10:27] come on her own. He died for her. He
[1:10:29] washed her in his own blood. He paid the
[1:10:31] price for her. She belongs to him and to
[1:10:33] him alone. She is wholly committed to
[1:10:36] him and he accepts the obligation
[1:10:39] because her veil has been placed upon
[1:10:41] his shoulder. The key to the house has
[1:10:44] been put upon his shoulder. In other
[1:10:45] words, I give the authority of my life
[1:10:47] over to Jesus Christ. I GIVE MY CHOICES
[1:10:50] AND MY THOUGHTS and my FEELINGS AND ALL
[1:10:52] MY ALL ALL MY PLANS. I PUT THEM ON THE
[1:10:55] SHOULDER OF JESUS CHRIST. HE SAID he is
[1:10:57] her head. For Christ is the head of the
[1:10:59] church. Just like Sarah called Abraham
[1:11:01] Lord. Even so the bride is happy that he
[1:11:04] is her Lord and when he speaks she obeys
[1:11:07] him for he is her delight.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; He holds the key to the house of David.
[1:11:13] Somebody say amen. He reigns in the
[1:11:15] house of David. Somebody say amen. He
[1:11:17] holds the key. It's the authority of the
[1:11:20] house.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; No man can enter in or go out without
[1:11:24] him.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; It's he that holds the key. No wonder
[1:11:27] David says, "Surely, listen what he
[1:11:28] says. Surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:11:30] follow me all the days of my life, and I
[1:11:33] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:11:36] forever." Do you realize that David
[1:11:37] wasn't wasn't speaking about a certain
[1:11:39] building.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; I will dwell in the house of the Lord.
[1:11:42] He was born in Bethlehem. He lived in in
[1:11:44] the caves. He lived in the wilderness of
[1:11:46] Judah, in Gath, and in Getty. He went he
[1:11:49] he he lived in the the the the
[1:11:51] wilderness of Ze. He he went to the city
[1:11:53] of Keela. Remember where the Philistines
[1:11:55] came in and he defended the people of
[1:11:57] the city just for a few months while he
[1:11:59] lived there. He lived in Hebron. He was
[1:12:00] actually anointed in Hebron to be king
[1:12:03] over Israel. But but that was his his
[1:12:05] public anointing. But but also he lived
[1:12:07] in Jerusalem. That's where he became
[1:12:09] king. And that's where he established
[1:12:10] his throne and his kingdom. It's called
[1:12:12] the city of David or the city the city
[1:12:14] of God. He he took the the city over and
[1:12:16] established that as the as as the
[1:12:18] kingdom of Israel. And so we realize
[1:12:20] that in David's life that I just want to
[1:12:22] focus on these three main places just
[1:12:24] for a minute. In David's life, there was
[1:12:26] three places that he spent the majority
[1:12:28] of his life. One, he spent his life in
[1:12:30] Bethlehem. He lived in the wilderness
[1:12:32] where he slept in caves. And then
[1:12:34] finally, he lived in Jerusalem. These
[1:12:36] are the three main places that David
[1:12:38] lived. And so, you know, you think about
[1:12:39] how that he was born, David's
[1:12:41] birthplace. He was born in Bethlehem.
[1:12:43] And in Bethlehem, David was a shepherd.
[1:12:45] See, he was a in Bethlehem he got his
[1:12:48] training. That it was in Bethlehem that
[1:12:50] David learned courage. It was in
[1:12:51] Bethlehem that he learned how to use a
[1:12:53] sling. Isn't that right? In Bethlehem,
[1:12:55] David learned how to to to shepherd a
[1:12:57] flock. In Bethlehem, he had some
[1:12:59] training. In Bethlehem, he was even
[1:13:01] anointed by the prophet Samuel to be
[1:13:03] king. Remember, that was his private
[1:13:04] anointing. Oh, I think isn't it
[1:13:07] something here that he was anointed
[1:13:08] there? All these things took place in
[1:13:10] the city of Bethlehem. But then one day
[1:13:12] in David's life, and you realize, I want
[1:13:14] you to catch the spiritual side of this,
[1:13:16] that you realize that although he was
[1:13:18] raised in Bethlehem, hello, somebody, he
[1:13:20] was raised in Bethlehem, he grew up in
[1:13:22] Bethlehem, he had his training in
[1:13:24] Bethlehem, he knew how to learn how to
[1:13:25] read his Bible in Bethlehem, he learned
[1:13:27] how to go to Sunday school in Bethlehem.
[1:13:29] He learned he learned how to sing in
[1:13:30] Bethlehem, he learned a in Bethlehem, he
[1:13:33] learned he learned how to read uh to
[1:13:34] quote the scripture in Bethlehem. HE
[1:13:36] LEARNED ALL OF THOSE things in
[1:13:37] Bethlehem. But there came a time in
[1:13:39] David's life that he couldn't just stay
[1:13:41] in Bethlehem. He had to go somewhere
[1:13:43] else. There had had to be another place
[1:13:45] that David went into. And I'll just say
[1:13:46] this tonight that the real battle didn't
[1:13:48] even take place in Bethlehem. Hello,
[1:13:50] somebody. The real battle don't play
[1:13:52] take place in Bethlehem. It ain't taking
[1:13:54] place here. It took place after he went
[1:13:56] out of Bethlehem and went out into the
[1:13:58] wilderness and he found out when he got
[1:14:00] there that his Bethlehem training, it
[1:14:02] was good. But you realize that
[1:14:04] spiritually Bethlehem wasn't enough. He
[1:14:06] had to have something that would give
[1:14:07] him a victory. But remember said it gave
[1:14:09] him a great victory one day when he seen
[1:14:11] Israel all backed up. He they were
[1:14:13] hearing these creeds and everything.
[1:14:16] They had all that they they all went to
[1:14:18] church. They had all been circumcised.
[1:14:20] Hello, somebody. I'm preaching to you.
[1:14:22] They all had creeds. They all went to
[1:14:24] church. They were all baptized. They
[1:14:26] were all circumcised. They were they all
[1:14:28] went to the priest and they got their
[1:14:29] blessing before they went into battle.
[1:14:31] But when it come to the showdown of the
[1:14:33] supernatural, every one of them were
[1:14:36] cowards because they seen something that
[1:14:38] was in opposition. You know what I found
[1:14:41] out today? It's easy to be a warrior
[1:14:43] when there ain't nobody to fight. Hello,
[1:14:45] somebody.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I said it's easy to be a fighter when
[1:14:48] there ain't nobody to fight. It's easy
[1:14:50] to be big and bad in front of a mirror.
[1:14:52] It's easy to flex in front of a mirror
[1:14:53] and look at her muscle. I think that's
[1:14:55] the way it is when people come to dad
[1:14:56] that's had the same blessing but in the
[1:14:58] middle of the battle they met an
[1:15:00] opposition AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT
[1:15:02] TAKES TO STAND BEFORE THE GOLIATH. I
[1:15:04] WONDER HOW many today they can stand
[1:15:06] before the Goliath in THEIR LIFE WHEN
[1:15:08] THEY MEET HIM ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE
[1:15:09] CHURCH BUILDING.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; It takes more than that kind of exper
[1:15:13] that kind of experience.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; See sometimes when you get out you got
[1:15:16] to get outside the walls of the church.
[1:15:18] That's
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes when you get out you got
[1:15:21] to get outside the walls of the church.
[1:15:22] That's when the devil tempts you. That's
[1:15:24] I love to come to church. It builds our
[1:15:26] faith. But then you got to get outside
[1:15:28] the walls of the church. Call us to be
[1:15:30] church members. He called us to be
[1:15:32] believers.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So here this event that takes place in
[1:15:37] David's life. It was outside of
[1:15:39] Bethlehem.
[1:15:41] David, you think about here he would
[1:15:42] come he come to this place. You think of
[1:15:45] after David he was anointed to be king
[1:15:47] by Samuel
[1:15:49] and because of this great battle after
[1:15:52] he done them this huge favor then he was
[1:15:55] hunted by the king that he was serving.
[1:15:58] Remember the story he feared David
[1:16:00] because David was a threat to his
[1:16:03] monarchy. He he would be replaced by
[1:16:04] David. He he could hear him in the
[1:16:06] streets dancing and singing. Saul has
[1:16:08] killed his thousands but David killed
[1:16:09] his tens of thousands. And there was
[1:16:12] such a jealousy in Saul because of the
[1:16:14] anointing that was on David. And so he
[1:16:17] attacked him and he he went after him
[1:16:19] and he run him out and chased him out.
[1:16:22] And but because uh this anointing and
[1:16:24] this jealousy, he threatened him. He
[1:16:25] pursued him. And so he hid David, he hid
[1:16:28] from Saul. He fought the armies of the
[1:16:30] Philistines. He went out as a refuge. He
[1:16:33] he would hide out in the wilderness. But
[1:16:35] here when he was trying to survive and
[1:16:37] coming to a place of survival, he was
[1:16:38] doing everything were they were looking
[1:16:40] for a refuge of their own. The Bible
[1:16:41] says when they came to David, these were
[1:16:43] people were they were looking for a
[1:16:44] refuge of their own. The Bible says when
[1:16:46] they came to David, these were people
[1:16:47] that had been abused. They had been
[1:16:49] broken. They were bitter. They came
[1:16:51] through some that had been abused. They
[1:16:53] had been broken. They were bitter. They
[1:16:55] came through some problems. They they
[1:16:57] had problems with people. They had
[1:16:58] problems with leaders. They had problems
[1:17:00] with religious leaders and spiritual
[1:17:01] brokenness for purpose. They traded
[1:17:03] their shame for an authority.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And in a place of brokenness, they were
[1:17:09] transformed into real men of God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; This is where they found David. And in
[1:17:16] this same place, David, brother Mark, he
[1:17:18] was transformed to not only not only
[1:17:21] being anointed by Samuel or not only
[1:17:24] being a leader of sheep, but David was
[1:17:26] transformed into being a leader of men.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He was transformed in the cave of
[1:17:31] Adelum. This was the another training
[1:17:33] ground in his life. It was a a place
[1:17:35] that broke. Isn't that something that we
[1:17:36] may have been raised up in one place and
[1:17:38] we got a lot of training in there, but
[1:17:39] then David goes out in the wilderness.
[1:17:41] They call it the school of hard knocks
[1:17:42] in 2025. But David goes out in the
[1:17:44] wilderness and he gets beat up a little
[1:17:46] bit and he finds himself in a refuge
[1:17:48] seeking God. And in that refuge, David
[1:17:50] became a real leader and a king and a
[1:17:53] captain over men. The Bible says as he
[1:17:55] was there in this cave of Adelum that
[1:17:58] David was then in a hold. The garrison
[1:18:00] of the Philistines was all in Bethlehem.
[1:18:03] And here David was up in this cave
[1:18:05] overlooking his homeland of Bethlehem
[1:18:07] where he grew up, where he was raised,
[1:18:10] his mom and daddy was, and the streets
[1:18:12] that he ran down when he was a little
[1:18:13] boy. And David as he set up in that
[1:18:16] place, the Bible says, David said, "Oh,
[1:18:19] that one would give me a drink of the
[1:18:20] water of the well of Bethlehem, which is
[1:18:23] by the gate." See, there was a longing
[1:18:26] in David's heart as he sat there in the
[1:18:28] heat of this wilderness, in the heat of
[1:18:31] battle, in the refuge, a hiding place.
[1:18:33] They were scrging what they could for
[1:18:35] food, drinking what they could out of
[1:18:37] some old nasty bottles or something just
[1:18:40] to drink out of. is sitting there that
[1:18:42] David is is in this place and looking
[1:18:44] out of this cave of this wilderness and
[1:18:46] overlooking down in in Bethlehem and
[1:18:49] thinking, "Oh, if I could just get back
[1:18:50] to their cave, that my soul thirsts
[1:18:52] after thee." As a deer panth for the
[1:18:54] water, after the waterbrook, so does my
[1:18:56] soul thirst after thee. He cried. He was
[1:18:58] a fugitive. He had been anointed with
[1:19:00] oil. He knew he was GOING TO BE KING.
[1:19:02] THE PROPHET HAD ANOINTED HIM. BUT here
[1:19:04] in his soldiers, they were setting up
[1:19:05] there on top of this mountain. And they
[1:19:08] and be because of their sin, they were
[1:19:10] they were garrisoned by Philistines. But
[1:19:11] on that hot day, he began to write the
[1:19:14] my soul longeth for water as a deer
[1:19:16] panth for the water. In his condition,
[1:19:19] he would think about how when he was a
[1:19:20] little boy and he would come to that
[1:19:22] certain pool and all of a sudden as he
[1:19:24] was there laying up there a fugitive
[1:19:26] away from his own people, he had no
[1:19:28] PLACE TO GO AND HIS SOUL be to cry out
[1:19:30] for some of that pure water.
[1:19:33] And you know what the Bible says that
[1:19:34] some of the men, some of the servants of
[1:19:36] David that came there as cowards, came
[1:19:39] there as refugees, came there as
[1:19:41] fugitives, came there fleeing from the
[1:19:42] law and freeing from men, but but they
[1:19:45] had so became followers of David. They
[1:19:48] they had so became the followers of the
[1:19:50] anointing that David had. They they were
[1:19:52] so under that anointing that even the
[1:19:54] desire of David's heart became a command
[1:19:57] to them. David didn't have to tell him,
[1:19:59] "Go down there and get me water." He
[1:20:01] said, "Oh, if I could just have a drink
[1:20:03] of the water that's down in Bethlehem."
[1:20:05] And there was three men, the Bible says,
[1:20:07] that stood up that was of the servants
[1:20:09] of David and said, "We'll have to no
[1:20:10] matter who we have to fight on the way
[1:20:12] down and on the way back. Where's that
[1:20:14] well at?" He said it was over by the
[1:20:15] gate. Well, friends, let's go. You know
[1:20:17] what they did? They grabbed up their
[1:20:18] swords. And the Bible says they fought
[1:20:20] Philistines all the way down to the city
[1:20:22] of Bethlehem. And they went to the pool
[1:20:24] of water and they got some water for
[1:20:26] David. And they fought Philistines all
[1:20:28] the way back till they came to the cave
[1:20:30] of Adelum. And they presented their king
[1:20:32] or their future king with with a water
[1:20:35] that came from Bethlehem to fulfill the
[1:20:37] desire of his thirst or the longing that
[1:20:40] was in his heart.
[1:20:42] But when they got the water back, think
[1:20:45] about it. But when they got the water
[1:20:46] back, you know what David did with it?
[1:20:49] When they gave it to him here, he
[1:20:51] finally held that water. He looked at it
[1:20:54] how thirsty that he was and how long did
[1:20:56] he long for it and he come out of
[1:20:58] Bethlehem and they had fought their way
[1:21:00] spilled blood going down to get it. He
[1:21:02] looked at the water and he looked at the
[1:21:04] men and he looked at the blood and David
[1:21:06] couldn't bring himself to do it and so
[1:21:08] he just turned the glass to the ground
[1:21:11] and he dumped it upon the ground. Said,
[1:21:14] "God, how could I drink of this? How
[1:21:17] could I satisfy that?" But says, "See,
[1:21:19] he wouldn't even drink it. He poured it
[1:21:20] on the ground." He said because his soul
[1:21:23] was more thirsty for God than it was to
[1:21:26] satisfy the thirst of his own body.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; He couldn't drink it. His men couldn't.
[1:21:31] There wasn't enough for them. There
[1:21:32] wasn't enough for the next one. There
[1:21:33] wasn't enough for the next one. And
[1:21:35] David said, "I won't drink it in front
[1:21:36] of them. How be it that blood was spit
[1:21:38] spilled over it." But Ram said, "See,
[1:21:40] his soul is so long for something
[1:21:42] greater than the waters of Bethlehem."
[1:21:44] He says, "See the house of God, the soul
[1:21:47] cooling waters of Jerusalem which is
[1:21:49] above." That's what Jesus said. He said,
[1:21:51] "I am the bread of life. I am the I I am
[1:21:54] the bread of life." Is that you know
[1:21:55] what Bethlehem means, brother Mark?
[1:21:57] Bethlehem means the house of God's
[1:21:59] bread. But Ram said, "It's our church.
[1:22:01] It's our earthly church of God. It's the
[1:22:04] church that's here on earth." That's
[1:22:06] what Bethlehem is. It's the church that
[1:22:08] we go to. It's the church that's on
[1:22:10] earth. He said, "And oh, how we love to
[1:22:12] go to church here on earth. But greater
[1:22:14] is Jerusalem, which is above, which is
[1:22:17] God. Jerusalem above, which is God.
[1:22:20] Greater is that soul's thirst to be
[1:22:22] there with him than it would be just to
[1:22:24] satisfy yourself with joining a church
[1:22:27] somewhere. See, joining a church don't
[1:22:29] satisfy that thirst. David proved it
[1:22:31] there. Bethlehem wasn't enough to
[1:22:33] satisfy the thirst or the longing that
[1:22:35] was in David's soul. So, Bethlehem was
[1:22:37] type of the church and Jerusalem was a
[1:22:40] type of the supernatural or this place
[1:22:42] with God. He said, "And Bethlehem wasn't
[1:22:44] enough to satisfy his thirst because his
[1:22:46] so long TO GET TO JERUSALEM. IT'S SO
[1:22:49] LONG FOR SOMETHING GREATER. SO, SEE,
[1:22:51] David proved it when he poured the
[1:22:53] waters right out of the house of God. HE
[1:22:56] GOT THE WATERS OUT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD,
[1:22:58] BUT HE STILL YET HE poured it on the
[1:23:00] ground. And he said to find favor, to
[1:23:02] get a good cool drink from God. He said
[1:23:05] even on that, greater than the thirst
[1:23:08] that's in you is the soul thirst for
[1:23:11] God. Oh friends, I wonder how many are
[1:23:13] like David this morning and say, "Oh, I
[1:23:16] our thirst goes beyond my desire to go
[1:23:18] to church." My thirst goes beyond my
[1:23:21] desire to be a member of a church. My
[1:23:23] thirst goes beyond. Friends, I we
[1:23:25] believe in going to church. I believe in
[1:23:27] going to church, but brother said there
[1:23:28] ain't but one real church. And you don't
[1:23:30] join it. You're born into it. And you're
[1:23:32] born into it. The living God works
[1:23:34] itself through you. He makes itself
[1:23:36] known. That's where God dwells in his
[1:23:39] church because God goes to church every
[1:23:42] day. He just lives in church. He lives
[1:23:45] in you. You are his church.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS CHURCH.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle that God dwells
[1:23:52] in. You're the church of the living God
[1:23:54] yourself. Somebody raise your hand.
[1:23:56] Everybody raise your hand. Everybody
[1:23:57] raise your hand. Everybody, come on. Put
[1:23:58] your hand up. You. I'm talking about
[1:24:00] you. You are the tabernacle that God
[1:24:03] dwells in. YOU ARE HIS CHURCH. IT AIN'T
[1:24:05] A BUILDING SOMEWHERE. IT WASN'T A HOUSE
[1:24:07] OF CEDAR. GOD NEVER GOD SAID TO DAVID,
[1:24:09] "NEVER HAVE I ASKED YOU FOR A HOUSE OF
[1:24:11] CEDAR. NEVER HAVE I ASKED YOU TO BUILD
[1:24:13] ME A PLACE LIKE THAT TO DWELL IN. BUT I
[1:24:15] SHALL ESTABLISH A HOUSE THAT'LL NEVER BE
[1:24:18] THAT'LL never be torn DOWN." OH, YOU
[1:24:20] KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF THE HOUSE OF
[1:24:22] DAVID WILL STAND, AND YOU'RE THE CHURCH
[1:24:24] OF THE LIVING GOD, THEN IT DON'T MATTER
[1:24:25] WHAT THE devil does, HE CAN DESTROY YOU.
[1:24:28] HE CAN TEAR YOU DOWN. HE CAN TAKE YOUR
[1:24:30] LIFE, BUT HE'LL NEVER DESTROY THE
[1:24:31] TABERNACLE THAT GOD HAS BUILT.
[1:24:35] We ain't looking for a building with
[1:24:36] four walls to say that's my home. That
[1:24:39] may be where we come to fellowship and
[1:24:41] we ought to go to church. The Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] goes to church. But there's a real
[1:24:44] church. He said you are the church.
[1:24:46] You're the tabernacle that God dwells
[1:24:48] in. And if you are the church of the
[1:24:50] living God yourself and if the living
[1:24:52] God is living in you, then your action
[1:24:54] is of God. And if it isn't, then God
[1:24:56] isn't in there.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Real simple. See, David, I'm gonna
[1:25:02] close.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; There's more to serving God than going
[1:25:07] to church.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You know why people have trouble serving
[1:25:10] God? Can I just I'm going to just be
[1:25:11] honest with you. Because your service to
[1:25:14] God never got past going to church.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Your service to God never got past a
[1:25:18] struggling out of bed on a Sunday
[1:25:19] morning and struggling out on Wednesday
[1:25:21] night. People don't even do that no
[1:25:22] more. But struggle out of bed just to go
[1:25:24] to the house of God. That's the
[1:25:25] struggle. Then we go to church and go
[1:25:27] back and do all the all all the stuff
[1:25:29] that we have to do to work. But your
[1:25:30] service to GOD NEVER GOT PAST going to
[1:25:32] church. I'm a church member. I go to so
[1:25:34] and so church. I I belong to this one. I
[1:25:37] Everybody I go
[1:25:39] your your your service to God
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; has to get beyond
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; going to church.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; That ain't enough.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Can I be honest? It ain't enough.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; It ain't enough. You have to meet God
[1:25:51] one day. And when you meet God, there's
[1:25:53] not a book of how many services you
[1:25:55] attended.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost goes to church. When
[1:25:59] the church door's open, you ought to be
[1:26:01] there.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Everything in your power. You see, if
[1:26:03] you got to work under I understand
[1:26:04] sometimes, but we but we we want to go
[1:26:06] to church. We have a desire to go to
[1:26:08] church. But it ain't just to be in
[1:26:09] church.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; It ain't just to be in the building.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Our service to God is more than going to
[1:26:15] church. All kinds of people go to
[1:26:17] church. That don't make you a Christian.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Even if you go to our church, that don't
[1:26:23] make you a Christian.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That don't make you a believer.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Just because you come to church, that
[1:26:27] don't make you a believer. Well, look
[1:26:28] how good he's going to church. Good.
[1:26:30] He's He's head. Oh. Oh, glory help me.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. He's going to church
[1:26:36] now. Look at him. He's going to church.
[1:26:37] I'm going to preach that old
[1:26:38] Pentecostals message I I heard one time
[1:26:40] stopping by the church on the way to
[1:26:42] hell.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; See, there's a lot of people in church
[1:26:44] that are unconverted.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're churchgoers, but
[1:26:48] they're not converts.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; There's more to serving God than going
[1:26:51] to church.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; See, David had to go beyond Bethlehem.
[1:26:57] Jesus, he was born in a manger in
[1:26:59] Bethlehem.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; But Jesus had to go beyond Bethlehem.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; And every true believer, they'll go
[1:27:04] beyond a Bethlehem experience.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; You can't just stay in a Bethlehem. You
[1:27:09] can't just stay in a a Bethlehem
[1:27:10] experience. But brother Mark, you have
[1:27:12] to move into a Jerusalem experience.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; See, if Jesus would have remained in
[1:27:15] Bethlehem, you know what would have
[1:27:16] happened? The Bible said that Herod
[1:27:18] found out he was there because they
[1:27:19] followed the star there. and they found
[1:27:21] out he was there and he sent men there
[1:27:23] to take the life of every boy that was
[1:27:25] about that age so that he could make
[1:27:26] sure he died. If Jesus would just
[1:27:28] remained in in Bethlehem, he would have
[1:27:30] died at two years old.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; If David WOULD REMAINED AT BETHLEHEM, HE
[1:27:34] WOULD HAVE DIED AND HAD NEVER BEEN A
[1:27:36] KING. I don't care how anointed he was.
[1:27:37] HE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN A KING IF HE
[1:27:39] NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT BETHLEHEM.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He had to get past the Bethlehem
[1:27:42] experience and move into a Jerusalem
[1:27:44] experience. He had HE HAD TO GO BEYOND
[1:27:47] BETHLEHEM. WELL, FRIENDS, let me tell
[1:27:48] you, we can we can go to church, and we
[1:27:50] should go to church. And you need a
[1:27:52] Bethlehem, but Jesus wouldn't be Jesus
[1:27:54] wouldn't be Jesus without Bethlehem. HE
[1:27:56] HAD TO HAVE IT. YOU WOULDN'T BE A REAL
[1:27:57] CHRISTIAN WITHOUT YOUR BETHLEHEM. YOU
[1:27:59] HAVE TO HAVE IT.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU TO THIS PLACE. And Jesus
[1:28:02] wouldn't be in Bethlehem. He He was born
[1:28:05] there in a manger. That's where the star
[1:28:06] sent the magi. They brought the gifts
[1:28:08] unto him of gold and frankincense and
[1:28:11] myrr. remember gold which meant deity,
[1:28:13] frankincense uh which meant service and
[1:28:16] myrrh which was a type of death and so
[1:28:18] said what was it? It was a deity in
[1:28:21] service for death. It was God serving
[1:28:23] for the purpose of dying. So there was a
[1:28:25] purpose of Jesus being in Bethlehem.
[1:28:27] There was a there was a purpose of
[1:28:29] David. David wouldn't be David without
[1:28:31] Bethlehem. Don't you realize that he had
[1:28:33] to have Bethlehem? It was in Bethlehem
[1:28:35] that he that he killed a lion. It was in
[1:28:37] Bethlehem that he killed a bear. It was
[1:28:39] in Bethlehem that day that that that
[1:28:41] David learned h how to be a king. He had
[1:28:44] to HAVE THAT THAT PLACE OF BETHLEHEM. IT
[1:28:46] WAS IN BETHLEHEM THAT he met the prophet
[1:28:48] Samuel.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; But it was in Jerusalem that David
[1:28:51] reigned as king. It was in Jerusalem
[1:28:54] that Christ reigns as king. The Bible
[1:28:56] said, "There's coming a new Jerusalem."
[1:28:57] Isn't that what John said? He said, "I
[1:28:59] saw a new heaven and a new earth. For
[1:29:02] the first heaven and the first earth
[1:29:03] were passed away, and there was no more
[1:29:05] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the
[1:29:08] new Jerusalem, coming down from God, out
[1:29:10] of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned
[1:29:12] for her husband. And I heard a great
[1:29:14] voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold,
[1:29:16] the tabernacle of God is with men, and
[1:29:20] he will dwell with them, AND THEY SHALL
[1:29:22] BE HIS PEOPLE, AND GOD HIMSELF SHALL BE
[1:29:24] WITH THEM, AND HE WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND
[1:29:26] HE WILL WIPE AWAY all the tears from
[1:29:28] their eyes, and there shall be no more
[1:29:30] death, neither sorrow, NOR CRYING,
[1:29:33] NEITHER SHALL THERE BE ANY MORE PAIN.
[1:29:35] FOR THE FORMER THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; OH, can I just TELL YOU THIS, FRIENDS?
[1:29:41] WHEN BETHLEHEM IS GONE, JERUSALEM STILL
[1:29:44] REMAINS.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; You got TO GET PAST THE BETHLEHEM
[1:29:47] EXPERIENCE AND MOVE INTO A JERUSALEM
[1:29:49] EXPERIENCE. BETHLEHEM IS TEMPORARY, BUT
[1:29:51] JERUSALEM IS FOREVER. IT'S THE HOUSE OF
[1:29:54] DAVID. IT'S THE HOUSE OF GOD. IT'S A
[1:29:56] SPIRITUAL PLACE. YOU CAN BE WITH GOD.
[1:29:58] YOU GOT TO GET BEYOND YOUR BETHLEHEM
[1:30:00] experience and have a Jerusalem
[1:30:02] experience, a heavenly walk, a
[1:30:04] supernatural life.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Right in the middle of
[1:30:08] our Bethlehem, a Jerusalem is open unto
[1:30:12] us.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And what a thought this morning that
[1:30:15] here we are gathered in our Bethlehem.
[1:30:17] But it's in our Bethlehem that Jerusalem
[1:30:19] opens up.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; The one that holds the key, the right,
[1:30:22] we come into the house of God, into the
[1:30:24] house of God's breath. That's what this
[1:30:26] church is. You come into the house of
[1:30:28] God, but but it's Jerusalem that is
[1:30:30] opened up
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; by the one that has the key. See, what
[1:30:33] is he doing? Abraham said, "We bypassed
[1:30:35] on creeds and drinking stagnated water
[1:30:38] from sistns. But what we need today is
[1:30:40] an opening of the word that lives." What
[1:30:42] is it? Oh, opening up a a new Jerusalem.
[1:30:45] Opening of a word that lives. He's the
[1:30:46] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[1:30:48] cannot fail. It don't matter what the
[1:30:50] devil calls it.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; We need a supernatural experience.
[1:30:55] It ain't a It's more than church
[1:30:57] services. It's a supernatural
[1:30:59] experience. You realize there's a whole
[1:31:01] world of people that are Christians this
[1:31:03] week.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; It's a bunch.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; They're Christians this week because
[1:31:07] it's the birth date of Jesus.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; They're all Christians to celebrate
[1:31:12] Jesus's birthday. What a wonderful time.
[1:31:14] And I think that's the greatest birthday
[1:31:16] of any birthday of any man ever had. And
[1:31:18] if you're going to celebrate anybody's
[1:31:20] birthday, that's the birthday you should
[1:31:21] celebrate because it was the greatest
[1:31:23] birth that's ever been on the earth.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; That's the birth that we should
[1:31:26] celebrate. But people are so
[1:31:30] they're so they're so stuck in Bethlehem
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; that that's their Christian experience.
[1:31:36] They can't get past Bethlehem. That's
[1:31:39] the whole of their Christian experience.
[1:31:42] But we really need to move. We got to
[1:31:44] move beyond
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Bethlehem.
[1:31:48] and take on this Jerusalem.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; You see, they don't, the world calls it
[1:31:53] a lot of things. They call you holy
[1:31:54] rulers.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; They call us Pentecostal.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; They call it fanaticism.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; As long as the word's flowing free and
[1:32:01] producing what God said it would do,
[1:32:03] then I'm behind it.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "It's a fountain in the
[1:32:06] house of David again as the music
[1:32:08] players want to come." He said it's a
[1:32:10] fountain in the house of David again
[1:32:11] back in Bethlehem where that Jesus
[1:32:14] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:32:15] forever to his Bethlehem dwellers live
[1:32:18] with it. They live in it. It's life
[1:32:21] jouring water for us just like Israel
[1:32:23] had. That makes you feel like David,
[1:32:26] don't it?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:32:29] me all the days of my life. And I will
[1:32:32] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1:32:37] I wonder how many could raise your hand
[1:32:39] as you stand to your feet this morning.
[1:32:42] Say, "I'm not just a dweller of
[1:32:44] Bethlehem.
[1:32:46] I'm not just a churchgoer.
[1:32:48] But I believe in the supernatural power
[1:32:51] of God working in the church.
[1:32:55] I'm not stuck in Bethlehem, although
[1:32:57] it's good. Bethlehem's needed.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; But I'm not just a Bethlehem dweller.
[1:33:03] But I've moved into another place.
[1:33:07] When that Jerusalem's opened up, that
[1:33:09] it's the place of deity. It's the place
[1:33:11] of of reigning, of kingship. John said,
[1:33:14] "I saw it as a bride adorned for her
[1:33:18] husband coming down." See, so not only
[1:33:21] will he reign there, but she'll reign
[1:33:23] there also.
[1:33:25] My isn't it wonderful to think?
[1:33:27] I believe that I believe that the house
[1:33:30] of God is more than a a Bethlehem
[1:33:33] experience. I hope you catch that this
[1:33:35] morning. I'm not knocking anything. But
[1:33:39] I believe it ought to be more than just
[1:33:40] a a churchgoing experience. I believe
[1:33:43] that being a Christian ought to be more
[1:33:45] than an Easter and Christmas.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I believe that serving God ought to be
[1:33:48] more than coming to church on Sunday and
[1:33:50] Wednesday.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And I believe the house of God still has
[1:33:54] a Jerusalem.
[1:33:56] that still has forgiveness in the house
[1:33:59] of God. There's still mercy in the house
[1:34:02] of God. There's still healing in the
[1:34:04] house of God. There's still deliverance
[1:34:06] in the house of God because Jerusalem
[1:34:09] has been opened up
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; unto us.
[1:34:14] He said, "In the house of David, in that
[1:34:15] day there shall be a well of water
[1:34:18] springing up in the house of David."
[1:34:21] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:34:26] Oh, there [singing] is [music] a
[1:34:29] fountain
[1:34:33] with blood
[1:34:35] flows from
[1:34:37] Emmanuel's
[1:34:39] face.
[1:34:43] Where sinners
[1:34:45] plunch
[1:34:46] beneath [music]
[1:34:48] the flood,
[1:34:50] lose all [singing]
[1:34:52] their guilty [music] stains.
[1:34:58] Lose all
[1:35:00] their guily
[1:35:02] stains.
[1:35:06] Lose all [singing]
[1:35:08] their guily
[1:35:10] stains.
[1:35:13] And sers
[1:35:16] plunged beneath [music]
[1:35:19] the flood.
[1:35:28] The [music] dying
[1:35:31] thief
[1:35:32] rejoice
[1:35:34] to see
[1:35:36] that fountain
[1:35:38] [singing and music] in his day.
[1:35:43] And there
[1:35:45] may [singing and music] I
[1:35:47] vless
[1:35:49] he wash all
[1:35:53] wash all my [music] sins [singing]
[1:35:56] away as he wash all my sins [singing]
[1:36:03] away.
[1:36:07] Dear dying
[1:36:09] [singing] lamb, thy preious
[1:36:12] blood
[1:36:14] shall never amen never lose its power
[1:36:20] until all [singing]
[1:36:23] [music] the ransom
[1:36:25] church of God are saved to sin no more.
[1:36:34] [music and singing]
[1:36:35] are saved to sin [music] no more.
[1:36:42] [singing] Are saved to sin no more.
[1:36:49] Until all the [singing] ransom,
[1:36:54] church
[1:36:56] of God are saved to sin no more.
[1:37:03] I know there is a field with blood drawn
[1:37:09] from
[1:37:11] Emmanuel's
[1:37:13] veins.
[1:37:15] Or where sinners
[1:37:18] plunge
[1:37:20] beneath [singing and music]
[1:37:21] the flood,
[1:37:23] lose all their guilty [singing] stay.

[1:37:34] stains.

[1:37:41] stains.

[1:37:52] lose all their [singing] guilty.
[1:37:58] I love you.
[1:38:04] I
[1:38:06] I love you, [singing] Lord,
[1:38:10] for your mercy never fails me. [singing]
[1:38:15] In all my days, [music] I've been held
[1:38:19] in your hand.
[1:38:22] From the moment that I wake up
[1:38:26] till [music] I lay down my head, I will
