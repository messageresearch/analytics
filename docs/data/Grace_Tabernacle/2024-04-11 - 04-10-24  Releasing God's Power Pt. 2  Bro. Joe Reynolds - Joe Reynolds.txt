things so just be remember them in prayer as they're gone and that they uh will surely get a blessing and some um some relaxing amen Psalms 92 verse1 it says it is good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto his name all the most high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness in every night upon an instrument of 10 strings Upon A suy upon a harp a s sound for thou Lord has made me glad through thy work and I will Triumph in the work of thy hands oh Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep can you say Amen to that he said a rsh man knoweth not neither do a fool understand this when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish is the it is that that they shall be destroyed forever but thou Lord oh most high forever more for though thy enemies oh lord for though thy enemies Shall Perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered but my horn shalt thou exalt like the Horn of a unicorn in other words a power or the strength is is is what David is speaking of I shall be Anointed with fresh oil something that's not dead bur but something that's alive and never present my eye also shall see my desire on my enemies and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me thy righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a a cedar in Lebanon those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of her God they shall still bring forth fruit in old age there shall be fat and flourishing amen I found my position to show that the Lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him can you say amen amen God bless you let just bow our hearts one more time tonight and just just pray for one another tonight and pray that the Lord would come and minister to our needs tonight Lord Jesus we come to your throne of mercy and Grace one more time father Lord we've read your precious word tonight Lord and we're looking for the Holy Spirit now to come and minister to our hearts Lord only you can do things for us tonight Lord God that that that can take away the sorrow replace it with joy Lord take

now the author and the finisher of our faith in Jesus Christ's name amen God few months back I was preaching I took several Services out of Psalms 92:13 and I was uh ministering on those that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of their God that that if you're planted in the courts or the house of the Lord that you're going to flourish you're going to achieve you're going to fly you're going to grow you're going to you're going to be an overcomer you're going to conquer it's not because of who I am it's all about his grace and mercy it's who he is th this evening and and I believe that's what David was telling us in Psalms 92 Thou Art my th are that th Are My Strength th are my help thou are my power Thou Art my strength thou are my everpresent help in the time of trouble lord I can't do anything without you holding my hand amen and and when the enemy comes in like a flood Lord you're always there you're an everpresent help in a time of of trouble and need you're my shepherd you're my shield you're my buckler amen David goes through if we had time to go through the book of Psalms tonight we find out that one thing about David brother Joe had confidence in his God he knew he could fail he knew he could make mistakes he knew the enemy was coming in they was after his life but he trusted in the Lord oh God he said in in another place he said you know a thousand may fall at this side 10,000 at this side but it but it cannot come nigh unto me why because he said he's my shield he's my buckler he's my he's my uh High Tower and the righteous r in it are safe he been he knew without God he was helpless but he also knew With God all things are possible with God he's Victorious with God he's an overcomer Hallelujah so listen there's nothing more powerful than God ruling and reigning in humanity Amen brother B says in one place he said you know it's not atomic bombs it's not not a uh uh uh nuclear warheads or he said but it's a believer in contact with her maker amen do you believe that he's living he's ruling he's reigning in humanity amen we are the inhabitation of allmighty God let that sink down into your hearts tonight we are not just a second cousin but we are the very habitation of almighty God know you not that you are the Temple of a living God not a dead God but a living God we're not waiting uh sister Martha we're not waiting on it to come way out there heyen we're not waiting on brother Brandon to return back with the tent I tell you tonight you are the habitation you are the tent of allmighty God you are his Dwelling Place you are his hands you are his feet you are his heartbeat oh I love him it's just like fire shut up in my bones brother being it's a it's a fire it's unquenchable fire brother being that God L and nobody no powers no no churches no religion brother Caleb could ever blow it out it's a bubbling how many feels a bubbling in your spirit it's a bubbling and brother BR would tell us about that well amen that why are you so happy why are you excited why are you bubbling he said well it's something down inside of me when I'm down it's a bubbling Heen when I'm discourage brother Benji it's a bubbling no hell no demon no church Cann cannot stop the bubbling that's within us he that begun a good work in you is the going to bring it to an endend amen you that's planted in the house of God you know how to release God's power sister Joyce is be planted in the house of our God hallelujah amen it's a bubblin it's a bubbling brother Brown said in the Masterpiece he said that the the the Old Testament and the New Testament was was husband and wife he said then Jesus has fulfilled everything of the old he said the bride's going to fulfill everything of the new amen but what I like about it brother Morgan amen it's not up to me Heen it's the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead living and rolling and Rain inside of you Amen brother Cody it's going the one's going to allow you to raise up he's the one that's making you bubble right now when everything's against you when all the odds are against you tonight amen there's something down inside of you there's a bubbling that can't be clenched it can't be put out it can't be stopped amen and the bride Sister George she's not going to fulfill almost all of it no no no no amen they ain't what kind of God we serve Jesus fulfilled everything that was spoken of him amen this bride she's going to fulfill everything that is spoken of her and that's including the Rapture brother Noah that's including the body change Hallelujah don't you love him tonight brother BR says and we read this last time when the believer in God gets turning together it generates the power of his resurrection when a Believer takes his word in their heart and begins to generate it brings forth fake cuz he has promised everything is in line he said the only thing you have to do to get electricity is push the button that's all you have to do when the scripture are supposed to be fulfilled now is press the button I don't know about you tonight hey Ben I think the wi's been ran brother Jared the lines have been ran there's power to those lines and the only thing he needs you to do is be planted in the house of the Lord amen and you're and you're not going to be able to keep from a flourishing in the courts of our God Amen the powers are ran all you had to do is said is flip the switch release the power every promise listen Heen you came too late to tell me that God doesn't heal you came too late to tell me amen that God doesn't deliver you came too late to tell me brother Amos God doesn't move anymore you came too the late to tell me that I can't Rejoice tonight you came too late to tell me I can't dance tonight you came too late to tell me that I can't praise my God for me in my house I'm going to praise the Lord let everything that has breath praise ye the Lord amen how many's got breath tonight I don't want the devil to take my place tonight amen I want to praise God I want to give God my all because he gave his all for me do you believe that now brother Brown says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts in other words a Church moving by the power of God he said the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come in the church defiling it making it look warm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works and attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that hell can't stand that hell fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the CH true church and what she is Catch it now not what brother Brandon was not what what your pasture is not what not what another age gone by amen but he brings it on down when you recognize a the true church and a true revelation of a true church and what she is and what she stands for she you can do the Greater Works she can you say she with me tonight will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and with understand that Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before come on somebody before her he will be the uh uh the definitely uh I don't know how to pronounce that word tweeted is that how did you say that brother Mark you history major there today is when Christ with stood every effort to gain power over him in the desert did you catch that when Christ withstood every effort everything Satan threw at him everything every trick of the enemy every desires of Hell s uh Jesus Christ and withstand every one of them and Satan hates Revelation but we love it with a true Revelation in our lives can you say our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we oh sister but we will prevail over them the word them depression them bad feelings them sickness them depression oppression them cancer them lust demons but we will prevail over every one of them Hallelujah for the voice of a king is within us and he places his name upon his little bride and she that's no reason brother Brown would say she is the final voice to the final age underneath her her messenger brother BR would also say there is one miss Jesus Christ brother Noah he said that's who he's coming for he's not coming for a church come on come on somebody he's not coming for a denomination he's not coming after a religion he's coming back for Miss Jesus Christ who is Miss Jesus Christ she's the she's a word upon word life upon life Spirit upon spirit Power upon power amen she took the name of Jesus Christ and she's been given a checkbook a checkbook of the master amen and she has full Authority she has full power to fill in anything that the blood has spoken for her amen anything that he died for 2,000 years ago Amen brother Brown said we will fulfill every promise in the New Testament Hallelujah and that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays there's where his worship is in her and her alone where he places his name there's Victory so it's where's victory at today it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ in her in her alone he says yes the church is no longer the mouthpiece talking about denominationalism of God it's a it's their own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation said the 17 the verse the spirit and the bride say come for that reason brother Tom he gives you the authority to speak to your storm to your Mountain you speak the word and he said I will perform perform it amen just as Jesus spoke the word and the God man performed it amen it's the same way this bride is going to speak the word amen he's going to perform it for she's going to have thus sayith the Lord amen she's going to have the very mind of God to know what he wants done with his word I'm talking about a bride a mature bride that is established in God's word word grounded and rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ she's not flirting with the nominalism she's not flirting with the world she ain't flirting with feelings Heen she ain't up there one day and down the next amen her flesh may get weak but her soul is never down it's odds it's a bubbling when the flesh is weak the soul is bubbling when everybody gives up on you the soul is still bubbling Hallelujah Hallelujah he said I will perform it you speak his word and it releases a power that hell can't stop hell cannot stop me but I'm not what it might can stop Joe Reynolds but it can't stop what I represent I represent the king how many representing the king tonight how many's representing the king aen hell maybe able to stop Joe and get him down every now and then and get his spirit all worked up brother Noah amen but down inside of brother Noah is a life of Jesus Christ amen Matt didn't put it there church didn't put it there your dad and Mama didn't put it there God placed it there before the foundation of the world and then there came an appointed time amen there's a holy spirit became to drop into that to Tabernacle amen and begin to dramatize that germ seed of life and all of a sudden there was inoculation there was a resurrection amen there was a seal of of Promise put Upon Our Lives as a Believer amen no matter what kind of Curves you make what kind of mountains you got to climb what rivers you got to cross amen this is this is one thing for sure amen I will going to I'm going to be with you I'm going to live and Rule and reign in you amen and he simply said these words you're going to make it and because brother said he will never put the seal on you unless he knew amen that you was bound for your destination I'm here to tell devil and put the hell on notice there's a bride in the evening time amen and knows their God and knows his power amen and knows one thing no matter how ugly this world gets amen this world is not my home and I've got the token inside of me that screams out heaven heaven heaven is my home brother Joey might be of this world we might be living in this world but we're not of this world it's who we're representing you know the devil may tell us a lot of things you know what I was glad when he said in Ephesians cuz I can't do it a church can't do it a religion couldn't do it but when Paul begin to tell us we once walked according to the course of this world the prince of the power of this air the spirit now working then in Children of disobedient of Disobedience among whom also we had our conversation times passing love of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh of the Mind the very nature of the children are wrath even as others but he said but God hallelujah I can't do it but God can hey better religion can do it for me but God can amen he didn't put a man there amen he didn't put a religion there amen when everybody else can't do it but God can amen when this world is falling apart heyen there looks like there no hope for you but God can would say like this one time I was his property but I'm not now cuz God can I was once a part of this world the lust of the world but God car I'm a testimony I'm I'm a testimony this evening that God cared I I'm a witness tonight that my God Is A Healer am but God can and I'm a testimony and it's a sword against the the Wows of the enemy that God's not dead he's very much alive you believe that and I just believe tonight that in this Tabernacle tonight there's a power there's an anointing in this Tabernacle tonight it's moving right in our MST and it's up to you if you want to release it remember Jesus was invited to a house and a party brother Morgan when he got to this party he wasn't he he he wasn't welcomed nobody anointed him nobody wased his feet he had long day Journey nobody paid much attention to him but in that house brother Mark was a man called Jesus in that house amen there was a power of Resurrection in that house was a power of Deliverance in that house was a power uh redeeming power a quickening power a releasing power but all it took was one ill Fame woman to recognize that Jesus had dirty feet and went back to her house and get all of her money oh church if you really want God to release his power amen release his quickening power Heen maybe you've been holding on to something for too long maybe we need to have the ability we'll get to in a few moments Amen to to let go let go of all our feelings let go of our emotions let go of our ideas let go of our past let go of our our previous uh bad bad hardships bad relationships it's time for us to let go sell out and give Jesus everything that we got and bring it to the Master's feet Hallelujah there he was maybe in a house like this there was Jesus enough power to ever heal every sick body with enough power to deliver Every Soul well I say he's that same God in this Tabernacle here tonight and brother Brown would say but what did this woman do what did it release to [Applause] her it released to her what did it do it also released the power of God to show them unbelievers that he was a prophet he know who she was and also released Joy Joy it also release power it also release eternal life it released that oh church if he did it yesterday I say he can do it again tonight in Grace Tabernacle how many believes he's here how many believes he's here and if he's here do how many believes all things are possible how many believes amen you can leave a different person it's here power is here electricity is here the anointing is here Jesus is here healing is here Deliverance is here but God can do it but God rich in Mercy if you're willing so what happened here there was many there at the house but there was one person release the power of almighty God and she solded out everything she took everything that she could get all of her money that she saved sister Joyce brother said she didn't go down there and get the cheap stuff she went down there and said I want the best Alabaster Box you got I'm going to church tonight Jesus needing some worship Jesus needing some Praise Jesus needs me Amen to worship him tonight amen I'm going down I this ain't going to be another church service amen I I forbid amen that Grace Tabernacle have another just ordinary service I I forbid a ritual this is a moment this is the hour this is the minute this is your opportunity for me I'm going to praise [Music] God now he says as a Believer he says Satan say give it back hand it over you say I come in the name of the Lord the possessors of Heaven and Earth and I'm an heir give it back Satan cannot hold it if you go to him with the scriptural authority of the word by faith and say it's mine it's mine lay it down it's mine give it back serve notice on him so notice on the devil lay it down he said that's gets him started but let's don't just get him started let's get him running how many would like to do that tonight let's get the devil that's been tormenting not just started but let's get him running lay it down because I come with the scriptural Authority can you say it with me tonight I am a believer I am a believer I am a believer I say devil lay it down lay down my children children lay down my peace lay down my happiness lay down my joy you come and stole it too much but today is a different day I come as a believer I'm taking my rights as a son and daughter of the king this is my inheritance this is my right I am a bride of Jesus Christ I'm a believer of Jesus Christ and I've got a right to every Redemptive promise in the book yes sir because it's mine sister ele Elizabeth is M every promise in the book hallelujah hallelujah every promise it's just not a song but Jonah it's just not a song every promise in the book look it's mine it's mine can we have that attitude tonight it's mine I'm not pitching it behind me I'm breaking it in tonight every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line brother B says hallelujah God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it into the hands of the church he said the arrow of God's Deliverance deliver you from sickness sin weary trouble whism everything else he says but we struck short of it he said but God listen to this words God shot the a of Deliverance to us we don't have to wait for it in the church service he said God has already shot the arrow of God's Deliverance for his children oh I'm a beneficiary of that promise tonight oh hallelujah it's given to each individual how many individual we have in the building it's for for you tonight you're a witness tonight brother Cody you're a testimony tonight hell's had his gripped on us all hey I was in the same place you was I needed Grace just like you did I needed his Mercy just like you did but when Grace came running when Grace met met the inside of the inside amen something happened it wasn't just a religion it wasn't that I I come my teeth on the message Pew it was a resurrection a resurrection from Death unto life changed changed changed I'm a testimony ass sword against the Wows of the enemy that God's Not Dead hallelujah it's mine every individual is given to each individual to strike against the powers of the devil for its sickness filthiness sin backbiting cursing whism he says brother don't strike short of nothing of God's blessing the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said strike it Don't Be Afraid Don't Be Afraid how many's afraid to do it tonight don't be afraid God said so Hallelujah this is not a myth tonight but God said so and I'm here to tell you sister Martha if you will strike God will meet your need it's not a it's not like a prediction of a weatherman where he can say 99 % and there's still

I don't think it's that fast it was so fast the enemy didn't even see it coming brother Joe there was only one place I know this is elementary and I ain't got to my I've got to get to it tonight but he only had one place there was only one place he could hit that could take the giant out David could miss David I can miss but God Amen Hallelujah David could have missed Saul could have missed but

the only difference between him and David he wasn't planted in the house of his Lord he didn't cast it upon the Lord he didn't have the support of almighty God all he had was support as the own ability and it wasn't good enough and that giant brother Jared hit the ground and David was in his Revival and David ran to the enemy's Camp he picked up the sword of the enemy how did a ruddy shrimp like guy like David pick up the sword or the Spear of a Goliath I say the same God that got in the stone and sped it up a thousand miles per second is the same energy and strength that is picking up the enemy sword we be tonight we do the same thing as David take testify and go to the enemy's Camp says I don't know about you but I told the enemy I was going to cut his head off he couldn't wait to get down there to the enemy's camp and take his own sword and cut his head off I wish I had an ugly head about a size of a wash tub and David's holding his head up Sister Janice he's holding it up and he's letting the world know he's letting both sides know our God is an all time God our God is not dead our God is alive and brother Brown said when they testified that that woman held up the head of Goliath and says M clanic gave her up he but told her she was going to die but here she is in the meeting tonight holding the head of Goliath up telling the world telling Mayo's Clint I'm not going to

we'll go Be not Afraid or dis made by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but it's God's this is what he's telling them in 2 Chronicles you're not going to have to fight in this battle you're outnumbered you're out class every you know you know they got more than you've got they're bigger than you are they have more weapons than you have but their God came down they said the God no doubt in the mind brother they must thinking man he's a a god of Moses he was a god of Abraham he was a mighty God he worked in their behalf he done miracles in their and maybe they begin to want remember down memory lane talking about testimonies how God was there at the Red Sea and how God delivered them with a mighty hand and now that same God Sister Jordan is telling them I'm going to fight your battles you don't have to worry about it you don't have to fight in this battle I'm going to be your strength I'm going to be your power I'm going to be your energy yes sir Hallelujah and no doubt look Carter he sitting there thinking you know what I heard a testimony about how God came down at the Red Sea and how the enemy was coming like a flood the ones that tormented one that made fun of them ain't been no got them to the place you know why you can bring us out here to die it wasn't enough graves in Egypt but I'm telling you it was rigged amen it was a perfect setup God knew exactly what he was doing he was coming on the scene he knew exactly when to get there he drove the enemy exactly where he needed the enemy that's my God tonight when things is going on in your life don't get discouraged and well-doing take this Romans 8:28 says all things work for the good God's working this out for you brother Salem he's in you he's in you he's living in you and he's saying he's simp right I didn't bring you out to destroy you I didn't send Moses to leave you deserted stand still and see the salvation of the Lord stand still tonight see the power of almighty God hallelujah and about that time could you imagine those same murmuring complainers begin to see a mighty hand a pillar of fire a cloud came down and severed between them and the enemy amen and all night long kept the enemy at Bay and about I about about the morning time I could imagine there came a great eastern wind of Yahweh out of the heavens came down sweeping down and the and and blew back the Red Sea dried up the ground and he says come and go with me Cody come and go with me let's walk across on dry ground and the enemy kept the en the god kept the enemy behind them by the power of Almighty hand the hand of almighty God the pillar of fire kept the enemy as a children of God walked across on dry ground amen what a Victorious thing it was when they got to the other side and about the time maybe the last one begin to LEAP up on the the banks of the uh the Red Sea the pillar fire moved up and the enemy said here's our opportunity and they took off but brother Brown said amen that path wasn't made for unbelievers Hallelujah that path wasn't predestinated for the enemy it was predestinated for Cody and Joe and myself and whoever else would walk on God's provided place of worship and they got on the other side and they grabbed a tamarine and they begin to praise their God and their God looked down through the pill of fire and with Angry Eyes and all of a sudden this is me I can imagine all of a sudden just a little water begin to Triple out and the and the mud of the dirt begin to get wet and they begin to run the wagons into the dirt and God took off their Wagon Wheels and had the enemy right where he wanted them brother B said was a perfect setup I believe he's the same God tonight I'm telling you if you brought that deie tonight you he came to the wrong place at the wrong time tonight amen I'm telling you it's a perfect setup brother Cody you might have came to church that that one day you didn't have it on mind maybe just an ordinary service but oh God rich and mercy came down it changed your life you're a testimony I use him everywhere I go God's not dead he's still alive tonight he's a testimony could you imagine what kind of Revival they was having when the wind of Yahweh and the and the water that was held back substained was released and the enemy begin to drown and the spirit of God whed out of the the wind and screamed your enemy is dead oh what kind of Revival they was having I'm telling you and probably in Acts 238 shouting screaming I don't know about you they're not going to take my shout they're not going to take my praise they're not going to take my dance they're not going to take my my praise and worship you know why the same God begin to tell them I'm going to fight your battle you remember that day at Moses you remember what they did down there that same God is speaking through Jehoshaphat and he's telling us this is not our battle it is God's W Glory you know what they begin to do not like a a lot of others Pou no no no they begin to sing the scripture said they begin to praise their God they begin to Worship in front of their adversary they're looking at them with a natural eye but they're worshiping in and in the face of their opposition I'm telling you when you enter into into his presence with praise God's going to enter into your circumstances with power and freedom and liberty my they begin to sing they begin to worship they begin to praise God they begin to have a church service am been like we've been having like we're having tonight they're just rejoicing having a good time praising

neighbor thinks I'm going to praise the Lord amen de devil ain't going to get my praise I'm going to praise him I'm going to shout I'm going to sing I'm going to worship I'm not talking about fanaticism I'm talking about worshiping how many likes to do that and that the scripture says in 2 Chronicles when they begin to sing and praise the Lord came down and set ambushments traps a setup begin to rig the war all of a sudden for the mark they begin to fight one another they're up here fighting the children of God is sitting down here hearing a bunch of noise going on on God sent
