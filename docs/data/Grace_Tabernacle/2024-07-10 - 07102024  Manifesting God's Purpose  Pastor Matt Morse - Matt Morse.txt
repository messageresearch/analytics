just want to keep remembering her in prayer and and we certainly love her and appreciate all that she does for the church and it's just a real blessing in an elder so if you have a need on your heart tonight I want you to just lift your hand to the Lord and I believe God knows everything that we have need of if somebody's sick in their body we'll just ask him to come and meet every need amen gracious heaven father Lord how we love you tonight and Lord we're so thankful Lord to have another opportunity to come and and be in the house of God here on a Wednesday night and Lord that we would just come and dedicate a few moments of our time to you and Lord to hear those that are singing songs of worship and Lord according to Thy word Lord that we come forth and we lift our hands in singing and our voices and Lord we realize that you told us that it's a sweet smelling Savor and Lord the Sanctified vessels that are pouring out to you Lord tonight and God we ask you Lord that you would come and Lord you would inhabit the praise of the people and God that you would speak to our hearts Lord and give us exactly what it is we have need of and Lord we we realize that you're a mighty God and Lord there's things that we may not even understand but Lord we realize you're in control Lord we just give this service over to you Lord we ask you to have your Liberty Lord Heal those that are sick Lord and Lord sister Sandy that you'd be with her brother David you'd touch his body Lord the many others that maybe not be written down God but need a touch from you Lord I pray you would be with them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you tonight and we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the book of 1 Timothy the 3r chapter and the 16th verse and then we'll also read out of Romans the 8th chapter and the 19th verse so just give you a moment to to get to there uh First Timothy 3:16 and then Romans 8 and 19 amen you love the Lord tonight amen just sure love to come out on a on an old Wednesday night and everybody's been working and and we've had some good weather over the last couple days makes you feel better and get get some good rain and kind of cool everything off amen just as long as we're cooling off the natural fire that's okay but let's let that spiritual fire keep burning amen so whatever God has to do to keep that c kindled that's what we want tonight amen amen how many love the Lord amen we just want to read out of 1 Timothy the 3rd Chapter and the 16th verse the Bible says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into Glory now we also want to read out of Romans the 8th chapter and the 19th verse and the Bible says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God and we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word as you take your seats notice as Paul would say this in the book of Timothy he says that he was he was justified in the spirit but God was manifested In the Flesh and then Romans Paul said but the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God I got this out I want to I want to speak on on manifesting God 's perfect purpose and I took this out of u a message that brother R would preach have faith in God he was talking about a missionary trip that they had gone to India and how they had gone in and the authorities in India had asked them as missionaries to don't come as missionaries and he said we've got all the tracks and everything we've already seen all that matter of fact we heard of Jesus Christ before America was even a nation you know India is an older nation and so we've already heard of all that but what we want is somebody who can make the word manifest that's what we want to see is someone who can make the word be alive how many can say Amen to that tonight we don't need another track we don't need just some other word or something just to make us feel good but what we need is some people that'll make the word be alive he said the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so the word manifest today is what we need how many say Amen to that in the Church of the Living God what we need today is the word made manifest you know some would asked this question brother Mark if God would come to make the word manifest well how would it come about you know I got to think of all the the questions when you think about the things that God has promised and the purpose that God has promised to come to pass and we sometimes we sit around as as as uh even as Believers but these questions get uh come up in our mind but how would God do that and how How would how would so and so be healed or How would how would the dead ever raise or How would how would there ever be a Rapture how can people leave the Earth and nobody anybody ever sit around and just thought about that am I come on now I'm not the only person how many raise your hand if you thought about it you wonder how God can do some of yall thought about some of y'all just man I want to sit down with you for a little while and gain the wisdom but but but I've always asked that just consider the weakness of My Flesh but brother Dave Paul you know sometimes you wonder how could God do all these things and how could he do this great work and how how could he take a church and Rapture a church and you know these questions that come upon our minds but you know this questions brother Mark they came in the days of Isaiah one time there was many questions that were similar questions and I love how that God answers them through Isaiah the prophet he says first he says in Isaiah 46 he says remember the former things of old so see when a question comes up on the ability of God or what God is able to do the answer he said Remember the former things of old he said for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me so before God would even answer the question tonight first he would ask you to remember who who it is that you're asking the question of so when you wonder how's it how's God able and how how how's he able to to to save my children that are lost and how's he able to to heal the sick and how's he able to put back things together that that had been torn apart and how how has God first he would answer this in this way that first of all I want you to know to remember the things that I've already done remember that I am God and remember there is none else and I am the Lord thy God and there is none like me and then he he makes this reminder and then he says I'm the one that declared the end from the beginning and I'm the one that made the ancient times and the things that are not or that are yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure so God tells us in his own word when the questions would come up brother Mark that God you realize that God would say that I'm the one that would do it and you know that why how could God say that I'm the one that's going to do it and I shall bring it to pass and I and it shall be done brother Mark it ain't that God's a fortune teller you know sometimes you get to look in at words and prophecies and things like this and and you say well you know maybe he can just see the future and maybe these predictions and things but God is not a fortune teller he he ain't one that makes predictions he's not he don't have a crystal ball that he's up there trying to look and see how things are going to turn out but the reality is is that God knows what's coming because God plans what's coming and when God plans it then he performs his own plan so we see this in an amplified Bible it would say it this way that my counsel shall stand and I will do all of my pleasure and I will fulfill my purpose so you see that God brother Mark he he makes his own purpose and we don't and you he don't wonder if someone else is going to be responsible for fulfilling his purpose but God when he makes a purpose he takes the responsibility of fulfilling the purpose that he made isn't that a wonderful God so when God makes a purpose and he declares something that will happen God declares it as a purpose and then he takes upon himself the responsibility of fulfilling the purpose that he made I think it's wonderful to think of how that he would write these things he said see when when when he when he makes his purpose or he makes his his his his will or he speaks his word he says I will accomplish all of my purpose I I will take the responsibility so we see this as the case is that God plans brother Mark and he governs all things so anything that we look to come to pass or things that we look to happen we realize that God is in control of it all how many believes that say amen God is in control of it all it's his purpose that is coming to pass so we find out the Bible would tell us this that God has the rightful Authority and the power to bring bring about his own intentions so everything he intends to come about it does come about and it comes about in God's Own time it's fulfilled in God's time just in God's plan his purpose is always fulfilled there's never been a purpose of God that didn't come to pass we God ain't wandering around he ain't scratching his head he's not afraid that things aren't going to work out he don't want he don't Pace the floors like you and I do trying to figure out if things are going to work out but when God makes a purpose it was his plan he purposed it in his heart and he took upon himself the responsibility in order to bring it bring it to pass I I thought you know why why the the world today they try to block God out they try to make the that the world events are just things of chance and and and y' y'all just preach with me just a few minutes but this is the world we live in they they make things that it's just so happen it's just going to be that way and and whoever is the king that it just so happen and whoever is in office it just so happen and and they try to remove God out of everything it is that we do but the reality is is it doesn't matter how hard they try they'll never take Christ out of it it doesn't matter how many efforts they make they'll never take God out of it let me tell you a truth friends that Jesus Christ can't be done away with his word can't be done away with for he's the center of everything in all of history Jesus is the center of it all matter of fact you can take a calendar brother Mark and you'll find out in just a few studies that that that that that every event that ever took place in the history of mankind is categorized around the birth of Jesus Christ how many know that you go you know one time I went through these I I won't do it tonight but you you know you go back in history and and you'll see on the calendar anything that happened before Christ used to it just said BC which was speaking of the time before Christ I know the world is trying to change that and take it all out and make it something else where just so they can remove Christ out of it but but this is how everything was categorized you get an old Encyclopedia Britannica you read in 3100 BC it was when when the Great stonehinge happened in England or in 1200 BC when Greece was invaded 776 BC was when Athletics was formed in in the honor of the Greek god in that in 700 BC in that Century it's when the Roman nation was formed it's when the the great Wars broke out of the Spartans and the and the Persians and the Greeks the things that everybody likes to make movies and things about but but but it was 700 BC it was showing us it was the time before Christ came walking upon the Earth and and and and you see as it as it got closer to the time you see as things begin to happen and and Julius Caesar was assassinated there was a war Great War in Rome and then Caesar Augustus was named Emperor and he had this Zeal to to overtake the everything that was around him and but you notice that while these natural events are taking place there's also the biblical events that we read about in the house of God that are taking place all along the side of it and we see that during this time BC and before Christ there was a man by the name of Abraham that was birthing a nation and we saw as that n nation was formed in the in the life of Jacob and he had his children they remember they went into a into a famine and Joseph went over into Egypt and he found a way that they could be sustained during the famine and and and through all that time through they they went out and the nation came there all the the sons of Israel and they gathered up in that place and God sustained them and for 400 years they worked in that area and they became a great number of people and then God would send Moses he would bring them out of this captivity and this slavery remember remember the old Pharaoh when he saw them growing in number he said there's more of them than there are of us if we don't bind them they'll take us over and so they put pressure on him and they put him in that that that that place of bondage but God he brought Moses and brought him out and then Joshua came in after Moses and he brought them into their Homeland and divided them into lands and you know that you know how the story goes they wanted a king so they raised up Kings and then they went again into another captivity and Babylonian Rule and and then in the middle of all that Babylonian captivity 70 years later they raises up another man by the name of Nehemiah and zerubabel and these are men that God called and they came to restore the city of Jerusalem and Ezra remember he came back to restore the word I found this I found this so powerful that whenever the King of Persia after all of this fall and all the the tragic rise and fall of the nation of Israel that here they are in this captivity their they their their Temple that Solomon had built had been torn down it just seemed like it wasn't nothing there and the promise of God had failed and the purpose of God had failed and all the things that God had promised them it had came to nothing it didn't last very long just a few years but brother Mark in the middle of this captivity there comes another man that was raised up named King Cyrus who was the king over over over Persia and when they took over Babylon the Bible says watch what God does with King Cyrus here he was a gentile King but I think it's so wonderful to see that God would take a gentile King and use him to advance his purpose upon his people here was a man that wasn't a follower he was a man that wasn't he wasn't uh he wasn't of the nation of Israel he was a Persian king but the Bible said in Ezra the first chapter that the first year of Cyrus the King of Persia that the word of the Lord came by the mouth of Jeremiah that it might be fulfilled that the Lord steered up the spirit of Cyrus the King of Persia and he made a proclamation throughout all the kingdom he put it in writing saying thus saith Cyrus the King of Persia that the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth he's charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem where which is Judah who is there among you that are of his people his God be with him and let him go back to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build a house of the Lord God of Israel for he is God which is in Jerusalem I thought when I read that I thought my isn't it something that God here he shows us that he will work his purpose no matter who he has to use to bring his purpose about here was a man that had nothing to do with Israel here was a king that came out of another Nation here he he didn't have ties to to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and the Crossing over the Red Sea or the coming out of Egypt or or or the or the one the Tabernacle in the wilderness he wasn't tied to any of that he was a gentile King brother Mar raised in another Nation raised under another family raised for his own purpose and in his Zeal to take over the world here was his own statement God has given me the Whole World in His Zeal to take over the world that something in his Spirit would say but I got to go back to Jerusalem and I'm going to let y'all go home and be rebuild your temple and I'll let you do it in peace and I'll even give you the money and the supplies in order to build it I thought that's how our God is he used a Persian to fulfill his purpose he used a Persian king that was a that that was a greedy man that had desires to build great wealth but God used him to make his purpose come about for his children let me tell you friends it may seem like everything's out of order it may seem like everything's out of cater and we don't know which way to turn but it doesn't matter who's in office it doesn't matter who takes who takes control my God will use whoever he has to use to make his purpose come to pass for his children we don't have to wonder and worry and fret over over what tomorrow holds what we need to know tonight is Who Holds Tomorrow and it and it's our God he he's still in control he still has power he still has a purpose and he'll still bring his purpose to pass he'll work through whoever he has to work through when they went to the temple they rebuilt the city Bible says they they here in in 63 BC here in this Roman Empire came in and they con conquer Jerusalem but in the midst of this Roman occupied Israel come the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ here they were in just a in a terrible State and and Rome had came in again they they they they they couldn't even go out of there they were half of them were on a curfew there was revolts all the time and in the middle of all this chaos of a of a torn up Nation being bound by by by Rome here comes the birth of our Lord and savior they were looking for some great king to come and deliver him but he was born in a manger and you know what happened all of history changed in the life of Jesus Christ when it goes from The Life of Christ it changes from BC to a d an OD Domino which meant the year of Our Lord so we see as the time would progress brother Mark now we're not counting down now we're counting up the years from the time that the Lord was upon the Earth here we are in the year of 2024 from the time that the Lord Jesus walked upon the face of the earth I thought isn't it something brother Marcus history would tell us uh you know event would happen after event 1492 Columbus sail and and founded or found America 1776 we became an independent nation from English rule in 1865 we had that great Civil War slavery was abolished at the ending of a of a civil war there was these this this is the events that took place they were ad ad ad but the whole time natural events are taking place guess what There Are Spiritual events that are taking place here after Jesus had had went into the tomb and he was ascended the Bible says just a few days I can can say Ad but a few days later 120 were gathered in the upper room and the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room they came out of the upper room filled with the spirit of God and they preach with such conviction and power of the Holy Ghost that 3,000 men they gave their heart to God on that very that that I'm talking about unbelievers people that would have made fun of and mocked them and people they would have hid from a few days before but ad they came out and the spirit of God was upon them they were filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the men that they went to they took that same Spirit of of God and they delivered it unto men and they fulfilled the commission that God had given to the church friends it didn't stop there in just a few years there came a man by the name of apostle Paul he was called by God he went out and done missionary work he went into Asia Minor and started churches all over all over Asia Minor and from his ministry came another man from his ministry come a man by the name of Iranians that went on to fulfill the commission of God and the purpose of God and to carry forward God's purpose and from there we just see as time would continue to go on 312 ad there was a man by the name of St Martin and St Martin you you ever read the story of him what a powerful life that he had here here he was a man that was a giver and and and and was willing to uh to to give all that he had to help those that were poor and those around and he had such a spirit on him to give and one night it was said that St Martin he actually G seen a beggar on the street and he gave part of his coat to him and that same night he had a dream and Jesus appeared to him in the dream and he was wearing the full coat and when he woke up the next morning that the coat was made whole I don't know I'm just saying what they wrote in history but this was a testimony about a man that was filled with the spirit of God and it didn't stop there in 606 ad there was a man by the name of St Columba in the in the history you can read books about Columba there there books about his life and the in the in the spirit of God that was upon him but here he would come as a messenger to the age that he lived in and they would say he healed the sick he opened blinded eyes he caused those that were dead to be raised he healed diseases he he stopped wild beasts he spoke to storms and storm ceased he wasn't just some Catholic Church priest he wasn't just somebody sitting in a confession Booth he was a man that was filled with the spirit of almighty God 1520 ad Martin Luther came to to start the Reformation or be a major part of the reformation and John Wesley 1750 ad to carry on this this voice of sanctification and and just the furtherance of the Gospel all the way down into 1906 the Bible or or the the history would tell us that there was a great Revival remember that old zza Street Revival that we talk about it was an outpouring of the Holy Ghost what was it it was so impactful that a prophet of God would look at that time and he would declare it to be the beginning of another age he said here we are in the age of leosia it was the it was the restoration of Pentecost it was where the church had come back come back to this place again and friends let me tell you this it doesn't matter how you look at it I I know I'm kind of going fast but I want to get a Foundation laid it don't matter how you look at it it doesn't matter if it's a natural event it doesn't matter if it's a spiritual event it doesn't matter if it's a world event if it's a a Biblical event there is one man that is in the center of it all and his name is Jesus Christ in all the world in all of history there's one man he's in the center of it all his name is Jesus let me tell you friends not only is he in the center of everything that took place in time but he's in the center of everything that ever took place in Eternity for the Bible said in in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep see the beginning is a place where something started but before there was a beginning there was still this same Christ before the beginning this same this same God in his brother Mark he was he was with his thoughts we say he was alone with his thoughts but you realize but in his thoughts was his purpose and he had a desire to see it fulfilled God thoughts they they weren't like man's thoughts you know we the Bible says man's thoughts are on evil continually hello somebody you can't sit in a church service without your mind wanding off to somewhere that it shouldn't wander off to because that's the way the thoughts of men are but the Bible says but God's thoughts are perfect thoughts they're pure thoughts they're righteous thoughts and he said my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways but my thoughts are higher my ways are higher and as the rain cometh down and the snow from Heaven it Waters the Earth it makes it bring a bud that they may give seed to the SE and bread to to the eater then so shall my word that goth forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void but accomplish that which I please and shall prosper where I sent it my what a promise of God that my word shall prosper whereever I send it how many say Amen to that so it doesn't matter where the word of God Is Spoken it's going to prosper how many believe that he said it'll Prosper so that means when God sends a message to his people brother Mark we have a promise from God that the word is going to prosper oh I love this the whole world is looking for Prosperity they're looking for for great wealth and to prosper in their work and prosper in their life but do you realize that the only real Prosperity we ever have is in the word of God butam said see and until you get back to the real gospel again get back to God's word get back to thus sayeth the Lord we'll never Prosper until we do that listen friends you want to see your life Prosper get back to thus sayith the Lord you want to see your work Prosper get back to thus sayeth the Lord you want to see your church Prosper get back to thus sayith the Lord he said we'll never Prosper until we do that that's the only place where true Prosperity is see when we look at Prosperity we look at this word Prosper as success or a gain in material things see where God's word it'll Prosper it'll gain in in great things and gain in material things but you realize that in this portion of scripture in Isaiah 55 the word Prosper comes from a Hebrew word that says salak which is TS l a c which don't it don't mean to prosper like we would say it but it actually means to advance so when you requote this scripture here's what God says it will advance where I send it listen he talks about the rain coming down and the rain would stack a seed in other words and that seed when the rain hits it it won't remain a seed but it's going to bring forth the fruit so listen he said and so shall my word that goes out of my mouth it'll not return void but it will accomplish that which I please in other words it will advance where I send it in other words it will cause things to move forward it will cause them to grow listen it'll bring a seed to life so so God will never allow it to remain a seed he'll never allow well it might makes me want to preach the thoughts that God has about you he'll never even allow them to remain a thought he said they're good thoughts they're great thoughts the thoughts I I think toward you they're thoughts of peace and not of evil but God's thoughts he won't allow them to remain is to but he they must become word and they must come to pass so see this is this is God's word he said it'll Advance where I send it so it'll bring seed to life listen what science says in order for a seed to come to life in order for there to be life there has to be four things you want know what they are there has to be a seed there has to be water there has to be a light and there has to be bedding ground that's a quick that's an Arkansas version of science but that's what we have to have in order for it to bring forth life and I love this because Isaiah as he's writing of the word of God God says as the rain comes forth so shall my word so he shows us that his word is water you see that Paul would speak it in Ephesians 5 he said he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so you see he types the word as water but now watch what Jesus does in Luke the 8th chapter he gives a parable to those that are sitting around him and he speaks of a swer going forth and sowing a seed and at the end of the SE seed Falling by the wayside some fell on Stony ground some fell in the thistle some fell on good ground but Jesus said at the end of it he said the parable of this is is that the seed is the word of God so now not only do we have a place where it says but the word is water but now Jesus says but the word is a seed and then we go over into Psalms 1119 and here's what David said he said the word is a lamp unto my feet and it's a light unto my path even Jesus when he would come he said I and the light of the world so now not only is it water and not only is it seed but now Jesus said but it's also a lie it's so so the word is all three I thought my no wonder that God could say that it would Prosper or it would Advance where I send it it will not remain a seed cuz the same God that planted the seed is the same God that brought the water and the same God that poured out the water is the same God that shined his light upon it he's the same God that put life on the inside of it and he's the same God that'll fulfill his purpose in every seed it will not remain in seed form no wonder God said it would Advance it can't remain in seed form cuz it's all of that it can't remain in that place but you know what God had to do brother Tom God had to do one more thing he had to make an atmosphere for a seed to grow it takes us all the way back to this time of creation the Bible says the Earth here it it was without form and void and God begins to speak do you realize when God spoke the world was created by the spoken word and God be to speak and as he would say let this seed bring forth and let this seed bring forth and bear this such fruit and as he began to speak he said let every seed bring forth of its old kind and brother Mark you know what happened is that every seed that God made had to grow isn't that something there wasn't no messed up seeds there wasn't something that didn't have us tampering around with seeds is what causes have a certain yield that don't come forth right but when God made seeds they everyone came forth why because they were created by the spoken word of God you think about when this natural seed that God made and this natural seed God had made it the Bible said and then he divided the Earth from the waters and then he said let there be light God made everything that was needed for the seed to grow and then he made he said let dry land appear and then God what he did is he made a bedding ground to place that seed in and all the things that God had created by his spoken word they came together around that bedding ground that God had made and he placed the seed in that ground brother marah and by his word that was seed by the water that was that was word and by by the light that was word that seed be to grow in the ground and it brought forth the very thing that God had thought in his mind there had never been an apple tree there had never been a pecan tree nobody could say it was right or but but it matched the image that God had in his mind he wanted to see him come to pass so he he made the seed he made the water he made the LIE then he made a bedding ground for it to come forth in so you see that but but as God does this you notice that that that that the natural life it all came by seed but if Natural Life come by seed wellin spiritual life how you think it comes it's going to come by seed too that's what Jesus said he said the word is seed you think about it John one I may as well just preach it John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in the 14th verse he comes in see notice he tells us this the word is here but what the word needed is it needed a betting ground for it to grow he could have said in the beginning was a seed in the beginning was the light in the beginning was the water in the beginning was everything that God needed but what God needed was a beding ground that he could place that seed in that it could come forth and manifest the very image that God had in his mind so the Bible says that God in the or John says that God came down in the 14th verse he said he was made flesh and he dwelt Among Us that very word what did he do he he came and he found a little uh one young lady by the name of Mary that came in contact with an angel of the Lord and God took that seed that that God had made which was his own word and he put it down in the womb of a woman and planted it in her that she would be able to bring I thought my God isn't this something that God would have a bedding ground Not only was he the seed Not only was it the water Not only was it the lie but it was God that prepared a ground that he could put that seed in that it would manifest the very thing that God had in the back part of his mind and the Bible says and the Word was made flesh and he dwelt among us all this word and prophecy and preaching see it has to have a place to be manifested all the things that God has said see in this it do matter what promise God made it has to have a bedding ground to be manifested in so in this womb the seed was placed the word was made flesh he was the manifestation of what God was the Bible would even say he was the image of an invisible God I isn't it isn't it something and then when Jesus would come he'd say I say unto you except a corn of wheat would fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit so he teaches us this principle that a seed must be planted to manifest so it started as a seed in the days of Jesus the gospel was planted into a tomb he went in a tomb he he resurrected on the third day he came back forth on Easter morning he ascended into Glory he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost the power came that to those they went out boldly preaching the gospel you realize that this prophecy that that it would be preached in every nation beginning at Jerusalem so here God he would plant this in Jerusalem but when it came up and brother Mah and he ascended into glory and the spirit of God fell upon on them they had the power of God on their life and the very thing that he planted in Jerusalem Advanced into all the world he didn't mean for it to just remain there he meant for it to move he meant for it to go out into every nation into somebody to spread the gospel let me tell your friends it's a living gospel it's moving around the world it's been carried by anointed men and women that are telling the testimony of Jesus Christ and the life of Christ and they're living a life and witnessing to others what is it it's the advancement of the word of God and it's moving around the world and somewhere along the way as the word is advancing throughout the Earth it gets deluded by men along the way it gets deluded Ed by theologies and thinkings and and men that would that weren't annointed brother Mark that well we'll just kind of keep things this way it makes a little easier and so and so they're more comfortable coming to church if you don't talk about those things and you know then then we'll have we'll have some better fellowship and after all she makes fried chicken and my if we got rid of her we wouldn't have no more chicken so they begin to make all for whatever reasons but men make up reasons but it got deluded and the power of what was being spoken and the power that was poured out on the day of Pentecost then the then it lost its effect in the church and you notice and through but but through all this and as it began to go all these different ways if you could just look at the big picture all these different ways but there's still this this true seed that's going through all this it may have just been a small number and there was times when it was such a a small number it looked like there wasn't none at all and then Into the Dark Ages you notice that that they were they were crucified and martyred and and and put to death for for for standing for Jesus Christ and they were they were buried and you say well what was it it was the burial of a seed that would soon come back and grow into its full maturity but said see it had to die through those Dark Ages just like any other corn of wheat it has to go beneath the Earth and be buried to bring forth in the First Reformation them two blades of Luther the stalk and Wesley the the tassel the great missionary age it had to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration of gifts almost to deceive the very elected it looks like a wheat grain open it up but there's no wheat at all it's only a Shook and now in 1965 he makes this statement he said but now it's beginning to pull away and the wheat is beginning to be seen my isn't that good is there some Believers in here that heard that he said it's beginning to pull away and the wheat is beginning to be seen think about this that went into the ground the seed that went into the ground and as it begin to come forth he said see this is not the Pentecostal age this is the latterday age this is the bride age this this is the evening life where Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern what is it it's the advancement of the word of God you think about it it's moving I maybe some of you aren't familiar with the terminology but this word is moving but Mark it's growing here the church has grown into this age and making preparation for a Rapture you see you see what took place the first corn of wheat which was the bridegroom it was Jesus he went into the ground he had to fall into the Earth in order to rise again he said so if the bridegroom had to do within the bride done it also she was that was born at Pentecost she went through the Dark Ages just like any other seed she was buried and had to die they must do it but what it did is it started something and they sprouted out again in Luther's age in the Reformation what you realize that what caused the Reformation was was the martyrs that had went down in the Dark Ages what caused those men to be so bold to be able to stand upon the word of God what gave them so much courage what caused them to come out their houses and say say I'm going to stand on the word of God it was because of the those that were martyred and those that were slain for the name of Jesus Christ you let one man be Marty for the name it would raise up a Revolt of men that would save for the life of him that innocent blood that you spill it's what it's what caused them to rise up it was a seed that went into the ground and that seed that went into the ground it gave life in the days of Martin Luther for them to come out of the ground and to stand against a Roman Catholic church and to say that ain't the truth but God God's word is true and we're going to go back to the Bible and we're going to make sure it's in a language that everybody can read it and we ain't going to come down to a confession Booth to confess to some men are false but we're going to go to Jesus Christ because you ain't our intercessor Christ is our intercessor it gave them the courage to be able to stand upon the word of God and they grew up through that that stalk and it went into a to a tasel y can turn that down if it's hurting the babies but went into a tassel in in the age of Wesley in the age of Pentecost it came back all the way into this almost in this age of maturity you look out in a wheat field and brother Mark you know what you see it looks just like wheat even when the seed has already came out of it but notice this but you open it up and the seed is not there see that every one of them had a purpose God used them to fulfill his purpose they were carriers of the life you say cuz you know many ask this question how could it ever be of God if it ain't no more God used it to carry the life forward but then we come into this age to see the the bride had to go born at Pentecost had to go through the Dark Ages just like any other seed and be buried they had to die but it sprouted again in Luther in the First Reformation it didn't look like the seed that went in but it was the light of that day and the stalk then went to tassel and West Sea and the tassel and the Pentecost the Shook and the life continues on you realize this and now the Shu has pulled away and the wheat to give the wheat a chance to lay before the sun to ripen you want to know where we are today the message coming right back into the church again forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the first original one that went into the ground this is what the Bible had prophesied that there would come a church in the last days brother Mark that'd be the same church that it was on the day of Pentecost there'd be a church in the last days that would that would come forth that would manifest the very life of Jesus Christ same church same work same God doing the same works today that he done back then think about it the message coming into the church he said the shuck is pulled away give the weed a chance to lay before the sun I hope you're hearing me to ripen the message coming right back into the church again forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the original one that went into the ground isn't that something the message coming into the church again I'll tell you what you know why this goes over most people's head because they don't hear the message said but the message has to come into the church chur again in order for the church to manifest the same life that it had before so when the message comes into the church it'll have life when the message comes to a church it'll have true worship when the message comes to the church it'll heal the sick and let me tell you friends it'll do the same thing to every individual it'll take a dried up old believer halfway church member 25 years old be going to church cuz your daddy made you your whole life but then one day you'll get a hold of something and get a revelation of who God is and the message of the hour will strick your heart and you don't go to Church to be known it ain't no social party anymore it ain't show off baby clothes or show off this or that but it's because there's something on the inside of you that has a burning desire to manifest the life of Jesus Christ it'll take every critical spirit away from you every Spirit of hypocrisy away from you it'll cause you to be a real believer and want to come to the house of God you'll come in shouting you'll come in praying you'll come in with the things of the world off your mind cuz there's something in your heart that wants to get back to God and be what God has called you to be something in the Bride of Jesus Christ that causes her to want to manifest the purpose of God I don't want to be a church member I want to manifest the purpose of God I don't want to be a benchwarmer I want to manifest the purpose of God I want the life of Jesus Christ to be manifested in me that's what a Believer wants that's the desire of our heart when the message comes into your life it'll heal the sick when the message comes in it'll it'll it'll take it'll deliver you of all the spiritual things it'll set free the captives it'll men broken homes it'll restore your relationship back between you and God it'll take families that are torn apart you know what they need they need the message of God why why are they in such a rate they need the message of the hour to hear what God is speaking in this age but Mark it's the only thing that that can come that can restore us back that was the purpose of the message was to turn our hearts back to the original faith I don't know about y'all it makes me want to shout see the church World failed to see the advancement of the word of God see but as Moses called out a nation Christ today is calling a church he called a nation out of a Nation Christ is calling a church out of a church the same thing in type taking them into a glorious Eternal promised land now to refuse the person that's doing the calling which is actually Christ see we look behind the pull pit and we see the man he said but to refuse the person that's doing the calling which is Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are in this age you have to accept just like they did in that age you have to accept the person of Christ which is the word see so when the word Goes Forth here God he don't give us an option let me tell you you say brother man why don't God give me an option because God is going to fulfill his purpose so you know what he does he put something in you that causes you to be able to accept the word of God he put something in you even when it hurts and sometimes sometimes it it just feels like a knockout punch sometimes it feels like the preacher stepping all over your toe sometimes you're feeling like you're getting beat with a whip you feel like they felt when Jesus went into the temple beating out the money changers sometimes we feel that way said but the purpose of it is is that God is going to make sure that you carry out his purpose so see you have to accept it which is the word so you see what the plan of Satan is in this age this the plan of Satan is to stop the word of God from advancing and I already out a time is to stop the word of God from advancing from moving forward so what he does brother Mark is he puts up scarecrows in front of everybody and everybody has different ones he put scarecrows in front of you to keep you from being able to go any further with God so whatever that is it may you would put them and say well you can't go you can't go past this and you know sometimes I think about it every one of us is different but if you if you just think about that tonight what Scarrow has Satan put in front of you to keep you from advancing in the word of God what scarecrow does he put on your road is it well you know I've already been to to this church and they did me wrong they hurt my feelings so I can't put my confidence in people because the last time I put my confidence in somebody they all let me down so I can't really trust nobody and I gotta got see it's a scarecrow that keeps you from fulfilling the fruits of the spirit I want to love everybody but I can't really love everybody because after all you know last time I I opened up my heart and I did for them then they hurt my feelings and did didn't have nothing to do with me back and and matter fact I wouldn't try to shake their hand they wouldn't even shake my it's a scarecrow he puts in the church I'm too little I'm too big I'm a girl I'm a guy I can't pray whatever I'm I'm not smart enough whatever scarecrow that Satan puts in front of you that you can't go any further with God I've had family problems I've had I've had I've had husband issues wife issues children issues Church problems they're scarecrows to keep you from advancing in the word of God you think about it the scarecrows that he puts in the church so many times you would tell you I know this because I'm a pastor and I talk to a lot of people that don't go to church and I always get the same answers it's the oddest thing it tells you it's a devil it's the oddest thing they say the same things I know they don't talk they don't even know each other but they'll tell you the same thing well you know what I I was going to church and I was doing good for a while but you know man there's so many Hypocrites in there I've seen that one sister down there and you you seen what she wrote on Facebook and then she comes over and raises her hand act like she's just a Christian then she goes off posting this stuff and why there ain't no Christian in her so she's a hypocrite I'm GNA be Pastor mad a minute I don't know when's the last time y'all went to Walmart but I'm never going back to Walmart because there's so many Hypocrites in there I can't find the food out I can't Wade through the critics in Walmart to be able to find the the Chili Cheese Fritos on Isle N I can't get through them there's too many Hypocrites you you you hear what I'm saying there's so many there's there's so many Fanatics in Walmart that I can't even go to Walmart there there's so many there's so many impersonators in Walmart they act like they're they're big shots they act like they got money they put on fancy clothes and they put carry fancy wallets they spray on perfume act like there's somebody really ain't got two nickels rubbed together they're impersonating somebody else there's impersonators they filled up the whole aisles of Walmart I can never go back think about it everywhere you go it's the same thing but that ain't the real reason I'm not an impersonator brother man said it shouldn't make you not want to go to church or not want to serve god this is my own words but it ought to make you want to serve God because if there's somebody impersonating something they're impersonating because there's a real somewhere so you know what I don't have to be put out by the impersonator what I want to do is become the real that I might win the impersonator and cause the make believer to want to be a real believer that's just pastor Matt tonight scarecrows that keep him from advancing that's what goliath was when he stood before the children of Israel down in the valley here they were up on a mountain they couldn't even go and do their own they couldn't even do their own march to their own land because he was SC he was a scarecrow that kept them from advancing never fired a shot never swung a sword he sat down there and run his big mouth and every one of them stayed where they were because a scarecrow kept them from advancing but you know what it took it took a man that young boy that came down there and saw what was going on and he said you know what I may not know a whole lot but I know one thing God's Church deserves better than this I know one thing God's children deserve better than this there's promises in this word that you're not living up to there's things that God has promised you that you're not taking advantage of there's blessings in God's word that they're not upon your life because you're you're hiding from you're allowing the Devil get in between you and God you want to be a real Christian and you want to be a real believer and you want to be a Son of God and you want to raise your you want to raise your your children and to be able to not be you want it to be effortless that you can just be a real soldier in the army of God and there's scarecrows that are standing in your way but I thank God that God would anoint a man named David you know what he did Brother Morgan he went down to a stream he said it may not take much he took five Stones which was F AI T he stood in the face of a giant he said how dare you defy the armies of the Living God I think that's what we need today we need some anointed men and women and anointed mamas and daddies and grandmas and grandpas they'll stand the old Scarecrow in the eye and say how dare you defy the children of the Living God we're living under the Covenant that God has given unto us you're standing Upon Our Land now get out of the way and let God have his way how will God bring his purpose to pass brother Mark he'll raise up somebody to be able to move forward he'll raise up somebody to advance his word he'll never let it lay stagnant he'll never let it go backward God don't have a retreat in his army but got to raise up somebody that'll go forward in the word of God the rest of the churches they Oh Glory they may not like it but God will raise up somebody that'll go forward in the word God will raise up somebody that'll take this message that God has sent and they'll elevated over the people of God and they'll move forward in the word of God why he said you cuz God's purpose is going to be fulfilled that's what we need it takes an anointed man to be able to stand up before God butam said God is training for this great battle the Bible says we're living in a time when culture and education has smothered over the word of God it's got into reasoning the Battle Is Now who will stand the battle is now but who will stand the battle is in Array look what opposition that we have great denominations telling people the days of Miracles has passed all that stuff that's just for the disciples I've heard it I've talked to them all sit down with my faor my favorite Baptist saying is the law and the prophets was until John I love it you know what they mean by that well there was no Prophet that would come into the world after John the Baptist I thought how a foolish statement when you're so wise didn't even know Jesus was a prophet who was born after John the Baptist so wise that you didn't know Jesus was a prophet or John the Revelator or or or the Bible said agabus was a prophet book of Acts he was a prophet you know what I asked a lady she told with that one time brother Tom she said the law and the prophets was until John so after after John I said after John what there W there waser no prophets I said well so let me ask you if the law I wasn't going to get into this but you can have it for free if the law and the prophets were until John and that means there's no more prophets that means there's no more law are you with me so if you want your neighbor's wife if you want to steal if you want to cheat and lie well all that came from the law of Moses God never done away with it but if it has to stop at John well then why are we carrying it forward you see because that's not what the scripture even was meaning but the rest of the scripture said but the Kingdom of Heaven here we are in another in this Messianic kingdom and there's still prophecy there's still the five-fold ministry Paul told us that he said the apostles prophets teachers evangelists Pastors in the five-fold ministry in the kingdom of God the spirit spiritual Kingdom that we're in today so still the great gifts of God and Jesus said I didn't come to do away with the law I came to fulfill it and then he gave another one love one another he didn't do away with them he didn't say run off and do away with everything that's ever been taught no he built on it amen and gave you the by his grace the ability to be able to live it that's just the way I believe it he said the battle is ready to go she's in Array now what great opposition that we have but who will be like David that would stand against that old Philistine and say I'll go fight him God wants men and women this morning who can raise up and say I'll take the Lord at his word No Matter What fail this one fail or that one you saws all this forth you go you're afraid of him well you just get back where you belong but let the Davids move forward if the saws want to get out of the way and they don't want to handle it let the saws get out of the way but let the Davids go on he said because God's Army is marching forward Men of Valor men of Faith men of power men of understanding you say I'm not smart enough I don't know enough I'm not big enough I'm not old enough well let me tell your friends he said you don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated they just have to be channels that God can work through in order for God to use you you don't have to be a great man you have to be a willing channel that God can work through isn't that good you have to be I'm let the music players come I've already lost you you have to be a willing channel that God can work through how can he work this day I wonder if I ask this today how many how many willing channels do we have won't you stand to your feet how many willing channels that are willing that that they're willing to manifest the word of God you say well how how will I do it well let me tell you how you do it when the word comes you don't stop it up you let it flow through you that's a channel see a a channel it don't stop things a channel is free flowing it allows water you take an old water Channel it allows water to go through it say see and when it comes through you when it flows through you here's a message in itself then it comes out with great power think about the word that goes forth out of my mouth just like when you come into a church service brother Travis you when you realize when you sit in this assembly that you have two choices you can be a roadblock or you can be a channel every one of you me too when I sit here you can be a roadblock or you can be a channel that God can work through you say brother may how am I one or the other because when the word of God is preached you could say or or even somebody comes up to sing a song well that's the wrong song I don't want to hear her sing that song She's terrible at that song it's not a channel it's a roadblock but why is she sing it again she sang last Sunday that's not a channel it's roadblock why is he preaching didn't he preach two weeks ago somebody get the calendar out see I mean it's not a channel it's a roadblock he said but we have to be a channel you realize that God God knows things we don't know great power he's moving in ways that we don't understand he knows he knows every he knows what to put you through in order to make you what he wants you to be sometimes he'll put you through things you don't like and it hurts every minute of it but if you could see the end of the road say but God is doing something here he's doing something to me he's molding my character he's making he's trying to take this old nature that is handed down from family members and daddies and momas he's trying to take that old nature out of me and put a different kind of Nature and then it'll all get better isn't it something how that you know when a roadblock comes I'm just just speaking what the Lord putting on my heart but when a roadblock comes you can't get nothing out of a service you can't you can't come to church you can't you can't get nothing out of it everything's wrong they're too loud this one's too quiet they clap this wrong everything's all messed up but if you ever get in the right channel then none of that ever matters you ever noticed that so when you get a person that says well I'll I'll just be a channel that God can work through and then you'll get one over in front of them and and and that that they'll just start worshiping the Lord say you know what Lord let me just be a channel I I don't want to get my spirit all tore up and be a roadblock let me be a channel and they just start praise the Lord Lord I Thank you for for coming tonight Lord I Thank you for allowing me to to have a vehicle to be able to get to church Lord I Thank you for my health I thank you for allowing me to have the hands to be able to raise to you Lord I I thank you for giving me a voice that I could speak to you Lord I Thank you for allowing me to SP sing Lord I Thank you for my children and you just become a channel and all that God's given you you don't you don't just bottle it up but you give it back to the Lord you begin to Worship the Lord and you know what happens is you enter into an atmosphere and that atmosphere it don't just stay right where you are but from where you are it be it'll move out why because he always advances God never pours himself into something that won't pour out he pours himself into things that will allow to be to be poured out that's why God wants vessels that are flowing he wants people that are moving he want he wants churches you want to see a church blessed you start doing missionary work and supporting missionaries why is why is God to grow the church in such a way because it's a channel that God can work through you take a person that never that never done anything they hold on to all their money and they they'll never it just seems like they never grow in any way and then that same person they'll start supporting the church and supporting missionaries and and trying to help the work of the Lord and everything around their household will change their bills will change their pay they get pay raises their cars La their tires last longer on their cars they're putting 400,000 miles on Fords listen because they got into a channel where God could use them that's what we need to be in a channel where God could use us I love you brother Noah he's a good man but we want to be in the right channel allow God to use us say see when we get in the channel that's brother Market it just opens up the whole you how many just in a few minutes see the atmosphere in this building change it ain't it ain't from that music it's from a person it's from your heart opening up and saying Lord let me be a channel Lord let me let let let your spirit flow let let when the word word comes Lord and even when the preacher says something I don't like Lord let me say Amen you realize that when we amen the word of God what it does brother Jared whenever the word of God is spoke when we worship think about it we this is a church that that backs the word so I'm not preaching at you because you already do it but it's a church that backs the word they they like to say Amen don't let me sit right there sometimes I wish I had another me but I can't help I love to back the word of God why because I want that word that comes in me I want to be a channel for it I say Amen it means so be it I want to let it out why because we're pulling to create an atmosphere that a life-changing word can come forth and so here when you when you hear a word you say Amen you say so be it why it's a channel that God can flow through confirming his word that it can grow and the more you pull the more word comes the more word Comes The More You Pull and it begins to build an atmosphere in a building and an anointing comes around and all of a sudden all the things of this world don't matter anymore you say brother Matt you mean all that comes from just saying amen to the word of God I wish I could call her to the stand and ask sister Hattie right what it meant to say Amen to the word of God when everybody else would laugh at a testimony and make it a mockery but she said that ain't nothing but the truth and the angel of the Lord turned to her and said you tell her she can have anything that her Hearts Desire whatever she would say she'd have it and friends I'm here to tell you I'm declaring unto you if God is a god at all it didn't matter what that woman asked for God would have gave it to her if she have asked for a million dollars I believe with all my heart it had been stacked up on her on the top of her table you say well how would he had done it the same way that he done it with Peter when they went to pay their taxes and he said Lord how shall we pay he said go catch a fish and when you catch him in his mouth will'll be the Corin that we need to pay our taxes that same God he' have put it on her table because she said amen to the word of God all she did was say Amen you think she understood that why she didn't understand it but she said amen why because she believed God's word and something in her caused her to say Amen that the purpose of God might be fulfilled in her life let me tell you friends just say an amen it'll do something for you why because it's a law of God the Bible says when it goes for there has to be somebody to confirm it so here God would come in an assembly he would preach the word and the people said amen the oldest the oldest record we have in the Bible of an assembly was in the days of Nehemiah and the Bible said Ezra stood up on a pull pit of wood and they stood beside him and he open the Bible or the word of God and the people when he opened the word they all stood for the reading of the word that's why we do it today and when he began to read the word the Bible said after the word went forth they said amen and amen they lift their hands in the air they bowed their faces to the ground and they begin to worship God who told them to say Amen nobody said it who told them to raise their hand nobody told them they were channels that God could work through friends with the spirit of the Lord you say what's he looking for he's just looking for you to be a channel you say Amen well make me a channel it'll make you a channel the word of God it'll release the power you wonder why we have meetings and the power of God's movement it's because people come to church prayed up how come you can come in a meeting hear a wonderful preacher but the preacher ain't even started preaching yet the anointing is all over the building it's because people come to church they spend time praying all week for the service they make sacrifice for it they sit down on the bench they're praying they're worshiping the Lord the first words out of the preacher's mouth Amen brother amen praise the Lord and they're such an anointing in the building why it's because we're channels so I say Lord let me be that can you say that tonight I'm going to close can you say Lord let me just be a channel what's been wrong in my life it's scarecrows that put that brought you to a stopping place but brother Mark don't don't don't let it stop you just be a channel for the Lord so then when the word Goes Forth you watch what happens you realize that saying that saying Amen brother Mark it does something he said see there was a lady in in one of brother bram's meetings it was a Spanish lady she couldn't speak English but the spirit of the Lord began to move and they all moved the same way he pointed it out in the audience you can hear it on tape he said isn't it odd that they don't even know what I'm saying but the same reaction that y'all had is the same reaction they had showing that it was anointing of the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Spirit they were worshiping it wasn't a man they were worshiping they did before even before it was even interpreted they were already worshiping God and when he said that there was a lady in the congregation that said amen and he turned to him and he said why did you say amen for sitting right there he said do you believe that your sinus trouble is going to believe you you do well then stand to your feet it leaves you in the name of Jesus Christ and the audience you can hear the the the audience of our peers that was sitting there that day what was it one person sitting there just because they would say Amen to the word of God something that God spoke and they said amen to it and it healed their body you know what it does m to think that God would do something for you just for backing the word of God that's what he's looking for he's looking for people that he's looking for some Davids in this hour that say God let me be a channel let me hear the word of God don't let me just let it bottle up but let me scream out with all that I have amen so be it Hallelujah that's th sayeth the Lord let me speak it out of my mouth that's God's word he says you're you're by his stpes you're healed the bride says amen he says they'll be delivered you say Amen at the preaching of the word of God homes will change and lives will be made whole amen and amen we say Amen to the word of God that his power it didn't just stoved up in us let it release its power you realize the power that you have my friends I I'm not halfway to where I wanted to go but to be a channel for the Lord can you make that commitment to God tonight say Lord let me come to let me come to church on Sunday let me be a channel make a note of it when you go home now this is your commitment to God how many bow your head and lift your hand say Lord I want to make that commitment don't let me stop it up don't let me be that don't me let scarecrows and things stop up my life every hand in this building is raised God bless you that I can see mine too Lord let me be a channel that you can
