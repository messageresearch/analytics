[36:44] morning. He said he was saving it up for
[36:46] Wednesday night. How many heard that?
[36:48] Well, the whole church. So, we're
[36:49] looking forward to it tonight. Amen.
[36:51] Just allow the Lord to have his way in
[36:53] in the service. Want to remember
[36:55] Samantha Farmer's grandmother, Carolyn
[36:57] Gan is in the hospital from a snake
[37:00] bite. Just ask the Lord to touch her
[37:04] this evening. If you have something in
[37:06] your heart or something you have need of
[37:08] tonight, won't you just lift your hand
[37:09] to the Lord?
[37:10] I know God knows what we have need of
[37:12] tonight. We just want to trust him.
[37:14] Let's just bow our heads together.

[38:03] Amen. Do you believe that tonight? Amen.
[38:05] You love the Lord. He's more than able.
[38:07] Amen. I want you just turn around and
[38:09] greet somebody tonight in the name of
[38:11] the Lord. And if you've already shook
[38:13] hands, just wave at them. And so we just

[38:19] hear the word of God. Amen. How many
[38:21] loves coming to church? Amen. How I
[38:23] said, how many loves coming to church?
[38:25] Amen. You must. Half of y'all drove five
[38:27] hours today, then turned around and came
[38:29] right back to church. Amen. God bless
[38:31] you tonight. I know some are tired in
[38:33] their body, but uh we just look for for
[38:35] God to move in a special way. Hey, I
[38:37] know brother Andrew uh drove all the way
[38:40] uh this way today as well and and just
[38:42] ask the Lord to give him strength and
[38:44] allow him just to deliver what's on his
[38:46] heart tonight for our good. Amen. Amen.
[38:48] Let's just sing uh let the worshippers
[38:52] arise.
[38:56] Oh, Father, I see that you are drawing
[39:00] a line in the sand. I want to be
[39:04] standing by your side.
[39:08] Hold in your hand. Let your kingdom
[39:12] come.
[39:14] Let it live in me. This is my prayer.
[39:20] This is my plea. Let the worshippers
[39:24] arise.
[39:28] [Applause]
[39:29] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[39:36] I'm surrendering my all.
[39:42] Yes, I surrender to the king.
[39:46] [Music]
[39:48] Father, I hear it growing louder.
[39:52] The song of the redeemed
[39:55] as the saints of every nation
[39:58] are awakening to sing. From our hearts
[40:02] there comes an anthem. Oh, hear the
[40:06] praises ring. This is our song.

[40:44] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[40:50] I'm surrendering my all.
[40:55] Yes, my Lord. I surrender to the King.
[41:01] Oh father, I hear it growing louder.
[41:06] It's the song of your redeemed as the
[41:09] bride out of every nation is awakening
[41:14] to sing. How many sing it from their
[41:16] heart tonight? There sings an anthem.
[41:20] Hear the praises ring. This is our song.
[41:24] I sing to my king. Let the worippers
[41:29] arrive.
[41:34] Let the sons and the daughter sing.
[41:37] Oh yes.

[41:45] Oh,
[41:47] I surrender to the king.
[41:53] Amen. How many can give him a hand clap
[41:54] of praise? Amen. He is worthy to be
[41:58] praised here this evening. Amen. For his
[42:01] mercy and his goodness. And Amen. I tell
[42:03] you tonight, we've come to worship him.
[42:05] Amen. There's there's no one else
[42:07] deserving of worship outside of our Lord
[42:09] and Savior Jesus Christ. He's the King
[42:12] of Kings. He's the Lord of Lords. He's
[42:14] He's the God and he's God alone. Amen. I
[42:17] want to say God bless you all tonight.
[42:19] It is a real honor to be in here in the
[42:21] house of God once again with you and we
[42:23] just pray uh everyone's had a good day
[42:25] and we thank the Lord as brother Matt
[42:27] said for safe travels back and amen I've
[42:29] got to uh correct a little something he
[42:32] said there I didn't drive back my wife
[42:34] did so I got to make sure Amen she gets
[42:36] the credit for that but uh amen we were
[42:39] working away but amen it is real honor
[42:41] to be here tonight be home with you and
[42:43] speaking to you tonight and sure was a
[42:45] wonderful time on the trip and amen I
[42:47] just thank the Lord for good godly ly
[42:49] fellowship, amen, where believers can
[42:51] get together and amen fellowship the
[42:53] Lord and fellowship with each other and
[42:55] enjoy the things of God and enjoy each
[42:56] other's fellowship. And we sure thank
[42:58] the Lord for a safe time and his hand
[43:00] upon every life. And as we come here
[43:02] tonight, I know there's many needs among
[43:04] us. I wonder how many say, "Lord, just
[43:06] speak to me tonight." Amen. I know he
[43:08] sees every hand and he knows every need.
[43:10] Let's just approach him tonight, shall
[43:11] we? Heavenly Father,
[43:13] Lord, as your believers have gathered
[43:15] here this afternoon on this Wednesday
[43:17] evening, Father, we've not gathered here
[43:19] out of former fashion, Lord. We've not
[43:21] gathered here just out of a tradition,
[43:23] Lord, or to, as it would be said, to
[43:26] fill a religious time clock and punch
[43:28] the time clock, Lord. But, Father, we've
[43:30] gathered here tonight because we're your
[43:32] believing children. And Lord, we believe
[43:34] the things that your word has spoken and
[43:36] been revealed to our hearts in this age.
[43:38] Now Lord, as we come here tonight, you
[43:40] know the needs, Father. Lord, if it
[43:42] would be sicknesses, oh God, if it would
[43:44] be, Lord, confusions, whatever the
[43:47] situations may be, Lord, we know that
[43:49] your word is still a discerner of the
[43:51] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[43:53] Lord, we know your word is still a
[43:55] healer. It's still a deliverer, oh God.
[43:57] And Lord, as we're turning now our focus
[43:59] and attention to your word, we invite
[44:01] you to come among us tonight. Lord, may
[44:04] you be the speaker here tonight. May you
[44:06] speak through me, Father. Lord, may you
[44:08] hear through the believers here tonight.
[44:09] And I pray if there be any, Lord, one
[44:12] here tonight that don't know you in the
[44:13] power of your resurrection, I pray this
[44:15] would be the night, oh God, Lord, that
[44:17] they would break beyond the confusions
[44:19] and break beyond the unbelief, oh God,
[44:21] and they would step out of that realm of
[44:23] faith where all things are possible.
[44:26] Lord, if there be one here tonight, sick
[44:27] and body, I pray that as your word goes
[44:29] forth tonight, Lord, may your great
[44:32] anointed word, powerful word, may yet
[44:34] curse that sickness, oh God. And Lord,
[44:36] may you break the grip of that disease,
[44:38] Father, for those that are home, Lord,
[44:40] listening by way of the internet. I
[44:42] pray, Lord, that your angel would pass
[44:44] through their homes, oh God. And Lord,
[44:46] may you put the hand of sickness at
[44:48] stay, Father. Lord, may deliverance come
[44:50] into those bodies. I pray, Lord, may you
[44:53] open the windows of heaven tonight, God.
[44:55] And may you send anointing and
[44:56] inspiration into the building, Lord. And
[44:58] we surrender our hearts unto you
[45:00] tonight, God. Forgive us of our
[45:01] failures, Lord. Forgive us of our
[45:03] shortcomings. draw us closer unto
[45:05] thyself and we'll be sure to give thee
[45:07] all the praise, all the honor, and all
[45:09] the glory in the wonderful name of our
[45:11] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray
[45:14] and all the believers says, "Amen and
[45:18] amen." God bless you this evening. If
[45:20] you have your Bibles, we want to go into
[45:22] the word of the Lord to the book of
[45:23] Hebrews, the 11th chapter. The book of
[45:26] Hebrews, the 11th chapter. And then
[45:28] we're going to turn over to the book of
[45:29] James, the 2 chapter. Amen. Everybody
[45:32] love the Lord tonight. Amen. Amen.
[45:35] Hebrews chap 11 and verse number 31. We
[45:38] were speaking to you here uh Sunday
[45:41] morning under the influence of the token
[45:42] message. And I just want tonight to
[45:44] maybe take a little bit more of that if
[45:46] that'd be okay. In Hebrews chapter 11
[45:49] and verse 31, Paul here writing now he's
[45:53] wrote about Moses and he's wrote about
[45:55] Enoch and he's wrote about Noah and
[45:57] Abraham. And it amazes me that there is
[46:00] a woman in this uh heroes of faith or
[46:03] this honor role in verse 31. It amazes
[46:06] me but it's just the grace of God. By
[46:10] faith the harlot Rahab perished not with
[46:12] them. Notice here that believe not for
[46:16] when she had received the spies with
[46:19] peace. By faith the harlot Rahab
[46:22] perished not with them that believe not.
[46:25] when she had received the spies with
[46:28] peace. In the book of James the 2
[46:30] chapter, James chapter 2 in verse number
[46:34] 24. Uh James here writing he says in
[46:38] verse 24, "Ye see then how that by works
[46:41] a man is justified and not by faith
[46:44] only. Likewise also was not Rahab the
[46:48] harlot justified by works, when she had
[46:51] received the messengers, and had sent
[46:54] them out another way. For as the body
[46:57] without the spirit is dead, so faith
[47:01] without works is dead also. Now, when
[47:04] you look there and break that down,
[47:06] faith is believing what the prophet
[47:08] said, but works is obeying what the
[47:11] prophet said. We ask the Lord this
[47:13] evening to bless the reading of his
[47:14] word. As you can have your seat here
[47:16] this afternoon, if I would uh take a
[47:18] title tonight, I want to speak to you on
[47:20] this Rahab the influencer. Rahab the
[47:24] influencer. And as I said on Sunday, we
[47:26] were speaking there on the under the
[47:28] influence of the toolken message in
[47:30] Exodus 12. uh just to just to lay a
[47:32] foundation here. Said, "I will pass
[47:34] through the land of Egypt this night and
[47:36] will smite all the firstborn in the land
[47:38] of Egypt, both man and beast, and
[47:40] against all the gods of Egypt, I will
[47:42] execute judgment, for I am the Lord."
[47:45] But then I love what he speaks
[47:46] prophetically there. He says, "And the
[47:49] blood shall be to you for a token."
[47:51] Amen. Upon the houses where you are, and
[47:54] when I see the blood, I will pass over
[47:57] you. Isn't that powerful? When I see the
[48:00] blood, I will pass over you. And the
[48:02] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[48:04] you when I smite the land of Egypt. Now,
[48:08] when you look here at this word token,
[48:09] amen, just to refresh our memories, it's
[48:11] a signal. It's a sign. It's a
[48:14] distinguishing mark. It's a banner. It's
[48:16] a remembrance. It's a miraculous sign.
[48:19] It's a warning, a token, an in sign.
[48:21] It's a standard. It's a miracle. It's a
[48:23] proof. Now, amen. If we go back in
[48:25] Exodus 12, you will find that to Israel,
[48:28] amen, the literal blood of the of the
[48:31] lamb was the token that was to be
[48:32] applied. But the prophet of God says to
[48:35] us that the animal, amen, did not have a
[48:37] soul. So therefore, amen, the life could
[48:40] not come back up on the worshipper. But
[48:42] today, the church must have a token. He
[48:45] said, now what is the token? He said the
[48:47] token is the life that was in Christ.
[48:50] Amen. Is now on display in the believer.
[48:53] He said under this covenant there is a
[48:55] difference between the blood and the
[48:57] life. See, amen. The token for the
[49:00] believer today, amen, is the Holy Ghost.
[49:03] It's not a blood. It's not a chemistry,
[49:06] but it is the Holy Spirit of God. Amen.
[49:09] That is the token that God requires,
[49:12] amen, of the church today. Amen. God
[49:15] must see this token. Amen. He must see
[49:18] it in every one of us. Amen. Now, that's
[49:21] a that's bringing it way down, folks.
[49:23] said he can't just be seen in the
[49:24] prophet of the age. It can't just be
[49:26] seen in the pastor or in the ministry.
[49:29] But this token has got to be on display
[49:32] in every one of us. Now, as the prophet
[49:34] said, it's so beautiful. Amen. The token
[49:36] never come into existence. Amen. Until
[49:39] the evening time. He said, now this is
[49:42] the evening time of the age. It's the
[49:44] evening time for the church. He said,
[49:46] it's the evening time for me. Amen. It's
[49:48] the evening time of my message. I'm
[49:51] dying. I'm going out. I'm moving out.
[49:53] It's the evening time of the gospel. And
[49:55] we've come up through, amen,
[49:57] justification and so forth. Amen. But
[50:00] this is the time, amen, that the token
[50:03] has to be applied. He said, "Now, I told
[50:05] you last Sunday I had something I want
[50:07] to talk to you about." And he said,
[50:09] "This is it." See, amen. The time when
[50:12] you can't just play with it. Amen. It's
[50:14] got to be done. if it's ever going to be
[50:16] done. Amen. It's got to be done now
[50:20] because we can see the wrath is about
[50:22] ready to pass through the land. And
[50:24] everything from under that token, amen,
[50:27] will perish because the blood is what
[50:30] identifies you safe, amen, from the
[50:32] angel of death that's passing through
[50:34] the land. Now, I'll just say this. We
[50:36] ought to be able to raise our hands and
[50:37] say, "Thank God." Amen. We are
[50:39] underneath the influence, amen, of the
[50:42] token message. Thank God we're not just
[50:44] here saying I believe the message. Amen.
[50:47] But we're obeying the message or amen by
[50:49] coming into Christ. I I love what the
[50:51] prophet of God said. He said we're not
[50:53] come together to talk about the message.
[50:55] We are come together to get in the
[50:57] message and the message is Christ. Amen.
[51:01] He is the word. Amen. Amen. That's
[51:04] right. We're to get into it and we're to
[51:06] get beneath it. Now, amen. As I as I
[51:08] shared this with you on Sunday, I just
[51:10] want to say it again. Amen. An
[51:12] influencer, amen, is a person who is
[51:14] able, amen, to generate interest in
[51:17] something. So, amen, they have the
[51:19] ability, amen, to raise the interest of
[51:22] people, amen, into what they're trying
[51:24] to represent. And I love what the
[51:26] prophet of God said. He said, I'm trying
[51:28] to warn you or tell you that there's a
[51:30] token in this hour. And the token is our
[51:33] identification. He said, identific
[51:36] identification with our sacrifice. Amen.
[51:39] That the life of our savior. Amen. is in
[51:42] us which is the Holy Spirit. Oh, what a
[51:45] positive token. Amen. There cannot be
[51:48] any more token. If you could only catch
[51:50] the thought, if I had the power this
[51:52] morning with words, amen, to express and
[51:55] place it into your soul. Amen. That's on
[51:57] you. Amen. Not your ears, but your soul.
[52:00] Amen. Then you could see, Amen, the
[52:03] guarantee of it. Now, I'm not going to
[52:05] stop here and preach again, but it makes
[52:07] you relaxed. Amen. If the token ever
[52:10] comes into your soul, amen, it brings
[52:12] you underneath the influence of it and
[52:15] it makes you relax. Now, I love what the
[52:17] prophet said. He said the token was a
[52:19] sign, amen, of ownership, amen. In other
[52:22] words, who does this house belong to?
[52:24] Amen. Does it belong to Jehovah or does
[52:27] it belong to the gods of Egypt? Does it
[52:29] belong to God or does it belong to
[52:30] Leosa? And I can hear Joshua say, "Amen.
[52:34] As for me and my house, Amen. We're
[52:37] going to serve the Lord. And the prophet
[52:39] of God come along and said, "There's a
[52:41] reproach, amen, for the cause of the
[52:43] word." He said, "But here's my closing
[52:45] statement to you. As for me and my
[52:47] house, Amen. We're going to serve the
[52:50] word." Listen, we're not serving a
[52:52] denomination. We're not serving a creed.
[52:55] We're not serving a bunch of preachers.
[52:56] Amen. We're serving the word. Amen.
[52:59] Therefore, the token is laying over the
[53:01] body. It's laying over the soul. And he
[53:04] said, "See the token over there, which
[53:06] is the Holy Spirit, Amen, says it
[53:09] belongs to God." Well, you ought to tell
[53:12] that devil right now, I belong to God.
[53:14] Amen. Amen. My praise belongs to God.
[53:17] Amen. My body belongs to God. Amen.
[53:20] Everything I am belongs to God. If I've
[53:22] got anything, it all belongs to God.
[53:25] Amen. Because he's the one that died.
[53:27] He's the one that shed his blood. He's
[53:29] the one that gave me the baptism of the
[53:31] Holy Ghost. I don't belong to
[53:33] depression. I don't belong to
[53:35] condemnation. I don't belong to guilt. I
[53:38] don't belong to depression. I don't
[53:40] belong to nervousness. I belong to God.
[53:43] And the token is upon my soul as an
[53:46] identification.
[53:48] I belong to him. See, when I see the
[53:51] token, I'll pass over you. Amen. What is
[53:54] it? It's a positive token. Amen. The
[53:56] Holy Spirit is our token. He said,
[53:59] "Therefore, when you receive the Holy
[54:02] Ghost, you have passed, amen, from death
[54:05] to life." How many's got the Holy Ghost?
[54:07] Amen. If you got the Holy Ghost, you
[54:10] have passed, Amen, from death into life.
[54:13] Amen. And you can no more perish. Now,
[54:15] let me just say what a prophet said. He
[54:18] said, "The Bible said, "He that's born
[54:19] of God, Amen, does not commit sin."
[54:24] I know the legalist hate this, but let's
[54:26] just go ahead and preach. We drove all
[54:27] the way over here. Amen. Does not commit
[54:30] sin for he cannot sin for the seed of
[54:33] God remains in him. Now, how can he sin
[54:38] when the sinless God is in him? When he
[54:41] is in a sinless God, then how can he
[54:44] sin? No matter what he's done, the blood
[54:47] has covered him. See, he's a new
[54:50] creature. His desires and ambitions is
[54:53] of heaven because he has changed. Amen.
[54:57] From a cocka bird to a wheat. His
[54:59] desires ain't the same as they was.
[55:02] Amen. Now watch this. And he displays
[55:04] it. You say, "Oh, I believe that." And
[55:07] you're still sinning. Brother said, "No,
[55:10] you never received." Amen. You're
[55:12] deceived. Amen. See, it cannot display
[55:14] nothing. Amen. But the token. Amen. I'll
[55:18] say this. If the token was not on
[55:20] display, it didn't matter how much they
[55:23] knew the covenant. Amen. the covenant
[55:25] was a null as long as the token was not
[55:28] on display. He said there might have
[55:30] been many of Jews could say, "Come here.
[55:32] I ain't got no blood on my door, but I
[55:34] want to show you something. I'm a Jew
[55:36] circumcised." That didn't mean that much
[55:39] with God. He say, "Well, I'm a Baptist.
[55:41] I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Methodist or
[55:43] whatever you want to be." Amen. But when
[55:46] I see the toolken, you say, "Well, I'm a
[55:48] believer and my mother was a member of
[55:50] this church and my daddy was a member of
[55:52] this church and I've been a member there
[55:54] since I was a child." He said, "That
[55:56] don't mean that. I don't lie. I don't
[55:58] steal. I don't do this." He snaps his
[56:00] finger again and said, "That don't mean
[56:03] this." He said, "I belong to the Brandom
[56:05] Tabernacle." Amen. I do this, that, or
[56:07] the other. Amen. I believe all the word.
[56:09] The Jews could say, "I believe Jehovah."
[56:11] He'd have listened to the message of the
[56:13] hour if he did. Amen. They had a lot of
[56:16] messages. Amen. But this was the message
[56:19] of the hour. Let me just take a moment
[56:21] and say something to you. This is not
[56:23] just another religion. This message is
[56:26] not just a better idea. It's not a book
[56:28] on the shelf. It's not a picture down at
[56:30] grandma's house. Hey, but this message
[56:33] is the message of the hour. He said,
[56:35] "And if you believe the message of the
[56:36] hour, then the blood will be applied to
[56:39] your house in the evening time." Now,
[56:41] Exodus chapter 12, I'll say this. That
[56:44] was more Amen. than a spiritual
[56:46] happening. Amen. Because every or a
[56:49] natural happening because every
[56:51] spiritual happening is a sign from God.
[56:54] Reb said it very beautifully. I just
[56:56] want to read this to you. He said,
[56:57] "We're not here by accident. These
[56:59] things just don't happen by accident.
[57:01] It's a sign to get to safety quickly."
[57:04] He said, "Everything, the message of the
[57:07] hour is a sign." He said, "No other time
[57:10] could this type of message ever happen.
[57:13] It could not have come in Luther's day.
[57:15] It could not have come in Wesley's day.
[57:17] It couldn't even come in Pentecostal
[57:19] day." Amen. There had been no such thing
[57:21] happened. Yet, we was promised in the
[57:24] Bible. Amen. See, we're at the end.
[57:26] Nothing could happen until this time. He
[57:29] said, "Oh, little people, my brother, my
[57:32] sister, get under the token quickly."
[57:35] See? Amen. And don't you take no
[57:37] substitute. Amen. Don't don't don't
[57:39] don't do that. See? Amen. Don't just
[57:42] imagine it. Amen. But you stay there
[57:45] until you know that the token is
[57:47] applied. Until your whole mind, Amen.
[57:50] that was in Christ. Amen. Be in you.
[57:53] Until all the nonsense of the world is
[57:56] gone, until the whole heart's desire is
[57:59] to see him, then you know something has
[58:02] happened. Amen. Because these signs,
[58:04] amen, shall follow them that believe.
[58:06] Amen. Not make believers but believers.
[58:09] So we don't want to take any chance.
[58:11] Amen. You must apply the token. I want
[58:15] to say this what the prophet said. He
[58:16] said what does the token mean? He said
[58:19] the token means assurance. Hey, and the
[58:22] token means assurance. Amen. First his
[58:26] prophet with the message. He identified
[58:28] himself. Amen. With a pillar of fire
[58:30] with his prophets. Amen. Then he sent a
[58:33] token to get under this blood that he
[58:36] had accepted the substitute. Amen. Death
[58:39] in your place. Then the blood was a
[58:41] token that he looked and you had heard
[58:44] the message. You had believed on the
[58:46] pillar of fire and you had accepted the
[58:48] substitutionary. He said, "Listen, what
[58:51] a perfect thing it is. You are under the
[58:54] blood." Now, all the way back in
[58:56] Israel's day when he seen the blood over
[58:58] the door, it was an assurance that the
[59:01] people who are under this house are not
[59:04] under anything else but the blood. But a
[59:06] prophet said, "But now, amen, you are
[59:09] under the spirit."
[59:12] Then you was under the blood. Amen. But
[59:15] now you were under the spirit. He said,
[59:17] "Under the Holy Spirit." You believe the
[59:20] message of the day. You see, you believe
[59:22] the power. You believe the pillar of
[59:24] fire? You believe that? See, now I want
[59:26] you to catch something. It was not the
[59:28] doing away of the blood. It was the life
[59:31] that was in the blood. Amen. An animal
[59:34] life could not come back upon any of us.
[59:36] Amen. But if the literal blood sale of
[59:39] almighty God, amen, that was broke for
[59:42] this generation would ever return upon
[59:44] the church. It would not bring a fear.
[59:47] It would not bring a scare. It would not
[59:49] bring condemnation. But the only thing
[59:51] that can remove the condemnation is the
[59:54] token. Oh church, Egypt, amen, was a
[59:57] type of the church. Amen. But Israel was
[59:59] a type of the bride. And I love what the
[1:00:01] prophet said. He said, "Remember, there
[1:00:03] was a lot of them come by them." Amen.
[1:00:05] He said, "You get under that token and
[1:00:07] you stay under it." Amen. There was a
[1:00:09] lot of them come by them women that
[1:00:11] night and said, "Hey, Gertie. Hey, Lily.
[1:00:13] Some of you come on out here." Amen.
[1:00:15] We're going to a party. She said,
[1:00:17] "Uh-uh. I'm under the blood. I'm under
[1:00:20] the token to stay here. He said, see,
[1:00:22] we've been keeping the lamb. Amen. But
[1:00:24] believers should now come underneath the
[1:00:27] blood of that lamb. He said, believers
[1:00:30] should separate themselves from the
[1:00:31] world. Amen. Don't just take it now
[1:00:34] lightly. Amen. Amen. Don't just take it
[1:00:37] now lightly. Amen. Listen. Don't Can I
[1:00:40] Can I say this to you? Don't take the
[1:00:42] message lightly. Amen. Don't take the
[1:00:46] message lightly. He only recognizes the
[1:00:49] token. He said, "That's the message of
[1:00:52] the hour. That's the message of this
[1:00:55] day. That's the message of this time."
[1:00:57] Hear a prophet now. In the name of Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ. Amen. In the name of Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ. Amen. Receive it. See? Amen. Not
[1:01:06] a substitute. Amen. Something the devil
[1:01:09] can place over on you like a phony love.
[1:01:11] Oh no. He said that's not real love.
[1:01:14] Amen. That's the devil and that's his
[1:01:16] works. He said, "But you stay there."
[1:01:19] Amen. Till God becomes your joy. He
[1:01:21] said, "God is your strength." Now listen
[1:01:24] folks, knowing the message, Amen.
[1:01:26] Knowing the truth, Amen. That's our
[1:01:29] sufficiency. Now, he is my all
[1:01:32] sufficiency in him. All things I have,
[1:01:36] Amen. need of is in him. Amen. That's
[1:01:38] our strength. He said, "My help cometh
[1:01:41] from the Lord." Amen. That's what David
[1:01:43] said, didn't he? He said, "My help,
[1:01:45] Amen, cometh from the Lord." He said,
[1:01:47] "You Christians, look to him for your
[1:01:49] joy. Look to him for your strength. Look
[1:01:52] to him for your happiness. Look to him
[1:01:54] for your peace. He is my joy. He is my
[1:01:57] love. He is my life." He said, "That's a
[1:01:59] covenant." Amen. The token upon the
[1:02:03] door. Amen. The token upon the door.
[1:02:07] Now, I want to say this to you. Amen.
[1:02:10] the whole family. Amen. Must be brought
[1:02:13] underneath the token. In Joshua chapter
[1:02:16] 2, you can read it there. And if you get
[1:02:18] time in Joshua 2, Joshua 5, and Joshua
[1:02:21] 6, you can read the whole account, amen,
[1:02:24] of this woman named Rahab. But in
[1:02:26] Hebrews 11:31, Paul picks it up and he
[1:02:29] says, "By faith," Amen. Which faith is
[1:02:32] revelation, right?
[1:02:34] By revelation, Amen. the harlot Rahab.
[1:02:37] Amen. She perished not with them that
[1:02:40] believe not when she had received. Amen.
[1:02:43] The spies with peace. Now, I love how
[1:02:45] Brother Bam describes this. He says,
[1:02:47] "We're all acquainted with the story of
[1:02:49] Rahab the harlot." He said, "Now, let's
[1:02:52] picture her this morning." Amen. For a
[1:02:54] few minutes now, as a young lady, a
[1:02:56] beautiful young woman whose misfortune
[1:02:59] in life, amen, she had been forced in.
[1:03:02] He said, "Now being a pagan and had been
[1:03:04] forced into the life that she was
[1:03:06] living," he says, "And many times, amen,
[1:03:09] people are forced into the life that
[1:03:12] they live." Now, I want to say this, uh,
[1:03:14] for some reason, even though we know the
[1:03:16] powerful things that God done for Rahab,
[1:03:18] and we know how God used her, for some
[1:03:21] reason, we still automatically say Rahab
[1:03:24] the harlot. Amen. But I want to change
[1:03:26] that tonight. And I want to call Rahab,
[1:03:29] the believing Gentile, the influencer.
[1:03:32] Is that okay? Amen. Rahab, the believing
[1:03:35] Gentile, the believing influencer.
[1:03:38] Brother Bram said it in the token. He
[1:03:40] said she was a believer. He said, now
[1:03:43] all her family had to get underneath
[1:03:45] that scarlet streak, amen, which was the
[1:03:47] token. He said, now they had heard,
[1:03:50] amen, of the wrath of God. They had
[1:03:52] heard of the displaying signs and the
[1:03:55] miracles of God among his people and
[1:03:57] they had to receive it. He said, "Now,
[1:04:00] she had to receive it." Amen. Because
[1:04:02] God, amen, destroying angel was coming
[1:04:05] through and they knew it. And Joshua was
[1:04:08] that angel. Now listen. And they were
[1:04:10] right in line. Amen. And Joshua's path
[1:04:13] of destruction. Amen. So is every nation
[1:04:16] in the world. Amen. In the line of God's
[1:04:18] judgment. He said, "But this little old
[1:04:20] harlot." Amen. Amen. She had heard and
[1:04:23] he said, "Faith cometh by hearing."
[1:04:25] Amen. And hearing by the word of God. He
[1:04:28] said, "Now all," now notice what Rahab
[1:04:30] said. She said, "All the country is
[1:04:33] disturbed by Joshua." Amen. That's
[1:04:35] right. Re said, "See, but Rahab wanted
[1:04:37] to live." Amen. Amen. Rahab didn't want
[1:04:40] to die. Amen. Rahab didn't want to
[1:04:42] perish. Amen. Rahab wanted to live. Re
[1:04:45] said it very beautiful. He said Jericho,
[1:04:48] which is a type of denomination, had
[1:04:51] heard what God was doing. Amen. But they
[1:04:54] did not take warning. He said, of his
[1:04:56] great power and his great signs that had
[1:04:58] been displayed. Amen. What he done.
[1:05:00] Amen. He crossed right through the Red
[1:05:02] Sea. Right.
[1:05:04] As if it was on dry land. And he caused
[1:05:07] and created things. He made frogs and he
[1:05:09] made lice and he made fleas. Amen. Come
[1:05:11] in the air. Now, how did he do this? He
[1:05:14] created them by his word. Amen. Through
[1:05:17] his prophets. That's a powerful point.
[1:05:20] Amen. God created things. Amen. By his
[1:05:24] word. Amen. Through his prophets. Well,
[1:05:27] you remember that by his word. But it
[1:05:30] was through his prophets. They knew it.
[1:05:32] And Rahab said, "I have heard of that. I
[1:05:35] don't want to perish with these
[1:05:36] unbelievers." No, sir. Amen. So, what
[1:05:39] did these messengers do? They made a way
[1:05:42] of escape. Amen. For her to escape the
[1:05:46] judgment and the wrath that was on its
[1:05:48] way. I can't help but say it like this.
[1:05:50] Brother David Paul that predestination
[1:05:53] made a way of escape for a harlot by the
[1:05:56] name of Rahab. Amen. Listen. Them
[1:05:58] messengers come in there. Brother said,
[1:06:00] "What happened?" He said, "They were all
[1:06:02] shut up." He said, "But there must have
[1:06:04] been some tape boys." Hell, hallelujah.
[1:06:07] Hey, there must have been some tape
[1:06:09] boys. Amen. That slipped in there. Amen.
[1:06:12] Somewhere. Now, why did those tape boys
[1:06:14] come in there? They came in there for
[1:06:17] the predestinated seed. They slipped
[1:06:20] over to her house and they played some
[1:06:22] tapes. Now, listen. And she made her own
[1:06:25] house a church to receive the message.
[1:06:31] Rahab, a harlot with a predestinated
[1:06:34] seed.
[1:06:36] Hallelujah. with a predestinated seed on
[1:06:40] the inside of her heart. She made her
[1:06:43] house a church to receive the message.
[1:06:46] Now, Amen. That's a Amen. Amen.
[1:06:50] That's a That's a beautiful thing laying
[1:06:52] there. Amen. That's a beautiful
[1:06:54] revelation that there was a
[1:06:55] predestinated seed that made her house a
[1:06:59] place to receive the message when there
[1:07:02] were no other churches. Amen. I know the
[1:07:05] devil got a hold of that and the devil's
[1:07:08] taken a whole move around our message
[1:07:10] and everybody just stay home and play a
[1:07:12] tape because remember, Amen. Rahab
[1:07:15] played a tape cuz there was no other
[1:07:17] churches. You're exactly right. Amen.
[1:07:19] But now the devil has misinterpreted
[1:07:22] that and we got people sitting at home.
[1:07:24] Amen. playing tapes and calling their
[1:07:27] living room a house church when there's
[1:07:29] five churches within 30 minutes of them
[1:07:31] and they ain't even got the guts cuz
[1:07:33] they're underneath a lazy spirit to get
[1:07:35] up out of bed and go in the house of
[1:07:37] God. I'll tell you what that is. That's
[1:07:39] a layout of sin, lukewarm devil and it's
[1:07:42] crawled up out of the pits of hell and
[1:07:44] it has disguised itself behind the
[1:07:46] greatest message that ever hit the face
[1:07:49] of the earth. But if I am a man and this
[1:07:51] is a church, I know what William
[1:07:53] Brandham taught. He said, "Every time
[1:07:55] the doors are open, you can't wait for
[1:07:57] them doors to get open so you can get in
[1:08:00] there."
[1:08:02] Come on. You can get in there and you
[1:08:04] can fellowship and you can worship God.
[1:08:06] Now, now I know I know a lot of people
[1:08:10] they leave a very important part of that
[1:08:12] quote out.
[1:08:14] And I want to put it in there. Okay, can
[1:08:17] I do that? He said, "If God is in your
[1:08:20] heart,
[1:08:22] if God is in your heart, you can't wait
[1:08:26] for them church doors to open to get
[1:08:29] inside there and fellowship with your
[1:08:32] brothers and your sisters." Well, we've
[1:08:34] just fixed a big problem. God ain't in
[1:08:37] their hearts. Therefore, they can wait.
[1:08:39] But if God is in your heart, you can't
[1:08:41] wait for Wednesday night. You can't wait
[1:08:43] for Sunday morning. You can't wait for a
[1:08:46] good old-fashioned meeting where the
[1:08:48] power of God has fallen and the pillar
[1:08:50] of fire is moving. You know why? Because
[1:08:52] you're a believing Gentile that had a
[1:08:55] predestinated seed on the inside of your
[1:08:58] heart. Hallelujah. He said they they
[1:09:01] they shut everything up. He said, "But
[1:09:03] the message got to the predestinated
[1:09:06] seed anyhow." He said, "We don't know
[1:09:09] how it got there, but it got there so
[1:09:12] that the just will not perish with the
[1:09:14] unjust." He said, "And God is seen to
[1:09:18] that today."
[1:09:21] Any anybody, he says, that knows
[1:09:24] anything about Rahab the harlot knows
[1:09:27] she was predestinated.
[1:09:30] Amen. Brother said, "Sure, she was."
[1:09:33] Yeah.
[1:09:35] And she perished not with them who
[1:09:37] believe not. Now, can I just say what a
[1:09:40] prophet said, he said she believed the
[1:09:44] message of the hour. Now listen, Rahab
[1:09:48] and God give her a sign by those
[1:09:50] messengers. Now, Brother Brian, I've
[1:09:52] I've often got to thinking and studying
[1:09:54] this. Has it ever has it ever dawned on
[1:09:56] you that Joshua's messengers did not
[1:09:59] bring the scarlet cord? Come on. They
[1:10:02] did not carry, Amen, the scarlet cord
[1:10:05] over to Rahab's house and give her the
[1:10:07] scarlet cord and say, "Here's you a
[1:10:09] token." But when they got in Rahab's
[1:10:12] house, the scarlet cord was already
[1:10:14] there. Amen. Can y'all can y'all
[1:10:17] fellowship with me for a second? Amen.
[1:10:19] How many spring cleanings had they had
[1:10:21] in that house and thought, "We need to
[1:10:23] get rid of that." But there was
[1:10:25] something would not let them throw that
[1:10:27] good old-fashioned Holy Ghost gospel
[1:10:29] away because they knew there was a day
[1:10:31] coming when God was going to birth a
[1:10:34] church beyond the Pentecostal age into
[1:10:36] an adoption age. Come on, folks. Brother
[1:10:39] Brandham stood on the platform and he
[1:10:41] said, "This is my message. It's an
[1:10:43] adoption message. You've got the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost. You're shouting and speaking in
[1:10:47] tongues, but you can't even get the
[1:10:49] makeup off your face and you can't even
[1:10:51] kick the high heels out.
[1:10:54] Come on. That's what a prophet did. He
[1:10:56] separated Pentecostal age from the bride
[1:10:59] age and said Pentecost had the Holy
[1:11:02] Ghost, but they didn't have no headship.
[1:11:06] Come on. They didn't have no headship of
[1:11:08] the Holy Ghost. Remember Abraham had
[1:11:09] that vision or that dream there and he
[1:11:11] said, "There I was." And he said, "I saw
[1:11:13] that Pentecostal woman and she was
[1:11:15] walking up the road in them high heel
[1:11:17] shoes and she turned around and she
[1:11:20] said, "I'm just fine." He said, "You
[1:11:22] can't walk this road in a pair of high
[1:11:24] heel shoes." And you know what he said?
[1:11:27] He said, "I saw her and she fell off the
[1:11:30] deep end." Come on, folks. No doubt that
[1:11:33] woman had shouted. No doubt she had
[1:11:35] spoken tongues. No doubt she had seen
[1:11:37] visions and probably prophesied. But
[1:11:39] when it come to the headship of the
[1:11:41] word, she could not bring herself
[1:11:44] underneath an obedience of a word. But I
[1:11:46] say unto you, great tabernacle, we ought
[1:11:49] to be a church that no matter what a
[1:11:51] prophet says, no matter how hard it is,
[1:11:54] no matter how hot it is, no matter how
[1:11:56] unpoper it is, if a prophet said it, I
[1:11:59] pray God give us some believers who will
[1:12:01] believe it and will stand with it and
[1:12:03] will do it. If it shuts the hide off of
[1:12:05] them, they'll say, "I refuse, hey, to
[1:12:07] become unidentifiedly out of sin. I am a
[1:12:11] son of God. I am a daughter of God, and
[1:12:13] I am underneath the token.
[1:12:17] Hallelujah. Rahab. Hallelujah. Re said
[1:12:21] they went in there and they said, "Now,
[1:12:23] Rahab, here's what Joshua said." Joshua
[1:12:26] said, "If you'll take that scarlet
[1:12:28] cord." All right. Come on, folks.
[1:12:31] Underneath Rahab's ideas, it was just a
[1:12:34] scarlet cord over in the corner. But
[1:12:36] underneath a prophet's word,
[1:12:39] underneath a prophet's word, it became a
[1:12:43] lifeline. Yes. Now, now you all know
[1:12:47] brother said them spies went over there
[1:12:49] and they said Rahab, they said take this
[1:12:52] scarlet cord and just hang it out the
[1:12:54] window. Brother said the same thing they
[1:12:57] escaped by was the same thing that saved
[1:13:01] Rahab. Abraham said, "I can see them
[1:13:04] spies as they start climbing down. I can
[1:13:07] see Rahab go over there and say, are you
[1:13:10] sure?
[1:13:12] Is this a guarantee? Are you sure? Bam
[1:13:16] said this. He said, "Rahab, every
[1:13:19] predestinated seed in here." Now listen,
[1:13:21] you get out there and go to hunting
[1:13:23] them. Amen.
[1:13:25] Church, that's powerful. He said, "You
[1:13:28] get out there and go to hunting them.
[1:13:29] Get your daddy. Get your mother. For
[1:13:32] we've just come out under that atonement
[1:13:35] down in Egypt and everything that we
[1:13:37] didn't have under the toolken parish.
[1:13:39] Rahab, I'm giving you a sign. It's a
[1:13:42] token. And I say in the name of the Lord
[1:13:45] as to say, if you will put that, I'm
[1:13:47] acquainted with the messenger. I'm
[1:13:50] acquainted with the angel of wrath,
[1:13:52] Joshua. He is God's destroying
[1:13:54] messenger. I'm acquainted with him. And
[1:13:57] he knows that there has to be a token
[1:14:00] sign. And you hang it out there. and
[1:14:03] I'll assure you
[1:14:06] you hang it out there and I'll take the
[1:14:08] oath. Now the same oath is today said I
[1:14:12] will not let you perish with them who
[1:14:14] doesn't believe the message.
[1:14:18] See she had heard the works that had
[1:14:21] been done and she believed in her father
[1:14:24] and her mother. Now listen and these
[1:14:26] fellas went in there these messengers
[1:14:28] and they caught that predestinated seed
[1:14:31] that believed. He said, "Now she used
[1:14:33] her house to receive the messengers." I
[1:14:36] want to say this. Everything that was
[1:14:40] under the token was safe when Joshua
[1:14:43] came to battle. Brother said, "When
[1:14:45] God's wrath destroyed that big city,"
[1:14:48] Amen. That token signed, it held her
[1:14:51] home safely. Glory to God. Brother Ed, I
[1:14:54] love how he says it. He said, "What
[1:14:56] happened?" He said, "God himself
[1:14:59] recognized his messengergers's message."
[1:15:02] Woo! Glory to God. You say, "Well, we
[1:15:05] believe the message, but so does God."
[1:15:07] When the angel come through when the
[1:15:10] angel come through Jericho and the
[1:15:12] entire city was going to be demolished
[1:15:15] and be put down to ruins. There was one
[1:15:18] little church on the side of the road.
[1:15:20] There was one little group of people on
[1:15:22] the side of the road that had a scarlet
[1:15:25] cord.
[1:15:27] Hallelujah. He said when all the rest of
[1:15:29] the city shut down, he said there stood
[1:15:32] Rahab's scarlet token over the door and
[1:15:35] the rest of them was gone. He said, now
[1:15:39] listen, many people think today because
[1:15:41] I belong to the church, I'm safely
[1:15:43] secure. He said, don't you believe such
[1:15:46] nonsense when the blood shall be a token
[1:15:49] to you. Now, I love this because Rahab,
[1:15:52] remember Isaiah 6, there were two uh
[1:15:55] there were there were twain he did fly.
[1:15:58] Twain he covered his face. Twain he
[1:16:00] covered his feet. And with Twain, he did
[1:16:03] fly.
[1:16:04] Can I say it like this? Rahab covered
[1:16:07] her face in reverence. Rahab covered her
[1:16:10] feet in humility. But she didn't stop
[1:16:13] there. The prophet of God said, "A
[1:16:15] gentile, are y'all hearing me? a harlot,
[1:16:18] a street walker. But she heard and
[1:16:22] believed and she applied the token. No
[1:16:25] matter how stooped you are in sin or
[1:16:28] what you have done, that doesn't have
[1:16:30] one thing to do with it. You apply the
[1:16:34] token. It's for you. If you're feeling
[1:16:37] in your heart and there's something
[1:16:38] tugging, it's for you. He said, "So just
[1:16:41] go ahead and apply the token." You say,
[1:16:44] "Brother Andrew, I've made too many
[1:16:46] mistakes and I've made too many blunders
[1:16:48] and and I've fallen short of the glory
[1:16:50] of God." Amen. Too many times. Amen. Can
[1:16:52] I say something to you tonight? Amen.
[1:16:55] Apply the token. Don't back off of these
[1:16:57] homie. Apply the token. And if you'll
[1:16:59] apply the token, it don't matter how far
[1:17:02] you've gone. It don't matter if you've
[1:17:04] been in the pits of hell. It don't
[1:17:05] matter if you've been in the desert or
[1:17:07] you've hid out in the mountains. If your
[1:17:09] name is on the lamb's book of life,
[1:17:12] there ain't a sin bad enough. There
[1:17:14] ain't a thing you can do hard enough or
[1:17:16] worse enough to remove your
[1:17:18] representation as an influencer
[1:17:21] underneath the token message.
[1:17:25] Amen. Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I just
[1:17:27] don't think I got much influence." Amen.
[1:17:29] Try telling the woman at the well that.
[1:17:32] Come on. tried telling the woman at the
[1:17:34] well that she didn't have much
[1:17:36] influence. Just a few minutes before she
[1:17:38] met the Messiah, there wasn't a kid
[1:17:40] would listen to her. There wasn't a man
[1:17:42] would listen to her.
[1:17:44] Come on, church. There was nobody would
[1:17:46] listen to her. You know what happened?
[1:17:48] The prophet of God said when she met the
[1:17:51] Messiah,
[1:17:53] she come underneath the message of her
[1:17:55] hour and she ran into the city.
[1:18:01] She ran into the city and said, "Come
[1:18:04] see a man
[1:18:07] who told me all things I ever done." I
[1:18:09] love what the prophet of God said. He
[1:18:11] said, "Listen, when Rahab obeyed the
[1:18:13] orders, there was a woman we found."
[1:18:16] Now, listen what they said. And when
[1:18:18] Joshua stood there, now here it is.
[1:18:20] Rahab's come underneath the message.
[1:18:22] She's underneath a token. Her family's
[1:18:25] underneath it. Rahab didn't get lazy,
[1:18:27] folks. When the token come, Leah Rahab
[1:18:30] got relaxed.
[1:18:33] But she didn't get lazy.
[1:18:36] What she done was she went and got her
[1:18:39] mama.
[1:18:41] Come on, mama. She went and got her
[1:18:43] daddy.
[1:18:46] Come on, daddy. She went and got her
[1:18:48] brothers and her sisters because Rahab
[1:18:51] was operating underneath a promise that
[1:18:54] whatever I get underneath this token
[1:18:57] will be spared in the hour of
[1:19:00] destruction. Oh church of the living
[1:19:02] God, I say that ought to put every one
[1:19:04] of us in this building into action
[1:19:06] tonight. Amen. Get up off of our ass
[1:19:08] heaps. Get up off of our penny parties.
[1:19:11] get up off of our this that and the
[1:19:12] other and go get our mothers and go get
[1:19:15] our brothers and go get our fathers and
[1:19:17] go get our sisters. The Lord is coming.
[1:19:21] There's a body change coming.
[1:19:23] Hallelujah. The the world is falling
[1:19:25] apart. Listen, folks. Israel is in war
[1:19:28] right now. At any minute, this thing
[1:19:30] could be over. I say get up off the ash
[1:19:33] heap, Job. I say get up off the penny
[1:19:35] party.
[1:19:37] Come on. I'm going to preach and you can
[1:19:38] sit there and look at me if you want to.
[1:19:40] It's time to get over it and get back in
[1:19:43] fellowship with the angel of the Lord.
[1:19:45] This thing can be over in the morning,
[1:19:47] folks.
[1:19:49] We're so wed up about this and wed up
[1:19:51] about that and this happened on the job.
[1:19:53] This happened in the house. This
[1:19:55] happened with the family. I say forget
[1:19:57] it all and come back underneath the
[1:19:59] influence of the message of the hour.
[1:20:04] Hallelujah. Re said, "Oh, there they
[1:20:07] were." He said, "On that morning, here
[1:20:09] come Joshua."
[1:20:11] Here come Joshua. They come marching in.
[1:20:14] Amen. Destruction was at hand. Now, can
[1:20:17] I show y'all something? And Rahab and
[1:20:20] her family and all her possession.
[1:20:24] Oh, God.
[1:20:28] Now, I'll just I'll just get it out
[1:20:30] there because I picked it up.
[1:20:33] All her possession Yes, sir. was
[1:20:36] underneath there. But there was one
[1:20:39] thing that mattered to her more, and
[1:20:41] that was her family.
[1:20:44] She didn't care about the possession.
[1:20:46] She didn't care about anything. She
[1:20:48] cared about her family. Can I say this?
[1:20:51] I think it's time, Amen, to remember
[1:20:53] that we're human
[1:20:55] and it's human to be offended, but it's
[1:20:58] divine to forgive. And sometimes if
[1:21:01] we're going to have influence with our
[1:21:03] families and with our loved ones, it's
[1:21:06] going to take a humility and an apology.
[1:21:10] Amen. And I was sorry. I was wrong.
[1:21:14] Forgive me.
[1:21:17] Now, come on, folks. Rahab was a harlot
[1:21:21] and she got her family underneath the
[1:21:24] token.
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:29] She was a harlot
[1:21:32] and she got her family by her influence.
[1:21:36] God, whatever
[1:21:39] was in that token had enough power to
[1:21:42] change everything about her that she was
[1:21:45] able to run to her mama. She was able to
[1:21:48] run to her daddy. She was able to run
[1:21:50] through the streets and she was able to
[1:21:53] generate an interest.
[1:21:56] She was able to generate an interest in
[1:21:58] their hearts to say, "Rahab, whatever
[1:22:01] you're under, I want to get under it,
[1:22:03] too." Hallelujah. And when they all,
[1:22:06] brother, when they all got underneath
[1:22:08] this token, now can I just say it? They
[1:22:13] weren't lazy.
[1:22:16] Brother Ram said, "Here come the
[1:22:17] battle." He said, "But what Rahab and
[1:22:19] his her family did was they just stood
[1:22:22] there.
[1:22:23] They didn't have to look out the window.
[1:22:27] Are y'all with me? The token is a
[1:22:30] guarantee.
[1:22:32] The token is an assurance. Are you
[1:22:35] hearing me? The token. Amen. The token
[1:22:38] is an identification that the angel of
[1:22:40] death cannot come nigh whatever is
[1:22:43] underneath that token. Brother said they
[1:22:45] didn't get up and go over there and say,
[1:22:48] "Is the token still there?"
[1:22:50] But the prophet of God said while the
[1:22:53] battle was going on, he said Rahab and
[1:22:56] her family were sitting together reading
[1:22:59] the scriptures.
[1:23:02] While the battle sister Nisha, while the
[1:23:04] battle was going on, while the houses
[1:23:08] were coming down, while lives were being
[1:23:11] killed, while kings were falling, while
[1:23:14] everything was going on around them,
[1:23:16] they weren't over there looking out the
[1:23:17] window and checking the news and trying
[1:23:20] to figure this out, trying to figure
[1:23:21] that out. They were in there and they
[1:23:24] were reading the scriptures.
[1:23:27] You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:23:29] "Them Israelites once settled there." He
[1:23:31] said, "Now listen, what if they would
[1:23:32] have got to studying and said, 'Well,
[1:23:34] I'm not worthy." Amen. What else do I
[1:23:37] have to do?
[1:23:39] Now, can I can I can I drop something to
[1:23:40] you? It's important what you study.
[1:23:43] Amen.
[1:23:45] It's important what you study cuz
[1:23:47] there's things you can study that'll get
[1:23:49] you to check in who you are. Amen.
[1:23:53] Because they're anointed from the pits
[1:23:54] of hell to do so. Come on. Y'all get mad
[1:23:57] at him if you want to, but I've gotten
[1:23:59] after before, so I'll take it again.
[1:24:01] Psychology is good in the doctor's
[1:24:02] office, but it don't belong in a pull
[1:24:05] pit. Cuz you start studying that
[1:24:07] nonsense. And before long, our boys will
[1:24:09] be questioned if they're boys. And our
[1:24:11] girls will be questioned if they're
[1:24:13] girls. I say there's only one thing that
[1:24:16] belongs before a preacher's eyes when
[1:24:18] he's studying to preach a sermon, and
[1:24:20] it's called the message of the hour.
[1:24:23] There's only one thing that belongs in
[1:24:26] our homes. It's called the message of
[1:24:28] the hour. There's only one thing that
[1:24:30] belongs in this pullpit and it's called
[1:24:33] the message of the hour. I said it to
[1:24:37] you Sunday. I'll say it again. I was
[1:24:39] confused until I heard the tapes. Oh,
[1:24:42] but when I heard the tapes, it broke the
[1:24:45] spirit of confusion off of my life
[1:24:47] because a prophet said, he said, "This
[1:24:50] Bible is the only thing that can tell
[1:24:52] you where you come from."
[1:24:55] Can tell you where you're at, and can
[1:24:57] tell you where you're going.
[1:25:01] Hallelujah. He said, "You don't have to
[1:25:03] do nothing. The only thing is to come
[1:25:05] under that shed blood once under the
[1:25:07] blood and you're safe." He said, "Now,
[1:25:09] what if the death angel with his sword
[1:25:12] in his hands and he was sweeping through
[1:25:14] the land, you didn't have to wonder
[1:25:18] and to now, can I say what a prophet
[1:25:20] said?" And to be scared was an insult to
[1:25:24] Jehovah. If a man once under the blood
[1:25:28] feels afraid that God will not keep his
[1:25:31] word, it's an insult to Jehovah. You
[1:25:35] say, "Well, Jehovah, perhaps this is
[1:25:37] your word, but I don't know whether it's
[1:25:40] right or not." Brother says, "Oh, shame
[1:25:43] on you."
[1:25:46] I say, "Lord, help us." Well, I once
[1:25:49] under the blood. I'm the Lord that
[1:25:51] health thee. That's all. Don't insult
[1:25:54] Jehovah. He said, "He that cometh unto
[1:25:57] me, I will in no wise cast out. I
[1:26:01] believe it." He said, "When you once
[1:26:04] come under the blood, you take his word
[1:26:07] for anything he says." Can I say what a
[1:26:11] prophet said? He said, "The greatest
[1:26:13] plague in the Christian church today is
[1:26:15] fear." He said, "The reason they're
[1:26:18] afraid is because they're not taught
[1:26:20] right and they're not settled right on
[1:26:23] the gospel." Now, I just want to get
[1:26:25] this out there and I want to make it
[1:26:27] very bold and very strong that fear is
[1:26:29] of the devil and fear is from the devil.
[1:26:34] Fear is of the devil and fear is from
[1:26:37] the devil. And I stand here tonight
[1:26:40] under a commission of almighty God to
[1:26:42] preach the word of God. And I rebuke
[1:26:45] every spirit of fear. I rebuke every
[1:26:48] spirit of nervousness. I rebuke every
[1:26:50] spirit of condemnation. If fear is upon
[1:26:53] you, if it's upon your house, if it's
[1:26:56] upon your wife, if it's upon your
[1:26:58] babies, it did not come from the token.
[1:27:00] It come from the devil. But God has got
[1:27:03] some messengers in the last days who
[1:27:06] will stand upon the earth and will
[1:27:08] declare the word of God without fear,
[1:27:10] without favor, or without compromise.
[1:27:13] Because this is not a fearful message.
[1:27:17] It's a message of rest. It's a message
[1:27:19] of faith. It's a message of peace.
[1:27:24] Hallelujah. I'll tell you what the Bible
[1:27:26] said. The Bible said, "God hath not
[1:27:29] given us the spirit of fear."
[1:27:32] He didn't give you the spirit of fear.
[1:27:34] He gave you the spirit of power and of
[1:27:37] love and of a sound mind. And if you've
[1:27:39] got anything less than that, you've got
[1:27:41] something the devil give you. But
[1:27:43] tonight's a good night to give it back.
[1:27:46] Tonight's a good night to hand the devil
[1:27:48] back his fear. Come on. I know what I'm
[1:27:51] talking about. That old demon of fear
[1:27:53] goes to creeping around homes and it
[1:27:55] gets on our little mamas and they start
[1:27:57] thinking they don't know how to raise
[1:27:58] their babies and they're wonderful.
[1:28:01] They're they're horrible mothers and
[1:28:03] they're going to fall apart and their
[1:28:05] babies are not going to make anything.
[1:28:08] Now, I got to preach to you for a
[1:28:10] second. Amen. Cuz I tell you what
[1:28:12] generates a lot of that nonsense is a
[1:28:14] bunch of
[1:28:16] Can I preach? Is a bunch of Come on,
[1:28:18] preacher. Okay, is a bunch of Pinterest.
[1:28:21] Come on now.
[1:28:23] And a bunch of psychologists have come
[1:28:25] up with good ways to raise our families.
[1:28:28] And it's not what a prophet said. But
[1:28:31] I'll tell you a way to rip that devil is
[1:28:33] turn on these tapes and break open that
[1:28:35] Bible and let the prophetic utterance of
[1:28:38] the seventh angel create an atmosphere.
[1:28:43] Come on. I tell you what the prophet
[1:28:44] said. He said he said the the token
[1:28:47] creates an atmosphere.
[1:28:49] Come on. Come on. Amen. It's an age
[1:28:52] where everybody's comparing everybody
[1:28:53] with everybody and everybody did this
[1:28:54] and and this one went here, so we got to
[1:28:57] go here and we Oh, God. I'm going to get
[1:28:59] in trouble. But
[1:29:01] it's an age of comparing ourselves with
[1:29:03] everybody else. And well, this family
[1:29:05] did this and and this family did that.
[1:29:07] I'll just I'll just say it cuz I'm just
[1:29:08] preaching. I'll just get it out there.
[1:29:10] Amen. Amen. I remember one time there
[1:29:12] was a family, man, they they put
[1:29:14] everything up. I mean, brand new car,
[1:29:16] brand new house, brand new shoes, brand
[1:29:19] new bubble gum, brand new this, brand
[1:29:21] new that. I mean, everything brand new.
[1:29:23] Look what we did. Look what we got. Look
[1:29:25] where we've been. Taking our kid here,
[1:29:27] taking our kid there. And somebody told
[1:29:28] me one day, they said, "Brother Andrew,"
[1:29:30] they say, "we're working so hard and
[1:29:32] striving just to be like that family
[1:29:34] because they got it all together." And I
[1:29:37] thought to myself, if you only knew what
[1:29:39] I knew about the behind the scenes of
[1:29:41] that family and that situation, I can
[1:29:44] say to you, church, things are not
[1:29:47] always the way they appear. People can
[1:29:49] put things on Facebook that look like
[1:29:51] they're all together, and in reality,
[1:29:53] they're falling apart. That's why I say
[1:29:56] to you, Rahab, forget what they're doing
[1:29:58] on Facebook.
[1:30:01] Forget what they're posting on
[1:30:02] Instagram. God gave you them babies,
[1:30:05] mama. God gave you that home. Daddy, put
[1:30:07] the token over that home and let the
[1:30:10] token be the source of influence.
[1:30:13] If we got to walk to church, if we don't
[1:30:16] have the finest clothes and we don't
[1:30:17] have the best of car and we don't have
[1:30:19] all the money in the bank, but if we got
[1:30:22] Jesus in our soul, if we got the Holy
[1:30:25] Ghost moving in our babies, if we got
[1:30:27] enough money to feed our faces, if we
[1:30:30] got enough Hallelujah, if the bills are
[1:30:33] paid, God's been good to us.
[1:30:37] Hallelujah. I'm not under society. I'm
[1:30:40] not under Leyon.
[1:30:42] [Applause]
[1:30:44] I'm under the token
[1:30:48] and the only thing that matters
[1:30:51] is what influences this token having
[1:30:56] now.
[1:30:59] Somebody say, "Well, you better be
[1:31:00] careful."
[1:31:04] I tell you, we get back to judging
[1:31:06] things by the word and not social media.
[1:31:12] You said, "Brother, we got to all get
[1:31:13] rid of it." You ain't all got to get rid
[1:31:14] of it. But I'll tell you what, the day
[1:31:16] before the day comes that I judge my
[1:31:17] friendships and relationships and lives
[1:31:19] based on social media, I'll throw it all
[1:31:22] away.
[1:31:25] We got a token, folks. And it's the only
[1:31:28] thing that matters. Look what John said.
[1:31:31] He said, "There is no fear in love, but
[1:31:35] perfect love casteth out fear." You know
[1:31:38] why perfect love cast out fear? Because
[1:31:41] fear hath torment
[1:31:44] and he that fearth is not made perfect
[1:31:47] in love. Can I just say what a prophet
[1:31:49] said? He said when you stand under the
[1:31:52] divine promise of God.
[1:31:57] There is no fear in God. Hallelujah.
[1:32:01] Glory to God. When you stand under the
[1:32:04] standards of social media and you stand
[1:32:06] under the standards of what everybody
[1:32:07] else is doing on your job, there's all
[1:32:09] kinds of fear. But when you stand
[1:32:12] underneath a divine promise of God, you
[1:32:14] can stand there like David and say, "I
[1:32:16] once was young, but now I'm old." But
[1:32:19] these eyes have never seen the righteous
[1:32:22] forsaken, and they've never seen his
[1:32:24] seed begging for bread.
[1:32:27] Brother said, "I say anybody that's in
[1:32:30] Christ Jesus has no condemnation and
[1:32:34] they have no fear." I know the devil
[1:32:37] don't want me to read this, but I'm
[1:32:38] going to read it or I'm going to bust.
[1:32:40] He said, "The devil hates me and I know
[1:32:42] he hates you, too, and he's my enemy,
[1:32:45] but as long as God's my friend, I don't
[1:32:48] have no fear of that devil.
[1:32:52] I know the devil hates me." And Sister
[1:32:55] Shakina, I know the devil hates you, but
[1:32:58] as long as we're the friend of God, I
[1:33:01] have no fear of that devil. I'll stand
[1:33:03] under the promise of God's word and
[1:33:06] drive every one of those devils back to
[1:33:08] the hell they come out of.
[1:33:11] Yes, sir. He said, you just drive him
[1:33:13] right on back and take the word of God
[1:33:15] and move him right on back out of the
[1:33:17] place.
[1:33:19] Can I say it? move him out of the place
[1:33:22] that he thinks he's holding.
[1:33:26] In reality, that devil don't hold the
[1:33:29] place that he thinks
[1:33:31] he's holding. He said, "No, sir. He's
[1:33:34] got no strongholds. He's absolutely
[1:33:38] legally
[1:33:40] defeated in every place. The devil
[1:33:44] hasn't got one legal right at all.
[1:33:48] Nowhere. He's just a devil.
[1:33:52] Can I say it? And a password.
[1:34:00] I got to think about that today.
[1:34:03] Cuz the most common thing about
[1:34:04] passwords is you know what? You forget
[1:34:07] them.
[1:34:11] Come on. You forget them.
[1:34:15] Oh, I'm going to make this one where I
[1:34:16] remember it. I ain't ever going to
[1:34:18] forget it.
[1:34:25] And you're over there at Silver Dollar
[1:34:26] City trying to open up the app
[1:34:30] and you were going to remember. See, the
[1:34:32] most common thing about passwords is
[1:34:34] they are forgotten. Brother Re said that
[1:34:37] devil is nothing but a password. He
[1:34:40] hasn't got no legal right to any man
[1:34:43] that's a that has a promise of Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ. He said that devil is whipped.
[1:34:48] Yes, sir. He's whipped in sickness. He's
[1:34:51] whipped in disappointments. He's whipped
[1:34:53] in everything. He's whipped in death. He
[1:34:56] can't scare me and he can't scare you.
[1:35:00] That's all he is. Is a big old shadow.
[1:35:06] Come on, folks. Faith knows no fear.
[1:35:10] Brother said, "Remember, he said there
[1:35:12] was that man having the dream and he
[1:35:14] said, "Here come the devil and the devil
[1:35:17] come to him that night and the devil
[1:35:18] said boo."
[1:35:21] The devil said, "Boo!" And the man got
[1:35:24] smaller and the devil got bigger. And
[1:35:27] the devil said boo. And the man got
[1:35:30] smaller and the devil got bigger until
[1:35:32] that devil backed that man plum into a
[1:35:35] corner somewhere and he said, "Listen, I
[1:35:38] got to do something." So, you know what
[1:35:40] he done? He reached over and got a hold
[1:35:43] of the Bible. And brother Ezekiel, when
[1:35:45] he got a hold of that Bible, he looked
[1:35:46] that devil in the face and all he said
[1:35:49] was, "Boo."
[1:35:51] Hallelujah.
[1:35:52] All he said was, "Boo." And brother Ben,
[1:35:55] the devil got smaller and the man got
[1:35:57] bigger. Brother Re said he kept saying
[1:35:59] boo until he backed that devil all the
[1:36:02] way back.
[1:36:04] until he backed that devil all the way
[1:36:06] back into the hell
[1:36:10] that he crawled up out of. Well, that
[1:36:12] devil's come in in places and he thanks
[1:36:15] the devil thinks he can hold you in
[1:36:17] these areas. But I say tonight, no sir,
[1:36:20] we are not Rahab the harlot. We are
[1:36:22] Rahab the believer.
[1:36:24] We are Rahab the influencer.
[1:36:28] Now, now I just got to say this because
[1:36:30] here's where the battle comes. Rahab,
[1:36:34] she come underneath the influence
[1:36:37] of the token message. Let me say this to
[1:36:40] you. She did not tamper with it. She did
[1:36:44] not question it. She believed it. Kind
[1:36:50] of like the jailer in Acts chapter 16
[1:36:53] when Paul said, "Don't hurt yourself."
[1:36:56] And he said, "Sers, what must I do to be
[1:36:59] saved?" And they said, "Believe on the
[1:37:02] Lord Jesus Christ and thy house shall be
[1:37:06] saved.
[1:37:09] Believe."
[1:37:14] Believe.
[1:37:18] What else have we got to do?
[1:37:21] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:37:24] thou shalt be saved and thy house. He
[1:37:30] said, "Now, most of you people here,
[1:37:31] most of your children are saved." See,
[1:37:33] they're Christian. But I said to Brother
[1:37:35] Fred, his kids, why? They can just hear
[1:37:36] me say one thing that's wrong and
[1:37:38] they're ready to stop it right now. You
[1:37:40] see, he's speaking here in the house and
[1:37:44] set with the highest respect instead of
[1:37:48] being out hot rod and rambling around.
[1:37:50] He said, 'Now, I know, now I I just I
[1:37:52] just got to say what a prophet said. He
[1:37:54] said, 'Now, I know we all want to think
[1:37:57] our kids as renegades and things like
[1:37:59] that.
[1:38:01] Can I say what he said? But we must stop
[1:38:04] that.
[1:38:06] He said, I believe we must remember that
[1:38:09] these kids are the best kids in the
[1:38:11] world because they're our children and
[1:38:14] we claim them for God. He said, "Now I
[1:38:17] don't believe that my salvation will
[1:38:19] save them." No, but my faith in God will
[1:38:24] do it. You see, my faith believing God
[1:38:26] will do it and will cause them to come
[1:38:29] to Christ. Now, I just say this because
[1:38:32] I found it very powerful. He said, "Now,
[1:38:35] always remember, thy and thy house shall
[1:38:39] be saved." And if you don't see them all
[1:38:42] saved before you leave the earth, he
[1:38:45] said, "Don't worry. They'll be there."
[1:38:47] Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] When the great coming, they'll be there.
[1:38:52] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:38:54] still talking about Rahab, the
[1:38:56] influencer. I'm still talking about
[1:38:58] Rahab, who come underneath the influence
[1:39:02] of the token message and got all her
[1:39:05] family under it. And the prophet says,
[1:39:06] "Here's what you want to believe for.
[1:39:08] You want your own safety. You believe
[1:39:10] for your own safety. And when you've
[1:39:12] done that, then apply the token for the
[1:39:16] whole family.
[1:39:20] You say, "How can I do that?" Are you
[1:39:21] ready? Claim it. Yes, sir. If it worked
[1:39:25] on you, then you and the word becomes
[1:39:28] one. It works for the both of you. You
[1:39:32] and the word are one. Then apply it to
[1:39:35] your children. apply it to your loved
[1:39:38] ones like Rahab did. She applied the
[1:39:42] token to her father. She applied it to
[1:39:44] her mother. She applied it to her
[1:39:46] brothers and sisters. And she got them
[1:39:49] all in. He said, "You applied and
[1:39:51] say,"Lord, I'm going after my son."
[1:39:54] Hallelujah.
[1:39:56] I'm going after my daughter. I claim
[1:39:59] her. Satan, you turn her loose. I'm
[1:40:02] coming after them. I apply my token. the
[1:40:06] Holy Spirit that lives within me. Catch
[1:40:09] my daughter there. I'm going to her now
[1:40:12] with your anointing upon me. He'll do
[1:40:15] it. You say, "Brother Andrew, I've
[1:40:17] raised my children under the influence
[1:40:19] of this message. They grew up there in
[1:40:21] the tapes. They grew up around the
[1:40:23] message and they've strayed from it. But
[1:40:25] I'll tell you what Proverbs 22:6 says,
[1:40:28] "Train up a child in the way he should
[1:40:32] go.
[1:40:33] And when he is old, he will not depart
[1:40:37] from it." You say, "What are you
[1:40:39] saying?" But said, "There may be some
[1:40:41] times
[1:40:43] that he may depart from it."
[1:40:48] Are you ready for this?
[1:40:50] But it won't depart. Amen.
[1:40:56] From him. You say, "What are you
[1:40:58] saying?" I'm saying, "Play those tapes."
[1:41:02] You're not wasting your time. Those
[1:41:04] tapes are not the token. But the token
[1:41:07] is on those tapes. And if you'll come
[1:41:10] under the influence of those tapes, you
[1:41:12] say, "Why are you saying this?" Because
[1:41:14] God is still with this message.
[1:41:20] I ain't got much voice left, but I'm
[1:41:22] left. But I'm going to get out there.
[1:41:24] God is still with this message. Brother
[1:41:27] Brandham said, "The angel of the Lord
[1:41:30] accompanies the message always." I got a
[1:41:34] question for you, Grace Tabernacle. When
[1:41:36] is one time that God is not with this
[1:41:39] message?
[1:41:41] Come on. I'm ready for an answer.
[1:41:44] Can I give you the answer? Never. He's
[1:41:47] always with this message. You say,
[1:41:49] "Preacher, it was preached years ago in
[1:41:52] a foreign land or in a far offdistant
[1:41:55] state." Can I say this? God is still
[1:41:59] with this message. Brother said the
[1:42:01] other day, he said they went over there
[1:42:03] and they played some of these tapes down
[1:42:06] in Jamaica. He said they played them
[1:42:08] seven seal tapes. He said while they
[1:42:10] were playing them, he said all of a
[1:42:12] sudden the pillar of fire come through.
[1:42:16] Come on, church. The seals was preached
[1:42:19] in March of 1963.
[1:42:22] In July of 1963,
[1:42:25] B said they were playing those tapes and
[1:42:27] the pillar of fire come right in the
[1:42:29] room and settled down over the top of
[1:42:33] that tape player
[1:42:36] to vindicate that this is the token
[1:42:40] message.
[1:42:42] Now, I just want to say this to you. The
[1:42:46] supernatural influence of this message
[1:42:49] is always present. Brother Bram said,
[1:42:51] "Listen, God is always present." He
[1:42:54] said, "This is not this is not
[1:42:57] imagination."
[1:42:59] I I want to I want to I want to just say
[1:43:01] this to you. This is not imagination. He
[1:43:05] said, "It is time to come back under the
[1:43:08] influence of the supernatural."
[1:43:11] He said, "Now listen, he was took off
[1:43:13] the tree, but sinners and lukewarm
[1:43:14] church members
[1:43:17] become dry sticks with some kind of a
[1:43:20] memory that sometime there was a
[1:43:21] supernatural God of the past that had
[1:43:23] life." And way back there, he said, "But
[1:43:25] if you believe and will lay in his
[1:43:28] presence, it'll produce the same thing
[1:43:33] to you." What are you saying, brother
[1:43:35] Andrew? Why are you saying put the tapes
[1:43:37] back in our home and open the Bibles?
[1:43:39] Because the token creates an atmosphere.
[1:43:45] Now remember said get ready. Apply it.
[1:43:46] Believe it. Clean up. Let your children.
[1:43:48] Let your family. Let your loved ones see
[1:43:50] it in you. That's right.
[1:43:53] He says it will take effect. He said
[1:43:57] apply the token with such love believing
[1:43:59] in confidence. It's going to help.
[1:44:02] He said and when we're born of the
[1:44:05] spirit of God, now I want you to hear
[1:44:06] this, okay? God isn't weak in one place
[1:44:11] and strong in another.
[1:44:14] So God wasn't strong in Rahab
[1:44:19] and weak in you. He said because if you
[1:44:24] got a little shadow of God in you, just
[1:44:27] the littlest speck of God, then you got
[1:44:30] all power, you got enough power in you
[1:44:32] to make a world and go out there and
[1:44:36] live on it. He said, "Now apply it and
[1:44:39] create the atmosphere around you.
[1:44:45] Come on, Rahab.
[1:44:47] Go get your mama.
[1:44:49] Go get your daddy. Go get your brothers.
[1:44:53] Go get your sisters. Go get all you can
[1:44:57] underneath this token." Lord, they they
[1:45:00] ain't gonna listen to me. He said,
[1:45:02] "That's okay. apply the token and create
[1:45:05] an atmosphere around you and they'll
[1:45:08] just drop,
[1:45:12] brother Brian. They'll just drop right
[1:45:14] into it. See? Oh, if you got the token,
[1:45:18] you create a spirit around you of power
[1:45:21] when you walk that people know you're a
[1:45:24] Christian and they love for you to say
[1:45:26] something to them. They believe your
[1:45:29] word. Amen. Listen, he said, "And when
[1:45:32] you talk to that child, when you talk to
[1:45:34] your husband, when you talk to your
[1:45:36] wife, when you talk to your loved one,
[1:45:38] believe that it's going to help." And
[1:45:41] just stand there and say, "Lord, I've
[1:45:44] claimed them. They're mine. I'm getting
[1:45:47] them for you, Lord." Hallelujah. Apply
[1:45:50] the token. Now, here's where I want to
[1:45:52] close. He said, "Apply the token, then
[1:45:55] walk with it. Claim your household. This
[1:45:59] is evening time now. He says, "You've
[1:46:01] been listening a long time." Amen. Now
[1:46:05] this is the evening time. Can I say it?
[1:46:09] It's applying time. Hallelujah.
[1:46:12] The wrath will strike, but apply the
[1:46:15] token with confidence.
[1:46:18] Apply the token with confidence. I I
[1:46:22] just want to I just want to just just I
[1:46:25] don't have time to read it to you. I'm
[1:46:26] just going to read it. Just preach it to
[1:46:27] you real quick.
[1:46:28] Paul says this. He says, "When this
[1:46:31] revelation comes, it's the mystery of
[1:46:33] God that's been hid from the foundation
[1:46:36] of the world." He said, "Or since the
[1:46:37] world began," he said, "but is now made
[1:46:40] manifest by the scriptures of the
[1:46:41] prophets according to the commandment of
[1:46:44] the everlasting God." Now listen, and
[1:46:46] this revelation is made known to all
[1:46:50] nations for the obedience of faith. I
[1:46:53] got to looking at this word obedience
[1:46:55] and that word obedience means
[1:46:58] submission.
[1:47:00] Brother B said this. He said life only
[1:47:03] comes through obedience to Christ. He
[1:47:06] said now full obedience to the whole
[1:47:08] word of God entitles you to the token.
[1:47:11] Now I'm just going to I'm not going to
[1:47:13] try to preach to I'm just going to share
[1:47:14] it with you. Okay?
[1:47:16] It's always stood out to me how that
[1:47:19] Paul says these words, obedience to the
[1:47:22] faith. I got to reading this today and
[1:47:25] brother Ram said this. If we are in
[1:47:27] perfect submission to the Holy Spirit,
[1:47:29] he said God would lead us by the Holy
[1:47:31] Spirit. He said, "Now what the Holy
[1:47:34] Spirit was then, it is now. And what the
[1:47:37] Holy Spirit did to that church, it does
[1:47:39] to this church. And as this church will
[1:47:42] be just as submissive to it.
[1:47:45] Come on. As that church was, it'll bring
[1:47:50] it just the same results.
[1:47:54] If this church will be just as
[1:47:57] submission to it as that church was,
[1:48:01] it'll bring the same results. Can I Can
[1:48:04] I just Can I just show this to you?
[1:48:07] If this Rahab
[1:48:11] will be just as submissive to the token,
[1:48:15] as that Rahab was,
[1:48:18] it'll bring the same results. Prophet of
[1:48:23] God said this when he speaks of Rahab,
[1:48:25] he said, "Now we find out through this
[1:48:27] great romance and great obedience to
[1:48:31] faith that the harlot Rahab gave birth
[1:48:35] and she married a man named Salmon." And
[1:48:39] his the son they gave birth to was Boaz.
[1:48:42] Now listen. He said, "We're all
[1:48:44] acquainted with that story." He said,
[1:48:46] "And she became the great great great
[1:48:48] great great grandmother of our Lord
[1:48:51] Jesus Christ."
[1:48:54] Now, folks,
[1:48:56] I don't I don't want to I don't want to
[1:48:58] make nobody mad. I just got to say it.
[1:49:02] Rahab was a powerful woman. Amen. Yes,
[1:49:05] sir. She went from a harlot, from a
[1:49:07] street walker, from a from a woman of
[1:49:10] ill fame and horrible reputation.
[1:49:13] She went from that condition to being
[1:49:15] one of the greatest influencers.
[1:49:18] Hallelujah. That saved her entire
[1:49:20] family.
[1:49:22] Brought her whole family underneath the
[1:49:25] headship of the token. Got them all
[1:49:28] saved. Her Are y'all seeing the picture?
[1:49:31] Her house was spared when Jericho fell.
[1:49:36] What a testimony this woman had.
[1:49:40] Can I go a step further?
[1:49:42] And then she married Shamon.
[1:49:47] Can I say it?
[1:49:49] And she no longer tried to lead.
[1:49:53] I'm closing.
[1:49:56] She no longer tried to lead.
[1:49:59] The submission had now come underneath
[1:50:02] headship
[1:50:05] to an Israelite soldier.
[1:50:10] And she now is the great great great
[1:50:13] grandmother.
[1:50:17] What are you saying, preacher? I'm
[1:50:18] saying when you come under this message,
[1:50:21] you have no fault coming. When you come
[1:50:24] underneath the influence of this token,
[1:50:27] now listen. I know. I know it's an age
[1:50:29] where where men don't lead no more and
[1:50:30] the society says women leads but that's
[1:50:32] contrary to God's word.
[1:50:35] Rahab the harlot
[1:50:38] street walker the illfame woman come
[1:50:41] underneath the influence of the token
[1:50:44] and was spared herself and become the
[1:50:47] influencer
[1:50:49] of the token of her hour. Won't you
[1:50:53] stand on your feet with us tonight?
[1:50:56] Rahab the influencer.
[1:50:59] No fear,
[1:51:01] no condemnation.
[1:51:04] She just stood there. No guilt.
[1:51:10] Come on, church.
[1:51:13] Noah shameless.
[1:51:16] She come into her position. Amen.
[1:51:20] She came into her position and she stood
[1:51:24] there as an influencer with the token.
[1:51:28] Now, Rub said it very beautiful. He says
[1:51:31] now he expects us also to display his
[1:51:34] token over our faith to Satan and all
[1:51:38] his unbelieving cults and denominations
[1:51:41] that we believe that his promise is true
[1:51:45] and that he will do what he promised to
[1:51:49] do. Hold the token over your unmovable
[1:51:54] faith in his promise.
[1:51:56] He says, "And watch that devil go."
[1:52:02] I don't know about you tonight, but I
[1:52:04] want to be I want to be another Rahab
[1:52:07] the influencer.
[1:52:10] Anybody want to join me?
[1:52:13] I want I want to be another Rahab the
[1:52:16] influencer.
[1:52:18] I want to be somebody that's
[1:52:21] it's not too
[1:52:23] not too proud.
[1:52:28] to say sometimes I don't
[1:52:32] I want to be somebody that's not too
[1:52:34] proud to say, "Brother Brandham, you're
[1:52:36] right.
[1:52:38] I'm wrong."
[1:52:40] I want to be an influencer.
[1:52:43] Can I say this to you? I don't just want
[1:52:45] to be a preacher.
[1:52:47] I want to be an influencer.
[1:52:50] I don't just want to be a church member.
[1:52:53] I want to be an influencer.
[1:52:56] When all the, as we said Sunday, when
[1:52:58] all the demon powers are streaming out,
[1:53:01] the underworld has come in and found a
[1:53:03] place. It's influencing homes,
[1:53:06] influencing destinies, influencing
[1:53:08] lives, influencing everything.
[1:53:11] Influencing careers, influencing
[1:53:13] families, it's influencing everything.
[1:53:17] But God has saved this token message
[1:53:21] for an influence
[1:53:24] in the last days. We love him tonight.
[1:53:28] Almighty God,
[1:53:30] we don't want to be church members.
[1:53:32] Lord,
[1:53:34] Father, we want to be influencers.
[1:53:37] Lord, we want to be influencers of
[1:53:38] faith, influencers of revelation. Lord,
[1:53:43] Father, as Rahab, Lord, we so commonly
[1:53:46] call her Rahab the harlot, but Lord, we
[1:53:50] don't want to call her Rahab the harlot
[1:53:52] no more. Lord, she was an influencer,
[1:53:55] Lord. But Lord, her influence was coming
[1:53:58] from what she was under. Lord, when she
[1:54:01] come underneath that token,
[1:54:04] Lord, when she hung that scarlet cord
[1:54:06] out there and and displayed it, Lord,
[1:54:09] Father, she moved from a reputation,
[1:54:12] Lord,
[1:54:14] of sin,
[1:54:16] of condemnation, Lord, of guilt, of
[1:54:19] embarrassment, of humiliation.
[1:54:22] She moved from that type of reputation,
[1:54:25] Lord, and she become an influencer,
[1:54:29] Lord. She become a woman of grace.
[1:54:32] Father, she's found in the honor role of
[1:54:35] faith.
[1:54:36] Lord, brother Bram said it so
[1:54:38] beautifully in the why little Bethlehem.
[1:54:40] He said she come out of that background
[1:54:42] and she said her coming out of that
[1:54:46] condition married Salmon. And Salmon and
[1:54:49] her had Boaz. And Lord, then the lineage
[1:54:53] came and then our Lord Jesus came out of
[1:54:55] that lineage. But Lord, I love what he
[1:54:58] says.
[1:54:59] He says they came back and they settled
[1:55:02] in Bethlehem.
[1:55:04] Lord, I believe here tonight is some
[1:55:06] Bethlehem dwellers. Father, I pray every
[1:55:09] believer under the sound of my voice
[1:55:11] tonight will not just be a believer, but
[1:55:15] Lord, they'll be an obeyer. Father,
[1:55:17] Lord, for faith without works is dead.
[1:55:21] But Lord, if faith and works comes
[1:55:24] together, then Lord, there will be
[1:55:27] results,
[1:55:28] supernatural results. Now, Father, if
[1:55:31] there be one here tonight that's living
[1:55:34] under that spirit of fear and fear is
[1:55:36] tormenting their minds and it's
[1:55:38] tormenting their homes and if there be
[1:55:41] any little fifth gospels here tonight
[1:55:43] that that that old evil, hateful spirit
[1:55:45] of fear is tormenting those precious
[1:55:48] mamas. Father, I rebuke that demon in
[1:55:51] the name of the Lord Jesus. I stand upon
[1:55:54] the authority of the word of Almighty
[1:55:56] God. I stand underneath the influence of
[1:55:58] the token message of this hour. Lord, I
[1:56:01] stand here tonight as a servant of
[1:56:04] Almighty God. And in the name of the
[1:56:06] Lord Jesus Christ, Satan, I come against
[1:56:08] you. Thou demon of fear that torments in
[1:56:11] the nights, that torments in the
[1:56:13] mornings, that torments in the mind, I
[1:56:15] rebuke you in the name of the Lord
[1:56:17] Jesus. You demon that's trying to
[1:56:19] convince these families and trying to
[1:56:21] convince homes that they're not good
[1:56:23] enough and they're failing. They're
[1:56:25] going to fall apart. Satan, I adjure
[1:56:27] thee in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:29] Christ. Take your hands off of God's
[1:56:32] property. I rebuke you in the name of
[1:56:34] the Lord. Father, I pray tonight the
[1:56:37] sweet influences of this token message.
[1:56:39] I pray Lord it would break out in every
[1:56:41] home. I pray it would break out in every
[1:56:43] heart. I pray, oh God, it would break
[1:56:45] out in every life. Lord, I pray if
[1:56:47] there's one ready to throw up their
[1:56:49] hands and quit, I rebuke that demon of
[1:56:51] suicide. I rebuke it in the name of the
[1:56:54] Lord Jesus Christ. I rebuke that demon
[1:56:56] of quitting, that demon of giving up,
[1:56:59] that demon of throwing in the towel. I
[1:57:01] rebuke you, Satan, in the name of the
[1:57:03] Lord Jesus. Take your hold off of God's
[1:57:05] precious property. These are not just
[1:57:08] church members. These are not just just
[1:57:10] just members of Grace Tabernacle or
[1:57:13] citizens of the state of Arkansas, but
[1:57:15] these are Messiah Satan. These are Holy
[1:57:18] Ghost filled firebaptized
[1:57:21] children of the living God. And in the
[1:57:24] name of Jesus, come away from them in
[1:57:26] the name of Jesus. Almighty God, restore
[1:57:31] faith where fear has been, Lord. Father,
[1:57:34] restore joy, restore peace,
[1:57:38] restore fellowship,
[1:57:41] restore sweet communion
[1:57:43] in the name of Jesus.
[1:57:46] Father, this token message has come to
[1:57:49] influence our families. Lord, restore
[1:57:52] the broken pieces. Father, in Jesus name
[1:57:55] we pray.
[1:57:58] Oh God, bring us under such influence of
[1:58:01] this message.
[1:58:03] Create such an atmosphere
[1:58:05] of this message in our lives, Lord, that
[1:58:10] we'll create an atmosphere around others
[1:58:12] that Lord, we won't have to say one
[1:58:14] word. the atmosphere will just overwhelm
[1:58:17] them and they'll have to give in to you
[1:58:20] Lord because we stand in confidence
[1:58:22] applying the token and believing it in
[1:58:27] Jesus name.
[1:58:30] I believe
[1:58:34] Lord.
[1:58:36] I believe
[1:58:41] things are possible.
[1:58:46] Lord, I
[1:58:49] believe.
[1:58:51] Yes, Lord.
[1:58:54] I believe.
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:58] Lord,
[1:59:00] I believe.
[1:59:04] All things
[1:59:06] are possible.
[1:59:09] Lord, I
[1:59:12] believe.
[1:59:13] [Music]
[1:59:15] Oh Lord,
[1:59:17] I believe.
[1:59:21] Lord,
[1:59:23] I believe.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:27] All things are possible.
[1:59:32] Lord, I
[1:59:35] believe
[1:59:37] and Lord
[1:59:40] I receive.
[1:59:44] Lord
[1:59:46] I receive.
[1:59:50] All things are possible.
[1:59:55] Lord, I receive. How many receives the
[1:59:59] token message? Lord, Lord, I receive.
[2:00:04] How many receives what the word says
[2:00:06] about you?
[2:00:09] I receive.
[2:00:13] All things are possible.
[2:00:18] Lord, I receive.
[2:00:22] How many says, "Lord, I want to I want
[2:00:25] to unleash this prophetic utterance.
[2:00:28] I want this prophetic utterance to fill
[2:00:30] my home. I want it to fill my family. I
[2:00:34] want it to fill my room. I want it to
[2:00:35] fill every aspect of my life. I want
[2:00:38] this prophetic utterance to fill my
[2:00:40] life. I want to become so full of this
[2:00:43] message that the life I live
[2:00:47] has its own altar call.
[2:00:49] The life I live brings spirits under its
[2:00:52] control.
[2:00:54] You believe it's possible tonight? Amen.
[2:00:58] Amen. I I I know the spirit of the
[2:01:00] Lord's in the building tonight. How many
[2:01:02] believes that?
[2:01:04] How many believes he's here? How many
[2:01:06] believes he's here to break spirits?
[2:01:09] He's here to break strongholds.
[2:01:11] Now, the devil's moved in areas and he
[2:01:14] thinks he has a holding there.
[2:01:17] And you know the power he has over you
[2:01:19] is getting you to think he belongs there
[2:01:22] when in reality you don't.
[2:01:26] The devil don't belong there.
[2:01:29] Now we've been called in sin of God to
[2:01:30] cast out devils. Spirits of fear,
[2:01:34] spirits of unbelief, spirits of
[2:01:36] division, spirits of nervousness,
[2:01:38] spirits of confusion, spirits of
[2:01:40] misunderstandings,
[2:01:42] all kinds of spirits. We have been sent
[2:01:44] as the bride of Christ to cast them
[2:01:46] devils out. You believe that? Tonight, I
[2:01:49] want you to turn and lay your hand on
[2:01:51] someone next to you. Brother to brother,
[2:01:53] sister to sister, husband to wife,
[2:01:55] families, and godly order. Tonight,
[2:01:58] we're the church of the living God.
[2:02:01] We're bought with the blood. We're
[2:02:03] underneath the token message of the
[2:02:04] hour. The devil has not one right in any
[2:02:08] home, in any life, and any relationship,
[2:02:11] in any family, in any any marriage, in
[2:02:15] any aspect of this church. Satan has not
[2:02:17] one right. As you have your hands laid
[2:02:19] up on one another, I want you to join
[2:02:21] with me tonight in prayer. And I want
[2:02:23] you to open up your voice and your heart
[2:02:25] right there where you are. And I want
[2:02:26] you to begin to pray with me tonight.
[2:02:28] Almighty God, Father, we come before you
[2:02:31] this evening on this Wednesday evening.
[2:02:34] Lord, we've not come here for just
[2:02:35] another service. Oh God, Lord, we've not
[2:02:38] come here for just entertainment or just
[2:02:40] to take up some time on a Wednesday
[2:02:42] evening. But Lord, we've come here
[2:02:44] because we're influencers underneath
[2:02:46] this message. And Lord, we know that
[2:02:48] every gun in hell is against this
[2:02:50] message. We know every demon in hell is
[2:02:52] out to take it down. The devil's out to
[2:02:55] paralyze the influence of this message.
[2:02:57] He wants to take its bite out. He wants
[2:02:59] to he wants to strip it of its authority
[2:03:01] and of its power to fix situations and
[2:03:04] to break his to break his fictional hold
[2:03:07] in the lives of children of God. But
[2:03:09] Lord, we stand here tonight, dear God,
[2:03:11] as one body, as one bride, as one member
[2:03:14] of one body, Lord, to another, joining
[2:03:16] our faith together as the sons and
[2:03:18] daughters of God. And Lord, as we lay
[2:03:20] our hands upon one another tonight, we
[2:03:22] rebuke Satan. We rebuke the spirit of
[2:03:25] fear. We rebuke the spirit of confusion.
[2:03:28] We rebuke the spirit of division, oh
[2:03:30] God. We rebuke the influence of the
[2:03:32] underworld that's trying to come into
[2:03:35] lives and trying to come into hearts,
[2:03:37] Lord. Father, I pray for every one of my
[2:03:39] brothers and sisters here, Lord. I pray
[2:03:41] for every one of our young people, oh
[2:03:43] God, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:45] Christ. I pray the power of the Holy
[2:03:48] Ghost tonight would bind the influences,
[2:03:50] God, of the underworld, Lord, that are
[2:03:53] trying to come around our families,
[2:03:54] trying to come around our young people,
[2:03:56] Lord. Just because we're in the message
[2:03:58] or just because we go to Grace
[2:04:00] Tabernacle, Lord, it does not mean we're
[2:04:02] exempt from these influences, Lord, we
[2:04:04] must do battle with them, Lord. We must
[2:04:06] do war with them, dear God. But as
[2:04:09] believers of your word, we refuse to
[2:04:11] give into these influences, Lord. as
[2:04:14] Rahabs. Lord, we are not here to give
[2:04:16] into influences. We're here to be
[2:04:18] influencers. And in the name of the Lord
[2:04:20] Jesus Christ, may a coal of fire, may it
[2:04:23] come up off the altar tonight, dear God.
[2:04:25] And may it touch every lip, Lord. May it
[2:04:28] touch every heart, oh God. And in the
[2:04:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, may there
[2:04:32] be Isaiah's birthed here tonight. May
[2:04:35] there be Rahab influencers birthed here
[2:04:37] tonight, Lord. May there be warriors, oh
[2:04:39] God, birth, Lord, underneath the
[2:04:42] influence of this message, Lord. Father,
[2:04:44] I pray their influence of this word, oh
[2:04:46] God, would become so great, it would
[2:04:48] become so powerful, Lord, that it would
[2:04:51] overtake the Hollywood influences, Lord,
[2:04:53] that are trying to consume lives and
[2:04:55] trying to consume homes. Father, we
[2:04:57] rebuke them in the name of the Lord
[2:04:59] Jesus Christ. May the power of the word
[2:05:02] of God, may it take over every heart.
[2:05:04] May it take over every life in the name
[2:05:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:05:09] influence of faith. Oh God, may there
[2:05:11] come such a union between every believer
[2:05:13] here and Christ the word. Lord, may
[2:05:16] every one of these Rahab be influencers,
[2:05:18] Lord. May they marry this new anointed
[2:05:20] word and may they come underneath its
[2:05:22] headship, Lord, both in the natural and
[2:05:24] in the spiritual, dear God. For Lord, we
[2:05:27] commit these believers. We commit these
[2:05:29] influencers into thy faithful hands. In
[2:05:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:05:34] pray.
[2:05:36] Amen. And amen. God bless you, friends.
[2:05:40] God bless you, influencers.
[2:05:42] Hallelujah. Won't you just raise your
[2:05:44] hands to him tonight?
[2:05:46] Say, Lord, I want you. I want you more
[2:05:49] than ever before. Lord, how many say,
[2:05:51] Lord, increase my influence.
[2:05:54] Increase my influence, Lord. Increase my
[2:05:57] influence in your word. I don't want to
[2:06:00] be known just as a preacher. I don't
[2:06:02] want to be known just as a singer, as a
[2:06:04] musician.
[2:06:06] I want to be known as an influencer, an
[2:06:09] influential Christian.
[2:06:12] God bless you tonight.
[2:06:14] Only
[2:06:16] believe.
[2:06:19] Yes. Only
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:40] I say Jesus
[2:06:44] is here.
[2:06:48] Jesus
[2:06:50] is here.
[2:06:53] All things are possible
[2:06:58] for Jesus
[2:07:01] is here.
[2:07:04] Jesus
[2:07:06] is here.
[2:07:09] Jesus
[2:07:12] is here.
[2:07:15] All things are possible.
[2:07:21] Jesus
[2:07:23] is here.
[2:07:25] I say, Lord,
[2:07:28] I believe.
[2:07:31] How many say that tonight as you lift
[2:07:33] your hands? I believe
[2:07:37] all things
[2:07:39] are possible,
[2:07:43] Lord. I believe.
[2:07:48] Lord,
[2:07:50] I believe.
[2:07:54] Lord,
[2:07:56] I believe.
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:00] All things are possible.
[2:08:05] Lord, I be
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:11] Amen. And how many say amen to the word
[2:08:13] of God? Amen. How many you say the Lord
[2:08:16] spoke to you tonight? Amen. I just
[2:08:18] thought what a a tremendous message to
[2:08:22] apply the token with confidence and
[2:08:25] become an influencer.
[2:08:27] Isn't that a powerful message tonight?
[2:08:29] And you know, I think a lot of times,
[2:08:31] Brother Andrew was speaking about how
[2:08:34] that we don't feel worthy to to say that
[2:08:37] we are that. And he brought out the life
[2:08:39] of Rahab to show us that no matter what
[2:08:42] our past is that we're we're worthy. If
[2:08:44] God calls you to it, then you're worthy
[2:08:46] to to fulfill what God called you to
[2:08:48] fulfill. You know, I got to thinking
[2:08:51] when he was sharing that of, you know,
[2:08:53] how that you know how sometimes we don't
[2:08:56] feel like our influence is going very
[2:08:58] far. You know what the Bible doesn't
[2:08:59] ever tell us? It never tells us of what
[2:09:02] day when Joshua was marching around the
[2:09:05] walls of Jericho. There's no record of
[2:09:07] what day that her family came into her
[2:09:09] house or her dad came in or her mom came
[2:09:12] in. And I thought some may have came in
[2:09:14] on the first day, some may have came in
[2:09:16] that evening, some may have been couple
[2:09:18] days later. I I don't know when it was
[2:09:19] when they came in. But I know one thing
[2:09:21] that whenever judgment struck, they were
[2:09:23] under the token of Rahab's house.
[2:09:26] Thought it may have took the sound. I I
[2:09:28] thought here they were and marching
[2:09:30] around that wall and the wall never
[2:09:32] fell. how it'd be so easy to say, "Well,
[2:09:35] there ain't nothing happening. While we
[2:09:37] believe what what Rahab said, but
[2:09:38] something held them there." And when
[2:09:39] judgment came and when they heard the
[2:09:42] sound of judge judgment, you better
[2:09:43] believe that they were in Rahab's house.
[2:09:46] I don't care what they were doing or how
[2:09:48] long delayed it was for their coming,
[2:09:50] but whenever they heard the sound of
[2:09:52] judgment, they found their way to
[2:09:53] Rahab's house. So you just keep being an
[2:09:55] influencer cuz when it when it matters
[2:09:57] when it matters most and when something
[2:10:00] trouble comes on somebody's life or
[2:10:02] sounds like that or judgment or pressure
[2:10:04] comes upon their life they have to have
[2:10:06] a place to turn and where they'll turn
[2:10:08] is the one that had influence and I
[2:10:10] believe that tonight. I believe that was
[2:10:12] a powerful message sent from God to you
[2:10:14] to keep standing and being an influence.
[2:10:16] You never know the influence that you
[2:10:18] have over somebody else's life. You
[2:10:20] know, I have a dear friend over in India
[2:10:22] that's been pastoring since I was born.
[2:10:24] Over I guess about 40 years, 43 or four
[2:10:27] years that he's been he's been pastoring
[2:10:29] there. And and uh when he came uh out of
[2:10:32] Hinduism, he actually was introduced uh
[2:10:35] into a Pentecostal movement over in
[2:10:38] India. And he had felt the calling in
[2:10:40] his life to pastor. And so in the
[2:10:43] village that he lived in, he had opened
[2:10:45] up a little church there and they built
[2:10:46] a you know out of mud and all this
[2:10:48] stuff. and and that they made them an
[2:10:50] assembly, put a pull pit there and and
[2:10:53] went out and started inviting people and
[2:10:55] preaching the gospel to them the best
[2:10:57] they knew. And and after some time had
[2:11:00] passed, they had one of those great
[2:11:01] floods that came through and it
[2:11:02] destroyed their church. It destroyed
[2:11:04] their pull pit. Uh a sickness had fell
[2:11:06] upon his daughter. He lost the life of
[2:11:08] his daughter. He found himself on a
[2:11:10] mountain praying and begging God and
[2:11:12] asking why would I have been, you know,
[2:11:15] uh, made this commitment to serve you
[2:11:17] and now everything that I ever done has
[2:11:18] fell apart. He said, I was sitting up
[2:11:20] there praying and crying out to God. And
[2:11:23] he said, I was just weeping because
[2:11:24] everything I'd done, I'd left my my
[2:11:26] work. I'd left everything to to to take
[2:11:28] a stand for this gospel and and
[2:11:31] everything I knew. I my my family, you
[2:11:33] know, had to had denounced me because I
[2:11:35] took this kind of a stand. And he said,
[2:11:37] "I thought I I I just went up to the
[2:11:40] mountain." And he had taken with him a
[2:11:42] little uh blanket there that he had
[2:11:44] stored in his closet. And he took it and
[2:11:46] he said, "I just laid it out on the on
[2:11:47] the rocks and knelt down on it. I just
[2:11:49] be to pray." He said, "Whenever I
[2:11:52] started crying," he said, "I was just
[2:11:54] just sobbing." And he said, "And I heard
[2:11:56] it said it sounded like my tears were
[2:11:59] thunder when they hit the ground." He
[2:12:01] said, "It was just a thundering in my in
[2:12:03] my ear." He said, 'When I looked down at
[2:12:06] my feet, there was a book laying there
[2:12:07] at my feet that said that said spoken
[2:12:11] word. And he said, I didn't know what it
[2:12:14] was. I didn't know who William Brandham
[2:12:16] was. He said, but the title of the
[2:12:18] message was why Cry Speak. He said, here
[2:12:21] I was crying out to God and asking God
[2:12:23] for answers. He said, and I picked that
[2:12:25] book up and wondered how, you know, that
[2:12:28] this had even came about. And he said,
[2:12:29] my mind had gone back. how that a few
[2:12:32] years ago a lady in our village or or
[2:12:34] had been visiting the village had came
[2:12:36] by and she had gave me some books to
[2:12:39] read as trying to be a witness to me. He
[2:12:41] said, "I just thanked her and put them
[2:12:42] in my closet. I never read them, never
[2:12:44] looked anything into it, never thought
[2:12:45] nothing else about it and forgot they
[2:12:47] were even there." He said, "But in the
[2:12:49] moment that I most needed it and I was
[2:12:51] crying out to God there, I thought my
[2:12:53] Andrew was preaching that. I thought
[2:12:54] there was that token laying there." And
[2:12:56] you know what I talked to that brother
[2:12:58] about? I said where I'd like to meet
[2:12:59] that lady. That brother has established
[2:13:02] 55 churches in India in the in these
[2:13:04] past several years. 55 churches. There
[2:13:07] are thousands of believers that have
[2:13:09] came uh to Christ out of Hinduism out of
[2:13:12] that one man's ministry. And I said, I'd
[2:13:14] sure like to meet that woman. He said,
[2:13:16] I'd sure introduce you if I knew who she
[2:13:17] was. I thought my here she don't I don't
[2:13:21] know who she is. I don't know if anybody
[2:13:22] knows who she was, but I know that here
[2:13:24] she may feel like you and I feel
[2:13:26] sometimes that I went out and done
[2:13:28] everything I could to be an influence
[2:13:29] and maybe my influence wasn't that great
[2:13:32] after all. You know, I may have handed
[2:13:34] out some books. I may have tried to live
[2:13:36] a life and maybe it didn't really take a
[2:13:38] hold on anybody. I wasn't much of an
[2:13:39] influence at all. But little did she
[2:13:41] know that thousands of souls will be
[2:13:44] accounted to her. It'll go on record in
[2:13:47] heaven. thousands of souls that have
[2:13:48] been won because she was willing to be
[2:13:50] an influence for the message of the
[2:13:52] hour. I say it may not seem like you're
[2:13:54] doing something great, but every little
[2:13:56] bit you do, you never know the the
[2:13:59] gravity of what it really has in this
[2:14:01] world and the you you never know how big
[2:14:03] it really is. I believe God uses our our
[2:14:06] witness. He uses your life as a
[2:14:08] testimony. And one day, this world will
[2:14:10] look to you as the only answer. Maybe it
[2:14:12] was somebody that just saw you in a
[2:14:13] supermarket that when they get in
[2:14:15] trouble, they cry out to God. Whatever
[2:14:17] God it was that was on that woman. May I
[2:14:20] may you come and help me in a time of
[2:14:21] need. That's the kind of influence I
[2:14:23] want to be tonight. Do you believe that
[2:14:25] tonight? How many believes that message
[2:14:27] was for you? When you don't feel like
[2:14:29] you're doing enough, but God has given
[2:14:31] us something to be able to be an
[2:14:34] influence in this world. I believe I
[2:14:36] thank God for you tonight. I appreciate
[2:14:38] brother Andrew and just speaking his
[2:14:40] heart. You know, we just like Rahab, you
[2:14:44] know, Rahab, she never was given the
[2:14:46] plan of God. She didn't know how long it
[2:14:49] was going to take or how many times they
[2:14:51] going to walk around that wall or how
[2:14:52] many days it was going to be. She didn't
[2:14:54] have the plan of God. She just had the
[2:14:57] she just had the commission that was
[2:14:58] given to her. She may not have had the
[2:15:00] whole plan, but she sure had a word from
[2:15:03] the from the from the Holy Ghost that
[2:15:05] says, "Hold on to the token. However
[2:15:07] long it takes, just let the token be on
[2:15:09] display." I wonder how many could say,
[2:15:11] "Lord, no matter what it takes." I may
[2:15:13] not know the whole plan of God. The
[2:15:14] Bible says, "No man knows the date or
[2:15:16] the hour. It's something that God has
[2:15:18] reserved, but we know one thing. We have
[2:15:19] a token and we'll leave it on display
[2:15:22] however long it takes." Amen. You
[2:15:23] believe that tonight? Amen. Brother
[2:15:25] Andrew has already prayed. We pray that
[2:15:27] God would bless you as you go tonight.
[2:15:30] My what a tremendous message that was
[2:15:33] been spoken here tonight. Don't let it
[2:15:34] leave your heart, but take it with you
[2:15:37] everywhere you go. Amen. Key of D.
[2:15:42] Well, I've been changed.
[2:15:46] I've been healed.
[2:15:50] Yes, I've been free.
[2:15:53] I've been delivered.
[2:15:57] Well, I found joy.
[2:16:01] I found peace.
[2:16:04] Amazing grace.
[2:16:07] I'm highly favored.
[2:16:11] And right now is the moment.
[2:16:15] Today is the day. I've been changed.
[2:16:21] Yes, I've been changed.
[2:16:24] And I said, I won't go back. I can't go
[2:16:29] back to the way it used to be before
[2:16:33] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:16:38] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[2:16:42] back to the way it used to be before
[2:16:47] your spirit came and changed me.
[2:16:52] All my shame.
[2:16:55] Yes. All my guilt.
[2:16:58] Yes. All my sins.
[2:17:01] They been forgiven.
[2:17:04] Now there's no more chains,
[2:17:08] no more fear.
[2:17:11] It's all my past
[2:17:15] is finally over.
[2:17:18] And right now
