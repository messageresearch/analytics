[38:20] [music] He's the name above all names.
[38:22] For he's [singing]

[38:33] praise
[38:35] and my heart [singing] will sing.
[38:38] [music]
[38:39] How great
[38:42] is [singing] our God. Won't you just

[38:54] Lord. I believe he's if he's done

[38:57] him a little while? Has God been good to
[39:00] you? Just give him a Just give him a
[39:01] good ovation. Say, "Lord, I thank you

[39:16] great God. Amen. He's worthy of it all.
[39:19] Can you say that this morning? He's
[39:20] worthy of it all. From him all are all
[39:23] things and to him are all things. He's
[39:26] worthy of all of our praise, all the
[39:28] glory that we could give him out of
[39:29] these mortal lips, he's worthy of it
[39:31] all. Every moment we could spend
[39:33] praising God. We never praise him
[39:34] enough. You love the Lord this morning,
[39:36] somebody turn around to somebody and
[39:38] say, "God is good."
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. We just
[39:42] love the Lord. Want to greet you in the
[39:44] name of the Lord Jesus. Want to [music]
[39:46] remember those that are gone uh this
[39:49] morning in need of prayer. Also, uh,
[39:52] Brother David Hoffman and his wife, both
[39:54] sick, ask for the church to remember
[39:55] them in prayer this morning. If you have
[39:57] a need on your heart, just maybe just
[39:59] lift your hand to the Lord. And I know
[40:01] God is mindful of all that we have need
[40:04] of. And we just want to invite the Holy
[40:05] Spirit to come into the service and
[40:08] minister to our hearts. Amen. That when
[40:10] we leave this place that we're closer to
[40:12] God than we ever were. How many say
[40:13] that's your prayer this morning? Amen.
[40:15] Let's just bow our heads. Won't each one
[40:17] just pray in your own way?
[40:21] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we
[40:23] love you, Lord. And God, we're so
[40:26] thankful for an opportunity to stand and
[40:29] to be able to speak these words of
[40:31] eternal life, Lord, knowing the value of
[40:34] the word that lays before us, Lord, and
[40:36] the Lord, the responsibility of this
[40:39] moment, Lord, of believers gathering in
[40:43] a building. Lord, I pray that it's
[40:45] something that never grows common to us.
[40:47] But Lord, what a great moment it is,
[40:49] Lord, to be able to stand in your
[40:51] presence, Lord, to be able to worship
[40:54] you, Lord, and to give you back the
[40:56] honor that uh what little that we have
[40:59] to offer you, Lord. And God, we count it
[41:02] as a privilege to serve you and to know
[41:04] you as a God and Lord, as a healer and a
[41:07] savior and all the mighty things that
[41:09] you've done for us. And Lord, we just
[41:11] ask you this morning, Lord, that you
[41:13] [music] would come down among your
[41:15] people. And Lord, that you would
[41:17] minister to every heart, Lord. I pray,
[41:19] Lord, you would drive every spirit out
[41:21] of this building, Lord, that don't
[41:22] belong. Lord, anything that would be
[41:24] here, Lord, that maybe has been
[41:26] tormenting somebody, Lord, that would
[41:28] come to hinder them from being able to
[41:30] receive something from you. But Lord, I
[41:32] just ask you this morning, the merciful
[41:35] God that you are, Lord, that you would
[41:36] move in every heart, in every life.
[41:38] Lord, I pray that there wouldn't be one
[41:40] person that would miss anything that you
[41:42] would have for on this morning. Lord,
[41:43] may the blessings of God fall upon every
[41:46] life, Lord. But I pray you would heal
[41:48] those that are sick, Lord. You would
[41:49] anoint this word to the hearers, Lord.
[41:51] We pray in Jesus name. [music] And the
[41:54] church says, "Amen." You love the Lord
[41:56] this morning. Amen. We just want to
[41:59] invite you to the scripture to John the
[42:01] 4th chapter. And we're going to read out
[42:04] of the 19th verse. John 4 and 19th
[42:07] verse. We'll read down to the 24th
[42:09] verse.
[42:15] Amen. How many feels good being in the
[42:17] house of the Lord this morning?
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cold outside and maybe just warm
[42:22] in here and just to come fellowship
[42:24] around the word. And I don't I know I
[42:28] know I say it a lot, but I just love the
[42:30] word of God. Amen. there. Uh it don't
[42:32] matter what I've ever gone through in my
[42:33] life. Uh any any major uh trial or any
[42:37] major decision uh there's none of it
[42:39] that I've ever gotten through without uh
[42:42] the word of God. Amen. So it's always
[42:44] been a guide to us. I want to read John
[42:46] the 4th chapter 19th verse. The Bible
[42:49] says the woman you it's a very familiar
[42:51] story. The woman saith unto him sir I
[42:55] perceive that thou art a prophet. Our
[42:58] fathers worshiped in this mountain. And
[43:01] you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[43:03] where men ought to worship. But Jesus
[43:05] saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the
[43:08] hour cometh, when you shall neither in
[43:10] this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem
[43:13] worship the Father. For you worship, you
[43:15] know not what. We know what we worship.
[43:18] For salvation is of the Jews. But the
[43:22] hour cometh, and now is, when the true
[43:25] worshippers shall worship the Father in
[43:27] spirit and in truth. For the Father
[43:30] seeketh such to worship him. God is a
[43:34] spirit, and they that worship him must
[43:37] worship him in spirit and in truth. And
[43:41] we'll just ask the Lord to add his
[43:43] blessing to the reading of the word as
[43:45] you take your seats this morning.
[43:47] I'd like to speak on this subject on the
[43:50] God of our fathers. The God of our
[43:53] fathers. How many knows that a god is an
[43:55] object of worship?
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly it's an object of
[43:59] worship. In other words, it's a an
[44:02] object or a person uh that you would
[44:05] give an expression of reverence to or a
[44:08] feeling or expression of reverence to
[44:10] someone or something. As believers, we
[44:13] are accustomed to worship. We live in a
[44:15] world uh that universally accepts
[44:18] spiritual things. The the world that we
[44:20] live in I I know sometimes we we think
[44:23] this the opposite way but in reality uh
[44:25] the world that we live in believes in
[44:27] the existence of a god or a higher
[44:29] power. Matter of fact nearly 90% of the
[44:31] world uh claims to believe in spiritual
[44:34] things or a higher power or a deity. Uh
[44:37] uh they believe in that. most uh only a
[44:39] small minority of the people on the
[44:41] earth uh don't believe in a god or a
[44:44] spiritual thing. There there's very few
[44:46] that don't believe uh in a god in some
[44:48] way. Uh in fact, if you study history,
[44:51] you'll find that uh uh many of the
[44:53] greatest wars that were ever fought in
[44:55] history uh was to answer the question of
[44:58] not is there a god, but what is the true
[45:00] god? Who who is this god, this creator?
[45:04] Countless millions of people have lost
[45:05] their lives uh trying to answer that
[45:08] very question, fighting over that very
[45:09] question. And brother Mark Studia uh
[45:11] studies history and it's always uh uh
[45:14] been a a battle to answer that question.
[45:16] We were created but by whom? And the
[45:19] world was made but by whom? And uh many
[45:21] questions have have uh uh risen over uh
[45:25] that very subject. Who is God? And how
[45:28] must I worship God? And what is the true
[45:30] God? many millions and millions of gods
[45:33] uh that are upon this earth and and uh
[45:36] you know I realize that we don't uh uh
[45:38] that that that our nature that that our
[45:41] nature is to worship God it's it's our
[45:44] the nature of a human being is to
[45:46] worship something it's to idolize it it
[45:48] don't matter even those that don't serve
[45:50] God and uh many in the in the in the
[45:53] world even in our our country uh they
[45:55] don't serve God but they'll claim to
[45:57] believe in God how many knows that I
[45:58] mean there's millions that'll say well I
[46:00] believe in God if If you took a poll,
[46:01] 90% they believe in a god, but maybe
[46:04] they just don't serve God. They uh they
[46:05] they serve the world. They don't go to
[46:07] church. They don't serve God in any way.
[46:09] Uh but if you would ask them, they would
[46:10] say they believed in God. And uh but but
[46:13] our nature shows us that we are we are
[46:15] worshippers or we we idolize things. Um
[46:18] uh it doesn't matter what it is. In
[46:21] fact, if you um look around our society
[46:23] and the and the great things in the
[46:25] social part of of the United States,
[46:27] you'll know that that we idolize uh
[46:29] people. We idolize uh singers. We
[46:32] idolize musicians. We idolize uh
[46:34] athletes, actors and actresses. And uh
[46:37] uh in so much that it's so such in our
[46:39] nature to worship that uh that that
[46:42] you'll notice games were where thousands
[46:44] and hundreds of thousands of people and
[46:46] uh hands raised and my get into the
[46:49] spirit of something so great uh and
[46:51] would about knock each other down if one
[46:53] of the athletes off the field would just
[46:55] so happen to walk by their car when they
[46:57] left out of the stadium. I mean it they
[46:59] couldn't even get to their car. They had
[47:00] to have security guards around them
[47:02] everywhere they go because they're so
[47:04] idolized by people because it's in our
[47:06] nature to idolize things. It's our in in
[47:09] other words that's the that's the
[47:11] inherent part of your life that as a
[47:13] worshipper causes you to idolize people
[47:15] and idolize it ain't just in sports. It
[47:17] ain't just in music but even in
[47:19] religion. Uh brother Bam said if we
[47:21] could get the superstitions of the world
[47:23] how they worship they want to become
[47:25] good uh even certain denominations and
[47:27] they're they think that if a man becomes
[47:29] real good he becomes a god to the people
[47:32] and then the people worship him as a god
[47:34] that they they even even the great
[47:37] ministers and and even in brother Bram's
[47:39] ministries the same way that there would
[47:41] be so much fanaticism around his
[47:43] ministry of those that would worship a
[47:45] great man of God as a god because it's
[47:47] in our nature to worship something. It's
[47:50] in our nature to idolize and and to
[47:52] worship or or to uh to have reverence to
[47:55] something. And and so so so we realize
[47:58] that that we didn't that that we worship
[48:00] automatically. We're going to worship
[48:01] something. We're going to worship
[48:03] somebody. Even those that don't believe
[48:05] in God and you know don't but they still
[48:07] out and they're worshiping something
[48:08] because it's in our nature. We were
[48:09] created that way. But but when we come
[48:11] to church this morning, brother Mark, we
[48:13] didn't come to worship a man, but we
[48:15] come to worship God. How many say amen?
[48:17] So we worshiped him in singing. We
[48:19] worshiped him in prayer. We worshiped
[48:21] him in our holiness, in our in our
[48:23] sacrifice. We wor we made our bodies a
[48:26] living sacrifice to come to the house of
[48:28] God. And brother Bam said, "Now that
[48:29] we've worshiped the Lord, we'll continue
[48:31] to worship him." He says, "See, so we
[48:33] worshiped him singing. We worshiped him
[48:35] in in praise. But now let's worship him
[48:37] as a cutting sharp two-edged sword as it
[48:40] moves through us to find out where we're
[48:42] standing." And here a prophet of God
[48:44] would show us that worship is not only
[48:46] just praising God in a song service.
[48:48] It's not only just lifting our hands,
[48:50] but even while we're hearing the word of
[48:52] God going forth, that we can worship God
[48:55] and entertain God, the spirit of God as
[48:57] he's moving through our lives to find
[48:59] out where it is that we're standing.
[49:01] See, see, worship has always been a part
[49:03] of our life. It's always been a part of
[49:06] who we are. It's not a new thing.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; It's not a foreign thing. Even uh before
[49:12] the world has ever began, God was alone
[49:14] with his thoughts. Remember in the
[49:15] beginning, he was that great spirit. He
[49:17] wasn't even a god because a god has to
[49:19] have something to worship him. But he he
[49:21] was an eternal one. He had nothing to
[49:23] worship him. There was no one there, no
[49:25] angels, nothing. It was just God alone.
[49:27] But brother said, but then in order for
[49:29] him to be a god, there had to be
[49:30] something to worship him. So he created
[49:33] angels and beings and cherubams to
[49:35] worship him. And then God's great plan
[49:38] began to unfold. So here they was
[49:41] created, brother Mark. And as they were
[49:43] created, they were created with the with
[49:45] the purpose of worshiping God. But how
[49:47] many knows this that whenever God
[49:48] created man, he created man with that
[49:51] same ability. How many knows that he
[49:53] created that man that you have that same
[49:55] uh purpose in you? There's a calling in
[49:57] you that calls you back to God. He
[49:59] created us with a desire to worship God.
[50:01] That's why it makes you feel so good to
[50:03] get out of this world and and come into
[50:05] a church service and and and to hear
[50:07] music and begin to lift your hands and
[50:09] close your eyes and and give worship to
[50:11] your God is because because you were
[50:13] made to do that. It's something that's
[50:15] satisfying to you. It settles the things
[50:17] of the world and those things that you
[50:19] question and all the problems that are
[50:21] going on on the outside. But when you
[50:22] can come into an atmosphere of worship
[50:25] and just worship God and forget about
[50:27] the confusion and the fights between
[50:29] this one and that one and this church
[50:30] and that church and all these things
[50:32] that that Satan builds up in our mind,
[50:34] he's trying to keep you out of that
[50:35] atmosphere of worship because that's
[50:37] where you find peace and that's where
[50:39] you find answers and that's where you
[50:41] you grow in God and and so the
[50:43] atmosphere is created that the word can
[50:45] come forth and and the whole thing is
[50:47] interacting with God in worship. See,
[50:49] it's always been here. And God God made
[50:51] that for us, brother Mah, to be a part
[50:53] of worship, even in the mind of God. Uh,
[50:55] you realize that we were we were
[50:57] worshiping God. And while the Bible says
[50:59] while God created, you realize while the
[51:01] the foundations of the earth were being
[51:04] laid, the Bible says the sons of God
[51:05] were shouting for joy at at seeing the
[51:08] foundation of the earth being laid. They
[51:10] shouted for joy. at seeing God's plan to
[51:13] come out of the mind of God and begin uh
[51:15] and to begin to to be laid as a as a
[51:18] foundation upon the world. And here that
[51:20] those sons of God back there saw the
[51:22] plan of God as they were there in the
[51:24] mind of God. And as God began to lay
[51:27] that plan out upon the earth, something
[51:29] inside them begin to shout and to praise
[51:31] God because they saw God's great eternal
[51:34] plan. And do you realize that that we
[51:35] always belong to God? If you were, if
[51:37] your name's written in the lamb's book
[51:39] of life, God is an eternal God. He
[51:41] predestinated you by his fornowledge.
[51:43] You were in the mind of God before the
[51:45] foundation of the world. Even Jesus was
[51:48] in the mind of God. It was his plan all
[51:50] along. Even when he wasn't born, brother
[51:51] Bam said, "But God slayed him before the
[51:53] foundation of the world in his own
[51:55] mind." And when that so whenever he came
[51:57] to the earth, the work had already been
[51:59] done in the mind of God before God ever
[52:02] created before he said, "Let there be
[52:04] light." before he created the earth in
[52:06] the mind of God, the whole plan of God
[52:08] had already unfolded. He's an eternal
[52:10] God. He knew how nothing ever caught God
[52:13] offguard. He He knew what was going to
[52:15] take place. And and even you and I, we
[52:17] may not have been there. We may not have
[52:19] been born. We weren't there in the
[52:21] natural, but Ram said, "I wasn't there.
[52:22] Neither was you there. But but if our
[52:24] name was in the lamb's book of life,
[52:27] then our names are over there. It was
[52:28] put on there before the foundation of
[52:31] the world. We may not have been there in
[52:33] person, but before the foundation of the
[52:35] world, we were there in spirit. God knew
[52:37] us in the mind of God. And see, so, but
[52:40] when God created us, he didn't want us
[52:42] to be like angels. He He God had enough
[52:44] angels. Can I just say it like that?
[52:45] Just some plain Arkansas talk. But God
[52:47] had enough angels that just worshiped
[52:49] God because they had to. He had enough
[52:51] that was created by the thousands that
[52:53] that just worship God and stay before
[52:55] the throne of God, constantly worshiping
[52:57] God. But God wanted a man that had free
[53:00] will, a man that would worship him and
[53:03] choose uh that and desire to worship God
[53:06] and by choice he would go and he would
[53:08] worship his maker and worship his
[53:10] creator. You know, because Satan that
[53:11] that Lucifer that that that old devil
[53:14] had made it in such a way that that that
[53:16] that nobody the only reason that the
[53:18] angels worship God is because he forced
[53:20] them to do it. And and if you ever give
[53:22] me a shot at them, they wouldn't they
[53:24] wouldn't worship you no more. So God
[53:25] created man and gave man a free will.
[53:28] Gave us a free choice. The Bible says he
[53:30] or or brother said he created Eve
[53:32] knowing that she would fall. But still
[53:34] yet he gave her a choice. And when she
[53:36] came to this earth by choice because of
[53:39] the fall in the garden, it brought death
[53:41] upon upon mankind. But but after the
[53:44] fall of God, notice what God done is he
[53:46] came into the garden. He slew a lamb in
[53:49] the garden. and the lamb that altar of
[53:51] sacrifice where the lamb was slain
[53:54] became a place of worship between God
[53:56] and man. So here he introduces a place
[53:59] to worship God. It was a it was an altar
[54:02] of sacrifice who of course you know uh
[54:04] the history of of Cain and Abel and how
[54:07] uh that they had came as brothers and
[54:08] they were both taught how to worship God
[54:10] and how to bring a sacrifice unto God
[54:13] and and so so that's what would cause
[54:15] the uh the disagreement between the
[54:17] brothers is because one would bring the
[54:20] flowers and and and the fruits of his
[54:22] labor but the other would bring a lamb
[54:24] and he would slay the lamb and and do it
[54:27] exactly just as God had done because
[54:29] what They laid up on the altar, brother
[54:31] Mark, it was an act of worship. They
[54:33] were just trying to fulfill what was on
[54:36] the inside of them to be a worshshiper.
[54:38] That's why Cain, although his worship
[54:40] wasn't the right kind of worship, but
[54:41] there was something on the inside of him
[54:43] that caused him to want to worship
[54:45] because we are created that way. We're
[54:48] made to with a desire to worship where
[54:50] there's something in us that causes us
[54:52] to want to worship something. So see
[54:55] after it became a a a place of
[54:58] sacrifice, it became a law of God to go
[55:01] to the altar of sacrifice and to bring
[55:03] worship unto God. So but before the
[55:05] people could worship God, there had to
[55:07] be sacrifices made. So when they would
[55:10] come to worship God all through the the
[55:12] Old Testament as the laws of God, when
[55:14] they would come to worship, they would
[55:15] have to sanctify the altar and and then
[55:18] the and sanctify it and cleanse it with
[55:20] a burnt offering in order to sanctify
[55:22] the place of their worship. And so they
[55:24] would come in, remember that was the
[55:26] order God gave to Moses. Before they
[55:28] come and lay anything upon the altar,
[55:30] first you come and cleanse the altar so
[55:32] that everything that's laid upon it
[55:35] would be accepted by God. I I thought,
[55:37] isn't that a wonderful instruction in
[55:38] the Old Testament, and it still applies
[55:40] today, that a sanctified altar is the
[55:43] place that you can lay a sacrifice on,
[55:45] and God will accept your sacrifice.
[55:47] Because I I I don't know about you, but
[55:49] but there ain't none of us that want to
[55:51] worship a God that won't hear our
[55:52] worship. No. Nobody wants to worship a
[55:54] god that won't that won't accept your
[55:56] sacrifice. How many how many wants to
[55:58] come and serve God and God not accept
[56:00] your your serving? But our desire to
[56:02] worship is a desire to have a personal
[56:05] relationship with God. Somebody say
[56:06] amen. Our desire to worship is a desire
[56:09] to have communion. It's a it's a desire
[56:11] to fellowship. It's a a desire that our
[56:13] that our sacrifice would be a sweet
[56:16] smelling savor. It would be accepted by
[56:18] God. it would it would be a delight in
[56:21] the in the in the in the in the mind of
[56:23] God or in the heart of God that our
[56:24] worship would be a delight unto God.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; So here it's our desire to worship
[56:30] &gt;&gt; and it's not only our desire to worship
[56:32] but it's desire to worship our God.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; So here when we open this scripture in
[56:40] John the 4th chapter we realize that
[56:42] these Samaritans were a a a special
[56:45] class of people. The Samaritans, they
[56:46] believed in the patriarchs of the Bible
[56:49] or the fathers of the Bible. They
[56:50] believed Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of
[56:52] course, being the the patriarchs. And
[56:54] actually, in their teaching, in the
[56:56] Samaritan teaching, they're still
[56:57] Samaritans today. In the Samaritan
[56:59] teaching, they keep the they kept the
[57:01] patriarchal law or the Mosaic covenant,
[57:04] they believed to keep it. And in in
[57:06] fact, they have their own Torah outside
[57:08] of the Hebrew Torah. In the Samaritan
[57:10] Torah, they believe it to be the
[57:11] original unchanged version of the pench
[57:14] that came uh uh from Moses uh to the
[57:17] Israelites on Mount Si. They believe
[57:18] they actually have the original uh in
[57:21] their possession of the Samaritan people
[57:23] uh for for hundreds and even thousands
[57:25] of years. They have what's called the
[57:27] Aisha scroll. The Aisha scroll was
[57:29] written by uh the son of Aaron, the one
[57:31] of the priests. It was the son of Aaron,
[57:33] the high priest. And and they believe
[57:35] that this scroll is the oldest actual
[57:37] scroll that ever existed. It was a
[57:38] 3,000-y old scroll. Of course, the
[57:40] Christians and the Jews have tried to
[57:42] disprove that and to none avail to the
[57:44] Samaritans. But but but they they they
[57:47] so believe in in in where they are and
[57:49] what they and and the God uh the
[57:52] patriarchs of the Bible and who God is
[57:54] and their connection with God and and
[57:56] and they believe that the summit of
[57:58] Mount Jerism, it's right in Samaria, is
[58:00] right where the Mount Jerism is. And
[58:02] they believe it to be the true location
[58:04] of God's holy place. And so they believe
[58:06] this is the place they actually can
[58:08] trace their history uh that soon after
[58:10] the Israelites entered into the promised
[58:12] land that by Samaritan history that that
[58:15] there was a division among the high
[58:17] priest Eli and then the and then the the
[58:20] high priest Uzi which is in 1 Chronicles
[58:22] the the I believe it's the sixth chapter
[58:24] you can read the descendants of Aaron
[58:26] the high priest but maybe the fourth
[58:28] generation down from Aaron was the high
[58:30] priest uzi and so here the Samaritan
[58:32] people would actually tell you that that
[58:35] that Eli, which was a which became a
[58:37] wealthy priest, and he he was he was a
[58:40] he was a reckless priest. And they would
[58:42] say that he would he went down to the
[58:44] altar and and and there was a division
[58:46] between him and and the and Uzzie the
[58:48] the the the high priest and and that
[58:51] that whenever he would go down to the
[58:53] altar, he he left he left such a a
[58:55] division that the Israelite leader cast
[58:58] him away or or b or or rebuked him and
[59:00] he went into shallow and formed what we
[59:03] know now as Jerusalem or Judah. And so
[59:05] it was a division of the people of God
[59:08] that caused all of this. And so you say,
[59:09] "Well, what was the division about?" I'm
[59:11] just telling you some Samaritan history,
[59:12] but the division they they would say is
[59:15] because that Eli offered a sacrifice,
[59:18] but his sacrifice was offered without
[59:20] salt. And so, in other words, he was
[59:22] inattentive to the sacrifice. He wasn't
[59:24] uh he he was reckless in his sacrifice.
[59:26] And here as a of course if you study in
[59:28] that history of time uh there was two
[59:30] priests that that God had actually taken
[59:32] their life because of the way that they
[59:34] sacrificed them because they were
[59:36] reckless and they they were doing things
[59:38] in the church with you know with you
[59:40] know with with women and money and all
[59:41] these things in the church. And so God
[59:43] actually took their life and then the
[59:44] same the same angel of death actually
[59:47] visited their father who was a high
[59:48] priest. And so so so there was many
[59:50] things that went on in the priesthood
[59:52] that so so in in all of this time period
[59:55] the Samaritans said there was a great
[59:56] division and that he that Eli made a
[59:59] sacrifice but he didn't use salt and so
[1:00:01] when the great high priest uzi heard of
[1:00:03] it he found the sacrifice wasn't
[1:00:05] accepted by God and he disowned him and
[1:00:08] rebuked him. But those that sympathize
[1:00:10] with Eli when he went to Shiloh they
[1:00:12] formed what today is Judah or Israel be
[1:00:15] because they they there was a great
[1:00:16] division among the people. And so you
[1:00:18] realize that th that this is a this is
[1:00:20] the Samaritan history. They they believe
[1:00:23] in this place and they believe in the
[1:00:24] mountain. There was a great division and
[1:00:26] no doubt we have no way of knowing
[1:00:27] exactly what took place. But in that
[1:00:29] history there was certainly something
[1:00:31] that divided people. And so uh maybe
[1:00:33] maybe it was that may or or what it was.
[1:00:35] We don't really know uh all the things.
[1:00:37] They try to prove it and find history.
[1:00:38] But uh but but we know there was
[1:00:40] something that caused such division. But
[1:00:42] but this is what the Samaritans believe.
[1:00:44] This is what they believe took place.
[1:00:46] And so this is what actually caused or
[1:00:48] or the conversation at Jacob's well to
[1:00:51] turn to worship. So here was a woman
[1:00:53] that was a Samaritan and had a different
[1:00:55] background than the Jews. So here she
[1:00:57] sat on Jacob's well under the shadow of
[1:01:00] Mount Jerism. Now now according to their
[1:01:02] tradition as she was raised her whole
[1:01:04] life uh and taught there was such a
[1:01:06] segregation between the Samaritans and
[1:01:08] Jews because there was a division in the
[1:01:10] priesthood. They they had kept their
[1:01:12] belief. They had kept and the and the
[1:01:14] Israel had kept their belief but they
[1:01:16] actually believe that Mount Jerism is
[1:01:18] the oldest and most central mountain in
[1:01:20] the world. They believe that Mount
[1:01:21] Jerism is the place that the only place
[1:01:23] that stood above the great flood when
[1:01:25] the when the earth was flooded in the
[1:01:27] days of Noah. They believe that the the
[1:01:29] uh that the ark of Noah landed at Mount
[1:01:31] Jerism. They believe that the Mount
[1:01:33] Jerism was the holy place. They believe
[1:01:35] it was where Abraham took Isaac when he
[1:01:37] laid him and and would take him to
[1:01:39] sacrifice Isaac. they uh instead of what
[1:01:42] the Jews believe that it was on Mount
[1:01:43] Mariah, the Samaritans believe that
[1:01:45] Mount Jerism is the place of God or
[1:01:47] where the holy temple was rather than
[1:01:49] Jerusalem's temple mount. They they they
[1:01:51] they as much as the Jews believe that
[1:01:54] God that the temple mount was a holy
[1:01:56] temple, that's how much the Samaritans
[1:01:58] believe that Mount Jerisum was a place
[1:02:00] of the holy temple. in fact in so much
[1:02:02] that for 300 years they had a great
[1:02:05] temple built upon Mount Jerism just a
[1:02:07] few hundred years before Jesus came to
[1:02:09] the earth and so this was a great thing
[1:02:12] to them even to this day three times a
[1:02:14] year the Samaritans actually ascend up
[1:02:17] that mountain on the at the Passover
[1:02:19] shabbat and suck up they they go up that
[1:02:21] mountain they make that journey every
[1:02:23] year under that holy under that holy
[1:02:25] place with God and so it is a it is a
[1:02:28] great holy place this was the division
[1:02:30] between the Samaritan and the Jews is
[1:02:32] the Jews had a holy temple on a holy
[1:02:35] mountain in Jerusalem. They believed
[1:02:37] that that what happened on Mount Mariah
[1:02:39] is where Abraham took his son. And here
[1:02:41] on the other side is the Samaritans
[1:02:42] saying, "No, it wasn't on your mountain.
[1:02:44] It was on our mountain. It was on Mount
[1:02:46] Jerism that it took place and y'all
[1:02:48] robbed us of it and you went and built
[1:02:49] your own temple and you started your own
[1:02:51] religion and you took our God and you
[1:02:53] took our uh the God of our fathers and
[1:02:55] you took them somewhere else and you
[1:02:56] tried to form some some other thing." So
[1:02:58] there was a great division and
[1:03:00] segregation among the Samaritan and
[1:03:02] among the Jews. So here at the at
[1:03:05] Jacob's well sets a Jew and a Samaritan
[1:03:08] having a conversation. And to even think
[1:03:11] of of of having a a religious
[1:03:13] conversation is immediately going to
[1:03:15] bring division because this is how the
[1:03:17] Samaritan and the Jew was raised. But
[1:03:19] the Bible said that Jesus being wearied
[1:03:22] with his journey, he sat on the well,
[1:03:25] and it was about the sixth hour. There
[1:03:27] cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.
[1:03:29] And Jesus said to her, "Give me to
[1:03:31] drink." She said, "Well, how is it that
[1:03:33] you being a Jew asked me which a woman
[1:03:35] of Samaria? For the Jews have no
[1:03:37] dealings with the Samaritans, but Jesus
[1:03:39] said, if you knew the gift of God, who
[1:03:41] that said to you, give me a drink, you
[1:03:42] would have asked him, and he would have
[1:03:44] given you living water." And the woman
[1:03:46] said, "Well, I you have nothing to draw
[1:03:48] with." And the well is deep. So when
[1:03:50] where do you have this living water? Now
[1:03:52] notice where she turns this because
[1:03:54] because she's been taught by the
[1:03:56] tradition of her fathers, she says, or
[1:03:59] and whence do you have that living
[1:04:00] water? And are you greater than our
[1:04:03] father Jacob that gave us this well and
[1:04:05] drink hereof himself and his children
[1:04:07] and his cattle? See, they were firm
[1:04:09] believers in their forefathers and the
[1:04:11] patriarchs of the Bible. And so and so
[1:04:14] Jesus said, "Well, whosoever drink of
[1:04:16] this water would thirst again, but
[1:04:17] whoever drinks of the water that I would
[1:04:19] give him would never thirst, but the
[1:04:21] water that I will give him shall be in
[1:04:22] him a well of water springing up into
[1:04:26] everlasting life." Now notice what the
[1:04:28] woman does. She says to him, "Sir, give
[1:04:31] me of this water that I thirst not, and
[1:04:34] neither have to come back to this well
[1:04:36] to draw." See immediately she shows us
[1:04:39] something is that she wanted something
[1:04:41] greater than the tradition of her
[1:04:43] fathers. Her first word was said are you
[1:04:45] greater than our father Jacob? Are are
[1:04:47] you greater than the tradition of our
[1:04:48] fathers? Or is there something better
[1:04:49] about you than Jacob? Jacob made this
[1:04:52] well and Jacob's family drank from this
[1:04:53] well and Jacob's children drank from
[1:04:55] this well and Jacob's cattle drank from
[1:04:57] this well. Are you greater than he? But
[1:04:59] then whenever whenever he tells her
[1:05:01] about another well and a water that's
[1:05:03] springing up that could give everlasting
[1:05:05] life, she said, "I you know I mean my my
[1:05:07] the tradition of my fathers maybe maybe
[1:05:09] it wouldn't bring me it. It it don't
[1:05:11] promise something like that." But she
[1:05:12] turns from that tradition and shows that
[1:05:14] there's something greater in her than
[1:05:16] just following after the tradition of
[1:05:18] her fathers or the people that she was
[1:05:20] raised by. And so here when she asked
[1:05:22] for that, give me a drink of this. What
[1:05:24] did Jesus do? The Bible says he told her
[1:05:27] all the things that she had ever done.
[1:05:28] He told her about her life. He told her
[1:05:30] about her past. He told her about her
[1:05:32] history. He told her about her her
[1:05:33] family problems, her problems growing
[1:05:35] up, problems with her daddy, problems
[1:05:37] with her mama. She said, "He told me all
[1:05:39] the things that I'd ever done, all the
[1:05:41] mistakes, all the wrongdoings. He sat on
[1:05:43] that well and discerned her entire life.
[1:05:46] And he told her about her life." And as
[1:05:48] he began to tell her about her life, she
[1:05:50] said, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a
[1:05:52] prophet." So, she recognized him as a
[1:05:54] prophet of God. And so, just and so and
[1:05:57] because she recognized him as a prophet,
[1:05:59] notice where she takes this because
[1:06:01] they're not talking about this subject.
[1:06:03] But because she recognized him as a
[1:06:05] prophet here in her heart, she begins to
[1:06:07] think maybe, just maybe, he can answer
[1:06:10] the question that has troubled all of
[1:06:13] our people this whole time. So, here she
[1:06:15] said, "I perceive that thou art a
[1:06:17] prophet." And then notice where she
[1:06:18] goes. She says, "Our fathers worshiped
[1:06:21] in this mountain, but you say that in
[1:06:23] Jerusalem is the place that men ought to
[1:06:25] worship." I thought, "Isn't that of all
[1:06:27] the things that you could ask a prophet
[1:06:28] of God?" Of all the questions that you
[1:06:30] could ask them, what can I do to make my
[1:06:32] life? What can I do to have eternal
[1:06:34] life? What all the questions that we
[1:06:36] could ask, if we recognize that the
[1:06:38] prophet of God was setting before us of
[1:06:40] all the things she could ask, it was the
[1:06:41] greatest question that she knew to ask.
[1:06:43] Y'all say worship in this mountain. It
[1:06:45] was the greatest division. Yeah, it was
[1:06:47] the problem between all of the fathers
[1:06:49] of both nations. It's what caused the
[1:06:51] segregation. And that was the question
[1:06:53] that she asked him. Our fathers
[1:06:55] worshiped in this mountain, but you say
[1:06:56] that men ought to worship in that
[1:06:58] mountain. But Jesus said unto her, he
[1:07:00] said,"Woman, believe me that the hour
[1:07:02] cometh when you shall neither in this
[1:07:04] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[1:07:06] the Father." Friends, there was a woman
[1:07:08] that sat at the well that had a desire
[1:07:10] to worship God. And she didn't want to
[1:07:12] be wrong. She had heard what the
[1:07:14] Samaritans said about it and she heard
[1:07:15] what the Jews said about it. She had
[1:07:17] heard enough division between Jerism and
[1:07:20] the and the Temple Mount. She she had
[1:07:22] heard enough people argue about it and
[1:07:23] enough people bicker about it and enough
[1:07:25] people fight and say, "No, this is how
[1:07:27] you worship God. That's how you worship
[1:07:29] God and this is how you have church and
[1:07:31] that's how you conduct service." And she
[1:07:32] had heard so much about it that she that
[1:07:35] that she was just torn to pieces of
[1:07:37] hearing about it. But when she got in
[1:07:39] the presence of a prophet of God, she
[1:07:41] said, "I perceive that thou art a
[1:07:42] prophet. And if you're a prophet of God,
[1:07:44] you must have THE ANSWER. AND HOW IS IT
[1:07:47] THAT I MUST WORSHIP GOD? MUST I WORSHIP
[1:07:49] AT THE TEMPLE of Jerusalem, or must I
[1:07:52] worship at the temple of Jerusalem?" But
[1:07:54] Jesus said, "Believe me, neither in this
[1:07:56] mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem do you
[1:07:58] worship the Father. For you worship, you
[1:08:01] know not what, but we know what we
[1:08:03] worship. For salvation is of the Jews.
[1:08:05] But the hour cometh, and now is.
[1:08:07] Somebody say, "Now is." That when the
[1:08:09] true worshippers shall worship the
[1:08:11] Father in spirit and in truth. For the
[1:08:13] worshipper seeketh such to worship him
[1:08:16] for or the father seeketh such to
[1:08:17] worship him. For God is a spirit.
[1:08:20] Somebody say, "A spirit."
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And they that worship him must worship
[1:08:24] him in spirit and in truth.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; The woman said, "I know the Messiah
[1:08:28] cometh, which is called Christ, and when
[1:08:30] he comes, he will tell us all things."
[1:08:32] And Jesus said, "I that speak unto thee
[1:08:35] am he." You know what the Bible says?
[1:08:37] The woman left her water pot. She went
[1:08:39] into the village, into the city, and she
[1:08:41] said, "Come and see a man that told me
[1:08:43] all the things that I've ever done." Let
[1:08:46] me tell you what he told her. He told
[1:08:47] her how to get back past her problems.
[1:08:49] He told her how to get past her past. He
[1:08:52] told her how to get past all the
[1:08:53] traditions of her of her fathers. And he
[1:08:55] told her how that she could really have
[1:08:57] a relationship with God. He told her how
[1:09:00] to satisfy that longing in her heart to
[1:09:02] worship God and that real desire for
[1:09:04] true worship. And he answered the very
[1:09:06] question that she had in her heart. I
[1:09:08] want to be a true worshipper. I want Oh,
[1:09:10] you think friends that if he didn't know
[1:09:12] everything that had took place in her
[1:09:14] life that he didn't know what she was
[1:09:15] really asking when she asked about the
[1:09:17] mountain, he said that that God is a
[1:09:19] spirit and they that worship him. He
[1:09:21] answered a question that she didn't even
[1:09:22] ask. If you really want to worship God,
[1:09:24] the only way to worship him is to
[1:09:26] worship HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH,
[1:09:28] DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN. DON'T
[1:09:30] WORRY ABOUT THAT MOUNTAIN OR THAT NATION
[1:09:32] or the FIGHT OR THE FEW BETWEEN THIS AND
[1:09:34] or the other. BUT JUST GET ALONE WITH
[1:09:36] GOD AND WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN
[1:09:38] TRUTH.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT CHURCH YOU GO TO. I
[1:09:41] DON'T CARE WHO YOUR PASTOR IS. I DON'T
[1:09:43] CARE WHAT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS ONE OR
[1:09:45] THAT ONE. BUT WE AIN'T WORSHIPING ON
[1:09:47] THAT MOUNTAIN OR THIS mountain or this
[1:09:49] church OR THAT CHURCH. GOD DON'T CALL US
[1:09:51] TO A PLACE LIKE THAT JUST TO WORSHIP
[1:09:53] GOD. HE SAID, "BUT NOW IS THE TIME that
[1:09:55] God is a spirit AND THEY THAT WORSHIP
[1:09:58] HIM MUST WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT, HAND in
[1:10:00] truth."
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And brother Noah, she caught a
[1:10:04] revelation of true worship. And it went
[1:10:07] beyond the traditions of her fathers
[1:10:09] that the Messiah, you know what the
[1:10:10] traditions of her father? The Messiah
[1:10:12] was going to come and restore the temple
[1:10:15] of Jerusalem. That's what the Samaritans
[1:10:17] believe. But when she saw the Messa
[1:10:20] sign, it wasn't pointing to Mount
[1:10:21] Jerism. It wasn't pointing to the Temple
[1:10:24] Mount. It was pointing to a holy
[1:10:25] mountain. A holy Hallelujah. It was
[1:10:28] pointing to a holy God, a holy mountain,
[1:10:31] a temple that was not made by man's
[1:10:34] hands.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; You worship a God that you know not
[1:10:38] what.
[1:10:40] Even around the world, he said, "See,
[1:10:42] God is a spirit." Around the world,
[1:10:44] there's many that worship things. But
[1:10:47] you notice most people worship things
[1:10:48] that they can see.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is answering. God is
[1:10:52] a spirit. In Africa, there's actually
[1:10:54] most of South Africa, some of the great
[1:10:57] uh religions would say that you worship
[1:10:59] a God that you worship a God as
[1:11:01] Christians
[1:11:03] that's a force that you can't see. And
[1:11:05] we have to have something in order to
[1:11:08] worship it. I've got to see it to
[1:11:09] believe it. I've got to see it to
[1:11:10] worship it. How many knows what that is?
[1:11:12] If I got to see it to worship it, it's
[1:11:14] idolatry. I have to see it to worship
[1:11:16] it. I I But and you Christians, y'all
[1:11:18] worship something that's just a force in
[1:11:20] the wind. You're worshiping a spirit.
[1:11:22] But but don't you realize that's what
[1:11:23] Jesus said? He said God is a spirit.
[1:11:25] They that worship him must worship him
[1:11:27] in spirit and truth. And brother Bam
[1:11:29] said, "And they are led by the same
[1:11:31] spirit." Friends, let me take a while on
[1:11:33] that. Are you hearing me? Does somebody
[1:11:34] hear that? He said, "You worship him in
[1:11:37] spirit and in truth, and you're led by
[1:11:39] the same spirit." That means that you
[1:11:42] are led by the spirit that you worship.
[1:11:44] Hello, somebody. So, if you worship a
[1:11:46] spirit of error, it's going to lead you
[1:11:48] into error. If you worship a spirit of
[1:11:50] truth, it'll lead you into truth. Isn't
[1:11:52] that what happened with Moses? Moses was
[1:11:54] a man of God that was led by the spirit
[1:11:56] of God. But do you realize there was a
[1:11:57] time in Moses's life he was not led by
[1:11:59] God because it wasn't the spirit of God
[1:12:01] that he was worshiping. But there was a
[1:12:03] time he wanted to lead himself. And he
[1:12:05] got all the way down there in Egypt and
[1:12:07] he saw the condition of his people. and
[1:12:09] he saw that that old uh taskmaster
[1:12:11] whooping uh uh one of the the the
[1:12:13] Israelites and because he's a military
[1:12:15] mind. He was a great man and he was
[1:12:17] taught in the military. He went to to
[1:12:19] try try to set everything in order.
[1:12:20] Brother said see he he thought he could
[1:12:23] get go out and do it right himself but
[1:12:24] he found himself a failure. He said
[1:12:26] because every tech technique he started
[1:12:28] was wrong. He slew a man because that's
[1:12:30] what the military taught him is to go
[1:12:32] kill somebody if they're doing something
[1:12:34] wrong. So he went out on his military
[1:12:36] education. and he slew a man and it
[1:12:38] caused him, what's the result of his
[1:12:40] slaying? It caused him to be a stranger
[1:12:42] to his brethren for 40 years. He said,
[1:12:45] "But one day an old shepherd, he was
[1:12:48] walking out on the backside of a desert
[1:12:49] in the at the end of that 40 years and
[1:12:52] the first thing you know, he came into
[1:12:53] the presence of God and when he did, the
[1:12:56] Holy Ghost got a got a fire bush there
[1:12:58] and he told Moses more about his leading
[1:13:00] in five minutes than all the years of
[1:13:02] training that he ever had. And he had to
[1:13:04] take that military out of him and put a
[1:13:07] real genuine Holy Spirit in him so that
[1:13:10] he could be led by the spirit of God. So
[1:13:13] see, he had to take that that old
[1:13:15] worship and that old he had been raised
[1:13:17] up with those those those Egyptian gods
[1:13:19] and and and you know, you say maybe
[1:13:21] Moses was a great man and he wouldn't
[1:13:23] worship those gods, but he still had his
[1:13:25] studies and he still depended on his
[1:13:27] military and his training and all all of
[1:13:29] that. And because he was so into that,
[1:13:31] whenever he saw an opportunity, he slew
[1:13:33] a man. But you realize it wasn't the
[1:13:35] spirit of God that was leading him. He
[1:13:37] said, "But God had to come and take that
[1:13:39] out of him and put a real genuine Holy
[1:13:41] Spirit in him." So somebody say, "Amen."
[1:13:44] He had to put a real genuine Holy Spirit
[1:13:46] in him so that he could be led by the
[1:13:48] spirit. So you know what that tells me?
[1:13:50] That depending on the spirit you follow,
[1:13:52] it will determine the result in your
[1:13:54] life. It'll determine the result of
[1:13:56] every situation, every every question
[1:13:58] you have you need an answer to. So, in
[1:14:01] other words, brother Mark, you can't
[1:14:02] follow a bad spirit and expect a good
[1:14:05] result. Hello, somebody. You can't
[1:14:07] follow a bad spirit and expect a good
[1:14:09] result, BUT YOU HAVE TO worship the
[1:14:11] right spirit. And that spirit you
[1:14:13] worship is what's leading you. And it
[1:14:15] will bring you to a desired result. Oh,
[1:14:17] friend, can I can I just preach a
[1:14:19] minute? Sometimes you see people and
[1:14:20] there's something wrong with their body.
[1:14:22] Maybe there's a sickness, but if you
[1:14:23] aren't careful, you you'll find yourself
[1:14:26] worshiping the spirit of the sickness. I
[1:14:28] I I I get to hear uh brother Ron tell
[1:14:30] his testimony uh so many times that he
[1:14:32] was diagnosed with cancer and and and
[1:14:34] and terrible cancer all over his body
[1:14:37] many uh months ago that he was supposed
[1:14:39] to he was supposed to die. But you know
[1:14:41] what? You'll never find him doing I've
[1:14:43] never one time found him worshiping the
[1:14:45] spirit of that cancer. You know what?
[1:14:46] And because he's not worshiping that
[1:14:48] spirit, then that spirit's not leading
[1:14:50] him. And so every time he talks about he
[1:14:52] says, "God is good and I'll live as long
[1:14:54] as God wants me to live. And when God's
[1:14:56] done with me on this earth, then God's
[1:14:58] going to take me off this earth." How
[1:14:59] can a man say that when his body's
[1:15:01] filled with cancer is because he's not
[1:15:03] worshiping the spirit of cancer, but
[1:15:05] he's worshiping the spirit of God and
[1:15:07] he's led by the spirit that he is
[1:15:09] worshiping. AND SO HERE WE FIND
[1:15:11] OURSELVES SO MANY TIMES GETTING CAUGHT
[1:15:13] up under a spirit and maybe it's a
[1:15:15] sickness or something and we get so
[1:15:17] negative or the spirit oh I'm going to
[1:15:18] get in trouble but it's let me just oh
[1:15:20] let me just help you out this morning.
[1:15:22] But when YOU WORSHIP THAT SPIRIT all of
[1:15:24] a sudden that's what's leading your
[1:15:25] whole entire life and you get so
[1:15:27] negative and down. I got a problem I
[1:15:29] can't get over. And if you knew what I
[1:15:31] was going through, why you wouldn't feel
[1:15:32] that way towards me and maybe nobody
[1:15:34] even feels bad. But in your mind, they
[1:15:36] do because you're being led by the
[1:15:37] spirit. You worship. AND BECAUSE YOU'VE
[1:15:39] BEEN CAUGHT UP BY THAT spirit of
[1:15:41] negativity, and I'm never going to be
[1:15:43] well, and and this is just the way I am,
[1:15:45] and this is just the problem of my life,
[1:15:47] and this is my sickness, and this is my
[1:15:49] problem, and these ARE MY FEELINGS. OH,
[1:15:50] IF YOU FELT LIKE I DO, IF YOU KNEW WHAT
[1:15:52] I went through, OH, I'M SO MISTREATED.
[1:15:54] THERE AIN'T NOBODY LIKE ME. UH, BUT
[1:15:56] FRIENDS, CAN I JUST SAY THIS THIS
[1:15:57] MORNING that we are Christians. How many
[1:15:59] Christians are there? We're Christians.
[1:16:01] And I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE AS
[1:16:03] CHRISTIANS handle our problems like
[1:16:04] Christians instead of like pagans do.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. We're Christians. And
[1:16:10] Christians don't handle things like
[1:16:12] pagans handle things. Christians aren't
[1:16:14] supposed to be led by the spirit of
[1:16:16] fear. We ain't supposed TO BE LED BY THE
[1:16:18] SPIRIT OF CONFUSION. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
[1:16:20] TO BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF A SICKNESS OR
[1:16:22] AN AILMENT, BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LED
[1:16:24] BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THE BIBLE SAYS,
[1:16:26] "SONS OF GOD ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF
[1:16:28] GOD."
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Not to be led by the spirit, some
[1:16:32] sickness. No wonder people are down. Get
[1:16:34] the negativity out OF YOUR HOUSE AND
[1:16:36] WATCH healing come to your body. Get the
[1:16:38] negative, friends. I'm just giving you
[1:16:39] some help this morning. But if you'll
[1:16:40] TAKE THE NEGATIVITY OUT, HOW CAN GOD
[1:16:43] EVEN HEAL YOU? If it's all about
[1:16:45] negative and all about how bad it is and
[1:16:48] how worse IT IS AND HOW I GOT IT WORSE
[1:16:49] THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AIN'T NOBODY EVER
[1:16:51] FELT LIKE I FELT. AIN'T NOBODY that
[1:16:53] that's been mistreated like I've BEEN
[1:16:55] MISTREATED. GET THE NEGATIVITY out of
[1:16:56] your life
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; so that healing can come to your home.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Healing can come to your body
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; to see because you're being led by the
[1:17:05] spirit that you worship. It's so easy to
[1:17:07] to settle into that spirit
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; and worship it.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody get a little problem. That's
[1:17:14] all there you God forbid you go bound.
[1:17:16] How are you today? God bless you. Good
[1:17:17] to see you. How are you today?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they worship the spirit.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; They want the problem.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; They love the problem.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And they
[1:17:30] there's something in them that that the
[1:17:32] attention of it or whatever whatever it
[1:17:34] is, they worship the spirit of it. Don't
[1:17:36] ever get caught up worshiping the spirit
[1:17:38] of a problem.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; This is the worst time. You know, I
[1:17:42] heard somebody say this the other day
[1:17:44] said, you know, this is the worst time
[1:17:45] in the world for problems. There's more
[1:17:47] problems in the world today than there
[1:17:48] ever has been. How many knows that?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; So, see, it's the worst problems that
[1:17:52] the world has ever had. So, it's the
[1:17:54] worst time in the world to be a problem.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It's the worst problems we've ever had.
[1:17:59] It's the worst time to be a problem.
[1:18:00] Don't be a problem. Be a solution.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Don't be a negative. be a positive.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; You have children and people that that
[1:18:08] look to you and are and friends and
[1:18:09] family that look to you. So don't so
[1:18:11] don't get caught up in something that
[1:18:12] took place in your life and allow it to
[1:18:14] negatively affect everybody around you.
[1:18:16] Somebody in the home has to turn back
[1:18:18] and say, "I'm not worshiping that
[1:18:20] spirit." Hello, somebody. Somebody in
[1:18:22] the household has to rise up and say,
[1:18:24] "I'm not going to bow down to that
[1:18:26] spirit. I know it came. I know it
[1:18:28] happened. I know it took place. I know
[1:18:30] the HISTORY OF IT, BUT YOU'LL NOT CATCH
[1:18:32] ME BOWING DOWN to that spirit. I won't
[1:18:34] worship it. It come from the devil. It
[1:18:36] didn't COME FROM GOD. MY GOD IS A
[1:18:38] HEALER. HE'S A DELIVERER. HE'S A SAVIOR.
[1:18:40] AND I STILL BELIEVE IT. AND I WORSHIP
[1:18:42] GOD. I'LL BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:18:45] AND BECAUSE I'M LED BY THE SPIRIT OF
[1:18:46] GOD, THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL BRING
[1:18:48] HEALING TO MY BODY.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I think it's time we handle things like
[1:18:54] Christians.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; See, the result you get comes from the
[1:18:59] spirit you're worshiping.
[1:19:02] That's right.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Comes from the spirit you're worshiping.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; So if you want healing, here it is.
[1:19:08] Don't worship the spirit of a sickness.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of a sickness don't
[1:19:13] bring healing.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God does.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; If you need deliverance, well, don't
[1:19:18] worship the spirit of an addiction.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of an addiction don't
[1:19:22] bring deliverance. The spirit of God
[1:19:24] does.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; So see, what spirit you worship
[1:19:28] determines the result. that you get.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But we have to enter into a true spirit
[1:19:34] of worship. This is what makes you a
[1:19:36] real believer.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Moments like this. I'm going to take a
[1:19:39] minute.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; This is what makes you a real believer.
[1:19:41] Is when you find yourself sitting in
[1:19:43] moments just like this and reflecting on
[1:19:45] your life and say, you know what, I've
[1:19:47] been doing that. I I find myself many
[1:19:49] times worshiping that spirit. Something
[1:19:52] that come over me or something that
[1:19:54] happened on I found myself entertaining
[1:19:56] and I give more reverence to that than I
[1:19:58] do the word of God. I give more. I bow
[1:20:01] down to that more more than I do the
[1:20:02] word of God. I fall into that more than
[1:20:04] I do the word the the word of God. But
[1:20:07] when we find oursel in that place, say,
[1:20:09] you know what? I'm not going to
[1:20:10] entertain that.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Let me enter into a spirit of worship. I
[1:20:14] don't want to see my family going down
[1:20:16] this path. I I don't want to to see
[1:20:17] where that ends. I I don't want to be
[1:20:19] 50, 60, 70 years old and that be my
[1:20:21] whole history. But let me be a let me be
[1:20:24] an old man with a testimony. You know
[1:20:25] what? My family went through a great
[1:20:27] trial. It looked like it was going to
[1:20:28] take us out. But I claimed the blood of
[1:20:30] Jesus over my family. I was a
[1:20:32] worshshiper of God and I follow and
[1:20:34] because I worshiped God, the spirit OF
[1:20:36] GOD, HE LED ME AND MY FAMILY RIGHT OUT
[1:20:38] OF THAT CONDITION TO WHERE WE BECAME A
[1:20:40] GREAT TESTIMONY AMONG THE people of God.
[1:20:44] And then your children can go on and
[1:20:46] have good lives and and lead great lives
[1:20:48] and have great households and be
[1:20:49] testimonies for God. They they they can
[1:20:51] be great Christians and leaders in a
[1:20:53] Christian community because of a
[1:20:55] decision that a mama and a daddy made.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You young people a decision that you
[1:21:00] make in your life, it reflects or it
[1:21:02] affects the rest of our life.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Said, but we got to enter into a spirit
[1:21:05] of worship. Isn't that what John done?
[1:21:07] He said, "I was in the spirit on the
[1:21:08] Lord's day." But said, "You can't do any
[1:21:10] good until first you get in the spirit.
[1:21:12] God can't use you. All your efforts are
[1:21:14] in vain until you first do it in the
[1:21:16] spirit. If I sing, I will sing in the
[1:21:19] spirit." Isn't that what Paul said? If I
[1:21:20] pray, I will pray in the spirit. He
[1:21:23] said, if there's anything that comes to
[1:21:25] me that's any good, it has to be
[1:21:27] revealed to me by the spirit and then
[1:21:29] confirmed by the word. In other word,
[1:21:31] here prophet of God said, before I will
[1:21:33] accept anything, it has to come by the
[1:21:35] spirit of God and then I have to confirm
[1:21:38] it by the word of God and then even
[1:21:41] after that it's made manifest by the
[1:21:44] result that it bears. Are you hearing
[1:21:46] me? So, if it's not bearing the right
[1:21:48] kind of result, then go back and check
[1:21:50] it and see, you know what, maybe that
[1:21:51] wasn't the spirit of God that led me
[1:21:53] into that because it's not bringing the
[1:21:55] right result. My We shouldn't BE
[1:21:56] BICKERING AND WE SHOULDN'T BE DOWN and
[1:21:58] my my children shouldn't be bound. WE
[1:22:00] SHOULDN'T BE LIVING IN BONDAGE. WE'RE
[1:22:01] SUPPOSED TO BE FREE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
[1:22:03] BE REJOICING. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN A
[1:22:04] REVIVAL. WHAT'S CAUSING ALL OF THIS?
[1:22:07] SEE, THE RESULT, it shows what spirit
[1:22:10] that you worship. It's so easy to
[1:22:12] worship spirits.
[1:22:15] He said, "But it's revealed to me by the
[1:22:16] spirit, confirmed by the word, and made
[1:22:18] manifest by the result that it bears."
[1:22:20] He says, "So, in other words, if I say
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ promised his word that if I
[1:22:23] would repent and be baptized in the name
[1:22:25] of Jesus Christ, I shall receive the
[1:22:27] gift of the Holy Ghost, the first thing
[1:22:29] for me to do is repent." He makes this
[1:22:31] so easy. It's revealed to me that it's
[1:22:33] true. Then be baptized in the name of
[1:22:36] Jesus Christ. Then the result is that I
[1:22:39] receive the Holy Ghost. See, it's a
[1:22:41] positive result because you was
[1:22:43] worshiping the right spirit.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Because you follow the word of God. All
[1:22:47] through the Bible, people are reminded
[1:22:49] to change who they worship and who they
[1:22:50] serve. How many knows that?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Did I run out of time?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; All through the Bible, our human nature,
[1:22:57] it's so easy to be led by other things.
[1:22:59] It's so easy to be led by false gods.
[1:23:01] You But but but you realize that,
[1:23:03] Brother Mark, that we're not we're not
[1:23:04] meant to do that because we're a
[1:23:06] different class of people. Hello. You're
[1:23:07] a chosen people, a chosen generation.
[1:23:09] You've been called out by God to be
[1:23:11] separate from the world. You you you you
[1:23:13] you're a chosen people. God has called
[1:23:15] us in this hour.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You know, I think about Israel.
[1:23:20] I'll use this as a closing point. It'll
[1:23:22] take a minute, but I think of Israel and
[1:23:26] their and how that they come out of
[1:23:28] Egypt. You realize that they were under
[1:23:30] such bondage when they come out of Egypt
[1:23:32] that they didn't have the liberty to
[1:23:34] freely worship God.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; They were bound by task masters. It
[1:23:37] wouldn't it wouldn't give them the
[1:23:38] liberty. It's just just it's any problem
[1:23:41] that you have today and maybe maybe it's
[1:23:43] over you. Maybe it's whooping you and
[1:23:44] beating you and you've been so bound up.
[1:23:46] It's a taskmaster that would keep you.
[1:23:47] But then there come in the middle of all
[1:23:49] of that bondage. You realize it was in
[1:23:51] the midst of bond bondage, brother Elum
[1:23:53] that the deliverer came. It it didn't
[1:23:55] come after they got it came right in the
[1:23:57] middle of it. I know sometimes we don't
[1:23:58] like that. And you know what? The
[1:23:59] Israelites didn't like it when Moses
[1:24:00] came either. They said, "You make it
[1:24:02] hard on us." They got unsettled. They
[1:24:04] started squirming in their seat. You you
[1:24:05] make it hard on us. you're making you
[1:24:07] make our our work harder. Would you go
[1:24:08] on just leave us alone? We're happy
[1:24:10] where we are. BUT HE COULDN'T DO THAT.
[1:24:11] He was a deliverer and he was anointed
[1:24:13] of God for that TIME TO COME RIGHT INTO
[1:24:15] THEIR HOME RIGHT INTO THEIR INTO their
[1:24:17] land, brother Mark, right into Israel
[1:24:19] and walk right in amongst them and say,
[1:24:20] "Well, here's a problem. You wasn't made
[1:24:22] to be like this. You was made to be
[1:24:23] God's free people. God didn't call you
[1:24:25] to be bound up by Egypt. He didn't send
[1:24:27] you here to live under bondage. He
[1:24:29] didn't he didn't he didn't make you to
[1:24:31] be living under a taskmaster. But you're
[1:24:32] God's free people. You're supposed to be
[1:24:34] free. You're supposed to be able to
[1:24:36] freely worship God. But the devil has
[1:24:38] came and put you in bondage. But I have
[1:24:40] a word from the Lord THAT NOW IS THE
[1:24:42] TIME OF DELIVERANCE. And Moses, HE
[1:24:44] DIDN'T CARE THAT THEY DIDN'T want him
[1:24:46] there BECAUSE HE WAS CALLED OF GOD TO
[1:24:48] WALK RIGHT INTO THEIR HOME AND SAY,
[1:24:50] "YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE BOUND. YOU'RE
[1:24:52] MEANT TO BE FREE. YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO
[1:24:53] WORSHIP THAT SPIRIT. YOU'RE MEANT TO
[1:24:55] WORSHIP THE SPIRIT OF GOD. YOU'RE GOD'S
[1:24:57] FREE MEN AND WOMEN CALLED BY GOD IN THIS
[1:24:59] HOUR TO BE CALLED OUT."
[1:25:02] And
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; when he went into that place, he brought
[1:25:04] them out into this land, going into the
[1:25:06] promised land. And no doubt as they went
[1:25:08] out there, brother Noah, that their mind
[1:25:10] would go back to where they came from
[1:25:12] because their whole entire lives was
[1:25:14] wrapped up in Egypt. [crying]
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; So their mind was would go back there.
[1:25:18] But notice what Joshua would tell them
[1:25:20] whenever they would they would they
[1:25:21] would hear about those around the camp.
[1:25:23] They were starting to they were starting
[1:25:25] to idolize other things. They were
[1:25:27] starting to pick up. Maybe maybe one of
[1:25:29] the maybe one of the kids remember one
[1:25:30] of those Egyptian gods and maybe the guy
[1:25:33] over there with a little with a piece of
[1:25:34] flint and man he got to get carving him
[1:25:36] out. One of them little gods and yeah I
[1:25:38] remember what that one looked like. He
[1:25:39] just carve him out out a little god. But
[1:25:41] the Bible said here they were starting
[1:25:43] to pick up these idols and in their mind
[1:25:45] they were they were they had they had
[1:25:47] moved out of Egypt. They went into the
[1:25:48] land of the Amorites who served even
[1:25:50] other gods. No doubt when they walked
[1:25:51] through the land of the Amorites there's
[1:25:53] these great big gods. I know you've
[1:25:54] never been to India, but over in India,
[1:25:56] there there's gods that are 300 feet,
[1:25:58] 200 feet tall, 150 feet tall. When you
[1:26:00] drive by them, you can't help but look
[1:26:02] at them. It's got a monkey head and a
[1:26:04] and a and an elephant body and and and
[1:26:06] all kinds of weird things that that's
[1:26:08] going on. But people bow down by the
[1:26:10] thousands and worshiping and you're
[1:26:11] driving by looking at this great big
[1:26:13] God. But but what happened when they
[1:26:15] came out of there? They they were
[1:26:16] picking up these gods and and so here
[1:26:19] Joshua came in the camp and he began to
[1:26:21] call upon them to fear the Lord. He
[1:26:24] said, "Fear the Lord and serve him in
[1:26:26] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[1:26:29] gods which your fathers served on the
[1:26:32] other side of the flood in Egypt and
[1:26:34] serve ye the Lord." So all of this time
[1:26:36] when they had came out that they that
[1:26:38] they had served these gods, they grow
[1:26:40] grown up serving these gods. But now
[1:26:42] here Joshua is speaking to the children
[1:26:45] of those that were raised in Egypt. They
[1:26:47] they were babies when they come out of
[1:26:48] there. Maybe some of them were even born
[1:26:50] out in the wilderness. They they had
[1:26:51] never experienced that. And when they
[1:26:53] came out there, they were holding gods
[1:26:55] and not because they worshiped the god
[1:26:57] or loved the god or had any history.
[1:26:59] They were only holding it because it was
[1:27:01] the god that their father used to have.
[1:27:04] And so now because their father had it,
[1:27:06] they were just going to go through it.
[1:27:07] Or because my dad was a Baptist, I'll be
[1:27:09] a Baptist. Because my dad went to
[1:27:10] church, I I'll go to church. But here
[1:27:12] Joshua came and he said, "But put away
[1:27:14] the God of your fathers BECAUSE YOUR
[1:27:16] FATHER'S GOD ain't going to do you no
[1:27:18] good."
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "On the other side of the flood
[1:27:21] in Egypt, and serve you the Lord. And if
[1:27:24] it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord,
[1:27:26] then choose you this day whom you will
[1:27:28] serve, whether it be the gods of your
[1:27:30] fathers, served that were on the other
[1:27:32] side of the flood, or the gods of the
[1:27:34] Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as
[1:27:36] for me and my house, we will serve the
[1:27:40] Lord.
[1:27:42] I thought, isn't it so easy to pick up
[1:27:44] the gods of our fathers?
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to pick up the traditions
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; of our fathers and the way they believe
[1:27:53] them. We we'll believe because this one
[1:27:55] said it was or this is a tradition. So,
[1:27:57] we'll pick it up because that one said
[1:27:59] it was. It's so easy to pick up the gods
[1:28:01] of our fathers. Maybe some even your
[1:28:04] father was an alcoholic and a son will
[1:28:06] become an alcoholic. Why? Because it's
[1:28:08] easy to pick up the gods of our fathers.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Father listen to rock and roll so the
[1:28:12] boy listens to rock and roll. Why?
[1:28:14] Because it's easy to pick up the gods of
[1:28:16] our fathers. You see why it's important
[1:28:18] not to be that way in front of your
[1:28:19] children. It's important to be a son of
[1:28:22] God and to and to treat every situation
[1:28:24] that way. Because your children your
[1:28:26] children when they answer to God, can I
[1:28:28] just friends? Let me tell you something
[1:28:29] Lord just put on my heart. But when your
[1:28:31] children answer to God, you won't be
[1:28:33] there with them. It ain't between you
[1:28:35] and them and God. You ain't going to be
[1:28:37] there to babysit or or say, "God, now
[1:28:39] you take care of my CHILD NOW." IT AIN'T
[1:28:41] IT AIN'T NONE OF YOUR business when God
[1:28:43] is dealing with your children. Has
[1:28:44] nothing to do with you. They're God's
[1:28:45] children. He only lent them to you to
[1:28:47] raise them. They're God's children.
[1:28:49] They're not your children anyway.
[1:28:51] They're God's children. Be careful how
[1:28:53] you treat God's children. Be careful how
[1:28:55] you raise God's children. BE CAREFUL
[1:28:57] WHAT YOU SAY TO GOD'S CHILDREN. BE
[1:28:59] CAREFUL HOW YOU TEACH GOD'S CHILDREN,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; especially when it's against the word of
[1:29:05] the Lord.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, daddy, well, that's not your
[1:29:07] daddy. You got a real father. A earthly
[1:29:10] father, that's just who you was born
[1:29:11] to." Well, good. And it's good to obey
[1:29:13] your father and mother while you're
[1:29:14] living in their household. And there
[1:29:16] come a time at an age of accountability,
[1:29:17] a child has to obey his heavenly father.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You obey the word of the Lord.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; You got to take that stand because when
[1:29:24] you answer to God, daddy ain't there,
[1:29:27] mom ain't there. You know, the word says
[1:29:28] this, but daddy said it was okay, but
[1:29:30] daddy ain't going to be there to answer
[1:29:31] for you. It's between you and God and
[1:29:33] the word.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Mama said it was okay, but the word says
[1:29:37] this. Mama ain't going to be there for
[1:29:38] you.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; That's between you and God and the word
[1:29:42] of God.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to pick up the gods of our
[1:29:47] fathers.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Listen what they said. They said, "God
[1:29:51] forbid that we should forsake the Lord
[1:29:53] to serve other gods. For the Lord our
[1:29:56] God, he has brought us out of Egypt and
[1:29:58] our fathers out of the land of Egypt,
[1:29:59] from the house of bondage. And we seen
[1:30:01] great signs and wonders in our sight,
[1:30:03] and preserved us in all the way wherein
[1:30:05] we went. And among all the people
[1:30:07] through we passed, and the Lord drove
[1:30:09] out them before us, the Amorites which
[1:30:11] dwell in the land. Therefore, we will
[1:30:13] also serve the Lord, for he is our God.
[1:30:16] Watch how Joshua answers them. He said,
[1:30:19] "You cannot serve the Lord.
[1:30:24] We will serve the Lord for he is our
[1:30:27] God. Joshua says you can't serve the
[1:30:29] Lord.
[1:30:30] You can't serve the Lord
[1:30:33] for he is a holy God.
[1:30:36] Here Joshua is looking at the condition
[1:30:38] of the people. We're serving the Lord.
[1:30:40] You can't serve the Lord because he is a
[1:30:43] holy God. He's a jealous God. and he
[1:30:46] will not forgive your transgressions nor
[1:30:48] your sins if you forsake the Lord and
[1:30:53] serve strange gods.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; So, see, there's so much pressure on
[1:30:56] you. Joshua wanted to he wanted to make
[1:30:58] them aware. If you forsake the Lord and
[1:31:02] serve strange gods, he will turn and do
[1:31:04] you hurt and consume you after all that
[1:31:07] he has done that was good. And the
[1:31:10] people said unto Joshua, "Nay, but we
[1:31:12] will serve the Lord." You see what he's
[1:31:14] doing? He's given us a warning, brother
[1:31:16] Ben, don't promise to serve God and then
[1:31:18] go serve other gods.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He said, because the blessing you would
[1:31:22] receive would become a curse instead.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; It's so easy
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; to pick up the gods of our fathers.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to worship the gods of our
[1:31:33] fathers or the the maybe maybe it was
[1:31:36] just something mean or some spirit or
[1:31:38] something evil. It's so easy to be that
[1:31:40] way. It's so easy to be like everybody
[1:31:42] else. It's easy to pick up the gods that
[1:31:44] other people carry. You walk around with
[1:31:46] your friends and they pack certain kind
[1:31:47] of gods. It's easy to pick up their gods
[1:31:49] and start worshiping their gods.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Say, you know, I want to worship their
[1:31:53] gods. You know, it makes me fit in
[1:31:54] better. It makes me It makes me feel
[1:31:56] better around them. I I'm not such an
[1:31:58] outcast. I'll just pick up the gods that
[1:32:00] they carry and I worship their god. It's
[1:32:02] so easy to pick up the gods of our
[1:32:04] fathers.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "How God blesses a man
[1:32:08] that would be true to the word of God."
[1:32:11] said, "He may not be very popular, but
[1:32:13] he will be blessed."
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And now people, they have to make their
[1:32:16] choice whether you want to act like the
[1:32:18] rest of those fellas or whether you want
[1:32:20] to be blessed of God.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You can just take your choice, but if
[1:32:24] you're going to live like the rest of
[1:32:25] them, then you're going to be blessed of
[1:32:27] them.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You'll receive their blessing. I'm so
[1:32:29] proud of you. You finally got out of
[1:32:31] that old that old bondage of church. I'm
[1:32:33] so proud of you. You're man, you finally
[1:32:35] had a mind of your own. You finally got
[1:32:37] tired of being brainwashed. I'm so proud
[1:32:38] of you. If you'll follow after the rest
[1:32:40] of them,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; then you'll be blessed of them.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "But but if you'll turn your
[1:32:46] desires to God, you'll be blessed of
[1:32:48] God."
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't know about you, but
[1:32:50] what a marvelous choice to be blessed of
[1:32:53] man or to be blessed of God.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; How many How many can make that choice?
[1:32:58] I You want the blessings that man has to
[1:33:00] give? Man's blessings are limited. A
[1:33:02] good pat on the back, they don't even
[1:33:03] have a dollar to give you. They couldn't
[1:33:05] even bless you with a little bit. Nobody
[1:33:06] has nothing to give. It's just to make
[1:33:08] you fit in their crown. But you the
[1:33:09] blessings of man are the blessings of
[1:33:11] God. A cow, a father that owns the
[1:33:14] cattle on a thousand hills. Joshua said,
[1:33:17] "Choose you this day whom you will
[1:33:20] serve."
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "What day?" It ain't any
[1:33:23] certain day. It's every day.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You realize every day that you have that
[1:33:27] same choice laying before you. Choose
[1:33:29] you today whom you'll serve.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Will it be the gods of your fathers?
[1:33:33] Will it be some strange god that you
[1:33:35] picked up? be some some spirit, some
[1:33:37] some thing or another that you'll
[1:33:39] follow. Said, "But choose you this day,
[1:33:42] every day, not just elders, not just
[1:33:46] leaders, but every one of us, young
[1:33:48] people the same. Choose you this day
[1:33:50] whom you will serve.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Don't wait until you're older to start
[1:33:54] serving God,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; scarred and broken and bitter and all
[1:33:58] these things that happen in your life. I
[1:33:59] think what you ought to do is just give
[1:34:01] God the best years of your life." Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I'm so proud of our young people because
[1:34:05] they have a desire to serve God. Don't
[1:34:07] think the devil ain't trying to do
[1:34:08] everything he can to take them out. But
[1:34:10] when the devil hits them, I don't hit
[1:34:12] them, too.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I've never been that kind of person.
[1:34:14] When the devil hits somebody, I'm going
[1:34:16] to come by and give them a good sucker
[1:34:17] punch, too, cuz I realize the devil just
[1:34:19] hit them. I'm not going to hit them
[1:34:20] because the devil hit him. If he's
[1:34:21] hitting them, I'm going to try to pick
[1:34:22] them up. I'm trying to lift them. I'm
[1:34:24] trying to encourage them because I think
[1:34:26] this is the day that you can serve God
[1:34:29] and make a difference in the world. Make
[1:34:32] a difference. Don't Don't give God the
[1:34:33] best years you have. Sometimes you don't
[1:34:36] feel like you're a part, but let me just
[1:34:37] tell you this this morning. Remember
[1:34:39] your creator. As a music players, come
[1:34:41] remember your creator. It was God that
[1:34:43] made you. God, you don't you don't feel
[1:34:46] like you fit in. You may not feel like a
[1:34:48] part, but you realize that everything
[1:34:50] that God ever made was made for a
[1:34:52] purpose. How many How many knows that?
[1:34:54] You you realize that the trees have a
[1:34:56] purpose. The the animals have a purpose.
[1:34:58] The grass has a purpose. The birds have
[1:35:00] a purpose. Even the insects in our
[1:35:02] world, they all serve a purpose. You
[1:35:04] know, I was reading an article the other
[1:35:06] day, science, it was saying that that
[1:35:08] the living every living organism, it
[1:35:09] serves a purpose. It's unique in its
[1:35:11] existence. Everything feeds something or
[1:35:14] or eats something.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; It's all here for the purpose of this
[1:35:18] this cycle of life. It provides for
[1:35:20] another species. And they all rely on
[1:35:23] each other for survival. There ain't
[1:35:24] nothing that God ever made that wasn't
[1:35:27] for a purpose.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; The smallest little insect,
[1:35:31] smallest little bird. And I was looking
[1:35:34] at all kinds of them. I was going to
[1:35:35] show pictures, but all the oddest things
[1:35:39] that God created, but each one had a
[1:35:41] purpose.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; You know, I was even reading article
[1:35:45] about insects. It says some of the
[1:35:46] strange purposes that insects had and
[1:35:49] what they were made for and how that
[1:35:50] they were shaped in a certain way and
[1:35:52] why they had that shape and how it
[1:35:54] caused them to interact with the with
[1:35:56] the rest of the the environment.
[1:35:59] And I was reading that and in the
[1:36:01] article they were praising the ingenuity
[1:36:04] of evolution. They're saying how
[1:36:06] wonderful is the ingenuity of evolution
[1:36:09] that all of this created itself. I
[1:36:11] thought y'all are so dumb to be so
[1:36:13] smart.
[1:36:15] The dumbest smart person I know wrote
[1:36:17] that praising the ingenuity of
[1:36:20] evolution. I thought here, you know how
[1:36:21] ignorant of a statement that is.
[1:36:23] Ingenuity is the quality of being
[1:36:25] clever. That's what it means. The
[1:36:27] quality of being clever or or inventive.
[1:36:30] And clever it means means quick.
[1:36:33] Somebody that's quick to understand or
[1:36:35] intelligent. So even by their own
[1:36:38] definition, the ingenuity of evolution,
[1:36:42] it would mean that it had to have an
[1:36:44] intelligence.
[1:36:46] So it can't just be happening. There has
[1:36:48] to be an intellig intelligence behind
[1:36:51] it. I thought here by their own
[1:36:52] definition, in order for things to exist
[1:36:54] in order for things to involve, there
[1:36:56] had to be an intelligence behind it. But
[1:36:58] friends, let me tell you that
[1:37:00] intelligence has a name.
[1:37:03] And Moses called him Elohim. He called
[1:37:05] him a great creator. He called him
[1:37:08] Jehovah God. He was called in the Bible
[1:37:10] Jehovah Gyra, a provider. He was call
[1:37:13] Jehovah Rafi, our healer. He was called
[1:37:16] Jehovah Rohi, our shepherd. Jehovah
[1:37:18] Sidkanu, our righteousness. Jehovah
[1:37:20] Shalom. He was called our peace.
[1:37:23] And he came to the earth in the form of
[1:37:26] a man. And they called him a man from
[1:37:30] Galilee. They called him a boy from
[1:37:32] Nazareth. They called him a carpenter's
[1:37:35] son. They called him the son of David.
[1:37:37] They called him, even his critics, they
[1:37:39] called him Beelzebub,
[1:37:42] but he has a name.
[1:37:45] What do you call him?
[1:37:48] Says, "Well, I I call him Jesus.
[1:37:51] He's my Lord. He's my Savior."
[1:37:55] That intelligence has a name, Brother
[1:37:58] Mark, and it's Jesus. He's my healer.
[1:38:01] He's my deliverer.
[1:38:03] He became my sacrifice.
[1:38:06] The Bible said he was before all things
[1:38:08] and by him all things consist.
[1:38:11] All things were created by him and for
[1:38:14] him. And that same intelligence
[1:38:17] that made all of those things made you
[1:38:21] and I.
[1:38:23] Can I say this this morning? The one
[1:38:25] that made the sun and made the earth. He
[1:38:29] made the stars. He made the moon. He
[1:38:31] made the He made the animal. He made the
[1:38:33] insect. He made the trees. He made the
[1:38:35] ocean. He made the fishes of the sea. He
[1:38:37] made the whale. He made every dolphin.
[1:38:39] Everything that's ever been existence in
[1:38:42] this world. It was made by God.
[1:38:45] This man Jesus that we read about, the
[1:38:47] very God that was in that flesh is the
[1:38:49] creator of the heaven and earth. Brother
[1:38:51] Mark, he made everything.
[1:38:54] But there was only one thing that he
[1:38:55] didn't make. He never made a mistake.
[1:38:59] And that same God that made all of that,
[1:39:01] that never made one error, is the one
[1:39:03] that made you and he made you and he
[1:39:05] made you and he made you and he made you
[1:39:07] and he made you. He made you and I.
[1:39:10] There ain't nothing that God has ever
[1:39:11] made that's been by accident. He made us
[1:39:13] and he made us for a purpose. No wonder
[1:39:15] there's a desire in our heart
[1:39:18] to not follow after a tradition. There's
[1:39:20] no it's it's not a desire in our heart
[1:39:23] to be a grandson of God, but it's a
[1:39:25] desire to be a son of God. It's a desire
[1:39:28] in our heart. Lord, I wonder if you'll
[1:39:29] stand to your feet this morning. How
[1:39:30] many say there's a desire in my heart to
[1:39:32] to call that's calling me back to the
[1:39:35] creator or the one that made me? God,
[1:39:37] let me look past everybody else and the
[1:39:39] influences of this world and the
[1:39:41] influence of my of my my my peers and my
[1:39:43] my my siblings and my father, my mother,
[1:39:46] my uncles, my aunts. May I look past all
[1:39:48] of the influence
[1:39:50] and just be a worshshiper of God? Can I
[1:39:53] just be a daughter of God or a son of
[1:39:55] God? And can I just serve you? Is there
[1:39:58] a worship in your heart? Let me ask you
[1:40:00] friends, what spirit
[1:40:03] are you worshiping?
[1:40:06] The result shows you what spirit is
[1:40:09] leading you and you're led by the spirit
[1:40:12] that you worship.
[1:40:14] Friends, if I got caught up in something
[1:40:16] that had me so wrapped up that it became
[1:40:18] every thought in my mind, every time I
[1:40:21] went to bed, that's all I thought about.
[1:40:22] It's what caused I and because it just
[1:40:26] can't get right. It causes so much
[1:40:28] confusion. All cut it out of your life.
[1:40:31] Why be unhappy?
[1:40:34] Why be miserable? Just cut it out of
[1:40:36] your life. Stop worshiping the spirit of
[1:40:39] it and go back to worshiping this Holy
[1:40:42] Spirit. This God that is a spirit. We
[1:40:46] worship in spirit
[1:40:48] and in truth. Go back to worshiping God.
[1:40:52] to be led by the spirit of God.
[1:40:55] God made you. He made you for a purpose.
[1:40:58] And let me tell you friends, that
[1:40:59] purpose was not to serve the world. It
[1:41:02] was made to serve God. It wasn't made to
[1:41:05] serve sin. It was made for us to serve
[1:41:06] him as sons and daughters of God,
[1:41:11] the God of your fathers.
[1:41:14] Amen. How many come
[1:41:17] just to worship the Lord? Joshua said,
[1:41:18] "If you forsake the Lord and serve
[1:41:21] strange gods, then he will turn [music]
[1:41:23] and do you hurt and consume you that he
[1:41:25] hath done after he had done you good." I
[1:41:29] thought, you know, many times in my
[1:41:31] life, I should have been destroyed.
[1:41:35] If that's the case, many times in my
[1:41:37] life, God should have came and brought
[1:41:39] me hurt instead of good. I should have
[1:41:43] been destroyed. But you know what? Since
[1:41:46] the days of Joshua,
[1:41:50] brother Mark, since the days of Joshua,
[1:41:52] there came another sacrifice.
[1:41:56] Brother said, you know how that when God
[1:41:59] came to Abraham and began to tell him
[1:42:01] that he's going to visit Sarah the time
[1:42:03] of life, you know that she laughed in
[1:42:04] her heart at God. He said, and God
[1:42:07] should have destroyed her. He said, "But
[1:42:10] because she left, he should have
[1:42:12] destroyed her if she hadn't been a part
[1:42:14] of Abraham." He would have. He said, "A
[1:42:17] lot of times our unbelief would destroy
[1:42:19] us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus
[1:42:22] Christ." He said, "But God, are you
[1:42:24] listening to me, friends? You may have
[1:42:25] been wrapped up. You may you may have
[1:42:27] picked up strange gods. You may you may
[1:42:29] be worshiping the wrong kind of God and
[1:42:30] worshiping the wrong kind of spirit and
[1:42:32] it's leading you down the wrong path."
[1:42:35] And many preachers would take that
[1:42:36] scripture of Joshua and saying, "God
[1:42:38] will do you hurt and God is going to
[1:42:39] destroy." But I'm not going to say that
[1:42:40] to you this morning. I'm going to tell
[1:42:42] you what a prophet said. He said, "A lot
[1:42:44] of times our unbelief would destroy us
[1:42:46] if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus
[1:42:47] Christ." He said, "But God can't destroy
[1:42:50] us now because the blood of Jesus CHRIST
[1:42:53] KEEPS GOD OFF OF US. FOR WE ARE A PART
[1:42:57] of Christ just as Sarah was a part of
[1:43:00] Abraham. FOR WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:43:02] CHRIST. AND WE THE people who's born of
[1:43:05] THE SPIRIT OF GOD, WE OUGHT TO WAKE UP
[1:43:07] AND GET OUT OF OUR SHOES AND WATCH FOR
[1:43:09] THE SUPERNATURAL SIGN OF THE coming of
[1:43:12] the Lord Jesus. When God ought to
[1:43:15] destroy you that it can't even destroy
[1:43:17] you because you're under the blood of
[1:43:20] the sacrifice. Friends, the spirit you
[1:43:23] worship is what saves you. The altar of
[1:43:26] sacrifice is what saves you from
[1:43:28] destruction in this world.
[1:43:33] What spirit are you worshiping? Let's
[1:43:36] just bow our heads this morning.
[1:43:41] It's so easy.
[1:43:44] It's so easy.
[1:43:47] You say, "Brother man, how do I know if
[1:43:48] I'm worshiping it?" It's leading you.
[1:43:52] It becomes your absolute.
[1:43:55] It's where you turn to get answers.
[1:43:58] You take it over
[1:44:00] the word of God. When you have to take
[1:44:02] any part of God's word and and dismiss
[1:44:05] it to do something else,
[1:44:08] it's leading you. That's how you know
[1:44:10] you're worshiping it. Say, "But I don't
[1:44:12] want to be caught worshiping any spirit
[1:44:15] like that." Wonder how many today, you
[1:44:18] say, "Brother man, I pray you'd remember
[1:44:20] me. God bless you, brother, for being
[1:44:22] honest, sister. God bless you. But I
[1:44:24] know who [music] I am." Let me tell you,
[1:44:27] friend, you are a son of God. God needs
[1:44:30] you. You're a daughter of God. He needs
[1:44:32] you in this great age that we live in.
[1:44:36] God needs real men and women to stand
[1:44:38] upon the truth of his word
[1:44:41] to worship the the spirit of truth and
[1:44:44] and to be a an absolute to the world
[1:44:47] that will never hear that word. God
[1:44:49] needs you.
[1:44:51] Could you just lift your hand? Just
[1:44:53] surrender. Say, "Lord, let me just be
[1:44:55] found worshiping." I wonder how many
[1:44:56] just say, "Brother man, I just want to
[1:44:58] restore that. Lord, let me just worship
[1:45:00] you. Lord, let there not be one thing in
[1:45:01] my life. If there's something I'm
[1:45:03] worshiping, Lord, I pray you'd take it
[1:45:04] out of my life. Let me not be worshiping
[1:45:06] any other spirit outside of the spirit
[1:45:09] of God. God, God sees our hands. Lord,
[1:45:12] that's a desire of my heart. Lord, let
[1:45:14] me let me lead the right way. Let's just
[1:45:18] pray. Gracious heavenly father.
[1:45:21] Lord, we just thank you for your spirit
[1:45:23] here this morning.
[1:45:26] God, what a desire that we have as
[1:45:28] believers, Lord. And God, not to be
[1:45:31] caught up in
[1:45:34] sacrificing on the altars that are made
[1:45:37] by men and worshiping things, Lord, that
[1:45:43] spirits that are unlike you.
[1:45:46] God, I understand. And God, that we live
[1:45:48] in this world. And God, I understand
[1:45:51] that we do things and we fellowship and
[1:45:54] we have friends and peers. And Lord,
[1:45:57] many folks that we interact with in
[1:46:00] town, Lord, not even believers. And
[1:46:03] Lord, but we don't worship the spirit.
[1:46:07] But Lord, let us be found
[1:46:10] as Joshua said, putting away the gods of
[1:46:14] our fathers
[1:46:16] that was bound them on the other side of
[1:46:19] the floods. Lord, you are such a
[1:46:24] an open view of our lives.
[1:46:28] Lord, to see how that a daddy as a young
[1:46:32] man, Lord, would be left out of
[1:46:34] something in such a way or a mama that
[1:46:36] was seems like that she was always left
[1:46:38] out and in her heart, in her spirit be
[1:46:42] so torn up by it, Lord, that that now
[1:46:44] they would come to a place that in their
[1:46:46] own children that they would force
[1:46:47] things upon them that they wouldn't feel
[1:46:49] the feeling that they felt. But God, you
[1:46:52] you can go all the way back and see
[1:46:54] where the problem really was.
[1:46:57] And Lord, I just ask you this morning,
[1:47:00] God, that you would open it to our
[1:47:01] heart, Lord. God, let us lead our
[1:47:04] children according to thy word. Lord,
[1:47:06] let us not let us not cause them to pick
[1:47:08] up any strange God. Let us as fathers
[1:47:10] and mothers, God, to lead them to the
[1:47:14] spirit of God,
[1:47:16] to lift it up over our lives and our
[1:47:18] homes and our families,
[1:47:20] Lord, that we would worship that spirit
[1:47:22] and that spirit alone that he may lead
[1:47:25] us,
[1:47:27] Lord. That we would have a result in our
[1:47:30] life that's pleasing unto God. Lord, if
[1:47:33] there be somebody that's bound, Lord, I
[1:47:35] pray this morning that this message
[1:47:39] that's gone forth, Lord, would deliver
[1:47:41] them. Lord, I just pray, Lord, I've seen
[1:47:43] many sitting here as spirits would leave
[1:47:45] their life while they were just hearing
[1:47:47] the preaching of the word, Lord, as it
[1:47:50] was going forth, Lord, spirits leaving
[1:47:51] the building, Lord. And I know that when
[1:47:53] we leave this place, that same enemy,
[1:47:55] Lord, would come back and start speaking
[1:47:57] to their mind, Lord. God, I pray you'd
[1:47:58] give them the strength to say, "I'm not
[1:48:00] worshiping that spirit any longer, but I
[1:48:02] just want to worship the spirit of
[1:48:03] truth. Let me be an example,
[1:48:08] a worshshiper, a true worshipper."
[1:48:12] Lord, we just ask you these things in
[1:48:13] the name of Jesus.
[1:48:18] Here I am to worship. [singing]
[1:48:22] Here I am to bow down.
[1:48:26] Here I am to say

[1:51:41] [singing] Oh, how humbly [music]
[1:51:44] you came

[1:52:23] Wonderful to me.
[1:52:26] Here I am to worship.
[1:52:28] [music and singing]
[1:52:30] Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Wesley, we don't worship God
[1:52:35] because [music] he would destroy us if
[1:52:37] we didn't.
[1:52:39] I worship God because of who I am.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And knowing that he can't destroy me
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; because who he made me.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; It causes me to love him. It caused me
[1:52:49] want to serve him. It causes me want to
[1:52:51] to live right by him. To be a living
[1:52:53] sacrifice.
[1:52:54] You know why Paul said a living
[1:52:56] sacrifice?
[1:52:58] Go home and read the word. Look up the
[1:53:00] word sacrifice. Take a good hour and
[1:53:03] study on what it means to sacrifice. It
[1:53:06] means to give up something.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; It's a and it ain't something to
[1:53:10] sacrifice. It isn't to give up something
[1:53:12] that you don't like.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Even the Catholics are better than that.
[1:53:18] When they teach you, you got to give up
[1:53:20] something. For for Lent, you got to give
[1:53:22] up something that you enjoy.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Don't give up something that you that
[1:53:27] you don't like. Can you imagine going
[1:53:29] around your house and picking out a
[1:53:31] bunch of stuff you don't like no more
[1:53:33] and giving to people for Christmas?
[1:53:34] Yeah, I just had it on my heart to give.
[1:53:35] No, you didn't like it. You didn't want
[1:53:37] it. So, instead of throwing the trash, I
[1:53:39] gave it to you. That's not a sacrifice.
[1:53:42] But when brother Andrew says, you know,
[1:53:43] I really like that tie. You just take
[1:53:45] off the That's my favorite tie. That's
[1:53:47] the only one my wife lets me wants me to
[1:53:49] wear. I'm just kidding. But you a
[1:53:53] sacrifice
[1:53:54] to give up things you enjoy.
[1:53:57] Make our bodies a living sacrifice. Some
[1:53:59] things that would be appealing. Some
[1:54:02] things that Satan would make it
[1:54:03] enjoyable. It would it would be a
[1:54:05] blessing from the world. But I would
[1:54:07] give it up.
[1:54:10] See, why make my body a living
[1:54:12] sacrifice?
[1:54:13] It's a sacrifice. [music] It is. You
[1:54:16] know, it's a sacrifice to serve God many
[1:54:18] times. Persecuted, made fun of,
[1:54:21] criticized. [music] But Jesus said, "If
[1:54:23] they persecute you for my name's sake,
[1:54:26] you're blessed." And friends, I don't
[1:54:28] know about you, but I'd rather be
[1:54:30] blessed of God than blessed of men.
[1:54:33] Amen. Do you believe [music] that this
[1:54:35] evening? Brother Ben, would you come?
[1:54:38] King of all days, [music and singing]
[1:54:42] so highly exalted.
[1:54:56] to this earth you [singing and music]
[1:54:58] created
[1:55:01] all for love's sake.
[1:55:06] So here I am to worship
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; My God,
[1:55:20] you're all together lovely,
[1:55:25] allto [music] together worthy,
[1:55:28] allto together wonder.
[1:55:32] Oh, and I'll never know.
[1:55:36] And I'll never
[1:55:39] know [singing]
[1:55:40] how. Oh, aren't you thankful for that
[1:55:43] this morning? To see [singing and music]
[1:55:46] my sin
[1:55:48] upon that cross. Yes. I'll never know
[1:55:55] how [singing] much it costs.
[1:55:58] Oh, to see my sins
[1:56:02] upon [singing]
[1:56:04] that cross. Sing it to him softly now.
[1:56:08] So here I am to work
[1:56:14] to bow down. Here I am to say,
