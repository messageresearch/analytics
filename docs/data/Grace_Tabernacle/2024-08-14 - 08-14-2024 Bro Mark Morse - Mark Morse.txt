laugh Captain said my life was fine without you I was covering up the secret tears I cried but then one day someone told me of your mercy when and the love you s on a Hill Called Calvary will they you

lost in sin and darkness and wouldn't know where to turn wouldn't know what to turn to but thank God that his blood came and got me one day it came and he found me in this dark and dying age that the Holy Ghost was sent to come and get me he was s he was he came to come and get you and I and he brought us to a place you couldn't even fathom in your sin conditions you didn't know nothing about it but then one day when he came and that's where the amazement comes from that's how I know that I'm amazed amen you love the Lord this evening amen won't you give him a hand clap of Praise amen musicians you can be seated if you want to uh I just just like to take a moment and I guess testify a little bit I don't mean to get all choked up but when you've worked as hard as you have for something and you don't see the fruition of it for a long time but then all of a sudden God turns it around it's like in the Midnight Hour it's like there was no way that I was getting a job and I worked so hard for it and I was wondering why why are we why are we still not getting a job you know when you get you mean many of you have looked for jobs and you get you go to interviews and things like that and they seem like everybody turns you down nobody wants you kind of takes the excitement and the joy out of finishing school because you you start getting worried about bills and you start getting worried about uh student loans and things like that but then that call came last minute and I just like to thank the Lord for what he's done for me it it's been a hard Road and I realized um my voice is a little weak y'all be praying for that and y'all keep me turned up but I've been talking for two days straight and I uh honestly I've been repeating myself for two days straight and you know I just you look at you get in a classroom full of kids and you realize that you realize what they come out of and you know all the other teachers and sit around and they talk about how bad the kids are and you know they can't handle them and they can't do this and they can't do that then you look at them and you realize that many of them don't have parents many of them come out of drugs and alcoholism and they don't have nobody to turn to I don't mean to be a baby but some I've really fought for and I hope and pray that each and every person in this church would would would pray with me about these kids because up in that area there there's a lot of them a lot of kids there that are that are going through a lot of things and some of those teachers they don't quite understand that they don't quite want to see that they just see the negative but I want to look at the positive every day and Jo put a thing on my Facebook post the other day about just be wise have wisdom with it and that's what I want to do I ain't trying again I'm not trying to I didn't think I'd be like this about it but I'll just be praying for them they they got a long road to go they got a long Hall and I'm hoping that I could be a witness to some of them somehow some way I know I can't go in there and and preach to them because you know that's against the law really but I'm hoping that that they can see something in somebody that that there's hope that there's something they can look to something they can hold on to somebody they can say Hey you know he was there for me is like I said they don't they don't have that you know a lot of our kids are going to H school and that's for the better because that public school system is a mess and it's it's a battle and I hope that you kids that are that are raised in the church and you see that and you you understand you know that there's kids still there that need your prayers there's kids still there that that need somebody amen amen I didn't mean to go on a on a big spill but it's just my heart this evening amen Let's uh open our Bibles to Genesis 3 excuse me Genesis 4 we're going to start at verse three amen and and if I say something silly like clap once if you hear me you know some of y'all might not understand that Lori I know understands that and I you know that's just one of those attention getter things that we do that uh I'm sure I don't need to do that here right amen I've been repeating myself again a lot if I start repeating myself somebody just brother Morgan say hey you're you're repeating yourself you you need to quit that in Genesis 4 chapter 3 it says in the process of time it came to pass they came brought to the of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flocks and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and th shall rule over him and came talked talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper verse 10 and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground amen if you want to just bow your head just for a moment Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your presence here here Lord we thank you for brother Joe in the song service how he just let the anointing come and just gave us a good place to come into and to feel your presence and to know that you're here with us father we want to say thank you for this Gathering of Believers that have come together to hear your word Lord God I pray that we would just move out of the way and just let the let the voice of God be heard tonight let the spirit of the Lord go under those that need you and those that are lisening in Lord that those that have needs tonight father I pray you would you would go to my home and you would help my daughter and my son Lord that you would heal their bodies and touch those that are sick in the church and bless those that are traveling father I pray that your mercy would be upon each and every one of us tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated tonight I got another scripture that I want to I want to uh uh read tonight it says in Hebrews 10 chapter uh Hebrews 10 and4 it said the Bible says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goat should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice an offering thou wouldest not but a body thou prepared me in burnt offering and sacrifices for sin thou H has had no pleasure then said lo I come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burn offerings are offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that me that he may establish the second by the which while we are all which we which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified amen I had another scripture but apparently I didn't write that one down amen when you speak of sacrifices you go back and you hear brother brandom talk about the very first sacrifice that was ever made that when Adam and Eve were in the garden he that he went and he heard what they did God went searching for Adam and went crying for Adam and thank God that he did and Adam came to him and he said Adam what have you done and he told him what he had done and then God knew by his law that he had to take Adam and Eve and kick them out of the garden he had to cast them out because his law had said that they couldn't do that his word had said that they weren't allowed to do that so God in his love and in his Mercy went back behind the bushes and he went and got a a a goat he went and got a pure lamb and he took that lamb and he slew that lamb amen he took that lamb and he slew it and he took the bloody sheep skin and he placed them over Adam and Eve and as they walked out of the garden you could hear the the bloody the the the bloody sheep SK slapping against their legs what a sorry sight that it was what a pitiful sight that it was what a bad thing that it was that they had sit there and they had disobeyed God to that point but the love of Adam constrained him the love of Adam said I want to take her and I want to go out into this place that love that Adam held but there was another man that died one day it was a second Adam and his name was Jesus and in that first offering that God begin to begin to show them that it took her blood no matter what happened no matter what sin no matter what they did it took a blood offering and the priesthood that that when they needed blood offering that it was so it was such a thing it was such a if I could find the right word it it was such a uh I can't think of the right word it was so uh man somebody helped me here I can't think of the right word I'm trying to look for here it was such a uh it was such a pressure on them there's a better word for that brother Joe needs to help me now here I can't think of a word but it was such a pressure it was such such a PO had to be so perfect that that sacrifice had to be so perfect and they would begin to sacrifice and they would look through these things and they had to do certain little things they followed every dot they followed every tit they dotted every eye matter of fact those priests could take Scrolls and roll them up and put a pin through them and tell you every letter that it touched it was such a Perfection and you watch it as they went down throughout the time that that it become a tradition to him and I you know what I got to thinking about just in the last few days that a lot of you young people you have come home from uh from from camp and those things that you've come home from and and a lot of times that the camp might become you know it's a joyous it's a happy time it's it's a joyful time and you get the spirit of the Lord on you and you feel the presence of God on you and you get a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but let me tell you something when you walk out of that camp you need to maintain that whole thing when you buy a brand new car if you don't maintain that car there's going to be problems down down the road and you'll find it that as you as you use this as an example as you buy a new car well when you get a car you you need to change the oil every 3,000 miles don't correct me on this brother but you you have to change the oil every so often if you don't what happens what begins to happen I'm starting to ask you questions I told you that teacher thing was going to come out in me I'm waiting on a response but I'll try not to do that that that when you begin to do that your car starts running sluggish and it starts running sluggish and the oil starts to go bad then coal packs start to go out coal packs start to go out their coils are starting to blow you know Pistons are starting to pop and things are starting to happen because you haven't maintained that vehicle in the correct way you haven't done what it should be done and I say that that that when you leave a church camp that when you leave there that that or when you leave church at all you have got to maintain your life as a Christian if you don't maintain if you don't do some maintenance if you don't do some practicing there's going to be problems there's going to be issues that you're not going to be able to see there's going to be things that that's down in that motor that you can't find and you're going to be going what in the world is going on with this thing there's going to be times when you're driving down a road and there's no power in your vehicle and as a Christian sometimes if you don't make the right maintenance you get to trugging along and you start and you push the gas pill and nothing happens you got no power anymore you can't go down the road and and you watch that and I think that's a lot of times why people kind of start you see new Christians and how they struggle and how they fight some some of them don't do that some of them are ready to go some of them's like a Lamborghini up in here they take and they push the gas pill and they're going somewhere but some of some of us is like an old truck you know it just takes us a minute to get moving but if you start maintaining you start cleaning your motor up a little bit you start doing those things take it to the car wash and get it washed a little bit start putting your oil where your oil needs to go start greasing where it needs to be greased and I tell you what you might not get down Road as fast as the Lamborghini will but you're headed down the road it's got four wheels and you're driving somewhere and I thank God that I can drive somewhere it might take me a minute it might take me a minute to get started it might take me a few days to get it going right but I promise you I'm going to get it right because God got a maintenance schedule and it's down on my knees and when I begin to pray God begins to do things the spirit of the Lord drops down into my heart it drops down into my life without that thing that that sluggish that thing that that's pulling at me that that I can't get through that I can't just battle through and God comes along with a little bit of grease and he starts squirting a little grease over here a little bit of Grease over there and oh I tell you why he start squirting a little grease right here I can't quite raise my hand up but when he begins to squirt that little grease up in that joint right there you start oh it's a little better oh it might take a minute it might take a minute to get that grease to get to flowing and get it to moving around the joint but as you begin to move it just a minute you're up here and you're going oh Hallelujah I'm back up here again I oh I was down here a little bit but now I'm back up here it takes a little bit of greas to get going sometimes and that's your scripture you take your scripture and you start reading the Bible and you start applying the Bible you start applying those things in your life and many times that we fall to do that and we get down the road and we can't go anymore we can't go anymore and you want to quit you want to give up you want to stop and then you start looking at everybody else and what they're doing well why are they doing it this way well they've been greased up a little bit why they keep shouting Hallelujah well they've been greased up a little bit they got a little bit of fire that fire can get down in their motor amen do you love the Lord tonight I begin to talk about application amen just maintain your sacrifice don't let it become a tradition to you don't let it do what they did you've got to apply something and you find it that in the scriptures during the Passover when when God went through and he told Moses he said you tell them to to apply the blood you tell them to apply the blood and their first born won't die and they took that blood and they took a simple little weed called a hasip weed and they went down over Oh Glory they went down over their door and they applied the blood over their door they applied it on the sides of their door they applied it every single place where it needed to be applied they didn't miss one thing because that's what God Said do God said this is where you apply this is how you do it and it's it's time to apply the blood this evening it's time to apply it over your doorpost it's time to apply it in your household it's time to apply it on your kids it's time to apply it on your wife it's time to apply it on your husband it's time to apply it everywhere you can apply I don't care if you get it and you take it down the street and you start applying it over the person walking down the street it's time to apply the blood amen believe for it heyen man believe for safety then apply see believe for here's what you want to believe for see you want your own safety you believe for your safety and apply the token for the whole family and you say how can I do that claim it amen I love what he says here it worked on you amen then you and the word becomes one see see it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones like Rahab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and got them all in you apply say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her I apply my token the Holy Spirit oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going to her now with your anointing come on me he'll do it amen amen believe it believe what believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house then what do you do when you apply to your house brother R says move all the trash out get all the short skirts and the shorts and the cards and the cigarettes and television and whatever more and kick them out the door when you go apply the token won't stand still for it yes sir take it all out all the dances and parties and rock and roll and old vulgar newspapers and the stuff that's of the world kick it out the door say we're cleaning out this place around here I say it's time to go home and go a Hing the word of the Lord over your home you might have to kick something out you might have to go down in the basement you might have to go up in the dark places you might have to go in every corner but if you want the presence of God in your life and in your home that's what it takes it don't take anything else but applying the blood it takes applying the token and it's going to take it today it's not tomorrow we don't need to wait on tomorrow cuz you need the presence of God just to move forward it's time to apply that blood to our homes I want to apply it to my home you want to apply to your home and you watch the presence of God come and take things out of your life come and take things away from you that you battle with that you roared with that the old devil has kicked you around with when you apply the token the enemy has to run when you apply the token the blood of Jesus comes into your house and he starts picking you up and he starts lifting you up and he starts delivering you of cigarettes he starts delivering you of all kinds of Filth and nonsense that you're wrapped up in because why because you have applied the blood of Jesus Christ onto your life that's what it takes it takes an applied an application it takes that application if you don't do that application then you're not going anywhere you're going to fight you're going to battle you're going to war you think you might well I can do it well I can get through if you don't apply the blood you're not going anywhere your truck's not going down the road it's going to be sluggish it's going to be a battle it's going to be a fight amen amen then apply the token with in prayer with believing apply such love and so forth that you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all applied in confidence believe it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them their mind I'm getting them for you Lord don't worry about it don't fiddle with it don't play with it don't fight with it just claim it if you need a promise of God you claim that promise it's your voice that speaks there's been a blood that spoke for you and that blood says you can speak for it you can apply you can ask for it anything you ask in my name it shall be given unto you and I'm not talking about some of these guys that want to preach prosperity and they want to give you a bigger house and a bigger home and they want to take everybody's ties and they want to do that I'm talking about a soul that is worth 10,000 worlds I'm talking about something that's worth more than all the nonsense that the world has to offer I'm talking about your sons I'm talking about your daughters I'm talking about your Mas I'm talking about your daddies that's who I'm talking about it may take a battle it may take a war it might even take a grave to get them there but you have applied the blood over their lives and don't you dare back up from that don't you let any Spirit any devil any enemy every every idea any reasoning tell you that you have not claimed them

voice there was a whole lot of louers than the blood of Abel it be to cry out and it poured out upon the Earth and that blood begin to cry out it cried out he cried out so much that did the generation 2024 heard the blood of Jesus Christ generation of 1983 heard the blood of Jesus Christ the generation of 1985 heard the blood of Jesus Christ the generations of 1966 1963 2008 2011 I don't care it

you and it Flo and it Cried Out unto you it said come home it is the blood of Jesus and it's crying out to you it's telling you it's time I said it's time to come home and you heard that blood and your your voice amen your ears was trained to hear the blood of Jesus I said you are a predestinated seed and you know that was the voice and you've heard it and you might have spurned it you might have walked away from you might have oh you might have been beat up you might have been down but it's still calling you can still hear every time you wake up in the morning that voice is ringing in your ear every time you drop down every time you fail the blood of Jesus is Calling out hey I thank God I can't even breathe right now I thank God that the voice of my past never got to his ears the voice of my sin can you turn this up the voice of my sin never reach the savior's ears the my voice all the sin things that not done all the darkness that I'd went through all the battles that i' faced all the the drugs that I'd taken all the alcohol that I drink all the all those things that I had done had a voice they had a voice but the voice The Voice never heard it it never reached God's ears it never got there it never made it there when the enemy tells you oh you you've got sin in her life you got things in your life you you got darkness in your life just remember that voice the voice the voice of the blood doesn't hear it all he can see all God can see when he looks down all he can see is that blood covering that's over the Earth the blood of your sins and the blood that's already heard God looks down to it and he sees you laying there and all he sees is pure white he sees Lily white he sees righteousness he sees hope he sees Faith he sees Joy he sees healing he sees all these things and he cries out and he said you know what I'm going to give them a little bit of Joy tonight I'm going to give them a little bit of peace tonight amen that's what I'm going to give him tonight the voice of the blood amen Paul tells us talking about speaking of blood Paul tells us that the blood speaks you believe the blood blood speaks in Genesis 4:1 God told Cain wears your brother he said his blood the blood of his voice calls out against you now we also find in Hebrews the 12th chapter 24th verse of the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking and the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life in his life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen amen amen sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed upon the CR that called out after his dead brother or called out after his brother that had killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for her it speaks for her certainly the blood speaks oh my I got to thinking about the blood speaking and I remembered that there was a thief that was laying on the cross right next to him this man that had did that had done wrong his entire life had no clue about who Jesus was he's laying there and Jesus speaks to him and he cries out to Jesus one teeth mocks him and the other one says what are you talking about we've been thieves our whole life we've done these things our whole life but that man has never done a thing wrong and Jesus tells him this day you'll be with me in Paradise that was the speaking of the blood of Jesus Amen you know I think about we was I got way ahead of myself but you talk about the blood the blood was so powerful the blood of Jesus Christ was so powerful that it didn't just flow for you and I that blood went backwards it went back into time it picked up Abraham it picked up Isaac they picked up Jacob all those men that that that had made those sacrifices and all those sacrifices of blood and Bulls and ghosts all they did was push their sins forward and push their sins forward and push their sins forward and they're standing there hoping that somebody would come and get them hoping that somebody will come save them and then there come a knock upon the door and they open the door and they said there he is one of them said he's the will in the middle of the whe there's that Jesus there's my savior there's my healer and I hope and pray that you and I that have grown up in darkness that have grown up in lay osia that when you hear the knock of Jesus on your door and you hear that Voice start calling you that it does something to you I say it's high time to take another step it's high time to go up in the glory where you belong it's high time to take a Rapture stop leting this world control you stop letting Spirits control you stop letting everything come against you and let the blood of Jesus Christ speak for you tonight amen let the blood speak I know Devil's going to come around well you did this okay won't you just talk to the blood you remember that talk to the hand Susan Dr like to drove me nuts with that man you might remember that era talk to the hand don't you laugh Lillian you did too you know you did that talk to the hand amen when that old devil that old Spirit comes knocking on your door that old spirit that you've been battling that God you know God delivered you of that old sickness that's been fighting with you that old filth that's been coming in in the middle of the night that old thing that's been coming get you on your phones in the Midnight Hour that old thing that old movie watching and old ugly thing and oh ugly nasty spirits and if you could even see them you'd run from them anyway if you had a if you had a way of seeing what those things were you would sometimes I ain't never seen one but I know some people in here have seen some of those things that old nasty thing comes in the middle of the night it knocks on your door and it tells you hey after you've been delivered hey I'm I'm home I've come back would you accept me back and I like to think that there's some people in here that's going to go talk to the blood I've watched kids in the last couple days that don't argue with them cuz that's what they're looking for they're looking for you to come back at them they're looking for that they want that attention the devil wants that attention from you he wants you to argue with him he wants you to reason with him because when you do that he starts chipping away at you well you know what I'll make another appointment no you're not making another appointment talk to the blood talk to the blood cuz the ears ain't listening amen I ain't listening to you devil I'm not giving you my ear anymore because you know that's what happens when a voice talks to you and you start giving it an ear you start giving it that little bit of reasoning you start leaning into it just a little bit Satan don't play that game God don't play that game you know what Satan talk to the blood just speak to the blood speak to the blood speak to the blood there's a banner over me there's a banner there's a love Banner there's a blood Banner that is waving over this household and if you would just walk outside and you can see where I pledge my allegiance I pledged it to the blood of the Lamb that's where my allegiance lies and when the Devil comes back you raise that Banner you raise that flag and say here it is he's what I'm under I'm not under you anymore I'm not under your flag I'm not under your filth I'm not your nonsense that I have surrendered over the blood of the Lamb the blood of the Lamb is coming to my household and if you've got a problem you can take it up with the office of Heaven you can take it up with those Affairs of Heaven matter of fact you won't you just go straight to the throne room and talk to Jesus about it just go to him you can have a conversation with him because I'm not leaning near to you amen how do you think old Barabas felt that morning when you heard the Roman coming and the big from the galleries has the big Iron shoes topping along the chains rattling the spear dragging on the street to know what he was going to be killed when he opened up the door and Barabas trembling and crying ready to run out saying oh this is the end of me said Barabas you're pardon free Barabas said why he said ain't I going to die sure said no you don't have to die well what did I have to do for it nothing well how did this come then the Centurion would have raised him around and said see heyen we get a lot of that in the scriptures when God just says look there was a time that when the fiery serpents were released under the children of Israel that God raised up a brass Serpent and he said just look at that brass Serpent and you'll be healed there was a time that when Moses was standing there when the battle was arrive when the battle was when they were getting weak and they they couldn't fight the battle anymore the that the the the sons went up to to Moses and he said as long as your hands are in the air that's when we know when the battle is being W and Moses got a little war out he got a little tired and His Hands would begin to drop and the battle would get a little harder and they looked at Moses and two of them went to him and said you know what we know that his hands when they're up that we're winning the battle we know when it's there they we winning the fight we know when it's there so they went to Moses and and they pulled up a rock and they put it underneath him and they set Moses down upon the rock and they set him down and they held his hands up they held them up so they could look they were in the middle of the storm they were in the middle of the battle there was Bloodshed going on around them there was dirt and I don't know if you've ever been in a battle but there's a lot of stuff going on in there there's a lot of nonsense going on there's there you can't hear nothing you can't see nothing you don't even know who you fighting half the time but they could look up and they would see Moses standing there with his hands raised up and they knew the victory was not and it wasn't just a little bit that the victory was won but I say unto you that all you had to do is look to the cross of Calvary his hands didn't have to be held up by somebody because they took the nails and they nailed him to that cross and he stood there and His Hands never dropped and he won the battle he never dropped till he won the war it never dropped until he filled it all 300 some OD prophecies were fulfilled by that moment and I can say unto you if Jesus Christ would not have got up out of that tomb we wouldn't be standing here but Hallelujah he come out of the Tomb I say there's prophets that are laying in tombs in many different places there's gods that they call gods that are laying in tubs there's popes that are laying in tubes that they've got they've got horses waiting on them to come up and my savior already rose up and the blood of Jesus Christ has come out he come out of the Tom and I thank God that I can look and see I don't I can look and see a lot of people they stop at the cross I don't don't don't please do not take this wrong but that's where they stop I got a lot of Baptist friends that's where they stop well I claim the blood I claim the blood I'm a Christian and go out and keep drinking go out and keep drugging well I had one experience with him but there's something came after the cross he said I'll send you somebody else he said I'll send you the Holy Ghost and that's a whole new ball game right there you can be saved but when the Holy Ghost comes in you there begins to become a power and an authority in your life that no devil can handle no Spirit can handle I talk about when the blood is shed over your life and the Holy Ghost comes down into you it brings you to a different level it brings you to a different place they try that's why they can't do it with pamphlets that's why they can't do it with cards and and things they want to handle you just say the sinner's prayer and you'll be okay I don't believe that I don't believe that one bit take another step and you want to look at them be like well okay why is your denomination dying off they said to the Catholic Church one time the Catholic Church you know in the 1600s they started getting extremely powerful right before that 365 was the the one of the Heights and we all know about that so they started gaining money they started selling Indulgence and one of them I don't remember who it was or where it was but he started talking he said you know what no longer does a Catholic Church have to say Silver and Gold Have I None then one of them old preachers looked over and he went yeah and neither can they say take up thy bed and walk either they can't say that won't you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen they can't say that anymore but I can say that because I've seen it done I've seen the dead raised underneath the Holy Ghost I've seen blinded eyes open I've seen cancers healed I've seen Spirits kicked off of people I've seen people so addicted to drugs that their face was sunken in their teeth were gone but the next time you saw them there was a joy upon their face because they were filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they came running from sin sick conditions they came running to Jesus they came finding Jesus they came looking for Jesus and no they didn't even have to come look for him cuz he went looking for them amen he said come follow me it's what he said amen I thank God that he brought me out of my condition amen I was dark but the day that I was dark I didn't want to believe anymore I didn't want to believe the message I don't believe none of it I didn't care I was looking for another party Hallelujah he saved me the voice came looking for me the voice found me the voice healed me amen BR see look and see the Bible says in Luke 21 and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory what have we seen in this day oh amen we seen the son of man coming we seen him coming in a cloud and he looked out over his people you look at the cloud and you see that and you brother R talks about it being judgment but there's another side to that he's looking out and he's telling you I'm coming I'm coming home I'm coming to get you and there was a word that was ripped open and the spirit of the Lord started moving in his people he started moving in the message of the hour and it was such a power and authority that that they couldn't oh Hallelujah they couldn't handle it I I I don't mean I don't know what else to say I don't know how to say if they couldn't handle it they had no idea what was going on they they were saying God sent a prophet and that's as far as they went they were saying that he's still on the cross and that's as far as they went but here's another place to that there's a place that you can go into at then brother BR calls sometimes he calls them untapped resources if you were Lord I tell you what there's a power in the message that we need come in contact with and I feel the presence of the Lord in here that there's a power in the message of the hour that we haven't even touched yet that we haven't seen yet if you'll just reach and get a hold of that and you'll start hearing the voice of God call upon you you'll start seeing those things begin to happen you'll start seeing Lambs begin to be restored you'll see dead people raised you'll see people rising up and walking you'll see these things in the glory of God and you can say hallelujah I'm a part of the message of the hour and there ain't no devil can tell me that it's anything else I know if you ain't seen or heard yet I don't care nothing about that stinking devil that's trying to take away from you I don't care nothing about him I say take the gloves off go to your homes and take the boxing gloves off and go to fighting we've got a word we got a sword we got a sword we can go to fighting with you might not even know how to swing it but I remember preaching that one time you walk in your house just close your eyes and start swinging I'm sick of the devil I'm sick of him in my home I'm sick of him on my teenagers I'm sick of him on my family I'm tired of the the the the disunity tired of all that I'm tired of fussing and fighting with people over the message of the hour I'm tired of fussing and fighting with people over what church you go to and what church you don't go to I'm tired of people saying all kinds of junk and nonsense and I don't care nothing about I'm tired of people running there amen people want to talk about and I'm going to say this slightly Andel knows I get carried away sometimes I've heard people fussing a little bit about the camps and things and then want to look at them be like what have you done lately what have you done have you got a place where a thousand young people can go to and serve the Lord what have you done that's what I'm tired of I'm tired of my own critical self looking at people and fussing about people what they're doing because I get brother I actually heard this this week brother Ram says I'm too critical the Lord started dealing with him on it he was too critical I don't want to be critical I want to claim the blood of Jesus if you're doing something for the Lord go do something for the Lord it don't matter what you're doing that's between you and God that's between you and the Lord that's who that is and I also want to ask people sometimes well where's your Vindication they want to you get people getting on podcast and all this stuff okay well where's your Vindication where's the pillar of fire in your life where's the spirit of God in your life where's it at I want you to show me you go back to the Mormons or the the Jesus the latterday Saints you listen to their testimonies you listen to how they talk and what they say they start talking about Joseph Smith and what he did I don't know if it was Joseph Smith was Joseph Smith right okay they started talking about that an angel came to him gave him a book and the angel took it back but an angel came the word of the Lord came Christ came it wasn't an angel it was Christ himself turned and he opened the book and oh Hallelujah and he Loos the seals and it wasn't just judgment being spoke it was something that the Bride of Jesus Christ could see your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life you could see your name written down in there when you didn't see it before you didn't know it before you had no idea before now you can open the book and you can see your name written there beside the names of Paul beside the names of Peter beside the names of John beside the names of the Apostles beside the names of the Saints you can look in there and you can see it and there's going to be a time when you walk over in the glory that they're going to meet you right there and they're going to ask you how in the world did you get through that dying tribulation time how did oh not the tribulations we ain't going through that but how in the world did you get through the darkest hour of all time and you're going to tell them the blood the voice of the blood called out to me one day and I took that banner and I put it over my home and the spirit of the Lord came to my life and he started moving things out of the way he oh it may not it may have took a few days sometimes it don't take a second but sometimes it might take a few days a little bit of tearing a little bit of praying and God will move those things out of your life I'm a witness of it I know that that'll happen amen are you happy for the blood amen you're happy for the voice amen we got to listen to The Voice I was I don't was listening to something the other day and come across this uh I don't even know what else this do but it was a a man he was a a pastor a lawyer he was coming back from Alaska and one of the people that were there with him saidwell I'm a pilot won't you just go with me he said well we've already got our tickets no I'll just do it for free and the pilot when they left he they got in there with him the pilot took off and he told him he said he said he goes you know what sometimes when I'm up in my plane it's a little you know four seat or SES something like that when I get up in my plane that that I'll pass out he's like whoa so he got up in the clouds they got into a he gets in like a cloud bank so they got up in the cloud sure enough their pilot passes out is it okay if I just read that that little bit to you and I'm going to start in the middle of the story he said eventually they found themselves flying through dense clouds of no visibility the pilot became disoriented and passed out his eyes actually rolled back into his head unconscious his passenger Pastor shook him violently trying to wake him up the lawyer sitting in the back seat said we're all going to die aren't we the pastor replied yes that's a real possibility he then handed the microphone back to the back to the lawyer and he told him to call for help as he tried to he was trying to revive the pilot cuz him and the pilot were sitting in in the front seat together and the lawyer is in the back the lawyer started yelling help is there anyone out there and finally a frer replied is this an emergency don't you know how to get a hold of us there's like radio etiquette what are you hollering at me for so that they explained that that the pilot was unconscious so the freighter started giving them instructions and got them in contact with Anchorage with the towers so mind you they're in the storm they're in the dark they can't see nothing they have no clue what's going on air traffic controller was calm and gave them instruction how to turn the plane around he said you're headed straight towards a mountain but he said he started repeating himself he said you got to listen to my voice he said don't don't panic listen to my voice don't panic don't get worried you're headed for a mountain but if you'll listen to my voice I'll get you through it amen what a time that we live in that we can listen to The Voice Don't Panic you're in the middle of the storm you're in the battle you're in the war Don't Panic listen to The Voice in your Panic there will be voices in your head telling you to do this or that don't listen to them listen only to my voice you can't see me but I can see you oh Hallelujah we might not can see him but he can see us he can see down through the storm he can see down through the battle he can look down and he can see you and leay osia and he says you're not even in L Osa you've come up a little higher you've come into a different light you've come up here and all you've done is you've listened to my voice amen sometimes it's that simple you're headed to a mountain listen listen to my voice if you don't listen to my voice you will die amen I love this part just that Pastor listened and did everything he was instructed to do by this time other Pilots were listening to the conversation occasionally giving him encouragement ain't that the happy thing about a church when you're lost in the storm The Voice you hear the voice then you start hearing other voices you start hearing sister Nisha and brother Joe and Brother David start telling you it's okay I've gotten through there you can get through it it's okay I know I I know what you're going through I've been there I've been in that condition but don't don't you just listen to that voice you do what it says and it'll tell you all right because there's Witnesses all over the building that have been through that same storm they've been through that battle they've been through that war they've been through that fight and you young people need to take heed to that they've been there done that they got the T-shirt hey man they've been through the darkest hour and know I told my class today I asked them can you learn from your own mistakes I ain't trying to sound bad but they some of them said yeah well I said I'll tell you what I can learn from somebody else's mistakes it don't bother me to learn from somebody else I'm sorry I don't want to go through drug habits and I'm going to listen to Somebody That that might have been there a little bit and had to bite with that I'll be like you know what I think I'm going to lend an ear to them instead of the old do the dop head trying to tell you it's okay I'm going to listen to to to the to the guy that that that went through the alcoholism I'm going to listen he said well you don't need to go there you're just going to get a trap I think I'm going to listen a little bit when the pastor start telling me it's not okay to go down that road when the preacher start telling you that's not okay I'm going to lend an ear and I'm going to think you know what maybe I need to do that cuz I'd cause it'd be a whole lot less of an issue it'd be a whole lot less of a problem cuz when the Devil comes knocking you can take him back to that you've got an anchor a point that you can take him back to you can let him see amen my iPad keeps popping up on me the pastor listen as they flew near to Anchorage the air
