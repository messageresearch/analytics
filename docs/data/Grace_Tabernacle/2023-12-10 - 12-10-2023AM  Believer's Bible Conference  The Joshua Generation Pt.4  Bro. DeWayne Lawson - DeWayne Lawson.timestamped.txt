[55:54] and been and we coming in he was just
[55:57] talking about it's it's a it's a it's a
[55:59] it's a little bit of a different feeling
[56:01] when you're pastoring and you're not
[56:02] home on Sunday morning you know there's
[56:04] a lot going on and L of need and so we
[56:07] want to thank you all for taking a few

[56:16] done and this morning um we just want to
[56:19] take a few minutes of the word and we've
[56:22] had three pretty full meetings and and
[56:25] so I took a little extra time last night
[56:28] but uh there's some things this morning
[56:30] maybe we'd like to just discuss here for
[56:32] Joshua 13 verse one um I I I have I have
[56:39] to say this I have I probably have three
[56:41] or four more different uh uh things to
[56:44] really get into but I just felt this
[56:46] morning maybe that we would just compile
[56:48] some of them we just speak to you more
[56:50] than maybe to teach you but Joshua
[56:52] chapter 13 and I want to read this with
[56:55] the first verse
[56:57] here uh now Joshua was old and stricken
[57:01] in
[57:02] years and the Lord said
[57:05] un Thou Art old and stricken in years
[57:09] and there remaineth yet very much land
[57:13] to be possessed let's bow our hearts
[57:16] father we thank you for your word this
[57:18] morning we thank you for the grace that
[57:21] you've given us Lord to be together here
[57:23] in this season Lord your blessing upon
[57:26] the meetings and your presence here has
[57:29] been tremendous and we thank you for it
[57:32] we thank you Lord that you would give us
[57:34] Grace to be together and Lord some of
[57:35] our friends and dear dear loved ones
[57:38] Lord some have been Lord since we were
[57:41] at the altar many years ago and have
[57:44] been through the years great supporters
[57:47] of our ministry Lord and what you have
[57:49] called us to do and I pray you bless
[57:52] them Lord I pray you bless the friends
[57:54] that you have gathered around us Lord
[57:57] and all of those even at home tonight or
[57:59] this morning that Lord wasn't able to be
[58:01] here may you touch them Lord even in
[58:04] their homes and and we ask you now give
[58:07] Grace this morning upon the word we ask
[58:09] it in Jesus name
[58:11] amen amen God bless you as you be seated
[58:15] this morning uh I do want to just think
[58:18] uh upon this this morning a little bit
[58:21] here there is much land to be possessed
[58:25] there is much land to be possessed I
[58:27] think it's pretty amazing uh that Joshua
[58:31] would be told to the Lord there's a lot
[58:33] of land left to possess and I I think as
[58:36] a Christian people uh that we must uh
[58:39] realize and even here in the message of
[58:42] the hour I think we must realize that
[58:44] there's a lot of land yet to possess uh
[58:48] we have to be careful to not become
[58:51] complacent and to say that where we have
[58:53] come and what we have that this is all
[58:56] of it and this is as far as it can go or
[58:58] this as much as can happen but I do
[59:00] believe that there is a lot I believe
[59:02] there's a lot left for the church I
[59:04] believe there is higher Heights I
[59:06] believe that there is more powerful
[59:08] moments and I believe the spirit of God
[59:10] has great things for us as Christians in
[59:13] the New Testament our possession is a
[59:15] spiritual land and the thing about the
[59:17] land is amen of course that there is
[59:20] borders to the land that God gave us he
[59:22] gave us the word but the depths of that
[59:24] word word have yet to be discovered the
[59:26] levels of this message have yet not even
[59:29] opened in the places that God can take
[59:31] us and and if you want if you start
[59:34] studying you get this cuz you'll start
[59:36] studying you'll think my we've got that
[59:37] studied out and then the holy spirit
[59:39] will open another level to it you'll go
[59:41] oh my I didn't even know that was there
[59:43] and then it'll just keep going and keep
[59:46] going because
[59:48] inspiration amen the inspiration never
[59:50] ends and I I thank the Lord this morning
[59:53] to know that this is a time but I'll say
[59:57] this this this season that we're living
[59:59] is also a season of possession this is
[1:00:02] the season to possess the promises of
[1:00:04] God now U it is very uh real to us that
[1:00:08] God would make the promises but yet if
[1:00:11] you if you're studying the Book of
[1:00:12] Joshua you realize that these people
[1:00:14] were moving into promises that was made
[1:00:16] to Abraham and God said Abraham he gave
[1:00:19] him that land but you know it's it's not
[1:00:22] till you read the book of Acts the
[1:00:23] seventh chapter that you begin to
[1:00:25] realize that Abraham never possessed the
[1:00:28] land that he was promised he was only
[1:00:30] had the promise of it but the Bible said
[1:00:31] he never possessed possessed any of it
[1:00:34] but he only had the promise of
[1:00:36] possession but that it became the Seed
[1:00:38] of Abraham that received the benefits of
[1:00:41] what was promised unto Abraham and then
[1:00:43] later they moved into it it's it's the
[1:00:46] same uh reality to us that when Paul was
[1:00:49] here that Apostle Paul made these
[1:00:51] promises that was in the in the book of
[1:00:53] Ephesians and the book of Thessalonians
[1:00:55] in the book of Corinthians and he made
[1:00:57] promises uh let's just say he looked out
[1:00:59] there and said there there will come a
[1:01:01] time that there will be in the moment of
[1:01:02] the twinkling of an eye there will be a
[1:01:04] change and there will be a translation
[1:01:06] now we know he made that promise to the
[1:01:08] Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church
[1:01:09] did not possess that promise uh he made
[1:01:12] that promise under the Thessalonian
[1:01:14] church but the Thessalonians never
[1:01:15] possessed that promise amen but yet we
[1:01:18] know that this is the season today of
[1:01:21] when God will be moving the church into
[1:01:24] the possession of those things that this
[1:01:26] is the season of rapture and it's always
[1:01:28] amazed me that God would call one man to
[1:01:31] make a promise to him and then he would
[1:01:33] call another man to possess the promise
[1:01:35] he made under those people and to
[1:01:37] recognize as Abraham SE that this is not
[1:01:40] the age amen of writing the Bible this
[1:01:43] is not the age even of us standing here
[1:01:46] this morning and God just making
[1:01:48] promises to us but this actually is the
[1:01:51] season when the promises that had been
[1:01:53] made to every age have come to a climax
[1:01:57] and it will be fulfilled in this age
[1:01:59] amen for us to sit here this morning as
[1:02:01] a generation and believe that God has
[1:02:04] fulfilled everything and there's nothing
[1:02:06] left for us and there's there's nothing
[1:02:08] to possess and there's nothing else for
[1:02:10] us to do amen would put us in a state of
[1:02:13] of complacency it would put us in a
[1:02:15] state amen that there's no reason for
[1:02:17] prayer there's no reason to press on
[1:02:19] there's no reason to study there's no
[1:02:21] reason to have meetings amen but I
[1:02:24] believe there is much land yet to
[1:02:26] possess I believe that there is corners
[1:02:28] of this message that we've not TR out
[1:02:30] yet I believe there's possessions that
[1:02:32] can be given to the church amen that you
[1:02:35] have not experienced personally yet amen
[1:02:37] you've read about people that done it
[1:02:39] you've thought about it and you've heard
[1:02:40] the testimonies but it's available to
[1:02:43] every believer this morning and I
[1:02:46] believe amen personally that there is
[1:02:48] oppositions against this I I believe the
[1:02:50] enemy would put all kinds of oppositions
[1:02:53] he would put discouragement and and he
[1:02:55] would put Walt cities and he would put
[1:02:57] rivers and he would put Giants and there
[1:02:59] would be great oppositions to it but
[1:03:01] there is a people who's going to possess
[1:03:04] it anyhow because it's the anointing on
[1:03:07] their life to possess the promises of
[1:03:10] God you actually were born for this
[1:03:14] season and God prophesied of this season
[1:03:18] and we are the seed of this season I
[1:03:20] I've heard people say it yes one day
[1:03:22] it's going to happen well let me ask ask
[1:03:24] you when is that day if we believe that
[1:03:27] Russia is ramping up and and Israel and
[1:03:30] Hamas is ramping up and all of the world
[1:03:32] is coming together for great cataclysmic
[1:03:35] destruction as the Bible prophesied of
[1:03:38] Amen the season is upon us that the
[1:03:41] people that are living in this time now
[1:03:43] may I say this I believe we're the last
[1:03:45] generation of that Gentile church and
[1:03:48] the promises that have been made have
[1:03:50] been made to us and no matter the
[1:03:52] opposition that we are facing I believe
[1:03:54] that it's a moment in time that we are
[1:03:56] to press through I think we ought to lay
[1:03:59] aside every weight I think we ought to
[1:04:00] lay aside every Affliction I believe we
[1:04:03] ought to lay aside everything every
[1:04:05] excuse that we have and God can't use us
[1:04:08] and God can't do this and God can now I
[1:04:10] believe it's time to lay it aside and
[1:04:13] realize that yes we can I believe we
[1:04:16] ought to join Joshua and Caleb this
[1:04:18] morning and yes we can possess these
[1:04:21] promises I don't know how we're going to
[1:04:23] do it but yes he can I don't know how
[1:04:26] it's going to happen but he still
[1:04:28] Jehovah Gyra he is still the god of
[1:04:31] Abraham he's still a god of Joshua he's
[1:04:34] still the god of William ra he's still a
[1:04:37] God Amen of Paul and the alans he's
[1:04:40] still the god you recognize God Still
[1:04:43] Remains to be
[1:04:45] God and we are his children this morning
[1:04:48] and I believe we can move into these
[1:04:50] prises amen that we are the children
[1:04:53] amen of the pro promise and this is the
[1:04:55] season of the promise and I believe it's
[1:04:57] time to redeem the time that God has
[1:04:59] gave
[1:05:00] us amen I think it's time to quit
[1:05:03] pushing it off to another season and
[1:05:06] realize that we are the we are the
[1:05:08] leadership in this age it's time to quit
[1:05:12] looking for an example be the example
[1:05:15] quit looking for a leader be the leader
[1:05:18] you're looking for someone to look up to
[1:05:20] be the person they are looking up to
[1:05:23] it's the season for it it's the season
[1:05:26] where our young people can rise up and
[1:05:28] they can lead other young people they
[1:05:30] can make Believers and they can look
[1:05:32] around and say that's the way I want to
[1:05:34] live my life that's the way I want to be
[1:05:37] you don't have to sit here this morning
[1:05:39] and try to can I preach for our young
[1:05:41] people a minute you don't have to look
[1:05:43] around in this life and look at the
[1:05:45] worldly side and try to think about how
[1:05:48] amen how is it I can impress them and
[1:05:50] how can I be and how you're never going
[1:05:52] to impress the world you're never going
[1:05:54] to fit into the world so quit D and down
[1:05:57] what God gave you and rise up and shine
[1:06:01] like you never been he God Made You
[1:06:03] different so be different if God made
[1:06:06] you a separate people then be a separate
[1:06:08] people but be the greatest people you
[1:06:11] can be and then make people stand back
[1:06:13] and say oh my what an example of
[1:06:16] Christianity what an example of the
[1:06:18] grace of God we are here this morning
[1:06:21] and it doesn't matter the opposition I I
[1:06:24] believe that there's a lot of prophecies
[1:06:26] that are coming together there must be
[1:06:28] an evisions to this there must be a
[1:06:31] moving into this this seven seal book
[1:06:34] has opened and somebody's going to move
[1:06:36] into it this has been predicted Amen to
[1:06:39] happened it has happened and now
[1:06:42] somebody's moving into it I actually
[1:06:45] believe that we are the age of the
[1:06:47] Overcomer of the lean book I believe
[1:06:50] that somebody will overcome in this age
[1:06:54] every opposition and they will do it by
[1:06:56] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:06:58] their testimony I believe there are
[1:07:00] people here this morning that has been
[1:07:02] given the word of God for the season
[1:07:04] that we're living in and this word will
[1:07:07] defeat Satan anywhere any time in any
[1:07:11] form Satan is in and if if our faith
[1:07:14] will hold on to it Satan will never
[1:07:16] stand before the church now here's the
[1:07:19] thing your faith will only go as high as
[1:07:21] your adherence to the word of God
[1:07:24] because if you say brother Wayne I don't
[1:07:26] have faith this morning I don't have
[1:07:28] possession faith faith has a source and
[1:07:31] faith has a resting place the source of
[1:07:34] faith is the word of God you're never
[1:07:37] going to get Faith to overcome Giants
[1:07:39] watching TNT and ABC and CBS and CNN and
[1:07:45] yes Fox News amen it is a deteriation of
[1:07:48] your faith when you said and bring
[1:07:51] garbage into your heart am it tears down
[1:07:54] the faith that God has given you you
[1:07:57] said brother I I I feel like I'm nearly
[1:07:59] empty of Faith it's because what you're
[1:08:01] feeding on is not the word of God but if
[1:08:05] you feeding on the word of God that will
[1:08:07] a faith in your life and you begin to
[1:08:10] believe things that you never believe
[1:08:12] and imposses become possible and Giants
[1:08:16] become become possible for you to walk
[1:08:18] over mountains can be moved Rivers can
[1:08:21] be crossed walls can drop down because
[1:08:24] you're built for the opposition you are
[1:08:27] built for the age you are built for the
[1:08:29] anointing you are prophesied over to
[1:08:32] this age listen I know there's a lot
[1:08:34] going on but you have been prophesied in
[1:08:36] this generation that there would come an
[1:08:38] understanding I know people they look at
[1:08:41] the Bible and they look at the message
[1:08:42] they say well amen that stuff's too deep
[1:08:45] and I don't know if I can understand but
[1:08:47] do you recognize God was waiting on you
[1:08:49] to bring this
[1:08:50] word why did God not bring it in the
[1:08:53] early year years why did not God bring
[1:08:55] it in the Dark Ages why did God not I'll
[1:08:58] tell you what the prophet said about it
[1:09:00] he said he was waiting for a people to
[1:09:02] comprehended so you were built with an
[1:09:04] ability to understand things that are un
[1:09:07] misunderstood you were built with an
[1:09:09] ability to comprehend the greatest
[1:09:11] Mysteries that have ever been given to
[1:09:12] the age and it's not that they're not
[1:09:15] comprehendable the fact is that nobody's
[1:09:18] had the heart to just believe it like
[1:09:20] God gave to you I don't I don't mean
[1:09:23] amen the whole world couldn't do it but
[1:09:25] when God gave you something in your
[1:09:27] heart the Bible said he that have an ear
[1:09:29] let him
[1:09:33] hear now the teaching of this message
[1:09:36] would positionally placed but your faith
[1:09:38] adheres to the word you believe and the
[1:09:41] only place word can the only place faith
[1:09:44] can rest is on the foundation of the
[1:09:46] word if you try to put Faith anywhere
[1:09:49] else you're going to lose that faith in
[1:09:52] the future cuz Ming beasting your
[1:09:56] everything's going to change that's one
[1:09:59] thing that we can promise you change is
[1:10:01] coming change is coming I don't care who
[1:10:03] you are I don't care where you live
[1:10:06] change is coming your way to to be able
[1:10:09] to adapt to change is how we live right
[1:10:12] we have to adapt to changing TI we have
[1:10:15] to adapt Everything Changes humans
[1:10:17] change the worlds change our families
[1:10:19] change our lives change but there is
[1:10:21] something that never changed
[1:10:24] and that is the word of the Living God
[1:10:28] our lord Jesus said that heavens and
[1:10:30] earth can pass away but my word will
[1:10:34] never pass away then I would rather be
[1:10:38] standing on the word of God and standing
[1:10:41] in the heavens cuz the heavens can fall
[1:10:44] but the word of God can never fall and
[1:10:47] man that builds his life upon the word
[1:10:50] as a solid foundation and there's no
[1:10:52] devil can move
[1:10:55] there's no oppositions that can overcome
[1:10:58] him do you see what it is it is a
[1:11:00] position and what we're under in this
[1:11:02] age now I I think that it's powerful to
[1:11:05] see it what you're under is you're under
[1:11:07] a prophetic
[1:11:10] anointing now you you you have to
[1:11:12] realize that you're under a prophetic
[1:11:15] anointing right that you have been
[1:11:18] anointed by prophecy now if you if you
[1:11:21] just take this and realize people said
[1:11:24] well some people's under the law and
[1:11:26] some people's under this Paul said we
[1:11:28] are under grace right and that Grace
[1:11:32] being a prophetic word that was spoke
[1:11:35] over you there is some things that are
[1:11:37] greater than who you
[1:11:40] are now I I I just was studying the
[1:11:42] other day but man talks about purpose
[1:11:44] and God makes you for a purpose Paul
[1:11:46] says that everything was done for
[1:11:48] purpose Ephesians amen now if you watch
[1:11:51] the book of Ephesians Paul is all about
[1:11:52] purpose right
[1:11:54] everybody says there's a purpose but
[1:11:55] finally we know what the purpose is and
[1:11:58] that purpose when God makes a man for
[1:12:00] that you say well brother Wayne what
[1:12:02] about my what about my sovereign will
[1:12:05] what about my free will that's what's
[1:12:06] got you in all the
[1:12:08] trouble your choices is what got you in
[1:12:11] the trouble you're but the Sovereign God
[1:12:14] has made another Choice with your life
[1:12:16] and sometime or another you're going to
[1:12:18] begin to move into the sovereignty and
[1:12:21] the plan of almighty God which is
[1:12:23] greater than your choices which is
[1:12:25] greater than you are there is something
[1:12:28] over your life that is greater than you
[1:12:30] are and that is the word of the Living
[1:12:33] God and let me just show you in the
[1:12:34] scriptures and if you watch this watch
[1:12:36] this watch this Le the see of age you go
[1:12:39] there and says it's miserable wretched
[1:12:41] blind and naked right amen now now if
[1:12:44] you want to see the scriptures somebody
[1:12:47] holds the interpretation of that
[1:12:49] scripture walk right here in the streets
[1:12:52] and stand and walk watch prophecy walk
[1:12:55] by you naked
[1:12:58] miserable they don't even know that they
[1:13:01] need God right having need of nothing is
[1:13:06] that right this what you need no I don't
[1:13:08] need nothing can't tell them nothing
[1:13:11] can't give them nothing they don't need
[1:13:13] nothing they got everything now now
[1:13:15] watch the prophecy of that scripture
[1:13:17] watch what Paul says in the book of
[1:13:19] Timothy he and high minded and LS of
[1:13:22] Pleasures more than the of God false
[1:13:24] accusers aen you goes right down the
[1:13:26] line if you want to see a modern
[1:13:29] generation read the book of Timothy and
[1:13:31] see what he has to say about it if you
[1:13:33] want to see the modern Church look at
[1:13:36] the lardan church and you'll see what
[1:13:38] you're looking at but this was written
[1:13:40] 2,000 years ago and that prophecy is
[1:13:44] falling on a generation and they're
[1:13:47] walking in the prophecy whether they
[1:13:49] want to or not but there is another
[1:13:52] Prophecy in the Bible it says I don't
[1:13:55] have a church it'll be without spot I
[1:13:58] don't have a bride Church AR is prophecy
[1:14:01] laid over the lives of Believers
[1:14:03] today that prophecy is going to come can
[1:14:06] I say this the Bible says that Jesus
[1:14:09] himself says as it was in the days of
[1:14:11] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:14:14] and there sodomites everywhere I know
[1:14:16] it's not popular preaching anymore and
[1:14:18] remember our government has made it
[1:14:20] legal for them to have samex marriages
[1:14:22] we we we got to have government issues
[1:14:25] over our bathrooms whether they're male
[1:14:27] or female or by genders or how many
[1:14:30] other genders and we got the lbq to and
[1:14:33] they they just never quit amen and and
[1:14:35] so Mo amen what what are you saying I'm
[1:14:39] not trying to be mean to anybody I'm
[1:14:40] trying to tell you that Jesus said as it
[1:14:43] was in the days of Sodom and watch how
[1:14:46] Sodom has come right here it's 4,000
[1:14:50] years ago but Sodom is right here here
[1:14:53] again because Jesus said as it was in
[1:14:57] the days of
[1:14:59] s now now if God don't destroy this
[1:15:02] America for it's Sodom and the way it's
[1:15:04] with he'll have to raise up Sodom and
[1:15:06] gomorra and
[1:15:09] apologize now watch this because the
[1:15:11] prophecy is there look sodomy is there
[1:15:14] it's it's there it's everywhere it's in
[1:15:16] our law it's in our in
[1:15:19] our y'all bear with me it's everywhere
[1:15:22] now watch it's exactly where he said it
[1:15:25] would be as it was in the days of Noah
[1:15:28] he also said it and it's exactly where
[1:15:31] he said it would be what was in the days
[1:15:34] of Noah the sons of God looked upon the
[1:15:36] daughters of men amen and look at the
[1:15:38] world we're living in now amen and at
[1:15:41] the same time amen the scripture said
[1:15:43] every man's mind was upon evil amen look
[1:15:47] at the world we're living now there's so
[1:15:49] many levels of evil and media used to
[1:15:52] people used to just think you but there
[1:15:54] were barriers they wouldn't cross amen
[1:15:56] there was there was things they couldn't
[1:15:58] get over but all the barriers are gone
[1:16:00] now and the atmosphere of this age is
[1:16:03] everything's free do do whatever you
[1:16:06] think do whatever you feel well let me
[1:16:08] tell you this as a Believer some things
[1:16:10] you think and feel just ain't right amen
[1:16:13] and there ought to be a barrier on our
[1:16:15] lives there ought to be a barrier of the
[1:16:17] word of God that puts a life into action
[1:16:20] but the reason the world is where it's
[1:16:22] at is because the Bible said it would go
[1:16:24] there now God couldn't lead them there
[1:16:27] they had to turn down the truth the
[1:16:29] Bible said amen that they had not enough
[1:16:31] for the truth I know everybody's talking
[1:16:33] about love now but I'm going to preach
[1:16:35] cuz it's here everybody's talking about
[1:16:36] love now everything's love everybody
[1:16:38] love everybody love everybody and I
[1:16:40] believe God loves everybody right amen
[1:16:42] but there must be a love for truth
[1:16:44] that's greater than your love for this
[1:16:47] world if you don't love the truth over
[1:16:49] that you love the world then you ain't
[1:16:51] got no place with God Jesus said if the
[1:16:55] love of this world is in your heart then
[1:16:57] the love of my father is not in you so
[1:17:00] there's definitely two different kinds
[1:17:01] of love right and they got they just
[1:17:04] keep going and keep going and keep going
[1:17:06] and everybody gets so broadminded the
[1:17:08] brain just fell out amen nobody can
[1:17:10] stand up for anything anymore now I'm
[1:17:13] preaching to you because everything's in
[1:17:15] its position the Bible said you got to
[1:17:17] know the difference between truth and
[1:17:19] the spirit of error because there's two
[1:17:21] Spirits leading in the day we are not
[1:17:24] leading ourselves humans are not leading
[1:17:28] themselves there is a spirit leading you
[1:17:30] and either it's the spirit of God or
[1:17:33] it's the spirit of the devil and the
[1:17:35] devil is leading people into a mass
[1:17:38] destruction but don't tell me that the
[1:17:40] devil has the power am to put this world
[1:17:44] in the shape of to him but my God don't
[1:17:46] have the power to put the b in the
[1:17:49] Rapture in the last days tribulation w't
[1:17:51] put us in the rapture it's the power of
[1:17:54] God that puts us in and I say the god of
[1:17:57] Abraham is here leading the church today
[1:18:00] to possess the lands that he has made
[1:18:03] unto them we are under the grace of God
[1:18:05] there is an anointing Upon Our
[1:18:09] Lives amen amen the secrets of David
[1:18:12] David's great anointing and David's
[1:18:14] great secret of overcoming a giant amen
[1:18:17] was not that he was a mighty man it was
[1:18:20] that he had a heart after God but the
[1:18:22] real secret of David is he was
[1:18:25] chosen David was chosen above his
[1:18:28] brother he was the last BN but God has
[1:18:31] the ability to take the last born and
[1:18:34] give him the RS of the first BN God
[1:18:36] showed us that he can cross somebody's
[1:18:39] hands and lay the blessing of the one
[1:18:41] you don't think should be blessed but
[1:18:43] when God enots a man it don't matter who
[1:18:46] likes him or who don't when the blessing
[1:18:49] of Abram comes upon the blessing is
[1:18:52] there I love how God sent a prophet into
[1:18:55] s's house I just laugh because even the
[1:18:58] prophet want to go in there and anoint
[1:19:00] the tallest brother he want anoint the
[1:19:02] best choice man Samuel maybe Standing
[1:19:05] There He Man Jesse start pointing out
[1:19:07] puto on that one he he's a good boy put
[1:19:10] it on him amen and Old Samuel started to
[1:19:12] pour the anointing lord said no don't go
[1:19:14] on him all right amen walks over they
[1:19:17] pick another one amen try to put the
[1:19:19] anointing on him the anointing wouldn't
[1:19:21] fall on none of them amen they couldn't
[1:19:24] put it on them amen but but finally
[1:19:26] Samuel said I'm here to anoint a king
[1:19:29] there must be another son there must be
[1:19:32] somebody else amen and that's when they
[1:19:35] said well there's one more and he's out
[1:19:36] in the field watching the Sheep the last
[1:19:39] choice that Jesse had the last his own
[1:19:42] daddy didn't even choose him his
[1:19:44] brothers didn't choose him nobody chose
[1:19:47] him but God chose him and I tell you
[1:19:50] this God has went through seven angels
[1:19:53] just like the seven son of but there's
[1:19:56] one more there's one more as a bride who
[1:19:59] has the anointing of God in the last
[1:20:02] days and the prophet stood and ped the
[1:20:05] anointing over this church all Seven
[1:20:08] Seals were dumped out on this church my
[1:20:11] word is spirit and his life and it was
[1:20:14] dumped over this drve church and that's
[1:20:17] the secret behind us that's why we can
[1:20:20] destroy Giants that's why we can rise up
[1:20:23] in the morning in the midst of all
[1:20:25] trouble and we can lift our hands and we
[1:20:27] can say the Lord is Our Shepherd and I
[1:20:30] sh my wall he making me to lie down he
[1:20:33] all he's with me even in The Valleys of
[1:20:36] the Shadows of death because the
[1:20:38] anointing is
[1:20:41] upon listen when that anointing comes
[1:20:43] upon you it's an anointing that is
[1:20:46] commanded toward your life David's power
[1:20:50] was transferred to him by Pro prophetic
[1:20:53] anointing
[1:20:55] yeah it was transferred by prophetic
[1:20:58] anointing what happened in that little
[1:21:01] room between a prophet and a little boy
[1:21:06] changed his entire future and it made
[1:21:09] God himself say thy Throne on David I
[1:21:12] will establish forever oh my goodness
[1:21:15] with the anointing of God I I don't know
[1:21:18] about y'all but I love it when you just
[1:21:20] get in that little room
[1:21:23] and that prophetic anointing it starts
[1:21:25] resting and and all of a sudden you
[1:21:27] start realizing that you're under
[1:21:30] something different you're under
[1:21:32] something different see God's Prophet
[1:21:35] claims a generation for the Fulfillment
[1:21:39] of his
[1:21:41] words God's Prophet God's word will
[1:21:45] claim a
[1:21:47] generation this message will claim a
[1:21:50] people for its fulfillment
[1:21:54] those people are ordained to fulfill it
[1:21:57] and here's the beauty if you look at it
[1:21:59] I always liked it how if you go back in
[1:22:01] Ezekiel and you watch Ezekiel chapter 37
[1:22:04] and you watch how Ezekiel standing on
[1:22:05] the valley and he's looking at a valley
[1:22:07] of dry
[1:22:08] bones it's it's a pretty good read and
[1:22:11] if you look at it it it it's it's
[1:22:13] actually just an impossible situation
[1:22:15] and God looks at him and he says to him
[1:22:17] he said he said son of man can these
[1:22:19] folks live and I love how Ezekiel Danes
[1:22:21] M said Lord down know
[1:22:23] I don't know I don't know I don't know
[1:22:25] if there can be life in them looks like
[1:22:27] dry bones but if you're asking there
[1:22:29] must be a reason you're asking Lord thou
[1:22:31] knowest and I love how God responds to
[1:22:34] the prophet he said prophesy thou son of
[1:22:37] man and these bones shall live and I
[1:22:40] love how that the LIE could come to dead
[1:22:44] bones by
[1:22:46] prophecy by the uttered prophetic word
[1:22:50] things that don't live and have no
[1:22:53] ability to live is about to live I love
[1:22:56] how he says it when he comes up and and
[1:22:58] Ezekiel looks over the valley of D Dry
[1:23:00] Bones who had no hope of Resurrection at
[1:23:02] all and he looks upon them and he said
[1:23:05] oh ye Dry Bones hear ye the word of the
[1:23:08] Lord hear ye the word of the Lord watch
[1:23:11] Faith cometh by hearing the word of the
[1:23:13] Lord right leadership and obedience come
[1:23:17] by hearing of the word here's my problem
[1:23:19] a bone and ear don't a a a a a skeleton
[1:23:23] don't have an
[1:23:24] ear amen that that matter of fact your
[1:23:27] ear ain't even bone it's it's actually
[1:23:29] carage just some bones down in there but
[1:23:31] it's actually cartilage and he told them
[1:23:33] to hear you the word of the Lord how
[1:23:35] could they hear how could they hear how
[1:23:38] how was it there was no ability within
[1:23:41] them to hear and respond but when God
[1:23:44] commands a word toward a generation and
[1:23:47] then that word will command a lie to
[1:23:51] respond when it doesn't you can look at
[1:23:53] that same life and say there's no hope
[1:23:55] for them you can look at the same
[1:23:58] situation and say that marriage is done
[1:24:00] you can say oh that church is finished
[1:24:03] oh that family's over oh this is over
[1:24:05] here but there is a word that is command
[1:24:10] a the church it no matter what
[1:24:15] comes that prophecy will hold a command
[1:24:18] over that life and I tell you when God
[1:24:21] commands a blessing to with someone it
[1:24:23] is an irrevocable
[1:24:26] blessing well we might as well preach
[1:24:28] since we're here it is an irrevocable
[1:24:30] blessing amen I don't care what anybody
[1:24:32] says they can't remove the blessing that
[1:24:34] God has blessed somebody when God
[1:24:36] blesses you you're
[1:24:38] blessed when God blesses you you're
[1:24:40] blessed can I tell you who's got the
[1:24:41] blessing he said blessed are your eyes
[1:24:44] for they see and blessed are your ears
[1:24:46] who they hearen the word of God is your
[1:24:50] blessing and what God has blessed there
[1:24:53] is no man can curse because the blessing
[1:24:56] is upon
[1:24:58] Him everybody's going to look at you
[1:25:00] different everybody's going to look at
[1:25:02] the church different everybody's going
[1:25:03] to look at the people different and we
[1:25:05] we we we know how we know how B looked
[1:25:08] at the church right and B tried to hire
[1:25:11] him Amen to cural but it didn't work
[1:25:14] because when B went to B and said come
[1:25:16] here and curse these people amen he took
[1:25:18] them out to you know bam got moved three
[1:25:21] different times from three different
[1:25:23] angles to see the problems of Israel
[1:25:26] because B and B are talking B said says
[1:25:28] to en curse these people and and Bam
[1:25:31] comes back he said well look he said I
[1:25:33] I'm trying to he said but there's no am
[1:25:35] of witchery there's no there's no
[1:25:37] sorcery there's there's nothing I can do
[1:25:39] to to curse these people because God has
[1:25:42] blessed these people he said well go out
[1:25:44] there and curse them anyhow and pay
[1:25:46] locks out there and he looks at the
[1:25:47] children of Israel and he's going to
[1:25:49] curse them and he says oh how Godly of
[1:25:51] th T J
[1:25:53] amen because God couldn't see what B
[1:25:58] saw amen when when bam he he changes in
[1:26:02] three different locations right he takes
[1:26:04] him in in three different areas to try
[1:26:06] to get bam to agree that these people
[1:26:09] need curses and and and the scriptures
[1:26:11] is beautiful because when they when they
[1:26:13] get into these areas they all need
[1:26:15] something I don't have time to preach on
[1:26:16] this morning but it's amazing to me
[1:26:18] because from three different areas bam
[1:26:21] keeps seeing problem
[1:26:22] and V keep seeing problems amen but you
[1:26:25] know what's amazing is God never saw
[1:26:27] what they saw but they never saw what
[1:26:30] God saw and then and let me tell you
[1:26:32] this who's going to win the argument if
[1:26:34] God sees one thing man sees another God
[1:26:37] is the one it matters what God sees I
[1:26:40] tell you what my said he said God he
[1:26:43] said bam saw everything that could be
[1:26:46] done under the calar I guess he meant
[1:26:49] about every Wicked work was in Israel
[1:26:52] about everything you can think of but
[1:26:54] said morally he said it was a horrible
[1:26:57] situation he said but Bam could see the
[1:27:00] moral problem but he couldn't see that
[1:27:02] slitting rock over there and he couldn't
[1:27:05] see that Pillar of Fire and he couldn't
[1:27:08] hear can you imagine he couldn't hear he
[1:27:10] could hear the problems he could hear fa
[1:27:13] but he couldn't hear the shout of the
[1:27:15] king I was in that camp the word of God
[1:27:18] was among him I tell you what I pray
[1:27:21] this morning amen that we're able to see
[1:27:23] what God sees about the Church of the
[1:27:26] Living God and know this that now the
[1:27:28] reason I'm saying this is Baum amen was
[1:27:31] trying to stop Moses from going in the
[1:27:33] promised
[1:27:35] land he was on this road so what they
[1:27:37] were trying to do was stop the progress
[1:27:40] but you'll never stop the progress of
[1:27:42] God's church because God has made a way
[1:27:46] when there is no
[1:27:49] way I say what it looked different from
[1:27:52] where B was standing and where B was
[1:27:54] standing and when the word of God comes
[1:27:57] to your generation it is a prophetic
[1:27:59] anointing that cannot be broken a
[1:28:02] blessing that cannot be
[1:28:04] revoked amen a blessing that you cannot
[1:28:07] take away from him amen listen here's
[1:28:10] here's a beautiful thing Lazarus was
[1:28:12] already dead Lazarus was already dead he
[1:28:17] was past helping himself he was amen the
[1:28:21] way we say today well if they can't help
[1:28:22] theel then we can't help them amen they
[1:28:25] won't even help theel so we won't help
[1:28:27] them Lazarus couldn't help himself
[1:28:29] Lazarus was dead in the Tomb but the
[1:28:31] master amen the very God in heaven stood
[1:28:34] in the Tomb and said laes come forth
[1:28:37] amen and though a man lay Dead four days
[1:28:39] in the grave corruption couldn't hold it
[1:28:42] amen trouble couldn't hold it because
[1:28:44] the master should come out of the gra I
[1:28:47] tell you this morning the message of the
[1:28:48] hour came to you you in the
[1:28:52] up you and they said they'll never make
[1:28:55] it but there was a voice of the master
[1:28:57] said come out of there my people and the
[1:29:00] death Clos with put it on and there was
[1:29:02] a resurrection in your life you couldn't
[1:29:05] help yourself but the message called
[1:29:09] you what is this overwhelming what is
[1:29:12] this overwhelming feeling yes sir you
[1:29:16] know I one of my favorite scriptures in
[1:29:18] the entire Bible is when Jesus looked at
[1:29:20] his disciples and he said you didn't
[1:29:22] choose me
[1:29:23] yeah I chose
[1:29:28] you now one of my favorite pastimes one
[1:29:31] of them is
[1:29:32] fishing and you know one thing I found
[1:29:34] out about fish I never we all my fish a
[1:29:38] lot now I caught caught Big 10 pounder
[1:29:40] last fall a real nice fish got him up on
[1:29:43] the boat brother Tom he didn't roll over
[1:29:45] look at me and say I finally did it I
[1:29:48] finally caught me a
[1:29:50] fisherman because fish don't catch
[1:29:53] fisherman we caught the fish it's about
[1:29:56] like you looking at God and saying I
[1:29:59] finally made it I finally got you I
[1:30:02] finally sought you till I got everything
[1:30:04] I need it's not you singing God it's God
[1:30:08] seeking you it's not you choosing God
[1:30:12] it's God choosing you I pray it to you
[1:30:14] the very desire in your heart to have
[1:30:17] more of God is because God gave it to
[1:30:19] you there's a million people walking in
[1:30:21] this place
[1:30:22] right now it has no desire at all for a
[1:30:25] relationship with Jesus Christ but God
[1:30:28] put something in you to make you turn
[1:30:30] aside and come to his word and made it
[1:30:34] it's because it wasn't you choosing him
[1:30:37] it's him choosing you and he chose you
[1:30:39] for salvation and you shout in but he
[1:30:42] also chose you to possess the land I
[1:30:46] promise that we are end the season God
[1:30:49] CH you you can rise above your fears you
[1:30:52] can rise above the uping of others to
[1:30:55] move into the word of God I say this to
[1:30:57] you this morning on this beautiful
[1:30:59] Sunday morning we're sitting here in
[1:31:00] Branson Missouri amen we're a long ways
[1:31:02] away from the East
[1:31:04] Coast can you imagine if our early PGM
[1:31:08] fathers who landed at Plymouth Rock
[1:31:11] would have said this is a wonderful land
[1:31:13] and this is as far as we go oh where
[1:31:17] would we be this morning all if our
[1:31:20] early Pilgrim fathers would have said we
[1:31:22] have found clth Rock and we have reached
[1:31:26] the potential of this new land wouldn't
[1:31:29] it be something if that's where they set
[1:31:31] up and they made their camps and they
[1:31:33] said that's as far as we're going but
[1:31:35] there was something in there that knew
[1:31:38] better they knew there was a frontier
[1:31:40] out there they knew there was a horizon
[1:31:43] and they were Savage they were Savage
[1:31:45] people only it there were people that's
[1:31:47] going to die the snakes were going to be
[1:31:49] bit by people they were going to be
[1:31:50] eaten by wild beast there was bears in
[1:31:52] that Land There was every kind of
[1:31:54] opposition in this United States of
[1:31:56] America but there was something coming
[1:31:58] to the hearts and those early P fathers
[1:32:02] that they wanted to be able to possess
[1:32:05] whatever laid over that hill and you
[1:32:07] know what they did they didn't stay at
[1:32:09] clth Rock they begin to press in no
[1:32:12] matter the
[1:32:13] oppositions and if you're if you're a
[1:32:15] history student you'll you'll hear the
[1:32:17] word Manifest Destiny that was what they
[1:32:20] actually called what happened to them
[1:32:22] early fathers that made them leave their
[1:32:25] homes they left all they knew and went
[1:32:28] out into a land they didn't know they
[1:32:30] didn't know what was going to happen
[1:32:32] they didn't know what was going to take
[1:32:33] place now you got to make up your mind
[1:32:36] either you stay in the safety of
[1:32:37] denomination you stay in the safety of a
[1:32:40] certain click in the message you stay in
[1:32:42] the safety of that when you go out into
[1:32:45] the land you go out into the promises of
[1:32:47] God you get out into that land there a
[1:32:50] there a million men this morning amen
[1:32:53] that wish they had have not listened to
[1:32:54] everybody else and moved out there but
[1:32:57] there was some men that were so
[1:32:59] possessed with Manifest Destiny that
[1:33:01] they had nothing they could do it was
[1:33:04] like a it was like a it was like a
[1:33:05] sickness that come upon
[1:33:10] me brother it was it was an what word am
[1:33:14] I looking for with them right what was
[1:33:16] that word amen they were Afflicted they
[1:33:19] were actually afflicted by it I like
[1:33:22] that word they were actually afflicted
[1:33:24] by the idea I got to get in this land it
[1:33:27] was an Affliction on them amen and and
[1:33:30] and I I love it because you know you
[1:33:32] think about sicknesses but you know
[1:33:33] while back we were talking to one of the
[1:33:35] brothers and he gave me a letter amen of
[1:33:37] of the early right brothers when they
[1:33:39] got ready to fly and you know what they
[1:33:41] said they said they they said we have
[1:33:43] been afflicted by the desire to get in
[1:33:46] the air Amen in other words they
[1:33:48] couldn't even have normal relationships
[1:33:50] they couldn't have a normal evening they
[1:33:52] couldn't sit out at the supper table and
[1:33:54] just enjoy their family there was an
[1:33:56] Affliction on them that they were to get
[1:33:59] in the air there was an airplane age
[1:34:00] coming and they had to get in the air
[1:34:03] that was an Affliction that was a
[1:34:04] manifest that was pushing their lives
[1:34:07] and so has there been a manifest destiny
[1:34:11] of the predestination of God that we
[1:34:13] Afflicted with the lessons of the hour
[1:34:15] it's an Affliction upon us we can not
[1:34:19] stay for some reason I not
[1:34:22] satisfied some reason you're not
[1:34:24] satisfied some reason that you're not
[1:34:26] satisfied with just a little sermon a
[1:34:28] little Bible story for some reason that
[1:34:30] you've not just been able to join some
[1:34:32] cold dead formal religion and just s
[1:34:35] there but something in your heart you
[1:34:37] know there's a living God you know
[1:34:39] there's a reality and said
[1:34:42] my oh God after a living God and any man
[1:34:46] that has ever come in contact with a
[1:34:48] living God no way can you return back to
[1:34:51] the IDS and the formality of a church
[1:34:55] service just coming and sing and being a
[1:34:58] part amen amen there's more land to
[1:35:00] possess than that there there there's
[1:35:02] levels of worship that we've never
[1:35:05] reached I we going to a certain point
[1:35:08] and then everybody wants to pull back
[1:35:10] cuz they're afraid they're going to go
[1:35:11] too far the prophet said we are to
[1:35:13] worship and we don't even know our name
[1:35:15] we want to drink of the wine of
[1:35:17] Revelation till we get some lost in
[1:35:19] worship until the spirit of God and take
[1:35:22] over our life and we can have communion
[1:35:25] under worship I believe I believe
[1:35:27] worship I believe the truth of God we
[1:35:29] break out our lives there's a manifest
[1:35:32] destiny in your life there's something
[1:35:34] makes you pick them books
[1:35:37] up that's right for some reason there's
[1:35:40] a lot of people in this world that had
[1:35:42] never felt what you feel about
[1:35:47] it sometimes we think it's
[1:35:50] afflictions
[1:35:53] now y'all know R prayed that that
[1:35:55] wouldn't happen to him no
[1:35:58] more he literally went to a a cave and
[1:36:01] prayed for days and said Lord take this
[1:36:04] thing from me it's like an Affliction
[1:36:07] yeah cuz his brothers wouldn't get in
[1:36:09] they wouldn't they wouldn't they
[1:36:10] wouldn't believe this it was the
[1:36:12] devil so to stay with Brotherhood he
[1:36:15] would he was ready to but but he
[1:36:17] couldn't it was like an
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:19] Affliction and that's that's
[1:36:22] exactly what has caught your
[1:36:25] life and there's some reason that you
[1:36:28] are propelled forward into the world
[1:36:31] thank you
[1:36:32] Lord every one of you sitting here this
[1:36:34] morning have come to a spot in your life
[1:36:38] of
[1:36:39] discouragement of cataclysm destructions
[1:36:43] of situations that have just so
[1:36:46] intermingled and that's the place you
[1:36:48] wanted to set
[1:36:50] out that's the place that hurts so bad
[1:36:53] you don't know how to take another step
[1:36:56] it the situation was so rough you're
[1:36:58] having a hard time believing there's
[1:37:00] Hope For Tomorrow amen because of the
[1:37:03] situations that are laying there you're
[1:37:05] saying that but let me assure you
[1:37:07] there's sunlight on the other side of
[1:37:08] the
[1:37:11] Hill there's sunlight on the other side
[1:37:13] of the Hill can can I preach a little
[1:37:14] bit amen it's like a little chicken
[1:37:17] that's in an egg amen you can't you
[1:37:20] can't break the chicken out of the egg
[1:37:23] or he'll die if he does survive he's so
[1:37:26] weak that his children amen will be weak
[1:37:29] Breakers as well they get weaker and
[1:37:31] weaker and weaker with these Generations
[1:37:33] but you got to let a chicken break out
[1:37:35] of its own egg amen but God gave it what
[1:37:38] it needed in the egg when when the
[1:37:41] chicken's going to get out of the egg
[1:37:42] everything it needs is in there already
[1:37:44] and you know how he breaks out he breaks
[1:37:46] out by his beak there's a little there's
[1:37:48] a little beak there and that's the way
[1:37:50] he breaks out of that egg and he has to
[1:37:52] do it
[1:37:53] himself he has to break out of it and in
[1:37:56] his little mind maybe it's dark and he's
[1:37:59] thinking I don't know what's out there I
[1:38:01] don't know what's going to happen I
[1:38:02] don't I there's all kinds of fears amen
[1:38:05] but but listen amen there's something
[1:38:07] inside him that he can't just sit down
[1:38:10] in the egg and say this is all there is
[1:38:13] to life but something inside since you
[1:38:16] got to press against it you got to press
[1:38:19] against it you got to press against it
[1:38:21] and after a little while he keeps
[1:38:23] beating until there's a little hole
[1:38:24] pierced and he sticks his head out and
[1:38:26] goes oh my goodness there is so many
[1:38:31] more things to
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:36] life there is so much more to this
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:45] message you know the beauty the beauty
[1:38:48] the beauty of nature is nature is Bible
[1:38:50] itself right that's right the beauty of
[1:38:52] Nature and nature is the only thing that
[1:38:54] agrees with Christianity no other
[1:38:56] religion actually is witnessed by Nature
[1:38:59] itself but nature actually Witnesses and
[1:39:03] this is powerful to me because because
[1:39:05] it's it's a very simple way for me to
[1:39:07] catch things but you realize uh that
[1:39:11] when a when a cacom when he's at a
[1:39:13] certain stage in his life that he has to
[1:39:16] progress or he never becomes a
[1:39:20] mfag
[1:39:21] and his Destiny is a
[1:39:23] motherfly but he's got to progress right
[1:39:26] he's got to now maybe maybe maybe a
[1:39:29] maybe a caterpillar would say to himself
[1:39:31] you know what I like being caterpillar
[1:39:35] and I I don't I don't really I I'm
[1:39:37] scared of heights and and I'm and I'm
[1:39:39] scared of I'm scared of Dark Places and
[1:39:42] I'm scared of all the calls and I'm
[1:39:44] scared of these loud services and but
[1:39:47] but there's actually something in him
[1:39:50] that that forces him forward to a cocoon
[1:39:54] there's actually a thus sayith the Lord
[1:39:56] over his life you you recognize the one
[1:39:59] that created him knows his Destiny when
[1:40:01] he don't know his Destiny and this this
[1:40:04] is powerful to me he can't stay a
[1:40:06] caterpiller because he was never created
[1:40:08] a caterpillar God didn't create
[1:40:11] caterpillar he created
[1:40:14] butterflies he did not create Fallen
[1:40:17] Sons God did not create Sinners he
[1:40:21] created adopted Sons so whatever stage
[1:40:24] you're in you're on your way to a full
[1:40:27] sunship that's what God saw you has as
[1:40:30] full sunship and you're walking along
[1:40:32] the path and all of a sudden you like
[1:40:34] the stage you're in you like the
[1:40:36] fellowship you like the people amen and
[1:40:38] you say to yourself well this be nice to
[1:40:40] settle here cuz I'm afraid of the future
[1:40:42] amen but there's something that God has
[1:40:44] created you foren that makes you press
[1:40:46] on anyhow it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:40:49] you're going to move on anyhow because
[1:40:50] because it's an absolute truth over your
[1:40:55] life I was preaching like this in India
[1:40:57] one time and uh and while I while I was
[1:41:00] preaching I was actually talking about
[1:41:01] the absolute power of God over the life
[1:41:03] of humanity now now it's it's an
[1:41:06] absolute power over his
[1:41:08] children and when I was preaching that
[1:41:10] way brother West I comeing into a school
[1:41:12] where reminds me at this place a little
[1:41:13] bit except it was a little deeper but it
[1:41:15] was about it was this type of thing but
[1:41:17] the walls behind me was solid amen and
[1:41:20] and it was was a school room of Hindus
[1:41:22] and that's the school room they had
[1:41:24] boards on the wall behind you but they
[1:41:26] wasn't frame pictures they were just
[1:41:27] posters and the India they had a lot of
[1:41:30] posters and these posters they had these
[1:41:32] posters and and some of them were of the
[1:41:34] Hindu gods and anybody who's ever seen H
[1:41:37] gods they are ugly man I mean they got
[1:41:40] some ugly Gods if I was going to draw my
[1:41:42] own God I'd at least put some beauty to
[1:41:44] her something but but they're ugly gods
[1:41:47] and they had their posters up there
[1:41:49] we're in the school room and I said to
[1:41:51] the brothers when we come in I said
[1:41:53] Brothers I'm I'm going to preach the
[1:41:54] gospel cuz you take them things down and
[1:41:57] you know it's going to be behind me and
[1:41:58] they said no sorry brother man it's a
[1:42:00] Hindu school it's a Hindu government and
[1:42:02] said we can use it to preach but we
[1:42:05] can't touch anything they have said you
[1:42:07] got to leave it alone I said all right
[1:42:08] so I'm preaching right along and I come
[1:42:10] up with the absolute authority of God's
[1:42:12] word and there was a lady sitting kind
[1:42:14] of in the back she was about halfway
[1:42:16] back on the aisle and she just fell out
[1:42:18] into the in the middle of the aisle she
[1:42:20] just out and she started ring I don't
[1:42:22] know if you ever seen any of them uh uh
[1:42:24] films or pictures of people with
[1:42:26] exorcism but that's exactly what she
[1:42:28] looked like she was just kind of baled
[1:42:30] up the floor she was it it was a
[1:42:32] horrible sight and and I just young
[1:42:34] preacher but until I didn't know what to
[1:42:36] do with it I never like that you're in
[1:42:40] America amen but when I seen it I
[1:42:42] remember the scripture where it said
[1:42:43] there in Timothy preach the word so I
[1:42:47] thought I'll tell you what I'm going to
[1:42:48] do I'm just keep preaching the word and
[1:42:50] just I kept preaching and all of a
[1:42:52] sudden the Holy Spirit quieted me and he
[1:42:54] said pray for the woman so I stopped and
[1:42:56] I said hey everybody bow your heads the
[1:42:58] brothers kind of s in the back and I
[1:43:00] said Would You Walk put your hand on the
[1:43:01] sister I said let's all begin to pray
[1:43:03] together and as we started praying and
[1:43:06] we started praying the Holy Spirit began
[1:43:08] to move and and I felt I felt a real
[1:43:10] peace coming through me just a real real
[1:43:12] real solid atmosphere and when I raised
[1:43:15] my head I was going to go right back
[1:43:17] into that same word I was just going to
[1:43:19] keep preaching the same thing I've been
[1:43:20] preaching
[1:43:21] and when I started to say something all
[1:43:23] of a sudden I heard myself say Amen if
[1:43:26] that woman don't raise up out of the
[1:43:27] floor that God is not even God and I
[1:43:30] almost covered my mouth cuz I thought
[1:43:32] what a crazy thing for a man to say
[1:43:33] God's God whatever you know but I said
[1:43:36] that when when I said it all of a sudden
[1:43:39] brother brother Tom there was literally
[1:43:41] like a fog settled in that room and
[1:43:44] there was people sitting the the
[1:43:45] ministers that day about probably 25 30
[1:43:48] pastors sitting there and they were s
[1:43:50] off to my ride and you you couldn't
[1:43:52] hardly see them for the fog and they
[1:43:54] told me they couldn't see me and all
[1:43:56] that was just a fog settled in that room
[1:43:58] and when that fog settled in all of a
[1:44:00] sudden a wind started blowing and that
[1:44:02] woman got up out of the floor and starts
[1:44:05] waving her hands and holling well all of
[1:44:07] a sudden it just starts going across the
[1:44:09] congregation and people starts coming in
[1:44:11] the spirit of God they start hauling
[1:44:13] Hallelujah and Glory you can just hear
[1:44:15] it all over the congregation and this
[1:44:17] wind starts
[1:44:19] whipping and when this comes in the room
[1:44:21] brother Jake it takes those posters
[1:44:23] right off of that wall and and and those
[1:44:26] posters are lone that woman is standing
[1:44:29] up and it was the power of God that that

[1:45:21] favor of the Lord sits above me and it
[1:45:24] is the Zeal of the Lord that will
[1:45:26] perform these things this Ain what we
[1:45:28] can do ourselves come on church when the
[1:45:31] Lord came unto Mary he said Mary thou
[1:45:34] found favor with God and thou shall have
[1:45:36] a child amen and she said well I don't
[1:45:38] know how I'm going to do it he said the
[1:45:40] power of the Lord shall overshadow me
[1:45:43] that's why it was said in Isaiah the
[1:45:45] Zeal of the Lord will perform these
[1:45:48] things this is not your doing
[1:45:51] this is God is looking for a
[1:45:53] surrenderance from our There's A Jero in
[1:45:56] front of you on the other side of Jero
[1:45:59] there is a l
[1:46:01] fall there is power and
[1:46:07] Grace you know what happens I'm not you
[1:46:10] know what happens amen what happens is
[1:46:13] is when God opens the doors to it it's
[1:46:15] to you it's up to you to go in and get
[1:46:19] it I say this if you never heard it I

[1:46:53] your personal possession and the blood
[1:46:56] of Jesus has bought every promise in
[1:46:58] this book belongs to you but until you
[1:47:02] claim it for yourself it is not your
[1:47:05] personal possession and that's why he
[1:47:07] said Joshua you're going to have to walk
[1:47:10] out this land every step you take is
[1:47:14] going to be your possession and every
[1:47:16] step the church makes it's going to be

[1:51:06] one Li and stay there I preaching to you
[1:51:09] but we're not climbing the tree of
[1:51:10] knowledge we're climbing the tree of
[1:51:13] life and there's more lims on this tree
[1:51:16] come on Church the prophet God said my
[1:51:19] this he said when they brought back the
[1:51:21] grapes from the promised land and Joshua
[1:51:24] and Caleb come bringing those grapes in
[1:51:26] they had to pack them you know he
[1:51:28] brother brother said they showed the
[1:51:29] evidence of Those Grapes can you imagine
[1:51:32] if they would have just took the grapes
[1:51:33] and said that's all we want but see the
[1:51:36] graes wasn't the point they own the land
[1:51:39] and come out of can you imagine if the
[1:51:42] church comes up to the gifts of the
[1:51:44] Spirit and say this is where we're going
[1:51:46] to stop this is all there is to it
[1:51:48] listen that's just where the church
[1:51:52] started come on Luther had to
[1:51:56] progress amen Wesley picked up Luther's
[1:51:59] message and progressed and the Pentecost
[1:52:02] was picked up with the Wesley un stopped
[1:52:05] and the method is stop but the but the
[1:52:07] Pentecostal said there's more of God and
[1:52:10] they broke into the spiritual gift but
[1:52:12] can you imagine today if that's as far
[1:52:14] as we're going to go into gifts and
[1:52:16] spiritual things like that amen but
[1:52:18] listen there was more coming
[1:52:20] and God had another limb on the tree and
[1:52:23] the word that was in the beginning was
[1:52:25] going to come to the end and there would
[1:52:27] come a you in possession and having
[1:52:30] every promise and God is made no I'm not
[1:52:33] stopping on one Le I'm not to get on
[1:52:36] predestination and that's all we can
[1:52:38] preach I'm not going to get on gifts and
[1:52:40] that's all we can preach I'm not going
[1:52:42] to get on sh and that's all we can
[1:52:44] preach there the tree of
[1:52:47] the up this tree everything on this tree
[1:52:51] belongs to
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:53] me nor are you going to take the gifts
[1:52:57] or the sh or the rejoicing away from me
[1:53:00] because it belongs to me
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:08] personally can you imagine this morning
[1:53:11] if we had to have this meeting on CL
[1:53:15] Rock because our
[1:53:18] forefathers
[1:53:20] decided that's all there is to
[1:53:24] have but somebody sir had to believe
[1:53:27] there's
[1:53:29] more can you imagine if we come to a
[1:53:33] place of this
[1:53:35] message where we think this is all it is
[1:53:38] we've got everything this is all we got
[1:53:41] what we have is all we need we don't
[1:53:44] need to study our Bibles we don't need
[1:53:45] to study the message we do not need to
[1:53:47] pray we do not need to attend churches
[1:53:50] all we need to do is get
[1:53:55] together but somebody
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:01] believed they told Brother brand all
[1:54:03] these Supernatural things has happen in
[1:54:05] your life from the
[1:54:07] devil can you imagine if he would have
[1:54:11] accept
[1:54:12] that who would we be this
[1:54:15] morning so Supernatural starts happening
[1:54:18] in a Ministry in a life and when
[1:54:20] somebody comes wrong it may be some
[1:54:22] jealousy talking you don't want that
[1:54:24] Supernatural no so then they start say
[1:54:27] well that's the devil and this is to so
[1:54:29] what's what's it what's it designed to
[1:54:31] do it's designed to get you to
[1:54:34] stop don't progress anybody Cody have
[1:54:37] you ever been down to the uh you've been
[1:54:39] down to the convenience store and you
[1:54:41] walk in and it says
[1:54:44] no you ever wonder
[1:54:47] why it's because of count $100 bill but
[1:54:51] isn't it odd that some people just can't
[1:54:54] tell the difference or don't want to
[1:54:56] take the time so they just say no
[1:55:00] h and there's certain places now no
[1:55:06] gifts it's because of the
[1:55:09] fal but I think that gifts are valuable
[1:55:12] enough that we should take time and
[1:55:15] divide the TR from the
[1:55:18] false people worship moves into a church
[1:55:22] the power of God flies across and maybe
[1:55:24] there's a hypocrite involved well God
[1:55:26] bless them they're enjoying
[1:55:27] church that's about probably all they're
[1:55:29] going to
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:32] get they ain't had the grace to live the
[1:55:34] way you're living okay but but but are
[1:55:38] you seeing but but then somebody said we
[1:55:40] don't want none of that in here it's
[1:55:42] because they seen somebody that wasn't
[1:55:43] right do it so now it's all
[1:55:46] false so all of a sudden you can't you
[1:55:49] can't progress Rest In Worship because
[1:55:51] somebody did it
[1:55:53] wrong come amen so so we look at this
[1:55:56] and see so somebody they they got into
[1:55:58] the seven Thunders and taught them and
[1:56:00] they got him
[1:56:01] wrong but all of a sudden we're not
[1:56:03] supposed to teach about it somebody got
[1:56:06] into adoption and they taught it wrong
[1:56:08] so all of a sudden you can't talk about
[1:56:11] it but I'm not going to quit talking
[1:56:14] about the
[1:56:16] message that is a promise in this
[1:56:19] message
[1:56:20] and the inhabitance of this message
[1:56:21] belongs to you I don't care how many
[1:56:24] people are imitating how many false
[1:56:26] stents having any troubles I was not
[1:56:30] designed to put my eyes on the wrong
[1:56:33] thing I was designed to look at the
[1:56:35] promises of God and call pres and say
[1:56:39] it's absolutely
[1:56:42] true so brother way don't you see the
[1:56:45] same things we see I do I I actually do
[1:56:48] I see some the same things maybe maybe
[1:56:51] because of the anointing I may see it a
[1:56:54] little clearer even than you do
[1:56:56] sometimes and I see something behind
[1:56:58] something that maybe other people ain't
[1:57:00] even seen it yet and won't see it for a
[1:57:02] while but you know what I'm I'm I'm
[1:57:04] Abraham and stock amen I have been born
[1:57:07] to the Holy Spirit and Abraham looked at
[1:57:10] things and called them as they were not
[1:57:13] so he can call things that are as they
[1:57:15] were real and David let's just get David
[1:57:18] for an example in the scripture David is
[1:57:20] standing there looking at a valley of
[1:57:21] enemies there's a Philistines they're
[1:57:23] there he sees them plainly but you know
[1:57:25] what God instructs him to do he stru him
[1:57:28] wait on me before you go down there and
[1:57:30] fight that he said what am I supposed to
[1:57:32] do meanwhile Lord just watch them and
[1:57:34] the Lord said you watch them mberry
[1:57:35] trees right there and when they begin to
[1:57:38] move then you know you're supposed to go
[1:57:40] in the battle so you know what he did
[1:57:41] brother Mark he turned his back to the
[1:57:44] enemy and he quit watching them he quit
[1:57:46] listening to them he on
[1:57:50] qu texting he Fellowship listen I don't
[1:57:54] have time for negative things I some
[1:57:58] trouble or some negativity keep it I
[1:58:00] don't even want to hear it I got my mind
[1:58:03] on something else got on Victory I got
[1:58:07] mind on the pro of God there will be
[1:58:10] somebody who will turn their back to the
[1:58:13] things of the world and say God I'm
[1:58:15] watching you they said watching
[1:58:18] naturally waiting for the Winds of the
[1:58:20] mberry tree to blow because then they
[1:58:23] knew they could move into the
[1:58:28] battle and God has so anointed the
[1:58:31] church all right now amen there are more
[1:58:35] promises yeah there are more blessings
[1:58:39] yes there are more things to
[1:58:42] have but you got to be willing to
[1:58:46] Mo you can't stop
[1:58:53] one take you take somebody first get
[1:58:56] save they get a
[1:58:58] testimony they tell you the testimony
[1:59:01] but it's going to take more than a
[1:59:01] testimony to
[1:59:03] survive true you got to start
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:08] eating somebody testify to you I got to
[1:59:10] heal with certain certain but if you
[1:59:12] quit eating after you get heal then your
[1:59:14] lack of eating is going to be a greater
[1:59:16] problem than the problem you have when
[1:59:17] you
[1:59:18] get so God can heal you you got a
[1:59:20] testimony but you got to eat you got to
[1:59:23] eat the
[1:59:24] word strength so I believe as a brother
[1:59:30] R said like this I believe we have
[1:59:33] untapped resources
[1:59:36] in I believe there's places that we've
[1:59:38] not tapped
[1:59:39] into I believe there is anointings in
[1:59:41] the spoken word that we have just
[1:59:44] touched the iceberg you just touched the
[1:59:47] tip of what God has and the blessing he
[1:59:51] and I'm going to tell you why I say that
[1:59:52] cuz the prophet of God said you are
[1:59:55] unlimited and if you got limits on God
[1:59:58] this morning you got the wrong
[2:00:01] God take the limits off of God and then
[2:00:06] you can take the limits off of yourself
[2:00:09] and realize that if a man can believe it
[2:00:11] anything is possible amen all things are
[2:00:14] possible to them that believe the spoken
[2:00:16] word has just come into existence that's
[2:00:19] right
[2:00:20] amen throughout the entire history of
[2:00:22] the church it's not been with us but in
[2:00:26] the last days here it comes and do you
[2:00:30] think that we should just stop at the
[2:00:31] water well brother man did that back
[2:00:33] there but it's not available
[2:00:36] today I don't think we ought to stop it
[2:00:38] this
[2:00:40] morning I don't think we ought to put up
[2:00:42] ourselves and say this is as far as we
[2:00:44] can go and this is as much as can be
[2:00:47] done I believe that are promises and
[2:00:50] possessions we have not yet
[2:00:52] obtained we must move forward can our
[2:00:54] musicians come hey man I know I I could
[2:00:56] go a while a got good started but you
[2:00:59] but you recognize that we have come to
[2:01:01] that
[2:01:04] place and and on your own I know you're
[2:01:06] going to come into oppositions I know
[2:01:09] that
[2:01:11] already but you have been given
[2:01:14] power to buy yes sir you can literally
[2:01:18] Buy
[2:01:27] me and brother Andrew was talking this
[2:01:29] morning he was pointing out to me that
[2:01:31] preached the Paradox this very
[2:01:34] day back in
[2:01:37] 61 and it's when he talks about he was
[2:01:40] up on the road with a mama and he said
[2:01:43] that Mama was trying to kill him he said
[2:01:45] he couldn't do it cuz God wasn't done
[2:01:47] with him remember he said that youve
[2:01:49] been give power to exercise
[2:01:51] over this and anything Bel that's right
[2:01:55] and brother man to prophesy and he said
[2:01:57] Satan I bind you in the name of the Lord
[2:02:00] that serent serent lost its
[2:02:04] power I believe this morning we have
[2:02:07] been given power to
[2:02:09] life that's true and I believe I believe
[2:02:11] the spoken word can
[2:02:13] bind I believe it can bind the
[2:02:15] situations that the S would put against
[2:02:18] the church against people and when
[2:02:20] you're trying to progress in the word
[2:02:23] and Satan is right there to stop you
[2:02:26] what you just have to do is you have to
[2:02:28] come to this point in your life that you
[2:02:31] have to say to Satan Satan you are a
[2:02:37] liar you have to come to that reality
[2:02:41] that Jesus said Paul said that through
[2:02:44] Christ we can do all
[2:02:47] things and when it come to that point
[2:02:50] you don't have to stop where Satan says
[2:02:54] stop there are things we' not yet
[2:02:58] possessed I
[2:03:01] believe I believe
[2:03:04] this I believe that this is the
[2:03:07] season
[2:03:10] fulfill sorry I have about three
[2:03:15] quotes I believe this is the season I
[2:03:18] want take thank you for coming I want to
[2:03:21] thank you say God bless you love you and
[2:03:24] I'd like to pray for you this morning
