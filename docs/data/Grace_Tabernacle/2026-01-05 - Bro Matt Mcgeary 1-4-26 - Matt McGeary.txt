Why don't you just thank him for his goodness and his mercy for watching out over your life. Go ahead. Oh, he he deserves more than 5 seconds. He deserves more than 10 seconds. Go ahead AND PRAISE HIM. WHERE ELSE ARE you going to praise him? I say if we come to the house of God, WE MIGHT AS WELL PRAISE HIM. WE MIGHT AS WELL WORSHIP HIM. WE WANT TO SAY, "LORD, I LOVE YOU, LORD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE. Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for the message, Lord God. WE WANT TO PRAISE YOU. WE WANT TO WORSHIP YOU. WE WANT TO LIFT YOU UP, LORD. I SAY HE'S present right here amongst us." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be in his presence. My May we just talk to him for a moment, Lord. how we love you, Lord. We thank you for your mercy and your goodness and your grace, Lord. Where would we be if it wasn't for your word, Lord, that come and rescued us out of the muck and the mire of the world, Lord? And you set us up upon a strong rock of revelation, Lord, that heavens and earth will pass away, but your word will never pass away, Lord. We thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for that laying down of your life, Lord. That we could be forgiven, Lord. AND NOT ONLY FORGIVEN BUT WE COULD BE JUSTIFIED LORD THAT WE NEVER DID IT IN the first place. Oh what a worship should come up from our lives. What a worship should come from our mouths Lord of praise and an offering of sacrifice unto you. Lord we just love you and ask that you just come in a supernatural way this morning Lord. We've gathered together not to see man Lord but to see you the same yesterday, today and forever. Lord, and I just surrender myself to you the best way that I know how, Lord, to get out of the way that you can pick up these quotes and these scriptures and you can break the bread of life and feed your sheep as they have need of. Lord, we love you. We pray that you continue to bless our pastor here in this assembly. Lord, may they continue to further the kingdom of God until that last one comes comes in, LORD, AND WE'RE CAUGHT AWAY IN a twinkling of an eye. Lord, we look forward to that great catching away. We love you. We ask these things in your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of Isaiah chapter 60. Just want to thank brother Matt for the invitation and brother Matt and sister Sarah for all the hospitality. We love them and their family. They're they become dear friends of ours and also each one of you. We love you and appreciate you. I say it's it's always awesome when you can come uh uh to a place and just know that you can have your liberty and uh uh uh know that you're you you uh you're well taught and believe the message of the hour. And so if we're quote heavy, well, we'll just be right at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we love the message of the hour, which is Christ the word. And um and we don't want it to just be some some idea or something a far off. But but we you know, I just comes to my mind. Think about that story about that young boy when the lightning was flashing and the storm was going on and and he was crying for his mommy and she'd come up there and say, "You know, Jesus is with you." And he said, "Yeah, but mommy, I wanted I wanted a Jesus with skin on it." And you know, this isn't just some idea or some religion, but but but it's the very person of Jesus Christ. It's the person of the word. And so we we just pray that by God's grace, it'll become a greater reality and a greater revelation to you. Very familiar scripture, especially for the season and the time that we're in. Isaiah chapter 60, it says, "Arise and shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness of the people, but the Lord shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon &gt;&gt; thee." Amen. We ask a blessing upon the reading of the word. You may be seated. Amen. And just to uh for for a moment here to lay a foundation in here um brother Brandon would say in there is a man here that can turn on the light. He says now light well now the seed was already upon the earth. I believe God had planted the seed and just as long as the sun could get to that seed it began to grow. And that's the reason it only taken days to bring forth these things because the seed was already in the earth all it needed was light. And we can certainly see a parallel to our own lives that there was always a predestinated seed that was placed there inside of your life and the only thing it was needing was light. And that's the way God has today. His seed is already here. His word. The only thing it needs is light on it. And he is that light for he is the word. The word and the light is the same thing. The life in there is the light of the word. See is life. The germ of life lays within the grain. And the grain, the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain. That's the way uh that Christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do. Just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do because it is the life that's in it. All life. So life is only by the word of God made manifest. Life comes only by the word of God made manifest. As long as it is just in the book &gt;&gt; like this, it can still be questioned. &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people have questions. &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people question the message and they wonder, is this right or is that right? As long as it's on a book, as long as it's on a tape, it can be questioned. But when it's made manifest, &gt;&gt; then you see the product of what is spoke of being manifested. Then that is light on the word. See, that's what brings the word says so. And then when it come to pass, that is life in light. Light bringing life. Light brings life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you'll just turn in your Bibles to John chapter 8. This is where we'll be just drawing for text as well. We only have one service. So, uh, we'll take our time. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; You know, and and, uh, you know, the same door you came in is still the same one. So, if we get a little long, you know, I this is voluntary, &gt;&gt; right? Right. I mean, no one forced you to come and and we're not going to force you to leave. So, just feel at home. Be be free to come and go. But I pray that God would have his will and his way and something would be said that could help you in your journey. So just uh look at this story here. I'll just take the time to read it. Everybody like reading your Bible &gt;&gt; and in John 8 and1 it says, "And Jesus went under the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them. And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they say unto him, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act." Now, I don't know about you, but all always when I I read the scripture or the message of the hour, I want to I want to see maybe a parallel or somehow that I fit into the story or or something that can relate to me. And we know that we were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity and all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. So, here they're taking this woman and they're saying they caught her in the very act. And you know, according to the law, &gt;&gt; that that's death. She's going to be stoned. &gt;&gt; And so now they're they're bringing this AND THEY SAY, "NOW Moses in the law con commanded us that such should be stoned, &gt;&gt; but what sayest thou?" &gt;&gt; Now think about it &gt;&gt; here. Here here's the word made manifest. &gt;&gt; And now they're they're they're bringing a woman who she's a sinner. She's an adulterer. She's doomed to die. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; She It's over. She's finished. &gt;&gt; And now they're bringing her TO THE VERY WORD HIMSELF AND ASKING HIM, "WHAT DO YOU SAY?" &gt;&gt; This they said, tempting him that they might have to h might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. I like that. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what you need to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just just don't even don't even listen to it. &gt;&gt; He says, "So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." &gt;&gt; And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. &gt;&gt; Don't you wonder what he was writing? &gt;&gt; I don't know what he was writing. &gt;&gt; I mean, what was he was he was he writing her name like he saw it in the lamb's book of life? I don't know. What was he writing? &gt;&gt; And they they and they they which heard it began uh uh uh being convicted by their own conscience and went out one by one. I I imagine if you know if we would do that when we get to talking about one another in the church and trying to condemn one another, &gt;&gt; we ought to ask, you know, who's without sin. &gt;&gt; And beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst. And when Jesus had lifted himself and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,"Woman, where are those thine accusers?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; "Hath no man condemn thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee." &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more. THEN SPAKE JESUS AGAIN unto them, saying, now remember, they've come into the temple, and now this has taken place, and they've brought a woman uh caught in the very act, and now all the accusers have done done gone. He said, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN YOU. GO AND SIT NO MORE. AND NOW HE'S IN THIS TEMPLE, AND HE RAISES UP. And listen to what he says. And and Jesus spake again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of light. AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THIS AS we continue to lay just a foundation in shalom. HE SAYS THAT THAT SON IS the word of God. In the beginning, God said, "Let there be light." And when the manifested word of God, when the word of God was manifested, there was light. First, God spoke it. What if it didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But when he spoke it and then it was manifested, vindicated. His word was a vindicated light come into existence. And that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated. God's written word vindicated then it shows light. It is a it's a portion is lit or put out for each age. And we find in the church ages, we find in the Old Testament church ages, each time there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey, there was a prophet &gt;&gt; came to the earth and the word came to that prophet and he made that word live. And when the word was identified, it reflected God and there was the age, there was the light and that's the way light comes today. Notice how he says it. And that's the way light comes today. SO THE WORD CAME TO THE PROPHET AND THE PROPHET MADE that word live and it was the light for the age. And we're what we're wanting to SPEAK TO YOU ON THIS MORNING IS THAT light brings life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word is light. AND IN JOHN 1:6 AND 7, HE SAYS, "THERE WAS A MAN SENT FROM GOD WHOSE name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of that light that all men through him might believe." So remember WHAT HE'S SAYING. HE SAYS, "THE WORD COMES TO THE PROPHET. THE PROPHET MAKES THAT WORD LIVE IN ITS LIGHT ON THE WORD. And and and JOHN JESUS WOULD SAY IN JOHN 5:35, HE SAYS, "HE WAS A BURNING AND shining light." And you were willing for A SEASON TO REJOICE IN his light. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, forgive me if we're laying a long foundation in here, but brother Brandon would say this LATER IN SHALOM. HE'D SAY JOHN WAS the light. He was more light than Elijah and them had Elijah. He wasn't ELIJAH'S LIGHT, BUT HE WAS ELIJAH in another form, vindicating the light. See, he was. AND WHEN JESUS COME, he said HE WAS A BRIGHT AND shining light for a season, and you love to walk in his light. See? And John SAID, "NOW I MUST DIM OUT. I must go out now. My light's finished shining. I must GO OUT, BUT HE must increase. He's the light." He said, "I am the light of the world." Amen. That's right. The same yesterday, TODAY, AND FOREVER. And he's still the light of the world. And what is he? In the beginning was the word, and the WORD WAS WITH GOD. WHY WAS HE THE LIGHT OF the world? If he'd come and said he was the Messiah and he didn't do like the Bible said that he would do the Messiah would do, then he wasn't THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; SEE, it's the vindicated word that makes it the light of the world. &gt;&gt; So, so we KNOW THAT THE WORD MANIFESTED. WHAT WAS JESUS CHRIST? JESUS CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE CAME be manifested AND HE WAS THE MESSIAH, THE SPOKEN word by all the prophets prophesying there's coming a messiah. He will be the word. And the word WAS MADE FLESH AND THAT WORD DWELT AMONG US. HE WAS THE ANOINTED MESSIAH. AND TO THINK NOW TO THINK THAT ALL THESE PROPHECIES HAD BEEN PROPHESIED. AND THERE WOULD BE ONE TO BRING FORTH THAT MANIFESTATION. THERE'D BE AN ANGEL THAT WOULD COME TO A YOUNG VIRGIN AND SAY, "UH, THOU ART HIGHLY FAVORED AMONG WOMEN." &gt;&gt; WHO, ME? &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm HIGHLY FAVORED. WHAT? WHAT? WH WHY ME? WHY? BECAUSE I'VE CHOSEN YOU. YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE VERY ONE TO BRING FORTH THE PROMISED MESSIAH. NOW, NOW THAT'S A STRIKING WORD. IMAGINE BEING A YOUNG GIRL AND AND SOME A STRANGE THING HAPPENS AND SAYS, "HEY, I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT GOD HAS SENT A MESSAGE AND HE HE'S WANTING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE DESIGNATED FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE VERY ONE THAT GOD WANTS TO FULFILL ALL THE PROMISES OF THE PROPHETS OF OLD." &gt;&gt; And I like how brother Brandon would point out in certain places she what was she doing? She was feeding on that word. And all of a sudden, WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE GOES, "HOW CAN THIS BE?" He said, "The Holy Ghost will overshadow you." &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, PRAISE THE LORD GOD. IT'S NOT LEFT UP TO OUR ABILITIES OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MANUFACTURE OR SOMETHING THAT I can figure out and how much I STUDY THIS AND TIE THAT TOGETHER." NO, WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BY THE HOLY GHOST THAT'S OVERSHADOWING YOUR LIFE THAT'S GOING TO BRING FORTH the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just laying in THIS FOUNDATION IN JOHN 16:7, IT SAYS, "NEVERTHELESS, I TELL YOU the truth." So, uh, what we're what we're seeing here right now, here's the word made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the Messiah. He's opening blind eyes. He's healing the sick. HE'S FULFILLING EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROPHESIED. AND NOW HE HE'S HE'S CALLED OUT THE DISCIPLES AND THEY'RE ALL FOLLOWING HIM. AND AND YOU KNOW, THEIR EXPECTATIONS. They're looking for a kingdom to be restored and to drive out all the ROMANS AND AND THEY HAVE AN intellectual conception of what they think the Messiah is supposed to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Help me PREACH A LITTLE BIT. RIGHT? THEY HAD AN INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION. AND THEY WERE THINKING, "OH, HE'S GOING TO DRIVE OUT ALL THE ROMANS AND HE'S GOING TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM." THEY HAD SOMETHING IN THEIR MIND AND THEY'RE FOLLOWING CHRIST. AND AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THINK ABOUT THIS NOW. IN JOHN 16:7, IT SAYS, "NEVERTHELESS, I TELL YOU THE TRUTH. IS IT EXPEDIENT FOR YOU THAT I GO AWAY? FOR IF I GO NOT AWAY, THE COMFORTER WILL NOT COME UNTO YOU, but if I depart, I WILL SEND THEM UNTO YOU." COULD YOU IMAGINE THE DISCIPLES SITTING THERE AND HIM SAYING, "HEY, IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I GO AWAY." &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S A GOOD THING? WE'VE LEFT OUR WE'VE LEFT OUR HOUSES. WE'VE LEFT EVERYTHING. WE LEFT OUR JOBS AND WE'RE FOLLOWING AFTER YOU. WE LEFT EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S PROFITABLE THAT I GO AWAY. &gt;&gt; HOW COULD I BE PROFITABLE? BECAUSE WHAT HE'S TELLING LIKE, LOOK, YOU YOU SEE THE SAME LIFE, THE SAME LIGHT THAT YOU SEE SHINING OUT THROUGH THIS BODY. THIS BODY IS GOING TO [screaming] GO AWAY. BUT LOOK, I'M WANTING TO SEND THAT SAME LIGHT, THAT SAME LIFE, BECAUSE I NO LONGER WANT TO JUST USE THE CORPORAL BODY, BUT I WANT TO USE YOUR BODY. I WANT MY LIGHT TO NOW BE SHINING OUT THROUGH YOUR [screaming] LIFE. I HAVE A MANY MEMBERED BRIDE BODY THAT I WANT TO EXPRESS MYSELF THROUGH. &gt;&gt; It's better. IT'S PROFITABLE THAT I GO AWAY. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he only has hands as you yield your hands. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He only has a mouth AS YOU YIELD YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR EYES AS YOU YIELD YOUR EYES AND A VOICE AS YOU YIELD YOUR VOICE TO HIM. AND THEN WE BECOME A COMPLETE YIELDED VESSEL. Then the Holy Spirit speaks through us. Brother Brandham in the trial he he he says this. He says, "I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human FLESH IN THE BRIDE'S BODY. Accept his call." I want to tell you, he's calling YOU TO MORE FAITH. HE'S CALLING YOU TO HIGHER HEIGHTS. HE'S CALLING YOU TO DEEPER DEPTHS. HE'S CALLING YOU INTO the the fullness of the revealed WORD OF THE HOUR. HE HE'S COME. WE'VE HEARD THE COUNTDOWN. HE SAID, "THIS IS THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. WE'RE GOING HIGHER. We can believe more. &gt;&gt; We go HIGHER THAN ANY AGE HAS EVER GONE. COME ON. WE'RE NOT JUST HERE JUST TO GET INTO A ROUTINE AND AND JUST GET IN. OH, I GOT MY JOB AND I AND I PUNCH A CLOCK FROM 8 to 5 and I come home and and I take care of the family and I go to church on WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY. AND THAT'S JUST WHAT CHRISTIANS DO. AND YOU'RE JUST IN A IN A ROUTINE AND A GRIND. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE THERE'S SPIRITUAL FOOD THAT'S STORED UP. YOU OUGHT TO BE FEEDING ON THAT MANA. AND I SAY THERE'S REVELATION TO BREAK UNTO YOU. AND WE CAN GO HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER. OH, THERE'S MORE THERE'S GREATER DEPTHS. THERE'S MORE HEIGHTS. OH, YOU CAN SOAR ABOVE ALL THE DARKNESS AND AND ALL THE CALAMITY OF THE AGE. I TELL YOU, IF YOU'LL JUST TAP INTO THE MESSAGE, IT'S AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FOUNTAIN. YOU CAN'T EXHAUST THIS. ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; I I love how what we heard just brother Andrew bringing in the new year. How you know I want to say that this is this is something worth contending for &gt;&gt; and this IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THIS THIS AIN'T JUST TIME TO TO SAY WELL I GOT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR JUST LIKE HE WAS SHOWING HOW YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE A HOUSE OR or or you CAN HAVE SOMETHING BUT BUT IT'S TIME TO move into that thing LIKE HE WAS PREACHING ON. IT'S MOVING READY. I WANT TO TELL YOU THE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S TIME TO MOVE INTO THE PROMISES OF GOD. I SAY WE'RE LIVING SO FAR BEYOND OUR PRIVILEGES AND AND WE LET FEAR AND SITUATIONS BIND US. AND I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU THE TH THOSE SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE ARE JUST OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD AND SAY, "LORD, YOU SAID IN YOUR WORD THAT BY YOUR STRIPES, LORD, YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE ME MY HEART'S DESIRE ACCORDING TO THE WORD." IT AIN'T TIME TO BACK UP. IT AIN'T TIME TO RETREAT. IT AIN'T TIME TO SAY, "OH, MY FAMILY'S A MESS AND THIS IS THAT AND THAT'S THAT AND AND EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG." BUT IT'S TIME TO STAND UP ON THE REVEALED WORD OF THE IR. DEVIL, YOU BACK UP. I GOT A PROMISE. GOD, GIVE ME A MESSAGE. AND THIS IS MY PROMISE. THIS IS MY INHERITANCE. I'LL CLAIM MY FAMILY. I'LL CLAIM MY DAUGHTERS. I'LL CLAIM MY SON. I'LL CLAIM MY HUSBAND, my wife. Whatever it is, I SAY IT'S TIME TO CHARGE. &gt;&gt; It's not time to retreat. &gt;&gt; I say it's worth contending for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Not just half-heartedly, but with all your soul and might. &gt;&gt; Contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints." &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to be smart and educated. You don't have to have an education. You just have to have a willing heart." &gt;&gt; God sends US FAITH DOWN. HIS POWER. Faith is power. And we're to in earnestly contend for it. Look, I want to TELL YOU, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CONTENDING FOR SOME WATERED DOWN, WISHY-WASHY, SPINELESS GOSPEL THAT WHERE YOU JUST, YOU KNOW, WELL, WE WE'RE MESSAGE BELIEVERS AND, you know, everybody else is having their fun and having, but I got to wear a long dress and and I can't listen to worldly music and and you know, and then, you know, they're they're you know, THE PENTECOSTAL SURE, THEY JUMP AND they rejoice and they HAVE A GOOD TIME, BUT YOU KNOW, I'M OVER HERE. I'M JUST STRUGGLING ALONG. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE. YOU'VE HEARD THE WRONG WORD BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE HAS POWER. IT is full of joy. It's full of peace. It's full of salvation. It has everything that you've ever needed. I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MESSAGE IS EVERYTHING THAT I EVER NEEDED. AND IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN I even KNOW THAT IT IS. THIS MESSAGE HAS POWER. IT HAS LIFE. IT HAS VICTORY. IT HAS JOY. &gt;&gt; I SAY IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. IT'S WORTH CONTENDING FOR. IT'S WORTH BELIEVING. I WANT TO SAY THE MESSAGE IS WORTH LIVING FOR AND IT'S WORTH DYING FOR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID IN JOHN 6:63, "IT IS THE SPIRIT THAT QUICKENTH. The flesh profitth NOTHING, BUT THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, they are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to focus ON THIS QUOTE BROTHER BRANDHAM said real uh HE SAYS, "THERE IS NOTHING can give you life but the spoken word of God." &gt;&gt; It's the only way that life can come is through his spoken word. All right. You see YOU SEE THE PATTERN. REMEMBER HE SAYS HE SENDS A PROPHET WITH A WORD FOR A SPECIFIC MANIFESTATION OF THE JOURNEY. WE ARE IN THE PART of the manifestation of the journey OF THE CHANGE OF OUR BODIES IN A RAPTURE. AND GOD HAS SENT A SPOKEN WORD ACCORDING TO A VINDICATED PROPHET TO BE LIGHT UPON THE WORD TO BRING THAT LIFE THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU IN SEED FORM INTO A VINDICATION OF THE REALITY OF WHAT WAS SPOKEN. NOW, THAT MIGHT SOUND GREEK TO YOU, BUT I JUST KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SPOKE. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO DO IT. NEITHER DID Mary know how she was going to do it. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID SHE SAY? BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW MY BODY'S GOING TO BE CHANGED. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO GO A RAPTURE IF WE GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE THROUGH a fire in a IN A SEA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING, ALL I KNOW IS I'M COMING UP. &gt;&gt; I I can't SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE IT. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THE BURN THE BUSH WAS ON FIRE AND IT DIDN'T BURN. I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO ALL THESE THINGS, BUT ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS WITH ALL OF MY HEART, I BELIEVE IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. JUST LIKE ABRAHAM AND SARAH, THEY COULD SAID, "I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT GOD GAVE THE PROMISE." &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Brandham says this in shalom. He says, HE SAID, SEE, GROSS DARKNESS WOULD BE UPON THE PEOPLE, but there would be light. Rise and shine for thy LIGHT HAS COME. HOW CAN THERE BE DARKNESS AND LIGHT? IT'S GOT TO BE SEPARATED. AND THE ONLY ONE THING SEPARATES IT, THE WORD MANIFEST. It separates it. It presses IT TO THE OTHER SIDE. HERE'S THE DARKNESS ON THE EARTH. BUT WHEN THE MANIFESTED word of God, the sun, WHICH IS SPOKEN INTO EXISTENCE BY THE WORD, SHOWS ITSELF, DARKNESS runs to the other side. &gt;&gt; And that's what's taking place now. Darkness separating itself from light. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THE DARKNESS IN YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE SEPARATED OUT FROM YOU. IT'S BY THE SPOKEN WORD OF GOD. GOD HAS SENT A WORD. HE HAS SENT A MESSAGE TO START TO DISCERN THE THOUGHT INTENT OF YOUR HEART AND TO DEAL WITH YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHERE YOU'RE LIVING and what you're going through. AND IT'S LIGHT IN your life. &gt;&gt; TO SEPARATE THE DARKNESS, TO TAKE AWAY THE CONFUSION, TO TAKE AWAY THE CHAOS. &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE JUST MOVING TOWARDS A THOUGHT HERE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS LIGHT AND HOW JESUS WAS the light of the world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But now look at this change here. What Jesus would say in Matthew 5:14, HE SAY, "YE are the light of the world." &gt;&gt; A CITY THAT IS SET ON A HILL CANNOT BE HID. &gt;&gt; Brother Benamin Shalom says says, "WE ARE FROM THE NEW JERUSALEM." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we ought to be that city. &gt;&gt; JOHN SAID, "I SAW THE NEW JERUSALEM COMING DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN LIKE A BRIDE ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND." I SAY WE OUGHT TO BE THAT NEW JERUSALEM. BUT WE OUGHT TO BE THAT CITY OF MOUNT ZION. YOU ARE THE LIGHT TO THE WORLD. AND WHAT IS IT? WHAT DOES LIGHT DO? IT BRINGS &gt;&gt; LIFE. THEN YOU SHINING YOUR LIGHT. WHAT IS IT DOING? HOW IS LIFE GOING TO COME IN YOUR WORK? HOW IS [screaming] LIFE GOING TO COME IN YOUR FAMILY? HOW IS LIFE GOING TO COME AT YOUR JOB? HOW IS LIFE GOING TO COME INTO THIS WORLD? GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU are the light of the world. AND YOU MUST SHINE FORTH THIS GLORIOUS GOSPEL. AND THAT LIGHT SHINES INTO THE DARKNESS. THE DARKNESS COMPREHENDS IT NOT. BUT WHAT IS IT [screaming] DOING? IT'S SEPARATING THE DARKNESS FROM THE LIGHT. AND IF THERE'S A PREDESTINATED SEED OUT OF THERE, THAT LIGHT WILL STRIKE THAT SEED AND BRING FORTH LIFE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; But brother Matthew, there's trouble everywhere. &gt;&gt; I mean, we we GOT OUR OUR PRESIDENTS GOING IN AND AND KIDNAPPING OTHER PRESIDENTS. YOU KNOW, and and all the other nations, they ain't happy about it. AND WE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING THIS AND THAT. Some are sad, some are glad, SOME ARE THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE out there. &gt;&gt; You think staring at a LITTLE PIECE OF PLASTIC IS GIVING YOU THE TRUTH? &gt;&gt; D. &gt;&gt; You think CNN's telling you the truth? &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK FOX NEWS IS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH? COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR TRUSTED SOURCE? &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your breaking news? &gt;&gt; Where are you getting your current events? &gt;&gt; Well, all I know is I got a trusted source right here. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want current events? WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON A TAPE AND HEAR? Good evening, friends. &gt;&gt; That's a trusted source. That's something you can rely upon. That's something that won't steer you the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT THERE THERE'S GROSS DARKNESS UPON THE EARTH AND AND EVERYTHING IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING'S IN SUCH TURMOIL. BUT WHAT DID BROTHER BRANDHAM DO IN HIS RAPTURE MESSAGE? HE TOOK PSALMS 27 AND HE SAID HE SAID, "FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION. IN THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME. HE SHALL SET ME UP UPON A ROCK." LOOK, WHILE THE WORLD IS IN TURMOIL AND EVERYTHING'S GOING ON, GOD IS CALLING YOU BY BY HIS WORD THAT YOU WOULD COME AWAY FROM THE DARKNESS AND COME AWAY FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD AND THAT YOU WOULD CATCH A REVELATION OF HIS WORD. AND WHAT IS REVELATION? IT'S the rock OF REVELATION THAT WE'RE STANDING UPON. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S INTELLECTUAL &gt;&gt; THAT YOU CAN BE TALKED INTO AND TALKED OUT OF. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKED IN TO BELIEVE IN THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; That's true. And you know, and and and it's amazing to me, you know, it's harvest time and and and and people are GOING TO SHOW THEIR COLORS. THEY CAN BELIEVE IT 20, 30 YEARS. AND THEN AND THEN BECAUSE THERE AIN'T some archive from the early 1900s, &gt;&gt; they walk away from the message. Well, I guess nobody died on a bridge because &gt;&gt; they didn't have smartphones. &gt;&gt; You know that THEY THEY THEY I MEAN, SOMETIMES IT TAKES MORE FAITH TO BELIEVE THAT. Like you can't even say like I mean you know it was a really small rural place. I mean could it be that the newspaper editor was on vacation? &gt;&gt; I mean &gt;&gt; I mean is it possible or or is it possible that God allowed it just to be that way &gt;&gt; so people like you would just well I give up. I can't live IT ANYWAYS. WELL YEAH THAT'S OKAY. &gt;&gt; You be you and I'll be me. And God SENT A MESSAGE TO TELL ME WHO I AM AND WHAT I'm supposed to be SO PEOPLE CAN GO ON LIVING AND BEING WHATEVER THEY WANT. LOOK, I ain't MAD AT YOU. YOU WANT TO BE A SINNER, BE A SINNER. YOU WANT TO BE A BAPTIST, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU. WE CAN FELLOWSHIP ABOUT THE GRACE OF GOD. But one thing I know, I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A HIGHER CALLING. I'VE BEEN CALLED TO GO IN A RAPTURE. I'VE BEEN CALLED TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. LOOK, I LOVE YOU. I'LL PRAY FOR YOU, BUT DON'T TRY TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM MY INHERITANCE. I'M GOING TO GO IN AND I'M GOING TO POSSESS THE LAND, AND I AIN'T LEAVING A HOOK BEHIND. PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "WE AIN'T GOT A HALFWAY RELIGION. I AIN'T GOING HALFWAY. I'M GOING ALL THE WAY. AND I'M TAKING MY FAMILY WITH ME. I'M TAKING MY BROTHERS. I'M TAKING MY SISTERS. I'M TAKING THEM ALL." WHY? BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE HAS POWER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T SOME WEAK, WATERED DOWN, WISHYWOSEL GOSPEL. FAITH IS THE POWER. AND FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED TO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S MY INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; And it's a revelation. AND JESUS SAID, "LET YOUR LIGHT SO shine before men &gt;&gt; that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven." Look, look, I LIKE TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. THIS THIS THIS book right here and [screaming] and the message of the hour AIN'T JUST GOING TO WALK OFF THIS PULPIT &gt;&gt; AND GO PREACH AT WALMART. BROTHER. &gt;&gt; THIS THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE BIBLE THE ONLY WAY THAT THE MESSAGE BOOKS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE MESSAGE IS EVER GOING TO GO IN AND PREACH &gt;&gt; or shine the light in Walmart, in your work, in your car, in your marriage, in your life, on your cell phone. Oh, don't go there, Brother Matthew. That's my safe place. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lie from the pits of hell. JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN UH UH DELETE YOUR HISTORY and and YOU CAN GO INCOGNITO. YOU YOU CANNOT BE INCOGNITO FROM GOD. YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING SNEAKY AND GOING AROUND YOUR PARENTS UH UH PERMISSIONS ON YOUR PHONE. &gt;&gt; OH, WELL, it doesn't matter. I don't need permission. My friend got permission. &gt;&gt; You You THINK YOU'RE NO, YOU AIN'T HIDING NOTHING. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T HIDING ANYTHING FROM GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU OUT. &gt;&gt; But what do we want? WE WE NEED THE LIGHT OF GOD'S WORD SHINING OUT THROUGH OUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; IN OUR PERSONAL TIME, IN OUR PRIVATE LIFE, IN OUR HOME, WORK, CAR, LIVE, MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; In the church, &gt;&gt; in the foyer, &gt;&gt; IN THE CAR, &gt;&gt; CUZ WHY? YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. I LOVE THIS QUOTE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "GOD WAS BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN ONE MAN, JESUS CHRIST, BUT NOW HE'S BOTTLED AND CONFINED IN THE whole universal church of the living God." &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT AMAZING THAT GOD IS CONFINED to his body? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, brother brother Matthew, GOD IS CONFINED. YES, GOD CHOSE TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO HIS BODY. GO LOOK AT ALL THE PATTERNS THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE WHEN WHEN LOOK AT PAUL. HERE'S PAUL GOING ON THE ROAD UH UH TO EMMAS AND HE'S STRUCK DOWN BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE blind to THE PILLAR OF FIRE COULD HAVE GAVE HIM HIS CALLING. COULD HAVE COULD HAVE HEALED HIM. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT YOU TO GO ON DOWN TO THE CITY OVER THERE. THERE'S A MAN BY THE NAME OF Ananas and he's going to pray for you &gt;&gt; and you're going to be healed AND YOU'LL RECEIVE YOUR SIGHT." THERE'S A MAN, CORNELIUS. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE HE WAS PRAYING AND SEEKING GOD AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? He was EARNESTLY PRAYING. BUT WHAT DID THE ANGEL STOP? LOOK, LOOK, I, YOU KNOW, I I'M DEALING WITH PETER. PETER'S DOWN OVER HERE IN I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN THERE AND AND PETER'S OVER HERE AND HE'S UP ON THE ROOF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S IN A TRANSFER VISION, YOU KNOW, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SEES, YOU KNOW, THE UH THE NETS COMING DOWN AND AND THE LORD SAYS, "TAKE AND EAT." And he said, "Lord, never I've NEVER EATEN ANY UNCLEAN THING IN MY LIFE." HE SAYS, "WHAT I'VE CALLED CLEAN IS CLEAN. THEREFORE, TAKE and eat." And there all of a SUDDEN THERE'S PEOPLE KNOCKING AT THEIR DOOR SAY, "HEY, is there a Peter HERE?" "YEAH." YEAH. HE GOES, "LOOK, THE ANGEL TOLD ME TO COME GET YOU. WHY? WHY? WHY DIDN'T THE ANGEL THAT WHY DIDN'T HE JUST GIVE HIM THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; He was seeking FOR IT. HE WAS ASKING for it. &gt;&gt; And God was gracious TO ANSWER HIS PRAYER. BUT GOD IS CONFINED TO HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? OKAY. SO THEN WHAT ARE WHAT WHAT AM I TRYING TO SHOW? THAT GOD WANTS TO USE YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMEBODY SICK IN THE CHURCH. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO PRAY FOR THEM? LAY HANDS ON THEM. BELIEVE. THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO WANTS SAVED AT YOUR WORK. IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS IN YOUR MARRIAGE, I WANT TO TELL YOU, GOD IS CONFINED TO HIS BODY AND HE WANTS TO USE EACH ONE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said this in church order in 58. He says, "THE REAL WAY TO TESTIFY IS NOT IN THE CHURCH. It's out in dark places." &gt;&gt; Let your light &gt;&gt; shine where it's dark. &gt;&gt; Wow. Go to the road houses in different places and where sin and thing is heaping and let your light shine. &gt;&gt; There is the place to do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, COME ON YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU ARE NOT TOO YOUNG TO TESTIFY THAT JESUS Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I tell you, WHY DON'T YOU TRY AT one time when you're checking OUT AT A GAS STATION OR AT WALMART, YOU LOOK ACROSS AT THE OTHER PERSON SAY, "YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THAT I love the Lord JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ANYTHING, I CAN PRAY WITH YOU AND I BELIEVE GOD CAN DEAL with your heart. &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY? &gt;&gt; BUT BUT ARE WE SO FEARFUL? ARE WE FOR SHY OR or or do we do we REALLY I WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING THAT KNOWS THAT WORKS, YOU WANT TO SHARE IT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT, IT'S THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD YOU'VE EVER HAD. YOU WANT TO SAY, "OH, HEY, HEY, I I WANT TO TAKE YOU OVER HERE. THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD I EVER I WONDER IF YOU REALLY GOT A REVELATION OF WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS. I REALLY IF YOU GOT THE CURE, IF YOU GOT THE ANSWER, BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU, IF YOU DID, YOU WANT TO SHARE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT IT. YOU SEE SOMEBODY IN A DARK PLACE AND LIVING IN SIN AND THEY GOT NO VICTORY IN THEIR LIFE, YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT SITUATION, SAY, "OH, GOD, I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE THERE, LORD, AND YOU DELIVERED ME." AND YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER MATTHEW, I never went OUT INTO THE WORLD." I PRAISE GOD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD. BUT ONE THING I WANT TO TELL YOU DO, YOU GOT TO MEET THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE. YOU GOT TO MEET THE SAME LOGOS, AND WE WERE ALL BORN IN SIN AND SHAPED IN INIQUITY. YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME BAPTISM HOLY GHOST EXPERIENCE. YOU CAN BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT IN A TWINKLING OF NIGHT. DON'T LET THESE LYING PREACHERS OUT THERE TRY TO TELL YOU YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN FOR. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO BE CHANGED. OH, WE ARE ALL SINNERS. WE'VE ALL COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GROWN UP ON THE CHURCH PEW ALL YOUR LIFE. YOU NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN. YOU NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE GOT NONSENSE GOING AROUND NOWADAYS. THERE is a real power. There is a real change. There's real victory. There's real freedom. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW 5:13, "YE ARE THE SALT of the earth, sir. &gt;&gt; But if the salt has lost its savor, &gt;&gt; other says, if it's lost its testimony, &gt;&gt; it can't cure. &gt;&gt; It can't be effective." Now, I know we're just laying in some some simple uh uh uh uh uh things here this morning and and but I'm MY HEART'S DESIRE IS I WANT US WE'RE GOING INTO a new year and and and look, we all have our lives and our families and and OUR CHALLENGES AND OUR TRIALS. Uh but you know what? You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And light brings life. Light separates the darkness. There there's a power THAT IS INSIDE OF YOU to bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Another man said, "Let our lives be so salty that others can watch the way we act and live that they'll want to live that way, too." &gt;&gt; Remember, he said, "AS LONG AS IT'S IN A BOOK, IT CAN BE QUESTIONED." &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people question if he's a healer. A LOT OF PEOPLE PEOPLE QUESTION THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S REALLY WHAT IT SAYS. A LOT OF PEOPLE QUESTION. YOU CAN QUESTION ALL YOU WANT, BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION. I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND. &gt;&gt; I once was blind, but now I SEE. THERE IS NO QUESTIONS THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS THE LIGHT UPON GOD'S WORD THAT I MIGHT SEE. THERE'S THINGS IN THE BIBLE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT. BUT GOD SENT A WORD BY A PROPHET THAT WAS LIGHT ON THE WORD FOR THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY. LOOK, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING TO ESCAPE THE JUDGMENT, AND THAT'S BECAUSE GOD HAS SENT A VINDICATED WORD BY MALACHI 4:5 AND LUKE 17:30 and Revelations 10 1-7. IT'S GOD'S PROVIDED WAY IN THE EVENING TIME. IT'S GOD'S LIGHT UPON THE WORD, AND LIGHT BRINGS LIFE. AND NOW THAT LIFE IS TO BE IN YOU, SHINING OUT INTO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Oh, but when that word starts to become alive in you, It's light &gt;&gt; and it's life. &gt;&gt; And now you can go into the highways. You can go into the byways. You can go into your church situation or into your work situation. You can look upon the needs of the others and then you can you can BE UH THE HOLY GHOST IN the situation. &gt;&gt; Lord, how do you want to lead me? What should I SAY? YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT TAKES UH UH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOLY GHOST TO NOT GET INVOLVED. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I would tell you, if we would be MORE SENSITIVE TO THE HOLY SPIRIT, we probably would get less involved in things. &gt;&gt; Look, there's problems everywhere. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE WE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO FIX IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it MIGHT NOT BE THE TIME OR THE PLACE OR the season, &gt;&gt; AND SO MANY TIMES WE LET OUR RIGHTEOUS IGNATION GET WORKED UP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST GOT TO GO SAY SOMETHING. I GOT TO DO THIS. JUST HOLD your peace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch. Be in prayer. &gt;&gt; Wait for the time. Wait for the opportunity. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I found out a LOT OF TIMES WHEN WHEN I'VE OH, and it'll work on you. I just got, you know, I know I can't this. Something's got to be said. SO, BROTHER MATT, THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T go on like this. It's not right. &gt;&gt; It ain't right. They should They can't be doing that. I got to fix this. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say something. And he say, "You know what? I just let me just Lord, help me to be patient. May I look for the opportunity, Lord, and I'll know." And all of a sudden you'll be over THERE TALKING AND SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN AND ALL A SUDDEN you you'll you'll hear something and and and brother Matt come you know I I just you might not know it but I went over to their house last night when and this happened and that happened and you like oh my goodness I would have caused a big mess and a lot of a lot of times if WE'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU AND WANTING TO DO GOOD LOOK WE GOT A WHOLE service on it trying to do uh God a service without it being his will. &gt;&gt; I don't know why we're here. We're here &gt;&gt; BUT WE GOT TO GET INTO PRAYER. WE WE WE WE WE GOT TO WE GOT TO KNOW THAT YES, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I AM THE SOLUTION. I LIKE I TELL PEOPLE IF YOU GOT IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A PROBLEM, YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A SITU, SOMEBODY GOT TO BE GOD IN THE EQUATION. &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE GOD in the situation. Well, man, if they were a message believer, if they're A CHRISTIAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; MAYBE THEY'RE NOT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WE WE WE WANT TO WE WANT TO HOLD EVERYBODY ELSE RESPONSIBLE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE A message believer. And if they really believe the message, they got an office. THEY LEAVE. THEY DO THIS AND THAT. IF THEY WERE REALLY A MESS, WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT THE TEST IS TO SEE WHAT YOU DO IN THE TRIAL. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REACT TO IT? How are you GOING TO TREAT YOUR BROTHER? I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY MADE YOU MAD AND UPSET. YOU THINK THEY CHEATED AND YOU STOLE. What do you do? SAY, "LORD, I STILL LOVE THEM BECAUSE WHY LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE of sin, but we want everybody else TO BE THE CHRISTIAN. WE WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE THE MESSAGE BELIEVER AND OH, THEY DID THIS ME wrong and they did that wrong." And I tell IF THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS, THEN I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE. I SAY THAT AIN'T NOT THE WAY to be. SAY, LORD JESUS, I NEED MORE GRACE AND MORE MERCY. LORD, HELP ME TO LOVE THEM MORE. HELP ME TO PRAY FOR THEM MORE. MAY MAY I BE A SUPPORT TO THEM. MAY I STILL BE THEIR FRIEND. LORD, YOU SAID LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SIN. I TELL YOU, THE BODY OUGHT TO BE JOINING TOGETHER. IT'S A UNITING TIME. THE WORLD'S UNITING OUT THERE AND ALL THE MOVEMENTS ARE UNITING OUT THERE. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THIS BRIDE SHOULD BE UNITING AROUND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THERE OUGHT TO BE SUCH A LOVE, A CAPSTONE OF LOVE SETTLING DOWN UPON THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST THAT WE CAN LOOK BEYOND OUR FAULTS. WE CAN LOOK BEYOND OUR FAILURES. WE CAN LOVE ONE ANOTHER. WE CAN PULL OURSELVES CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER AND WE CAN BE CHRIST, THE LIGHT SHINING INTO THE SITUATION. &gt;&gt; God's confined to his body. You are God's agent. &gt;&gt; THE REAL WAY TO TESTIFY IS WHAT? GOING OUT INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS. OH, we we we IF WE'VE LOST OUR TESTIMONY, HE SAID IT CAN'T CURE, IT CAN'T BE EFFECTIVE, WE want to be salty because as long as we're we're just going by intellect and intellectual faith, that could always be questioned, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I want to say if you're in that condition this morning, I want to TELL YOU THERE'S A there's an experience here for you. &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST JUST AN EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH CYCLES OF REVIVAL AND DEATH, BUT A true born again EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE BAPTIZED AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND THERE'S no more question. IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF THIS TIME I WAS IN LOUISIANA CAMP AND OH MY the pre the Holy Spirit was just moving. You you could you could see it WAVES JUST GO GOING THROUGH THE YOUNG PEOPLE ALMOST YOU IT would just a move upon them and the the BLESSINGS THEY START UH CRYING OUT AND PRAISING GOD AND AND IT JUST WOULD SWEEP ALONG THIS WAY AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY WATCH IT COME BY AND I'LL NEVER FORGET WE WERE PRAYING WITH SOME YOUNG PEOPLE AND OH THE PRESENCE OF GOD HIT US AND OH MY IT WAS JUST SUCH A WONDERFUL THING AND ALL A SUDDEN SOME BOY THREW UP HIS HANDS. HE SAID, HE SAID, "HALLELUJAH. PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. It's really, really real." OH, I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IF IT'S JUST been a story that your your parents believe and they BELIEVE THE MESSAGE AND YOU'VE HEARD A STORY ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S A POWER HERE TO SHINE INTO YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU CAN LIFT UP YOUR HANDS AND YOU CAN SAY, "OH, PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S NOT A STORY ANYMORE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY REAL. I AM FREE. I AM DELIVERED. I AM FORGIVEN. I DO LOVE GOD AND HE LOVES ME AND I AM FREE. YOU CAN BE SET FREE FROM THIS MORNING, FROM YOUR BONDAGE, FROM YOUR SIN, FROM YOUR SITUATION. THE LIGHT IS HERE TO SHINE INTO YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT JUST A STORY. WHEN that happens, oh my. &gt;&gt; Everybody else can question it, but you know, &gt;&gt; you can sing that song, you should have been there. &gt;&gt; You can say all you want, but I was there. I GOT A TESTIMONY. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling okay? &gt;&gt; We just keep moving on a little bit. &gt;&gt; IN 1 JOHN 15 AND 6, WE WE WE know that when we say the message of the hour and we we speak of the message, we know that it is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand that God sent a word through a prophet. &gt;&gt; But that word in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word is God. &gt;&gt; And that word that was brought to us is none other than the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So when we say the message, it's not a hope so. It's not a think so. It's not a well I think it is. No, THERE'S A REVELATION THAT I KNOW THAT THIS IS CHRIST. AND IN 1 JOHN 1:5 IT SAYS, "THEN THIS is the message which we have heard from of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all." [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, contrary to popular opinion, there's no darkness and there's no error in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in your mind and you and and your ability to do spiritual math, you might come to a place well you know uh uh brother Brandham said this and this was that and everything. We you got to get beyond your carnal thinking. You got to get beyond reasoning and doubt. And of course people go one way and they try to make every word thus sayeth the Lord and then they try to make him a god and THEY I MEAN YEAH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THAT YOU'RE GONNA have all that fallacy out there. But if we keep it as simple and understand that that this is the word of God to you and in the word there is no darkness. &gt;&gt; And if we say we HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM AND WALK in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, "IF YOU DON'T HAVE WORKS WITH YOUR FAITH, IT SHOWS YOU haven't got faith. You're just talking from your mouth." &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. I'll settle in here somewhere. It's all right. &gt;&gt; He says, "IF YOU DON'T HAVE WORKS WITH YOUR FAITH, IT SHOWS YOU HAVEN'T GOT FAITH. YOU'RE JUST TALKING FROM YOUR MOUTH." &gt;&gt; WELL, that that that's that's that's good old uh uh trash talking of where I come from. &gt;&gt; You know, you get in the schoolyard or you're somewhere and somebody's running their mouth AND BE LIKE, "YOU'RE ALL TALK. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST RUNNING YOUR MOUTH." AND IT SAYS, "WHY WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS?" AMEN. &gt;&gt; OKAY. YOU SAY YOU'RE A BELIEVER, WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS LIKE, BUT WHAT DOES THE PROPHECIES TELL YOU? LOOK, YOU SAY YOU BELIEVE IT, BUT IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO WORKS WITH YOUR FAITH, YOU'RE JUST TALKING FROM YOUR MOUTH. LOOK, THAT THAT OUGHT TO BURN and that ought to scold AND THAT OUGHT TO STEP ON SOME TOES. WE AIN'T GOT TO GET HIGH AND LIFTED UP. WELL, WE NEED TO SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING TO HUMBLE MYSELF TO THE WORD. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TALKING. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PROFESSING, LORD, BUT WHERE IS THE WORKS OF MY FAITH, LORD? MAYBE I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING FROM MY MOUTH. BUT OH GOD, I WANT TO CONFESS IT BY FAITH. LORD, I KNOW YOU'RE THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. FORGIVE ME, LORD. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE A TRASH TALKER. I WANT TO BE A LIVER OF THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; That way, WHEN THE DEVIL SHOWS UP, YOU CAN SAY, "BOO, DEVIL." &gt;&gt; NOT, "Oh my, what am I going to do? I better call the pastor. &gt;&gt; Pastor, fix my problems. Fix my marriage." &gt;&gt; You just need the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, on the DAY OF PENTECOST WHEN THEY BUSTED OUT OF THE UPPER ROOM, THEY DIDN'T RUN TO THEIR PASTOR FOR COUNSELING. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm sorry, brother Matt. YOU FORGIVE ME. I UNDERSTAND WE WE NEED COUNSELING. UH, AND SOMETIMES THERE'S SOME HARD SITUATIONS AND GOD HAS ORDAINED A PASTOR TO TO LEAD YOU AND GUIDE YOU AND AND TO HELP IN SITUATIONS. BUT, BUT I I COULD BE WRONG, BUT IF I WAS TO THROW PERCENTAGES out there, I'd say 95% of what he has TO COUNSEL DOESN'T NEED COUNSELING. YOU JUST NEED THE HOLY GHOST. Maybe I can speak for my home about my home church back home. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT IS THE HOLY GHOST? IT LEADS YOU AND GUIDES YOU INTO ALL TRUTH AND ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS. YOU HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE THE COMFORTER, THE GREATEST COUNSELOR OF ALL TIME. &gt;&gt; BUT SO SO MANY TIMES WE'RE SO DEPENDENT UPON MAN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD'S GOD'S AGE. I'M NOT TRYING TO TRYING TO CONFUSE ANYBODY HERE. BUT YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? GOD WANTS TO USE YOU IN your situation, IN YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING IN YOUR MARRIAGE. I TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. GET ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY WITH YOUR WIFE &gt;&gt; and say, "HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE ATMOSPHERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN RIGHT HERE IN THE HOME. SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT. I FEEL A LITTLE FRUSTRATED and and and I FEEL LIKE THE KIDS ARE UNSETTLED. HONEY, YOU KNOW, WE GOT A DIVINE PROMISE. LET'S GET ON OUR KNEES AND LET'S APPLY THE TOKEN TO OUR HOME." AND I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU DO ALL THAT, if you get TOGETHER WITH YOUR WIFE AND YOU GET TOGETHER WITH THE KIDS AND YOU PRAY AND YOU APPLY THE TOKEN AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING YOUR BIBLE AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE hour &gt;&gt; and YOU'RE WAITING ON THE LORD AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN THROUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT? GO TO YOUR PASTOR AND THE PASTOR START TALKING TO YOU A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAVE YOU PRAYED WITH YOUR WIFE?" "NO." "NO." "OKAY, I mean, have you been reading your Bible?" Well, not not like I should. All right. I haven't seen you in church for a month. Yeah. I've been laying out. It's like, AND YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT THE PROBLEM IS &gt;&gt; and how to fix it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START READING YOUR BIBLE? &gt;&gt; START PRAYING. &gt;&gt; START LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; GET IN DESPERATION. &gt;&gt; SAY, "LORD GOD, I NEED YOU MORE THAN I'VE EVER NEEDED BEFORE. HONEY, COME HERE. LORD, HONEY, YOU FORGIVE ME. I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN. COME ON. SOME OF US NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT WITH OUR WIVES. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR CELL PHONES and you've been looking at THINGS YOU AND YOU WONDER WHY THE SPIRIT OF GOD AIN'T MOVING IN YOUR LIFE. YOU WONDER WHY YOUR WIFE IS ALL FRUSTRATED BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY on your phone. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry, CHURCH. I'M TRYING TO GO ON A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO GO HOME. AND WE LET THE DEVIL BIND US WITH TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THINGS OF OUR OWN. AND WE WONDER WHY OUR MARRIAGE IS A WRECK. WE WONDER WHY OUR HOUSE IS A WRECK. WE WONDER WHY OUR CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH A HIGH HARD TIME WHEN YOU'RE LETTING THEM WATCH ENTERTAINMENT, MOVIES, AND ALL THIS STUFF CONTROLLING THE ATMOSPHERE [screaming] IN YOUR HOME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; MAYBE WE'RE JUST TALKING FROM OUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; YOU FORGIVE ME. I I DON'T MEAN TO COME COME LIKE THIS, BUT I LET ME PREACH TO MYSELF A LITTLE BIT. I I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS CALLED ME TO HIGHER HEIGHTS AND DEEPER DEPTHS THAT I CAN POSSESS THIS VESSEL AND SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR THAT THERE'S A REAL POWER AND A HOLY GHOST THAT CAN CONTROL MY HOME AND THERE CAN BE A REAL ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE AND LIBERTY OF THE HOLY GHOST IN MY ROOM, IN MY CAR, IN MY HOUSE, IN MY FAMILY, IN MY MARRIAGE. AND THEN YOU BRING THAT TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Now we going to have church. COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHEN SEE THE PROBLEM IS IS WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE DEFENSIVE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ALWAYS OH MY GOODNESS. OH MY GOODNESS. THE DEVIL'S COMING AT ME OVER HERE AND HE'S COMING OVER HERE. AND OH, BROTHER MATT, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M I'M I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE. I'M GOING TO BE I'M I'M going to get the victory. &gt;&gt; WE'RE REALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CALLED TO TAKE the message OF THE HOUR. AND STAND BEHIND THAT WORD AS YOUR PROTECTION AND MARCH FORWARD. &gt;&gt; SATAN, get out of my way. &gt;&gt; I'm going in a rapture. I'M GOING IN A PROMISED LAND. YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY BOY, I'M TAKING HIM BACK. YOU TRIED TO BREAK UP MY MARRIAGE. I'M GETTING IT BACK. LORD, THIS IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION. I'M TAKING MY WIFE. I'M TAKING MY HUSBAND. I'M TAKING MY FAMILY. I'M TAKING MY DAUGHTER. I WILL NOT BACK UP. I WILL NOT SIT DOWN. I'M GOING TO MARCH ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIER, UNTIL EVERY PROMISE OF GOD IS MINE. AND IT'S YAY AND AMEN. BOO, DEVIL, BACK UP. THIS MESSAGE IS MINE. IT'S THE LIGHT OF GOD'S WORD SHINING INTO MY LIFE AND IN MY MARRIAGE, INTO MY CHURCH, INTO MY HOME, AND IN MY SITUATION, AND LIGHT BRINGS LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME WE GO ON THE OFFENSE OF CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO START FIGHTING FOR OUR BROTHERS, [screaming] FIGHTING FOR OUR PASTOR. FIGHTING FOR OUR LOVED ONES. &gt;&gt; It's like It's like we got called on. &gt;&gt; Well, I better go pray. Don't call me Please don't call me to open the service in prayer. I haven't even prayed at home yet. Dear Lord, uh [sighs] you can tell I hadn't done this in a while. And uh, &gt;&gt; hey, it's all right. I'm talking where we're living. &gt;&gt; Come on. We we we got to get over this facade. &gt;&gt; You know, we're all these perfect angels fluttering around. &gt;&gt; We got some real life situations and some real problems. And I said, what we really need to be is honest with ourselves. &gt;&gt; And maybe we're hide hiding behind a fig leaf of the message. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, that's blasph. No, &gt;&gt; no. You you can take the message of the hour. And it could just be a fig leaf religion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just do enough to get by that nobody knows. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Isaiah 4. You know, uh they they they said, "Oh, you know, let us eat our own bread. Let us wear our own apparel." Only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach. Some people just want to claim the message to take away their reproach. &gt;&gt; I want to live it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Lord, if I if I got to separate from friends, if I got to separate from family, if I got TO GO HERE, LORD, I JUST WANT TO BE PLEASING to you, Lord. If there's something in MY LIFE THAT I'M DOING THAT, LORD, I WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY from me. Lord, deal with my heart. LORD, BRING CONVICTION. LORD, I I WANT TO GIVE IT UP. I I DON'T WANT TO BE PULLED HERE and there and let the things of the WORLD ALWAYS DOMINATE MY TIME. AND MAYBE YOU'RE ADDICTED TO YOUR PHONE AND you just can't get the victory over it. I SAY, "WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE IT UP?" SAY, "LORD, forgive me for that. I WANT TO FIND MYSELF IN PRAYER MORE. I WANT TO BECOME A LOVER OF YOUR WORD and a lover of the message of the hour. Lord, I WANT TO BE IN PRAYER FOR THE MINISTRY AND FOR MY PASTOR. I I WANT TO APPLY THE THE THE THE token at my home. I want there to be such AN ATMOSPHERE, LORD, THAT IN MY HOUSE AND IN MY CAR THAT WHEN I COME TO CHURCH, I CAN BE PART OF THE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Then I'll tell YOU WHAT, WE START GETTING IN ONE MIND AND one accord &gt;&gt; because you know an attitude, a wrong attitude can hinder the move of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? Brother B said, "I long for the days OF ANANAS AND SAFIRE WHEN SIN WOULD BE CALLED OUT AT THE DOOR." I I BELIEVE WE'RE RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; The word is still a discerner of the thoughts AND INTENTS OF THE HEART WILL CALL YOU OUT WITH WHERE YOU'RE LIVING. AND YOU WONDER WHY THE SPIRIT AIN'T MOVING. YOU WONDER WHY THE PREACHER'S HAVING A HARD TIME. YOU WONDER WHY THE SONG LEADER'S HAVING A HARD TIME. I WONDER IF WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM. AND SOME OF US, WE JUST NEED TO SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE ME. I NEED TO GET IN GEAR. IT'S TIME TO GO IN A RAPTURE." &gt;&gt; LOOK, WE'RE NOT GUARANTEED TOMORROW. BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; WE WE'VE JUST STEPPED INTO 2026. WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT ALL THE WAY. WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT TILL [screaming] MONDAY. I I HEARD UH PRAISE GOD THERE WAS A YOUNG BOY WHO WAS JUST IN AN ACCIDENT. PRAISE GOD. AND GOD SPARED HIS LIFE. THAT'S THE GRACE OF GOD. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALL SHE WROTE RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; And it could be any of you. &gt;&gt; But I want to TELL YOU THIS. PRAISE GOD. WE HAVE A REST. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN ASSURANCE. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT COMES OR WHAT GOES. WHETHER WHETHER WHETHER OUR TIME ON THIS STRAND IS JUST A FEW YEARS OR IT'S A LONG YEARS. That's not where I come from. &gt;&gt; I came from God and I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; What's important is that you shine your light &gt;&gt; in your allotted time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if your light ain't shining, I say let's get sincere this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's say, Lord, you said that ye are the light of the world, and it's the very light in me that's shining out that brings life. Everybody feeling okay? &gt;&gt; All right. Maybe we'll start preaching here pretty quick. &gt;&gt; I want to I I I want to be a doer of the word, not just a hearer only. &gt;&gt; You You might be able to fool men, but you're not going to fool God. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus would say in Matthew 15:18. He said, "People draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." What is it? It's a heart problem. And if you start to catch a revelation, that's why God had to send a prophet. &gt;&gt; Scripture says the heart is is deceitful above all things. And and if it wasn't for this word to come and start to deal with your heart and to show you the air of religion and and intellectual faith and all these things, we would BE CAUGHT THAT WE'D BE HONORING GOD WITH OUR LIPS, BUT BUT WE WOULD HAVE A HEART THAT HADN'T BEEN TURNED. &gt;&gt; But it's the very light of God's word that's turning the heart that's changing you. That there we're not like THOSE WHO ARE JUST honoring the Lord with their lips, quoting the quotes. We got a lot of people doing it, right? &gt;&gt; They quote the quote. They quote the message. THEY GO TO CHURCH. BUT WHERE'S the life? Where's the good works? Where's the fruit OF THE SPIRIT? WHERE'S THE LIGHT? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BY THIS YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEY ARE MY DISCIPLES by your love one for another." &gt;&gt; NOT BY OUR BACKBITING, OUR GOSSIPING our traditions, &gt;&gt; but if we have love one for another. &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? You You can have everything else, but if you don't have love, we'll just try to start moving towards a close. Jesus said, 'You know them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; He said this, and why are people so tossed about? A wonderful message for the new year. He preached this in 56 January 1st. He said, "Many people go to service and rejoice and shout and praise the Lord while the spirit of God is falling. All condemnation left their heart, and as soon as a day or two after the revival, they find themselves back in that old grind again. Yet they were eating mana. &gt;&gt; Is Is that Is that what it is? &gt;&gt; It's just camp to camp, service to service. We rejoice. We praise God. But then the home life's no different. I know we might be hitting this over and over and over, but friends, I I needed a simple gospel. &gt;&gt; This isn't some puffed up stuffed shirt religion where we walk around like we know something, but it's something to get down home where you're living. right &gt;&gt; into the trenches of your life, &gt;&gt; into your kitchen, &gt;&gt; INTO YOUR BEDROOM, INTO YOUR CAR, &gt;&gt; into your workspace, and start TO DEAL WITH YOUR heart and with where you're living that when you GO BACK, IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME. I I'm I I I friends, I'm realizing more and more and more, the prophet said it's it's it's it's very few. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's very few. And I say it behooves us each individual to work out your salvation with fear and trembling &gt;&gt; that you haven't accepted some some some intellectual faith and start examining your life. But brother Brandham says in one place we'll just look what Jesus did and look what you do and then compare yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes a prophet could tighten IT DOWN SO TIGHT YOU'RE LIKE MAN I AIN'T got a hope. But I say this if you're a predestinated SEED OF GOD IT'LL produce a hunger and a thirst in your heart. Say, Lord, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Lord, you said those that hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be filled because it has to be more than routine. It has to be more than just going to church. It has TO BE MORE THAN UH UH THAN JUST YOUR GOOD WORKS. IT HAS TO BE A HIDDEN LIFE. SO, just moving on, Brother Brandham says in shalom, the world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in. And yet, it's standing again in the most blessed light that ever did shine. The difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We have a word that's moving upon your life and saying, "Let there be light." And God separated the light from the darkness. And I believe that we are now living in that hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that light might be made manifest. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to have an open heart this morning? &gt;&gt; Just let the spirit of God start to move upon your heart and upon your life. And this word starts to what? Separate the darkness from the light. You start to look in and say, ' Lord, maybe I ain't been living quite right. Maybe I I I haven't been doing the things that I should be doing. John, 1 John 1:7 says, "But if you walk in the light as he IS IN THE LIGHT, WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin." &gt;&gt; I just want to end right along these lines here. Just be a few more moments. In our text in John 8:12, Jesus said, "I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; You You look at this woman here in her condition and this this hopeless case, she's doomed to die. But but I I love what what what took place here because here now the law is taking a sinner and presenting them before the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But see that that word, WHAT WAS IT? HE WAS THE light &gt;&gt; and he HE SHINED INTO THAT situation and all the accusers went away AND HE SAID, "LOOK, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE. GO AND SIN NO MORE." YOU YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WORD THAT GOD HAS SENT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF GOD WANTING to shine into your life. &gt;&gt; Not to condemn you. &gt;&gt; Not to give us a bunch of rules AND REGULATIONS AND YOU GOT TO DO THIS AND YOU GOT TO DO THAT, BUT IT'S A LIBERTY TO SET YOU FREE. AND IF YOU'LL JUST ALLOW THE WORD OF GOD TO START TO SHINE INTO YOUR LIFE, it'll bring you OUT OF THE DARKNESS. IT'LL BRING YOU OUT OF THE CONFUSION. IT'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. IT'LL FIX YOUR MARRIAGE. IT'LL HEAL YOUR BODY. IT'LL BRING SALVATION. IT'LL BRING DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; It'll start TO SHINE INTO YOUR SITUATION AND BRING THE RESULTS OR THE REALITY OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, LOOK at this this girl. SHE YOU CAN'T GET IT ANY WORSE. THEY'RE READY TO TAKE UP ROCKS AND STONE HER. &gt;&gt; And maybe maybe where you're at right now, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE YOU WE'VE COME INTO THE NEW year and and WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE AT, YOU'RE LIKE, MAN, THIS I I WAS LOOKING FORWARD to a new year and I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHANGE AND THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT. IT DIDN'T TAKE JANUARY ONE, BUT A TRIAL RIGHT OFF THE BAT. NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE. NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. I TRIED. I CALLED ON the Lord. and you JUST YOU JUST SEE, OH MY GOODNESS, HERE IT IS ONCE AGAIN. But I want to say that the word of God is here right now. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just go ahead and surrender &gt;&gt; your problem, &gt;&gt; surrender your life, &gt;&gt; your marriage, &gt;&gt; your bondage, WHATEVER IT IS. LOOK, YOU MIGHT BE STRUGGLING to to to to to to believe and and to live the message. You might be struggling with clipping your hair, burning, clipping it. I don't care what you do. break it, make it shorter, whatever you do TO MAKE IT SHORT. YOU MIGHT BE STRUGG WITH THOSE THINGS. LOOK, IF IT'S JUST LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHAT I'M INVITING YOU TO IS IS A SURRENDER to the message, to the word OF THE HOUR TO SHINE INTO YOUR HEART. AND I WANT TO ASK YOU, DO YOU REALLY want to love Jesus? Do you really WANT TO SERVE GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART? THEN GOD HAS SENT A WORD TO SHINE INTO YOUR HEART TO MAKE THAT A REALITY. NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MUSTER UP AND SOMETHING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I'M good for one week and THEN THE NEXT WEEK I FALL APART. BACK TO THEIR REGULAR GRIND. I'm just going to invite the musicians to come. We'll find a place to settle down. &gt;&gt; But we wanna we want to be delivered. &gt;&gt; We want to be set free. We want to come to the place where now this word isn't tabernacling in my life &gt;&gt; and I'm no longer on the defensive, &gt;&gt; but I can go to my brothers and sisters and now I can be light that brings life in their life. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to to bring this morning. Brother Brandham said, "I've come to the spot, I believe, that people don't know what they're doing. IT COMES TO A TIME WHERE THE HUMAN being has looks like becomes such a subject of evil until it's a pathetic thing. IT SEEMS LIKE A SHADOW OF DARKNESS JUST OVER the people and it presses them. What is it doing? Look at the people. They they're pressing pressed to empty substitutes and a and drugs and alcohol. PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR MIND, TAKING THE LIFE UH UH SUICIDES ON A ON A RAMPAGE. WHY ARE THEY DOING ALL THESE THINGS? BECAUSE WHAT? THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT WE [screaming] HAVE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, COULD I BE THE ONE? COULD I BE THE DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S life that I can go, Lord, AND I CAN TAKE THIS MESSAGE of the hour, not just a book, not just a quote, BUT THE WORD IN ME, &gt;&gt; a living reality, and I can go to SOMEBODY AND I CAN start to share with them the message of the hour. Not from some intellectual standpoint that God sent a prophet, but that the word has become alive in me. And you can look into some situation and say, "You know what? I know what it's like. Let me tell you what God did for me. I went through this trial and I lost a loved one and I I went through this and and as as tragic, I said, "But you know what? He was always there." &gt;&gt; Amen. And God knows how to to take your life. And he says in Romans 8, he says, "All things work together for good to them who are called according to the Lord." And you REALIZE THAT GOD CAN TAKE A LIFE AND YOU CAN START SHINING into other people's lives [music] and to other situations. And you start to look upon the need at your workplace or or at the store or or in your home or in the church. Maybe you see somebody, they don't get a lot of fellowship. YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO INVITE THEM OVER. I I want to be light to them. He says it's come to a a place where it just seems like a shadow of darkness just over the people. But Colossians 3:4 says, "When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." &gt;&gt; Where is he appearing? Just like that woman in John 8. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? Oh, I'm dead. I've done it for the last time. This is it. But all of a sudden, who was she standing before? Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "I don't condemn you. Not only do I not condemn you, you're forgiven. &gt;&gt; Not only you're forgiven, you're justified. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE STANDING PERFECT." That's what the message come to do. It come to set you free from your past. &gt;&gt; Come to set you free from all your hurt &gt;&gt; and all your bondage &gt;&gt; that you can walk in newness of life. Let's all just stand. Brother Bandham says, "Then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah, then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was, we become Messiah. Little lights. That's what the church is supposed to be. Lights, little anointed ones. That's God's church." Let's just pray. Lord Jesus. Lord, we just come to this portion in the service, Lord. Maybe just a more a little bit more sobriety, Lord, just to check up in our lives as we're coming into a new year. Lord, we we want to be that light to shine into the darkness. Lord, you said we are the light of the world. Lord, uh we want to be a city that's set on a hill, Lord, that others might see our good works and glorify our father which is in heaven. Lord, you know the hearts of your people and what they're going through and their situations. Lord, you maybe know the the struggle in their marriage or Father, maybe they're struggling with sanctification. But Lord, I know that you're present here right now, Lord. That if we could just surrender to you and ask, Lord, that you forgive us of our sins, Lord, that we can just repent. Lord, you're right here to fill us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to take away the shame and the guilt. Lord, your word says there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. You said, "Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin." Lord, what a message we've received, Lord, for your word shines into the darkness, Lord. It starts to separate the darkness out of our life, Lord. And it gives us the hope. It gives us the faith to know, Lord, that just as the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary. You'll overshadow our lives, Lord. And you'll bring forth this word into manifestation, Lord. Not by our ability, not by something we can do, Lord, but it's because the light of your word that shines upon that seed inside of us, it's growing, Lord, into that fulfillment of what you've spoken. And now, Lord, we want to be that light to others. So, we just surrender ourselves to you, Lord, as we would just sing a song of worship. We commit the people to you now. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Let's just sing this song. What is what? Help me sing it. &gt;&gt; To be all is [music] [singing] praise [music] his [singing] name. Praise his name. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He's in [singing] the house. &gt;&gt; A little girl [singing] was lying there. People all were weeping. [music] They just laughed at [singing] Jesus when he said she's only sleeping. As he took [singing and music] her by the head, she began to live again. [music] Some begin to praise the [singing] Lord. Some begin to say, [music] "He's in [singing] the house. Death has to flee. Now [singing and music] there is light where darkness used to be. [music] Now there is hope. There's no [singing] more time. So [music] I praise his name. Praise [singing] his name. He's in the [music] house. We are like that [singing and music] little girl beding all our sins. How many can raise your [music] hand and say that's the truth. search his [singing] heart of mine &gt;&gt; and then he gave me life again [music] cuz I am just a house of clay but ever since that [music and singing] blessed day there's a light that shines in me [music] for all the world to see he's [singing] in the house now [singing] there is light [music] where darkness used to be. Now [singing] there is hope. [music] There's no more doubt. [singing] [music] So I'll praise his name. Praise [singing] his name. [music] He's in the house. We are like that little girl dead [music and singing] in all our sins. Jesus touched his heart of mine, gave [singing and music] me life again. I am just the house of clay. [music] Let me testify this morning. &gt;&gt; There's a [singing] light that's been [music] shining in me for all the world [singing] to see. He's [music] in the house. [singing] And now there [music] is light where darkness used to be. Now there [music] is hope. There's no more doubt. So I'll [singing] praise his [music] name. Praise his [singing] name. He's in the house [music] and death has to flee. And now there is [singing and music] life where darkness used to be. And now there is [singing and music] hope. There's no more. [music and singing] So I'll praise his name. Praise his name. [music] He's in [singing] the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say now there's light [music] where darkness used to be. Amen. I don't know about y'all, but I enjoyed that. Amen. The Lord speaking to our [applause] heart this morning. [music] Amen. You know, I wonder how many here being the first service of a new year. Jesus said there was a woman that had 10 coins. &gt;&gt; And after noticing that one was lost, the Bible says she lit a candle and swept the house [music] and sought diligently to find it. You know, I I think about that woman. You ever wonder how she knew that a coin was lost? because she was looking. &gt;&gt; She checked &gt;&gt; to see if one was [music] missing &gt;&gt; here. Brother Matt come and preach the opening service of this year. And I think what a time that here we could reflect on our life and [music] say, "Lord, is there something missing?" I wonder how many can be honest this morning. Maybe just just uh have your hand raised. Lord I let me search my heart and [music] search my life and Lord if there be something missing here that brother was speaking and don't just put it off as I you you know the Lord was speaking to you I while your hands are raised and I don't say this to put on any man but there's direct word for [music] word conversations that I've had that that brother spoke out of his mouth this morning and we don't even [music] talk about the church and we he's been with us for a few days we never we never talked about the church one time or the condition [music] and we were just fellowshipping and having time with the family but direct word for word. You say, "Well, why would he say that?" Because it wasn't the man saying it. &gt;&gt; See, what was it? It was that candle that the woman used to search her house for what was missing. That was the light that was shining out this morning. That searching our hearts to find out what's missing in it. &gt;&gt; To look right into our life and find out what's missing. And if we could be honest with oursel, maybe you could just bow your head just a moment [music] and take this as a moment and say, "Lord, I don't want nothing to be missing in my life. I I don't want there to be a coin gone. I there may there just be any place." Just be just be real earnest here. We're starting a new year. God bless [music] you this morning. Real saints of God. That's what a real son of God does. He searches his life. A real daughter of God, she searches her life and searches her heart. Lord, may you shine the light of the word upon my life [music] and find if there's any missing place. Lord, I I pray that you would shine it. Lord, make it so open to me and then take that candle that our brother spoke about tonight. Take that very candle of the word of God and let it correct it. Sweep the house. Check the house. Lord, may you [music] correct me, Lord. Let me just lay it upon this altar, Lord, this morning. Lord, let me start a new year. Don't let me don't let me start it like I ended the last one. Friends, you know, you can be honest with yourself. [music] We don't want to put nobody on the spot, but you can be honest with yourself. You know what's missing in your life here? God done spent an hour showing you why you was sitting thinking about it. Or brother, wouldn't maybe it wasn't even something that he said, but it made you think of it and [music] you went to reflecting on your own. You know what's missing in your life? Say, Lord, I I pray that you would help me this morning. God bless you, brother, for being honest with God. [music] Lord, I pray that you would help me, Lord. Help me to overcome this that I've been battling. Help me overcome this temptation. Help me to overcome this trial. God is a just God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's brought you to a place in a moment that he can help you move past that very thing. Can you just lay it down upon an altar this morning? Lord, I I want a testimony. [music] I want a real testimony. I don't want to live like the world and look like the world and act like the world and and dress like the world just to make the world accept me. But I accepted Jesus Christ and he's who I'm looking for to accept me. Let me just lay down last year. Let me pick up a new year and let's just bow our heads. Won't we just pray each one? Gracious heavenly father, [music] Lord, you see these hands that are raised, Lord. Lord, honest hearts, God, knowing the places in our life, Lord, that that is missing. And Lord, any real honestarted believer, Lord, God, that's his desire is to be right with you, Lord, that Lord, that we could live a life that is worthy of the gospel. Lord, we just ask you this morning, Lord, as you move about this place. And Lord, as you would convict each one, God, we we never we never run from conviction. Lord, we thank you for it. God, it's the very thing that shows us where we're wrong. And Lord, the things that need to be made right in our life, Lord, we thank you for it, Lord. And I pray that you'd convict every heart, Lord. God, that there'd be something in our in our life, Lord, that would cause us to want to live closer to you, Lord. God, as we start this new year off, Lord, that maybe we would take inventory of our own lives, Lord, I pray that you would help us this morning to find those missing places. And God, that we would fill them with the Holy Spirit, Lord, that there wouldn't be one place in our life that the devil would have room to take over, Lord, or or to cause problems in our lives, Lord. We just thank you for it now this morning, Lord. I pray that you would help each one, God. May we draw closer to you, Lord. God, may this year be a a year that we could do what our brother was preaching. Lord, that we could we could share the light of this gospel. Lord, may we manifest the light of Jesus Christ, God, may we live it and be a testimony of it. And then one day soon, Lord, that each one of these believers, these saints, Lord, that sit in this building this morning, God, that one day together we'll take a body change, Lord. and all those that would sit back and laugh and make fun, Lord. We'll still cry for mercy, God, that you would have mercy upon them, Lord, that they would have an opportunity for eternal life. But Lord, we don't want to live through some tribulation and go through something like that. Lord, we just cry, Lord, that in this time when that you've given us, Lord, this time of mercy, Lord, that we would accept it. Lord, I pray that you would help each one. Lord, we thank you for it now. [music] In Jesus name we pray. Yes, my Lord. [singing] I give myself away [music and singing] so you can use me. I give myself [music and singing] away.

Cuz his heart sings, [music] "How great is his God." &gt;&gt; Amen. I think our God is great. &gt;&gt; He's You know what I I got in my pocket? I got my pocket three names. We have a prayer board in the back of the church. Me and Sister Judy was looking at it before before church. And [music] when we first started our our church here that we that that was a little prayer room [music] and of course half this building wasn't here had a curtain up across and the pull pit was over there by that window and and we had a little board back there for people to put names of pe members of their family or friends [music] that they had on their heart. They wanted to see them give their heart to the Lord. And people been struggling through things and they put their names on that board. And a lot of our young people have grandparents and parents and the saddest thing is to watch a young person put their parents' name on a list or their grandparents and it just it it it tears at your heart and [music] but they put those names and I was telling sister Judy I said I always walk by there and I'll take a moment and pray and pray over those names that are on there. And you know, I went by there this morning. I hadn't looked, hadn't [music] just taken and read each name in a while. And and I went by there and there's three people sitting in this church [music] that serve the Lord. I pulled y'all's names off that board this morning that somebody few months ago or maybe a couple years back had put your name up there on the board. Brother David Paul, your your name was one of them. I I took that that name off there. I about shouted in the back room. I thought somebody had it had it in their heart to put his [music] put his name up there on that list and and to remember him in prayer. And I thought, well, well, and we we prayed for him many times, but the grace of God &gt;&gt; went and found him and has him sitting in the in church and for serving the Lord, him and his family, and love the Lord. You know why? [applause] Because our God is a great God and he's a merciful God. And he he ain't a God that cares about the sins of your past or the failures of your God don't care one ounce about it. You're the only one that cares about that. God don't care nothing about it. He don't bring it back up. He don't even remember it no more. It's not even in his memory. You couldn't even make God remember it. He don't even know it. He made it in such a way that he couldn't even remember your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That when you come back to him and say, "God, forgive me again." He don't even know what it means to say again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he forgave you for it. and he put it beneath the blood and the be beyond the beyond the the the where you can't even find it no more the sea of God's forgetfulness because he's a great God &gt;&gt; and this church is filled with people that love God because he's a great God and our heart sings how great is our God destiny your name is on that list [music] I got your name up if I took it off the prayer board we'll still pray for you but she's serving the Lord &gt;&gt; a lot of these young people your name when you you went you may go through things. You know there's young people right now that's going through what you used to go through and and what we used to go through. &gt;&gt; I'm not kicking them out. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do the same thing I did for you and for your dad and your brother and your sister and your children. I'm going to pray for them just like I did for them. And I'm going to live a life in front of them. I'm going to keep trying to win them. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PUTTING THEM OUT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep trying to win them until they get something in their soul that anchors &gt;&gt; that the devil can't take them no more. &gt;&gt; That's my stand. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep winning them until they get an anchor. I thank God. He's a great God. &gt;&gt; He's a wonderful God. He's [music] worthy of our praise. Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. As you go, tell somebody that you love him. Greet them in the name of the Lord and start the new year off. Go shake somebody's hand. You hadn't shook in a while. Say, "Brother, I love you. I appreciate your stand." You know, I notice I don't ever I don't ever talk to you, but I notice you you're always here and you're at your post of duty and I sure appreciate you. Something little about their life that you notice. Go tell them how much you love them and appreciate them. God bless you this morning [music] as you go. Sister Gabriel, God bless you. Thank you for coming and spending the holidays with us, the children. [music] God bless y'all. And amen, brother Matt. [music] All things to [singing] you are all things. You deserve the glory.
