[34:03] an hour to praise God it's dark it's
[34:06] gloomy looks like there's no hope
[34:08] inside but there's a bride somewhere
[34:11] lifting their voices letting the world

[38:32] been here on on such a prophetic
[38:35] blessing and a and my mind just keeps

[38:46] blessed chosen generation can you say
[38:49] Amen listen all that the father has
[38:53] given me shall come what a promise what

[38:59] brother Matt tonight or today as I was
[39:02] as was I was in my study and I was
[39:04] meditating on the service tonight and
[39:07] and I was thinking you know this bride
[39:09] this chosen
[39:10] generation this this prophetic blessing
[39:13] has been given to this bride there it is
[39:16] impossible for her to be
[39:20] denied
[39:22] Hallelujah as the Old Testament says
[39:25] amen when the priest high priest would
[39:27] take the sacrifice in to the holies of
[39:30] holies amen that that that they was
[39:32] listening they was listening for the
[39:34] Chimes they was listening to the bells
[39:36] they was listening for some noise Amen
[39:39] to let them know brother Matt that their
[39:41] sacrifice was
[39:43] accepted cuz they knew Brother David if
[39:46] their sacrifice was accepted then the
[39:49] congregation was accepted and what a
[39:52] feeling it must have been amen when that
[39:55] that sacrif rice in the Old Testament
[39:58] was accepted and what about tonight
[40:01] church as our high priest authored up a
[40:04] sacrifice once and for
[40:06] all amen and that sacrifice if it was
[40:10] accepted it means tonight that the
[40:13] congregation has been accepted to and we
[40:16] can tell that lion devil amen that he's
[40:19] defeated
[40:22] tonight
[40:25] Hallelujah
[40:27] because that same
[40:31] promise that our sacrifice once and for
[40:35] all that in that that that that God is
[40:39] such a a prepared
[40:41] God he's always a step ahead of the
[40:45] enemy and he's never can be placed in
[40:47] Checkmate he can never be defeated he
[40:51] can never be conquered he can never be
[40:54] destroyed his word can never come back
[40:56] void amen listen friends it was the
[41:00] conding sending of God that he was going
[41:03] to have a bride in the end time look
[41:05] around you tonight look at your neighbor
[41:07] and said I'm one of them I'm the Bride
[41:10] of Jesus Christ the the very thought
[41:13] that God had in his mind before the
[41:16] foundation of the world and Brother
[41:18] David he was condenscending down from
[41:21] the beginning it was God above us and
[41:24] then 2,000 years ago he become God With
[41:27] Us and now he cond sending down in the
[41:30] gift of the holy spirit that that
[41:33] that sacrifice that's been accepted is
[41:37] now living and ruling and reigning in
[41:40] humanity
[41:42] again I say we can't be defeated they
[41:46] couldn't stop him yesterday sister Joyce
[41:48] they're not going to be able to stop you
[41:50] either don't you love
[41:52] me now the last time we here we went to
[41:55] Genesis and I like to to grab a point
[41:58] from here again tonight Lord's willing
[41:59] and Genesis 45 and 24 talking about uh
[42:04] the wagons of blessings for a moment he
[42:06] said so he sent his brother away and
[42:09] they departed and he said unto them see
[42:12] that you fall not out by the way they
[42:15] went up out of Egypt and came in the
[42:17] land of Canaan unto Jacob the father and
[42:20] they told him saying Joseph is yet alive
[42:23] and he's a governor of all the land of
[42:25] Egypt and Jacob's heart fainted for
[42:28] believed them not and I thought you know
[42:31] as we ministered if you'll just give me
[42:33] some Grace tonight but we as we
[42:35] mentioned last time it was looking to
[42:37] his flesh looking to humanity look at
[42:41] how hey it's the same way tonight amen
[42:44] we look to this flesh we are
[42:48] failures we all fall short we all come
[42:52] up short so many times and we look at
[42:54] our own ability it brings fear and
[42:57] failure and sadness and
[43:01] depression then he goes on he says amen
[43:04] and they told him all the words of
[43:06] Joseph which he had said unto him and
[43:09] when he saw the wagons which Joseph has
[43:12] sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob
[43:15] the father was
[43:17] revived and brother says I've often said
[43:21] the greatest enemy I got is William
[43:24] brandham he's the one that gets in God's
[43:26] way he's the one that gets lazy can I
[43:29] have an amen tonight he's the one that
[43:31] gets to a place sometimes where he
[43:33] thinks he can do something about it when
[43:36] he does that shoves God right out of the
[43:38] picture but when I can get rid of that
[43:40] guy when I can get rid of this guy when
[43:43] I going shove him out of the way
[43:46] amen and he says when he does that
[43:48] shoves God right out the picture when I
[43:50] can get rid of him I get to a place that
[43:53] he's out of the way then God can come
[43:55] over here and do things that William
[43:57] brandham knows nothing
[43:59] about amen so when he was looking at
[44:02] himself he knew brother Dave there was
[44:04] no way Jacob was well stricken in age
[44:08] there was no way he could make the
[44:09] journey down to Joseph amen he was
[44:12] discouraged but when he began his Focus
[44:15] changed from who he was and his own
[44:18] abilities and seemed there was a greater
[44:20] force there there was a wagons of
[44:23] blessings amen amen and nothing can stop
[44:28] this blessing and Israel said it's
[44:31] enough Joseph my son's yet alive he said
[44:35] I'll go so Israel was carried by the
[44:39] wagons of blessings it was the power of
[44:43] the T that carried Jacob or Israel to
[44:48] his
[44:49] promises and I think praise God Amen
[44:53] that we have a a wagons of blessings
[44:55] right here here amen not just in this
[44:57] Tabernacle but in this Tabernacle
[45:00] tonight greater is he that is in you
[45:03] than the he that's in the world Amen I
[45:06] can't tonight but I serve a God that's
[45:08] more than able
[45:10] to we're failures brother Wesley but
[45:13] God's never failed we come up short but
[45:17] God's never came up
[45:21] short amen Israel were
[45:24] carried by this p power to the
[45:28] Palace so this end time bride she's
[45:31] going to be carried by the wagging of
[45:35] blessings of the son of man to change us
[45:39] from Mortal to
[45:42] immortality the prophet says the son of
[45:44] man is
[45:46] Christ he's the one that you're feeding
[45:48] on he says you're not feeding on man his
[45:52] words will fail but you're feeding on
[45:54] the infallible body word of the son of
[45:57] man he said if you haven't fed fully on

[46:08] things of the world feeding on the
[46:11] wagons of blessing gives you strength to
[46:14] fly brother the eagle in the Barnard
[46:18] never had the strength to soar above the
[46:20] Barnyard until he begin to Feast on
[46:24] Heavenly things
[46:27] you want to know why we're Earthbound
[46:28] tonight cuz it's what we're feeding on
[46:32] you feed on the world you feel feed on
[46:34] television you feed on uh uh uh lies and
[46:38] deceit and talking about your neighbor
[46:41] amen that's as far as you can live but I
[46:44] say tonight there's a greater place for
[46:46] the Bride of Jesus Christ in the hour
[46:49] that we're living in amen we shouldn't
[46:51] be living as a second cousin we are the
[46:54] Bride of Jesus Christ we have everything
[46:57] that we have need of right here within
[47:00] us

[1:10:08] as young kids we've heard how God was
[1:10:11] back there and the the great temp
[1:10:13] revivals and how was God was moving and
[1:10:15] the old moving transition from Pentecost

[1:10:21] word and a great Revival he
[1:10:25] the blinded eyes open the dead raised my
[1:10:29] a better we've heard about God but old
[1:10:32] brother amen how it how it changes from
[1:10:35] from what we heard somebody else when it
[1:10:38] comes home to us and maybe this is the
[1:10:40] way they was
[1:10:42] feeling when God began to tell them as I
[1:10:45] was with them I'm going to be with
[1:10:48] you they couldn't stop Moses you
[1:10:52] remember the testimony Moses he met God
[1:10:54] in a pillow fire he went down to Egypt
[1:10:57] am as a mighty Army like Russia is today
[1:11:00] and went down as a
[1:11:02] onean Invasion can you have can I have
[1:11:05] an amen is there anything too big for my
[1:11:07] God is there anything too big for my God
[1:11:11] tonight you tell me your situation I'll
[1:11:14] tell you my God's bigger you tell me
[1:11:17] what side your mountain is I'm here to
[1:11:19] declare my God Is
[1:11:22] Bigger amen amen and they begin to hear
[1:11:25] these testimonies but now God is
[1:11:28] speaking through this man he said he
[1:11:31] says oh you don't have to fight in this
[1:11:34] battle this is not your battle this is
[1:11:38] God's and he says tomorrow go down
[1:11:41] against them behold they came out of the
[1:11:43] Cliff of seas and you shall find them at
[1:11:45] the end of the brook before the
[1:11:46] Wilderness of jel and you shall not need
[1:11:49] to fight in this battle simply set
[1:11:52] yourselves stand still and see the
[1:11:55] salvation of the Lord that with you oh
[1:11:56] Judea and Jerusalem and fear not nor be
[1:12:00] dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[1:12:03] for the Lord will be with you oh what a
[1:12:05] feeling that must have
[1:12:07] been I can tell you a lot of things
[1:12:09] brother Matt I'm I got you
[1:12:12] back amen as brother as much as brother
[1:12:15] Matt thinks of me and I think of him he
[1:12:18] might tell me the same thing brother Joe
[1:12:20] I'm white behind you I'm with you all
[1:12:21] the way but there's one thing about it
[1:12:23] he can fail and I can fail I can I can
[1:12:26] tell you in Pro I'll be there tomorrow
[1:12:27] brother amen something comes up and it
[1:12:29] deters me but God's not like that if God
[1:12:32] tells you something he never
[1:12:35] changes amen I can tell you I'm going to
[1:12:37] be there man you'll go out to the battle
[1:12:40] Heen I'll be there that might give him
[1:12:41] some
[1:12:42] reassurance but it's nothing like
[1:12:44] knowing god is going to fight your
[1:12:48] battle it's nothing like knowing that
[1:12:50] God is on our side it's nothing like
[1:12:53] feeling not just a sensation cuz that
[1:12:56] can fail you but realize that God
[1:12:59] himself is here to fight our
[1:13:04] battles amen and how that must have felt
[1:13:07] that they tell him God's going to be
[1:13:09] this is God's battle and now he's
[1:13:11] telling him go down against this great
[1:13:15] multitude Moses go down to
[1:13:18] Egypt come on somebody I know we preach
[1:13:22] these things but have you ever really
[1:13:23] saw and stood and thought for a second
[1:13:26] how that must have came across the
[1:13:29] Moses's natural
[1:13:31] mind come on
[1:13:33] somebody he's been down
[1:13:35] there he was a he was a leader down
[1:13:38] there he knew the power of
[1:13:41] Egypt oh I'm going to take a run away
[1:13:44] right now brother David but there was
[1:13:46] something in that Pillar of Fire that
[1:13:50] draw out anything of Moses out of him
[1:13:53] and he placed something there says Moses
[1:13:56] go down there and I let my people go
[1:14:00] tell tell that devil tell that great
[1:14:07] Army I am that I
[1:14:11] am all knowing all pring God
[1:14:16] Amen a few minutes before that that that
[1:14:19] pillow fire experience he might have ran
[1:14:23] but that pillow of fire done something
[1:14:24] to
[1:14:27] him and no doubt they was thinking about
[1:14:30] these things my time is sorry about this
[1:14:33] let me can I finish
[1:14:40] this and Jehoshaphat the Lord will be
[1:14:43] with thee and Jehoshaphat bowed his head
[1:14:46] with a space to the ground and Judea and
[1:14:49] the habitants of Jerusalem fell before

[1:44:58] many say they're thankful for the blood
[1:45:00] of Jesus Christ amen and just what a a
[1:45:04] privilege it is to be able to live the
[1:45:06] life of an overcomer many times that we
[1:45:09] walked out and we saw the enemies that
[1:45:11] we had to face that were laying on the
[1:45:13] ground and hear that God had came in in
[1:45:15] the middle of the night sometimes when
[1:45:18] you you ain't even there to fix it but
[1:45:19] God will fix it amen I just I think God
[1:45:21] can do things that's beyond our ability
[1:45:24] he can he can make things better that
[1:45:26] you can't make better and he can do it
[1:45:28] better than we can anyhow so we just
[1:45:30] want to rely on him amen you appreciate
[1:45:33] the Lord and what he has done for us
[1:45:34] won't somebody give the Lord a hand clap
[1:45:37] of praise tonight isn't he a wonderful
[1:45:39] God how he's ready to have communion
[1:45:42] tonight and I know it's drawing late but
[1:45:44] we're just going to take our time we we
[1:45:45] don't have communion very often and and
[1:45:48] so we just want to take the time with
[1:45:49] the Lord and and and don't don't worry
[1:45:52] about it we'll just want to just let
[1:45:53] everything go and let God have his way
[1:45:55] tonight and and just get our hearts and
[1:45:58] Minds prepared and uh for that for that
[1:46:01] service and just the time to be able to
[1:46:03] Fellowship together and I just thought
[1:46:06] that was good brother B said I would
[1:46:07] have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't
[1:46:09] been for the vision I thank God that we
[1:46:11] have a vision tonight that we know who
[1:46:13] we are and we know where we're going and
[1:46:14] we know our enemy don't have the ability
[1:46:17] to overpower us amen but we're not
[1:46:19] discouraged we're not defeated we're
[1:46:22] we're we're happy in the Lord Brother
[1:46:23] mark because we know who we are and we
[1:46:25] know where we're going and I just love
[1:46:28] the Lord Brother B said there's nothing
[1:46:29] like it I've ever found on Earth is to
[1:46:31] come together in Heavenly places and
[1:46:33] have communion and fellowship with God
[1:46:36] and with each other that's what God had
[1:46:38] intended in the Garden of Eden isn't it
[1:46:41] wonderful that Here We Are Tonight
[1:46:43] brother Jared to be able to come and
[1:46:45] have fellowship with God that's what
[1:46:46] communion really is it's not it's not
[1:46:48] just to uh partake
[1:46:50] of of the service or the table that's
[1:46:52] set before you but is to be able to have
[1:46:55] a real communion and fellowship with God
[1:46:57] and so we just want our hearts and our
[1:46:59] our minds just to be able to be clear
[1:47:02] and and maybe if we could just sing this
[1:47:04] song tonight we're going to sing uh make
[1:47:07] me more like you amen and if there's
[1:47:09] something in your heart tonight that you
[1:47:11] just like to give to the Lord and and
[1:47:13] friends let me tell you don't let the
[1:47:15] devil keep you from a blessing that God
[1:47:17] has for you brother Joe was speaking on
[1:47:19] a prophet prophetic blessing that
[1:47:21] they're here in a communion service I've
[1:47:23] saw people that were healed I've saw
[1:47:25] people filled with the Holy Ghost I've
[1:47:26] saw miracles happen I've heard testimony
[1:47:29] of testimony of things the miraculous
[1:47:31] things that God has done in the in the
[1:47:34] middle of a communion line so it's not
[1:47:36] just something that we do as a tradition
[1:47:39] or to do something just to uh take up
[1:47:41] time or or ritual or something like that
[1:47:43] but I expect the supernatural amen and
[1:47:47] this is what God is doing for us tonight
[1:47:49] brother Mark he is preparing prepared a
[1:47:50] table just like he did that day with the
[1:47:53] disciples and they sat down with them
[1:47:55] and Jesus began to break bread and
[1:47:57] Brother David when he broke the bread he
[1:47:59] told them do this in remembrance of me
[1:48:01] and it was the moment that he would
[1:48:03] share with them it was an intimate
[1:48:04] moment between Christ and the disciples
[1:48:07] and that's what God has called us to
[1:48:09] tonight to be able to remember that time
[1:48:11] of the Lord he knew what would what was
[1:48:12] about to happen he knew he was about to
[1:48:14] go lay down his life and and so here
[1:48:16] he's called us again to and I I just
[1:48:18] want to invite you as we come for the
[1:48:20] communion where the brothers are going
[1:48:22] to come out and we're going to go from
[1:48:23] this side and brother Wesley is going to
[1:48:25] move that chair right there out of the
[1:48:27] way and and uh we're going to come down
[1:48:29] from this side and then exit on this
[1:48:31] side and and we just want to encourage
[1:48:33] everybody to take a part of the
[1:48:34] communion and you know if there's
[1:48:36] something in your in your life I I spoke
[1:48:38] it this morning but I want to say it
[1:48:39] again tonight there ain't but two things
[1:48:42] that would disqualify a person or would
[1:48:44] cause a person not to take communion and
[1:48:46] one is that you didn't is that you uh
[1:48:49] that you had a confessed sin or hadn't
[1:48:52] repented of something and the other was
[1:48:53] that you weren't born again so how many
[1:48:55] Born Again believers do we have here
[1:48:56] tonight and for something in your life
[1:48:58] you need to repent for then repent for
[1:49:00] it God is he's a I know a testimony of a
[1:49:03] girl that stood in line that was walking
[1:49:05] before a prophet one day and as he would
[1:49:07] discern the hearts of people and tell
[1:49:08] them the things that was wrong in their
[1:49:10] life and she would come up and hear she
[1:49:12] was out with her friend and she was
[1:49:14] smoking and when she got up in the line
[1:49:16] and she was so she was so nervous that
[1:49:18] when I get up there he's going to know
[1:49:19] that I've done that and he's going to
[1:49:20] expose it in in front of all these
[1:49:22] people and so she bowed her head and she
[1:49:24] said Lord forgive me for that and she
[1:49:26] came up in the line brother Mark and
[1:49:28] went out and received what she had asked
[1:49:29] for and her friend come up at the end
[1:49:31] and they they said well you know why
[1:49:33] didn't the why didn't he see what was
[1:49:35] what was wrong with her and you know
[1:49:36] that she had that that sin in her life
[1:49:38] and why didn't you see it and and
[1:49:39] brother B had told him back brother Mark
[1:49:41] he said well because she had repented
[1:49:43] before she ever got up here and if God
[1:49:45] can't see it then how could he show me
[1:49:47] it don't take but a few seconds for a
[1:49:49] person to repent it ain't something that
[1:49:50] you got to come and and beat it out of
[1:49:52] God and beat it out of an altar and and
[1:49:54] and to repent brother Mark it takes a
[1:49:56] True Heart of repentance and saying God
[1:49:58] I pray you'd forgive me and and and
[1:50:00] there ain't none of us will ever be
[1:50:01] worthy outside of the blood of Jesus
[1:50:04] Christ how could we be worthy of the
[1:50:06] body of our Lord Jesus or not discern
[1:50:08] the Lord's body outside of the blood of
[1:50:10] Jesus so I invite you tonight if there's
[1:50:11] something you'd like to repent or if you
[1:50:13] if you have something on your heart and
[1:50:15] maybe it's been a while and you like the
[1:50:16] brothers to pray for you well they'll be
[1:50:18] right over there on the side as you come
[1:50:19] through through the line but we just
[1:50:21] want everybody to be able to take part
[1:50:22] it's an Open Table amen so we just want
[1:50:25] to invite our brothers to come brother
[1:50:27] Morgan and and brother Phil as they as
[1:50:29] they come but we just want to sing this
[1:50:30] song Maybe Just bow your heads and and
[1:50:33] and just open your heart to the Lord
