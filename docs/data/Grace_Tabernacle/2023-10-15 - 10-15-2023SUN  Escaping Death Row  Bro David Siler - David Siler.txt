that that I personally knew about that God came and moved in a supernatural way I thank God for it I can Testify the Lord's done something for you already had a sister left last night and she was she

youall have one I just want you to know it was a blessing again back next year God he would provide a place that we could just come and have a time with the Lord you know there there there's just a it's a famine in the land is it but here we are a people that have plenty to feed on brother do was talking about it before church he said you know it's just wonderful to have something to feed on every day he said I was talking about it and how it is that that you draw straight from it and one day we'll take our last bite and we'll go right into the Rapture come last night and preach the very thing I said isn't it wonderful that we had something to feed on just uh there been a tremendous meeting and last year was a tremendous meeting sister C had shared with us yesterday it was a one year she said it was one year ago today that I came into this same meeting and had the brothers had prayed for me she had been 27 years on prescription came medication and in the meeting the Lord took it from her she one year go [Applause] today I think when people come together and and let their faith get to a place that God can work you'll see things you may never saw he's a supernatural God I just really appreciate you your efforts and the sacrifice that you made our home Church to make the meetings possible and I know that I know it's been a lot of work and I just want to say thank to you each one of you for there's so many that we can share the people that's been blessed and it's because of your efforts to make it possible so I just say God bless you to our home church and our brothers and brothers back there working for the Tim and John working on the sound and you know they get forgot about the only time you know there's a sound Guy is when there's something wrong with the sound

Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you today while you're standing with us we're going to go to the Book of Psalms 102 want to say what an honor it is to be here today with you in these series of meetings this week we've just had such a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord and I'm just believe the Lord spoke to us this week you believe that we certainly appreciate our brother Matt for allowing us to be able to come be a part of your your meeting this week we always appreciated him being a part of us our meetings that we have rather and those of you that come and support us we want to say how much we appreciate that and we love you with all of our hearts Psalms 102 we want to look at Verse 18 now I know the brothers has preached all through this this week but that's all right you're going to hear it again today amen amen Psalms 102:18 this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord you believe you're one of them today for he had looked down from the high of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner and to loose those that are appointed to death now I want to go to the Book of Romans chapter 5 if you'll turn to the New Testament Romans chapter 5 we're going to look at verse 12 and then we're going to go to chapter 7 just real quick Romans 5:12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all everybody say all for all have sinned Romans chap 7: 23 we know that the book of Romans is one of the most debated scriptures in all the Bible because they say that Paul was unconverted whenever he wrote this but we don't believe that cuz we don't believe that God will allow any man that's unconverted to be able to preach and read actually write something that'll convert men Romans chapter 7: 23 and I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind anybody ever had that war it's Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so Paul was aware that even though he had been borned again he knew there was something within his flesh that was still bound no matter how free he was in his soul and he said I see what's happening on the inside but the problem is is this man that's on the outside and he said it's bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members verse 24 and oh Wretched Man that I am now notice when Paul says this he don't say oh Wretched Man that I was but Paul in his converted state says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and from that today I'd like to speak on escaping death Ro may the Lord add His blessings to the word today you can be seated God bless you so honored to be here among you Paul whenever he deals with this in verse 24 he uses the word deliver which is actually the English word that you and I use for emancipation it's the word that we use for to be redeemed or to be rescued and then it uses this word and this is what we'll build from today it literally means to exonerate and so when you talk about being exonerated from something it literally means to be CLE clear from blame or accusation to be free from the guilt of it to release or discharge to be liberated and I know that we have heard that over and over again every service this week but you know it it just seems that maybe that's what the Lord wants us to hear and that when you would begin to look at what God says and how that God speaks and you you know you look at different things that God uh puts together as this meeting's been orchestrated by the Lord sometimes there's there's a theme that God puts together and he uses that that principle within his word to give that to you so that you will recognize I'm the one that's doing this I'm the one that's lead it's beyond the control of man but it's me that's doing it so we know that Paul when Paul talks about this part of being uh this battle this war that he's in that Paul said who shall deliver me from the body of this death and the question would be is that if Paul was going to be exonerated we'd have to ask if he's got to be delivered from something what brought the bondage to and we know that Paul was aware that he is a prisoner even though that Paul had been born again Paul been filled full of the Holy Ghost that Paul would still tell us that yet he's still in bondage to this Humanity that he lives in and you know we when we talk about death row death row is something that we're all familiar with because it's such such common terminology in the United States and the reason why a person would actually be to a place where they would you know be bound to a place where they have to be locked up and then their life will be taken it's because the prosecutor has found a significant amount of evidence that would be held against an individual and that the accusation that has been made they that he had been found guilty of the charge and that the actually that that whenever the charge has been given that the prosecutor doesn't just have as we'd say circumstantial evidence but even when it comes to an eyewitness and sometimes an eyewitness is one of the greatest things that a prosecutor has is somebody that saw you do the deep and let me say this in this case that we know that the Bible tells us that Satan is the accuser of the Brethren and that the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelation that he goes before God day and night and he accuses those so the accuser of the Brethren happens to be the eyewitness that the prosecutor is using that against you to hold you guilty and accountable for the sin that you did at one time and in this case not only is it Paul but let me say this every man that's born of a woman actually was born on death rad we was born into this this this place because of the way our natural birth had come because remember that what what causes a man to be prosecuted is because there's been a law that's been broken and the law that has been broken was B way back in the Book of Genesis chapter 2 that the Lord commanded him of every tree of the garden thou must freely eat but only of the tree of knowledge in good good and evil don't eat of it and then he says for the day thou eat thereof that day Thou shalt surely so there was a law then that once man breaks that law God must keep his word let me say this when God told man not to do it God simply cannot Overlook it he simply cannot look past it but if there's been a law that has been broken and that our God is a God that keeps his word he doesn't perform some shady deal not something under the table somewhere once God makes a decree he must bring his word to pass exactly the way that he said it and the Bible tells us that that whenever the woman took the the forbidden fruit and Adam took and he laay with his wife and I just want to say this the woman was deceived but Adam was never deceived the woman went into it by deception but not Adam Adam knew exactly what he was doing Adam knew exactly what was fixing to take place but he knew he could not bring red I to the woman unless he put his seed on the inside of her and when God so that seed on the inside he could not destroy uh he could not destroy the woman without destroying the seed so because the seed remained in the woman and Adam come to her it actually give her the ability to escape watch she should have been burned right along with the serpent but she escaped it and they live and Adam lives I miss something that God says the day thou eat that day thou shall surely die and Genesis 5 says all the days that Adam lived was 930 years and he died so Adam didn't fall over dead the moment that he ate the fruit you with me the the moment the ACT notice Adam did not fall over dead but let me say this Adam moves from one sphere to another he moves from one kind of life to a moral life and now Adam can you imagine Adam being pulled from that Eternal part where Adam could speak to the wind and the wind would obey he could speak to the tree and the tree would obey but now Something's Happened in Adam and because something is happened in Adam the word the the tree ain't moving and the wind's not stopping and the mountains not moving it's because Adam is pulled from that sphere of the spoken [Applause] words come on notice the Bible tells us and he died thank you brother says it like this in Perfection see God being holy and just I want you to catch that God is a just God he had to have a prosecution he had to prosecute The Sinner because he overstepped the boundaries of Grace and become a law breaking then he must be dealt with every law has a penalty and the penalty of transgressing God's law is death it had to project death to the human race and all the human race is under the penalty of the law and everybody can say Amen to that because every man woman boy and girl that is born after the fall that is born of a woman we was all born with the death element hanging on us there's no getting around that the prosecutor had his dead in the rights all was born in sin we was all shapen into iniquity we come into this world speaking lies nobody was born swinging the Bible nobody was born perfect nobody was born without mistakes nobody was born without every man that is born was born guilty say that why you say the law was broken and the penalty that comes with breaking the law judgment must follow now because the law has been broken brings us to our subject Every Man's been put in it's been put in cons solitary confinement all right we've been confined or we've been locked up but it ain't Bars of Steel it ain't a cage of Steel but what we've been bound up in is this human body right here right and Paul tells us even even though I got the new birth I'm still incarcerated he knew he was living what he knew there was a war that was going on Paul said for we know that the law is spiritual but I'm caral sold under sin amen think about that so Paul tells us I've been sold in the Sin I don't get ahead of myself come on but if I can be sold with the price come if I can be sold by a price do that mean I can be bo God but it takes somebody who's able it takes somebody who's willing it takes somebody who love you enough that can take your SE and have the ability to pay the rejected price to find you back prison even though I got new life I'm a proner bound up amen think about it every one of us here today we put suits on what we're incarcerated by we brush the teeth of what we're incarcerated by or if you don't you should he know I live on death row and even though I got Liberty on the inside I'm still trapped in this outside Paul goes on to say listen now for the earnest expectation of the creature it Waites ain't tell what happens when people going into prison they just keep waiting but in this case everything's waiting the trees are waiting grass is waiting animals is waiting everything's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because the creature itself listen to this it shall be delivered I love when Paul starts preaching positive it shall be delivered from the bondage corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation grth and surveil together in pain until now and not only they but ourselves also which has the what first fruits of the so you mean to tell me that even though that Nature's in this condition the Earth is in this condition is also in this condition and even though they got the first fruits of the spirit we're still groaning within ourselves waiting for what the adoption to wit which the prophet tells us in the rising of the Sun that means to Quicken the Redemption of your you mean to tell me this part of redemption of the price being paid it's not just going to do something from your soul Calvary did that but the end time of the Rapture it's not just going to do something for yourself but God wants to do something a't been done yet and he's going to do something to an entire group he he R to Enoch which was one he R to Elijah just was one in the days of Jesus when the resurrection take place think about but in the end time God's going to take a whole group and prove the power of the take and total Redemption to the B think about this and when the sons of God get put back in their place whenever they get back in the original condition it forces everything that man was given dominion over the trees get back in their place the line gets back in his place everything get put back in when the S of God which was the head of all when they get back in their place everything under there automatically gets pulled back into their place he says like kiss in the seals we've been waiting for this out come on we've been waiting for this out sir there was a day that was waiting on satification there was a day they was waiting on justification there was a day they was in the upper room waiting on the Holy Ghost we're waiting on something we've been waiting for this hour Hallelujah Lord we understand this will take place at the first resurrection Nature's groaning yes sir we're groaning everything's groaning because we realize something's not right I shouldn't had to fought to get out of bed this morning which was about 3:30 we shouldn't have to fight to get up we shouldn't have to fight to have joy we shouldn't have to fight to have peace but if we're fighting let me say this if we're fighting that proves there something on the inside that's standing against those things we need our second right I want you to listen to this and take this home with you the only way you can grown and wait for it is because there's been new life that is coming here that speaks of a new world so whether this says nothing or not there's something in here hallelujah that begins to speak it has a voice and it speak on the inside and it let you know there's a new world coming there's a new body coming there's a natur is coming speak of a new world what is it it's the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost that's the answer for our marriages that's the answer for our families that's the answer for our young people listen to me today that's the answer to our questions that's the answer to our doubts that's the answer to our wonderings is the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost if you got new life there's a voice on the inside that's speaking new Heaven and Earth is coming if you're weary today let me encourage you you're about to get let loose there a new body that's coming you get sick there's a new body that's coming and that body it'll never get weary it'll never get tired it'll never get down it'll never get discouraged because the one that makes it sick he ain't going to be [Applause] hallu let's keep watching that thought waiting waiting waiting sitting on death row just waiting joob picks that same mentality up and he said all all the days of my appointed time will I till I wait until until my change comes job had a revelation yes he did that he Glory even though I may go down I can't stay down hallelu he knew that the grave could only hold him so long he knew there was an appointed number of days that he would sit upon that but when those days are over there's going to come a resurrection because job seen the one that redeem him didn't say I my rede somebody told rede said I know I said I know thate I don't need a preach I need a revelation there was a man Jo put by the way of the grave come on but there was a man by the name of Enoch and when Enoch got to fellowship with God death got to hanging around Enoch and death could not wait to take Enoch to the grave but aoch got the fellowshipping with God and He got The Walking with God until one day he just was not yes sir you know what that tells me Satan may look at what you do on the outside yeah he has no idea the work that's going on the inside he know that came stop and I want to say look to what God's doing on the inside of you because greater is he that his en than he this flesh this Humanity this this solitary is Lord Enoch that's was the seventh from Adam yes right yes sir Enoch was the seven from Adam you and I are the seven Church age from the last Adam sir the Bible don't even say secondness is last cuz there ain't another one coming and God's got a group yes the way he had one man in the in the beginning he's got a whole group in the end and she's going to be just like Enoch she's going to walk right off death rad can you imagine what the devil thought when Enoch come up missing I guarantee there was all kinds of excuses made the devil said I knew it I knew I knew there was something about that old boy there ain't no telling where he's at he's been listen to them tape so much those book so much he's probably lost his mind and went off somewhere there ain't no telling where he is at he probably hiding somewhere trying to make my people think that he's gone I want to tell it didn't matter what people thought it didn't matter what anybody else matter the devil says when a person struck with disease they got aches and pains but one time they wasn't that way preaching spiritually to you naturally listen to that you get struck with disease you got aches and you got pain anybody like that in this building with me on sure one time they wasn't that way so watch so every time we get a new ache and new pain we look back to our origin to when we didn't have it and he said but they're groaning they're not right there's something wrong they're trying to get back where they was when they had health and when the nature and people the Bible said they're groaning it shows that something's not in its a to be conditioned right amen he didn't say never be you're ought to be conditioned they fallen from somewhere so every man is born into this cons solitary confinement but you and I needed something to get us out of this mess and the only way to get man off a death rad somebody had to come Among Us who was not born under the penalty of death in his flesh amen and since death came by woman breaking the word brother with me watch DEATH came because of a woman breaking the word to restore redeeming back God uses a woman marriage that's going to believe the words when it looked impossible when it was totally invisible she still believed the invisible anywhere so somebody had to come that was not not born under the death that man was born over and since it came by the Fall God now watch DEATH came because woman burth seed into death by in Redemption watch God doesn't use the ability of man he going use the product of man you're not understanding what I'm saying he don't use the part that gets you down to make a redeemer but God took his own word yeah I said he didn't use the product of Joseph he didn't even use the Egg of Mary God created both egg and Seed he didn't use Mary's ability come on Mary it takes more than your ability it takes more than your understanding what does God need he needs your faith to believe his word and said be it unto me according to the world the fall of a woman bir the of the serpent in the Earth right but the prophet tells us that Mary did what Eve fa to do sin interrupted God's program and she took the seat of the serpent don't you see yes sir what Satan's pushing through the ages under White Horse red horse black horse The Pale Horse which was the only one that didn't have a name remember every other horse rider didn't have a name tell you come to that that last horse the P horse rider and the Bible said his name is death and hell falls after him you know what he's trying to do he's trying to get every person under the same anointing that Eve was under to take the seed of the [Applause] serpent the way that he interrupted God's program God interrupts the devil's Hallelujah what think about it and besides having a and a bunch of daughters and he thinks that the elect is going to be like all the rest of them they'll SW Hook Line and Sinker but something on the inside of them that was put there come on it was already there it was already put there it came from the mind of God it came from their origin at one time where they was but they never had sickness they never had thoughts they never had sin they never had mistake they was an attribute of God and when Satan tries to get that seed listen that seed cannot be [Applause] deceived right now Adam when he fell in the beginning Adam had the book of redemption the prophet tells us yes he did come on and he had the ab that's the reason Adam had the ability to speak the word he had the book he possessed the book The Power deep of Heaven and Earth he can control he can control the wind he had the because he had the book he had the spoken word but when he failed that book didn't go to the hands of the devil but the prophet tells us it went back into the hands of the original owner which is allmighty God but here's the problem God gave it to man he wanted man to possess this he wanted man to have this ability but when Adam lost the book he lost his rights to the spoken words and the book went from Adam which was an open book to a closed book listen for 6,000 years the book's been closed the book's been closed no man had access to it Satan didn't have access to it demons didn't have access to it nobody had access to it that's right but if you ever get to a day that we've been waiting on and hour that the book goes from a closed book to an open book what of authority lays in that book it didn't lose its Authority it didn't lose its power it didn't lose its ability it just needs somebody who can believe it and accept it for what it say John comes to Revelation chap 5 one of the most Sublime places in all the scripture and John was beginning to weep because the search went on and they couldn't find nobody they put Moses up there and Moses had a temper [Music] but Jeremiah up there the Weeping Propet and Jeremiah wasn't good enough John wept cuz he know that those great men if they wasn't worthy they would nobody and the prophet said if there wasn't nobody worthy six steal she'd simply turn back to Adams listen this creation mankind it would turn back to ad and molecule and so forth and like not even be a creation a person or nothing else cuz Adam lost his rights of that book but there's a prize and that's Redemption there's some price of redemption that nobody could do it listen to this so he made his own law which was a kman law Lord come on and they couldn't find nobody every man was born of sex born of sexual desire he was in the original sin see he couldn't do it there was nothing in him there was no holy Pope there was no priest there was no Dr Divinity whoever me listen nobody was worthy couldn't be an angel cuz he's not King to you though they have the ability of choice they're not King to you as far as [Applause] Humanity but listen but it had to be a man right so listen this listen to how powerful God himself become a Kinsman Tak on human flesh through the bir and then he shed listen he shed his blood than how powerful that is come on he didn't shed her blood he shed his blood my question who's the he that God created listen got condescended into the form of a man and God shed his now so the blood didn't come the way our blood did no every man that's born of a woman was born with tainted blood right and the blood listen but his blood didn't come the way our blood did let me get to this because listen you and I we Bass the original part of our Lives which was word life and we come to this world in a human body but I want to say this because you and I Bast it Jesus did [Music] not Jesus did not he came from fight theophany to flesh you are pastur so God came down watch what he did God created a blood cell amen let me say let me tell you why I say that he did not create blood cells no he created a blood you can't even see it with a natural eye if it's so small oh let me preach God in Simplicity it's so small it's listen you can't even your natural eye oh it can't even comprehend but God created a sale and then from that sale that he created he multiplied [Applause] Sals a Myst Redemption to you I'm going to say it again it starts with one seeds and then it multiplies and it multiplies don't you to see the way that God put the church he took 120 put them in the upper room and when they got done they begin to multiply one son after another son after another son what was they doing speaking that word preaching that word and on the day of Pentecost 3,000 Souls was added to the king of God spiritual multiplication from the [Applause] world it's all right so we're not saved by the blood of a man we're saved by the blood of God Isaiah knew what we was talking about he said it like this your iniquities has separated you in your God your sins has hid his face from you but he will not hear your hands oh let me preach the crime scene come on do it brother your sins caus him a hiest face yeah we had iniquities your hands Isaiah says your hands was defiled with blood you talking about being caught red-handed sir sir sir your hands were defiled with blood your fingers iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongues has muttered perverseness let's just be honest s got make up a lot of stuff on us and because your blood is painted yeah it separated you and your God and it literally watch it built a wall yeah it put us in a confinement where it separated us from God and we couldn't get to God because of it because of this iniquity we couldn't get to him because we was guilty we was going to be punished and the punishment was he was going to die but remember he said we're saved by the blood right and Paul says like this in the New Testament he says but now what we've been waiting on in Christ Jesus amen not in Jim oraine s but in Christ Jesus ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace he has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of petition that's between us so because of the blood Paul is letting us know that the blood had the power to literally break down the wall that separated and separated us from God it literally means listen to this that word broken literally means to lose one that's bound it means to release from bonds it means to release one who is bound with chains a prisoner to discharge from prison to let him go listen to this it means to be let go scot-free yes sir off the hook thank you Lord to dismiss to break up the laws having a binding force that are locking to where it brings complete an how many thankful for the blood so there is a binding Force that had this war had me handcuffed and chained out I was destined to die every man that was born of a woman lived for a few years go by the way of the Grave then life comes goes by the way of the Grave life comes again goes by the way of the grave and we've been in that cycle all of these years think of that your family line has been in that cycle all of these years but I want to tell you we've been waiting on this hour right do you know why because we found an appeal we found appeal because there's been some new evidence that's come I'm done listen there's been some new evidence come up in my face and the law can't hold me no longer if there's evidence that's been produced that I'm not the one that's guilty of us do you realize this is in the last 20 years there's been more people in the last 20 to 25 years that's been living on death death row that's been let go than ever in the history of the world and the reason why is because listen because of scientific advancements of the ability to see what is not there to go beyond what our eye can see what the feeler can feel what the mind can think there's been a scientific advancement called the ability to search DNA and DNA listen DNA is found in the [Applause] blood science and technology has discovered the ability to test the DNA the evidence found at the crime of the scene of the crime now the DNA of somebody is literally a genetic fingerprint yep there's not another person in the world that has your DNA now you will right here it listen your eye color can be impersonated your hair color can be impersonated your stature can be impersonated but you can't listen DNA cannot be impersonated first can be impersonated second but when it comes to s word when it comes to sing when it comes to act and up the person listen they try to impersonate Christianity but they cannot impersonate a real blue true Sy of allmighty [Music] [Applause] God DNA first become noticeable in the late 1800s which is the years of restoration right you see where I'm going come on but the problem is in the 18 1800s they knew that the blood cell was a genetic cold yeah but it was still a mystery it was just a mystery so there was something that was locked up in the blood they knew there was something in there but they didn't have the vision they didn't have the eyesight they didn't have the prophetic to deep enough in it to tell you what Las so it was a code yes sir it was a mystery they couldn't figure out they had pieces they had Parts just to live my face come on they had pieces they had Parts but the genetic code of the blood was still a mystery go Google it but somewhere in the mid 1960s oh right thank God go because of the advancement of scientific ability and the ability of the of the glass to be able to see further in the 1960s The Mystery of the blood begin to be [Applause] unlocked in other words it had been a mystery for all of these years but now the right hour has come the hour only been waiting on the hour that J waited on the hour that listen God has been waiting on this [Applause] G what they found was each person's DNA actually contains an individual identity it's a genetic fingerprint listen you don't think you're an original think nobody else in this world got your fingerprint nobody that's good so the DNA that is good is a part of the [Music] body the the Unseen part of the body that your identity is hiding in right here's the deal it was hiding in there and you didn't even know it was so when you was born of a man of woman there was a mystery on the inside of you you didn't even know what it was amen but as you begin to grow and as you begin to age come on and your eyes begin to come open now catch this you cannot impersonate DNA let me say this the outside man has all kinds of impersonations but when it comes to the mystery of the third pool it cannot be impersonated by nobody cuz Satan don't even know what it is himself see that he don't even know what it is itself that's the reason when the Prophet come to the end of the seven seal and begins to talk about the third pool and then he begins to come over couple mess Mitch again souls in prison again s Le souls in prison go well that's for the people that's Eternal lost come on right come on but you and I recognized we've already heard the eagle scream we've already heard the message of the hour we've already heard we already heard from the Lord and now what we've been mystery for is now revealed for and your eyes has come open Hallelujah so but from the mid 1900s let me get this there was pieces and parts but in the mid 1960 the mystery be to unfold and it just so happens to be that the same time that the DNA and the genetic code was being broke the book that had been sealed since the days that ad lost it the book is going to get taken and the seals are going to come off and and the Mystery of the word is being made known the same hour that the mystery of the blood's being made known [Applause] and the question would be who brought all this understanding I want to tell you it was the one that came from the midst of the throne remember what the prophet said he said they looked there in Revelation chap 5 they saw the Beast remember that the four beasts right oxman eagle and the prophet tells us that's the same ones that was guarden away in the in the Garden of Eden he said there was four chables there they was there to to guard Every Which Way North South East and West have ox man and Eagle sir right think about it I know it's a standing but listen to that again lonox man Eagle stood guarding the gate what was that Garden way to the Tree of Life which was not an apple tree was an orange tree it was Christ and here they are in Revelation chap 5 doing the same thing they did in Genesis they're doing the same thing in Revelation chapter 5 let me tell you this John didn't see they must have done a pretty good job come on now come on now they didn't see yeah and when John begin to weep watch this yeah when it went to humanity side there you go and tears begin the human tears come out of John's eyes that's when the mystery from the midst of the throne he said here came a lamb as it had been as it had been slain so here comes the lamb that had been slain watch what he don't say this ain't line that's coming which represents judge but it's a lamb which tells us the dates of mercy and intercession is still in [Applause] progress so here comes the lamb takes the book opens the seals and reveals the mystery of the world Amen listen not only has DNA exonerated a people on but it's also found the one who was rightfully guilty of breaking the [Applause] life the mystery the seals open didn't just bring your identity it identified that Antichrist spirit that started riding under that white horse rider deception that R through that Ephesian Church age went right on Down Under that ox morning down and that day let me say this it's going to identify the Antichrist spirit all the way through the church [Applause] ages hallelujah what happens is it takes the one who is on death row and it lets him go scot-free and the law binds the one who was originally guilty of it in the first part in the first place amen says oh we've been waiting on this hour the breach we've been waiting on this hour let me just say this the law the law had an answer to it the law of sin and death got an answer to it right what is the wages of sin anybody know death brother tells us the law is a policeman he put you in jail but he can't get you out of jail ain't nobody in this building that's ever got pulled over by a police officer and he walks up to your window with a smile face just want to thank you for how good of a driver you've been today has he no just want to stop you and congratulate you how well you're driving obeying the speed limit and the truth is we weren even driving the speed limit till we saw him sitting on side of the road we hit our brakes all right yeah oh I see I see yeah you angels in this place I would know I we having it right outside here we could just float around the clouds we all hit our brakes you'll be going 35 you're going to hit your brakes drives me much drivers they drive me crazy you could be going down on this side of the interstate and they could be a wreck on the other side in the ditch as far away you can barely see it and they're going to stop the traffic on this side to look at the wreck on that side we coming back the other day from Florida and it caused a wreck on our side because there was a wreck on the other side listen friends get your eyes off everybody else's get your eyes off everybody else's trouble everybody else's problem everybody else's situation and get your eyes on the r get your eyes on the body change get and C off away from Earthly fa and put your destination in your spiritual GPS and see not [Applause] on L it's a law that had us bound something sets us free sir did you know that everything on the earth yeah come on is bound by law it's called gravitation everything's under the law which what that means is that if I got this handkerchief in my hand every time I open my hand it's going to do the same thing do you know why there's a law that's binding that thing and every time I open my hand that law takes over and let me say this the law of gravity is proportional to the size of an object that it's pulling against let me say it like this the heavier you are with sin the more bound down you are with sin on the more the law has a pull on your lives but Paul said lay aside every weight of sin of unbelief in other words we're not packing a listen we're not packing a f we're unpacking we're not packing a suitcase we're unpacking pie we're ping we're packing we're leing all says every time open my hand it says this is going to do the same thing brother Newton tell tell us it's going to do the same thing every time matter of fact I preach another two hours be here by myself but yes sir M would be here yeah I had my hands around his neck but it says every time I open my hand it's going to do the same thing amen but it ain't falling now no you know why there's a higher power that super that literally interrupts one law because of a higher law amen what is it there is a law of life that suspends it in the air and does not allow the law of gravity to drop it listen to take it back to the dust take it back to the dark take it back to the earth a high they interrup the Lord grav and when the Rapture Tes place on there's going to come a high that's going to come by your heart it's going to come by my heart and the LA of the right will Su you and I we will meet the brother that devil that has ped upon you ever since the day you was Bor he don't have no rights to [Applause] you because the you is going to ro you and not just you and not just you I got some loved ones that's in that grave the bodies are let me say this God knows where every one of them are they may have been eat my lines God knows where the very just for that line whenever they pass through he knows where that dirt is hallelujah we're not preaching replacement we're preaching Resurrection the only way is you got to come under a higher law now an airplane temporarily breaks the law of gravity but it can't keep you up there forever you know why runs out of power I said it runs short so you can bounce around for a little while jump up and down chat right yes sir but eventually it's going to run out of Sting yes sir you know why we we all get tired we all get weak yeah but if you get in something that's not limited to the atmosphere we're in it's just a spaceship it possesses a power to take you from one atmosphere to another atmosphere that's not controlled by the law that you're bound by so it actually becomes weightless I'm going to say this one time you if you get put in a spacecraft and you go beyond our atmosphere I'm not talking about after you die yeah there people that's that's living yes sir they're living in that atmosphere enough hallelujah hallelujah there's people that's living in an atmosphere that the law does not bind them Hallelujah somebody you know why you know why they're not bound by the law of the Earth because they're not Earthbound people I'm tell you when the revelation of this word opens up and reveals your identity it lures the say it takes you one from one sphere to another sphere we're not trying to hop around like a bunch of rabbits we're not trying to be a bunch of airplane a people we're not just trying to be Pentecostal or Pentecostal we're elected we're Bri we're chosen we're called We're ordained we're God's people and God ordained you not to be Earth [Applause] creatures we are not human beings experiencing Heavenly things we're Heavenly things experiencing human lives just from what perspective you want to look at and that's what Calvary did Calvary give you a blood transfusion and whenever the test is done on your blood and they draw your blood and take it to the courtroom there's something wrong with your DNA no something right you know because the devil wants to deal with time the devil wants you to run your mind every mistake you made every shortcoming you got every bad thought that comes through he wants to run you back to time but I want to say your DNA does not run you back to mistakes it don't you back to your shortcoming it runs you back to your original identity when you was an attribute in the mind of God before the foundation that's what your [Music] so that tells me death row has no rights to me because if the sin's been dealt with that the accuser's been holding against me and the DNA don't match Hey sir If It Don't Fit you must have quit get that what is he talking he don't fit you must have quit yeah and I'm not talking about Ben CH perro Johnny coch I'm talking about almighty God this ain't something to try to fool somebody God ain't trying to fool the devil I'm come about you a rual identity by the blood L get you a blood transfusion it changes the moal structure of your blood you're not born of Earth you're a Heavenly person one scripture born scripture he that is born of God does not commit s yes sir anybody made mistakes this week anybody got shortcomings sir wait a minute then Paul said hey this morning God don't commit him what you talking about well let me just tell you who we're talking about he that is born of God by the new birth cannot see he may make mistakes he may have shortcoming but not he because the S of God remain in so the next time that accuser comes by your you can let him know I would have done it in the what the prophet tells us in invisible union he said you never done it the question is who's the real you it's not natural you it's not human you it's words you you never done it the eventual identity by the world has never been guilty you are son and daugh of God you was accused of that but you you you never done it you never done it in the first place no you didn't the first place was not 2,000 years ago or 30 years ago brother the first place wasn't the Garden of Eden the first place was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world I want to tell you what a promise that the Lord Lord has given amen Paul quotes that famous scripture in first Thessalonians 4 and he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God Amen and the dead in Christ shall rise hallelujah amen that's the truth brother that means everything that's been bound I got some family that's coming back I said we're coming back they've been having a reunion without us yeah but I'm going to tell you they speak to be a reunion it ain't going to be on this Earth it's going to be in the middle of the Earth PA says we which are shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be with the Lord think about that Paul said at the last you realize when Paul makes that statement about the last Trump to the Jew they didn't have cell phones then so they would blow the trumpet and the trumpet had a distinction or a meaning and Paul said this is the last Trump they're used to three of them the first trumpet sound you know what the first Trump means the first Trump means it's just about time it's just about time and then the second trumpet means pull P to pull up the stakes pack up the tents right that's what it means means pack up the tent and get in line and then Paul said the last Trump and the last Trump is marching orders which means you're going to March right off of this C BL Hallelujah you're going to March right out of this pron into a body ain't got no trouble ain't got no scar ain't got no Fe you're going to leave at the last Trum I want to say this we've heard the first Trump to get ready yes sir right H the second Trump to get in your position get in your place pull up the stakes and the last Trump it's marching order so let me say this when you recognize who you always was when that last one comes in yes sir [Applause] right can we bow our hearts just for a moment every head bow can we just lift our hands to him right now Lord Jesus these are the hands of people that are defying the law of gravity gravity takes a man's hands and pulls him down but people in this place today that's been saved by the blood of almighty God we raise our hands to you to say Thank You Lord thank you for this great blood thank you for this salvation that you've given us Lord we wasn't because we was worthy of it but wasn't one of is worthy Moses wasn't worthy Elijah wasn't worthy Jeremiah wasn't worthy Ezekiel wasn't but Lord out of the midst of the throne Hallelujah Lord where do you come from today from your church from the very midst of the Throne of the heart Thank You Lord You're our great high priest today we want to thank you for it father we believe that we're living in the closing moments of the Gentile dispensation Lord when we turn and look at the world the chaos that's taking place in Israel don't we understand what's going on what's Happening to Israel and the natural is what's happening to the bride and the spiritual Israel is under a physical attack and the bride's under a supernatural attack the Lord Israel Hallelujah they got something behind them that's greater than Warheads they got something behind them that greater than manate mechanics but they got a promise of God that out of Israel is going to come 144,000 Lord the same thing with the Gentiles there is something great behind us it's more than human ability it's more than human intellect but it's a Divine promise of God thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord Lord she'll C every way yes she'll make it to the other side and there won't be one devil that have the ability to be able to stop her cuz Paul goes on to say that you who are in Christ is not imputing their trespasses and he is committed unto us the word of reconciliation and the word of reconciliation is the word of restoration we have been restored back by the word to our original identity that we can be found blindess in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ oh God it's been so good to be here to hear your promises I pray Lord May these be more than sermons may they be more than just a meeting but may they be tools Hallelujah may they be tools that we can use that when the enemy comes that we'll take our tools out our swords out we'll take this word and we'll overcome the enemy thank you tonight Lord we give you praise in the name of Jesus Christ I said Victory is well victory is mine well Victory today yes it's mine and I told Satan let's just put our hands together let everything that has [Music] spread I said that victory is mine well [Music] victory [Music] victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is [Music] m [Music] [Music] pray Lord just one more time come out here why I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music]

behind for victory today is [Music] m this wow I about I'm getting ready to leave this world I believe that it's God's call to the bride in the last day preparing the hearts of the people I love what Brother David got at the end on the third trumpet call it was marching amen I think what he said ought to be on a t-shirt we're not Earthly beings doing Heavenly things we're Heavenly beings doing Earthly things somebody put that on a shirt I'll wear it we're Heavenly beings doing Earthly things isn't it wonderful we're about to do something that there ain't no man done since the fall in the garden isn't it something he told Adam in the day thou eat thereof Thou shalt surely die but said there the oldest man that's ever lived since that time was 969 years he had never as a man had the ability to live a thousand years you know there are scientists today that are trying to prove that a man can live a th000 years but they'll never be able to do it by science he said but one day we will we'll live in a millennium for years to prove that God has paid the penalty for sin it do the very thing that men don't have the ability to do I thought isn't it wonderful no man's ever live cuz we always die before a th years but isn't it something that the Millennium just happened to be a th years he said it'll prove that men will walk right into eternity I believe we're Eternal beings we'll live there Amen in that day of we're going to live amen isn't it wonderful today we're creatures of another kingdom somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] [Music] when I said

that's 100 Years of the future or something that very day we're living in that day we're living in the rapturing age amen this is the age of the Rapture this is why God has unveiled the signs that he's unveiled to the church in this age we're living in a Rapture and age and I thank God I'm a part of it is't it something that he chose you to live in that age he chose Enoch to live in Enoch's day and he chose you to live in this one I thank God for it I want to walk in it can we sing that maybe song We'll Walk In The Light as we're as we're going to close the meeting I sure hate to leave a

gave you a place that you can look back on for the rest of your life there's going to be days that are hard there's going to be trials that you're going to go through and he's gave you a place to look back to brother Cal God gave you a place that you can look back to and when the enemy comes in the middle of the night and says well God ain't ever God ain't even real God ain't doing that for you you feel that that you can't feel God you say Satan you're Al liive there's a place I'm point back to I know when God changed my life something happened on the inside of me that's never happened before
