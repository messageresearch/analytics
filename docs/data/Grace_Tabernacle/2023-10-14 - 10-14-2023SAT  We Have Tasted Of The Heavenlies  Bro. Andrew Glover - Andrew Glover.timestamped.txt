[40:23] many loves Paul's writings amen he said
[40:26] say here in Hebrews 6 and verse one he
[40:28] says now therefore leaving the
[40:31] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[40:33] us go on unto Perfection oh yeah not
[40:37] laying again the foundation of
[40:39] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[40:41] toward God but of the doctrine of the
[40:43] baptism and of laying on of hands and of
[40:46] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[40:48] judgment now watch this next verse and
[40:51] this we will do if God permits so Paul
[40:54] here is exhorting to see spiritual
[40:56] progress so not staying where they were
[40:59] but moving forward now watch here in
[41:01] verse four for it is impossible for
[41:04] those who were once enlightened and have
[41:06] tasted of the Heavenly gift how many's
[41:09] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[41:11] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[41:14] have tasted the good word of God and the
[41:17] powers of the world to come now watch
[41:19] this if they shall fall away to renew
[41:22] them again under repentance seeing they
[41:24] crucify to the themselves sells the Son
[41:26] of God aresh and put him to an open
[41:29] shame for the Earth which drinketh in
[41:32] rain that cometh off upon it and
[41:34] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[41:37] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[41:39] from God but that which beare thorns and
[41:42] briers is rejected and is nigh un
[41:45] cursing whose end is to be burned now
[41:48] watch verse n but beloved we are
[41:52] persuaded better things of you oh yeah
[41:55] amen I believe you speak speak to us
[41:56] tonight amen we are persuaded of better
[41:59] things of you and things that accompany
[42:02] salvation though we thus speak amen we
[42:05] ask the Lord this evening to bless the
[42:07] reading of his word as you can have your
[42:08] seats this afternoon for a few moments I
[42:11] want you by the help of the Lord to
[42:12] speak to you tonight out of these
[42:14] scriptures and if I will title this
[42:15] sermon tonight I want to speak to you on
[42:17] we have tasted of the heavenlies amen we
[42:21] have tasted of the heavenlies I believe
[42:23] here as Paul said in Hebrews 6 he said
[42:26] that tasted of the Heavenly gift we have
[42:28] tasted of the good word of God we have
[42:31] tasted of the powers of the world that
[42:33] is to come
[42:34] now that word tasted it means to try the
[42:38] flavor of to taste it means to perceive
[42:40] the flavor of it means to partake of to
[42:43] enjoy to feel to make trial of to
[42:46] experience to take food to eat Amen to
[42:49] take nourishment so here we're finding
[42:51] out that some amen tasted and when they
[42:54] tasted they went backwards amen but then
[42:57] there was some that tasted and they
[42:58] didn't go backwards but they went
[43:00] forward and you know I believe here this
[43:02] week amen every service every song every
[43:05] word that's been said amen I believe
[43:07] that we have tasted of the goodness of
[43:09] God how many can testify that we have
[43:11] tasted of the goodness of God Amen
[43:13] brother says it like this and turning
[43:15] northward he said that's just the way it
[43:16] is he said when I get a taste of God
[43:19] when the Holy Ghost comes into the
[43:20] meeting that's good but I want more of
[43:22] it amen amen it's good to taste it on

[43:38] Fountain amen of Truth amen when the
[43:41] Holy Ghost comes in the meeting that's
[43:43] good but I want more of it see amen and
[43:45] there's more of it because he promised
[43:47] that every Redemptive blessing is ours
[43:50] how many are redeemed here tonight then
[43:52] if you are redeemed every Redemptive
[43:55] blessing belongs to you amen as a son
[43:58] and daughter of almighty God Amen as we
[44:00] so beautifully heard last night that we
[44:02] as a human amen we have an inner man we
[44:05] have an outer man and the outer man has
[44:07] five senses amen and the inner man has
[44:10] five senses amen and the Inner Man and
[44:12] the outer man is contacted amen by those
[44:15] five senses of our Earthly home but you
[44:17] know I love here in Psalms 34:8 these
[44:20] two scriptures have just been have just
[44:22] been ringing in my heart in Psalms 348
[44:24] David said oh and see amen that the Lord
[44:28] is good amen blessed is the man amen
[44:31] that trusteth in him in the New
[44:33] Testament Jesus says in Mark 9 verse1 he
[44:36] said unto them verily I say unto you

[44:41] here amen which shall not taste the
[44:44] death amen though they have seen the
[44:46] kingdom of God Amen come with power now

[45:12] uncertain amen listen the world today is
[45:15] full of Uncertain sounds amen but we are
[45:18] not following an uncertain sound we are
[45:20] fallowing a Vindicated sound and it's
[45:23] not a sound to go back it's a sound to
[45:25] go for and I don't think church we got
[45:28] to keep going through the motions amen
[45:30] and going through recycle services and
[45:32] going through Cycles but I believe I'm
[45:35] talking to people tonight that have
[45:37] heard a certain sound and they have
[45:39] recognized that they're anointed to
[45:41] break the cycle of Revival and death and
[45:44] move forward I want to tell the devil
[45:46] there's some people here in this meeting
[45:48] amen that got to touch from God and
[45:50] they'll never go back to the things of
[45:52] the world there's some people here in
[45:54] this tent now that God tou from God and
[45:57] they'll never desire the things way I to
[46:00] see it amen because they tasted of the
[46:02] goodness of God Amen and they know that
[46:04] it's something more than a feeling it's
[46:06] something more than a sensation
[46:08] something more than an emotion something
[46:10] more than a tradition it's something
[46:12] more than a religion it is an experience
[46:15] amen of the goodness of God I don't know

[46:38] you have tasted of the goodness of God
[46:41] Amen I know there's a lot of uncertainty
[46:42] but there's one thing that's not
[46:44] uncertain and that is the goodness of

[46:52] there's all kinds of things uncertain he
[46:54] said is there anything thing that's
[46:56] certain he said yes he said the word of
[46:59] God he said now they say the old slogan
[47:01] that there's two things that's certain
[47:02] one is taxes and the other one is death
[47:05] he said now death isn't certain no
[47:07] indeed amen there might be a Rapture
[47:10] amen there might be a Rapture then
[47:12] there's no death amen death ain't too
[47:15] certain no amen not in this day it was
[47:17] many years ago amen but not now death is
[47:21] not too certain do you realize friends

[47:28] and step into eternity I'm just going to
[47:31] preach and certain night do you realize
[47:33] in this meeting that loved ones amen
[47:35] could come walking through this tent in
[47:37] just a moment and your eyes could see
[47:40] them and you would know that in just a
[47:41] few moments things are going to begin to
[47:43] change listen we're not just having
[47:45] church services we're not just gathering
[47:47] together and singing a few songs but
[47:50] dimensions are blending together in one
[47:53] of these days time is going to give away
[47:55] to
[47:56] and Corruption is going to get we and
[47:58] incorruption and the old is going to
[48:00] become new and the dead are going to
[48:02] raise and listen I believe it can happen
[48:05] right here tonight amen I believe we
[48:07] have tasted of something that could take
[48:09] us from this world into the next World
[48:11] am then death is not too certain under
[48:13] this
[48:14] message there is a promise of a Rapture
[48:18] I love how how Webster defines this
[48:20] y'all preaching me and I a even lay the
[48:22] foundation amen Webster defines this
[48:24] word taste he says it is to ass certain
[48:26] the flavor of Amen by taking a little
[48:29] into the mouth Amen to eat or drink
[48:32] especially in small quantities to
[48:34] perceive or recognize amen it's if by
[48:37] the sense of taste I love this
[48:39] definition it is to become acquainted
[48:41] with by experience amen so when you
[48:44] taste something you are coming
[48:46] acquainted with it by experience it is a
[48:48] sensation of came from a substance Amen
[48:51] in the mouth that is typically produced
[48:53] amen by the stimulation of the of taste
[48:56] combined a with those of touch and smell
[48:59] amen when you taste something amen
[49:01] you're moving beyond just smelling it
[49:03] when you taste something you're moving
[49:04] beyond just seeing it amen but now
[49:07] you're becoming acquainted with it amen
[49:09] by the experience of partaking of it but
[49:12] said there's something about a man or
[49:13] woman that ever tasted of Jesus Christ
[49:16] amen they can't taste the world no more
[49:18] amen they will spit out every time he
[49:21] said I'm so glad that we have a heavenly
[49:23] father that if we'll just permit him he
[49:25] will place us in a place where the
[49:27] devil's house and all the whiskey and
[49:29] night clubes can never touch us amen we
[49:31] are far beyond the screams of this world
[49:34] and all of its pop and all of its
[49:35] worldly mixture and all of its FAL
[49:38] Fanatics amen if a man's ever tasted of
[49:40] that good gift of God Amen these things
[49:43] become As Dead As midnight I tell you
[49:46] what's happened here this weekend amen
[49:48] the things of the world has become dead
[49:51] amen and the things of God have become a
[49:54] reality in your heart listen I believe
[49:56] that depression has died here this
[49:58] weekend I believe that cancer has died
[50:01] here this weekend I believe that fears
[50:03] and complexes and family curses and
[50:05] generational curses and church problems
[50:08] and church situation I believe they di
[50:11] here this weekend and there is still a
[50:13] resurrection of the reality of Jesus
[50:15] Christ if a man or woman itates to the
[50:18] things of God the world is dead to him
[50:21] they'll never think about it
[50:24] again
[50:25] acquainted we are acquainted amen by
[50:28] experience amen you know what Daniel
[50:30] 11:32 says it says that such as the
[50:33] wickedly against the Covenant shall be
[50:35] corrupt by flatteries amen but the
[50:37] people how many people do we have here
[50:39] but the people brother Vernon that do
[50:41] know their God they shall be strong and
[50:44] do exploits the people that do know
[50:47] their God Amen shall be strong and do
[50:50] exploits somebody say we know our God we
[50:53] know our God the people that know their
[50:56] God shall be strong and do great
[50:58] exploits but said what if in the morning
[51:00] or tonight sometime you would happen to
[51:02] turn over and feel a real strange pain
[51:04] in your side you'd happen to say oh what
[51:06] is this you'd call for the doctor the
[51:08] Pain's going down your side and then the
[51:10] doctor says heart attack just a few more
[51:12] minutes he said then what was about this
[51:15] experience of being born again he said
[51:18] what about knowing Jesus Oh you say well
[51:20] I know the mayor of the city and I'm
[51:22] acquainted with a pastor that ain't what
[51:23] I'm talking about what about being born
[51:26] again and knowing Jesus amen don't you
[51:28] guess at it just don't imagine you are
[51:31] amen but you must be born again and I
[51:33] don't mean a fanatical emotional mental
[51:35] workup he said I mean a real experience
[51:39] amen I mean a real experience in other
[51:42] places said usually experience amen ACC
[51:44] companies faith and that's the reason
[51:46] usually it takes a person amen that is
[51:48] acquainted with Christ as the
[51:50] Forgiveness of their sins Amen to know
[51:53] that he's forgiven you amen you had
[51:55] experience when you're born again amen
[51:57] then Christ forgave you and you know it
[52:01] I tell you why there's such a liberty in
[52:02] this T it's because there ain't a bunch
[52:04] of people hollering wondering if God
[52:07] forgive them there ain't a bunch of
[52:08] people shouting wondering if their sins
[52:10] are in the SE of forgetfulness amen but
[52:13] by the power of the Holy Ghost there is
[52:15] a revelation that is Dr in the M of
[52:18] their soul amen that their sins are
[52:20] annihilated amen their past is Forgiven
[52:23] they are redeemed and they're saved
[52:26] they're Sanctified they're sealed by the
[52:28] Holy Ghost and the devil couldn't get
[52:30] you if he had
[52:32] to we're not here shouting because we're
[52:35] we're guesting and shouting we're
[52:36] shouting because we know amen that
[52:38] Christ has forgiven us therefore with
[52:40] that experience amen it's easy then for
[52:43] you to believe God Amen for anything
[52:45] that he promised when you've had an
[52:47] experience it's easy to believe God for
[52:50] anything that he's promised you listen
[52:53] some of you all believe for salvation
[52:55] and the devil said that's as much as you
[52:56] can believe for amen but what about last
[52:58] night what about breaking Beyond amen
[53:01] just believing for one pain or believing
[53:03] for two things we believing for three
[53:05] things listen I'm going to preach
[53:06] tonight I believe it's time to start
[53:08] believing for the Rapture I think it's
[53:10] time to start what the devil tell us
[53:12] amen that this is the way things will
[53:14] always be amen this world is coming to
[53:17] an end America is on the way down
[53:19] politics are falling apart amen but
[53:22] there is a revelation of the Rapture
[53:24] that is sing on this generation that
[53:26] some morning she not taste de but she
[53:29] will taste the supper of the marriage of
[53:31] the lamb and she will go
[53:34] there the world is falling apart but
[53:37] there's a bride that is coming together
[53:39] if you ever become acquainted with God
[53:41] and then then you can take anything his
[53:44] word says and you all know there's a
[53:46] natural man that has a natural diet and
[53:48] there's a spiritual man that has a
[53:50] spiritual gu you know the prophet said
[53:52] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word I'm
[53:55] going to go and preach to you tonight

[53:59] some miraculous things for you in these
[54:00] meetings amen God answered questions he
[54:03] broke chains he broke addictions amen he
[54:06] give a lot in your future listen you
[54:08] cannot stop amen and just say well God

[54:20] Amen on Heavenly things you cannot feed
[54:23] an Earthly experience with Heavenly Man

[1:05:03] servants the
[1:05:05] prophets that's Revelation 10:7 right
[1:05:08] amen don't just leave it in Christ
[1:05:09] Revelation 101 and the seventh angel
[1:05:11] Revelation 10:7 let's go on to verse 8
[1:05:14] and the Bible says and the voice which I
[1:05:16] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:05:18] and said go and take the little book
[1:05:21] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:05:23] which stand upon the sea and upon the
[1:05:25] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:05:28] unto him amen give me the little book
[1:05:30] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:05:33] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:05:35] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:05:39] honey it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:05:42] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:05:44] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:05:46] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:05:49] soon as I'd eaten it amen my belly was
[1:05:52] bitter and he said to me th must
[1:05:54] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:05:57] Nations remember said this seventh book
[1:06:00] of seven Redemption plans has been
[1:06:02] brought to us he said it's what the book
[1:06:04] holds he said now we're going to get
[1:06:06] over in the 10th chapter here where the
[1:06:08] mighty Angel proclaimed something he had
[1:06:10] a little book that John had to eat and
[1:06:12] when he did it got in his belly and it
[1:06:14] was bitter amen but in his lips it was
[1:06:16] sweet when he begin to partake in this
[1:06:19] book am me it was sweet in his mouth but
[1:06:21] when it hit his stomach it was bitter
[1:06:24] said now watch he said when you have to
[1:06:26] digest it then it gets bitter
[1:06:28] everybody's against you everybody's
[1:06:29] telling you you're a Holy Roller you're
[1:06:31] M out of the other Senor off your head
[1:06:33] it's hard to digest but when you're
[1:06:35] testifying of his glory it's sweet in
[1:06:38] your lips and when you stand up in a
[1:06:40] meeting when you stand up in a meeting
[1:06:42] and say glory to God hallelujah he said
[1:06:45] when you're going through that great
[1:06:46] Siege it's hard but then when you're out
[1:06:48] of that great Siege you can testify of
[1:06:51] it amen because then it's sweet in the
[1:06:54] what is it church it's the book of
[1:06:56] redemption amen I love what the Bible
[1:06:58] says that David I'm going somewhere
[1:07:01] David had a script bag and in the script
[1:07:03] bag he had some rocks and on those rocks
[1:07:05] he put some honey on them and the prise
[1:07:07] said when the Sheep would get sick they
[1:07:09] would put honey on that rock it was a
[1:07:11] limestone Rock and those sick sheep
[1:07:14] would go to licking on that rock he said
[1:07:16] that's what we need to do tonight he
[1:07:18] said let's put this honey on Christ and
[1:07:20] not on some church
[1:07:21] either he said it'll go on where it
[1:07:24] belongs on and will'll lick on him
[1:07:26] Hallelujah he said they need healing if
[1:07:29] there's any virtue if there's any power
[1:07:31] if there's any praise it belongs to him
[1:07:33] that's right on Christ the solid rock I
[1:07:35] stand amen and The Rock played a great
[1:07:38] part in it
[1:07:39] too oh yeah so the Rock and the Honey
[1:07:42] played a great part together because in
[1:07:44] the Bible the rock represents the
[1:07:48] Revelation in the Bible the rock
[1:07:50] represents the Revelation and the Honey
[1:07:53] represents the holy goost that goes on
[1:07:55] the Rock oh my and the prophet said
[1:07:58] there's nothing as powerful as
[1:08:00] Revelation can I ask you something why
[1:08:02] is our young people such a powerful
[1:08:04] young people why are our churches such
[1:08:06] powerful churches I'll tell you why amen
[1:08:09] because they're feeding on a powerful
[1:08:11] Revelation and that Revelation is
[1:08:14] releasing a vitamin in them that's
[1:08:16] giving them a strength am me to be more
[1:08:18] than just a Christian Camp to be more
[1:08:21] than just a Christian in church but it's
[1:08:23] giving them a strength
[1:08:24] to be a Christian on their good days and
[1:08:26] on their bad days on their up days on
[1:08:29] their down days can I just make a
[1:08:30] declaration here I am a Son of God on my
[1:08:33] good days and I'm a Son of God on my bad
[1:08:36] days I'm a Son of God when I'm sick but
[1:08:39] I'm a Son of God when I'm well I'm a Son
[1:08:41] of God when I'm rich I'm a Son of God
[1:08:43] when I'm broke I'm a Son of God when
[1:08:45] things are going good and I'm a Son of
[1:08:47] God when things are falling back amen my
[1:08:50] sunship is not resting upon the
[1:08:52] condition of this Earth and world I have
[1:08:55] tasted of a Heavenly food I eat of a
[1:08:58] Heavenly Man I tasted the good word of
[1:09:00] God I'm feing upon the power of the
[1:09:02] world to come and it's releasing
[1:09:04] something in me that's causing me to
[1:09:06] walk by faith and not by sight it's
[1:09:09] causing me to trust God when I have
[1:09:11] every reason to doubt God it's a
[1:09:14] revelation it's a perfect Revelation
[1:09:16] where say oh my there is nothing in such
[1:09:18] prevailing power as the revelation of
[1:09:21] the word so when you begin to feed on
[1:09:23] this re
[1:09:24] this revelation will bring you amen from
[1:09:26] drifting to
[1:09:28] stability this revelation will bring you
[1:09:31] amen from going this way and that way to
[1:09:33] set I love what Paul says if you then be
[1:09:36] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:09:38] which are above where Christ sth on the
[1:09:41] right hand of God Amen set your
[1:09:43] affection on things above and not on
[1:09:45] things on the earth for ye are dead amen
[1:09:48] Lord give us Grace we are dead and your
[1:09:51] life is hid with Christ in God when
[1:09:53] Christ who is our life shall appear then
[1:09:57] shall ye also appear with him in glory
[1:10:00] said it's the time amen that we ought to
[1:10:02] be Heavenly set somebody say heavenly
[1:10:04] set we ought to be Heavenly set till the
[1:10:07] world seems dull and dingy and dirty
[1:10:10] another place you said we are preparing
[1:10:12] people amen we're getting them lighted
[1:10:14] unburned from the things of the world
[1:10:16] Amen getting their souls amen set in the
[1:10:19] presence of God that when Jesus does
[1:10:22] appear the second time in glory those
[1:10:24] who are ready will Rapture and be C up
[1:10:28] together to meet him in the air and be
[1:10:31] with
[1:10:32] him is't that beautiful we're getting
[1:10:35] the church unburdened L to get him ready
[1:10:38] for the Rapture I love the prophetic
[1:10:40] instructions he gives us in Israel and
[1:10:41] the church he said now be careful and
[1:10:44] you be s in the word the other place he
[1:10:46] said don't be tossed about with every
[1:10:48] wind of Doctrine you believe God's word
[1:10:51] you get stable and you get set and when
[1:10:53] you look at this word Heavenly that word
[1:10:55] Heavenly is relating to the heaven amen
[1:10:57] or the heavens amen Divine suggesting
[1:11:01] amen the Blessed state of Heaven do you
[1:11:03] all realize that Jesus in the prayer to
[1:11:05] the father he said these words he said
[1:11:07] father let thy kingdom come let thy will
[1:11:10] be done Amen on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:11:14] amen so in other words he was saying
[1:11:16] that there was a people who would not
[1:11:18] have to wait till they died and went to
[1:11:20] heaven to enjoy heaven but there would
[1:11:22] be a people on ins Side of Heaven that
[1:11:25] would be enjoying the Blessed Spate of
[1:11:27] Heaven and the only way they would be
[1:11:29] enjoying it amen was that God would send
[1:11:31] a prophet who would break the
[1:11:33] traditional view of heaven and would
[1:11:35] bring a revelation view of heaven and
[1:11:37] would say heaven is a place that's real
[1:11:39] he would say I believe it's not the
[1:11:41] place the churches talked about where
[1:11:43] the oldtime said we went to heaven and
[1:11:45] we played up on a harp and we set up
[1:11:47] clouds No they knew there was a place
[1:11:49] called Heaven amen but they didn't know
[1:11:50] what it was he said it isn't playing
[1:11:52] Harps he said said but what a conception
[1:11:54] that was amen before they had the
[1:11:56] fullness of the word come into existence
[1:11:59] or the opening of The Seven Seals amen
[1:12:01] that promised to us in this age amen
[1:12:04] then we would understand he says I
[1:12:06] believe that heaven is a real place can
[1:12:09] I get a witness here tonight that
[1:12:11] believes Heaven is a real place it's
[1:12:13] just the same as this real place amen
[1:12:16] where God started us in our spiritual
[1:12:18] growth in this place and I believe that
[1:12:20] heaven is a place that's just as real as
[1:12:23] this where we don't sit up there for
[1:12:24] eternity and just sit around on a cloud
[1:12:27] amen so Heaven is a real place and Paul
[1:12:30] said amen let us go on into Perfection
[1:12:33] amen then tell me what is perfection
[1:12:35] Heaven is perfection and Perfection is
[1:12:38] heaven so Paul was saying there's
[1:12:40] somebody who's going to break the cycle
[1:12:42] they're not just going to keep going for
[1:12:44] the Motions they're not just going to
[1:12:45] keep going to Services they're not just
[1:12:47] going to keep hearing sermons amen but
[1:12:49] they're literally going to grow they're
[1:12:51] going to progress come on church we we
[1:12:53] got to move on we cannot stay where we
[1:12:55] are we got to go
[1:12:57] forward are you hearing me we got to go
[1:13:00] forward it's hard for the time but we
[1:13:01] got to go forward because we cannot stay
[1:13:04] in the same place we'll drop up and die
[1:13:07] but we got to keep on moving forward so
[1:13:09] when we going to we're going to
[1:13:12] heaven heaven is a real place in the
[1:13:15] adoption series but I'm said like this
[1:13:17] he said your adoption is not your birth
[1:13:19] he said your adoption is your placing he
[1:13:22] said we were born the spirit of we were
[1:13:23] sons of God Amen we were predestinated
[1:13:26] he said for this son the last day we
[1:13:28] were predestinated unto adoption now
[1:13:31] here we are this hurts Pentecostal amen
[1:13:33] but they say I got born again praise the
[1:13:35] Lord God the Holy Ghost F you're a child
[1:13:37] of God but yet that ain't what I'm
[1:13:39] talking about amen see you were
[1:13:41] predestinated unto adoption amen and
[1:13:44] adoption is the placing of a son come on
[1:13:47] church because the prophet emphatically
[1:13:50] teaches amen that the believer's
[1:13:52] position in CHR
[1:13:54] is Heavenly places the believer's
[1:13:57] position in Christ is not in depression
[1:14:00] it's not in condemnation it's not in
[1:14:02] guilt it's not in fear it's not in
[1:14:05] anxiety come on now it's not just in a
[1:14:08] Pew on a Sunday morning but the
[1:14:11] believer's position is in Christ and
[1:14:14] that is in Heavenly places see then this
[1:14:16] bribe by an adoption message has been
[1:14:19] positionally placed in the heavenlies I
[1:14:22] love what the prop says in the countdown
[1:14:24] he said the position of the church
[1:14:26] should be plumbed into the heavenlies
[1:14:29] not down here floating around through
[1:14:30] the clouds and buzzing around like an
[1:14:32] airplane amen but something that's
[1:14:34] propelled by something that seem be on
[1:14:37] anything that an airplane can think of
[1:14:39] Amen it's an astronaut brother went hit
[1:14:41] it last night it's an astronaut in

[1:14:59] place in the airplane we got to climb up
[1:15:02] we got to climb up into our position and
[1:15:05] our position is an
[1:15:08] astronaut he said that's the age we're
[1:15:10] living in right now somebody say now
[1:15:12] we're living in right now is spiritual
[1:15:15] astronauts he said see live in the
[1:15:17] heavenlies not visit the heavenlies not
[1:15:20] just read about the heavenlies not just
[1:15:22] sing about the heavenli amen but live in
[1:15:26] the heavenli oh carry yourself away so

[1:16:12] we were we have been saved by grace it's
[1:16:15] time to lay aside the condemnation it's
[1:16:18] time to lay aside it's time to go follow

[1:22:16] Heavenly you got to get less Earthly and
[1:22:18] more Heavenly said people become so
[1:22:21] Earthbound amen just like this was the
[1:22:23] only place there was but there's a
[1:22:24] Heavenly world it's all around us too do
[1:22:28] you realize in Ephesians one what Paul's
[1:22:30] is okay to preach what Paul was doing in
[1:22:33] Ephesians 1 he said it like this he said
[1:22:35] to move from Earthbound Corinthians to
[1:22:38] heavenbound Ephesians do you realize we
[1:22:41] are not promised another
[1:22:44] Corinthians we are promised another
[1:22:47] Ephesians we are not promised another
[1:22:49] Corinthians we are promised another
[1:22:52] Ephesians
[1:22:53] in other words the Corinthians were
[1:22:54] Earthbound because they were living by
[1:22:56] Vision they were living by song they
[1:22:59] were living by a dream somebody was out
[1:23:01] praying and they saw something in the
[1:23:03] air and they come to church and that
[1:23:05] become the direction so Paul never could
[1:23:07] bring them to a Heavenly manner because
[1:23:10] they were too Earthbound so what he done
[1:23:12] was he come to Ephesians and begin to
[1:23:15] teach him predestination he begin to
[1:23:17] teach him election he begin to teach him
[1:23:19] inheritance he begin to teach him things
[1:23:21] amen that would so the Corinthians would
[1:23:24] feed the Ephesians that I'm talking
[1:23:26] about a message it choke the Baptist it
[1:23:29] choke the
[1:23:31] P around this but to the and daugh of
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:43] Fe listen I think it's time to
[1:23:46] move I think it's time to move I think
[1:23:49] it's time to move from where life was
[1:23:51] from where life is
[1:23:55] move from where life was brother bur
[1:23:57] into where life is if you stay where
[1:24:00] life was you're going to die if you stay
[1:24:02] where God was you're going to
[1:24:04] die but let us go
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:09] on you realize to move forward you're
[1:24:11] going to be an
[1:24:13] oddball you're literally going to be an
[1:24:15] oddball to move forward until everybody
[1:24:19] accepts
[1:24:21] it come on until everybody accepts it
[1:24:25] you're going to be odd then when
[1:24:27] everybody y'all remember cell
[1:24:31] phones years ago funniest thing somebody
[1:24:34] carry a cell phone well they're just
[1:24:35] trying to be something they're just odd
[1:24:38] they're just they just got they just got
[1:24:40] too big for their bres they just think
[1:24:42] there's something important now cuz
[1:24:43] they're carrying a cell phone and so
[1:24:45] somebody had to step out and they had to
[1:24:47] Bear the reproach of carrying something
[1:24:50] that the majority was not accepting
[1:24:52] but there was a power behind it can I
[1:24:55] just take some Liberty here and say
[1:24:57] thank God for our elders around this
[1:24:59] message who advaned to where life was
[1:25:02] instead of staying where life
[1:25:04] was they Advanced and they had to step
[1:25:06] up and you give me some but I want to
[1:25:08] say this publicly I want to say thank
[1:25:10] God for our Ed bll amen he stepped out
[1:25:13] and begin to say there's more to this
[1:25:15] thing than just sitting around a campire
[1:25:18] talking about stories and God Prophet
[1:25:21] but this is the reveal
[1:25:24] this is the resurrection of the that's
[1:25:26] crucified has come
[1:25:30] our thank God for our elders who on our
[1:25:33] foods and they Mar through ideas and
[1:25:36] they Mar through criticism to preach us

[1:25:42] for I'm going to bring it right in this
[1:25:43] P they fought all hell young people to
[1:25:46] get this message to you and don't you
[1:25:48] let some devil water this message down
[1:25:51] to just a bunch of scaming har and I
[1:25:55] believe in all of it that this message
[1:25:57] is the call of the that Jesus Christ he
[1:26:01] is the election of
[1:26:03] God there's more to this
[1:26:07] thing life was where come on some Harley
[1:26:12] talking last night amen 60 years ago
[1:26:14] amen life was God said a prophet God
[1:26:17] sent a prophet thank you for sharing
[1:26:18] those things with me last night God sent
[1:26:20] a prophet but now where life is is you
[1:26:23] are what the prophet was sent
[1:26:27] for so either we stay back here talking
[1:26:30] about hun stories and brother so and so
[1:26:33] and brother so and so step forward and
[1:26:36] go on into
[1:26:38] Perfection either we stay back there and
[1:26:41] eat dead stories or we start eating the
[1:26:44] Heavenly
[1:26:47] manner it'll take us to Perfection you
[1:26:49] better get out of all those stories we
[1:26:51] thank God form but that's not the vision
[1:26:53] for the bride the vision for the bride
[1:26:56] is thus saith the seventh
[1:27:00] angel yes sir Andrew what are you saying
[1:27:02] you all know I'm telling the truth it
[1:27:04] was odd till it was
[1:27:05] accepted but when it was accepted
[1:27:08] everybody wanted a part of
[1:27:10] it come on 10 years ago 15 years ago get
[1:27:15] out somewhere and be lost and get your
[1:27:17] phone out get on your GPS find where
[1:27:19] you're at and somebody that was still
[1:27:21] stuck with life was pulled their Atlas
[1:27:25] out and flipp through the atlas and you
[1:27:28] was in Alabama and they was in
[1:27:30] Arkansas why it worked in it day but now
[1:27:34] we've
[1:27:35] Advanced all right come on church that's
[1:27:38] why we're no longer having meetings that
[1:27:40] we're having to work five services to
[1:27:42] finally get a breakthrough on the 6
[1:27:44] nights because there's a word that has
[1:27:46] come into the church and it's a word of
[1:27:48] perfection it's not a de letter it's not
[1:27:51] a bunch of de work it's not beat the
[1:27:53] altar it's believing that you're in
[1:27:56] Christ already it's believing that if
[1:27:58] you ever was a Son of God you always was
[1:28:01] a Son of God it's believe that you're
[1:28:03] not going to become one you always were
[1:28:06] one you got to move out of the Earthly
[1:28:08] into the Heavenly things father God said
[1:28:11] like this he said move out there that we
[1:28:13] might see somebody say see the invisible
[1:28:16] God I think that's amazing cuz it almost
[1:28:18] sounds like a contradicting statement
[1:28:20] see the invisible I God he said the word
[1:28:23] was invisible until it was made flesh
[1:28:25] and then the word become visible and
[1:28:28] through his sacrificial death at Calvary
[1:28:30] his resurrection he positionally placed
[1:28:33] his church in that realm that the same
[1:28:36] invisible God could come into the
[1:28:39] individual and make the word
[1:28:43] visible let us go on under Perfection
[1:28:46] let us go on into that realm where the
[1:28:48] invisible God comes into the individual
[1:28:51] and makes his word visible ver said what
[1:28:53] is that Holy Spirit then it's the isap
[1:28:56] it's the spiritual revelation of the
[1:28:58] word the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] itself but how many can agree with me
[1:29:04] that this is where're right the Holy
[1:29:07] Ghost itself amen not just a baptism but
[1:29:12] the person the Holy Ghost itself now
[1:29:15] listen there's been some awful cool dras
[1:29:17] for says that's come through these
[1:29:18] cracked walls he said like I was a kid
[1:29:21] mama would take that Kung to get the
[1:29:23] matter out of her eyes he said listen
[1:29:25] I'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen
[1:29:27] shut and she's blind to what God has for
[1:29:30] her she needs some hot oil the spirit of
[1:29:32] God unless she receives the spirit of
[1:29:35] God she will go on Su program for power
[1:29:38] and Creed for word he said receive the
[1:29:41] Holy Spirit and let him do the
[1:29:43] explaining he wrote the book he can tell
[1:29:46] you what's in it and what it means you
[1:29:48] know what I believe I believe that this
