forever more amen praise the Lord and it's so good to know him as a living God Amen and so good to serve him am I'm I'm I'm so thankful that I can be or stand here today and say I'm a Christian born again filled with the Holy Ghost on my way to heaven we're privileged and I often times we don't we don't realize how privileged we are we're we're we're in battles we're in struggles we're in fights and the life of a Christian is not a a flowery bed of ease but it's worth every bit of it every battle you face everything that you go through it's worth every bit of it and we look at what he did for us and what he went through for us is worth it amen amen don't you love the Lord Jesus amen it's so wonderful Amen to to know him and say God bless you to each one of you it's good to be with you and appreciate brother Matt and his uh kindness and uh you know inviting us to be with you and um we we're just uh passing through here we was coming as I think he said we was here to do a little bit of work and things and I told him I said we worked one time today and one and one way and now we're here working again amen praise the Lord but amen and this labor as the Bible says your labor in the Lord is not in vain all of our other labors you know someday is going to burn up and it's going to be gone but anything that we do in God's kingdom that will remain and so you live your life especially young people however much time we got left we don't know but as long as you're here here if you would focus your life on that and think everything that I do in God's kingdom my treasures are being laid up somewhere and they're going to meet me on the other side my treasures here are going to burn everything I labor for here is just we're just passing through we're we're just passing through this land we're on our way home amen and so we we we certainly uh are our privilege to to serve the Lord and to love him let's just before we go to the scripture let's just bow our hearts before the Lord and as we bow our hearts if you have a need upon your heart if you just take that before the Lord as we go to prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just bow our hearts before you and we know the songs of worship and praise have come forth Lord and surely your people have entered into that place and that atmosphere of worship and we now Lord approach your word which is the most important part and Lord we're all together insufficient Lord as a a man to to try to handle this word but Lord our sufficiency is in you and God we're asking Lord that you would bless Lord both the speaking and the hearing of your word and God that you would move Lord by your Spirit upon the needs of your children we know surely Lord that every heart that said I have a need every everyone that thought in their mind I've got this need Lord that you saw that you know that and God we're asking God that you would move for that one Lord father let Faith arise in our hearts to believe upon you Lord for that need and Lord Jesus that your blessings would be upon the remaining portion of this service we ask in Jesus Christ's precious name amen God bless you if you have your Bibles want to turn to Romans chapter 8 we're going to read the first two verses there of scripture and then we'll let you be seated and you know so often you've you've been in church enough to hear this over and over it's just a simple thought well I I'm I'm just going to say that one more time this is just a simple thought but I do know that God hides himself in Simplicity and he reveals himself in the same so if if you hear that and somebody says that well you know that God hides in those places too Romans 81 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death amen God bless you you can be seated amen we well it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord Lord and I believe every Christian feels the same way you know the prophet tells us that you don't have to tell them people to go to church he said they'll go through rain they'll go through snow they'll go through all kinds of things to be there because they they love church amen it's a it's a part of a Christian's life amen that we we need God and we I'm not ashamed to say I need more of him amen I'm not ashamed to stand before you and say I have not yet arrived yet amen we're we're we're we're not on the other side yet so we all we're all still we're in this battle amen and every day you know you get out there among the world and you work and you you you go through your trials and things and you face the devil every day and you know you can get you can get blessed in the Lord you can get those Victory moments and times and and that you know the presence of God so strong and no sooner than you get out the door and you drive down the road and something happens and it this world has a way of just pulling it out of you amen it has a way of just seemingly just pulling it it's the age we live in the age we live in is the the most evil Age The Prophet tells us it's it's worse than any age that there ever was and it's it's the most deceptive age it's the darkest age amen but God always makes a provision for whatever we go through his people have never been without a provision so no matter what the devil would have God's got a provision for his people to meet the challenge of the day thank God for that amen he provided provides whatever our need is amen he provided for his children on their Journey whatever the need come amen God was the provider of that need he's still the same he didn't change whatever your need is God's made a provision for it whatever your struggle is God's made a provision for you amen you're not without amen but what we need is to appropriate the faith Amen to take a hold of the promise of God that we need in our day and our our hour what we're facing amen God's made a way for you but you need Faith to appropriate that to your life to reach out and say that's mine I'll take it amen praise the Lord and I believe we have uh received a message Amen to bring us back to the place where all the promises of God are yes and amen they're alive amen they're not dead amen praise the Lord amen so thankful we have amen the message of the hour because without that we would be a part of the chaos amen we'd be a part of Babylon and everything confusion and everything else but we sit here today by God's provision for us and we're not in confusion we're not a part of Babylon we're not a part of Leo DEA that's that's something apart from us amen but we've been called out of that amen unto a resurrection unto a living God Amen and to a provision amen that will keep us and bring us through amen and we will have Victory amen we will have Victory I may not be on the mountain right now I may be going through the valley but I promise you as I walk with God I will see the Mountaintop I'm going to see a Mountaintop Victory man as long as you keep your eyes on the Lord and you keep walking towards your promise you're going to see the victory amen it's a promise so I want to speak a little bit to you tonight the Lord with his help on a higher law and just to uh background this for a few short moments here and I've got way too many notes so by God's grace we're we're we're going to cut it short somewhere amen we won't keep you past two or three hours anyhow praise the lord well brother Bram say that all the time you listen T I trust you listen to your to the tapes every chance you get or the the the message amen but he say that so often well we ought to be out by mid night anyway and so amen that's a that's a good ice breaker amen praise the Lord so we we look at the laws of of Nature and and and the laws that we live by and the laws that God God created all that we have as far as as as the the creation itself we know it's a Satan's perverted so much of it and and so much of has been tampered with but but we look at the the the law La that we look at and and know that they laws like the law of gravity or the law of thermodynamics or the law of electricity and different discoveries and and how that you know man has studied these laws man has applied himself to learn these laws and to understand these laws and and applied himself to to take these laws and to use these laws to his advantage and these laws amen have you know for years the law of gravity had the had the uh had man under that law where he had no ability to do anything about gravity gravity had its hold on man and man could never overcome gravity but through the study of of these laws of nature that God made man began to understand there was other laws that he could apply uh with that law and this law and together using those laws would overcome the law of gravity he could take amen and discover how a wing uh air foil and and and discover uh aerodynamics and and discover how to cause with uh different fuels how to thermodynamics and combustion and things and develop an engine and cause propulsion to to drive that that that Wing through the air and then and then cause that that vehicle to to lift off you know what if the R Brothers had had had listen to everybody that said well that's gravity and we we man was not made to fly man can't go above the ground he's not made for it and if they'd have listened to that law and not pursued a higher law they'd have stayed on the ground they never tried to to find a way to go higher amen but there's something in a man that's different than all other creation amen because man was made in the image of God man is always looking for something better he's always trying to change his surroundings and change uh uh his environment and and make something better and and we're living in the age where it's it's it's very evident amen man has been able to successfully do so many things and so many you know even the medical uh world and how they can how they can do surgeries now that are totally uh without by Robotics and and on a video camera and and go through somebody told told me recently about some surgery they went through and it was totally uh didn't even open them up they just used a deal and went through the body and and was sewing things together and and fixing things and I thought man that's that's wonderful that's marvelous but that's Man by the tree of knowledge that's what man's been able to do by the tree of knowledge and and some of those things are are wonderful but we know the tree of knowledge can only go so high and we know that it comes to its end and brother R said when you come to your end on that just get on the tree of life and you keep going higher and higher and higher amen science can't go where you can go amen science can't see what you can see science doesn't understand what you see here today under the privilege of the opening of the word amen science don't understand what you understand you know the Unseen realm was the Unseen realm until a prophet came then that unseen realm became a seen realm that's right then that that that veil was taken off and those Devils amen that you are fighting and I fight we uncovered and made known and revealed amen that that's a devil that's troubling you that's because of something you did and something you didn't take care of and some sin in your life that you allowed that's why the devil's there and as long as that's there he has a right to remain he uncovered the work of the devil through a prophet to you and I that we can know EX exactly where we're standing and where the devil is and who he is and Satan don't like to be uncovered he don't like to be exposed but in this age he's been exposed and we know amen who he is and what he's doing and he's out Amen to do one thing and that's exactly what he did to Eve to cause her to disbelieve the word amen cause her to let go of the word and take something different from the word brother B tells us that's where we're at in this age amen this is kind of off to the side of everything but he tells us that's where we're at and the God of this evil age he said this age is to prove to Satan that this bride is not what Eve was she's not that type of woman she's not going to mix the word of God with anything praise the Lord that's what you're here for bride I'm speaking to the elect amen you sit here tonight and I'm a part of the Bride this is this is who we are amen we're here to prove to the devil we're not that kind of believer we're not going to mix it with anything amen but we're going to take it right with what the word amen that's been given to us and we won't vary from it praise the Lord amen a bride that's virtu is to Christ Christ is the word and she's done been United to Christ amen that's where we are today we've been United with Christ the word amen praise the Lord and it's bringing on a Rapture amen so this these laws of nature and and and as we said the laws different laws that Isaac Newton and different ones discovered and and built upon and and and and was passed on down Through the Ages and these laws have been transformed or utilized to to overcome other laws and and to realize amen that through these things there's been uh you know water has been harnessed to produce electricity and and fire and and things to make Steam and control you know to move a train down the tracks and all these things and we know these things have progressed to the end of this age amen it's it's all come down as the countdown in different places brother bam tells us you know man traveled by horse and buggy for Millennia until these last days amen he went from horse and buggy to an astronaut and these things are all telling us where we're at and we know that we're at the end time but this this gravity and and laws and things that that have held for centuries have been overcome amen and we know that the natural always types the spiritual amen we know that these things are not done in in in such a way that they have no meaning amen but if you look closely you can recognize the church amen needs to be progressing they're progressing we ought to be progressing they're they're they're they're manipulating things to their advantage and and gaining the knowledge well how much more ought we to be adding to our faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance coming on up into the fullness and the measure and the stature of Jesus Christ amen so we we have no place to settle down and relax amen it's human nature we want you know people work all their life to retire so they can do nothing amen but I don't know that God ever intended it to be like that amen I don't know that that was really the original uh uh plan of of God that man would just sit around and do nothing amen because there's no time for that amen we're we're in an army that's right and in this Army am me there's no retirement you don't get old and just sit and do nothing about it amen but every day amen you're to you're to be a reflection of the word of God you received amen you're to be a you're to be a lighthouse amen you're to be an example amen you're to be amen what others can look to and say there is a true brother in in in the Lord there's a real Overcomer right there praise the Lord so these laws that once held man and limited him are now being overcome in the restoration of the Bride tree brother Ram says you know a fish has a law and that fish can stand up here in the water and he has a law within him and if he'll just let go of that law that's in him he can sink Plumb to the Bottom of the Sea and it won't bother him a bit won't break one cell you tried to do it he said the law is not in you you can't do it but the fish can he deflates himself of that air such a way that he can and there's nothing in him to burst open he's made that way he knows it he can enforce that law to take Taking Plum to the Bottom of the Sea and then rais him back up again and a bird has a law now it's body it's material material Earthbound sits on the earth here but in it it it has a law within it and that's the way it spreads its wings it can fly Plum out of sight and that's against science they claim it's Earthbound gravitation has to hold it here but it can defy gravitation and lift itself right off of it and go right on out because it has to put that law that's in it to work and it's built to possess that law now I'm beginning to feel religious he says now we have a law and that law of life is in us and we don't the only thing you have to do you're made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God and you don't have to knck down to the devil so why do we ever knck down to the devil that's a good question amen because we don't have to do it in other words we got a choice in this we got a choice to let the devil run over us and step on us are we have a choice to say no sir I'm not going to sit back and be your floor man amen we've got a law and that's the law of the Holy Spirit and the only thing you know you have to do is know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all he said if that fish said wait I'll I'll catch my breath real good I'll bring up a little oxygen and me and I'll see if I can go go down no he doesn't uh he doesn't do that he would burst open see the bird say I'll see how fast I can run down here and and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control and how that law can control him that law controlling him and the same way it is with us if it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this and I don't get that that's not it it's to know the law of life is in you to know it's in you it's in me amen and you just let go and let God then he takes control he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours by letting go and letting God ain't that good amen that's good that you just let go because there's something in inside of you a law amen that you possess and it possesses you amen it's not just you possess it but it's got a hold of you amen that's different amen when it gets a hold of you that's different amen well I got a hold of God but one day he got a hold of me and when he got a hold of me everything changed amen so many people say well I I I I got a hold of God no you need to let God get a hold of you amen he gets a hold of you and it'll change your life it it'll change your thinking it'll change your actions it'll change your love amen it'll change everything about you amen he says now if the officer is going to take a fellow that stole your property and he was going to take him to court and you keep pulling him back and say well I just I don't know whether you should do this or or not he'll never get him there he'll never get him to the court he'll never get him to Justice just let him go and he said that's the way you do let Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up amen you got to let God do it got to let go and let that let God Amen have his way amen and he'll take care of it and since the fall of Man we know the law of death has been the greatest thing that's been held over us the law of sin and death and that's the thing that amen had man uh since the fall amen he he's he's never had an answer for it man man could never achieve it man could never never rise to the occasion to to meet the demands of the law of Moses he could never do it and we we know these things and and so it was a hopeless Affair but you know God in his sovereignty he didn't leave us without a witness but there was an Enoch just seven short Generations down the road that showed that there would be someday coming somehow that law of death would find its its match amen that there would be a law called life that would overcome that law of death amen and death would not have a hold on a people amen and Enoch testified of this through his life amen there's coming a day and a People amen that death is not going to stop them you know brother B was asked a question concerning you know uh how Elijah uh you know come back there in Revelation and and died and he said I I always the question I don't remember exactly but he he referred to that and somebody said what about Enoch and he said I've always wondered about that and and I was thinking you know but we've got to have a type we have to have a type Enoch was our type Elijah wasn't the type for us amen Elijah came back and died but there's got to be a people Enoch never had to come back and die so that testifies there's never been a people that hasn't died until this day amen praise the lord it's a perfect type it is a perfect type because he was a seventh from Adam and we're the Seventh Generation down the seven Church ages we're here amen this is the Enoch generation amen that's our type someday there's going to be a a people praise the lord they're just going to get up just like every other day their hearts going to be to serve the Lord it may not be flashing light nights people may not even know your name praise the Lord you might be a housewife you get up just to take care of your family and do what you always do serving the lord Faithfully oh but that'll be your last day amen it'll be your last day there won't be no more days of suffering and heartache and toils and troubles and stress and pressures upon you but it'll be the last day amen oh what a promise so God gave a glimpse that that law was going to meet its End Amen the law of Walking with God the author of life would produce a translation praise the Lord Enoch walked with God that's a part of it amen it's a daily walk amen it was Enoch that walked with God it didn't say nothing about Enoch's family but Enoch because it's a personal thing that you walk with God your family may not follow you amen your brother may not care about it Mom and Daddy may not believe it but you put yourself as an Enoch and you walk with God you make the choice hey you got a choice in this every day you get up I can be an Enoch today I can walk with God today amen I can overcome today greater is he that's in me than he that's in this world there's a spirit inside of me the spirit of life that's consuming me it's got a hold of me and I I can't get away from it it's consumed my life I can't get away from it can you testify to that something's got a hold of me and it's changing me day by day week by week amen year by year I'm not the same as I used to be I can look back and say thank God I'm not what I used to be I can join with Paul to say the life I once lived I don't live that way no more I don't think that way no more but God Has Changed Me amen praise the Lord amen Abraham and Sarah had their promise amen of bringing forth life but the law of death had a claim on them now law of death was working against them amen every day it was telling them that you're dying you look in the mirror and you're getting older you're getting weaker the promise seems further away anybody ever felt that way you believe in God for something and the promise seems further away not closer seems to be further away no doubt they battled Amen brother B would say it like this and we call ourselves the Seed of Abraham but we can't believe God for a few days or even a week or a month now we say great faith is getting the immediate results but I'd say that great faith is somebody that can hold on when everything's against you there's no signs to believe there's no there's no flashing thing happening there's no Pillar of Fire in your life amen and showing up amen there's no vision no dream no nothing but all you got a word to believe but I say blessed is he that takes the word of God and believes the word of God regardless of everything else you're going to see God Amen you're going to see God Amen when you consider not amen your situation the deadness of your own body and the deadness of your wife amen and and the the inability you know God puts a promises outside of the reach of man and man can't attain to them man can't make them happen man can't you can't force it amen but you got to let go and let God you got to believe amen God will do exactly what he said he'll do praise the Lord but there one day amen that law of death had to give way to the law of faith that was in Abraham and Sarah that they believed God regardless amen praise the Lord Death was wrapping him up ready to put him in the grave death thought he had a hold of him but he never had one claim on him no sir amen because why God has spoken a word concerning them amen they had a word concerning them that means if if you have a word concerning you and you have received a word from the Lord and you have had Revelation in your heart concerning your life and and whatever you're facing amen there's a word concerning you death ain't got a hold it don't have a claim on you amen nothing can hold you nothing can stop you amen there's nothing the devil can do to stop you and I as Believers as long as we hold on to the word of God God will keep that word to you praise the Lord amen oh my I'm not talking just from notes or or or Bible or or the message but I can talk from a personal amen experience of my own amen with God Amen I wouldn't be qualified to stand there and preach this word if I hadn't seen God do it but God will keep his word to you God will fulfill a promise to you amen for a testimony or two for Faith's sake cuz testimonies are good for Faith amen I I've seen testimonies used for the wrong thing and I'm not going to use them for the wrong thing I want to use them for one thing and that's for faith in your heart to God Amen and and I had an experience and I hadn't thought about it but today it come back to me and I thought well perhaps I I should share that but I had an experience one time that that I can't explain it but God Amen just the reality of who God is God's mindful of us God sees amen he he hears he he he knows all about what we're going through or what means something to us he's very intimately aware and I I had I was brand new in the ministry and I had been down to the church praying and just had a a wonderful time in prayer and I come out from that atmosphere and you know just as I was saying earlier you no longer get out from that atmosphere and who's there to to meet you and I I know more got out to my truck and I was driving down the the road there right by the church and the burden of something come on me that had been weighing on me heavy I was at the time uh in construction and we had built a couple of Speck houses me and another guy were partners and we had these and it was 2008 everything had fallen to uh horrible there in the fall of 2008 if you remember and construction it was a horrible deal and and so we had these two Speck houses we had one that had been on the market for several months and it was eaten away and you know we was having to pay all this interest and everything else and and then we had this other one that was finishing up and we was taking on these payments and stuff and it was getting kind of heavy and so there a burden and and and I I man I just come out from that atmosphere is all I can say the Lord had not it it wasn't away from me me and as I was driving down that road all I can testify to you is when I was driving down that weight of that that that those houses come on me and I thought oh you know I felt it come and I I heard myself speak just as you would under the anointing preaching does something come to me and I just spoke and I said I'll sign a contract tomorrow and I it caught me by surprise and I thought why did I say that I mean I Within Myself why did I say that I said it out loud nobody in the truck just said it out loud in the face of that devil that was there to torment me and and take the joy out of my life and take the victory out of my soul to weigh me down with the pressures of this life amen where I would had been down there to get away from that to get in the the presence of God and get the mind of God and so I spoke it and I thought well I don't know what it means but all I can do is just see what happens you know so that was a a Tuesday and the next morning I wasn't even thinking about it and I got up and I was driving to to work and the phone rang and it was early that morning and I had done for God about this woman had looked at the house like a week before and expressed interest in it and I done forgot she said she was going back home to Texas I thought she was gone I I I'll I'll testify to you the very first words out of that woman's mouth on the phone was we're leaving town today and I want to sign a contract on that house God's Hest truth because God cares and God's present and God hears and he understands what we're going through and I I I I went and and we we sat down with her and we made some deals on some things and then she kept pressing and I said no that's it was a fair deal and I told my partner afterwards I told him what happened he said wow he said well we shouldn't have given anything you know and I said no I wanted it to be fair but God spoke to me I mean he he he he revealed something there to me amen that if we would surrender oursel to the Lord there's just no telling what God would do amen another testimony that I I I want to speak to encourage your faith is holding on when everything's going bad and my wife and some of you you have probably know this but my wife uh suffered she went through uh breast cancer back in 2006 and and since then you know there's been a lot of things she's she's kind of went through and and and things I I don't know exactly when it started but she started having really bad headaches and these episodes would go for a week or two and then she'd be good for a while and then they'd go for a month and she she kept just progressively getting worse and we went and spent all kinds of money searching of course we were praying we were we were reaching out to the Lord the whole time but we were getting desperate and we spent I can't even tell you how much money that we spent going and looking and this doctor over here has an answer and this one has an answer and this one thinks he can help you and we went to multiple uh natural doctors multiple neurologists multiple all kinds of of things have a list of doctors we saw through the years that it it was brother Joe and sister Manny know and just constantly and we were looking for answers and looking for answers but always believ in God never quit believing God we know no matter what he's our healer and so we never ever give up my wife would be in bed for days with headache couldn't do anything couldn't take care of the family couldn't couldn't take care of herself couldn't take care of things miserable sad fighting depression struggling why am I here have I done something the Lord's not moving for me he's not answering my prayer what's wrong anybody ever been there Lord why why are you not hearing me why why is the answer not come we were there and I'm telling you it was a battle it's hard to convey just what how the devil would fight you and then I'd get up behind our pulpit and preach Christ is our healer by the grace of God never ever turn from that because God's word's true brother Braham said if I prayed for a thousand people and every one of them died I'd bring the next one up and pray because it's God's word God's word is true no matter what we see no matter what we experience we believe God Amen no matter what comes and what goes God's word is truth amen and so we we fought we struggled we we look for answers we we reached out we spent like I said traveled all over and looking for these things trying to get a mail everything that everybody had to tell us trying to help us you know been through all kinds of of things and one morning my daughter Sarah that's married to brother Adam from here she a just a a special she's she's a spiritual girl I just say she's dedicated and she prays and a lot and she's she's always she's been that way ever since her conversion and she got up that morning and she prayed and she said Lord she said would you just do something for Mom today in a supernatural way that she'll know that it was you and so and she prayed another prayer concerning her cousin that's backslid both those prayers were answered that day my wife was on a Saturday she was in bed struggling I was I was preparing for service Sunday and I was in my office and I I got to thinking well I go check on her and see how she's doing if I can get something for her I I went in there this is April 1st last year and I went in there and I I come in the room and something was different and she was crying and I said honey what's wrong and she said right now she said God's speaking to me I said okay and I I said thank the Lord and I I walked out and I just rejoicing the Lord was speaking to her and had no idea what was going on but she she had joined a uh streaming of service brother Jeremy Shriner and Amarillo uh Saturday evening service and she was watching that service and she watched it for a little bit and then she thought well I'm just going to turn the I'm going to turn the the deal and I'm going to uh you know just she was starting to thing I just turn it off and something spoke to her and said no maybe God's got something for you and so she said well I'll watch a little bit longer and brother Jeremy at the end of service he's leading s or singing there concluding service and he uh comes to a point and he stops and he says I'm just going to say it he said I don't know know why I I'm doing this I I have no idea but he said I can't get away from it that God put somebody on my heart this this person don't even go to our church I don't even have any idea if she's even watching our service I have no idea but sister Stephanie Collins has been heavy on my heart up here for the last 15 minutes and I've been fighting it but I'm going to say it and he said I believe that God has something for her and he said I want us to join together as a church and pray for her right now that God would heal her and and deliver her and the church began to to pray and and and my wife said the presence of the Lord come through that that room there just moved across that room across her and she felt it it just lifting off of her and she was in that in that atmosphere when I come in there she was rejoicing thinking God for her healing and I can testify to you that she amen the head stop that moment that moment God came by after all the prayers after all the tears after all the holding on after all the the perseverance amen but I told her I said we don't know why we're going through this in the midst of our trial I said but God's got to have a witness God's going to have a witness of somebody that can persevere somebody that can go without an answer somebody that can believe God when there's nothing to look to somebody is going to be a witness that God Amen will meet that person that's held on for years amen hold on to God God will answer that prayer God will meet that need believe God surrender all of it to God let go and let that that Spirit of Faith Amen in your heart the spirit of life in the midst of her struggles one time and she was very low I went up to her and she was there in bed and weeping and I I had to do it because I knew there was going to be a testimony and this is part of the testimony I said honey in all of your struggles in all of these hardships and times and times alone for hours I said have you ever felt like just giving up have you ever felt like just saying Lord I quit I don't understand you don't you don't care about me and I just quit you ever felt like that ever thought that she I said have you have you ever have you ever just thought I'm quitting she said not one time she never hesitated she said this God's all I've got I don't have anything else he's my he's my hope he's my everything thing and I said me too I don't give up I don't quit I believe God and we had us a time right there and we rejoiced in the midst of the trial and we said we're we're not backing down we're not quitting we're believing God and I tell you God is faithful God knows where you're at and he knows what you're going through amen and you've got a spirit of life in you you got a law inside of you that's greater than anything you're going through and any struggle you're in amen you say my roads been hard and we've had some hard roads amen we're not here to compare hard roads with hard roads but I want to tell you there's a God that can keep you on your Hard Road and meet you and he'll bring you out to Victory [Music] amen amen there's a law that is higher than the thing amen that you're up against it's a higher law these laws are subject to God and His law Which is higher that law of faith is is a higher law he says here and who is this MDC he said and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest and Quicken Hallelujah made alive when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started praise the lord it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption and now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly can you testify to that amen it's turned Heavenly amen now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture if you can catch it amen that's the earnest amen you're not going down something's pulling you up amen that's the earnest you're going in Rapture it's the earnest a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen I've seen as Shadows of people don't eat up eat up with cancer tuberculosis see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the resurrection and you know what that earnest money is don't you it's a down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed notice how wonderful we love him he says now this body is subject to the spirit and have not entered into the word form yet but we're still in the flesh form but subject to the word Death In the Flesh will take us there to that word body amen he says and the power that'll raise us up is right in us now I love this that power that'll raise us up is in us right now we are now in heavenly places right now the believer that is our position brother BR would tell us that is your position Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you reading Ephesians and it says that Christ was exalted and and seated in Heavenly places then another place it says that we have been lifted up into those heavenly places on down Ephesians 2 or 3 and then at the end of the uh Ephesians there it tells us that we are we are being we we're wrestling against powers and principalities Amen in high places but if you look at that word it's Heavenly places it's the devil that's trying to keep you from your position in Christ which is Heavenly places amen and we allow him to pull us out of those heavenly places to live down here on Earth and walk around like we're a bunch of carnal people amen and and identify with carnality amen and live our life in this world this is not where our life is our life amen is up there in Christ amen that's where we belong amen don't get identified down here don't get your identity wrapped up down here you're more than a carpenter you're more than a painter you're more than a plumber you're more than what that's not who you are amen you're a son and daughter of God Amen made in the very image of Christ amen praise the Lord he says if there wasn't a law to that he said we're now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it our minds blow because we can't quite comprehend if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got the power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak world into existence go live on it Hallelujah he says there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon in faith amen God gives it to you amen amen amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean the power is controlled if you're a a Son of God or a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there Hallelujah another place he said says now healing is in the reach of every person remember healing is in you ain't that beautiful it's in you that power is in you God placed in the peach tree every Peach that would ever be in it he planted it in the garden and the peach tree or the apple tree the fruit tree just has to grow from drinking the water in the earth now each one of you has those Potentials in you to deliver you for it is God since you've been planted in Christ by the baptism spiritual baptism he says remember they was only I think that's that's a different quote sorry about that remember they was only two days journey away from Kadesh barnea and he held them back just for 40 years because of their unbelief your healing might not be five minutes away but your unbelief will keep it away from you as long as you live You've Got to Believe it amen praise the Lord amen how many laws do you suppose was broken by Moses when he went down to Egypt how many laws am me God's Supernatural so laws mean nothing to him the laws of nature the laws of medicine the laws that we feel governing US mean nothing to him that's right he supersedes those laws he he breaks those laws left and right amen and you remember the testimony brother B praying for that that girl there in the in the hospital and the mom and dad was sitting there and and and they they he came and he spoke to that girl and he he prayed for her and the the daddy said well praise the Lord amen she's going to be well isn't it wonderful Mama she's going home it's going to be fine and the little nurse sitting there saying sir how can you say that it's never been in history recorded that these numbers that anybody ever come out of this and he said bless your heart darling you're looking according to natural medicine and Science and the books he said but I'm looking according to God Amen that makes all the difference amen I'm looking above that to God that supersedes that amen he's greater than that he's greater than your trouble he's greater than your problem he's greater than your doctor he's greater than your lawyer he's greater than all the things that's against you amen we're looking higher than that amen how many laws were broken when Joshua spoke to the son son stand still and it obeyed the voice of a man how many laws were broken amen when Moses held the staff over the Red Sea how many laws did God break throughout all history Amen to prove himself to us how many laws were broken amen by God through a prop Propet in this end time to vindicate a word to us Amen to show us amen that God is so much greater than anything amen and yet we sit here sometimes overcome with you know questions and and unbelief amen and and the prophet tells us plainly he said the worst thing a Christian can do is disbelieve God it's the worst thing we can do amen the La of faith has got to be released within us it's got to be we we we got it within us but we got to release it we got to take our hands off of our situations we got to commit them to God and trust the Lord and believe God Amen we got to it's hard to do sometimes we want to fix it we want to do it we want to we want to do something about it and it's in our nature amen we're not want to sit back and just let somebody else fix our problem we're going to take care care of it it's our nature and there's nothing wrong with that nature until it comes to not letting God take what we can't do you know a perfect example of that and kind of here and there but brother brandom talking about Rebecca when she got all all you know rebellious and acting up and she was a what he called a teeny Annie and she was acting up and and and sister M was all tore up about her and saying you got to do something we got to do something about this she's rebelling she slammed the door she's she's all kinds of you know you got to do something and brother Bram said darling we got to commit her to the Lord we got to take this before God and take our hands off is't that backwards I mean what we we think man we we got to do something about this and the prophet said you know what we've got to take this before the Lord he said sometimes we put our hands at things and we only make it worse but if we could only commit it to the Lord right and trust God he can do what we can't do and he said you know we did that and we just in a really short time Rebecca came back to her senses she got right with God and everything was fine quite an example in it amen praise the Lord for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law Moses law could not do in the it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh the law over mankind amen the soul that sinth it shall die yet God made a provision a higher law the law of a kinsman redeemer proved to be greater than law of sin and death right it supersedes it God's always got the answer to the problem God's always got something Amen to to overcome whatever it is that's against us amen you're not just forgiven you're not just pardon you're redeemed amen you're not just amen under the the weight of what you did but you're free from it amen there's a difference from amen being under it and and and knowing that oh I I got to drag this thing along with me through the rest of my days I got to remember you know some people make Idols to to their past failures amen they they they build a statue and they go back and and they they bow down to the shrine of oh I remember I did this and I did that and I I failed God here and I did this and oh it's so terrible and they they they make a shrine to it when God said I took those and cast them in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again if he wants to forget about it why do we want to remember it but we don't want to remember it but old sloot comes around trying to make you remember your failures to get you to disbelieve God to get you to disarm so you won't take the word of God and faith in the word of God because he don't know what to do with you when you get Faith in the word of God he don't know how to handle you when you take God's word and you stand there in faith he ain't got an answer for it praise the Lord praise God going try to find a place to exit here praise the Lord I had a quote here that I wanted to read to you before I finish he says science has a tree that they can climb they can climb so far and that's as far as they can go that's the end of scientific research and they kill themselves you see by on the tree of Faith there's no end to it you just keep on going that's the tree that we should be on tonight the Tree of Life the tree of faith not heading towards the moon headed towards heaven headed towards God for the Glorious Rapture of the Lord Jesus in his presence and his power and his very life out of Heaven not come down and make us join church not come down even to make us shout but come down to let his whole life live through us live in the heavenlies carry yourself away till you see things that is to come was which is and shall come lifting us above anything that the church has had since the days that Christ was on Earth amen and we're enjoying it today we're in a great age friend a great time it's astronaut age God give us astronauts give us men and women amen daring men and women who did as John Glenn and them who had to them have to do when they stepped into that tube they were Pioneers God wants Pioneers to this word astronauts who will take the things that we have got and not be satisfied with it but we're going on God is making achievements amen he's he's telling us we got to progress we got to go on Amen we can't stay here but it's an onward and an upward calling amen it's not to remain passive it's not to remain contented though we're content in the Lord but there's ever you know Jesus said whosoever drink of this water will never thirst again well there's kind of a there's a double thing there because you get a taste of that water you also get thirsty for it again amen it satisfies completely but it's so satisfying that you can't wait to get more of it amen when you drink of that well it's not a one-time drink it's not a one-time event amen but it's a continual feasting and drinking amen these things into our life because that's what's bringing us up higher and higher and higher and that's why we're here tonight amen because we want to go higher and we don't want to dwell here amen we're we're looking upward amen because we know amen any day any day amen our Lord amen the physical literal return of Our Lord is upon us amen he's already declared it in every way Amen in every way it's been declared it's here upon us amen let's stand to our feet a higher law amen a higher law that's within the believer a law that supersedes all other laws and that's what God has has put in every heart of every believer amen are you identified with that law praise the Lord amen let's let's just bow our hearts before the Lord again here before I turn it back Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are Lord that we can stand and declare these things Lord under Lord the message of the hour and want you revealed to us Lord that you've unveiled yourself to us in ways that we would have never known you God accept that you made a provision for us and we are a privileged people here today that we can declare these things Lord that you're a living God and a very present God and I know Lord that a prophet said it so many times times Lord that we're a needy people and we know the day and hour we're living in father is if there ever was an onslaught of the enemy if there ever was mind battles if there ever was pressures it's this day and hour we're living in oh God I'm glad you've made a provision for us let us take a hold of that provision God the word of

Amen aren't you glad we have a place to go to tonight brother Mark when the when the tree of knowledge has given all that it can give what a word that we have brother Tom I got so inspired that brother up there preaching that when the tree of knowledge has given all it can give you can turn and say well you're climbing up the tree that my God created it is limited to what power that he limited it to but he made another tree it was called the tree of life and in it there is no limit isn't it wonderful to have a tree that we can climb up brother David that tree of life the tree of Faith the tree of power the tree of Resurrection you can put what name you want to on it but it's God's tree that God made for the Believers to feed on and in the midst of failure but the Mark we have something that could sustain us amen it's our everything tonight I wish we knew that song I don't know well enough to try it but with a piano player like that I think we could pull it off you know that song God Is My Everything it's kind of an oldie amen you love the Lord tonight amen how many Give the Lord a big hand clap of Praise how many enjoyed that message you like how I did that now how many enjoyed that message tonight amen praise the Lord amen I appreciate brother Bryce amen you love love the Lord all he's done for us I appreciate the testimonies and we certainly us that know their family had been in in prayer for her for for many months and and years of things that they had gone through with their family and and but the Lord has really done a lot of work in that area and we thank God for it amen when it looks like it's all over and it and Satan's done come put every fire out he could put out and there ain't nowhere else to turn but God will come in and under the spirit of resurrection and he resurrects life he does it in every one of us you may get in a situation somewhere down the road and but Travis feel like I I have nowhere else to turn I'm just kind of locked in and your Zeal gets taken down to nothing but the spirit of Resurrection brings life life God will turn around all of a sudden it's a whole brand new day you feel young again there's a Zeal returned you feel like doing something for the Lord you get on fire for God again that's what God does I believe it tonight amen you love the Lord amen we just want to make a quick announcement um on Memorial Day on Monday we're going to have a picnic here at the church uh everybody's welcome to attend you can invite who you want to I don't know what we're cooking how we're cooking it what we're eating I don't know none of the above but we're having a picnic and it's going to be a good time it's going to start about 11:00 I made that up we're going to be out here about 11:00 and then I don't know when the food will be served but if you're here at 11: you're bound to be able to catch it so somewhere after 11: we'll have food and we're just going to have a good time of fellowship and we just want to come and and give everybody some folks have a place to go God bless you pray the Lord will be with you wherever you go but those that are here we just want to have a good time with everybody amen we used to do that every year and and then uh but circumstances happen and so but we just uh just look forward to that and also just be praying our trustee board we've been speaking with our trustees about making room in the church and I know on Sundays it's been kind of uh tight in the pews and in the parking lot especially and and I know brother Mark don't mind us parking in his yard but after a while that gets old I'm sure and um but we if we don't do something we're going to be in his yard so I thought maybe we'll just take part of brother Mark's yard and make a park and I'm just kiding but we want we're going to have to have some more parking lot and and we're discussing on taking the sides of the building the the the two Wings here that are on the side of the sanctuary and and in in phases removing those and open up the sanctuary and we could add about 100 more seats in the sanctuary so um now this isn't the trust disease this is just brother Matt but I may as well just tell it all well I'd like to see I'd like to see after that's all done is then then one day we'll be able to move this platform back a little bit and maybe CU When we take the offices out we'll have to have somewhere to go with them and maybe put a baptism and and and things in the back and so we'll have to build on to the back of the building to do that but uh the cheapest way to expand is to go with what we already have in square footed so y'all just be praying about that and I know these brothers we've worked hard and we're not we're not starting new construction we're not done with the fellowship all yet but you know me I like to plant those seeds and amen I like to I just let the church know where we're going we're not on our way out we're on our way up brother Bry says we ain't looking for a way to bail out or just just cu the devil brings by a little bit of trouble and trials and all that stuff look him in the eye and say well God put us here for a purpose we're a lighthouse in this community and we got a right as men and women of God to keep that light burning amen amen let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you tonight Lord for the word that was spoken Lord I Thank you for our brother Lord I know he come down and working and laboring and Lord just to come and speak his heart and Lord what powerful testimonies that was shared here tonight Lord and Faith that's been built and Lord I pray you'd bless brother Bryce and his family and their church and God May a special blessing be upon him Lord anoint him Lord and God that your church would continue to grow and Lord you'd give him the the words and the and the and the encouragement to continue to press the battle and Lord we thank you for him Lord and we we love you for all that you've done tonight and we give you the glory for it in Jesus name we pray amen may God bless you tonight God he is my [Music] everything God Is My Everything he's my joy He's My Hope
