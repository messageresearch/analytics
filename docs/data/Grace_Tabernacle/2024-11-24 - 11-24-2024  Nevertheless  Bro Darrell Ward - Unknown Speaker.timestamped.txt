[44:47] to be here and just trust something to
[44:50] be said to help you and encourage you
[44:53] Luke Chapter 5 starting at verse one
[44:57] the Bible says
[45:00] this and it came to pass that as the
[45:03] people pressed upon him to hear the word
[45:05] of
[45:05] God that he stood by the lake of G
[45:09] ganzar and he saw two ships standing by
[45:13] the lake but the fishermen were gone out
[45:15] of them and were washing their
[45:17] Nets and he entered into one of the
[45:20] ships which was Simons and prayed him
[45:21] that he would Thrust out a little from
[45:23] the land and he sat down and taught the
[45:26] people out of of the
[45:28] ship now when he was left speaking he
[45:30] said unto Simon launch out into the deep
[45:32] and let down your nets for a DRT for a
[45:36] pool and Simon answered and said unto
[45:38] him Master we have told all night and
[45:43] have taken
[45:44] nothing
[45:47] nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
[45:50] the
[45:51] net and when they had done when they had
[45:54] this done they enclosed a great
[45:56] multitude the fishes and their net
[46:00] break and they beckoned under their
[46:02] Partners which were in the other ship
[46:03] that they should come and help them and
[46:04] they came and filled both ships so that
[46:08] they began to
[46:10] sink now that's a fishing trip right
[46:13] there and when Simon Peter saw it he
[46:15] fell down at Jesus knees saying depart
[46:18] from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord
[46:22] for he was astonished and all that were
[46:24] with him at the DRT of the fishes which
[46:26] which they had
[46:28] taken and so was also James and John the
[46:31] sons of Zebedee which were partners with
[46:33] Simon and Jesus said un Salon fear not
[46:37] from hence forth Thou shalt catch
[46:40] men Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to
[46:43] speak to you for just a a few minutes
[46:44] this morning on
[46:47] nevertheless
[46:50] nevertheless Heavenly Father we just bow
[46:55] in your wonderful presence today
[46:57] Lord and from the depths of our heart we
[47:00] want to tell you just how much you mean
[47:03] to us for Lord while we were yet sinners
[47:07] you died for us and Lord As We Gather
[47:10] here this Thanksgiving weekend with
[47:12] family and friends we pray oh God that
[47:15] your presence would be felt Among Us
[47:17] Lord that our sick would be healed and
[47:20] our weak would be made strong and Lord
[47:23] those that would maybe be weary or kind
[47:26] of down may they be lifted up Lord to
[47:28] see that every promise of your word is
[47:31] still true time and situations and

[53:42] not good enough well my you've got to
[53:44] know him for yourself amen that's right
[53:48] amen you can't serve God cuz your
[53:50] parents love him you've got to serve God
[53:52] because you love
[53:54] him amen and when you hear what the word
[53:57] is saying to you then you realize he's
[54:00] talking to
[54:03] me amen I think of Paul he was in a
[54:07] great storm 14 days in a
[54:11] storm and this storm was so great they
[54:14] wasn't even able to eat that must have
[54:18] been some kind of storm because you know
[54:20] how we like to eat but they couldn't
[54:23] even eat but in the midst of a two weak
[54:27] hurricane Paul said be of good
[54:33] cheer I ain't eight and 14 days and
[54:35] you're telling me to be
[54:37] happy be of good cheer for I believe
[54:40] it'll even be as God hath said for there
[54:44] stood by me he said there shall be no
[54:47] loss of any man's life among you but of
[54:49] the ship only for there stood by me this
[54:51] night an angel of God whose I am and
[54:53] whom I serve saying fear not Paul for th
[54:56] must be brought before Caesar and lo God
[54:58] hath given thee all them that sail with
[55:01] thee right in the midst of the greatest
[55:03] storm of their life Paul said to be
[55:06] happy how could you be happy in such a
[55:09] storm because Paul had a promise from
[55:12] God Amen that no matter how bad the
[55:15] storm was there would be no loss of
[55:19] life amen Paul said be happy it will be
[55:23] as God hath said
[55:27] amen oh my said how I love him God keeps
[55:32] his word he'll keep his word every time
[55:36] not 99 times out of a 100 but 100 times
[55:40] out of a
[55:42] 100 God will keep his word now think of
[55:46] it if the Lord Jesus healed one
[55:49] person he can heal all
[55:53] persons is that not true if he can heal
[55:55] cancer the skin he can heal cancer of
[55:57] the
[56:00] liver amen if God delivered one person
[56:03] he can deliver all people if he can send
[56:06] one particle son home he can send all
[56:08] particle Sons
[56:12] home well my situation don't look at the
[56:15] situation look at the God who made the
[56:18] promise
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:20] amen the only thing you have to know is
[56:23] this is to believe his presence is here
[56:26] amen
[56:27] to believe that he is here to help you
[56:30] if you can believe he's here to help you
[56:32] you can get
[56:34] help well I don't know I don't I I I
[56:36] don't know if I can believe that or not
[56:38] doubt will keep him away from you he'll
[56:40] never come to your door if you're
[56:42] doubting him but if you believe
[56:44] him the prophet said he will come any
[56:47] time he's called for him to
[56:50] come oh my amen if you're believing and
[56:55] accept it then he can help help you you
[56:56] see the ABCs of your healing the ABCs of
[57:01] your deliverance the ABCs of your
[57:04] restoration is accept it believe
[57:08] it and confess it
[57:12] amen not one place did he say feel
[57:15] it accept it believe it and confess it
[57:19] and God can only bless you as you
[57:21] confess that he's done it for you he's
[57:24] the high priest of our conf confession
[57:27] is that right Hebrews 3 said he's the
[57:29] high priest of our confession confession
[57:31] now they're just being let me give you
[57:32] just a little bit of instruction he said
[57:34] that that it may be easy to stick you
[57:36] might come here and be prayed for you
[57:38] might even have Angels lay hands on you
[57:43] now you talk about a service if angels
[57:46] come down this morning and stood at this
[57:48] Altar and laid hands on you they'd be
[57:50] talking about it for
[57:52] years but the prophet said you might
[57:54] come here and be prayed for you might
[57:56] even have angels to lay hands on
[58:02] you and it'll never do one thing to you
[58:05] that's right until first you believe it
[58:09] and accept it and confess
[58:12] it think about that for a minute but you
[58:15] see we always it's what we see with our
[58:17] eye but God don't want us to look with
[58:19] the eyes of our head he wants us to look
[58:21] with the eyes of our heart amen for the
[58:24] eyes of the heart sees what the eyes of
[58:25] the head cannot see that's right brother
[58:29] Oh Glory to
[58:31] God he's the Risen high priest of our
[58:34] confession we've got to confess it first
[58:36] before he can witness it before God for
[58:38] he's the high priest there to make
[58:40] intercession Upon Our confession of what
[58:43] he has done for
[58:45] us if you could do that this morning I
[58:47] tell you you will see
[58:49] Miracles you will see Giants fall you
[58:53] will see Revival amen if we can take God
[58:57] at his word and begin to confess what
[59:00] God Said has already been
[59:02] done
[59:05] hallelujah amen what did the angel of
[59:07] the Lord tell brother brandom if you can
[59:10] get the people to
[59:13] believe nothing shall stand in your way
[59:18] not even
[59:23] ccer amen it said the said I trust now
[59:27] that you'll do that each one of you will
[59:28] be Reverend and Believe on him with all
[59:30] your heart then we come with this
[59:34] understanding the prophet said he saved
[59:36] you when he died he saved you and he
[59:39] healed you when he died for he took your
[59:43] place but now all you have to do is
[59:46] accept it by faith and you'll receive it

[1:01:18] going to go ding ding ding ding ding and
[1:01:19] they're going to say he sto a

[1:02:09] for
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:14] amen you can have it
[1:02:16] amen you can have it it's your
[1:02:20] right the very minute that you believe
[1:02:24] it you can it that's when your faith
[1:02:28] meets God's requirement to believe that
[1:02:30] Christ died for your sickness when he
[1:02:32] died for your sins he died for your sins
[1:02:35] at Calvary he accepted upon the basis
[1:02:37] and at that moment you are healed in the
[1:02:40] sight of God then you go on testifying
[1:02:44] of it believing it you testify of the
[1:02:47] things you do not see faith is the
[1:02:49] substance of things hope for and the
[1:02:52] evidence of things you do not
[1:02:56] see and we look to the unse Unseen
[1:03:00] because you see when God says anything
[1:03:03] he means just what he
[1:03:08] said you know somebody come to me one
[1:03:10] time about brother Bram and said every
[1:03:12] word that come out of brother brenham's
[1:03:13] mouth was thus sayith the Lord and I
[1:03:16] said well I ain't the sharpest knife in
[1:03:19] the drawer but let me ask you something
[1:03:21] if everything brother benam said was
[1:03:23] thus sayth the Lord why did he have to
[1:03:25] say thus sayth the
[1:03:28] Lord he was saying thus sayith the Lord
[1:03:30] to tell you this ain't me this is the
[1:03:32] Lord and if the man tells you thus said
[1:03:35] the Lord and it don't come to pass that
[1:03:37] man lied to you because God does not
[1:03:41] lie come on somebody if God says it God
[1:03:44] will do
[1:03:47] it amen Abraham looked at him and said I
[1:03:51] know he's able to do that what he
[1:03:53] promised to do I'm a hundred year old
[1:03:55] Sarah's 90s something year
[1:03:58] old but if God said he'll do it he'll do
[1:04:02] it he promised it amen time don't matter
[1:04:06] if it takes 25 seconds 25 months or 25
[1:04:10] years if God said he will do it he will
[1:04:13] do it Abraham waited 25 years we can't
[1:04:17] wait 25
[1:04:21] seconds well I got prayed for and
[1:04:23] nothing happened that ain't the faith of
[1:04:25] Abraham
[1:04:27] Abraham believed God for 25 years how
[1:04:30] many times did they laugh at him when
[1:04:31] Sarah was was was knitting out those
[1:04:33] booties for the baby am man I said you
[1:04:36] guys have lost your mind they did lose
[1:04:38] their mind Hallelujah they got the mind
[1:04:40] of God
[1:04:43] Amen Let the doctor look at me like I'm
[1:04:45] crazy when I tell him I'm already healed
[1:04:48] let them say what they want to say but
[1:04:49] my God will back up his
[1:04:53] word I remember how they looked at me
[1:04:55] when I told him Jessica would see again
[1:04:57] and they said there's no way she could
[1:04:58] see again and even people told me they
[1:05:00] thought I'd had a nervous breakdown and
[1:05:02] had lost my mind but let me tell you I
[1:05:04] wasn't looking at the MRI I wasn't
[1:05:06] looking at the CT scan I was looking at
[1:05:08] what God Said in his doctor report
[1:05:10] Hallelujah I opened the eyes of the
[1:05:12] Blind and I make the lame walk that's
[1:05:14] what my God
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:17] said yes sir Hallelujah but you see
[1:05:20] brother Mark the outside world wants you
[1:05:22] to believe as soon as you lay hands on
[1:05:24] that crippled arm it's supposed to
[1:05:26] straighten out come on well it's
[1:05:28] wonderful if it does but you see God
[1:05:30] never promised that he said lay hands on
[1:05:33] the sick and they shall recover but he
[1:05:35] never said
[1:05:38] when well
[1:05:40] glory amen the prayer of faith shall
[1:05:44] save the sick and God will raise them up
[1:05:46] sir but he never said
[1:05:51] when he said when you pray believe you
[1:05:54] receive it and it shall be given to you
[1:05:58] but he never
[1:05:59] said
[1:06:01] when he just said Do You Believe
[1:06:07] Me amen people look for the healing of
[1:06:09] the body to be so complicated and yet
[1:06:11] it's so very simple just take God and
[1:06:14] His word just say the same
[1:06:17] thing he
[1:06:20] does why didn't get too many amens out
[1:06:22] of that but I don't know why that's so
[1:06:24] hard to do we sure do it for the
[1:06:27] doctor yes sir the doctor's office we'll
[1:06:30] get on our phone well honey I just come
[1:06:32] from the doctor and the doctor said
[1:06:35] you'll tell them every time what the
[1:06:36] doctor said well the doctor said and the
[1:06:38] doctor said and the doctor said well if
[1:06:40] we can do that for the doctor and he can
[1:06:42] be wrong why can't we do it for Jesus
[1:06:44] who's never
[1:06:48] wrong Hallelujah let's start saying what
[1:06:51] God said about it God said I'm Healed
[1:06:53] God said I'm delivered God said I'm an
[1:06:55] overcomer God said I'm predestinated let
[1:06:58] me say what God
[1:07:01] Said Hallelujah if you start saying what
[1:07:04] God Said your body will obey your
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:09] confession we live in such a Negative
[1:07:11] age you get around people are so
[1:07:14] negative it's time we be positive we
[1:07:17] don't serve a negative God we serve a
[1:07:19] positive
[1:07:22] God amen amen by stri
[1:07:26] I'm Healed that settles it yes sir what
[1:07:28] God Said Amen well I know somebody
[1:07:32] belied that and they died that don't
[1:07:34] change
[1:07:35] anything when I was in the Army we had I
[1:07:38] think if I remember right it's been a
[1:07:39] long time we had 11 General Orders that
[1:07:42] we followed orders like if you pass an
[1:07:44] officer you salute them it's just
[1:07:47] general orders that's what you did as a
[1:07:48] soldier you had these orders that you
[1:07:50] obeyed as a soldier but then there come
[1:07:53] a direct order and a direct order from
[1:07:55] headquarters supersedes all general
[1:08:00] orders so like for example a general is
[1:08:04] you salute an officer but in combat you
[1:08:07] don't salute an officer because if you
[1:08:09] salute Mark and he's a lieutenant
[1:08:11] there's a sniper waiting to take his
[1:08:12] head off because he's a leader so you
[1:08:14] don't let the enemy know who the leaders
[1:08:16] are so you don't salute in combat that's
[1:08:19] a direct order so our general orders is
[1:08:22] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:08:24] that's a general order but sometimes it
[1:08:26] comes from headquarters a direct order
[1:08:28] that's my time I'm taking her home I'm
[1:08:31] taking him home it's not because we fail
[1:08:33] it's not because God fail it's because
[1:08:35] God gave a direct order it's time for my
[1:08:38] child to come
[1:08:42] home Hallelujah and the prophet said if
[1:08:44] I pray for a thousand and a thousand die
[1:08:46] I'll get up the next day and preach
[1:08:48] Divine Healing because God Is A
[1:08:52] Healer amen amen is that all right
[1:08:58] amen by Stripes some heel that settles
[1:09:01] it now we find Jesus come to Simon and
[1:09:04] the Peter and his the boats the boats
[1:09:06] were all empty no fish now you talk
[1:09:09] about discouragement cuz they needed
[1:09:11] that fish to pay their taxes sell the
[1:09:13] fish to pay the tax they needed the fish
[1:09:16] and they had fished all night long and
[1:09:19] caught
[1:09:20] nothing sounds like some of my hunting
[1:09:23] trips and Jesus said Jesus said take me
[1:09:26] out a little that I might speak the word
[1:09:28] of
[1:09:29] God now notice they fished all night
[1:09:32] long and caught nothing they were
[1:09:34] discouraged but listen to me when things
[1:09:36] don't work out the way you think they
[1:09:38] should don't get discouraged maybe it's
[1:09:42] happening for a reason for a purpose
[1:09:45] maybe God is fixing to show you just how
[1:09:50] great he
[1:09:52] Isen brother remember remember
[1:09:56] every Miracle begins with a
[1:10:02] problem you see we want Miracles but we
[1:10:05] don't want no problems right but you
[1:10:07] can't have a miracle unless you got a
[1:10:11] problem and think of this if Peter's
[1:10:14] boat had been full of
[1:10:15] fish there'd been no room for
[1:10:20] Jesus on and you know think about it if
[1:10:24] our boats
[1:10:25] if our lives are so full of the things
[1:10:28] of the
[1:10:29] world there's no room for
[1:10:32] Jesus but let's empty out of our vessels
[1:10:35] of meaningless things that we spend so
[1:10:38] much time looking
[1:10:46] at that turkey is going to be real good
[1:10:48] in just a few
[1:10:50] minutes but if we can empty oursel of
[1:10:53] things that you know we'll spend hours
[1:10:56] of wasted
[1:10:59] time but if we get empty out of
[1:11:01] meaningless
[1:11:03] things and he could fill our boats with
[1:11:06] himself and Jesus said take me out to
[1:11:09] the deep that I might speak now listen
[1:11:11] he'll never borrow something from you
[1:11:13] but what he won't repay you for it and
[1:11:15] could it be the very reason that the
[1:11:17] fishing was so
[1:11:19] bad because Jesus was going to use the
[1:11:21] boat the next day
[1:11:25] come on now think about I I wrote this
[1:11:29] down I thought wow think about this what
[1:11:31] started out as the worst fishing
[1:11:36] trip ended up being sto talked about
[1:11:40] that thousands of years later we're
[1:11:43] still talking about that fishing
[1:11:48] trip what think one that started out so
[1:11:51] I ain't call one minute
[1:11:55] and thousands of years later we're still
[1:11:57] talking about this fishing
[1:12:00] trip you see weeping may endure for a
[1:12:04] night but joy cometh in the
[1:12:11] morning and when Jesus was through
[1:12:13] speaking he said take me a little
[1:12:15] further in the deep and cast down your
[1:12:18] nets now look he wasn't giving them an
[1:12:22] empty
[1:12:23] promise he knew what was fixing to
[1:12:27] happen all he wanted them to do was to
[1:12:31] believe what he was
[1:12:33] saying take now a little bit further and
[1:12:35] let down your nets to a place they had
[1:12:38] just fished through a little bit ago and
[1:12:41] he said cast down your nets for a pull
[1:12:45] now that was just as much the word of
[1:12:47] God as God saying let there be
[1:12:50] light and Peter and him was experienced
[1:12:53] fishermen they knew how to fish they
[1:12:55] been all night long and had caught
[1:12:58] nothing they even used that big what's
[1:13:01] that worm called there she was talking
[1:13:02] about last night that big old long
[1:13:05] worm South African special They even
[1:13:08] used that one didn't get
[1:13:11] nothing that that Buzz bait with the
[1:13:14] little whatever you
[1:13:16] know but they they knew the ins and outs
[1:13:20] sufficient on and Peter said Lord we've
[1:13:23] told all not long there's nothing
[1:13:27] there we've done all we know to do but
[1:13:30] when you've done all you know to do that
[1:13:33] ain't the time to quit that's the time
[1:13:35] to
[1:13:38] stand you see there's only two roads
[1:13:40] before you that's either Faith or
[1:13:42] unbelief and you're controlled by one or
[1:13:44] the other you're going to take one road
[1:13:47] or you're going to take the other
[1:13:49] Road Jesus was saying let down the net
[1:13:52] now Peter was wept with this choice of
[1:13:55] obeying the word or leaning on his own
[1:13:58] understanding as a fisherman come on and
[1:14:02] every one of us this morning is left
[1:14:04] with this choice you see the net is in
[1:14:07] your
[1:14:08] hand it was in his hand what are you
[1:14:11] going to do Peter let that it was in his
[1:14:13] hand and I'm telling you the net is in
[1:14:15] your hand you're going to hold on to
[1:14:17] your understanding you're going to hold
[1:14:19] on to your problems or you going to take
[1:14:21] God at his word
[1:14:26] you know the situation may look bad the
[1:14:29] problem may be
[1:14:30] great but nevertheless Lord I'm letting
[1:14:34] down the net because you said so amen
[1:14:38] not because of what I feel but because
[1:14:40] of what you said now Prophet said maybe
[1:14:43] you've been to every doctor in the city
[1:14:44] maybe you've come through every clinic
[1:14:46] and every doctor's office maybe the man
[1:14:47] with honesty has examin you and said I
[1:14:49] don't know what's wrong with you or
[1:14:50] maybe he's found what's wrong with you
[1:14:52] and say it's not a medical rim to cure
[1:14:54] you
[1:14:55] there's nothing in the world that can be
[1:14:57] done for you and maybe you've seen
[1:14:59] through all that and you went through
[1:15:00] all the prayer lines and you done
[1:15:02] everything you know to do and you're
[1:15:04] still sick and you're still getting
[1:15:06] worse why don't you do like Peter and
[1:15:09] say Lord I don't know how it's going to
[1:15:11] happen but at Thy word Lord I'm going to
[1:15:14] let down the net I'm going to let down
[1:15:17] and believe with all my heart that
[1:15:19] you're going to heal me
[1:15:20] today
[1:15:22] amen the prophet said if you'll do that
[1:15:25] you'll go away from here a well person
[1:15:27] at Thy word Lord I'm going to let down
[1:15:30] the net It seems impossible to the human
[1:15:33] eye It seems impossible as my experience
[1:15:35] as a fisherman but
[1:15:38] nevertheless at Thy word I'm going to
[1:15:41] let down the net and the prophet said
[1:15:43] that's it that pulsating of the word
[1:15:45] Peter looked to the Unseen he took God
[1:15:48] at his word all my expertise as a
[1:15:50] fisherman I told right through this spot
[1:15:52] no more than three hours ago there's no
[1:15:55] fish here the wind's in the wrong
[1:15:57] direction it's the wrong time of day
[1:15:59] every scientific reason says it won't
[1:16:03] work but
[1:16:07] nevertheless but nevertheless
[1:16:10] Lord you see if taking God at his word
[1:16:13] produce fish yeah then taking God at his
[1:16:16] word will produce healing it'll produce
[1:16:18] Joy it'll produce peace it'll produce
[1:16:20] Victory it'll produce Deliverance taking
[1:16:22] the word of God over every circumstance
[1:16:25] will produce what God said it will
[1:16:27] produce that's
[1:16:29] right he said let down the net if you
[1:16:32] let if you if he said let down the net
[1:16:35] he'll put the fish
[1:16:37] there
[1:16:39] brother if the doctor says you can't get
[1:16:41] well and the word of God says you can be
[1:16:43] well and God can put anything he can put
[1:16:46] new cells he can put new eyes he can put
[1:16:49] new eardrums whatever it is he can put
[1:16:51] it there
[1:16:55] come
[1:16:58] on let me hurry listen I was in St
[1:17:01] Carlos the patan reservation several
[1:17:03] years ago and as a sister she's an older
[1:17:06] sister but she was a young girl when
[1:17:08] brother Brenham came there in the 50s
[1:17:10] and out there you know now there's
[1:17:12] houses and stuff but there where the
[1:17:13] church is me and Brother David Syler
[1:17:14] preached there a few years ago and right
[1:17:16] there where the church is they used to
[1:17:18] it was just a field and she said all the
[1:17:20] Indians laid their blankets out here in
[1:17:21] this field and they were sitting on the
[1:17:23] blankets and she said I was a young girl
[1:17:25] so I got up close to the front cuz I
[1:17:27] wanted to
[1:17:28] see and she said the fourth person that
[1:17:31] came through the prayer line was a
[1:17:32] little Apache girl who was deaf and dumb
[1:17:36] had never spoke a word in her life and
[1:17:39] she said brother Brandon was using this
[1:17:41] female interpreter because she was the
[1:17:43] only one that understood good English so
[1:17:45] he was using her to talk to these
[1:17:47] Apaches because at that time most of
[1:17:49] them didn't even speak
[1:17:52] English and so brother Ben prayed for
[1:17:54] this death and dumb girl who never spoke
[1:17:56] a word in her life brother and when it
[1:18:00] got done he told The Interpreter to tell
[1:18:03] her to speak and so she started
[1:18:05] talking for the first time in her life
[1:18:09] she started
[1:18:11] talking and the prophet turned to The
[1:18:13] Interpreter said now she'll talk better
[1:18:16] later yeah good and The Interpreter said
[1:18:20] her talk keep good
[1:18:22] now because you see she wasn't speaking
[1:18:30] English she was speaking
[1:18:32] Apache you know why she was speaking if
[1:18:35] anybody's ever heard the Apache language
[1:18:36] it all runs together you can't hardly
[1:18:38] separate one word from the other and she
[1:18:40] began to speak the first words in her
[1:18:42] life was not French it wasn't Spanish it
[1:18:45] wasn't English it was Apache you know
[1:18:47] why she was
[1:18:50] aach
[1:18:53] hallelujah hallelujah if God can put
[1:18:55] aache language in the mouth of a child
[1:18:58] who never spoke a word in her life what
[1:19:00] can he do for you

[1:23:18] the service that's the God we serve
[1:23:20] that's the god that can do exceedingly
[1:23:22] and above all that we can ever hope for
[1:23:24] there is nothing that my God can't
[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:29] do Peter said I'm going to believe you
[1:23:31] Lord right now I'm going to take you at
[1:23:32] your word I'm going to let down the net
[1:23:35] and that same God lives this morning he
[1:23:38] does the same thing hallelujah it's the
[1:23:40] same nature of God Peter walked on the
[1:23:43] water because the word said to do it
[1:23:45] come away and away he went Mary didn't
[1:23:47] know how the Virgin was conceive but she
[1:23:49] took God at his word and produced Christ
[1:23:51] the word Moses with a stick in his hand
[1:23:54] how is he going to take over a nation
[1:23:55] with the stick but he took God at his
[1:23:57] word and whoop the greatest army of the
[1:23:59] world knew at that
[1:24:01] time by taking God at his word an 80y
[1:24:06] old man with a beard swinging off of his
[1:24:08] knee with a stick in his hand going to
[1:24:10] Egypt to take
[1:24:11] over that's so silly you can't even amen
[1:24:14] it and yet God do
[1:24:18] it amen Prophet talked about the eagle
[1:24:21] in the blow down he said he said I I pr
[1:24:24] prais the Lord said that eagle you know
[1:24:26] said that squirrel begin to chatter CH
[1:24:28] looked over said there was that eagle
[1:24:29] said I told that eagle said do you know
[1:24:31] I can shoot you before you get ever get
[1:24:32] off the ground said I can shoot you said
[1:24:34] that eagle wasn't paying no attention to
[1:24:35] me said just sitting there just testing
[1:24:37] those
[1:24:39] wings just testing those wings he said
[1:24:41] he knew before I'd ever get my gun he'd
[1:24:44] be
[1:24:45] gone you know what he was trusting in he
[1:24:48] was trusting in what God made him the
[1:24:50] eagle trusted in what God made him he
[1:24:52] knew he could get off the ground before
[1:24:54] the prophet could ever get his gun
[1:24:55] because that's the genetics of what God
[1:24:58] made him amen and if an eagle can trust
[1:25:00] in what God made him can you and I this
[1:25:02] morning trust in what God has made us
[1:25:04] he's made us Overcomers he's made us the
[1:25:06] bride of Christ he's Hallelujah he's
[1:25:09] made us Sons and Daughters of God he's
[1:25:11] made us Believers and Believers believe
[1:25:13] because that's what believers
[1:25:17] do can we take confidence this morning
[1:25:20] that this message will produce a body
[1:25:22] change
[1:25:25] what do you think Satan's attacking it
[1:25:26] like he
[1:25:27] is you see the devil attacking the
[1:25:29] Catholic
[1:25:33] Church why do you think he's attacking
[1:25:35] this message like he
[1:25:40] does if you don't know where the battle
[1:25:41] is see where the front line
[1:25:44] is amen at that word oh Lord no we fish
[1:25:49] through all the waters an hour before
[1:25:51] hour after hour all night long we've
[1:25:52] taken not one fish fish yeah how in the
[1:25:56] world are we going to drop down those
[1:25:58] Nets and get a whole bunch of fish
[1:26:01] they're just not running it doesn't even
[1:26:05] look reasonable it doesn't even look
[1:26:11] sensible but
[1:26:15] nevertheless reasoning would have you to
[1:26:18] say we've done done that reason would
[1:26:20] have you to say there's no fish there
[1:26:22] you see reason would have kept BL
[1:26:24] barname sitting on that rock that fell
[1:26:26] off the wall of Jericho when Jesus
[1:26:28] stopped from called for him to come
[1:26:30] reasen would have said you're blind
[1:26:32] that's right reason would have said you
[1:26:33] don't know where he's at Reon would have
[1:26:35] said there's so many people between you
[1:26:37] and him reason would have said how can
[1:26:40] you trust the people who said that take
[1:26:42] you to him it would be better for you to
[1:26:44] just to sit right here and don't get
[1:26:52] excited reason when would have kept
[1:26:54] Peter in the boat when Jesus B him to
[1:26:56] come during that great
[1:26:59] storm all those friends with him said
[1:27:02] Peter you know the best place to be in
[1:27:03] this storm is right here in this boat
[1:27:04] and you're going to do what you're going
[1:27:07] to step out of this
[1:27:09] boat reasoning would have kept him in
[1:27:12] the boat that's the safest place to be
[1:27:13] in a storm is in the boat certainly not
[1:27:15] out in the
[1:27:17] water but you see if Jesus is calling
[1:27:20] for you to
[1:27:21] come the Way's already provided for you
[1:27:24] to get
[1:27:26] there Hallelujah and God told him to let
[1:27:29] down the neck in the same water that
[1:27:32] fish all not
[1:27:34] in but now let down the net and get
[1:27:37] ready for the pull of fish that you're
[1:27:38] going to take this time we're going to
[1:27:41] do it at his word and not our
[1:27:45] ability there's the secret can I have
[1:27:47] just a few more
[1:27:49] minutes Peter said I know there's no
[1:27:51] fish there Lord but at Thy word
[1:27:53] nevertheless
[1:27:55] nevertheless at Thy word Lord I'm not
[1:27:58] looking at the facts there's no fish I'm
[1:28:00] only looking at the word that says to
[1:28:02] let down the Nets thank you Lord
[1:28:05] hallelujah you see you obey the word
[1:28:07] when he obeyed the word he got the
[1:28:09] promise because if you obey the word you
[1:28:12] get the promise if you obey God's word
[1:28:15] his promise comes
[1:28:17] next let me say that again if you obey
[1:28:20] God's word his promise comes next he
[1:28:23] can't lie he's God that's right what
[1:28:26] does man what does any man more need
[1:28:28] than the promise of God and God said he
[1:28:31] would do it and I say to you tonight
[1:28:35] this morning rer I say to you just let
[1:28:38] down the net amen take him at his word
[1:28:42] he is my healer he's my deliverer he's
[1:28:45] my sustainer he's my peace he's my joy
[1:28:48] it's already done it's already done the
[1:28:53] battle is over the victory is won it's
[1:28:56] all
[1:29:01] ready you said brother Daryl I've cast
[1:29:04] my net over and over and over I've done
[1:29:09] everything I know to do and that boy's
[1:29:13] getting worse and that girl's getting
[1:29:15] more crazier that tumor is getting
[1:29:22] bigger but now I tell you friends don't
[1:29:25] look at what you can do look at what the
[1:29:27] word says to do like that girl in Alaska
[1:29:31] and I I know I told you this before but
[1:29:33] it just stands out in my heart just a
[1:29:35] young girl 21 year old she came up for
[1:29:37] prayer she said I'm an alcoholic I've
[1:29:38] been through the 12 step I've been
[1:29:41] through the nstep program 12 different
[1:29:43] times is what she said the nin step
[1:29:45] program of alcoholism said I've been
[1:29:47] through it and I'm still cannot quit
[1:29:49] drinking I have tried everything to quit
[1:29:53] drinking she Saidi woke up and found my
[1:29:55] places places I didn't even know where I
[1:29:57] was because I was drunk I got a little
[1:29:59] child I don't know who the daddy is
[1:30:01] because I was conceived while I was
[1:30:03] drunk I've tried everything and I cannot
[1:30:07] quit drinking and I said
[1:30:11] sis have you tried
[1:30:13] Jesus I said you just lay the alcohol
[1:30:16] right down here you just lay it at the
[1:30:17] altar and take his freedom and go out
[1:30:20] that door free for whom the son has made
[1:30:22] free is free and
[1:30:24] and I begin to pray for that girl as
[1:30:26] long as I live I'll never forget it she
[1:30:29] begin to scream at the top of her lungs
[1:30:31] I'm free I'm free I'm
[1:30:42] free and I was up there a couple of year
[1:30:44] ago she came up to me she said brother
[1:30:47] Daryl it's been two years Lord and I'm
[1:30:50] still
[1:30:52] sober what the alcohol program couldn't
[1:30:55] do our God
[1:31:00] could that's what we need it's faith our
[1:31:03] faith to take action it's not enough to
[1:31:06] say I believe it we must act on it you
[1:31:08] must accept it believe it and confess it
[1:31:11] how do we know Noah believed God when he
[1:31:13] said it was going to rain how do we know
[1:31:14] Noah believed God because he built the
[1:31:16] boat before the rain ever fa how do we
[1:31:19] know Joshua belied God when he said
[1:31:21] March around the wall blow a trumpet
[1:31:22] shout the walls going to fall down
[1:31:24] because they shouted the victory before
[1:31:26] the wall ever come down and how do we
[1:31:28] know we believe God when we begin to act
[1:31:30] like we're healed while the symptom is
[1:31:32] still
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:35] there and if you can believe that this
[1:31:37] promise is for you then you can start
[1:31:39] right now
[1:31:40] shouting because it's already done Lord
[1:31:44] I believe I believe I believe what you
[1:31:46] said to me you see Faith jumps and
[1:31:48] leaves no matter where he is he's bid me
[1:31:50] to come I'm going there you are oh my
[1:31:52] that's it right there he's bid me to
[1:31:54] come I must do what the word says to do
[1:31:58] as we come to a close give your faith a
[1:32:00] chance turn it loose unbridle it let it
[1:32:04] work youve got it all bound with
[1:32:07] tradition I have to feel a certain thing
[1:32:09] I have to get a goosebump nonsense you
[1:32:12] get a goosebump from the air
[1:32:15] conditioner just cut all of it Loose let
[1:32:17] God have his way don't we sing a song
[1:32:20] like that let go and let God have his
[1:32:23] wonderful
[1:32:24] way somebody's word is right either
[1:32:28] yours either the doctor's or what God
[1:32:31] Said and the only way your word can be
[1:32:33] right if you're saying what he said
[1:32:35] that's right because God's word is true
[1:32:39] Peter cast down the net and got fish
[1:32:41] blind barnas cast off his robe and got
[1:32:44] his eyesight and I say to you step out
[1:32:46] this morning amen and claim your promise
[1:32:49] when David stooped before that Brook
[1:32:51] that day and that big giant 9' n in tall
[1:32:53] 14inch fingers you talking about a hand
[1:32:56] that man could slap
[1:32:58] you his hand was so big he could slap
[1:33:01] you on one side of the face and the
[1:33:02] fingers go all the way around and slap
[1:33:03] you on the
[1:33:05] other you walk up somebody both cheeks
[1:33:07] red they say goli slapped
[1:33:10] you how do you know he slapped me before
[1:33:13] I recognize them red finger marks 14inch
[1:33:16] fingers 9 foot n in tall and David was
[1:33:20] just a boy I think some some Scholars
[1:33:23] estimate between 14 15 year old just a
[1:33:25] boy but he stooped there at that Brook
[1:33:27] that day and he picked up five smooth
[1:33:32] stones but let me say in closing he
[1:33:34] never picked up five smooth stones in
[1:33:36] case he missed four
[1:33:39] times he picked up five smooth Stones
[1:33:42] because Goliath had four brothers and
[1:33:44] David said I'll just kill them

[1:34:28] stands before
[1:34:30] you you see if Goliath had saw the god
[1:34:33] that stood behind David he would have
[1:34:35] never made that
[1:34:38] challenge but all David saw was a boy
[1:34:41] but all David saw was a defeated
[1:34:44] giant do you love him today let us bow
