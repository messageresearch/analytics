you'll let me [Music] hold amen now what a what a treasure this is amen this brother Logan and his family and you know he's kind of been through a rough go the past few weeks but God's still leading us and I thank God for his family and Logan and I've known him his whole life so just to wonderful see these little precious children and my aren't they innocent isn't that isn't that something just such an innocence and we just want to dedicate this little girl Ellie rain and and may as well just dedicate all of us amen I'm just want to dedicat her to the Lord and I believe that that ought to be a right thing that's a real good desire in the heart of a father and mother is to dedicate the children that God had given them back to God Amen so let's just all pray together if you don't mind gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a treasure Lord that you've given us Lord and God as we think on this little child Lord and the innocence of her life Lord realize that each one of us Lord are are made in your image and Lord what a a beautiful child that we have and Lord I know that this family Lord as they come to dedicate theirselves to you and bring this child that you've given them and Lord that that you would be able to strengthen them and keep her all the days of her life and Lord I ask Lord that you would be with this family Lord I pray that there would be such a spirit around them and God and may they dedicate everything that they have and Lord everything that they do to you and to your glory and God we we realize that we don't Glory of ourselves but Lord we come to glorify you and Lord I ask you Lord that you would bless this little baby and her family little Ellie rain and God I pray you would be with her all the days of her life Lord and we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen precious amen God bless you amen amen stand your feet tonight or this morning and amen would just invite you to the word of God and we're going to read out of second Peter in the first chap or the second chapter excuse me we're going to read from first Peter in the second chapter and we'll start in the second verse my isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen somebody say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen I'd rather be here than be in jail amen I'd rather be here than being in the hospital amen I can't think of no place I'd rather be this morning but to be in the house of the Lord I say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen isn't God's word wonderful we just want to take a few moments to to read uh a little portion of scripture and something that the Lord had put on my heart to speak this morning trust it'll be a blessing to you uh first Peter in the second chapter and we'll start in the second verse Peter says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the Builder is disallowed the same is made the head of the corner so he shows how that he's a different thing to two different people he's and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto they were also appointed but you are a chosen generation amen somebody say Amen a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past you were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now you have obtained Mercy amen we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word as you be seated this morning and I'd like to speak on this subject of a Stone of Mercy a stone of Mercy hear this scripture as Peter would uh begin to speak on this uh on this the stone and the the foundation and the and how that you were built up as a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices to God you'll see in this scripture that this is but Mark it's a powerful scripture but it shows the contrast between two different classes of people and so uh Peter shows that one is the children of Disobedience the other one were the children of God so here in this little portion he shows such a contrast of how that they react to to Christ or how that they see Christ and uh in this scripture there's an underlying reference that Peter makes to the temple Restoration in the Babylonian uh Empire or the Exile of the church how many remembers how in the Old Testament of how that that Israel had been uh captured by Babylon they went through a 70-year period of Babylonian captivity and they were and they were uh uh after this such a time that God had sent uh amongst the children of Israel a people that would restore Israel back to their rightful condition and so uh you can actually read about this in the book of Ezra and and Nehemiah uh and they they tell the story of Ezra Nehemiah and zerubabel and how that one had went in and they and they they rebuilt the walls of the city and then the other had they had built the pull pit and they they brought the word and opened the word and restored the word to the hearts of the people and then as zerubabel came into the temple and he laid the foundation of the temple and and uh and so he re build it and and the Bible would tell us that the same one that laid the foundation of the temple is the same one that would bring the headstone of the Temple and so uh we see that the Bible says it was by his hands the rubble by his hands the one that laid the foundation would also bring the headstone so we realize being Believers this morning that that was a type of Christ and showing how that that Christ would come and in his Earthly Ministry he would lay a foundation that Paul would Apostle Paul would speak of him he would say no other Foundation has any man laid than that which has already been laid which was Christ Jesus that that is the foundation that we build on this morning that's what we are that's what we establish the church on and our in our lives and our and our work is to be built upon the foundation that has already been laid but but we realize that the Bible said but the same one that that is the foundation would also be The Headstone so it look so you see Jesus as he would come in his Earthly Ministry and and that Foundation was laid and then you would see this time of judgment that would come and here Jesus would even speak of it he said my word will judge you when I gone and so you see that in this time of judgment when this great judgment would strike the Earth that The Headstone would come to the that would be that would be uh come to the Temple and so here we realize that that headstone or the Capstone as you would call it the Bible says when The Headstone comes it would bring forth a message crying Grace Grace unto it so I think it's wonderful to think that in the in the midst of judgment that God would send Grace and in the midst of judgment you realize that God has never brought judgment Upon A people without offering Mercy first God has never God isn't just a just a mean God that would go around just destroy people and but isn't even the desire of God for people to be lost hello somebody it isn't God's desire for any man to be lost it isn't God's desire for any man to to go to hell the Bible says that hell was created for Satan and his angels it wasn't even created for people but and and and if a man would go to hell it's because he fought every day of his life to get there because in the time of judgment God brings Mercy in the time of judgment God brings Grace we realize this is the headstone that Peter is actually speaking of now you'll find in this scripture as Peter is speaking he actually quotes this out of the book of Isaiah the 28th chapter he says therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion a foundation or for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure foundation and he that believeth shall not make haste in the Amplified Bible it says it like this it says he who believes in God or he who trusts in him and relies on him and adheres to to that stone brother Mark he will not be ashamed he will not give away he will not hasten away in other word in other word he wouldn't haste he wouldn't leave in a sudden panic I think that's so wonderful to think that this Foundation that we're building on brother Mah would be a foundation that whenever things that get shaky that we don't make haste whenever whenever there's a storm or something rising up that we don't run off we ain't we're not we're not fleeing we're not we're not in sudden Panic every time something hello somebody every time something Rises or there's a little problem in the church or or something going on in the world we don't we don't run back and run away from God because the Bible says they wouldn't make haste we're not we're not panicking but you you realize that many people when they read this scripture they'll actually attribute this scripture that Peter's writing to the children of Israel or or to the nation of Israel but Jesus actually makes this plain in Matthew the 21st chapter Jesus said he said I say unto them did you never read in the scriptures the same the uh the the stone which the build is rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and marvelous in our eyes therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation that will bring forth the fruits thereof here even Jesus himself brother Mark he would say that the kingdom of God it would be taken from this people that wouldn't bearing the fruits of God hello boy makes me feel good this morning but God would give that very Kingdom to a people that would bring forth the fruits of almighty God here God would establish a nation he would establish a people that were established for the very person or or the purpose of bringing forth the fruits of God but because they wouldn't bring forth the fruits of God he said but now it'll be given to a people that will bring forth the fruits of God he said and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken it's a it's a hard Stone it ain't a stone that that that can be destroyed by man he said and whomsoever that stone shall fall upon it will grind him to powder so here Jesus establishes this stone is the strength it is the very strength of almighty God it is the very it is the very thing that it's the foundation it's the rock that we build on it's the it's what we rely on it's the it's where we get our our source of of strength it's where we get our source of of food it's where we it's where we draw our nourishment from B the market it's it's the it's the foundation of our life even Apostle Paul when he would speak on it in Ephesians the 2 chapter he says now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners listen he's talking to the gentile people he said you are no more how many are gentile people if you're not Jews you're Gentile so we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God for you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto the Holy Temple of the Lord in whom also you are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit of God so here Paul takes that same scripture brother Mark that same word of Isaiah and Paul says but you were built upon it you're going to you're established on it but but what Paul does is he shows you the purpose of the building he said this building is for a habitation of the spirit of God this is why God made you it was a it was a building that was fitly framed together it was formed for a purpose and the purpose of that is that it would be a place where the spirit of God would be able to inhabit it's no wonder that Peter would say it like this he said you are a chosen people you're a royal priesthood you're a chosen generation you're a people a building that is fitly framed and it's built for a purpose God don't build anything for no reason he don't he don't go around just building things to see what it'll turn out like but everything God ever built had a purpose it was God that made the world and all that God made had a purpose every Star has a purpose the moon has a purpose the Earth has a purpose the the the ocean has a purpose the water the rain everything that God has ever made has a has a purpose the Bible said the rain comes down and it hits the field and the grass grow and it feeds the cattle and the cattle and we feed upon the cattle it's the very purpose of almighty God let me tell you friends if God built something for a purpose then what about you this morning to think that God the creator of Heaven and Earth brother marah he built us for a purpose and the Bible says that purpose was for the habitation of the spirit of God I I thank God that even though we may have they may have looked at us said well you're not Israel and and and you you didn't you didn't come for much hello somebody that's I feel like that this morning you didn't come for much but that's okay but but I was a person that obtained the mercy of God he reads the scripture this is what Peter quotes Hosea the 2 chapter in the last verse of that he says and I will swow her unto unto me in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people Thou Art my people this is what Peter's quot quoting glory to God and they shall say thou art my God who are they brother Wesley they're the people that have obtained Mercy I wonder if there's any of them here this morning the Bible says I will say unto them Thou Art my people and they shall say unto me thou art my God I wonder if there's somebody here this morning that would say that thou art my god brother the W see that it's the people of God and we ought to be able to say it it don't matter what comes brother Mark we a we ain't making haste so whenever things are going good I say thou art my god when things are going bad I say thou art my god when every when I'm when I'm well I say thou art my God when I'm sick in my body I say thou art my god when it seems like everything is just going on to to plan I say thou art my God but when everything falls apart I can still say thou art my god when the storm comes we don't make haste we say thou art my God why because we're the people that have obtained the mercy of God and the Bible says those that have obtained Mercy I say unto them you are my people and they reply Thou Art my God the Bible said thousands may fall at my right hand 10,000 at my right hand but it shall not come nigh me brother West yet don't matter how much trouble comes to this world I say Let It Come it don't matter how much my spirits of Deceit and unbelief comes to people I say let it come but ask for me in my house I say thou art my God I don't worry I don't fear I don't threat for thou art my God I know who my God is everybody knows what's going on in the world everybody knows all the troubles in the world everybody knows all the failures that they have but I know who my God is he's bigger than my trouble he's bigger than my mistakes hello somebody he's bigger than my my my my failures and my fa he's bigger than that thou art my God Bible says there'll be a bride in the end time without I feel like preaching this morning there'll be a bride in the end time without spot or wrinkle who is those people it's a people that know their God it has to be somebody to manifest it sister Tammy there has to be somebody that would come that would believe the word of God that would manifest the very the very stature of the perfect man that would put on ver uh uh uh virtue and brotherly kindness and love and patience and they would have the very knowledge of God their faith would be an unwavering Faith they would they would love unconditionally as God loved because they are the people of God that inhabit the spirit of God and manifest the fruits of God I there something that's the very message that we Preach Today brother brother Wesley that's our message it's the same message Paul said that came from the beginning it's love here that God has given us this same gospel brother Mark that we've been preaching for 2,000 years the message hasn't changed one bit it's always been the same message it's Jesus Christ and Paul said the hope of glory is that Christ Living in you and we're still preaching it today isn't it wonderful to be a part of the people of God that are preaching the message of Jesus Christ Christ in you the hope of glory it's a message brother Wesley this message Mage is a message of restoration it's a message of of a restored church it's a how many see that in the message it's a it's a message to restore that's what the Bible would even prophesy melachi said that that that that the spirit of Elijah would come again to restore or to turn Hearts what is a turning of a heart is to restore back to something else as the Book of Revelations would say that you've left your first love but here God he wouldn't leave them in that condition but he would come to the Ephesian Church he'd say but turn back to God it's a it's a message of restoration God is calling us to restore oursel back to God it's a restored Church a restored people a restored word a a a restored Worship in the church don't don't you see there's so many different ways to go to church there's so many different ways that that people have church but here God would bring his word to restore a people back to the way that God had ordained it in the beginning somebody say Amen this is the purpose of God that we would come to church the way God wanted us to go to church that we would live the way God wanted us to live that we would be the people people of God we would we would inhabit the very spirit of God and we would worship God the way God wants us to worship the Bible says the that we're true worshippers you me tell you something about true I may as well just preach it I'm here let me tell you something about true worshippers the Bible say they'll stand for truth I know the devil he'll do anything he can to keep you the church from being a true worshipper keep the worship out of the church let me tell you something about God's worshippers all the way through the scripture you'll find something that Satan has always tried to force them to Worship in a different way but the True Believer never fell for it you look at the men in Babylon that day when they came down to the three Hebrew children and they said bow down to this image and you'll be saved but they wouldn't bow down to an image brother Wesley they said no but the word of the Lord said we ain't going to bow to no image the only thing I'll bow to is my God the Creator it's Jehovah I'll not give in anything else and they said if you won't bow we'll throw you in a furnace they said well you may as well just throw us when we know our God he is more more than able to Deliver Us from that fiery furnace and they they had never seen anybody delivered from a fiery furnace but they had enough faith in God that God was able to deliver them and brother Mark they said you can take us down there you can put us in a furnace and even if our God don't deliver us we still ain't going to bow to yours why because they're Believers and you can't take worship out of the heart of a True Believer they tried to do it with Daniel you quit praying to God that way why you got to if you're going to pray they said he's still down there in his room and we heard him and his windows were open Daniel wasn't hiding what he believed he didn't have to hide around to say I'm a Believer in the middle of lead DEA he didn't have to sneak around with his friends and pretend to be a Christian he said I'm a Believer and I'm proud to be a believer they took him and threw him in a lions did and the angel of the Lord came down where he was and he stayed the mouth of the lion oh I think is't that something he nestled left with him all night long brother Westy because the angel of the Lord was there why you can't take worship out of a true worshipper when the word of the the Lord descends upon the people of God it brings a spiritual worship that's what happened to the woman at the well the Bible says when Jesus came to her he said true worshippers shall Worship in spirit and in truth you know what that tells me that when the revelation of God's word Stacks a person's heart it brings spiritual worship when the when the word comes it's accompanied with spiritual worship it's just like a a light striking a seed you take a seed in a package and that seed can sit on that shelf at Walmart for 20 years and it can sit in that same place and it'll never bring forth no life but you take that same seed and you put it in the ground and put a little water on it and you bury in the dirt brother Mark and you let the light from the sun strike that seed it don't take very long and and all of a sudden it starts to germinate and then and it brings forth life the life that has been laying on the inside of it the whole time the life that you can't see with a naked eye the life that a microscope can't find but there's something inside of it it ain't moving it's laying dormant but in the light of the sun you tell me friend there ain't no such a a thing is Supernatural what can take something that's dead that ain't moving that ain't growing that can sit forever in the dark cell and never bring forth nothing but in the presence of a lie it'll spring forth a tree and its leaves begin to BL or to bloom out and something in it begins to grow and it waves and it ain't long it brings forth the fruit of its maker tell me there ain't no such a thing as Supernatural man you can take a seed and believe the supernatural everybody's looking for some great big thing go get you an apple seed it's the supernatural God brother Mark they can it's what God made a life that can bring forth and that's what happens to a Believer brother Wesley when the light strikes the seed that is inside the heart of a Believer but a mark it changes who you are all of a sudden something begins to grow in you and and you begin to worship God you're just like that little plant you know when a plant is Young And it grows up and and my it's just you take a wheat plant when it some when it gets bigger it's kind of stiff and but when it's little it's just leaves are just flowing in the wind and my it ain't got no care in the world it's just enjoying the new life that it has I think that's the way it is with new Believers when the spirit of the Lord tracks their heart they just come to church my everybody in church is beautiful there ain't no problems in the church there ain't nobody ever argues my this is the best Church in the whole world why they're just young and enjoying the atmosphere of God it's a new atmosphere wouldn't it be wonderful if you could be a seed this morning it's a lot better out here than it was in that package it's a lot better out here than what the factory produced they packed us all in a pack somewhere and put us out and said this is how you're going to be and set you on a shelf and put you and put you to to work the way they want you to work but all of a sudden a new life comes my you're you're free you realize your real identity brother Mark it a it ain't what the world made you and it brings forth a spiritual worship how many knows it's always been that way you go in the Old Testament you'll find that when the word of God comes that worship came following the Bible says after their Exile in Babylon that Ezra the priest he came and he blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen and amen men with the lifting of their hands and they bowed their heads and they worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground in the Old Testament when Ezra read the word they said amen amen and they bowed their heads and they worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground you say why did they worship that way because the word that had been far removed was brought near unto them isn't it something this way you ever you ever have a love one that goes on a trip or something for a little while there's a a longing in your heart if you ever went somewhere there's a longing in your your heart I know when I used to go to India a lot and you go over there and you you get a few weeks out of the country and and your phones don't work and the Wi-Fi is no good you can't even talk to your talk to your kids and some of you brothers that served in the military is a lot lot more than that and God bless you for it but whenever there's such a longing that comes in your heart but brother Wesley whenever you come back and and you see that loved one again you notice all those emotions that you feel why why they cry why are they excited they that they come home and brother Mark it's because that that something that you cherish is brought near to you isn't it something something that you cherish that has been removed from you but when it's brought near to you again it brings forth that kind of emotion and you see that that's the way we are we're as people we're collectors everybody here collects something the or some things that they like they like certain little colors or little trinkets or a a lot of us they they may collect guns or or knives or ink pens or or or whatever it is or old movies or something people people collect all sorts of things in this world but but you realize that that that whenever we have loved ones and you'll keep things that belong to them I I know my grandpa had an old had an old tackle box I still got at my shop I was cleaning out my shop and I was throwing everything away and and I got to that old tackle box and and I thought well I'm never going to use it's one of them old plastic ones that don't I mean no nobody would ever take that thing fishing but I just couldn't bring myself to throw it away because it was my grandpa's that's the only thing that that that I had that that was my grandpa so I put it back on the shelf and it'll be there for another 20 years brother Mark sitting on that shelf I'll never use it but there there just something about it that my grandpa used it see it's because it's somebody that you cherish and so you you see how it is is whenever that that thing that you cherish when it's brought to you brother Wesley it brings an emotion that's what happens when the word comes to a Believer it's a cherished word Glory that word that you cherish and it's brought to your heart and it steers you and it begins to steer your heart and it and it causes an emotion out of this little human body that we have I I know the world they look at it and they say well that ain't just nothing but a bunch of emotion they're just out there shouting and screaming and dancing and crying and all this snotting around but you realize it is emotion because we're human B but it's not just but it ain't the point that it's emotion it's what stimulates the emotion see see if somebody made you mad that's an emotion but it was stimulated by by a wrong act but here whenever the word comes it causes an emotion it stimulates you and and because it's something that you cherish brother Mar it causes you to worship God it causes you to raise your hands it causes you that's why y'all been in here shouting and saying amen and Hallelujah because something that you cherish has been spoken to your heart and saying that's my God and my I love the Lord and I'm a Christian and I'm a Believer and I was called into this Marvelous Light it's something that you cherish and it brings forth an emotion let me tell you friends it's always done it it done it in the old I may as well just preach a minute it done it in the Old Testament and it done it in the New Testament the Bible says under the Old Testament how many knows the Old Testament it was the story of Israel the natural nation of Israel how God made them and brought them out and then they went into captivity and they came out of captivity and they needed to deliver and and and the Bible would tell us in the Old Testament at the end of the Old Testament it prophesies of the of the natural Babylon of Israel their natural Babylon captivity and how that God would deliver them that's the ending of the Old Testament how they went into Babylonian captivity but God would deliver but then when you look at the New Testament it's the same thing but it's a spiritual Babylon the New Testament it ends and Prophecies of a spiritual church and a spiritual Babylon and how they would go into into spiritual bondage but that God would bring them out so you see it didn't matter if it's the Old Testament or the New Testament or the natural or the spiritual it was the same thing taking place it was Christ delivering his church again somebody say Amen so when the word comes in the Old Testament it brings spiritual worship because Christ was delivering his church and when the word comes in the New Testament it brings spiritual worship because it's Christ that was delivering his church my it didn't change I I I think that's something that you can turn over just a couple of pages in your Bible but you'll find something that's the same when the word of God come the people worship God that's what the Bible said when Jesus came down off the Mount of Olives the Bible said and he was come nigh unto them what it was the word coming close and when he came nigh unto them they begin to rejoice and praise God but the Wesley they took their coats and they threw them down in their way they took the leaves and the Palm leaves and they threw them down in the way that he could walk on and the Bible said they cried out Hosanna oh the the Lamb of God he's the the very King that God has sent to the Earth Hallelujah they begin to bless the name of the Lord bless the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace on heaven and glory to God they begin to shout and praise God how many knows the only people that weren't worshiping with them somebody say it the only ones that didn't worship the Bible says was the Pharisees that was among them you say oh aren't the Pharisees on the outside oh no the Bible says the Pharisees was right in the middle of the multitude and when they started worshiping God the Pharisees didn't like it and said would you rebuke your disciples and Jesus said if they should hold their peace these Stones would immediately glory to God if they should hold their peace these Stones would immediately cry out these stones that God had made think about it he said we are Lively stones and if them Lively Stones would hold their peace well then them Stones would immediately cry out they can't hold their peace Glory why brother Mark because Christ the word was drawing nigh where is it today brother Wesley you a people are looking for God everywhere let me tell you he's right here in his people and when Christ comes n it brings a spiritual war somebody say Amen somebody say praise the Lord isn't it wonderful but tell me if it's not the truth when the word comes n into your heart it makes you want to worship God how many how many say Amen to that what causes you look around what causes it the mark Cuz the word comes n unto thee I'm going to take a break and let Paul preach it for a minute Paul said breth my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved this is the desire of apostle Paul he says for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge could that not be said about many today for the Westy that they have a Zeal of God but they don't have the knowledge of God many churches and people that come to together brother Mark and but they have a Zeal of God but not the knowledge of God for Paul said they're ignorant of God's righteousness and they go about establishing their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God in other words they're trying to they're trying to do something to be able to make it in for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that would believe for Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thy heart who shall Ascend in other other words that is to bring Christ down from heaven or who shall descend to bring Christ again up from the dead he said but what saith it in other words that we're not going to the Heavens to look for Christ we're not going in the Earth the in in in the depths to look for Christ he said but what what saith it the word is n thee glory to God somebody say n Thee the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead then Thou shalt be saved is't that wonderful that makes it really plain if you'll confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead then Thou shalt there's going to be a lot of people say that you don't think they were saved because the Bible but Paul tells us they would be saved it's a whosoever whosoever will brother Mark he says see if Thou shalt confess Thou shalt be saved for with the heart the man believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made under salvation I know we make up all kinds of rules of what will save somebody if you'll do what our church thinks you ought to do then you'll be saved if you and maybe this pastor you know I don't know a single Pastor another Pastor that think thinks every way the same the other pastor does I I used to witness a lot in the Amish community and they say well it's Amish so they we still do but but but it's Hest so that's just way they believe well that ain't true it depends on what Hest Community you go to every one of them believe a little bit different one one of them says you can smoke one of them says you can drink one of them says you can't one of them says you can have a radio the other one said it has to be battery powered the other one says you can have a a battery on your on your tractor the other one says you can't you has to be horse drawn but they're all homish but each one make up their own rules you see they're trying to make their own righteousness he said but my he said but listen but if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus a man that believeth under righteousness with his mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture says whosoever believe on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference listen because the Jews would say that if you weren't a Jew you wasn't a Christ you you wasn't a a Believer you couldn't make it the only way to heaven was to be an Israelite the only way to is to be a Jew it's your natural enage Paul says no wonder they hated Paul he said there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto them that call upon him and whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved somebody say that with me shall be saved now ain't that something he said the Lord over all is Rich unto them that call upon Him brother Wes isn't that wonderful our God is a rich God that boy make me feel good our God is a rich God he he said he's Rich over all under all them that call upon him I know God is rich in mean things but Mark he's a creator of the world the Bible say he he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he's rich in cattle and rich in lands rich in kingdoms and rich in gold and rich in silver but this ain't what Paul is speaking of he said God the same Lord is Rich unto all of them that upon him you say what was he talking about the Bible says our God who is rich in Mercy Glory that word Rich it means wealthy it means exceedingly more than enough to meet your needs I don't know about you but when I think about my God Brother David he's rich in Mercy that means he has more Mercy than I'll ever have need of my don't that make you feel good this morning that our God has a wealth of Mercy he has Treasures of Mercy brother Mar to be able to be given unto us he said for his great love wherewith he Lov loved us even when we were dead in sins he hath quickened us together with Christ for by Grace you are saved no wonder we shout no wonder we say hallelujah no wonder we praise God no wonder we dance in the spirit but I'm Mar because we're worshiping in the richness of the mercies of almighty God we're worshiping in the wealth of his grace and the wealth of his glory and the wealth of his Mercy the bible say that no good thing will God withhold from them that walk uprightly I thank God not only is he a rich God but he ain't going to withhold it from you there ain't nothing like a rich person that's stings you but I thank God that God is rich in Mercy and he ain't he ain't just holding it somewhere and keeping in his own bank account and not sharing it but our God ain't no stingy God but he's giving it B said he won't withhold it from you all of those that will walk uprightly Oh my he was rich in Mercy my if that was money we was talking about y'all be running all over this building if I said our God was a billionaire and he was giving everybody a million dollars you know what you'd do but Mark you take that million dollars like they do in the movies and you'd pile it up all over the bed and you'd jump on it and you you just hang all over it and you just sew it in the air and have your party with all your cash let me tell you that's the way I feel about the mercy of God he's gave so much Mercy to me I can't contain myself and sometimes I just want to put it all up in the air and just Waller in it I just want to move in the mercy of God that he's given unto me you just let me have my way I'm just going to Waller in the mercy of God he's bestowed it unto me my God is rich in Mercy and he ain't going to withhold it from glory to God he ain't going to withhold it from you he'll give you all that you ever have need of you'll never you'll never run out of of the grace of God and need more grace it it'll never run out don't you realize friend there ain't no it no matter how far you go God's arm can go farther he's he's got he's rich in Mercy my it makes me feel good this morning let me just Waller in the mercy of God lord just pour it out let me just wall in the mercy of God brother Mark he won't withhold it from you that's the song We Sing M we don't feel worthy of it do we let me tell you how I know man we get to talking about it and you can't hardly move well I know it's a Mer but somebody say hallelujah hallelujah God gave enough Mercy to overcome the feeling that you well I ain't been to church in two weeks brother mad you know I say God gave enough Mercy to overcome your problem so you may well just say Amen anyway it's the word of the Lord that's coming n to thee you may as well praise God anyway the Bible said if they don't praise him the rocks will cry out I'm So Unworthy of such Mercy now aren't we all though Unworthy of such Mercy but when he was on the cross I was on his mind we're Unworthy of the mercy of God but he won't withhold it I don't know about y'all it makes me want to have I'm Unworthy of the mercy of God but he won't withhold it is that something somebody give you a gift man I don't deserve that you come out work for somebody do a little bit of work and they come by and they give you way way you know $1,000 you help them for a few hours oh no brother I didn't I didn't do that much work I I was just here for a couple hours I no I'm not wor but no but I want to give it to you that's the way God is with his Mercy I'm not worthy of it I I didn't do anything to deserve it Glory but he won't withhold it my may he won't withhold it brother Mark it's the mercy of God we're Unworthy of it but he won't withhold that's isn't that what Isaiah said last Sunday I touched on that how that he said I'm a man of unclean lips amongst the people that are unclean people but the angel of the Lord the Bible said the angel of the Lord brought a live coal how many knows what that coal it wasn't like a charcoal but it was a stone they would heat up the stones and and and and that stone it become red hot and they put that up on the Altar and then they'd reuse them each time but the Bible says but the angel of the Lord took tongs and he took a live coal off the Altar and he touched the lips of Isaiah and he said that man that was of unclean lips now he could go do the work of the Lord even though he said I'm unworthy but then whenever God gave him a commission he said send me oh Lord a man with a man that was unworthy but because he was touched with that Liv Stone brother Mark isn't it something that Peter that Peter would call it a Liv Stone he said Jesus was a livestone in other word brother Mark what was it if he's a Liv Stone he was the fire I'm getting somewhere just a minute he he said if he was a Liv Stone he was the fire of God that would cleanse us my cuz the Bible says whatever touches it would become clean here it was the it was the stone of God let me tell you something about this Jesus if he's a live Stone and and brother brother brother Jared and whatever touches it will become clean it's no wonder that the leper came in there I'm going to tell you something about a leper the leper was unworthy the leper had to go when he come into town the leper had to announce his presence by saying I'm unclean I'm unclean and if he didn't they would kill him they' Stone him to death you you can't sneak up on a bunch of people and bring your plague in amongst them so he had to announce it at the door I'm unclean I'm unclean don't know nobody get by me I'm unclean I'm unclean this is the this is the the life of a leper leprosy is a type of sin that's why many of us we come to church we come brother jar we come in with our head down I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm unclean well well Brother come on to church and you come down sit down on a Pew but I'm unclean I'm unclean I can't I can't have any Liberty I I can't worship God I I I can't I can't get right I'm unclean I'm unclean that's the way people think about the gospel I'm unclean I'm unan C though he was but listen what the leper says even in his leprosy the Bible said when Jesus come down from the mountain and the multitudes followed him the leper had a revelation that other people didn't have listen what he said he said the Bible says the leper came and worshiped him that's the Pharisee wouldn't worship him but the leper would the Pharisee wouldn't get near him but the leper would and the Bible says the leper came and he worshiped him he said Lord if thou will thou could make me clean amen he first worshiped God he said and if you would I know you could make me clean and listen what the Bible said Jesus put forth his hand here's that Lively Stone touching him Jesus put forth his hand and he says I will be thou clean isn't it something If thy will make me clean and Jesus's response was that is my will man you know you don't feel like you can be right with God and you don't you don't feel like you can have Liberty to in the house of God anymore but come in as the leper and worship God anyway and say Lord if thou will I know thou can make me clean it's the will of God that you will be clean so what he do he got close enough to that Lively Stone that it touched him and the Bible says it made him clean and immediately his leprosy disappeared immediately his leprosy was cleansed he didn't have to go through a seven-step program to get back in the church he didn't have to go through everybody's little Book of Rules of what allows you to come back in the house of God and be a part of the worship of God but the Bible said immediately when he touched that Lively Stone but Mark the leprosy was cleansed off of him immediately he was made clean that's what happened to the maniac down there whenever Jesus went to him he said what have I to do with thee Jesus of Nazareth he said come out of him you don't belong in him and he cast The Demon into the swine and the Bible said when Jesus went down think of many people had came in his presence but when he met Jesus he was made clean that's what he told the woman that was through at his feet that was an adulterous it don't matter what your problem is when she was an adulteress they caught her in the act of adultery and they threw her at Jesus's feet and what he did Brother Wesley the Bible says he went down and got the drawing in the sand he said whichever one of you don't have a sand you cast the first stone the woman still sitting there with her head down I'm unclean I'm unclean and Jesus Took her by the hand and he said now woman he said look around where are thine accusers nobody stuck around why because they all had sin just like she did CU they were living in flesh and he said NE neither do I accuse thee so go and sin no more now when he touched her she became can't clean a't that something I to touch that Lively Stone brother B said see he said he cleans his people by fire the Holy Ghost in fire not by a declaration of Creeds or books or something that you've got to learn a bunch of prayers and so forth that ain't how God cleans you he cleans them by fire off the altar isn't that wonderful that's how God cleanses his people as way he's always done it when they came to the upper room 120 was in an upper room the Holy Ghost fell tongues of fire fell on them they were cleansed and ready for service cuz that's how God cleansed he said God don't cleanse by knowledge God cleanses by fire that's why God that's why the you come to church and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but Mark it's the very fire of God that comes to clean the church I know when people look at it they say well isn't the fire of God the Judgment of God but this isn't talking about the Judgment of God but this fire of God brother Mark isn't judgment it's the very mercy of almighty God it didn't wonder that fire would bring judgment but out of that same fire that God that God would bring Mercy you know what that tells me that Mercy is greater than judgment I can preach a whole message on that's what the Bible said the Bible said that Mercy triumphs over judgment so when judgment would look to Prevail Mercy is going to Triumph when judgment looks like it's got you all the way down brother Mah and there ain't no way back for you but Mercy triumphs over judgment it's greater it's a greater Victor it's stronger in battle it's more power than judgment has Mercy triumphs over judgment Our God who is riching Mercy think about it he would call on you when before judgment was tracked that's the purpose of this very message but a mark is to call a people back to God to redeem a bride back to himself in the time of judgment so God would send a gift into this Earth and for the very purpose of drawing you out of denominations and out of Creeds and out of the things that men have made back to the very Cross of Calvary and to the man Jesus Christ think about it that was the message what is the attraction on the mountain it was to draw you think of it it was to draw you to something back to Christ the message invisible Union how many knows what that message was about invisible Union the the the whole message of invisible Union was to show that you can't be married to two husbands at the same time that was the that was the basis of the message you can't have two husbands at the same time so here God W would would show that you that people are married to a church they're married to a denomination they're married you know if you ask them something that well the church says the church says the church says the priest says the the pastor says it's all but but but it ain't nothing about that but God would come and say you can't be married to that husband but be married to Christ be led by Christ led by the Holy Ghost see so it was a restoration back to Christ and so but if God is going to restore you do I got just a minute if God is going to restore you then God would have to provide a place that you could take what was unclean and put it see God if you're going to come in the church and he's going to restore you in the church then God would have to provide a place for you to for you to put all that sin nature see he couldn't just let you carry it because he's going to do away with it so he has to make a place for you to bury it and that that you don't have to die with it this is the problem with people this is why people people can't be Christians because they carry all this baggage from their whole life and they don't know where to put it I've been like this my whole life and I've done this and I done that my my and it's all the history of their life and they ain't got nowhere to put it so they pack it to church every time they come to church and they can't get free and worship God they pack it home and they they pack it in their problem when they're driving down the road with their husband and wife well I know what you did and I know what you did and they can't ever have a relationship cuz they're still stuck on something that happened in their past life they're packing it and they got nowhere to put it we here God would provide a place to put it a that something you don't have to carry there glory to God you don't have to carry there the rest of your life but God would make a place that you could put it that you don't have to die with it you remember you remember the story of Hosea and and Gomer his wife remember she was a she was a harlot and God sent Hosea and he went out and he married a harlot and he took all of the things of her life and he said you put them away and now she'll be made clean and so he married her and she became his bride and after a little while the Bible would tell us that she went back out and was playing the part of a harlot again now in adultery so G not or or Hosea when he would come you'd read this in Hosea the 2 chapter that Hosea goes and he starts speaking of the Judgment upon Goomer because of the condition she was in and the adultery she was in but notice in two scriptures I'm going to read these Hosea when he speaks of her judgment it looks like she would be destroyed and he says I will visit upon her the days of balum wherein she burned incense unto them and also a type of of Israel in their condition she decked herself with her earrings and her D jewels and she went after her lovers and she forgot me sayeth the Lord see it's a time of judgment I'm going to visit her because she forgot me she's put on her she's she's adorned herself in jewels and and she's went back into these other men in adultery he says so she forgot me but notice the very next verse watch what do God does with that here she was an adulterous woman she was she was all kinds of unclean brother Mark but then the very next verse he says therefore behold listen what God's this is what God's judgment looks like here comes the wrath of God he said but therefore behold I will Allure her in other words draw her I will bring her into the Wilderness and speak comfortably unto her here the very one that looked like judgment was coming that's what the attraction on the mountain was brother Mark it was the luring of God that God could draw us out of that all that confusion and all that that that nobody knows what's right and what's really wrong and and and what's really true and and and couldn't tiw the scripture together but God he would Allure her he said I will bring her out into a place that I can speak comfortably comfortably to her so even in the time of judgment God would bring her to a place that he could speak to her about the mercy of God isn't it something that's what the Bible says I will give her the Vineyards from then listen what God gave her I'll give her the valley of aor for a Door of Hope how many remember Wednesday night the valley of acor that's where that's where uh achen was taken because he had sinned Israel went into battle they lost the battle the only battle Joshua lost and because they lost the battle they went they found sin in the camp it was Ain and his family they took him to the valley of aor and they stoned them and burned them and and they buried the sin in the valley of acor but notice the purpose of the story brother Wesley is that after the Sim was buried they went back to the same battle and they won the victory so here God says but I will give her a valley of acor for a door of hope this is what God's telling you so you can take your past and you can take the sins and the failures and I'll give her this Valley in other words this is your possession Gomer and you can have it it'll be your door of hope that whatever that whatever would stop you from having a victory and whatever would stop you from moving on with God that you have a place to bury you that you can go back out and be victorious you can go back out and and be a righteous in the sight of God he said I'll sing to her and it shall be that make I don't know about y'all but it just touches my heart that God would give you a place to bury it but what is he showing us that you can bury it and you can carry on people feel like they can't go anymore with God I've done messed up to many times I've been to the altar a 100 times I've done repented a 100 times I still do the same thing and there ain't no hope but he said I'll give her the valley of acre as a door of hope you can bury it and go back out and win the victory over that you don't have to worry you don't have to worry about what tomorrow holds bury it go back out and win the victory God ain't going to leave you in judgment he's given Mercy ain't that wonderful in the time of judgment there's always Mercy he said and it shall be in that day sayith the Lord you shall call me ishy in other words husband you shall call me ishy and call me no more Bali for I will take the names of balam out of her mouth why a't that something all that all that doctrine of BM you get to talking to people and you can tell what church they came from because of the the the terminology that they use he said but I'll take all that out of her mouth and you'll just call me husband I'll draw you unto me where the only thing left in her mouth would be the word of the Lord my it ain't what the church says but it's what the word says it a it ain't what the priest said it's what the word said it ain't what the pastor said it's what the word said take all that out of her mouth and go back to the word of God listen brother Mark what he did is he gave her an authority in the word a new identity he said You shall call me husband see she was identified by another name I just think that's something that's the way this world is today but W see they're in an identity crisis they don't know what they are who they are they don't know who they want to be everybody wants to change to be something else or somebody else but my Bible says you are fearfully and wonderfully made let me tell you what we ought to do but Mark we ought to take what God made us and glorify God god with what made us quit trying to be something else and be what God Made You and glorify God with what made you because you were fearfully and wonderfully made don't be ashamed about what you are who you are or how God Made You just be proud of what God Made You and glorify God in the very image that God has made you in amen I'm going to close is this whatsoever a man Seth he also reaps that's the law we were speaking of it last Sunday that God would put what God would put in you he would get out of you it was a law of sewing and reaping notice what the prophet say says see you're sealed in you're beneath the blood you don't go out no more he said you're God's son and God's family sealed in by the Holy Spirit and the devil couldn't get you if he had to isn't that something you're God's son in God's family and you're sealed in by the Holy Spirit but let me tell you a secret before you were sealed in by the Holy Spirit you were still God's son and God's family isn't that something you were part of God Jesus said I've never lost one all that the father hath given me will come unto me they already belong to God he said you're a creation you're a creation of the word how are you a creation of the word brother Mark for only one reason because you was predestinated to it have you thought of this God's word can I can I have five minutes God's word is an eternal word but Mark the Bible says in John the first chapter in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God it was made it it was a God's word is an eternal word Paul said through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God God so that things which we see were made of things which or or were not made of things which do appear they were made of the Unseen to see the world was framed by the word of God here he says listen what the prophet said the foundation stone listen and the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world catch this now this is my whole message the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God I thought when I read that that is such a powerful statement the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world I thought on that well you know what and it really when you first read it brother Mark it didn't really make sense the foundation stone was laid in you because when you read that Christ was the foundation well well we know that that word seed didn't come in you before the foundation of the world because Jesus teaches that differently he says whenever the whenever the master would come and he would sew seeds some of it would fall on Stony ground some of it would fall on on good ground he said but but then and it would bring forth according to the ground that it fell on remember some of it fell amongst the thistles some of it the Birds the seed so we see that that seed actually came at some other point right Jesus is showing it so it couldn't be that that he was talking about it was a foundation stone my the more I got to reading that the more I dug into it this is a powerful statement the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world so if it ain't a word seed then what is it after all if it ain't if it ain't that that that that what we what we read is our foundation brother Mark what is it well you find this word used in Revelations 19th Chapter or the 21st chapter the Bible said is speaking of the New Jerusalem and in the New Jerusalem the Bible says the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones so whenever John saw the New Jerusalem come down he said they were garnished and the First Foundation was Jasper the second Sapphire the third chidoni the fourth Emerald the fifth sardinis the sixth sardus chelot barel topaz uh kusus and Jin and amethyst and so he goes through these 12 names that the foundations of the of the of the wall of the new city of Jerusalem would be would be garnished with so you see that these Stones brother Mark there was 12 of them because they typed the very tribes of Israel matter of fact it was the same Stones they they they use different words but when you look through the Bible I'll just skip the the study but through the Bible dictionary it's just the same stones with a different name but you'll find that these same Stones were written in Exodus 28th chapter where whenever the Bible says that God would would send Aaron to be a priest that these Stones would be put on the breastplate of Aaron the high priest so the Bible says there would be three across and then three more three more until all 12 stones and there would be written on them the names of the children of Israel so you see the same stones that was the foundation of the city are the same stones that was written on the breastplate but I notice the reason they are written upon the breastplate of Aaron notice that your name was written on it the stone on the breastplate of Aaron this is the urum thumm this is what this is what was used to judge the word so when somebody would come and say a word they would take the breastplate of Aaron and hang it up and all those stones off of each other they would determine whether it was right or not and they it would put forth this in such a way that you would know it was correct and today the prophet said today we got that same thing it's called The Bible and so when a man speaks something you ought to be able to take it and all those stones should still line up it ought to be able to reflect the very light of God so it can't be contradicting itself your your theology can't contradict Genesis and contradict Revelation it's got to all tie together but see these Stones were them Mar that each one of them were written on them a tribe of Israel so what what it what it represented is the stone that was on Aaron's breastplate actually represented their seed line or their genealogy so in other words if you if the if you was of a jasper stone then you were of the tribe of Reuben because Ruben was a he was the oldest son and that was the first stone and so to be to have a jasper stone would would tell the seedline that you came from so if you say well you're you're carrying that Jasper well he's definitely of the tribe of Ruben he come from the seed line of Ruin because that was the stone that identified that seed line it it was the sons of Jacob and they and they just to make it simple it was the but but the the sons of Jacob or of Israel and they were the 12 tribes of Israel and each one of them their lineage or their natural lineage was was was uh identified by that certain Stone so the foundation stone would be the very stone that would identify the seed line that you came from now you watch this through history Josephus whenever in the first century he actually took those stones and he combined them with astrological signs he said well he said well you know kind of made some connection to it and here in the in the 16th century in Poland there was philos phos opers that took that same thing and brother Wesley they they took it from astrological signs and attached it to months so now each month there's a stone that is affiliated with the month that you were born in which was before was attached to your astrological sign in 1912 in the United States the national uh uh uh uh gemstone whoever the Jewelers or the the group of Jewelers but in 1912 they actually gave the ones that we that we use today the garnet and all that all that there was a stone that identified the birth month that you were born in so you see that this birthstone that we use and although they're wonderful and they're fine and the jewers make money from it and we love to give them to people on the month they were born but it really has no significance over your your life or where you come from or or who you were and you see so so the real so the birthstone they're they're giving you a birthstone to show what month you were born in but let me tell you friends but here the prophet would say but the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world so you see this foundation stone brother Mark it ain't identifying the month that you were born in it ain't identifying the sign that you were born under but that foundation stone brother Jared is your real birth stone that that foundation stone is identifying the seed line that you were born into why if Reuben was a Jasper he said but you the foundation stone was in you it wasn't a month it ain't a star it ain't a sign it ain't referring to your natural seed brother Mark but it's referring to your spiritual seed line so the foundation stone in you is the predestinated seed of almighty God it's the seedline glory to God it makes me want to preach it's the seed line that you came from that's the foundation stone of your life it's where you it it ties you to your Gene it ties you to who your father was just like Jasper tied you to Reuben this foundation stone that that God has put in you tied you to almighty God you belong to him that's why he put it in you that's what Paul said he said for whom he did Forno somebody say Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among men any Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate he also called who he called he justified whom he justified he glorified who shall say or what shall we say then to these things if God be for us then who can be against us now you can't change your natural father I know they do all kinds of surgeries today to change a lot of things but you can't change who your daddy is brother Mark you can't change it well I don't like my daddy no more I'm going to take his name off my birth certificate it ain't going to do no good he's still your daddy let me tell you something about God when you come from God you belong to God you always were from God it don't matter what the devil does he can take you he can put a new name on you he can cause all things to come to your life that it can't change who your daddy is he can't take it away from you somebody stand to your feet this morning he can't change where you came from you're of your father it ain't the father of the devil but I'm of my father the one that made me brother Mark fearfully and wonderfully made that foundation stone was put in me before the foundation of the world ain't that wonderful Peter said you as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ your Lively Stones might at something God's house brother Mark the foundation is a sure the foundation how the walls the they're garnished the way God would garnish them in the beauty of the image of God he's made you he's built you a certain way that that an attribute of God would be able to dwell in you you notice we're all different he we like different things we each one we have a little bit different nature but you realize that every one of us if God Made You he made you to display an attribute and to as a body of people the very same thing that Jesus was we are you have an attribute you have gifts that God has given to us the attributes of God that are given to us and here God would call us in this end time in the midst of judgment to display the attributes of God and his Mercy Now isn't he wonderful how many Lively Stones do we have this morning your Lively Stones
