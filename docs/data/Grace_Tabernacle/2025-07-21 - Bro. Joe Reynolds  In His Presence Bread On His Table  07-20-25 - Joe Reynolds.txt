And there there was such a liberty. There wasn't no restraint. There wasn't no more uh uh uh kindness or backward back backwards or funny feelings or emotions. Actually, brother Brian, they dismissed those things. Amen. They created an atmosphere to bring things to pass and it it brought a liberty. No doubt.

You can never this. You can never bring forth a child. There's no way that you could overcome this. You're well stricken in age. Your body's already filling you. There's no chance of it. You'll never get over it. You'll never get over this. &gt;&gt; Listen, if we have breath in our body this morning, &gt;&gt; it ain't over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

In his presence there's joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David would make a statement in Psalms and say it like this. In his presence is the fullness of joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; This tabernacle was designed to habitate the atmosphere for change. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Old Testament, there was an outer court, &gt;&gt; inner court, and the holies of holies. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; On the outer court, Sister Joyce, the mana that would drop. &gt;&gt; It would begin to spoil. &gt;&gt; It would begin to rot. &gt;&gt; It would begin to decay. But that same mana in the Holies of Holies, Amen. It was good today. It was good tomorrow. It was good next week. It was good next year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference was it was in the presence &gt;&gt; of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother R would say this about Aaron's rod. He said, "But when a man was on the outside, it was just an old rod." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was just an ordinary stick. He would be carried along in Aaron's hand till it was dried up. There was no life in it. He said, "That's the man that's cut off from God." that the man that's without Christ, that's the man may be a member of a church but knows no more about God than a hot and hot would know about an Egyptian knight walking on. He said, "Oh, I belong to a church." It was it was in Aaron's hand. He was used he he was used but dead. But when the robe was put into the holies of holies into a consecrated place of God and God provided place the presence of the Holy Spirit, he says, "You know what happened?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It began to bind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And blossom &gt;&gt; and yield almonds. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Outside there was no liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was just a dried up stick.

But there came a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And gave his life and gave his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And all we got to do is get into his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, he said blossom and yielded almonds in one night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says that's what we need today is picking up and taking beyond church membership. &gt;&gt; That's right. into the holiest and the presence of the consecration of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What was it? The life that it ought to have been. It was dead and just like a tentpole there. &gt;&gt; But it was a tree. It was an almond tree. All right. &gt;&gt; But it was dead. &gt;&gt; There's many people tonight professing Christianity, but it's dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hopeless. &gt;&gt; They wander along just knowing they belong to a church. And that's not only Presbyterian, Lutheran, so forth. That is in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true." He said, "What you need today is come before Christ." And look what happened. Now, the first thing it had to be refreshed to bring forth buds. It budded out. Not only did it bug, it brought forth blossoms. No one. Catch these things, church. We're going somewhere this morning. Not only did it blossom, but it it brought forth fruit. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it'll be. That's the way it'll be. Are you hearing me, church? It didn't just come in there and sit there and and and had to be begged into it or No, no, no. It was a dry rod. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It was just a dry dead &gt;&gt; no life. The Reb said out there. But that brother David Paul when it came into the holies of holies there was a presence or an atmosphere or an environment amen to bring forth what it was in the first place. It didn't bring apples, it didn't bring oranges, it brought what it was in the first place. He said not only did it bl uh begin to bring forth, but it brought fruit. It blossom. It It was beginning to change in what it was intended in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Outside it was dead. I say church this morning outside we was dead. There was no hope. There was no way of escape. Amen. But one day this body got in the presence of the som and it brought life into existence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; As brother Matt said, I'm trying to behave myself. &gt;&gt; He said it blossom, bear fruits. You'll be a worker in your community. You'll be a show winner for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll be a new person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Old things will pass away. Traditions of men will fail. But your heart will be burning. Oh, I like this. Your heart will be burning with the love of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Inside this place where they took these old rod, laid it in the presence of God. God living in the glory of the cherubams. The rod all happened at once. Oh, he says, "Oh, brother and sister, to the light that's concentrated, lays before God. It'll change them and certain amount standing at this platform." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It'll take all the fight out of you. &gt;&gt; Charles, it'll take all the fight the fighting out of you. It'll take all the differences out of me. &gt;&gt; It'll take all the isms out of you. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his presence, &gt;&gt; he don't just sweep it and all. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, he just don't cover it and all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He begins to dismiss. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Islams don't belong here no more. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to work it up. &gt;&gt; It's something that's doing it within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The dead rod didn't do nothing but come in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it lays her before God. It changes them. &gt;&gt; It takes all the isms out of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like this. It'll make you a real Christian &gt;&gt; if you'll just &gt;&gt; get into his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh church, we take this world and place it in the dirt and get into his presence and the atmosphere, it just happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It brings forth or manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What it was from the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church. We always was. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We came from God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we're going back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're trapped in this world as a dried up stick. &gt;&gt; But God who's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Aaron carried that rod all day long outside of the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It benefited in working. It benefited in different ways, but it was just a dead stick. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. But the atmosphere &gt;&gt; in the presence &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; when it came from the outer courts &gt;&gt; into the holies of holies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It brought to life what it was in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh church, these dried up sticks of clay &gt;&gt; born in sin, shaped in iniquity. But when we get into his presence, &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John, he said, "And no man can come to me, &gt;&gt; the father with father which has sent me has draw them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That there's drawing power. Brother said it, brother Brian, it's not from a church. It's not from a man. Amen. It's from It's not from your pastor, he says, but from glory. The baptism of the Holy Ghost moving down in the right channel and the environment is right and it draws you up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God to access to his life. Zoe's life. &gt;&gt; God's own life. Aonio's life never had a beginning, never have an end. whole church. Amen. When that seed gets in the presence of that that kind of environment, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It makes preachers out of them. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; It makes deacons. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This makes trustees. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It makes song leaders. &gt;&gt; Amen.

But when this old dried stick, could you imagine? Can you visualize it just for a moment? It's time. No, time's good. &gt;&gt; Time's good, &gt;&gt; Sister Destiny. Then we just look at it for a moment and visualize that rod that was dried up. The color was a all pale color like a driftwood maybe &gt;&gt; brother and it didn't look much to look like and to look upon rather brother Joe they might not think you're much but listen when they got that raw and Aaron laid it into the presence of the holies of holies &gt;&gt; could you imagine if you were standing in that room and all of a sudden that old stick that was dry with no life I could imagine I'm just dramatizing.

Your problems may be here. Your circumstances may be here." &gt;&gt; No matter where you are, the circumstances that you may be in, &gt;&gt; Jonah was in a belly of a whale. That's right. &gt;&gt; In the bottom of the ocean, &gt;&gt; brother said, "If anybody had circumstances, he had them." &gt;&gt; There was seem like there was no hope. &gt;&gt; But he turned himself back to the promise. &gt;&gt; And he created his own atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In the belly, in the bottom of the ocean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your problems may be there.

This one said, "Oh king, get will you give us a pig?" &gt;&gt; Oh, it was granted. And they begin to ask just like we do sometimes. They just begin to ask certain things, granted.

You can't hide good enough, I'm going to find you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, say, "I'm a nobody." Peter probably felt that way, too. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he began to deny Christ three times, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; And by the law, he lost his disciplehip. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Looked like there was no hope for Peter. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus rose from the dead, he told that woman, he said, "Go tell my disciples and Peter." &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't leave Peter out. &gt;&gt; Cuz he had already Peter had a work. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Peter was going to be refreshing others. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peter is going to be standing on a soap box preaching the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go tell my disciples and Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Psalms 91.

Shadow here means it's a conjunction. It runs parallel with shelter. &gt;&gt; It portrays God's protective presence as a constant enveloping surrounded completely shake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Break it down, brother. &gt;&gt; I would say the Lord, he's my refuge and my fortress.

He shall cover thee with his feathers protected presence. &gt;&gt; Under his wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid by the terror by night, or the error that flyth by day, the passing that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction wasted at noon day. A thousand shall fall at thy side, 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh unto thee because you're wrapped in the secret place of the most high God under the shadow of his protective presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's liberty when the enemy comes in like a flood.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Nothing happens to you this morning without Papa God knowing about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we step into his presence for a moment? &gt;&gt; In closing here, he speaks about Gerus's daughter &gt;&gt; and listen what brother Brown says. When he walked into the home where they was at, how could he do anything with this kind of unbelief? &gt;&gt; That's right. Jesus himself walked into the house and brother said, "What could he do with this such unbelief?" Watch what he does. &gt;&gt; He said, Brother R said, he said, "Every one of you &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Doubt, get out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unbelief, you're dismissed. &gt;&gt; Fear, you got to go. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said he every one of you get out. And they put them out of the house. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was getting the environment right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Joe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it takes a little house cleaning. &gt;&gt; It takes a little feeling cleaning. It takes a little uh draano in our lives to clean out anything that's not and like him. Oh, we want to we want to become bread on his table. Amen. But sometimes we want to hold on to the garments of the world. Amen. We want to keep this little hidden places in our heart. And we play the part. We come to church and we sing, we shout, and we go home. We're still carrying the little luggage of unbelief. &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we can't ever overcome. We wonder why we can't be victorious. We wonder why we can only shout on certain days and not on others. Why? We can worship on some services and some we can't. So, we're carrying some baggage. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And we don't want nobody to know about our luggage. &gt;&gt; So, we kind of hide it. &gt;&gt; But there was no hiding when Jesus came around. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, he said, "Oh, no. This ain't going to happen." Reason why she's in this condition because unbelief is here. Doubt is present. Fear is present. He said, "I put them all out of the house. Get the get every one of them out." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Bring Peter, James, and John." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bring faith, hope, and charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Just like he said in the scripture, he replaced a stony heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What was that, brother Rab was saying?

He says, &gt;&gt; "That's what he had. Bring them in." He walked over there and all on the outside of the wall was unbelief. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Everything on the outside was unbelief.

I want to count by when brother says we." &gt;&gt; That's right. I know there might not have been a mouse in the pot. I want to say me right here. &gt;&gt; I'm part of the Wii. &gt;&gt; Well, John, I'm part of the Wii. &gt;&gt; He says, "And we ought to get ourselves in that kind of an atmosphere." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, could we be overcomers this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Funny feeling, you've been riding my back long enough. &gt;&gt; You You you demonic power of fear.

Amen. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden there's just a joy and the presence of the Lord is such a fullness of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden this sister Sister Denisha comes to the piano.

It'll kill you." He poked him back down. Said, "I'm not taking no for an answer. God's my healer. God's an everpresent help in the time of trouble." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the doctor said, "You're withered. Your stomach is gone. You'll never get over this. You'll always have this problem." Brother said, "You know what? I would have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been not been for the vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The vision told him and the in in the mess of the wings of a snow white dove. He said that he that spirit of the Lord spoke out when that squirrel missed his mouth and hit his stomach and went and fell on that cactus. He went over and put his foot upon it and the spirit of the Lord came out said, "Your enemy is dead." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the doctor, he went back to the doctor, the doctor said, "Brother Brand, I ain't got no good news for you. I always have that problem." He said, "Oh no, doubt, you're dismissed. Oh no, fear, you're dismissed." &gt;&gt; I would have been a discouraged boy.

But sometimes God's saying, "You need to let go of this. You need to let go of this enough so I can come down and show you that I'm still your God and I'm your deliverer." &gt;&gt; That's free this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that is for somebody. God's good.

Lord God, that we can put out everything that's unlike you, Lord, and allow the liberty bells to begin to ring in our life, Lord. Let go of things that we've been carrying for so long, Lord God, to allow victory in the camp, Lord God. Can we be like the lepers that went down to the enemy's cave and took back what rightly belongs to them, Lord? Can we have that mentality? And brother Brown would say it like this, Lord. It was their little dingy faith that they got encouraged enough to say, "This ain't the way I should live. This ain't the way I should be. This ain't my place of worship. I'm going down and take back what belongs to me." Lord, I pray that somebody could get to that place this morning. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we pray. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's say of course you sing oh peace of God.

Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. &gt;&gt; Watch your hand before that word we heard this morning. So good to us. [Applause] He said in in the hand of or out outside of the presence of the Lord, that rod was just a dry rod and he used it for whatever. But when he came into the presence of the Holy of Holies, it began to bring forth the original purpose of what it had. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're here this morning, you may be a dry rod. You might be a dead stick that Satan used out there in the world to do whatever he wanted to use you for, but you just come and lay in his presence and that original purpose of what God had inside of you will begin to bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's certainly good this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's just as we get ready to go, let's sing that song. I've been changed. I've been reborn. &gt;&gt; All my life has been rearranged. When you make come into that presence, the Lord will come and he'll rearrange everything and you'll begin to do that which he has promised for you, purposed for you. &gt;&gt; Well, I've been to the water and I've been baptized. I've been washed by the blood of the lamb. Well, I've been changed from the creature that I once was and redeemed is now my name. Oh, and I've been changed. Oh, I've been reborn now and all my life has been rearranged. Oh, what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. All my life, praise God, have been changed. And though my sins were as scared, they're white as snow. I was bound, but today I am free. Oh, I was lost out in darkness, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. Cuz I've been changed. Oh, I've been reborn, but now all my life has been rearranged. Oh, what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. All my life. Oh, let's sing that second verse once more.

Oh, what a difference it makes since the Lord has his way all my life. Praise God has been. Oh, give a hand clap of praises. At once, like a bird in prison, I dwelt. Oh, no. Freom from my sorrow I felt. But then Jesus came and he listened to me and glory to God. He set me free. Oh, he set me free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke the bonds of risen for me. And I'm glory bound by Jesus to seek. Glory to God. Jes. [Music] Oh, darkness of night has drifted away. Oh, my feet are planted on higher ground. And glory to God. I'm whole bound cuz he set me free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke the bond of risen for me and I'm glory bound by Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. He set me free. So goodbye to sin and things that found. Oh, not of this world shall turn me around. Oh, daily I'm working and I'm praying too. And glory to God, I'm going through. Oh, he set me free. Yes, he set me free. Oh, he broke the bar of ris for me and I'm going my Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. He set me free. Oh, I just thank you this morning. Let's just bow our heads now. Heavenly Father, we just come before you thanking you for the word that you spoke to us, oh God. Lord, that we just know we just got to get in your presence, Father, and you'll settle the rest, oh God. Lord, there's nothing that we can do, Father, that we can work up, Father, but we just got to sit in that presence, in the presence of the sun, Father, and the life will just bring forth. Oh, God. We just pray that you would just bless brother Joe for pouring out himself this morning, Father. May you just give strength and virtue to him. God, just bless him. Lord, be with those that are coming back from Manchester, our pastor, and those that went with him. Father, watch over them. Give them traveling mercies. Lord, we just love you. We thank you. Be with us as we go about our week. Father, just be with each one. Bring us back safely Wednesday, ready to hear your word, Lord. We just commit everything to you. We just say we love you. We thank you. We appreciate you. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory today is mine. Because I told Satan to get thee behind. Oh, victory. Oh, God bless you as you go this morning. Oh, and when I woke this morning, &gt;&gt; I didn't have a doubt. I knew that my Lord would bring me out. So, I got down on my knees. I said, "Lord, help me please." And I got up singing and shouted to victory. I'm singing. Victory is mine. Oh, victory is mine. [Music]
