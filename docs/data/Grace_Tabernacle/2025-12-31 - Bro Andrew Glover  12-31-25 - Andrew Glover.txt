It's okay to get into the spirit and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just say it's good to see everybody tonight. See brother Glenn back there and been a while since he's been able to go to church and after he was hit by a car and and uh is lucky to be alive. who's actually standing outside of his vehicle when a car came down a a hill on ice and hit him. Been through several surgeries and unable to walk and and move and bedridden at times and been battling through uh many uh uh different things physically over the past several months. So, I just say God is good. He's merciful and we've been praying for him. It's sure good to see you [music] able to get out and and and come to church tonight. So, uh, we we just we just want to we just want to get out of the way and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come to have church tonight? And we don't want to put a limit on God. And everybody's going to get fed tonight. So, and you're going to get fed in the natural, so we may as well get fed in the spiritual. And and I think I think we just need to enter into the spirit and be influenced by the spirit of God. And I'm going to read you something out of the out of the the Patmas vision. said, "Have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of the things that are in the world and they go to the ball games and sporting events and the dances and and enter into the spirit of it? They don't sit there like wall flowers and old dried up sticks, but they enter right into the feel of things and they become part of it. But oh, how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word. They call us fanatics and holy rollers and there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred or disapproval. But here's some advice for you tonight. Are you ready? You just ignore that. Somebody say it with me. You just ignore that. You can expect it knowing where it come from, but you just go on and get in the spirit of worship. &gt;&gt; So you ignore whatever it is that would try to quench that or put that out and go on and get in the spirit of worship. See, because our spirit is clean. It is fresh. It is real. It is sober. It's serious. But nonetheless, it's full the joy of the Lord. And the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of the pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it savors and delights in it pleasure in its pleasures. I think we're exuberant. How many's exuberant tonight? Amen. We are to be exuberant and so on fire for God. And we're emotional creatures. And you know what brother Bam said? He said, "But our emotions are on the Lord of glory." The whole We're all emotional creatures and people get emotional about a lot of things. He said, "But we our emotions are on the Lord of glory." So I just say this tonight, we the if the world can go out there and get and get into a ball game and and they get emotional about win no matter what. And they get emotional about about doing their cha slide. Don't you get on me when I get a little emotional about about I'm going to rise above it all and let a brother get a microphone and talking about a man that was lost in sin and God took him and rose him above it. Don't get on me when I get a little emotional about it. Cuz there's something on the inside of me. Say what it is. My emotions are on the Lord of glory. &gt;&gt; David danced before the ark. Why did he dance? Because his emotions were on the Lord of glory. I wonder how many tonight I can say my emotions are set on the Lord of glory. So go ahead and get in the spirit of the thing. Amen. And we can get in the spirit of whatever we're in. We can get in the spirit of the Lord. So if God is moving tonight, you just go ahead and get in the spirit of worship. Get in the spirit of ministry and get in the spirit of Holy Ghost filled preaching and and get in the spirit of pulling from the gift of God and let God have his way in our life. &gt;&gt; This is the last service you'll ever have this year. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm not going to enter into it without getting into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's my l How many can get into it tonight. Just get into the spirit. Don't be Don't be stagnated, but get some joy and our salvation. How many say that tonight with me? My emotions are on the Lord of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise for all that he's done for you this year. All that he's been to you this year. He's a great big God and he deserves our praise. key of thee. Well, I've got a feeling. Oh, everything's going to be [music] all right. Oh, [singing] I've got this feeling that everything's [music] going to be all [singing] right. Oh, I've got this feeling. Everything's going to be [music] all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be [music and singing] all right. Well, God sent Moses to lead all his people out. And Pharaoh's heart was hard. He thought he'd give them a new route. So, he [music] chased them [singing] all down to the Red Sea shore. He thought he wouldn't have to worry about Moses anymore. [music] But Moses stretched his rod out over the sea. And the Lord answered [music] Moses with a little gentle breeze. I can see Moses now with a smile on his face. Just telling all the people with [music] his gentle [singing] grace. Oh, I got this feeling everything's going to be [music] all right. Oh, I got this feeling that everything's going to be all right. Oh, I got [music] a feeling. Oh, everything's going to be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Well, a little boy named David went out to fight a giant. And everybody laughed at such a funny little side, a little shepherd boy armed only with a [music] sling. And beside mighty Goliath seemed such a puny little thing. But David said, "You come to me with spear and a sword, but I come to you in the name of the Lord." And he put in a stone and he gave it a sling. And when he left his hand, David, he began to sing. Oh, I got a feeling. Hallelujah. Thank you. Oh, I'm going to be all I say that I' got a feeling. [music] Oh, everything's going to be all right.

Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Can I tell one more? &gt;&gt; Tell it. &gt;&gt; And now for the greatest story [singing] of them all. My Jesus was a dying and hell had all [music] for all the demons were rejoicing. They thought they had won the war, but soon they would not be laughing anymore. Cuz on that first Easter morning when the sun woke [music] up the [singing] earth, then the caverns of the deep opened up as to give birth. And then a resurrected savior with healing in his wings. And now the host [music] of children and rise and sing. Well, I've got a feeling. Oh, everything's going to [music] be all right. Oh, I've got a feeling [singing] that everything's going to be all right. I got a feeling everything's going to be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Be all right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; 25ation. Father present together [music] All right. [music] They're standing up on the reitsu [music] and all the problems and different things. at the same time all the time out of no ways when our when we were sick and body Lord when loved ones were at the point of death and you come on the scene as Jehovah Rafa Lord if anybody's got a right tonight to be happy it's the bride of Jesus Christ Lord you brought us through another year and Lord as we're going to speak your word I pray you would come I pray you would come in revelation Tonight, may you drive out every spirit, oh God, that's unlike the Holy Spirit and may your anointing find a right away among this congregation, Lord, the hands that have been raised, Lord, asking you, Father, Lord, just come by my way and speak something special to me. Lord, you will in no wise turn away one of yours, Father. Lord, help me to get myself out of the way tonight. My feelings, my the things I've studied, the things I've looked at, Lord. Lord, I surrender myself to you. have your way among us tonight and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. For it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, "Amen." And amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we'll invite you in the word of the Lord. We want to go to the book of Jude, the book of Jude, the first chapter. And then we're going to go to the book of St. Mark, the 11th chapter. Amen. The book of Jude, the first chapter. And I just want to pick up there again in that third verse of Jude chapter 1 and verse number three. You love the Lord. Tonight, &gt;&gt; Jude here writing, he says, "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly, now we looked at that Sunday, not half-heartedly, but with everything that's within you, contend for the faith, not contend for faith, but the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. Now in the book of St. Mark the 11th chapter, St. Mark chapter 11 and the 12th verse. St. Mark 11 verse 12. This is a very uh familiar scripture to us as believers. I believe it's one of the promises that was was a u was left for this generation in St. Mark 11 and verse 12. And on the marorrow when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves, he h far off having leaves, he came if happily he might find anything thereon. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said unto it, "No man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever." And his disciples heard it. Now, if you skip down to the 19th verse, and when Eve was come, he went out of the city. And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter calling to remembrance, saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away. And Jesus answering and saith unto them, Have faith in God. How many knows the prophet of God taught that and said, Have the faith of God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in the heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Now therefore I say unto you, what thingsoever ye desire when you pray, now watch this, believe that ye receive. Let's say that together. Believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them. We ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seat here uh this afternoon. I I want tonight by the help of the Lord for for just a few moments here this evening if I would uh take a title tonight. I want to speak to you on this appropriating the faith. We were speaking Sunday morning on contending for the faith. Tonight I want to speak to you on appropriating the faith. And 1955, Brother Bram's preaching again in earnestly contend for the faith, Chicago, Illinois. He says, "Now, Father, these few broken words that have been spoken now some 45 minutes long tering of the message, the word to get to the people. If they can only receive the word, then they'll have you in their hearts." Ain't that simple? If they can only receive the word, then they'll have you in their hearts. And when I am miles away, they will still have the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. Father, the best of my knowledge, I have told the truth. And all that I know how to say that is the truth. It's the faith. And now, Lord Jesus, you who so wonderfully said these words, I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world. He says, "Now want you come tonight and manifest your resurrection, in the power of deity, in the power of vision, in the power of healing, in the power of forgiveness of sins. Manifest yourself to this." He says, "We wanting children hungryhearted." Now, this is where I want to draw this from. We want to see the manifestation of the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. We want to see the manifestation of the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Now, no matter how many times you come, Lord, I still love it. Amen. I want to see it again and again and again. Amen. For I love you and I want to be with you forever. Now, I can stop there tonight and say that's the desire of my heart. Amen. Is I want to see the manifestation of the faith of God. Amen. Not just on Wednesday night or on Sunday morning or in a special meeting. Amen. But I believe that as believers, we have a right by redemption to see, Amen. the faith of God manifested in our lives every day of our lives. Now he said another place may we purpose in our hearts tonight to be quiet. Amen. Before the Lord and wait upon him. He says wait. He says moment by moment expecting the right word to be said or the right thing to be done. He said that would give us the appropriate faith. Amen. That would dash right into the blessings of God. Amen. AMEN. I THINK THAT'S powerful that Satan does not want you. Amen. in the blessings of God. BUT HERE A PROPHET IS SAYING, AMEN, that when the word begins to come forth, that the word, amen, will literally clear a way between you and the blessings of God and you can move into them. Then that tells me that it's actually spiritual warfare, amen, that's not wanting you to go into the blessings of God. The prophet of God would say, "Now the Holy Spirit moves the same today." Right? He said Paul and is going away. He said, "After I'm gone, grievous wolves will enter in." Amen. And they will not spare the flock. He said, listen, though we are an angel, he goes to Galatians 1 and he says, "Though we or an angel from heaven would preach any other gospel to you." Amen. Than that which has already been preached, let him be accursed. He then ties Galatians 1 to Jude 1 and says, "Beloved, I gave all diligence to write unto you that you would earnestly contend." Amen. For the faith that was once delivered to the saints. He said, "Now, do you see what the faith is?" Now, watch this. If your church, if your church teaches that AND EXERCISES THAT, GOD BLESS YOU. HE SAID, "BUT IF IT DOESN'T, AMEN. THEN KEEP PRAYING UNTIL GOD COMES." AMEN. And vindicates himself. He said, "There's a Cain in the midst of you." Now, Amen. I know one might SAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. AMEN. BECAUSE CAIN is dead AND HE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT. BUT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID, HE SAID, "AS she the bride is a part of the groom." He said, "True to him in every point, waiting for the wedding." Amen. uniting not at the ecumenical council but in the sky at the wedding supper. He said she has been given and revealed to her. Amen. I'm talking about you. Amen. The seven seal mysteries of the Bible. He said SHE SEES THE FOLLY of the deceiver. Amen. AMEN. THIS BRIDE IS NOT IGNORANT SAINTS. THIS BRIDE IS NOT CONFUSED BUT SHE SEES. AMEN. THE FOLLY OF THE DECEIVER. AMEN. It's so very CLOSE TO THE TRUTH THAT it would deceive the elect if it was possible. HE SAID, "NOW, DO YOU SEE, AMEN, those two opposing spirits, Amen, at work in this evil age?" Can you see it? Amen. Each are very religious. He said Cain and Abel, Amen, their spirits again, Amen. are coming to their heads. Amen. Still the same as they started. Amen. One is WORSHIPING BY BEAUTY, BY KNOWLEDGE, AND BY EDUCATION, AND BY SCIENCE, AND by ethics. Now, that's one. Amen. And the other one is worshiping by the faith of the revelation OF THE WORD OF GOD. NOW, WATCH A PROPHET. AND BOTH OF THEM IS STANDING RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING this morning. NOW, AMEN. THAT'S ALL THE WAY IN 1965. AMEN. That the spirit of Cain and Abel, AMEN, WAS STILL ALIVE and it was still well. Can I PREACH TO YOU TONIGHT? AMEN. AND I WANT TO BRING IT RIGHT HERE TO 2025. AMEN. RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN is here. And the spirit of Abel is here. And they're looking to influence you to worship. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED to the saints. THE SPIRIT OF CAIN DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ANY HOLLERING or any shouting OR ANY REJOICING OR ANYBODY JUST GETTING CARRIED AWAY IN THE GOOD OLD HOLY GHOST. AMEN. THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF CAIN. AMEN. [snorts] BUT THERE'S ANOTHER spirit here and it's the SPIRIT OF ABEL. AND IT DOES NOT WORSHIP BY SCIENCE. IT DOES NOT WORSHIP BY BEAUTY. IT DOES NOT WORSHIP BY ETHICS. AMEN. BUT THE SPIRIT OF ABEL WORSHIP IS BY REVELATION. AND I WANT TO TELL EVERY DEVIL IN HELL TONIGHT, THERE IS A BRIDE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SHE IS NOT MOVED BY EDUCATION. SHE IS NOT LED BY SCIENCE. SHE IS NOT EXCITED BY ETHICS. BUT WHEN THE REVELATION OF THE WORD OF GOD BEGINS TO BREAK INTO HER HEART, IT'LL PUT A SHOUT IN HER VOICE. IT'LL PUT A SONG IN HER LIPS. HEY, THERE IS A people in THESE LAST DAYS WHO ARE NOT just contending for the faith, but they are witnessing the manifestation of the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. I'm talking as we as we sat there on Sunday. Amen. That this is the bride's contention. Amen. I want I want to establish something. RE SAID THE problem today is the Methodists are contending with the Baptist. AND HE SAID THE PENTECOSTALS ARE CONTENDING WITH THE CATHOLICS. He said, BUT THIS IS NOT CONTENDING with each other. He said, "This is contending FOR THE FAITH." AMEN. I WANT TO REVISIT THAT FOR just a second. Amen. Contend don't exactly mean to argue. Amen. But contend means to debate. IT MEANS TO HOLD FAST to your conviction. AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE FAITH, RIGHT? And that was THE FAITH OF GOD WHICH WAS RESTORED BY THE MESSENGER OF MALACHI 4. AMEN. GOD RESTORED THE BIBLE FAITH. AMEN. To the church OF THE LIVING GOD. THEN I CAN SAY TODAY WITHOUT ANY HUMILIATION. BIBLE DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN. AMEN. AMEN. I CAN SHOUT IT FROM THE TOPEST FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS. BIBLE DAYS ARE NOT COMING. BIBLE DAYS ARE HERE. YOU SAY, "OH, IF I WAS JUST LIVING IN THE DAYS OF THE BIBLE to see the overcomers and and to SEE THE POWER OF GOD." AMEN. SHAKE YOURSELF TONIGHT AND REALIZE YOU ARE LIVING IN THE GREATEST HOUR THAT ANYONE HAS EVER LIVED IN. IT'S THE HOUR WHEN THE POWER OF GOD HAS RETURNED TO THE CHURCH WITH A MIGHTY FORCE BEHIND IT TO MANIFEST the word of life. Amen. That's why Jude said, "I exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered." Somebody shout delivered. The faith that was once delivered unto the saints. Now, when you look there at that word delivered, it means to give into the hands of another. So it was in one set of hands but it was given into another. It means to give over into one's power. Amen. Or use. It means to deliver to someone. Amen. Something in order for them to USE IT. BROTHER BRIAN. IT MEANS to deliver VERBALLY BY REPORTING. SO WHEN WHEN THE FAITH OF GOD BEGINS TO BE DELIVERED, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY POWERPOINT, FOLKS. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY CHARTS. AMEN. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY SOME INTELLECTUAL GURU that rose UP OUT OF SOMEWHERE THAT'S GOT THE IDEAS ON THE BIBLE. NO, THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIBLE FAITH AND IT'S GOING TO COME A BIBLE WAY AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO INSPIRE, AMEN. those who are worshiping by revelation. Amen. [laughter] I I I can't talk about reporting and not go TO ISAIAH 53. WHO HAS believed our report? &gt;&gt; AND TO WHOM IS THE arm of the Lord revealed? How many knows brother Bam had a seventh grade education? Amen. But he stood there and taught school in the pull PIT LIKE HE WAS A LIKE HE was a theologian. HE STOOD THERE AND SAID, "NOW LOOK," HE I don't want to say taught school. UH HE PREACHED THE BIBLE. AMEN. BETTER THAN ANY BOB JONES PROFESSOR COULD DO. HE SAID, "NOW YOU JUST READ THAT WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR REPORT." HE SAID, "THAT'S A QUESTION." HE SAID, "NOW WATCH THE LORD answer the question with a question." And says, "And to whom is the arm of the LORD REVEALED?" LISTEN FOLKS, IT TOOK A PROPHET TO MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS. HE SAID, "IF YOU HAVE BELIEVED OUR REPORT, THEN THE ARM OF THE LORD HAS BEEN REVEALED UNTO YOU." THE CHURCH WAS LOOKING FOR THE ARM OF THE LORD, WHICH IS THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE POWER OF GOD. AND THEY WERE MISSING IT. BUT A PROPHET STOOD THERE AND SAID, "IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THE REPORT, THEN THE POWER OF GOD WILL COME AMONG YOU AND WILL BEGIN TO RELEASE UNTO you a revealing of the word of God in the hour you're living in." Amen. He stood there and he said, "Now he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor come in us, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty we should desire him." REBRAHAM STOPS AND SAID, "NOW WATCH." AMEN. NOTICE that he [laughter] and then this is a person. It's not a creed. He is despised and rejected a man. HE IS A MAN OF SORROW. HE IS ACQUAINTED with grief. We hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs AND CARRIED OUR SORROWS. YET WE DID ESTEEM him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. Ram comes along and says, "Now watch. Here's the atonement. He was wounded for our transgression. HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF OUR PEACE WAS upon him and with his stripes we are healed. COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S NOT IN THE FUTURE. AMEN. THAT'S A PAST TENSE HAPPENING. HE SAID, "SEE, ALL WE LIKE SHEEP HAVE GONE ASTRAY. We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord have laid upon him the iniquity OF US ALL. HE WAS OPPRESSED. HE WAS AFFLICTED. YET HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH. HE WAS BROUGHT AS A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER AND AS A SHEEP BEFORE THE SHEARS IS DONE. SO HE OPENETH NOT HIS MOUTH. HE WAS TAKEN from the prison and from judgment. WHO SHALL DECLARE HIS GENERATION? HE WAS CUT OFF out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people. WAS HE STRICKEN? AND HE MADE HIS GRAVE WITH THE WICKED AND WITH THE rich in his death because he had done no violence. Amen. Now neither was any deceit IN HIS MOUTH. AMEN. NOW COME ON CHURCH. THIS IS MORE AMEN THAN A BOOK REPORT. This is more THAN A LECTURE. BROTHER SAID JESUS we have no record where he went to school. He was just an ordinary man. HE TALKED WHERE THE COMMON PEOPLE could understand him. He said so THERE WAS NOTHING OUTSTANDING ABOUT his looks and so forth that you could MAKE HIM WHAT HE WAS. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM, YOU COULD NOT IDENTIFY HIM BY THE WAY HE LOOKED WITH THE POWERFUL PROPHECIES THAT WAS CONCERNING THE MESSIAH. HE SAID WHAT HE WAS IS NOT BY OUTWARD APPEARANCE. FOR HE WAS A MAN OUTWARD, BUT ON THE INSIDE HE WAS GOD WHICH WAS EMMANUEL THE FATHER GOD WAS IN HIM RECONCILING THE WORLD TO HIMSELF. HE SAID SO THERE HE brought the Christian faith. old church. They were looking for faith and missing where the faith was at. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GO DOWN HERE TO THE RABBIS. WE WE GOT TO GO DOWN HERE TO THE SEMINARIES. WE WE GOT TO GO OVER HERE TO THE SCRIBES, THE PHARISEES. AMEN. WHERE CAN WE FIND THE FAITH? AND THERE WAS THE FAITH OF ALMIGHTY GOD VEILED BEHIND THE FLESH OF THE VIRGIN BORN SON OF GOD. OH CHURCH, he said, "WHAT DID JESUS DO? HE BROUGHT GOD TO HUMAN LIVES." BROTHER JOE, GOD WAS MADE HUMAN WHEN JESUS was born. HE SAYS GOD BECAME MAN THAT HE MIGHT BECOME FELLOWSHIP with man and in man. Now not with man ONLY BUT IN MAN. NOW WHY WAS HE TRYING TO GET IN MAN to achieve ONE PURPOSE THAT IS TO BRING MAN TO BRING TO MAN WHAT GOD IS. AMEN. NOT WHAT A CHURCH IS BUT WHAT GOD IS. SO JESUS CAME THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT GOD TO MAN AND man didn't want it. Amen. I'LL SAY IT LIKE THIS. AMEN. NOW, I I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS, OKAY? CUZ THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD BRING THEM DELIVERANCE. THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES. And I want to say this to you. ONLY THE FAITH THAT was once delivered to the saints has the power to deliver you. ONLY THE FAITH THAT WAS DELIVERED, AMEN. NOT BY THE RABBI. AMEN. NOT BY THE S BY THE SCRIBE. AMEN. BUT BY GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH OF JESUS IS THE only thing that has the power TO DELIVER. REMEMBER SAID THAT LITTLE WORD FAITH, IT GETS IT GETS mixed up a lot of times with the word hope. He said they're just as different as day is from night. He said faith is the substance and hope is what you're hoping for. Now listen WHAT HE SAYS. HE SAYS FAITH DELIVERS. AMEN. There is a direct connection between deliverance and faith. IN 1951, HE SAID, "AS SOON AS REAL GENUINE CHRISTIAN FAITH EVER ANCHORS INTO A PERSON'S HEART, LET THEM BE BOUND IN A WHEELCHAIR, LET THEM be blind," or whatever it is. He says, "They'll tell it." THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'LL SCREAM OUT, "I AM HEALED." THEY'LL SAY, "HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE?" YOU'LL SAY, "JESUS SAID SO AND I BELIEVE IT." HE SAID, "SEE, THEN THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATION OF OUR CHRISTIAN FAITH IS THAT Jesus Christ lives today. Oh church, THE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATION of what we BELIEVE IS BUILT UPON THE PRINCIPLE OUR GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE IS NOT IN A TOMB in Jerusalem. He is not IN A GRAVE IN JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT IN A MUSEUM IN JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT IN THE MOUNTAINS OF ARIZONA. HE IS RIGHT HERE TONIGHT JUST ALIVE AND WELL TONIGHT AS HE WAS 2,000 YEARS AGO. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A CHURCH FAITH. It's a living faith. Amen. When something is delivered to you, IT IS COMING FROM A SOURCE. SAID, "WATCH, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, the son can do nothing in himself, BUT WHAT HE SEES THE FATHER DOING." REB COME ALONG and said, "See, we're contending for the faith that was once delivered. It had to come from somewhere if it was delivered to the saints. Is that right? He said, "The faith that was once delivered unto the saints, WHO DELIVERED IT?" NOW, COME ON. IF I MAKE A DELIVERY TO YOUR HOUSE, THAT'S ONE THING. If brother MATT COMES BY YOUR HOUSE, THAT'S ANOTHER THING. AMEN. IF YOUR BUDDY COMES BY, THAT'S ANOTHER THING. He said, "Who delivered it?" Amen. a little while and the world see me no more. But ye SHALL SEE ME, FOR I will be with you, even in you to the end OF THE WORLD. AND THE THINGS that I do SHALL YOU DO ALSO, EVEN MORE THAN THIS. FOR I GO UNTO MY FATHER. HE SAID, DO YOU GET IT? HE SAYS, the faith he represented, he delivered. Well, that ought to make YOU PUT YOUR SHOUTING SHOES ON. AMEN. THE FAITH he delivered, he represented, he delivered to the church. AMEN. TO TAKE IT TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD. OH CHURCH, AMEN. GOD SENT YOU A PACKAGE IN THE LAST DAYS WITH THE FAITH OF GOD ON THE INSIDE of it that it would bring ABOUT A MANIFESTATION OF THE POWER of God in YOUR LIFE. NOW, I GOT A BIG QUESTION FOR YOU, OKAY? HOW DOES GOD deliver something or bring something to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. GOD DON'T HAVE NO AMAZON TRUCKS OF FOLKS RUNNING up and down the ROAD ALL DAY. HE DON'T USE UPS. HE DON'T USE FEDEX. COME ON. HE HE HE DON'T USE YOU, THE POSTAL SERVICE. HOW DOES GOD GET SOMETHING TO YOU? WELL, IF YOU GO TO ROMANS 10, HOW SHALL THEY CALL ON HIM AND WHOM THEY HAVE NOT HEARD or believed? AND HOW SHALL THEY BELIEVE IN HIM OF WHOM THEY HAVE NOT HEARD? AND HOW SHALL THEY HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER? AND HOW SHALL THEY PREACH EXCEPT THEY BE SENT? AS HE HAS WRITTEN, "HOW BEAUTIFUL are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace AND BRING GLAD TIDINGS OF GOOD THINGS, BUT THEY HAVE NOT ALL OBEYED THE GOSPEL." ALL THE WAY IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS, PAUL IS STILL PULLING. AMEN. FROM ISAIAH 53 AND SAID, ISAIAH SAITH, LORD, WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AMEN. SO THEN FAITH COMETH BY HEARING AND HEARING BY THE WORD OF GOD. REMEMBER SAID GOD CANNOT MAKE anyone believe. GOD CAN ONLY REVEAL HIMSELF IN DIFFERENT FORMS. HE HAS REVEALED HIMSELF IN THE WIND, in mysterious movements, IN THE FORM OF ANGELS. AND HE HAS REVEALED HIMSELF IN MAN BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL. COME ON. [laughter] I I JUST MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE GLOVES OFF AND PREACH. AMEN. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO GO INTO ANOTHER YEAR. AMEN. WITH A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE MINISTRY. AMEN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COME FROM. I'M JUST PREACHING. AMEN. AMEN. THEY'RE JUST THE MAILMAN. AMEN. BUT THEY'RE DELIVERING WHAT GOD IS SENDING UNTO YOUR ADDRESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WATCH A PROPHET. HE SAID, "THAT'S A THING TONIGHT. QUIT ARGUING RELIGIONS AND DIFFERENT PHASES AND ARGUE ABOUT DIFFERENT CHURCH DENOMINATION. ARGUE ABOUT DIFFERENT NATION." AMEN. NO. What the world needs tonight IS TO KNOW THAT JESUS HAS RISEN from the dead and HE LIVES AMONG MEN. NOT ARGUE about pinpoint this and cut this and move this and THIS AND SPIRE. JUST FORGET IT and look unto him and believe HE RAISED FROM THE DEAD AND he will manifest himself to you. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. YOU SAY, "WELL, IF AN ANGEL WAS PREACHING THAT." AMEN. That's what people say. IF AN ANGEL WAS PREACHING THAT, THEN I WOULD RECEIVE IT. BUT A PROPHET SAID GOD DIDN'T ORDAIN ANGELS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE ORDAINED MEN TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE NEVER SAID TO THE ANGELS, "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND IN YOU." HE SAID TO MEN, "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND IN YOU." HE NEVER SAID TO ANGELS, "THE THINGS THAT I DO SHALL YOU DO ALSO." HE SAID TO MEN, "THE THINGS I DO, YOU SHALL DO ALSO." SO THE GOSPEL COMES BY PREACHING OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND IT'S MANIFEST HIMSELF THROUGH HUMAN BEINGS. MY THE PRO GOD SAID, "BRINGING SINNERS TO REPENTANCE." AMEN. BY THE PREACHING OF THE WORD. AMEN. AMEN. I'm just going to go AHEAD AND SAY IT. I THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE SERVICE IS THE PREACHING OF THE WORD. I THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE THE THE PART OF THE SERVICE THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR. AMEN. AMEN. IT DON'T MATTER WHO'S PREACHING. IT DON'T MATTER HOW BIG, HOW SMALL, HOW TALL, HOW SHORT, HOW EDUCATED, HOW UNEDUCATED. I JUST WANT TO HEAR WHAT GOD HAS DELIVERED UNTO THIS GENERATION. And then I just say what a prophet said. He said by the preaching of the word and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit, they become submissive to the word of God. AMEN. THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL wants to control YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PREACHING OF THIS GOSPEL IS BECAUSE BY THE PREACHING THIS GOSPEL, IT IS THE DESTROYING OR THE MORTIFYING OF YOUR FLESH. AMEN. THAT YOUR LIFE MIGHT COME SUBJECT TO THE WORD OF GOD. NOW, AMEN. I JUST WANT TO INTERCEPT this here. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS IN THE PREACH OF THE GOSPEL. IT'S NOT WE ourselves &gt;&gt; as ministers. We are not THE GOSPEL. NOW, THERE'S A ROOM FULL of preachers HERE TONIGHT. AND NOT A ONE OF THEM IS THE GOSPEL, &gt;&gt; BUT WE ARE ONLY TRANSMITTERS THAT TRANSMITS THE VOICE OF GOD THROUGH OUR agency of men to the hearer. Reverend said, "Now listen ON THE PLATFORM WHEN THE HOLY Spirit is speaking and he's speaking through mortal lips, he always does." He says, "I believe these are ministers behind me." And brethren, you never preached a sermon in your life. &gt;&gt; Woo! You talk about humbling yourself. YOU NEVER PREACHED A SERMON IN YOUR LIFE. THE HOLY SPIRIT preached through you a sermon. Amen. That's right. SEE, WE DON'T PREACH. THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES THE SPEAKING. OH, WE MIGHT WRITE OUT SOMETHING AND READ IT. BUT THAT ISN'T PREACHING. HE SAID, "PREACHING is when inspiration comes AND IT'S PREACHED BY INSPIRATION AND THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVES THE UNCCTION." COME ON, FOLKS. NO MATTER HOW BURDENED I AM IN MY HEART, AMEN, TO DELIVER SOMETHING, UNLESS THE HOLY GHOST WILL COME BEHIND WHAT'S BEING SAID AND QUICKEN SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART, IT'LL BE JUST ANOTHER SERMON. OH, BUT YOU WANT TO SEE A MANIFESTATION OF THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. LET the word BEGIN TO BE PREACHED AND LET SINNERS COME TO REPENTANCE AND LET PEOPLE SAY, "I'M SORRY AND I'M WRONG." LISTEN, THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A GOOD SERMON. THAT'S THE UNCCTION OF THE HOLY GHOST BRINGING YOU IN LINE WITH THE WORD OF GOD. COME ON. THERE'S A RAPTURE COMING. THERE'S A RESURRECTION COMING. THERE'S A BODY CHANGE COMING. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. IT'S BY THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We can read something that don't matter. But when the HOLY SPIRIT GETS A HOLD of it and takes it out to the people, THEN SOMETHING TAKES A HOLD. NOW, I LOVE THIS. HE SAID, "HOW DID HE BRING CHRIST HERE?" WHO IS CHRIST? The anointing, right? &gt;&gt; The anointed word. Now, HOW DID HE BRING CHRIST HERE? BY THE WORD OF THE PROPHETS. HOW WILL HE BRING HIS BRIDE HERE? BY THE word of the prophets. THEN JESUS PROMISED, LISTEN, THE BODY of believers would do the same works that he did. And when he left the earth, NOW LISTEN, HE LEFT THE outline or THE SHAPE THE BODY OF CHRIST SHOULD BE IN. &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NO LONGER HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK LIKE. &gt;&gt; We no longer HAVE TO WONDER WHAT AN AXE CHURCH LOOKS LIKE. WE have received a blueprint. Amen. I I love brother Billy PAUL'S TESTIMONY. HE TELLS IT LIKE THIS. HE SAID YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED BUILDING THE DEN there in Arizona, HE SAID SOMEBODY COME BY AND THEY AND THEY TOLD THE MAN THAT was building it said they'll do this and do that. And brother Billy Paul said this. He said before the man started, he said, "Brother Brandon went to him and he said, "Now buddy," he said, "there's going to be a lot of people come by and they're going to tell you to change this and add that and do this this way and do that this way." He said, "Just nod and grinned and say THANK YOU AND STAY WITH THE BLUEPRINT." OH, I thought, man, that's more than just good A GOOD TESTIMONY. AMEN. I I I don't know about you, BUT BROTHER MATT, I WANT TO USE THAT ON THE FIELD. AMEN. AMEN. I'VE BEEN PREACHING SINCE I WAS A KID AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, "Preach it this way and do it that way and DO IT THIS WAY." AMEN. BUT LORD, JUST HELP ME TO SMILE AND NOD AND GRIN AND SAY, "THANK YOU. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M GOING TO STAY WITH THE BLUEPRINT BECAUSE THE BLUEPRINT HAS GOT TO MATCH WHAT GOD LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH TO BE. &gt;&gt; I'LL BE WITH YOU IN YOU DOING THE SAME THINGS I DID WHILE I WAS HERE in this body." Now listen at THIS. HE SAYS, "I WILL BE BACK IN MY MYSTICAL BODY DOING THE same thing." &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I WILL BE BACK IN MY MYSTICAL BODY DOING THE SAME THINGS IN THE MYSTICAL BODY THAT I DID IN THE CORPORAL BODY. OH, the only thing his death was at CALVARY WAS TO SAVE a sinner and to produce to the church the power or the authority. He said, "Now listen, the faith that was once delivered to the saints, here it is. What was it? IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF Christ in THE APOSTLE." I I want I want you TO CATCH THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A CONTRADICTION between contending for the faith AND APPROPRIATING THE FAITH. ACTUALLY, THEY GO TOGETHER. WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS is one is defending the truth and the other IS LIVING THE TRUTH. NOW, NOW I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS BECAUSE THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE HERE IS THE FAITH. SOMEBODY SAY THAT WITH ME, THE FAITH. THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE IS THE FAITH. NOW, AMEN. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE IS A DEFENSE OF THE TRUTH FROM ERROR. THERE IS A STANDING AGAINST FALSE DOCTRINE. THERE IS A PRESERVING OF THE ORIGINAL WORD. AND THERE IS A MAINTAINING THE PURITY OF THE MESSAGE. NOW LOOK WHAT JESUS SAID. HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY." NOW, WATCH THIS. BELIEVE THAT YOU receive them AND YE SHALL HAVE THEM. LOOK AT THIS WORD RECEIVE. TO TAKE A HOLD OF IN ORDER TO USE. Look here. It means to claim for oneself. It means to appropriate TO ONESELF. AMEN. I WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS BECAUSE THAT LITTLE WORD APPROPRIATE has two powerful different meanings. [laughter] Amen. I'm not I'm not a I'm not a English major, but I I'll I'll pretend like it. Uh the first meaning OF APPROPRIATE IS AN ADJECTIVE. &gt;&gt; I thought that's pretty good. WHICH IS A DESCRIPTION, RIGHT? SO IT MEANS IT'S SOMETHING suitable or proper in the circumstances. Now I want TO SAY THIS, GOD IS AN APPROPRIATE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. anything he does or anything HE HAS IS APPROPRIATE. I'LL SAY THIS, GOD HAS AN APPROPRIATE TIME. GOD HAS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE. GOD HAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY. LOOK HERE IN THE DAYS OF NOAH WHEN THE WORLD WAS UNDER THE ANDALIAN DESTRUCTION. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THERE WAS ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE IN THAT DAY that overcame. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM COMES ALONG AND SAYS THERE WAS EIGHT OVERCOME. He said, "Now they entered the ark AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME." HOW DID THEY DO IT? THEY LISTENED TO THE WORD OF GOD. COME ON. WHAT NOAH WAS DELIVERING VERBALLY, THEY WERE HEARING IT AND THEY WERE BELIEVING IT AND IT WAS PUTTING THEM IN THE ARK OF SAFETY. AMEN. YOU LOOK AT JOHN CHAPTER 11. I'm just just using a few examples here. IN JOHN CHAPTER 11, LAZARUS DIES. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID JESUS MADE THE QUOTATION. HE DIDN'T DO ONE THING EXCEPT THE FATHER showed him in a vision. HE SAID, "NOW he knew Lazarus was sick AND HE KNEW HE WAS DYING AND HE STILL WENT AWAY." HE SAID, "NOW WATCH." BUT THAT LOVELY LORD JESUS INSTEAD OF RETURNING BACK, YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE WENT ON A LITTLE FURTHER AND HE JUST IGNORED HIM. AND THEY SIN AGAIN AND HE STILL WOULDN'T GO BECAUSE HE WAITED TILL THE APPROPRIATE TIME THAT HE KNOW THE FATHER HAD TOLD HIM WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. SO, THE APPROPRIATE TIME WASN'T WHEN HE GOT THE FIRST EMAIL. &gt;&gt; And then I'm I'm preaching a little bit here. THE APPROPRIATE TIME WAS NOT WHEN HE GOT THE FIRST TEXT MESSAGE, BUT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WAS WHEN THE FATHER BY VISION HAD SHOWED HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE A RESURRECTION. AMEN. [laughter] I I I'M JUST GOING TO BRING IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE OLD TESTAMENT. OKAY? In 2 Kings chapter 4, there was the Shounamite woman and the Bible says that she built a room onto her house. SHE DID A FAVOR, AMEN, FOR THE PROPHET. SHE BUILT A ROOM ON THEIR HOUSE AND THE WOMAN WAS HONORING GOD AND SHE HONORED THIS PROPHET AND SHE SEEN GOD AND THE PROPHET AND SHE WANTED NOTHING FOR IT. BUT THAT PROPHET WANTED TO BLESS HER AND HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID? SHE SAID, "I DON'T LACK FOR ANYTHING." HE SAID, "WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN." NO MORE THAN GAHESA SAW HIM. NO DOUBT THE PROPHET SAW A VISION AND HE SAID, "THUS SAYAITH THE LORD, GO TELL HER IN THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR IN THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR THE APPROPRIATE TIME A YEAR FROM NOW SHE'LL EMBRACE A SON." ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD, THAT BOY WAS OUT IN THE FIELD WORKING WITH HIS FATHER AND HE FELL SICK OF A OF A OF A SUNSTROKE. AND THE PRO OF GOD SAID THEY TOOK THE BOY IN THERE AND HE SAID, "NOW LOOK WHAT THEY DONE." HE SAID, "THE WOMAN GOT DESPERATE. SO SHE TOOK THAT BOY and she laid him IN THE BED OF THAT PROPHET. OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I LOVE WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "AND THE WOMAN DONE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING THAT COULD BE DONE, THE MOST PROPER THING THAT COULD BE DONE IN THE FACE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LAY THAT LIFELESS body in a PLACE WHERE A PROPHET HAD LAID." HE SAID, "NOW WATCH THAT PROPHET IN DESPERATION." HE SAID THAT PROPHET SAID, "LAY MY STAFF UPON THE CHILD." He said, "But then all of A SUDDEN HE WENT IN THERE AND LAID HIS BODY ON TOP OF THAT DEAD BABY." AND HE BEGAN TO BREATHE INTO HIM. And he said, "THE BABY SNEEZED AND LIFE COME BACK IN THERE." HE SAID, "NOW WHAT HAPPENED?" HE SAID, "THE BABY COME TO LIFE." BECAUSE THAT DESPERATION, ARE YOU HEARING ME? THAT DESPERATION, [snorts] IT DROVE THE WOMAN TO THE PROPHET. AND THE DESPERATION DROVE THE PROPHET TO THE BABY. AND DESPERATION IN BOTH OF THEM DRAWED GOD ON THE SCENE WITH THE LOVE OF GOD. AND FOR his people, IT BROUGHT THE LOVE OF GOD DOWN AND THROWED FAITH OUT ON THE BATTLEFRONT AND THE WORK WAS DONE. COME ON, CHURCH. HOW MANY DAYS DID SHE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH CRITICS LAUGHING AT HER FOR BUILDING THAT LITTLE ELIJAH ROOM? HOW MANY DAYS DID PEOPLE SAY YOU WASTED YOUR TIME AND YOU'LL NEVER RECEIVE ANYTHING FOR IT? OH, BUT WHEN THAT BABY DIED, HALLELUJAH, WHEN THAT BABY DIED, THE ROOM SHE HAD MADE IN HER HOUSE FOR THE PROPHET OF GOD, IT BROUGHT THE FAITH OF GOD ON THE BATTLEFRONT IN THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE AND BROUGHT THAT DEAD BABY TO LIFE. OH, HEAR ME AND HEAR ME WELL. YOU WILL NEVER MAKE TOO MUCH ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE FOR A PROPHET'S MESSAGE. YOU WILL NEVER MAKE TOO MUCH ROOM FOR A PROPHET'S MESSAGE IN YOUR HOME. WHEN YOUR BABIES ARE SICK, LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LAY THEM IN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S BED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LAY THEM IN A PROPHET'S ARMS, BUT THERE'S AN INSPIRATION THERE. COME ON. I'M WRITING THE MESSAGE. HE SAID, "AND WHEN I'M MILES AWAY, THE SAME FAITH WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU." &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. WELL, BROTHER MATT, IF HE WAS A THOUSAND MILES, THAT'S ONE THING. BUT TONIGHT, HE'S IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. WELL, THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE NOT WORSHIPING WILLIAM BRANDON. WE'RE NOT A CULT. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF FANATICS. WE'RE CHRISTIANS. WE GOT A BIBLE FAITH AND A BIBLE GOD AND A BIBLE HOLY GHOST. WILLIAM BRANDON MAY NOT BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT THE FAITH HE BROUGHT IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. AND YOU CAN APPROPRIATE IT OVER ANY SITUATION IN YOUR FAMILY, IN YOUR BODY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOME SOME HOODOO OR SOME SOME SOME MAGIC WORD. I'M TALKING ABOUT A REALITY. &gt;&gt; This ain't a bunch of powder. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm sorry. I I DON'T I DON'T MEAN I TOLD YOU, brother Matt, it might get dangerous. &gt;&gt; He said I He said, "I've never heard you preach in your home church." I said, "That could be dangerous." I said, "When you're at home amongst home folks who love the message, you just preach." &gt;&gt; ARE ARE YOU HEARING ME? AMEN. I KNOW PEOPLE MADE THIS UH THEY THEY THEY'VE ALMOST MADE THINGS HYPOCRITICAL. AND I DON'T MEAN THAT NEGATIVE, BUT I THANK GOD FOR EVERY ARTIFACT OF BROTHER BRANDHAMS. I THANK GOD FOR EVERY PRAYER CLOTH. I THANK GOD FOR EVERY HAT HE WORE, EVERY SHIRT HE HUNTED IN, EVER SUIT WORE. I THANK GOD FOR THAT. AND IF I HAD THE PRIVILEGE, AMEN, TO LAY MY HANDS ON THAT, I WOULD BE VERY THANKFUL. BUT CHURCH OF LIVING GOD, THIS IS NOT A HISTORICAL MESSAGE. WHEN YOU START SITTING THERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO COME IN A NATURAL PHYSICAL FORM BEFORE GOD CAN MOVE, YOU ARE PARALYZING YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, GOD HAS PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE PLACE. HOW MANY BELIEVERS HAVE I GOT HERE TONIGHT? AMEN. COME ON. GOD HAS PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE BELIEVER. CAN I TELL YOU WHERE THAT'S AT? IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WE'RE NOT UNDER SOME MAN-MADE MOVEMENT, FOLKS. [laughter] CAN I PREACH? WE'RE NOT UNDER SOME SOME SOME PERSONALITY AS SOME MAN. AMEN. I just want TO DROP THIS IN HERE. GRACE TABERNACLE IS ONE BODY &gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE ONE PASTOR AND HIS NAME IS MATT MORSE. THERE'S NOT LITTLE GROUPS AND LITTLE FOLLOWINGS AND WE'RE BEHIND THIS GUY. OH, THAT'S A BUNCH OF NONSENSE. THERE IS ONE CHURCH. THERE IS ONE BODY AND WE GOT ONE FAITH AND WE GOT ONE VISION AND THAT IS THE POWER OF GOD TO COME INTO THE CHURCH AND MANIFEST HIMSELF UPON THE REALITY OF HIS WORD. Come on. I don't care. [laughter] Oh God, I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY OR WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS OR WHAT KIND OF I DON'T CARE ABOUT. AMEN. WE GOT ONE PASTOR. WE GOT ONE BODY. I'M JUST PREACHING. WE GOT ONE VISION AND WE GOT ONE GOAL AND WE GOT ONE ACHIEVEMENT AND THAT'S THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE UNDER ONE PLACE AND THAT'S THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT ANY KIND OF BLOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET CALLED IT? HE CALLED IT AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD. GLORY TO GOD. HE CALLED IT AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD. THAT MEANS THE WORSHIPPER THAT COMES BEFORE GOD WITH THIS APPROPRIATE BLOOD APPROPRIATE IT. GLORY TO GOD. WHEN YOU GET UNDER THE APPROPRIATED BLOOD, THERE IS A POWER OF APPROPRIATION THAT COMES UPON YOUR LIFE BY THAT BLOOD. NOW, I GOT TO SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "GOD CHOSE BLOOD for salvation." &gt;&gt; Now, DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET A CANE IN THE MIDST, &gt;&gt; replace the blood and put ethics in there. &gt;&gt; REPLACE THE BLOOD AND PUT BUSINESS IN THERE. REPLACE THE BLOOD AND PUT EDUCATION IN THERE. LISTEN, THIS IS NOT A CAIN CHURCH. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE PREACHER THAT'LL PREACH THE FIRE OUT OF THAT DEVIL UNTIL HE TAKES HIS HANDS OFF OF EVERY PERSON HE'S TRYING TO HOLD. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in works. I DON'T BELIEVE IN HOW GOOD YOU ARE, HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE, HOW IMPORTANT YOU ARE. I CARE ABOUT ONE THING, THAT IS THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THAT CAN WASH AWAY THE SIN. I DON'T CARE HOW VILE YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW BROKE YOU ARE. LET ME SHOUT TONIGHT, THERE IS A BLOOD AND IT'S AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; AND IF A BELIEVER EVER GETS UNDER THAT APPROPRIATE BLOOD, IT'LL RELEASE THEM FROM EVERY SPIRIT. IT'LL RELEASE THEM FROM EVERY FEAR. IT'LL RELEASE THEM FROM THE FEAR OF THE FUTURE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOMORROW HOLD. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT TOMORROW HOLDS. IF THE BLOOD IS HOLDING YOUR FUTURE, YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF IT. BECAUSE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD &gt;&gt; AND IT WORKS NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. &gt;&gt; Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission &gt;&gt; of sins. &gt;&gt; And let ME PUT THAT DEVIL WHAT'S THE TEENAGERS call on blast. LET ME PUT THAT DEVIL ON NOTICE TONIGHT. This is not a blood that was spilled. [panting] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID, "YOU SPILL SOMETHING, YOU DONE IT BY ACCIDENT." &gt;&gt; He said, "THIS BLOOD WAS SHED, &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS IT WAS SHED ON PURPOSE, WHICH MEANS THERE'S A PURPOSE BEHIND IT." OH, IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I WOULD TRY TO REPLACE THE BLOOD, TOO. WHAT CAN WASH AWAY MY SIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN BRING ME OUT OF THE DARKEST TRIALS OF MY LIFE? [screaming] NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. [applause] &gt;&gt; OH, brother B stood there. He said, I'm sorry. He said, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holies by the blood of Jesus." [laughter] Brother said, "I stood there the other DAY WHERE PAUL WAS IN THAT old chamber. They cut his head off. He said he pissed over there in the sewer." Now watch this. BROTHER, BROTHER BROTHER BOBBY, THEY CUT PAUL'S HEAD OFF. THE MAN THAT WROTE Hebrews 9, brother David, the man that went and got the revelation of THE POWER AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE BLOOD. BROTHER SAID, "OH, THEY CUT HIS HEAD OFF AND PITCHED IT OVER IN a sewer, BUT THEY NEVER WASHED OUT THE POWER OF GOD." COME ON, CHURCH. THERE WAS AN EVIDENCE A BELIEVER HAD BEEN IN THAT PRISON. AH, I FEEL GOOD TONIGHT. I FEEL LIKE PREACHING FOR A SECOND. I WANT EVERY TRIAL I GO THROUGH. I WANT THE I WANT TO LEAVE AN EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A BELIEVER IN THIS TRIAL AND I WANT TO LEAVE AN EVIDENCE THERE WAS A BELIEVER THAT CAME OUT OF IT. AMEN. I DON'T JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH THERE AND COME OUT SMELLING LIKE ROSES. I WANT TO LEAVE SOME EVIDENCE THERE THAT A SON OF GOD WENT THROUGH THIS TROUBLE, WENT THROUGH THIS PROBLEM, WENT THROUGH THIS SICKNESS, BUT IT DIDN'T DEFEAT HIM. HE OVERCAME IT BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF HIS TESTIMONY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A CHURCH FAITH. I'M TALKING ABOUT A LIVING FAITH. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He said, "What happened?" He I got to skip over some of this. He said, "What did he do?" HE SAID, "HE FOLLOWED THOSE BLOODY FOOTPRINTS AND HE recognized that the blood of Jesus Christ, are y'all ready for this? is the only appropriate way for sinners to reach God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS RECONCILED TO GOD THROUGH FAITH. AND GOD GAVE HIM THE HOLY GHOST, BAPTIZED AT THE RIVER DAMASCUS, WENT DOWN TO ARABIA for three years, and then come back. [panting] [sighs and gasps] Brother Brian, PREACHING THE FAITH &gt;&gt; THAT HE ONCE LOCKED UP. &gt;&gt; OH, GOD. FOLKS, I'm getting free right now. &gt;&gt; HE LOCKED UP THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS. BUT WHEN HE GOT UNDERNEATH THE BLOOD, &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. Y'ALL REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN NOBODY WOULD LISTEN TO YOU. WHEN THEY KNEW YOUR MISTAKES AND THEY KNEW YOUR HABITS AND THEY KNEW YOUR BLUNDERS AND THEY KNEW YOUR FAILURES AND THEY DIDN'T CARE TO SEE YOU, LET ALONE HEAR YOU. [laughter] I could get real open here, BUT I WON'T. AMEN. BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE LISTENING TO HIM. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING AS POWERFUL AS THE PREACHING OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THROUGH THE FAITH OF GOD. I TELL YOU WHAT, THE PREACH OF THE BLOOD WITH THE FAITH OF GOD WILL UNLOCK YOUR [laughter and gasps] IT'LL UNLOCK YOUR FAMILY. IT'LL UNLOCK YOUR HOME. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BLOOD. NOW, NOW, CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU, BROTHER JOE? I'M SORRY. I'M A LITTLE EXCITED, but this is a moving blood. WHEN I GET TO THINKING ABOUT THE POWER THAT'S BEHIND THIS BLOOD SAID I STOOD THERE THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID THAT LITTLE THAT LITTLE COLORED MAN SLAVE WAS STANDING THERE AND HE WAS ALL TORE UP AND SCREAMING AND BESIDE HIMSELF AND THEY ASKED HIM THEY SAID BROTHER BRANDHAM he said SIR HE SAID WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY HE SAID BROTHER I WANT YOU TO LOOK ON MY back he said do you see the slave marks on MY BACK SAID I DO he said I WANT YOU TO LOOK ON THAT dress he said do you see THE BLOOD THAT'S ON THAT DRESS. He said, "I do." HE SAID, "THAT'S NOT THE BLOOD OF ANY MAN." HE SAID, "THAT'S THE BLOOD OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN." AND HE SAID, "THAT'S THE BLOOD THAT WAS SHED." COME on now, WAS WAS WAS POURED OUT UPON HIS WIFE'S GARMENT. AMEN. BECAUSE OF WHAT HE WAS STANDING FOR, HE SAID THE MAN GOT HAPPY AND HE SAID, "HOW COULD I KNOW THAT BLOOD SET ME FREE AND NOT GET EXCITED ABOUT IT?" BROTHER DAVID PAUL SAID, "OH, I THOUGHT, BROTHER, I RESPECT YOU AND I WANT TO SHOUT WITH YOU." HE SAID, "BUT LET ME TAKE IT A LITTLE HIGHER." OH, HE SAID, "LET ME TAKE IT A LITTLE HIGHER." HE SAID, "DO YOU SEE THE SLAVE MARKS OF SIN AND OF UNBELIEF AND OF THE DEVIL ON MY BACK?" HE SAID, "BUT 2,000 YEARS AGO, OUR LORD JESUS HUNG BETWEEN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, AND HE APPRECIATED A BLOOD THAT WOULD RELEASE THE VIOLENCE OF SINNER." COME ON. IS ANYBODY GOING TO RISE TO RAISE THEIR HANDS AND SHOUT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD IS THE BRIDE WHO IS UNDER THE APPROPRIATE BLOOD? IT'S AN APPROPRIATE BLOOD. AND NOW'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO WORSHIP GOD FOR THAT APPROPRIATE BLOOD. Come on. NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME. COME ON. RIGHT NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THE BLOOD." NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THE STRIPES THAT YOU BORE UP ON YOUR BACK. &gt;&gt; Then I could be healed." [laughter] I'm talking about a believer who's not just contending, &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE POSSESSING. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE POSSESSING THE REALITIES OF GOD. NOW, &gt;&gt; get out of here, devil. I love what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said that blood will tear down every denominational wall. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT BLOOD WILL MAKE US ALL one &gt;&gt; and it'll MAKE US ALL LOVE each other. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about the blood of a church &gt;&gt; or the blood of a bull. &gt;&gt; Talking about the blood of God. Now, I want I want can I move a step further? There's another meaning to that word appropriate. &gt;&gt; It's a verb which means there's an action. &gt;&gt; I'm doing good, ain't I? Okay. It mean I trying to embarrass myself with my education. It means to take possession of what already belongs to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE APPROPRIATING, you're not getting it or buying it. You're taking possession. &gt;&gt; It already BELONGS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS. BROTHER SAID, "WATCH." HE SAID, "IT'S THE FAITH OF GOD." NOW, LOOK AT THIS HERE. THAT APPROPRIATE, IT IS ACTUALLY A SUBJECTIVE FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT MAKES GOD'S PROMISES. ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? IT MAKES GOD'S PROMISES PERSONALLY &gt;&gt; OPERATIVE TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; You know what you do when you appropriate faith? You are receiving what God has provided. &gt;&gt; Can I Can I give you a little something for 2026? &gt;&gt; Will you take it? &gt;&gt; Receiving, walking, applying, living. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RECEIVING WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY PROVIDED, WALKING IN THE PROMISES, APPLYING THE WORD PERSONALLY, AND LIVING BY THE FAITH DAILY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEN THERE IS A PEOPLE THAT HAS NOT DENIED [screaming] MY NAME. &gt;&gt; COME ON. THEY HAVE HELD FAST TO MY NAME AND HAVE NOT DENIED MY SALVATION. NOTICE IN ACTS 3 AND:E 16 HE SAID THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE MIGHTY MIRACLE. HE SAID AND HIS JESUS NAME through faith IN HIS JESUS NAME HATH MADE THIS MAN a formal strong yay THE FAITH WHICH IS BY FROM HIM JESUS HATH GIVEN HIM THE MAN THE PERFECT SOUNDNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF YOU ALL. See there it is. Jesus name and Jesus faith AND IT BROUGHT ABOUT A MIRACLE. PETER DID NOT CLAIM IT WAS HIS OWN HUMAN FAITH ANYMORE THAN HE CLAIMED IT WAS HIS OWN NAME. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THAT JESUS NAME USED IN THE FAITH WHICH WAS FROM JESUS PERFORMED THAT GREAT WORK. THE FAITH, THIS FAITH IS WHAT the Lord WAS SPEAKING ABOUT, WHAT HE WAS REPORTING, WHAT HE WAS DELIVERING, WHAT HE WAS VERBALLY GIVING IN REVELATION 21:13. IT WAS HIS FAITH. IT WAS NOT FAITH IN HIM, BUT IT WAS HIS OWN FAITH THAT HE HAD GIVEN TO THE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, NOW, can you take this? In this age of rapid degradation, there were still the few who had the measure of our fa of that faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, I love what he says here. That was a living faith. He says, "I live by the faith of the SON OF GOD." PAUL DID NOT SAY HE LIVED BY faith in the son of God. It was the faith, hope I'm not driving this too far, OF THE SON OF GOD THAT HAD GIVEN HIM LIFE. and kept him living IN CHRISTIAN VICTORY. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE WAS NOT JUST VISITING IT ON SUNDAYS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT JUST VISITING IT WHEN HE WENT TO CHURCH OR WENT TO YOUTH CAMP OR NO, HE WAS LIVING IN CHRISTIAN VICTORY. A PROPHET STOOD THERE AND SAID, I SAY THIS UPON THE AUTHORITY OF GOD'S WORD, THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE FAITH OF GOD THAT HE LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE FAITH OF GOD THAT HE LEFT FOR HIS CHURCH BECAUSE HE SAID, [laughter] BECAUSE HE REPORTED, BECAUSE HE DELIVERED THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE. YOU SAY, "HOW MUCH CAN I HAVE?" BROTHER ANDREW, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ALLOW THE HOLY GHOST TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE, WHAT YOU WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU CAN APPROPRIATE THE FAITH, I DO NOT KNOW. BUT WHAT GOD SAYS IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; OH, HE GAVE US THE STRONGEST WEAPON THERE IS, FOLKS. AMEN. I'M GOING I'M GOING TO DRIVE IT HOME. [panting] &gt;&gt; I got a little more time. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING BELONGS TO YOU AND I. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Some of them, &gt;&gt; A FEW OF THEM, &gt;&gt; EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING BELONGS TO YOU AND I. THE ONLY THING IS to appropriate THE FAITH TO RECEIVE IT. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM GOES TO ISAIAH 53 AND SAID, "HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSION. HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF OUR PIECES UPON HIM AND WITH HIS STRIPES we were healed. &gt;&gt; BROTHER JOE, IT'S ALL PAST TENSE. &gt;&gt; COME ON RIGHT NOW. SOME OF Y'ALL ARE LETTING THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF THE GOOD SERVICE. YOU'RE LETTING THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF PRAISING GOD. YOU'RE LETTING THE DEVIL HOLD YOU DOWN WITH SOME OLD PROBLEM OR SOME OLD SITUATION. CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID? HE SAID, "IT'S A FINISHED WORK. IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU GOT TO LOOK TO CALVARY WHERE THE SUPREME SACRIFICE WAS MADE AND THERE WE DRAW THE REMINATIONS FROM HIS DEATH BY OUR FAITH IN HIS FINISHED WORK. WELL, BROTHER ANDREW, I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. THERE'S NOTHING SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO. BUT IT'S WHAT GOD HAS DONE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE HE HAS DONE. THEREFORE, we take it. WE TAKE IT FROM THE WORD AND BASE OUR FAITH UPON THE FINISHED WORK. Can I SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID IS THE MAIN THING IS NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? IT'S WHO you believe. &gt;&gt; AND TONIGHT HE SAYS, I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD. HE SAID, THEN THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS TEACH IT. IT'S ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED. NOW IT'S UP TO YOU AND I TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH IN OURSELVES TO ACCEPT WHAT CHRIST HAS DONE. NOW, NOW LOOK HERE IN ROMANS 8:32, PAUL SAYS IT BEAUTIFUL. HE SAYS, "HE THAT SPARED NOT HIS OWN SON, ARE ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? BUT DELIVERED, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; BUT DELIVERED HIM UP FOR SOME OF US, &gt;&gt; FOR A FEW OF US, FOR US ALL. HOW SHALL HE NOT WITH HIM ALSO FREELY GIVE US ALL THINGS? &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to punch that devil square in the face and you can sit there and watch me. &gt;&gt; AS SORROWFUL YET ALWAYS REJOICING. &gt;&gt; AS POOR YET MAKING MANY RICH. &gt;&gt; AS HAVING NOTHING. I'm not trying to be mean, but that THAT'S THE WAY SOME OF Y'ALL sit in church. &gt;&gt; It's as if you have nothing. &gt;&gt; And you sit THERE AND LOOK AT SOMEBODY THAT SHOUTED AND YOU SAY, "WELL, THEY'RE just worked up." And if they were going through the same things, &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE LEARNED TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; COME ON. PAUL SAID, "YOU'RE SORROWFUL, BUT YOU'RE REJOICING. YOU'RE POOR YET MAKING MANY RICH. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SAY, "PREACHER, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? I'M A POOR MAN." BUT GOD HAS TAKEN THIS PIECE OF TENNESSEE DIRT AND SENT ME AROUND THE WORLD AND I MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE RICH. &gt;&gt; I know some devil like TO GET A HOLD OF THAT AND TWIST IT. WELL, BEFORE YOU DO, LET me finish. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE NO MONEY TO GIVE THEM. I DON'T HAVE NO PERSONALITY TO OFFER HIM, BUT I COME REPRESENTING MY FATHER WHO OWNS THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HEELS. I'VE STOOD IN AFRICA AND PREACHED THIS FAITH AND WATCHED POOR PEOPLE RECEIVE IT. COME ON. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, IF IT WORKS IN AFRICA, IF IT WORKS IN CANADA, IF IT WORKS IN EUROPE, IT'LL WORK RIGHT HERE IN BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS. I DON'T CARE HOW SORROWFUL YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE HOW PITIFUL YOU ARE. IF YOU CAN LET THE HOLY GHOST COME BY AND SHAKE YOU TONIGHT AND RECOGNIZE YOU ARE POOR, YOU ARE MADE RICH, YOU HAVE NOTHING, BUT YOU POSSESS ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; Even the flies enjoying it. &gt;&gt; It'll never work for you &gt;&gt; until you appropriate it. &gt;&gt; Come on. [gasps] I'm running out of time, but I got to say this. &gt;&gt; A little boy, Brother Wesley, was on a ship, and there was a great big important man called the captain of that ship, and he was up there dying. And brother Joel, he said, "Is there any little gospel preachers?" Sorry, &gt;&gt; I'm having fun. &gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYBODY ON THIS SHIP THAT'S GOT A BIBLE? The little boy rose up in the back and said, "Good evening, friends." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Good evening, friends. And he walked up there AND HE SAID, "I GOT A BIBLE." HE SAID, "WELL, READ ME SOMETHING OUT OF IT." HE SAID, "NOW, LET ME READ YOU ISAIAH 53. He was wounded for my transgression. &gt;&gt; He was BRUISED FOR MY INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM AND BY HIS STRIPES I AM HEALED. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CAPTAIN SAID? HE SAID, "THAT'S GOOD." LITTLE BOY SAID, "BUT WAIT A SECOND, [laughter] MAMA. THAT'S ME." HE SAID, "LET ME READ IT TO YOU THE WAY MY MAMA TAUGHT ME." HE SAID, "MY NAME'S WILLIE PUIT." AND HERE'S THE WAY MAMA TAUGHT ME TO READ IT. HE SAID, "HE WAS WOUNDED FOR WILLIE PUIT'S TRANSGRESSION. He was bruised FOR WILLIE PUIT'S INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF WILLY'S WILL PUIT'S PEACE WAS UPON HIM AND BY HIS STRIPES, WILLIE PUIT IS HEALED. NOW, COME ON. AS LONG AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF, HE WAS APPROPRIATING IT UNTO HIMSELF, THAT OLD CAPTAIN MUST HAVE FELT SOMETHING. He must HAVE FELT SOMETHING CUZ BROTHER MARK, HE SAID, "WONDER IF YOU COULD READ MY name in there." HE SAID, "I BET YOU I COULD. I WONDER IF YOU COULD READ MY NAME IN THERE." HE SAID, "SIR, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?" HE SAID, "IT'S JOHN QUARTZ." HE SAID, "WELL, HERE WE GO. HE WAS WOUNDED FOR JOHN COURT'S INIQUITY. HE WAS BRUISED FOR JOHN COURT'S CHASTISEMENT. THE CHASTISEMENT OF JOHN'S COURT'S PEACE WAS UPON HIM. AND BY HIS STRIPES, JOHN QUARTZ IS HEALED." RE SAID THAT CAPTAIN THAT WAS ON HIS DEATHBED, HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND HE SAID, "SOMEBODY GO GET MY BOOTS. I'M GOING TO LIVE." &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; HE GOT UP OUT OF THAT CRIPPLED CONDITION. CHURCH, THE LIVING GOD, ANDREW GLOVER HAS NOTHING. BUT I'VE GIVE MY LIFE TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE. AND WHEREVER I GET A PULL PIT, I'M GOING TO STAND THERE AND I'M GOING TO SAY HE WAS WOUNDED FOR CHARLES INIQUITY. HE WAS BRUISED FOR MATT'S CHASTISEMENT. COME ON. AND BY HIS STRIPES AND BY HIS STRIPES, MATT IS HEALED. AND BOBBY IS HEALED. AND COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME TO QUIT CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH. IT'S TIME TO APPROPRIATE THE FAITH. YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU LOST YOUR MIND." NO, I HAVEN'T. Any promise belongs to you. &gt;&gt; If you have the faith to appropriate it, &gt;&gt; contending for the faith is corporate. Everybody does it. Appropriating the faith is personal. Contending for the faith is defensive. Appropriating the faith is exper experimental. Contending for the faith is doctrinal. Appropriating the faith is practical. Contending for the faith protects the word. Appropriating the faith produces the results. Contending for the faith keeps the error out. Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Appropriating the faith brings the power in. You can contend without appropriating. &gt;&gt; And you know what you'll do? You'll become correct but powerless. &gt;&gt; You can appropriate without contending. You'll become experimental but unstable. But the bride of Christ will contend &gt;&gt; and she will appropriate because she's not just a hearer of the word. &gt;&gt; She's a doer. Can I can I close on this right here? &gt;&gt; Contending. I looked up I I I just wanted to find a simple illustration to break it down for you in contending and appropriate. I found this. It's just simple. Contending is guarding the deed to the property. Appropriating is moving in and living there. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; A deed unused still leaves you homeless. &gt;&gt; But the promises of God are movein ready. &gt;&gt; EVERY PROMISE IN THE BOOK IS MINE. EVERY CHAPTER, EVERY VERSE, EVERY LINE. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN. WON'T YOU BUY A HOUSE AND WON'T YOU FIX IT UP? I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE TIME." AMEN. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MOVE IN AND TER I'M NOT HOME MUCH. NEED SOMETHING MOVE IN READY. &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT HERE. THERE'S A RAPTURE COMING. WE DON'T HAVE TIME. AMEN. TO FIX ALL THE PROMISES. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE FIXED. CAN I CAN I CLOSE BY SAYING THIS? THE PROMISES OF GOD ARE MOVE IN READY. WHEN YOU GOT THE DEED TO THE HOUSE, YOU SIGN IT, YOU CLOSE ON IT, THEY GIVE YOU THE KEYS, AND YOU LET EVERYBODY KNOW, I'M MOVING IN. I'M MOVING IN. WELL, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I THINK 2026 IS A GOOD YEAR TO MOVE IN TO EVERY DIVINE PROMISE. MOVE INTO THE PROMISE OF JOY. MOVE INTO THE PROMISE OF PEACE. MOVE INTO THE PROMISE OF HEALTH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME TO MOVE, IT'S TIME TO MOVE NOW. NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACTION." &gt;&gt; When you see the word and God working together, that's the time &gt;&gt; to move in with it. The move is on for the bride. &gt;&gt; When people's faith get up to a place, they'll see the they'll get the blessing. to realize it's theirs. Then the same operation of the Holy Spirit will be operating in the church like it did back there that our musicians come tonight. You say back there? What about in Mexico when that mother with that dead baby and the ushers couldn't keep her down, &gt;&gt; crawling through their legs and jumping over their shoulders and pushing them out of the way. Brother Bram said, "Just take brother Moore down there and pray for the baby." He said, "Then all of a sudden, a vision broke." I I I'm sorry, folks. I study Brother Bram too much. He said, "A vision broke." And he said, "Now look," he said, "that little baby laying there and I saw a little baby crying." He said, "I went down there, pray, they brought that baby there. I prayed for it." He said, "Now, Brother Espinosa," he said, "you go find me a verified record that that baby perished and died." He said the he said brother Espinosa went and got it found the woman found the doctor the baby had perished and died and the baby is well tonight. He said that's by the faith that was once delivered of the saints operating in a Catholic woman that did. &gt;&gt; He said the next day the press asked me did I think their saints could do the same thing. I said well if they were saints and a living they can. He said, "But see, it's a sanctified vessel that's set apart for God's service &gt;&gt; that God dwells in. &gt;&gt; It's not Catholic saints. It's Christian saints." What about that little boy up there in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with that hunchback and he come up to Brother Brandham and he said, "Brother Brandom," he said, "I believe in divine healing from a statue. You pray to some dead person." Brother said, "Well, I believe in it." He said, "But I'm going to teach you a little different." He said, "I'm going to teach you the way the Bible teaches divine healing." Watch it. Watch it. Watch the spirit inspired preaching deliver the faith to a little boy and totally transform his view of divine healing. Abraham stood there and preached him the promises of divine healing. He said, "I believe it comes from God." He Now, now y'all want to know what what a prophet said divine healing is. He said it's God's eternal spoken word by born again people by prayer asking God [music] and God's obligated to his word. He said that little boy couldn't comprehend all of it but he said he believed it. He said all of a sudden that little boy come up there and he said here brother Brandham look raised up his little arms and that little hunch in his back was gone. &gt;&gt; Brother said what was it the faith that was once delivered of the saints operating in a child. Now folks, blind woman come up for prayer. He said, "I pray for you." She said, "Do you believe?" She said, "I do." When praying for her, eyes come open on the platform. She walked off the platform. What was it? The faith that was once delivered to the saints operating in a blind woman. You say, "Preacher, what are you getting at?" I'm saying this man, woman, child, preacher, deacon, trustee, Sunday school teacher, lay member, the faith that was once delivered to the saints is operating in this building tonight. God has sent down his faith, his power, and faith is power. &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight here on the on the brink of a new year, I wonder how many could say this with me. Lord, renew our faith. See, see, faith has a long range vision. Faith ain't looking at what is right now, but it's looking at what will be. Reb said, "Look, faith works in the realm of the spirit and God." I want to I want I want to I want to leave you with this and take this into the new year. Faith is the power. Will you remember this? Faith is the power to power out of the darkest hour. Faith is the power to power out of the darkest hour. Won't you stand to your feet with us tonight? God wants to send the Holy Ghost. God wants to bless his children. Reverend M said, "Oh," he said, "Here it is." He said, "The pillar of fire is here. He said, "Now, he's here to change." I I want to say something to you tonight, and I I want to I want to I want you to catch it, okay? You got to learn to appropriate faith in your situation. Is that Is that okay? See, people say, "Well, you preachers get up there and preach like you never have any troubles and you never have any struggles. You never have any problems." No, it's because you got to learn to appropriate the faith you're contending for. See, there there's been times any preacher that preaches the gospel contends for the faith on a on a regular basis. But there's times you got to appropriate it in your life, &gt;&gt; in your situation. And see, when you begin to appropriate that faith, that's where the power comes from. &gt;&gt; See, it don't come from because of who you are or what kind of ministry you have or who you No, it comes from the ability to say, "Lord, this is your word. I've got the deed. I've got the I've got the deed to to strength. I'm going to move into strength. I've got the deed to joy. I'm going to move into joy. See, brother Ram stands there and he says this. With all the faith that I have that's in you, Lord, that you have given me, I give to them. And as your pastor, your brother, with what faith I have, I've asked God to place it on you. This is this is my prayer for every believer in this building for the new year. I've asked God to place it on you. And I believe that I'll receive what I've asked. Now, if you will believe it with me, with what faith I have, I give to you for this hour. And now, in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, renounce your affliction. Renounce your sickness and say to it, you have to go cuz you have your faith plus my faith with the power of Jesus Christ whose omnipresence is here to vindicate it and prove that he is here and he will make you well at this time. &gt;&gt; Such as I have give I unto thee. I wonder tonight how many can testify that in 2025 the faith of God is what brought you through. &gt;&gt; Appropriating the faith of God will take you through 2026. &gt;&gt; If there's a 27, it'll take you through that year. I don't know. I've been I've been preaching, watching that service since I was 14, 15 years old. And I don't think there's been one go by that I haven't stood on a platform and said these words. Now, if the Lord would have come down at the end of last year and showed you everything he's going to go through, Brother Wesley and showed you this day and this day and this week and a little break here and you go through this, a little break there, you go through and he showed you the whole year of 2025. Would you be standing here tonight? Be a nervous wreck. But when you put your faith in him, &gt;&gt; it don't matter what the year holds. &gt;&gt; You're walking in the faith of God. And everything you go through, you're coming out of it. &gt;&gt; Listen, I believe tonight the power of God is right here in this building. You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts together. Heavenly Father, Lord, these are your children. This is your word. Lord, we're not here to say anything, Lord, that would just make us feel good or just excite us, but Lord, we're here to preach your promises, to preach the uncarchable riches of Jesus Christ. Lord, you've given us untapped resources. Now, Father, I believe right here tonight, the faith of God is living. I don't believe it's dead. I don't believe it's in a tomb, but Lord, I believe by the preach of the gospel, by the blood of Jesus Christ, that appropriate blood that's been appropriated to every life and to every heart. Lord, I believe the faith of God is alive and well in these believers. And Lord, I pray for them this this evening, Lord, as we're coming to the close of an old year. And Lord, we're facing a new year. Father, we don't know what next year holds. We don't know what tomorrow holds, what a month from now holds. But Lord, there's one thing we can testify that Lord, we know who holds the next year. Lord, we know who holds the next second. We know who holds the next hour. Now, Father, I pray the power of the Holy Ghost right now would settle over every heart, every life. Lord, if there be one that's been contending and they've not been appropriating, Lord, may this be the night of transformation, Lord. Father, may the preach of the gospel, may the preaching of the blood of Jesus Christ. May the may the revelation that's been made known in our hour has moved us from nothing to everything. Lord, has taken us as and made us the possessors of all things. Now, Father, I pray that faith would rest in every heart. Lord, your word is true here tonight. And Lord, I pray you give every one of my brothers and sisters strength in this new year. Father, may they may this be the year they move into every promise. For Lord, the promises are moving ready. There's nothing to be done. They don't have to be repainted. They don't have to be reframed. They don't have to be restructured. The promises of God are ready. They're ready for the believers to move into them and to begin to live them, to begin to enjoy them. Father, if there be one here tonight that's never moved in the divine promises of God, may this be the night, may this be the hour that they move into it. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. We thank you for your mercy and your grace, Lord. We commit this old year into your hands. And Father, we open in just a few hours a brand new year, a new chapter. If you give us time and breath to live into it, Lord, we thank you for it. Lord, go before us in Jesus name we pray. Oh, believe. Will you help me sing that, Brother David? &gt;&gt; Believe all things are possible. only. &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have here tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. I believe. I'm a believer. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; God bless you friends. We say God bless you. Happy new year. May the blessings of God rest upon you this year. heard brother Bram today I was just sitting there in my office studying and I heard brother Bramie come in the pull pit and they were just I believe they were singing only believe and he stopped in in a watch night service and he said now that's appropriate to sing at this hour facing this new year the old year behind us the appropriate song for a believer to sing is only believe &gt;&gt; amen how many can say Lord I thank you for this faith &gt;&gt; how many say Lord I want to be a contender &gt;&gt; but Lord I want to be an appropriator I want to appropriate [music] this faith in every situation. When I don't feel like going to church, I'm going to appropriate the faith. When the devil's using old lines, symptoms, and vanities, I'm going to appropriate the faith [music] cuz I'm not just a contender. I'm an appropriator. Amen. God bless you. We love you for the love of the Lord. Thank you for your attention tonight. And I pray something has been said to bless you and help you. Remember us in prayer. We'll be leaving in the morning headed over to Alabama there at brother David Templeton's for some New Year's services there and meetings and then over in Georgia and then Lord willing we'll be back home. So you members in prayer, [music] God bless you. Turn around, shake somebody's hand and say it's time to move in. The promises of God are move in ready. The blessings of God are ready for somebody to move into them and occupy them. Joy is ready to be occupied. [music] Brother Joe, peace is ready to be occupied. The promise of life is ready to be occupied, &gt;&gt; folks. I believe the promise of prodals coming home is ready to be occupied. &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe the rapture promise right now is ready to be occupied. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to move into it and somebody's going to live in it. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Only believe. Only [music] [singing] believe. Only believe. All [singing and music] things are possible. Only. Can you sing it like this tonight? Lord I believe. Oh Lord I believe. Lord I [music and singing] believe. All things [singing] are possible. Lord I believe. Lord [music] I believe. Lord, I [music] all things are possible. Lord, I Amen. How many enjoyed that message tonight? Not just to contend for faith, but to appropriate the faith. You know, Brother Angie was preaching that I've had that conversation with my kids a few times when we go on vacations. They have all the the plans what they're going to buy and where they're going to go and do. And I had to give them a lesson. Well, you can't appropriate funds that you don't have. &gt;&gt; You know, see, I can appropriate what we're going to spend on food and what we're going to spend on toys and because I'm the one with the with the funs. I'm the dad. See, so you can't appropriate funds that you don't have. He got to preaching that. But when he read that quote, brother said, "There was no limit to the faith of God." I thought, "Isn't that something to the believer?" So you don't have to worry about what you're appropriating it for because there's no limit to the faith of God. Isn't that wonderful? As long as you can believe it there. I know the world tries to limit faith, but said they try to limit it by creeds. the denominations try to limit your faith saying this is for an apostle or that was just for a disciple or that was just for this one. But when Peter preached that message and and he and he said that this promise of the Holy Ghost was unto you and your children and them that are a far off as many as the Lord our God shall call. And brother said as long as God's still calling then there's still there's still faith to be had. It ain't it's an unlimited faith. I thought isn't that wonder? He says, "As long as God's still calling, then faith is ready for those that'll receive it." &gt;&gt; So if you're ready to receive it, then there's there's faith there that's ready. Amen. Because God is still calling. &gt;&gt; How many knows that that the Lord's calling? He he's still working. He's still dealing with hearts. And my here we are at the end of a year. Just a a tremendous a tremendous time that we've had. You know, I always take these times and reflect back on on where we come from and what God has brought us through. And here he's established a church here [music] in in Black Rockck, Arkansas, and and so many people from uh from all over different states, Virginia, and Ohio, and some from Tennessee, and some from Missouri, and just that that God draws us together to a place of worship. Amen. And it's not not just for the for the church, but it's the the the just the fellowship around the word of God and this this message that brother Andrew he he said we we we study [music] it too much but I don't believe you could study it too much and he knows you can't either. Amen. We just we we love it and we you know I'm going to ask you this. If we don't, who will? You know, one day, I mean, you can look, you look 20 years down the road, who's going to stand for this kind of faith? Who's if nobody's preaching it, nobody's believing it, nobody's and nobody's living it, then where would it where would it be? So, I thank God for those that are that are taking a stand. And you know, uh, I I believe that God is so unmindful of us and he he's he's blessed our church so much, gave us wonderful ministers that have preached the gospel. And and I want to say, God bless you to these men uh that take a stand upon this word. And and take the take the hits from people and the criticism that they take for, you know, saying everything you say is under a microscope, especially nowadays. Everything's public and you know, you can't just hide behind a a pull pit and say, "I didn't say it or I didn't mean it. You said it and you meant it." And uh and and it's public for everybody to see. And they take criticism and and all of this, but I say, "God bless you to the to the the ministers that stand upon the word of God." And I I I brother Andrew had mentioned something about it. Paul said this. He said, "How?" He said, "How shall they preach except they be sent as it is written? How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things." Amen. And I believe that I I I appreciate these men that stand. Maybe if we could, and this may be an odd thing, but I'd like our ministers uh to come forward tonight and maybe just come to stand uh in the front of the pull pit if y'all would come. And maybe brother Andrew I'd like to come back and I just want the the church and maybe at this you know a time we don't really have an opportunity very often but but if you have a you know just to maybe come by and and shake their hand tell them you appreciate their stand and the uh the witness and and the labor uh to preach the gospel and to be uh to be ready whenever our number is called and amen. I've never been a part of a group of men that there was uh that there was less conflict. I mean there there there no nobody's fighting each other. Nobody's there's no competition of who preaches on Wednesday and who preaches on Sunday and [music] how long this one does and how long. We we don't have that here and we won't have that here. We we just love the Lord and we love the word and and we have real men that stand for the gospel and we have one cause and brother Andrew said it. He said, "We want to make the rapture." And that's our purpose. And these men, every one of them, I want to say while they're standing in front of you that I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank you for the [music] support and and for supporting our ministry here at the church. And and and these these brothers have put their shoulder to the wheel. And I couldn't express to them enough how much I appreciate them and the effort that they put forth. And and I I just want to maybe just take an opportunity tonight if if uh if if the church would like to to Y'all want they're all gonna hate me later because these are some humble men that would never appreciate this and but I want you they always do [music] stuff for me and but brother Andrew was preaching that and I it just came on my heart. I want y'all to come by and and maybe just shake their hand and if you have something [music] you'd like to say thank you or something like that and and you can go ahead and take the opportunity [music] and uh we just we just appreciate these men of God. So, if you'd like to come, maybe just maybe just come on. I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. [music and singing] And all my days I've been held [music] in your hands. From the moment that I wake [music and singing] up till I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been sold. Every [singing and music] breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness [music and singing] of the good. I love [snorts] your voice. You have [singing and music] led me through the fire in the darkest like no other. &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. [singing] and I have lived in the goodness of God. So I say, all my [music] life you have been [singing] faithful. &gt;&gt; All my life you have [music] been so so good. With every [singing] breath that I am able, yes, I will sing of the goodness of God. [singing and music] I will sing of the goodness [music] of God. [singing] I love your voice. You have led me [music] through many [singing] fireers in the darkest night. You are close like no [singing] other. &gt;&gt; I've known you as a [music] father, known you as a friend. [singing] &gt;&gt; I have in the goodness of God. Oh, all my life you [singing] have been faithful. &gt;&gt; All my life [music and singing] you have been so so good. With every breath that I [singing] am [music] able, I will sing of the goodness [singing and music] of God. Yes, I will sing of the goodness of God. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise. Let the sons [singing and music] and daughters sing. Yes, I'm surrendering my all. Oh yes, my [singing] Lord, let the sons and daughters sing. [music] [singing] Yes, I'm surrendering my all. Oh my lord, I surrender to the king. Father, I see that you are drawing a line in the [singing] sand. [music] Come, let it live in [music and singing] me. This is my prayer. This is my plea that the worshippers arise to bring my own king in the worshipers. Let your son [music] [music] to the king louder as the seas of every [singing and music] nation are awakening to Sing from our hearts there comes an end. Hear the praises [singing] ring. This is our song. Song to the king of [music] the worshipers. Oh, let the sons and daughters [music and singing] sing. Yes, I'm [music and singing] surrendering my all. Oh my lord, I surrender to the king. Let [music] the worshippers arise. [singing] Let the sons and daughters sing. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm surrendering [singing] my all. I surrender to the [music] king. Brother, would you come? Praise the Lord. What a what a meal. There's nothing like the revealed word of God. More so the ears that we've been given to hear and the eyes to see. Amen. We're a blessed people that God has given us a place to hear the truth and men of God that preach the truth, that live for the truth, that stand for the truth. Because I see these men, not just in here, but out there, and I know they live the truth. Amen. We're blessed. for each and every one and for their wives that stand with them. Because when God called them, he called the wives with them and they stand for their husbands and they take flack just as well as they do because when they see people fighting against their husbands, it it's hurtful. So, we don't only lift up the men of God, but we lift up their wives and their families. Amen. We're blessed. I'm blessed. I can say that I'm blessed because God's given me this wonderful place to worship him in together with you. Amen. Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly father, Lord. Lord, you know our heart more than we even know our own, Lord. And you just open it up, Lord, and you just fill it with your word. Lord, you fed us tonight, Lord. All that we had need of, Lord. Lord, you came and you anointed our hearing that we could hear it, Lord, that we could appropriate the faith to obtain every promise that you've given to us, Lord. Lord, I pray that you strengthen Brother Andrew, Lord. Lord, strengthen his dear wife, Lord, and all these ministers that are present and their wives, Lord. I I pray, oh Lord, that you would strengthen them, Lord, Father, and our pastor, Lord, and his dear wife, Lord, God, that you would strengthen them for 2026, Lord. Lord, you brought us through 25, Lord, because you knew there was something great for us in 26, Lord. And we're here to appropriate that, Lord. Father God, we're going to go from this place, Lord, and go from each other's presence, Lord. But God, that you keep us bound together by love's strong cord. Lord God, that we always think of one another always, Lord. Father, I ask you these things, Lord. Lord God, you've done so much in this place, Lord. Lord, let us not take it for granted, Lord God, but Lord, that we exalt you in all things, Lord. Lord, and thank God, Lord, for brother Matt being here, Lord Jesus and his family, Lord, to be in fellowship with us, Lord. You know all things, Lord, and you know all of our needs, Lord. Father, and I ask you, Lord God, that we apply every bit of this word to our heart, Lord. Lord, I'm asking you, Lord, and I'm so thankful for these precious people, Lord. Lord, you've blessed me with them, Lord. such a precious people that love you, Lord, and they love your word. I ask you, Lord, that you would, Lord, bless them beyond the boundaries of their wants or needs. Lord, I ask you these things, Lord, in your precious and most beautiful name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
