Because we're living in the age of revealed truth. And our revival, it don't [music] come from a song. It don't come from a uh from music. It comes from a revelation of the word of God. And Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." You know what that shows us? It shows us that the gates of hell will be against it, but it shall not prevail. That's why a prophet of God would say, "You cannot stop this revival."

It was just scrap to them. And he said they come along and somebody picked it up. And he said now they begin to bid on it. And when they started bidding they said who'll give me I think five cents and 10 cents. And [music] he said but then somebody went over and picked it up that knew how to play it. And he said they started strumming it and tuning it up and rosed up the bow. And he said now he said then they auctioned it again and they said who'll give me a thousand and 2,000.

I just slept there in the back for a few moments as they were singing today. And brother Matt was standing there in the back in front of me and I just couldn't help but think to see the grace of God, what the Lord has used the gift of God in his life to establish here and build. And I'm honored to be a part of it and to put my shoulder to the wheel and and then to see the cause of Christ go forward. And this morning before we open the word of the Lord, it's such a such a warm atmosphere. Let's just speak to our Lord this morning. We've only got one service today. We're not in a hurry. We've come here to worship the Lord and to hear his word and to enjoy his presence. Let's just ask him to come and speak to us this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers have gathered here on this beautiful Sunday morning that you've given us, Father, Lord, we're so thankful that you woke us up this morning with a mind to serve you, dear God. Lord, with a heart, Lord, of thanksgiving for the things that you've done, the graces that you've given unto our lives. Father, we don't want to be like those lepers this morning that come into your presence. And Lord, you touched them, Father, and you cleansed them and you cured them of their leprosy. And Lord, they went right back into their life and took off from you. But there was only one out of the 10, Lord, that returned. Father, let us be like that one this morning, oh God, that Lord, you've done so much for us. You've brought us such a mighty long way. And Lord, you brought us through situations that when we looked at it, Father, Lord, we were assured that this was our end. But oh God, you're rich in mercy. And Lord, you brought us through another situation, another trial, another circumstance. And for that this morning, dear God, we are grateful, Lord. Father, as we endeavor to look in your word this morning, I pray, Lord, that you would send the spirit of wisdom and revelation into the building, Father. Lord, may you bind the hand of Satan, dear God. May you may you loose the anointing that destroys the yoke of the enemy, Father. Lord, I pray if there be any sick among us this morning, I pray as your word goes forth, may healing take place in their bodies, oh God. Lord, if there be any bound this morning as your word would be ministered, Lord, Father, may it bring a great deliverance into that heart. Father, Lord, I pray for those that be at home this morning unable to be here, Lord, that'll hear this sermon. I pray the angel of God will pass by their rooms, Father. Lord, if they're in the hospitals, dear God, you will raise them up off of the sick bed. For Lord, you are mighty and you are powerful and you're able to do all things. And this morning, we surrender our hearts and our minds into your hands, Lord. asking you forgive us of our failures, Lord. Father, may this be more than just another Sunday morning service. But Lord, may it be a transformation in your presence. And we'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. For it is due unto thy holy name. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." This morning, if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us today, we want to go to the book of St. John, the 15th chapter. the book of St. John the 15th chapter. Uh, sorry, St. John chapter 5. First, we're going to read St. John 5 and then St. John 15. Amen. You love the Lord. This morning, amen. St. John chapter 5 and verse number 37. St. John 15. And also we're going to read in 1 John 2. Amen. St. John 5 and verse 37. Jesus here speaking. He says, "And the Father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape." Now watch in verse 38. "And ye have not his word abiding in you. For whom he hath sent, him you believe not." Ye have not his word abiding in you. for whom he hath sent him ye believe not. I want to look in St. John 15 and verse number seven. I want to pick up that word again in St. John 15 and verse number seven. John there in John 5 uses the word abide. And St. John 15:7, if he abide in me and my words abide in you, now I find myself in this verse. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. &gt;&gt; Also in the book of 1 John chapter 2, 1 John chapter 2 and verse number 24, 1 John chapter 2 and verse 24. Again, here John is writing and he's speaking of abiding in Christ. And he says, 'Now let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. But the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you. And ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teach you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. And now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. We ask Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today. Amen. Uh from those scriptures this morning if I would if I would take a title here today. I want to speak to you on this. Confidence in his appearing not ashamed at his coming. Amen. confidence in his appearing, not ashamed that his coming. And I just want to for a few moments here to revisit a few quotes I spoke to you here recently on when I was speaking to you on spiritual confidence. In the sermon there, he that's in you 1963, he says, "What I'm trying to say is don't never lose your confidence. Don't let Satan tell you evil about me because there's much. But you keep that confidence because if you don't, then it won't happen. Don't look to me as a man. I am a man. I am full of mistakes. Amen. But look to what I'm saying about him. It's him. He is the one. Again, in the spirit of truth. I'm an old man now and can call the world to a standstill and ask him to put your finger on one thing that he ever told me in thus sayaith the Lord in the name of the Lord. But what was absolutely the truth and fact and come to pass out of the thousands times thousands of things. What I'm saying that for amen see is because I've put us all as volcanic dust. But it's the promise of God's word. Therefore I cannot have confidence in myself. You cannot have confidence in yourself. But together we can have confidence in what has taken over ourselves. The Holy Spirit has taken us over. then we must have confidence in that. And as we place our confidence in that, Amen. then the results come. So here, amen, we're placing our confidence in something. WE'RE NOT JUST THROWING IT out there. AMEN. BUT WE'RE PLACING IT IN SOMETHING. AND TO PLACE SOMETHING, it means to put it in a particular spot. It means to put importance on. It means to arrange, to position. Amen. to set carefully and deliberately in its proper location or order. Now, I can say this morning, AMEN, IF YOU HAVE FAITH and you HAVE CONFIDENCE, AMEN, AND brother Brandham said, I think it's come to a TIME THAT WE'VE GOT TO know how we stand. Amen. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. It's not that we've just made a stand. Amen. But we GOT TO KNOW HOW WE STAND. AMEN. AMEN. IT'S ONE THING TO STAND. AMEN. BUT IT'S ANOTHER thing to know how YOU STAND. AMEN. BECAUSE EVERY DEVIL IN HELL IS TRYING HIS BEST, AMEN, TO BACK YOU OFF OF YOUR STAND. AMEN. BUT IF YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY BY THE WORD OF GOD, AMEN, THEN THERE'S NO DEVIL BIG ENOUGH, AMEN, TO BACK YOU OFF OF YOUR STAND. HE SAID, HOW can you do anything UNLESS YOU GOT FAITH IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING? AMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH. HE SAID, "AND THAT'S MY purpose of doing this here for the church is to give the believers, Amen, faith and confidence in what they're standing for, amen, because it is the word of the Lord." I want to go on record and say EVERYTHING THAT THIS CHURCH STANDS FOR, AMEN, is the word of the Lord. WE STAND FOR NOTHING, AMEN, OUTSIDE OF THE word of God. We do not stand for MAN'S INTERPRETATION. WE DO NOT STAND FOR DENOMINATIONAL OPINIONS. AMEN. We do not stand for man-made ideas. Amen. We stand for the word of God. Then as long as through the scripture IT HAS BEEN SOVEREIGNLY PLACED FROM GENESIS into Revelation. Amen. Back and forth up and down. Amen. There's not a way for the devil to move in there anywhere. Amen. Then you have got perfect confidence. Amen. I wonder how many can testify YOU BELIEVE WE'RE FOLLOWING A perfect message. Amen. AMEN. WE ARE FOLLOWING A PERFECT MESSAGE. THEN IF WE'RE FOLLOWING, AMEN. a perfect message. AMEN. WE OUGHT TO HAVE PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN THE PERFECT MESSAGE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING. I LOVE HOW BROTHER BIBLE WOULD SAY THERE. AMEN. PAUL WOULD SAY, "NEITHER give place to the devil." Amen. I'll say it to you like this. The scripture, Amen, it speaks of the appearing of Christ. How many knows that? Amen. It speaks of the appearing of Christ. Amen. And it speaks of the coming of Christ. Now, if you want scripture for this, at 2 Timothy 1:9, it says, "WHO HAS SAVED US, AMEN, AND CALLED US WITH A HOLY CALLING, AMEN, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was GIVEN US IN CHRIST JESUS, AMEN, BEFORE the world began." Amen. in verse 10, BUT IS NOW MADE manifest by the appearing, AMEN, OF OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, WHO HATH ABOLISHED DEATH, AND HATH BROUGHT LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT THROUGH THE GOSPEL. AMEN. NOW, YOU TELL ME ONE OTHER MESSAGE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE THAT TELLS YOU, AMEN, THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING IN YOU FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. THERE'S NO OTHER MESSAGE THAT COULD TELL YOU, AMEN, THAT YOU WAS A PART OF THE SONS OF GOD THAT WERE SHOUTING FOR JOY. AMEN. WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS of the world was laid, AMEN, BUT THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TIME MESSAGE. AMEN. BUT IT'S AN ETERNAL MESSAGE. IT IS NOT introducing you to your identity and time. It is introducing you to YOUR IDENTITY IN ETERNITY. LISTEN, YOU ARE NOT JUST IDENTIFIED, AMEN, AS TIME BEINGS AND CREATURES OF TIME, BUT THIS MESSAGE COME, AMEN, to awaken you to THE REVELATION THAT YOUR NAME WAS on the LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, AMEN, FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. And when you begin to hear this message, it begin to quicken that seed on the inside of your heart. And it begin to produce a revival in you. Amen. And the light OF THE GOSPEL BEGIN TO COME TO LIFE. NOW, AMEN. AMEN. IN 2 TIMOTHY 4:8, AMEN. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness. Amen. Which the Lord the righteous judge, Amen, shall give meth that day, and not to ME ONLY, BUT UNTO ALL THEM ALSO that love his appearing. Amen. In Titus 2:13, looking for that blessed hope. Amen. And the righteous appearing, the glorious appearing rather. Amen. Of the great God and our savior Jesus Christ. Amen. who gave himself for us that he might redeem us, amen, from all iniquity and purify unto himself. Amen. A peculiar people, amen, a zealous people of good works. Amen. Now, when you look there at that word appearing in the Greek, it is the New Testament advent of Christ. NOT ONLY THAT which has already taken place, Amen. and by WHICH HIS PRESENCE AND HIS power appear IN THE SAVING LIGHT HE has shed upon mankind. BUT IT IS ALSO THAT ILLUSTRIOUS RETURN, AMEN, from heaven to earth, amen, to occur in the future. Amen. Now, I WANT TO SAY THIS. IT TAKES A word prophet, folks. AMEN. AND A PROPHET IS NOT JUST SOMEBODY, AMEN, THAT SPEAKS of future events. AMEN. BUT A PROPHET IS A DIVINE revealer of the word. SO IT TOOK A PROPHET, AMEN, TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE IN HIS APPEARING, AMEN, and in his coming. He said, now there's A GREAT BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SIGN OF JESUS APPEARING and then Jesus coming. He said there's two different things. The appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord. He said, now the appearing of the Lord is now. Amen. SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR his appearing this morning. Amen. We are looking AT HIS APPEARING. AMEN. WE ARE looking for his coming. He is appearing in his people. His spirit working among them. Amen. Proving that it's him with them. Amen. Getting them ready for the rapture, for the coming of the Lord. Amen. To catch away his bride. See, the appearing AND THE COMING. NOW, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS. THE APPEARING IS THE PREPARING. AMEN. HIS APPEARING IS HIS PREPARING. AMEN. BUT HIS COMING IS THE TAKING AWAY OF what he has prepared. AMEN. BY HIS APPEARING. WELL, IF I WAS THE DEVIL, I WOULD HATE THIS MESSAGE, TOO. AMEN. BECAUSE IT'S NOT GETTING YOU READY FOR TRIBULATION. IT'S NOT GETTING YOU READY FOR ANOTHER CHURCH AGE. BUT THIS MESSAGE IS PREPARING YOU FOR THE CHANGING OF YOUR BODIES, FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD, FOR THE GOING HOME OF THE CHURCH. LISTEN, this is more than just a sermon. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A PROPHET. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A PREACHER. THIS IS THE PROPHESIED, AMEN, FULFILLMENT OF THE APPEARING OF OUR Lord in the hour that we're living in. My. And I CAN TELL YOU THIS MORNING. AMEN. His appearing is invisible. AMEN. BUT HIS COMING is visible. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T SEE THE LORD HERE THIS MORNING." AMEN. BECAUSE HE DID NOT PROPHESY. AMEN. TO BE HERE IN the form of human flesh today. Amen. In a corporal body, rather. He is here IN HUMAN FLESH. BUT HE IS NOT HERE IN NAILS SCARRED HANDS AND A CORPORAL BODY. PROPHET OF GOD SAID NOW IS THE APPEARING. AMEN. AMEN. THE COMING will soon be. He is appearing in the midst of us and he is doing the works that he once did where in his church. Now I want you TO WATCH A PROPHETIC ANNOUNCEMENT. HE SAID NOW MY MINISTRY is different from a pastor. AMEN. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM A TEACHER. AMEN. IF I SAY THINGS WRONG, BRETHREN, FORGIVE ME. I don't mean to. Amen. But this is my ministry. YOU SAY, "WHAT MINISTRY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?" I'M TALKING ABOUT MALACHI THE 4TH CHAPTER that said, "I the Lord WILL SEND ELIJAH THE PROPHET unto you before the coming of THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD." I'M TALKING ABOUT REVELATIONS 3 AND 14 where there would be a seventh angel to a SEVENTH AGE. I'M TALKING ABOUT REVELATIONS 10 WHERE THERE WOULD BE A VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A PREACHER. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A REFORMER. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A THEOLOGIAN. I'M TALKING ABOUT A WORD PROPHET WHO CAME WITH THE WORD TO POSITION YOU AND GIVE YOU A PLACE, AMEN, TO STAND AGAINST THE WS OF THE DEVIL. HE SAID, "THIS is my ministry." AMEN. TO DECLARE HIM, he is here. AMEN. NOW, WATCHING THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND RECOGNIZED right over here in Topeka, Kansas. He said, "Now what Jesus was, Amen, is what HIS PRESENCE IS NOW." AMEN. SO, if you're looking for Jesus, Amen. what he was IN A CORPORAL BODY. LISTEN, HIS PRESENCE IS NOW. LISTEN, it's the Hallelujah. IT'S THE SAME JESUS IN A DIFFERENT FORM. LISTEN, he's no lesser Jesus today BECAUSE HE'S HERE IN PRESENCE FORM THAN IF HE WAS HERE IN CORPORAL. LISTEN, Y'ALL REMEMBER JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN THE power of God COME THROUGH HERE SO STRONG. AMEN. Brother Ben couldn't even hardly sing. AND SOME OF YOU HAD YOUR HANDS UP AND WAS WORSHIPING. YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER ANDREW." AMEN. THAT WAS A GLORIOUS MOMENT. DO YOU REALIZE THAT'S no different? WHAT YOU FELT THAT HAD JESUS WALKED HERE in this BUILDING IN A CORPORAL BODY. AMEN. HE'S NO LESSER GOD IN JESUS. HE IS THE SAME GOD IN JESUS THAT HE WAS BECAUSE HE'S GOD AND HIS WORD IS TRUE. AH. AMEN. I can tell you this morning, he's not a million miles away. His corporal body is not here. Amen. BUT HIS PRESENCE IS RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING. AMEN. TO BLESS you and to heal you. Amen. To deliver you. Amen. TO ENCOURAGE YOU. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A DEAD RELIGION. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A DAY GONE BY. I'M TALKING ABOUT AN OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE WHERE THE SAME DYNAMICS OF GOD THAT FILL THE UPPER ROOM BEGINS TO FILL THE SOULS of believers AND REVIVAL AND LIFE BEGINS TO COME. YES, SIR. I'm talking about his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. His presence is here. Amen. And it's among the church this morning. Amen. I'm falling apart up here and I even got started. He said, "Did you ever stop to think THIS MORNING?" AMEN. AS FAR as returning that IS TO BECOME VISIBLE, he is already here with us now. Amen. He is already here with us now. NOW TODAY JUST IMAGINE THAT HIS PRESENCE BEING HERE TODAY. HE SAYS NOW THE LORD JESUS IS IN another world or another dimension right here today in form of spirit. His spirit is blending in with our spirit. Now our EYES CANNOT SEE HIM BECAUSE THEY'RE YET PHYSICAL UNLESS THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT WE COULD SEE A VISION. HE SAID BUT HE IS HERE NOW Y'ALL WITH ME THIS MORNING. HE IS HERE JUST AS VISIBLE AND JUST AS REAL as what he was. Amen. The day he spoke to Mary at the grave or THE DAY HE MET CLEOPIUS ON HIS ROAD to Emmas. HIS PRESENCE IS HERE. It can be FILLED WITH THAT. AMEN. YOU CAN FEEL THAT INNER CHARGE THAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF THE HUMAN BODY. IT'S CALLED the new birth. AMEN. THE SOUL HAS BEEN MAGNETIZED UNTO HIM. AND ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN YOU LET YOUR MIND BECOME CONCENTRATED ON HIM, YOU'RE believing on him, THEN AFTER A WHILE SOMETHING, AMEN, A REALITY, YOU CAN FEEL SOMETHING SWEEP OVER YOUR BEING. AMEN. THAT'S the vindication of his resurrection. IT'S NOT A GUESS. IT'S NOT A HOPE. BUT TO EVERY PERSON THAT'S BORN AGAIN, IT'S A NO. AMEN. You know it. IT'S RIGHT THERE. I WONDER HOW MANY CAN TESTIFY THIS MORNING. I KNOW BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT MY GOD IS NOT IN A GRAVE IN JERUSALEM. He is not IN A TOMB IN JEFFERSONVILLE. HE IS NOT BURIED IN THE MOUNTAINS of Arizona, but he is right here IN THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION THIS MORNING. YES, SIR. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT HAS PROPHESIED OF THE APPEARING OF THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BEFORE the coming of Jesus Christ. Amen. He said if he shall return again in our midst. Amen. To prove himself. Amen. Besides the preach of the word that he's here. Amen. Convincing sinners that he's here. He's here to HEAL THE SICK AND WOULD REVEAL the cause as he did when he was here on earth. Then will you gladly accept your healing? He said, "Now if he will do SO AND WILL IDENTIFY HIMSELF, YOU SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH HIM THEN." AMEN. WHEN HE HAS COME among the church AND HE HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THIS IS NOT THE ELABUB. THIS IS NOT A FORTUNE TELLER. THIS IS NOT A MAN GETTING SECRETS ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES AND then trying to patch it UP AND CALL IT DISCERNMENT. BUT THIS IS THE RETURN, AMEN, OF THE MESSIAH SIGN. THIS IS THE RETURN OF ELOHIM. THIS IS THE RETURN OF MELZDC. LISTEN, WHEN YOU SEE IT AND YOU SEE IT PROVEN BY THE BIBLE, YOU SEE THE SCRIPTURES TESTIFYING, THAT AIN'T THE TIME TO BACK UP. THAT'S THE TIME TO SAY, "I STAND. I STAND WITH THE RETURN OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE GENERATION I'M LIVING IN." I'M NOT ASHAMED to say, "This is God." &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. Amen. And I tell you this morning, when a person when they lose their spiritual confidence, Amen. The first thing they do is they become ashamed. Amen. When they lose their confidence IN WHAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING AND WHAT THEY'RE BELIEVING, THE FIRST THING THEY DO, brother David, IS THEY BECOME ASHAMED of it. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what David said in Psalms 119:6? He said, "Then shall I not BE ASHAMED WHEN I have respect unto all thy commandments." I LOVE IN ISAIAH 50 AND:E7, "FOR THE LORD GOD WILL HELP ME. THEREFORE SHALL I NOT BE CONFOUNDED. THEREFORE HAVE I SET MY FACE, AMEN, LIKE A FLINT." I love this. AND I KNOW THAT I SHALL not be ashamed. Listen, THERE'S NO GUESSING THIS MORNING. AMEN. THERE'S NO HOPING THIS MORNING. THERE IS AN AUTHORITY IN THE FLESH OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WHEN HE SHALL APPEAR, I KNOW I SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED. AMEN. We're living in an age, Amen. When identification is required. Y'ALL, Y'ALL KNOW THAT. AMEN. It's an identified age. It's an age WHERE IDENTIFICATION. NOW, I WANT Y'ALL TO NOTICE THIS. AMEN. Identification identifies, Amen. where you come from. Amen. It don't necessarily identify where you're going. AMEN. BUT IT IDENTIFIES WHERE YOU COME FROM. OH MY. AMEN. Y'ALL KNOW THIS MORNING, AMEN. IF YOU GO DOWN HERE TO THE AIRPORT, AMEN, and you get on a plane and you fly UP TO CANADA, AMEN, THE FIRST THING THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU FOR, AMEN, IS YOUR PASSPORT because they want to know where YOU COME FROM. AMEN. They want to know what kind of identification you got. Amen. Now, IF YOU GOT A FAKE PASSPORT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE A NERVOUS WRECK. AMEN. AMEN. IF YOU BOUGHT ONE OFF OF SOME GUY DOWN THERE IN THE CORNER SELLING THEM, AMEN. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A NERVOUS WRECK. BUT IF YOU WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND YOU GOT A LEGITIMATE PASSPORT, YOU GOT A STAMP ON IT. THE US GOVERNMENT BACKS IT UP. YOU WALK UP THERE WITH CONFIDENCE KNOWING YOU CAN GO IN AND KNOWING YOU CAN COME OUT. AMEN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING, AMEN. GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD PLACED A SEED IN YOUR SOUL AND HE GAVE YOU A WORD IDENTIFICATION AND HE KNEW YOU COULD GO INTO LEONA AND YOU COULD COME OUT OF LEONA. YOU WOULD NOT GIVE UP YOUR IDENTIFICATION. YOU WOULD NOT BECOME ASHAMED OF YOUR HERITAGE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's an age OF IDENTITY CRISIS. AMEN. THERE IS A PRESSURE TODAY IN THE WORLD. AMEN. TO BECOME ASHAMED OF WHO YOU ARE. AMEN. TO BECOME ASHAMED OF YOUR IDENTITY. LET ME JUST SAY THIS. MEN ARE BECOMING ASHAMED TO BE MEN. AMEN. THAT'S WHY THEIR WIVES ARE leaving the house. And well, glory to God. Amen. And women ARE BECOMING ASHAMED TO BE WOMEN. AMEN. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS MORNING, AMEN, IF WE WOULD GET BACK TO THE BIBLE, IT WOULD BRING A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, BETWEEN A FATHER AND A MOTHER. Between the parents and the child. Oh well, glory to God. See, I REMEMBER WHEN THE PARENTS led the house and not the children. &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN MOM AND DADDY MADE THE DECISIONS WITHOUT asking the babies, "Are we going to go to church? Should we? &gt;&gt; Well, glory. Is that okay? AMEN. I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MEN COME TO CHURCH AND LOOK LIKE men and women come to CHURCH AND LOOK LIKE WOMEN. AMEN. BUT BECAUSE OF THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN, IT'S AN IDENTITY CRISIS. SO THERE'S A PRESSURE ON A MAN, AMEN, TO BECOME A MAN. IT'S LIKE I HEARD SOMETHING STUPID. SORRY, I shouldn't say that. HEARD SOMETHING SILLY THE OTHER DAY. AMEN. THEY HAD THIS THIS THIS women's movement and they said every man that come in this BUSINESS OUGHT TO WALK IN WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND APOLOGIZING TO EVERY woman that he's a man. I THOUGHT NOW HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO GO WITH THIS NONSENSE. A YOU SEE IT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. BUT DON'T YOU FORGET WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NATURAL. AMEN. IS ALSO HAPPENING IN THE SPIRITUAL. AMEN. THAT'S WHY JESUS COME IN MARK THE 8TH CHAPTER and he said whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous AND SINFUL GENERATION OF HIM SHALL the son of man BE ASHAMED WHEN HE COMETH IN THE GLORY OF HIS FATHER. AMEN. WITH THE HOLY ANGELS. NOW THE PROPHET OF GOD COME IN 1965 and preaches a beautiful SERMON AND HE CALLS IT ONE WORD ASHAMED. HE SAID, "NOW THE WORD ASHAMED COULD BE ALSO TRANSLATED AS EMBARRASSED." He said, "NOW YOU'RE FACED WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE EMBARRASSED ABOUT." SORRY. AMEN. BEING ASHAMED. HE SAID, "NOW ANOTHER THING ASHAMED DOES, it shows that you are not SURE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT." IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN TELL ANYBODY THAT AND YOU'RE not ashamed. AMEN. IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU STAND AND YOU CAN PROVE IT BY THE BIBLE, THEN THERE'S NO INTELLECTUAL DEVIL. THERE'S NO ATHEISTIC DEVIL, THERE'S NO AGNOSTIC DEVIL, THERE'S NO LEODYSIAN DEVIL THAT CAN INTIMIDATE YOU, AMEN, TO BACK OFF OF WHERE YOU STAND ON THE WORD OF GOD. YES, SIR. IF YOU FEEL PUT OUT, AMEN, OUT OF PLACE, IT SHOWS YOU'RE NOT SURE. AMEN. I'LL TELL YOU THIS MORNING. AMEN. THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS NOT UNSURE of what she believes. As a matter of fact, THE BIBLE SAYS, "NEVERTHELESS, I AM NOT ASHAMED, FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED." AMEN. I'LL SAY THIS MORNING AS BELIEVERS, we're going to face demon spirits. AND THOSE DEMON SPIRITS ARE GOING TO TRY TO DISPOSITION YOU. AMEN. AS THE OVERCOMERS OF THIS HOUR. BUT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU STAND BEFORE THEM." AMEN. I'll say it to YOU LIKE THIS. AMEN. ASHAMED OF HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE PROPHET OF GOD WILL SHOW YOU THERE. HE'LL SHOW YOU HOW THAT JESUS AND THE WORD ARE THE SAME. AND I'LL SAY IT LIKE THIS. TO BE ASHAMED OF ONE is to be ashamed of the other. NOW, IN ST. JOHN 1, THE BIBLE SAYS, "IN the beginning was the word." Right? And the word WAS WITH GOD, AND THE word was God. Now, if you skip on down to the 14th verse, it says, "And the word was made flesh AND DWELT AMONG US." AMEN. NOW THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGED BETWEEN THE FIRST THREE VERSES AND THE 14TH verse was the spirit TOOK ON FORM IN THE FLESH OF A MAN CALLED JESUS. LISTEN, HE WAS NO LESSER THE WORD WHEN HE COME IN THE FLESH THAN HE WAS IN GENESIS 1. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I REFUSE TO BECOME A DENOMINATIONAL LAYOUT OF SIN THAT SAYS I BELIEVE IN JESUS BUT I AM ASHAMED OF HIS WORD. LISTEN, I BELIEVE IN HIS WORD. I BELIEVE IN HIS SPIRIT. I BELIEVE IN HIS ANOINTING. I BELIEVE IN HIS PRESENCE. I BELIEVE IN HIS PROPHET. I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST. LISTEN, I AM NOT ASHAMED. I KNOW IN WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say THIS MORNING THAT WHEN A MESSENGER brings a message, the message and the messenger ARE ONE. &gt;&gt; NOT ASHAMED TO SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID WHEN HE SAID A DENOMINATIONAL MAN UNDER A DENOMINATIONAL OPOSIS BY IN the church. Amen. He and the church is one. Now, I looked up the word opospice. It's really powerful. AMEN. IT MEANS GUIDANCE. SO, A MAN WHO'S UNDER THE BAPTIST GUIDANCE IS GOING TO TEACH THINGS THE way the Baptist teaches it. No offense TO THE BAPTIST, GOD BLESS HIM. AMEN. A MAN UNDER A PENTECOSTAL GUIDANCE IS GOING TO TEACH THINGS THE WAY THE PENTECOSTAL LEADERS HAVE TAUGHT HIM TO TEACH IT. BUT ACCORDING TO 1 JOHN 2, IN THE LAST DAYS, THE ANOINTING OF GOD WOULD RETURN TO THE CHURCH, AND IT WOULD NO LONGER BE A MAN TEACHING. IT WOULD BE THE ANOINTING HAVING BEEN VEILED BEHIND THE FLESH OF A MAN. AND IT WOULD BE THE ANOINTING TEACHING THE CHURCH. THAT'S SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, WE DON'T NEED A PROPHET." CUZ RIGHT THERE, THE BIBLE SAID, "WE DON'T NEED NO MAN TEACH US." OH, COME ON, CHURCH. HE WAS SAYING WE DON'T NEED MAN'S INTERPRETATION. WHAT WE NEED IS the spirit's revelation &gt;&gt; of the word or we'll fail to get it. Now, amen. I want to go on and say what the prophet says. He says, "Then when a man comes where thus sayaith the Lord, he and the message is one." Amen. So the word of God AND THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE WAS THE SELFSAME THING ALL THE TIME in spiritual food in due season. He said Jesus was THE WORD THAT WAS PROPHESIED OF. HE WAS THE PROPHET. I LOVE THIS BROTHER BRIAN. HE WAS WHAT THAT THE PROPHET SAID WOULD HAPPEN. SEE, ISAIAH SAID THAT A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. AMEN. WAY BACK IN THE BEGINNING, GOD TOLD THEM THAT THE WOMAN'S SEED WOULD bruise the serpent's head and he would bruise HER HEEL. NOW, ALL THESE PROPHECIES HAD BEEN GIVEN. AMEN. LISTEN, THESE PROPHECIES WERE NOT GIVEN on the morning JESUS WAS BORN. THESE PROPHECIES WERE GIVEN, BROTHER ROY, HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE WORD WAS FULFILLED. HE SAID DAVID CRYING ALL THE REST OF THE PROPHETS DOWN TO THE AGES SPEAKING OF HIM. LISTEN, he was that WORD MANIFESTED. AMEN. IN THE BEGINNING was the word AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD AND THE WORD WAS GOD AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH OR THE WORD WAS MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; Oh church of the living God, I can tell YOU THIS MORNING, THIS BIBLE, AMEN, IS A PROPHETIC BOOK. I CAN TELL YOU IT'S A FULL OF PROPHETS. I CAN TELL YOU IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THEM OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETS STOOD THERE AND THEY SAID THE MESSIAH IS COMING. AMEN. THE MESSIAH IS COMING. BUT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, AMEN, THEY JOHN THE BAPTIST STOOD THERE AND HE SAID, "BEHOLD, THE LAMB OF GOD THAT IS COME." AMEN. DO YOU SEE THE CHANGE? IT WENT FROM MESSIAH IS COMING TO BEHOLD WHAT IS COMING IS NOW HERE. AND A PROPHET SAID, "I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE WITH ALL YOUR HEART THAT GOD IS IN THE BUILDING." AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING? AMEN. JOHN OR RATHER RATHER MOSES SAID, "MESSIAH IS COMING." AMEN. JOHN STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN AND SAID, "BEHOLD, THE LAMB OF GOD IS HERE." AND AFTER SEVEN church ages, WHEN THE SON OF GOD DISPENSATION WOULD RUN OUT, HE WOULD RAISE UP A PROPHET THAT WOULD STAND ON THE PLATFORM AND SAY, "I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I FEEL LIKE HE'S HERE. I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I SENSE HE'S SOMEWHERE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HE'S NOT THREE FEET FROM WHERE I'M STANDING. THE GOD OF THIS BIBLE IS RIGHT HERE AND HE'S HERE IN POWER. HE'S HERE IN AUTHORITY. HE'S HERE IN REALITY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. God is a spirit. Amen. It's getting COLD UP HERE. GOD IS A SPIRIT. AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM must worship him in spirit and in truth. He says, "Now, WHAT IS THE TRUTH?" AMEN. CHRIST THE WORD. The word is truth. THE SPIRIT IS THE HOLY Spirit and the word IS THE TRUTH. NOW, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT GETS A HOLD OF THE WORD OF PROMISE AND BRINGS IT TO PASS. SEE, IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORD IN YOU, THEN ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN unto you. Then it isn't you. &gt;&gt; COME ON. IT ISN'T YOU. IT'S THE WORD OF PROMISE THAT'S DOING IT. AMEN. I WANT TO SAY IT VERY PLAINLY THAT SATAN IS TRYING TO CRUCIFY &gt;&gt; THE VINDICATED word of promise. BROTHER RAM SAYS IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK, he says the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary. AMEN. BUT THAT WORD OF PROMISE WAS HE HIMSELF TO BE MADE MANIFEST. GOD WAS MADE MANIFEST. HE HIMSELF ACTED AT THE TIME AND FULFILLED HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE IN THE VIRGIN. LISTEN, IT WAS AN ANGEL THAT HAD BROUGHT HER THE MESSAGE, BUT THE ANGEL'S MESSAGE WAS THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. SO, THE ANGEL DID NOT BRING HER SOMETHING, AMEN, APART FROM THE WORD, BUT THE ANGEL BROUGHT HER THE WORD. He says, "AND GO AWAY JESUS." HE SAID, "THEN THE LIVING WORD OF PROMISE WAS MADE ALIVE AND WAS PROJECTED RIGHT THROUGH THAT BODY AND THEY KNOW THAT GOD WAS IN HIM." OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, WHEN YOU SAW JESUS, AMEN, WALKING THE SHORES OF GALILEE, WHEN YOU SAW JESUS, AMEN, WALKING THE STREETS OF CAPERNAUM, WHEN YOU SAW JESUS DOWN THERE IN NAZARETH, YOU WERE NOT LOOKING AT JUST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE PROPHECY BEING FULFILLED. &gt;&gt; OH, CAN I SAY IT THIS MORNING? AMEN. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE. AMEN. BECAUSE ALL THE WAY OVER IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS, THE IN CHAPTER, AMEN. PAUL REACHES BACK IN GENESIS AND BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT ABRAHAM [panting] AND HE BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT SARAH. AND HE SAYS IN ROMANS 9:9, "FOR THIS IS THE WORD OF PROMISE. AT WHAT? AT THIS TIME WILL I COME AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON. He said ABRAHAM SEED. NOW I DON'T care what come contrary to Abraham. HE STAYED RIGHT WITH THE WORD OF PROMISE. HE SAID DO YOU SEE THAT ABRAHAM SEED TODAY? AMEN. Stays with THE WORD OF PROMISE. AMEN. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PREACH IT ALL THIS MORNING. AMEN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. AMEN. YOU ARE A CHILD OF PROMISE. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT PAUL CALLED YOU. HE CALLED YOU A CHILD OF PROMISE. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. WHAT WAS ISAAC? HE WAS A PROMISED CHILD. AMEN. WHO WAS JESUS? HE WAS THE PROMISED CHILD. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "EVERY TIME A MESSAGE COMES, IT THROWS THE CHURCH INTO A HEAVIER BIRTH PAIN. AND SHE'S GOING TO BRING FORTH, AMEN, THE PROMISED WORD." I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR FIGHTING CLOTHES ON. IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR JOY SHOES ON. IT'S TIME TO LOOK THAT DEVIL IN THE FACE THIS MORNING AND SAY, "I DIDN'T PUT MYSELF HERE. I DIDN'T BUY MY POSITION." AMEN. BUT GOD, BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, POSITIONED ME IN THIS HOUR UNDER THIS ANOINTING AS A CHILD OF THIS PROMISE TO WATCH THE WORD OF PROMISE COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word, SIR. HE SAID THAT VOICE OF God that speaks to you. Oh my. Then from a little group of the truth see the word GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST A BELOVED VIRGIN, a virgin of his word. And through them and by them will and through them and through Joe AND THROUGH JOHN. COME ON CHURCH. AND THROUGH JONAH AND THROUGH LILLIAN AND THROUGH WESLEY. AMEN. AND THROUGH DAVID PAUL AND THROUGH THEM AND THROUGH ED. AND THROUGH THROUGH TAMMY, THROUGH THEM WILL THE WORD BE FULFILLED. HIS PROMISED WORD IN THE VIRGIN WHO KNOWS NO MAN-MADE CREEDS OR DOGMAS. OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT WAS IN MARY, HE WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE SO TO FULFILL ALL THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OF HIM AS HE DID WHEN HE COME FROM THE VIRGIN WOMB. Oh my. HE SAID THEY ARE HIS SUBJECTS. SEE THEY ARE SUBJECT TO HIS HEAD. SO WHEN A CHILD OF PROMISE COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THEIR HOUR, THE WORD OF PROMISE BECOMES THE HEADSHIP OVER THEIR LIFE. NO MANMADE INTERPRETATION NO LONGER HAS AUTHORITY OVER A CHILD OF PROMISE. AMEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE SAYS THE WORD OF PROMISE, IT CANNOT FAIL. AMEN. I LOVE WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "PEOPLE ACT FUNNY." HE SAID, "THEY SEEM TO JUST FORGET ABOUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND AN ABSOLUTE." OH, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I CAN TELL YOU THIS MORNING, WE ACT FUNNY TO THE WORLD. BROTHER JOHN, WE ACT LIKE CRAZY, FOLKS. BUT THE ONLY REASON WE DO IT IS BECAUSE WE FOUND AN ABSOLUTE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND OUR ABSOLUTE IS THE WORD OF GOD. LET ME SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "THEN THE WORD, YOU COME BACK TO THE WORD AGAIN, WHICH IS THE WORD OF PROMISE." NOW, WHAT IS THE WORD OF PROMISE TO EVERY CHRISTIAN? HOW MANY CHRISTIANS HAVE I GOT HERE TODAY? AMEN. YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN, THEN THERE'S A WORD OF PROMISE FROM THIS BIBLE TO YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. THEN HOW DO I OVERCOME NOT ME, BUT THE WORD THAT'S IN ME? THE WORD IS GOD. I'M GOING TO OVERCOME THE THINGS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD IN ME. LISTEN, just keep pressing. YOU'RE COMING TO THE TOP AS SURE AS ANYTHING. AMEN. YOU'VE GOT TO come to the top. AMEN. NOW LOOK HERE. WE'RE INSIDE OF CHRIST. HOW MANY'S INSIDE OF CHRIST? &gt;&gt; NOW, AS THEN ALL TRUE BELIEVERS, THEY SEE HIM. &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY SEE HIM? THEY SEE THE WORD OF PROMISE OF THIS DAY OPENLY MANIFESTED. THAT'S A BIG WORD IF YOU CAN GET IT. ALL TRUE BELIEVERS THAT'S IN THE WORD. THEY CAN SEE GOD OPENLY. THE VEIL IS RENT. LISTEN. AND GOD STANDS OPENLY BEFORE YOU. HE IS MANIFESTED. AMEN. SEE GOD MANIFESTED OPEN. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. IF ANYBODY OUGHT TO BE SHOUTING CARRYING THIS BIBLE THIS MORNING IS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WE HAVE SEEN GOD. WE HAVE SEEN HIM MANIFESTED AND WE HAVE SEEN HIM OPENLY DECLARE &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IN ORDER TO DO THIS NOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM? In order to is this okay? Are you enjoying the word? IN ORDER TO DO THIS OUR OLD DENOMINATIONAL TRADITIONAL VEIL MUST BE RENT AGAIN. SO, IT WAS RENT ONE TIME, BUT THEN SOMEBODY, BROTHER JARED, PUT A VEIL BACK OVER IT, BUT IT MUST BE RENT AGAIN IN ORDER TO REALLY SEE WHAT IT IS. YOU'VE GOT TO COME OUT FROM AMONG THAT STUFF. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME OUT FROM AMONG THAT STUFF. YOU'LL NEVER DO IT. THEY'LL KEEP PULLING THE VEIL BEFORE YOU EVERY TIME. EVERY TIME GOD MOVES, THEY'LL SAY, "OH, THERE IS NOTHING TO THAT." BUT HERE IT IS WRITTEN, AND HERE IT IS MADE MANIFEST. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY, "THANK GOD THIS MORNING WHEN THE HOLY GHOST, BROTHER DAVID, BEGINS TO WALK AMONG THIS CHURCH, WE GOT SOME LEADERS. WE GOT SOME WORSHIPPERS." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE GOT SOME BELIEVERS THAT DON'T SAY, "OH, THIS IS WRONG AND WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT." AMEN. I SAY, "THANK GOD THAT WHEN THE ANOINTING GETS TO MOVING, WE GOT A SONG LEADER THAT DON'T SHUT IT DOWN, BUT HE BEGINS TO FAN THE FLAMES." I SAY, "THANK GOD." OH, I KNOW. I KNOW SOMETIMES IT BE GET A LITTLE TORE UP BECAUSE MAYBE THE SERVICE GOES A LITTLE BIT LONGER. AMEN. BUT I SAY THANK GOD WE GOT A PASTOR LIKE MATT MORRIS THAT'LL STAND IN A FIELD UNDER A TENT AND HE'LL PUSH THAT NO PRAISING GOD BACK. THAT NO PRAISING GOD DEVIL BACK TO THE HELL THAT'LL CRAWL OUT OF AND IF HE GOT TO SING IT A HUND TIMES, HE'S GOING TO SAY, "I'M GOING TO THE MEETING." OH, I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, I'M NOT ASHAMED TO STAND AS A WORSHIPPER AND PUSH THAT DEVIL BACK IN THE PITS OF HELL WHERE HE CRAWLED OUT OF I THINK WE'VE GIVE THAT DEVIL TOO MUCH ROOM. I THINK WE GIVE THAT DEVIL TOO MUCH LEEWAY. I THINK IT'S TIME SOMEBODY IF YOU GOT TO LOOK LIKE A FOOL AND ACT LIKE A FOOL. BROTHER SAID MARY HAD TO ACT IDIOTIC LIKE THE REST OF THEM. HE SAID, "BUT SHE GOT THE HOLY GHOST." AND I THINK WE NEED SOME PEOPLE THAT'LL GET OUT OF FORM. IT'LL GET OUT OF FASHION. IT'LL GET OUT OF TRADITION UNLESS THE WORD BEGIN TO MOVE AGAIN WITHOUT MAN'S INTERPRETATION. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; OH, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know. Amen. I'm not an idiot. I know. Devils start pushing. &gt;&gt; They start pushing &gt;&gt; and pushing &gt;&gt; pushing. AND IF WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND, WELL, WE JUST PACK UP AND GO TO THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW WHERE I STAND. &gt;&gt; You ain't GOING TO YOU AIN'T GOING TO INTIMIDATE ME into being quiet in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; You ain't GOING TO KEEP ME QUIET. COME ON. &gt;&gt; SEE, I'm the kind THAT'LL STAND UP, BREAK THE ATMOSPHERE by myself. &gt;&gt; I've done it before. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about, Joe. &gt;&gt; Preaching some of these churches and it's 30 to go 30 degrees below zero. &gt;&gt; And you're ready for the power of God to fall and the pastors over there texting and flipping through notebooks and song &gt;&gt; cuz they don't want a move of God. They don't want you to have the move OF GOD. WELL, LET NEWS FLASH. YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY MOVE OF GOD AWAY FROM ME. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE IT. AMEN. I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY HOLLERING. I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY SHOUTING. I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T LIKE MY PREACHING. YOU WILL NEVER SHUT ME UP. I HAVE SEEN THE APPEARING OF THE LORD IN THE HOUR I'M LIVING IN. IF ANYBODY GOT A RIGHTEOUS SHOUT, I GOT A RIGHTEOUS SHOUT. IF ANYBODY GOT A RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SALVATION THAT GOD GAVE THEM IS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Remember said it's the Messiah. &gt;&gt; He's standing in THE PLATFORM &gt;&gt; TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF &gt;&gt; WITH THE WORD of promise &gt;&gt; for that age. &gt;&gt; Now said how now you all know brother preaches a beautiful sermon in 1965. You know what he calls it this day. This scripture &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Now, can I just read this to you? Is that okay? He takes it from Luke 4 and he says, "Now, how could those people ever fail to see who he was? How did they ever miss it? How could it be when it was so plainly made known and showed? How could they have ever missed seeing it?" Amen. What a word. Think of it. This day, this scripture is fulfilled before our eyes. WHO SAID IT? GOD HIMSELF. Who is the INTERPRETER OF HIS OWN WORD? &gt;&gt; The Messiah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Himself. &gt;&gt; STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE congregation and reading a word out of the Bible PERTAINING TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAYING, "TODAY, this scripture is fulfilled." AND THEY STILL FAILED TO SEE IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT A TRAGEDY THAT WOULD BE. BUT IT'S HAPPENED. IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? OF COURSE, LIKE IT DID IN OTHER TIMES. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? BY BELIEVING A MAN'S INTERPRETATION. &gt;&gt; NOW, COME ON, CHURCH. OF THE WORD. THAT'S WHAT CAUSED IT. NOW, THOSE BELIEVERS IN THEM DAYS, THOSE SO-CALLED BELIEVERS WAS TAKING THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE PRIEST HAD SAID ABOUT THE SCRIPTURE. THEREFORE, JESUS NOT BELONGING TO ANY of their RANKS OR SOCIETIES, HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED FROM THEIR COMPANY. NOW, LISTEN. AND THEREFORE, ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? THIS IS POWERFUL. THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY HIM WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THEM. THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST WAS SO UNIQUE THAT NO ONE SHOULD ADMIT SEEING THAT IT WAS THE SON OF GOD BECAUSE HE WAS THE PERFECT IDENTIFICATION OF THE SCRIPTURE THAT WAS WROTE OF HIM. AND TODAY IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE IN SUCH A TURMOIL AS WE ARE AND PEOPLE FAIL TO SEE THE TRUTH OF GOD IS BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MANY THERE IS TOO MANY MADE MANMADE INTERPRETATIONS OF GOD'S WORD. WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM, BROTHER TOM. THERE'S TOO MANY MAN-MADE INTERPRETATIONS OF GOD'S WORD. HE SAID GOD DON'T NEED NOBODY TO INTERPRET his word. He is his own. HE IS HIS OWN INTERPRETER. AND BROTHER BSON SAID, "BEAUTIFUL. TODAY WE HAVE BY GOD'S HELP THE PERFECT INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD WITH DIVINE VINDICATION." AND CAN I SAY TODAY, DO NOT ALLOW, AMEN, MAN'S INTERPRETATION AROUND THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, I ain't leaving this out there in the Baptist. I AIN'T LEAVING OUT THERE IN THE PENTECOSTALS. I'M GOING TO BRING IT RIGHT HERE. BROTHER DAVID, DON'T ALLOW MAN-MADE INTERPRETATIONS AROUND THIS MESSAGE TO VEIL WHAT HAS BEEN UNVEILED. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I THINK IT'S A SHAME THAT WE LET MEN GET BEHIND PULL PITS AND VEIL THE GLORY OF GOD IN THE CHURCH OF GOD BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO SAY WHAT HE SAID. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I'M GETTING TIRED, AMEN. OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS A SEVEN THUNDERS PREACHER. WE'LL PREACH WHAT THE PROPHET SAID ABOUT IT AND THEN WE'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. &gt;&gt; It's kind of like guys get tired of BEING LABELED RETURN. WE'LL PREACH AGAINST IT ONE TIME AND we know where you stand. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. LIKE SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, I GET TIRED OF BEING LABELED PERUSIA." WE'LL TAKE A SERMON AGAINST IT ONE TIME AND LET US KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. Somebody shout hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SEE, I REFUSE TO ALLOW REVELATION 10 THAT'S BEEN REVEALED TO BE UN TO BE VEILED. AGAIN, SAID IT'S THE MYSTERIES OF GOD MADE MANIFEST AND IT IS KNOWN AS THE SEVEN SEAL BOOK PROMISE. NOW, LET YOUR FAITH IN HIM WHO IS THE WORD. LISTEN, REVELATION 19, WHEN HE COMES, HE'S GOING TO BE CALLED THE WORD OF GOD. HE'S GOING TO BE RIDING UPON A WHITE HORSE AND THE FOLLOWERS OF HEAVEN WILL BE BEHIND HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, CAN I SAY WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "BREAK THE DENOMINATIONAL veil of education." &gt;&gt; WOO, BROTHER. AMEN. BREAK THE DENOMINATIONAL VEIL OF TRADITION. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETIME OR ANOTHER, WE GOT TO BREAK IT. AMEN. TRADITION IS OKAY AT GRANNY'S SUPPER TABLE, BUT IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR TRADITION. TRADITION IS SICKENING. TRADITION WILL ROB YOU OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. TRADITION IS BAD AS CONDEMNATION. AMEN. IT'LL HAVE YOU SO CONDEMNED. IT'LL HAVE YOU SO BOUND. Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. BUT BREAK TRADITION ONE TIME AND LET THE POWER OF GOD SURGE THROUGH YOUR LIFE. ARE YOU TIRED OF GOING TO CHURCH AND LEAVING THE SAME WAY? WELL, break that old TRADITION THAT YOUR GRANDPA HAD AND YOUR DADDY HAD AND NOW YOU GOT IT. WELL, BLESS GOD. I'M A macho man and ain't nobody going to see ME CRY. HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. BREAK THAT OLD DEVIL AND LET YOUR BABY SEE THAT YOU CAN FEEL THE POWER OF GOD WHEN IT COMES INTO THE SERVICE. [applause] Oh well, y'all know what I'm talking about. Amen. WHEN I GOT MY HAIR JUST RIGHT AND I GOT AMEN. BREAK THAT OLD HOLLYWOOD TRADITION OF FASHION. AND IF THE POWER OF GOD SHAKES YOU FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING, I SAY LET TRADITION GO AND LET THE WORD OF PROMISE BREAK OUT IN THE CHURCH. [applause] &gt;&gt; TIRED OF TRADITIONS. TIRED OF WELL, THIS IS HOW WE DO IT. AND AMEN. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT. DO IT THE WAY THE WORD SAID DO IT. &gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY? &gt;&gt; BREAK THOSE VEILS. It's a devil. &gt;&gt; It's called a devil. &gt;&gt; Tradition is of the devil. &gt;&gt; It's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Quiet the music down. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I tell you, down there at Grace Tabernacle, that m that music, it's just blaring and it's just LOUD AND AND WE LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; SORRY, I'm home. I'm feeling good, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; WE LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; WE LOVE IT. I TELL YOU DOWN THERE, MAN. THEY THEY they play that piano and they BEAT HIM AND WE LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; And I just I'm just sorry. I'm not political. I'm not good at being political. OKAY? AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUSIC LOUD, WELL, I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. IT'S CALLED A DEVIL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PRO OF I FEEL that spirit clear AS A WORLD. PROBABLY GOD SAID DEMONS ARE DROVE OUT BY MUSIC. &gt;&gt; HE SAID WHEN THEM MUSICIANS BEGIN TO PLAY THEM INSTRUMENTS, IT BEGINS TO DRIVE THEM DEVILS OUT TO MAKE AN ATMOSPHERE CONDUCIVE THAT THE WORD CAN COME FORTH AND CAN BEAR RESULTS AMONGST THE CONGREGATION. THEN IF THERE'S A DEVIL THAT DON'T LIKE A LITTLE MUSIC, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. IT'S A CHURCH OF CHRIST DEVIL AND IT'S A TRADITION AND IT DON'T BELONG IN THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. I'LL SHOUT BY MYSELF. I'M TIRED OF TRADITIONS. TRADITIONS KILL YOUNG PEOPLE. TRADITIONS KILL THE MOVE OF GOD. TRADITIONS BIND THE EFFECT OF THE WORD OF PROMISE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, I REBUKE EVERY MAN-MADE TRADITION. AND I CALL FOR THE FIRE OF GOD TO FALL UPON THE ALTAR OF GOD AND CONSUME THE SACRIFICE OF PRAISE. You know what your prophet said? He said he's unconquered by tradition. &gt;&gt; You know why people don't want Jesus around? &gt;&gt; He's unconquered by tradition. &gt;&gt; Brother Peter, he tears traditions up. I &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; They was having a feast. &gt;&gt; They had their kosher and brother Joel, they had their rock over there that represented the rock and lers and they had this good traditional feast. &gt;&gt; Brother Dave, Jesus walked right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's that's cute, but &gt;&gt; I'm the bread of life. NO, NO, NO. SEE, SEE, I'M THE WATER THAT WAS IN THAT ROCK. &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU ALL ARE BACK THERE WHERE I WAS, &gt;&gt; BUT COME OVER HERE WHERE I AM. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BACK THERE IN A TRADITION AND YOU GOT CONFIDENCE IN THAT TRADITION, BUT LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THAT TRADITION. AND OH, GOD, &gt;&gt; come on. IF YOU CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHERE GOD WAS, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHERE GOD IS. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE GOD WAS WITH YOU 10 YEARS AGO, YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE HE'S WITH YOU TODAY. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE GOD WAS YOUR JOY WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE GOD IS [screaming] YOUR JOY TODAY. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT A PROPHET SAID WAS THE TRUTH ON STANDARDS 20 YEARS AGO, YOU OUGHT TO STILL BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT TODAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE APPEARING OF THE LORD. NOW, now I got some time here. I want to &gt;&gt; I may slow down here, but will you stay with me? &gt;&gt; The word of promise stands up. Sister Joyce right there in the middle of the t in the tabernacle reads the scripture and says, "Now that's what Isaiah said. That's who I am. &gt;&gt; This day this scripture is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; And he walked over and he sat down. Now in Luke chapter 4, if you skip down to verse 28, it says this. And all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with joy and shouts and praising and running all brother Brian. They were filled with wrath &gt;&gt; AND THEY ROSE UP. NOW AIN'T it funny? The only time they went into action &gt;&gt; is when they got mad. &gt;&gt; Morgan, I'm gonna need a bodyguard today. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY TIME THEY EVER DID ANYTHING IN CHURCH IS WHEN THEY GOT MAD. &gt;&gt; The only time they ever really got in the service is when the preacher got to preaching against somebody they had somebody against. Man, this wall is getting pretty boring. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY TIME THEY MOVED WAS WHEN THEY ROSE UP TO THROW HIM OUT OF THE CITY. NOW WATCH IN VERSE 29. AND THEY LED HIM INTO THE BROW OF THE HILL WHERE ON THEIR CITY WAS BUILT. NOW WATCH THIS. THAT THEY MIGHT CAST HIM OUT. NOW I WANT YOU TO NOTICE WHAT THEY THROW OUT. THEY DON'T THROW HIS FEET OUT, &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRIAN. THEY DON'T THROW HIM OUT BY HIS LEG. THE BIBLE SAYS THEY THREW HIM OUT headlong &gt;&gt; when he picked UP THE SCRIPTURE AND IDENTIFIED I AM HE. THIS DAY THIS SCRIPTURE IS FULFILLED. NOW LISTEN THAT BECOME FULFILLED WORD WHICH BECOME THE HEADSHIP AND THEY COULD NOT RECEIVE HIS HEAD. &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS HE WAS HEALING, HE WAS THE MESSIAH. BROTHER TRAVIS, AS LONG AS HE WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD, HE WAS THE MESSIAH. BUT THE VERY MINUTE THAT HE SAID, "I AM THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I AM THE STANDARD. I AM WHAT ISAIAH SPOKE OF," THEY SAID, "HOLD IT NOW. YOU GOT A PROBLEM." DO DO YOU REALIZE THINGS HADN'T CHANGED THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER? &gt;&gt; NOTHING HAS CHANGED 2,000 YEARS LATER. THEY STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HEADSHIP. OH, THEY WERE SHOUTING IN THE FIRST POOL. THEY WERE SHOUTING IN JONESBORO. THEY WERE SHOUTING. AMEN. OUT THERE IN MISS WALKA. THEY WERE SHOUTING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL. BUT WHEN IT COME TO THAT THIRD PULL, WHEN IT COME TO THAT WORD COMING INTO AUTHORITY IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, THEY SAID, "HOLD IT. WAIT A SECOND." AMEN. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO READ THIS TO YOU FROM REVELATION 10:1. AND I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COME down &gt;&gt; from heaven, &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS CLOTHED WITH A CLOUD, &gt;&gt; AND A RAINBOW WAS UP ON HIS HEAD, AND HIS FACE AS IT WERE THE SUN, AND HIS FEET as pillars of fire. &gt;&gt; Now, we read that, and how many's ever heard that? Amen. I I want to I want to take a little moment here this morning and establish something. Amen. How many's ever heard about a cloud appearing? You heard about that? 1965. Now, I want to show y'all something. This cloud appears. Amen. In 1963, I would like to call your attention the rise of the sun this morning to a picture. Brother Bram walks in there. Uh, brother brother Peter, could you come here and help me for a second? Brother walks in there and I can imagine it was something like this. He kind of pulled a magazine out. He kind of turned that magazine over there and he he found the place. Now, will you Will you do me a favor and hold that straight up there? He he he let's hold it up where everybody can see it. There you go. He turns to that in the magazine. Now listen folks, this is not a Bible. &gt;&gt; This is not a spoken word book. THIS IS A LIFE MAGAZINE IN 1963. AND HE HOLDS THIS UP AND SAYS NOW FAKE WAS NOW NOW I HEARD THAT BLESS THE Holy of my life. He said but HERE THE OTHER DAY SCIENCE TOOK THE PICTURE AND HE SAID IT WENT IN THE AIR AND HE SAID LIFE MAGAZINE PACKED THE PICTURES AND HE SAID NOW HERE'S WHAT IT SAID. NOW I TOOK TIME. AMEN. BECAUSE RIGHT HERE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS after church you can. How many's ever seen this before? Let me see your hand. If you've never seen it, if you never seen it, raise your hand. No, no, no embarrassment. You've never seen it. Okay. 1963, Revelation 10:1, "A mighty angel come down. A cloud appeared." Okay, THIS IS IN LIFE MAGAZINE. AND HERE'S THE ARTICLE. HE SAYS, "NOW, AND AND RIGHT HERE, HOVERING LIKE A GIANT SMOKE RING, A GREAT CLOUD APPEARED AT SUNSET OVER FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, LAST February 28th, AND SET OFF A CONTINUING SCIENTIFIC MYSTERY. WATCHERS STRUCK BY THE CLOUDS ODD SHAPE and huge size took pictures like these four at different locations in the state. DR. JAMES MCDONALD, A METEOROLOGIST OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEIC UH PHYSICS IN TUCSON HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING THE PICTURES. NOW LISTEN, USING THEM AS THE BASIS FOR THE TRIGONOMETRIC CALCULATION, HE HAS MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY THAT THE CLOUD WAS AT LEAST 26 MILES HIGH AND 30 MILES ACROSS. IT WAS A LOT HIGHER AND BIGGER. &gt;&gt; OH, I LOVE THAT. IT WAS A LOT HIGHER AND BIGGER, HE SAYS, THAN A CLOUD SHOULD BE. NOW, THE CIRCLE WAS TOO HIGH TO BE MADE A JET PLANE TO BE MADE BY A JET PLANE. AND AS FAR AS DR. MCDONALD CAN DETERMINE, THERE WERE NO ROCKETS, ROCKET PLANES, OR BOMBS BEING TESTED NEARBY THAT DAY. HE HOPES THAT ANYONE ELSE WITH PICTURES WILL LEND THEM TO HIM. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO CATCH. FOR HE WOULD LIKE SOME MORE CLUES. HE WOULD LIKE SOME MORE CLUES ABOUT THE CLOUD THAT WAS 26 MILES UP BECAUSE NO WATER DROPLETS EXIST AT THAT HEIGHT TO MAKE A CLOUD. BROTHER PETER, I'M THE GUY THAT HAD TO KNOW WHAT DOES THE WORD CLUES MEANS? IT MEANS A PIECE OF EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION THAT IS USED IN THE SOLVING OF A MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOME EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY. AMEN. WHAT IS THIS MYSTERIOUS CLOUD THAT APPEARED OUT THERE IN SUNSET? HE SAID, "IT IS A FACT OR AN IDEA THAT SERVES TO REVEAL SOMETHING OR TO SOLVE A PROBLEM." WELL, A PROPHET WALKED IN THERE AND HE SAID, "NOW, YOU GOT THIS PICTURE AND YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT IT WAS." AMEN. CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING? HE WENT TO JACK MOORE &gt;&gt; FOR MAN-MADE INTERPRETATION. BROTHER JACK, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? AND JACK GAVE HIM A MAN-MADE INTERPRETATION. WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I THINK IT'S THIS. HE SAID, "AND SOMETHING DID NOT STRIKE A BAIL." &gt;&gt; But if YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT, &gt;&gt; IF YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT, NOW THEY WERE DOING IT LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But if you Now hold it there. &gt;&gt; IF YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT, HE SAID, "OH, DO YOU SEE IT? &gt;&gt; IT'S HOFFMAN'S HEAD OF CHRIST. IT'S OUR LORD UP THERE. COME ON, CHURCH. THE WORLD WAS LOOKING FOR CLUES. THE WORLD WAS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO REVEAL WHAT IS SO SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS CLOUD. BUT A PROPHET WALKED ON THE PLATFORM AND HE TURNED TO REVELATIONS 10. AND HE SAID A CLOUD WOULD COME DOWN. IT WOULD BE OUR HEADSHIP. I GOT TO TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING, OKAY? IF there's two pictures we're hated for, it's this picture and the pillar of fire. PEOPLE HATE THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE IN THOSE PICTURES, BUT CAN I TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING? WE DIDN'T TAKE THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Y'all heard brother WAYNE SAY THAT ABOUT THE PILLAR OF FIRE. WE DIDN'T TAKE THAT PICTURE. I WAS SITTING THERE LAST NIGHT IN MY OFFICE LOOKING AT THIS AND IT JUST STRUCK ME. WE DIDN'T TAKE THIS ONE EITHER. &gt;&gt; A SCIENTIST TOOK IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IF HE WAS ALIVE TODAY, I WOULD PHONE HIM UP AND I'D INVITE HIM OVER TO BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS, AND I'D SAY, "YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CLUES? THEY'RE SITTING ON PEWS. YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CLUES? THEY'RE SITTING ON PEWS." YOU SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" HE SAID, "THAT WILL BRING THE REVELATION OF MYSTERY BY GOD. THAT'LL BRING THE REVELATION OF WATER BAPTISM." OH, I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, I'M NOT KICKING MY LORD OUT. I SAY IT'S MY LORD OF MY HEADSHIP. THANK YOU BUDDY. THAT'S MY HEADSHIP AND I AM NOT ASHAMED OF IT. &gt;&gt; He comes down there in that sermon. He says, "We little humble group compared with all the world. We've enjoyed these blessings of hearing those mysteries. Marriage and divorce, serpent seed, all these different questions." Listen, are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Has been completely revealed to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by a man &gt;&gt; but by God &gt;&gt; himself that opened those seven mysteries of what the church was, how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it be revealed in the last day. Can I can I can I drop one more thing to you? He says, "Now, if you turn the picture like this, it's Christ. &gt;&gt; See his eyes looking here, just as perfect as it could be, wearing the white wig of supreme deity, judge of all heavens and earth." See, do you see my point? &gt;&gt; He didn't even make it about himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't put confidence in me. I'm a man. &gt;&gt; I'm full of mistakes, but what I'm saying about him, &gt;&gt; brother Matt. It's what I'm saying about him. &gt;&gt; He's the one. &gt;&gt; Can I Can I Can I just say this to you this morning? I feel the Holy Spirit moving right now. It's he &gt;&gt; the one. &gt;&gt; The devil can tack all But Tim, he can tack all the dirty names on us he wants to. &gt;&gt; Man, followers cult &gt;&gt; whatever. But at the end of the day, show me one other preacher that lifted Jesus so &gt;&gt; high. &gt;&gt; Years ago, somebody told me a testimony, brother Mark. They said this woman had been want to go to brother's meetings back in the 40s and 50s, and she didn't have enough money to get there, and her husband was real real alcoholic. He didn't he didn't like the word, didn't like church, nothing. Didn't want nothing to do with it. So, she saved up some money, got enough money to ride down one brother's meetings. And she she left there and she said, "I'm finally getting to go go go to Abraham's meetings. I finally get to see him and I'm going there." And she come home and man, she was she went to meet and she come home and she was shouting and she was rejoicing and he was sitting over there and he said, "Yeah, here comes that here comes that man worshiper, you know." And she said, "Oh, praise the Lord." You know, and he said, "Probably about half drunk." He looked over at her. He said, "Well, you went down there." He said, "What are you so happy about? Did you see him?" She said, "No, I didn't. He said, "Ha, I told you you wasted all that money and went down there and you didn't see him." She said, "I didn't." She He said, "Well, who was down there?" She said, "Brother Abraham was there." She said, "He was there and he preached and had a prayer line and I got to go through it." He said, "And you didn't see him?" She said, "No, I couldn't." He said, "What do you mean?" She said, "HE LIFTED JESUS SO HIGH, &gt;&gt; I couldn't EVEN SEE WHO WAS DOING THE LIFTING." [applause] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE PEERING OF THE LORD. IT'S MY REVELATION. IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR. YOU SAY, "PREACHER, HOW IN THE WORLD I KNOW I'M OUT OF TIME, but I I got I got I got to just SAY THIS." BROTHER RAM COMES in that 1965 rise in the sun and he said, "That is a perfect identification again of indication. This message is the truth. This is the truth. It's true." making him not a third person but the only person. He said, "And now notice," now this is what I want to close on right here. He said, "And now notice from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to and on the cross." But they Paul that day on Calvary on the cross he looked to the right where he pardoned the sinner. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; You say, "WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT A PAGE IN A MAGAZINE?" BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE BIBLE BEFORE IT WAS IN A MAGAZINE. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LORD JESUS CHRIST APPEARING TO SHOW YOU THIS SCRIPTURES FULFILLED. CAN CAN I CAN I TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING? &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS?" OKAY. WELL, can you all imagine with me for just a second that Jesus walks in the temple, brother Matt? He's sitting there and they hand him a scroll. He walks out there. He opens it up and he begins to read. He goes over to Isaiah. He begins to read Isaiah and he says, "This day the scriptures fulfilled." and he walks over there and he sits down in the Messiah's chair and all the eyes of the people are upon him and they all get mad and they get full of wrath and they come up here and they grab him and they lead him out. They they they lead him out to the brow our Lord Jesus the word made flesh &gt;&gt; from written word to manifested fulf are you with me &gt;&gt; brother Matt they lead him up to the brow of the heel and they throw him out by the head &gt;&gt; trained in the scriptures &gt;&gt; could twist you up could tie you up could show you how you shouldn't eat meat and wash pots and do all this so trained And the most trained people failed to recognize him &gt;&gt; and threw him out. &gt;&gt; But the same one they threw out &gt;&gt; was hanging up on a cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS A THIEF HANGING NEXT TO HIM ON THE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE VERY ONE THEY THREW OUT, HE'S HANGING THERE NEXT TO HIM. AND AS HE'S HANGING THERE IN HIS FINAL BREAST, HE SAYS THESE WORDS, "FATHER, INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT." IN HIS FINAL BREAST, AND THERE'S A SINNER THERE, AND HE LOOKS OVER AND HE SAYS, "When you come into your kingdom, will you remember me? When you COME INTO YOUR KINGDOM, WILL YOU REMEMBER ME?" YOU SAY, "PREACHER, WHY DO YOU PREACH THIS MESSAGE WITH SUCH AUTHORITY?" BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GIVE ANYBODY A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; CAN I GET A WITNESS TODAY? WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE, YOU WOULDN'T HAD A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS WORD, YOU DIDN'T FIT IN SOCIETY. YOU DIDN'T FIT IN DENOMINATIONS. YOU DIDN'T FIT IN LITTLE GROUPS. BUT THIS MESSAGE OPENED A DOOR. &gt;&gt; It gave you a place. He looks over at him and he says, "This day you'll be with me in paradise." Preacher, what are you saying? I'm saying God has sent this message, the word of promise to call you out of confusion. Rever says this. He says, "Now when the calling out time comes that you don't belong to any of it. I'm very popular to say I'm Pentecost or I'm Presbyterian Lutheran. But what about when it comes to that time you have to come out and stand for the word and say, "I don't belong to any of it." &gt;&gt; Will you be embarrassed? Then &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Now, why why would he be ashamed of you? Because you're claiming to be his &gt;&gt; and you won't follow him." &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I just leave you this? &gt;&gt; If you're going to claim to be his, follow him. Don't throw him out. &gt;&gt; Follow him. &gt;&gt; Let our musicians come this morning. &gt;&gt; What if I said this little boy, he's my son? He turned around and said, "Who? Me be your son? What do you think I am?" It would embarrass me. It would to your son. And that's what's so-called Christianity today. If your name is denomination, all right, they accept the fatherhood of denomination. But when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of God, Christ, no, they're embarrassed. Listen, they don't want to say, "I've spoke with tongues." They don't want to say, "I've seen visions." They don't want to say, "I believe in divine healing. Yes, I praise the Lord. Yes, I'm free from all this organization. I'm not bowing down to any of that. I am a servant of Christ." Oh my. That would just tear them to pieces. But I wonder this morning, is there any Christians here? &gt;&gt; Is there any word believers here today? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody can say today, no matter the pressure, &gt;&gt; I will not back down. If they ban this book from every ever every place in this world and tomorrow they call for these Bibles to be burnt and thrown away, I'll never bow. &gt;&gt; I'll never bend &gt;&gt; cuz the word has been hid in my heart. &gt;&gt; You know, this morning I I I've I've come to this point in the sermon and I want to I want to bring it down to you like this. What is your confession today? Sometimes I wonder if we don't just and I want you to hear me right now. Sometimes I wonder if we don't just get settled down in the fact we believe the message. We follow a prophet. But David, sometimes I wonder if we get settled on that fact and we forget that there's a life &gt;&gt; that goes with it. unlike the world. &gt;&gt; Don't look like the world. &gt;&gt; See, if you want to look like the world, there's a there's a million denominational churches. &gt;&gt; Folks don't get mad at me, but they'll let that makeup get on your face. &gt;&gt; They'll let them splits get higher and higher in dresses. They'll let them back to us. And they'll let them title baptisms just go right on through. Just put just put some money in the offering plate. See y'all next Sunday. But if God turned to you in the right with this word and pardoned your life and gave you a future by the truth of this Bible, then [music] don't you think there ought to come such a such an ambition to live a life above reproach? One day I'm going to preach a sermon on it. The word brings the reproach. Don't be the reproach. Listen folks, Paul comes there in Acts 24:14. Now, this is this is Paul and he said, "This I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers." They deemed the way he was worshiping heresy. And he didn't go hide in the corner, Brother David, and say, "You know what? I'm just going to I'm just going to hide over here and I'm not going to worship God and I'm not going to praise him. He walked up before me. HE SAID, "THE WAY Y'ALL CALL heresy is the way I worship the God of my fathers." Now, I love this. Believe in all things which are written in the law and in the prophets. Y'all ever y'all ever been in a good a good hot meeting and the Holy Ghost get to fall and people get to shouting and dancing and the preacher get up and say in the way they call heresies so worship I the God of my father. Glory to God. They call us heretics but we worship God. Listen, there's a whole lot more to that verse than just emotional worship folks. The reason they were being called heretics was not because they're shouting and dancing. It was because they took a stand and said, "I believe everything in that Bible &gt;&gt; and I believe everything those prophets taught." You know what that word believing means? To place confidence in. &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning, would there be one here today could say, "Lord, today I renew my [music] vow. &gt;&gt; I place my confidence &gt;&gt; in the presence of this word. I hear I hear the word call in my name this morning. I hear a calling. I hear a calling for more than just a Sunday morning service. Let me say, Lord, I want to live this word. Won't you bow your hearts this morning? See, heresy, crazy, idiotic. Well, we are called that. Because the supernatural is so much different from the carnal things of this world till it makes people think they're crazy till it makes people think they're mad. But I can tell you [music] this morning, I've got confidence in his appearing. Now, his appearing was doing more than just making us feel good. His appearing was doing [music] more than just giving us a better circle of friends to hang with. His appearing was bringing his word into full effect. I [music] wonder this morning if there would be one could say, "Lord, I want this message, every part of it, to be in full effect in my life." Lord, if there's one area that I'm if there's one area that I'm holding back from you, Lord, I don't want to be like those religious people that led you out of the synagogue and threw your headship out. But, Father, I receive the headship of the word today. I receive it over my life. I receive it over everything about me. I receive it over my home. I receive it over the books I read, over the music I listen to, over the places I go. over the things I watch, over the things I do. I receive the headship of this word [music] over my life. Father, take things out of my life that's unlike you. Hallelujah. I've ever had bowed every eye closed this morning. The Holy Spirit just moving right now. Hands up all over this building this morning. The Holy Ghost is coming by right now. The word, the spirit of God is honing, cutting this away and cutting that away. Oh Lord, I want to have confidence in this word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Almighty God, maybe there be one sitting here today that's losing confidence in this message. They're losing confidence in the things that's been revealed by this prophet. Lord, they're losing confidence because of associations and communications with the spirits of unbelief. Father, maybe things in their life are beginning to change and standards are begin to lower because Lord, man-made interpretations and traditions and veils of man had begun to veil what was unveiled by the revealing of the son of man. Maybe some here today, Lord, is becoming embarrassed of things they believe and becoming embarrassed of things they they they stood for so long. Father, I rebuke that spirit today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, as I heard one say just the other day, they were telling me how embarrassed they were of the way that they had raised their children and the things they had put them through and the things they had taught them. And Lord, as I stood there and heard that man say that, something just rose up in me. And I looked over at him and I said, "Sir, you mean to tell me you're embarrassed of the way you raised your kids [singing] by this message?" I said, "Your two daughters over there serving God, married to Holy Ghost fil men, believe in this word. Your young son there belie. Oh God, don't ever let that be said about one of us, Lord. Don't let us ever let Leoa put so much pressure upon us that we become [music] ashamed of the standards and the truth of this end time word of promise. Lord, let us bow to you before we bow to this world. Lord, let us surrender our hearts and our lives into your hands before we surrender them into the hands of some man-made interpretation. In Jesus name we pray. In Jesus name we pray. Oh, I wonder today with every head bowed, every eye closed, we could say, "Lord, search my heart today. Search my heart today." &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Search my heart today. &gt;&gt; Wash me today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to be like those who sit in the temple. &gt;&gt; They saw your word manifested. They saw the Messiah and they walked out and said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; he's a crazy man." No, I want to say hosana. Hosanna not know. Sing it. How he came to [singing] love me so he [singing] looked me up. soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, the pardon grace of God. I shall forever lift my eyes to Calary to [music] you. The cross [singing] where Jesus [music] died for me. How are [singing] the grace and my falling soul? He looked [singing] beyond my [singing] fall. It's all I need. How many can you testify of God into [singing and music] the light where I can [music and singing] clearly Is this house [music and singing] shall the mountain? &gt;&gt; He looked [singing] me up [music] all my faults and saw my Thank you for the finish as we worship you today. I shall [music] forever live and I [singing] should [music] come to [singing and music] you cross where Jesus [music and singing] died for me. How [singing] far [music] the grace [singing] called my [music] falling soul. He looked beyond my faults and saw my you know this morning you might be sitting there wondering said brother Andrew why in the world would you take time to establish something as mysterious as a cloud that appeared in 63. free. Well, you know the prophet of God said, he said, "History will repeat itself." He said, "What has happened will happen again." And do you realize that that Moses spoke of the Messiah? Isaiah spoke of him. Zachchariah spoke of him. You know, Daniel spoke of him. You know, Jeremiah spoke of him. The Old Malachi spoke of him. Brother Brian, the Old Testament is full of prophets that were speaking of a coming Messiah. Do you know John the Baptist rose up on the scene and you know what he said, Brother Wesley? He stood there on the river and he said, "Behold, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Behold the Messiah." John spoke of him. &gt;&gt; Do you know that same Messiah walked in the temple, went straight back to the word, and [snorts] they threw him out. fine. [music] You know, today I can show you where Daniel spoke of this cloud. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I can show it to you in the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; I can show to you in the book of Revelation where John saw this cloud coming down. &gt;&gt; And I can read you a 100 quotes where a prophet come on the scene and identify that mysterious cloud was the fulfillment of Revelation 10:1. And I can show you a thousand churches that took it and threw [music] it out. Brother Mark, I can say this morning, as for Grace Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; we believe in [music] the appearing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We stand with it. &gt;&gt; We stand with the revelation of his presence. &gt;&gt; And there is no devil going to intimidate us &gt;&gt; and back us off of it. Listen, I really wish I could, brother David. I wish I could phone up that Dr. McDonald and call him over here to Black Rockck. Claim to sit in a service and hear the word preached. So, he's looking for some clues. Hey buddy, it wasn't a scientific mystery. It was a spiritual mystery. And it was bringing to pass the revelation of his word. Listen, this message is giving you a place to stand. And the devil can't get in anywhere. &gt;&gt; You love him today. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if we could stand on our feet as we sing it again today. I shall forever lift my &gt;&gt; I shall [singing] forever. &gt;&gt; I wonder who could raise your hands today and worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who lift [singing] my [music] life. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, I've heard it a hund times." Well, you heard it 101 today. But it's [music] grace [singing] the cross [music] where Jesus died for me. How one [music] who loves who grace all [singing] my falling [music] soul. He looked beyond my and saw my [music] Amen. you love him today. Amen. You really love him today. Amen. You [music] want to raise your hands and say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me a revelation. Thank you for giving me a place to stand. The devil can't come in." [music] Amen. Amen. I wonder this morning if we could sing that old song, I You know that I learn how to lean and depend on Jesus. You know that song? Learning. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To [singing and music] lead. &gt;&gt; I'm learning. &gt;&gt; Anybody being taught by the word? &gt;&gt; I'm learning. &gt;&gt; This message is not just birthing sons. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's teaching them by the scriptures. Jesus, I [music and singing] find more power than I [singing] ever need to. [music] Oh, can you raise your hands and sing it? Glory to me Lord [singing] I glory. Thank you Lord for teaching me. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for showing me the scriptures. Oh Jesus I find thee. [music and singing] Oh power and I dream of [music] Jesus. Oh, I'm learning to live. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "God's willing [music] to teach." &gt;&gt; If you're willing to learn, [singing] oh my [music] to Jesus, [music] I find more power than [music] I ever dream. I'm learning to live on Jesus. Amen. God bless you this morning. We love you with the love of the Lord. I pray something was said today to bless you and to help you. Amen. My only my only burden in my heart is to sh up this message, [music] the word of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. open and made manifest to see it established in the hearts of the people. Listen, I I think it's time as believers we start digging in these things. [music] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why we do the things we do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why we preach the things we preach. There's a reason why we stand for the things we stand for. Listen, it's the word [music] of God. It's true. Amen. God bless you today. Amen. Won't you turn around and shake somebody's hand and say, "God bless you." Amen. It's an honor to serve with you. Amen. We stand for this word. We stand for this Bible. We stand for the principles of God. Amen. Amen. God bless you today, Brother David. It's good to have you up here, buddy. I've enjoyed preaching with you over there. Amen. God bless you. Amen. We love you today with the love of the Lord. Amen. Just get that little extra charge. Amen. We say God bless you all today. Amen. May the spirit of the Lord rest upon you for the rest of your day. And amen. We We'll be be in Canada [music] next week. So you remember us in your prayers. Amen. And we'll be back home soon. Amen. God bless you, brother [music] Matt. Would you come? I'm learning [singing] to leave. Learning [music] to live. I'm learning to live on Jesus. [music] I need more power [singing and music] than I ever dream. Cuz I'm learning to lean [music] on Jesus. Well, I'm amazed that you love [singing] me. Oh, I'm amazed [music] how you care. For your precious blood I found [music] pardon. And my sins are [music and singing] washed. They're all washed away. My sins [music] are washed away. Cuz I'm amazed that you love me. [music] I'm amazed how you came. [music and singing] Through your preious blood, I found pardon. [music] And my sins are washed. They're [music] all [singing] washed away. My sins are washed. Amen. I'm not ashamed of it. I'm amazed [music] this morning. It's true. [singing] There have been days that I've failed you. Lord, [bell] you know there's many [music and singing] times I've gone astray, but I have learned your love is stronger [music and singing] than my every weakness. And your ear is open every time I pray. [music] You see, no one else has ever cared for [music] me like Jesus. [singing] I've never had a friend [music] that's been this close to [singing] me. So I'm not afraid to face the problems [music] of [singing] tomorrow. Cuz I know [music] you are everything I'll ever need. Oh, I'm amazed [music] that you love [singing] me. I'm amazed [music] how you care. For your preious [music and singing] blood I found pardoned. For my [music and singing] sins are wash. They're all washed away. [music and singing] My sins are washed away. [music] Yes, I'm amazed. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. [singing] Through your precious [music] blood. I found pardon. [music] And my sins are [singing] washed. They're all washed away. [music] My [singing] sins are washed away. Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? I wonder how many can say, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ." Amen. Jesus said, he said, "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him, the son of man will be ashamed when he [music] comes in his own glory and in his fathers and in of the holy angels." I thought, Lord, don't let me be ashamed of you. Don't let me be ashamed to be able to stand on the word of God and lift it in this hour. And and friends, I got news for you. It's a greater, you know, brother Andrew [music] was preaching about they threw him headlong out of the city. Do you realize that the that what those men had to face for that action today is far worse? Because Jesus hung on a cross of Calvary and said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." But that same man, Jesus, when he stood on the earth, he said, "You can speak evil against me, and I'll forgive you." But there's one coming after me. And one word spoken against him will not be forgiven you in this world or in the world to come. It's a far greater far greater thing [music] today to reject the word of God. I think my here is this is the age of of the rapture. That's why God sent a message in this hour is to turn [music] the hearts of the children back to the faith of their fathers. Amen. That's what God has done in this hour. I can just say this this morning. I know it's drawn late. But friends, don't reject the message because some fanatics in this world have deified a prophet of God and made him a deity and worship and all this goofy stuff that people do. Don't [music] reject the truth or the reality of a beautiful thing that God has sent in this hour, which was the grace of God. And [music] and the very purpose of it was to redeem God's children back to him. Don't reject that because of fanaticism. [music] &gt;&gt; You can reject the fanatic &gt;&gt; and accept the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it wasn't I know this. They say you're lifting up a man and all this, but friends, I got news for you. There's never been a man. I've listened to hundreds and hundreds [music] of ministers in my lifetime. I'm a big studier uh of ministers. I've listened to every every proclaimed minister there was over over years of my life. and that was supposed to have a gift and people that claimed to be prophets and claimed to be gifted of God. And I've never heard a man that ever preached like William Brandham. There's never a man that's ever preached that lifted Jesus higher than [music] that man ever lifted him. No man lifts Christ. I it's so easy to see through men when they go and preach and and and edify themselves and you you you can just tell listening to them if they they want the glory and they're building up a kingdom for theirel and that one man you'll never hear that one time he did nothing but lift Jesus Christ. So when somebody says you're lifting him up, it ain't me lifting him up. It was God that lifted him up because Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me. and he lifted him so high that God elevated him to a platform to lift Jesus. Therefore, we are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I can do just what that man said. There ain't nothing greater than this Bible. There's no greater book that's ever been written. It is God. It is God in in letter form. [music] But it ain't just left in letter. It's became a living reality in the age that we're living in. And the purpose of that ministry was to bring this Bible back to life so that you had something to be able to stand for. That it wasn't just a God of history. Amen. But God is alive today. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? I Brother Wayne preached a wonderful message on it here a few months or weeks ago when he was in the tent meeting. I believe it was Brother [music] Wayne and said, "If you had to go and stand on trial and to prove that Jesus was alive today, what would you use to [music] prove it?" You think about it. What church? It couldn't be your church. Couldn't be the bishop. It couldn't be the founder and no, it couldn't be no denomination. Nothing you could have that you could prove it. It would have to be a living reality because Jesus said, "The works that I do shall you do also." So that's the only way you would find that [music] he was alive today. It was the works that he done. And you know what? They persecuted Jesus in that day for his works. Remember he said, "Why do you stone me? For which of these works do you stone me? I've raised the dead. I've healed the sick. I've I've g gave I've I've I've opened the eyes of the blind caused the lame to walk. Says, see, it wasn't because [music] something bad that he done. It was good that he done. And that's why Satan hates it. &gt;&gt; Because the works that I do show you do also. It identifies the presence of Jesus Christ. [music] And it allows believers today to be a fulfillment of what Jesus said would happen in this age. And that's why [music] Satan attacks it so much. But friends, I got news for you this morning. We're going to fulfill it anyway. You realize that everybody is fulfilling scripture. Can I say that to you? Everybody in the world is fulfilling scripture. God bless you. Amen. Take that with you. Everybody's fulfilling scripture. But the question is, what scripture are you fulfilling? Somebody's going to persecute. Somebody's going to scoff. Somebody's going to mock. Somebody's going to make fun. And there's somebody's going to believe it. Somebody's going to Somebody's going to go through tribulation. And somebody's going to make a rapture. We're all fulfilling scripture. The question is just what scripture are you fulfilling? Amen. I don't know about you, but I want to find all of them that pertained to the believer in this last stage and say, "Lord, let me be that. Let me be the believer." Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. It's [music] just such a privilege. How many enjoyed that message this morning? Amen. [applause] Appreciate the service. Amen. I I love it when you can stand behind a man and not wonder what he believes. Amen. There's too many people have to wonder. We don't have to wonder what we believe. We We just put it out there. It ain't no secret. We just put it out there. We believe it. We love the Lord with all of our heart. And I believe that one day that this world will no longer be here. I believe that what the Bible said about it will take place. And I believe there'll be a bride that'll leave this earth and go into a rapture. And I look forward to being a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you Lord for a wonderful word. And Lord, I just thank you for our brother just opening up his heart and speaking what was on his heart this morning. Lord, what a encouragement to the believers. And God, to be able to identify you in this age, Lord, what a what a a powerful There's nothing more powerful, Lord, than to be able to identify you, to know that you're not just a God of history, but Lord, we can we can look around the room and see you operating in people's lives, Lord, and living and walking and working among your church today. Lord, we just thank you for this word. Lord, I thank you for a body of believers, Lord. And God, I thank you for coming and restoring our faith back to your word again in this hour, Lord. I ask you that you would go with each one as we leave this place, Lord. Keep your hands upon them, Lord. And we come back rejoicing in thy word [music] on Wednesday. And we just thank you for all you do for us now in Jesus Christ's name. Give our brother strength, Lord, for his labor. We pray in [music] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you this morning as you go. Well, I'm getting [singing] ready to leave [music] this world. I'm getting ready for the gates of good keeping my record line. Watching both day and night. I'm getting ready to leave [singing and music] this world. Well, I'm getting ready to leave this world. I'm getting ready for the gates of pearl. I'm keeping my record right. Watching [singing] both day and night. [music] I'm getting ready to leave this world. Laying up my treasures [singing] in the home above. Trusting fully, trusting in the Savior's love. Doing what I [music] can for that holy [singing] love. I'm getting ready to leave [music and singing] this world. Well, I'm getting ready to leave this [singing] world. Well, I'm getting ready for the gates of fur. Well, I'm keeping my record right, watching
