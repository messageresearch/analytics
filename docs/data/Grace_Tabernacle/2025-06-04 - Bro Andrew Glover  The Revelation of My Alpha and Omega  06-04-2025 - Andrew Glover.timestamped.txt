[28:35] where would I be? I've been clapping.
[28:39] Amen. As our pastor comes this season,
[28:41] I'm so glad that the Lord brought me
[28:44] out.
[28:46] Oh, I'm so glad that my Lord, he brought
[28:49] me
[28:50] out. Oh, if it had not been for Jesus,
[28:54] where would I be? I've been since the
[28:57] Lord, he brought me
[28:59] out. Oh, I've been happy since the Lord
[29:02] brought me
[29:04] out. Oh, I've been happy since my Lord,
[29:07] he brought me
[29:08] out. Well, if it had not been for Jesus,
[29:12] where would I be? I've been happy since
[29:16] the Lord. He brought me out. Oh, give
[29:18] the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[29:23] evening. Let's sing that song. I'm in
[29:25] this church, this glorious church.
[29:28] Aren't you thankful you're in this
[29:29] church this evening? I'm not talking
[29:31] about this physical building. Aren't you
[29:32] thankful you're in the church of the
[29:33] Lord this
[29:35] evening? And I'm in this
[29:38] church, this glorious
[29:40] church. I didn't join. I was born. And I
[29:44] had a new birth. Some glorious day.
[29:48] Going to sail
[29:49] away. It's by his grace, not by my
[29:52] works. I'm I'll sing it again. I'm in
[29:56] this
[29:57] church. This glorious church. I didn't
[30:01] join. I was born. I had a new birth.
[30:04] Some glorious day. Going to sail
[30:08] away. It's by his grace, not by my
[30:11] works. I'm in this church.
[30:14] When Jesus
[30:15] came, he was left
[30:17] out. There was no place where he was
[30:21] welcome here on
[30:22] earth. But he had a plan for a house
[30:26] that shall forever stand. He spoke these
[30:29] words upon this rock. I'll build my
[30:31] church. And I'm in this church, this
[30:35] glorious
[30:36] church. I didn't join. I was born. I had
[30:40] a new birth.
[30:42] Some glorious day going to sail
[30:46] away. It's by his grace, not by
[30:48] mountain. I'll sing that verse once
[30:51] more. When Jesus came, he was left
[30:55] out. There was no place where he was
[30:58] welcome here on
[31:00] earth. But he had a plan for a house
[31:04] that shall forever stand. He spoke these
[31:06] words upon this rock. I'll build my
[31:09] church. And I'm in this church, this
[31:13] glorious
[31:14] [Music]
[31:15] [Applause]
[31:18] [Music]
[31:19] church. Glorious day I'll sail
[31:24] away. By his
[31:26] grace I'm in this
[31:31] church. Amen.

[31:35] say God
[31:37] is my
[31:39] [Music]

[32:00] Yes. He's my rock.

[32:05] land, my shelter in a time of
[32:11] storm. Oh, God

[32:27] is my everything.
[32:30] [Music]
[32:31] God is my
[32:34] everything. He's my joy. He's my joy and
[32:39] sorrow.
[32:41] Yes. He's my hope. He's my hope for
[32:45] tomorrow.
[32:46] I said he's my rock. He's my rock in a
[32:52] way. He's my shelter.
[32:55] In a time of storm.
[32:58] I know God is.
[33:01] Yes, God

[33:08] everything. Amen. You believe that
[33:10] tonight? Won't you put your hands
[33:12] together for the
[33:15] Lord? We have a prayer request for Terry
[33:19] Doyle. Very needed for brother Bobby
[33:20] Gates. Also I want to remember in prayer
[33:23] brother Donald Bendabout for brother
[33:26] Wendles is in the hospital tonight
[33:28] having heart surgery asking the Lord to
[33:31] intercede on his behalf. If you have a
[33:33] need on your heart tonight I know that
[33:35] God is mindful of what we have need of.
[33:37] How many come to to get something from
[33:40] the Lord tonight. Amen. We didn't come
[33:42] to hear from a man but we come to hear
[33:44] from God and have communion with the
[33:46] Lord. I know God is more than able.
[33:48] Amen. And it doesn't matter what we have
[33:50] need of tonight, but I thank God that we
[33:52] have a place to bring it. Isn't it
[33:54] wonderful to be a believer? No matter
[33:56] what we go through, Brother West, we got
[33:58] a place to bring it. Amen. Every every
[34:00] trial, every every burden, every every
[34:03] problem that any of us would face, but
[34:05] God has given us a place to bring it
[34:07] tonight. Amen. So, why don't we just
[34:08] take it before the Lord that he would
[34:11] take our burdens and make them light.
[34:12] Isn't that right? So, let's just bow our
[34:14] heads together. Gracious heavenly
[34:15] father, Lord, what a privilege it is,
[34:18] Lord, to come and stand in this place
[34:20] tonight, Lord, just to be able to be in
[34:23] your presence once again. Lord, we are

[34:47] ministry to please you, Lord. All of our
[34:49] life, we want it to be pleasing unto
[34:51] you. And Lord, we just ask you tonight,
[34:53] Lord, that you would meet every need,
[34:55] Lord. Every hand that's raised, those
[34:57] that are sick, Lord, I pray that you
[34:58] would touch them, Lord. That you would
[35:00] lift them up, Lord. Be an encourager to
[35:02] those that need encouragement tonight.
[35:03] We ask you these things in the name of
[35:05] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Do
[35:09] you believe that tonight? That God is
[35:11] more than able. Isn't it wonderful? We
[35:13] don't matter what we have need of. He's
[35:14] more than able. Amen. Can you sing it
[35:16] with me? Well, God is

[37:02] I say God
[37:04] is God
[37:07] is my
[37:09] [Music]
[37:13] everything. Amen. Does he mean
[37:15] everything to you tonight? Amen. That
[37:18] all that he's done for us. Amen. It just
[37:20] seems like that when you sit back just
[37:23] for a few minutes, I sit out there and
[37:25] this afternoon just think about all the
[37:27] things that God has done for us.
[37:29] You know, it doesn't We've all came from
[37:31] a lot of different places and different
[37:34] backgrounds and we all have past and all
[37:36] the things that we had to dredge through
[37:38] to get to where we are, but I thank God
[37:40] that we're here. Amen. I heard somebody
[37:42] say one time, he said, "I'm not who I
[37:44] who I I need to be, but I'm sure not who
[37:46] I used to be." And I thought, "Well,
[37:47] thank God that that's way all ought to
[37:49] be tonight." Amen. I just thank God how
[37:52] good that he's been to us tonight. He's
[37:55] never failed us, and we certainly
[37:56] appreciate the Lord. Can we just sing
[37:58] this uh the goodness of God as we invite
[38:01] uh brother Andrew to come tonight? How
[38:03] many's looking forward to the word of
[38:04] God? Amen. How many's going to pull from
[38:06] the gift of God? You receive something
[38:08] from the Lord. You know how we know how
[38:10] that works for a body of believers. It's
[38:12] a people that operate a gift. Amen. It
[38:15] ain't something that a preacher can turn
[38:16] on or turn off, but it's something that
[38:18] people operate. And it don't matter what
[38:20] you have need of tonight. If you can get
[38:22] sincere before the Lord and you can pull
[38:24] from God's gift that is laying in a man,
[38:27] then God can speak to our hearts. You
[38:28] believe that tonight? Won't we just
[38:30] maybe just close your eyes and let's
[38:32] just sing this song to the Lord. I love
[38:35] you,
[38:39] Lord. Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[38:45] All my
[38:47] days I've been held in your
[38:52] hand. From the moment that I wake
[38:56] up till I lay my
[39:00] head. Yes, I will
[39:04] sing of the
[39:06] goodness of God.
[39:10] I say cuz all my life you have been
[39:15] faithful.
[39:18] How many say that's the truth tonight?
[39:21] Lord, you've been so so good.
[39:27] With every breath that I am
[39:32] able, yes, I will sing of the goodness
[39:37] of God.
[39:40] I will sing of the goodness of
[39:47] God. I love your
[39:51] voice. For you have led me through the
[39:55] [Music]
[39:56] fire. And in the darkest night, you're
[40:00] close like no other.
[40:05] I've known you as a father.
[40:08] I've known you as a
[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] friend and I have truly lived in the
[40:16] goodness of
[40:18] God. So I
[40:21] say all my life you have been
[40:25] faithful. Yes, my Lord. All my
[40:30] life you've been so good. With every
[40:36] breath that I am
[40:40] able, Lord, I will sing of the goodness
[40:45] of
[40:48] God. I will sing of the goodness of God.
[40:55] Well, I
[40:57] say all my life,
[41:01] Lord, you've been so faithful.
[41:06] Lord, you've been so good to
[41:11] me. With every breath that I am
[41:16] able, I will sing of the goodness of
[41:23] God. I will sing of the goodness of
[41:30] God. I
[41:32] say your goodness is running after
[41:36] running after me.
[41:40] Your goodness is running after, running
[41:44] after me. With my life laid down, I
[41:48] surrender now. I give you
[41:53] everything. Your goodness is running
[41:56] after, running after me. I know all my
[42:02] life you have been
[42:05] faithful. Yes, my Lord. All my life
[42:10] you've been so good.
[42:15] Every breath that
[42:20] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[42:27] Oh, I will
[42:29] sing of the goodness of God.
[42:33] [Music]
[42:34] Amen. How many can give him a hand clap
[42:36] of praise this evening?
[42:38] Amen. How many can testify of his
[42:40] goodness? Can testify of his mercy? You
[42:43] can testify of his grace. How many can
[42:45] testify of his faithfulness? Amen. That
[42:48] no matter no matter what came your way,
[42:51] there was a storms brewing and winds
[42:54] blowing, but God was faithful. Amen. I
[42:56] think of the scripture says that he is
[42:58] faithful. And Amen. I'm thankful tonight
[43:00] to serve a faithful God. Amen. Want to
[43:03] say God bless you all this evening. It
[43:04] is a real honor and a privilege to be in
[43:06] the house of God and and then to be home
[43:09] tonight and to be speaking to you from
[43:10] the word of the Lord and from the
[43:12] message of the hour and good to see
[43:14] everyone out on a Wednesday evening. I
[43:15] know there's no doubt many that's
[43:17] pressed over many many enemies and
[43:19] spirits to get here tonight, but you're
[43:21] here and we're in his presence and all
[43:23] things are possible. Amen. Amen. I want
[43:25] to say God bless you tonight and amen.
[43:27] It's good to see all these young folks
[43:29] up here on the front row. Amen. when I
[43:31] stepped out of the out of the back room
[43:32] there, Brother Matt, and thought it was
[43:34] a meeting. Amen. Amen. I tell you, it is
[43:36] a meeting. Amen. Amen. See all these
[43:39] chairs out and all these young people up
[43:40] here. God bless you all. And isn't it
[43:42] just an honor to see young people still
[43:44] seeking the things of God. Amen. I tell
[43:47] you, that's something we should never
[43:48] take lightly. Amen. As as young people
[43:50] seeking the things of God. Amen. Maybe
[43:53] we just bow our hearts together tonight
[43:54] for a word of prayer. Let's just bow our
[43:56] heads. Maybe you have a special need
[43:58] upon your heart tonight. something you
[44:00] would desire from the Lord. I know that
[44:02] he's able. I know that he's mindful of
[44:04] every need that's represented here
[44:06] tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your
[44:08] believers have gathered here on this
[44:10] Wednesday evening, Father, Lord, there
[44:12] was no announcement sent out. There was
[44:14] no flyers printed up. There was nothing,
[44:17] Lord, specially advertised about this
[44:20] service tonight. But Lord, here in this
[44:22] building is gathered a whole house full
[44:24] of believers, Lord, eagles, Father,
[44:26] Lord, that have pushed beyond the cares
[44:28] of life and pushed beyond the problems
[44:30] and situations of their maybe their jobs
[44:33] or their homes or whatever it may be,
[44:35] Lord. And they've come into your
[44:36] presence tonight, Father, to fulfill
[44:38] your word where you said where the
[44:40] carcass is, there the eagles will be
[44:42] gathered together, Lord. We're not just
[44:45] campground Christians, as your prophet
[44:46] said. We don't just serve you during the
[44:49] special meeting times or in the
[44:50] convention times, but Lord, we serve you
[44:53] when we're on the mountain and we serve
[44:54] you when we're in the valley, Lord,
[44:56] because your word ever remains the
[44:58] truth. And Father, as we come here
[45:00] tonight, Lord, maybe to some it would be
[45:02] just another Wednesday night. Maybe to
[45:04] some it would be just a a time away from
[45:07] something else. But Lord, to the eagles,
[45:09] as your prophet called them, the hungry
[45:11] hearted eagles. Lord, they've got to
[45:13] have that fresh kill. And Lord, this has
[45:15] come to the port of the service where
[45:17] the bread of life will be broke, where
[45:18] your word will be spoken. Father, you've
[45:20] seen every hand that was raised. Behind
[45:22] that hand, there is a need. And Lord,
[45:24] we're very confident of your scripture
[45:26] tonight that you said you sent your word
[45:28] and you healed the diseases. You sent
[45:31] your word and you delivered your
[45:32] children. Now, Lord, we're not looking
[45:34] for you to send a message, Lord. We're
[45:36] looking at the message you've already
[45:37] sent. Father, may you come in this
[45:39] meeting tonight in the power of your
[45:41] resurrection. Lord, may you drive out
[45:43] every heavy spirit, oh God. May you
[45:45] drive out every every spirit of the
[45:46] enemy that would try to hinder your
[45:48] children from receiving from your divine
[45:50] word. Lord, I pray if there be some at
[45:52] home tonight streaming unable to be
[45:54] here. Father, I pray the angel of God
[45:56] would pass by that house, Lord. Father,
[45:59] may the angel of death, may the angel of
[46:01] sickness, Lord, may the angel of disease
[46:03] be bound, oh God. And Lord, may the may
[46:06] the healing virtues of Calvary flow
[46:08] through sick bodies, Lord. Father, for
[46:10] those who would go back and hear this
[46:11] service, Lord, may something be said,
[46:14] Lord, that would be a help and an
[46:15] encouragement to them. Lord, as we turn
[46:17] into your word, anyone with physical
[46:19] strength can open this Bible, but it'll
[46:21] take you to come down with spiritual
[46:23] strength and open our understanding. Uh,
[46:25] Father, we invite you, come among us
[46:27] tonight, and we'll be sure to give thee
[46:29] all the praise, all the honor, and all
[46:31] the glory. In the wonderful name of our
[46:33] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray.
[46:36] and all the believers says, "Amen." And
[46:39] amen. God bless you tonight. If you have
[46:41] your Bibles, while you're standing with
[46:42] us, we want to invite you in the
[46:44] scripture where we're going to go uh to
[46:46] the book of Revelation chapter 1 and
[46:48] then also we're going to go to
[46:49] Philippians 1 and then St. John chapter
[46:51] 13. You love the Lord tonight. Amen. Do
[46:54] want to say we appreciate our pastor,
[46:56] brother Matt, for this opportunity to
[46:58] speak to you tonight and do want to
[47:00] bring you greetings. We were out in
[47:01] Idaho this weekend at brother Paul
[47:03] Halelet's assembly there and and pulled
[47:06] up on the parking lot Sunday morning and
[47:07] there was a sign out there and the name
[47:09] of their church was Grace Tabernacle as
[47:10] well. So, amen. They said to be sure and
[47:12] send you greetings. And he said to be
[47:14] sure and greet you, Brother Ben. Amen. I
[47:16] know brother Paul is speaking very
[47:18] highly of you, giving your greetings.
[47:20] And he said, "It's been a while since
[47:21] I've seen him." I said, "Well, you ain't
[47:22] seen him since he's become a powerful
[47:23] song leader." Amen. We sure appreciate
[47:26] Brother Ben and his gift the Lord is is
[47:28] using mightily among the church. Amen.
[47:30] Revelation chapter 1 and verse number
[47:33] eight. The Bible here says, "I am Alpha
[47:37] and Omega, the beginning and the ending,
[47:42] saith the Lord, which is and which was
[47:46] and which is to come." I love this. The
[47:50] Almighty. Brother Breman said he was the
[47:52] in between. But he chose to tell the
[47:55] church, I am the alpha and I am the
[47:58] omega. I am the beginning and the
[48:01] ending. I am that which is first, which
[48:04] was, and which is to come. Somebody say
[48:06] this with me. The Almighty. In
[48:09] Philippians chapter 1, Philippians, I
[48:12] want to look in Philippians chapter 1
[48:15] and verse number six, a very very
[48:18] familiar scripture. Philippians 1 and
[48:20] verse 6. Paul here writing, he says,
[48:24] "Being confident of this very thing,
[48:27] that he which hath begun a good work in
[48:31] you will perform it until the day of
[48:36] Jesus Christ." Now, there is no
[48:38] guessing, there is no hoping, there is
[48:40] no presuming, being confident of this
[48:43] very thing, that he which hath begun a
[48:46] good work in you will perform it until
[48:48] the day of Jesus Christ. In the book of
[48:50] St. John chapter 13, St. John uh chapter
[48:55] 13, I think it's very fitting to read
[48:58] this um in the book of St. John chapter
[49:01] 13, he opens his book of writings by
[49:04] saying, "In the beginning was the word."
[49:07] Now, in St. John chapter 13 and verse
[49:10] number three, I love how this opens up.
[49:13] Jesus knowing, isn't that powerful? Not
[49:16] guessing. Jesus knowing that the father
[49:20] had given all things into his hands and
[49:23] that he was come from God and went to
[49:26] God. Jesus knowing he had come from God
[49:30] and went to God. We ask the Lord this
[49:31] evening to have the blessing of the
[49:32] reading of his word as you can have your
[49:34] seats here this afternoon. I want to uh
[49:36] tonight by the help of the Lord if I
[49:38] would if I would take a title tonight I
[49:40] want to speak to you on this for just a
[49:42] few moments. The revelation of my alpha
[49:45] and omega. the revelation of my alpha
[49:48] and omega. And uh maybe just to share a
[49:51] little bit of inspiration here with you,
[49:52] we were actually out there last week in
[49:54] Oklahoma. Some of the Bontrager family
[49:56] was there. We were out there for brother
[49:58] Bryce's meetings there in Claremore and
[50:00] brother uh myself, brother Craig Ber and
[50:02] brother Daryl Ward were speaking there
[50:04] last week and uh brother Craig was
[50:06] speaking there on that Thursday evening.
[50:08] And while he was preaching, he was just
[50:09] preaching along and he mentioned this um
[50:11] this scripture, Revelation 1 and8. and
[50:14] he said that Jesus Christ is the alpha
[50:16] and the omega. And when he said that, he
[50:18] began to to to preach along those lines
[50:20] for just a moment and then totally
[50:22] changed gears and I just couldn't get
[50:24] out of that gear. Uh the Lord just began
[50:26] dealing with my heart and inspiring some
[50:28] things. And tonight, if it's okay, I
[50:29] just want to share a few of those with
[50:31] us tonight because you know, I believe
[50:33] if there ever was a time that we need,
[50:35] Amen. to be the full possessors of full
[50:38] assurance. Amen. And walking with full
[50:40] assurance in our heart of our position.
[50:42] I believe that now is the time. How many
[50:44] can agree that now is the time to have a
[50:47] full assurance, amen, of our position.
[50:50] And you know, Brother Brown will say it
[50:51] like this. What we need is a full
[50:53] assurance of what we're doing and moving
[50:56] forward in our position. Amen.
[50:59] Fulfilling our commission. Now, I know
[51:01] that maybe some here have been serving
[51:02] the Lord many, many years. Some have
[51:04] been serving the Lord for just a few
[51:06] years. But it's a very uh it's a very
[51:08] principled fact that every believer,
[51:10] amen, has a position in God. And every
[51:13] believer has been given a commission.
[51:16] Amen. By almighty God. Now I find it
[51:18] amazing, brother speaking of his
[51:20] position and commission. 1955 he said,
[51:22] "Now my ministry is not to personally
[51:25] contact each one. It's to bring forth
[51:28] the full assurance of the resurrection
[51:30] of the Lord Jesus and tell them, amen,
[51:33] to look and live. Amen. He was showing
[51:36] us that his commission on the earth,
[51:38] amen, was to bring forth the full
[51:40] assurance of the resurrection of the
[51:43] Lord Jesus and to tell the people, Amen,
[51:45] to look and live. Now, amen, he was a
[51:48] prophet of God, ordained of God, amen,
[51:51] to tell the people of God, amen, what to
[51:53] look at. And I find it amazing in the
[51:55] tape influence 1964, brother Bram
[51:58] speaking of Isaiah and he said in the
[52:00] temple he saw God on his throne and he
[52:03] was lifted way up high and God was going
[52:05] to show him, amen, what to look at. So
[52:08] even all the way back to Isaiah, amen,
[52:10] God had to show him what to look at. He
[52:13] said now not look at one another. Amen.
[52:16] But look up there to what he is. Amen.
[52:18] What he lifted up high. Amen. On his
[52:21] throne. I find it amazing that God was
[52:23] not telling Isaiah, amen, to look back
[52:26] at what God was. Amen. Or to look
[52:29] forward to what God would be, but rather
[52:31] he told him, Amen, you've got to look at
[52:33] what he is. And in Revelation chapter 2
[52:36] and verse one, Jesus said these things,
[52:38] amen, saith he that holdeth the seven
[52:40] stars in his right hand, who walketh in
[52:43] the midst of the seven golden
[52:44] candlesticks. He said, now this is he of
[52:47] whom it is said, Amen, that this same
[52:49] Jesus is both. Somebody say both. Both.
[52:52] Is both Lord and Christ. Amen. There he
[52:55] is, the one and only Lord God Almighty.
[52:58] And beside him, Amen. There is no other.
[53:01] There he is, the Savior. Amen. Salvation
[53:04] is of the Lord. Jonah 2:9. Amen. And
[53:07] he's walking in the midst of the
[53:08] churches throughout the seven ages. Now
[53:10] listen. What he was in the first age.
[53:13] Amen. He is in all ages. To every
[53:16] believer. How many believers have I got
[53:18] here? Amen. To every believer. He is
[53:21] Jesus Christ. Amen. The same yesterday,
[53:24] today, and forever. Amen. Amen. To every
[53:27] believer, he is Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[53:30] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[53:33] that Jesus that we're speaking of, Amen.
[53:36] is the alpha and he is the omega. He is
[53:38] the one that was. He is the one that is,
[53:41] and the one which shall be. Amen. He is
[53:44] the almighty God. And here's the
[53:45] beautiful thing about it. Amen. Is he's
[53:48] not just Abraham's God. And he's not
[53:50] just Moses's God. He's not just Jonah's
[53:52] God or Jeremiah's God. Amen. But to
[53:55] every believer that will call upon his
[53:57] name, Amen. He shall save them. Amen.
[54:00] And he will become your God. Amen. He
[54:03] will be your God personally. Amen. I
[54:05] want to tell you tonight, Amen. If God
[54:07] that I'm talking about saved you, Amen.
[54:09] He did not save you to lose you. Amen.
[54:12] If you're saved, Brother Brandham says,
[54:14] then you're saved. If God saves you
[54:16] tonight knowing he's going to lose you
[54:18] 10 years from today, then he is
[54:20] defeating his own purpose. But the
[54:22] infinite, almighty, eternal, everlasting
[54:25] wisdom. Amen. God doesn't know enough.
[54:27] Amen. To know whether you'll hold out or
[54:29] whether you won't. Amen. Then when he
[54:31] saves you, you say, "Well, I'll give him
[54:33] a try. I'll see what he do." Then he
[54:36] does not know the end from the
[54:37] beginning. Amen. But God knows what he's
[54:40] doing. Amen. Amen. I want to establish
[54:42] that tonight. Amen. that God is not
[54:45] guessing about what he's doing. He is
[54:47] not presuming about what he's doing. But
[54:49] God knows what he's doing. Amen. And
[54:52] don't you never worry about that. It's
[54:54] you and I that stumble along. Amen. But
[54:57] God knows what he's doing. I love this.
[54:59] And he knew. Amen. Whether we would hold
[55:02] out or what we would do. Amen. Before
[55:05] you was ever even born. Amen. God knew
[55:08] whether you would hold out or not. Amen.
[55:10] Before you was ever come to an altar.
[55:12] Amen. God knew whether you would hold
[55:14] out or not. Hey, I'll say what Jeremiah
[55:16] said. He said, "I know the thoughts that
[55:18] I think towards you." Amen. Sayaith who?
[55:21] Not the preacher. Amen. But sayaith the
[55:23] Lord, Amen. They are thoughts of peace
[55:26] and they are not of evil. Now listen, to
[55:28] give you an expected end. Amen. You say,
[55:31] "How can God, Amen, give me a believer
[55:34] an expected end?" Amen. Because he's the
[55:37] one who was in your beginning. Amen. And
[55:40] he predestinated, Amen. all the way from
[55:42] before the foundation of the world.
[55:45] Amen. Predestinated your ending. Amen.
[55:48] Before you ever come into your
[55:49] beginning, amen. And he knows your
[55:52] beginning. He knows the middle part and
[55:54] he knows your ending. Amen. Amen. I love
[55:57] that. In in Revelation 1:8, I I just
[56:00] want to read that from the Amplified
[56:01] Bible. In Revelation 18, it says, "I am
[56:04] the A. I am the A, Alpha, and the Omega.
[56:08] I am the beginning and the end, says the
[56:10] Lord God." Listen. Who is existing
[56:12] forever. Amen. And who was continually,
[56:15] Amen, existing in the past and who is to
[56:18] come. Amen. The Almighty, the
[56:20] omnipotent. Amen. The ruler of all.
[56:23] Amen. Amen. Your God is the omnipotent.
[56:26] He is the ruler of all. Now, in
[56:29] Revelation 1:8, Amen. I love how it says
[56:32] this. Amen. It is an expression, amen,
[56:35] of God's absolute supremacy over all
[56:38] things. Amen. Amen. It is an expression,
[56:41] amen, of God's supremacy over all
[56:44] things. Brother Bham said, he said, I am
[56:45] the alpha and the omega. He says, in
[56:48] other words, I'll be supreme in the
[56:50] first and I'll be supreme in the last.
[56:53] Hey, that ought to make you put your
[56:55] shouting shoes on. Amen. The same God
[56:57] that set your heart of dancing. Amen.
[56:59] And filled you with the Holy Ghost on
[57:01] the night you got saved. Amen. He is not
[57:03] a weak old Dodie grandpa. He is not a
[57:05] God of our imagination, but he is the
[57:08] almighty God. He is the supreme God. And
[57:11] if he was supreme when you got saved,
[57:13] he'll be supreme when you get sick. If
[57:15] he was supreme when you got saved, he'll
[57:17] be supreme when you get discouraged. He
[57:20] is not a god of our imagination. He is
[57:22] not a god of wood or stone. He is the
[57:25] almighty omnipotent. Amen. Sovereign
[57:28] God. And he rules and he reigns over
[57:30] everything. Amen. I am the alpha and the
[57:33] omega. I am the first. I am the last. He
[57:36] said, "Now, now not the announcement of
[57:38] the second party or the third party, but
[57:41] the only party." Well, glory to God. It
[57:44] was not the announcement of a second
[57:46] party. Amen. Or a third party, but it
[57:48] was the only party. Amen. Let me say
[57:51] this. You didn't show up late to the
[57:52] party. Amen. What he was in the
[57:54] beginning for Moses. Amen. He's right
[57:56] here tonight for Carter. What he was to
[57:58] Jeremiah, he is to Matt. What he was to
[58:01] Jonah, he is to every believer here
[58:04] tonight. Amen. What he was to David,
[58:06] amen, he is to Kobe. Amen. What he was
[58:08] to Rebecca, Amen, he is to destiny. What
[58:11] he was in the beginning is what he is in
[58:14] the middle and is what he'll be in the
[58:15] end. Because he is the almighty God. He
[58:19] is the alpha and the omega. He said
[58:22] before I show you anything, Amen. I want
[58:24] to let you know, Amen. who I am.
[58:28] Hey, he said the greatest of all the
[58:30] revelations is the deity. Amen. the
[58:33] supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[58:37] He said, "You can't even get to first
[58:39] base until you believe that." Amen.
[58:41] That's why Peter said, "Repent and be
[58:44] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[58:46] the remission of your sin." And then
[58:48] you're ready to go in the spirit. Amen.
[58:50] The first thing you have to know, Amen,
[58:53] is the deity of Christ. Amen. The first
[58:56] thing you have to know, Amen, is the
[58:58] deity of Christ. I love that, Brother
[59:00] David. I don't have to know all the
[59:02] books of the Bible. I don't have to
[59:04] know, amen, all the titles of all the
[59:06] tapes. But the first thing I've got to
[59:08] know, amen, is the supreme deity of my
[59:12] Lord and my Savior and his name is the
[59:14] Lord Jesus Christ. I remember when I was
[59:16] in high school, I I had a teacher and
[59:19] you know, she was trying to kind of
[59:20] embarrass me one day. Amen. Because I
[59:22] was claiming as such a young man to be a
[59:24] preacher and she she kind of said to me,
[59:26] she said, "Amen. What's all the books of
[59:28] the Bible?" you know, and I just started
[59:29] listing a bunch of them off and I
[59:31] scattered all over the place. And about
[59:33] halfway through, she went, "Oh, that's
[59:34] just embarrassing." I said,
[59:35] "Embarrassing?" She said, "Claiming to
[59:37] be a preacher and can't even
[59:39] chronologically list, amen, all the
[59:41] books of the Bible." I said, "Ma'am, I
[59:43] just listed them all." Amen. She said,
[59:45] "I want them chronologically and I want
[59:46] the key theme of them." I said, "Listen,
[59:48] I don't know all the education of the
[59:50] Bible, but I know there's the books of
[59:52] the Bible, and I know what they are, but
[59:54] above that, I know the author." Amen.
[59:56] The one who wrote it. Amen. And power
[59:58] does not come into your life by the
[1:00:00] ability to memorize. Amen. 66 books of
[1:00:04] the Bible. Power does not come into your
[1:00:06] life by the ability to memorize all the
[1:00:08] quotes. But power comes into your life
[1:00:10] when revelation begins to be imparted by
[1:00:13] the quickening of the Holy Ghost. There
[1:00:15] ain't a devil big enough. There ain't a
[1:00:17] devil bad enough. There ain't a demon
[1:00:18] strong enough that can whip. Amen. A son
[1:00:21] and a daughter of God who has a
[1:00:23] revelation of the Almighty, Alpha and
[1:00:26] Omega. Yes sir. I am A to Z. There's no
[1:00:30] more but me. Amen. I was at the
[1:00:32] beginning so I'll be at the end. He said
[1:00:35] now be careful John. Amen. You have
[1:00:37] entered into the spirit and something is
[1:00:40] going to be revealed to you. What is it?
[1:00:43] A trumpet sound. And the first thing
[1:00:46] that come out was I am alpha and omega.
[1:00:50] I am the first of all revelations. He
[1:00:53] said alpha and omega. That's the first
[1:00:55] thing that he let him know who he was.
[1:00:58] Who's this approaching? Is this King
[1:01:00] Jesus? Is this King God? Is this King
[1:01:03] Holy Ghost? He said, "I'm all of it. I'm
[1:01:07] from A to Z. I'm the beginning and the
[1:01:09] ending. I'm the immortal eternal one.
[1:01:12] Amen. I was before there was a first and
[1:01:15] after there's no more last. I will still
[1:01:18] be there. I was there before there was a
[1:01:21] first. I'll be there when there is no
[1:01:23] more last. Amen. Just listen to those
[1:01:25] words again. He said, "I am alpha and
[1:01:28] omega." Amen. This is deity. This is not
[1:01:31] simply a prophet or a man. This is God.
[1:01:36] And this is not a revelation of three
[1:01:39] gods. Amen. But one God, the Almighty.
[1:01:42] Ever since these people have failed,
[1:01:44] Amen. to realize that there is just one
[1:01:47] God with three offices or manifestation.
[1:01:50] He said they know there is one God
[1:01:53] according to scripture but they try to
[1:01:55] make it to the fantastic theory. Amen.
[1:01:57] That God is like a bunch of grapes.
[1:01:59] Amen. Three persons with the same
[1:02:01] divinity. Amen. Shared equally by all.
[1:02:04] He said but it plainly says in
[1:02:07] revelation that Jesus is that which is
[1:02:10] that which was and that which is to
[1:02:12] come. He is the alpha. He is the omega
[1:02:16] which means he is the A to the Z or the
[1:02:19] all of it. He is everything. He is the
[1:02:22] almighty. Now you all know one of the
[1:02:25] most one of the most uh uh controversial
[1:02:27] doctrines in the Bible. Amen. Is the
[1:02:29] doctrine on the Godhead?
[1:02:31] Right? Amen. Is there one God, two gods,
[1:02:34] three gods? Is Jesus God or spirit God?
[1:02:37] But look here. Amen. I can say this but
[1:02:39] the controversy. Amen. It wasn't so from
[1:02:42] the beginning. Amen. Because God is the
[1:02:45] beginning and he was in the beginning.
[1:02:47] Right? In 1 Timothy 3:16, Paul says,
[1:02:50] "Without controversy." Amen. Great is
[1:02:53] the mystery of godliness. Amen. For God
[1:02:56] was manifested in the flesh. He was
[1:02:59] justified in the spirit. He was seen of
[1:03:01] angels. He was preached under the
[1:03:02] Gentiles. He was believed on in the
[1:03:04] world. And he was received up into
[1:03:07] glory. Now, when Brother Brand begins to
[1:03:09] preach this one place, he'll actually
[1:03:11] exchange, Amen. the word controversy for
[1:03:14] the word argument. And he'll say like
[1:03:16] this, without argument, amen, great is
[1:03:19] the mystery of godliness. Now watch, for
[1:03:22] God, amen, was manifested in the flesh.
[1:03:25] He said today when they try to break up
[1:03:27] God and make him something that he
[1:03:29] isn't. I tell you, that's one of the
[1:03:31] biggest curses on the Christian church
[1:03:34] today. Oh, he was a good man. He was a
[1:03:36] philosopher. He said he was Emmanuel. He
[1:03:39] was Jehovah anointed. Amen. walking here
[1:03:43] on earth. Amen. And living among us. He
[1:03:46] reads 1 Timothy 3:16. He said, "So now
[1:03:49] Jesus was God's manifestation of his own
[1:03:52] being on earth." Amen. That's why he
[1:03:55] could say, "When you see me, you've seen
[1:03:57] the father." Because Jesus was the
[1:04:00] manifestation of God on the earth. He
[1:04:03] sent in a human being to take away sin
[1:04:06] and make a way for sickness to be
[1:04:08] healed. He said, "Now in the name of
[1:04:10] Jesus Christ, the son of God, I take
[1:04:13] every spirit in here under my control
[1:04:16] for the glory of God. And may the Lord
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ who is my full guide that
[1:04:21] my life is now surrendered to him."
[1:04:24] Amen. As an empty channel that he speaks
[1:04:26] through, may he have control in my life
[1:04:29] that his spirit may control everything
[1:04:31] that's in here and cast out every evil
[1:04:34] spirit and heal every sick person that's
[1:04:37] in the building. Amen. What was
[1:04:39] happening? Amen. God, amen, was
[1:04:42] manifested in the flesh. How many knows,
[1:04:44] brother Brandham said, when God is truly
[1:04:47] revealed, he is made manifest in the
[1:04:50] flesh.
[1:04:52] Brother said that when God is truly
[1:04:53] revealed, he is made manifest in the
[1:04:56] flesh. Now, he goes to St. Markap 11 and
[1:04:58] he said, now remember what he said. He
[1:05:01] said, have faith in God. Amen. For
[1:05:03] verily I say unto you, if ye, not if I,
[1:05:06] but if you whosoever, Amen, will say to
[1:05:09] this mountain, Amen, be moved, and don't
[1:05:11] doubt, but believe what they said will
[1:05:13] come to pass. Amen. You can have, Amen,
[1:05:16] what you said. He said, now see, that's
[1:05:19] God in you. Amen. And who could move a
[1:05:23] mountain but God. Who could bring the
[1:05:25] things to pass like that? Amen. But God.
[1:05:28] He said, "So you see beyond any
[1:05:32] controversy, amen, that God is in his
[1:05:35] people." Amen. Without argument tonight,
[1:05:38] I can stand upon the supreme deity. The
[1:05:41] revelation that God, Amen, is in his
[1:05:44] people. He said God came in a human
[1:05:46] form. He said that didn't make him
[1:05:49] another God. Amen. He was God. He was
[1:05:52] the same God. It was a revelation then
[1:05:55] and it's a revelation now. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:58] Pretty clear, isn't it? He said, "So
[1:06:00] there's no chance of controversy there."
[1:06:03] Amen. The Lord which was, which is, and
[1:06:07] shall come, he is the Almighty. I want
[1:06:10] to make an announcement to you tonight,
[1:06:11] Grace Tabernacle, that Jesus Christ is
[1:06:14] none other, amen, than the Alpha and the
[1:06:18] Omega. But I want to make it personal
[1:06:20] tonight. Amen. I want to say this to
[1:06:22] you. He is not just David's alpha and
[1:06:25] omega. He is not just brother Brandham's
[1:06:27] alpha and omega, but he is my alpha and
[1:06:30] he is my omega. And I'll say this, he
[1:06:33] must be your alpha and he must be your
[1:06:37] omega. He said Jesus is walking alone in
[1:06:40] the midst of his church. He said there
[1:06:42] is no one else with him and neither
[1:06:44] indeed can there be for he alone wrought
[1:06:48] her salvation and he purchased her
[1:06:50] speaking of you with his own blood. He
[1:06:52] owns her. He is her Lord and her master.
[1:06:55] You know there's no pope with him. Do
[1:06:58] you know there's no archbishop beside
[1:07:00] him? Do you know that he don't even look
[1:07:02] at Mary? Amen. And ask her what he
[1:07:04] should do. Amen. He don't look to the
[1:07:06] father. Amen. Because he is the father.
[1:07:08] He does not turn to give orders to a
[1:07:10] holy spirit. Amen. For he is God eternal
[1:07:13] spirit. And it is his life. Amen. That
[1:07:16] is flowing and pulsating in the church
[1:07:19] and it's giving her life. Amen. Without
[1:07:21] him there would be no life. Amen. So
[1:07:24] salvation is of the Lord. I love what he
[1:07:27] says. There was no one with him. When he
[1:07:30] dropped the fierceness of the wrath of
[1:07:32] the fiery furnace, it was not another
[1:07:34] but him who hung up on the cross and
[1:07:37] gave his blood. And he is the author and
[1:07:40] the finisher of our faith. And he is the
[1:07:42] alpha and the omega of our salvation. We
[1:07:46] are a spouse to him. We do not belong to
[1:07:49] the church. We belong to him and his
[1:07:51] word is law. Amen. Creeds and dogmas and
[1:07:54] bylaws and constitutions have no effect
[1:07:58] on us because it is Jesus alone. Amen.
[1:08:01] Who walks in the midst of the churches.
[1:08:03] It is God in her. Amen. Willing and
[1:08:06] doing of his own good pleasure. And
[1:08:08] don't you never forget that you have
[1:08:11] only one relationship to God. And God
[1:08:14] has only one relationship to you and
[1:08:17] that is Jesus. And he says, "Jesus
[1:08:20] alone. Hey, hey, it was Jesus that saved
[1:08:23] me. It was Jesus that gave me the Holy
[1:08:25] Ghost. It was Jesus that filled me with
[1:08:27] the power of God. It was Jesus that sent
[1:08:30] me this message." Amen. It is Jesus.
[1:08:34] And it is Jesus alone. Now, Amen. I'll
[1:08:36] just get this out there because because
[1:08:38] many people, Amen, they view this
[1:08:40] mighty, powerful, eternal, omnipotent,
[1:08:44] amen, infinite God. Amen. As a very
[1:08:46] impersonal God. Amen. But I want to
[1:08:48] establish something to you. Amen. Our
[1:08:51] God is a personal God. Our God is a
[1:08:56] personal God. In Revelation 3:14, he
[1:08:59] said these things sayaith the amen.
[1:09:01] Amen. The faithful and the true witness.
[1:09:03] Amen. I love that word faithful. It is
[1:09:06] of persons who show themselves faithful
[1:09:09] in the transaction of business, the
[1:09:11] execution of commands, or the discharge,
[1:09:14] amen, of official duties. Amen. receive
[1:09:17] these things saith the faithful.
[1:09:18] Rebraham said you know we often talk
[1:09:20] about a great unchanging God. Amen. You
[1:09:23] know we often talk about Amen. whose
[1:09:25] words does not change and when we speak
[1:09:28] of him after that manner we often get a
[1:09:31] view of him that makes him seem very
[1:09:34] impersonal. It is though God made the
[1:09:36] whole universe and all the laws that
[1:09:39] pertain to it and then he stood back and
[1:09:42] he became a great and personal God. He
[1:09:45] said, "It is though God made a way of
[1:09:47] salvation for lost mankind. That way
[1:09:50] being the cross and then when the death
[1:09:52] of Christ have atoned for our sins and
[1:09:54] his resurrection gave us an open door to
[1:09:57] him, brother Noah, then God just folded
[1:09:59] his arms and stood back." It is if we
[1:10:02] have major in the believing in a great
[1:10:04] creator who having created but then lost
[1:10:08] his personal interest in his creation.
[1:10:11] He said, "Now I say that is how many
[1:10:13] people are apt to think, but that is
[1:10:16] wrong thinking. Let let the prophet
[1:10:18] change your thinking tonight. That is
[1:10:20] wrong thinking." Amen. For God is
[1:10:23] governing in the affairs of men. Amen.
[1:10:26] Right now, he is both the creator and he
[1:10:29] is the sustainer. Listen, he did not
[1:10:32] save you, amen, to lose you. He did not
[1:10:35] build his home in you to move away. He
[1:10:38] did not teach you to swim, to let you
[1:10:40] drown. A but what my God began, my God
[1:10:43] is going to finish. Amen. If he pulled
[1:10:45] you from sin, he's going to put you in
[1:10:47] the rapture. If he pulled you from
[1:10:49] unbelief, he's going to put you into
[1:10:51] faith. If he called you, amen, from the
[1:10:53] confusion of religion, he's going to
[1:10:55] reveal to you the authority of his word.
[1:10:58] My God is the alpha.
[1:11:02] He is the alpha and he is the omega. I
[1:11:05] love what Paul says. He said, "By him
[1:11:08] were all things created that are in
[1:11:10] heaven and that are in earth, both
[1:11:13] visible, invisible, whether they be
[1:11:15] thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:11:17] or powers." Amen. All things were
[1:11:20] created by him and for him. And he is
[1:11:24] before all things. Somebody say before.
[1:11:27] And by him all things consist. Brother
[1:11:30] Ram said, "Let it be anything it might
[1:11:32] be. There is no other being." Yeah,
[1:11:36] brother, sister. Amen. He is before all
[1:11:38] things and by him all things consist
[1:11:41] whether it be father, son, holy ghost,
[1:11:44] whatever it is, he is before all things
[1:11:46] that's in heaven, in earth, visible or
[1:11:49] anything. This son of God was before all
[1:11:52] things. Is that right? Can we answer
[1:11:56] that? Is that right? He said, "I don't
[1:11:58] care if it's thrones, if it's dominions,
[1:12:01] whatever it is, heavenly thrones,
[1:12:03] kingdoms, whatever it might be in the
[1:12:06] great supernatural realms beyond in the
[1:12:08] eternities where it was, whatever it
[1:12:11] was, angels, gods, whatever it was, he
[1:12:14] is before all things." He said, "There
[1:12:17] is nothing can make it run but him. He
[1:12:21] is the head of the body, which is the
[1:12:23] church, who is the beginning. He is the
[1:12:27] head of the church, which is the body
[1:12:30] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[1:12:32] the dead, that in all things he might
[1:12:35] have the preeminence. Listen, he didn't
[1:12:37] show up late and steal his position in
[1:12:41] his church. He was before there was a
[1:12:43] church. He was before there was a pope.
[1:12:45] He was before there was a prophet. He
[1:12:48] was before there was an angel because
[1:12:50] he's God and he's the alpha
[1:12:53] and he's the omega. Our God is not a
[1:12:56] trespasser, folks. He's a sovereign God
[1:12:59] and he's the living God. And whatever he
[1:13:02] decides to claim as his own, he's got
[1:13:04] rights to it. And there ain't no devil
[1:13:06] can tell him he can't have what he
[1:13:08] wants. If he wants your soul, he's going
[1:13:11] to get it. If he wants your feet, he's
[1:13:13] going to get them. If he wants your
[1:13:15] hands, he's going to get them. If he
[1:13:17] wants this church, he can have it.
[1:13:19] Because he was before Grace Tabernacle.
[1:13:22] He was before Matt Morris. He was before
[1:13:24] Andrew Bber. He was before any of us.
[1:13:27] And when the dust settles and the smoke
[1:13:29] clears, he'll still be the alpha and the
[1:13:32] omega because he was supreme in the
[1:13:35] beginning and he'll be supreme. Amen.
[1:13:38] He'll be supreme in the end. Might have
[1:13:44] preeminence. Oh my. Amen. The alpha and
[1:13:49] the omega has come into the church. He
[1:13:52] said that he might be the firstborn from
[1:13:55] the dead. Now I love this. He said, "Now
[1:13:58] see that is raise up what he come to
[1:14:01] redeem."
[1:14:02] Oh God. So God did not take claim of you
[1:14:07] the day you went to the altar. But he
[1:14:10] claimed you Yes, sir. From before the
[1:14:13] foundation of the world. He said, "Now
[1:14:15] that he might have preeminence." You
[1:14:17] know what that means? That's over all.
[1:14:20] See, he is over all things that was ever
[1:14:23] created.
[1:14:26] Every angel, every being, everything
[1:14:29] that there is, he is over all things.
[1:14:32] Now, what creature is this? Who can it
[1:14:34] be? He's over all things. Can we say
[1:14:38] that together? He's over all things.
[1:14:42] There is nothing in the past, brother
[1:14:44] Ed. There is nothing in the present and
[1:14:46] there's nothing in the future that our
[1:14:49] God is not over because he is over all
[1:14:52] things. Let me say this more than
[1:14:54] anything. What we need is a revelation
[1:14:58] that he is the alpha and the omega and
[1:15:01] he is the beginning and he is the end
[1:15:04] and he is over all things. If that
[1:15:07] revelation ever drops into your soul
[1:15:10] that your God is over the devil in front
[1:15:12] of you, it'll release an anointing upon
[1:15:15] you to take the sword of the word and
[1:15:18] claim your rights as a child of God.
[1:15:21] Amen. Can I just tell you what the
[1:15:22] prophet said? He said, "It is the
[1:15:24] revelation of God that will give you
[1:15:27] authority over the devil." He can see
[1:15:30] why they would take or add would be
[1:15:32] cursed. Amen. For who can add or take
[1:15:34] away from the perfect revelation of God
[1:15:37] and overcome the enemy? It is that
[1:15:39] simple. There is nothing, somebody say
[1:15:42] nothing, of such prevailing power as the
[1:15:45] revelation of the word. There is nothing
[1:15:50] of such prevailing power as the
[1:15:53] revelation of the word. Oh, how we need
[1:15:56] revelation by the spirit. We don't need
[1:15:59] a new Bible. We don't need a new
[1:16:00] translation. Though some are very good.
[1:16:03] I'm not against them. But we need the
[1:16:06] revelation of the spirit. And thank God
[1:16:09] we can have what we need. For God wants
[1:16:12] to reveal his word to us by his spirit.
[1:16:17] Again, he says, "May God," Amen. begin
[1:16:19] by his spirit to give continuous
[1:16:22] lifegiving and prevailing revelation. I
[1:16:25] want to say this to you. Amen. There's
[1:16:27] only one thing that'll give you
[1:16:29] authority over the devil. And that is
[1:16:32] the revelation of the word of God.
[1:16:36] And it does not come from a man. It does
[1:16:39] not come from a bishop. It does not come
[1:16:42] from a message preacher. It comes from
[1:16:44] the spirit. Now I want to say this as
[1:16:47] you begin to look at things. Amen. You
[1:16:49] got to realize that there is a vast
[1:16:51] difference. Amen. In what a man does and
[1:16:54] what God does. The prophet of God said
[1:16:57] you see what man can do and then you see
[1:16:59] what God does. He said, "What a man does
[1:17:01] is failing." Somebody say that. What a
[1:17:04] man does is failing and will fail and
[1:17:08] has failed and always will fail, but
[1:17:11] what God does is eternal and it must
[1:17:14] forever remain. He said, "See that I
[1:17:18] mentioned it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:20] give us revelation or we will fail to
[1:17:23] get it." So if a man tries to give you
[1:17:26] revelation, you will fail to tap into
[1:17:29] the prevailing power that that
[1:17:31] revelation is intended to give you. But
[1:17:34] if the spirit of God ever comes into the
[1:17:36] church of God and he becomes the
[1:17:38] preacher and he becomes the teacher,
[1:17:41] then he will begin to bring to you the
[1:17:43] things, amen, that God has ordained for
[1:17:46] you to have
[1:17:48] in the age you're living in. Now, I I
[1:17:52] know I know I know sometimes we get real
[1:17:54] happy about about the revelation of the
[1:17:56] seals and thank God for it, right? We
[1:17:58] get real happy about the revelation of
[1:18:00] the serpent seed and and the godhead and
[1:18:02] and all those things and praise God for
[1:18:04] it. But let me say this to you. What
[1:18:06] sometimes what we need to do is get a
[1:18:09] revelation of what God is doing in our
[1:18:11] lives.
[1:18:15] Because the revelation is that it's God
[1:18:18] doing it.
[1:18:21] Sometimes we need to get a revelation of
[1:18:24] what God is doing in our own lives
[1:18:27] because the revelation is that it's God
[1:18:30] doing it.
[1:18:33] Y'all ever heard that song? Everything
[1:18:35] that happened to me that was good, God
[1:18:37] did it. Y'all ever heard that? Amen.
[1:18:39] It's an old song. Everything that
[1:18:41] happened to me that was good, God did
[1:18:42] it. Amen. Do do you see? Amen. Because
[1:18:46] what's happening here is remember that a
[1:18:48] rock in the Bible, amen, represents a
[1:18:51] revelation. So our foundation, amen, it
[1:18:54] must be a revelation. Look what David
[1:18:57] says in Psalms 118:21. He says, "I will
[1:19:00] praise thee for thou has heard me and
[1:19:03] art become my salvation. The stone which
[1:19:07] the builders refused, listen, is become
[1:19:10] the headstone of the corner." Now look
[1:19:13] what he says in verse 23. This is the
[1:19:16] Lord's doing.
[1:19:20] This is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:19:23] marvelous in our eyes. Brother said,
[1:19:26] "See, if there's anything in us that
[1:19:28] would keep us from believing the true
[1:19:30] word and knowing the revelation of
[1:19:33] Christ, as he said to Peter, upon this
[1:19:36] rock, I will build my church. If there's
[1:19:39] anything contrary to that, then take it
[1:19:42] away from us, Lord. We lay it aside
[1:19:44] ourselves and we cast it out. Look, we
[1:19:47] got to cast it out. He said, "And accept
[1:19:50] in its place the chief cornerstone."
[1:19:53] That's the Holy Spirit. That's the
[1:19:56] foundation of the real church of God.
[1:19:59] Oh, mercy. The foundation of the real
[1:20:03] church of God. Amen. is the revelation
[1:20:06] of the supreme deity of almighty God.
[1:20:10] Listen, we're not built on the education
[1:20:12] of our pastor. We're not built on the
[1:20:15] abilities of the evangelist or built
[1:20:17] upon the ideas of some preacher. We are
[1:20:20] built upon the foundation stone that
[1:20:23] Jesus Christ is the son of God. He was
[1:20:26] God in the beginning. He's God in the
[1:20:28] middle and he's God in the end. Amen.
[1:20:32] Now, God has called every one of us to
[1:20:35] be his witnesses. Let me say this to
[1:20:38] you. A God called witness, amen, must
[1:20:41] have an experience. But said, the true
[1:20:44] word comes to the true prophet and he
[1:20:46] tells you the true word. Now listen, and
[1:20:48] you follow that true word and then you
[1:20:51] get a true experience, amen, of the
[1:20:54] word. Now, I'll say this to you,
[1:20:56] brothers. Ask a question. Do your
[1:20:58] children have to have an experience,
[1:21:00] amen, to have the Holy Spirit? Even if
[1:21:02] they see the end time message, do they
[1:21:05] have the Holy Spirit? He says, "Everyone
[1:21:08] must have an experience." Now, come on.
[1:21:12] From the youngest to the oldest,
[1:21:14] everyone must have an experience. He
[1:21:17] said, "Listen, your children cannot go
[1:21:19] in on no other way but the same way you
[1:21:22] do." See, you must have an experience
[1:21:26] with God to go in. Brother said this,
[1:21:29] you must have an experience with God to
[1:21:32] go in. Can I say this to you? Every
[1:21:35] experience, it has an alpha and it has
[1:21:38] an omega. And whoever is the alpha and
[1:21:42] the omega of your experience is also the
[1:21:45] sustainer of that experience. Amen. Let
[1:21:48] me say this. Amen. You have to be able
[1:21:50] to go to your alpha and your omega.
[1:21:54] Amen. To receive support, amen, to
[1:21:56] sustain the experience that you receive.
[1:21:59] I want to say this as plain as I know
[1:22:01] how. If a man starts you, a man's got to
[1:22:04] keep you going.
[1:22:06] If a man starts you, a man's got to keep
[1:22:09] you going. And don't get mad at me. That
[1:22:11] man's got a right to finish you at any
[1:22:14] time he wants to. But if God starts you,
[1:22:17] then God will support you and he'll give
[1:22:19] you divine support. Amen. To bring you
[1:22:22] to the expected end that he had in his
[1:22:25] mind from before the foundation of the
[1:22:27] world. Reme the Lord have planted. I
[1:22:30] will water it day and night. He said,
[1:22:32] "Look at the criticism. No denomination
[1:22:34] can back it up. No church is like it
[1:22:36] around the country. No Pentecost in the
[1:22:38] country. Nothing else to sustain it.
[1:22:41] Everybody against the water baptism.
[1:22:43] Even to my own family." Amen. My daddy
[1:22:45] turned me away from the door. I got my
[1:22:47] clothes in a little paper sack and went
[1:22:50] live in New Albany. Amen. But listen,
[1:22:52] the reason he kept on going. Amen.
[1:22:55] Because God was his alpha and his omega.
[1:22:59] Amen. God was his revelation. God was
[1:23:02] his sustainer. God was his creator.
[1:23:04] Amen. God was the author and the
[1:23:06] finisher of his faith. It was God that
[1:23:08] was giving him the visions. It was God
[1:23:10] that giving him the dreams. It was God
[1:23:13] that was revealing the word. It was God
[1:23:15] that was stopping storms. It was God
[1:23:17] that was healing cancer because he had
[1:23:19] received the supreme revelation of the
[1:23:23] deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:27] Hallelujah. I love what he says in
[1:23:29] Isaiah 41:10. He said, "Fear thou not,
[1:23:32] for I am with thee, and be not dismayed,
[1:23:35] for I am thy God, and I will strengthen
[1:23:39] thee."
[1:23:42] Now
[1:23:43] either either we believe it or we don't.
[1:23:47] For I am with thee. I am thy God. I will
[1:23:52] strengthen thee. I will help thee. I
[1:23:56] will uphold thee with the right hand of
[1:23:59] my righteousness. Amen. Amen. Can I say
[1:24:02] something to you? Amen. Sometimes as
[1:24:04] elders, they begin to think maybe that
[1:24:06] you become illrelevant around the church
[1:24:08] and you're not that important and and
[1:24:10] your day is gone and you can't do
[1:24:12] nothing else. I rebuke that devil. I
[1:24:15] rebuke that devil. If God still got you
[1:24:17] in this church, I don't care if you're
[1:24:19] 50 years old or 90 years old. He's got
[1:24:22] you here for a purpose because he is
[1:24:25] your alpha
[1:24:27] and he is your omega. Look what Isaiah
[1:24:30] said in Isaiah 46:4. He said, "And even
[1:24:33] to your old age, I am he. And even to
[1:24:38] the hairs will I carry you? I have
[1:24:41] made and I will bear. Even I will carry
[1:24:45] and will deliver you." Oh my. Who is he
[1:24:50] talking about, church? He's talking
[1:24:52] about God. He's talking about the alpha
[1:24:55] and the omega. He's talking about the
[1:24:58] beginning. He's talking about the in
[1:25:00] between. and he's talking about your
[1:25:03] end. Let me say this. In Acts 17, y'all
[1:25:06] remember, Amen, that Paul goes up there
[1:25:08] and he's speaking at Mars Hill. Remember
[1:25:10] that? And he goes up there and the Bible
[1:25:12] said he told them that they were very
[1:25:14] superstitious. Amen. Concerning this
[1:25:16] unknown God. He said, "When I passed by,
[1:25:19] I beheld your devotions and I found an
[1:25:21] altar with this inscription to the
[1:25:22] unknown God whom therefore you
[1:25:24] ignorantly worship. But him, Amen,
[1:25:27] declare I unto you." He said, "Now they
[1:25:29] knowed he was there, but yet they did
[1:25:32] not know him. They knowed he was there,
[1:25:35] but they did not know him."
[1:25:38] My brother brother brother Matt, they
[1:25:40] knew he was there, but they had no
[1:25:43] revelation to identify him. So they just
[1:25:46] built an altar and they said to the to
[1:25:49] the to the unknown God. But Paul come by
[1:25:52] and he be to preach to them. But he did
[1:25:54] not do it because he had an education.
[1:25:56] He did not do it because he had this
[1:25:58] religious understanding. He did it
[1:26:01] because he had received a revelation.
[1:26:05] And he said these words, "They that
[1:26:06] should seek the Lord, if happily they
[1:26:09] might fill after him and find him,
[1:26:12] though he be not far from every one of
[1:26:15] us." Listen what he says. For in him,
[1:26:18] Amen. Amen. Look where Paul goes. He
[1:26:20] says, "For in him, Amen, we live and we
[1:26:24] move and have our being." Amen. In him
[1:26:28] we live, we move and have our being as
[1:26:32] certain also of your own poets have
[1:26:34] said, "For we also are his offspring." I
[1:26:39] love what Paul comes in Colossians 3:17
[1:26:42] and says, "Whatsoever you do in word or
[1:26:44] deed, you do it all."
[1:26:48] Amen. You do it all in the name of the
[1:26:53] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the
[1:26:56] Father by him. He said, "There's many
[1:26:58] fine women in the world tonight, but
[1:27:00] there's one, Mrs. William Brandom, the
[1:27:03] one that goes with me." He said, "And
[1:27:05] there's one church, amen, that lives in
[1:27:08] the name of Jesus." He said, "Can you
[1:27:10] smoke a cigarette in the name of Jesus?
[1:27:13] Can you tell a lie in the name of Jesus?
[1:27:16] Can you steal in the name of Jesus?
[1:27:18] Could you turn away from God's truth in
[1:27:20] the name of Jesus? He said certainly
[1:27:22] not. So whatsoever we do in word and
[1:27:26] deed, let's do it all in the name of
[1:27:30] Jesus. He said we come in the name of
[1:27:33] the Lord Jesus knowing that we could not
[1:27:36] come and saying now Father here is
[1:27:39] William Random or Orman Neville or
[1:27:41] whoever we might be. We would be turned
[1:27:43] down quickly. But we have the assurance
[1:27:46] that he said if you ask the father
[1:27:49] anything in my name, it'll be granted.
[1:27:52] So I don't guess I could get it using my
[1:27:56] name, anything from him. But I know, oh
[1:27:59] God, I'm guessing trying to get
[1:28:02] something from God in any other name
[1:28:04] outside of the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:28:07] But I know that when I use his son's
[1:28:10] name, then I get my petition. For it's
[1:28:13] in him that I trust. It's in him that we
[1:28:16] live and have our being. Amen. Watch
[1:28:21] this. And we're grateful this morning,
[1:28:23] God, for all that he means to us.
[1:28:28] Now, sir, can can I read the rest of
[1:28:31] that?
[1:28:33] And that's our complete life. Yes, sir.
[1:28:37] Amen. Come on, church. Our complete
[1:28:41] life.
[1:28:43] is in him.
[1:28:46] Brother said, "See, when we take on the
[1:28:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in water
[1:28:52] baptism, Paul said this, what? Know ye
[1:28:56] not that your body is the temple of the
[1:28:58] Holy Ghost which is in you?" Listen,
[1:29:02] which you have of God, and ye are not
[1:29:06] your own.
[1:29:07] You say, "I do my own thing." No, you
[1:29:09] really don't. You say, "Well, I'm my own
[1:29:11] person." No, you're really not. Because
[1:29:14] Paul goes on to say in 2 Corinthians
[1:29:16] 13:15, "Examine yourselves whether you
[1:29:19] be in the faith and prove yourselves,
[1:29:22] and know ye not your own selves how that
[1:29:26] Jesus Christ is in you, except you be
[1:29:30] reprobate."
[1:29:33] Now, Brother B brings it on down. He
[1:29:35] says, "Now the church, we say the
[1:29:37] church, the great mighty church, she did
[1:29:39] this and she did that and she's weighed
[1:29:42] the storms. We picked up in population.
[1:29:44] We're great in numbers. We're a mighty
[1:29:46] church. She's a great thing." He said,
[1:29:48] "But did you notice God never said
[1:29:51] anything about her?" All right. Come on.
[1:29:54] He never said anything about she.
[1:29:56] Everybody okay? He said him. See him is
[1:30:00] the meeting place. The lamb, not the
[1:30:03] church. He didn't put her name anywhere,
[1:30:06] but he put his name in him. That's why
[1:30:09] all we must do in word or deed do it all
[1:30:12] in the name of Jesus. If we petition, we
[1:30:15] got to ask it in the name of Jesus. If
[1:30:18] we walk, we got to walk in the name of
[1:30:20] Jesus. If we talk, we got to talk in the
[1:30:23] name of Jesus. If we baptize, we got to
[1:30:25] baptize in the name of Jesus. for all
[1:30:29] that we do,
[1:30:32] we do in the name of Jesus. Now, I'll
[1:30:36] just say this. God is obligated to his
[1:30:38] name.
[1:30:40] And he is obligated to his name because
[1:30:43] his name is in his word. Can I say this
[1:30:47] to you? And God is under obligation,
[1:30:50] amen, to his word. He said when you obey
[1:30:54] God's word, he said God's under
[1:30:56] obligation to answer you if you believe
[1:30:59] him. See, it lays in you. Amen. What is
[1:31:04] laying in you, I'll tell you what's
[1:31:06] laying in you is the revelation of the
[1:31:09] supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:12] And when you speak the name of your
[1:31:15] alpha and your omega, every demon in
[1:31:18] hell has to back up. and her spirit has
[1:31:21] to step aside because you're not coming
[1:31:25] in the name of the church. You're not
[1:31:27] coming in the name of the preacher.
[1:31:29] You're coming in the name of almighty
[1:31:32] God who was before the sin who will be
[1:31:35] after the sin.
[1:31:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because God,
[1:31:40] Amen, is worth no more than his word.
[1:31:45] Yes, sir. God is worth no more than his
[1:31:49] word.
[1:31:51] Now, come on, folks. God is worth no
[1:31:55] more
[1:31:57] than his word. Can I say something to
[1:31:59] you? And God called you to believe his
[1:32:03] word.
[1:32:05] And he is worth no, that's a direct
[1:32:08] quote. He is worth no more than his
[1:32:11] word. I love what Romans 8:28 says. It
[1:32:14] says, "And we know." Look here. Amen.
[1:32:16] Not we guess.
[1:32:19] Come on. Amen. Know this of assurityity.
[1:32:22] Amen. Know this. Amen. Knowing Jesus
[1:32:25] knowing.
[1:32:26] Come on, church. Jesus knowing he had
[1:32:29] come from God. Amen. Paul knowing who
[1:32:32] the unknown God was. And here Paul says,
[1:32:35] "And we know that all things work
[1:32:38] together for the good to them that love
[1:32:41] God and to them who are the called."
[1:32:46] Who are the called according to his
[1:32:49] purpose. Let me say something to you.
[1:32:52] Paul said, "You are the called." Yes,
[1:32:55] sir. You know what that word called
[1:32:57] means? It means invited
[1:33:01] by God in the proclamation of the gospel
[1:33:04] to obtain eternal salvation. Amen. Glory
[1:33:09] to God. You did not buy this revelation.
[1:33:12] You were called to this revelation. You
[1:33:15] did not stumble into this revelation,
[1:33:18] but you were called into this
[1:33:20] revelation. You were called to obtain
[1:33:23] eternal salvation in the kingdom through
[1:33:26] Christ. Listen, you were called to the
[1:33:29] discharge of some office. I love these
[1:33:32] words. You were divinely selected.
[1:33:37] You were divinely selected and
[1:33:40] appointed.
[1:33:42] Yes, sir. You're not a called,
[1:33:46] but you are the called. Can I say
[1:33:50] something to you? It's not haphazardly.
[1:33:57] And it's not randomly.
[1:34:00] God didn't just randomly decide to call
[1:34:03] you one day.
[1:34:05] Come on. We We live in an age where you
[1:34:06] ain't heard from somebody in a long
[1:34:08] time. And you look down at your phone
[1:34:09] and it's ringing and you pick it up all
[1:34:11] excited to say, "Hey, how you doing?"
[1:34:13] They say, "Sorry, I called you by
[1:34:15] accident. I pushed your number."
[1:34:19] See, that's not They were not calling on
[1:34:21] purpose. But when God called you, when
[1:34:25] your alpha and your omega called you,
[1:34:27] brother said God sets a time and has a
[1:34:30] purpose for everything that he does.
[1:34:33] There is nothing happens just
[1:34:35] accidentally to those who love the Lord
[1:34:38] and are called according to his calling.
[1:34:43] See, we are predestinated and everything
[1:34:46] works just right for that because he
[1:34:49] cannot lie. And he said that was so that
[1:34:53] everything has its time, its season, and
[1:34:55] it has its way. And God is behind every
[1:34:59] move.
[1:35:01] And sometimes you think that everything
[1:35:05] is going wrong. It's up to us. Those
[1:35:07] things are put upon us. See, now let me
[1:35:10] just say this. If God calls, if God
[1:35:13] calls you, if God selects you, and if
[1:35:16] God appoints you, then it's up to God to
[1:35:20] take care of you.
[1:35:23] Come on, church. He said, "Why take ye
[1:35:25] thought for reignment? Consider the
[1:35:26] liies of the field. How they grow, how
[1:35:29] they till not, and neither do they
[1:35:31] spin." In St. Luke 12:6 he said, "And
[1:35:34] not five sparrows sold for two farings,
[1:35:37] and not one of them is forgotten before
[1:35:39] God, but even the very hairs of your
[1:35:42] head are all numbered. Fear not,
[1:35:45] therefore, ye are more value than many
[1:35:49] sparrows."
[1:35:51] God have mercy. Can I just get it out
[1:35:54] there? If you're a Christian, you were
[1:35:56] called to be a Christian. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:59] Amen. If you're a believer, you were
[1:36:02] called to be a believer. If you're a
[1:36:05] warrior, you were called to be a
[1:36:07] warrior. Amen. See, brother said,
[1:36:09] because God by grace, he called you. He
[1:36:12] said, now watch the church elect. You
[1:36:14] believe in the election. Sure have to.
[1:36:16] If you believe the Bible, our names are
[1:36:19] put in the lamb's book of life from
[1:36:22] before the foundation of the world.
[1:36:24] Listen. Says the Bible. See, now watch.
[1:36:27] And now and then, if we're called, you
[1:36:30] ought to be thankful to God that you was
[1:36:33] elected. That's what I'm so thankful
[1:36:35] about. That God called me. He chose me.
[1:36:38] He chose you. You never chose him.
[1:36:44] If you ain't said amen all night, that
[1:36:46] ought to be the time you put your
[1:36:47] shouting shoes on and scream hallelujah.
[1:36:50] Amen. I didn't choose God. I didn't go
[1:36:53] looking for God. He came looking for me.
[1:36:57] No man can come to the father except the
[1:36:59] father draws him first. So you see if
[1:37:03] God calls you, he will knock at your
[1:37:06] door.
[1:37:08] Glory to God. Amen. That's why I got a
[1:37:10] problem with somebody claiming to preach
[1:37:12] that had to have 10 other people tell
[1:37:14] them they was called to preach.
[1:37:16] Because if God ever calls a man, he
[1:37:19] knows the man's name. He knows his
[1:37:21] address. He knows his personality. He
[1:37:24] knows his nature. and he knows a way to
[1:37:26] get a hold of him to awaken him to the
[1:37:29] reality that he has called him to preach
[1:37:31] his word
[1:37:34] now. I might as well I might as well
[1:37:37] just get it out there
[1:37:40] because I preach for a second.
[1:37:45] Just because God calls you don't mean
[1:37:46] you won't have to fight.
[1:37:49] Listen, but God has given you a weapon.
[1:37:52] Amen.
[1:37:55] God has given you a weapon. Can I tell
[1:37:58] you what that weapon is? It's called the
[1:38:00] revelation of your alpha and your omega.
[1:38:04] God has given you a weapon and it's
[1:38:07] called the revelation of my alpha and my
[1:38:11] omega. Come on. I might as well just
[1:38:12] preach. I'm this close to it. It's time
[1:38:14] to whip some devils.
[1:38:16] Young people, it's time to whip some
[1:38:18] devils. It's time to draw our sword and
[1:38:21] pick up the weapon that God has given
[1:38:24] this generation. It's time to whip some
[1:38:26] devils. You say, "What devils are you
[1:38:28] talking about?" I'm talking about those
[1:38:30] devils that's talking to you and you're
[1:38:32] listening to them so much that you
[1:38:34] started talking their language. Well, we
[1:38:36] can't make it. And our home is going to
[1:38:38] fall apart and our ministry is going to
[1:38:40] fall apart and our marriage is going to
[1:38:42] fall apart and our babies are going to
[1:38:44] go to the world. Listen, that's the
[1:38:46] devil's language. And if God is not your
[1:38:48] alpha, and if God is not your omega, you
[1:38:51] got every reason to say it. But I say
[1:38:53] this, if God is your alpha, if God is
[1:38:56] your omega, if God is your beginning and
[1:39:00] God is your end, he'll see you through
[1:39:02] every dry time. He'll see you across
[1:39:04] every desert. He'll pull you through
[1:39:06] every lonely night.
[1:39:09] Hallelujah. I think it's time to pick up
[1:39:12] the supreme revelation and fight back
[1:39:15] against that devil. I didn't call
[1:39:17] myself. I didn't place myself. I didn't
[1:39:20] select myself. But God from before the
[1:39:23] foundation of the world called me and
[1:39:26] selected me and divinely appointed me.
[1:39:29] And if he did it, he'll take care of me.
[1:39:34] Will somebody give God some praise?
[1:39:41] I think it's time to fight back against
[1:39:43] that devil.
[1:39:46] Well, we ain't going to make it. Rebra
[1:39:48] said, "When you say that, it's because
[1:39:50] you're looking at the circumstance
[1:39:52] instead of the promise."
[1:39:55] If God calls you to it, he intends for
[1:39:58] you to have it.
[1:40:00] Amen. That's good. Yes, sir. Come on. I
[1:40:03] might as well preach. Yes, sir. Well,
[1:40:05] brother Andrew, I've got all these
[1:40:06] babies and I'm going to lose my mind.
[1:40:08] The devil's a liar.
[1:40:11] Well, brother Andrew, my babies have
[1:40:12] reached teenage years and and the
[1:40:14] world's just going to get them. Listen,
[1:40:16] if God is not your alpha and God is not
[1:40:18] your omega, then go break open Dr.
[1:40:21] Dobson's books and find some way to
[1:40:23] raise them babies. But if God is your
[1:40:26] alpha and God is your
[1:40:28] omega, he gave you them babies because
[1:40:31] he's got confidence in you and he knows
[1:40:34] come hell or high water. If you got to
[1:40:36] crawl to church, you're going to be
[1:40:38] there because there's something on the
[1:40:41] inside of you and it's greater than
[1:40:43] yourself. It's called a revelation of my
[1:40:46] alpha and my omega.
[1:40:50] Hallelujah. If God calls you to it, he
[1:40:53] intends for you to have it. If God calls
[1:40:55] you, he commands you to be baptized in
[1:40:58] the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:41:02] and receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:06] Then
[1:41:08] Christ, himself,
[1:41:12] I just picked that up. God will not put
[1:41:14] more on you than you're able to bear.
[1:41:17] Come on. You're not praising because
[1:41:20] you're underneath his load. You're not
[1:41:22] praising and you're not worshiping
[1:41:24] because all these troubles and all these
[1:41:26] situations and all these pressures and
[1:41:28] all these doctor's reports and listen,
[1:41:30] I'm going to beat that devil square in
[1:41:32] the face and you can sit there and watch
[1:41:33] me. All the pressures are piling up on
[1:41:36] you and you're losing your praise
[1:41:38] because you're trying to figure it out
[1:41:40] and you're trying to find a way to fix
[1:41:42] it. Can I say this to you? Pick up your
[1:41:44] weapon of praise.
[1:41:47] Pick up your weapon of praise. God
[1:41:49] didn't put you in that battle and put
[1:41:51] more on you than you can bear. He has
[1:41:54] already made a way of escaping.
[1:41:59] Now, I love what Jesus done. He stood
[1:42:02] right there and looked at him and he
[1:42:04] said, "Listen, they were trying to tell
[1:42:06] him that God was her father." He said,
[1:42:08] "Well, if God were your father, you
[1:42:10] would love me. For I proceeded forth and
[1:42:13] came from God. Neither came I
[1:42:16] myself, but he sent me. I love what
[1:42:20] Jesus said. Peace be unto you.
[1:42:25] As my alpha,
[1:42:28] my
[1:42:29] omega, as my father hath sent me, even
[1:42:34] so send I you. He said, now listen, the
[1:42:37] father that sent him, come in him. And
[1:42:39] the Jesus that sends the man,
[1:42:43] he goes in the man. It isn't the man,
[1:42:47] it's Jesus.
[1:42:49] It wasn't Jesus. It was God. Now, now,
[1:42:53] now, now, now, folks, there there are
[1:42:54] many callings that we could use for an
[1:42:56] example, but let's just let's just throw
[1:42:58] down here for a second and let's use one
[1:42:59] that everybody's very familiar with.
[1:43:01] It's the calling of preaching.
[1:43:04] We we believe in preachers
[1:43:07] and we believe God is still calling. We
[1:43:10] believe God is still calling.
[1:43:14] We believe God
[1:43:17] is still calling preachers. But listen
[1:43:19] what a prophet said. When God sends a
[1:43:21] man to do anything, he completely equips
[1:43:23] him with everything that he has need of.
[1:43:26] If God calls a man to be a preacher, he
[1:43:29] puts something in him to preach with.
[1:43:32] If he calls him to be a teacher, he puts
[1:43:35] something in him to teach with. If he
[1:43:37] calls him to be a prophet, he puts
[1:43:39] something in him to see visions and to
[1:43:41] be a prophet. God always completely
[1:43:44] equips the man. Now, I love this brother
[1:43:47] said, "If he's raised up in a certain
[1:43:48] way and schools him in a certain way, he
[1:43:51] molds him in a certain way, makes him in
[1:43:53] a certain way and fashions him." Now,
[1:43:55] I'm I'm going to insert this. Okay?
[1:43:57] That's why we don't believe in
[1:43:58] seminaries.
[1:44:02] Come on, folks.
[1:44:04] Because we believe if God calls a man,
[1:44:07] he can school the man the way he wants
[1:44:10] to use him. See, God doesn't make any
[1:44:13] halfways. God makes complete Christians.
[1:44:16] He said, "Now, see, that's don't now
[1:44:18] watch." He said, "Oh my, that's true.
[1:44:20] You can't make yourself something you're
[1:44:22] not. But if God calls you to be, be the
[1:44:26] most thankful person in the world
[1:44:28] because he has called you.
[1:44:34] Now watch. Then it becomes real to you.
[1:44:39] Now I believe I'm just reading the
[1:44:40] prophet. Okay? I believe that no man can
[1:44:43] call himself.
[1:44:45] God has to call him. Now there's a lot
[1:44:48] of people we know, brethren. He says
[1:44:49] it's worked up and thinks that God's
[1:44:51] called him, but their lives soon you
[1:44:53] find out. But if God calls you,
[1:44:58] can I say it? You'll be there.
[1:45:02] Can I finish it? And you'll stay there.
[1:45:09] There ain't nothing that'll move you out
[1:45:11] of your position. Because let me say
[1:45:14] this, if God calls you, he has a place
[1:45:18] for you. Somebody say, "Well, amen. Uh,
[1:45:20] Brother so and so told me I was called
[1:45:22] to preach and ain't nobody called me to
[1:45:23] preach." Well, call brother so and so
[1:45:25] and tell him to get you a pull pit
[1:45:26] because he called you to and quit
[1:45:29] getting mad at God cuz ain't no doors
[1:45:30] opening. But if God calls a man,
[1:45:34] come on, folks. If God's big enough to
[1:45:36] call a man, he's big enough to open a
[1:45:38] door for a man to step into. Brother
[1:45:40] said, "Oh, that man told me today, he
[1:45:42] said, brother Brandon, if I preached
[1:45:43] that," he said, "I'd be kicked out of my
[1:45:45] church. I wouldn't have any other
[1:45:46] meetings anywhere." I said nonsense. If
[1:45:49] God calls you to the gospel, he's got a
[1:45:52] place for you to preach. He's got
[1:45:54] somebody that'll listen to you.
[1:45:56] Certainly, there will be somebody who
[1:45:58] will listen. If you got to stand on the
[1:46:01] street corner, you say, "Well, they'll
[1:46:02] throw me in jail." He said that if God
[1:46:05] called you to preach, then preach to the
[1:46:07] jailer because somebody will get saved.
[1:46:12] You say you have to do it. No, you
[1:46:14] don't. The reason they do is because
[1:46:16] they haven't tested this inoculation.
[1:46:19] They haven't taken the toxin yet for it.
[1:46:21] And there's something that'll cure it.
[1:46:23] Now, now, can I say this? That'll cure
[1:46:25] that scare you got.
[1:46:28] So, what is the scare? Well, the scare
[1:46:31] is fear, but
[1:46:33] revelation is the cure. The scare is
[1:46:37] fear, but revelation is the cure. Can I
[1:46:41] Can I Can I just Can I just drop this to
[1:46:43] you? And I'm going to close right here.
[1:46:45] I got a revelation. My alpha and my
[1:46:48] omega has the means to take care of me.
[1:46:52] I got a revelation. If I will look to my
[1:46:55] alpha and omega, he'll supply all my
[1:46:57] needs according to his riches and his
[1:47:00] glory and he will be my source. Reverend
[1:47:04] said, look here. He reads Isaiah 45:22
[1:47:07] and says, Isaiah says, "Look unto me and
[1:47:09] be ye saved all the ends of the earth,
[1:47:12] for I am God and there is none else." He
[1:47:15] says, "Look unto Jesus who is the author
[1:47:18] and the finisher of our faith." Can we
[1:47:20] Can we do war for five minutes and close
[1:47:21] out? Is that okay? Amen. Looking unto
[1:47:24] Jesus who is the author and the finisher
[1:47:26] of our faith. Amen. Looking unto Jesus
[1:47:29] who is the author. Amen. looking unto
[1:47:32] Jesus
[1:47:33] who is the author and the finisher of
[1:47:36] our faith who for the joy that was set
[1:47:39] before him endured the cross despising
[1:47:43] the shame and is sat down at the right
[1:47:46] hand of the throne of God. He said,
[1:47:48] "Look unto me." He said, "Especially at
[1:47:51] the end of the world system." He said,
[1:47:52] "The thing, the question is, what do you
[1:47:55] see when you look?" He said, "Now, if
[1:47:57] they mention the word look, they're
[1:47:59] saying pay attention to." He said, "I
[1:48:01] wonder in a time that we're living in
[1:48:03] now, what could we look to that would be
[1:48:06] more solid than God?" What could we look
[1:48:09] to, Brother Charles, that would be more
[1:48:11] solid than God? And God is the word. So
[1:48:15] look to the word of God today for your
[1:48:18] answer. The Bible has the answer for
[1:48:20] this day. It had it for the other days.
[1:48:23] It's got it forever because it's Jesus
[1:48:25] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:48:28] forever. Amen. Can I say this to you?
[1:48:31] The Bible has the answer because the
[1:48:34] Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:48:37] being revealed since the foundation of
[1:48:40] the world.
[1:48:42] And you say, "I've done that." It
[1:48:44] depends on what you looked at determines
[1:48:47] what you look at is where and what you
[1:48:49] look to him for. What are you looking
[1:48:51] at?
[1:48:53] Amen. What are you looking at? Can I say
[1:48:55] this to you? What you're looking at,
[1:48:58] Amen, is the source you're drawing from.
[1:49:01] Can I just Can I just punch that devil
[1:49:03] tonight? What you're looking at is the
[1:49:06] source you're drawing from. But I've got
[1:49:08] a revelation that my alpha and my omega
[1:49:12] is the mighty conqueror and nothing can
[1:49:15] get in my way to stop or hinder me.
[1:49:18] Listen, he's already conquered
[1:49:20] everything.
[1:49:22] Somebody help me. He's already conquered
[1:49:25] everything. Somebody tell me one thing
[1:49:28] he hasn't conquered.
[1:49:30] Come on, anybody? One thing. One thing
[1:49:32] he hadn't conquered, brother Tim. He's
[1:49:35] already conquered everything. Can I tell
[1:49:38] you what it's time to do? It's time to
[1:49:40] let the revelation of your alpha and
[1:49:43] your omega prevail over whatever devil
[1:49:46] is standing in front of you
[1:49:49] tonight. Come on. You say, "I'm too I'm
[1:49:51] too tired or I'm too sick or I'm too
[1:49:54] discouraged or I'm too beat down." You
[1:49:56] don't know what the doctor said and you
[1:49:58] don't know what the report said and you
[1:50:00] don't know what this one said. But I
[1:50:01] just I just want to drop this to you
[1:50:03] tonight and I'm going to go on about my
[1:50:04] business. My my revelation is this that
[1:50:07] my alpha and my omega is God and he
[1:50:11] determines my future.
[1:50:14] My revelation, David Paul, is that my
[1:50:17] God is my alpha and he's my omega. And a
[1:50:21] doctor's report does not control my
[1:50:23] future. A sickness does not control my
[1:50:26] future. Brother said, "Now healing is of
[1:50:29] God alone, and God alone has purchased
[1:50:32] for us our healing. So it's up to us to
[1:50:35] do everything we can in our life and
[1:50:38] every way that God has given us for our
[1:50:40] healing. But if God that heals, if it's
[1:50:43] God that heals, he said that if God
[1:50:45] calls you to go home tonight, there
[1:50:47] isn't enough medicine in the world
[1:50:50] that'll keep you here. There is nothing
[1:50:53] going to keep you here. But if he
[1:50:55] determines
[1:50:58] Brother Matt, if he determines, Amen. If
[1:51:01] he determines for you to stay on the
[1:51:03] earth, then no matter how many
[1:51:05] physicians, Amen, say you're going
[1:51:07] tonight, you're not going. Because,
[1:51:10] Sister Cindy, it's all up to your alpha
[1:51:14] and it's all up to your omega. Well,
[1:51:17] somebody put you shouting shoes on in
[1:51:19] the house of God. Cancer does not
[1:51:22] determine when you leave. Amen. Sickness
[1:51:25] does not determine when you leave.
[1:51:30] Well, I might as well just say it. I I I
[1:51:32] I I got I got to study today and I got
[1:51:35] all inspired, brother Matt, and I I
[1:51:37] picked up my phone and I text brother
[1:51:39] Ron Spencer. I said, "Amen." Everybody
[1:51:41] say, "God bless you, Brother Ron."
[1:51:43] I text Brother Ron. I said, "Hey, buddy.
[1:51:45] I'm sorry. I've got a really odd
[1:51:47] question for you. How many funerals have
[1:51:49] you preached to people?" Or I said this.
[1:51:51] I said, "Have you preached any funerals
[1:51:53] of people that has had cancer while
[1:51:56] you're in this battle?" You know what he
[1:51:58] responded and said? He said, "Four of
[1:52:00] them and three of them going to the same
[1:52:02] doctor and taken the same treatments and
[1:52:05] none of them lasted a year." He said, "A
[1:52:07] couple only lived a few months and then
[1:52:10] they told me after a year of the
[1:52:12] treatment I'm on, they expect me to be
[1:52:15] in a wheelchair." He said, "But I'm now
[1:52:17] five years.
[1:52:20] I'm now five
[1:52:23] years, brother Ron, because your
[1:52:26] revelation is not the cancer center.
[1:52:29] It's not the chemotherapy. It's because
[1:52:32] his revelation is God is my alpha and
[1:52:36] God is my omega. Cancer is not my
[1:52:39] beginning and cancer is not my ending.
[1:52:41] He says, "I have come from God and I'll
[1:52:44] go back to God." Can I say this to you?
[1:52:47] If a man with stage 4 cancer can stand
[1:52:50] there and fight back against those
[1:52:52] devils trying to determine his future,
[1:52:55] then what about you tonight who are the
[1:52:57] called according to the purpose of God?
[1:53:01] It's time to rise up and pick up your
[1:53:04] sword and fight back against that devil.
[1:53:07] God is my alpha.
[1:53:11] God is my omega. Stand on your feet
[1:53:14] tonight.
[1:53:17] Five
[1:53:20] years
[1:53:22] chemo, battling cancer,
[1:53:26] stand right there and say, "But God is
[1:53:29] bigger than cancer."
[1:53:32] God is greater than cancer. You know
[1:53:36] why? Because there's a law of revelation
[1:53:41] that
[1:53:42] operates in the soul of a believer.
[1:53:47] He's my revelation, folks.
[1:53:50] He's the supreme
[1:53:51] beginning. He was supreme in the
[1:53:54] beginning. He'll be supreme in the
[1:53:56] ending.
[1:53:59] He's all of it.
[1:54:01] He's a to Z.
[1:54:05] He's my God.
[1:54:07] He's my
[1:54:08] provider. He's my
[1:54:11] preserver. He's the captain of my
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] salvation.
[1:54:17] Now, I'm just going to say
[1:54:22] it. It don't matter what the devil does.
[1:54:28] When your alpha and your
[1:54:31] omega is ready to
[1:54:34] move, there's
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:37] nothing there's
[1:54:39] nothing that can hinder him. He will do
[1:54:44] exactly what his word said he will
[1:54:47] do. Brother
[1:54:49] Andrew, is it is it really possible?
[1:54:54] Is it really possible
[1:54:56] that that me and my
[1:54:59] condition? I love what brother says in
[1:55:02] looking into Jesus. He says that poet
[1:55:04] looked one time. Blind Fanny
[1:55:07] Crosby. She looked one
[1:55:10] time. She looked Now I I just want you
[1:55:15] to I just want you to catch
[1:55:18] this. She looked one time.
[1:55:21] blind Fanny
[1:55:23] Crosby to see what she could
[1:55:25] see being
[1:55:30] blind. Let me read that to you again.
[1:55:33] Blind Fanny
[1:55:35] Crosby blind
[1:55:37] looked one time
[1:55:41] blind to see what she could see being
[1:55:45] blind and here was her answer.
[1:55:49] Thou the stream of all my
[1:55:52] comfort, more than life to
[1:55:55] me. Whom have I on earth beside
[1:55:59] thee? Or whom in
[1:56:02] heaven but
[1:56:05] thee? See, she had a revelation.
[1:56:10] There's no God beside him.
[1:56:13] There's no God above him.
[1:56:18] She took that
[1:56:19] revelation. She took that
[1:56:22] revelation into her
[1:56:24] soul and it became the
[1:56:27] foundation of every song she
[1:56:30] wrote was
[1:56:32] this. I shall know
[1:56:34] him. I shall know
[1:56:38] him. I don't know where you're at
[1:56:40] tonight, but I'll say this to you.
[1:56:42] That same God's right here in this
[1:56:44] building
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:47] tonight.
[1:56:50] Listen, I'm not trying to be rude
[1:56:53] or uncaring or
[1:56:56] inconsiderate. I'm trying to tell you
[1:56:59] tonight, quit
[1:57:01] allowing things that are not your alpha
[1:57:06] and your omega to determine your praise
[1:57:10] to your God.
[1:57:13] He's over all
[1:57:15] things. He's over all things. Listen, I
[1:57:19] know tonight sometimes people get to
[1:57:21] thinking. They get to thinking, "Well,
[1:57:23] we got to control this. We got to do
[1:57:26] this." I got to thinking the other day I
[1:57:28] was studying this and if you ever if you
[1:57:31] ever really get a revelation in your
[1:57:32] soul that you didn't start yourself,
[1:57:36] then you'll quit worrying about trying
[1:57:37] to stop yourself.
[1:57:39] If you ever get a revelation in your
[1:57:41] soul that you didn't start yourself,
[1:57:43] then you you'll quit worrying about
[1:57:45] finishing yourself.
[1:57:48] It's like years ago over in North
[1:57:49] Carolina at Brother Henry Greens, there
[1:57:51] was a power of God broke out in one of
[1:57:53] the missionary camp meetings and they
[1:57:54] were shouting and dancing and praising
[1:57:55] God. Somebody come up there to brother
[1:57:58] Henry Green. They said, "Hey, calm all
[1:58:00] this down and quieten all this down.
[1:58:02] It's getting out of hand." He looked
[1:58:04] over at him. He said, "Hey, I can't do
[1:58:07] that."
[1:58:08] They said, "Stop all that." He said, "I
[1:58:10] can't stop it." They said, "Yeah, you
[1:58:12] can. You can stop it." He said, "I can't
[1:58:14] stop it. I didn't start it.
[1:58:19] Can't stop myself. I didn't start
[1:58:21] myself."
[1:58:23] I didn't put myself here. The call of
[1:58:25] God did. Can I say this to you? You
[1:58:28] didn't put yourself there. The call of
[1:58:30] God did.
[1:58:32] And if God started you, only God can
[1:58:35] finish you.
[1:58:37] the revelation
[1:58:38] of my alpha and my omega. Won't you bow
[1:58:43] your hearts tonight? Heavenly Father,
[1:58:45] Lord, your word is
[1:58:47] true and your power is more real than
[1:58:49] the air we breathe. It's more real than
[1:58:52] the things that we handle with our hands
[1:58:55] or the things that we hear with our
[1:58:57] ears. Lord, see with our eyes. Your
[1:58:59] power is that real. And Father, we
[1:59:03] recognize your power tonight. We
[1:59:06] recognize that you are the alpha and you
[1:59:09] are the omega. Lord, we recognize
[1:59:12] tonight that situations and problems and
[1:59:16] circumstances. Father, the devil has
[1:59:18] done everything he can,
[1:59:20] Lord. Lord, when we get in the
[1:59:22] situations and the problems of life and
[1:59:24] the pressures and
[1:59:26] trials, discouragements come upon your
[1:59:29] children, Lord. Father, we automatically
[1:59:32] start trying to figure out a way to fix
[1:59:33] it. Lord, we start questioning
[1:59:36] everything and where did we go wrong and
[1:59:38] what did we do wrong? And Lord,
[1:59:40] sometimes we just got to stop and take
[1:59:43] inventory. But Lord, I found that nine
[1:59:45] times out of 10, it's that old enemy
[1:59:48] trying to make us take our own salvation
[1:59:50] into our
[1:59:51] hands. Lord, we stand tonight upon the
[1:59:54] promise of your word that salvation is
[1:59:57] of you. And you are the God that was.
[2:00:01] You are the God that is. And you are the
[2:00:04] God which shall ever be. You are the
[2:00:07] beginning and you are the ending. Lord,
[2:00:10] you are the first and you are the
[2:00:12] last. You're the supreme. You're the
[2:00:16] supremacy of all good
[2:00:18] things. Father, in your word has told us
[2:00:21] that you'll not put more upon us than
[2:00:24] we're able to bear.
[2:00:26] So Lord, we're looking away from the
[2:00:29] situations and the
[2:00:32] problems. Lord, we're looking away from
[2:00:34] the
[2:00:36] circumstances. And Lord, we're looking
[2:00:38] to you who is in control of all
[2:00:41] things. Lord, as I was just thinking
[2:00:43] today, there of different ones. Lord,
[2:00:46] blind Fanny Crosby there, our brother
[2:00:49] Ron. Glory. Lord, five years of battling
[2:00:52] cancer. And five years ago, the doctors
[2:00:55] told him that he had just months or days
[2:00:57] or weeks or months, I can't remember
[2:00:59] exactly, but just a small amount of time
[2:01:01] to live. But Lord, it don't make no
[2:01:04] difference. Because if whatever they say
[2:01:08] it don't make no difference, the only
[2:01:10] thing that makes a difference to a
[2:01:11] believer is what their alpha and their
[2:01:13] omega says. And Lord, to stand there and
[2:01:17] preach funerals, Lord, of people going
[2:01:20] on with cancer, stand there battling his
[2:01:23] own body, Lord. Father, believers right
[2:01:26] here tonight, dear God, battling
[2:01:29] situations, but still pressing on and
[2:01:33] still
[2:01:34] persevering because they've received the
[2:01:36] prevailing power of
[2:01:39] revelation. And it's given them
[2:01:41] authority over their devils.
[2:01:44] Satan, I want to tell you tonight with
[2:01:46] everything that's within me, you are not
[2:01:48] my alpha and you are not my
[2:01:51] omega. You didn't start me and you can't
[2:01:54] finish me. I want to tell every spirit,
[2:01:57] every impell tonight, these believers
[2:02:00] standing here were not started by some
[2:02:02] man. So, a man won't finish them. They
[2:02:06] were started by almighty God and he's at
[2:02:09] their expected end. Lord, may tonight
[2:02:12] they leave this building and carry that
[2:02:14] revelation in their hearts. And when
[2:02:16] that old devil crawls in their home and
[2:02:19] driving down the road going to work or
[2:02:21] coming home from work and that devil
[2:02:23] just pounding them in their minds and
[2:02:25] telling them, "I'm going to get you. I'm
[2:02:27] going to finish
[2:02:28] you." Lord, stresses and pressures this
[2:02:31] age, the lid has come off of hell. Lord,
[2:02:35] families and fathers and mothers and
[2:02:38] marriages, Lord, fighting just to to
[2:02:40] overcome the pressures of this age. But
[2:02:43] Lord, we stand sure and strong upon the
[2:02:46] foundation. The Lord knoweth with his
[2:02:49] and he's given us a
[2:02:52] weapon. So that's why we marry in the
[2:02:54] name of Jesus. That's why we preach in
[2:02:57] the name of
[2:02:58] Jesus. That's why we establish our homes
[2:03:02] in the name of Jesus.
[2:03:04] That's why we build our church upon the
[2:03:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[2:03:08] why every God- called ministry builds
[2:03:11] its ministry upon the name of the Lord
[2:03:14] Jesus
[2:03:15] Christ. Because that is the name that
[2:03:18] every knee has to bow and every tongue
[2:03:21] has to
[2:03:23] confess. Father, we love you
[2:03:25] tonight. If there be one on shifting
[2:03:28] sands, Lord, Father, it's not too late.
[2:03:32] It's not too
[2:03:34] late.
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:38] Hallelujah.
[2:03:39] Hallelujah. Maybe you just raise your
[2:03:41] hands tonight and say, "Lord, remember
[2:03:44] me. Remember me
[2:03:47] tonight." God bless you tonight,
[2:03:50] friends. Pick up the
[2:03:52] sword. Pick up the revelation.
[2:03:56] In your darkest trial right
[2:03:58] now, pick up that
[2:04:00] revelation. When it looks like
[2:04:02] everything's falling apart in front of
[2:04:04] you, pick up that revelation. He is my
[2:04:08] alpha and he is my
[2:04:11] omega. Hallelujah.
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:35] in my presence.
[2:04:45] You
[2:04:46] hold it.
[2:04:49] I say God,
[2:04:53] God of my
[2:04:56] future, you write my
[2:05:00] story. You hold it all
[2:05:03] together, God.
[2:05:06] Yes, you're my God.
[2:05:12] God,
[2:05:14] you
[2:05:15] hold it all
[2:05:18] together. God,
[2:05:21] you
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] are in the
[2:05:28] middle and you
[2:05:30] hold it all together. You
[2:05:35] are. You are.
[2:05:39] Yes, Lord in the middle. And you
[2:05:44] hold it all
[2:05:47] together. God of my future.
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:06:00] Yes. You're God of my
[2:06:04] pres, God of my future.
[2:06:09] You write my
[2:06:11] story. You hold it all
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:22] together. Amen. How many say amen to
[2:06:25] that? Amen. You believe that he's our
[2:06:28] alpha and our omega. And if he started
[2:06:31] it, he's going to end it. Amen. How many
[2:06:33] got that revelation that God is our
[2:06:35] alpha and our omega? Amen. And you can't
[2:06:38] believe he's our omega if you didn't
[2:06:40] believe he's the alpha. Amen. He's the
[2:06:42] one that made us. What a powerful a
[2:06:46] powerful reminder tonight that it's God
[2:06:48] that created us. It's God that made us.
[2:06:51] It's God that called us. You know,
[2:06:53] somebody had said a little something
[2:06:55] like that to me the other day, just
[2:06:56] poking around. And we're always working
[2:06:59] ever since we started the church out
[2:07:00] here. And just seems like for seven
[2:07:03] years almost, we've been we've been
[2:07:06] building and tearing out walls and
[2:07:08] adding in walls and and making room and
[2:07:11] making space. And somebody kind of
[2:07:13] poking and said, you know, I'm we've
[2:07:14] been building ever since we started. I
[2:07:16] said, "Yeah, we have." Said, "Well,
[2:07:17] you're going to have to stop." And I
[2:07:19] said, "Well, I can't stop something I
[2:07:20] didn't start." So, I mean, what do you
[2:07:23] mean we're going to have to stop? I
[2:07:24] mean, well, we we're going to have to
[2:07:25] whatever when we expand this time, we
[2:07:27] ain't going to make we can't make no
[2:07:28] more room. We we we can't make no more.
[2:07:30] You know what? I'm if if I would try to
[2:07:33] stop what God is doing, God would move
[2:07:35] me out of the way and put somebody else
[2:07:36] in the position that would carry on his
[2:07:38] work. That's how much I believe that God
[2:07:41] finishes what he started. Do you believe
[2:07:43] that tonight? Not just in a church, but
[2:07:45] in every every one of us tonight as a
[2:07:47] body of believers that God is certainly
[2:07:49] more than able. How many enjoyed that
[2:07:51] message tonight? Wasn't that tremendous?
[2:07:53] God bless you, Brother Angel.
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:08] Even though the waters got to be
[2:08:12] parted. So lift up your
[2:08:15] head. Don't be
[2:08:18] brokenhearted. God is going to finish
[2:08:21] what he started in you. Well, God is
[2:08:25] going to finish just what he
[2:08:29] started. Even though the waters got to
[2:08:33] be
[2:08:34] parted, lift up your head. Don't be
[2:08:39] brokenhearted. God is going to finish
[2:08:42] what he started in you. Well, God is
[2:08:46] going to finish just what he started.
[2:08:51] Even though the waters got to be parted,
[2:08:55] so lift up your head, don't be
[2:08:59] brokenhearted. God is going to finish
[2:09:03] what he started in
[2:09:05] you. Amen. How many believe that
[2:09:08] tonight? Amen. Won't we just bow our
[2:09:11] heads together? Gracious heavenly
[2:09:12] father, Lord, we just thank you, Lord,
[2:09:14] for another opportunity, Lord, just to
[2:09:16] come and fellowship around the word of
[2:09:19] God. Lord, how you came tonight and
[2:09:20] spoke to our hearts. And Lord, we just
[2:09:23] thank you for that word of
[2:09:24] encouragement, Lord. And God, what a
[2:09:27] mighty word, Lord, it was tonight, Lord,
[2:09:30] knowing that that true revelation of
[2:09:33] Jesus Christ in our lives, Lord, is what
[2:09:35] gives us authority over the devil. And
[2:09:37] Lord, that's what we want as a body of
[2:09:38] believers. Lord, I pray you'd give that
[2:09:40] revelation to every man, woman, and
[2:09:42] child, Lord, that they would be able to
[2:09:44] stand against every thought that the
[2:09:46] enemy would place in their life, Lord.
[2:09:48] that you are the supreme deity. We thank
[2:09:51] you for it now and we give you praise
[2:09:53] and honor in the name of Jesus Christ we
[2:09:56] pray.
[2:09:57] Amen. Amen. Can we sing that song? He'll
[2:10:00] do it again. Amen.
[2:10:08] You may you may be
[2:10:12] down and feel like
[2:10:16] [Music]
[2:10:20] God. You may be
[2:10:23] down and feel like God has somehow
[2:10:28] forgotten. God bless you tonight.
[2:10:33] And you are
[2:10:35] faced with
[2:10:37] circumstance you can't get
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:43] through. And now it seems there's no way
[2:10:49] out. You're going under.
[2:10:55] But God's proven
[2:10:57] time and time
[2:10:59] again, he'll take care of
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:05] you. He'll do it
[2:11:08] again for you. He will do it again.
[2:11:17] Just take a look.
