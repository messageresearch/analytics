years years uh that we've been doing this we did back several years over there in Pigeon Forge and then we've done I think this is the third year here and um brother Andrew and I were talking about it and I I'm pretty sure that him and I are the only two that have been in every one of them I think this is our our 10th year is that that correct yeah even chissa had to skip out last year it wasn't you know wasn't real important it was just my my baby was being born and so little me she's a year old she's enjoying being here today and amen and U I don't know maybe Bethany was is Bethany was you been in all 10 as well Bethy was in all 10 is what I'm so uh so it's been a it's been a real journey and a real privilege and we want to thank you all for helping make it possible and I know you've all invested money and time and effort and you pastors that are here this morning I know brother Matt's got some uh Folks at home this morning that be watching and and been and we coming in he was just talking about it's it's a it's a it's a it's a little bit of a different feeling when you're pastoring and you're not home on Sunday morning you know there's a lot going on and L of need and so we want to thank you all for taking a few minutes and and out of your schedules and and and we appreciate your congregations and and all that's been done and this morning um we just want to take a few minutes of the word and we've had three pretty full meetings and and so I took a little extra time last night but uh there's some things this morning maybe we'd like to just discuss here for Joshua 13 verse one um I I I have I have to say this I have I probably have three or four more different uh uh things to really get into but I just felt this morning maybe that we would just compile some of them we just speak to you more than maybe to teach you but Joshua chapter 13 and I want to read this with the first verse here uh now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said un Thou Art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed let's bow our hearts father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for the grace that you've given us Lord to be together here in this season Lord your blessing upon the meetings and your presence here has been tremendous and we thank you for it we thank you Lord that you would give us Grace to be together and Lord some of our friends and dear dear loved ones Lord some have been Lord since we were at the altar many years ago and have been through the years great supporters of our ministry Lord and what you have called us to do and I pray you bless them Lord I pray you bless the friends that you have gathered around us Lord and all of those even at home tonight or this morning that Lord wasn't able to be here may you touch them Lord even in their homes and and we ask you now give Grace this morning upon the word we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you as you be seated this morning uh I do want to just think uh upon this this morning a little bit here there is much land to be possessed there is much land to be possessed I think it's pretty amazing uh that Joshua would be told to the Lord there's a lot of land left to possess and I I think as a Christian people uh that we must uh realize and even here in the message of the hour I think we must realize that there's a lot of land yet to possess uh we have to be careful to not become complacent and to say that where we have come and what we have that this is all of it and this is as far as it can go or this as much as can happen but I do believe that there is a lot I believe there's a lot left for the church I believe there is higher Heights I believe that there is more powerful moments and I believe the spirit of God has great things for us as Christians in the New Testament our possession is a spiritual land and the thing about the land is amen of course that there is borders to the land that God gave us he gave us the word but the depths of that word word have yet to be discovered the levels of this message have yet not even opened in the places that God can take us and and if you want if you start studying you get this cuz you'll start studying you'll think my we've got that studied out and then the holy spirit will open another level to it you'll go oh my I didn't even know that was there and then it'll just keep going and keep going because inspiration amen the inspiration never ends and I I thank the Lord this morning to know that this is a time but I'll say this this this season that we're living is also a season of possession this is the season to possess the promises of God now U it is very uh real to us that God would make the promises but yet if you if you're studying the Book of Joshua you realize that these people were moving into promises that was made to Abraham and God said Abraham he gave him that land but you know it's it's not till you read the book of Acts the seventh chapter that you begin to realize that Abraham never possessed the land that he was promised he was only had the promise of it but the Bible said he never possessed possessed any of it but he only had the promise of possession but that it became the Seed of Abraham that received the benefits of what was promised unto Abraham and then later they moved into it it's it's the same uh reality to us that when Paul was here that Apostle Paul made these promises that was in the in the book of Ephesians and the book of Thessalonians in the book of Corinthians and he made promises uh let's just say he looked out there and said there there will come a time that there will be in the moment of the twinkling of an eye there will be a change and there will be a translation now we know he made that promise to the Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church did not possess that promise uh he made that promise under the Thessalonian church but the Thessalonians never possessed that promise amen but yet we know that this is the season today of when God will be moving the church into the possession of those things that this is the season of rapture and it's always amazed me that God would call one man to make a promise to him and then he would call another man to possess the promise he made under those people and to recognize as Abraham SE that this is not the age amen of writing the Bible this is not the age even of us standing here this morning and God just making promises to us but this actually is the season when the promises that had been made to every age have come to a climax and it will be fulfilled in this age amen for us to sit here this morning as a generation and believe that God has fulfilled everything and there's nothing left for us and there's there's nothing to possess and there's nothing else for us to do amen would put us in a state of of complacency it would put us in a state amen that there's no reason for prayer there's no reason to press on there's no reason to study there's no reason to have meetings amen but I believe there is much land yet to possess I believe that there is corners of this message that we've not TR out yet I believe there's possessions that can be given to the church amen that you have not experienced personally yet amen you've read about people that done it you've thought about it and you've heard the testimonies but it's available to every believer this morning and I believe amen personally that there is oppositions against this I I believe the enemy would put all kinds of oppositions he would put discouragement and and he would put Walt cities and he would put rivers and he would put Giants and there would be great oppositions to it but there is a people who's going to possess it anyhow because it's the anointing on their life to possess the promises of God you actually were born for this season and God prophesied of this season and we are the seed of this season I I've heard people say it yes one day it's going to happen well let me ask ask you when is that day if we believe that Russia is ramping up and and Israel and Hamas is ramping up and all of the world is coming together for great cataclysmic destruction as the Bible prophesied of Amen the season is upon us that the people that are living in this time now may I say this I believe we're the last generation of that Gentile church and the promises that have been made have been made to us and no matter the opposition that we are facing I believe that it's a moment in time that we are to press through I think we ought to lay aside every weight I think we ought to lay aside every Affliction I believe we ought to lay aside everything every excuse that we have and God can't use us and God can't do this and God can now I believe it's time to lay it aside and realize that yes we can I believe we ought to join Joshua and Caleb this morning and yes we can possess these promises I don't know how we're going to do it but yes he can I don't know how it's going to happen but he still Jehovah Gyra he is still the god of Abraham he's still a god of Joshua he's still the god of William ra he's still a God Amen of Paul and the alans he's still the god you recognize God Still Remains to be God and we are his children this morning and I believe we can move into these prises amen that we are the children amen of the pro promise and this is the season of the promise and I believe it's time to redeem the time that God has gave us amen I think it's time to quit pushing it off to another season and realize that we are the we are the leadership in this age it's time to quit looking for an example be the example quit looking for a leader be the leader you're looking for someone to look up to be the person they are looking up to it's the season for it it's the season where our young people can rise up and they can lead other young people they can make Believers and they can look around and say that's the way I want to live my life that's the way I want to be you don't have to sit here this morning and try to can I preach for our young people a minute you don't have to look around in this life and look at the worldly side and try to think about how amen how is it I can impress them and how can I be and how you're never going to impress the world you're never going to fit into the world so quit D and down what God gave you and rise up and shine like you never been he God Made You different so be different if God made you a separate people then be a separate people but be the greatest people you can be and then make people stand back and say oh my what an example of Christianity what an example of the grace of God we are here this morning and it doesn't matter the opposition I I believe that there's a lot of prophecies that are coming together there must be an evisions to this there must be a moving into this this seven seal book has opened and somebody's going to move into it this has been predicted Amen to happened it has happened and now somebody's moving into it I actually believe that we are the age of the Overcomer of the lean book I believe that somebody will overcome in this age every opposition and they will do it by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony I believe there are people here this morning that has been given the word of God for the season that we're living in and this word will defeat Satan anywhere any time in any form Satan is in and if if our faith will hold on to it Satan will never stand before the church now here's the thing your faith will only go as high as your adherence to the word of God because if you say brother Wayne I don't have faith this morning I don't have possession faith faith has a source and faith has a resting place the source of faith is the word of God you're never going to get Faith to overcome Giants watching TNT and ABC and CBS and CNN and yes Fox News amen it is a deteriation of your faith when you said and bring garbage into your heart am it tears down the faith that God has given you you said brother I I I feel like I'm nearly empty of Faith it's because what you're feeding on is not the word of God but if you feeding on the word of God that will a faith in your life and you begin to believe things that you never believe and imposses become possible and Giants become become possible for you to walk over mountains can be moved Rivers can be crossed walls can drop down because you're built for the opposition you are built for the age you are built for the anointing you are prophesied over to this age listen I know there's a lot going on but you have been prophesied in this generation that there would come an understanding I know people they look at the Bible and they look at the message they say well amen that stuff's too deep and I don't know if I can understand but do you recognize God was waiting on you to bring this word why did God not bring it in the early year years why did not God bring it in the Dark Ages why did God not I'll tell you what the prophet said about it he said he was waiting for a people to comprehended so you were built with an ability to understand things that are un misunderstood you were built with an ability to comprehend the greatest Mysteries that have ever been given to the age and it's not that they're not comprehendable the fact is that nobody's had the heart to just believe it like God gave to you I don't I don't mean amen the whole world couldn't do it but when God gave you something in your heart the Bible said he that have an ear let him hear now the teaching of this message would positionally placed but your faith adheres to the word you believe and the only place word can the only place faith can rest is on the foundation of the word if you try to put Faith anywhere else you're going to lose that faith in the future cuz Ming beasting your everything's going to change that's one thing that we can promise you change is coming change is coming I don't care who you are I don't care where you live change is coming your way to to be able to adapt to change is how we live right we have to adapt to changing TI we have to adapt Everything Changes humans change the worlds change our families change our lives change but there is something that never changed and that is the word of the Living God our lord Jesus said that heavens and earth can pass away but my word will never pass away then I would rather be standing on the word of God and standing in the heavens cuz the heavens can fall but the word of God can never fall and man that builds his life upon the word as a solid foundation and there's no devil can move there's no oppositions that can overcome him do you see what it is it is a position and what we're under in this age now I I think that it's powerful to see it what you're under is you're under a prophetic anointing now you you you have to realize that you're under a prophetic anointing right that you have been anointed by prophecy now if you if you just take this and realize people said well some people's under the law and some people's under this Paul said we are under grace right and that Grace being a prophetic word that was spoke over you there is some things that are greater than who you are now I I I just was studying the other day but man talks about purpose and God makes you for a purpose Paul says that everything was done for purpose Ephesians amen now if you watch the book of Ephesians Paul is all about purpose right everybody says there's a purpose but finally we know what the purpose is and that purpose when God makes a man for that you say well brother Wayne what about my what about my sovereign will what about my free will that's what's got you in all the trouble your choices is what got you in the trouble you're but the Sovereign God has made another Choice with your life and sometime or another you're going to begin to move into the sovereignty and the plan of almighty God which is greater than your choices which is greater than you are there is something over your life that is greater than you are and that is the word of the Living God and let me just show you in the scriptures and if you watch this watch this watch this Le the see of age you go there and says it's miserable wretched blind and naked right amen now now if you want to see the scriptures somebody holds the interpretation of that scripture walk right here in the streets and stand and walk watch prophecy walk by you naked miserable they don't even know that they need God right having need of nothing is that right this what you need no I don't need nothing can't tell them nothing can't give them nothing they don't need nothing they got everything now now watch the prophecy of that scripture watch what Paul says in the book of Timothy he and high minded and LS of Pleasures more than the of God false accusers aen you goes right down the line if you want to see a modern generation read the book of Timothy and see what he has to say about it if you want to see the modern Church look at the lardan church and you'll see what you're looking at but this was written 2,000 years ago and that prophecy is falling on a generation and they're walking in the prophecy whether they want to or not but there is another Prophecy in the Bible it says I don't have a church it'll be without spot I don't have a bride Church AR is prophecy laid over the lives of Believers today that prophecy is going to come can I say this the Bible says that Jesus himself says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of and there sodomites everywhere I know it's not popular preaching anymore and remember our government has made it legal for them to have samex marriages we we we got to have government issues over our bathrooms whether they're male or female or by genders or how many other genders and we got the lbq to and they they just never quit amen and and so Mo amen what what are you saying I'm not trying to be mean to anybody I'm trying to tell you that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom and watch how Sodom has come right here it's 4,000 years ago but Sodom is right here here again because Jesus said as it was in the days of s now now if God don't destroy this America for it's Sodom and the way it's with he'll have to raise up Sodom and gomorra and apologize now watch this because the prophecy is there look sodomy is there it's it's there it's everywhere it's in our law it's in our in our y'all bear with me it's everywhere now watch it's exactly where he said it would be as it was in the days of Noah he also said it and it's exactly where he said it would be what was in the days of Noah the sons of God looked upon the daughters of men amen and look at the world we're living in now amen and at the same time amen the scripture said every man's mind was upon evil amen look at the world we're living now there's so many levels of evil and media used to people used to just think you but there were barriers they wouldn't cross amen there was there was things they couldn't get over but all the barriers are gone now and the atmosphere of this age is everything's free do do whatever you think do whatever you feel well let me tell you this as a Believer some things you think and feel just ain't right amen and there ought to be a barrier on our lives there ought to be a barrier of the word of God that puts a life into action but the reason the world is where it's at is because the Bible said it would go there now God couldn't lead them there they had to turn down the truth the Bible said amen that they had not enough for the truth I know everybody's talking about love now but I'm going to preach cuz it's here everybody's talking about love now everything's love everybody love everybody love everybody and I believe God loves everybody right amen but there must be a love for truth that's greater than your love for this world if you don't love the truth over that you love the world then you ain't got no place with God Jesus said if the love of this world is in your heart then the love of my father is not in you so there's definitely two different kinds of love right and they got they just keep going and keep going and keep going and everybody gets so broadminded the brain just fell out amen nobody can stand up for anything anymore now I'm preaching to you because everything's in its position the Bible said you got to know the difference between truth and the spirit of error because there's two Spirits leading in the day we are not leading ourselves humans are not leading themselves there is a spirit leading you and either it's the spirit of God or it's the spirit of the devil and the devil is leading people into a mass destruction but don't tell me that the devil has the power am to put this world in the shape of to him but my God don't have the power to put the b in the Rapture in the last days tribulation w't put us in the rapture it's the power of God that puts us in and I say the god of Abraham is here leading the church today to possess the lands that he has made unto them we are under the grace of God there is an anointing Upon Our Lives amen amen the secrets of David David's great anointing and David's great secret of overcoming a giant amen was not that he was a mighty man it was that he had a heart after God but the real secret of David is he was chosen David was chosen above his brother he was the last BN but God has the ability to take the last born and give him the RS of the first BN God showed us that he can cross somebody's hands and lay the blessing of the one you don't think should be blessed but when God enots a man it don't matter who likes him or who don't when the blessing of Abram comes upon the blessing is there I love how God sent a prophet into s's house I just laugh because even the prophet want to go in there and anoint the tallest brother he want anoint the best choice man Samuel maybe Standing There He Man Jesse start pointing out puto on that one he he's a good boy put it on him amen and Old Samuel started to pour the anointing lord said no don't go on him all right amen walks over they pick another one amen try to put the anointing on him the anointing wouldn't fall on none of them amen they couldn't put it on them amen but but finally Samuel said I'm here to anoint a king there must be another son there must be somebody else amen and that's when they said well there's one more and he's out in the field watching the Sheep the last choice that Jesse had the last his own daddy didn't even choose him his brothers didn't choose him nobody chose him but God chose him and I tell you this God has went through seven angels just like the seven son of but there's one more there's one more as a bride who has the anointing of God in the last days and the prophet stood and ped the anointing over this church all Seven Seals were dumped out on this church my word is spirit and his life and it was dumped over this drve church and that's the secret behind us that's why we can destroy Giants that's why we can rise up in the morning in the midst of all trouble and we can lift our hands and we can say the Lord is Our Shepherd and I sh my wall he making me to lie down he all he's with me even in The Valleys of the Shadows of death because the anointing is upon listen when that anointing comes upon you it's an anointing that is commanded toward your life David's power was transferred to him by Pro prophetic anointing yeah it was transferred by prophetic anointing what happened in that little room between a prophet and a little boy changed his entire future and it made God himself say thy Throne on David I will establish forever oh my goodness with the anointing of God I I don't know about y'all but I love it when you just get in that little room and that prophetic anointing it starts resting and and all of a sudden you start realizing that you're under something different you're under something different see God's Prophet claims a generation for the Fulfillment of his words God's Prophet God's word will claim a generation this message will claim a people for its fulfillment those people are ordained to fulfill it and here's the beauty if you look at it I always liked it how if you go back in Ezekiel and you watch Ezekiel chapter 37 and you watch how Ezekiel standing on the valley and he's looking at a valley of dry bones it's it's a pretty good read and if you look at it it it it's it's actually just an impossible situation and God looks at him and he says to him he said he said son of man can these folks live and I love how Ezekiel Danes M said Lord down know I don't know I don't know I don't know if there can be life in them looks like dry bones but if you're asking there must be a reason you're asking Lord thou knowest and I love how God responds to the prophet he said prophesy thou son of man and these bones shall live and I love how that the LIE could come to dead bones by prophecy by the uttered prophetic word things that don't live and have no ability to live is about to live I love how he says it when he comes up and and Ezekiel looks over the valley of D Dry Bones who had no hope of Resurrection at all and he looks upon them and he said oh ye Dry Bones hear ye the word of the Lord hear ye the word of the Lord watch Faith cometh by hearing the word of the Lord right leadership and obedience come by hearing of the word here's my problem a bone and ear don't a a a a a skeleton don't have an ear amen that that matter of fact your ear ain't even bone it's it's actually carage just some bones down in there but it's actually cartilage and he told them to hear you the word of the Lord how could they hear how could they hear how how was it there was no ability within them to hear and respond but when God commands a word toward a generation and then that word will command a lie to respond when it doesn't you can look at that same life and say there's no hope for them you can look at the same situation and say that marriage is done you can say oh that church is finished oh that family's over oh this is over here but there is a word that is command a the church it no matter what comes that prophecy will hold a command over that life and I tell you when God commands a blessing to with someone it is an irrevocable blessing well we might as well preach since we're here it is an irrevocable blessing amen I don't care what anybody says they can't remove the blessing that God has blessed somebody when God blesses you you're blessed when God blesses you you're blessed can I tell you who's got the blessing he said blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears who they hearen the word of God is your blessing and what God has blessed there is no man can curse because the blessing is upon Him everybody's going to look at you different everybody's going to look at the church different everybody's going to look at the people different and we we we we know how we know how B looked at the church right and B tried to hire him Amen to cural but it didn't work because when B went to B and said come here and curse these people amen he took them out to you know bam got moved three different times from three different angles to see the problems of Israel because B and B are talking B said says to en curse these people and and Bam comes back he said well look he said I I'm trying to he said but there's no am of witchery there's no there's no sorcery there's there's nothing I can do to to curse these people because God has blessed these people he said well go out there and curse them anyhow and pay locks out there and he looks at the children of Israel and he's going to curse them and he says oh how Godly of th T J amen because God couldn't see what B saw amen when when bam he he changes in three different locations right he takes him in in three different areas to try to get bam to agree that these people need curses and and and the scriptures is beautiful because when they when they get into these areas they all need something I don't have time to preach on this morning but it's amazing to me because from three different areas bam keeps seeing problem and V keep seeing problems amen but you know what's amazing is God never saw what they saw but they never saw what God saw and then and let me tell you this who's going to win the argument if God sees one thing man sees another God is the one it matters what God sees I tell you what my said he said God he said bam saw everything that could be done under the calar I guess he meant about every Wicked work was in Israel about everything you can think of but said morally he said it was a horrible situation he said but Bam could see the moral problem but he couldn't see that slitting rock over there and he couldn't see that Pillar of Fire and he couldn't hear can you imagine he couldn't hear he could hear the problems he could hear fa but he couldn't hear the shout of the king I was in that camp the word of God was among him I tell you what I pray this morning amen that we're able to see what God sees about the Church of the Living God and know this that now the reason I'm saying this is Baum amen was trying to stop Moses from going in the promised land he was on this road so what they were trying to do was stop the progress but you'll never stop the progress of God's church because God has made a way when there is no way I say what it looked different from where B was standing and where B was standing and when the word of God comes to your generation it is a prophetic anointing that cannot be broken a blessing that cannot be revoked amen a blessing that you cannot take away from him amen listen here's here's a beautiful thing Lazarus was already dead Lazarus was already dead he was past helping himself he was amen the way we say today well if they can't help theel then we can't help them amen they won't even help theel so we won't help them Lazarus couldn't help himself Lazarus was dead in the Tomb but the master amen the very God in heaven stood in the Tomb and said laes come forth amen and though a man lay Dead four days in the grave corruption couldn't hold it amen trouble couldn't hold it because the master should come out of the gra I tell you this morning the message of the hour came to you you in the up you and they said they'll never make it but there was a voice of the master said come out of there my people and the death Clos with put it on and there was a resurrection in your life you couldn't help yourself but the message called you what is this overwhelming what is this overwhelming feeling yes sir you know I one of my favorite scriptures in the entire Bible is when Jesus looked at his disciples and he said you didn't choose me yeah I chose you now one of my favorite pastimes one of them is fishing and you know one thing I found out about fish I never we all my fish a lot now I caught caught Big 10 pounder last fall a real nice fish got him up on the boat brother Tom he didn't roll over look at me and say I finally did it I finally caught me a fisherman because fish don't catch fisherman we caught the fish it's about like you looking at God and saying I finally made it I finally got you I finally sought you till I got everything I need it's not you singing God it's God seeking you it's not you choosing God it's God choosing you I pray it to you the very desire in your heart to have more of God is because God gave it to you there's a million people walking in this place right now it has no desire at all for a relationship with Jesus Christ but God put something in you to make you turn aside and come to his word and made it it's because it wasn't you choosing him it's him choosing you and he chose you for salvation and you shout in but he also chose you to possess the land I promise that we are end the season God CH you you can rise above your fears you can rise above the uping of others to move into the word of God I say this to you this morning on this beautiful Sunday morning we're sitting here in Branson Missouri amen we're a long ways away from the East Coast can you imagine if our early PGM fathers who landed at Plymouth Rock would have said this is a wonderful land and this is as far as we go oh where would we be this morning all if our early Pilgrim fathers would have said we have found clth Rock and we have reached the potential of this new land wouldn't it be something if that's where they set up and they made their camps and they said that's as far as we're going but there was something in there that knew better they knew there was a frontier out there they knew there was a horizon and they were Savage they were Savage people only it there were people that's going to die the snakes were going to be bit by people they were going to be eaten by wild beast there was bears in that Land There was every kind of opposition in this United States of America but there was something coming to the hearts and those early P fathers that they wanted to be able to possess whatever laid over that hill and you know what they did they didn't stay at clth Rock they begin to press in no matter the oppositions and if you're if you're a history student you'll you'll hear the word Manifest Destiny that was what they actually called what happened to them early fathers that made them leave their homes they left all they knew and went out into a land they didn't know they didn't know what was going to happen they didn't know what was going to take place now you got to make up your mind either you stay in the safety of denomination you stay in the safety of a certain click in the message you stay in the safety of that when you go out into the land you go out into the promises of God you get out into that land there a there a million men this morning amen that wish they had have not listened to everybody else and moved out there but there was some men that were so possessed with Manifest Destiny that they had nothing they could do it was like a it was like a it was like a sickness that come upon me brother it was it was an what word am I looking for with them right what was that word amen they were Afflicted they were actually afflicted by it I like that word they were actually afflicted by the idea I got to get in this land it was an Affliction on them amen and and and I I love it because you know you think about sicknesses but you know while back we were talking to one of the brothers and he gave me a letter amen of of the early right brothers when they got ready to fly and you know what they said they said they they said we have been afflicted by the desire to get in the air Amen in other words they couldn't even have normal relationships they couldn't have a normal evening they couldn't sit out at the supper table and just enjoy their family there was an Affliction on them that they were to get in the air there was an airplane age coming and they had to get in the air that was an Affliction that was a manifest that was pushing their lives and so has there been a manifest destiny of the predestination of God that we Afflicted with the lessons of the hour it's an Affliction upon us we can not stay for some reason I not satisfied some reason you're not satisfied some reason that you're not satisfied with just a little sermon a little Bible story for some reason that you've not just been able to join some cold dead formal religion and just s there but something in your heart you know there's a living God you know there's a reality and said my oh God after a living God and any man that has ever come in contact with a living God no way can you return back to the IDS and the formality of a church service just coming and sing and being a part amen amen there's more land to possess than that there there there's levels of worship that we've never reached I we going to a certain point and then everybody wants to pull back cuz they're afraid they're going to go too far the prophet said we are to worship and we don't even know our name we want to drink of the wine of Revelation till we get some lost in worship until the spirit of God and take over our life and we can have communion under worship I believe I believe worship I believe the truth of God we break out our lives there's a manifest destiny in your life there's something makes you pick them books up that's right for some reason there's a lot of people in this world that had never felt what you feel about it sometimes we think it's afflictions now y'all know R prayed that that wouldn't happen to him no more he literally went to a a cave and prayed for days and said Lord take this thing from me it's like an Affliction yeah cuz his brothers wouldn't get in they wouldn't they wouldn't they wouldn't believe this it was the devil so to stay with Brotherhood he would he was ready to but but he couldn't it was like an [Music] Affliction and that's that's exactly what has caught your life and there's some reason that you are propelled forward into the world thank you Lord every one of you sitting here this morning have come to a spot in your life of discouragement of cataclysm destructions of situations that have just so intermingled and that's the place you wanted to set out that's the place that hurts so bad you don't know how to take another step it the situation was so rough you're having a hard time believing there's Hope For Tomorrow amen because of the situations that are laying there you're saying that but let me assure you there's sunlight on the other side of the Hill there's sunlight on the other side of the Hill can can I preach a little bit amen it's like a little chicken that's in an egg amen you can't you can't break the chicken out of the egg or he'll die if he does survive he's so weak that his children amen will be weak Breakers as well they get weaker and weaker and weaker with these Generations but you got to let a chicken break out of its own egg amen but God gave it what it needed in the egg when when the chicken's going to get out of the egg everything it needs is in there already and you know how he breaks out he breaks out by his beak there's a little there's a little beak there and that's the way he breaks out of that egg and he has to do it himself he has to break out of it and in his little mind maybe it's dark and he's thinking I don't know what's out there I don't know what's going to happen I don't I there's all kinds of fears amen but but listen amen there's something inside him that he can't just sit down in the egg and say this is all there is to life but something inside since you got to press against it you got to press against it you got to press against it and after a little while he keeps beating until there's a little hole pierced and he sticks his head out and goes oh my goodness there is so many more things to [Music] life there is so much more to this [Applause] message you know the beauty the beauty the beauty of nature is nature is Bible itself right that's right the beauty of Nature and nature is the only thing that agrees with Christianity no other religion actually is witnessed by Nature itself but nature actually Witnesses and this is powerful to me because because it's it's a very simple way for me to catch things but you realize uh that when a when a cacom when he's at a certain stage in his life that he has to progress or he never becomes a mfag and his Destiny is a motherfly but he's got to progress right he's got to now maybe maybe maybe a maybe a caterpillar would say to himself you know what I like being caterpillar and I I don't I don't really I I'm scared of heights and and I'm and I'm scared of I'm scared of Dark Places and I'm scared of all the calls and I'm scared of these loud services and but but there's actually something in him that that forces him forward to a cocoon there's actually a thus sayith the Lord over his life you you recognize the one that created him knows his Destiny when he don't know his Destiny and this this is powerful to me he can't stay a caterpiller because he was never created a caterpillar God didn't create caterpillar he created butterflies he did not create Fallen Sons God did not create Sinners he created adopted Sons so whatever stage you're in you're on your way to a full sunship that's what God saw you has as full sunship and you're walking along the path and all of a sudden you like the stage you're in you like the fellowship you like the people amen and you say to yourself well this be nice to settle here cuz I'm afraid of the future amen but there's something that God has created you foren that makes you press on anyhow it's thus sayith the Lord you're going to move on anyhow because because it's an absolute truth over your life I was preaching like this in India one time and uh and while I while I was preaching I was actually talking about the absolute power of God over the life of humanity now now it's it's an absolute power over his children and when I was preaching that way brother West I comeing into a school where reminds me at this place a little bit except it was a little deeper but it was about it was this type of thing but the walls behind me was solid amen and and it was was a school room of Hindus and that's the school room they had boards on the wall behind you but they wasn't frame pictures they were just posters and the India they had a lot of posters and these posters they had these posters and and some of them were of the Hindu gods and anybody who's ever seen H gods they are ugly man I mean they got some ugly Gods if I was going to draw my own God I'd at least put some beauty to her something but but they're ugly gods and they had their posters up there we're in the school room and I said to the brothers when we come in I said Brothers I'm I'm going to preach the gospel cuz you take them things down and you know it's going to be behind me and they said no sorry brother man it's a Hindu school it's a Hindu government and said we can use it to preach but we can't touch anything they have said you got to leave it alone I said all right so I'm preaching right along and I come up with the absolute authority of God's word and there was a lady sitting kind of in the back she was about halfway back on the aisle and she just fell out into the in the middle of the aisle she just out and she started ring I don't know if you ever seen any of them uh uh films or pictures of people with exorcism but that's exactly what she looked like she was just kind of baled up the floor she was it it was a horrible sight and and I just young preacher but until I didn't know what to do with it I never like that you're in America amen but when I seen it I remember the scripture where it said there in Timothy preach the word so I thought I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm just keep preaching the word and just I kept preaching and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit quieted me and he said pray for the woman so I stopped and I said hey everybody bow your heads the brothers kind of s in the back and I said Would You Walk put your hand on the sister I said let's all begin to pray together and as we started praying and we started praying the Holy Spirit began to move and and I felt I felt a real peace coming through me just a real real real solid atmosphere and when I raised my head I was going to go right back into that same word I was just going to keep preaching the same thing I've been preaching and when I started to say something all of a sudden I heard myself say Amen if that woman don't raise up out of the floor that God is not even God and I almost covered my mouth cuz I thought what a crazy thing for a man to say God's God whatever you know but I said that when when I said it all of a sudden brother brother Tom there was literally like a fog settled in that room and there was people sitting the the ministers that day about probably 25 30 pastors sitting there and they were s off to my ride and you you couldn't hardly see them for the fog and they told me they couldn't see me and all that was just a fog settled in that room and when that fog settled in all of a sudden a wind started blowing and that woman got up out of the floor and starts waving her hands and holling well all of a sudden it just starts going across the congregation and people starts coming in the spirit of God they start hauling Hallelujah and Glory you can just hear it all over the congregation and this wind starts whipping and when this comes in the room brother Jake it takes those posters right off of that wall and and and those posters are lone that woman is standing up and it was the power of God that that that woman couldn't help the god of creation was in the to give help that same God is still in this morning God got more that's a greater possession that's a greater things for life you got to walk on it don't matter what is happening to you you better walk on let me say this to you he let the sun come up this morning didn't it you know you can't stop that sun but you would be better try to stop the Sun from shining and to stop a son or daughter of God from coming to this world there'll be no stop there'll be no sto your confession I just she will possess promise she will go into every manifestation and God the favor of the Lord sits above me and it is the Zeal of the Lord that will perform these things this Ain what we can do ourselves come on church when the Lord came unto Mary he said Mary thou found favor with God and thou shall have a child amen and she said well I don't know how I'm going to do it he said the power of the Lord shall overshadow me that's why it was said in Isaiah the Zeal of the Lord will perform these things this is not your doing this is God is looking for a surrenderance from our There's A Jero in front of you on the other side of Jero there is a l fall there is power and Grace you know what happens I'm not you know what happens amen what happens is is when God opens the doors to it it's to you it's up to you to go in and get it I say this if you never heard it I thought it was years ago I Lord spoke to me on something I thought it pretty neat there's Walmart down here is it can you imagine if all the way to the meeting I went by to Walmart and paid for everything in the store I just bought the whole store out and I come out here and I said to you this morning I just bought Walmart and I'm giving it to you you can say here and rejoice that you own that but until you go into that store and pick it up off of the Shelf it's not your personal possession and the blood of Jesus has bought every promise in this book belongs to you but until you claim it for yourself it is not your personal possession and that's why he said Joshua you're going to have to walk out this land every step you take is going to be your possession and every step the church makes it's going to be possession amen I I think pretty good CU he y Walmart folk y'all come from M Ridge and lot of you lot of you been around M Ridge man but it's funny as Jake now you probably get this been sassin to but now on rge lived there 40 years and I can walk the door I can't get 10 foot in the door cuz you met Susie and you met John you met Jill and over here's this I went to school with these people know all these people and you s busy talk you know but you know something funny about war you got to go on in the story you you can't stop at the front door because the good stuff's in the [Music] back the computer if you ever notice that all the all the expensive stuff the guns where they at back corner Sporting Goods is it's far from the doors they get it cuz they don't want somebody to grab and run it's all the way in the back where's them where's them Big Apple Computers you know they big ones they home screen touches they big ones they're in the back wall and they up high but if somebody just told you you know the Apple computer you're wantan it's yours just go get it and you get down to Walmart brother and you finally get to the back wall and you look it ain't on the first shelf you look way up oh there it is now do you think there's a you think there's a woman in this room that's going to turn around and walk out them doors and say I couldn't reach you not one you know what she's going to do she going to go over to the management say hey bud my computer's up there give me a ladder and if you got to get on a ladder you're going to get on a ladder because you want to get one the those and some of the promises that God had made is on the top sh of the message of the hour but we can get a lder this morning and know to climing up take and R by R listen we are not just on one R in this L this is not limited to this is the tree of life now everybody knows the world's on the tree of knowledge right look at them climb brother look at them climb this AI automated cars I talked to Tesla the other day about buying one of the Teslas they said for $112,000 we'll give you a a an option in our car that you can put the you can put the address in and as long as you're in the driver's seat it'll take you where you want to go they said matter of fact when you get there if you're at the mall and your car's a couple hundred yards away you can just push a button and it'll come pick you up they're crawling up the tree of knowledge look what they're doing in medical science take your heart out and put it back in your body they can take somebody else's heart and put it in your body they can they got so many different things they can do now for your eyes and for your body look at the Medical Science look just went right up the charts can you imagine if Medical Science in the 1970s when said we know all there is to know about what if 1970s if the board of Medical Science said it's too dangerous to go any further we know all there is to know and let's just Camp right here there's people sit that this fi wouldn't be with us this morning if they did that you would never got that surgery amen they went through her side amen and replaced a vow in her heart because somebody knew that was greater gra there was higher Heights there's going to do for Humanity and they crawled up the tree of knowledge they didn't get old one Li and stay there I preaching to you but we're not climbing the tree of knowledge we're climbing the tree of life and there's more lims on this tree come on Church the prophet God said my this he said when they brought back the grapes from the promised land and Joshua and Caleb come bringing those grapes in they had to pack them you know he brother brother said they showed the evidence of Those Grapes can you imagine if they would have just took the grapes and said that's all we want but see the graes wasn't the point they own the land and come out of can you imagine if the church comes up to the gifts of the Spirit and say this is where we're going to stop this is all there is to it listen that's just where the church started come on Luther had to progress amen Wesley picked up Luther's message and progressed and the Pentecost was picked up with the Wesley un stopped and the method is stop but the but the Pentecostal said there's more of God and they broke into the spiritual gift but can you imagine today if that's as far as we're going to go into gifts and spiritual things like that amen but listen there was more coming and God had another limb on the tree and the word that was in the beginning was going to come to the end and there would come a you in possession and having every promise and God is made no I'm not stopping on one Le I'm not to get on predestination and that's all we can preach I'm not going to get on gifts and that's all we can preach I'm not going to get on sh and that's all we can preach there the tree of the up this tree everything on this tree belongs to [Applause] me nor are you going to take the gifts or the sh or the rejoicing away from me because it belongs to me [Applause] [Music] personally can you imagine this morning if we had to have this meeting on CL Rock because our forefathers decided that's all there is to have but somebody sir had to believe there's more can you imagine if we come to a place of this message where we think this is all it is we've got everything this is all we got what we have is all we need we don't need to study our Bibles we don't need to study the message we do not need to pray we do not need to attend churches all we need to do is get together but somebody [Music] believed they told Brother brand all these Supernatural things has happen in your life from the devil can you imagine if he would have accept that who would we be this morning so Supernatural starts happening in a Ministry in a life and when somebody comes wrong it may be some jealousy talking you don't want that Supernatural no so then they start say well that's the devil and this is to so what's what's it what's it designed to do it's designed to get you to stop don't progress anybody Cody have you ever been down to the uh you've been down to the convenience store and you walk in and it says no you ever wonder why it's because of count $100 bill but isn't it odd that some people just can't tell the difference or don't want to take the time so they just say no h and there's certain places now no gifts it's because of the fal but I think that gifts are valuable enough that we should take time and divide the TR from the false people worship moves into a church the power of God flies across and maybe there's a hypocrite involved well God bless them they're enjoying church that's about probably all they're going to [Music] get they ain't had the grace to live the way you're living okay but but but are you seeing but but then somebody said we don't want none of that in here it's because they seen somebody that wasn't right do it so now it's all false so all of a sudden you can't you can't progress Rest In Worship because somebody did it wrong come amen so so we look at this and see so somebody they they got into the seven Thunders and taught them and they got him wrong but all of a sudden we're not supposed to teach about it somebody got into adoption and they taught it wrong so all of a sudden you can't talk about it but I'm not going to quit talking about the message that is a promise in this message and the inhabitance of this message belongs to you I don't care how many people are imitating how many false stents having any troubles I was not designed to put my eyes on the wrong thing I was designed to look at the promises of God and call pres and say it's absolutely true so brother way don't you see the same things we see I do I I actually do I see some the same things maybe maybe because of the anointing I may see it a little clearer even than you do sometimes and I see something behind something that maybe other people ain't even seen it yet and won't see it for a while but you know what I'm I'm I'm Abraham and stock amen I have been born to the Holy Spirit and Abraham looked at things and called them as they were not so he can call things that are as they were real and David let's just get David for an example in the scripture David is standing there looking at a valley of enemies there's a Philistines they're there he sees them plainly but you know what God instructs him to do he stru him wait on me before you go down there and fight that he said what am I supposed to do meanwhile Lord just watch them and the Lord said you watch them mberry trees right there and when they begin to move then you know you're supposed to go in the battle so you know what he did brother Mark he turned his back to the enemy and he quit watching them he quit listening to them he on qu texting he Fellowship listen I don't have time for negative things I some trouble or some negativity keep it I don't even want to hear it I got my mind on something else got on Victory I got mind on the pro of God there will be somebody who will turn their back to the things of the world and say God I'm watching you they said watching naturally waiting for the Winds of the mberry tree to blow because then they knew they could move into the battle and God has so anointed the church all right now amen there are more promises yeah there are more blessings yes there are more things to have but you got to be willing to Mo you can't stop one take you take somebody first get save they get a testimony they tell you the testimony but it's going to take more than a testimony to survive true you got to start [Music] eating somebody testify to you I got to heal with certain certain but if you quit eating after you get heal then your lack of eating is going to be a greater problem than the problem you have when you get so God can heal you you got a testimony but you got to eat you got to eat the word strength so I believe as a brother R said like this I believe we have untapped resources in I believe there's places that we've not tapped into I believe there is anointings in the spoken word that we have just touched the iceberg you just touched the tip of what God has and the blessing he and I'm going to tell you why I say that cuz the prophet of God said you are unlimited and if you got limits on God this morning you got the wrong God take the limits off of God and then you can take the limits off of yourself and realize that if a man can believe it anything is possible amen all things are possible to them that believe the spoken word has just come into existence that's right amen throughout the entire history of the church it's not been with us but in the last days here it comes and do you think that we should just stop at the water well brother man did that back there but it's not available today I don't think we ought to stop it this morning I don't think we ought to put up ourselves and say this is as far as we can go and this is as much as can be done I believe that are promises and possessions we have not yet obtained we must move forward can our musicians come hey man I know I I could go a while a got good started but you but you recognize that we have come to that place and and on your own I know you're going to come into oppositions I know that already but you have been given power to buy yes sir you can literally Buy me and brother Andrew was talking this morning he was pointing out to me that preached the Paradox this very day back in 61 and it's when he talks about he was up on the road with a mama and he said that Mama was trying to kill him he said he couldn't do it cuz God wasn't done with him remember he said that youve been give power to exercise over this and anything Bel that's right and brother man to prophesy and he said Satan I bind you in the name of the Lord that serent serent lost its power I believe this morning we have been given power to life that's true and I believe I believe the spoken word can bind I believe it can bind the situations that the S would put against the church against people and when you're trying to progress in the word and Satan is right there to stop you what you just have to do is you have to come to this point in your life that you have to say to Satan Satan you are a liar you have to come to that reality that Jesus said Paul said that through Christ we can do all things and when it come to that point you don't have to stop where Satan says stop there are things we' not yet possessed I believe I believe this I believe that this is the season fulfill sorry I have about three quotes I believe this is the season I want take thank you for coming I want to thank you say God bless you love you and I'd like to pray for you this morning I'd like to pray God anoint you and bless you today and give you Mercy maybe somebody here said well wait I don't want to stop I want to go [Music] on even with two leading SS in the of [Music] early and he said I so as you start getting a little say well it's all finished up you're alled up now God
