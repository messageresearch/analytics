we'll give you the glory for all you do in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen how many say Amen to that amen I won't you just turn in the Bible to the Book of Joshua and we're going to read out of out of the the first chapter in the first verse Joshua the first chapter and the first verse give you just a moment to get there and I just been enjoying the presence of the Lord amen amen how many come to have church amen we just love our Wednesday night services and I know in the old days back before I was even born they used to call them the Wednesday night prayer meetings that's you know that kind of everybody come together and and have those kind of services in the midweek and but just we just have a wonderful group of people that love to come in the middle of the week I know some can't be here that want to be and so we don't ever want to put them down I know they really want to be here so we just thank Lord for opening us up a door to be able to come and just encouraging to come and and and just be encouraged in the middle of the week I know some of you work and it's just a lot of pressure and we Face the world all week and just nice just to come get a breath of fresh air brother Travis just to get out of the old factory for a few minutes and just come get in the presence of the Lord and amen let God do something for us I want to read out of the book of J Joshua the first chapter in the first verse the Bible says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Le on even under the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man stand be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life for as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for an inheritance this land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous and thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest Prosper wherever thou goest for this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word and just a real simple thought the Lord had put on my my heart I don't mean that simple in a way to demean the the gospel and simple not don't mean powerless it's just simple it's something that's easy to understand and but I want to speak tonight on the Damascus Authority the Damascus Authority I thought this was just real good how the Lord had laid out his orders to Joshua and then not only did he tell him what he would do and that that he would be prosperous and he would have success but then God gave him a weight to be able to obtain it so that's the way God does he don't just tell you to do something but he'll tell you how to accomplish it if there's something out there for you God will let you know what's out there and know uh what's available but then he'll give you a way to to access it and so I I believe that's what God does he's he he's the he's the uh the door opener he has the key to every promise and I don't believe he wants the church to be wondering who they are and what they are and what they have access to but I believe that we serve a God in this age that has given us an open book uh so we know as the Bride of Jesus Christ what we have in our possession and and I just I just love the Lord and I thank him for that and but I want to speak uh tonight on the Damascus Authority now we're familiar with this word uh with authority of course this is uh Authority means the power to give or to keep order and of course we realize that in this world today it don't look like there's a whole lot of order you we was talking the brothers was visiting in the back room about things that's go go on in the in the Nations and all that just seems like there's so many things out of C and out of order and uh but we realize in order for a society to sustain itself or a people to go on then there always has to be order there has to be some form of order without order there's chaos without order there's unrest and without without order you'll people ride in the streets they'll tear down their own buildings they'll burn down their own cities without order so there so there has to be order and so you ever notice if there's an area you know you watch the news sometimes and and these great outbreaks and things happen it's because there's a lack of order they and they they lost their Authority or the order uh over the over the area or the the city or the state or whatever and so then then then these you know these things begin to happen and so we realize uh that it must be that there must be even from uh from the time of God given his word that there must be order how many believes that say Amen the Bible says let all things be done decently and in order so I I believe that I believe that we're living under under that kind of authority and we realize that uh through our whole lives that we always we always have have authority from the time where little kids when you're at home you're living under the authority of your parents you can't get away from it little guys when you go to school then you're under the authority of the teachers you can't when you go out into town you're under the authority you're under the authority of the police I know whenever you're young sometimes well I'll tell you I just I'm just going to be my own boss and I'm going to get out from under this I'm tell you what my dad he's been ruling over me and I've had about all of it I can take and when I get older there ain't nobody going to rule but it doesn't doesn't matter how old you are or where you're going to live there's always going to be an authority and and always going to be under some kind of an authority uh if you want to have any kind of order at all in your life and I I I got to think about all the the ways and even even when you get sick you know that uh there's an authority for being sick you go down the doctor and the doctor gives you and what what do you say when you call the when you call your job and you tell your job well I can't come in today and they say well you got to come in say but I've been sick and I've got the doctor's orders you know so see the doctor carries an authority over a patient so it doesn't matter where we where we are or what kind kind of condition we're in there's always uh there's always an authority and even even in the house of God when it comes to the church Paul said he said obey them that have rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls and and they must give account to God that but but but be obedient that they may do it with joy and not with grief grief for it is unprofitable to you I know this isn't something that's preached a whole lot but uh but but but it's still the gospel and it's still in a world that don't like order and in a world that don't like Authority you know they they kind of skirt around around these kind of things but Paul said but obey them that have rule over you so they they will enjoy doing it so you know if if it's always grief and it's always chaos and it's always disorder and it's always uh Disobedience and fight and he said see well it's unprofitable for you because they can't do it with joy anymore that they're doing it out of grief and and and they're bound to do the will of God and so so so just just be obedient to the word and just be obedient to the Lord and and and and obey the and Obey uh uh the word of God see so so that that we can that we can uh carry on and it can be profitable and the ministry can be profitable the church and but what what we find out is in this word Authority there's something that you just to lay a foundation that you have to know that what you surrender to becomes your Authority how many believe that in other words the Bible said there was a time when you used to yield yourself or yield your members to sin but then there cometh a time where Paul says but now you yield yourself to God so no longer in other words for a long time you lived under this authority of Darkness or you lived under a Dominion ship uh of the flesh or your your your life it ruled over you but but but but there Comes A Time brother Jared whenever you whenever you you come to this place in Christ where Paul said that when Christ come he delivers you from the power of Darkness so that that word power there it means Authority or rule or control or dominion and so Paul said but now when you come into Christ you've been delivered from this power and other and he has translated you into the kingdom of his dear son so in other words where there was a time you were Bound by one thing he said but now you're under Dominion of another you're you may have been bound by sin and you may have been bound by darkness and you may have been bound by flesh he said but but we have Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ even the Forgiveness of sins in whom he said who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him so Paul lays a foundation here that there ain't no Dominion that is over the Dominion of Jesus Christ there there's no Authority that's above the authority of Jesus Christ he said so he said before him he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence in other words this word preeminence means in all things that Christ would be superior to All Things That means every trouble he's Superior over it every trial he's Superior over it every Spirit he's Superior over it every every problem that would come up in your life or any thought that would come up in your mind he said he has preeminence over all somebody say over all things he has preeminence over all things I I thought this is wonderful cuz Paul said he delivered you from the power of Darkness that mean God knew right where you were and Brother David Paul he went right down to where you were and he found you in a condition where you were under the authoritative uh or the Dominion sh of darkness and God delivered you out of from under that headship and he brought you into another place that he would have preeminence over your life and friends let me tell you what happens when you're delivered out of darkness and you're under the preeminence of Jesus Christ no longer are you bound but now you're a free man or a free woman in God he called you out of this Dominion ship of darkness and brought you under the authority of Jesus Christ and let me tell you something if you're taking notes you can write this down it may be something you read later that'll help you to reject the preeminence of Jesus Christ would be to subject yourself to the power of Darkness so see he called you out from under that power and gave you a new headship the preeminence of Jesus Christ but lo and behold here come people after they're brought out but then they don't want to fall under the preeminence of Christ but to reject the preeminence of Christ would be to accept or or to be subject to this power of Darkness but listen what Paul said he says so then let not sin reain over you in your mortal body in other words don't let sin rule as a king over your life ain't that good in Romans the 6th chapter he said don't let it rule as a king over your mortal body that they that you should obey the lust thereof don't be obedient to sin don't let sin rule over your body don't let sin rule over your flesh I know the weak the weak backbone spineless pastors there are today that ain't got no uh way to preach people past having power over the flesh that they won't ever preach it no more and just allow people to live any way they want to but that ain't what the Bible said the Bible said don't let sin have power over your life Paul said you ought to be able to rain over it don't let it rain in your mortal body don't obey the lust of the flesh but overcoming it for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but you're under grace don't back down to sin don't go back down that old path say well that's just my flesh and I just got to allow it and I'm always going to be going through it and I'll always be condemned and every week I'll be back at an altar but Paul said don't let sin have dominion over your life you're not under law but you're under grace and the grace of God brother brother Travis the brace grace of God has came to bring us out from under the Dominion of sin I think it's wonderful see sin can't rule you because you're not under the authority of it it it doesn't mean that you're not under an authority see a lot of people take that too far that God has delivered you and he's gave you dominion and and now you have an authority but that don't mean you're not under something because Paul goes on to say he said when you were Servants of sin you were free from righteousness but what fruit in other words what benefit what benefit had you in these thingss whereof you are now ashamed in other words what benefit did the old life that you live the things that you're ashamed of doing now what benefit did they ever do for you he said they they never done no benefit and the end of them is death he said but now being made free from sin and become a servant to God you have a different kind of benefit he said now you have benefits and your benefits are under Holiness and the end of it is everlasting life I I thought my isn't that that wonderful that he didn't leave us he did he didn't just leave us in this in this place of sin where something would have a rule over you but God called you out so that you could have power over sin he called you out that you could have authority over it so you could put it beneath you that you could conquer it once and for all and Satan would have no place in your life to lead you and to rule over you my to to to jerk you around and and pull you into trouble and pull you into situations well I've always been that way you know after all that's the way my mama was and that's the way my grandma was and I can't get away from it but Paul said but I say to the contrary don't fall under the Dominion of sin don't don't be under the Dominion of unbelief and allow your flesh to to fall into the lust of the flesh he said but be free the benefits of being free is is unto Holiness and unto everlasting life see so the authority of sin leads to death but the authority of God leads to life amen that makes me want to preach a little bit remember what Jesus did when he went into the temple here come a man that was filled with all these unclean spirits and devils and and everybody that tried he went to many churches and tried to get free of it but couldn't get free of it he' been down and had people lay hands on him but they couldn't get free but he came into the presence of Jesus one day and when it came into him Jesus began to speak to him and the demon inside of him said what do we got to do with thee oh Jesus of Nazareth and the Bible said but Jesus looked at him and he called the unclean devil and the devil came out of the man and the man left free and the people around them begin to say by what Authority and what power has he done this why how how would he have the ability to do such a thing as this he said for with authority and power He commands an unclean spirit and they came out that same Jesus brother Jared with authority and power he spoke to the Seas he spoke to the waves and the waves obeyed him he spoke to the wind and the wind obeyed him that same Authority and power when he walked down the street one day and he found that old fig tree that wasn't bringing forth fruit he cursed it and when he came came back forth it was cursed and it brought forth and it was laying there withered and dead you notice that the people around you begin to ask how did this happen and the Bible says when he come he the the disciples said Lord how do you have this kind of authority he said for verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain notice when they asked how he had it he told them how to get it I thought makes me want to dance he said whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea for you shall not doubt in your heart but You Shall Believe the things which you say shall come to pass you shall have whatsoever you saith therefore I say unto you what thingss soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against another that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses for if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you and then they come to Jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple the Bible said There came unto him Chief priests and scribes and elders and they said by what Authority Dost thou do these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things my I thought isn't it something then Jesus wouldn't even answer their question he he threw a little Parable at them and said well if you can answer that well then I'll answer this but they couldn't answer it but you notice that even the he had enough Authority that even the critics recognize his authority they didn't come and say well you ain't got any authority to do this they said what give you the authority to do it what gave you the authority to take that Spirit out of that man what gave you the authority to heal the blinded eyes what gave you the authority to make the lame the wall and to and to take those that were blind and cause them to see but what Authority have you done these things he had authority over every Spirit he had authority over over all things he have authority over all of creation and brother Jared even over life and over death he had authority over them for Jesus said I laid down my life for my sheep he said no man can take it from me but I lay it down myself I have the power to lay it down and I have the power to raise it up again and I received this commandment from my father he wouldn't answer them but he tells the disciples said I've got the power to do it and I received it from my father to see a man that surrendered his his flesh so much to the will of God or the will of the father that not even death could rule over him isn't that wonderful he Soul surrendered to the will of the father that not even death had authority over him see what you surrender to becomes your Authority now you think about it when when whenever you whenever you surrender to something not only is it this not only does it have authority over you but it has Authority in you so the only Authority that you have is what you surrendered to so in other words you can say this your Authority is only as great as your surrender if you want to write something else down write that down your s your your Authority is as great as your surrender so the more you can surrender then the more Authority that you'll have so as the will of God begins to unfold in your life brother the card of what will happen is you surrender to the will of God and the more that you surrender to God's will then the authority to exact that will becomes greater and greater in your life the very things that that hold you down and hold you back but because you're surrendering to the will of God then this Authority begins to rise up in you and the Very things that come up say you can't do that to me no more see I've already surrendered that part of me to God I've G that part of over to God and the places where where Satan would destroy you say well you can't destroy me there anymore cuz I surrendered that to God and well you couldn't defeat this you know I couldn't defeat it on my own but I surrendered it to God I got such an addiction I couldn't get over it but I surrendered it to God and the more you surrender the more Authority that you have and then you can take the will of God and let the will of God take place over your life you see see there's so many things that that we can surrender or give into there you there there's so many people people in the world they surrender to theologies and surrender to church rules and people and and but we find this to be the case that God is always leading his church he he ain't just leaving us out there wondering what we should follow and what should we we should we we we should get into but he never leaves the church without a witness say see whenever Jesus ascended into into into Glory what did he do the Holy Ghost came back down to the church and led them when Moses led the children of Israel he led them all the way across the Wilderness but at the time of Moses's passing he didn't leave them stuck in the wilderness he raised up another man by the name of Joshua which was a type of the Holy Ghost he said you'll take him on in you're going to take him across the promised land you're going to divide their inheritance everything I said to Moses is still going to come to pass God will just raise up another man to carry on carry on God's plans so God never leaves his church without a witness he notice so as God is is doing this here here's what as he begins to speak to Joshua he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous and then shall thou have good success I love this portion of scripture because when he says Thou shalt meditate most people read that and think well that means you just think on those things so so Joshua you need to think on this day and night but that word meditate in the Hebrew come the HEB from the Hebrew word haa which means to utter or to speak so here God says to Joshua the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth what these words that I've spoken unto Moses they're going to remain in your mouth but Thou shalt meditate on it day and night in other words not Not only would he look at it not only would he would he read it but he would speak it you you shall utter it and you shall speak it therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein I thought my isn't it something he said and what what he done with Joshua is what he had already done with Moses he said as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee well then then well my if You' have been Joshua you could have asked God the question well how was you with Moses but see Joshua already knew the answer he W he walked around with Moses and he saw what God done with Moses I'm just getting a foundation he saw what God done with Moses he saw how God took a man that a man that had no power and a man that didn't have the ability to hardly speak and God took him down there and he so surrendered his life to God that he became God to the people that he was leading Bible say what did he do he veiled himself in a prophet notice when he veiled himself in Moses but said notice he said the people think that something had happened to him he was different from the rest of the Israelites remember here Moses used to be an ordinary man but he got along with God and something be to happen to him and the more he surrendered to God the closer to God that he became that when he came before the people he said he was different than the priest his message was different he was different from anything he was a different person and the people seen something had happened and God had deail himself in his Prophet to speak his words to them notice that's what he had done he said because Moses was the Living Word to the people veiled by the pillar of fire that makes me want to Shadow over this building and he was speaking what was to later be veiled behind Badger skins so here God would send a man Moses that brought the word to the people when he came down off of a mountain and remember he had those old tables of stone but in order to reveal it Moses had to become God to the people you that he he brought the Commandments of God and they wouldn't even be able to receive it my is it something that if if if he wouldn't have done it they would never they they would have they would have thought it was Moses but if God's going to reveal it he said see the word had to come from Moses first see Moses had the word they were written by God nobody could interpret them Moses had to interpret them first that's the reason he veiled his face is it had to be interpreted by him listen so Moses comes down and he veils his face so that the people would look up on him and they wouldn't think that it came from a man that they would know it came from God but he veiled his face and he came with a power of God and he spoke the word of God with the authority of God but he had a veil upon him that the people wasn't no longer looking at a man but they were looking to the god that the man served the very God that he was anointed by the God that he had met down at the pillar of fire that had giving him the order to bring the law to the people of God you said why was he veiled so it so it wasn't Moses doing the revealing God veiled himself so they could see the god in him IM is there something he veiled him himself so when they looked they saw God my God God's a wonderful God he he thought all this out before we ever even got here we are thousands of years later but God thought all this through that he would Veil his Prophet that his word could come forth out of the mouth of a prophet and you could look past the face of the man and see the God that was speaking out of him that's what kind of God that we serve said here it is you think about it this word it had to be revealed same way with this Bible we can take this Bible we can carry it around and pack it and we we can we can we can take take it and try to uh uh interpret it and everything else but my said but it's got to be revealed and in order to reveal it Moses had to become God to the people I know people I'm hting a brick wall with that but that's what the Bible said Exodus 4th chapter and he shall be thy spokesman unto the People speaking of Aaron and he shall be and even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and you shall be to him instead of a God that's what God told Moses so you'll be a God to him and he'll be your Prophet you'll be the God he'll be he'll be the mouthpiece that's able to speak he say see so so God had to come he veiled himself in a prophet of God that he could reveal his word to his children he's making a great promise a promise of entering into this Promised Land says so there he come he had to Veil himself because God is always behind the veil how many knows that remember we took a whole series on on Elohim and how that God has always veiled himself even in the beginning all the way through the the Book of Genesis I think it's some 31 times or something in the in the first few verses that the the name Elohim is mentioned in the bible we call it all kinds of things we called it Jehovah we called it God we called it uh Jehovah Shem a different ones but but many when you read through Elohim Elohim Elohim why why is it Elohim because Elohim was was was was a was was God a a self-existing one he see we can make God anything we can make the speaker God but the go but the speaker can't self- exist it can't create itself it it it's not self-existent some man had to make it and so the word God isn't good enough to call God God so the Bible said it's Elohim this was the the the Revelation that Moses had it was Elohim he he was self-existent there wasn't none other but him and when he came down and and then he can come because of Moses's Revelation he realized that God could show himself in different forms he knew when he came to Abraham he could blow up a body Out of the Dust to the ground and step in the body and walk up and eat and eat and have fellowship with Abraham he knew that God could come and set in a burning bush behind a pillar of fire and the voice of God could speak out of that fire but yet it was still the same God he knew that God could come down in the garden and create a man and walk around and have fellowship with him in whatever form why because it's Elohim it's God veiled in different forms so God is always behind a veil and notice as he comes behind this Veil you realize says see so people can come under the authority of God's prophet and that's what set them free what set them people free in the days of Moses might as well just preach it what set them free in the days of Moses because they came under the authority of a prophet of God it wasn't because they all a sudden grew some boldness or they all of a sudden had some backbone and well I'm tired of this old Taskmaster and I'm tired of the whips and I'm tired of Egypt and I'm tired of laying bricks I'll tell you what I'll get up enough C it had nothing to do with it they surrendered to the to the prophet of God and they fell under the authority of God's prophet and then the authority of God's Prophet was birthed into them when they walked the enemy couldn't touch them when they when they were hungry food fed them when they were thirsty there was water in a rock when there was when there was sickness there was a place to go to be healed of their sickness why because they came under the authority of the prophet of God see it was that Authority that delivered them from the hand of their Taskmaster under the authority of Moses God gave instruction to the people of God that's how that's how he done it through Moses I think about what you say well what was it that saved their life it when the death angel came into Egypt remember it was the Judgment of God the plagues that struck Egypt but what was it that saved their life you say well anybody say well it was the blood on the door that saved their life well that and that is true but notice but where did the blood on the door come from can we just get right to it where did where did it come from you you think when the angel when that death angel came around Egypt and says but I've been given Authority well where did the Death Angel get his authority somebody answer me it was from Moses whenever he spoke he said according to the word of God what was it God to the people and he brought judgment upon Egypt out of the mouth of a prophet he said this judgment is going to strike the land the firstborn son they're going to die in this in all the land of Egypt and whenever the death angel went out through Egypt and it came over around the land of Goan and he went up there I just see that Old Death Angel knocking on the door I'm here to to exact the authority of the Prophet Moses and maybe some Daddy he throw his shoulders back and go meet him at the door and say well I've got an authority of the same Prophet Moses and he said if I put the blood on the door then you can't enter it was the same Authority that brought judgment it's the same Authority that brought life and brought salvation and brought grace to the children of Israel the same Prophet prophet's mouth that spoke judgment over Egypt is the same prophet's mouth that brought Liberty to those people that came under the authority of a prophet of God and under the authority of Moses glory to God glory under the authority of Moses they had power over a death angel the death angel that come that nobody could stop the death angel that the armies of Israel had no power over the death angel or or that the great armies of Egypt had no power the The Magicians of Egypt had no power the great pharaohs of Egypt had no power the gods of Egypt had no power but the children of Israel had power over the death angel under the authority of a prophet Moses listen under this Authority God positioned them behind the word of God in other let me say it like this can I say it this way way God positioned them behind the word of Moses to survive judgment it was God's word but Moses still spoke it and they took the words that Moses spoke can you imagine a people rising up in that day I know I'm smacking the spirit but can you imagine a people rising up in that day and said well I'll tell you what there ain't no man going to lead us out of here God said he was going to bring us a great warrior and God and God said he was going to come with a mighty hand of judgment and God said he there ain't no one man going to have the ability to do that but it didn't matter matter there was those when they heard it something about it the supernatural was moving in his life he he done things that other people couldn't do what was it it was God veiled in flesh no man has the ability to do anything any man that's ever done something Supernatural it was God in flesh whether it be me or you or anybody else it's never us but it's God veiled in flesh say see God positioned them behind the word of Moses to survive judgment and that's what God has done today to every believer brother Jared he's given us a position behind the word of God and placed us into the body of Jesus Christ that's why we can stand before every enemy in the middle of whatever would come our way whatever the lie that the devil would tell you say well but the Bible says I've been placed in my position behind the word of God can I read it to you Paul said but now hath God set in other words he's placed the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him so not only did he place it but Brother David he placed us in our position so not only did he Place Us in the body he put us where he wanted us I know everybody wants to move around everybody wants to be something else cuz somebody else's position looks so much greater but friends let me tell you it ain't if you was where they are they'd say well I wish I was where you are and you were I where where I am but but but but it never changes we always we always want something different he said but but not only did he Place us but he put us in our position and then when Paul preaches this he takes our Natural Body and he begins to use it as a type and saying God has some hands and God has some feet and God has some eyes and God has some elbows and and God has some some hair and God has some ears and and God has some noses and he he he begins to to describe us as this natural body but we realized when he was describing it brother Xavier he don't we we wern't really hands and feet and noses to God but we were we were we were preachers and teachers and and lay members and prayer warriors and pastors and and Prophets and apostles and and Sunday school teachers and and and and sound tech Ians and and and janitors and and whatever that God put you in the church that you'd be a help to the church maybe you got a good job somewhere and you make money and you support the church that way but God places Us in the body for the furtherance of the gospel Paul said God put us there he said but notice what he does I love this I love this about God he said God knew that Satan would try to destroy the body so look what God does because he knows how Satan is so he knows that Satan would try to destroy it and he says well just as some parts of the natural body are less desirable than others Paul says so what God done is he gave more abundant honor to the less desirable Parts I don't want to be a pinky toe in God's arm you know in in the body of Christ I I want to be a I want to be a bicep or you know I I don't I don't want to be this be said but he gave more honor more abundant honor to the Lesser so that there's no Schism in the body how many knows what a Schism is it's a division so Paul says so what God did is he gave more abundant honor to the less desirable parts of the body so what you say you may say well what what I'm doing ain't much and you know I they don't even need me at the church you know I I may as well just not even go they don't replace me anyhow they don't even want me there they they don't want to use me they you know they just kind of put me to the side but Paul said but it doesn't matter what part God put you in God put you in a position in the body of Jesus Christ he put you in a place God needs you there he wants you there he placed you there and when you don't feel like it's honorable Paul said but God gave more abundant honor to the less desired able position so that there's no division in the body in other words they're equal value what that does brother Dave it keeps you that that old spirit of jealousy that comes in well you know that one gets to do more and that one does more and they and they use more and they preach more and they sing more and they they play more and all all the things that comes in but it keeps all that jealousy out of the body because we're all equally valuable in the kingdom of God friends if I can I just say something from my heart you know if we could ever get to the place to where when you're your kids sing I say my what a wonderful job they did and when my kids sang you'd say the same thing you'd see a people on fire for God you'd see a church where the Devil Couldn't get into if you ever if you could ever get to a place to where when your kids go do something at the school that I can say man they did a great job I don't have to say well well my kid could do a lot better job than that I say well they did a great job I'm so proud of you if you could treat their kids like you do your kids and they could treat your kids like they do their kids then there wouldn't be no division in the body say see because they're all valuable they're all equal I thank God for every one of them I if you just look at I'm using the kids for an example but it goes for the parents too I've seen some sister had some uh deal posted or Sent send a picture to my wife about about something they had had built over there I thought well my whoever did that did an outstanding job I wish they'd decorate for my part but why because they they did a good job whatever happened just telling people they did a good job is is there something if if I if I missed something if I lost my mind but what happened just telling people you did a good job and my I'm proud of you for what you do and I I'm proud of the gift that God gave you and my if there's any way I could ever help you let me know and and if you can ever help me I'll certainly let you know whatever happened that's free anyway let me get back to my message he said God gave him more abundant honor to the less desirable so there would be no division in the body so when you're in a place and you're in in this position you feel like well it's not a very desirable position I ain't going to ask you to raise hands sometimes we feel that way it ain't a very desirable place I wish I was where this person is said but he give more abundant honor are you listening to the word he give more abundant honor to the less desirable position so that there's no division in the body equal value see see we're all equally valuable in the kingdom of God friends you want to see a church on fire for God and a church that's growing and moving and in a Revival you catch what Paul's preaching right here catch what he's preaching that we're all equally valuable in the body of Christ God sets people in church he's one that places us and you know what he gets us all out of some other places we all come from different backgrounds you know they're they're a lot different but they're a lot the same we all come from from something you every one of us could probably tie some things in our family back to some bad things or some drugs or some alcohol or some mistakes that somebody made or all that stuff that would come but let me tell you something about God God gets his people from the worst places possible man I get to thinking about how he done it from the he he he takes them from the worst place and he leads him right into the house of God I got a couple minutes remember remember what he done this is what this is what happened I thought about the worst one I could think of tonight it was a man by the name of apostle Paul and here that man he was a sinner and you know what he took that man that was a sinner here was a man that was lost here was a man that that was against God and God LED that man down a path to Salvation so that God could use it him you say God led him that's what God done the Bible says that Paul was on his road to Damascus let me ask you this question what caused Paul to go down the road to Damascus the Bible said he had a desire in his heart that he wanted to kill Christians or he wanted to take them and put them in jail but what put the desire in Paul's heart to go in there the Bible says he was breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord and he went in under the high priest and he desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues and he and as he journeyed he came near under Damascus and suddenly there shined around about him a light from Heaven I thought my is it something let me tell you what happened God sent him to Damascus to save Christians God sent Paul how many believes that God sent Paul to Damascus it was God's purpose for him to go to Damascus in the beginning before Paul ever took the first life before he ever took the took the first one and put him in prison before stevenh was ever stoned God had already purposed for Paul to go down the road to Damascus he purposed for him to spend time there and to preach the gospel and to find God and to be filled with the Holy Ghost and to see the supernatural happen in his life so somewhere in this Sinner's life God begins to deal with him and in this Sinner's life he goes down to the synagogue he says I need some transport papers that I can go get some Christians and in his in this Sinner's life there's some this desire caused him to go down to this road to Damascus let me tell you friends it wasn't an accident that God met him on that road it wasn't a a chance happening that God met him on that road but God planned to be be there before the foundation of the world he drove that man to get the papers and he drove him to walk down the road and something in his heart caused him to come right into contact with God here he was fighting against God and the whole time God was still leading him glory to God that's how God is that's the sovereignty of our God when you spend your life and you're fighting God I'll never go to church I ain't going to serve God I'm just going to quit I ain't going to be a Christian this ain't nothing but a bunch of nonsense but in all your fighting God brought you right here to to to see that very Supernatural lie begin to speak to your heart and say I called you from the beginning I knew you before the foundation of the world I've called you for a purpose you ain't going back into the world you're my son quit looking and comparing yourself to the rest of the world saying I got to be like them so I can be somebody I got to be like them so I can fit in you ain't ever going to fit in with them but you'll fit in here why because you're a part of the body of Jesus Christ he went down to Damascus and God brought him there listen when God put this desire in his heart I thought my a it's something that while he was yet a sinner God caused him to go the way God wanted him to go so if God can take a sinner and God can lead a sinner down a road where God wants to meet him then what do you think God can do with somebody like you a Son of God and a daughter of God that's already gave their heart to the Lord if God can lead a sinner don't you think God can't lead you and I he could lead us the Bible says he was filled with the Holy Ghost men came to take him but notice when they come to take him God spoke he said he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel he was a messenger that was chosen by God in the first church age brother Jared he demonstrated the power of the Holy Ghost there was no other Ministry in that day that could compare to Paul's Ministry how many believe that there were no no other Ministry matter of fact there he he was a man that was that was sent from God and he had the authority of God and and Paul said and though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you a man that had so much Authority he could say these words listen if an angel from heaven were to speak any other gospel unto you than that which I have already preached let it be a cursed a man that had enough authority to say if an angel from heaven would speak something that's different than what I've already preached let him be a cursed he said for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ but my he puts a stamp on it right here Paul says but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ the in other words The Authority that I have came from God the authority that I have came on the road to Damascus The Authority that I have came from a supernatural experience when God came down and he began to speak to my heart friends don't you realize that his authority that that that came that that came from the Jews was defeated by a higher authority Paul was already had an authority he had an authority to go take Christians but that Authority that he had that man giv Authority that the Jews said you go down and you capture them and you bring them into jail but that Jewish giv Authority was overridden by a higher authority and all of a sudden that Authority that he was given by those Jews didn't mean anything to him anymore more because there was a higher authority that was leading his life but he just started chunking papers I don't want them nowhere near me why because I've given over to a higher authority you may have an authority see because of our fall in the garden we were given an authority to sin because of the fall in the garden you was given an authority the Bible said we're free moral agents we we had the ability to go out into sin you go you can serve the devil you you can do what you want to but when you come in contact with God that higher authority causes you to live by something greater then you can look back at the Devil and say them old them old papers that you gave me you know I'm a I'm a big man and I can do what I want and I'm a I'm a big girl and I can do I I'll throw all that aside and I just surrender to a higher authority and let me do the will of God he cast aside all his rights and papers all that from the council laid it aside and then he took a hold of the pillar of fire and he went on to lead the Church of God is't that wonderful how many knows this that that same Pillar of Fire is still leading the church today the pillar of fire that has it still has the the same authority over every Spirit he has the same authority over every thought it has the same authority over all of our intentions it has the authority over the desire of our flesh it's the same Authority today you think about it it it's the authority of a prophet of God and you what them people did they followed Paul's Ministry because he had an authority from God see what what does that mean that means the authority of a prophet think about it when a when a prophet of God come into the day in the age we live in brother brother David what happened is he had an authority from God God and when he spoke demons fled and when he spoke sicknesses left off of sick bodies and when he spoke flesh the the flesh surrendered to the will of God and what did he do but he restored the faith of the church back to what it was 2,000 years ago when people wonder can God should do that anymore can God still move in the Supernatural is there still anything as the Holy Ghost is there still a power of God can God still do Miracles friends don't you realize this is the debate of the church it looked like it had all been lost it had looked like it had fallen aside to where churches today they'll put men in their pull pits and they'll stand up and tell you that God can't even do it anymore cuz they don't know how to make it happen but I thank God that there was one that went down the road one day and met the angel of the Lord that said you go let my people know that the same Authority that met Moses and the same Authority that met Apostle Paul is still alive in the year of 2024 and he can still do the same work that he always done it's the authority of God you listen in the days of Moses the Bible says the Shadow King was in their Camp why he said cuz God was with them he was Healing The Sick he was doing miracles signs and wonders and the pillar of fire hung over them and Moses followed after the pillar of fire and the children of Israel followed after Moses and they went on their road to the promised land and there ain't nothing would stop them he said that Pillar of Fire is still alive today my goodness that Pillar of Fire is still alive today he's still the same yesterday to day and forever the word still lives the same light brother Carter that led Paul that same lie that that met Moses that that same lie is still leading the church today what is it that causes God to come down into a Congregation of people and minister to their hearts me and sister Vanna she was talking about the other day she said you know me and one of my friends we was talking about the strangest thing something that you would never talk about to anybody and I told her I said you know what I feel like I feel like one of those those punching bags that has sand in the bottom of it and the devil just keeps punching me and I just keep going to the ground she said if I didn't come in church the next service and you got in there preaching and the spirit of the Lord started moving and you said you know what sometimes we feel like one of them old punching bags that stands up that has sand in the bottom of it and the devil just keeps punching us and we just keep falling down but I thank God that there's something there that caused us to keep Rising back up you say well what is it it's that same Pillar of Fire the Bible says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart and you come in it ain't some man-made some madeup sermon some microwave something to give to the people of God but it's a fresh anointing from Heaven from allmighty God out of the mouth of God to speak to his children it's a Living Word we ain't serving some dead God we're serving a living God we ain't serving some some history lesson or some gospel of the past I'm talking about a God that's still alive today that still ministers to his children he gives you faith in what you believe he encourages you in your faith and say just hold the faith if you don't understand it just stick around a little while until the revelation of the words tracks your heart and God can bring you up to another level the word still lives it's leading the church today think about it what a thought the same one that called Moses same one that called B Paul is the same one that called you isn't that good you ever just think about that God come down and he spoke to Moses and he called him out by name he said I'm the god of Moses I'm the god of apostle Paul I'm the god of David mcgar see it don't kind of sounds a little different when you say your own name don't it but that's the God we serve the same one that called them is the same one that called you I'm the god of Carter Morris I'm the god that called you I've called you in this age to be able to recognize who you are what you have you realize this church today I'm going to close with this the modern church today they don't recognize what they have you think about this see I got to think about that old you know Benjamin Franklin when he went out searching for electricity remember the experiment and him and his son I believe it was they they put that old that cord up in the air and they got one cord that was wet so it would be able to carry a current and they built a kite and they were originally going to do it on top of a church but they he thought he could get the same thing out of a kite and brother but Tommy put that on that string and then he got that Silk string and tied to it and it was dry cuz he didn't want to catch a hold of the current so he went in hid behind the barn and held hold of the silk string and the other string went up had the key attached to it at the bottom and at the bottom of it there was that old Laden or or lien jar you which was like a modern-day capacitor is when they first started coming out with him it may then it was 15 years old or something before Benjamin Franklin had had his experiment and so here here he took this jar and he put and he put that that key in it and they set it out there and him and his boy and they put it right in the middle of the Thundercloud and after a little bit all of a sudden he seen the the the the the hairs or the the little thread standing up on that string he said so he knew there was some kind something static that had got a hold of it and so as it came down and it came down into that jar and then Benjamin Franklin took a hold of it and he got to telling everybody he said the lightning struck the key or something there's there's something struck the key and it's run down and it's hit the bottle and he got the he got to telling everybody I got it I got it I got it and then they said well use it use it use it well I don't know how is't that the way it is say I got it but I don't know what to do with it I got it but I don't know what it is I got it but I don't know the power of it but I got it there's something in the jar but I just don't know what to do with it see the lighting jar was full but there had to come somebody that that that would help them find out what to do with it so he said see brother say that's the way it is with people today is that God saved you but they just don't know what they had so they go around they go around saying I got it I got it I got it but we just don't know what we got but then there come another man that was that that was anointed for the hour by the name of Thomas Edison and he took that very thing and he said if there's power if there's a way to catch power then there's a way to send it and there's a way to transfer and if it'll go up and down that wire there's got to be a cable or a wire or something somewhere that you can travel that back and forth one to another and thousands of times that he tried to make that work and it failed and over and over and it failed and he tried and he failed and he tried and finally he got a hold of the right wire and but said that's the same way it is today with many of the church people they say well God saved me from sin he said certainly he did but then they say well but I don't know what I got he said but that same God that saved you from sin well then there's power in there that he can use to work on you so if he can save you if there's something in the bottle then God can do something with what's in the bottle he said so the god that saved you he's he can also give you happiness the god that saved you can give you peace the god that saved you can give you Joy the god that saved you can heal your body the god that Sav you can Rapture this church into Glory there's power laying in in the jar if you only knew how to tap into the what was in the jar said this what Thomas Edison believed the people thought he was crazy but he knew was right he knew that something told him current would travel through that wire so he kept on trying wires until he found one that the current would follow and when he did he gave the world electricity now is that something in the natural here's these men that were that were or ordained to to be able to to bring electricity it was God's purpose for us to have it and here they they were fighting to do it but in the spiritual it was the same thing he said what God was doing he said it was God going to give light to the world with his own electricity this is what happened in the days of Paul God wanted to give it to the world he said it had been there all the time it was here all the time but they just didn't know how to harness it and to make it work you realize they didn't nobody invent electricity Ben Franklin didn't invent electricity he didn't find it they knew it was there they seen lightning and storms all they did was figured out a way to channel it so that you could apply and you could use it and you could turn on a switch and you could have Li and big old uh uh oh some of them big Old Dutch made biscuits you know the the big old fluffy ones with a flow on top of them why because you got some electricity that you can cook in and make everything just right he say see but they were they had to have a way to harness it he said and now that same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost that's healed the sick back there it's been in the church the whole time but the thing of it is is you don't know how to make it work for you it was there all along from the days of Jesus and the days of Paul that same Supernatural power of the Holy Ghost it's been there all the time the power to heal the sick it's been there all the time the power to raise the dead it's been there all the time the power to make a Rapture he said it's been there all along but they don't know how to make it work for you but here's the thing that makes it work is Faith to believe and when you believe and take him out his word that's the lifeline and it cannot fail my it makes me want to preach all over this building brother the Jared it was there all along when Paul met him it came under a different Authority his ministry was to introduce people introduce people to Christ and he done just that here we come down to today 2,000 years ago or 2,000 years later and that same Miracle working power that's been there all along that same Supernatural power that that was there there in the Bible days has been laying and waiting in this age for somebody to contact it and to be able to use it listen what God done so he brings that Pillar of Fire as the music players want to come brings that Pillar of Fire in this age that same Pillar of Fire that met Moses the same Pillar of Fire that met Paul here come a prophet of God that would meet that same Pillar of Fire again Brother David what would it what was the purpose of it says see well what was it when Moses came on the scene he had a revelation how many realizes that the Bible Moses didn't have a bible to read I know that's hard for people they think the Bible's just been this thing that God handed down magically to people you realize it was men that wrote it inspired by God Moses didn't have a bible to read neither did all the people before Moses but he had a revelation of God and he sat down under that Revelation and he wrote these books of the Bible then finally they could go on and somebody could have something read but up until that time it was only by Revelation it was only by somebody coming by and saying the Lord told me to tell you the Lord spoke to me and the Lord said go here it was only that that's the way God worked so see what makes it so foreign to think that God could come today and Lead his children he'll take that same word he' never preach a different gospel Paul said he wouldn't said he had preached the same thing if anybody preach something different let it be a curse it had to be the same word said but Moses done it how did he do it he met God in the form of the pillar of fire veiled in a pillar of fire when Paul met him on the road he met him in the form of a pillar of fire Veil behind a pillar of fire he said and think of it that same Pillar of Fire that come upon these men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible the Bible says that there ain't no PR interpretation but if it took a prophet to write it and there's a mystery in the Bible that's what the Bible says mystery to be made plain if there's a mystery in the Bible it took a prophet to write it what do you think God would use to reveal it see say so here's God today the same Pillar of Fire so you realize it wasn't the men that wrote it to start with it wasn't Paul that had that Authority it was the pillar of fire it was the Holy Ghost in Paul that gave him that Authority it wasn't Moses that had it it wasn't William brandham that had it there was the Holy Ghost in them you said well what gives me that Authority because that same Holy Ghost is in you man isn't that something it ain't to it ain't to idolize somebody or to worship some man or some goofy stuff that people do but it's to recognize the power of God in human flesh Paul said it was the mystery he said it was Christ The Mystery of God revealed it was Christ in you what did he say it was Christ in you it was the hope of all glory that's the mystery that Paul wanted the church to see is Christ dwelling in a human being but here we are today it's that same Pillar of Fire under the authority of the Angel of the Lord preach what Paul preached by Revelation and led the church back to that same Pillar of Fire again I don't know about you but I thank God for for men that find the way I don't I don't have to look at one say well I wish I had what he had I wish I was that per you know my position ain't what that person we all have different positions but God uses them we weren't all Ben Franklin's we weren't all Thomas Edison we did all invent a light bulb but we all get to use it so I don't go and say well I would you know why they give Thomas Ed so much credit y'all can talk about him all you want to don't bother me a bit I use a light every day see it don't bother me you can say who did it that's good talk about it thank God for the men that God used thank God for the holy ghost that led the church he said it's that same pillar of fire that led the church again what is it brother Joe if you don't stand to your feet it's a Damascus Authority it's what gave Paul an authority when he was on that road that day and changed him from being the authority of the flesh into the under the authority of God it's what gives us a right that's what gives us a right to stand in the pull pit and preach the gospel but said there ain't no man has a theological degree or some doctors gree has a right behind the pull pit to claim the message of Jesus Christ until he's first met God face to face in the pillar of fire he has no right to call himself a messenger cuz all the theologians in the world couldn't explain it if you ever met him face to face that's what a man needs is to meet God meet the pillar of fire it's what gives you a right Pillar of Fire gives you a right to preach for the David it didn't matter who comes they can't take it from you they didn't give you the right the pillar of fire did it was that Pillar of Fire that gave you a right to praise God it was that same Pillar of Fire that when you come in the in the house of God and the spirit of the Lord's moving and you begin to worship God somebody look at why you being so loud why is your hands raised why why yall so rowdy but but I have a right it was given to me by the pillar of fire it's that one that's brooding over the church that's ministering to us I got a right to praise him I got a right to shout I've got a right to be in a Revival the pillar of fire has gave it to me he said what God done with it he led his children then and today he has separated us from all these old dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what God has separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day what was it it was returning back to the the faith the original Faith Of God I thank God today that we have a land that we can worship God in we've been on the backside of a desert it's the same Pillar of Fire now how me how many can just in a little simple service like this to say you know that God spoke to you tonight I want you'all to look around the building now what does that what causes that brother Josh that that so me nobody told you to made you raise your hand but you know there's something going on in your life almost every hand this building went up but there's something going on in your life and God knows what we have need of he's alive and well that same Pillar of Fire is still moving Among Us belar it a it ain't a God of History he's still alive today people are looking for great signs to know there's God just let him speak to you get in this presence just get in the in the under the under the presence of the pillar of fire and let God begin to deal with your heart and have authority over your life what you surrender to is what Authority you have I wonder how many can lift your hands say brother M that's what I want to surrender to Let's surrender to that great light of God I may not understand all things Paul didn't understand all things but he surrendered to it there something speaking to your heart today that's what I want to surrender and friends the more you surrender the greater Authority
