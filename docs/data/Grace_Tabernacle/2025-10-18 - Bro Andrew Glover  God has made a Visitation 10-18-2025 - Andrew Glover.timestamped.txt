[41:22] You know, every one of us was guilty.
[41:26] I was like Barabus. He was already
[41:28] proven guilty, but one stepped up,
[41:31] Brother Morgan. He said, "I'll take his
[41:33] place."
[41:35] Everything we could ever be, what I am
[41:38] today. I might have been in a grave
[41:39] somewhere, Brother David. But God chose
[41:43] fit for me to be here this morning. And
[41:46] I want to sing a song that I've been

[42:10] There was
[42:13] a good man.
[42:16] There were
[42:18] two threes.
[42:20] [Music]
[42:21] A man called
[42:24] Barabus
[42:27] was doomed
[42:29] for a tree.
[42:32] But Jesus took that middle one.
[42:37] Barabus
[42:40] went free.
[42:44] And I love
[42:48] that man
[42:50] in the middle.
[42:54] Oh, praise the Lord this morning because
[42:57] I know
[42:59] he first
[43:01] loved me.
[43:06] And praise
[43:09] to that man
[43:11] who died on Mount Calvary.
[43:17] That middle man
[43:19] made it possible
[43:22] that I could go free.
[43:28] All listen now.
[43:30] A hill called
[43:33] Gotha,
[43:36] the place
[43:38] of a sky.
[43:41] No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom.
[43:46] The scenery was so dull.
[43:51] Three crosses
[43:54] stood black and bold
[43:57] against
[43:58] a darken sky.
[44:02] Not from pain
[44:05] but a broken.
[44:06] [Music]
[44:14] Oh, I love
[44:18] that man.
[44:20] Tell him how much you love him this
[44:22] morning.
[44:24] [Music]
[44:26] Because I know
[44:29] he first
[44:31] loved me.
[44:36] And praise
[44:39] to the man
[44:41] who died on Mount Calvary.
[44:47] That middle man
[44:49] made it possible
[44:52] that I could go free.
[44:59] And I love
[45:03] that man
[45:05] in the middle
[45:10] because I know
[45:13] he first
[45:16] loved me.
[45:18] [Music]
[45:21] And praise
[45:23] to the man
[45:26] who died on Mount Calvary.
[45:32] That middle man
[45:34] made it possible

[45:40] could
[45:42] go free.
[45:51] Amen. Won't you stand to your feet this
[45:52] morning? I mean, say, "I fell in love
[45:55] with him
[45:56] &gt;&gt; a long time ago." Amen. Isn't it
[45:59] wonderful to serve God?
[46:03] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. Amen.

[46:25] people on fire for the Lord. Amen. Just
[46:28] to worship God. I believe that God
[46:30] created us for that. Amen. He's put
[46:32] something in us to cause us to to draw
[46:36] draw back to him. Amen. It's because we
[46:39] were a part of God. We get in the
[46:41] presence of God and there's something in
[46:43] us that just lifts our hands and it
[46:45] lifts our voice and it ain't nothing
[46:47] that we have to do on our own, but it's
[46:49] something that God just draws out of us.
[46:51] Amen. I feel like that sometimes I just
[46:54] like the like the grass or the the trees
[46:58] that are just growing and when the sun
[46:59] comes out and begins to just bake over
[47:02] them, they just stretch out their leaves
[47:04] and and bloom and all those wonderful
[47:06] things happen. That's what happens in
[47:08] the presence of the Lord. Amen. I just
[47:10] want to be able to be a worshshiper in
[47:14] the house of God. Amen. You love the
[47:15] Lord this morning. Sure. Want to say

[47:31] Andrew will be speaking for us. Most of
[47:33] the visitors have gone. That's Sunday
[47:34] morning. So we're going to have church
[47:37] and we still had a few visitors left. I
[47:39] So God bless you visitors that are here
[47:42] and we sure expect people in their local
[47:46] services meetings. They go kind of back
[47:48] to the home church on Sunday morning. So

[47:52] more. Amen. On the meeting and pray for
[47:55] all the local services the Lord really
[47:57] move in a special way. Maybe something
[48:00] that took place in the meeting that
[48:01] would be a benefit to every church.
[48:03] That's why we have the sacrifice of
[48:05] having meetings everywhere we go.
[48:08] Whether it's meeting here or down the
[48:09] road or another state, we want to be
[48:12] able to encourage the bride of Christ.

[48:18] morning
[48:21] had asked for prayer for his wife this
[48:24] morning is having some troubles with her
[48:25] spine. And maybe if there's any other
[48:28] needs this morning that you have, maybe
[48:30] just lift your hand to the Lord. God
[48:32] sees every hand. He knows what we have
[48:34] need of. We're not asking a man to do
[48:36] it. We're asking God to do it. Amen. So,

[59:48] more. Lord, may you open the windows of
[59:50] heaven this morning. And may may you
[59:52] fill this this building with your
[59:54] shakana glory. Father, I pray every

[1:00:51] verse 41.
[1:00:54] You love the Lord this morning. Amen.
[1:00:57] Luke chapter 19
[1:00:59] and verse number 41.
[1:01:03] And when he was come near, he beheld the
[1:01:06] city and wept over it, saying, If thou
[1:01:10] hadest known, even thou at least in this
[1:01:14] thy day, the things which belong unto
[1:01:18] thy peace. So at one time they belonged,
[1:01:22] but now they are hid from thine eyes.
[1:01:26] For the day shall come upon thee that
[1:01:27] thine enemy shall cast a trench about
[1:01:29] thee, and compass thee round about, and
[1:01:33] keep thee in on every side. Now, he's
[1:01:35] speaking of the destruction of
[1:01:36] Jerusalem. Now, look at verse 44. And
[1:01:39] shall lay thee even with the ground, and
[1:01:43] thy children within thee, and they shall
[1:01:46] not leave thee in one stone upon
[1:01:48] another. Now, that's a very a very dark
[1:01:51] situation.
[1:01:52] And you know why that situation is like
[1:01:54] that?
[1:01:56] Because thou kneest not the time of thy
[1:01:59] visitation.
[1:02:01] Because thou kneest not the time of thy
[1:02:04] visitation. The book of first Peter
[1:02:07] chapter 2. 1 Peter chapter 2. I want to
[1:02:09] read there
[1:02:11] in 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number
[1:02:14] 12. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:02:18] 1 Peter 2 and 12. having your
[1:02:21] conversation honest among the Gentiles,
[1:02:24] whereas they speak against you as
[1:02:26] evildoers,
[1:02:27] they may by your good works, which they
[1:02:31] shall behold, glorify God in the day of
[1:02:35] visitation.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Glorify God in the day of visitation. We
[1:02:41] ask the Lord this morning to bless the
[1:02:42] reading of his word. As you can have
[1:02:44] your seat here today from those
[1:02:45] scriptures this morning, I want to take
[1:02:47] a thought this morning. I've spoke this
[1:02:49] message uh several times and and the
[1:02:51] Lord gave it to me some some time ago
[1:02:53] and it's just been been up on my heart
[1:02:55] the past few weeks and for this morning
[1:02:57] and I pray it would be okay just to
[1:02:59] share it with you here today. But I want
[1:03:01] to draw this uh from a prayer in 1962 in
[1:03:04] the sermon the uncertain sound. Brother
[1:03:06] Ram says, "Heavenly Father, I pray the I
[1:03:08] pray the prayer for them with all my
[1:03:10] heart. I give them to you." He says,
[1:03:13] "They're trophies of the message. They
[1:03:15] are trophies of your visitation. Being
[1:03:18] here tonight, seeing you walk among us,
[1:03:20] doing works that's never been done since
[1:03:22] the foundation of the world until these
[1:03:25] last days. Here they are. They're your
[1:03:28] children. I commend them to you, Lord.
[1:03:30] You give them to us and we give them to
[1:03:32] you in the name of Jesus Christ. Watch
[1:03:34] over them and raise them up at the last
[1:03:37] day. I may never be able to shake their
[1:03:39] hands on this earth. But when the battle
[1:03:42] is over and the last trumpet is sounded
[1:03:45] and the dead has raised from the grave
[1:03:47] and the live has been called up together
[1:03:49] with them to meet the Lord in the air,
[1:03:51] then may I have fellowship with Jesus
[1:03:54] Christ and them around the throne
[1:03:56] through the eternal ages that is to
[1:03:58] come. He says, "Grant, Lord, they are
[1:04:01] yours in the name of Jesus Christ." Now,
[1:04:04] uh, from those passages this morning of
[1:04:06] Luke 19, 1 Peter 2 and that quote, I
[1:04:09] want to speak to you on this. Trophies,
[1:04:11] Amen, of his visitation.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Trophies of his visitation. Of course,
[1:04:16] brother Brandon will say in 1960, he
[1:04:19] says, now we've had healings and
[1:04:21] speaking with tongues and miracles and
[1:04:22] so forth. He says, but it's that visit
[1:04:25] is what we're looking for tonight. Amen.
[1:04:27] Amen. It's that visit is what we're
[1:04:30] looking for tonight. Again, is your life
[1:04:31] worthy of the gospel? He said when God
[1:04:34] is making a visit to the church, amen,
[1:04:37] and to the people, receive it then.
[1:04:39] Don't put it off. Amen. Until the next
[1:04:41] year or the next revival, amen, you
[1:04:44] receive it right then. Now, when you
[1:04:46] start looking here at this visitation,
[1:04:49] Amen. A visitation is a special, amen,
[1:04:52] dispensation of divine favor or wrath.
[1:04:55] So when there's a visitation, that
[1:04:57] visitation is going to cause favor,
[1:05:00] amen, to come up on your life or it's
[1:05:02] going to cause wrath, amen, to come up
[1:05:04] on your life. And the prophet would say
[1:05:06] this. He said, Christ is visiting the
[1:05:09] Gentile church now. Amen. And I know
[1:05:11] it's a time where people get to digging
[1:05:13] in their genealogies and and then they
[1:05:14] get to looking and finding maybe 2.3% of
[1:05:17] Israelite blood and all of the sudden
[1:05:19] they're Moses or Elijah or they're going
[1:05:21] to take the gospel back and they start
[1:05:23] observing feast and blowing sofars and
[1:05:25] all. Amen. But we're not a bunch of Jews
[1:05:27] here this morning. Amen. We are
[1:05:29] Gentiles. Amen. That has been saved by
[1:05:31] the blood of almighty God in this hour
[1:05:34] that we're living in. We're not trying
[1:05:36] to be something outside of what God has
[1:05:39] ordained us to be. Amen. According to
[1:05:42] the message of the hour. So we can say
[1:05:44] this morning that we are Gentiles that
[1:05:46] has been redeemed by the blood of
[1:05:49] almighty God. He said Christ is visiting
[1:05:52] the Gentile church. It's the it's the
[1:05:54] evening lights that's shining. Now the
[1:05:56] prophet said in the evening time it
[1:05:58] shall be light. He said now is this
[1:06:01] hour. This is the time. And if you'll
[1:06:03] just take that, now listen, if you'll
[1:06:05] just take that little, amen, some kind
[1:06:07] of a little something that wants to make
[1:06:09] you kind, amen, of halfway believe it,
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; and halfway doubt it. There's something
[1:06:15] that wants you to halfway believe it and
[1:06:17] something wants you to halfway doubt it.
[1:06:20] Amen. But if you'll brush that thing
[1:06:21] aside, amen, and come now. Amen. It's
[1:06:25] Christ Jesus Christ who is the son of
[1:06:28] God. And he is the same yesterday,
[1:06:30] today, and forever. Brother Ram said,
[1:06:33] "It has been proven that God is visiting
[1:06:36] the people today." He said, "God is in
[1:06:39] his church. He's trying to purge that
[1:06:41] church. He's trying to take the leaven
[1:06:43] out. He is sending messengers and signs
[1:06:46] and wonders and miracles and everything
[1:06:49] trying to prove that he loves them."
[1:06:52] Amen. And he wants to clean them up.
[1:06:55] Amen. I know it's a time where nobody
[1:06:57] wants to be preached on and cleaned up.
[1:06:59] Amen. But I want to raise my hand this
[1:07:01] morning and say, "Thank God that he
[1:07:03] loves me enough that he will allow me to
[1:07:06] sit underneath the washing of the water
[1:07:08] of the word that I would not be living a
[1:07:11] filthy life. I would not be living a
[1:07:13] contaminated life, but I would be living
[1:07:15] a life that would be saying, "Holy,
[1:07:18] holy, holy unto the Lord God Almighty."
[1:07:21] Amen. When you think about this
[1:07:22] visitation, the Bible, it actually
[1:07:25] speaks directly of the visitation in Job
[1:07:28] chapter 10 and 12. He says, "Thou hast
[1:07:30] granted me life." Amen. And favor, your
[1:07:33] favor is coming from the visitation of
[1:07:36] God. And thy visitation has preserved
[1:07:40] thy spirit. Amen. In Psalms 102 and 13,
[1:07:43] David said, "Thou shalt arise and have
[1:07:46] mercy upon Zion." Now, who is Zion?
[1:07:49] Amen. sign is a type of the bride. Amen.
[1:07:52] Thou shall arise and have mercy upon the
[1:07:55] bride for the time to favor her. Yay,
[1:07:58] the set time is come. Amen. Do you
[1:08:01] realize that God before the foundation
[1:08:04] of the world? Amen. On his calendar.
[1:08:06] Amen. Now, we we scheduled these
[1:08:08] meetings some time ago and we put it on
[1:08:10] a calendar. Amen. And now the time has
[1:08:13] come. Amen. For the meetings. The time
[1:08:15] is here. Amen. It was on a calendar and
[1:08:18] it was coming. Amen. But then someday
[1:08:20] you recognize on Wednesday and meetings
[1:08:23] are no longer coming. Amen. The meetings
[1:08:26] are here. And do you realize before the
[1:08:28] foundation of the world that God put
[1:08:31] your name on the lamb's book of life and
[1:08:34] he scheduled a time to visit you?
[1:08:37] Listen, that time is not coming. That
[1:08:39] time has not been here. That time is
[1:08:42] here right now. God is visiting the
[1:08:45] bride. Reverend said, "Oh, may the power
[1:08:47] reach down and pick up the people and
[1:08:50] shake them, Lord, and let them realize
[1:08:52] that this is the day of their
[1:08:55] visitation. This is the time that the
[1:08:58] Lord has set." Hallelujah. This is the
[1:09:01] time that the Lord has set. This is the
[1:09:04] time of their healing. I think it's
[1:09:06] powerful that every generation, Amen,
[1:09:09] receives a visitation. Brother said,
[1:09:12] "What is that?" It's when the promises
[1:09:14] of that age begin to come to pass.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; I thank thee tonight for the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:20] How many is thankful for the Holy Ghost
[1:09:22] and for the visitation of him? Amen.
[1:09:25] Right here in this building, even right
[1:09:27] here now, the very spirit according to
[1:09:30] the word of God which is infallible and
[1:09:33] cannot fail. He says the same spirit,
[1:09:36] now y'all want to preach this morning.
[1:09:38] The same spirit, amen, that raised Jesus
[1:09:41] from the grave is right here in our
[1:09:45] midst. Now, that's not me. That's not
[1:09:48] another preacher. That is a vindicated
[1:09:51] prophet making a declaration that the
[1:09:54] same spirit that walked into that
[1:09:56] borrowed tomb and raised our Lord Jesus
[1:09:58] on the third day, that spirit is not a
[1:10:01] million miles away, but he's right here
[1:10:04] in the building this morning. And if
[1:10:06] your eyes can come open to the reality,
[1:10:09] this is not just a tent meeting. This is
[1:10:12] not just a Sunday morning service. This
[1:10:14] is not just a bunch of religious people
[1:10:16] gathering up here to sing a few songs.
[1:10:19] This is God returning in flesh to visit
[1:10:22] this generation. I say if there's ever
[1:10:25] been a time, Amen. Now is the time. Now
[1:10:28] is the season. Amen. If not you, then
[1:10:31] who? If not now, then when? if not this
[1:10:34] message and what's going to get us ready
[1:10:36] for a rapture. But I stand here this
[1:10:38] morning and propose unto you that this
[1:10:41] is the final call. This is the Eleazar
[1:10:44] call. This is the message God has
[1:10:47] prophesied to be sent in this age. My if
[1:10:51] there's ever been a time, now is the
[1:10:53] time to realize the seriousness of the
[1:10:57] visitation of God as it was in the days
[1:11:00] of Noah. How many knows we're living in
[1:11:02] those days again?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; So will it be only this time, brother
[1:11:08] said, instead of water, it'll be fire.
[1:11:10] Now, amen. The world will be rocked by
[1:11:12] atomic power. Oh God, may men and women
[1:11:16] everywhere realize the seriousness of
[1:11:19] the visitation of God. He says, "The
[1:11:21] gospel is being preached like it was in
[1:11:24] the days of Noah." Now listen, it's
[1:11:27] fanaticism to the world, but it's
[1:11:29] glorious. And it's welcome to those who
[1:11:33] are willing to come in into the ark of
[1:11:36] safety which is Christ. Amen. Now Zion
[1:11:39] is a type of the bride. Right? Amen. So
[1:11:42] now, amen, is the time of favor. Can I
[1:11:45] say this? It's a divine favor for the
[1:11:47] sons of God. In 1 John chapter 3 and 1,
[1:11:50] he says, "Behold what manner of love the
[1:11:53] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:11:56] should be called
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; the sons of God. Therefore the world
[1:12:02] knoweth us not." Now listen, "Because it
[1:12:05] knew him not." He says, "Now beloved,"
[1:12:08] somebody say this, "now."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and
[1:12:14] if not yet appear what we shall be, but
[1:12:17] we know that when he shall appear, we
[1:12:20] shall be like him, for we shall see him
[1:12:23] as he is. Now, let me say this. He did
[1:12:25] not say we're going to be the sons of
[1:12:28] God. He says, "But right now, we are the
[1:12:31] sons of God." I can hear a prophet stand
[1:12:33] in God rich in mercy and say, "That's
[1:12:35] why I have come to get you away from
[1:12:38] this fear and scare. You're not going to
[1:12:40] be the sons and daughters of God, but
[1:12:42] right now you are the sons and the
[1:12:45] daughters of God." Listen, now is the
[1:12:48] hour. Now is the time. I love that word
[1:12:50] now. You know what it means? It means
[1:12:52] the present. So right now in the
[1:12:55] present, amen, you are the sons of God.
[1:12:58] It's the hour. It's the time. It's the
[1:13:00] accepted hour. It's the acceptable year.
[1:13:03] He said now is when miracles take place.
[1:13:06] He said now is when Christ is revealing
[1:13:09] himself. Here we are now. Amen. Not in
[1:13:12] the future. He says the devil keeps
[1:13:15] pushing it off. Amen. That's
[1:13:16] Catholicism. He said now is the day.
[1:13:20] This is the hour. This is the time. This
[1:13:23] is the place. Amen. Right now. This is
[1:13:26] the day. You know what he said? He said,
[1:13:28] "There's things we are seeing today that
[1:13:31] could not happen 20 years ago. It could
[1:13:34] not happen 40 years ago, but it's
[1:13:36] happening today because this is the
[1:13:40] hour." Oh my. At the end of the token,
[1:13:42] he stands there and he says, "If there
[1:13:44] be a seed anywhere that's predestinated,
[1:13:48] Lord, to hear the word of this last day,
[1:13:50] may they come now. May they come now."
[1:13:54] Amen. Sweetly and humbly. Listen. and
[1:13:57] lay their trophies down at the cross and
[1:14:00] watch a prophet turn a corner or their
[1:14:03] self as a trophy. Amen. So they're not
[1:14:05] bringing something and laying it at the
[1:14:08] feet of Jesus. But a prophet said them
[1:14:10] themselves are going to be the trophies
[1:14:14] of the grace of God that has called them
[1:14:17] and may they be filled with the Holy
[1:14:19] Spirit. And may they display the token
[1:14:22] of the life of Jesus Christ in his
[1:14:24] resurrection as long as they remain here
[1:14:28] on the earth. Can I say this to you? A
[1:14:31] trophy is to be displayed. Nobody gets a
[1:14:35] trophy and hides it in a corner. Nobody
[1:14:38] gets a trophy and puts it somewhere that
[1:14:41] nobody can see. Come on, brothers. Amen.
[1:14:43] Amen. You kill a nice deer, that deer
[1:14:46] ain't hid somewhere in your shack out
[1:14:48] back. It's on the wall. It's where
[1:14:51] everybody can see that you somewhere
[1:14:54] have got a trophy. You know what the
[1:14:56] word trophy means? It means something
[1:14:58] gained or achieved or given in victory
[1:15:02] or conquest. Especially when preserved
[1:15:05] or mounted as a memorial. A trophy is a
[1:15:09] representation of such a memorial as a
[1:15:12] game animal or a fish or for mounting as
[1:15:16] a trophy. It is usually used
[1:15:19] attributively. I remember the first
[1:15:21] time, amen, I sat on a creek bait for
[1:15:23] years fishing. My great-granddaddy would
[1:15:24] take me and I'd sit there and fishing
[1:15:26] fish and I just thought I knew about
[1:15:28] fishing. And I remember the first day I
[1:15:30] hooked a fish, you know, it was a little
[1:15:32] old trout, probably about that big. And
[1:15:34] I pulled it out of the water and I held
[1:15:35] it up and grandad said, "Well," he said,
[1:15:37] "Put it back in there and then we'll
[1:15:39] hide it and get it out of here." And I
[1:15:40] remember taking it. I wanted to get it
[1:15:42] mounted, you know. And he said, "That
[1:15:43] ain't worth spending money on. It's too
[1:15:45] small." Now, now listen to me. It was a
[1:15:48] trophy because it was the first fish I
[1:15:50] caught. But can I tell you this that
[1:15:52] there was a first pull and it gathered
[1:15:55] some little fish. There was a second
[1:15:57] pull and it gathered some more little
[1:15:59] fish. But then there was a third pull
[1:16:01] which was not a healing. It was not a
[1:16:03] discernment. It was not a gift. It was
[1:16:06] the opening of the word. It was the
[1:16:08] revealing of seven seals. Oh church, it
[1:16:11] didn't gather a bunch of little blue
[1:16:12] gill. It didn't gather a bunch of carp.
[1:16:15] But when that third pull began to pull,
[1:16:17] it was gathering some rainbow trout.
[1:16:19] That was going to be more than church
[1:16:21] members. They were going to be more than
[1:16:23] religious people. They were going to be
[1:16:25] trophies of the grace of God in the hour
[1:16:28] of visitation. Hallelujah. God didn't
[1:16:31] hook you to throw you back. He hooked
[1:16:33] you to mount you. Well, glory to God.
[1:16:36] Let me shout a little bit on that. God
[1:16:38] didn't hook you, Amen, to throw you
[1:16:40] away. He hooked you to mount you and to
[1:16:44] preserve you and to display you.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A trophy is an expressed
[1:16:51] attribute of victory.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Now you know I'm in Christ the mystery,
[1:16:57] God's secret mystery.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; He had before the world began. Now it
[1:17:04] was in the back part of God's mind.
[1:17:06] There was something he was trying and
[1:17:09] was going to achieve. He had a motive in
[1:17:11] doing it in order to let himself be
[1:17:15] expressed. Now, before there was a moon,
[1:17:18] star, molecule, or anything, he was God.
[1:17:20] But he wasn't exactly God at that time
[1:17:23] because God is an object to worship and
[1:17:27] there was nothing to worship him. So in
[1:17:30] his great mind,
[1:17:32] oh God, he wanted these attributes to be
[1:17:34] expressed.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; In him was love. Brother Nathan, in him
[1:17:40] was to be a father. In him was to be
[1:17:42] son. In him was to be a savior. In him
[1:17:45] was to be a healer. All these great
[1:17:47] attributes were already in him. Now, do
[1:17:51] you realize the only thing there to
[1:17:52] worship him was angels? The angels were
[1:17:55] created for the purpose of worship. Now
[1:17:58] listen, he could sit there and he could
[1:18:00] look at them angels and he could say, "I
[1:18:02] am a savior." And they would say, "Yes,
[1:18:04] Lord, you're a savior." He could say,
[1:18:06] "Oh no, no, listen to me. I'm a healer.
[1:18:09] And they would say, "Yes, Lord, you're a
[1:18:10] healer." He would say, "No, let me let
[1:18:12] me let me let me try to break it down
[1:18:14] some more. I'm a deliverer." And they
[1:18:17] would say, "Yes, Lord, you are a
[1:18:19] deliverer." Amen. But he was not
[1:18:21] receiving from them what he wanted.
[1:18:24] Because they could say what he was by
[1:18:26] knowledge. But there could not say by
[1:18:29] experience he was a savior. They could
[1:18:32] not say by experience he was a healer.
[1:18:34] They could not say by experience he was
[1:18:36] a deliverer. So God, amen, wanted
[1:18:39] somebody that could testify by more than
[1:18:42] just a word. They could testify by an
[1:18:44] experience. Oh, this morning church, you
[1:18:47] say, "Why does God inhabit the praises
[1:18:50] of his people?" Because he sends a man
[1:18:52] of God behind the pull pit and he begins
[1:18:55] to say, "God is a savior and God is a
[1:18:58] healer and God is a deliverer." And
[1:19:00] there's some trophies that can begin to
[1:19:02] lift up their voice. They can begin to
[1:19:04] raise up their hands. They can begin to
[1:19:06] shout aloud, "Yes, you are a savior
[1:19:09] because you saved me. Yes, you are a
[1:19:12] healer because you healed me. Yes, you
[1:19:15] are a deliverer because I was bound on
[1:19:18] my way to hell. But you reached down and
[1:19:21] you picked me up and you turned me
[1:19:23] around and you set my feet on solid
[1:19:26] ground.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Trophies of his attributes." That's why
[1:19:33] a prophet said that you are nothing but
[1:19:36] the manifestation of the gene of life
[1:19:39] that was in God as a son of God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Do you realize what happened to you? The
[1:19:44] word of God got into you.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And a prophet said the word of God, he
[1:19:49] said it lit our souls.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. It lit our souls and
[1:19:56] we become the sons and daughters of God
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; with the attributes the gene of God in
[1:20:03] us to be sons and daughters of the
[1:20:05] father. You know what he said? God in
[1:20:07] heaven crying aby father my god my god
[1:20:14] in my father's house. Now, I love it
[1:20:16] because when you study through the
[1:20:18] message, you will find that brother Ram
[1:20:20] speaks a lot about trophies. But the
[1:20:22] majority of the times when he speaks
[1:20:24] about them, he'll speak about them in
[1:20:26] prayer. He'll say things like this. They
[1:20:28] are trophies of this meeting. He'll say
[1:20:32] trophies of the message. Brother Brian,
[1:20:34] they are trophies of the presence of the
[1:20:36] Lord. They are trophies of the grace of
[1:20:39] God. They are trophies of the spirit of
[1:20:41] grace. They are trophies of this
[1:20:43] revival. They are trophies of Christ's
[1:20:45] love at Calvary. They are trophies of
[1:20:47] the gospel that has been preached. They
[1:20:49] are trophies of your word being made
[1:20:52] manifest. Amen. Preached by the spirit
[1:20:54] of the Lord. Amen. They are trophies of
[1:20:56] the evening time light. Oh, I love this.
[1:20:58] He said, "Lord, they're trophies of the
[1:21:01] ministry of the seventh angel."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not ashamed to be identified
[1:21:07] as a trophy of the ministry of the
[1:21:10] seventh angel. I love it when the
[1:21:11] prophet of God, amen, refers to
[1:21:13] trophies. He automatically refers to
[1:21:16] people. And he'll refer to these
[1:21:17] scriptures in John 5:24. He'll say,
[1:21:19] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:21:22] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:21:24] that sent me hath everlasting life, and
[1:21:27] shall not come into condemnation, but is
[1:21:30] passed from death unto life." In St.
[1:21:33] John 6:37 referring to trophies connects
[1:21:36] this scripture. All that the father
[1:21:38] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[1:21:41] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
[1:21:45] In St. John 10:28 I give unto them
[1:21:48] eternal life. I give my trophies eternal
[1:21:52] life and they shall never perish.
[1:21:55] Neither shall any man amen pluck them
[1:21:58] out of my hand. For my father which gave
[1:22:01] them me is greater than all. and no man
[1:22:03] is able to pluck them, amen, out of my
[1:22:06] father's hand. Well, it's time to put
[1:22:08] your preaching boots on this morning and
[1:22:10] preach back to that devil of
[1:22:12] condemnation and preach back to that
[1:22:14] devil of doom and gloom and say, "Devil,
[1:22:16] I know that you've been telling me one
[1:22:18] day that God is going to lose me." But I
[1:22:21] come here this morning to testify unto
[1:22:23] you that you are a liar and you are the
[1:22:25] father of all lies. I've got my God on
[1:22:28] record, saying he will give me eternal
[1:22:31] life, and I will never perish. He will
[1:22:33] raise me up again in the last day, and
[1:22:36] all the Father giveth him, no man shall
[1:22:39] be able to pluck them out of his hand.
[1:22:41] Well, I want to tell that devil, drugs
[1:22:43] won't get you, and alcohol won't get
[1:22:45] you, and pornography won't get you, and
[1:22:48] the world won't get you. If God's got
[1:22:50] your name on the lamb's book of life, it
[1:22:53] was put there from before the foundation
[1:22:55] of the world. And there is no devil big
[1:22:58] enough, bad enough, or strong enough,
[1:23:00] amen, to change what God scheduled on
[1:23:03] his calendar in the age you're living
[1:23:05] in.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are trophies that God
[1:23:11] has given his son Christ Jesus by the
[1:23:13] power of his presence and the word of
[1:23:16] God. I love that. Then let me say this
[1:23:19] to you this morning. Amen. The message
[1:23:21] of the hour is a claiming message. Amen.
[1:23:24] It's not a good feelgood message and a
[1:23:26] little shouting Pentecostal message.
[1:23:28] This message is a claiming message.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Can I say what the prophet said?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I claim them for you tonight,
[1:23:38] Jesus. As your own personal treasure,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; as gems in your crown, as members of
[1:23:45] your bride, I claim their lives." What?
[1:23:49] Watch here in the sixth seal. I got a
[1:23:51] question for you, okay? If God claims
[1:23:53] you, then what done the claimment?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Rabbit said, "Look, and may
[1:23:58] every called child of God that's in
[1:24:00] hearing distance of here or either the
[1:24:03] tapes shall strike." Listen, there's
[1:24:05] people sitting right here this morning
[1:24:07] that were the majority of us were not in
[1:24:10] brother Brandham's meetings. We were not
[1:24:12] in the meetings, but we're here this
[1:24:14] morning. Amen. You know why? Because he
[1:24:16] said, "Wherever the message strikes,
[1:24:18] whether they're in hearing distance of
[1:24:20] hearing me physically or my tapes will
[1:24:23] get to them, may it strike them. And if
[1:24:26] that time I claim them for the kingdom
[1:24:28] of God, upon the basis of knowing this,
[1:24:31] the word that's being revealed, oh
[1:24:34] church of the living God, that's why you
[1:24:36] prevail over every devil. That's why you
[1:24:38] overcome every bad day. That's why when
[1:24:41] the devil knocks you down, you get up
[1:24:43] again because you were not claimed by a
[1:24:45] preacher. You were not claimed by a good
[1:24:47] feeling. You were claimed by revelation.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And there is nothing
[1:24:54] as strong and as powerful as the
[1:24:56] prevailing power of revelation. Oh, let
[1:25:00] me say it very plainly. You didn't claim
[1:25:02] this message. Amen. Amen. You didn't
[1:25:04] claim this message. This message claimed
[1:25:07] you. Some of you all weren't looking for
[1:25:09] this message. You weren't hunting this
[1:25:11] message, but somehow or another a tape
[1:25:13] got within the hearing distance of your
[1:25:15] ears or somewhere you saw a book and you
[1:25:18] begin to read that book and something
[1:25:20] begin to say, "That's what I've been
[1:25:21] looking for." You were full of
[1:25:23] questions, but you begin to hear this
[1:25:25] message and it begin to be answer upon
[1:25:28] top of answer upon top of answer because
[1:25:30] it was more than just another preacher.
[1:25:33] It was more than just another sermon. It
[1:25:36] was the visitation of almighty God in
[1:25:39] this generation claiming you.
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I feel like shout.
[1:25:48] I'll shout my way to the tent back if I
[1:25:50] got to. I've been claimed. A church
[1:25:53] didn't claim me.
[1:25:56] Oh, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:25:57] Amen. Well, if you leave, you're lost.
[1:25:59] And if you do this, you fall apart.
[1:26:01] That's a lying devil.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I got some friends here this
[1:26:04] morning that God went to the Amish
[1:26:06] community and pulled them out of there.
[1:26:08] And devils told them, "If you leave, you
[1:26:10] won't have nothing. And if you forsake
[1:26:12] this, you'll be lost." But here they are
[1:26:15] this morning in the house of God with
[1:26:17] their hands up in the air with their
[1:26:19] families in the house of God baptized in
[1:26:22] the name of Jesus. It wasn't Matt Morris
[1:26:24] claiming them. It was God Elohim
[1:26:27] returning to this generation in a
[1:26:29] visitation to reveal his word and claim
[1:26:33] him.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I rebuke that devil in the
[1:26:37] name of Jesus.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; God claimed you.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't claim you by accident.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He claimed you on purpose,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; by a purpose.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And for a purpose.
[1:26:57] claims your own purpose.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Claims you for a purpose.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I wish I was a singer right now.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; I feel good this morning.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; I'd sing my old buddy Danny Ferberg
[1:27:12] song. I just started living.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what that devil says. That
[1:27:17] devil says I'm sorry. Some of you elders
[1:27:19] probably know what I'm talking about.
[1:27:20] And that you you the devil says you're
[1:27:21] over and you're finished. But can I say
[1:27:23] this? How many can testify when the
[1:27:26] devil told you it was finished? When the
[1:27:28] devil told you you were crazy, you say,
[1:27:30] "Wow, how could this be crazy when I
[1:27:32] just broke into a whole new realm of
[1:27:34] living?"
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, when they said, "If you
[1:27:37] do this and you do that, oh, amen." But
[1:27:39] here you are this morning with your
[1:27:41] hands up in the air. A man didn't claim
[1:27:43] you. A movement didn't claim you, but
[1:27:45] God from before the foundation of the
[1:27:48] world. He claimed you.
[1:27:53] And I want to tell that devil, God's
[1:27:54] trophies are not dead trophies. They're
[1:27:56] living trophies.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to go. You Oh my. If you
[1:28:01] got a trophy, Brother David, somebody's
[1:28:03] got to tell the story about that trophy.
[1:28:06] Somebody's got to be standing there to
[1:28:08] tell the story about that trophy. Oh,
[1:28:11] but if you want to know the story,
[1:28:12] Brother Bobby, about this trophy from
[1:28:15] the heels of East Tennessee. Well, you
[1:28:17] ain't got to ask nobody. I'll tell you
[1:28:19] myself. I was born in sin. I was shaped
[1:28:22] in iniquity. I come in the world
[1:28:23] speaking lies. I was bound for a devil's
[1:28:26] hell and a sinner's grave. But God who
[1:28:29] is rich in mercy wherein he loved me
[1:28:31] before I haven't done good or evil. He
[1:28:34] called me and chose me.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got a testimony.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Even when we were dead in sin,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; hath he quickened us together
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; with Christ
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; by grace? By
[1:28:51] grace
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; ye are saved.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I love that word dead. It means
[1:28:57] spiritually dead.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; It means destitute of a life that
[1:29:02] recognizes God.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; My
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So if you're dead,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; you're spiritually dead
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; and you're destitute of alive to
[1:29:11] recognize God when he comes in your
[1:29:14] midst. Now listen what a prophet said.
[1:29:16] He said, "Here is those who were dead
[1:29:19] and has been raised up.
[1:29:22] There is those here who were in
[1:29:24] accidents. They were smashed up, but
[1:29:27] they are healed." He said, "I see Miss
[1:29:29] Wilson standing here. Not long ago, she
[1:29:32] was hemorrhaging to death with TB years
[1:29:34] ago. Here she is tonight. The doctors
[1:29:38] didn't give her but just hours to live.
[1:29:41] But here she stands tonight.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; All around through here, lame, blind,
[1:29:47] crippled, in wheelchairs, and
[1:29:49] everything, they're standing tonight
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; as living trophies.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. They're standing here
[1:29:59] tonight as living trophies. Why is it?
[1:30:04] Because Jesus Christ lives. He is the
[1:30:07] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:30:10] Listen, I'm just going to go enjoy
[1:30:11] myself. Amen. Some of y'all shouldn't be
[1:30:14] sitting here tonight. Amen. Amen. I
[1:30:16] don't mean to get too open with you.
[1:30:17] Amen. But Sister Leah, you shouldn't be
[1:30:19] sitting there tonight. Amen. That
[1:30:21] accident should have taken you out and
[1:30:23] all the surgeries and all the things you
[1:30:25] you shouldn't be sitting here tonight.
[1:30:27] Amen. But there she sits as a trophy of
[1:30:30] the grace of God.
[1:30:32] Brother Joe, you shouldn't be sitting on
[1:30:34] the front row after everything you've
[1:30:36] been through and everything you face.
[1:30:38] You shouldn't be here. But here you are
[1:30:40] today, not as just a church member, not
[1:30:43] as just a preacher, not as just a father
[1:30:45] or a husband, but as a trophy of the
[1:30:48] preserving power of almighty God. That
[1:30:51] when a man hits a bottom and he can't
[1:30:53] find a reason to lift his head, he
[1:30:55] remembers Psalm three saying, "I am the
[1:30:58] lifter up of your head and he can rise
[1:31:00] again and declare the works of God."
[1:31:03] Come on. I could go through this whole
[1:31:04] building right now. You shouldn't be
[1:31:06] sitting here tonight, Sister Joyce, but
[1:31:08] here you are. Amen. You shouldn't be
[1:31:10] here today, church, but here you are.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't have been here, Brother David,
[1:31:18] but here we are. You know why? Because
[1:31:20] there's been a visitation.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; There's been a visitation in this
[1:31:26] generation. And it was more than just a
[1:31:29] good healing campaign.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; It was more than just a good meeting. It
[1:31:33] was a supernatural manifestation. And
[1:31:35] you know how it was done? It was not
[1:31:37] done through the works of a
[1:31:39] denomination. It was not done, brother
[1:31:41] Kevin, through the works of a man. It
[1:31:44] was done through the visitation of the
[1:31:46] biblical angel of the Lord.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; My Can I preach this morning, we'd all
[1:31:54] say 25 or 35,000 people prayed for,
[1:31:57] maybe more than that, and there's been
[1:31:59] at least 10,000 of them healed. Would
[1:32:01] you think that such as cancers that are
[1:32:04] laying there at their last moment?
[1:32:06] Cancers laying there at their last
[1:32:08] moment. But they are all well people
[1:32:11] since the last meeting. Well, I guess in
[1:32:14] the provinces of Canada alone, there was
[1:32:17] at least 250 or maybe more than that
[1:32:19] cases, amen, of crosseyed people with
[1:32:22] their eyes straightened and mutes.
[1:32:24] Listen, it's innumerable to count them.
[1:32:27] For there was multiplied scores of them
[1:32:29] that came that were some deaf, that were
[1:32:32] some dumb, that were some heart of
[1:32:34] hearing, and everything were made
[1:32:36] perfectly whole.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, are y'all hearing me? Everything was
[1:32:42] made perfectly whole. He said, "Now, now
[1:32:45] that's only done through the visitation
[1:32:48] of that angel."
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. church. It's only done through
[1:32:54] the visitation of that angel. So God
[1:32:57] gives signs. He gives fore warnings of
[1:33:00] his visitation. In other words, can I
[1:33:02] say it to you like this? God don't show
[1:33:04] up unannounced.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Oh no." He said, "If I
[1:33:07] come here to Phoenix in the name of a
[1:33:09] prophet, are you enjoying the word?
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; If I come here in the name of a prophet
[1:33:13] and I do not the things that a prophet
[1:33:15] does, then don't believe me. But if I
[1:33:18] come in the name of the Lord Jesus, in
[1:33:21] the name of prophecy and as his servant,
[1:33:23] and I do the things that is written of
[1:33:25] his servant, then you believe me. Will
[1:33:28] you do that? If the deaf don't hear and
[1:33:31] the dumb don't speak and the blind don't
[1:33:33] see and the cripples don't walk, if
[1:33:36] prophecies of sin isn't foretold, the
[1:33:39] people and your sins from the time you
[1:33:41] was a child foretold, then believe that
[1:33:44] this angel come to me is false. Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm false with it,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; but
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Carter, but if it manifests
[1:33:56] itself here on the platform before you,
[1:33:59] you believe it and repent of your sins
[1:34:01] and your disbelief for this hour of his
[1:34:04] visitation is drawing near. That's
[1:34:06] right. He's done only things to confirm
[1:34:09] his word. Glory to God. He was only
[1:34:12] healing the sick to confirm his word. He
[1:34:15] was only discerning the thoughts of the
[1:34:17] intents of the heart to confirm his
[1:34:20] word. And you all know, amen, that the
[1:34:22] father was in the son, right? Amen. And
[1:34:24] the son was in the father. You know what
[1:34:26] a prophet said? He said, "And God is in
[1:34:28] you." You know what Jesus said? He said,
[1:34:31] "The Father that dwelleth in me, he
[1:34:34] doeth the works." He said, "Believe me
[1:34:36] that I am in the Father and the Father
[1:34:38] in me, or else believe me for the very
[1:34:41] works sake." Verily, verily, which means
[1:34:43] absolutely. Absolutely. I say unto you,
[1:34:46] my I'm feeling good this morning. I say
[1:34:49] unto you, he that believeth on me, the
[1:34:52] works that I do shall he do also.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And greater works, brother Morgan, and
[1:34:59] greater works than these sh.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:04] What was he declaring? He was declared,
[1:35:07] "When I leave in a corporal body, it is
[1:35:10] not the ceasing of my visitation, but I
[1:35:13] will return again in the spirit of
[1:35:15] truth. I will send you a comforter. I
[1:35:18] will send you a guide."
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like kicking that devil's
[1:35:22] square in the face this morning. He said
[1:35:24] in Jesus in his ministry, now this was
[1:35:26] Jesus ministry. He said, "Now look, look
[1:35:29] here. More, not greater, cuz he raised
[1:35:32] the dead.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; He stopped the nature. He said, "Nothing
[1:35:35] could be any greater than what he did.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; But more than this
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; shall you do."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. More than this shall
[1:35:45] ye do. Now you say, "Preacher, you're
[1:35:47] way out there and you're going beyond
[1:35:49] the Bible and you're going beyond the
[1:35:50] inspired word of God." He said, "Now,
[1:35:53] the same thing he did, he promised the
[1:35:55] church to do
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; only would do more of it
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; than what he did." Now you say you ain't
[1:36:04] got Bible for that. Oh I do. It's called
[1:36:06] St. John 21:25. And there are also many
[1:36:10] other things which Jesus did the which
[1:36:13] if they should be written everyone.
[1:36:16] Well, I suppose that even the world
[1:36:18] itself could not contain the books
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; could not contain the books.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; The world could not contain the books of
[1:36:30] what has been done. He said, "Now I wish
[1:36:33] I could testify a little bit now." You
[1:36:34] know, John said or Luke, he said, "If
[1:36:36] all Jesus done would be put in the
[1:36:38] books, there wasn't enough books in the
[1:36:40] world to write him." Now, just what I've
[1:36:42] seen in my own ministry. Brother Bam
[1:36:44] here. I've seen him do, you couldn't
[1:36:47] pile the volumes on this platform, if I
[1:36:50] wrote it in the details of what I've
[1:36:52] seen him do just in my own ministry.
[1:36:54] Amen. Seen him do. Now, listen to the
[1:36:56] prophet, will you? He said, "See, he had
[1:36:59] more success in my ministry."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I know that's a hard one, Brother David,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; but I know you believe it.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had more success in my ministry
[1:37:12] than he did in his own. Now, remember,
[1:37:15] he had more success
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; in my ministry than he did in his own.
[1:37:22] Not me. He had he had more success in
[1:37:25] Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth.
[1:37:28] He finally broke through here. He said
[1:37:30] so he had more success right here than
[1:37:33] he did in Capernium or in Nazareth in
[1:37:35] that he said now remember he done. Now
[1:37:39] it never said I done it. See? No. Cuz I
[1:37:42] didn't do it. I just didn't. I just
[1:37:44] loved him.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; How many loves him? I just loved him and
[1:37:50] just submitted myself to him and said
[1:37:53] what he said and the Holy Spirit went to
[1:37:57] the other people and they believed what
[1:37:59] he said. Then he done the work.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh church of the living God, I can shout
[1:38:05] aloud this morning and right here in the
[1:38:08] year of 2025 there has been a visitation
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; brother David Paul right here. The world
[1:38:15] don't write about it today. It's not on
[1:38:17] the headlines of the Lawrence County
[1:38:19] headline news. It's not on the news of
[1:38:21] the world. But can I tell you all
[1:38:23] something? You think I'm crazy if you
[1:38:25] want to. I really don't care. There has
[1:38:26] been a visitation of God right here this
[1:38:29] weekend.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; The same as it was in Jesus. The same as
[1:38:36] it was in Brother Brandham. It's been
[1:38:38] right here.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:38:44] No, I haven't. Wherever the message of
[1:38:46] the hour is preached, it's a visitation
[1:38:49] of Almighty God. Well, I say this
[1:38:52] morning, we ought to put on our happy
[1:38:54] shoes. We ought to put on our shouting
[1:38:56] shoes that God has visited this
[1:38:59] generation.
[1:39:03] You say, "Brother Amy, you're getting
[1:39:04] way out there." Well, you know what I'm
[1:39:05] talking about. I'm talking about the
[1:39:07] Bible. You know, the Bible speaks of the
[1:39:09] day of visitation. Amen. Amen. Are you
[1:39:11] with me?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Is it okay?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The day of visitation, the hour of
[1:39:16] visitation, the time of visitation, the
[1:39:19] day of salvation. Listen. Amen. The day
[1:39:21] or hour of visitation was speaking of
[1:39:24] the coming of the Messiah. Listen. That
[1:39:27] would be the very presence of God
[1:39:29] himself.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it beautiful. He
[1:39:33] said, "A visit is a communion."
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; The very presence of God would visit the
[1:39:41] Jews and they missed it. Now listen, if
[1:39:44] thou hast known, listen, the things
[1:39:48] which belong unto thy peace, but now
[1:39:51] they are hid from thine eyes. For the
[1:39:54] day shall come upon thee, that thine
[1:39:56] enemy shall cast a trench about thee,
[1:39:58] and compass thee roundabout, and keep
[1:40:01] thee in on every side, and they shall
[1:40:03] lay even with the ground. Now, now I
[1:40:04] want y'all to catch this. Now, they were
[1:40:07] carrying children, Brother Brian. They
[1:40:09] were carrying children and the Bible
[1:40:12] said, "You shall lay in the ground and
[1:40:15] thy children within thee."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Now folks, I don't mean to end the meet
[1:40:20] and heavy, but that's just on my heart
[1:40:22] to preach a second.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Thy children within thee shall lay in
[1:40:26] the same ditch. Now look here up on one
[1:40:29] to another. Because thou kneest not the
[1:40:31] time of thy visitation. In other words,
[1:40:35] if you miss your visitation,
[1:40:40] You will spiritually kill the next
[1:40:42] generation.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. I might as well preach.
[1:40:47] I'm here.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; If you miss your spiritual visitation,
[1:40:51] you will spiritually kill the next
[1:40:54] generation. I'm just going to get it out
[1:40:56] there. I think that's why we better let
[1:40:57] the Holy Ghost tame our tongues before
[1:40:59] we start talking about shouting and
[1:41:01] dancing and rejoicing and praising God.
[1:41:08] Come on. I said come on. Because words
[1:41:11] have power. Do you realize right now
[1:41:14] there's something in you? Oh my. I can
[1:41:15] hear my buddy brother Tim Puit say it
[1:41:17] right now. I'm spiritually pregnant. I
[1:41:20] got a baby on the inside of me. I got
[1:41:22] the word and it's kicking. I can feel
[1:41:25] its muscles twitching. I can feel it
[1:41:27] moving. It's on the inside of me. But if
[1:41:30] we repeat what the Jews done, if we
[1:41:32] reject the visitation
[1:41:35] of God to our generation, we will lay
[1:41:38] our babies within us in spiritual dead
[1:41:41] ditches. Oh, I say God. Amen. Let us
[1:41:44] padlock the doors and board up the
[1:41:46] windows and go drink coffee somewhere
[1:41:48] before the day ever comes in this church
[1:41:50] or any message church that we reject the
[1:41:54] visitation of the almighty God through
[1:41:56] the vindicated message of the hour.
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; I know I say God bless David Ser last
[1:42:06] night. It ain't popular to stand there
[1:42:07] and say them things but he stood here
[1:42:09] and said them.
[1:42:10] Bunch of YouTube preachers and oh God, I
[1:42:13] got to keep my
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I got to keep my I got to keep my
[1:42:16] pullpit matters.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I lost them. Bunch of uninspired,
[1:42:21] politically motivated YouTube preachers
[1:42:24] trying to reason away what a prophet
[1:42:26] said. I say, God bless a man like David
[1:42:28] Syler that'll stand here and say, "No
[1:42:31] believer has got a right marrying an
[1:42:33] unbeliever."
[1:42:36] I felt that devil pushed back. You got
[1:42:38] the wrong guy. I'll push back because I
[1:42:41] refuse to sit in a church and watch
[1:42:44] worldlyism kill the next generation. Cuz
[1:42:47] nobody's got the guts to take off the
[1:42:49] gloves and say what a prophet said. I
[1:42:53] don't care who it is. I don't care what
[1:42:55] your last name is. We got a message. And
[1:42:58] when that message is preached, it's a
[1:43:00] visitation of almighty God to this
[1:43:03] generation.
[1:43:06] Well, brother, that got on my toes.
[1:43:08] That's called God visiting you.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody shout
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; See that's why you got a generation
[1:43:22] question. What brother said.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Because somewhere somebody left a
[1:43:28] visitation pass by
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Well, that's just
[1:43:31] brother Matt's opinion
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and that's just David Brother David's
[1:43:37] opin.
[1:43:38] That's just them old fogy preachers up
[1:43:40] there. That's just
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; But you know what my Bible says? My
[1:43:45] Bible says the woman sit at the well.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; And the very one that they rejected down
[1:43:50] at the church house.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; The very one, Sister Cindy, they
[1:43:56] rejected down there at the church house,
[1:43:58] he walked to the whale. God have mercy.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I disconnected last night. He w they
[1:44:03] walked to the well and the woman was
[1:44:05] sitting at the well.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; And you know what the Bible said? They
[1:44:10] told him up there, you're bey.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; They told him, "You're a fortune
[1:44:15] teller." They told him, "You're a
[1:44:16] vampire." They called him all kinds of
[1:44:18] things. But you know what she said? She
[1:44:20] said, "I know."
[1:44:24] Brother Mark, she said, "I know that
[1:44:26] when Messiah cometh, which is called
[1:44:28] Christ." Brother Joe, he will tell us
[1:44:31] all things.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm just that guy. You know
[1:44:35] what that word know means in the Greek?
[1:44:37] It means to have an interview with.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; It means to visit.
[1:44:45] When she begin to talk to the Messiah
[1:44:47] and she begin to say, "I know that
[1:44:50] you're the one that the Bible prophesied
[1:44:52] of, she be to have a visitation."
[1:44:56] Brother said, "Oh, what happened?" He
[1:44:57] said, "The woman at the well, she
[1:44:59] recognized her day by the sign of the
[1:45:02] Messiah." Oh, can I say it to you? When
[1:45:05] she recognized the hour, her visitation,
[1:45:08] she became a trophy of the Messiah's
[1:45:11] visitation.
[1:45:13] [Applause]
[1:45:16] to her generation. When God visits you,
[1:45:19] you'll either accept it or you'll reject
[1:45:21] it. Can I say what a prophet said? He
[1:45:24] said, "So many of them missed it in that
[1:45:25] day." He said, "Now don't you miss it in
[1:45:27] your day.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Not me now. Him.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; It's the day of his visitation. It's not
[1:45:36] me. I'm just a poor substitute of
[1:45:39] anything." But it's him moving.
[1:45:42] Brother Travis, it's him moving. It's
[1:45:45] him working. He just give me a way, a
[1:45:48] gift to yield myself to him and do the
[1:45:51] things for your benefit,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; not for mine, for yours. Glory to God.
[1:45:58] Holiness is for your benefit. Church
[1:46:00] order is for your benefit. Putting the
[1:46:03] gifts in order is for your benefit.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; He stood there. Come on, church. We
[1:46:09] might as well take the brakes off and
[1:46:10] preach. He stood there and preached
[1:46:12] predestination in the face of
[1:46:14] Pentecostal theologians that would kill
[1:46:16] him if they could. He stood there,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; well, I might as well say it. He stood
[1:46:22] there and declared serpent seed in the
[1:46:24] face of religious scientists that would
[1:46:26] have killed him if they could. But you
[1:46:28] know why they couldn't? Because it was a
[1:46:30] visitation. It was more than an AA
[1:46:33] Allen. It was more than an oral Roberts.
[1:46:36] It was more than a Billy Graham. It was
[1:46:38] more than a Jack Cole. It was God
[1:46:42] visiting this generation to claim some
[1:46:45] more.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. Brother Matt,
[1:46:49] can I just go ahead and shout a bit and
[1:46:51] preach? Amen. I tell you what, if you
[1:46:53] want to see Billy Graham's legacy, you
[1:46:55] drive over there to Asheville and
[1:46:56] Charlotte, North Carolina, and they got
[1:46:58] a beautiful library. If you want to see
[1:47:00] Oral Roberts legacy, you drive out to
[1:47:02] Tulsa and they got a beautiful couple
[1:47:04] hands out there praying.
[1:47:07] I remember I get in trouble. Sure as the
[1:47:09] world. I remember the first time I ever
[1:47:11] went there went to Martin took me. We
[1:47:13] stand there looking and them praying.
[1:47:15] Y'all ever seen them
[1:47:17] get in trouble and praying hands? They
[1:47:19] were they were like this. And I said,
[1:47:22] "Man, that's that's big." Bro looked
[1:47:25] over at me. He said, "You know why them
[1:47:26] hands are like that, don't you?" I said,
[1:47:28] "Why?" He said, "Well, when they built
[1:47:30] them, it was like this and somebody
[1:47:32] threw a dollar and they went like that.
[1:47:36] I said, 'Oh yeah, there it is. We think
[1:47:39] that's funny, but do you realize that
[1:47:40] was the truth?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Show me one place brother Brandham stood
[1:47:44] on a platform and said, "If you don't
[1:47:45] send me $8 million, God is going to take
[1:47:48] me off the scene. You'll never find it,
[1:47:50] folks." You know why? Because this
[1:47:52] wasn't a money chasing,
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; womanchasing, popularity hungry
[1:47:57] preacher. It was a seventh grade
[1:47:59] redeemed flesh that Jesus Christ, the
[1:48:02] son of God, got a hold of.
[1:48:06] He said, "You can take all the money.
[1:48:08] You can take all the popularity. I'll
[1:48:10] drink water and I'll eat soda crackers,
[1:48:13] but just give me a place to stand and to
[1:48:15] tell the world that Jesus Christ is the
[1:48:18] same yesterday, today, and forever." And
[1:48:22] I say to everyone today, you can go see
[1:48:24] Billy's legacy. You can go see Oral's
[1:48:27] legacy. But right here in a barn on a
[1:48:30] country road in the hills of Black
[1:48:32] Rockck, Arkansas, you can see the
[1:48:34] trophies. You can see the legacies. You
[1:48:37] can see the testimonies. You can see the
[1:48:40] memorials of the visitation of God
[1:48:43] fulfilling Malachi 4. Fulfilling
[1:48:45] Revelations 10.
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Devil, get out
[1:48:52] of my way. I'm not just a preacher. I'm
[1:48:54] a trophy.
[1:48:56] I'm not just a preacher. I'm a trophy of
[1:48:59] the visitation.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Josh, he loved us enough to come
[1:49:04] get us.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; He loved us enough to come get us.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; When some woman chasing
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; scandalous ministry,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; well, I'm sorry.
[1:49:26] filthiness.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And these counter down,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; backwash, dried up hier,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; sit on computer screens,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; and question the ministry like that.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Closets are full of skeletons.
[1:49:54] full of them.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And they questioned brother Brandham.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Satan trying to block the blessing.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; There's a visitation coming.
[1:50:12] Now
[1:50:18] the day you want to start question
[1:50:19] authority on things, let's question
[1:50:22] yours.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Fair enough.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; We're going to question Brother Bram's
[1:50:27] authority on teachings. Let's question.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; By what authority are you telling your
[1:50:32] children to disobey what a vindicated
[1:50:33] prophet?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. By what authority are you
[1:50:39] saying these things? because somewhere
[1:50:41] you're going to meet a devil.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; I remember a guy come to me one time. He
[1:50:45] said, "Praise God, I've been called to
[1:50:46] preach." I said, "Well, praise the
[1:50:47] Lord." He said, "Yeah." He said, "I was
[1:50:48] in a meeting and a brother looked at me
[1:50:50] and he called me out and he told me I
[1:50:51] was called to preach and I've been
[1:50:52] running from it." And I tell you right
[1:50:54] now, brother, that brother told me this
[1:50:56] and he told me that and if he tells you
[1:50:57] that, you better believe it. You're
[1:50:58] called to preach. Go, go, go. And I
[1:51:00] said, "Praise God." And I wanted to say,
[1:51:02] "Buddy, I hope you got more than brother
[1:51:04] so and so told you
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; because them demons you going to meet
[1:51:08] ain't going to care what brother so and
[1:51:10] so had to say.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; They ain't going to care."
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; See, there's got to be some authority
[1:51:16] behind this. Now, I'm turning a corner.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; So, here is Abraham and Sarah, and
[1:51:20] they're sitting in the tent, and the
[1:51:22] prophet of God said this. Now, you all
[1:51:23] heard it all weekend. He says, "Elohim
[1:51:26] came,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; the self-existing one." He said, "Now,
[1:51:29] Satan was trying to tempt them to feel
[1:51:33] that they had done wrong."
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Now, they hadn't done wrong,
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; but Satan was trying to tempt them
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; to feel
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; they had done wrong.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; It's like a man sitting at brother's
[1:51:49] meetings and he come to brother,
[1:51:50] brother, I'm sorry for those thoughts I
[1:51:51] had. He said, "Oh, don't worry about it.
[1:51:53] Those weren't your thoughts." He said,
[1:51:55] "The guy sitting in front of you was
[1:51:56] thanking them. They were passing by you,
[1:51:57] trying to on you.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; He was trying to block the oncoming
[1:52:03] visitation that was going to give to
[1:52:05] Abraham and Sarah. Now listen, right at
[1:52:07] the time of visitation, brother Joel, he
[1:52:10] makes them feel that they've done wrong,
[1:52:12] that they're not worthy of the
[1:52:14] visitation.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about. Amen.
[1:52:18] Come Wednesday night and come Sunday
[1:52:20] morning and come youth camp and come a
[1:52:22] good meeting and old devil crawls up on
[1:52:25] your back and says, "You ain't got a
[1:52:26] right to enjoy this. You ain't got a
[1:52:28] right to shout. You ain't got a right to
[1:52:30] rejoice."
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about. It's
[1:52:34] called a devil. That devil says, "You
[1:52:36] ain't got no right. I know what you
[1:52:38] done, and I know you did this, and I
[1:52:40] know you thought that, and I know you
[1:52:41] looked at this, and I know you drunk
[1:52:43] that. I know you I know what I'm talking
[1:52:45] about." Amen. But can I tell you what
[1:52:47] that's the time to do? That's the time
[1:52:49] to resist that devil
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; and say, "Devil, this is the hour of
[1:52:55] visitation.
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; And if I listen to you, I will remain
[1:53:00] under condemnation. But if I break
[1:53:03] beyond the voice of the tempter, I break
[1:53:06] beyond the voice of the negative devil
[1:53:08] and I begin to commune with Elohim, then
[1:53:12] I'm going to receive a breakthrough. I'm
[1:53:14] going to receive a redemption.
[1:53:18] Now, Satan was only tempting them. I'm
[1:53:20] good on my time. I got my time. We're
[1:53:21] going.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Satan was only tempting them because he
[1:53:25] did not want them to become
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; a trophy
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; of Elohim's visitation.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I love what a prophet says. He said,
[1:53:34] "You think that's a big thing for God?
[1:53:36] He made all the pot, the calcium, and
[1:53:38] everything in the world, and he come
[1:53:40] down to visit Abraham." Do you realize
[1:53:43] that the hour of visitation comes the
[1:53:45] hour of temptation?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says there's an hour
[1:53:48] of temptation and that word means the
[1:53:50] temptation by which the devil sought to
[1:53:53] divert Jesus the Messiah from his divine
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Aaron.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; So brother Carter when the Messiah left
[1:54:01] the temple down there they put him out
[1:54:03] and he went over there to the woman at
[1:54:05] the well and met her. Jesus was on a
[1:54:08] Messiah errand sir
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; and the devil was trying to divert him
[1:54:13] because he knew I've got that woman
[1:54:15] right where I want her
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; and if she gets in that
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Black Rock Arkansas tent me
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; and she starts hearing them songs
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; and she starts laying aside all the
[1:54:29] cares of life and and pillar of fire
[1:54:31] begins to come to pillar of fire and
[1:54:33] lick a fire I'm going to lose her
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:54:40] I'm going to lose her. See, I've had her
[1:54:42] bound and I've told her she can't shout,
[1:54:45] she can't dance, she can't rejoice, she
[1:54:47] can't freely believe the word of God.
[1:54:49] And if I can just get Jesus
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; distracted, I can keep her. But I want
[1:54:55] to stand here tonight and say, "Devil,
[1:54:57] you lost.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Devil, you lost." Well, glory to God.
[1:55:06] Devil, you lost. You know why I can say
[1:55:08] that? Because I look across this
[1:55:10] building this morning and I see visible
[1:55:13] manifestations of the revelation of the
[1:55:16] gentile message.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I can see the
[1:55:22] gentle.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Can I just say it?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; The Gentiles message started by a
[1:55:32] visitation.
[1:55:34] of the pillar of fire.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Now I'm here and I'm having fun.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And it ends the same way.
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; The way it started is the way it ends.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; So it didn't start hot and end cold.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; It didn't start fiery, brother Vernon,
[1:56:01] and end icy. But it started fiery.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And it's going to end as fiery as it
[1:56:08] started. You know how this church
[1:56:10] started? It started on the day of
[1:56:12] Pentecost with a bunch of sinners that
[1:56:15] had been saved by the grace of God,
[1:56:17] filled with the Holy Ghost, drunk on the
[1:56:20] anointing, shouting and dancing and
[1:56:23] praising God.
[1:56:25] Brother David, I saw you over there the
[1:56:27] other night. Amen. I saw you get free
[1:56:29] and just start dancing right there.
[1:56:31] Sister Destiny, I saw you. I saw the
[1:56:33] Holy Ghost get a hold of you and shout
[1:56:36] you around. I saw some of you all. I see
[1:56:38] you this morning.
[1:56:40] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:56:43] Christ. This is more than a revival.
[1:56:46] This is more than a meeting. This is
[1:56:48] more than a get together. This is a
[1:56:50] visitation of a fire of almighty God
[1:56:54] returning to the church.
[1:56:58] [Applause]
[1:57:01] Hallelujah. I've done seen the glory of
[1:57:03] the Lord.
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:13] [Applause]
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; They're going to call you Pentecostal.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; They already do. But I really don't care
[1:57:24] cuz I'm full of the Holy Ghost. I got my
[1:57:28] name on the book. I got my token over
[1:57:30] the door.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:57:36] talking about the pillar of fire.
[1:57:41] It's burning in my heart. It's burning
[1:57:43] in my feet. It's burning in my hands.
[1:57:46] It's burning in my mouth. It's got a
[1:57:48] hold of me. And it's burning me up.
[1:57:50] Brother Joe,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I've been touched by a message.
[1:58:01] Brother Andrew,
[1:58:03] I read about Bible days.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; And I read about God visiting
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Abraham and Sarah.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, how how I just want to step in the
[1:58:15] Bible and I want to walk those roads
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; back into that scene and I want to see
[1:58:21] what was there.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; I want to see what it looked like. I
[1:58:25] want to Feel the atmosphere of it.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Can you give me that first picture?
[1:58:36] [Applause]
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Bible days
[1:58:43] are here,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; brother Buster. Bible days, they're here
[1:58:49] again.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I wish I could go back. I
[1:58:54] don't have to go back.
[1:58:56] Well, glory to God. I don't have to go
[1:58:59] back because what was back there is
[1:59:02] right here.
[1:59:04] Glory to God. What was back there is
[1:59:06] right here.
[1:59:09] I know we ain't in the tent this
[1:59:11] morning, but I'm going to say it anyhow.
[1:59:13] What was in Abraham and Sarah's tent is
[1:59:15] in that picture. And that's what was in
[1:59:17] that tent down there.
[1:59:20] And that's what's in this building right
[1:59:22] here.
[1:59:23] P of fire has returned.
[1:59:27] He's visiting you.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; He's communing with you.
[1:59:36] He's revealing himself to you. He's
[1:59:39] claiming you.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire by night. Give me
[1:59:45] that right there. Thank you. Pillar of
[1:59:47] fire by night.
[1:59:49] Behold, I will send you
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stay with me
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; right there. Leave it that one.
[2:00:00] Brother Andrew, I wish I could be there.
[2:00:02] I wish I could have known what Daniel
[2:00:04] felt when he saw the ancient of days.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Kobe, I wish we could have been
[2:00:11] there. You know, I wish we could have
[2:00:13] felt the power of God as that cloud
[2:00:15] begin to hover over them tents and it
[2:00:17] begin to impregnate them hearts. Wish we
[2:00:19] could have been there and felt it. Oh, I
[2:00:21] wish we could have been there, brother.
[2:00:24] Brother Joe, I wish we could have been
[2:00:25] there. I wish we could have been there,
[2:00:27] buddy. I wish we could have been there
[2:00:29] when Brother Bram looked up and Angels
[2:00:31] was up there. I wish we could have been
[2:00:33] there. But since we weren't there,
[2:00:35] here's what we'll do. We'll just settle
[2:00:37] down and we'll just play tapes every now
[2:00:40] and again. And we'll just have, you
[2:00:42] know, we'll just barely get by. You
[2:00:43] know, we'll just wait on Brother Bram to
[2:00:45] come back and and then we'll really feel
[2:00:46] what
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Are you smoking something?
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; I don't have to go back to get it.
[2:00:55] It came and got me.
[2:00:59] It came and claimed me. I can tell you
[2:01:02] where I was. I can tell you where I was
[2:01:05] when the revelation in that picture
[2:01:06] claimed this old piece of Tennessee
[2:01:08] dirt. I was sitting in a Bible
[2:01:10] conference one night and brother Wayne
[2:01:11] was preaching on the power of that cloud
[2:01:14] and he began to say that come and got
[2:01:16] you and it's just a 16-year-old boy all
[2:01:18] kinds of scars and all kinds of
[2:01:20] confusions and preachers and do this and
[2:01:23] say that but I heard that cloud speak to
[2:01:26] me. They can laugh at me. They can make
[2:01:29] fun of me. They can be a bunch of
[2:01:31] cowards and sit behind screens and
[2:01:33] criticize me behind my back and make fun
[2:01:35] of me for preaching to these young
[2:01:37] people. But I want to tell them this
[2:01:39] morning, they will never shut me up
[2:01:41] because the same cloud that got me, I
[2:01:43] believe it come to get you, Sophie. I
[2:01:45] believe it come to claim you, Peter. It
[2:01:48] come to get you, John. It come to get
[2:01:50] you. Brother David Paul, it come and got
[2:01:53] you.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, you didn't go get this
[2:02:01] message. It come and got you.
[2:02:09] Joe, you didn't go find it. It come to
[2:02:12] Missouri and it found you and it found
[2:02:14] your mama and it found your daddy and it
[2:02:16] found your family
[2:02:20] because you are the memorial of its
[2:02:24] purpose.
[2:02:32] Anybody
[2:02:34] got a picture of it? It's called in a
[2:02:36] cloud 26 miles high in the shape of a
[2:02:40] pyramid. Seven angels represented in
[2:02:43] there brought back and brought you the
[2:02:46] word of God.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Under the inspiration,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; it tells you these hours that you're
[2:02:58] coming and living in.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; The spiritual mind will pick that right
[2:03:01] now.
[2:03:02] See, and get it.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; It's an exodus.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Elohim,
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; don't go get Abraham and Sarah.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz if they get in touch with you,
[2:03:17] they're going to leave that old
[2:03:19] condition.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen, Jesus. You don't have no
[2:03:26] need to go by Samaria
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; because if she gets a hold of you
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; and you get a hold of her
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and y'all begin to visit and commune,
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to lose a good a good home
[2:03:37] church.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Reb said everything the devil was in it
[2:03:40] was a good home church for him. I'm
[2:03:42] going to lose a good home church. So
[2:03:44] don't go get her.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Don't don't go get her.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more?
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He's hanging on the cross. a thief
[2:03:52] beside him never thought about Jesus his
[2:03:56] whole life. He had never thought about
[2:03:58] Jesus until his final moments. And in
[2:04:00] his final moments, he looks over and in
[2:04:03] his final breath of his and the Lord
[2:04:05] Jesus, he says, "Remember me?"
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Can I Can I show y'all
[2:04:11] something? Amen. Don't you let no devil
[2:04:14] put any pressure on you that you're
[2:04:15] unworthy and you're not good enough.
[2:04:17] Amen. I want to tell you, Amen. Don't
[2:04:18] you let no devil pile any pressure. I'm
[2:04:21] just preaching right now. Don't you let
[2:04:23] no religious spirit of a bunch of a
[2:04:25] bunch of backsliding religious people
[2:04:27] get all religious on you and try to
[2:04:29] siphle you and try to suppress you.
[2:04:32] Amen. If they want to shut you up, just
[2:04:33] look at him and say, "You're the ones
[2:04:35] that missed him in the temple."
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; He came to the temple and you missed
[2:04:42] him. Why are you trying to shut me up?
[2:04:46] Oh, brother Brian. He was in their
[2:04:48] temple and they kicked him out head
[2:04:50] first. Man, I'm sorry. I'm going long.
[2:04:53] Can I have some liberty here? He was in
[2:04:55] their temple and they kicked him out
[2:04:57] head first.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; But there's a man hanging there
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; and he looks over and he says, "When
[2:05:05] thou come into your kingdom, will you
[2:05:09] remember me?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; When you come into your kingdom, I'm not
[2:05:15] done yet. when you come into your
[2:05:16] kingdom, will you remember me? And you
[2:05:18] know what he said, brother Caleb? He
[2:05:20] looked over at him and in his final
[2:05:22] breath, he gathered the strength to say
[2:05:25] these words, "Today,
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; today you'll be with me
[2:05:32] in paradise.
[2:05:39] today. Not tomorrow, not next revival,
[2:05:43] not next meeting, not next convention,
[2:05:46] but today you will be with me in
[2:05:49] paradise.
[2:05:51] I don't care if you're on your final
[2:05:53] life, if you're on your final moments,
[2:05:55] if your name is in the Lamb's Book of
[2:05:58] Life, he'll tear down every devil to get
[2:06:00] to you
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; because he won't lose one.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; He won't lose one.
[2:06:08] [Applause]
[2:06:14] Well, Andrew, I wish I could have been
[2:06:16] there and heard what it was like when
[2:06:19] brother stood there and he began to
[2:06:21] preach. Can you give me that next
[2:06:22] picture?
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; I wasn't, brother Matt in the meeting.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. I wasn't sitting there.
[2:06:39] But what was there?
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; What was there is in here,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; brother Matt. I wasn't there.
[2:06:56] Lake Port, California, 1950s. We got one
[2:07:00] picture where he's just standing there
[2:07:01] preaching. Then we got this picture when
[2:07:04] they took another picture and the pillar
[2:07:06] of fire has covered him.
[2:07:10] I got to quit, brother Nathan.
[2:07:12] But I want to say it to you as plain as
[2:07:14] I know how. I wasn't there in a physical
[2:07:18] body, but I was a part of the
[2:07:21] visitation. And because he won't lose
[2:07:24] one,
[2:07:26] [Applause]
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; because he won't lose one. You say,
[2:07:30] "Preacher, it's a long ways down in my
[2:07:32] lineage. How could he ever get me?"
[2:07:34] Amen. Can I say this to you? Amen. I
[2:07:36] just want to say it because I know what
[2:07:38] devils do. Demons are real and spirits
[2:07:40] are real. And they'll pile up on you and
[2:07:43] they'll say things like, "Well, you was
[2:07:44] this and your grandfather was this and
[2:07:47] he was a he was a man of God and she was
[2:07:49] a daughter of God and all these things
[2:07:51] and you're nothing but an embarrassment
[2:07:53] and you're nothing but a you're nothing
[2:07:55] but a waste of time." Amen. But I want
[2:07:57] to give you the word of the Lord this
[2:07:58] morning. When that devil tells you that,
[2:08:00] I want you to look him in the eyes and
[2:08:02] say, "You're nothing but a liar."
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Look him in the eyes and say, "You're
[2:08:08] nothing but a liar."
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get to my point right now,
[2:08:16] brother. I'm going get to my point right
[2:08:18] now. Amen. I heard brother say it last
[2:08:20] night and I about shouted, "Come out of
[2:08:22] my living room." You know what he said?
[2:08:24] He said just a few days ago there in
[2:08:26] Arkansas and he stopped and he screamed
[2:08:30] out these words. He said, "God is
[2:08:32] visiting us.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Give me the pulpit at 2:00 in the
[2:08:40] morning.
[2:08:41] Give me the microphone at 3:00 in the
[2:08:44] morning. I got a message. I got a
[2:08:47] message. I got a message from the Lord.
[2:08:50] The pillar of fire.
[2:08:52] his visit to Arkansas.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all know why I was asking those
[2:08:59] questions last night. Amen. Can I tell
[2:09:01] y'all something? Amen. Amen. Everybody
[2:09:04] right now. Amen. If you 30 miles down
[2:09:07] the road from here in a town called
[2:09:09] Jonesboro, Arkansas, that man in that
[2:09:13] picture was led by that God
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; to Jonesboro, Arkansas. And he stood
[2:09:20] down there and for eight days he prayed
[2:09:23] for the sick. He prayed for the dumb. He
[2:09:25] prayed for the blind. He prayed over and
[2:09:27] over. Amen. I want to ask you this. Have
[2:09:30] I got any descendants or anybody in this
[2:09:32] building that was in those meetings?
[2:09:34] Brother Vernon.
[2:09:37] Mom and dad was there. Okay. They were
[2:09:40] there. They were in those meetings. Your
[2:09:43] mom and dad, Brother Vernon, Brother
[2:09:44] David, will you stand up for me? I want
[2:09:45] y'all to look back at these men.
[2:09:48] They were there in those meetings.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Now, were you all in those meetings?
[2:09:56] Were you there, Brother David? They
[2:09:58] weren't there.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; But they're here.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Because before the foundation of the
[2:10:08] world, God put some names on the Lamb's
[2:10:12] book of life that would be saved in this
[2:10:15] hour of visitation. and he led that man
[2:10:18] to Jonesboro, Arkansas, and something
[2:10:20] sparked their mom and daddy's heart and
[2:10:22] said, "Let's go down there and see what
[2:10:24] it's about." And today, we got two
[2:10:27] trophies sitting in this room today.
[2:10:32] Not church members, Holy Ghost filled,
[2:10:34] clean living pillars of God in the
[2:10:37] church of God. I say this is more than a
[2:10:40] man. This is more than a message. It's a
[2:10:43] special visitation of Almighty God.
[2:10:46] [Applause]
[2:10:50] Amen. Can I say it? I texted Brother
[2:10:52] David this morning real. He's still on
[2:10:54] the road. I said, "Was your grandpa in
[2:10:56] any of Brother's meetings in Jonesburg?"
[2:10:58] He said, "No." He said, "He wasn't in
[2:11:01] the meetings in Jonesburg, but he was in
[2:11:03] the series in Jeffersonville
[2:11:05] when he sat there and you know what? I
[2:11:07] just caught something." I asked brother
[2:11:08] David. Okay. I just caught something. He
[2:11:11] said he was sitting there.
[2:11:13] Now, I'm gonna show y'all something.
[2:11:16] Okay, I know you think I'm crazy, but
[2:11:18] I'm having fun.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Their mom and daddy come in in the first
[2:11:22] pull,
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; but it was the same message.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Are y'all hearing me?
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show y'all something.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; This ain't a weak message.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; It's a powerful message.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Brother David said, "Yeah, he sat
[2:11:39] there." I said, and brother David said
[2:11:41] this. He said he sat behind him on the
[2:11:43] platform when he preached, "Who is this
[2:11:45] Melzdc?" I said, "Dear God, that's the
[2:11:48] sermon." He turns and says, "Oh, now
[2:11:51] predestination
[2:11:52] is in plain view."
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Folks, y'all call me crazy if you want
[2:11:57] to. I'm closing right here. But do you
[2:11:59] realize that there was a trophy of God
[2:12:02] that sat behind a prophet of God and
[2:12:04] believed what a prophet was saying about
[2:12:06] who Melzdc was? And that message claimed
[2:12:09] that man. And through that lineage, you
[2:12:11] had a trophy of the grace of God stand
[2:12:14] behind this pull pit last night.
[2:12:21] Somebody say, "Well, I don't think he's
[2:12:22] big enough." Are you crazy? I'm talking
[2:12:25] about God. I'm talking about Elohim.
[2:12:30] He didn't lose a one. And I want to tell
[2:12:32] you this in closing. He ain't going to
[2:12:34] lose a one of you.
[2:12:38] If he didn't lose Abraham and he didn't
[2:12:41] lose Sarah and he didn't lose Barnameus,
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; he won't lose a one of you.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Preacher, you lost your
[2:12:49] mind." I haven't lost my mind. Amen. I
[2:12:51] want to challenge every devil right now.
[2:12:54] I want to challenge every unbelieving
[2:12:55] spirit right now. And I want to close by
[2:12:58] saying this. In 1946,
[2:13:01] that man in that picture possessed
[2:13:05] embodying that God come to Little Rock,
[2:13:07] Arkansas.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; And he walked into a deaf and dumb
[2:13:12] school.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Oh god, I'm having fun now. He walked
[2:13:17] into a deaf and dumb school. No offense,
[2:13:20] but they were training them to stay and
[2:13:23] put up with their condition.
[2:13:27] God, I feel like shouting.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; They were in a deaf and dumb school.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; There was no hope for them outside of
[2:13:33] this school.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to teach you how to be
[2:13:37] deaf and we're going to teach you how to
[2:13:40] not speak because that's what we're here
[2:13:42] for. But God
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; I said God who is rich in mercy sent
[2:13:49] that little six-foot man walking in a
[2:13:52] deaf and dumb school possessed with a
[2:13:55] pillar of fire and 142 death.
[2:14:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:04] 142 deaf and dumb children got up out of
[2:14:07] the beds, got up out the tables, and
[2:14:10] they walked out of there completely.
[2:14:12] Well,
[2:14:14] can I tell you what happened? God
[2:14:17] cancelled the devil's plans. God by
[2:14:20] visitation, he cancelled the devil's
[2:14:23] plans.
[2:14:25] Well, I want to say it as plain as I
[2:14:26] know how. That same God inside of a
[2:14:29] five-fold ministry preaching that same
[2:14:32] message walked into this meeting this
[2:14:34] weekend and 150 and 200 and 300 lives
[2:14:38] were changed by the visitation.
[2:14:44] It's real.
[2:14:47] Stand on your feet and give God praise.
[2:14:50] It's real.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Elohim
[2:14:59] has visited.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Elohim
[2:15:07] has visited
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Arkansas
[2:15:13] again,
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; folks. It's more real than the breath
[2:15:19] I'm breathing right now.
[2:15:28] God have mercy.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm about to fall apart up
[2:15:36] here.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; It's more than a church to me.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's more than a sermon. It's more than
[2:15:43] a meeting. It's a reality.
[2:15:48] Elohim is in this building. The pillar
[2:15:51] of fire is whirling through this
[2:15:53] building. And he's here. He's here to
[2:15:56] heal you. He's here to save you. He's
[2:15:58] here to deliver you.
[2:16:00] [Applause]
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; It's a visitation.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; I couldn't get to him, brother David,
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; so he came to me.
[2:16:23] He came and got me.
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; He came and got me, brother.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; He came and found me and he be to
[2:16:42] commune with me.
[2:16:46] wondering ended.
[2:16:49] You remember that day, sister,
[2:16:52] when your wondering just ended?
[2:16:57] Remember that day? How many remembers
[2:16:59] that day?
[2:17:02] When your wondering just ended and you
[2:17:05] said, "I know.
[2:17:09] I know.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I've had a visit with you.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; We've communed.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; We've talked. be fellowshipped. I know
[2:17:20] brother said it beautifully. He said,
[2:17:21] "The days the voice of the seventh
[2:17:23] angel, but he shall begin to sound." He
[2:17:26] said, "Now there's a lot of symbols and
[2:17:27] questions." He said, "But now let's
[2:17:28] turn." And he said, "Hear this. You
[2:17:30] won't have to wonder no more."
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Don't feel good this morning
[2:17:37] to know that the favor of God is upon
[2:17:39] your life.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "You preach that message
[2:17:43] of awful and strong. It's all I got.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; It's all I got.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; I've been inoculated.
[2:17:57] [Applause]
[2:18:00] Before a just God can pour out his
[2:18:02] judgment upon a people, he has to make a
[2:18:04] way of escape for everyone who desires
[2:18:06] to receive it. This is your day of
[2:18:09] visitation.
[2:18:11] You might not want to believe it because
[2:18:13] an uneducated minister said it,
[2:18:17] but don't pay no attention to the
[2:18:18] messenger.
[2:18:20] Pay attention to the message you're
[2:18:22] hearing.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Oh word believers, give into my message.
[2:18:28] Hear me. Not my message, but his message
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; that he firmly declares to be the truth.
[2:18:39] Can I say it to you this morning?
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; We were talking there last night and
[2:18:48] brother David was sharing with me once
[2:18:51] that was in the meetings and missed it.
[2:18:53] Brother Seth also was sharing some
[2:18:55] things. He said there was a Pentecostal
[2:18:57] preacher. He said he was sitting down
[2:18:58] there in those Jones Bur meetings and he
[2:19:00] saw Brother Ram's gift and he saw that
[2:19:02] and he said, "Oh, he's a healer." Said
[2:19:03] he's a prophet. but said, "Today he's
[2:19:06] sitting in the Pentecostal church
[2:19:08] because they couldn't go all the way in
[2:19:09] and become a rainbow trout."
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; But unto you that had ears to hear,
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; it was more than a sign in the hand.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; It was more than a discernment.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; It was Elohim coming to your heart, to
[2:19:26] your tent, and sit down with you
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; and breaking bread.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Folks were going home.
[2:19:36] We're going home.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; This is an Exodus.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what's going to happen?
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; One of these mornings between 6 and 9,
[2:19:47] God's going to send a rapture
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; and he's going to gather. He's going to
[2:19:52] gather all of his trophies.
[2:19:56] Going to take them home.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I give you the best part?
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:03] going to sit you right there in his
[2:20:06] showroom.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; He's going to take you to the marriage
[2:20:11] supper, the lamb or can I say the
[2:20:14] trophy, the trophy dinner,
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; and you're going to sit at a table, 1500
[2:20:20] miles long.
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; You going to sit there. You got a seat
[2:20:26] right now.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, Brother Brian, he's
[2:20:30] going to step in the room.
[2:20:32] And he's going to have angels with him.
[2:20:35] He going to start walking down through
[2:20:36] there and he's going to say, "Y'all
[2:20:38] remember when you said I was a healer
[2:20:40] and I told you it was good, but it
[2:20:42] didn't do what it done for for me. Can I
[2:20:45] show you why? Because here's one of my
[2:20:47] sick children.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Here's my trophies,
[2:20:52] folks. It's real this morning.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; It's more real than the air you're
[2:20:56] breathing.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; I wish I had words this morning. I've
[2:21:01] got I've got tons of them here. I'm out
[2:21:03] of time. I got tons of them here.
[2:21:05] Visitation after visitation after
[2:21:09] visitation
[2:21:11] and trophy after trophy after trophy. I
[2:21:15] wonder this morning how many raise your
[2:21:16] hands and say, "Lord, thank you for
[2:21:18] coming and getting me.
[2:21:21] I'm sorry. I'm I'm called up. Thank you
[2:21:24] for coming and getting me. I was in that
[2:21:27] school down there. I was in a spiritual
[2:21:30] school and they were teaching me how to
[2:21:32] live depressed and they were teaching me
[2:21:34] how to live defeated. But Lord, you come
[2:21:36] and got me
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; and that voice
[2:21:40] anointed by that pillar of fire healed
[2:21:42] me and led me out and now I'm healed. I
[2:21:48] want to have me just close your eyes
[2:21:49] this morning to raise your hands and
[2:21:51] say, "Lord, thank you for your
[2:21:52] visitation.
[2:21:55] Thank you for your visitation.
[2:21:57] Thank you for coming by my way.
[2:22:00] Some of you all are sitting right here
[2:22:01] in this building this morning, direct
[2:22:04] descendants
[2:22:05] of loved ones and family members that
[2:22:07] sat in brother Bam's meetings. You're
[2:22:09] sitting here today
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; believing this message.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; It's not apostolic succession. It's
[2:22:16] called predestination.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; It's called God watching over his seed.
[2:22:21] God keeping his schedule. God visiting
[2:22:24] his people. preserving your spirit.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wanted this morning there being by
[2:22:29] here say, "Lord, don't let me ever take
[2:22:31] this visitation for granted."
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let it become common.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:41] Hallelujah.
[2:22:43] Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your
[2:22:44] presence this morning.
[2:22:47] Father, you're in this building in power
[2:22:48] and demonstration this morning. Lord, as
[2:22:51] I as I begin to come into these areas
[2:22:54] and looking at them, Lord, it just begin
[2:22:56] to bubble up in my heart, Lord, we got
[2:22:59] believers sitting here today, direct
[2:23:01] manifestations
[2:23:03] of the visitations of Almighty God.
[2:23:06] Father, you visited this generation and
[2:23:09] we want to say thank you, Lord. This
[2:23:11] message claimed this. Father, from
[2:23:14] before the foundation of the world, you
[2:23:16] placed a seed in our soul to believe
[2:23:18] these things. Now Lord, I want to say
[2:23:20] thank you that when when the rabbis and
[2:23:22] the lawyers and the scribes and
[2:23:24] Pharisees when they rejected you, you
[2:23:27] came to me. You went to the woman at the
[2:23:29] well. You met the thief on the cross.
[2:23:32] You melt the woman and committed in the
[2:23:35] very act of adultery. You found her,
[2:23:36] Lord, when they brought her to you. Oh
[2:23:39] God, you found young people here this
[2:23:41] morning. Now, Father, may they take
[2:23:43] these things, Lord, and may they feed
[2:23:45] upon them.
[2:23:47] Lord, may they see that this is not a
[2:23:49] cult or it's not the fallen of a man.
[2:23:52] It's the divine provision of God
[2:23:54] gathering his trophies
[2:23:57] for the marriage supper of the lamb.
[2:24:00] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:24:02] Brother Ben, would you come sing that he
[2:24:04] came looking for me? How many can
[2:24:06] testify that tonight?
[2:24:10] Can I tell you one more?
[2:24:14] He said, "Brother Andrew, God don't know
[2:24:16] how to get a hold of my kids.
[2:24:19] God don't know how to get a hold of
[2:24:20] them. They're too far gone. They're in
[2:24:22] this situation. They're in this problem.
[2:24:24] Do you know there was a man told me, he
[2:24:26] said, "Brother Andrew,"
[2:24:29] he said, "I was in a in a Methodist
[2:24:30] church." And he said, "My parents went
[2:24:33] to brother Brandham." And they said,
[2:24:33] "Brother Brandham, our sons in the
[2:24:35] Methodist church said he's bound by
[2:24:37] their doctrine. Said he won't come out
[2:24:39] of it. Said he won't listen to us. said,
[2:24:41] "He's against you, against this message,
[2:24:43] against this truth." Said, "What should
[2:24:45] we do?" Brother Brandham said, "Don't
[2:24:46] worry." He said, "Just go on and be
[2:24:49] happy." You know what the brother told
[2:24:51] me? He said, "The Lord," the Lord spoke
[2:24:53] through Brother Brandham and said, "You
[2:24:55] all go." And said, "You go in that
[2:24:57] church and you go with him to that
[2:24:59] church." They said, "Go with him that
[2:25:01] church." He said, "Yeah, go with him
[2:25:03] that church." And he said, "In a few
[2:25:04] days, you'll be sitting there." And he
[2:25:06] said, "You'll see this light come in the
[2:25:08] room." He said, "You'll be the only one
[2:25:10] see it. you'll see this light. Said
[2:25:11] it'll come in the room and said it'll go
[2:25:13] right down to where he's at and it'll
[2:25:15] hang over him and you'll see it. Nobody
[2:25:17] else will see it. You'll see it. Said
[2:25:19] it'll hang over him and said in just a
[2:25:21] few minutes he'll feel a funny feeling
[2:25:23] and it'll leave. He said and the next
[2:25:25] time you talk to him he'll tell you he
[2:25:27] can't stay there no more.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; I said
[2:25:33] I said you really did that really
[2:25:36] happen? He said I'm the man.
[2:25:40] I said, "Really?" He said, "I'm the
[2:25:42] man." He said, "Mom and daddy was
[2:25:43] sitting there and one Sunday they was
[2:25:45] preaching, I was up on the second row
[2:25:47] and they saw that light come in there,
[2:25:49] said it hung over me and said, "I walked
[2:25:52] out there and said, "I can't go back."
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[2:25:58] Are y'all hearing me this morning? I've
[2:26:00] already said it, but I want to say it
[2:26:02] again. That pillar of fire is right here
[2:26:05] in this building this morning. Young
[2:26:07] man, the devil's cancelled. God is
[2:26:10] canceling the devil's plans. Young lady,
[2:26:13] God is cancelling the devil's plans. He
[2:26:16] come looking for you this weekend.
[2:26:18] Hallelujah. God bless you this morning.
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; I would suffer defeat as the blackness
[2:26:33] of nights
[2:26:35] on the line. My heart sings with fear
[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:26:42] and my desperate cry. It rang out with
[2:26:45] cry. Oh, all I could see was hope inside
[2:26:51] with falling gone. Yes, I let the world
[2:26:56] came looking for me.
[2:27:00] Oh, he came looking for me.
[2:27:05] He came looking for me.
[2:27:11] He made a way when there was no way that
[2:27:16] I could see.
[2:27:20] Oh, I drifted so far. But Jesus was
[2:27:24] near. He rescued my soul and he calmed
[2:27:28] all my fears. Now I'm safe from all
[2:27:31] harm. I'm in the Lord. came looking for
[2:27:35] me.
[2:27:39] Satan had already picked out my grave.
[2:27:43] His plan was to fall and put me away. I
[2:27:48] drifted so far. But if you don't care
[2:27:53] that I soon be lost,
[2:27:57] well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[2:28:00] of time. Oh, but Jesus appeared and
[2:28:04] said, "This son is high now safe from
[2:28:08] all harm." For he walked through the
[2:28:10] storm. He came looking for me.
[2:28:15] Oh yes, he came looking for me.
[2:28:20] He looking for me.
[2:28:25] Well, we made a way, but there was no
[2:28:29] way all that I could see.
[2:28:34] I drifted so far. But Jesus was near to
[2:28:39] rescue my soul and all my fears. Now I'm
[2:28:44] saved from my heart cuz I had no came
[2:28:48] here. Oh, I got to sing that second
[2:28:51] verse again. You see, Satan had already
[2:28:55] picked out my grave. His plan was to
[2:28:58] fool and put me away. I drifted so far,
[2:29:04] but it even feared that I soon lost.
[2:29:10] Well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[2:29:14] of time. Oh, but Jesus appeared. Said,
[2:29:18] "This child is mine. Now sing from afar.
[2:29:22] Oh cuz I'm in the war who came looking.
[2:29:26] I sing it to him this morning. He came
[2:29:29] looking
[2:29:31] for me. He came looking for me.
[2:29:38] Yes. He made a way. There was a way that
[2:29:43] I could see.

[2:29:59] [Music]
[2:30:01] looking safe and already
[2:30:05] Satan had already picked up
[2:30:09] his plan was to fall and put me away. I
[2:30:14] drifted so far and he knew that I should
[2:30:19] be it all.
[2:30:22] When I knew my destruction was a matter
[2:30:26] of time Jesus appeared and said this
[2:30:30] child is mine now
[2:30:33] this morning I met the one who came
[2:30:37] looking for me.
[2:30:40] Yes, he came looking for me.
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:30:45] He came looking for me.
[2:30:50] He made a way. There was no way that I
[2:30:55] could see.
[2:30:59] I drifted so far.
[2:31:06] Oh my
[2:31:11] god.
[2:31:18] [Music]
[2:31:21] He came looking for me.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Not only did he come looking for you,
[2:31:31] but how many say he found you?
[2:31:34] I remember where I was, brother David
[2:31:37] Paul the day he found me.
[2:31:40] I ran from church, ran from serving God.
[2:31:44] What that brother was preaching was the
[2:31:46] absolute truth. And I know we had some
[2:31:48] visitors, there may some things that he
[2:31:49] said you might not understand, but if
[2:31:52] you go back in your Bible and you'll
[2:31:53] pick up the children of Israel coming
[2:31:55] out of Egypt, you'll see the Bible says
[2:31:58] there was a pillar of fire that led them
[2:31:59] out of there. And then when they got
[2:32:02] down in trouble, notice what that same
[2:32:03] pillar of fire done. It went right over
[2:32:05] behind them and it protect them from
[2:32:07] their enemy. So that same pillar of fire
[2:32:10] is still here today.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; So that's that's that's what we're
[2:32:13] preaching about. That pillar of fire
[2:32:15] that was present in the days of Jesus,
[2:32:17] that was present in the days of Israel.
[2:32:19] That same light that met Paul on the
[2:32:21] road to Damascus is the same pillar of
[2:32:23] fire that was in the ministry of William
[2:32:25] Brandham is the same pillar of fire
[2:32:27] that's here today.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every God called son and daughter
[2:32:32] of God since the days of Israel have
[2:32:35] followed that same voice. You realize
[2:32:38] that we've all from the days of Israel,
[2:32:40] we followed that same pillar of fire. I
[2:32:42] got news for you. We're the people today
[2:32:44] are following it. Amen. It's gone before
[2:32:47] me. It stands behind me. It defends me
[2:32:50] from my enemy. And the only place that
[2:32:52] the armor of God says there ain't no
[2:32:54] armor, but there's a pillar of fire back
[2:32:56] there that takes care of all my past and
[2:32:58] all the things that's pursuing me, he
[2:33:00] said, you just march onward. Take the
[2:33:02] sword and this faith that God has given
[2:33:04] us and you just march forward and let
[2:33:06] the pillar of fire do his job. We have a
[2:33:09] pillar of fire this hour. God has given
[2:33:12] it to us as a church. It'll lead us into
[2:33:14] our victory.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I thank God. That makes me want
[2:33:17] to shout this morning.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; We got a pillar of fire. Do you believe
[2:33:20] it? Amen. That makes that gives us a
[2:33:22] praise in our heart. It gives us a
[2:33:24] worship in our heart. What are these
[2:33:26] people so excited about? Well, if you
[2:33:27] want to know why they're acting like
[2:33:29] this, then go back in your Bible and
[2:33:31] read what it was like that day when they
[2:33:33] went across that Red Sea and their enemy
[2:33:35] was drowned in the sea and the Bible
[2:33:37] said Mariam picked up a tambourine and
[2:33:39] went dancing down the bank of the river
[2:33:41] because the pillar of fire had delivered
[2:33:43] them. It ain't something foreign. It
[2:33:46] ain't something new. I'm talking about
[2:33:48] the same pillar of fire. What are they
[2:33:51] washing? It's the pillar of fire. It's
[2:33:53] the angel of the Lord that is present
[2:33:55] among this church today. And I got news
[2:33:57] for you. There ain't no Miam, God bless
[2:34:00] her, going to take my place.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shout right with her all
[2:34:04] the way down the bank. You say, "Well, I
[2:34:05] tell you what. If I'd have been there
[2:34:06] that day, I'd have been down the river
[2:34:08] with him. I'd have been shouting." Well,
[2:34:10] let me ask you. If I'd have been there
[2:34:11] that day, I'd have been out there with
[2:34:13] Jesus in the wilderness. If I'd been
[2:34:15] there that day, I'd have been down on
[2:34:16] the river being at John the Baptist
[2:34:18] baptism. Well, let me let me just tell
[2:34:20] you how you are today is how you'd have
[2:34:22] been then
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; because it's the same pillar of fire.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; So, you can't be one thing today and
[2:34:28] say, "But if I was living in history,
[2:34:29] I'd have been a real pillar of fire
[2:34:31] following believer." No, if you ain't
[2:34:33] following it today, you wouldn't have
[2:34:34] followed it then because it ain't in you
[2:34:36] to follow. But if you are following it
[2:34:38] today, you would have followed it then
[2:34:40] because it's in you to follow.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; And I got news for you. There ain't
[2:34:43] nobody going to take my place.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; There ain't no other There ain't no
[2:34:46] other worshiper. There ain't no rock.
[2:34:48] There ain't no tree. There ain't no
[2:34:50] There ain't nothing going to take my
[2:34:51] place. God put a worship in my heart to
[2:34:54] worship the pillar of fire. I got a
[2:34:55] right to.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the angel of the Lord. Well,
[2:35:00] there ain't no rock
[2:35:02] going to cry in my praise.
[2:35:06] Long as I'm alive to testify, I'll

[2:38:52] Well, God's children, they were stranded
[2:38:55] down at the Red Sea. Satan, he came by.
[2:39:00] He said, "You're going to fear me." But
[2:39:03] then out on the water, Moses lifted his
[2:39:06] hand. God's children then marched over
[2:39:10] on the way to the promised land. I said,
[2:39:13] "God's going to get my praise.

[2:40:30] Devil get out of my way. God's going to

[2:40:36] were bound up in 2025,
[2:40:39] but they came down to a meeting where
[2:40:42] the word of God was alive. They got free
[2:40:46] in the spirit. They started dancing
[2:40:48] across the floor. Then they turned to
[2:40:51] that old devil and said, "You won't hold
[2:40:53] me anymore cuz I know God's going to get
[2:40:56] my praise." Yes, God's going to get my
[2:40:59] praise. Devil, get out of my way. God's

[2:41:26] tree

[2:41:38] in my
[2:41:41] life for I praise his name
[2:41:45] where there ain't no tree going to wave
[2:41:48] in my place.
[2:41:50] Long as I'm alive to testify, I'll

[2:42:17] get my praise.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; I said, my God's going to get my praise.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, devil, get out of my way.
[2:42:24] God's going to give the praise.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; How many say, "Praise the Lord." Say,
[2:42:34] "God is good. He's been good to me and
[2:42:36] his mercy endureth forever. For when I
[2:42:40] was lost, he came and found me. You
[2:42:42] couldn't go far enough that God couldn't
[2:42:44] find you cuz you belong to God."
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:50] He came all the way to Arizona
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; and found me.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; I was driving down the road running from
[2:42:58] the Lord
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; for many years. Held bitterness in my
[2:43:01] heart. Didn't want to have nothing to do
[2:43:03] with God.
[2:43:05] Despised any man that would speak to me
[2:43:07] about it. I had been hurt. I had been
[2:43:11] lied to. I'd been destroyed.
[2:43:15] whole confidence in the gospel had been
[2:43:18] destroyed.
[2:43:21] I was out there one day
[2:43:24] with a brother I didn't really know and
[2:43:26] he didn't know me. He didn't know my
[2:43:28] life.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, can I just tell you an honest
[2:43:31] testimony real quick?
[2:43:33] He started this. We we were visiting and
[2:43:35] after a little bit he started telling me
[2:43:37] a testimony about him witnessing to a
[2:43:40] lady and that people had condemned him
[2:43:42] for it because it was a woman. Said she
[2:43:45] was down by the road and he said I
[2:43:47] started witnessing to her and said
[2:43:48] people kind of picked on me about it. He
[2:43:50] said but I I brought her to the church.
[2:43:53] Said then she gave her heart to the
[2:43:55] Lord. 25 years later she's still a piano
[2:43:58] player in the church married and got
[2:44:00] kids.
[2:44:02] He said, "Well, he started telling me
[2:44:03] that and I said, "Well, that's good.
[2:44:04] Good for you, but I ain't got no time
[2:44:06] for it." I started to walk out of the
[2:44:08] house, was leaving. I was out in Arizona
[2:44:11] and I w got to the door and started to
[2:44:13] walk out and he said, "Matt, can I tell
[2:44:15] you something? You won't be offended at
[2:44:16] me." I said, "Yeah, I guess, but he
[2:44:20] said, "You know that bitterness you
[2:44:22] hold?" And he named the person that was
[2:44:24] against.
[2:44:26] He said, "God God will take that from
[2:44:28] you."
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; I said, "You don't know nothing about my
[2:44:30] life. you don't know nothing about my
[2:44:32] family. He said, I know about that
[2:44:34] spirit. He said, because I held that
[2:44:36] spirit against my dad.
[2:44:40] He said, I know if you'll let go of it,
[2:44:41] God can use you.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; I said, well, thank you. And I turned
[2:44:46] around, I left his house. I got down
[2:44:48] there in Phoenix, had a rental car. I
[2:44:50] was driving up to Baghdad. I got out in
[2:44:52] the middle of the desert out there in
[2:44:53] the middle of the driving upund
[2:44:56] something degrees, and the rental car
[2:44:58] broke down on the side of the road.
[2:45:01] And I pulled over and I took my phone. I
[2:45:03] tried to call the help line and my phone
[2:45:05] had no signal. The car wouldn't start.
[2:45:08] Nothing, nothing moving. I'm looking
[2:45:09] around. There ain't no cars coming to
[2:45:11] help.
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; And I sat there for a minute and I got
[2:45:14] to think about what that man said.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord came down in
[2:45:19] that car where I was at
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; and out there by myself. But I wasn't
[2:45:23] alone.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; And I gave my heart to the Lord sitting
[2:45:26] in that car. Said, "Lord, I've read from
[2:45:29] you. I've I I've held things that
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; and I pray you forgive me right now and
[2:45:35] you know I had a had a time with the
[2:45:37] Lord just worshiping the Lord. It was
[2:45:40] all and then I then I got to think about
[2:45:42] people all the people that I hadn't
[2:45:44] talked to and people I had avoided and
[2:45:46] people tried to to help me and I
[2:45:48] wouldn't have nothing to do with them
[2:45:49] and I picked up my phone that didn't
[2:45:51] work and started calling them and
[2:45:53] telling them I just gave my heart to the
[2:45:54] Lord. I just want you to be the first
[2:45:56] one to know the Lord came and visited me
[2:45:58] when I was over on the side of the road.
[2:46:00] One after another after another.
[2:46:04] Then I started the car and I drove up to
[2:46:06] Baghdad. To this day, this is a God's
[2:46:09] honest my hand to God that really
[2:46:10] happened. To this day, I don't know what
[2:46:12] was wrong with that car. I don't know
[2:46:14] why it didn't work. I don't know if it
[2:46:15] overheated or whatever happened to it.
[2:46:17] But I know one thing. God came and
[2:46:20] visited me. Amen.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; And every one of us have a testimony
[2:46:24] like that.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; It may have been on the side of the
[2:46:27] road. It may have been out in a deer
[2:46:28] stand.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; It may have been on an altar at a
[2:46:31] church.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; It may have been out in a tent meeting.
[2:46:34] May have been in your mom's house in the
[2:46:36] living room or sitting there listening
[2:46:37] to your grandma, your grandpa. Every one
[2:46:39] of us have a testimony like that.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have that testimony
[2:46:43] yet, then today can be your day.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; This can be your day.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; I needed the Lord in my life.
[2:46:52] One time he called me.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Two times he called me. He sent somebody
[2:46:57] by to say something to me, to encourage
[2:47:00] me. And it caused me to have a yearning
[2:47:02] in my heart to come back to God. But
[2:47:05] then I have my day of visitation.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe you just bow your heads this
[2:47:10] morning as we're ending this meeting.
[2:47:14] I'm going to ask you, maybe there'll be
[2:47:16] somebody I can't think to end a meeting
[2:47:19] without give you an opportunity. Say,
[2:47:22] "Brother Matt, I need that kind of
[2:47:24] visitation."
[2:47:26] Maybe there's somebody that the Lord has
[2:47:27] called you. God bless you, brother.
[2:47:29] Young man, God bless you. Young man, God
[2:47:31] bless you, young lady. Lord bless you.
[2:47:35] That God pulled at your heart and
[2:47:36] brought you to this place. Not to follow
[2:47:39] after a man or something, but God to
[2:47:43] follow after the very creator of heaven
[2:47:46] and earth that has called you to give
[2:47:49] your life to him. You realize there's
[2:47:50] nothing greater than serving God. Maybe
[2:47:53] you say, "This is a moment. Maybe this
[2:47:55] would be my opportunity." Won't you just
[2:47:57] raise your hand and say, "Lord, let me
[2:47:59] give my life to you Aresh. Lord, I I
[2:48:02] don't know where I may have fought it.
[2:48:04] God bless you, brother. God bless you,
[2:48:05] sister. I may have fought it so many
[2:48:07] years. God bless you, young lady. Many
[2:48:10] years I've ran from you. I've been hurt
[2:48:12] by people and I've lost confidence in
[2:48:15] the gospel and lost confidence in
[2:48:16] serving God. But there's something
[2:48:18] that's pulling at my heart and I just
[2:48:20] want to give my heart to God. Hands all
[2:48:22] over the building. Lord, let me serve
[2:48:24] you a new.
[2:48:26] Maybe if you've never made that
[2:48:27] commitment, if you'd like to come up,
[2:48:29] we'll have prayer with you. You're
[2:48:30] welcome to come.
[2:48:32] It's okay. If you if you don't if you
[2:48:34] don't come up, you want to stay in your
[2:48:35] seat, that's fine. This young lady up
[2:48:37] here with her hand raised, I know God
[2:48:39] knows what we need. You maybe just need
[2:48:41] a refreshing. God bless you. Y'all go
[2:48:43] ahead and come. Amen. Don't you worry.
[2:48:47] That's where that little woman did at
[2:48:48] the well. She came and met Jesus there.
[2:48:52] She just wanted to be in the presence of
[2:48:53] God.
[2:48:55] Amen.
[2:48:57] Amen. God bless you. Come on, brother.
[2:48:59] Lord, let me rededicate my life to you.
[2:49:01] Let this be a moment at the end of this
[2:49:03] meeting, Lord. God, let me rededicate my
[2:49:06] life to you, Lord. Let the spirit of God
[2:49:09] be renewed in my heart, Lord. God, I
[2:49:11] need a refresher for the presence of the
[2:49:14] Lord.
[2:49:16] I've shouted. I got free. I've I've done
[2:49:19] all the I had such a liberty in the
[2:49:21] meeting, but Lord, I really just need to
[2:49:23] refresh you.
[2:49:26] I need the move of God in my life. I
[2:49:28] need the spirit of God again
[2:49:30] to renew me.
[2:49:32] Amen.
[2:49:34] Come on.
[2:49:36] Take an opportunity to rededicate your
[2:49:39] life to the Lord.
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:44] Amen. Jesus said, "They aren't ashamed
[2:49:47] of me here. I won't be ashamed of them
[2:49:49] there. I'm not ashamed of you, Lord. I'm
[2:49:52] not ashamed to to take a stand for the
[2:49:54] gospel. I'm not a ashamed to be believer
[2:49:57] and confess my wrongs before God."
[2:50:02] Amen.
[2:50:05] [Music]
[2:50:07] Gracious heavenly father.
[2:50:11] Lord, hear these precious hearts, Lord,
[2:50:16] God, that have come to you, Lord, this
[2:50:18] morning.
[2:50:21] Lord,
[2:50:23] just to be able to dedicate our lives,
[2:50:25] Lord, aresh, Lord, God, knowing how that
[2:50:29] this is such a tremendous age that we
[2:50:32] live, Lord. God, so many pressures,
[2:50:35] Lord, that are upon the church and God,
[2:50:38] on young people. It just seems like
[2:50:40] today it's a constant battle to serve
[2:50:43] you. But Lord, I just ask you this
[2:50:46] morning, Lord, for your hand of mercy,
[2:50:48] Lord, to sweep across this congregation,
[2:50:52] God, as you have proclaimed to be here,
[2:50:54] Lord, as our brother has confessed that
[2:50:57] that same pillar of fire is present
[2:50:59] among us here this morning, God, I just
[2:51:01] ask you, Lord, while you're here, Lord,
[2:51:03] while you're near my every heart, Lord,
[2:51:05] God, I pray that you would take
[2:51:07] everything that is unclean from our
[2:51:09] life. Lord, I pray we could rededicate
[2:51:11] our life to you, Lord, this morning.
[2:51:13] God, I pray Lord that you would restore
[2:51:15] the spirit of God. Lord, may you refill
[2:51:18] us with the Holy Ghost. God, may there
[2:51:20] be a refreshing from the throne of God
[2:51:23] in every heart. Lord, may may we have a
[2:51:25] such a life, Lord, before you, God, that
[2:51:28] a surrender, Lord Jesus.
[2:51:31] God, I pray you'd fill every heart with
[2:51:33] the Holy Ghost. God, I pray that when
[2:51:35] they leave this place, Lord, there'd be
[2:51:38] such a zeal to serve you, God. Lord,
[2:51:40] such a spirit of worship in our hearts,
[2:51:42] Lord.
[2:51:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I just ask you, Lord, that you
[2:51:45] would just strengthen them, Lord.
[2:51:47] Strengthen this church and this body of
[2:51:49] believers, Lord, this morning, God. They
[2:51:52] may they be a lighthouse, Lord,
[2:51:53] everywhere they go, professing the name
[2:51:56] of Jesus Christ. You're the same
[2:51:59] yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, may
[2:52:01] we manifest that very scripture here
[2:52:03] this morning. God, we thank you for
[2:52:06] everyone, Lord. As we worship you this
[2:52:08] morning, God, we just surrender our life
[2:52:10] to you this morning. Lord,
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; all to him.

[2:53:27] pleasures
[2:53:29] all forsen.
[2:53:33] How many just lift your hands this
[2:53:34] morning? Say, "Lord, let me just give my
[2:53:37] all to you. Lord, let me serve you.
[2:53:39] Lord, let me be a worthy servant. Let me
[2:53:41] be found on that day that you could look
[2:53:44] at me and say, a good and faithful
[2:53:46] servant.
[2:53:48] I surrender

[2:57:30] to come and fellowship and eat with us
[2:57:33] today and maybe take what uh take what
[2:57:36] God has done for you and let it be a
[2:57:38] testimony in your life. Amen. I tell you
[2:57:41] what, it's a it's a growing process
[2:57:44] being a believer every day. Just God
[2:57:47] does a little bit more. The more you
[2:57:49] feed on the word and the stronger you
[2:57:52] get and the more time you spend in
[2:57:54] prayer, the stronger you get. Amen. And
[2:57:57] God raises us all. Don't worry about
[2:57:59] where you come from. Worry about where
[2:58:01] you're going. We spend too much time
[2:58:03] looking at the past anyway. I ain't
[2:58:05] worried about that. I'm worried about
[2:58:07] where we're going. Amen. If you love the
[2:58:09] Lord this morning, Amen. Turn around,
[2:58:12] tell somebody you love on this morning.
[2:58:14] Say, "It's been good to be in the in the
[2:58:16] meetings with you.
[2:58:19] Boy, it may never be like this again.
[2:58:20] May be our last meeting we ever have,
[2:58:22] but I say God bless you. May God richly
[2:58:26] bless every one of you. May this meeting
[2:58:27] be something that has strengthened your
[2:58:29] heart and cause you to be closer to God.
[2:58:33] Made your testimony that much stronger.
[2:58:36] We're trophies
[2:58:38] of God's grace. Amen. Isn't it
[2:58:41] wonderful? What a powerful message. How
[2:58:43] many enjoyed that message tonight? Isn't
[2:58:45] that powerful?
[2:58:47] Trophies of God's grace.
[2:58:52] Brother Andrew said, "And these trophies
[2:58:54] These trophies have a voice.
[2:58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a voice. Not just
[2:59:00] something to hang on a wall. We got a
[2:59:01] voice.
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God that he's given us a
[2:59:05] voice to be able to tell the testimonies
[2:59:08] that God has done in our life. Friends,
[2:59:10] don't hold your voice. Don't hold it
[2:59:13] back. Let your testimony. Let it shine.
[2:59:16] You say, "What what can I say?" Can I
[2:59:17] tell you? Can I go ahead and tell you
[2:59:19] the greatest voice that you have is the
[2:59:22] life that you live.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; It speaks louder than anything you could
[2:59:26] say out of your mouth. Every time you go
[2:59:28] into the community or going to school,
[2:59:30] the very life that you're living is a
[2:59:32] testimony of the grace of God. And it
[2:59:35] don't take long somebody comes by and
[2:59:36] say, "Why do you live like that? What
[2:59:38] happened to you? Timber, what happened
[2:59:40] to you? What changed? You used to want
[2:59:42] to come down here and party and hang out
[2:59:44] with us. What changed? What took that
[2:59:45] out of you? Well, I met Jesus one day.
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; He put something else in my heart. And
[2:59:50] that thing, what used to satisfy me, it
[2:59:52] don't satisfy me anymore. But the love
[2:59:55] of God has taken over my heart.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to spend my life serving him.
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; Be a testimony of the grace of God. With
[3:00:03] Amos, you be a testimony of God's grace.
[3:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let God's voice speak through your
[3:00:09] life.
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a powerful thing it is to
[3:00:13] allow the voice of God to speak out of
[3:00:16] your life, manifesting the grace of God
[3:00:20] is present in this hour.
[3:00:22] God is so good. You love the Lord this
[3:00:25] morning. I hate to even leave. Amen.

[3:00:31] his presence and his mercy,
[3:00:33] the grace that he give us. Amen. Isn't

[3:00:39] He's just been so wonderful to us.
[3:00:42] Amen.
[3:00:44] Appreciate you coming. God bless you as
[3:00:46] you go this morning.
[3:00:49] And I look
[3:00:52] around
[3:00:54] and see
[3:00:56] all the good things
[3:01:00] that you've done for me.
[3:01:04] I know
[3:01:06] I'm unworthy
[3:01:08] of them all
[3:01:15] and your blessings.
[3:01:20] Lord, you freely give.
[3:01:23] I
[3:01:24] [Music]
[3:01:29] got
[3:01:32] so much
[3:01:34] to thank him for.
[3:01:40] Oh, I've got so much
[3:01:45] to thank him for.
[3:01:49] So much to praise him for. You see, he's
[3:01:54] done.
[3:01:56] So very much for me.
[3:02:03] Oh, when I think
[3:02:07] of all that my God has done,
[3:02:12] the kind of life you brought me Oh my
[3:02:16] God.
[3:02:18] So much to think.
