[41:17] So I say
[41:20] all my life,
[41:22] oh you have been faithful.
[41:28] all my life to be
[41:32] so good. With every breath
[41:36] that I am able
[41:40] I will sing
[41:43] of the goodness of God.
[41:47] Yes, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[41:55] Well, I will sing of the goodness of
[42:00] God.
[42:03] I will sing
[42:05] of the goodness of God.
[42:10] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[42:11] clap of praise tonight? How many can
[42:14] sing of his goodness? How many say,
[42:16] "God's been good to me."
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't think of a day that goes
[42:20] by that God hasn't done something for me
[42:23] and I don't let a day go by that I don't
[42:26] thank him for what he does. Amen.
[42:28] certainly love the Lord and just say
[42:30] it's good to be back in the uh house of
[42:33] the Lord with you tonight and we sure
[42:36] enjoyed our uh meeting and went up to
[42:40] Ohio and as brother Wayne and their
[42:43] church there in Ohio and had a wonderful
[42:47] time there and visiting with the saints
[42:49] and uh they asked that we bring
[42:51] greetings back to the church tonight and
[42:53] uh there's several that are coming down
[42:55] for the tent meeting next week. So, uh,
[42:57] we just, uh, really enjoyed the time and
[42:59] and just seeing, uh, the Lord, uh, come
[43:03] by and move in a special way and, uh, so
[43:06] we just want to want to remember the
[43:08] meetings that are coming up. I know
[43:09] we're certainly looking forward to what
[43:12] God has in store and seeing the guys
[43:14] putting up the tents there before church
[43:16] and and uh, and I don't know if they was
[43:18] expecting it, but they got about halfway
[43:20] done. We fenced them all in with cars.
[43:22] They may as well just they just stuck
[43:24] here. So, they had They may had to find
[43:26] a way out. It's like, but but if if we
[43:29] got to we got hold them here one way or
[43:31] another, we'll we just uh just get them
[43:34] in here. No, we sure appreciate these
[43:37] young men that stayed out there and
[43:38] helped. And want to remember uh brother
[43:41] uh Andrew tonight asked for prayer.
[43:43] They're is preaching for brother David
[43:46] Templeton over in Alabama uh tonight. So
[43:48] remember them in prayer. Also, please
[43:51] pray uh for my grandson Jackson. He fell
[43:55] and has hurt his arm. That's from
[43:57] brother Ed. So, we just want to ask the
[44:00] Lord to touch him. And you they I know
[44:04] God is certainly more than able and I've
[44:06] I've had an experience with broke arms
[44:08] and broke legs and and I've seen God do
[44:10] the miraculous. So, we just trust the
[44:13] Lord to do what God does tonight. Amen.
[44:16] And certainly good to see Sister Sandy
[44:18] back uh uh tonight and and had a good
[44:22] trip. Brother Roy and Sister Judy. And
[44:25] um we just been blessed that they've had
[44:30] Lord has led them to be here at our
[44:32] church and make this their home church.
[44:34] And uh so we certainly appreciate them
[44:37] being here elders uh in this gospel and
[44:40] they mean a lot to me and they'll
[44:42] certainly mean a lot to our church. And
[44:44] uh so we appreciate them. And isn't God
[44:47] good? Amen. He's he's always taking care
[44:49] of his children. And we just want to be
[44:51] in the will of God. And I believe that's
[44:53] the desire of every son and daughter of
[44:54] God is to be in the will of God. And uh
[44:57] so we certainly ask that tonight. Maybe
[44:59] if you have a need on your heart, uh
[45:01] won't you just ask the Lord to come? I
[45:03] believe that he's certainly uh more than
[45:06] able to do just that. And uh just pray
[45:09] each one in your own way. Gracious
[45:11] heavenly father, Lord, how we love you
[45:13] tonight, Lord. And God, we thank you for
[45:16] another opportunity to come and just to
[45:19] share the gospel, Lord, with people that
[45:22] are here with open hearts. And Lord, we
[45:25] have a a strong desire, Lord, to to grow
[45:28] in the word of God. And Lord, we just
[45:30] ask you tonight, Lord, that you would
[45:33] bring a special anointing among the
[45:35] church. And Lord, that you would answer
[45:37] every question, Lord, you would meet
[45:39] every need. And God, may we just get out
[45:42] of the way tonight, Lord, to give you a
[45:44] liberty to do just that. And Lord, those
[45:46] that need healing, Lord, I pray that
[45:48] you'd give healing in their body. Lord,
[45:50] maybe somebody just needs a word of
[45:52] encouragement tonight, Lord. You're more
[45:54] than able to do just that, Lord. And we
[45:57] just ask you to come, Lord. And we'll be
[45:58] careful to give you the glory for all
[46:01] that's done, Lord. For these needs that
[46:02] were read out loud, Lord. I pray you
[46:04] would meet them tonight, Lord. Touch
[46:05] their bodies. We pray in Jesus name.
[46:09] Amen.
[46:10] Amen. We just say it's good to be in the
[46:12] house of the Lord tonight. We want to
[46:14] invite you to the scripture uh to the
[46:16] book of Genesis and we're going to read
[46:18] one verse out of the 19th chapter and
[46:22] we'll read out of the 15th verse. So
[46:24] Genesis 19 and 15 and give you just a
[46:28] moment uh to turn there. Genesis 19 and
[46:33] 15. How many's looking forward to the
[46:34] meetings there? Amen. We are excited. a
[46:38] lot of people that are coming that's
[46:40] been calling and texting and and so
[46:42] we're looking looking forward to that
[46:44] and and and it just it's just something
[46:47] together uh with people of like precious
[46:49] faith. Amen. That uh I know this when I
[46:53] uh you know I have needs in my own life
[46:55] and I can't think of anybody to go to
[46:57] except for people of faith. When you
[46:59] have real needs uh that's the kind of
[47:01] people you turn to. So when you have a
[47:03] meeting and have people gather like
[47:05] that, it's just um uh I just can't wait
[47:07] to see what God has in store. Amen. So I
[47:10] want to read tonight uh Genesis the 19th
[47:12] chapter. We're going to read out of the
[47:13] 15th verse. And the Bible says, "And
[47:16] when the morning arose, then the angels
[47:19] hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy
[47:22] wife and thy two daughters which are
[47:24] here, lest thou be consumed in the
[47:28] iniquity of the city." And we'll just
[47:30] ask the Lord to add his blessings to the
[47:32] reading of the word as you take your
[47:34] seats. Take thy two daughters which are
[47:37] here, lest thou be consumed in the
[47:39] iniquity of the city. I'd like to take
[47:41] this uh uh scripture tonight and speak
[47:44] on arise and take. Arise and take. This
[47:47] was the instruction of the angel of the
[47:50] Lord to Lot. Arise and take. You know,
[47:52] this scripture has been used many times
[47:54] in speaking on escaping from judgment or
[47:58] uh making preparation for the coming of
[48:00] the Lord. And uh uh there's been many
[48:02] many sermons no doubt preached out of
[48:04] this very uh out of this very scripture.
[48:07] But you know, when you read this, you
[48:08] really can see a an an act of the grace
[48:11] of God here uh that God would go into a
[48:14] place of judgment and send an angel into
[48:16] a place of judgment. And I thought here
[48:18] it's such a wonderful type as an act of
[48:21] grace because uh God was not willing to
[48:23] leave them in a Sodom condition. The
[48:25] these were people that belong to God and
[48:27] he wasn't willing uh to leave them in
[48:29] this place. But uh that before judgment
[48:32] would come here with this angel would
[48:33] come on his way and the angel would
[48:35] carry a message uh the message of arise
[48:38] and take what is thine. I thought what a
[48:40] message for an angel to carry uh in a
[48:42] time of judgment is to arise and take
[48:44] what is thine. And uh you know they
[48:46] didn't realize that whenever they was
[48:48] following uh those men that those that
[48:51] those angels or the Bible said as these
[48:53] men would come uh to them it was just
[48:55] men that were sent there. But they
[48:56] didn't realize that following those men
[48:59] uh was their only way to escape
[49:00] judgment. They couldn't foresee
[49:02] judgment. They didn't foresee uh fire
[49:04] and brimstone. They had no vision of it.
[49:06] they had uh the only thing that they had
[49:09] was the word of the men that were
[49:11] standing in their house uh that was
[49:13] trying to offer them a way of escape and
[49:15] given an instruction. And so uh in
[49:17] reading this I I just there's so much
[49:19] power in this scripture. I could take a
[49:21] whole series on this one scripture, but
[49:23] uh just to take a little bit direction
[49:24] this uh or tonight, but uh in reading
[49:27] this, it shows us a principle theme in
[49:29] the whole entire Bible or or or a
[49:32] requirement that God has to every
[49:33] believer. You find this throughout the
[49:35] scripture. uh first in that God never
[49:38] judges without first bringing a warning.
[49:40] So, it's something that we can uh that
[49:42] we can uh uh stand upon tonight that
[49:44] God's always going to bring a warning
[49:45] before he brings judgment. But, uh then
[49:48] also that when God gives a warning, the
[49:50] warning is not just a blanket warning.
[49:52] You know, it's easy for somebody to come
[49:53] by and say, "Uh, there there's a fire
[49:55] coming. There's a fire coming." But that
[49:57] don't really help you because you you
[49:59] may run this way or or you ever seen a
[50:00] tornado siren go off and and my when the
[50:03] tornado sirens people run everywhere.
[50:05] One's going east, one's going south,
[50:07] one's going west because they don't know
[50:09] where the tornado is. So, uh, just a
[50:11] warning isn't good enough because you
[50:13] may run right into trouble while you're
[50:15] trying to flee trouble and and run right
[50:17] into it. But whenever God gives a
[50:18] warning, his warning always provides a
[50:21] leading or it provides a direction for
[50:23] the church or his children. And so, uh,
[50:25] God always gives us something to follow
[50:27] after, you know. And so I I followed
[50:29] this through the scripture and thinking
[50:31] about how God would find us in a
[50:32] condition and then try to lead us out of
[50:34] it. And uh in the warning it would
[50:37] provide a leading and I came to Jesus
[50:39] even whenever Jesus would speak to the
[50:41] to the disciples Jesus would say Matthew
[50:43] 16:24 he said if any man that will come
[50:47] after me somebody say any man. You know
[50:49] what that means? That it's the same
[50:51] instruction for everybody. It don't
[50:52] matter if you're rich. It don't matter
[50:54] if you're poor. It don't matter if
[50:55] you're a great pastor or a little
[50:57] person. however you feel. But Jesus
[50:59] said, "If any man will come after me,
[51:02] let him deny himself and take up his
[51:04] cross and follow me." I think that's
[51:06] wonderful because it shows us that God
[51:07] is no respector of persons. And Jesus
[51:10] gives this out to anybody. It don't
[51:12] matter who you are. It don't matter
[51:13] where you come from or what kind of
[51:15] background or what you've been taught or
[51:17] who you've been raised under. But Jesus
[51:19] said, "If any man will come after me,"
[51:21] he gives us all the same instruction. He
[51:23] said, "Deny himself and take up his
[51:25] cross and come and follow me." You know,
[51:27] I want to I want to lay this out here
[51:28] tonight that first off, when Jesus makes
[51:31] this statement, Brother Joe, that this
[51:33] cross was not a literal cross. He he
[51:35] didn't looking for us to go build a
[51:36] wooden cross and pack it on our
[51:38] shoulders and and drag it around the
[51:40] world. So, the cross was not something
[51:42] that was literal that we're packing
[51:43] around. And neither was the following of
[51:46] Jesus meant to be some carnal thing. The
[51:48] car the cross wasn't a carnal thing.
[51:50] Your carnal mind makes it to be this
[51:52] this big image made out of cedar wood.
[51:54] But the cross wasn't a carnal thing. And
[51:56] neither is following Jesus a carnal
[51:58] thing. But to follow after Jesus, what
[52:01] he's telling us is to come into this
[52:03] place, a a spiritual place with God in
[52:06] order to be able to follow him. So
[52:07] following Jesus is not a carnal thing.
[52:09] It's a spiritual act. Carrying the
[52:11] cross, it ain't a carnal thing. It's a
[52:13] spiritual thing. I and I know to some
[52:15] people sometimes it seems odd when you
[52:17] start talking about following Christ in
[52:20] a spiritual manner, but this is what
[52:21] he's calling the church to. And but can
[52:23] I tell you what Paul said? 1
[52:25] Corinthians, he said, "But the natural
[52:26] man," the reason it seems odd to be a
[52:28] spiritual person or or to follow
[52:30] spiritually. He said, "Because the
[52:32] natural man receiveth not the things of
[52:34] the spirit of God, for they are
[52:36] foolishness to the natural man, neither
[52:38] can he even know them because they are
[52:41] only spiritually discerned." So
[52:43] spiritual things aren't discerned by a
[52:45] natural man. They're not discerned by a
[52:47] carnal mind. A spiritual thing can only
[52:49] be discerned by a spiritual mind.
[52:51] Therefore, it can't be judged. It can't
[52:53] be talked about. It can't be explain.
[52:55] That's why that's why the world looks at
[52:57] at a spiritfilled church and sometimes
[52:58] it's easy to look at spiritual things
[53:01] and say, "Well, that and call them
[53:03] fanatical." It's easy for an outsider.
[53:04] Well, I may as well preach. But it's
[53:06] easy for an outsider to say to call a
[53:09] spiritual person a fanatic. It's easy
[53:11] for them to look at you and say you
[53:12] belong to a cult. It's easy for them to
[53:14] look at you and say uh what you believe
[53:16] is false because because you can't
[53:18] discern spiritual things with a carnal
[53:20] mind. And friend, I I got news for you
[53:22] tonight. I I don't I don't entertain
[53:24] devils. Can I can I just lay this out
[53:26] here tonight? I I don't entertain
[53:28] devils. there. There's no demon spirit
[53:30] that's going to come to me and tell me
[53:32] and challenge the spirit of God or or or
[53:34] or a spiritual move of God and challenge
[53:37] it with some theology or some thought
[53:39] that man made or something that they
[53:40] read on the internet. I don't entertain
[53:42] devils. I I'm not going to sit down and
[53:44] let them fill my mind full of a bunch of
[53:46] garbage and well, here's the way I I
[53:48] think it is and look at where this came
[53:50] from and you know this person sat over
[53:52] here. I'm not letting a carnal mind,
[53:54] some carnal-minded devil that was
[53:56] anointed uh uh that anointed somebody to
[53:59] come and sit in my presence to
[54:00] entertain. I'm not not going to
[54:02] entertain him to uh to to allow him to
[54:04] to lead me away from the spirit of God.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; You know, I had a I had a teacher one
[54:08] time when I was in uh uh in the music
[54:11] department and and I and I'm he was he
[54:13] was a a trumpet instructor and that's
[54:16] all he did was taught trumpet. I
[54:17] remember uh one day I was sitting in his
[54:19] office and he was talking about all
[54:20] these orchestras and things that was
[54:22] going on. And I I made this statement. I
[54:24] regretted making it after I did. But I
[54:26] made this statement. I said, "Well, you
[54:28] know, the worst thing about an orchestra
[54:29] is all the stringed instruments." I
[54:31] said, "I can't stand them violins and
[54:32] stuff in there. They sound I just don't
[54:34] like the way they sound." He just stood
[54:36] up and put his hand up. He said, "Boy,
[54:37] you're showing your ignorance." Well, I
[54:40] didn't, you know, I it took me a while
[54:41] to understand what he meant by it. He
[54:43] said, "But it's not an orchestra without
[54:45] the stringed instrument." You know, and
[54:46] I thought, you know, you know, I used to
[54:48] hear him say that. I thought, you know,
[54:50] it took me a while to understand that,
[54:51] but you know, I think that's going to be
[54:52] my new saying. Next time somebody comes
[54:54] to sit down anointed by a devil to try
[54:57] to challenge the spiritual things of
[54:59] God, it's okay just to look right back
[55:01] at them and say, "Well, I say this
[55:02] nicely, but you're showing your
[55:04] ignorance." See, because you're speaking
[55:06] from a natural mind or from a carnal
[55:08] mind, and ignorant ain't a bad thing. It
[55:10] just means you don't know any better.
[55:11] So, so your ignorance is on fine
[55:13] display. Sometimes when the devil, well,
[55:15] I may as well preach it anyway. But
[55:16] sometimes when the devil sits down in
[55:18] your living room or picks up the phone
[55:20] and he uses somebody to try to uh to try
[55:22] to point out negative things about a
[55:24] move of God, well, if they ain't a
[55:26] spiritual person, I certainly wouldn't
[55:28] listen to them when they're talking
[55:29] about spiritual things. They're just
[55:31] showing their ignorance. See, it's easy
[55:33] to look at spiritual things and call
[55:34] them fanatical whenever you're a
[55:36] carnal-minded person. You got to be
[55:38] careful with it though because you
[55:40] because the spirit of God is what God is
[55:42] using to lead the church.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; So be careful what you call carnal. Be
[55:46] careful what you call man-made. Be
[55:48] careful what you call man following
[55:50] because spiritual things were made by
[55:52] God. The very God that created the
[55:54] heaven and the earth. And if you don't
[55:56] understand it, then just leave it alone
[55:57] and don't understand it. But don't ever
[55:59] stand and call something that God called
[56:01] spiritual and you call it carnal.
[56:04] That's what they done in the days of
[56:05] Noah when Noah went out and he built an
[56:07] ark. And the Bible would say as he would
[56:09] he would go through all of this to
[56:11] build. So many would stand around Noah
[56:13] and talk to Noah. I wonder how many
[56:15] times that somebody came by Noah and
[56:16] said, "Well, that's just the goofiest
[56:18] thing I've ever seen." How how silly
[56:20] that is. Why you call that God? That
[56:22] ain't God. This temple over here that we
[56:24] built, that's what God is. What do you
[56:25] got to do with God? What's a boat going
[56:27] to help us? But you know, let me tell
[56:28] you what happened one day. That same
[56:30] Noah us stood at the door of that hour
[56:32] with a proclamation that the hour is at
[56:35] hand when the word of God that I spoke
[56:37] about is going to be fulfilled. And
[56:39] friends, let me tell you, there coming a
[56:40] day that there will be a voice at the
[56:42] door of the ark that will say the hour
[56:44] is at hand. That the word that you have
[56:47] heard is going to be fulfilled.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And when Noah made that commandment,
[56:51] when he made that statement, it was God,
[56:53] the hand of God came into the land and
[56:55] he closed the door of the ark. And the
[56:57] Bible said that the waters begin to
[56:58] climb. Let me tell you what happened
[57:00] when the waters climbed. Every man that
[57:02] had a breath, he died in the water in
[57:04] the flood uh in the flood of the earth.
[57:07] But the only person that or the people
[57:08] that didn't was those that was in the
[57:10] ark. And the Bible said as the ar the
[57:12] waters rose, so did the ark rise. Isn't
[57:15] it something that the very thing that
[57:16] God sent to destroy the earth is the
[57:19] very thing that saved Noah and his
[57:21] family.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; But said, that's what's happened today.
[57:24] That's why people have gotten so off
[57:26] because the very thing that God sent to
[57:28] save the earth has become a stumbling
[57:31] block to the very world that God is
[57:33] trying to save. So, isn't that the
[57:35] truth? That's what the Holy Ghost done.
[57:37] If God sent a Holy Ghost to save us,
[57:39] that's become, you ever notice that's
[57:40] the stumbling block to the church?
[57:42] There's a there's millions of believers
[57:44] that'll follow after and believe the
[57:46] Bible and say and say, "Certainly, I'll
[57:48] believe that and be a, you know, some
[57:50] nominal Christian or something as long
[57:52] as I don't have to be spiritual." I may
[57:53] I may just say it what it is. As long as
[57:55] we can just be carnal church members,
[57:57] we'll be church members. I can go to
[57:59] work. I can give money. I can have a
[58:01] house. I can support. I can put my name
[58:03] on a door. We can be somebody as long as
[58:05] we don't have to be spiritual. You see
[58:07] where the stumbling block lays in the in
[58:09] in in the gospel, brother Mark, is being
[58:11] spiritual. It's the Holy Ghost. It it
[58:13] it's to be able to get out of our carnal
[58:15] mind and and fight out of this flesh and
[58:18] get into a spiritual place with God. The
[58:20] place that Jesus was inviting us to.
[58:22] This is the stumbling block to the world
[58:24] when they see people shouting in the
[58:26] presence of God and speaking in tongues
[58:28] and rolling around the floor and dancing
[58:30] and running around the building and
[58:32] shouting hallelujah. Well, I can I can
[58:33] do anything but I just don't want to be
[58:35] a part of that. It's became a stumbling
[58:37] block to the world. Holiness is a
[58:39] stumbling block to the world. Spiritual
[58:41] things are a stumbling block to the
[58:43] world.
[58:44] He
[58:45] &gt;&gt; said it become a stumbling block. He
[58:46] said the things the the Holy Spirit the
[58:48] very making the world don't want it.
[58:50] It's making the world where they don't
[58:52] want it. The things that the Holy Spirit
[58:54] causes you to do, it makes to where the
[58:57] world don't want it.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? The very thing that
[59:00] would save one would destroy another.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He said the very thing they're turning
[59:04] down is what will take the church up.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He said it's the Holy Spirit that's
[59:08] going to take the church in the rapture.
[59:10] Friends, the whole world, they can deny
[59:12] the Holy Ghost. But let me tell you what
[59:13] happens. When you deny the Holy Ghost,
[59:15] you just deny God.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; When you deny healing, you deny God.
[59:19] When you deny the move of God, you deny
[59:21] God. When you when you deny the rapture
[59:23] of the church, you deny God. When you
[59:25] deny the power of God, you deny God.
[59:27] When you deny move of the spirit, you're
[59:29] denying God. But I think what we need to
[59:31] do tonight, instead of denying God and
[59:34] denying the things of God and denying
[59:36] the Holy Ghost and denying the move of
[59:38] God and denying the spirit of God, I
[59:40] think what we ought to do is what Jesus
[59:41] said and deny ourselves and take up the
[59:44] cross and follow Jesus right into that
[59:47] spiritual place that he has called us
[59:48] into. I didn't come to deny God. I came
[59:52] to deny me. I wonder how many say amen
[59:55] tonight. How many real believers we got
[59:57] here? He's This is This ain't my words.
[59:58] This ain't something that was made up.
[1:00:00] This is what Jesus said. He said, "How
[1:00:02] many would deny theirel and take up
[1:00:04] their cross and follow me.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I don't deny God. I deny me."
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; When I read a scripture I come across,
[1:00:12] sometimes sometimes it's a little hard
[1:00:14] to read. Sometimes it don't strike you
[1:00:16] right. Sometimes it's corrective.
[1:00:18] Sometimes it makes you change the way
[1:00:19] you live and the change the way you
[1:00:21] dress and change the way you act. But
[1:00:23] when you read it, I don't want to deny
[1:00:24] the scripture. Let me just deny me.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Don't deny God. Deny yourself.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and follow me.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; See, God has called the church to walk
[1:00:33] with him. Isn't that what he called?
[1:00:35] Come take up your cross, follow me. You
[1:00:37] say, "Well, what's going to happen
[1:00:39] whenever I start this kind of a walk?"
[1:00:41] And well, I'll just tell you, you go
[1:00:42] through the scripture, ask Enoch what
[1:00:44] happens
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; when you walk with God.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he walked with God and
[1:00:48] then one day he wasn't in this world no
[1:00:50] more.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; He walked so close to God and he
[1:00:53] literally exited the the very the very
[1:00:55] atmosphere of this world that we live
[1:00:57] in. And friends, let me tell you
[1:00:58] something tonight. You can walk close
[1:01:00] enough to God that you can physically
[1:01:02] walk out of the atmosphere of this world
[1:01:05] into a supernatural place with God to
[1:01:07] where the things of this world, they
[1:01:08] don't bind you. Sickness don't bind you.
[1:01:10] All these pressures of life, they no
[1:01:12] longer bind you. But you can enter into
[1:01:14] a place with God that you're completely
[1:01:16] out of the atmosphere of this world that
[1:01:18] would hold you down. Yes, sir.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Said he walked out of this world in 12.
[1:01:22] He was where God had called him.
[1:01:23] Friends, don't you realize that's where
[1:01:25] we're heading tonight? One day you're
[1:01:26] going to take your last step on this
[1:01:28] earth. Let me tell you about these
[1:01:29] people. You can make fun of them. You
[1:01:31] can mock them. You can ridicule them all
[1:01:32] you want to, but let me tell you about
[1:01:34] these people here. One day they'll take
[1:01:36] their last step upon this earth and
[1:01:38] they'll walk right out of this world and
[1:01:40] enter into a heavenly place and a
[1:01:42] reunion with their God. You can call
[1:01:44] them what you want, but I say this
[1:01:46] tonight that every believer under the
[1:01:48] sound of my voice will step out of this
[1:01:50] world and step into eternity. There
[1:01:52] ain't one of us that'll miss you. When
[1:01:54] you belong to God and you're a believer
[1:01:56] and you're part of the bride of Jesus
[1:01:58] Christ, you don't have to worry about
[1:01:59] it. One day you'll take your last step
[1:02:01] through the muck and the mire. You'll
[1:02:03] drag your last burden. You'll carry your
[1:02:05] last load and you'll step right into
[1:02:07] eternity with God.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Friends, there's many places we could go
[1:02:11] in this life that are great places. I
[1:02:14] know there's many things that we would
[1:02:15] desire to go to as men. There's many
[1:02:17] great events that no doubt that people
[1:02:19] line up in long lines to be able to get
[1:02:21] to. But there's one place that you
[1:02:23] better make sure you don't miss.
[1:02:25] Friends, it's greater than any Super
[1:02:27] Bowl. It's greater than any VIP tickets.
[1:02:29] It's greater than any world movie
[1:02:31] premiere. It's greater than a dinner
[1:02:32] with any president of any country. I'm
[1:02:35] talking about a place to go with God
[1:02:37] where the elite of the elite will be the
[1:02:39] VIP of God, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:43] There's somebody's in the kingdom of God
[1:02:45] that'll be raptured off of this earth.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; There ain't no place I'd rather be.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; One day we'll march right out of this
[1:02:52] dimension into another.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Enoch was a type of the bride of Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ. He's our type in the Old
[1:02:57] Testament. He the Bible says, "And he
[1:02:59] walked with God and he was not."
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I love how simple that is. I
[1:03:05] just love it. And he walked with God and
[1:03:07] he was not. Don't that just simplify
[1:03:09] things. Can I say that again? Just let
[1:03:11] it sink in your heart. He walked with
[1:03:13] God and then he was not. Don't we make
[1:03:15] it so much harder than that? But he
[1:03:17] walked with God and he was not. Friends,
[1:03:20] don't you realize that there ain't no
[1:03:21] other walk that you can walk on this
[1:03:22] earth that has that destination
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; but walking with him.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will bring you to that
[1:03:29] destination. This is the only walk
[1:03:31] that'll bring you to a rapture,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; bring you to this destination.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; See you realize that's that's why we're
[1:03:37] here. That's why we have a church. But
[1:03:38] Ram said that's our purpose is a closer
[1:03:40] walk with God. He said, "I believe
[1:03:42] that's what we can all do and believe is
[1:03:44] the Lord Jesus is with us and we're here
[1:03:46] to walk closer with him.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I want to walk closer with him until one
[1:03:50] day I have the testimony that Enoch
[1:03:52] has." Friends, don't you realize there's
[1:03:54] going to be somebody that has the
[1:03:55] testimony of Enoch? I wonder how close
[1:03:57] to God I can walk. I I want to I want to
[1:04:00] interview Enoch and say, "How close to
[1:04:02] God did you have to walk that you could
[1:04:03] walk out of this world and go on a walk
[1:04:06] with God?"
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; That's how close I want to walk with
[1:04:09] him. to walk with God. That's why we
[1:04:11] have meetings. That's why we preach the
[1:04:13] gospel. That's why we have a church
[1:04:15] because we have a we want to have a
[1:04:17] closer walk with God. We want to be able
[1:04:19] to introduce people in a walk in their
[1:04:21] life that that that that they can walk
[1:04:23] out of this world and the pressures of
[1:04:24] this life. We want to give people a
[1:04:26] relationship with God that God can lead
[1:04:28] them throughout their life,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; a closer walk with God. It gives you
[1:04:33] more of God. It gives you more
[1:04:35] revelation. It gives you more of the
[1:04:37] love of God. It gives you more of the
[1:04:39] things of God, of the nature of God, of
[1:04:41] the wisdom of God, a closer walk with
[1:04:43] God. It just makes you who you really
[1:04:45] are.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; This is what God is calling us to. Jesus
[1:04:49] said, "If anyone come after me, let him
[1:04:51] deny himself." It means lose sight of
[1:04:54] yourself.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Forget himself and his own interest.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Deny himself
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; and take up the cross and cleave to me.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Cleave to me. Hallelujah.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; In living and in dying
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; in our life, in our leaving this earth,
[1:05:14] brother Mark, it's to cleave unto the
[1:05:17] cross. But we're going to say that's
[1:05:18] what we need tonight. There's a whole
[1:05:20] church full of some soft hybrid flabby
[1:05:22] churches. Just make a confession. This
[1:05:24] is the truth. Just make a confession and
[1:05:27] you're a Christian. The whole world is
[1:05:28] full of people that'll just let you put
[1:05:30] your name on a book and be a Christian.
[1:05:32] As long as you sign this and put a here,
[1:05:34] let me get an offering. We'll put a
[1:05:35] little offering out there. as long as
[1:05:36] you put enough money in the offering
[1:05:38] plate. Well, well, that that's good
[1:05:39] enough. But friends, one day you'll find
[1:05:41] out it's all lies. It's all deception.
[1:05:43] There ain't there ain't but one way to
[1:05:45] really make it. He said that ain't that
[1:05:46] ain't a Christian life. The only real
[1:05:48] Christian life is to deny yourself and
[1:05:50] do what Jesus said.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; A Christian life is a life of
[1:05:54] self-denial. Deny yourself and take up
[1:05:56] your cross. Depend on him for everything
[1:05:58] that you have need of.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Friends, let me tell you something about
[1:06:02] following God. It's not always an easy
[1:06:04] decision.
[1:06:05] But let me tell you this. There ain't
[1:06:07] one person today that's ever It's It's a
[1:06:09] hard decision. Let me tell you why.
[1:06:11] Because there ain't nobody that's ever
[1:06:12] walked with God that didn't have to
[1:06:14] first walk away from something else.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Can I take a minute?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Nobody's ever walked with God that
[1:06:19] didn't have to walk away from something.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; God, in order to have to draw closer to
[1:06:24] God, if you're calling closer to God,
[1:06:26] you're going further away from
[1:06:27] something.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You don't You have a
[1:06:29] front, you have a back. The farther you
[1:06:30] go this way, the farther you are away
[1:06:32] from that. So the the closer you go with
[1:06:34] God, the further away from something. We
[1:06:36] always come out of something. We always
[1:06:38] have to leave something. Remember when
[1:06:39] he called Peter, Peter had to leave his
[1:06:41] fishing boats over by the sea to follow
[1:06:43] Jesus. When he when he called Abraham,
[1:06:45] Abraham left his family and he went into
[1:06:48] the land that God called him. Noah, he
[1:06:50] he he left his he left his own dreams
[1:06:52] and his own ambitions and he and he
[1:06:54] dedicated his life to doing what God
[1:06:56] called him to do. See, you always have
[1:06:58] to leave something in order to go where
[1:07:00] God wants you. Enoch, he he he walked
[1:07:03] close to God. Moses, he he left the
[1:07:05] palace of Egypt just so he could be able
[1:07:08] to follow God where where he had a place
[1:07:10] where he could be the next Pharaoh. But
[1:07:12] Moses put it behind him and he went and
[1:07:14] he followed after God. This is a
[1:07:16] powerful point that I think about
[1:07:17] whenever you're walking with God that in
[1:07:19] order to get in order to get in with
[1:07:23] God, you have to get out of where you
[1:07:24] are. That's right.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; If God is calling you to this place, in
[1:07:27] order to get into this place with God,
[1:07:30] you're going to have to get out of
[1:07:31] something. See, otherwise, God wouldn't
[1:07:32] be calling you. He wouldn't that there's
[1:07:34] a call there for a reason because you're
[1:07:36] in something in some condition, in some
[1:07:39] spiritual condition or some place in
[1:07:40] your life, and God calls you out of it.
[1:07:42] But in order to get into that place with
[1:07:44] God, you got to come out of that.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And so here, God is always calling us.
[1:07:48] That that's a powerful thing about the
[1:07:50] call of God. In order to get in, you
[1:07:52] must first get out. That's why he called
[1:07:54] us. That's why he sent Revelations 18.
[1:07:57] He said, "Come out of her, my people."
[1:07:59] That was the call of the message of the
[1:08:00] hour. Brother Mark is God is calling us
[1:08:02] out of something before he can take us
[1:08:04] into this place with God.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Before there could ever be a rapture,
[1:08:08] there had to be a Revelations 18.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; There had to be a come out of her, my
[1:08:12] people. Before we could ever enter in
[1:08:13] with God, listen. Listen what the Bible
[1:08:15] said here. When the angels came to Lot,
[1:08:17] the men said to Lot, "Has there any
[1:08:19] besides the son-in-law, the sons and
[1:08:21] daughters? But bring them out of this
[1:08:23] place, for we will destroy this place
[1:08:25] because the cry of them is waxed and
[1:08:26] great." So here they're telling of the
[1:08:28] judgment that is coming. And the Bible
[1:08:30] said, "But when the morning arose, the
[1:08:32] angels hastened Lot and said, Arise and
[1:08:34] take thy wife and thy two daughters
[1:08:36] which are here, lest thou be consumed in
[1:08:38] the iniquity of the city. Arise and take
[1:08:42] and lest thou be consumed." I thought
[1:08:44] what a call this is. You know, I looked
[1:08:47] back in Israel and saw how that before
[1:08:50] that whenever God would call call them
[1:08:52] on their wilderness journey, Brother Ben
[1:08:53] would use this as a tie. But do you
[1:08:55] realize that before they could ever
[1:08:57] enter into the promised land, they that
[1:08:59] before before Miam could ever uh dance
[1:09:02] with a tambourine on the on the bank of
[1:09:04] the river, before Joshua could ever
[1:09:06] march around the walls of Jericho,
[1:09:08] before Caleb could ever say, "Give me my
[1:09:11] mountain," there had to come a Moses
[1:09:13] that would call the people out of the
[1:09:14] condition that they were in. We read
[1:09:16] about the great victories and we have
[1:09:18] such a shout over the victories of
[1:09:20] entering into the promised land and
[1:09:22] inhabiting the land and feeding on the
[1:09:24] mana and seeing the uh the the water
[1:09:26] come out of a rock. But before they ever
[1:09:28] had a victory, they had to first come
[1:09:30] out of the condition that they were in.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Before Joshua, before Caleb, there was a
[1:09:34] Moses saying, "Come out of her, my
[1:09:36] people." I thank God that he would send
[1:09:38] a message in this hour that would say,
[1:09:40] "Let my people go and come to this
[1:09:42] mountain where they can worship me."
[1:09:44] It's God's desire is for us to come into
[1:09:47] a place of spiritual worship. His It's
[1:09:49] his desire for us to enter into a
[1:09:52] supernatural place with God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Come out of the carnal mind
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; and into a spiritual place with God.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But see, in order to in order to worship
[1:10:01] God and this place that God is calling
[1:10:04] us, you have to first come out of what
[1:10:06] you were under.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't it true?
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; We've all been under something. said,
[1:10:11] "But you can't freely worship God if
[1:10:13] you're under bondage."
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been bound down where you
[1:10:18] couldn't worship? Can I get some hands?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, elders. God bless y'all being
[1:10:22] honest. It helps the young people.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; We've been bound down so much. I didn't
[1:10:26] feel like worshiping God. I've been I've
[1:10:28] been so bound. I I've been in such
[1:10:30] depression that I wouldn't worship God.
[1:10:31] I know what it's like to be in such a
[1:10:33] low state that you couldn't worship God.
[1:10:35] But in order to get to that place with
[1:10:36] God, I had to come out of that
[1:10:38] condition.
[1:10:40] It takes God, you know, I love them
[1:10:42] angels. Sometimes it takes just God to
[1:10:44] anoint somebody to come by your house
[1:10:46] and to take a hold of you and say,
[1:10:48] "Arise. Take and eat. Arise." Isn't that
[1:10:50] what happened happened to Elijah when he
[1:10:52] when he felt that way hiding underneath
[1:10:54] the juniper tree and the angel of the
[1:10:55] Lord came to him. He said, "Elijah,
[1:10:57] arise and eat. Don't don't lay down
[1:10:59] there in that weakened state. You don't
[1:11:00] you don't have to lay down there no
[1:11:02] longer, but God has provided a meal for
[1:11:04] you. He's prepared it before the
[1:11:05] foundation of the world that you can be
[1:11:07] strong.
[1:11:09] Arise and eat.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; God, his desire for us to worship.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; But you can't freely worship when you're
[1:11:15] under something,
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; under bondage, depression,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; under sin, under condemnation, all these
[1:11:22] things that that we get under. But God
[1:11:25] has to call us out of it.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Look, watch Apostle Paul. Whenever God
[1:11:29] called him, brother Bram said that Paul
[1:11:32] had a Christ centered call and that was
[1:11:35] his absolute. I thought, isn't that
[1:11:37] something? There's many people today
[1:11:39] that have callings that are not Christc
[1:11:40] centered.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; So, just having a call isn't good
[1:11:43] enough. Well, I got a calling on my life
[1:11:45] to preach. I got a call on my life to to
[1:11:48] do this kind of work. I got I got a
[1:11:50] calling on my life to sing. But but but
[1:11:51] the calling ain't good enough. He said
[1:11:53] he had a Christ centered call.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; You're talking about a real calling of
[1:11:56] God. See, it's centered around Jesus
[1:11:58] Christ. I think that I think that's the
[1:12:00] problem today. There's many people that
[1:12:01] feel like, well, I've been called to
[1:12:03] worship God, but the problem is it ain't
[1:12:04] a Christ centered call. So they come to
[1:12:06] churches and they worship something.
[1:12:08] They worship men. They worship churches.
[1:12:11] They worship pastors. They worship
[1:12:12] priests. They worship bishops. They
[1:12:15] worship all they worship all kinds of
[1:12:16] things. But our but God has called us
[1:12:19] has given us an invitation to come out
[1:12:21] of that and to follow him and to worship
[1:12:24] God freely in spirit
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; See, when God calls you out of
[1:12:30] something,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; he's always calling you into something.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Into something. If he's calling you into
[1:12:35] something, he's calling you out of
[1:12:36] something. They're they're connected.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; So if God calls you out of doubt, he's
[1:12:41] calling you into faith.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? If if God's calling
[1:12:45] you out of judgment, he's calling you
[1:12:46] into mercy.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; If God is calling you If God is calling
[1:12:50] you out out of the world, he's calling
[1:12:52] you into Christ. If he's calling you out
[1:12:54] of sickness, he's calling you into
[1:12:56] healing. If he's calling you out of
[1:12:58] death, he's calling you into life. God
[1:13:00] God don't call you out without having a
[1:13:02] place for you to go. When God calls you
[1:13:05] out of something, he's leading you into
[1:13:06] something. He don't He don't intend on
[1:13:07] people just wandering around. Friends,
[1:13:09] let me tell you, God has given us a
[1:13:11] place for you to walk in. I think that's
[1:13:13] the problem today is there's too many
[1:13:15] people that's been called out that just
[1:13:16] haven't entered in. They came out of the
[1:13:18] world. They came out of the sin. They
[1:13:20] came out of a bar room. They came out
[1:13:22] they came out of uh uh some some uh
[1:13:25] ill-famed house. They come out of all
[1:13:27] these kind of conditions and
[1:13:29] denominational spirits and churches. All
[1:13:31] these things they come out of. but they
[1:13:33] just haven't entered in yet. But
[1:13:35] friends, I think it's time that we
[1:13:36] recognize that God called me out and God
[1:13:39] called me in. He didn't just call me out
[1:13:41] to sit on a church pew or call me out
[1:13:44] just to take up some space where I would
[1:13:46] sit somewhere. Now I'll sit somewhere
[1:13:48] else, but that ain't what called you to.
[1:13:49] He didn't call you from a bar stool to a
[1:13:52] church pew just to take up space. But
[1:13:54] when he called you out, he's calling you
[1:13:56] in
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; to enter into this place of spiritual
[1:14:00] worship.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; This is our call of God. It's a call to
[1:14:03] enter in. God has calling this church to
[1:14:06] enter into a place of spirit. Let me
[1:14:07] tell you, friend, too long have we sit
[1:14:09] with carnal minds. Too long do we sit
[1:14:11] thinking on the things of the world and
[1:14:13] the things of the flesh and we're so
[1:14:15] bound down by the world that we can't
[1:14:17] even even enter into a move of God
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; where something would happen or somebody
[1:14:21] gets sick. We're so running scared
[1:14:23] because we don't know what to do. But
[1:14:25] God is calling you to a place that you
[1:14:27] can get a hold of God. He's calling you
[1:14:29] to a place that you can have a be on
[1:14:31] friendship with God
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; that when you have need of something
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; friends it's different when you call
[1:14:37] your friend
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; you know you get in some financial
[1:14:40] trouble when you call the bank sometimes
[1:14:42] they say yeah sometimes they say no
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm in bad trouble my truck payment's
[1:14:46] behind can I get another week no we
[1:14:48] don't give you too many weeks no more
[1:14:49] weeks but sometimes you just have to
[1:14:52] call a friend
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; you know and a friend they they they do
[1:14:56] stuff different you ever seen a banker
[1:14:58] They go sell a trailer to help you out.
[1:15:00] Banker ain't selling the trailer. He's
[1:15:01] not your friend. Just a banker, but your
[1:15:04] friend, they try to do stuff. They'll
[1:15:05] they'll go work an extra shift or
[1:15:07] something to to help somebody. I want
[1:15:09] God to be a friend to me.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be a friend to God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I want to have a relationship with God
[1:15:16] that that when I need when I need God, I
[1:15:18] I can get a hold of him. When he needs
[1:15:20] me, he can get a hold of me.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of walk with God that we
[1:15:24] want. You see, when God calls you, he
[1:15:27] gives you a place to walk in. Can I take
[1:15:29] just a minute here?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He gives you a place to walk in.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Paul said 1 Corinthians 12:18, he said,
[1:15:37] "But now hath God set the members, every
[1:15:40] one of them, in the body as it hath
[1:15:41] pleased him."
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful scripture? See,
[1:15:45] set means placed. God has placed every
[1:15:48] member in the body as it hath pleased
[1:15:51] him.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; It don't always please us. Oh, that's
[1:15:54] right.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But he sets them in the body as it has
[1:15:57] pleased him.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? Not only did he give
[1:16:00] them a place or a position, but watch
[1:16:02] what Paul says. Paul actually uses the
[1:16:04] natural body to teach this. He talks
[1:16:06] about how some are hands, some are eyes,
[1:16:08] some are nose. Each one of us a
[1:16:10] different part of the natural body, but
[1:16:11] we're not really eyes. We're not really
[1:16:13] eyes of God and hands of God, feet of
[1:16:14] God in a natural sense, but in a
[1:16:16] spiritual sense. So when Paul's talking
[1:16:18] about this, it not talking about we're
[1:16:20] literally that, but what we are when
[1:16:21] he's talking about us being the body of
[1:16:23] Christ and some are hands and some are
[1:16:24] feet, some are nose. What he's actually
[1:16:26] speaking of is some are pastors, some
[1:16:28] are teachers, some are evangelists, some
[1:16:30] are singers, some are worship leaders,
[1:16:32] some are prayer warriors, some some some
[1:16:34] speak in tongues, some worship, some
[1:16:36] some interpret, some prophesy. God, he
[1:16:39] gave these gifts unto men. And so, so
[1:16:40] when he's talking about the members of
[1:16:42] this body, I love how Paul explains this
[1:16:44] because he says even in the natural
[1:16:46] body, some parts of the natural body are
[1:16:49] not as as popular as other parts.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; See that? This is Paul's preaching. He
[1:16:53] says, "So some things aren't aren't as
[1:16:55] as as popular as other parts." He says,
[1:16:56] "So what God does is he gives more honor
[1:16:59] to the parts that are less desirable so
[1:17:01] that there's no schism in the body." In
[1:17:03] other words, that there's no division in
[1:17:04] the body. So that means that don't
[1:17:06] matter where you are in the body of
[1:17:08] Christ. You could be the lowest person
[1:17:09] on the totem pole in your own mind. But
[1:17:12] Paul said, "But God gives more honor to
[1:17:14] the one at the bottom." So there is no
[1:17:16] division. That means the person that you
[1:17:18] would look in the natural eye and say,
[1:17:20] "We're the lowest one in the church."
[1:17:22] Which I don't believe that. But but but
[1:17:23] if you looked at in the natural eye and
[1:17:25] said, "Well, you know, that person
[1:17:26] preaches, so he must be real high. And
[1:17:28] this lady, she just cleans the toilet,
[1:17:30] so she must be real low." But Paul said,
[1:17:31] "No, that ain't it at all." He said,
[1:17:33] "But God gives more honor to the less
[1:17:35] desirable place, so there's no division
[1:17:37] in the body." He, in other words,
[1:17:39] they're all equally valuable to God.
[1:17:42] Isn't that powerful? So, it don't matter
[1:17:44] where God places you. That's why Brother
[1:17:46] Brandham could say, "It wouldn't matter
[1:17:48] to be a door mat in the house of God."
[1:17:50] That's why you could say that because it
[1:17:51] don't matter where God places you in the
[1:17:53] body. It's as equal value as where he
[1:17:55] puts anybody. So, we can come to God and
[1:17:57] trust him and say, "God, you just put me
[1:17:59] where you want me. You just use me where
[1:18:02] you need me
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; and let me just be available.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Come follow me.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Deny yourself.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And follow Christ.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; You see, each one of us, we're not all
[1:18:14] pastors. We're not all all preachers.
[1:18:16] We're not all evangelists. We're but
[1:18:18] we're all equally valuable in the
[1:18:20] kingdom of God.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's the way I believe it 100 100%. I
[1:18:27] believe what Paul taught. I believe
[1:18:28] there ain't a there ain't a little
[1:18:30] person in this church or or in any
[1:18:32] church that's lesser than another one or
[1:18:33] none greater than another. I don't
[1:18:35] believe that one ounce
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; that one's better than this or this one
[1:18:38] or we ought to accommodate this more
[1:18:39] than that. I don't believe that.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So, we're equally valuable
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody turn around to somebody next to
[1:18:48] you and say, "You're valuable.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You're valuable in the kingdom of God."
[1:18:53] Say, "See, we're all equally valuable."
[1:18:55] You say, "Well, brother Matt, I that
[1:18:57] that's a lot, isn't it?"
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a lot? You want to You want
[1:19:01] to have a church that's in a revival?
[1:19:03] You want to have a church that the that
[1:19:05] which we we we're that kind of church.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; You want to have a church that's in a
[1:19:09] revival, the only way to have a revival
[1:19:12] is to catch that revelation that Paul
[1:19:14] preached.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Is that we are all important.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Then you know what it causes you to do?
[1:19:20] It causes you to suffer when your
[1:19:21] neighbor's suffering
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; because they're important. It caused you
[1:19:25] to rejoice when they're rejoicing.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; They they they got a game. Well, I
[1:19:29] didn't get the game, but I'm going to
[1:19:30] rejoice with them because I'm proud that
[1:19:32] they got it.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not jealous because something
[1:19:34] happened to my brother. Jared had 10
[1:19:36] eggs. I'm not mad Jared had 10. God
[1:19:38] bless you. Hope he has 10 more.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; But you don't you're not you're not
[1:19:42] you're not jealous of somebody for for
[1:19:44] God blessing somebody. We want to say,
[1:19:46] "God, I thank you for for blessing my my
[1:19:48] brother." Because if it's a gain to
[1:19:49] them, it's a gain to me. I I want to see
[1:19:51] them grow. I want to see them encourage
[1:19:53] in the Lord. I want to see God
[1:19:54] strengthen them. I I want to see their
[1:19:56] family blessed. I don't want to see
[1:19:58] nobody cursed. I want everybody to be
[1:19:59] blessed of God.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And when they're suffering, I want to
[1:20:03] suffer with them.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see them in trouble.
[1:20:06] That's why you lay awake at night in the
[1:20:08] middle of the night crying out to God
[1:20:09] because somebody's suffering. And you
[1:20:11] can't just Oh, boy.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; And you can't just lay all night and
[1:20:14] watch movies all night and and not worry
[1:20:17] about what's going on with anybody else.
[1:20:18] If you really care about people, you got
[1:20:20] to take some time and think about the
[1:20:21] the suffering of others and spend time
[1:20:23] in prayer and supplication for them.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Because you care.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I suffer when you suffer. We rejoice
[1:20:33] when you rejoice.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; See, we're part of the kingdom of God.
[1:20:36] Paul said God placed us. I get a little
[1:20:39] sidetracked.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; God placed us. says, "And notice how
[1:20:44] that Joshua done whenever Joshua came
[1:20:46] into the promised land, the Bible tells
[1:20:48] us that Joshua divided all of the
[1:20:50] inheritance
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; to the to the children of Israel to each
[1:20:54] tribe of of Israel and said each person
[1:20:57] said they were placed positionally
[1:20:58] exactly the way their Hebrew mothers had
[1:21:00] named them when they came to Palestine.
[1:21:02] Asher and Gad and Efali each one Judah
[1:21:04] they were all placed in their position.
[1:21:05] So what a wonderful picture it gets us
[1:21:07] because it's a type of God's placing in
[1:21:09] the church. So here when Joshua, you
[1:21:11] know, Joshua was a type of the Holy
[1:21:12] Ghost, but I I love this because Joshua,
[1:21:15] the Bible says that Joshua placed them.
[1:21:17] It was Joshua himself that placed him.
[1:21:19] And Joshua being a type of the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost. So who is it that's placing us in
[1:21:22] this age? It's not somebody. It's the
[1:21:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; So we allow the Holy Spirit to place us
[1:21:27] in the body. He said every member, every
[1:21:29] stone, every place, every Christian
[1:21:32] itself, it's always the Holy Ghost
[1:21:34] himself that is placing us in the body.
[1:21:37] And each one of us in our peculiar way
[1:21:39] has a place in the house of God. Isn't
[1:21:42] that right? Every one of us in our own
[1:21:44] peculiar way. You have a place in God's
[1:21:46] house. You know, it got me thinking
[1:21:47] about Solomon whenever they built the
[1:21:48] temple or Solomon's temple. When they
[1:21:50] went out and and to build that great
[1:21:52] temple, you realize they went and got
[1:21:54] stone from all over the world and
[1:21:56] different parts of the world and
[1:21:57] different caves and different mountains
[1:21:59] because this was going to be a grand
[1:22:00] temple before God. And and and when they
[1:22:02] brought the stones into the temple, some
[1:22:04] of them came all the way into Japa, some
[1:22:06] of them came by by wagons, some of them
[1:22:09] came by boats, some of them were shipped
[1:22:10] over. These stones were brought from all
[1:22:12] over to build the temple of God. But let
[1:22:15] me tell you something about those
[1:22:16] stones. Every one of them was a
[1:22:17] different shape. They were a different
[1:22:19] size. They were a different color. If
[1:22:21] you could look at one, they were
[1:22:22] peculiar stones. They were odd stones.
[1:22:25] They all they wouldn't know two of them
[1:22:26] alive, but they were bringing them to
[1:22:28] build the temple of God. And brother
[1:22:31] said that's a very beautiful type of
[1:22:32] today that's what we need a Joshua for.
[1:22:35] He said because the trouble is when
[1:22:36] people come into the promised land is
[1:22:38] the problem is is God wants to raise
[1:22:40] sheep like Ephraim and one man wants to
[1:22:43] raise cattle like another and every man
[1:22:45] wants to be the same. So God gives a man
[1:22:47] a gift of healing everybody wants to be
[1:22:49] a a healer. If God everybody wants a
[1:22:51] gift of healing if God uh gives a man
[1:22:54] one thing the other man wants it. He
[1:22:55] said, "But we are all divided in our own
[1:22:58] position. And we don't all have a gift
[1:23:01] of wisdom. We don't all prophesy. We
[1:23:03] don't all speak with tongues. We are not
[1:23:05] all prophets." But God has set in the
[1:23:07] church. Some that prophesy, some that
[1:23:09] speak in tongues. We want to make and we
[1:23:11] want to make them all speak in tongues.
[1:23:13] See the confusion that men has caused.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; They want to make every preacher the
[1:23:17] same.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I may as well just lay it out there.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; They want to make every preacher the
[1:23:22] same. Well, if they don't preach like
[1:23:23] him, I don't want to hear them because
[1:23:24] they want to make them all the same. But
[1:23:26] they're different stones. They're
[1:23:27] peculiar stones.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; They're they're odd stones. Some of them
[1:23:31] are odd stones. They they look odd the
[1:23:33] way that we look at things. It ain't the
[1:23:34] way it ain't the kind of stone that you
[1:23:36] like to look at.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; We're odd stones. They're peculiar
[1:23:39] stones.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; But they were all used to build the
[1:23:43] temple of God.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Here they come." Said, "God, some
[1:23:48] prophesy, some speak with tongues." He
[1:23:50] said, "Then you can't get nowhere. They
[1:23:51] can't ever overcome. He said, "But when
[1:23:53] each man, listen now, when each man by a
[1:23:57] leader separated them by spiritual
[1:24:00] discernment and place them into the
[1:24:02] body, there they remained and become the
[1:24:04] cream of the earth."
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; When that man, speaking of the Holy
[1:24:08] Ghost, when he could come and
[1:24:09] positionally place us in the body, he
[1:24:11] said, "There they become the cre cream
[1:24:13] of the earth." He said, "God, give us a
[1:24:15] Joshua today. Give us back a Joshua that
[1:24:18] will hold the commission with the word
[1:24:20] of God." They want to place us in our
[1:24:22] position in the body of Christ. Friends,
[1:24:24] let me tell you, there's all kinds of
[1:24:25] stones. They've been placed they've been
[1:24:27] placed by the master builder. Some fit
[1:24:30] Some fit in the corner. Some go to the
[1:24:32] basement. Some have to be a foundation.
[1:24:34] Some you never see. They're hid behind
[1:24:36] sheetrock. Some are some are placed at
[1:24:38] the altar and they're seen all the time.
[1:24:40] They're all different kinds of stone,
[1:24:42] but every stone was needed for the
[1:24:44] temple to be built.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We're all different shapes, different
[1:24:48] sizes. But remember said, "I think down
[1:24:50] through time that God has cut some very
[1:24:52] odd stones." I say, "Amen."
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Down through time, God has cut
[1:24:56] out some very odd stones that we might
[1:24:59] not have understood, but they have their
[1:25:01] place exactly in the temple in the
[1:25:03] building of God." Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; You know, if we could look at each other
[1:25:07] that way,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; if you could look at other brothers and
[1:25:10] you know, instead of being so critical
[1:25:12] sometimes as we get, I don't mean to get
[1:25:13] on you tonight, but
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; but instead of being so critical that we
[1:25:17] are about others that you know that you
[1:25:18] know, God cuts stones of all shapes and
[1:25:20] sizes,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; but they're used to build up this temple
[1:25:23] of worship that God is building.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Well, you can you can you see the very
[1:25:27] picture he's building around the world.
[1:25:29] There's stones here and some some in
[1:25:31] Africa and some in India and some in the
[1:25:33] United States all around the world,
[1:25:35] South America. Here, God is building
[1:25:36] this great spiritual temple. One day,
[1:25:38] brother Mark, when the heavens open,
[1:25:40] they'll rise up and go right into the
[1:25:41] heavens with him.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; One day they I believe that. I believe
[1:25:44] there'll be a meeting in the air. And
[1:25:46] then that great city of God will sit
[1:25:48] down right upon this earth. And they'll
[1:25:50] come right into that city and fellowship
[1:25:52] with their God. It's what God is
[1:25:54] building.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Stones of all shapes and all sizes.
[1:25:58] Let me tell you, there's a lot of odd
[1:26:00] shapes.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you for laughing, sis.
[1:26:04] She's a good lady.
[1:26:08] I didn't mean didn't mean to get you
[1:26:09] tickled. There's a lot of odd shapes.
[1:26:13] There's some odd shaped stones.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Odd sizes. A lot of oddsized stones. I'm
[1:26:19] one of I I picked up Wayne's little
[1:26:22] grandson. Never met the boy in my life.
[1:26:24] He He come over there by me. He got up
[1:26:26] on my lap. I said, 'Well, buddy, it's
[1:26:28] good to meet you. You know, his family,
[1:26:29] well, I I I have seen him, but not since
[1:26:31] he's able to talk and stuff. And uh and
[1:26:33] so he he sat there and looked up at me.
[1:26:35] And after a minute, he just looked at
[1:26:36] me. He reached up and he grabbed my ear
[1:26:38] and he went.
[1:26:40] His mom said, "Yeah, they come in all
[1:26:42] sizes, don't thank you." Yeah.
[1:26:46] They come in all shapes and sizes.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; They're all different stones. We're all
[1:26:51] different. But let me tell you something
[1:26:52] about these stones. Although we're all
[1:26:55] different, but there is some things that
[1:26:57] all of the stones have in common.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get all into it,
[1:27:00] but let me tell you what Peter said. All
[1:27:02] these stones are lively stones.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; None of them are dead weight. None of
[1:27:06] them are useless. None of them are are
[1:27:08] wasted. Peter said, "You as lively
[1:27:10] stones are built up a spiritual house, a
[1:27:12] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:27:15] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:27:18] Christ." So it don't matter what stone
[1:27:20] you are. If you're a foundational stone,
[1:27:21] if you're a cornerstone, if you're a
[1:27:23] headstone, it don't matter what stone
[1:27:25] you are. We are all lively stones used
[1:27:27] in God's spiritual house to offer a
[1:27:30] spiritual sacrifice unto God. Friends,
[1:27:32] let me tell you, God is building a place
[1:27:34] of spiritual worship. He's building a
[1:27:37] church that he could have every every
[1:27:38] stone. Let me tell you, he's went all
[1:27:40] over this world to gather stones. He's
[1:27:42] went down into bar rooms. He's went down
[1:27:45] into old school houses. He's went down
[1:27:47] into some slaughter house of the world.
[1:27:49] And he's dug out stones. He's the best
[1:27:51] miner that there ever was. He's dug in
[1:27:53] the middle of caves. He's tore down
[1:27:55] mountains to get the some. He's went to
[1:27:57] the bottom of the sea. He'll go wherever
[1:27:59] he has to to find every predestinated
[1:28:02] stone of God. And he's brought them into
[1:28:04] the house of God to be a lively stone to
[1:28:07] build up a temple of God, a spiritual
[1:28:09] temple to bring a sacrifice unto him.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; These are God's tones. We're lively
[1:28:14] stones. Let me tell you friends, I'm not
[1:28:16] talking about being lively just to make
[1:28:18] a bunch of noise. That's what
[1:28:19] Pentecostalism is. I'm not talking about
[1:28:21] just making a bunch of noise. That don't
[1:28:22] save anybody. But let me tell you, if
[1:28:24] you ever come alive, all of a sudden,
[1:28:26] you can't help but making some noise.
[1:28:28] There's something in you that changes in
[1:28:30] you because God has awakened you. You've
[1:28:33] been quickened unto life.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you can shout all
[1:28:37] you want to. You can, you know, you say,
[1:28:39] "Well, shouting and dancing that make
[1:28:40] that don't make you saved." Let me tell
[1:28:41] you the difference between shouting and
[1:28:43] dancing and speaking in tongues and
[1:28:44] running the aisles and all this stuff
[1:28:46] that Pentecost does and and and the and
[1:28:48] people don't want to do because they
[1:28:49] don't want to be Pentecostal. But
[1:28:51] there's a difference whenever you shout.
[1:28:53] Can I have a minute?
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; There's a difference when you shout and
[1:28:55] praise God and dance on the altar and
[1:28:58] all. that whenever you have an altar
[1:29:00] that is sanctified before God,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; the difference is found in the Old
[1:29:04] Testament when God is dealing with the
[1:29:05] priest and he says before you make a
[1:29:07] sacrifice before me, he said you shall
[1:29:09] anoint the altar and sanctify the altar
[1:29:12] and make an atonement for the altar for
[1:29:15] the altar must be holy.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And then he said, whenever the altar is
[1:29:20] holy, then whatsoever touches the altar
[1:29:22] shall be holy.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Well, where is that altar today?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That altar is your heart. Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Where is that altar today? That altars
[1:29:30] your heart.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; So here in the Old Testament, you had to
[1:29:33] sanctify an altar before that you could
[1:29:35] offer a sacrifice if you wanted God to
[1:29:37] accept it. You see why running don't do
[1:29:38] it and emotion don't do it and shouting
[1:29:40] don't do it. But let me tell you what
[1:29:42] happens when the Bible if the altar is
[1:29:43] your heart, the Bible says, but what
[1:29:44] happened whenever the altar got
[1:29:46] sanctified, then whatever touched the
[1:29:49] altar became holy. So you show me a
[1:29:52] person with a sanctified heart, I don't
[1:29:54] care if they shout, it's a holy shout.
[1:29:57] If they raise their hand, it's a holy
[1:29:58] hand. If they're stomping and shouting
[1:30:00] and speaking in tongues and dancing in
[1:30:02] the spirit, it's holy unto God because
[1:30:05] whatever touch the altar becomes holy
[1:30:07] because it's from a sanctified heart.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And God has called us to sanctify the
[1:30:13] altar of God. Friends, once the altar
[1:30:15] sanctified, you go on and have church.
[1:30:17] Don't you hold back no more. The altar's
[1:30:19] sanctified. You see why Satan wants you
[1:30:21] to have so much condemnation. You see
[1:30:22] why he reminds you of the past. You see
[1:30:24] why he tempts you. He's trying to He's
[1:30:26] trying to keep you out of this spiritual
[1:30:28] place with God. He don't want you to
[1:30:29] deny yourself. He certainly don't want
[1:30:31] you to follow Christ. He don't want you
[1:30:33] to rapture out of this world. He wants
[1:30:35] you to be down that same pit he's in.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; So, he brings you down and brings all
[1:30:39] this on you so that you can't enter into
[1:30:41] this place with God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; He's dragging you down all all this and
[1:30:46] bringing all this unbelief and all this
[1:30:47] stuff on you. Why? Because he wants you
[1:30:49] not to be able to feel free to worship.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; You know what you do? You repent.
[1:30:54] You sanctify the altar.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You give your heart to God and you turn
[1:30:58] around and look the devil in the eye and
[1:30:59] said, "I can show you the place where I
[1:31:01] gave my life to God."
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I can show you the place where I walked
[1:31:04] away from this world. I got a right to
[1:31:06] raise my hand.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't you realize that we
[1:31:08] there's places in this world you can't
[1:31:10] do that. You We can't go out publicly
[1:31:12] and lift our hand. But but right here, I
[1:31:13] say, "I have a right to raise my hand. I
[1:31:16] have a right to dance in the spirit. I
[1:31:17] have a right to shout. I have a right to
[1:31:19] praise God. I have a right to sing. I've
[1:31:22] got a right to preach the gospel.
[1:31:25] It don't come from a man. It came from
[1:31:27] God.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And God accepts it as a spiritual
[1:31:30] sacrifice.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; When it comes from a sanctified altar,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; some music players want to come.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; From an altar most holy.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; From an altar most holy comes a holy
[1:31:41] worship.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Go ahead and
[1:31:44] shout.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; It's an altar most holy.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and dance. It's an altar most
[1:31:50] holy. Don't be ashamed of it. Don't be
[1:31:52] ashamed of dancing in the spirit. It's
[1:31:53] an altar most holy.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed ashamed of praising
[1:31:56] God. It's an altar most holy. You know
[1:31:58] the altar.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; No man knows what altar what what what
[1:32:02] uh whether your altar was sanctified.
[1:32:04] You know that
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I sanctified it before God.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; An altar most holy brings holy worship.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; It's your right to worship God. How many
[1:32:14] believe that?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It's your right to worship God.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this tonight in closing.
[1:32:21] What if they wouldn't have accepted the
[1:32:23] place where Joshua gave them to inhabit?
[1:32:28] Can you imagine? Isn't that the way it
[1:32:29] is sometimes in the flesh? I'm not I'm
[1:32:32] I'm getting about halfway through and
[1:32:34] we'll pick it up Sunday, but you you can
[1:32:36] imagine what it would be like. Said,
[1:32:38] "Well, I don't I don't want that
[1:32:39] portion. I want this portion."
[1:32:42] says, "So the key to following the Holy
[1:32:45] Spirit was to accept the lot that was
[1:32:49] given to you by the Holy Spirit."
[1:32:52] That's what it means to deny yourself.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I know it's a simple message,
[1:32:58] but I'm talking about bringing somebody
[1:33:00] out of carnality and into a real place
[1:33:04] of spiritual worship,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; a real place of fellowship with God.
[1:33:10] There's some key things.
[1:33:12] I accept what you made me. I accept
[1:33:16] where you've placed me. I'm not looking.
[1:33:19] See how easy it is? Satan wants you so
[1:33:22] unsatisfied. He can't help you looking
[1:33:24] around the internet everywhere trying to
[1:33:26] find something. He wants you unsatisfied
[1:33:28] with where you are.
[1:33:31] But if God could come tonight and tell
[1:33:32] you one thing, say, "But I brought you
[1:33:34] to this place.
[1:33:37] I need you in this place.
[1:33:39] So let me use you in this place.
[1:33:43] Deny yourself
[1:33:45] and take up your cross and follow me. Do
[1:33:48] you believe the Holy Ghost can still
[1:33:49] speak to you?
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know anything else that speaks
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; that's truth.
[1:33:57] We can sit and reason and try to figure
[1:33:58] and make things work out, but brother
[1:34:00] Mark, there's no other place to find
[1:34:02] truth, but the devil comes on the
[1:34:04] outside. You know how I know that it's
[1:34:05] true? Cuz Satan tells you that it ain't.
[1:34:09] The devil comes on the outside and he
[1:34:10] says, "Well, you're not being used.
[1:34:14] They don't really like you. They don't.
[1:34:16] Nobody even pays attention to you. You
[1:34:18] don't you don't really have a real
[1:34:20] play." So So the devil says all of that.
[1:34:21] What is he doing? It makes you feel like
[1:34:24] you're not valuable. And watch
[1:34:26] immediately what it does. Can I can I
[1:34:27] hit a spirit? Watch immediately what it
[1:34:30] does. It immediately brings what Paul
[1:34:32] was trying to stop. It immediately
[1:34:34] brings division between you and other
[1:34:36] believers.
[1:34:37] Paul said, "If we recognize that there
[1:34:39] is no schism in the body, there's no
[1:34:40] division." Immediately, when Satan gets
[1:34:43] your heart down that path, then there's
[1:34:45] division. You know what? They don't
[1:34:47] really don't really care much about me
[1:34:49] anyway. Yeah, I got other things to do
[1:34:51] today anyway. Immediately becomes
[1:34:54] divisive. It separates fellowship,
[1:34:56] separates. Isn't it true? If you felt
[1:34:58] like somebody don't like you, you don't
[1:35:00] want to hang out with them.
[1:35:02] Say, so what we do, we just go like them
[1:35:04] the more. make sure they don't feel that
[1:35:06] way. Friends, I don't believe in having
[1:35:09] five churches in one church. I don't
[1:35:10] believe that. I believe we're all one
[1:35:12] body in many churches, many places of
[1:35:16] fellowship. We're all one body. And I
[1:35:19] don't believe as a pastor that you just
[1:35:20] sit back and allow that to happen in the
[1:35:22] church. I don't believe that. I believe
[1:35:23] I have a a a right, not only a right, I
[1:35:25] believe I have an obligation as a pastor
[1:35:28] to combat that spirit and say that you
[1:35:30] should not have things between one
[1:35:31] another. You should be able to go to
[1:35:33] your brother and love them and help him
[1:35:35] and be an encouragement to them. And
[1:35:37] when you feel bad about somebody, you
[1:35:38] ought to be able to go to him and say,
[1:35:39] "Brother, I'm sorry I felt that way."
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I know people don't like this is old
[1:35:42] style preaching.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; But if you want to have a real revival,
[1:35:46] we're about to have a meeting next week.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; If you want to have a real revival, let
[1:35:50] me tell you how to get there. Don't wait
[1:35:51] until Wednesday of next week to start
[1:35:54] getting prepared for revival or a move
[1:35:57] of God in the meeting. You start doing
[1:35:58] that right now.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Getting prepared in your heart. all
[1:36:02] they're we're doing all kinds of things
[1:36:03] to prepare the tent, prepare the sound,
[1:36:06] prepare all that in the natural, but
[1:36:09] what can we do spiritually to be
[1:36:10] prepared for a real move of God? We're
[1:36:14] hosting this meeting. I want people to
[1:36:16] be able to come in and and be able to
[1:36:18] get something from God. people that have
[1:36:20] real need needs, sicknesses, cancers,
[1:36:22] things that people have in their their
[1:36:24] body and in their life that they could
[1:36:25] come to this place and they can find
[1:36:27] their healing. They can find direction
[1:36:29] from God. They can hear from God. That's
[1:36:32] what we're creating. And God is using
[1:36:34] you
[1:36:37] stones.
[1:36:38] God is using you stones to do that very
[1:36:41] thing. Won't you stand to your feet
[1:36:43] tonight?
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:47] I don't believe the spirit of division.
[1:36:48] I think the devil's a liar. Do you
[1:36:50] believe that tonight? Somebody say, "The
[1:36:52] devil's a liar."
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; People get caught up there. They get
[1:36:57] caught out, but not in. God called you
[1:37:00] out of a lot of things, but don't get
[1:37:02] caught out and not enter in. He brought
[1:37:05] you here. Every one of us have a
[1:37:06] different testimony. Every stone come
[1:37:09] from a different place. We all come from
[1:37:11] something. But go ahead and enter in.
[1:37:14] Deny yourself. You know, you had to make
[1:37:17] give up a little bit of sleep. You had
[1:37:18] to give up a little bit of time to get
[1:37:20] into prayer and enter in before a
[1:37:22] service. You you had to give up some
[1:37:24] things. You had to deny your flesh
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; to enter in this place. But I wonder how
[1:37:28] many as we bow our heads, you you could
[1:37:31] raise your hands, say, "Brother Matt, I
[1:37:32] want to do that." Here we got these
[1:37:33] meetings coming up and I want to be able
[1:37:35] to dedicate some time to allow God to be
[1:37:38] able to use me wherever he can use me.
[1:37:40] If he needs me to sing, I'll sing. If I
[1:37:41] need if I need to uh wash something,
[1:37:43] I'll wash some. If I need to hammer
[1:37:44] something, I'll hammer. If I if I need
[1:37:46] to preach, I'll preach. Lord, whatever
[1:37:48] you need me to do, Lord, let's just be a
[1:37:50] stone that is able to be used in the
[1:37:52] master's hand. Gracious heavenly father,
[1:37:55] Lord, we are so thankful for your
[1:37:56] presence here tonight, Lord. God, we
[1:37:59] just thank you, Lord. God, that you
[1:38:02] would be so mindful of us. You know what
[1:38:04] we have need of. And God, a spiritual
[1:38:06] church, Lord, you're calling us out of
[1:38:08] this world and into a walk with you,
[1:38:11] God. It's our desire to be so close to
[1:38:13] you, Lord, not to be caught up in this
[1:38:16] world and the things of this world. God,
[1:38:18] we just ask you, Lord, as we take this
[1:38:21] as a time, Lord, as our hearts begin to
[1:38:23] be prepared. And Lord, we just know that
[1:38:26] there's so many things that you have
[1:38:27] prepared for us and have in store. And
[1:38:30] God, I pray that you would bless this
[1:38:32] church, Lord. I pray, God, that you
[1:38:33] would help them, God. Each one, Lord,
[1:38:35] that you would give them a blessing for
[1:38:37] the effort that they have to put forth,
[1:38:39] God, to bring this kind of a meeting,
[1:38:41] God. May you just help each one. Give
[1:38:43] them strength and encouragement today.
[1:38:45] God, if there's something in any life,
[1:38:47] Lord, I pray that your hand of mercy
[1:38:49] would be upon us, Lord. May we give it
[1:38:51] to you tonight, God. May we surrender,
[1:38:53] Lord, every spirit, Lord, anything
[1:38:55] that's unlike you, God. May we have
[1:38:57] nothing wrong in our spirit, Lord. God,
[1:39:00] just be surrendered that you can use us,
[1:39:02] Lord. We thank you for it now in Jesus
[1:39:05] name we pray.
