[29:43] praises. Everybody will be happy over
[29:48] there.
[29:50] Well, how many is happy here this
[29:52] morning? Oh, and his mercy's new every
[29:55] morning. How many's glad to be here this
[29:57] morning? Hallelujah. It's good to be in
[29:59] his presence and good to know my God is
[30:02] real and he's alive and we're not
[30:05] serving a dead God somewhere. We're
[30:07] serving a powerful living God that's
[30:10] present right here with us. Amen. We're
[30:12] more than conquerors through Christ
[30:15] Jesus. Amen. That pay the debt that we
[30:18] owed. Ain't you thankful for it this
[30:20] morning? Amen. Well, God bless you. We
[30:23] got a prayer [music] request this
[30:24] morning. And I know there's probably
[30:26] many needs among us.
[30:28] So we'll remember that this morning too.
[30:31] Says prayer request for Steven Allen. We
[30:33] just want to remember him this morning.
[30:35] And also McKenzie called this morning my
[30:38] [music] niece and said just continue to
[30:41] pray for my sister April and she's still
[30:43] in the hospital [music]
[30:45] seeing some kinds of improvement but
[30:48] just praying that the Lord will give her
[30:50] strength and lift her up as well. My
[30:52] grandson Ralphie Jesse's at home sick
[30:54] this [music] morning. So, let's just
[30:55] remember him and the family. Just so a
[30:58] lot of sickness. There's a lot of people
[31:00] gone this morning. Just just seemed like
[31:02] the sickness is hitting families. I know
[31:05] it's good to have [music] kind of Tim
[31:06] back. I know they've been gone few
[31:08] services with sickness. And it's good to
[31:10] have my [music] buddy, brother David
[31:12] back there this morning. It's good to
[31:13] see him and Lord touching [music] him.
[31:16] He says he's maybe not ready to run a
[31:18] race this morning, but I say he is.
[31:22] Greater is he that's in him [music] than
[31:23] he that's in the world. I mean, you
[31:25] believe it or you don't. How many
[31:27] believers we have in the house this
[31:28] morning? Well, God bless you. Just lift
[31:30] your hands if you got a need upon your
[31:32] heart. And [music] remember our pastor,
[31:34] he's been laboring and excited back
[31:37] there to bring the word of life to us.
[31:39] And I hope [music] we come with that
[31:41] same excitement this morning cuz I know
[31:43] one thing, if you're expecting something
[31:46] from God, God's going to meet that
[31:48] expectation this morning. That's the
[31:50] kind of God we serve. Let's just pray in
[31:52] our own way. Lord Jesus, [music] we
[31:54] thank you, Lord, for this opportunity
[31:56] that you've given us, Lord, to worship
[31:58] you in this tabernacle this morning,
[32:01] Lord God, as our precious brother begin
[32:04] to lead us in songs, [music] Lord. We
[32:06] felt your presence drop down among us,
[32:08] Lord. Lord, prepare in our hearts for
[32:11] the coming seed, Lord God, that's going
[32:13] to come forth, the word of the bread of
[32:15] life, Lord God. I pray, Lord God, that
[32:18] we glean as Ruth did behind the reapers,
[32:21] Lord God, this morning. Glean with
[32:23] everything in us, Lord, because we're in
[32:26] a journey. We're we're in a battle,
[32:28] Lord. We know the war has already been
[32:30] won, but we're right in the midst of a
[32:31] battle, Lord God. The hands out stretch
[32:34] that day at Calvary [music] is letting
[32:36] us know no matter what is going on
[32:38] around us, whatever circumstances we may
[32:41] be facing in life does not dictate if
[32:44] we're winning or losing. Lord, we look
[32:46] back to that day at Calvary. What
[32:48] Brother R said their hands was
[32:49] outstretched and they nailed them up to
[32:52] let us know, Lord, we're on the winning
[32:54] side. We're not defeated. We're more
[32:56] than conquerors. Lord God, we rallied
[32:59] around that word this morning. Lord,
[33:01] many sick and bod, Lord God. Lord, that
[33:04] my sister still in the hospital. We pray
[33:06] for her and McKenzie and the family,
[33:08] Lord. We pray, Lord God, for Stephen
[33:10] Allen this morning, Lord, my grandson,
[33:13] Robbie Jesse, Lord, we pray, Lord God,
[33:15] that you'd touch his body this morning.
[33:17] Many hands went up this morning in this
[33:20] tabernacle, Lord God. Lord, I know we
[33:23] battle, Lord God. There's a there's a
[33:26] great war that's going on. The raging of
[33:29] of hell against the be against the bride
[33:33] of Jesus Christ.
[33:36] Oh, but Lord, we're not going to listen
[33:38] to a backsliding prophet. Lord, Lord, we
[33:41] have spiritual food in due season. When
[33:44] Jonathan went down to the battle and the
[33:46] battle was raging,
[33:49] oh, he was told by the adversaries and
[33:52] not to eat, but Lord, there was
[33:54] spiritual honey in due season. He took
[33:57] his rod, he dipped it down into the
[33:59] honey, and he drew strength for the
[34:02] journey and the battle. Lord, we're in a
[34:04] great battle this morning. Lord, let us
[34:06] take our rods this morning and dip it
[34:09] down to into your anointing, honey, but
[34:12] be predestinated for such a time as
[34:14] this, Lord, and let us draw strength for
[34:17] the journey this morning. We pray, Lord,
[34:21] that you come in a special way. Anoint
[34:23] our pastor. He brings the word of life
[34:25] to us in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:29] And the bride says, "Oh, don't you love
[34:32] him?" Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[34:34] of praise this morning?
[34:38] Sing I bless your name
[34:42] in prison chains [singing]
[34:49] with bleeding [singing and music]
[34:51] stripes.
[34:56] Oh, Paul in silence.
[35:02] They pray that [singing] night
[35:09] in their pain.
[35:15] Oh, they begin to sing. [music]
[35:23] Oh, listen now.
[35:29] and they were free.
[35:35] Oh, I bless your name. Is [music] that
[35:38] why you come this morning? As we get
[35:41] ready for the pastor to come, don't you
[35:42] just slip your hands to him and sing
[35:45] this song unto the Lord this morning?
[35:50] Oh, he's still coming down and
[35:51] inhabiting [singing] your praise and
[35:52] worship this morning.
[35:55] Oh, I give you [singing]
[35:58] praise.
[36:00] [music]

[36:08] the truth, the way. [music]
[36:15] I bless your name.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, submit that hour
[36:29] to make that hour.
[36:36] If you should find
[36:42] you're in a prison,
[36:47] not in your soul, but in your mind.
[36:51] [music]
[36:55] Oh, reach and pray.
[37:01] Yes, Lord. Oh, divide
[37:04] those [music] sh
[37:09] And they will fall
[37:15] in Jesus
[37:18] name all praise him like you love him
[37:20] this morning.
[37:22] I bless your name. [music]
[37:29] I bless your name.
[37:35] Oh, I give you honor.
[37:42] Oh, I give you praise.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are the life,
[37:55] the [singing] truth, the way.
[38:03] I some midnight hour [music] one more
[38:06] time.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Submit
[38:17] not our word. [singing]
[38:20] Oh yes.
[38:22] If you should find, [singing]
[38:29] you're in a prison. [music]
[38:35] Oh, in [singing]
[38:37] your mind.
[38:40] Oh yes. Oh, reach out and praise.
[38:47] Hallelujah. defy those chains
[38:55] and they will [singing] fall
[39:01] in Jesus
[39:03] name.

[39:12] [singing]
[39:14] I bless your [music] name. name.
[39:21] Lord, I [music and singing] give you
[39:23] honor.
[39:27] Yes, I give
[39:29] you praise.
[39:34] For you [singing and music] are the
[39:36] life,
[39:41] the truth, the way. [music]
[39:47] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[39:48] &gt;&gt; I bless your [music] name.
[39:53] Yes, my Lord. I bless your [singing]
[39:57] name.
[40:01] Oh, I [singing] bless your name.
[40:06] My Lord, I bless your name.
[40:11] [singing and music]
[40:12] How many can do that from your heart
[40:13] this morning? Say, "Lord, I'm I'm not
[40:16] worthy, but you're worthy. And I just
[40:18] come to give you glory this morning, to
[40:21] be thankful for all that you've done for
[40:23] me. Lord, you've never failed me, never
[40:25] forsake me. Lord, I just want to come to
[40:27] worship you and give my all to you,
[40:29] Lord, to make you welcome in this place
[40:31] this [music] morning. You are my life,
[40:35] the truth.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; You're the way.
[40:42] I bless your name.
[40:47] Yes, my [singing and music] Lord.
[40:49] I bless your name. Won't you give the
[40:53] Lord a hand clap of praise this morning?
[40:56] For you're worthy of it all,
[41:00] [singing]
[41:02] isn't he though? You're worthy of it
[41:05] all.
[41:11] For [singing] from you are all things.
[41:14] To you are all things
[41:18] and you deserve the glory. [singing]
[41:25] &gt;&gt; You're worthy of it all. [music]
[41:29] [singing]
[41:31] Yes, you're worthy [music] of it all.
[41:39] From [singing and music] you are all
[41:41] things.
[41:42] To you are all things
[41:46] and you deserve the glory.
[41:48] [singing and music]
[41:50] Amen. Isn't he worthy this morning? How
[41:52] many love the Lord this morning? Amen.
[41:55] Has he been good to you? Amen. How many
[41:57] has something to thank God for? Amen. We
[42:00] [music] just look around the building
[42:01] and so thankful for all that God has
[42:04] done for us. Amen. just had a wonderful
[42:08] time. Hope you enjoyed the uh holidays
[42:10] and Thanksgiving holiday [music] and
[42:12] Amen. just to take the time to reflect
[42:14] on all that God has done for us. And you
[42:17] know, there's some some things I want to
[42:19] ask when I get over on the other side,
[42:21] you know, and you know, one of them is
[42:22] why do I feel so bad after Thanksgiving,
[42:25] such a good holiday, and I felt so bad
[42:27] the next day. And no, it was certainly
[42:30] had a a wonderful time with family and
[42:33] friends. I know many are still traveling
[42:36] in different places. So, just want to
[42:37] pray uh that God would be with them and
[42:41] and we're certainly thankful of all that
[42:43] God does for us. Amen. And and I believe
[42:46] that's what that holiday is about. And
[42:49] uh you know that we even have a place if
[42:51] you ever been done many missionary
[42:53] trips. You'll go to many places that you
[42:55] don't have the freedom uh to worship as
[42:58] we do or to raise a family, have the
[43:00] opportunity
[43:02] to go and and to work the way you do and
[43:05] provide for your family and and as sad
[43:08] as it sounds, not to make a sad note,
[43:11] but even the opportunity to have a house
[43:13] to live in or a roof over your
[43:14] children's head. And you know, I've been
[43:16] in areas where [music] people that are
[43:19] just as valuable as you are and no
[43:22] difference in the value of a human
[43:24] being, one of another, but by the
[43:26] thousands live on the streets that don't
[43:28] even have a roof to put over their head.
[43:29] And I thought, isn't it something that
[43:31] that that [music] u when in that kind of
[43:34] a place that they value different
[43:36] things, what's important to them is
[43:37] different uh than what's important to to
[43:40] some other people. And I thought, you
[43:42] know, uh I pray that our that what is
[43:45] [music] valuable to us, uh is not our
[43:47] possessions or not things that we can
[43:49] buy with money, uh but it's the it's the
[43:52] [music] life that we can have with Jesus
[43:54] Christ. Amen. And and so I just thank
[43:57] God for that this morning and all that
[43:59] he's done for us and to us and give to
[44:02] us. And we're certainly not worthy, but
[44:05] uh but we certainly are thankful. We
[44:07] never want to be ungrateful for what God
[44:09] does for us. So, we just love the Lord
[44:12] this morning. May you just bow our heads
[44:14] just a moment before we open the word.
[44:16] And you know, if you have something
[44:18] special on your heart you'd like the
[44:19] Lord to do uh this morning or maybe you
[44:22] just need uh some direction, I believe
[44:24] that God is certainly more than able.
[44:26] And so, won't we just call upon him and
[44:28] ask him to come and have his way. This
[44:30] is our service uh back. We just want to
[44:32] open the door and allow the atmosphere
[44:34] of the Holy Ghost uh to come through
[44:36] this room and and to reside here. So,
[44:38] let's just pray this morning. and
[44:40] gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[44:42] privileged that we are, Lord, to stand
[44:44] in your presence this morning, Lord,
[44:46] know in the weakness of our our flesh,
[44:49] Lord, and but God, here we stand, Lord,
[44:52] as a needy people, Lord, we come before
[44:55] thy throne of mercy and grace. And Lord,
[44:58] knowing that there are many things,
[44:59] Lord, that we have need of, Lord,
[45:01] there's many hands that's raised this
[45:03] morning. And God, we just ask you, Lord,
[45:05] that you would have your way in this
[45:07] service. Lord, I pray [music] that the
[45:09] something that would be said, Lord, that
[45:10] would be edifying to the body of Christ.
[45:12] Lord, we just ask that you would help us
[45:14] to get out of the way, Lord, the hearer
[45:16] and the speaker this morning, Lord, that
[45:18] you would come and speak to your
[45:20] children, God. May we not hinder a move
[45:22] of God, Lord. May there not be anything
[45:24] in our life, Lord, that would hinder
[45:25] you. But God, make we just surrender to
[45:28] you once again, Lord. Allow you to have
[45:30] liberty, Lord. We pray you'd forgive us
[45:32] of our sins and failures and mistakes of
[45:35] this flesh, Lord. and we just allow you
[45:36] to to come and move in a special way.
[45:39] Lord, we pray you'd anoint this word and
[45:40] bring it to life. We ask in Jesus name
[45:43] we pray. Amen. Amen. We just want to
[45:46] invite you to the scripture to the
[45:48] Hebrews the 11th chapter. And I'm going
[45:50] to read one uh portion of scripture.
[45:53] Hebrews the 11th chapter uh in the first
[45:56] verse. Now uh this uh chapter is of
[46:00] course we know to be the the heroes of
[46:03] faith. many of us have spoke on it or
[46:06] preached out of it. And so it's always
[46:09] speaking of the faith that is among the
[46:11] believers all the way, you know, Paul
[46:13] took the believers all the way from uh
[46:15] the beginning of Israel uh all the way
[46:18] down to to those that were uh that were
[46:21] stoned and saw us under and you know
[46:23] talked about their great faith. And uh
[46:25] but I like how Paul begins this
[46:27] scripture. He says, "Now faith is the
[46:29] substance of things hoped for." So
[46:31] immediately he brings it and makes it a
[46:33] reality. He said, "It's the substance of
[46:36] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[46:38] not seen. For by it the elders obtained
[46:40] a good report. Through faith we
[46:42] understand that the worlds," somebody
[46:45] say worlds, the worlds were framed by
[46:48] the word of God, so that things which
[46:50] are seen were not made of things which
[46:53] do appear. And we'll just ask the Lord
[46:55] to add his blessing to the reading of
[46:57] the word. And as you take your seats
[46:59] this morning, I would like to speak on a
[47:02] dimensional victory. A dimensional
[47:05] victory. You know, I was thinking about
[47:07] our natural existence. And you realize
[47:09] that we live uh within the boundaries of
[47:12] this natural world. And we uh the
[47:14] boundaries of this flesh and what this
[47:16] natural world offers and uh what was
[47:19] created in the natural. And you know,
[47:21] the Bible is filled with scriptures. We
[47:23] won't read them this morning, but filled
[47:24] with scriptures that speak of this
[47:26] natural man and the challenges that we
[47:28] face uh in this in this natural body and
[47:31] how that uh whether they be internal or
[47:34] external challenges, there's challenges
[47:36] that we face. It could be uh the
[47:38] emotional challenge or frustration or
[47:40] pressures or heartaches or griefs. And
[47:42] all of these things are internal
[47:44] challenges that every man or every woman
[47:46] that's ever born of a man or born of a
[47:48] woman that that she uh uh that that they
[47:50] they face those same things. But also,
[47:53] not only do we face internal challenges,
[47:55] but external all uh that we have
[47:57] challenges. We're challenged by sickness
[47:59] and disease and uh uh pains in our
[48:02] flesh, things that you can feel. And uh
[48:05] so there there there's internal and
[48:07] there's physical challenges that we
[48:08] have. But the Bible Bible also tells us
[48:10] that uh this natural man or this natural
[48:13] world is affected by another world or an
[48:17] unseen world. And see this unseen world,
[48:19] it's a spiritual world. We're made up of
[48:21] uh we're a triune being. We're made up
[48:23] of body, soul, and spirit. And and so we
[48:26] realize that this natural body is in
[48:28] contact with natural things, but our but
[48:30] the spiritual man is what contacts
[48:32] spiritual things. And so, uh God has
[48:35] given us the ability to interact with
[48:37] another world. And you know, uh that
[48:39] that spiritual world, not all things are
[48:41] good. Not just because you talk about a
[48:42] spiritual world don't mean it's all good
[48:44] or or all spirits are good or that that
[48:46] that this unseen world that everything's
[48:48] good. Uh uh it's certainly filled with
[48:50] evil spirits and darkness and demonic
[48:53] spirits and uh but you know when you
[48:55] think about God whenever he created man
[48:57] when God created man he made a man in
[49:00] order to live. The Bible says from the
[49:01] very moment that God breathed life into
[49:03] the first man that he created and he
[49:05] formed out of the dust of the ground.
[49:07] The Bible says man became a living soul.
[49:10] And so uh from that time it showed us
[49:12] that man was meant to live. That's why
[49:15] the soul of a man thirsts for life.
[49:17] That's why he sows for or he thirsts for
[49:19] eternal life because man was created by
[49:22] God to be a living soul. And so we
[49:24] thirst for life. We long to be alive.
[49:26] The most precious thing we have is life.
[49:28] That's why grief is such a painful thing
[49:30] is because it it seems to be the absence
[49:33] of life in this carnal world or this
[49:35] natural world. And so uh we long to be
[49:37] alive. And ever every ever since that
[49:39] God has ever made a man to live, Satan
[49:43] has done everything he can to satisfy
[49:45] that hunger with something else. See, we
[49:47] thirsting for life and we're we're
[49:49] thirsting for that eternal life. We're
[49:50] thirsting for living. And so, Satan has
[49:52] done everything to satisfy it with other
[49:54] things. But says, see how Satan, he
[49:56] tries to pervert this satisfying of the
[49:58] soul or that thirst for the soul. He
[50:00] tries to give you everything to satisfy
[50:02] it. And so, he's so deceitful in these
[50:05] days of perversion. This is a perverted
[50:08] world. It's a perverted race. It's a
[50:09] perverted people. Everything is
[50:11] perverted. And he has perverted so
[50:13] gradual until it's become the most
[50:15] deceitful age that any human being has
[50:18] ever lived in. It's more deceitful than
[50:20] it ever was. How many can you say amen?
[50:22] This is the most deceitful age that has
[50:24] ever been. It's the most deceitful age
[50:26] that any man has ever lived in. And in
[50:28] this deceiving age, the thirst of a
[50:30] man's soul has been quenched with things
[50:32] of the world. It's been quenched with
[50:34] things from the outside or quenched with
[50:36] things of the natural world. That's why
[50:38] there's such a draw in the natural world
[50:40] because Satan is trying to quench that
[50:42] thirst for life or quench that thirst
[50:44] for for that other world or that other
[50:47] realm with things of this natural life.
[50:48] And so, because it's became so quenched,
[50:51] now man's search for God or eternal life
[50:54] has been put off. It's been put as a
[50:56] back burner. It's it's something that
[50:58] that quench has been stayed by things of
[51:00] the world. That's why Isaiah would talk
[51:02] about this world in this age. He said,
[51:03] "Darkness shall cover the earth and
[51:06] gross darkness the people." He said,
[51:07] "But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and
[51:10] his glory shall be seen upon thee, and
[51:12] even the Gentiles shall come to thy
[51:15] light." So here Isaiah would tell us
[51:16] that there's coming an age that would be
[51:18] so dark. It would come an age that that
[51:20] even spiritual blindness would be upon
[51:22] the people. But Peter said, but whenever
[51:25] it come to this age, he said, there will
[51:26] be a chosen people. He said, "For God
[51:29] has calling you out of darkness and into
[51:31] this marvelous light." So here we're
[51:33] living in this world, in this unseen
[51:35] world. We're searching for a reality.
[51:37] We're searching uh for something are
[51:40] being called back to this place that God
[51:42] has created us from. And there's
[51:43] something in us that is calling us or
[51:45] bringing us into another realm. And
[51:47] friends, let me tell you that call is to
[51:49] bring you out of the state that you're
[51:51] in into another state. You say, "Well,
[51:53] what state is that?" This is what Paul
[51:55] is speaking of in Hebrews 11 when he
[51:58] would start this chapter. He's
[51:59] introducing what faith does to a
[52:01] believer. In other words, he's showing
[52:03] you how to access or enter in to another
[52:06] world that you can't see with your
[52:07] natural eye. Paul said through faith, we
[52:09] understand that the worlds were framed
[52:11] by the word of God. Now, we know he
[52:13] wasn't talking about two earths or three
[52:15] earths there. There's not a bunch of
[52:17] earths out there. But when he said
[52:19] worlds, which was a plural word, he was
[52:21] actually speaking of a world that you
[52:23] can see and a world that you can't see.
[52:25] So he said these worlds were were were
[52:28] created or they were framed by the word
[52:29] of God. There's a seen world and there's
[52:31] an unseen world. And then Paul said,
[52:33] "But the things which are seen were not
[52:35] made by things which do appear." Isn't
[52:37] that a paradox? Brother said it's hard
[52:40] to believe, but it's true. It's
[52:42] something that that you can't explain.
[52:43] It's incredible, but it's true. It's a
[52:45] paradox that things that are seen were
[52:48] made by things that do not appear there.
[52:50] The very things that you see, everything
[52:52] that you see that was created, all of
[52:55] that creation, all things that are made
[52:57] were made or are built by Adams and
[52:59] those atoms were created by something
[53:01] that does not even appear. I I thought,
[53:03] isn't it wonderful that the seen world
[53:05] was made by the unseen? And the Bible
[53:07] said it was all made by the word of God.
[53:09] And now, I'll just tell you this this
[53:10] morning, that's the only thing that'll
[53:12] keep it together. I know people look
[53:14] around the world, they say, "Well, the
[53:15] world has fallen apart." But the only
[53:17] thing that's keeping it together is the
[53:19] word of God. That same word that created
[53:21] in the beginning. And that's the only
[53:22] thing that'll keep you together when you
[53:24] start falling apart or keep a family
[53:25] together when a family starts falling
[53:27] apart or keep a marriage together. When
[53:29] a marriage is falling apart, it's the
[53:31] word of God. It's the only thing that
[53:33] binds. It's the only thing that that
[53:34] keeps things together. Satan's always
[53:36] tormenting pressure and tearing apart
[53:38] and bringing pressure upon this earthly
[53:41] life. But God has sent us something in
[53:43] this age that would bring it back
[53:44] together and hold it together.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; See the unseen or the seen was made by
[53:48] the unseen. Now we realize that living
[53:50] on this earth that we live in three
[53:52] dimensions. How many know that there
[53:55] explained what they were? He said it was
[53:57] light, matter and time. That's the three
[53:59] dimensions that we live in. You know, he
[54:01] said and in this in the corporal body
[54:03] here on earth, he said we can't get past
[54:05] these three dimensions. In fact, God has
[54:07] given us five senses. See, taste, feel,
[54:10] smell, and hear. and those senses that
[54:12] God has given this natural man. Your
[54:14] senses were only made to contact those
[54:17] three dimensions. So you can't get
[54:19] outside of those three dimensions with
[54:20] the senses that God has given a natural
[54:23] man. Now you know you think about these
[54:24] these dimensions that we live in and
[54:26] most of most of it we we see we we deal
[54:29] with it every day. We realize what light
[54:31] is and what matter which all things that
[54:33] we see are made up of matter made up of
[54:35] atoms. Adam is the atoms are the
[54:37] building blocks of matter. And so so
[54:39] this is a three-dimensional world. I
[54:40] thought, you know, but if if you take
[54:42] them one at a time, even matter is a
[54:44] three-dimensional thing. All all things
[54:46] have three dimensions. You realize that
[54:48] we live in a three-dimensional world. Me
[54:49] and I was having a math lesson the other
[54:51] day and talking uh talking about
[54:53] formulas and what and what they mean and
[54:55] and uh trying to to get her to remember
[54:58] them. And after a little while, she
[54:59] said, "I don't see the point of this at
[55:00] all. Why does it matter uh how how you
[55:03] find uh uh uh the how much area is in a
[55:06] square and how much area is in a circle?
[55:08] Th this is silly. I'll never use this
[55:10] and what what's it have to do with
[55:11] anything? So, I got to explaining to her
[55:14] that a square is not really a thing. How
[55:16] many knows that a square don't really
[55:17] exist? I know we we think we read it on
[55:20] paper and the teachers show us all the
[55:21] shapes and and the shapes are good to
[55:23] learn because one day you'll use them to
[55:25] apply to the real world that you live
[55:27] in. But but a but a circle or a square,
[55:30] a square is only a concept. It's not a
[55:32] real thing. A square is a geometrical
[55:34] concept. It's a plane. It doesn't exist.
[55:37] Uh it doesn't matter how thin you you
[55:39] know you could take a a piece of paper
[55:40] like this and say well that's a
[55:42] rectangle. Well it's a it's a shape of a
[55:45] rectangle. It's a shape of that concept.
[55:47] But in reality everything has another
[55:49] dimension to it. See a square is a
[55:51] plane. It don't have a third dimension.
[55:53] It's on paper. It's a concept. And so in
[55:56] other words like you would take this
[55:57] bottle and you say well it has a height
[55:59] and it has a width. So that makes it a
[56:01] plane. That that's how that's what a
[56:03] square is on paper. But but that bottle
[56:05] has if it only had a height and a width,
[56:07] you could not put anything in it. It has
[56:09] no depth to it. And so it becomes only
[56:12] two-dimensional. That's why that's what
[56:13] makes an artist a great artist. We we
[56:15] were at at Brother David Silers and they
[56:17] made us draw pictures of our of our
[56:20] wives and husbands and and I found out
[56:22] real quick I I drew the the the picture
[56:24] of my wife. Thank God that picture don't
[56:25] exist. But I found out real quick what a
[56:28] real artist is able to do. And an artist
[56:31] is able to capture the depth of of of
[56:34] this that third dimension on paper.
[56:36] They're they're able not to just draw
[56:38] what you see as a flat, but they're able
[56:40] to make it dimensional. And so it looks
[56:43] like it looks real whenever you see it.
[56:45] And and so so without depth or without
[56:47] that third dimension, then you would
[56:49] never be able to put anything in a
[56:51] bottle. That's what I was showing
[56:52] Annihas. See, a square is not a real a
[56:54] real thing, but a cube is a real thing.
[56:56] So the formula for the square is
[56:58] teaching you how to know how much volume
[57:01] is in a cube. So so one day you you may
[57:04] want to know how much fits in a box. So
[57:05] you calculate the square and then when
[57:07] you add that third dimension that depth
[57:09] now you know how many shoes you can put
[57:11] in the box or how many hair bows you can
[57:13] put in the box or or how many how much
[57:16] volume will fit in that cylinder or fit
[57:17] in that bottle. So it has real life
[57:19] application in three dimensions. But if
[57:21] it only is two-dimensional it has no
[57:24] real application. Are are you with me?
[57:26] So, so in other words without three
[57:28] dimensions only with two dimensions it
[57:30] would say even science would tell you
[57:32] any two-dimensional it's only a
[57:34] geometrical concept and is impossible
[57:37] impossible to be created in the physical
[57:40] world you know I got to thinking about
[57:41] that I thought isn't that the way it is
[57:43] if it only has two dimensions and it has
[57:45] no depth without depth it's only a
[57:47] concept I thought there's a lot of
[57:48] places in this world that take the word
[57:50] of God that way and it's a
[57:52] two-dimensional thing and they they
[57:53] don't like the depth of the word they
[57:55] that don't look look forward to this
[57:57] prophetic ministry that that would bring
[57:59] you into the depths of the word of God.
[58:01] But friends, I've got news for you.
[58:02] Anything that's only two-dimensional and
[58:05] only surface and don't go into the depth
[58:07] of it, it has no volume. It's only a
[58:10] concept. And I've got news for you this
[58:12] morning. I'm not here to gain a
[58:14] religious concept. I I'm not here I want
[58:16] more than a a religious concept or some
[58:19] denominational concept, but I want the
[58:21] reality of the word of God. And let me
[58:23] tell you what it takes. It takes a
[58:25] revelation cuz a prophet of God would
[58:26] tell us that or teach us that a
[58:28] revelation takes you deeper and deeper
[58:30] into the word of God. I thought mine the
[58:32] more revelation you have the deeper you
[58:35] go into the word and the more volume
[58:37] that there is and the more of you that
[58:39] God can pour himself into because you
[58:42] take a revelation of the word of God.
[58:44] Friends, let me tell you, we're not just
[58:45] here to be a two-dimensional Christian.
[58:47] We're but even in the natural, we're not
[58:49] we're not two-dimensional people. We
[58:51] live in a threedimensional world.
[58:54] Everything has three dimensions or it
[58:56] don't exist in the real world. But that
[58:58] ain't the only dimensions. That's only
[59:00] the dimensions of the flesh. It's the
[59:02] dimensions of the natural. But brother,
[59:03] I'm going to say, but also in this realm
[59:05] or in this room, we know there's a
[59:08] fourth dimension and you cannot see it.
[59:10] But but television travels through it
[59:12] and science taps into that dimension.
[59:14] And uh radio waves and television waves
[59:17] and we all know that. We don't have to
[59:18] explain it, but they're going through
[59:20] the building and you can't see what they
[59:21] are, but they're really here. How what
[59:23] could send an image to a satellite and
[59:25] it send it back down to your phone and
[59:27] and and you know we would have never
[59:28] believed that when I was a kid. We' have
[59:30] thought you was the Jetsons or something
[59:31] if you could walk around with a phone
[59:32] and talk to somebody and see their face
[59:34] on a on a screen. But now our kids think
[59:37] that's just the normal the way things
[59:39] is. But although you can't see where it
[59:41] comes from, you can't see how it gets
[59:42] there. He said but it's the
[59:44] four-dimensional world. And so science
[59:46] it contacts through that radio, pictures
[59:48] on TV or television. He says so it
[59:50] proves that there's a fourth dimension.
[59:51] But he said, "But there's more there's
[59:53] more dimensions than that." But also in
[59:55] the fifth dimension there, he said, "The
[59:57] fifth dimension is where the sinner or
[59:59] the unbeliever dies and goes to." In the
[1:00:01] fifth dimension, he said it's a horrible
[1:00:03] dimension. It's the place where uh where
[1:00:05] if somebody would go to sleep at night,
[1:00:07] and they would, he said, to break it
[1:00:08] down, a man would have a nightmare. He
[1:00:10] said, he's not altogether asleep and
[1:00:12] he's neither awake, but he's between
[1:00:15] sleep and awake. And it makes a horrible
[1:00:17] shaking or or it causes a nightmare. He
[1:00:19] said because it's the it's interacting
[1:00:21] with that fifth dimension. It's it's a
[1:00:23] it's a tormentor. That's where these
[1:00:25] spirits come from that that would
[1:00:27] torment you in the middle of the night
[1:00:28] or torment your spirit. Said they're
[1:00:30] coming from that fifth dimension. He
[1:00:31] said and and it's a it's such a a
[1:00:33] horrible place. He said but that's where
[1:00:35] a man goes to whenever he dies
[1:00:37] unconverted. Said he's dead on the earth
[1:00:40] and he can't go into the presence of God
[1:00:42] because he's not fit to go there without
[1:00:43] the blood. He hasn't gone through
[1:00:45] judgment. He cannot come back to the
[1:00:47] earth because his time's finished here
[1:00:48] on earth. So he's caught between the
[1:00:51] earth and that place he says. So he's
[1:00:53] caught in a nightmare and he's in a
[1:00:56] nightmare and he stays in that nightmare
[1:00:58] until the day of judgment. I thought my
[1:01:00] what a what a frightening place to live
[1:01:02] or to die unconverted and to live in a
[1:01:05] nightmare in that in that place just a
[1:01:07] horrible horrible image. He said, "But
[1:01:10] then when a Christian dies, he don't go
[1:01:12] to that place. But a Christian, he goes
[1:01:14] into the sixth dimension." He said, "In
[1:01:16] that sixth dimension, that's the place
[1:01:17] where a Christian goes. It's under the
[1:01:19] altar of God. Right into the presence of
[1:01:21] God, under the altar there, he can be at
[1:01:23] rest." See, all the tormentor can't get
[1:01:25] to it. Can I just tell you something
[1:01:27] free this morning? There ain't nothing
[1:01:28] in the fifth dimension that can torment
[1:01:30] anything in the sixth dimension. See, it
[1:01:32] don't have no access. It can't it can't
[1:01:34] be it can't go into that dimension
[1:01:36] without being drawn into it. See, you
[1:01:38] can only go there by invitation. It's a
[1:01:40] closed door. It ain't something that can
[1:01:42] be broken into. So when you go to this
[1:01:44] place of rest, you don't have to worry
[1:01:46] about on this earth. I know how Satan
[1:01:48] does and he torments us when you lose
[1:01:50] loved ones and where they are and what
[1:01:52] they're going through and all that.
[1:01:53] That's why the Catholic churches had
[1:01:55] made so much money because they could
[1:01:56] use that grief and cause people to give
[1:01:58] them money to pay people out of one
[1:02:00] dimension into another. But friends, you
[1:02:02] can't buy your way in there. You can't
[1:02:04] cheat your way in there. You can't sneak
[1:02:06] your way in there. But once you're
[1:02:07] there, you're at rest because it's a
[1:02:09] dimension that God has created just like
[1:02:12] the dimension that we live in that it's
[1:02:15] not a fearful thing. It's not a scary
[1:02:17] thing, but it's just like us. Brother
[1:02:18] Mark, I can sit around and shake your
[1:02:20] hand. And brother Bam, when he had the
[1:02:22] vision of going beyond the curtain of
[1:02:23] time, he said, I believe that's where I
[1:02:25] was in that sixth dimension. People come
[1:02:27] up shaking hands and they hugged you and
[1:02:29] they knew who they were and they were
[1:02:31] having a great fellowship there. No pain
[1:02:33] and no suffering like we have over
[1:02:35] there. He said, "See, it's it's the
[1:02:37] sixth dimension." He said, "I was in
[1:02:38] that place in my vision." He said, "I
[1:02:40] looked back down and saw it." He said,
[1:02:41] "Because those Can I just give you
[1:02:43] something free?" It make me about want
[1:02:44] to shout when I read it. He said, "But
[1:02:46] because those that are in that
[1:02:47] dimension, they can contact different
[1:02:49] than you can contact." He said, "See,
[1:02:51] your sight can't see there with your
[1:02:53] natural sight, and you can't contact."
[1:02:55] He said, "But when I was in that
[1:02:56] dimension, I could look up on this
[1:02:58] earth." Remember, he saw his own body
[1:03:00] laying in a bed. He said because their
[1:03:02] contact goes far beyond any contact of
[1:03:05] our natural senses would be able to
[1:03:07] contact. So don't think it a strange
[1:03:09] thing when they say well your mama can
[1:03:11] look down on you or your daddy could
[1:03:13] look down on you or see things that was
[1:03:15] going on going on in this world. He said
[1:03:17] because their contact seas farther than
[1:03:19] our I don't know about y'all but that
[1:03:20] makes me about want to shout to think
[1:03:22] about my grandma that that that would
[1:03:24] sing some of those glorious gospel songs
[1:03:26] that could come in and look down on a
[1:03:28] service or enter into a service in
[1:03:30] another dimension and have a shouting
[1:03:32] time over on the other side while just
[1:03:34] waiting for the saints of God to come
[1:03:36] and meet in the air.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; He said then there's another dimension
[1:03:40] that seventh dimension. He said that's
[1:03:42] where God is. Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I know what people say when when you get
[1:03:45] to preaching on this.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Well, you have to see it. I have to see
[1:03:49] it in order to believe it. I've been
[1:03:50] told that.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, that ain't really true
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; because there's many things that are
[1:03:54] widely accepted that you can't see.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; How about wind? You can't see wind,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; but everybody accept it accepts it as a
[1:04:00] thing, but you can't see it.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows where it is. You know, you
[1:04:04] can't you can't you can't you can't
[1:04:05] actually see it. How about love? You
[1:04:07] can't see love. But when they bring the
[1:04:09] grandbaby in the room and there's
[1:04:10] something in your heart starts to be
[1:04:12] said, "What is it? It's love. I can't
[1:04:14] see it. I couldn't I couldn't open up a
[1:04:16] heart and find love in a heart that's
[1:04:17] nothing you could see with a natural
[1:04:18] eye, but it's really there." How about a
[1:04:21] life that's in a seed? You take a seed
[1:04:22] out of a package, you couldn't dissect
[1:04:24] that seed. You'd never be able to find
[1:04:26] life in the seed. There's no Where is
[1:04:28] life there? It doesn't have a
[1:04:29] compartment in the seed. There's nothing
[1:04:31] in it that would say it was alive. But
[1:04:33] when you put it in the ground in the
[1:04:34] right atmosphere and the sunlight and
[1:04:36] the water gets on it, all of a sudden it
[1:04:38] comes to life and it begins to grow. It
[1:04:40] could lay there a hundred years dormant
[1:04:42] but just a few days in the presence of
[1:04:43] the right atmosphere it begins to grow.
[1:04:45] So although you can't ex can't see it,
[1:04:48] brother Mark, but still yet we accept
[1:04:50] it. You say, "Well, why do we accept
[1:04:52] things that we can't see?" Well, you
[1:04:53] accept it because of the effect that it
[1:04:55] has on the seen world. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:58] See, it's an unseen thing, but you
[1:05:00] accept it. And you know, you know what
[1:05:01] that proves to us? It it's proof of the
[1:05:04] unseen is the effect that it has on the
[1:05:07] scene. That's the very proof of the
[1:05:08] unseen world is the effect that it has
[1:05:11] on the seen world. You know why? Because
[1:05:13] anytime the unseen begins to interact
[1:05:15] with the seen world, then there's always
[1:05:17] a movement. When the wind that's unseen
[1:05:20] interacts with an unseen world, the wind
[1:05:22] the the leaves begin to move and the
[1:05:24] grass begins to blow. And you may not
[1:05:26] can see the wind, but you see the effect
[1:05:28] that it has on the world. When love
[1:05:30] begins to interact with an unseen world,
[1:05:33] you tell me what causes it causes a
[1:05:35] movement. You see an act of love, a true
[1:05:37] love act expressed. How come it is when
[1:05:40] you watch when you watch something or
[1:05:41] see a an an expression of love, it
[1:05:43] brings tears to your eyes and it softens
[1:05:47] our heart? What I it's a movement.
[1:05:49] Anytime the unseen interacts with the
[1:05:51] scene, it brings a movement. When a when
[1:05:53] a seed comes to lie, it begins to break
[1:05:56] open and the soil has to move back and
[1:05:58] the dirt has to get out of its way and
[1:06:00] the rocks are pushed aside and it moves
[1:06:02] up through the ground. Why? Because
[1:06:04] anytime the unseen interacts with the
[1:06:06] seen world, there's always a movement.
[1:06:08] And friends, let me tell you this that
[1:06:10] the devil has always been trying to to
[1:06:12] pull you into darkness and he's trying
[1:06:14] to pull you into wrapped you all up in
[1:06:17] that fifth dimension. But I thank God
[1:06:19] that there's a God today that is not
[1:06:21] allowing the church to be drawn into
[1:06:23] that dimension or into that into that
[1:06:25] old world, INTO THAT SATANIC REALM. BUT
[1:06:28] THERE'S A GOD that is drawing us into
[1:06:30] OUR HEAVENLY HOME. AND [laughter] WE'VE
[1:06:31] BEEN CONTACTED FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION,
[1:06:34] Brother Mark. It ain't the region of the
[1:06:35] lost. It ain't some pits of hell
[1:06:37] somewhere, but it's a heavenly DIMENSION
[1:06:39] THAT GOD IS CALLING THE CHURCH INTO this
[1:06:42] morning.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; As much evils in the world that ought to
[1:06:46] make you believe in God. As much as
[1:06:48] there's a reality of a fifth dimension,
[1:06:50] it ought to make you a believer of a
[1:06:51] sixth dimension,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; a believer of a place you can be with
[1:06:56] God. See, he's drawn you into another
[1:06:58] dimension, a heavenly dimension, in a
[1:07:00] dimension where God can use you. See,
[1:07:03] because in that other dimension, in this
[1:07:04] sixth dimension, that's where the
[1:07:06] supernatural is. That's where the the
[1:07:08] the miracle the miracles take place. It
[1:07:11] it's in another dimension. It's outside
[1:07:13] of this seen world of this
[1:07:14] three-dimensional world. You remember
[1:07:15] when David would write of the suffering
[1:07:17] of Christ in the book of Psalms, he
[1:07:19] wrote about how Christ suffered. But
[1:07:20] remember said, watch. He said it was
[1:07:22] Christ standing back here in David. He
[1:07:24] said David couldn't even think. His mind
[1:07:26] had gone from him. And David in his
[1:07:28] mind, are you ready for this? David in
[1:07:30] his mind was hanging on a cross like you
[1:07:34] see the statue hanging on the cross and
[1:07:36] he was crying, "My God, my God, why hast
[1:07:38] thou forsaken me? By bones, they stare
[1:07:40] at me. They pierce my hands and my feet.
[1:07:42] They thrust my side. Why are thou so far
[1:07:44] from me? The bulls of Bashan can pass
[1:07:46] out. They wagged their heads saying he
[1:07:48] trusted in God and he would deliver him.
[1:07:50] But now let's see if he'll deliver him.
[1:07:52] He was speaking the same words that
[1:07:54] Christ would speak. He said, "But when
[1:07:55] God was made manifest on earth," notice
[1:07:58] he said the same words that David did.
[1:08:01] He said, you see, because it wasn't the
[1:08:03] word of a man, it was the word of God.
[1:08:05] He said there was God in David. It
[1:08:07] wasn't David. He didn't know what he was
[1:08:09] saying at all. He was just so in the
[1:08:11] spirit. You said, "Well, how much in the
[1:08:12] spirit was he?" Can I tell you the
[1:08:14] example? He said, "That's the way it was
[1:08:16] with Moses. He was so much in the spirit
[1:08:18] that he literally passed out of this
[1:08:21] dimension that he was living in and he
[1:08:24] stood there face to face in a burning
[1:08:26] bush and he was talking to GOD HIMSELF."
[1:08:29] THAT'S WHY other people could walk by
[1:08:30] and they couldn't see what Moses saw.
[1:08:32] That's why the burning bush, it wasn't
[1:08:34] consumed because it was interacting with
[1:08:36] another dimension. But whenever Moses
[1:08:39] walked along, oh my, to think that he
[1:08:40] walked along in the wilderness long
[1:08:42] enough until one day HE WALKED, DIDN'T
[1:08:44] EVEN KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE WAS
[1:08:46] WALKING IN THIS THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD,
[1:08:48] BUT ONE DAY HE STEPPED OUT OF ONE
[1:08:49] DIMENSION AND INTO ANOTHER. AND IN THAT
[1:08:52] DIMENSION, THE SUPERNATURAL BE TO TAKE
[1:08:54] PLACE. IN THAT DIMENSION, A BUSH, IT
[1:08:56] CAUGHT ON FIRE, BUT IT WAS NOW CONSUMED.
[1:08:59] AND IT DREW HIM MIXED IN THIS
[1:09:00] THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD. HE WAS
[1:09:02] INTERACTING WITH ANOTHER DIMENSION.
[1:09:05] THAT'S WHY DAVID COULD COULD FEEL THE
[1:09:07] SUFFERING of Christ. He was in another
[1:09:09] dimension seeing what you know let me
[1:09:11] tell you because that other dimension
[1:09:12] it's not affected by time. We live in
[1:09:15] time, light and matter. But when you get
[1:09:18] out of that dimension that's why a
[1:09:19] prophet of God can go so far in time and
[1:09:22] say this is the way it's going to be. OR
[1:09:24] HE COULD GO SO BACK IN TIME. HE CAN SAY
[1:09:26] THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS because he
[1:09:28] entered into ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT'S
[1:09:30] FAR BEYOND THE DIMENSION that we live
[1:09:31] in. He
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; said, "I imagine." He stood there in
[1:09:35] that other dimension. Take off your
[1:09:37] shoes for the ground you're standing on
[1:09:38] is holy ground. He said, "I imagine when
[1:09:40] Moses left there, he thought, what just
[1:09:43] happened?"
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Imagine when he left there, what just
[1:09:46] happened?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; He stepped into another dimension
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and he interacted with God.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Might think he just walking one day and
[1:09:55] walk right out of this dimension into
[1:09:56] another. Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Says, "See, you know what that tells us
[1:10:01] is the door to that dimension is not up
[1:10:03] there in the clouds somewhere.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It's not way off in the clouds somewhere
[1:10:06] that you you have to climb some ladder
[1:10:08] or go to some temple in Jerusalem or go
[1:10:10] to some place out in the wilderness to
[1:10:12] be able to find God, the doorway, it's
[1:10:13] not there, but it's all around us.
[1:10:16] Wherever Moses was,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; he was walking in the wilderness. David,
[1:10:19] wherever David was, maybe he was sitting
[1:10:21] in a in a house, maybe he was sitting on
[1:10:23] a hillside. I don't know where he was,
[1:10:24] but wherever David was while he was
[1:10:26] there, he entered into that dimension.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, whether it's at home
[1:10:30] or whether it's a church or walking in
[1:10:32] the woods, driving down the road, but is
[1:10:34] able to enter into another dimension.
[1:10:36] The door is all around us. Brother man
[1:10:38] preached Jehovah Gyra. Remember the lady
[1:10:41] was sitting in the meeting. He said,
[1:10:42] "Ma'am, you with black gloves and hands
[1:10:44] like this, raise your hand. Look at me."
[1:10:46] He said, 'If I quote to you your prayer
[1:10:48] that you were praying, he said, 'I just
[1:10:50] heard it in another dimension and tell
[1:10:52] you what you're praying about, will you
[1:10:54] believe that Jesus heard your prayer and
[1:10:56] this is his anointing?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Who hears prayer? Only Christ.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I heard it in another
[1:11:02] dimension." Don't that answer some
[1:11:03] questions? How how how could you hear it
[1:11:06] or see what was taking place? Because
[1:11:08] it's not confined by light or matter or
[1:11:10] time. It's in another dimension. He
[1:11:12] said, "You were playing for praying for
[1:11:14] a bladder condition and you were praying
[1:11:15] for a colon condition, asking God to
[1:11:18] have me to speak to you. Is that right?"
[1:11:19] I want you to stand to your feet just a
[1:11:21] minute so the people will know. Turn
[1:11:22] around to the audience. He said, "Do you
[1:11:23] believe?" Well, don't fear, sister.
[1:11:25] You're going to be well.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Said, "Why do I say that? Isn't that
[1:11:28] what you'd ask?" Well, why would you say
[1:11:30] that? He said, "Because that darkness
[1:11:32] that was around you, it went away and
[1:11:34] that light was over there. It came right
[1:11:36] to where you were. What was it?" It
[1:11:37] wasn't some strange thing. It was just a
[1:11:39] prophet of God that had stepped into
[1:11:41] another dimension that could see that
[1:11:43] demonic spirits that were tormenting
[1:11:45] people. No wonder you could look at
[1:11:47] somebody and see what they were going
[1:11:48] through. That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:11:50] does. It finds the things in our life
[1:11:52] and things that we need help and things
[1:11:54] that were tormented in our flesh, but
[1:11:55] that light of God would come and
[1:11:57] overshadow. See, he was entered into
[1:11:59] another dimension. He said it turned
[1:12:00] light around you. First it was a dark
[1:12:02] shadow, but now that light come down and
[1:12:04] you accepted it. He said, "Now go
[1:12:06] believe and don't you doubt." He said,
[1:12:08] "Oh, don't you believe what you're
[1:12:09] told?" He said, "Surely, if he knew what
[1:12:11] your past was, then he knows what your
[1:12:13] future will be." Surely, if he's not
[1:12:15] confined by time and he's in another
[1:12:18] dimension that you can go back here and
[1:12:19] say, "I know what you were just NOW
[1:12:21] PRAYING. I KNOW WHAT you said because
[1:12:23] you're in another dimension. SO, LET ME
[1:12:24] WALK BACK OVER HERE AND HEAR what the
[1:12:26] prayer was." Yes. Yes. YES. NOW, LET ME
[1:12:28] GO BACK HERE AND TELL YOU WHAT THE
[1:12:29] RESULT OF IT IS. This is the WAY IT
[1:12:31] SHALL BE. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WALKING IN
[1:12:33] THESE THREE DIMENSIONS. YOU'RE NOT BOUND
[1:12:36] BY THIS THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD, BUT HE
[1:12:38] WAS WALKING in another dimension.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Stand up." Boy, she was
[1:12:45] standing up the and let the audience see
[1:12:47] what what God had done for you. And then
[1:12:49] while she was standing there, I love
[1:12:50] this. He said, "Oh, another thing, one
[1:12:53] more thing, lady." He said, "That deep
[1:12:54] walk with God you're seeking." He said,
[1:12:56] "That's right. It's true. You're going
[1:12:57] to receive it now." No, sis. I'm not
[1:12:59] reading your mind. I'm just telling you
[1:13:01] the desire of your heart and what your
[1:13:02] prayer is. Why? because he was in
[1:13:04] another dimension.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He entered into another dimension. Do
[1:13:07] you realize what that means is God can
[1:13:09] use you as much of you as you'll let God
[1:13:12] use.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; I know what people say. Well, that was a
[1:13:14] prophet. And I believe that. I don't
[1:13:16] believe God's going to do everything he
[1:13:17] done with a with a with a word prophet
[1:13:19] with everybody or even a a minor prophet
[1:13:22] or or a New Testament preacher. How you
[1:13:25] know, not everybody has that gift. I I I
[1:13:27] don't believe that that I believe that
[1:13:28] was a messiahic sign that God had used
[1:13:30] in this age to be able to call a people
[1:13:32] out of darkness into light. It it was to
[1:13:35] to call us by the message of the hour to
[1:13:37] our redeemed body. It was it was the it
[1:13:39] was the calling back to redemption. And
[1:13:40] so that was the purpose of the whole
[1:13:42] message. It was redemption. But that
[1:13:44] don't mean that God can't use you. And
[1:13:46] it don't mean that God can't bring you
[1:13:48] into that other dimension. It don't mean
[1:13:49] that you're not interacting with that
[1:13:51] other dimension. You you realize that
[1:13:52] God can use every one of us. I Oh, I I I
[1:13:55] feel that. I I know how it is because
[1:13:57] because we pick and choose who God can
[1:13:59] use.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We pick and choose who God can use.
[1:14:03] Well, God can use them because, you
[1:14:04] know, after all, they're great and he
[1:14:06] can't use this one because they're
[1:14:07] little. You know, maybe I'm too little
[1:14:08] for God to use and I'm not good enough
[1:14:10] and I I they you know, and the best one
[1:14:12] is, well, they go to my church so God
[1:14:14] can use them. By the way, aren't they
[1:14:15] miracle workers? But if they don't go to
[1:14:17] my church, God can't use them. You know,
[1:14:19] after all, God God only does things
[1:14:20] right here. That's a lie of the pits of
[1:14:22] hell.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; God can use anybody. Let me tell you
[1:14:24] what God can. He said, "See, because we
[1:14:26] we pick who God uses and who God can't
[1:14:28] use and and you know how you know how
[1:14:30] believe, you know, let me may as well
[1:14:32] get into it and where we're here now."
[1:14:33] So, but but but but we say, "Well, well,
[1:14:36] God can't use them because they don't
[1:14:37] believe like I do. So, therefore, God
[1:14:39] can't use them." Isn't that the attitude
[1:14:41] that people gets? But let me tell you,
[1:14:42] friends, I can tell you what a prophet
[1:14:44] said. Because we say, "Well, they don't
[1:14:46] believe the whole word and they don't
[1:14:47] believe just like me." And and you know,
[1:14:48] maybe maybe they don't believe all the
[1:14:50] things I believe, but God can't use them
[1:14:52] and they're all lost and they're all
[1:14:53] going to hell. They don't believe in
[1:14:55] healing, so they must be going to hell.
[1:14:57] They don't believe in discernment, so
[1:14:58] they must be going to hell. They must
[1:15:00] all be lost. And and people get these
[1:15:02] attitudes where where everybody's lost
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; because they don't believe just like you
[1:15:06] believe. Can I tell you what a prophet
[1:15:08] said? Remember when he told the story of
[1:15:10] Abraham and Lot? He said Lot wanted the
[1:15:12] world. He said he was a type of a carnal
[1:15:14] believer who didn't think these things
[1:15:16] were true and he went on down into
[1:15:18] Sodom. Am I running out of time? Thank
[1:15:20] you, brother Brian. I'm gonna ask you
[1:15:21] that. But but he said Lot was a carnal
[1:15:24] believer. You never ask a question you
[1:15:26] don't know the answer to. That's some
[1:15:28] free wisdom. So Lot was a believer. Lot
[1:15:31] Lot was a a carnal believer. He says,
[1:15:34] see, he was a he was a carnal believer.
[1:15:36] He didn't know these things were true.
[1:15:37] So he just went on down into Sodom. He
[1:15:39] said, 'But all these believers, he said,
[1:15:41] we could go on for hours. These
[1:15:43] believers, all believers are like change
[1:15:46] in out of your pocket in God's hands. He
[1:15:49] said, when you pull out change out of
[1:15:50] your pocket, there's pennies and nickels
[1:15:52] and dimes and quarters and half dollars,
[1:15:54] and they're all in coins. He said,
[1:15:55] "That's the way the world is in God's
[1:15:57] hand. There are some people that just
[1:15:59] can have a penny's worth of it, and God
[1:16:01] can only use them in a penny weight, and
[1:16:03] that's all they can buy." But are you
[1:16:05] ready for it? He said, "But don't reject
[1:16:07] them if they can't believe the real
[1:16:09] truth. Don't turn them down. Don't kick
[1:16:13] them out and say they're not in it."
[1:16:15] Because God, are you ready? Because God
[1:16:18] uses pennies sometimes.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; They may not be THE SAME. THEY MAY NOT
[1:16:23] BELIEVE EVERYTHING LIKE YOU BELIEVE IT.
[1:16:24] THEY MAY NOT SEE EVERYTHING LIKE YOU SEE
[1:16:26] IT. BUT DON'T GET THAT. I KNOW THE
[1:16:28] ATTITUDE THAT PEOPLE GET. BUT CAN I CAN
[1:16:29] I just preach to YOU THIS MORNING? WE'RE
[1:16:31] NOT THE PEOPLE THAT'S GOING AROUND
[1:16:32] TELLING EVERYBODY they're lost and
[1:16:34] they're going to hell because you don't
[1:16:36] believe like I DO OR CUZ YOU DON'T
[1:16:37] UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY I DO OR BECAUSE
[1:16:39] YOU DON'T SEE IT THE WAY I DO. WELL,
[1:16:41] HELL'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU. WE
[1:16:42] AIN'T THEM KIND OF PEOPLE. I DON'T HAVE
[1:16:44] THAT kind of an attitude. BUT I I THERE
[1:16:46] MAY BE SOME PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE THAT
[1:16:48] WAY, but it ain't me. I don't believe
[1:16:49] the message was sent to go into the
[1:16:51] world and to condemn it and discourage
[1:16:53] and to bind people and TO PERSECUTE THEM
[1:16:55] OR FELLOW MAN. BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS SENT
[1:16:57] TO EXEMPLIFY Jesus Christ and bring
[1:17:00] redemption to A LOST AND A DYING
[1:17:02] GENERATION.
[1:17:04] And I believe whenever it's taught
[1:17:05] correctly and the message that God sent
[1:17:07] in this hour ever gets in the human
[1:17:09] heart, THEN THE HEART OF THE PROPHET OF
[1:17:11] GOD WOULD DROP IN YOUR HEART and the
[1:17:13] love for your fellow MAN WOULD BE
[1:17:14] EXEMPLIFIED THROUGH YOUR LIFE AND YOU'LL
[1:17:16] DO NOTHING BUT BUT DRAW PEOPLE INTO THAT
[1:17:19] DIMENSION THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO.
[1:17:23] SAID, "We weren't sent to do that." But
[1:17:25] remember said, "Lot was just a penny.
[1:17:27] Abraham was a silver dollar. It may take
[1:17:29] a hundred lots to make an Abraham." I've
[1:17:31] heard that preached, but it was never in
[1:17:32] this context. Said God was made, it was
[1:17:35] it was made to separate and put out and
[1:17:36] stuff like that, but that's nonsense. He
[1:17:38] said a 100 carnal believers, they
[1:17:40] wouldn't stand in the presence of a
[1:17:41] genuine Christian that's separated from
[1:17:43] the carnal things of the world living in
[1:17:45] Christ Jesus where the word can flow
[1:17:47] through them. There is a difference.
[1:17:49] There is a separation. There is a
[1:17:51] difference. But it don't make them
[1:17:52] worthless. It don't make somebody
[1:17:54] worthless because they don't believe
[1:17:55] like you do or or they don't see things
[1:17:57] the way you see it. He said he can only
[1:17:59] take a penny's worth. That's all he's
[1:18:00] got. He said, "So people say, are you
[1:18:03] ready?" He said, "So if people say I
[1:18:05] don't believe in healing and I don't
[1:18:07] believe in these things, just know it's
[1:18:08] a penny and let him alone. It's just a
[1:18:11] penny's worth and that's all they can
[1:18:12] buy. Don't stop him. Just let him
[1:18:14] alone." Remember that's as far as he can
[1:18:17] go. And then brother Brandham even feels
[1:18:19] convicted about the statement that he
[1:18:21] made and he says now I didn't mean that
[1:18:23] hardly the way I said it. He said I mean
[1:18:25] well I belong to this talking about
[1:18:27] people belonging to certain
[1:18:28] denominations and I this the way my
[1:18:30] church believes you know he said I
[1:18:31] belong to this and that's just WHAT WE
[1:18:33] BELIEVE. HE SAID IT'S JUST A PENNY JUST
[1:18:35] GO AHEAD see it's just a penny and say
[1:18:38] well Lord bless you my brother. See he
[1:18:40] is copper. He can be he can never be
[1:18:42] silver. So why are you trying to make
[1:18:44] him silver? He said that's the WAY IT
[1:18:46] IS. JUST GO AHEAD. BUT GOD CAN USE HIM.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He is using it. HE SAID, "AND I'D RATHER
[1:18:53] SEE HIM DOWN HERE in a church than to
[1:18:55] see him in a barroom standing there on
[1:18:57] the corner, wouldn't you?" He said, "SO
[1:18:59] JUST LET IT ALONE. GOD CAN USE IT
[1:19:01] ANYHOW. HE MIGHT NOT USE IT VERY MUCH,
[1:19:04] BUT HE'LL use what he can use as much as
[1:19:07] THEY WILL LET GOD USE THEM."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; You know, friends, you know what that
[1:19:11] means? That means we all just OUGHT TO
[1:19:12] BE CHANGED IN GOD'S hands and say, "God,
[1:19:15] use me how you see fit." Quit judging
[1:19:17] the whole world and saying, "Well,
[1:19:19] they're they're all lost and they're all
[1:19:20] wrong and THEY'RE ALL DYING AND GOING TO
[1:19:22] HELL AND BECOME LIKE A A PROPHET OF GOD
[1:19:25] IN THE HEART OF A PROPHET OF GOD AND
[1:19:27] SAY, BUT YOU KNOW, SOME MAY SPEND A
[1:19:29] QUARTER'S WORTH. Some may spend A
[1:19:31] DOLLAR'S WORTH, SOME MAY BE A NICKEL'S
[1:19:33] WORTH, BUT I THANK GOD THAT THEY'RE ALL
[1:19:35] CHANGED IN THE HANDS OF THE CREATOR.
[1:19:38] just be changed
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; in God's hands and let God suspend you
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; as he sees fit.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get a spirit to put
[1:19:48] everybody out.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know where that come from.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; What kind of believer when a prophet of
[1:19:54] God said that the cry of the bride was
[1:19:56] mercy?
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Then what kind of believer that's called
[1:19:59] the bride of Jesus Christ would cry
[1:20:01] judgment upon people
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; when the cry of your heart should be
[1:20:04] mercy to the world? It ought to be to
[1:20:06] open A DOOR INTO THAT DIMENSION TO ALLOW
[1:20:08] PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO IT. IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:20:10] TO TO TO INTERACT WITH THEM IN A IN A
[1:20:13] WAY THAT THEY WOULD WANT more of God.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; That's the heart of God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I've collected a lot of coins.
[1:20:24] You know, in my experience of collecting
[1:20:26] coins, any of you that's ever looked at
[1:20:27] coin values, sometimes a coin's worth
[1:20:31] more than it appears at face value
[1:20:32] anyway.
[1:20:37] It may look like a penny
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and it may say penny all over it, but
[1:20:41] don't you dare judge its worth.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what it's worth. The Denver
[1:20:45] mint 1943, they took some pennies and
[1:20:47] they accidentally uh minted some of them
[1:20:50] with bronze. One of them sold for $2
[1:20:51] million.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It's a penny. I don't have one,
[1:20:55] but it's a penny,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; but it was worth $2 million. You know,
[1:20:59] it's copper on the outside, but the
[1:21:02] market looked like copper. People spent
[1:21:03] it. They had it in their hand. They
[1:21:05] spent it. Spent it in a store. Somebody
[1:21:06] bought a Somebody bought a bag of chips
[1:21:08] with it. 1943 and a Coke.
[1:21:13] But But today, it's worth $2 million.
[1:21:16] See, because what was on the outside
[1:21:18] didn't reflect what was on the inside.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; On the inside, it had more value.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; There was some other qualities on the
[1:21:24] inside of it that made it a different
[1:21:25] kind of metal. It wasn't copper. It was
[1:21:27] made of bronze. You know, you know what
[1:21:28] that means? That means we just need to
[1:21:30] be coined in God's hands.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; God, I I I I don't know. I don't feel
[1:21:33] like I'm worth anyway. Most of the time,
[1:21:35] it's the ones that don't feel like
[1:21:36] they're worth is actually are worth
[1:21:37] more. The ones that don't feel like
[1:21:39] they're worth very much. That's the ones
[1:21:41] that are really valuable. You ever
[1:21:43] notice how bronze is made? Can I take a
[1:21:44] second? You ever notice how bronze is
[1:21:46] made? You know, you know, copper is a
[1:21:48] softer metal, but after the Stone Age
[1:21:51] became the Bronze Age, if you study
[1:21:52] history, the remember the Bronze Age,
[1:21:54] which which in the the Stone Age, Bronze
[1:21:57] Age, Iron Age, we're still in that age,
[1:21:59] but but in the they're trying to make it
[1:22:00] a new computer age, whatever. But but
[1:22:02] but in the Bronze Age, they they uh they
[1:22:05] actually found tools or or weapons. It
[1:22:08] was the advancement of civilization and
[1:22:10] advancement of of of people growing
[1:22:13] together, development of of riding
[1:22:15] systems and all that. But in that age,
[1:22:16] the reason it's called a bronze age is
[1:22:18] because they discovered something that
[1:22:19] was harder than a stone. And so they
[1:22:21] actually took copper, which was a metal,
[1:22:23] and took tin, which was a softer metal.
[1:22:25] Like, you know, tin is so soft you can
[1:22:26] bend it. And it was such an odd thing
[1:22:28] because how however they they discovered
[1:22:30] it, but but whenever they added tin to
[1:22:33] copper, it actually made copper harder.
[1:22:35] It formed what was called bronze. And so
[1:22:37] there's a whole age of how that was
[1:22:39] formed. And you know, I thought, isn't
[1:22:41] it something that you could add tin to
[1:22:43] copper and it actually made copper
[1:22:44] harder? Isn't that something that you
[1:22:46] would take? Because usually if you add
[1:22:48] something weaker to something that's
[1:22:49] stronger, it only weakens it. If you had
[1:22:51] a cup of coffee, I know this from I know
[1:22:53] my me and my wife, we we we do this
[1:22:55] experiment all the time, but if you have
[1:22:56] a pot of coffee and you add water to the
[1:22:58] pot of coffee, it weakens it, you know.
[1:23:00] So So the more because co because water
[1:23:03] is weak of coffee. It's it's 100% no
[1:23:05] coffee. So the weaker when you pour the
[1:23:07] weaker into the stronger the the it
[1:23:09] becomes weaker and weaker and weaker and
[1:23:11] weaker and weaker. But when it come to
[1:23:13] copper you could add tin to copper and
[1:23:15] copper and tin is softer. But when you
[1:23:17] would add tin to copper it would make
[1:23:19] that thing that was stronger than it
[1:23:21] actually stronger or more strengthen. I
[1:23:23] I thought it's such a paradox to think
[1:23:25] that because we think weak and weaker
[1:23:27] thing ought to make something weaker. It
[1:23:29] shouldn't make it stronger. But my
[1:23:30] whenever whenever I whenever I uh read
[1:23:32] about that, I thought, isn't that isn't
[1:23:34] that what Paul's message was in first or
[1:23:36] in second Corinthians and he said, "I I
[1:23:38] was I had my infirmities and I went to
[1:23:40] God with my infirmities and and I talked
[1:23:42] to him about how I needed help and
[1:23:43] deliverance." And and when I prayed for
[1:23:45] my infirmities, he said to me, "My grace
[1:23:47] is sufficient for thee, for my strength
[1:23:49] is made perfect in your weakness." I
[1:23:51] thought, "Isn't that something that the
[1:23:52] strength or the power of God is
[1:23:54] perfected by something that was weaker
[1:23:56] than it?" He said, "My strength or my
[1:23:58] power was made perfect by your
[1:24:00] weakness." So in other words, that's why
[1:24:02] Paul said that I would gladly glory in
[1:24:04] my infirmities that the power of Christ
[1:24:07] may rest upon me. Therefore, I don't
[1:24:09] hang my head in condemnation for the
[1:24:11] weakness of my flesh. For the strength
[1:24:13] of God or the power of God has been made
[1:24:16] PERFECT BY MY WEAKNESS. IT WAS A weaker
[1:24:19] thing that was added to a stronger
[1:24:20] thing, but it MADE THE STRONGER THING
[1:24:22] EVEN STRONGER. It perfected IT. IT GAVE
[1:24:25] IT ITS STRENGTH. I I THOUGHT MIKE, CAN
[1:24:27] YOU IMAGINE how the weakness OF HUMANITY
[1:24:29] WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POWER OF GOD?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; But this is what he told Paul. It's made
[1:24:34] perfect in your weakness. You know, you
[1:24:35] know that word power, he said, "My
[1:24:37] strength is made perfect." That that
[1:24:38] word strength come from the word
[1:24:40] dunamis, which was power. And it's used
[1:24:42] to describe the power of God. So we, you
[1:24:44] know, you find in the New Testament that
[1:24:46] the word power is mentioned many times
[1:24:48] in the New Testament, but there's many
[1:24:50] different meanings. It may be talking
[1:24:51] about dominion or authority or control
[1:24:55] or or or energy. All these different
[1:24:57] Greek words that were used to define
[1:24:59] power, inertia, iscus, strength,
[1:25:01] physical, internal strength, all these
[1:25:02] words that are used to define power. But
[1:25:05] when it comes to this scripture, he
[1:25:06] said, "For my strength is made perfect
[1:25:08] in weakness." That word strength come
[1:25:10] from the Greek word dunamis. And that
[1:25:12] word dunamis is defining the miraculous
[1:25:15] power of God or a dynamite power, a
[1:25:18] miraculous power. It's something. It's
[1:25:20] something that that uh uh the best part
[1:25:22] about it when he talks about my strength
[1:25:24] is when you use this word dunamis, it's
[1:25:26] referring to a power that is residing in
[1:25:29] something waiting to be exerted.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; So it's not because you can grow
[1:25:33] strength by going and lifting. You know,
[1:25:34] you could lift up and lift up and build
[1:25:36] up. There was nothing in there. You
[1:25:37] actually built it. Cause muscles to tear
[1:25:39] down and build up and become stronger.
[1:25:41] But that wouldn't be dunamis power.
[1:25:43] Dunamis power is something that is
[1:25:45] laying in something by virtue of its
[1:25:47] nature. In other words, what we call a
[1:25:49] rock a rock because of its nature,
[1:25:50] right? You knock on Carter's head, you
[1:25:52] say it's hard as a
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And so because but but we say
[1:25:56] that because he's got a hard head and so
[1:25:58] but ask ask Jonah. His head he's got a
[1:26:01] hard head. And so but but
[1:26:04] [clears throat] we call a rock a rock
[1:26:05] because it is hard. So by virtue of its
[1:26:08] nature, it has its identity. So when we
[1:26:11] talk about the power of God or this
[1:26:13] dunamis power of God, it's it's by
[1:26:15] virtue of its nature. In other words,
[1:26:17] God is a powerful God or miraculous God.
[1:26:19] It's by virtue of his nature. In other
[1:26:22] words, this power is residing in a place
[1:26:24] and it's waiting to be used. It's
[1:26:26] waiting to be exerted. That's what
[1:26:28] dunamis means. That's why so he said my
[1:26:30] dunamis, can I just say it in the Greek?
[1:26:31] My dunamis is made perfect in your
[1:26:33] weakness. So the power of God, this
[1:26:35] residing power of God that's by the
[1:26:37] virtue of the nature of God, it's laying
[1:26:39] within God waiting to be expressed or
[1:26:41] waiting TO BE EXERTED. BUT GOD SAID,
[1:26:43] "BUT MY MY DUNAMIS, my strength is made
[1:26:46] perfect in your weakness." In other
[1:26:47] words, God, it's laying in God. It's the
[1:26:49] the miraculous power of God laying in
[1:26:52] God. But it took the WEAKNESS OF
[1:26:53] HUMANITY FOR GOD TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS
[1:26:56] HIS MIRACULOUS POWER. AND FOR it took
[1:26:58] the weakness of our flesh for a miracle
[1:27:00] to be performed. It took a A A DEAD TO
[1:27:03] DIE THAT GOD COULD RAISE THE DEAD. IT
[1:27:05] TOOK A MAN TO be blind that he could
[1:27:07] raise that he could open the BLINDED
[1:27:08] EYES. IT TOOK A MAN THAT WAS LOST THAT
[1:27:10] GOD COULD SAVE HIM. THE MIRACULOUS POWER
[1:27:12] OF GOD. IT TOOK THE WEAKNESS of humanity
[1:27:15] in order to be to be perfected in its
[1:27:18] strength.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I thought, my that's our that's our God.
[1:27:21] Even better, can I tell you this? The
[1:27:23] spirit of God that spoke to Paul, it has
[1:27:25] that quality, that dunamis power of God,
[1:27:28] this miraculous power of God, but it
[1:27:30] didn't remain in God.
[1:27:33] Because that word dunamis when Paul
[1:27:35] preached or or spoke in second Timothy
[1:27:37] he said for God has not given us the
[1:27:39] spirit of fear
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; but of power by the way it was dunamis
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:27:46] mind.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; So that same miraculous power that was
[1:27:50] made perfect in God by your weakness.
[1:27:53] That's the power that Paul's talked
[1:27:55] about when he said and God GAVE YOU NOT
[1:27:57] THE spirit of fear but the but of power
[1:28:00] and of love and of sound mind. And so
[1:28:02] that same miraculous power that was made
[1:28:04] perfect by your WEAKNESS IS THE SAME
[1:28:06] POWER OF GOD THAT WAS POURED INTO THE
[1:28:08] CHURCH. IT WASN'T TO HAVE CONTROL OR TO
[1:28:11] HAVE DOMINION over people or authority
[1:28:13] OVER YOUR FELLOW MAN STUFF LIKE BUT IT
[1:28:15] WAS THE POWER OF GOD. THE DUNAMIS POWER
[1:28:18] OF GOD THAT WAS POURED out of GOD THAT
[1:28:20] WAS POURED INTO the church. Friends, let
[1:28:22] me tell you, God doesn't have that power
[1:28:24] to withhold it in himself because
[1:28:26] dunamis power by definition it was a
[1:28:29] power that is waiting to be exerted. IT
[1:28:31] IS THERE WAITING FOR FOR ITS OPPORTUNITY
[1:28:34] TO EXERT ITSELF. He said SO HE ONLY HAD
[1:28:37] IT SO SO THAT HE COULD MIX IT with our
[1:28:39] weakness so it could be strengthened
[1:28:41] that it might become perfect. And now
[1:28:43] that same power that was residing in God
[1:28:46] is residing in the church.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Said so it was poured out into the
[1:28:49] church. Remember he poured himself into
[1:28:52] Christ. All that was in Christ was
[1:28:53] poured into the church. And now that
[1:28:55] same miraculous power was pulled into
[1:28:57] the poured into the church. That's and
[1:28:59] now that kind of a power I it's waiting
[1:29:02] it's residing in the church waiting for
[1:29:04] an opportunity to be exerted
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; just like it was in God.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, you know what it's
[1:29:10] looking for? It's looking for a weakness
[1:29:11] somewhere that it could exert itself.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; I just love it.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; It's looking for a a failure somewhere
[1:29:18] that it could exert itself. It's the
[1:29:20] power of God that he poured into the
[1:29:21] church. It's looking for a sickness
[1:29:23] somewhere that it could exert itself.
[1:29:25] Why? Because it is a MIRACULOUS POWER.
[1:29:27] IT CAME OUT OF ANOTHER ANOTHER
[1:29:28] DIMENSION. IT WASN'T CREATED IN THESE
[1:29:30] THREE DIMENSIONS. It's the power of God.
[1:29:33] See, that same power is residing in the
[1:29:35] church. See, but notice the
[1:29:36] characteristic of this power is it's
[1:29:38] waiting on an opportunity. And when it's
[1:29:40] opportunity comes, are you ready for it?
[1:29:42] I'm going to hurry and close. But when
[1:29:44] its opportunity comes, it becomes a
[1:29:47] force.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So that very power, it's not just
[1:29:51] sitting there forever, brother Mark.
[1:29:54] It's waiting by by by definition. and
[1:29:56] it's waiting to be exerted.
[1:29:58] And whenever it's exerted, it becomes a
[1:30:00] force. In other words, this miraculous
[1:30:03] power of God that is poured into the the
[1:30:06] believer, it's laying there. It's an
[1:30:07] inherent power. You may not see it with
[1:30:09] a natural eye. It may be like a life
[1:30:12] that's laying in a seed and you can't
[1:30:13] even identify it. And you can look at
[1:30:15] its flesh and you can't identify it
[1:30:16] nowhere, but it's laying in there. It's
[1:30:18] a dunamis power of God. It's laying in
[1:30:20] there residing in there by virtue of its
[1:30:22] nature. how you were created in the
[1:30:24] beginning by your nature. You're a son
[1:30:26] of God. You always was a son of God. And
[1:30:28] that's laying in there waiting to be
[1:30:30] exerted. And when it's exerted, it
[1:30:32] becomes a force in your life. THAT'S WHY
[1:30:35] YOUR LIFE TAKES CHANGE. THAT'S WHY THE
[1:30:37] things of the world, THEY GET SHAKEN OFF
[1:30:39] OF YOU. THAT'S WHY HABITS DISAPPEAR.
[1:30:41] THAT'S WHY OLD HABIT AND OLD PROBLEMS
[1:30:43] AND PROBLEMS WITH THE FLESH. THAT'S WHY
[1:30:45] YOU OVERCOME THEM. AND BEFORE YOU WAS A
[1:30:47] SLAVE TO SIN AND NOW YOU BECOME AN
[1:30:49] OVERCOMER BECAUSE THE MIRACULOUS POWER
[1:30:51] OF GOD HAS BEEN EXERTED IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:30:54] AND FROM THE INSIDE OUT COMES SOMETHING
[1:30:56] THAT'S BUBBLING OUT AND TAKES OVER THE
[1:30:58] FLESH OF A FAILING HUMAN BEING.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It's a miraculous power of God
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; waiting to be exerted forth.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Remember that spring brother walked by.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; He said went down there. He said,
[1:31:10] "Spring, why are you always bubbling?"
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He said went down drink. He said, ' If I
[1:31:15] could just talk to What makes you
[1:31:16] bubble? Is it the cows that drank from
[1:31:17] you? You're bubbling. No, that wasn't
[1:31:19] it. Was it the deer? No, that wasn't it.
[1:31:21] Why are you bubbling all the time? Maybe
[1:31:22] because I drank from you. Maybe you're
[1:31:24] giving life to a human being, the the
[1:31:26] the greatest of God's creation. Is that
[1:31:28] is that is that what it is that caused
[1:31:30] you to bubble? No, that ain't it. He
[1:31:31] said, "Well, what caused you to bubble?"
[1:31:33] He said, "There's something down on the
[1:31:34] inside of me, way deep down that is
[1:31:36] pushing up.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You realize that the surface OF THE
[1:31:39] SPRING DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS.
[1:31:41] there's something way down deep in the
[1:31:43] bedrock of the earth that that is
[1:31:45] pushing us and causing it to come to
[1:31:47] this place. He and brother said that's
[1:31:48] the way it is with a born again
[1:31:49] experience. He said you can't contain it
[1:31:52] because we're not a man-made water tank.
[1:31:54] It's a well of water within you bubbling
[1:31:56] up into everlasting life. He said the
[1:31:58] man-made tank, it'll freeze. They're
[1:32:00] begging for a revival and everything.
[1:32:02] But a man that's under the fountain or
[1:32:04] the living in the fountain, IT'S DAY AND
[1:32:06] NIGHT. HE ain't walking around looking
[1:32:07] to be picked up and looking to be
[1:32:09] revived, dragging him from one church
[1:32:11] service to another. WON'T SOMEBODY SAY
[1:32:13] SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE ME CLAP AND MAKE
[1:32:15] ME SHOUT AND SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING THAT
[1:32:17] CAN MAKE ME FEEL BETTER? I'VE HAD JUST A
[1:32:18] BAD IT AIN'T ALWAYS A BAD WEEK.
[1:32:20] SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD WEEK.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY AT
[1:32:25] WORK. SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DAY
[1:32:27] AT HOME. EVERYTHING AIN'T GOT TO ALWAYS
[1:32:29] BE MULLY grubs and down. EVERYTHING'S
[1:32:31] DOWN AROUND ME. STOP LOOKING TO THE
[1:32:33] NEGATIVE OF EVERYTHING IN your life AND
[1:32:34] LOOK TO THE POSITIVE AND THINK ABOUT
[1:32:36] WHAT GOD'S DONE TODAY. HOW ABOUT GET UP
[1:32:38] IN THE MORNING AND SAY, "GOD, I THANK
[1:32:40] YOU FOR THE BREATH IN MY BODY. I THANK
[1:32:42] YOU FOR THE ABILITY TO GO TO WORK. I
[1:32:44] THANK YOU FOR THE THE FAMILY THAT YOU'RE
[1:32:46] GIVING ME." SOMETIMES IT DON'T HAVE TO
[1:32:48] BE NEGATIVE.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ALWAYS WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT'S
[1:32:51] FALLING APART, BUT WHAT IS GOD DOING?
[1:32:53] HOW GREAT HE IS, HOW WONDERFUL GOD IS.
[1:32:56] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S A REVIVAL
[1:32:58] THAT'S BUBBLING UP IN you all the time.
[1:33:00] He said, "What is it?" He said, "You
[1:33:02] don't have to Can I Can I just finish
[1:33:03] this?" He said, "You don't have to wait
[1:33:05] on local rains and local revivals. You
[1:33:08] don't have to wait on a rain TO COME.
[1:33:09] SOMEBODY DUMP SOME WATER OUT. LET LET
[1:33:11] SOME RAIN COME SO I CAN HAVE SOMETHING
[1:33:13] BUBBLING IN ME." YOU AIN'T WAITING ON
[1:33:14] THAT. HE SAID, "BECAUSE IT DON'T COME
[1:33:16] FROM THE SURFACE. IT CAME FROM THE
[1:33:18] FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THAT'S BUBBLING UP ON
[1:33:20] THE INSIDE. IT'S THE UNADULTERATED WORD
[1:33:22] OF God in your heart AND IN YOUR MOUTH,
[1:33:25] VINDICATING ITSELF AND SPEAKING OUT.
[1:33:28] It don't matter if it's raining or
[1:33:30] snowing.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what it is on the
[1:33:32] surface
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; because it comes from something on the
[1:33:36] inside.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Said it's a hidden power and it secret
[1:33:40] is within it.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so strange to the man in
[1:33:45] the natural world to see a believer
[1:33:47] going through so many things. Glory.
[1:33:49] Isn't God so good? What do you mean
[1:33:51] God's good? Your cars broke down. You
[1:33:53] can't afford your house payment. Your
[1:33:54] dog died. What do you mean God's good?
[1:33:57] It'd be wonderful, God. Why? Because our
[1:34:00] revival don't come from the things that
[1:34:03] take place in this natural world,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; but it's something on the inside.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Said this, it's a hidden power. It
[1:34:09] secret is within it. Said, "And because
[1:34:11] it has that, it gives of itself freely
[1:34:14] to whoever will drink of its substance."
[1:34:17] So, see, so when you get that well
[1:34:18] springing up, you're drinking up by
[1:34:20] there. There's no difference. You'll
[1:34:21] give to anything that comes by.
[1:34:25] you're willing to give the hope of life
[1:34:26] to a Catholic,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; to a Protestant, to a Jew, to an
[1:34:31] atheist, whatever it is, you're really,
[1:34:33] really got something in you that's doing
[1:34:35] it, and you'll give to anything
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; that comes by.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? We're not
[1:34:40] withholding, but we're giving. Said,
[1:34:43] "There's another thing about it. Can I
[1:34:44] tell you one more thing about it?"
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to pump it up.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have to pull on it. You don't
[1:34:52] have to pump it up." He said, he said,
[1:34:54] "I've seen so much of that, it makes me
[1:34:55] sick." Playing a bunch of music, jumping
[1:34:56] up and down, pumping up all the
[1:34:58] literature out of town, talking about
[1:34:59] the man of the hour coming. That there
[1:35:01] ain't but one man of the hour and his
[1:35:02] name is Jesus Christ. He's the same
[1:35:04] yesterday, today, and forever. There is
[1:35:06] only one messenger from God, and his
[1:35:09] name is Jesus Christ. That's what was
[1:35:11] present in this hour. That's what was
[1:35:13] present in the five-fold ministry.
[1:35:15] That's what was present in a prophet of
[1:35:17] God. It was Jesus Christ. That's the
[1:35:19] ministry that we're here to promote.
[1:35:21] that he's present in this hour. That he
[1:35:23] ain't a dead God 2,000 years ago. But
[1:35:26] we're proving the resurrection OF JESUS
[1:35:28] CHRIST BY PREACHING THE VERY MESSAGE OF
[1:35:30] THE HOUR THAT WAS A VINDICATION OF THE
[1:35:32] RESURRECTION OF Christ Jesus. Said, I'm
[1:35:35] living. I'm the fountain of living
[1:35:37] water. We're living under this fountain.
[1:35:40] There's something in it that's causing
[1:35:42] it to bubble up as the music players
[1:35:44] want to come. You think about a spring.
[1:35:46] You know what happens in a spring? Down
[1:35:48] in the bottom of that spring, can I just
[1:35:50] read this to you? in the bottom of that
[1:35:52] spring that there's a heat and pressure
[1:35:54] in the bedrock of the earth and that
[1:35:56] carbon dioxide it adds into the water
[1:35:58] and the quantity of carbon dioxide is
[1:36:00] above saturation level at surface and so
[1:36:02] at surface because there's more carbon
[1:36:04] dioxide down there when it gets to
[1:36:06] surface it makes a bubble you know when
[1:36:08] it comes to atmospheric pressure so it's
[1:36:10] under pressure way down here and as it's
[1:36:12] creating something within it when it
[1:36:14] comes to atmospheric pressure can I just
[1:36:16] say the surface when it comes to the
[1:36:18] surface that which was within becomes
[1:36:20] evident
[1:36:21] on the you wouldn't know the carbon
[1:36:22] dioxide was in there underneath you may
[1:36:25] not ever see it but when it comes to
[1:36:26] that surface or under atmospheric
[1:36:28] pressure all of a sudden it expresses
[1:36:30] itself
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; it just pops right up there on the top
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; it's expressed on the surface and the
[1:36:35] result is bubbles and I love this it's
[1:36:38] it's bubbles in in in in the form of
[1:36:42] semi-persistent effervescence
[1:36:44] which means with vivacity
[1:36:47] and enthusiasm
[1:36:49] on the surface is public with
[1:36:52] enthusiasm.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That ain't what a spring looks like.
[1:36:58] Drink if you want it.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; That's a stagnated pond.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; But we're not talking about stagnated
[1:37:04] ponds. We're talking about something
[1:37:05] that has life on the inside. It's
[1:37:06] pumping up. It's bubbling up. You let me
[1:37:09] tell you the best part about a spring.
[1:37:11] There's nothing you can do to the
[1:37:12] surface of it that can change what it's
[1:37:14] doing.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you do to it. The
[1:37:18] bubbles are going to come up. You can
[1:37:19] block them over here. They're going to
[1:37:20] come up over here. You can put their
[1:37:22] hand down over here, don't you? And
[1:37:24] they're going to hum up over here. You
[1:37:25] can't worship God in this church.
[1:37:26] They're going to go somewhere else and
[1:37:27] worship God. You can't cope. You can't
[1:37:29] keep a bubble down
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; because there's something on the inside
[1:37:32] of it that is looking for a way
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; to express what is growing.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; There's something way down in there.
[1:37:39] There's a pressure.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; There's a burning.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; No matter what you do, you can hit it
[1:37:44] with sticks, it'll keep bubbling.
[1:37:46] You can throw dirt on it, it'll keep
[1:37:48] bubbling.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You can talk about it, it'll bubble. You
[1:37:50] can make fun of it, it'll bubble. No
[1:37:52] matter what you do to it, it's bubbling.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Because the bubble didn't come from the
[1:37:56] surface.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; It came from way down,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; far beyond your ability to even reach.
[1:38:05] In the core,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; in the core of the earth, where the
[1:38:10] temperature is so extreme, there's a
[1:38:12] fire burning. And in that core of that
[1:38:15] burning fire, something is created and
[1:38:18] heat and pressure begins to [music]
[1:38:20] build this and it works its way to the
[1:38:22] surface. That's what's happening in you.
[1:38:26] Way down in the core, sometimes it's so
[1:38:28] far beyond the surface, you'd think it's
[1:38:29] never going to happen. You look at some
[1:38:32] people, it'll never happen. But way down
[1:38:34] in the core, there's something there
[1:38:38] far beyond our ability to see, there's a
[1:38:40] fire that's burning.
[1:38:42] And you know what happens? The more heat
[1:38:44] it goes through, the more fire it goes
[1:38:46] through, the more it bubbles.
[1:38:49] The more it's created, so it doesn't
[1:38:51] matter how much the devil don't know
[1:38:52] what to do with it. No matter how much
[1:38:54] he puts on it, the it bubbles the more.
[1:38:57] You know why? There's something in you.
[1:38:59] So what is it? It's the power of
[1:39:01] almighty God, the creator of heaven and
[1:39:04] earth. And the more pressure that you
[1:39:07] have, but John, the more you overcome.
[1:39:10] Can I say it like this? The more of my
[1:39:12] weakness that I give to Jesus, the more
[1:39:15] power that I have. The more of my
[1:39:17] weakness I give to Jesus, the more
[1:39:19] victory that I have. The more of my
[1:39:21] weakness I give to Jesus, the more joy
[1:39:23] that I have. Friends, I got news for
[1:39:25] you. We're not a powerless people.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; You're not a powerless person. You're
[1:39:29] not a powerless church. But God's people
[1:39:31] are a powerful people.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And their power don't come. It's not
[1:39:35] created in this world. It's not created
[1:39:38] in these dimensions. I know we may feel
[1:39:39] that way. We feel like we're weak in the
[1:39:41] flesh and we're limited in our abilities
[1:39:43] and we're bound by these these five
[1:39:45] senses and everything around us. We're
[1:39:46] so bound by it because that's the
[1:39:48] dimension that we live in. But you know
[1:39:49] what happens when God gets a hold of
[1:39:52] you?
[1:39:53] You know what happens? You remember you
[1:39:55] remember what happened with David when
[1:39:56] he went down there. Won't you stand to
[1:39:58] your feet? He went down there to that
[1:39:59] that battle of Goliath and
[1:40:03] he went he went down to the brook and he
[1:40:05] took those five stones and walked down
[1:40:07] and that great giant stood there before
[1:40:09] the people of God and and David took one
[1:40:11] of those stones and he put it in his
[1:40:13] sling and he whirled it around and he
[1:40:15] slung it at that big old giant
[1:40:18] said and the Holy Ghost got a hold of
[1:40:19] that stone.
[1:40:21] Man said it don't matter how weak you
[1:40:23] are it was just a stone. We did a play
[1:40:24] down at at Louisiana camp one time when
[1:40:26] I was young, when I was just a boy. And
[1:40:28] uh I I got to come back home. I said,
[1:40:30] "Mom, I was in the play." She said, "Oh,
[1:40:32] good." "Well," I said, "Well, it was a
[1:40:33] play of David and Goliath." She said,
[1:40:35] "Well, which one was you? I get I bet
[1:40:36] you was David." I went, "No, I was the
[1:40:38] rock." She said, "The rock." I said,
[1:40:40] "Yeah, there had to be a Goliath. There
[1:40:41] had to be a David. There had to be a
[1:40:43] stone. I was the smallest guy in there.
[1:40:45] So, I got to be the stone." And they
[1:40:46] threw me at Goliath and I took him down.
[1:40:48] I thought, "You know what? That's way
[1:40:50] that's what brother Bam said. He said
[1:40:51] whenever David threw that that stone, he
[1:40:53] said the Holy Ghost got a hold of that
[1:40:55] stone.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, when the Holy Ghost got
[1:40:57] a hold of it, it went a million miles a
[1:40:59] minute. You know why? Because it went
[1:41:01] into another dimension. The Holy Ghost
[1:41:03] don't come from this dimension. It took
[1:41:05] it into another dimension that's not
[1:41:06] conflicted by time. And it took it to a
[1:41:08] speed that it didn't matter where it hit
[1:41:10] the giant AT IT. IT'S FAST AND IT'S
[1:41:12] ACCURATE. AND IT ALWAYS HITS ITS mark
[1:41:15] because the Holy Ghost got a hold of
[1:41:17] that stone. That means it don't matter
[1:41:18] how big you are. It don't matter how
[1:41:20] little you are. The only thing that
[1:41:22] matters is that the Holy Ghost gets a
[1:41:23] hold of you. Friends, let me tell you,
[1:41:25] whenever God gets a hold of you and the
[1:41:27] Holy Ghost gets a hold of you, the same
[1:41:29] thing that happened to David stone is
[1:41:31] the same thing that'll happen to you.
[1:41:32] When the Holy Ghost gets a hold of
[1:41:34] something, it changes its limitations in
[1:41:36] this natural world.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Before the Holy Ghost, you was limited
[1:41:41] in your worship. You was limited in
[1:41:43] saying amen. You was limited in coming
[1:41:45] to church. You was limited in serving
[1:41:48] God. But when the Holy Ghost got a hold
[1:41:49] of you, it changed your limitations
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden now I've had people
[1:41:54] come in church, I I ain't going to raise
[1:41:55] my hand, but I'll come to church with
[1:41:57] you. And now, Brother Charles, his hands
[1:41:58] raised. He just praises God. He don't
[1:42:00] care to say amen. WHY? BECAUSE THE HOLY
[1:42:03] GHOST got a hold of him.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And before HE WAS QUIET, SAID THERE,
[1:42:06] WELL, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT
[1:42:08] I'M NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED LIKE THAT.
[1:42:09] BUT WHEN SOMETHING GOT A HOLD OF YOU, IT
[1:42:11] CHANGES THE WAY YOU WORSHIP BECAUSE IT
[1:42:13] CHANGED YOUR LIMITATION.
[1:42:15] We're not limited by the gravity,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; the things of this natural world, this
[1:42:20] three-dimensional world. And we're not
[1:42:22] limited by it because because the Holy
[1:42:24] Ghost got a hold of us and it took us
[1:42:27] into another dimension.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; That's where God brings us when you come
[1:42:30] in the house of God. That's the
[1:42:32] atmosphere that's being created in this
[1:42:34] building. It's an atmosphere in another
[1:42:36] dimension. And if you could open your
[1:42:38] eyes and see into that world where the
[1:42:39] angels of God are encamped about us in
[1:42:42] another dimension. I thought my but if
[1:42:45] God
[1:42:47] a king like David a natural king could
[1:42:51] have a stone that he could throw that
[1:42:52] the Holy Ghost could get out in that way
[1:42:54] then what about the son of David the one
[1:42:57] that was called son of David that was
[1:42:58] the king of kings. Oh don't think that
[1:43:01] he don't have a satchel full of stones
[1:43:02] too. You can find one bag of them over
[1:43:04] in Ephesians 4. There was a prophet and
[1:43:06] a apostle and a teacher, an evangelist
[1:43:08] and a and a pastor, they're God's
[1:43:11] stones. And he don't think that the Holy
[1:43:13] Ghost when he whenever he gets a old
[1:43:15] giant come into the church that God
[1:43:17] can't pick one of them stones up and he
[1:43:19] can he can whoop it out there across the
[1:43:21] building and the Holy Ghost get a hold
[1:43:22] of it and he don't even know what he's
[1:43:24] saying, but the Holy Ghost got a hold of
[1:43:26] it and goes into another dimension and
[1:43:27] it'll tear down every giant in your life
[1:43:29] just like it did in David's life.
[1:43:32] He ain't the only one that had the
[1:43:34] stones in his satchel. That's what
[1:43:36] brother Brown mean you you remember I I
[1:43:38] ran out of time preaching this.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandham was
[1:43:41] in the Houston Coliseum and they were
[1:43:43] debating on divine healing and all that.
[1:43:45] He said he was sitting up in the balcony
[1:43:47] and they were up there debating brother
[1:43:48] best and was saying he didn't believe in
[1:43:50] all that and all these meetings were
[1:43:52] fake. And then finally brother Bosworth
[1:43:54] said, "Well, brother Bam's here in the
[1:43:55] building somewhere. If he wants to come
[1:43:57] down and speak, he can. It's up to him.
[1:43:59] I'm not going to tell you where he is."
[1:44:00] thousands of people sitting in the
[1:44:02] building. And brother Bam said, "I was
[1:44:04] just sitting there." He said, "And
[1:44:06] something just picked me up."
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I thought, "What was it?" It was a
[1:44:11] stone. He's a stone in the hand of a
[1:44:14] king.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "When it picked me up, what?"
[1:44:17] It ain't no different than David
[1:44:18] reaching down there in his satchel.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't a natural king. It was the
[1:44:21] king of kings.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; He reached way down in his satchel and
[1:44:24] he picked one up.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "When he picked me up, he said,
[1:44:27] I just knew I was to go forward. I
[1:44:30] thought that's the way it is with us.
[1:44:31] You know what happened when he walked
[1:44:32] down there? They took the photo and the
[1:44:34] in the pillar of fire was present in the
[1:44:36] picture. I said, "That's the same thing
[1:44:38] that happens with us. Sometimes you
[1:44:39] don't feel like saying anything.
[1:44:40] Sometimes you don't feel like worshiping
[1:44:42] God. Sometimes you don't feel like
[1:44:43] raising your hand, but all of a sudden
[1:44:45] there's something. You don't know why it
[1:44:46] is, but you're just sitting there in in
[1:44:48] the presence of God moving around you.
[1:44:50] And all of a sudden, something just
[1:44:51] picks you up. Something just lift your
[1:44:53] hand." Said, "But I know one thing that
[1:44:55] when he picks you up, I know that I must
[1:44:57] GO FORWARD. I KNOW I MUST I MUST SAY
[1:45:00] AMEN. I MUST PRAISE MY GOD. I MUST GIVE
[1:45:02] HIM WORSHIP. GOD WANTS TO USE YOU THIS
[1:45:05] MORNING.

[1:53:13] So Lord, I lift my voice to worship. I
[1:53:17] want to magnify your name. For you are
[1:53:21] great.
[1:53:23] You [music] do miracles [singing]

[1:54:28] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[1:54:30] clap of praise? How many say he's great?
[1:54:34] How many just love to worship the Lord?
[1:54:37] Amen. Amen. And what a wonderful God
[1:54:41] that we serve.
[1:54:44] But said, "What we need is a Holy Ghost
[1:54:46] atmosphere, an atmosphere where the
[1:54:49] power of God's moving in one accord in
[1:54:51] one place. Gathered together under that
[1:54:54] atmosphere of expecting God to move down
[1:54:56] signs [music] and wonders. Let's move
[1:54:59] oursel up into that bracket. Step up in
[1:55:02] faith and out of these three dimensions
[1:55:06] and up into the next one.
[1:55:08] Amen. I don't believe we have to be
[1:55:10] bound by the dimensions of this earthly
[1:55:14] world or the seen things or the
[1:55:18] challenges of this flesh. We don't have
[1:55:20] to be bound by those things. That's why
[1:55:22] Paul said, "We are now living in
[1:55:25] heavenly places [music] in Christ
[1:55:27] Jesus." There's another realm, another
[1:55:29] place that you can live being
[1:55:31] entertained by angels. Isn't that where
[1:55:35] the prophet went that day? and the the
[1:55:38] angels came and entertained and the that
[1:55:41] God sent birds to feed and that's not a
[1:55:45] that that's getting into another
[1:55:46] dimension. Amen. I believe that God is
[1:55:49] calling the church out of the confines
[1:55:51] of this natural world into the unlimited
[1:55:56] power
[1:55:58] of a new dimension or of another
[1:56:00] dimension. It's a new reality to the
[1:56:03] believer. And Paul said it comes by
[1:56:05] faith.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given. How many believe that
[1:56:08] this morning? [music] Amen. You don't
[1:56:10] have to be confined by it. When that old
[1:56:12] devil comes around, say, you know what,
[1:56:14] you old fifth dimension walker, you you
[1:56:17] I know where you came from, and I know
[1:56:19] where you're going back to.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; But I ain't going to be bound by that.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; There's another dimensions even higher
[1:56:24] than that.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a far off. It's just like
[1:56:28] walking through a door right in the
[1:56:30] world that you live in. Amen. And I just
[1:56:32] say invite the presence of God into our
[1:56:35] life. Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[1:56:37] Gracious heavenly father. Lord, we thank
[1:56:40] you Lord for your spirit here this
[1:56:41] morning.
[1:56:44] God, that's a desire that we have as
[1:56:47] believers, Lord. And God, to be able to
[1:56:51] move out of this world and the pressures
[1:56:54] and things of this life, Lord. That's
[1:56:55] the the great thing of of serving you,
[1:56:58] Lord, is God that you've lifted us up
[1:57:01] above those things, Lord. So many times
[1:57:04] through the scripture, Lord, that we
[1:57:06] could find and God to bring the church
[1:57:09] up or to lift her up into a higher
[1:57:11] power,
[1:57:13] Lord, into a place of victory. Lord, we
[1:57:15] realize that our victory lies in that
[1:57:17] dimension. God, it don't lie in our
[1:57:21] things that we accomplish, our accomp
[1:57:23] accomplishments in this flesh, but Lord,
[1:57:26] it's a spiritual accomplishment, Lord.
[1:57:28] God, it comes from surrendering to your
[1:57:30] will and entering into a heavenly
[1:57:33] atmosphere. Lord, I pray for the church
[1:57:36] this morning, God. I just pray Lord that
[1:57:38] that desire would be on every heart God
[1:57:41] that the very thing that's within them
[1:57:43] Lord the deep that calls to the deep God
[1:57:45] it would be drawn into that atmosphere
[1:57:47] Lord and God that we'd just be caught in
[1:57:50] the middle Lord in the in the middle of
[1:57:53] a responding to a call Lord may our
[1:57:55] natural life Lord just be caught up in
[1:57:57] the middle of it all Lord God and just
[1:58:00] reflect the the heavenly move in our
[1:58:03] life God I pray you'd go with each one
[1:58:05] as we go from this place Lord let the
[1:58:07] revival of God burn in their heart.
[1:58:09] Lord, that we would come back into this
[1:58:11] building on Wednesday night. Lord, just
[1:58:13] come back under the spirit of worship
[1:58:15] and spirit of expectation. God, we just
[1:58:18] pray you'd keep your hand upon each one
[1:58:20] as we go from this place. Those that are
[1:58:21] traveling, Lord, on their vacations,
[1:58:23] Lord, I pray you'd bring them home
[1:58:25] safely. [music] We ask these things in
[1:58:27] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:58:31] this morning as you go.
[1:58:37] My anchor holds [singing]
[1:58:43] when the ship
[1:58:46] is battered.
[1:58:52] My anchor holds
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; even when [singing]
[1:59:04] I say many times
[1:59:08] [singing]
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I've fallen on
[1:59:12] my knees
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; when I face
[1:59:19] the raging seas.
[1:59:21] But I had an anchor
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; that still holds.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; In spite of a storm,
[1:59:36] I say [singing] my anor still holds.
[1:59:43] Even when my sheep [singing]

[1:59:51] Yes, my anchor
[1:59:54] holds
[1:59:57] even when the sails
[2:00:01] are torn.
[2:00:08] I have fallen
[2:00:11] on my knees.
[2:00:14] [singing]
[2:00:15] As I face
[2:00:18] [music] the raging sea,
[2:00:22] the anchor holds
[2:00:29] [music] in spite of the storm.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, my anor
[2:00:43] even when my ship is better
[2:00:48] [singing]
[2:00:50] or my anchor
[2:00:53] hold
[2:00:58] though my [singing] sails are torn.
[2:01:06] I have fallen
[2:01:10] on my knees
[2:01:14] as I face
[2:01:17] a [music] raging [singing] sea.
[2:01:21] The anchor holds
[2:01:27] in spite
[2:01:29] of [music] the storm.
