[1:02:05] for my expectation
[1:02:07] is
[1:02:08] from him
[1:02:10] david here is not writing about his
[1:02:11] flesh or his spirit he's writing about
[1:02:13] his soul
[1:02:14] my soul wait thou only upon god
[1:02:17] for my expectation
[1:02:19] is from him also i would like to look in
[1:02:22] the book of second corinthians the fifth
[1:02:23] chapter
[1:02:25] second corinthians the fifth chapter
[1:02:28] i've got a few verses there i'd like to
[1:02:29] read this evening second corinthians 5
[1:02:32] and verse 16.
[1:02:35] you love the lord this evening
[1:02:38] amen the bible here says paul writing
[1:02:41] he says wherefore henceforth know
[1:02:43] we know man after the flesh
[1:02:46] yea though we have known christ after
[1:02:48] the flesh
[1:02:49] yet henceforth now we know him
[1:02:52] know we him no more
[1:02:54] and therefore if any man be in christ
[1:02:57] somebody say christ
[1:02:59] he is a new creature
[1:03:01] old things are passed away
[1:03:03] and behold all things are become new
[1:03:06] and all things are of god who hath
[1:03:08] reconciled us to himself
[1:03:11] by jesus christ
[1:03:12] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:03:14] reconciliation
[1:03:16] to wit that god was in christ
[1:03:19] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:03:22] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:03:24] and hath committed unto us the word of
[1:03:27] reconciliation
[1:03:28] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:03:31] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:03:33] pray you in christ's stead be you
[1:03:36] reconciled to god for he hath made him
[1:03:39] to be sin for us
[1:03:41] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:03:44] the righteousness of god
[1:03:46] in him we ask the lord this evening to
[1:03:48] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:03:50] word as you can be seated this afternoon
[1:03:53] from those scriptures tonight for just a
[1:03:56] few moments i would like to speak to you
[1:03:57] on the fault of expecting a renewing of
[1:04:00] our experience
[1:04:02] expecting a renewing of our experience
[1:04:04] and we're all
[1:04:05] very well aware that the prophet of god
[1:04:08] told us that we get
[1:04:09] what we expect right if we're expecting
[1:04:12] good things we're going to receive good
[1:04:14] things if we're expecting bad things
[1:04:16] we're going to receive bad things and
[1:04:18] brother branham preaches the message
[1:04:19] expectations many many times but
[1:04:21] actually i was just listening this week
[1:04:23] to when he preached it down in
[1:04:24] jonesborough 1953 he said now brother
[1:04:28] have you lived around arkansas here
[1:04:30] about all your life in a discernment i
[1:04:31] suppose he said well that's fine now
[1:04:33] it's 50 years that's a great state he
[1:04:35] said everywhere i went in the world
[1:04:37] nearly i found somebody look like from
[1:04:39] arkansas he said i say this one thing he
[1:04:42] says the arkansas people i don't say
[1:04:44] this because i'm before this microphone
[1:04:46] but the angel of the lord is here at
[1:04:48] this platform i have never found in the
[1:04:51] world he says any nicer more faithful
[1:04:53] and lovely people than comes out of the
[1:04:56] state of arkansas because one thing
[1:04:58] they're not the richest people of the
[1:05:00] world but they still got the old
[1:05:01] american traits of believing god and
[1:05:04] living right amen believe in god and
[1:05:07] living right brother called that two
[1:05:09] american traits and to think tonight
[1:05:11] amen that at that time america was more
[1:05:14] of a christian nation than it is today
[1:05:16] amen but i'm so glad tonight to be
[1:05:18] gathered here with a group of believers
[1:05:20] amen that are actually still fulfilling
[1:05:23] what a prophet said so many many years
[1:05:25] ago in this building tonight amen is not
[1:05:28] the not the richest people and not the
[1:05:30] most famous people amen but in this
[1:05:32] building tonight is a group of people
[1:05:34] who still believes god and they're still
[1:05:36] living right in the face of every devil
[1:05:39] they still believe god in the face of
[1:05:40] every unbelieving spirit they still
[1:05:42] believe god and there's still a desire
[1:05:45] amen to live for him and to live right
[1:05:47] then when i think of how at this church
[1:05:49] as we gather here this weekend amen for
[1:05:51] a dedication meeting i'll say it like
[1:05:53] this amen that man has not raised up
[1:05:56] grace tabernacle amen an organization
[1:05:58] has not raised up grace tabernacle but
[1:06:01] god himself amen the same god that
[1:06:03] raised up solomon's temple and the same
[1:06:05] god amen that established the ark of the
[1:06:08] covenant is the same god amen that has
[1:06:10] raised up grace tabernacle amen and it's
[1:06:12] not just a church it's not just a
[1:06:14] gathering of people amen but it is a
[1:06:17] church of vision for its fulfilling
[1:06:18] scripture amen where the bible says
[1:06:20] where there is no vision amen the people
[1:06:23] perish but he that keepeth the law amen
[1:06:26] happy is he now the prophet of god will
[1:06:28] say this in a personal experience with
[1:06:30] god if anything the church needs tonight
[1:06:33] and what we're trying to do friends is
[1:06:35] to bring a fresh vision from the
[1:06:37] presence of god to let the people see
[1:06:40] that god still lives amen and reigns and
[1:06:43] is moving with his church and he will
[1:06:45] amen until jesus comes amen how many
[1:06:48] believes god is still alive how many
[1:06:50] believes that god is still moving amen
[1:06:52] how many believes that god is still
[1:06:54] reigning they've been right here in a
[1:06:56] wicked and adulterous generation when
[1:06:58] they have forsaken the things of god
[1:07:00] amen there is a group of people here
[1:07:02] tonight amen that are witnesses that god
[1:07:04] is a reality he is alive and well the
[1:07:07] same god amen that said let there be is
[1:07:10] the same god that is in this field and
[1:07:12] amen the same god that went by blind
[1:07:14] bartimaeus it's the same god amen that's
[1:07:16] in this building tonight the same god
[1:07:19] and forgive the woman at the well is the
[1:07:21] same god that is in this building
[1:07:23] tonight he has not changed he still
[1:07:26] remains a god of reality then as we're
[1:07:28] here tonight there is a hunger amen
[1:07:31] there is a thirst the prophet said it
[1:07:32] this way he said i'm thanking thee
[1:07:34] father first to be alive here tonight he
[1:07:36] said oh how satan would desire amen to
[1:07:39] take us quickly from the scene right in
[1:07:42] the midst of the battle amen but the
[1:07:44] angels are encamped about those amen who
[1:07:47] fear him and we are thankful for this
[1:07:49] and i am so glad for a fresh experience
[1:07:52] of knowing amen the reality of his
[1:07:55] promise that then the promises of god
[1:07:57] tonight are not just scriptures they're
[1:07:59] not just quotes amen they're not just
[1:08:02] things that you hear a preacher say amen
[1:08:04] but the promises of god are a reality
[1:08:07] god is not looking for somebody amen to
[1:08:10] rewrite the promises he is not looking
[1:08:12] for somebody amen to explain the
[1:08:14] promises he is looking for somebody who
[1:08:17] will believe the promises and surrender
[1:08:20] their hearts to god and allow the
[1:08:22] promises to become manifested in their
[1:08:24] flesh amen then there is a promise
[1:08:27] tonight amen that every man woman boy
[1:08:29] and girl can't have he meant an
[1:08:31] experience with the living god in the
[1:08:33] message the rapture he says i think amen
[1:08:36] they didn't speak and i don't want to
[1:08:37] get up here and just say something as i
[1:08:39] as i feel led to say it that i think
[1:08:41] would be a help to you amen i want to
[1:08:43] say something that would further your
[1:08:45] experience with god he said that if you
[1:08:48] are a christian and if you're not a
[1:08:50] christian would make you so ashamed of
[1:08:52] yourself amen that you would become a
[1:08:54] christian see that's the purpose that
[1:08:56] i've always tried to line my thoughts up
[1:08:58] with amen then tonight we are not
[1:09:00] gathered here as church members amen we
[1:09:03] are not gathered here as just religious
[1:09:05] people amen but we are gathered here as
[1:09:07] christians amen which are the children
[1:09:10] of god amen not by denomination not by
[1:09:13] title amen but by an experience see we
[1:09:16] are not the grandchildren of god amen we
[1:09:18] are the children of the living god
[1:09:20] that's why john would say beloved amen i
[1:09:23] love this he didn't say brother david in
[1:09:24] the future he didn't say someday coming
[1:09:27] he said but beloved now are we the sons
[1:09:30] of god and it does not yet appear what
[1:09:32] we shall be amen but we know that he
[1:09:35] shall appear amen we shall be like him
[1:09:38] for we shall see him as he is the
[1:09:41] prophet said one thing i find amen the
[1:09:43] greatest hindrance among us is that
[1:09:45] you're trying to place the things of god
[1:09:47] way out there yet to come he said when
[1:09:49] you're right in the middle of it now
[1:09:52] amen listen revival is not coming amen
[1:09:54] tomorrow night or saturday night or
[1:09:56] sunday morning revival is here right now
[1:10:00] your deliverance is not coming in the
[1:10:01] future it is here right now your miracle
[1:10:04] is not coming in the future it is here
[1:10:07] right now your breakthrough is not
[1:10:08] coming in the future it is here right
[1:10:11] now we are not going to be victorious we
[1:10:14] are victorious we are not going to be
[1:10:16] overcomers we are overcomers and to
[1:10:19] think tonight these things are not in
[1:10:21] the future amen the prophet said we are
[1:10:23] now in the holy ghost age we are now
[1:10:26] sons of god we are now seated together
[1:10:30] in heavenly places
[1:10:32] not we will be but we are now this
[1:10:35] afternoon right here now somebody say
[1:10:39] that with me right here now amen not
[1:10:42] tomorrow night not two weeks off but
[1:10:44] right here now we are the sons and
[1:10:46] daughters of god they've been seated
[1:10:48] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:10:51] jesus he said see all things are
[1:10:54] possible being how many beliefs tonight
[1:10:56] that all things are possible right now
[1:10:59] they make many claim today to be the
[1:11:01] children of god while they're putting
[1:11:03] the promises off in the future while
[1:11:05] they're looking for something to come
[1:11:07] amen people sit on pews amen as
[1:11:09] half-born children amen as part born
[1:11:12] children but the prophet said we cannot
[1:11:14] go in on papa's experience we cannot go
[1:11:16] in on mama's experience he meant you've
[1:11:19] got to have your own experience amen
[1:11:22] this is what their birth was you have to
[1:11:24] have a birth too he said you're a
[1:11:26] grandchild amen until you're born of the
[1:11:30] spirit of god amen then you become a
[1:11:32] child amen now as we begin to look at
[1:11:34] this tonight we realize there's many
[1:11:36] things in our natural life that has to
[1:11:39] be renewed can you say amen amen there's
[1:11:41] many materialistic things that has to be
[1:11:44] renewed we have to renew our insurance
[1:11:46] policy we have to renew our driver's
[1:11:48] license right we have to renew different
[1:11:51] contracts amen the world is constantly
[1:11:53] asking for us to renew something amen
[1:11:56] but let me say this we are not
[1:11:58] necessarily gathered here amen just to
[1:12:00] renew old friendships we're not just
[1:12:02] gathering here to renew amen ideas about
[1:12:05] the message we have come here tonight
[1:12:07] amen to renew our experience amen not in
[1:12:10] a historical god amen and not a god that
[1:12:13] was or a god that will be amen brother
[1:12:15] wayne but a god that is here right now
[1:12:18] he's been present to do exceedingly and
[1:12:20] abundantly above all that we could ever
[1:12:22] ask or thank amen let me set this way
[1:12:24] we're not here amen just to renew our
[1:12:26] church experience amen i know there's
[1:12:28] many people that's had bad church
[1:12:30] experiences amen but let me just go and
[1:12:32] tell you right now amen you might have
[1:12:34] had a bad church experience amen but no
[1:12:37] one and hear me well amen no one has
[1:12:39] ever had a bad experience with christ

[1:12:45] experiences with churches you may have
[1:12:47] had a lot of bad experiences with church
[1:12:48] people you may have a lot of bad
[1:12:50] experiences everywhere amen but i have
[1:12:52] searched my bible amen i have searched
[1:12:54] the message amen and i have yet to find
[1:12:57] one person that ever had a bad
[1:12:59] experience with jesus christ you know
[1:13:01] why amen because he is the power of god
[1:13:04] he is the deliverance he is the joy amen
[1:13:06] won't we just go ahead tonight and lay
[1:13:08] the red carpet out and say lord you're
[1:13:11] the unseen guest but become the visible
[1:13:13] cast we don't just want to hear a bunch
[1:13:15] of sermons we want an experience amen
[1:13:17] when we leave here we want an experience
[1:13:20] we want more than just an idea we want
[1:13:22] something burning in the depths of our
[1:13:24] soul brother brown said it this way he
[1:13:26] said we're getting people to church and
[1:13:29] not to christ amen i'm going to cut the
[1:13:31] devil's head off here right now he never
[1:13:33] said we are getting the people to the
[1:13:35] message and not to christ go read the
[1:13:37] quote more and more i am made to believe
[1:13:39] amen that people are not getting to
[1:13:41] christ amen i believe that's the enemy
[1:13:43] that's thrown this hindrance amen
[1:13:45] because the reason i believe this is he
[1:13:47] is not the object that they have been
[1:13:49] pointed to amen grace tabernacle you can
[1:13:52] testify amen that since the first bible
[1:13:55] study amen or the first service you was
[1:13:57] here you've never been pointed to a man
[1:13:59] you've never been pointed to a
[1:14:01] denomination you've never been pointed
[1:14:03] to a creed amen but service in amen in
[1:14:06] service now you have been pointed to
[1:14:08] jesus christ the prophet said they've
[1:14:10] been pointed to a dogma
[1:14:13] they've been pointed to a doctrine
[1:14:14] they've been pointed to a party they've
[1:14:16] been pointed to an experience or a
[1:14:18] sensation he said instead of being
[1:14:20] pointed to christ the word he said and
[1:14:23] their action and the life they live
[1:14:25] without christ ain't been proves in
[1:14:27] their own life is vindicated by the very
[1:14:30] thing amen now you may be saying i've
[1:14:32] heard about a man named william branham
[1:14:34] i've heard about a message of the hour
[1:14:35] amen what is the message what is the
[1:14:37] point in it the prophet said the very
[1:14:40] essence of the message that was sent
[1:14:42] amen that he is risen from the dead amen
[1:14:46] from 47 to 65 the very essence of
[1:14:49] everything you will hear is he is risen
[1:14:52] from the dead and we are his
[1:14:54] beneficiaries who share in the
[1:14:57] resurrection with him we are drawing
[1:14:59] benefits from him amen not a tradition
[1:15:02] of a man amen said i'm afraid that too
[1:15:04] many of us amen here it is again are not
[1:15:07] getting people to christ we're getting
[1:15:09] them to a church amen to a theory but we
[1:15:12] must get them to christ he is the only
[1:15:15] one the only one that has life he that
[1:15:17] has the son has life amen in the life of
[1:15:20] a man that's dead be projected in you
[1:15:23] you will live the same life that he
[1:15:26] lived amen let me say this tonight there
[1:15:29] are amen not beneficiaries coming amen
[1:15:32] there's beneficiaries here tonight who
[1:15:35] are not just going to benefit amen from
[1:15:37] his resurrection in the future amen but
[1:15:40] they're benefiting from his resurrection
[1:15:42] amen right here tonight yes sir there is
[1:15:44] a amen there is a truth here it's not a
[1:15:47] man it's not a church that truth is
[1:15:49] jesus christ amen you know as well as i
[1:15:52] do amen that truth begets truth right
[1:15:54] amen truth birth is truth amen false
[1:15:57] birth false amen a true prophet amen
[1:16:00] will bring true words amen a false
[1:16:02] prophet will bring false words and the
[1:16:04] bible says it this way i am the way i am
[1:16:07] the truth i am the life and no man
[1:16:09] cometh unto the father amen but by me
[1:16:13] then may i go on record and say tonight
[1:16:15] the words of william branham were not
[1:16:18] false words they were not words of
[1:16:20] imagination amen they were the words of
[1:16:22] truth how can you say they were the
[1:16:24] words of truth amen because of where
[1:16:26] they were coming from they were not
[1:16:28] coming from a seminary they were not
[1:16:30] coming from a denomination amen the word
[1:16:32] brother david was coming from the throne
[1:16:34] room amen of the almighty god himself oh
[1:16:37] come on church amen not for one moment
[1:16:39] do i bring a message to the people that
[1:16:41] they may follow me i'm laying a
[1:16:43] foundation we're going to get this house
[1:16:44] built quick okay amen
[1:16:46] they may follow me or join my church i
[1:16:49] have never done that and i will not do
[1:16:51] that now amen i am here to accomplish
[1:16:53] one thing and that thing is to see amen
[1:16:56] a true established relationship between
[1:17:00] god and man amen wherein men become new
[1:17:03] creations in christ he's been filled
[1:17:06] with his spirit and live according to
[1:17:09] his word amen now let's have some church
[1:17:11] here for a minute amen because that's
[1:17:13] what grace tabernacle is full of amen is
[1:17:16] full of men women boys and girls who
[1:17:18] have met not a church they've not met a
[1:17:20] theory amen but they met a person named
[1:17:22] jesus christ and they were baptized in
[1:17:25] his name and then they've been washed by
[1:17:27] his blood their new creation oh god i
[1:17:30] can't contain myself they're new
[1:17:32] creations they've been believing god and
[1:17:34] living right amen i pray that brother
[1:17:36] branham can look over the banister
[1:17:38] tonight he can look in this meeting and
[1:17:41] say just a few miles down the road i
[1:17:43] said there was some real people that
[1:17:45] believed god amen that lived right and
[1:17:47] here you are tonight not in relationship
[1:17:50] with a man in relationship with christ
[1:17:53] who is our experience
[1:17:56] that's why the bible said if any man be
[1:17:58] in christ he is a new creature all
[1:18:00] things are passed away and behold all
[1:18:02] things are become new in the message you
[1:18:05] must be born again he said the true word
[1:18:07] comes to the true prophet he said and
[1:18:10] you follow that true word and you get a
[1:18:12] true experience amen of the word because
[1:18:15] the word is made flesh in you and you
[1:18:18] become god's son and the world will help
[1:18:21] me jesus and the word of god is
[1:18:23] revolving right out of god into you
[1:18:26] because you are his nature his spirit is
[1:18:30] in you and you'll do the works of god
[1:18:32] amen how many will agree with me tonight
[1:18:34] that in this meeting we're going to see
[1:18:37] amen the works of god we're going to see
[1:18:39] signs we're going to see miracles we're
[1:18:42] going to see wonders we're going to see
[1:18:44] healing we're going to see deliverance
[1:18:47] we're going to see families restored
[1:18:49] we're going to see joy come back we're
[1:18:51] going to see people get their praise
[1:18:52] back we're going to see people get their
[1:18:54] dance back we're going to see people
[1:18:57] that have had bad experiences with other
[1:18:59] things come in the presence of jesus
[1:19:01] christ and not receive a false
[1:19:03] experience but receive a true experience
[1:19:06] that will produce a true christian with
[1:19:08] a true anointing with the true faith
[1:19:11] oh devil get out of here we're not
[1:19:13] backing up we're not turning around we
[1:19:15] know where we're standing tonight we're
[1:19:17] standing on christ the solid rock all
[1:19:19] other ground is seeking sand but this
[1:19:22] message has been through the storm and
[1:19:24] the storm couldn't destroy it it's been
[1:19:26] through the fire and the fire couldn't
[1:19:28] burn it it's been through the hall of
[1:19:30] credits and they couldn't criticize it
[1:19:32] enough it's the truth
[1:19:34] this message is the truth how can you
[1:19:37] say that because this message is christ
[1:19:42] and christ is the truth
[1:19:46] and what are you saying tonight i'm
[1:19:48] saying christ
[1:19:49] is here to renew you
[1:19:52] when you think of the words like renew
[1:19:55] refresh
[1:19:56] revive
[1:19:57] refill
[1:19:58] refuel
[1:20:00] recover here's what we're going to do
[1:20:02] rededicate when you hear those words you
[1:20:05] realize that the two letters of re amen
[1:20:08] are prefixes on all those words which
[1:20:10] when you read the word prefix of read is
[1:20:13] occurring originally in lone words from
[1:20:16] latin amen used with the meaning again
[1:20:19] how you hear me now
[1:20:21] used with the meaning again
[1:20:24] or again and again
[1:20:27] oh god
[1:20:28] use with again
[1:20:30] or again and again brother matt it means
[1:20:33] to indicate repetition
[1:20:36] in other words the prophet said may this
[1:20:38] little time of coming together not only
[1:20:40] be for the edifying of our own souls but
[1:20:43] may it be to enlighten us in such a way
[1:20:46] and inspire us to will get to tell
[1:20:48] others he said may it be a time of
[1:20:51] rededication
[1:20:53] we've come to dedicated building amen
[1:20:56] but the real church is not the building
[1:20:58] we've come to dedicate this ground to
[1:21:00] the use of god but brother tim the real
[1:21:02] church is not this ground he meant the
[1:21:04] church is sitting on the pews in front
[1:21:06] of me who has had an experience with
[1:21:09] what is being lifted up behind this
[1:21:11] pulpit they've been may it be a time of
[1:21:13] rededication he says uniting with the
[1:21:16] full body of christ and being ready for
[1:21:18] the rapture amen i know we shouldn't go
[1:21:20] here but i'm going to go here right now
[1:21:22] amen this is a closing thought but it
[1:21:24] just come to me amen how would you how
[1:21:26] would you think amen if you if you was
[1:21:29] in this meeting this weekend and all of
[1:21:31] a sudden at some point you begin to feel
[1:21:33] a cold sweet come over you and you begin
[1:21:35] to see love once appear and then you
[1:21:37] know it's not going to be long amen so
[1:21:40] we're going to get together with the
[1:21:41] rest of them and in the moment in the
[1:21:43] twinkling of an eye amen we're going to
[1:21:45] be changed amen come on church that's
[1:21:47] not in the future amen the people that's
[1:21:49] going to fulfill amen the promise of a
[1:21:52] rapture they are not coming amen they
[1:21:54] are sitting before me tonight
[1:21:56] people who's going to see gray hair amen
[1:21:58] turn back back again are sitting before
[1:22:01] me tonight amen this is not just some
[1:22:03] little meeting amen over in the sticks
[1:22:05] of arkansas amen this is a place where
[1:22:08] the sons and daughters of god have
[1:22:10] gathered together under the spout where
[1:22:12] the glory of god comes out and an
[1:22:15] inspiration is flowing and a fire is
[1:22:17] burning and rededication is claiming
[1:22:20] vessels listen church we could leave
[1:22:22] here before this service is dismissed
[1:22:24] tonight
[1:22:27] there's nothing else coming it is here
[1:22:29] tonight that's why paul would say or
[1:22:31] rather peter would say repent you
[1:22:33] therefore and be converted amen i've got
[1:22:36] a habit of knocking things over so
[1:22:37] forgive me i don't care if i knock the
[1:22:39] water bottle over but i am going to
[1:22:40] knock that devil over
[1:22:43] i want to knock that devil over
[1:22:46] because we didn't come here just for
[1:22:47] another gathering we didn't come here
[1:22:49] for a protracted meeting we come here
[1:22:51] for renewing
[1:22:52] he said when the times of refreshing
[1:22:55] shall come from the presence of god the
[1:22:57] prophet said what we need today is a
[1:22:59] refreshing amen not a celebration but a
[1:23:02] feeling let me say this this here this
[1:23:04] weekend it's not so much a celebration
[1:23:07] it is a feeling and the prophet said
[1:23:09] what was the dedication if we'll come
[1:23:11] back somebody say come back to the
[1:23:13] original dedication and we'll open our
[1:23:16] hearts and we'll empty ourselves that
[1:23:18] god i want you to hear this quote
[1:23:20] tonight in dedication as we give it to
[1:23:23] him we'll fill our temple with his
[1:23:25] second glory then the living god
[1:23:27] somebody shout the living god will be
[1:23:29] moving in a living church among a living
[1:23:32] people and will spread forth his glory
[1:23:35] then together someday one being this way
[1:23:38] and one this way and one part of the
[1:23:40] country she'll come together and make
[1:23:42] the bride and will be called up in the
[1:23:44] air to meet him now this lovely church
[1:23:46] this building that the people with their
[1:23:48] tokens of their livelihood with their
[1:23:50] love for christ amen the worshipers has
[1:23:53] dedicated today the place of worship
[1:23:56] that people could come and worship now
[1:23:58] my sincere prayer is that every worship
[1:24:00] or how many worshipers do we have here
[1:24:02] tonight every worshiper will dedicate
[1:24:06] his own temple he meant to worship in
[1:24:08] the temple amen that's being dedicated
[1:24:11] for worship
[1:24:12] amen that's the real dedication so the
[1:24:16] real dedication is not blessing two
[1:24:17] befores amen and blessed carpet amen but
[1:24:20] the real dedication is blessing the real
[1:24:23] church amen thank god for this build and
[1:24:25] thank god for what he's provided but let
[1:24:27] me put hell on notice amen if this
[1:24:29] building would be washed away in a flood
[1:24:31] tomorrow if a fire would burn it in god
[1:24:33] forbid amen devil you wouldn't shut up
[1:24:35] matt morris you wouldn't shut up grace
[1:24:37] tabernacle you wouldn't shut up these
[1:24:39] ministers amen if tomorrow night we had
[1:24:41] to meet somewhere under a
[1:24:43] amen and worship believing god we would
[1:24:45] be there because we've come into more
[1:24:48] than just the church we have come into
[1:24:50] christ it is a true relationship it is a
[1:24:53] permanent relationship
[1:24:56] oh let's go ahead and preach a minute
[1:24:57] amen tell that devil you ain't going to
[1:24:59] destroy this you can't destroy this he's
[1:25:02] done tried and you're still here
[1:25:06] well that's a shout point right there
[1:25:08] he's done trying to quiet you down and
[1:25:10] every time he tried to climb you down
[1:25:12] you just got louder he's tried to scare
[1:25:14] you and every time he tried to scare you
[1:25:16] you just got more bolder hey then do you
[1:25:18] know why because there's an inspiration
[1:25:21] in this church it's not flowing from a
[1:25:23] man it's pulling from christ
[1:25:26] absurd i think of how israel on their
[1:25:28] journey they got dry and they needed a
[1:25:31] refreshing i think of what david said
[1:25:33] there amen i love this in psalms 85
[1:25:35] verse 6. amen will vow not revive
[1:25:38] somebody shall revive
[1:25:40] us again
[1:25:41] i love this that thy people amen may
[1:25:44] rejoice in thee amen let me just go and
[1:25:46] say it's time to rejoice
[1:25:49] come on it's time to kick out every cold
[1:25:51] day boy it's time to kick out every
[1:25:53] bitterness it's time to kick out every
[1:25:55] spirit that we're trying this is your
[1:25:57] season to rejoice the bible says that
[1:26:00] amen revive us again that thy people may
[1:26:03] rejoice in thee who is thee in christ
[1:26:06] see then tonight we have he meant a
[1:26:09] scriptural promise that whatever god did
[1:26:12] before he will do it again he would slap
[1:26:15] somebody on the knee and say what he did
[1:26:17] before he'll do it again amen you ain't
[1:26:20] going to do that looking at me amen you
[1:26:22] gotta take your hand and slap somebody
[1:26:24] on the knee amen whatever god did before
[1:26:27] he will do it again thank you brother
[1:26:29] david amen whatever god did before he
[1:26:32] will do it again amen that's gonna be my
[1:26:34] confession here tonight amen anybody
[1:26:36] want to start testifying with me amen
[1:26:38] you know what i've learned amen a
[1:26:40] meeting that starts with testimonies
[1:26:42] ends with more
[1:26:44] a meeting that starts with testimonies
[1:26:46] actually ends with more amen i didn't
[1:26:48] come here to talk about all the
[1:26:50] negativity i didn't come here to talk
[1:26:51] about all the problems i come here to
[1:26:53] let you know if you've seen god say
[1:26:55] before he's going to do it again if
[1:26:57] you've seen god deliver before he's
[1:26:59] going to do it again if you've seen god
[1:27:01] pour out his spirit before he's gonna do
[1:27:03] it again amen if any two or three would
[1:27:06] agree that's touching any one thing on
[1:27:08] the earth it shall be done in heaven
[1:27:10] brother matt do you agree with me
[1:27:12] brother mark do you agree with me and i
[1:27:14] say open up the windows of heaven god
[1:27:16] and let it outpour it by the holy ghost
[1:27:19] and then take the liberty of this speech
[1:27:21] amen take us beyond just looking at the
[1:27:23] creature take us into a sphere amen of
[1:27:26] faith of worship of believing god can
[1:27:28] still do the
[1:27:30] impossible amen what he did before he'll
[1:27:34] do again amen the bible says it this way
[1:27:37] whatever god does it shall be forever
[1:27:40] amen hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is
[1:27:43] the same amen yesterday today and
[1:27:47] forever the prophet said here's the
[1:27:49] revelation god never changes
[1:27:54] god never changes and his ways are
[1:27:58] unchangeable as he is here it is amen an
[1:28:01] unchanging god with unchanging ways well
[1:28:05] surely brother wayne there's got to be a
[1:28:07] time he's going to change but a prophet
[1:28:09] said there will never be a change
[1:28:14] there will never be a change in what the
[1:28:16] church was at pentecost amen is the
[1:28:19] standard amen somebody shout pentecost
[1:28:22] amen what the church was at pentecost is
[1:28:25] the standard this is the pattern there
[1:28:28] is no other pattern no matter what
[1:28:31] scholar says god has not changed that
[1:28:33] pattern what god did at pentecost he has
[1:28:36] to keep on doing until the church ages
[1:28:40] close
[1:28:42] will you say mother andrew pentecost
[1:28:44] amen it's the denomination amen but the
[1:28:46] prophet said that pentecost is an
[1:28:48] experience amen pentecost is not a
[1:28:51] denomination amen pentecost is an
[1:28:53] experience then he would say what we
[1:28:55] need is another pentecost in other words
[1:28:58] what he's going to say is a hundred and
[1:29:00] seventy million professed christians
[1:29:03] around the world need is another
[1:29:06] pentecost amen one is another pentecost
[1:29:08] it is a renewing of your experience it
[1:29:12] is a renewing of what god did for you
[1:29:14] well lord you moved for me five years
[1:29:16] ago and i'm still thanking you for that
[1:29:19] amen but do you realize he wants to move
[1:29:20] for you again tonight amen come on young
[1:29:22] people amen if he moved for a youth camp
[1:29:25] in march he's the same god here tonight
[1:29:27] if he moved at youth camp in louisiana
[1:29:29] he's the same god here tonight if he
[1:29:31] moved up in ohio he's the same god here
[1:29:34] to what are you saying i'm saying amen

[1:35:44] her way and said listen woman amen them
[1:35:47] are not postcards them are moneygrams
[1:35:49] and here she had been sitting in church
[1:35:51] for years amen thinking she was the

[1:35:56] reality
[1:35:58] she was the richest person in the entire
[1:36:01] county well come on church haven't you
[1:36:03] been sitting back letting the devil tell

[1:36:40] she was talking about it but she didn't
[1:36:42] see it she was listening to it but she
[1:36:45] didn't see it but one night in a service
[1:36:47] the holy ghost began to move and the
[1:36:49] spirit began to sin amen over the hearts
[1:36:52] of the believers and somebody stood up
[1:36:54] and said he's still god and somebody
[1:36:56] else said his word is still true and
[1:36:58] somebody else said he's the same
[1:37:00] yesterday today and forever and all of a
[1:37:03] sudden the angels of god begin to feel
[1:37:06] the building and people's eyes begin to

[1:37:37] disclaimer here amen they're going to
[1:37:39] make some noise around here this weekend

[1:37:56] ain't a house of depression this ain't a
[1:37:58] house of complexes this ain't a house of
[1:38:01] bitterness this ain't a house of sadness
[1:38:03] this is a place where the miraculous is
[1:38:05] transferred this is a place where the
[1:38:07] power of god amen comes in the meaning
[1:38:10] and lives are changed forever let me
[1:38:12] just go and tell that no praise devil
[1:38:14] you might as well pack your bags and get
[1:38:16] out of dodge amen because there's some
[1:38:18] believers here that knows what it's like
[1:38:20] ain't meant to be sit looking at the
[1:38:22] postcards and have no understanding of
[1:38:25] what they are but then a man steps in
[1:38:27] the building kyle and he turns on the
[1:38:29] lives and they see they didn't become a
[1:38:31] son on any certain certain day they
[1:38:33] always was the son of god they always
[1:38:35] had a gene seed they always had their
[1:38:38] name

[1:38:42] people shouting because they've
[1:38:44] experienced christ
[1:38:47] they've experienced more than a church
[1:38:49] they've experienced more than a picture
[1:38:51] more than a theory they've experienced
[1:38:53] christ
[1:38:56] oh religious people don't like that kind
[1:38:58] of preaching
[1:38:59] but i ain't a religious preacher

[1:39:03] fire baptized message believing devil
[1:39:06] stomping amen sin slaying preacher that
[1:39:09] still believes in a book of acts
[1:39:11] experience
[1:39:13] that still believes demons can be cast
[1:39:15] out that still believes the spirits of
[1:39:18] oppression can be destroyed in holy
[1:39:21] ghost-filled meetings
[1:39:24] anybody else believe it with me anybody
[1:39:26] else believe it with me there's one
[1:39:29] there's one there's one there's a group

[1:39:35] brother you might as well shout we
[1:39:36] believe in the power of god we believe
[1:39:39] in the holy ghost
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:44] bill brother andrew i think we better be
[1:39:45] careful hey man cause we've been having
[1:39:47] some meetings and there's been some
[1:39:49] young people getting out of hand there's
[1:39:50] been a lot of dancing going on huh
[1:39:53] there's been a lot of dancing going on
[1:39:55] amen you know what we got we got us a
[1:39:57] bunch of intellectual giants in the land
[1:39:59] today that's caught the nerve of the
[1:40:00] wayne amen to call holy ghost dancing
[1:40:02] amen bubble dancing
[1:40:06] but i just happened to have a message
[1:40:08] church too and i happened to read that
[1:40:10] message church and i happened to read a
[1:40:12] prophet saying amen we've got to come
[1:40:14] somebody shot we got to come
[1:40:16] to full doctrine he said that's why
[1:40:18] there's all this bubble dancing amen do
[1:40:20] you realize there was no full doctrine
[1:40:23] when they were bubble dancing
[1:40:26] that's why i entitled it bubble dancing
[1:40:28] because they didn't have a foundation to
[1:40:29] dance on when the when the spirit lifted
[1:40:32] the dance was gone amen but i'm going to
[1:40:34] preach to you for a second amen because
[1:40:36] these young people ain't preaching on
[1:40:38] the g chord of the organ they ain't
[1:40:40] preaching on the c chord from the guitar
[1:40:43] they aren't bubble dancing these are
[1:40:45] boys and girls who have been born under
[1:40:47] the full word that was promised by
[1:40:49] revelations 10 has been birthed in the
[1:40:51] full effect if anybody got a rap against
[1:40:54] the isles these young people in the
[1:40:56] message of the hour gotta write today
[1:41:01] you know why people don't like dancing
[1:41:02] amen because they don't like victory
[1:41:04] amen but i love victory and you know
[1:41:06] what dancing is dancing is a sign of
[1:41:08] victory
[1:41:10] well i might as well bulldoze that devil
[1:41:11] out of the building tonight i said
[1:41:13] dancing is a sign of victory real
[1:41:15] preacher i don't think it's plot that
[1:41:17] somebody stand up in the service well
[1:41:19] what would you have thought of when
[1:41:20] william branham hung his leg across a
[1:41:23] pulpit and stood there and danced and
[1:41:25] shouted i'll tell you what you would
[1:41:26] have thought of you would have thought
[1:41:27] he was out of line but i'll tell you
[1:41:29] what he was a redeemed son who knew he
[1:41:32] was not going to be a son he was already
[1:41:34] a son and the reality of who he was
[1:41:37] struck the depths of his soul and
[1:41:39] produced a reaction oh god strike us
[1:41:42] tonight until the holy ghost amen takes
[1:41:45] control the meaning
[1:41:48] but then i think we got to be careful we
[1:41:50] got to be scriptural thank you for
[1:41:51] bringing that point up because the
[1:41:52] prophet said jesus is very scriptural
[1:41:55] and that jesus in me
[1:41:57] loves the jesus in you and the jesus in
[1:42:00] me still believes in worship and if it's
[1:42:03] the original jesus that jesus and you
[1:42:05] will too
[1:42:11] over there and you've got to be careful
[1:42:12] because paul said there was another
[1:42:13] jesus another spirit of the gospel i
[1:42:15] know that but at the same time a prophet
[1:42:17] said let any man that let any angel that
[1:42:20] come from heaven and preach anything
[1:42:21] different let him be accursed
[1:42:23] and the prophet said have you peace in
[1:42:26] your heart and the assurance he says a
[1:42:29] scriptural assurance as these people
[1:42:31] i've talked about tonight that when you
[1:42:33] met god anybody in here met god
[1:42:36] when you met god he said you had a
[1:42:39] spiritual a scripture rather experience
[1:42:42] that god changed your life completely
[1:42:47] and now
[1:42:48] not you're just the same person just
[1:42:51] rebuilding polished over but you are
[1:42:54] a new creature a new creation in christ
[1:42:58] do you know why these people are
[1:43:00] shouting is because they've got a
[1:43:02] scriptural assurance that they met the
[1:43:04] god of the bible and he produced them a
[1:43:08] change then what does a scriptural
[1:43:11] experience do it produces a scriptural
[1:43:13] assurance then the prophet said what's
[1:43:15] it going to take in the last days to
[1:43:16] stand brother darren he says it's going
[1:43:18] to take a scriptural trained church to
[1:43:21] stand in the last days may i announce to
[1:43:24] hell that grace tabernacle is a
[1:43:26] scriptural
[1:43:28] trained church that is not on their
[1:43:31] knees that it's not on their back and
[1:43:33] it's not hiding in the corner somewhere
[1:43:35] they are standing brother being on their
[1:43:37] feet
[1:43:39] now brother andrew what are you saying
[1:43:41] i'm saying what we need tonight is a
[1:43:42] renewing of our experience what does the
[1:43:44] word experience mean it means a
[1:43:46] practical contact with an observation of
[1:43:50] facts or events it is an event or it is
[1:43:53] an occurrence that leaves an impression
[1:43:55] on someone to encounter or undergo an
[1:43:58] event or an occurrence encourage to feel
[1:44:00] an emotion
[1:44:04] now
[1:44:05] when you begin to say this about needing
[1:44:07] an experience that'll i know that old
[1:44:09] devil raises his head and said well
[1:44:11] glory to god brother branham said we
[1:44:13] need to do away with experience
[1:44:16] i want to attack that devil to the wall
[1:44:18] too
[1:44:19] because the prophet said i'm hungry to
[1:44:21] see a church stand
[1:44:23] in the last days
[1:44:25] he says he says the little grin the
[1:44:26] little remnants are waiting on waiting
[1:44:28] to see how big we can make our
[1:44:29] denominations they're not waiting to see
[1:44:30] how well we can dress how big a church
[1:44:32] we can build they're waiting to see us
[1:44:35] manifest
[1:44:37] the life of the lord jesus christ in
[1:44:40] love and power now here's brother
[1:44:42] branham's words they've got an
[1:44:44] experience if there is a reality that's
[1:44:48] what we need is an experience now when
[1:44:50] he says this he goes to acts 19 and says
[1:44:53] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:44:56] you believed see in other words the holy
[1:44:58] spirit is a promise in every age there
[1:45:01] is not one aid somebody say one age
[1:45:04] where the spirit is not mentioned from
[1:45:06] ephesus to laodicea the spirit is
[1:45:09] mentioned in every age see the bible
[1:45:11] says heathen f and ear let him hear what
[1:45:14] the spirit said to the churches in other
[1:45:16] words the ability to hear what the
[1:45:18] spirit speaks is a god-given ability
[1:45:22] matthew says it this way or jesus rather
[1:45:24] in the book of matthew he says blessed
[1:45:26] art thou amen simon barjona for flesh
[1:45:29] and blood has not revealed it unto thee
[1:45:31] but my father which is in heaven
[1:45:34] he says now putting this verse together
[1:45:36] it's going to be to a very special group
[1:45:38] a group that receives the revelation of
[1:45:41] god in the age they're living in then
[1:45:44] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[1:45:47] god brother tim they are the ones that
[1:45:49] are born of god they are baptized into
[1:45:51] the body of jesus christ by his spirit
[1:45:53] they are baptized with the holy ghost
[1:45:56] are you ready for this the all of god
[1:45:59] are the children of god
[1:46:02] oh
[1:46:03] he says then the evidence of being a
[1:46:04] true child of god is again set forth as
[1:46:08] taught by the word by the holy ghost so
[1:46:11] tongue is just not the evidence amen but
[1:46:14] the evidence is the ability to hear what
[1:46:16] the spirit says he said i want to make
[1:46:18] myself very clear on what the baptism of
[1:46:21] the holy ghost is according to the word
[1:46:25] he says now what do we got to do we got
[1:46:26] to prove all things by what by the word
[1:46:29] how many knows the word corrects the
[1:46:31] error
[1:46:33] i'm driving this home the word corrects
[1:46:36] the error then what is the error the
[1:46:38] error was you receive
[1:46:40] the holy ghost when you believe but a
[1:46:42] prophet come with the word and said you
[1:46:44] receive the holy ghost since you
[1:46:47] believed amen then what is caused the
[1:46:49] misunderstanding amen the answer is
[1:46:51] experience we have gone by experience
[1:46:53] and not the word he says away with
[1:46:56] experience as your measure line there is
[1:46:58] only one plumb line only one word or rod
[1:47:01] and that is the word he says now watch
[1:47:03] amen they did not go on and receive the
[1:47:06] holy ghost he said you believe unto
[1:47:10] receiving the spirit believing on jesus
[1:47:12] it's a step in the right direction i'm
[1:47:14] i'm laying some word here on purpose
[1:47:16] which is toward the holy ghost but the
[1:47:18] people stop there they go as far as the
[1:47:21] water and stop they believe and then
[1:47:23] stop but the bible does not say when you
[1:47:25] when you believe it is have you received
[1:47:27] since you believed the exact and literal
[1:47:30] translation is did ye have previously
[1:47:33] believed receive the holy ghost the
[1:47:36] people believe and then stop you don't
[1:47:39] receive the holy ghost when you believe
[1:47:41] unto him have it repented you go on and
[1:47:44] receive the holy ghost do you see it
[1:47:47] what is wrong with our fundamentalists
[1:47:50] here it is they have stopped they have
[1:47:52] no power for they stop short of
[1:47:55] pentecost amen what is pentecost for the
[1:47:58] job it is an experience amen they stop
[1:48:01] short of a true experience
[1:48:04] with the true god amen brother branham
[1:48:06] was not saying we don't need experience
[1:48:08] he was saying we need amen in witnesses
[1:48:11] 1954 we need a word experience do you
[1:48:15] know why we need a word experience amen
[1:48:17] because heavens and earth shall pass
[1:48:20] away brother vernon but the word says
[1:48:23] amen my word shall never pass away
[1:48:26] that's why the devil wants you just to
[1:48:28] go and get a feeling because of feeling
[1:48:30] i'm preaching to you now because a
[1:48:32] feeling will pass away a sensation will
[1:48:34] pass away amen but the word amen will
[1:48:37] never pass away then what is the word
[1:48:40] amen the word is not just in print
[1:48:42] tonight amen the word has become flesh
[1:48:45] again
[1:48:46] oh can i preach to you for a minute the
[1:48:48] word has become flesh again listen this
[1:48:51] bible

[1:48:55] bibles one in the zodiac one in the
[1:48:57] pyramids one on paper amen the zodiac
[1:49:00] has been through solar systems but it's
[1:49:02] still testifying that the word is true
[1:49:04] the pyramids have been through the flood
[1:49:06] and it's still testifying the word is
[1:49:08] true come on now let's bring it on home
[1:49:11] and knock that devil clean out of black
[1:49:12] rock arkansas and this bible was laying
[1:49:15] on a pulpit in jeffersonville indiana
[1:49:18] and a flood struck the city but the word
[1:49:21] floated above the flood as a testimony
[1:49:24] that the word can never be destroyed
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:28] that as you feed on the word you become
[1:49:31] the word man told me one time he said
[1:49:34] andrew i think we're doing way too much
[1:49:35] reading of quotes he said what we need
[1:49:37] to do is read our bibles because that's
[1:49:39] the only thing that's been proven to go
[1:49:41] through the fire and flood and still
[1:49:43] survive i said well that's your opinion
[1:49:45] but here's what i believe brother mark i
[1:49:47] left there and i went down to keith
[1:49:49] brown's church and i went in there and
[1:49:51] brother keisha andrew i want to show you

[1:49:59] did amen and there was black soot on my
[1:50:02] finger i said where's these books been
[1:50:04] he said with andrew in my mobile home
[1:50:08] when my mobile home called on fire it
[1:50:10] burned to the ground he said but then
[1:50:12] books was stood the fire and he said i
[1:50:15] went over there and picked them up they
[1:50:16] were not damaged they were not burnt he
[1:50:19] said they just got a little soot on them
[1:50:21] i said thank you brother where's that oh
[1:50:23] intellectual devil at now amen let me
[1:50:25] say this amen if they destroy our books
[1:50:27] tomorrow amen let me say this if they
[1:50:29] destroy our tapes amen the word has
[1:50:32] already become flesh in blackrock
[1:50:34] arkansas young men the word is already
[1:50:37] to come flesh in you and there's not
[1:50:39] enough in your past there's not enough
[1:50:41] in your present and there's not enough
[1:50:42] in your future amen to destroy where god
[1:50:45] is leading you
[1:50:47] i gotta close what are you saying i'm
[1:50:49] saying slap somebody on the knee and say
[1:50:51] the word is going to be
[1:50:53] the word is going to be made flesh in a
[1:50:55] group of people in the state of arkansas
[1:50:58] in the place of blackrock because
[1:51:00] there's still some people that believe
[1:51:02] god and are living right
[1:51:10] this day
[1:51:11] this scripture is fulfilled brother
[1:51:14] branham this message ain't dead it's
[1:51:17] alive
[1:51:18] in arkansas tonight
[1:51:22] i'm looking at people that's been
[1:51:24] through hell but they're still standing
[1:51:26] i'm looking at young people that's
[1:51:28] fought all kinds of demons but they're
[1:51:30] still standing
[1:51:36] go ahead and say boo therefore that
[1:51:39] devil says he's going to get you he
[1:51:40] should have got you
[1:51:43] because you're done past getting
[1:51:46] no
[1:51:47] you didn't hear that
[1:51:50] you're done
[1:51:51] past getting
[1:51:55] the devil can't get you
[1:51:57] sin can't get you
[1:51:59] depression can't get you suicide can't
[1:52:02] get you
[1:52:02] katie's temptations can't get you
[1:52:05] because the word has become flesh by
[1:52:09] experience
[1:52:16] that's why you're still standing because
[1:52:19] the word is made flesh in a man named
[1:52:21] matt morris
[1:52:25] the word
[1:52:27] is made flesh in a young man
[1:52:29] you know why
[1:52:30] because you meant more than a theory
[1:52:33] you read more than a book
[1:52:35] you experienced christ
[1:52:37] you had a word experience
[1:52:39] let me
[1:52:40] let me close by saying this
[1:52:43] satan
[1:52:45] we are
[1:52:47] expected
[1:52:50] to receive
[1:52:51] you know what that word receive means
[1:52:53] it means to lay hold
[1:52:56] brother pruitt it means to get a hold of
[1:52:59] something come on
[1:53:01] it means brother wayne to put your hands
[1:53:03] on it
[1:53:04] and to claim it
[1:53:05] come on
[1:53:06] it means to lay hold on it it means to
[1:53:09] possess something
[1:53:12] you realize amen in acts 3 there was a
[1:53:14] man who was lame the prophet god said if
[1:53:16] you come with a kind now listen he said
[1:53:18] if you come with a kind of a sarcastic
[1:53:20] criticism whatever you expect to see
[1:53:22] that's just what you'll see
[1:53:25] hear me now if you come expect him to be
[1:53:28] just disappointed that's the way you're
[1:53:29] going to be he said but if you come to
[1:53:32] receive
[1:53:36] oh i feel like dancing because i feel
[1:53:38] like i'm in other company that come to
[1:53:40] receive
[1:53:42] anybody say i didn't come to criticize i
[1:53:44] didn't come to be disappointed i come to
[1:53:46] receive if you come to receive you will
[1:53:49] be expecting to receive are you ready
[1:53:52] for this and you shall receive just what
[1:53:56] you expect to receive
[1:54:00] well brother andrew i'm expecting to get
[1:54:02] the holy ghost amen ye shall receive the
[1:54:05] holy ghost brother andrew i'm expecting
[1:54:08] the baptism of a word birth and you
[1:54:10] shall receive listen if it's in the word
[1:54:13] it's for you tonight is there anybody
[1:54:15] who says i'm not leaving here without
[1:54:17] getting what i come to get from god
[1:54:20] brother i may have to fight you're
[1:54:22] exactly right amen but fight on amen
[1:54:25] because we're living oh god we're living
[1:54:27] in a time where god
[1:54:30] is doing great things
[1:54:33] now now we are living in unexpected
[1:54:36] times
[1:54:39] i mean
[1:54:40] let me give you a key and i'm watching
[1:54:42] my time
[1:54:47] let me give you a key to these meetings
[1:54:50] as you enter these meetings
[1:54:52] enter them under the expectation of god
[1:54:55] and not of man
[1:54:59] because a man
[1:55:00] is a human
[1:55:02] and he can fail you
[1:55:06] but my god
[1:55:09] brother philip my god has got a record
[1:55:12] he has never
[1:55:14] failed
[1:55:15] one time
[1:55:16] that's why david said my soul
[1:55:20] is expecting from him
[1:55:23] david said i once was young but now i'm
[1:55:25] old but i've never seen the righteous
[1:55:27] forsaken he said god if you give me the
[1:55:30] line and you give me the bear then
[1:55:32] you'll give me this uncircumcised
[1:55:33] ballistic are you hear me now amen i'm
[1:55:35] talking about a man who walked through
[1:55:38] the valley of the shadow of death but he
[1:55:40] would fear no evil because his
[1:55:42] expectation was of
[1:55:44] god that word expectation means
[1:55:48] a strong belief
[1:55:51] a strong belief that something will
[1:55:53] happen
[1:55:56] or be the case
[1:55:58] a belief that someone will or should
[1:56:01] achieve something the prophet said it
[1:56:03] was revealed in the simian by the holy
[1:56:05] ghost he says he had an attitude of
[1:56:08] expectation he said simeon had faith and
[1:56:11] faith knows no defeat
[1:56:14] faith is perfect i'm just laying some
[1:56:17] bricks in here to build on this meeting
[1:56:19] amen faith brings things when there is
[1:56:23] no things to be brought
[1:56:25] no you all didn't hear that that'll
[1:56:27] strike you about lunch tomorrow and
[1:56:29] you'll scare every one of your
[1:56:30] co-workers to death faith brings things
[1:56:33] when there is no things to be brought
[1:56:36] faith creates amen faith takes doubts
[1:56:39] away it takes the negative
[1:56:42] and makes it positive
[1:56:49] then faith must have a resting place
[1:56:51] that's why the bible says amen with god
[1:56:54] nothing shall be impossible you say
[1:56:56] brother andrew that's god he said well
[1:56:57] look at matthew 17 when there come a
[1:57:00] father this child that had epilepsy he
[1:57:02] said oh lord i've been to your disciples
[1:57:04] they could do nothing you say all things
[1:57:06] are possible with god all things are
[1:57:08] possible to you
[1:57:10] because god's power to perform the
[1:57:13] impossible is already in you
[1:57:22] now jesus said in the word
[1:57:25] if you ask somebody say ask
[1:57:27] the father anything
[1:57:28] in my name i'll do it
[1:57:31] but sometimes
[1:57:32] when god performs something and does
[1:57:36] something that we ask for
[1:57:38] it comes
[1:57:40] in an unexpected way
[1:57:45] and sometimes
[1:57:47] in an unexpected
[1:57:50] place and at an
[1:57:53] unexpected time
[1:57:59] it was unexpected
[1:58:02] when you met
[1:58:04] but god was expecting it
[1:58:06] come on
[1:58:07] i'm preaching this church now and i'm
[1:58:09] going i'm gonna close
[1:58:11] it was a barn
[1:58:13] in a field
[1:58:15] in arkansas
[1:58:18] didn't have a pulpit didn't have a
[1:58:20] platform
[1:58:22] didn't have sound boards didn't have
[1:58:24] sunday school rooms didn't have a
[1:58:26] nursery it was an
[1:58:28] unexpected place
[1:58:30] but it does not matter when the god of
[1:58:34] unexpected things is only inside of his
[1:58:37] believers
[1:58:40] brother matt when you baptized the first
[1:58:42] soul
[1:58:43] that might have been unexpected to the
[1:58:45] world but god was expecting it when you
[1:58:48] preached the first sermon it might have
[1:58:50] been unexpected to the world but god was
[1:58:52] expecting it come on church i'm
[1:58:54] preaching to you now when the devil said
[1:58:57] this is just a barn it'll never be
[1:58:59] nothing else amen but god rich in mercy
[1:59:02] amen said but i've got some seeds that
[1:59:05] are expecting amen something for me and
[1:59:08] i'll raise up a pla the prophet calls it
[1:59:10] a spot of grace
[1:59:12] and what's the name of this church it's
[1:59:14] a spot of grace and let me say this
[1:59:17] grace tabernacle in this meeting this
[1:59:19] weekend don't you hang your head don't
[1:59:22] you bow that head of that devil amen you
[1:59:24] stand there and say if my god did it
[1:59:26] before
[1:59:29] he's going to do it again when you hit
[1:59:31] the first bump you didn't close your
[1:59:33] bible and quit you kept on plowing come
[1:59:35] on church you kept on pushing you kept
[1:59:38] on amen men of god come in here and they
[1:59:41] kept on preaching and they kept on
[1:59:42] pushing and they kept on plowing and you
[1:59:45] kept on praying and you kept on coming
[1:59:47] and you kept on sacrificing
[1:59:50] and you kept on believing in the face of
[1:59:52] impossibility but let me announce to you
[1:59:55] tonight it's time to come together and
[1:59:58] look at what the lord has done
[2:00:04] come on church is that the best place we
[2:00:06] can give him i'm talking about the god
[2:00:09] that made a way when there was no way
[2:00:13] i'm talking about the god when you
[2:00:15] didn't know where to take your family he
[2:00:18] raised up a place
[2:00:21] i'm talking about a god when the odds
[2:00:23] was against you it did not matter
[2:00:26] brother wayne because god was on your
[2:00:28] side
[2:00:32] come on church it's time to rejoice i'm
[2:00:35] done tonight it's time to rejoice i'm
[2:00:38] going to say this you say that are you
[2:00:40] being pentecostal no i'm doing what
[2:00:41] revelation 10 8 says thou must prophesy
[2:00:44] again i'm going to prophesy according to
[2:00:47] the word you're going to see more
[2:00:48] miracles
[2:00:52] you're going to see more salvations
[2:00:54] you're going to see more prodigals
[2:00:56] return home you're going to see more
[2:00:58] miracles you're going to see more
[2:01:00] deliverances
[2:01:04] because right here
[2:01:06] in the state of arkansas
[2:01:08] the traits of god
[2:01:11] is still alive
[2:01:14] in a group of people
[2:01:18] brother andrew
[2:01:19] i don't like you bragging on this church
[2:01:21] so much
[2:01:24] i'm not bragging on a man
[2:01:26] i'm bragging on what god has done
[2:01:32] man can't do this
[2:01:35] with a man this was impossible
[2:01:38] but with god
[2:01:39] nothing is impossible
[2:01:42] come on young people
[2:01:44] i said with god nothing is impossible
[2:01:49] young man with you
[2:01:51] nothing is impossible
[2:01:52] salem with you nothing is impossible how
[2:01:55] can you say that because the same god
[2:01:58] that was in simian that led him under
[2:02:01] expectation to receive the fulfillment
[2:02:04] of the promise is the same god in you
[2:02:06] [Applause]
[2:02:08] let the musicians come this evening
[2:02:13] expecting
[2:02:16] of god
[2:02:18] expecting
[2:02:20] of god
[2:02:23] and i'm going to ask you to do something
[2:02:24] tonight
[2:02:26] i'm going to ask you to take the limits
[2:02:27] off of god
[2:02:30] take the limits on for this meeting
[2:02:35] lander you better be careful i'm going
[2:02:36] to tell you what the prophet said
[2:02:39] if you can limit god
[2:02:41] then you can limit christ
[2:02:43] and if you oh god if you limit
[2:02:47] the church
[2:02:50] today
[2:02:52] in its possibilities
[2:02:57] then you're limited
[2:02:59] god
[2:03:04] to say grace tabernacle can't do it
[2:03:08] can i preach to you
[2:03:10] it's to say god can't do it
[2:03:13] to say this bride can't do it
[2:03:16] it's to say god
[2:03:18] cannot do it
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:21] because it's not a human doing it
[2:03:24] it's god on the inside of the individual
[2:03:31] the unchangeable god will give you the
[2:03:33] holy ghost
[2:03:35] he will give you the same holy ghost
[2:03:37] that he gave them there without a change
[2:03:39] he will do the same things that he did
[2:03:42] when he was here on earth to any man
[2:03:44] oh god
[2:03:46] or a woman that'll believe it and accept
[2:03:48] it
[2:03:49] if you've got the holy ghost
[2:03:52] then take a hold of it
[2:03:54] like jacob did and hold on to it
[2:03:58] until positive
[2:04:00] results come
[2:04:04] and at an unexpected time
[2:04:07] maybe at an unexpected place
[2:04:10] but he will do it
[2:04:12] in an unexpected place
[2:04:14] now here it is then how much more should
[2:04:17] he do it tonight in an expected place
[2:04:21] where we're expecting to see it happen
[2:04:26] we're not in an unexpected time
[2:04:29] we're not in an unexpected place
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:34] two years ago this was an unexpected
[2:04:36] place but tonight this is an expected
[2:04:38] place
[2:04:41] there's a group of people expected
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] brother andrew is it possible the first
[2:04:48] night of our meeting at our spring
[2:04:50] meeting this year a woman was sitting
[2:04:52] with her family sister
[2:04:54] tara rachel is that correct was sitting
[2:04:56] with her family at a cracker barrel and
[2:04:58] something come over
[2:04:59] to say remember we get what we expect
[2:05:05] and she looked at everybody around her
[2:05:07] brother david and she said we get what
[2:05:08] we expect
[2:05:10] so they come to meeting she said what
[2:05:12] are you expecting what do you expected
[2:05:14] she had been battling a back trouble for
[2:05:15] about two years or something a while
[2:05:17] been all kinds of doctors nothing was
[2:05:20] helping her but while the word was being
[2:05:22] preached
[2:05:23] on the first night of a meeting i didn't
[2:05:25] know what was taking place i don't need
[2:05:27] to know what's taking place because the
[2:05:29] god of the impossible was in the
[2:05:30] building and the back trouble left that
[2:05:33] woman in the meeting
[2:05:36] there was a woman there carrying a fear
[2:05:39] had been in a car wreck 20 30 years ago
[2:05:42] carrying a fear and while the word was
[2:05:44] being preached the fear left her i
[2:05:47] didn't know what was happening amen i
[2:05:49] don't need to know what's happening if
[2:05:51] we just start preaching the word in the
[2:05:53] unseen realm things are taking place
[2:05:58] brother david things are happening right
[2:06:00] now
[2:06:01] you know why
[2:06:03] because there's a group of people
[2:06:04] expecting it
[2:06:08] there's a group of people expecting it
[2:06:10] now let me just go and tell you
[2:06:11] something tonight
[2:06:15] what you expect
[2:06:17] and what you say
[2:06:19] god hears
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:22] brother darren god hears what we say
[2:06:25] he knows our thoughts
[2:06:28] a few years ago i was out brother mike
[2:06:29] walls it was a way to testify for just a
[2:06:31] moment
[2:06:32] preaching a youth camp out there for the
[2:06:34] wait on that friday night a storm hit
[2:06:37] the power went out
[2:06:38] it went totally back in there and i was
[2:06:40] preaching brother joel when that
[2:06:42] happened it was like somebody it was
[2:06:44] like somebody set something on fire the
[2:06:47] place erupted
[2:06:48] vernon they were jumping chairs were fi
[2:06:50] people were screaming i mean hauling and
[2:06:52] rejoicing praising god well brother the
[2:06:54] power just went out
[2:06:57] because if there's no power there's
[2:06:58] going to be no microphone
[2:07:05] i thought well that microphone still got
[2:07:06] power
[2:07:08] so i picked it up and i started
[2:07:10] preaching again and when i did that
[2:07:12] praise went into another level
[2:07:14] brother david i left that meeting and
[2:07:16] for three years i've wondered what
[2:07:18] caused that
[2:07:20] we didn't stage that
[2:07:22] what caused the how could the power go
[2:07:24] out and the meeting go to another level
[2:07:27] well this year i was over there and the
[2:07:28] brother picked me up on a golf cart and
[2:07:30] he said well andrew i need to i need to
[2:07:32] thank you for something i figured he was
[2:07:33] going to say thank you for coming and i
[2:07:35] said well thank you for having us it's
[2:07:36] been good to be here he said no does the
[2:07:38] name sound familiar i said no brother
[2:07:41] i'm sorry i don't know that name he said
[2:07:43] well that girl's my daughter
[2:07:45] he said she was here in that friday
[2:07:48] night meeting he said do you remember
[2:07:49] when the storm hit and the power went
[2:07:51] out i said yes sir i said i've wondered
[2:07:53] what happened
[2:07:54] he said my daughter was sitting there
[2:07:56] running from god
[2:07:58] and she was saying god i don't think
[2:08:01] you're real i don't think you're real
[2:08:03] she said god if you're real show me a
[2:08:05] sign you're real and if not would you
[2:08:08] please shut this preacher up i'm tired
[2:08:10] of hearing him
[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:13] she no more than said that and the power
[2:08:15] went out and you know what she said with
[2:08:16] the mark she said there it is he can't
[2:08:19] preach no more but when i picked up that
[2:08:21] microphone and begin to declare god is
[2:08:24] god and his word is true and the devil
[2:08:27] is defeated and the power of god is
[2:08:29] among us that girl surrendered her heart
[2:08:32] to jesus christ and she was in that
[2:08:35] meeting a few weeks ago what are you
[2:08:37] saying i'm saying come on church let's
[2:08:39] take the limits off of god this weekend

[2:12:49] up this message which is christ and
[2:12:51] there would be young boys and young
[2:12:53] girls and families that would come in

[2:35:57] coming together and worship lord what a
[2:35:59] spirit of unity
[2:36:01] when the bride of christ comes together
[2:36:09] i appreciate all these
[2:36:11] the local churches it's been a support
[2:36:12] to our
[2:36:13] meetings and
[2:36:15] over the years and it's going on almost
[2:36:17] three years since we started the church
[2:36:19] here and
[2:36:20] where the morgan will tell you a little
[2:36:23] story if you'd catch him in the back and
[2:36:25] we actually had church in the kitchen
[2:36:27] we didn't even know his church we just
[2:36:29] come to pray
[2:36:30] asking god i knew that there was souls
[2:36:32] to be won
[2:36:34] i remember i was over in india and i
[2:36:35] just felt like sharing i felt i should
[2:36:37] share this but i was over in india
[2:36:39] praying and i'd been doing missionary
[2:36:41] work and when i'd come home and we'd
[2:36:43] talk about all the churches that we
[2:36:44] started in india everybody would rejoice
[2:36:47] and come home tell everybody the
[2:36:48] testimony there was ten churches started
[2:36:50] while we was in india and everybody
[2:36:51] would rejoice
[2:36:52] that's they'd spend money and spend
[2:36:54] efforts to send people over and and
[2:36:56] support them and i thought man what a
[2:36:59] wonderful thing that is and i kept going
[2:37:01] i kept preaching i was over praying one
[2:37:03] day and i remember the very prayer i
[2:37:05] said lord where will i go next and as as
[2:37:08] much as god has ever spoke to me he said
[2:37:11] what about where you live
[2:37:13] and it brought me back to a quote when
[2:37:15] brother brown said that the greatest
[2:37:16] mission field that we have
[2:37:18] most needed place for missionaries in
[2:37:20] the united states of america
[2:37:22] because i think we need this message
[2:37:24] preached on every street corner and if
[2:37:26] there's a place that rolls up on the
[2:37:27] other street corner let me be able to
[2:37:29] say i could be a proud supporter
[2:37:31] let me support this message friend i
[2:37:33] don't ask you to support me but support
[2:37:35] the message of the hour
[2:37:37] i thank god for his presence i thank god
[2:37:39] for churches i thank god for men of god
[2:37:42] i thank god for pastors that'll preach
[2:37:44] the gospel of jesus christ
[2:37:46] i thank god for believers that will
[2:37:48] support

[2:43:22] but you can still call him on the scene
