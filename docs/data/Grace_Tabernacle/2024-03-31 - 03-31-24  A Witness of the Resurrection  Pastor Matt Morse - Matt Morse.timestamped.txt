[45:12] think of the time that we live in and

[45:17] brother Jared to be around the Believers
[45:19] that we have and what a a fellowship uh
[45:22] group if you want to call it that it's
[45:24] the body of Christ and and what a
[45:26] wonderful body of Fellowship that we
[45:28] have and uh so thankful for everything
[45:30] that God does amen amen we just want to
[45:33] read from John the 11th chapter we're
[45:36] going to read out the 11th verse
[45:38] and Jesus is speaking to the disciples
[45:41] and in the middle of the verse he the
[45:43] Bible says he said unto them our friend
[45:46] Lazarus Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I
[45:50] may wake him out of sleep then said his
[45:53] disciples Lord if he sleep well he
[45:55] should do well but how be it Jesus spake
[45:57] of his death but they thought he spoke
[45:59] of him taking a rest and sleep and said
[46:02] Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead
[46:06] and I am glad for your sakes that I was
[46:08] not there to the intent that you may
[46:09] believe nevertheless let us go unto him
[46:14] then said Thomas which is called dimus
[46:16] unto his fellow disciples let us also go
[46:18] that we may die with him then when Jesus
[46:20] came he found that he was laying in a
[46:23] grave for 4 days already now Bethany was
[46:26] nine to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off
[46:29] and many of the Jews had come to Martha
[46:30] and to Mary to comfort them concerning
[46:32] their brother then Martha as soon as she
[46:35] had heard that Jesus was was coming she
[46:37] went and met him but Mary sat still in
[46:40] the house then said Martha unto Jesus
[46:43] Lord if thou had us been here my brother
[46:46] would have not died but I know that even
[46:49] now whatsoever Thou shalt ask of God God
[46:51] would give it to thee and Jesus said
[46:54] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[46:57] Martha saith unto him I know that he
[46:59] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[47:01] the last day but Jesus said unto her I
[47:05] am the resurrection and the life and he
[47:08] that believeth in me though he were dead
[47:11] yet shall he live may the Lord add his
[47:14] Blessing to the reading of the word this
[47:16] morning as you take your seats I want to
[47:18] speak on this subject of a witness of
[47:21] the Resurrection a witness of the
[47:24] Resurrection in the message of the
[47:26] Easter seal I just thought this was
[47:28] wonderful I'd like to read this this
[47:29] morning as we get started butam said I'm
[47:32] wondering today is what's happening are
[47:34] we really getting people to God or are
[47:36] we just getting them to church we must
[47:39] get them to Christ where there is a
[47:41] quickening power see it's good to go to
[47:43] church sure if that's as far as we go
[47:46] it's not far enough but when you come to
[47:48] church that's good but go on into Christ
[47:51] from the church because we must receive
[47:54] this quickening power if we ever expect
[47:56] to be in that General Resurrection
[47:58] because it's the only thing that will
[48:00] ever bring us from the dead for if the
[48:02] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[48:04] dwell in you it will also quicken in
[48:07] other words it'll bring life to these
[48:09] mortal bodies what a promise that is
[48:12] unto us see the very essence of a
[48:19] res that Jesus is raised from the dead I
[48:22] thought what a a thought this morning on
[48:25] a witness of a resurrection how many
[48:26] knows what a witness is see a witness is
[48:29] one who sees something or experiences
[48:32] something and a matter of fact if you
[48:33] went if if uh if we were in a courtroom
[48:35] this morning uh and and you were you
[48:37] were trying a case and what you would do
[48:39] is you'd bring Witnesses before the
[48:41] court and and and those Witnesses the
[48:43] purpose of a witness is to vindicate
[48:46] something that had happened so I I I
[48:47] would want to plead my case and I'm
[48:49] talking to the jury and and and I want
[48:51] him to see my side of things and Brother
[48:53] David so what I would do is I would
[48:54] bring a witness that was an eyewitness
[48:56] i' bring a witness that heard something
[48:58] or that saw something or or that had an
[49:00] experience that would help uh uh cost to
[49:03] jury to be able it would help their eyes
[49:05] see uh they weren't there when it took
[49:06] place but a witness would be something
[49:09] would help their eyes to be able to open
[49:11] up to what really happened that they
[49:12] might make a rightful judgment so in
[49:14] other words a witness is somebody that
[49:16] saw something but uh but really A
[49:18] Witness is a Vindication that something
[49:21] actually happened and I think I think
[49:23] about that this morning of how that
[49:25] throughout the Bible that there 4,000
[49:28] years of recorded history that lays in
[49:30] this Bible and and Brother David in this
[49:32] scriptures of all these uh 4,000 years
[49:35] there are you you find out that every
[49:38] major event that ever took place in the
[49:40] Bible every major thing from the time of
[49:42] creation that God ever done there has
[49:45] always been a witness brother said he
[49:47] said God has never at any time left
[49:49] himself without a witness somebody is
[49:52] going to witness God I thought you know
[49:55] isn't it something when you look through
[49:56] the script scriptures you'll find out uh
[49:58] you go all the way back to the days of
[49:59] Noah and in a in a time when the world
[50:02] was so such a terrible place the Bible
[50:04] said that men's thoughts were on evil
[50:06] continually it was a it was such a
[50:08] wicked time and a wicked world and a
[50:11] time that was so wicked that God would
[50:13] bring judgment upon the world but I
[50:15] thought even in that time of judgment in
[50:17] the time of wickedness but here was a
[50:19] man named Noah the Bible said that was
[50:21] righteous before God he was a man that
[50:23] walked upright before God so even in the
[50:25] time of wickedness and even in the time
[50:27] of of people that had their mind on evil
[50:30] but still yet there was a witness that
[50:32] that that that still believed God and I
[50:34] thought here was Mo you say well what
[50:35] did Noah witness I'll tell you what he
[50:37] witnessed he witnessed the death of the
[50:39] earth he watched the as the Earth was
[50:41] buried in a water burial and how the
[50:43] life had gone out from it I thought
[50:45] isn't it something that it was Noah was
[50:47] the man that stood there on the side of
[50:49] the ark that day and he and he let loose
[50:51] a dove to go out and he would find that
[50:54] life had resurrected on the earth they
[50:55] were searching ing for signs of Life see
[50:57] he was a witness for God and you know he
[51:00] wasn't the only witness I if I had time
[51:02] this morning I'd go through all of them
[51:04] but but he was but there was another man
[51:06] by the name of Abraham and Abraham was a
[51:08] man that left his whole family to be a
[51:10] witness for God and maybe sometimes he
[51:12] you know his family may have wondered
[51:13] Abraham where you going and why are you
[51:15] wandering off out there in the
[51:16] wilderness and it looked like he was
[51:18] leaving the homestead and he was he was
[51:20] leaving the way he was raised but you
[51:22] realize that Abraham wasn't running from
[51:24] something he was running to something he
[51:26] he was following what God had put on his
[51:28] heart to do and although people may have
[51:30] wondered what he was up to but Abraham
[51:32] he was a witness of God and he was the
[51:34] one that sat there whenever judgment
[51:36] struck the very city of Sodom it was
[51:39] Abraham that set off on the Wayside that
[51:41] witnessed the Judgment of God as it fell
[51:44] upon on that Mighty City see he was a
[51:46] witness of God in the days of Ahab there
[51:48] was a in in Jezebel and how that this
[51:51] Ahab which was a a great king of Israel
[51:54] and you know the Bible would tell us how
[51:56] he done many wicked things and evil
[51:58] things in the sight of the Lord and how
[52:00] that how that his wife had brought
[52:01] idolatry into the the Kingdom of Israel
[52:04] and and in this time that God had
[52:06] brought this Great Famine or or great
[52:08] drought upon the region and and and here
[52:11] these these great prophets of baale
[52:13] would gather together and talk about how
[52:15] great their God was and how that if they
[52:17] would worship this God Bale that they
[52:19] maybe he would bring them some rain and
[52:20] bring life back to them but in the time
[52:23] when it looked like that all of Israel
[52:25] had turned their back on God and it
[52:27] looked like that every prophet and every
[52:29] preacher and and the king and the Queen
[52:32] and all of them had turned their back on
[52:34] God but there stood a man by the name of
[52:37] Elijah that was still a witness of God
[52:40] and the Bible says that Elijah went up
[52:42] on a mountain and on that mountain
[52:45] brother Wesley let me tell you what
[52:46] happened they went to build an altar and
[52:48] they were calling for their God and they
[52:50] were saying that if he would come he
[52:52] would bring water but but Elijah knowing
[52:54] that their God had no power he said I'll
[52:57] tell you what we'll do we'll just put a
[52:58] challenge and we'll find out who God is
[53:01] and who God ain't see he was a witness
[53:03] for God and he stood there without any
[53:06] Ro without any water he stood there
[53:08] without any fire he stood there without
[53:10] seemingly there to be any God up on the
[53:12] mountain and he testified of how great
[53:15] God was in the time of a drought he
[53:17] testified of God in the time of of
[53:19] people turning their back on God he
[53:21] testified of God and he said I'll tell
[53:23] you what we'll do we'll just feel the
[53:25] altar full of water and we'll let the
[53:28] god that anth by fire be the god of
[53:31] Heaven and the Bible said he called upon
[53:33] the name of the Lord and the Lord
[53:35] answered his prayer why because he was a
[53:37] witness of God God has always had a
[53:40] witness it was that way in the days of
[53:42] job whenever everything in job's life
[53:45] fell apart and he lost his family and
[53:47] and his household he lost his Barns and
[53:49] his business and all and and the workers
[53:51] and the and everything that he had but
[53:53] you realize that when all of job
[53:55] everything of job had fell away that
[53:57] even his own wife would come to him and
[54:00] she' say job why don't you just curse
[54:02] God and die but job would not go away
[54:05] from his witness of Jehovah God his
[54:08] testimony remained the same even in this
[54:10] lowly place that he got in you think
[54:12] about how low low down that job got that
[54:15] he would even talk to God he would say
[54:17] what happens to a man when he dies what
[54:19] does he just fade away or does he cease
[54:21] to exist or does he go back to the dust
[54:23] to the ground and only a fading memory
[54:26] of him remains he had these questions
[54:28] because he had lost so many loved ones
[54:31] but notice what job had he caught a re a
[54:34] revelation of the resurrection and even
[54:36] in this low time in this place where he
[54:39] felt like giving up in this place where
[54:41] a man couldn't be any lower than job was
[54:44] he said for I know that my redeemer
[54:46] liveth and he that that he shall stand
[54:49] in the latter day upon the Earth and
[54:51] though the skin worms destroy this body
[54:54] yet in my flesh I will see God I shall
[54:58] see him for myself and my eyes Shall
[55:01] Behold Him He was a witness for God oh I
[55:04] to think even in the worst place of his
[55:06] life with that Revelation he still
[55:08] testified of God see friends it don't
[55:10] matter how bad it gets it don't matter
[55:12] what kind of state we get into it don't
[55:14] matter what kind of condition we may
[55:16] find oursel in in the lowest place the
[55:19] revelation of a resurrection is what's
[55:21] going to bring you through it it don't
[55:22] matter if you lose everybody it don't
[55:24] matter if you lose everything it's the
[55:26] revelation of the Resurrection that'll
[55:29] bring you through to another day you say
[55:31] brother Matt well that was good for Noah
[55:33] and that was good for Elijah and that
[55:35] was good for job but what about me hello
[55:38] somebody what about right now what about
[55:40] us What About Us in
[55:43] 20124 what what about me and the things
[55:45] I'm going through right now but man said
[55:48] well we know that in any age all through
[55:50] every age he said God has always had his
[55:53] witness on the earth he's never been
[55:55] without without a witness are you ready
[55:58] for it he said and he never will be
[56:00] without a witness that means right now
[56:03] today that God still has a witness upon
[56:06] the Earth in the middle of this year
[56:08] when it seems like everybody has turned
[56:10] their back on God when it seems like the
[56:12] world is going another way but God even
[56:14] today still has a witness upon the Earth
[56:18] you say I've never witnessed God in that
[56:21] way I've never witnessed the
[56:23] supernatural I've never seen the the
[56:25] pillar of fire I've never seen God move
[56:27] in a in in in Miracles I've never seen
[56:30] healing i' I've never seen the power of
[56:32] God in any way I've been to church for
[56:34] for all my life but I've never seen God
[56:36] moveing that way I've never seen a sign
[56:38] of his resurrection I've never
[56:40] experienced that kind of a God but did
[56:42] you ever think of this friends that
[56:45] maybe that your approach to God has been
[56:47] wrong all along maybe it's your approach
[56:50] to God that keeps you from seeing the
[56:53] things of God you realize that your
[56:54] approach to God and your approach
[56:56] approach to the word is what brings the
[56:58] power of the Resurrection your approach
[57:00] to God is what brings healing your
[57:02] approach to God is what brings salvation
[57:05] you realize that I believe that God is a
[57:07] just God how many say amen I don't
[57:09] believe God is unjust I don't go I don't
[57:11] think God goes and picks some people
[57:12] over another out of unjustness but God
[57:15] is a just God he's a righteous God and I
[57:18] believe that if God will do something
[57:20] for one man he'll do the same thing for
[57:22] another man if that man will approach
[57:24] God the same way that the other man did
[57:26] if he'll meet him on the same grounds
[57:28] he'll do for you just like he done for
[57:30] another so if God healed one man he'll
[57:32] heal another man if he saved one man on
[57:34] those grounds he'll save another man on
[57:36] those grounds you say but what you got
[57:38] to do is you got to meet God on those
[57:40] grounds you say well well where can you
[57:42] meet him let me tell you what Moses did
[57:44] he was walking along one day and he
[57:45] looked up on a mountain and he saw a
[57:47] bush that was burning with a fire but it
[57:49] was not consumed and the Bible said that
[57:51] Moses went up there before God and God
[57:54] began to speak to him he said Moses take
[57:56] off your shoes for the ground that
[57:58] you're standing upon is a Holy Ground
[58:01] well let me tell you friends the ground
[58:03] Moses was was on it wasn't some Holy
[58:05] Dirt but it was the sacred Sands of the
[58:08] presence of almighty God and as Moses
[58:10] stood before the presence of God God
[58:13] said take off your shoes for you're
[58:14] standing on Holy Ground and the prophet
[58:17] of God said when you ever walk on them
[58:18] sacred Sands he said you'll come away a
[58:21] different person to walk on Holy Ground
[58:24] in the presence of God oh don't you
[58:26] realize if you ever walk on those
[58:27] grounds you'll be established in the
[58:29] word of God if you can ever walk on
[58:31] those grounds in the presence of God
[58:33] there ain't nobody will ever talk you
[58:34] out of it any longer if you never walk
[58:36] on those grounds there ain't nobody can
[58:38] explain it away from you he said because
[58:40] you were on those sacred grounds with
[58:42] God alone you know what happened you
[58:45] know God dealt with you you know God
[58:47] talked to you you know you had a
[58:49] conference with God you know God
[58:51] established you you know he saved you
[58:53] you know he filled you with the Holy
[58:54] Ghost and there ain't no man can take it
[58:56] away from you cuz you've been on a
[58:58] sacred ground with God and God alone and
[59:01] your whole life has changed you become a
[59:03] new creature in Christ and then there
[59:05] ain't enough glory to God hallelujah it
[59:08] makes me feel like preaching he said
[59:09] then there ain't enough devils in hell
[59:11] that can take it away from you you
[59:13] become a new creature a new creation
[59:16] inoculated with the power of almighty
[59:18] God something happened to you let me
[59:21] tell you you say well where is this
[59:23] place that I can meet God where is this
[59:25] place that I could call Holy Ground
[59:27] friends let me tell you something it can
[59:29] be anywhere it can be on a church bench
[59:32] it can be at an altar it can be in a car
[59:35] driving down the road it can be out in
[59:37] the woods out on a deer stand it might
[59:39] be over in the wilderness it might be on
[59:40] a riverbank somewhere but let me tell
[59:42] you those holy grounds can be anywhere
[59:45] it reminds me of a story brother Bown
[59:47] told one time of about that FBI Captain
[59:50] you remember you remember his name was
[59:51] Al alar he and he said you know he had
[59:55] came to me and and he wanted me to meet
[59:57] him so I went down to the office to meet
[59:58] him down there and here he was a of
[1:00:00] course being a captain he said I went
[1:00:02] down in in in in the below the the place
[1:00:04] there was a shooting gallery he said I
[1:00:06] went down to the shooting gallery said
[1:00:07] well what' you call me here for he said
[1:00:09] well you know he said I heard you I
[1:00:11] heard you preach and you know I've been
[1:00:13] always I've been a a Christian and and
[1:00:16] you know I I heard you used to be a
[1:00:17] Baptist and I'm a Baptist and and you
[1:00:20] know you know there but I but there's
[1:00:22] some places that I haven't been able to
[1:00:23] get with God I heard you preaching about
[1:00:25] this Holy Ghost and I know that I've
[1:00:27] never met him I know that I've never had
[1:00:30] that kind of experience and said I just
[1:00:33] you know I thought that that maybe that
[1:00:34] that Holy Ghost That Life of Christ
[1:00:37] would come and and he could come and
[1:00:38] meet me and he would dwell in me the way
[1:00:41] that you preach about him he said so you
[1:00:43] know he said my thoughts were he said I
[1:00:45] thought maybe I'll go rent me a hotel
[1:00:47] suite somewhere I mean you know I he had
[1:00:49] a little bit of money and maybe I can go
[1:00:51] rent the at a fine hotel and get me a
[1:00:53] suite somewhere and we'll I'll dress up
[1:00:55] in a nice suit and and then we'll maybe
[1:00:57] you can come up there and you can invite
[1:00:59] the Lord to come and I'll have a meeting
[1:01:01] with him over there in the hotel that I
[1:01:02] can have the Holy Ghost B said I told
[1:01:05] him I said sir it ain't going to take no
[1:01:07] hotel suite for you to meet him he said
[1:01:09] well where would he meet me at he said
[1:01:11] he'll meet you right here he said you
[1:01:13] mean the Son of God would come down here
[1:01:16] in a shooting gallery to meet me he said
[1:01:18] he'll meet you anywhere he said this one
[1:01:21] I'm talking about he met a man one time
[1:01:24] in the belly of a well he met met
[1:01:26] another man in a fiery furnace he met a
[1:01:28] little woman one time at a Samaritan
[1:01:31] well he met zakus when he was up in a
[1:01:33] tree he met Peter over by a riverbank
[1:01:36] he'll meet you anywhere let me tell you
[1:01:38] friends if you want to have a meeting
[1:01:39] with Jesus those holy grounds or
[1:01:42] wherever you'll meet God he met me on a
[1:01:44] road on the side of a road in a car in
[1:01:47] the middle of Arizona he met Josh Lawson
[1:01:49] sitting at her kitchen table and he'll
[1:01:51] meet you here this morning but man said
[1:01:54] he'll meet you on any ground that you'll
[1:01:56] meet him on hello somebody he said cuz
[1:01:59] God wants to meet you he wants to talk
[1:02:02] it over with you and he'll come wherever
[1:02:04] you are you say well I'm not worthy to
[1:02:07] meet him I say
[1:02:09] Amen I'm not good enough to meet him
[1:02:12] amen I I'm not righteous enough to meet
[1:02:15] God Amen and none of us are and we never
[1:02:19] will be there ain't nothing you could
[1:02:21] put on to make you worthy I thought
[1:02:23] isn't it something that's in order to
[1:02:24] meet God
[1:02:26] we're we're all unworthy to meet him but
[1:02:29] what brought our unworthiness can I take
[1:02:31] a minute what brought our unworthiness
[1:02:33] it wasn't something that you done but it
[1:02:35] was something that happened in the in
[1:02:37] the garden the fall that took place in
[1:02:38] the garden and how that they had fell
[1:02:41] away from the grace of God and he that
[1:02:43] they had that that they had they had uh
[1:02:45] broken the Covenant that God had made
[1:02:47] with man and because of it it brought
[1:02:49] this great fall but notice what happened
[1:02:52] as soon the as the first man fell the
[1:02:55] Bible says but then God went down to
[1:02:58] meet him isn't there something after man
[1:03:00] fell the first thing you see after the
[1:03:03] fall was God going into the garden
[1:03:05] saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou isn't it
[1:03:09] something the first man that sinned I
[1:03:10] don't know about y'all but that does
[1:03:11] something to me this morning the first
[1:03:13] man that ever sinned it brought God down
[1:03:15] to a place searching for a meeting place
[1:03:18] with that man even though the man was
[1:03:20] unrighteous hello even though he was
[1:03:22] unworthy even though he had fell into
[1:03:24] sin even though he had turned turned his
[1:03:26] back on God but the first time a man
[1:03:28] fell it brought God on the scene
[1:03:30] searching for a meeting place with God
[1:03:33] and notice what God did the first time
[1:03:35] that he came to meet a man after he fell
[1:03:37] the Bible says that God slew a lamb and
[1:03:40] he made a covering for him he wasn't
[1:03:43] righteous but God covered him in order
[1:03:45] that he could meet him he made a
[1:03:47] covering for him that he would be able
[1:03:49] to stand in the presence of God I
[1:03:51] thought my isn't it something all the
[1:03:52] way through the Old Testament you see
[1:03:54] this same thing taking place how was men
[1:03:56] and families that they would go and they
[1:03:58] would make they would take sacrifices
[1:04:00] and and they would take them before the
[1:04:02] Lord and sacrifice an animal to make a
[1:04:04] covering for for for their sin that they
[1:04:07] would be able to stand in the presence
[1:04:09] of God and in the Old Testament you'll
[1:04:11] see that the worshipper he would always
[1:04:13] come to God with a blood covering of a
[1:04:15] sacrifice that he made see brother said
[1:04:18] that's why God only meets people under
[1:04:19] the shedding of the blood that's the
[1:04:21] only place he ever will all of Israel
[1:04:24] worshiped under the blood in the New
[1:04:26] Testament we find out it's the same way
[1:04:28] it's under the blood of a sacrifice but
[1:04:30] no longer was it of an animal but it was
[1:04:32] a human sacrifice he said see so God
[1:04:34] he'll never meet you under any Creed or
[1:04:37] under education or he'll never meet you
[1:04:39] under any denomination or some name
[1:04:41] he'll meet you under the blood and that
[1:04:43] is the only place so see now we have two
[1:04:45] things one the physical location don't
[1:04:48] matter and two that it just had to be
[1:04:50] under the blood you say well where does
[1:04:52] the blood cover where does where all
[1:04:55] does the blood cover cover what physical
[1:04:56] place will God go where where do this
[1:04:58] covering go to and I think about I think
[1:05:01] about the the vision that brother
[1:05:03] brandham had when he went that one day
[1:05:05] and went into that old restaurant and
[1:05:08] there was a you know the place in the
[1:05:10] front they they they were they had a
[1:05:12] little bar up there in the front of it
[1:05:13] he said I walked in and I got to look at
[1:05:15] all them people and thinking about the
[1:05:17] the sin that they had and what a just a
[1:05:19] mess of a condition they were all in he
[1:05:22] said I thought you I looked up there and
[1:05:23] there was an old lady sitting up in the
[1:05:25] front and or a young lady she was about
[1:05:27] 65 years old but there was a but she was
[1:05:29] sitting up there in the front said oh
[1:05:31] you know up there smoking a cigarette
[1:05:34] and drinking and and had on filthy
[1:05:36] looking clothes and all this and I
[1:05:37] thought my Lord why wouldn't you just
[1:05:39] wipe this place off the Earth if that if
[1:05:42] that would offend me how much it must
[1:05:44] offend a holy God he said I I thought
[1:05:47] about it I stepped outside and all of a
[1:05:49] sudden I went into a vision and then
[1:05:51] that Vision I looked and I saw the Earth
[1:05:54] and around the Earth Earth there was
[1:05:56] this red covering it was like a you know
[1:05:59] this I'm just saying it my own words but
[1:06:01] like this shield around the earth he
[1:06:03] said and I watched as as these these
[1:06:05] sins that that every time there was a
[1:06:07] sin that was committed it would hit that
[1:06:09] bumper he said I watched I looked up
[1:06:11] there and it was just dented like a like
[1:06:13] a bumper of a car where so many sins has
[1:06:16] HIIT it and he said I thought I said
[1:06:18] Lord is that the sins of the world and
[1:06:20] he said no that is your sins how many
[1:06:23] that had had take place to where was so
[1:06:26] dented up but every time my sin would go
[1:06:28] forth that that bumper would catch it
[1:06:30] and he thought I looked at that and how
[1:06:32] that it was it was that way and I
[1:06:34] thought Lord how could you stand stand
[1:06:36] to look upon it and he said as I thought
[1:06:38] about it he said I looked and laying
[1:06:40] there there was a book that was open and
[1:06:42] it had my name on the top of the book
[1:06:44] and there were all kinds of dark streaks
[1:06:46] in it and I said Lord why don't you
[1:06:48] forgive me he said and I looked and
[1:06:50] Jesus was standing there and he said he
[1:06:52] dipped his finger in the in his side and
[1:06:54] he took blood from his side in this
[1:06:56] vision and he wrote on the book of my
[1:06:58] sins he wrote pardoned he said oh my how
[1:07:02] it made me feel good he said he wrote
[1:07:04] pardon and then he took the book and he
[1:07:06] threw it over behind him he said oh God
[1:07:09] how good that makes me feel that you
[1:07:10] would write pardon on my sins he said
[1:07:13] then the Lord looked at me he said I
[1:07:14] forgive you of your sins but now you
[1:07:17] want to blow her up he said I turned
[1:07:19] around and I went to where the woman was
[1:07:22] and I said lady I got something I want
[1:07:24] to tell you is this seat open and he got
[1:07:26] to witnessing to her and she told him
[1:07:28] she said you know she said I was raised
[1:07:31] in a Christian home my daddy was a
[1:07:32] Baptist preacher and I and I and he told
[1:07:35] me not to get married there was a boy he
[1:07:37] liked to drink he was an alcoholic and I
[1:07:39] got married and had a couple kids and
[1:07:41] and they and they they were raised in a
[1:07:43] Christian home and I I just went down
[1:07:44] the wrong path and I never thought I'd
[1:07:46] end up like this it must be over for
[1:07:49] me he said I sat there for a moment I
[1:07:53] said ma'am it ain't over for you he said
[1:07:56] but as long as you've got life you've
[1:07:57] got hope because the blood of the Lord
[1:08:00] Jesus has this world encircled glory to
[1:08:03] God and God can't even see your
[1:08:06] sins it don't matter where the meeting
[1:08:09] place is the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:11] will cover it there ain't a place you
[1:08:13] can go on this Earth and meet God that
[1:08:15] the blood of the Lord Jesus won't cover
[1:08:17] it here she was sitting on a bar stool
[1:08:19] he said but someday when your life
[1:08:21] passes out beyond that Circle of the
[1:08:23] blood then you'll judge yourself but as
[1:08:25] long as you're in this earth there's
[1:08:28] still hope for you for the blood of
[1:08:30] Jesus Christ it circles the world he
[1:08:32] said and right on the floor of that
[1:08:34] little place that woman knelt down and
[1:08:36] she gave her heart to God and that woman
[1:08:39] that was dead she became alive right
[1:08:41] before my eyes and she went back home
[1:08:43] rejoicing and now she's living and
[1:08:45] she'll live forever more she has eternal
[1:08:48] life she was passed from Death under
[1:08:50] life because she accepted a blood
[1:08:52] covering friends that's what saved us
[1:08:54] many times I saw people that that that
[1:08:56] would sit down on the side of a road in
[1:08:58] India that knelt down and gave their
[1:09:00] heart to God I was sitting outside of a
[1:09:02] meeting one time when a young man walked
[1:09:04] out he said I missed my appointment with
[1:09:06] God when everybody came up to the Altar
[1:09:08] and I should have gave my heart to the
[1:09:09] God and and and I and I guess I've gone
[1:09:11] too far I said friend that altar ain't
[1:09:14] the place to meet God this altar is a
[1:09:16] place to meet God it don't matter where
[1:09:17] we're standing and the same God that'll
[1:09:19] meet you in front of the church is the
[1:09:21] same God that'll meet you right here and
[1:09:23] standing at his car he bowed his head
[1:09:25] and he gave his heart to Jesus Christ to
[1:09:28] recognize a blood covering is the
[1:09:31] meeting place of God he said he'll meet
[1:09:33] you under the blood no matter where it
[1:09:35] is as long as it's under the blood of
[1:09:37] Jesus Christ if you think about this
[1:09:40] this
[1:09:41] morning God is only obligated to send
[1:09:43] his word the way that he promised to
[1:09:46] send it Brother David then we're then
[1:09:49] we're obligated to either accept it or
[1:09:51] to reject it but do you realize that
[1:09:53] when people are searching for God they
[1:09:55] never realize how God is going to come
[1:09:58] you ever notice people are looking for
[1:09:59] God to speak but they don't know how God
[1:10:01] would speak but we see as Believers that
[1:10:04] God speaks to us by his word he uses
[1:10:06] ministers and the five-fold ministry and
[1:10:08] he uses his word to speaks to us it's
[1:10:11] not that God's going to come and speak
[1:10:13] out of some Cloud somewhere everybody's
[1:10:15] looking for some great vision or for
[1:10:17] something for some angel or something to
[1:10:18] appear to them and talk to them but God
[1:10:20] speaks to us by his word see see not
[1:10:23] that God wouldn't send an angel to speak
[1:10:25] to you but but we know God speaks by his
[1:10:27] word see see so when God sends his word
[1:10:30] whether you accept it or reject it will
[1:10:31] determine whether you accept God or
[1:10:33] reject God so when God would speak to
[1:10:36] you by his word brother says see when
[1:10:37] God sends a gift to the earth and the
[1:10:39] people reject it that generation goes
[1:10:41] into Blackness and darkness for
[1:10:43] rejecting God and God judges that
[1:10:45] Generation by the way that they judge
[1:10:47] his gifts that's what Jesus said
[1:10:50] remember he said the queen of the South
[1:10:51] will rise up in judgment against you
[1:10:53] because she traveled for many miles to
[1:10:55] find the wisdom of Solomon and a greater
[1:10:57] than Solomon is here the men of Nineveh
[1:11:00] will rise up in judgment against you
[1:11:02] because they repented at the preaching
[1:11:04] of Jonah and a greater than Jonah is
[1:11:06] here so see there was a gift that was
[1:11:09] upon the Earth and and here Jesus was
[1:11:11] speaking to them because they were
[1:11:12] rejecting the gift that God sent he was
[1:11:15] the greatest gift that God had ever sent
[1:11:17] he was he was trying to tell them that
[1:11:19] they had rejected the message that God
[1:11:22] had sent to them you think about it
[1:11:24] there was many that had done this same
[1:11:25] thing in Sodom notice what happened they
[1:11:28] rejected the message that God sent and
[1:11:30] it brought destruction to Sodom in the
[1:11:32] days of Noah they rejected the message
[1:11:33] of Noah it brought a flood upon the
[1:11:35] Earth and here when Jesus came they
[1:11:37] rejected the message that Jesus had and
[1:11:40] Jesus began to refer back and he would
[1:11:43] of how that there was some groups of
[1:11:45] people there were there were places that
[1:11:48] Generations that had accepted God and he
[1:11:51] gave illustrations of it he said in any
[1:11:53] generation that will receive receive
[1:11:55] God's gift or God's message listen to
[1:11:58] this friends it's so good any generation
[1:12:00] that will receive God's message that
[1:12:02] generation always prospered and become a
[1:12:05] great generation because it's the
[1:12:07] attitude that you take towards any
[1:12:09] Divine gift of God that brings forth the
[1:12:12] results that you get from it so when God
[1:12:14] sends a gift how you receive the gift of
[1:12:17] God is is how you'll get a result from
[1:12:19] that gift so when we're looking for God
[1:12:21] to do something see it's our approach to
[1:12:22] God you remember when Hezekiah he was l
[1:12:25] there on his deathbed looking at sick
[1:12:27] unto death the Bible said Isaiah the
[1:12:29] prophet came unto him and told him to
[1:12:31] get your house in order because Thou
[1:12:32] shalt surely die do you realize Hezekiah
[1:12:34] being a man he could have turned back to
[1:12:36] Isaiah and said I don't have to believe
[1:12:38] you because after all I've got other
[1:12:40] pastors and preachers that tell me that
[1:12:42] your words aren't true but he didn't do
[1:12:45] that the Bible said Hezekiah he heard
[1:12:48] the words of Isaiah and he turned his
[1:12:50] face to the wall and he cried out the
[1:12:52] Lord and he cried for mercy and he asked
[1:12:54] God he said Lord I've stood before you
[1:12:56] all my days I've done my best to serve
[1:12:57] you I pray you'd forgive me for my
[1:12:59] failures I pray you'd help me oh Lord
[1:13:01] Hear My Cry and God stopped his Prophet
[1:13:04] before he ever got too far he said turn
[1:13:06] back around and go tell Hezekiah he has
[1:13:09] 15 more years to live see it was his
[1:13:11] approach to God that brought him from
[1:13:13] Death under life see it's your approach
[1:13:15] to God regardless of the circumstance
[1:13:18] it's your approach to God that brings
[1:13:20] him
[1:13:21] presence regardless of the condition
[1:13:23] it's our approach to God that allows us
[1:13:25] to see the Miracles that God does I
[1:13:29] think about this this
[1:13:31] morning here we found Mary and Martha
[1:13:34] that had lost their brother
[1:13:37] Lazarus Lazarus as he was the Bible said
[1:13:40] they was friends of Jesus he had gone
[1:13:42] off and even when he heard he was sick
[1:13:44] he went on a two- days journey continued
[1:13:47] to tearry him after a little while the
[1:13:50] they came to him he told the disciples
[1:13:53] he said you know he said we've got to go
[1:13:54] back
[1:13:55] I've got a work to do we've got to go
[1:13:58] back and see Lazarus you know the
[1:14:00] disciples they well Lord you know if we
[1:14:02] go there that they you they were pretty
[1:14:04] upset at us last last time we were there
[1:14:07] you know I don't know if it's a good
[1:14:08] idea that we go into that country you
[1:14:09] know they they're pretty torn up the you
[1:14:12] know the Miracles and things that was
[1:14:13] performed and but Jesus when he when he
[1:14:16] told him he said but there's something
[1:14:17] there that I must go back the Bible says
[1:14:20] as they made this journey and he got
[1:14:22] down to where they were and he went to
[1:14:25] talking to Martha I love how that
[1:14:27] Martha approaches Jesus because when he
[1:14:30] speaks to her and he begins you know the
[1:14:33] first things out of her mouth she said
[1:14:35] Lord if you would have been here my
[1:14:36] brother would not have died look at the
[1:14:39] confidence that she had in him but
[1:14:41] nevertheless anything that you had asked
[1:14:43] the Father for I know he would do it I
[1:14:45] thought you know even when she made that
[1:14:47] statement I don't even think that she
[1:14:49] was referring to him raising him from
[1:14:50] the dead because when he said unto her
[1:14:54] well then he'll Rise Again her response
[1:14:57] to that was well I know in the
[1:14:58] resurrection he'll rise but she said you
[1:15:01] know God maybe she was looking for a
[1:15:03] comforter maybe she was looking for God
[1:15:06] to give him a reason of why that it had
[1:15:08] to happen that way maybe she was looking
[1:15:10] for an answer you know why that we had
[1:15:12] lost our loved one like this and maybe
[1:15:14] maybe she was searching for you know why
[1:15:16] why didn't you come whenever he was sick
[1:15:18] and but brother brother Wesley I thought
[1:15:20] of how that whenever Jesus would speak
[1:15:22] to her even in this time that here you
[1:15:25] realized that Martha as she had asked
[1:15:27] him to come that she had so many reasons
[1:15:29] that she could have complained to him
[1:15:32] she could have been so mad and she could
[1:15:34] have she could have said well why didn't
[1:15:36] you come whenever whenever we sent the
[1:15:38] messengers your way to come why wouldn't
[1:15:40] you come you knew he was sick and he
[1:15:41] needed you and he was your friend and
[1:15:43] after all we left our church to follow
[1:15:45] you and now we have nobody to turn to
[1:15:49] and when we needed you you wouldn't even
[1:15:50] come look at how she could have
[1:15:52] approached him she could have said you
[1:15:54] you know we when weever you turned your
[1:15:57] back on us and and we're we're your
[1:15:59] friends and we believed in you and we
[1:16:01] followed you and now we're
[1:16:03] excommunicated from everybody else we've
[1:16:05] been kicked out of the society because
[1:16:07] we had confidence and we followed you
[1:16:08] but right when we needed you the most
[1:16:10] you wouldn't even answer our prayer you
[1:16:12] wouldn't hear us you wouldn't speak to
[1:16:14] us you wouldn't come to us you just
[1:16:15] turned us down we got to
[1:16:18] rebuke you would have thought she had a
[1:16:20] right to say those things as her brother
[1:16:23] lay dead they left their Church to
[1:16:25] follow him they gave up their life to
[1:16:27] follow him but when they needed him the
[1:16:29] most he wasn't there what she could have
[1:16:32] said to him David but you realize that
[1:16:36] brother said every person that comes to
[1:16:38] God he said they got to be tried first
[1:16:41] and your faith has got to be tried so if
[1:16:43] she would have come with that sort of an
[1:16:44] attitude then the miracle would have
[1:16:46] never been
[1:16:47] performed said but no doubt this woman
[1:16:50] had caught a revelation said I think she
[1:16:53] had heard the story of the sh that woman
[1:16:56] I think she had heard the story of how
[1:16:58] that Elisha had gone down to that
[1:16:59] woman's house and remember how she had
[1:17:01] prayed for a son and she had gave Elisha
[1:17:03] a place to sleep and when she wanted a
[1:17:05] son that he get that he told her the
[1:17:07] Lord had blessed her with a child and
[1:17:08] after a few years that that child out in
[1:17:11] the field that he had that he had got in
[1:17:12] the Sun and he had died and he was
[1:17:14] laying on his deathbed and she called
[1:17:16] upon Elisha and said the promised son
[1:17:17] that you given me has
[1:17:19] died but she approached him the right
[1:17:21] way and he went and he gave the boy back
[1:17:23] his life but around said I think she had
[1:17:25] read about the shunamite woman and how
[1:17:27] she approached Elisha he said so she
[1:17:30] approached Jesus the same way my what a
[1:17:32] thought this morning that Martha that in
[1:17:34] her see because she had read of a
[1:17:36] witness of what that shunamite woman had
[1:17:38] done and she thought here I am in this
[1:17:40] same situation and here here my brother
[1:17:42] has died and and I but you know there
[1:17:44] was a woman in the Bible that called
[1:17:45] upon him and maybe her faith be to build
[1:17:48] because because of a witness that she
[1:17:49] had read and all of a sudden she said
[1:17:51] she approached him the same way she said
[1:17:53] if God was in a is Prophet than God must
[1:17:56] be in his son and she called upon him
[1:17:59] and as she called upon him she said
[1:18:01] listen but remember said she said the
[1:18:03] right word she said Lord that was his
[1:18:05] right title if thou would have been here
[1:18:08] my brother would not have died he said
[1:18:09] see she started off the whole
[1:18:11] conversation correctly in the middle of
[1:18:13] all this trouble she said Lord in the
[1:18:17] middle of all the trial she said Lord he
[1:18:20] said and it made favor before God she
[1:18:22] recognized him no matter what he had
[1:18:24] done whether he come or whether he
[1:18:26] didn't come it didn't have one thing to
[1:18:28] do with it she said Lord she gave him
[1:18:30] his right title he said if thou would
[1:18:32] have been here my brother would not have
[1:18:33] died but whatever you ask God will give
[1:18:36] it to you even in her grief and her
[1:18:38] sorrow she called him Lord no matter
[1:18:40] what condition that she was in she
[1:18:42] called him Lord friends don't you
[1:18:44] realize it don't matter what state we're
[1:18:45] in this morning it's our approach to God
[1:18:48] that brings a miracle it's our approach
[1:18:50] to God that brings the sign of his
[1:18:52] resurrection it's our approach to God
[1:18:54] that brings the Supernatural how we
[1:18:56] approach God the only reason she
[1:18:59] experienced a resurrection is because of
[1:19:02] her approach to him and notice what
[1:19:05] happened because of her approach Oh
[1:19:07] Glory to God the Bible said because she
[1:19:10] approached him this way they sent
[1:19:11] Runners down to Mary's can I just preach
[1:19:13] a minute we're we're we're here anyhow
[1:19:15] but she sent Runners down to Mary's
[1:19:17] house and the Bible said they went
[1:19:18] following after Mary the whole audience
[1:19:20] of people said well baby she's going
[1:19:22] down to the tomb to grieve cuz Mary
[1:19:24] heard that Jesus was down at the tomb of
[1:19:25] Lazarus and she came down and they
[1:19:27] gather around this great tomb and many
[1:19:29] of the the crowd had gathered around and
[1:19:32] the Bible said they were weeping and
[1:19:33] they were in sorrow and their hearts
[1:19:35] were broken because of the death of
[1:19:36] their loved one can you imagine the
[1:19:38] condition they were in and how that that
[1:19:40] that many of them were looking there
[1:19:42] such a mixed audience stood there that
[1:19:44] day but Jesus he put all of it out and
[1:19:46] the Bible said he looked at that tomb
[1:19:49] and he spoke out with a loud voice he
[1:19:51] said Lazarus come forth and when he said
[1:19:54] those words the dead came forth bound
[1:19:57] handed foot I thought my whenever Jesus
[1:20:00] spoke here come that old mummified
[1:20:01] looking body the Bible said he was still
[1:20:03] wrapped in grave clothes and a napkin
[1:20:05] upon his face and when he come walking
[1:20:07] out of that grave Jesus said loose him
[1:20:10] and let him
[1:20:12] free well let me tell you what happened
[1:20:14] friends because she approached God she
[1:20:17] was a witness of the resurrection and
[1:20:19] let me tell you what happened the devil
[1:20:21] couldn't take I wish I had a voice to
[1:20:22] preach this morning the devil couldn't
[1:20:24] handle it no more whenever she when she
[1:20:26] whenever she seen a resurrection the
[1:20:28] Bible said then the council of Pharisees
[1:20:30] got together and said do you know what
[1:20:32] just happened that Jesus went down there
[1:20:34] and he raised a man from the grave many
[1:20:36] of them witnessed it happened and they
[1:20:38] said if we don't do something about this
[1:20:39] we're going to lose our churches if we
[1:20:41] don't do something about it we're going
[1:20:42] to lose our nation we'll lose confidence
[1:20:44] of people they're all going to follow
[1:20:46] him and none of them are going to follow
[1:20:48] us and the Bible said but one of them
[1:20:49] raised up by the name of Caiaphas he
[1:20:51] said consider it is expedient for us
[1:20:54] that if if one man should die for the
[1:20:56] people that the whole nation would not
[1:20:57] perish and the Bible said from that day
[1:21:00] forward they took counsel together to
[1:21:03] put him to death I thought isn't it
[1:21:05] something that at one Resurrection is
[1:21:08] all it took to push Satan over the edge
[1:21:12] one Resurrection is all it took and War
[1:21:14] was declared on him for the miracle of
[1:21:17] the Resurrection you say h well what
[1:21:19] would happen today if people would
[1:21:21] witness such a power what would happen
[1:21:24] today if they would experience Christ in
[1:21:25] that way let me tell you what would
[1:21:27] happen if this world would turn to Jesus
[1:21:29] Christ and they would experience him in
[1:21:31] the power of his resurrection the
[1:21:33] synagogues would empty the denominations
[1:21:35] would empty and people would follow
[1:21:37] Jesus Christ again Satan knew who he was
[1:21:40] I often wonder if that ain't why
[1:21:42] whenever he called him upon the mountain
[1:21:44] in the wilderness that he didn't tempt
[1:21:46] him and say to him if thou were the Son
[1:21:48] of God let these Stones be made into
[1:21:49] bread but now he didn't he wasn't up
[1:21:52] there just trying to see what power that
[1:21:53] he had now he had done witnessed it for
[1:21:56] himself he saw him heal the sick hello
[1:21:58] somebody he saw him give a blinded eyes
[1:22:02] and and open them he saw him make the
[1:22:04] lame walk he saw him turn water into
[1:22:06] wine and now he saw him take something
[1:22:08] was dead and give it life again and
[1:22:11] Satan made a declaration brother Jared
[1:22:13] when he saw that one Resurrection it
[1:22:15] stirred up something and Satan said we
[1:22:17] can't have this it'll cause everybody to
[1:22:19] turn to him so he made a declaration
[1:22:22] I'll tell you what we'll do from this
[1:22:23] day forward we'll do what we have to do
[1:22:26] to kill that man off this earth now his
[1:22:28] power has been displayed and Satan made
[1:22:31] himself a military strategy it was
[1:22:33] called operation kill the Son of God and
[1:22:35] they went together around had little
[1:22:37] house meetings and and meet group
[1:22:39] meetings and they come in the counsil
[1:22:41] together and try to plot up ways that
[1:22:43] they were going to kill the Son of God
[1:22:45] but let me tell you friends if Satan had
[1:22:47] a military strategy so did God God had
[1:22:50] one it was called operation resurrection
[1:22:53] and it didn't matter what Satan done
[1:22:55] Jesus said you can destroy this Temple
[1:22:57] but in 3 days I'll raise it up again let
[1:23:00] me tell you what our chief Captain done
[1:23:02] Brother David he didn't hide in a bunker
[1:23:03] to fight the devil he went down to the
[1:23:05] front line and Jesus Christ declared war
[1:23:08] on the devil and he and he went down
[1:23:10] into the depths of hell and he
[1:23:12] infiltrated the gates of hell and he set
[1:23:14] those that were captive by death and he
[1:23:16] set them free the souls that were in
[1:23:19] prison he set free what a plan that God
[1:23:22] had brother bam said when they crucified
[1:23:24] him at Calvary the world thought they
[1:23:26] had him death thought they had him hell
[1:23:29] thought it had him the devil thought it
[1:23:31] had him but every but he broke every
[1:23:33] seal and not only did he climb through
[1:23:36] Calvary but beyond every moon and the
[1:23:38] star and he sets on the right hand of
[1:23:41] the Majesty tonight and His Eye Is on
[1:23:43] the Sparrow and I know he watches
[1:23:46] me he climbed through Calvary he didn't
[1:23:49] stop on Calvary but above every moon and
[1:23:52] star that sit on the right hand of the m
[1:23:54] majesty and we are beneficiaries tonight
[1:23:57] of that
[1:23:58] Resurrection we're benefiting from this
[1:24:00] Resurrection let me tell you how Paul
[1:24:03] spoke this Paul preached this in
[1:24:05] Colossians the 2 chapter did I got just
[1:24:07] a minute to finish up Paul said we were
[1:24:10] buried with him in baptism somebody say
[1:24:13] amen he said wherein you're also risen
[1:24:16] with him through the faith of the
[1:24:18] operation of God who hath raised him
[1:24:21] from the dead operation Resurrection is
[1:24:23] still in effect amen you were risen with
[1:24:26] him through the operation of God who ha
[1:24:29] raised him from the dead we were dead in
[1:24:32] sin because of our first man had fallen
[1:24:34] our representative Adam had fallen and
[1:24:37] it caused death to set in on the human
[1:24:39] race it didn't have nothing to do with
[1:24:41] you you didn't cause it sickness and
[1:24:44] death we deserve death because of our
[1:24:46] birth the way we come into this Earth we
[1:24:49] deserve death because of the way we were
[1:24:51] even born but Paul said but you being
[1:24:54] dead in your sins and uncircumcision of
[1:24:56] your
[1:24:57] flesh hath he quickened together with
[1:24:59] him having forgiven all your Tres passes
[1:25:04] blotting out the
[1:25:06] ordinances all your blotting out the
[1:25:08] ordinance listen your trespasses that
[1:25:10] were recorded think about it the Bible
[1:25:12] says they were placed in a
[1:25:14] handwriting as a bond against you a
[1:25:17] binding legal document Brother David
[1:25:20] that were written against you this is
[1:25:22] what brother man was looking at when he
[1:25:23] saw his name written on on on on that
[1:25:25] book of all his sins it was a a document
[1:25:27] that was that was that was signed that
[1:25:29] was filled with your sins because of
[1:25:31] your old nature because of your first
[1:25:33] birth here there was a bond that was
[1:25:35] handwritten that was against you but
[1:25:37] when Jesus forgave us Paul said but he
[1:25:40] blotted out the handwriting of the
[1:25:41] ordinances that was against us what was
[1:25:44] contrary to us and he took it out of the
[1:25:46] way my isn't that a wonderful word the
[1:25:50] thing that stood between you and
[1:25:52] God listen friends
[1:25:54] let me speak to you just a minute Paul
[1:25:57] said the thing that stood between you
[1:25:59] and God Jesus took it out of the way let
[1:26:03] me ask you what is it that separates
[1:26:05] from you from God Paul said Jesus took
[1:26:08] it out of the way what is it in your
[1:26:10] life that keeps you from going on with
[1:26:12] God what is it that keeps you from being
[1:26:13] filled with the Holy Ghost what is it
[1:26:15] that keeps you from being so committed
[1:26:17] to God and allowing God to use you but
[1:26:19] Paul said but Jesus took it out of the
[1:26:21] way it don't matter what it is he took
[1:26:24] it out of the way he made a path in
[1:26:27] order for you to be able to to approach
[1:26:30] God the very thing that stood between
[1:26:32] you he took it from you and listen what
[1:26:34] he said and he nailed it to his cross
[1:26:38] are y'all hearing that this morning he
[1:26:40] took that was what was written against
[1:26:41] you I wish I had me a nail this morning
[1:26:44] he took that what was written against
[1:26:45] you can you imagine all the sins this
[1:26:47] ain't a big enough book for me let me
[1:26:48] find a bigger book he took all the sins
[1:26:51] that was written against you written in
[1:26:52] real small letters brother Logan and and
[1:26:54] all those things that was written
[1:26:55] against you all your life I could just
[1:26:57] see Satan recording everything that you
[1:26:59] ever done every day and every night he
[1:27:01] followed you into every dark alley he
[1:27:03] followed you into every pool hall he
[1:27:04] went into every drug house he went into
[1:27:06] every bar he went into every place
[1:27:08] you've ever been and he wrote it down he
[1:27:10] followed you it was a handwritten bill
[1:27:12] that was against every part of your life
[1:27:14] but Paul said but Jesus Took the book
[1:27:16] and he went down when he hung on the
[1:27:18] cross and he nailed it on the cross of
[1:27:20] Calvary and he took it out of the way
[1:27:23] that that wouldn't nothing that would
[1:27:25] stand between you and God and he threw
[1:27:27] it over behind him that it couldn't
[1:27:29] stand between you and him I thank God
[1:27:31] that there ain't nothing stands between
[1:27:33] you and God
[1:27:36] hallelujah he took it out of the way and
[1:27:39] he nailed it to his cross that there
[1:27:41] wouldn't be nothing standing your way oh
[1:27:43] friends let me tell you the devil's a
[1:27:45] liar this morning that think you can't
[1:27:47] get a alone with God to say you can't
[1:27:49] have a meeting with God to say you can't
[1:27:51] move forward with God to say you can't
[1:27:53] be filled with Holy Ghost he's a liar
[1:27:55] this morning and God took it out of the
[1:27:57] way that you could stand with him nailed
[1:28:01] it to his cross and Paul said he spoiled
[1:28:04] the principalities and powers and he
[1:28:06] made a show of them openly triumphing in
[1:28:10] them in it he didn't beat him privately
[1:28:13] it wasn't some little secret affair done
[1:28:15] in the back room isn't that good he
[1:28:17] didn't go in the back room make a deal
[1:28:18] with the Devil look if you'll leave
[1:28:19] these people alone well then I it wasn't
[1:28:22] like that the Bible said he may have
[1:28:24] show of him openly that everybody in the
[1:28:27] world would be able to to be able to
[1:28:28] witness what God had done he said he
[1:28:30] beat him publicly so everybody could see
[1:28:33] it that every one of us would be able to
[1:28:35] witness the resurrection that Jesus had
[1:28:38] it was an open show let me tell you
[1:28:40] friends one day that same Jesus that
[1:28:43] went down that in on the cross of
[1:28:45] Calvary that same one that came up out
[1:28:47] of the Grave Brother David one day he'll
[1:28:49] come riding out of Glory just as sure as
[1:28:51] I'm standing here as real as we're
[1:28:53] standing here this morning I'm going to
[1:28:54] tell you he'll come riding now it'll be
[1:28:56] like it was that day on the Mount of
[1:28:58] Olives whenever Jesus came riding into
[1:29:00] town and the Bible said there was such a
[1:29:02] worship that went forth but it'll be
[1:29:04] much greater than that and he won't be
[1:29:06] riding on no mule he'll be riding on a
[1:29:08] white horse he'll be he'll be covered
[1:29:10] robed in the righteousness of the saints
[1:29:12] of God and his vesture dipped in blood
[1:29:14] written on him will be called the King
[1:29:16] of Kings and the Lord of lords and
[1:29:18] behind him will be the armies of the
[1:29:20] Living
[1:29:22] God brother said there'll be two groups
[1:29:24] that are witnessed that event one will
[1:29:26] be crying and weeping and wailing but
[1:29:27] the other group will be rejoicing and
[1:29:30] shouting and singing and every one of us
[1:29:32] will be a witness in one group or the
[1:29:35] other so you make your decision this
[1:29:37] morning of which group you will be with
[1:29:41] they'll all see that great event I say
[1:29:44] this Lord let me be a witness of the
[1:29:46] power of the Resurrection I want to have
[1:29:49] a front row seat I want to see the
[1:29:52] Saints when they come up out of the
[1:29:53] grave
[1:29:55] glory to God I feel like preaching Lord
[1:29:57] let me be a let me have a front row seat
[1:29:59] to the Sons and Daughters of God as they
[1:30:01] come up out of the grave and have a
[1:30:02] reunion with their loved ones Let Me Be
[1:30:05] A Witness of that I want to see him with
[1:30:07] his crown king of kings and Lord of
[1:30:10] lords I want to see him when the Nations
[1:30:12] bow down to him Lord let me be there on
[1:30:14] that day to witness that let me be on
[1:30:17] the right side of it Lord to witness the
[1:30:19] crowning of a king to witness the
[1:30:22] resurrection
[1:30:24] you realize that's what they were
[1:30:25] waiting on I'm going to close with this
[1:30:28] on the day of
[1:30:30] Pentecost brother Wesley many of them
[1:30:33] they had they wern't there when he come
[1:30:34] out of a tomb they hadn't seen him in
[1:30:37] his glorified body they they didn't see
[1:30:40] him when he ascended there were many
[1:30:42] that gathered out there the Bible said
[1:30:43] there was 3,000 that was believe it was
[1:30:45] 3,000 the the souls that were saved that
[1:30:47] day many of them they weren't there
[1:30:48] they' never seen the
[1:30:50] resurrection but you think about those
[1:30:52] that gathered in the upper room
[1:30:55] but They Carried and they waited that
[1:30:57] they would be able to witness it
[1:30:59] nevertheless see they had a promise from
[1:31:01] God that this Spirit would come that the
[1:31:04] spirit would be poured back upon the
[1:31:05] Earth and on the day of Pentecost when
[1:31:07] the Holy Spirit was poured into those
[1:31:09] people that same man Jesus the very
[1:31:12] Spirit of the man Jesus that walked upon
[1:31:14] the Earth was poured out on that
[1:31:17] congregation brother wesy they were so
[1:31:19] filled with the spirit of God that the
[1:31:21] Bible says that the people outside
[1:31:23] thought they were abund bunch of drunk
[1:31:24] men do you realize that people have gone
[1:31:26] to churches their whole life and never
[1:31:28] had that kind of experience with God cuz
[1:31:30] people are so carnal mind minded and so
[1:31:33] worldly minded they come to church and
[1:31:34] church is such a carnal place let me
[1:31:36] tell you friends I don't care if you
[1:31:38] come to church I want you to get into
[1:31:39] Christ it a it ain't about filling up a
[1:31:42] church building it's about getting into
[1:31:44] Christ I want to see people that get so
[1:31:46] that get so wrapped up in the spirit of
[1:31:48] God that you can come to the house of
[1:31:49] God and it ain't just a place to go to
[1:31:52] hear some word and have all this world
[1:31:54] on our mind but then we could enter into
[1:31:55] the presence of God you say how will we
[1:31:58] do it we have to approach God the right
[1:32:00] way we have to cast off the world and
[1:32:02] the thoughts and the things of the Flesh
[1:32:04] and approach God the right way and say
[1:32:06] God would you beat me here this morning
[1:32:08] and God is just to do
[1:32:10] that can we meet him can we approach him
[1:32:13] the right way can we call upon the name
[1:32:15] of the Lord can we cry out to God is
[1:32:17] there a sincere Soul still left today
[1:32:20] that'll call upon the name of the Lord
[1:32:21] and say Lord I want to witness the res
[1:32:24] Direction the Bible said when it fell
[1:32:26] upon them they went out like a bunch of
[1:32:28] drunk men people made fun of them
[1:32:30] because the way they were acting but
[1:32:31] Peter jumped up he said oh you men of
[1:32:33] Jerusalem these men ain't as drunk as
[1:32:35] you suppose he said but this is that
[1:32:37] that the prophet Joel spoke of that the
[1:32:39] that the that the spirit of God would
[1:32:41] fall upon All Flesh there a fulfillment
[1:32:44] of the prophecy of God and brother B
[1:32:46] said when that Spirit falls on a
[1:32:48] Congregation of people it will the same
[1:32:50] results will always take place you see
[1:32:54] what's missing in the churches today
[1:32:57] it's the spirit of God falling upon the
[1:32:59] congregation of people you say brother
[1:33:02] Matt what's it take to be that to have
[1:33:04] that kind of a witness it takes a people
[1:33:07] that will approach God the right way it
[1:33:10] takes a people that will go to church
[1:33:12] and Brother David their Church isn't
[1:33:15] just a place to go or a place to
[1:33:16] fellowship or a place to be seen or a
[1:33:18] place to have a membership but they go
[1:33:20] to church to have an experience with God
[1:33:22] they go to church to have communion when
[1:33:24] you walk in the doors of the assembly
[1:33:26] it's a place that you come come to have
[1:33:28] fellowship with God it's a place you
[1:33:30] come you may be going through things
[1:33:32] with your wife Oh Glory here I go you
[1:33:34] may have been fighting outside on your
[1:33:35] way here but when you come in the house
[1:33:37] of God you can let all that go and say
[1:33:39] Lord I come to have fellowship with you
[1:33:41] this morning Lord I pray you let all
[1:33:43] those things go by all the trouble at
[1:33:45] work and all the problems that I've had
[1:33:46] this week God I pray You' Let It Fade
[1:33:48] Away and let me enter into the presence
[1:33:50] of God and when people approach God that
[1:33:53] way way the spirit of the Lord will fall
[1:33:56] it'll fall upon every heart he said the
[1:33:58] same results will take place by their
[1:34:00] fruits the church has known the world is
[1:34:02] wondering what's going on he said
[1:34:04] they'll never understand it because they
[1:34:06] don't know God but it's just the holy
[1:34:08] spirit being a witness of Christ
[1:34:12] testifying of the Resurrection he said
[1:34:15] we're so glad to know that he lives and
[1:34:17] Reigns today and he has not left his
[1:34:19] church without a witness of his
[1:34:22] resurrection as the music players come
[1:34:24] this morning let me ask you this who
[1:34:28] would be a
[1:34:30] witness how many could say Lord that's
[1:34:32] my desire to be a witness of the
[1:34:35] Resurrection I wasn't there the day in
[1:34:38] my physical body to see him come out of
[1:34:40] a tomb but I want to be a witness of the
[1:34:43] Resurrection say how can you be a
[1:34:45] witness of today let your life be a
[1:34:47] testimony of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ be so filled with the spirit of
[1:34:53] God you realize that's the only witness
[1:34:55] that God has is the spirit of God living
[1:34:58] in you that's what testifies to this
[1:35:01] world it's the Life of Christ Living in
[1:35:03] a man's heart and how that he would go
[1:35:07] and testify and they'll see that same
[1:35:09] Jesus that walked upon the Earth they'll
[1:35:12] see him walking in you isn't it
[1:35:13] something not in a pair of sandals with
[1:35:16] the robe
[1:35:17] on but to think that Jesus would walk
[1:35:21] around this Earth
[1:35:24] Brother David Paul and walk around with
[1:35:27] a gray suit on this
[1:35:28] morning with a pair of size tins dress
[1:35:33] shoes
[1:35:34] on Jesus walking around in human flesh
[1:35:38] again I want to be a witness of the
[1:35:40] Resurrection Lord let me be a true
[1:35:43] witness how is he walking around today
