to get something from me you've came to the wrong place I don't have nothing to give amen but in the word is life amen I just pray that the Lord would come and anoint the word of God that he could minister to our hearts and brother Mark we uh you can't make people come to church and sit on the edge of their seats but I know what the Bible says the Bible says they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled blessed are they that hunger and thirst I wonder how many this morning could say I come hungering and thirsting after the words of life amen it's the very thing that'll take us into a Rapture it'll heal our bodies it'll give us strength it'll it'll pick us up whenever we're down it's the words of eternal life amen I wonder if if we could just tap into our soul this morning to find that there's a need there and to draw from God and say Lord let me receive something from you this morning amen amen why don't we just bow our heads this morning as we get ready to open the word of God and maybe there's something in the word and you just need the Lord to come by and speak to you and just let everything else go and just have a a moment with the Lord and let all the questions all the thing just Let It Fade Away just give it to him this morning say Lord would you come and speak to my heart could each one of us ask in the name of Jesus Christ Lord how we come before you this morning and Lord we know the weakness of our flesh and the failures that we have and Lord I I realize Lord the the the inability Lord when I stand before a body of Believers that are charged and Lord here they come in expectation to receive something from you and Lord how it makes us realize that we don't have anything to offer Lord outside of the word of God and Lord but I pray Lord this morning morning that you would take the gift that you've placed in our life and Lord I ask you Lord that you would allow me to surrender Lord may I give everything to you this morning and Lord I don't have nothing that I would want to say but God may you take this voice and speak to your children and God may you put a desire in the hearts of the Believers to pull from the word of God and Lord may you come in a supernatural way Lord God we we we realize these are a great people it's the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord and I believe it this morning that she's deserving of hearing from the master and Lord not to hear from me but to hear from you and God we give you the Liberty this morning to be able to speak and we'll give you the glory for all that's done and said in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen amen my goodness won't we just invite you to the scripture to the Book of Genesis in the 18th chapter we're going to start in the first verse and it's kind of a lengthy reading uh but we'll just go uh quickly through it and and just want to say this morning I sure appreciate appreciate the the brother's help yesterday had a lot out out working on the working on the building and sure appreciate the the help to do that and uh when and when and where we can get it we take it so we we just want to move a little bit further along looking forward to our meetings we have our fiveyear anniversary meetings coming up on February the 29th and we have some wonderful brothers that are coming brother uh brother Wayne Lawson and brother Andrew Glover will be speaking also brother Tim PR and uh be coming and somebody asked me that was it brother Timothy although we love brother Timothy but it's brother Tim the pastor at in the evening light Tabernacle becoming and doing the uh the service there so just look forward to having them with us how many's looking forward to that meeting amen so we want to read this morning out of Genesis the 18th chapter and the Bible says and the Lord appeared unto unto him speaking of Abraham in the plains of mamry and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and he looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and he bowed himself toward the ground and he said my Lord if now I have found favor watch how he answers them all of a sudden here they are appearing he says my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched that you could wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you shall pass on and therefore are you come for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou Hast said and Abraham hastened unto the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knad it and make cakes upon the herth and Abraham ran unto the herd and he fetched a calf tender and good and he gave it unto the young man and it hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf that he had dressed and he set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto the cording of the time of life and lo Sarah thy life wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it from the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assurity bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said no but you did laugh and the men rose up from then and they looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him my isn't that good isn't that something wonderful for the Lord to say about a a man he said for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know and the men turned their faces from th and they went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats Abraham stood yet before the Lord now last uh Sunday we had started on this subject on the nature of Elohim and I I you know we've been several Brothers fellowshipping around about it this week and it's certainly been on my heart and and uh but I just thought there was so much power in this word and and the Revelation that lies in this last week uh we had had went through the name Elohim and the attributes that that came with it and the Very nature of Elohim being the nature of God and uh we we found this this word Elohim actually first appears in the Bible in the Book of Genesis in the beginning God it's the first time that God has ever talked about it's the first time he's ever wrote about brother Mark but it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that's the word Elohim in the beginning Elohim and and of course you realize that this word Elohim is so much of a better fit for the word god than the word that we use in the English language see uh he said see uh the word God to us means an object of worship so when we talk about God anything could be a God if you've ever been overseas or I've been many missionary trips in India and there's so many different gods everything anything that grows out of the ground can be a God if the Stag TI in the cave was a God I I literally watched with my own eyes as children and men and women knelt down and bowed down in a cave and and put uh money and put flowers and put it on the on the stalagmite and the stalagtite and and here they're worshiping something that they that they don't understand how it got there but but but to them it was a God to them and so the word God is not enough to call God because it can be so many things but butam said see but the word Elohim is a different word he said see because Elohim means the self-existing one he says see so these Gods like if you wanted to make the piano a god well the piano couldn't be self-existent it could be a God to somebody but it could never be a self-existent it couldn't it couldn't exist without anything else it has to be something has to make it or it had to have been created it had to been made in such a way so he says see this word Elohim that Moses had wrote In the Beginning Elohim is a better word for God because Elohim God can mean anything but Elohim can't mean that way because it is God that always existed he was a a self-existing god brother Mark he existed when there was no air he existed when there was no light it was there was no creation there was no stars there was no Earth there was no soul system or and I understand as a body of Believers when we use the word God we're actually referring to Elohim we're not referring to uh has people would would Loosely use this word as a God or God but but in our hearts we may not say the word Elohim but when we say God as Believers we're referring to Elohim we're referring uh to the self-existing god the one that created the world the one that made the the stars and the universe and the heavens and the Earth that we live in but we realize that God is self-existing he was in the beginning he was God Alone brother David he was alone with his thoughts and and although that may be hard to comprehend because we're creatures of time it's hard to understand that Elohim in the beginning had no no beginning because everything in our life is is has a beginning and has an end it has a a life and it has a death it has a start and it has a stop so our our nature is is where does it come from and what is the beginning of it but Elohim he had no beginning he was a self-existent God he was here before there was anything that was made it was a before anything existed and and we and and last week when we had started on this we had went into the word Elohim and how that Elohim was a plural word and so and and whenever we read this it actually would show us Moses's revelation of the name Elohim in that Moses knew he had a revelation from God that every characteristic that God had was in the name Elohim so even the the theologians today when they would speak of Elohim they say it's plural so there must be more than one God he must be a father and a son and a holy ghost he must there may be three Gods because after all Elohim was a plural word but but we realize that it wasn't that the plurality of Elohim it wasn't the the different gods but it was the nature that was in God God he was a father he was a son he was a savior he was a Healer he was the very attributes of God and so so we re we realize that Moses had a had a revelation of what Elohim was so when he very first starts to write yeah how many knows Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible and so as he's writing these B uh books here Moses was a prophet of God inspired by the word of or inspired by God brother Mark and by inspiration he caught the revelation of the name Elohim the very first time it's ever written down in history was by a man named Moses he had a he had to have a revelation of God when he wrote In the Beginning Elohim in the beginning Elohim a created light in the beginning Elohim he made man in the beginning see Moses had a revelation of who God was and but Mark that that very Revelation that Moses had is how that he would recognize God when he saw him in a burning bush here when he had no feature of a man when he when he was just a voice in a bush but because he had an understanding of who God was and he had a he had a knowing that God was was was in his attributes and that God he may not come he didn't come in the same form every time that a man saw him and so he would be able to recognize him in a burning bush and and when Moses would come to the bush notice how he so knew that it was God brother Joe that he would be he would ask God the question he said God show me thy glory and the Lord would answer back he said thou cast not see my face for no man shall see me and live brother Mark he knew that he was there he knew he was in the presence of a supernatural God in so much that he said God show me your face but he said no man can see my face and live oh my isn't it something that God would reveal to his Prophet what no man knew here was a man brother Wesley that was hundreds of years after creation or thousands of years after creation down through Abraham and the children of Israel and a nation that was born and they had went into bondage of Israel now here comes a man named Moses it wasn't the F first man on the Earth but he was the first man that that God came to speak to to begin to reveal the secrets of the hearts of God that he could write it down in a book that we could read it today you realize brother Mark he was a man that was revealed to the very mysteries of God it was a prophet that God revealed to him and and as he begin to write these first five books you we we we read it as the books of the Bible the Hebrews the Israelites they read it as the Torah that's what they call the first five books and or or maybe some would refer to it as the laws of Moses but nevertheless it's the oldest record that we have and it's the only record of the creation came from God speaking to a prophet hear me now somebody the only record of creation that we have comes from God Elohim speaking to a prophet of God that he would be able to take the Revelation that God gave him and write it down that we would even know what creation was or where we came from or how we existed or or where or or or where our end shall be even even David would write about it all through the Bible you'll find this to be the case that it was a revelation that came from God given to his prophet and the Bible would say David when he would talk to Solomon notice how he said it he said I charge uh or to keep the charge of the Lord Elohim keep the the charge of God but notice when he would talk about the charge of God that would come to Solomon he said keep his Commandments keep his statutes keep his judgments keep his testimonies as it is written in the laws of Moses so here David would even recognize that the very words that Moses wrote were not Moses's words they weren't the thoughts of Moses they weren't just an inspiration of Moses but it was the very charge of Elohim it was God the Creator that had came down and spoke to his prophet and had given him direction for the church and for the people of God David said but keep the charge of the Lord Elohim keep when as it's written down in the laws of Moses for he would write in Psalms 103 David say because God has made known his ways unto Moses Now isn't that something to hear that God made known his ways unto Moses I thought that was quite striking because when Paul would talk about the ways of God listen what Paul would say in Romans 11 he said God's ways are past finding out but here David would write that God revealed his ways unto Moses Paul would say God's ways are past finding out but David said but God made known his ways unto Moses let me tell you friends what this is is that God's ways are beyond our Understanding God's ways are past our searching and and it's past our digging you can never be able to find it out you could study all you want to You'll Never Find the ways of God you can dig all you want to you can take the greatest ministers and the greatest theologians and the greatest pastors and brother Mark you can dig into the word of God and you'll never find out the ways of God because the Bible would tell us that the only way the ways of God would ever be made known would be first revealed unto a prophet of God for Amos said he said surely the Lord God will do nothing unless he would first reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets and brother Mark that ain't just for the past that ain't just for the present it's for the future it's for everything that God has ever done he said I'll never do one thing unless I reveal it first unto my servant the prophets that's the ways of God and the ways of God cannot change that's the only way that we would know the ways of God brother Wesley is it would come through the mouthpiece of a prophet of God that you and I could believe it by faith God made known his ways unto Moses they wasn't made known to the world but he revealed them to Moses that's the way that we would have access to the ways of God was through the mouthpiece of a prophet listen to how brother R say he said see God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and they're past finding out but then the next words he said to the carnal mind God ways are P finding out in another place God's ways are pass finding out intellectually they're past finding out to the mind they're past finding out intellectual you see the you see the difference that don't mean that it couldn't that the that the ways of God wouldn't be revealed unto the hearts of the believer listen he says see if you could explain the ways of God then you wouldn't have to walk by faith anyone if anyone could explain God it would not be necessary to have faith because you know that's the way we walk we walk by faith so we accept the word of God we don't reason it out we don't try to reason it because you can't reason because God's ways are past fing out you can't reason God you don't know him by knowledge hello somebody that's the way the whole world is trying to find God you're trying to you come to church after church after church trying to get a grasp on God and trying to to find out who he is and and find a relationship with God but you'll never know God by knowledge you'll never be able to meet him that way you'll never have communion with him that way you'll never have a relationship with God by knowledge you don't know him by knowledge you don't know him by education you'll not know him you'll not know him by anything that a man could give you but the only way to know God is to know God by faith but remember say this he said it's unreasonable to believe that you could reason out God is't that a statement it's unreasonable to believe that you could reason out God that you could understand God by reasoning or the knowledge of a man this little finite mind that you can't even use it for for 20 minutes in a service before it floats off out in the wilderness and it goes to the job it goes to the house project it goes to the problems at home it you can't even focus it on the word of God for a few minutes to be able to receive something for God for for for just a few minutes at a time that's how fin our mind is and to think that that little mind that we have I know some of you maybe think you got great big ones but it ain't no bigger than the next guys that little mind that we have brother Mark it will never understand the ways of God the only way to know God is by faith you can't you can't you can't just you can't just hear it you have to accept it and accept it by faith here brother in a prayer line he would begin to talk about the ways of God he said he said he had a lady come up to the prayer line he said Do you believe the Lord she said his mighty works are past finding out listen he said believe believe people his presence is here his mighty works are past finding out but he Reveals His secrets to his servants so the ways of God the only way to know the ways of God would be through the servant the prophet not only does he say it brother Mah but then he would prove it he said the only way to find the ways of God is he would reveal his secrets to his servants and then he turns right around after making this statement here's a woman that is standing in the prayer line after making this statement he proves the very statement that he says he says how do you do sister you believe me to be a servant of God with all your heart do you believe it you've had a lot of trouble haven't you I'm not reading your mind but you realize you're in the presence of something besides a man isn't that right you had an operation there's a tumor or something you had it you had it again in this time the Lord Jesus is going to make you well are you believing that with all your heart the Lord Jesus is here she says amen that is exactly the truth I had a tumor and the tumor came back and here a man of God would stand before now how would the man know the man didn't know it but the God that was the god of Elohim the very same God that spoke to Moses the same God that's in the Bible that the world has put in a history book somewhere stood before this same woman and said but the secrets of God are revealed to his servants and he began to tell her the things that was going on in her life brother Mark and then as she began to walk away he said hey just wait a minute he said you have been healed before that's right he said you were in the prayer line last night and the Lord healed you from that he said it's gone from you right now you're standing here and it's already gone from you he said but you got something else on your heart I see a man walking away from you it's your husband he left you two years ago and you want to ask him to return is that right sis well may the Lord grant it in the name of Jesus Christ here friends before an audience of thousands of people that would sit around and people hundreds and hundreds of people through a prayer line one after the next after the next that a gift of God would begin to discern the hearts of people it wasn't mind reading it wasn't mental telepathy as the newspapers would write about it it was the very Elohim God speaking through a man and giving the very Discerning the heart of a little woman that had a need from God friends it ain't no dead God that we serve he's still the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever he proved what he quoted let me tell you friends this may be a bold statement to some of you but William bram's Ministry was the greatest Vindication that Moses ever had the world searches for the Vindication of Moses they go digging in the trenches and they look in the Red Sea and they're trying to find a wagon wheel that they could even believe Moses they'll they'll try to find something that well there maybe there's a a left of a spear of one of those Egyptian armies and they go digging around in the dirt trying to find something that they could vindicate who Moses was but friend that'll never vindicate it you could always say it came from another age but this message that we hear today brother Wesley is the greatest Vindication that the Bible has ever had you say how can you say that because the message is the very thing that defends it you don't don't you realize this Bible has been in the hands of men for 2,000 years let me tell you what they done with it they divided one another they killed one another they destroyed what was written in it they used this Bible as an excuse for war they've used the word of God as an excuse for murder they've used it as an excuse for Bloodshed but when the spirit of the Lord fell upon a prophet of God brother Mark and anointed him to reveal the secrets of the hearts of God it Vindicated the very scriptures that you and I read today no longer is it just a good story no longer is it just a a bedtime story or children's literature no longer is it a dead letter but I say this morning that the Bible has came alive brother the market ain't just something that we read but it's came alive Hebrews 13 and8 it means something to me today cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever oh it's a very Vindication in Mark 16 that they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it proves what Apostle Paul said that the letter kth but the spirit of God giveth life it's God alive it's a very Vindication of the word of God let me tell you what it was you think about when Moses went to the burning bush what was the burning bush The Burning Bush was a Vindication of what God told Abraham he said of assur your your uh children will go into a Strange Land and they'll be they'll be bound for 400 years but then I will bring them out with a mighty hand now Abra or Moses stands before a burning bush and God shows him he's vindicating the very thing that he's that he told Abraham Moses wasn't there when God spoke to Abraham but Moses wrote about it how did he know you answer me he was a man just like you and I he had a wife and children how did he know God came and spoke to his prophet and he told him what happened in the beginning things that we wouldn't even understand the ways of God without a prophet of God but he spoke and then the Burning Bush brother Mark it Vindicated the very thing that God had told to Abraham watch can we just take it on down through the scripture watch when Joshua go goes to to to to to Jericho to the walls of Jericho whenever he met the captain of the host and he said are you for me or against me he said he said I am the I am the captain of the host he I I'm the I'm the one that that gave you the the right to be here let me tell you how you're going to overcome this battle brother Mark don't you realize that the very presence of the captain of a host was a Vindication of the burning bush Joshua wasn't at the burning bush but when he met God in the in as a the captain of the host it was a vindication to Joshua of what happened at the burning bush you see this carry on all the way through the Bible as they would go into the promised land and here God would raise up these great prophets like Isaiah and Malachi and they would they would they would do the very things of God but notice in the New Testament as we turn the page in the New Testament John the Baptist was a Vindication of what Malachi 3 said he said there's coming a one and he'll he'll come and he said he'll make way the or make U make the path straight for the way of the Lord he he'll prepare the way of the Lord and John the Baptist brother Mark when he stood on the banks of the river he was a Vindication of what Malachi said whenever Jesus was born in a manger he was a Vindication of what of what Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child friends and whenever the the children of God went into the upper room and the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room it was a Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ you can follow that same Elohim from The Book of Genesis all the way to the day that we live in today and the Very Holy Ghost is a vind ation of Jesus Christ let me tell you a secret friend I know the world today they don't want nothing to do with this kind of preaching they don't want nothing to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't like this Holy Ghost kind of preaching but let me tell you a secret the Holy Ghost is the only Vindication of Jesus Christ that they're ever that there ever was it's the very thing that proves that he's alive and well it's the very thing that he still heals the sick it's still it still raises the dead it still sets our path stay and it'll lead us and guide us into the Rapture by the Holy Ghost it's a Vindication listen it's a Vindication of the Resurrection now the people of God brother Mar now we can stand in the middle of a faithless generation and we can have faith we can have faith for healing because it's been Vindicated we can have faith for a Rapture because it's been Vindicated my friends I don't know how people do it how do they go through this world with no Vindication how how they go through the world with story with no Vindication friends I don't know about you but Vindication is what brings Faith it's the very thing that stir your heart when you see Vindicated it it's a foundation that you can stand on and be able to look the devil in the eye and say you have no right Vindicated by God we can stand brother Mark you think about what it took what did it take for Israel to come out of Egypt it took a word Prophet to come that God would reveal to and he would go to them and begin to call them out of this place Egypt now notice this name Elohim of the mark it ain't referring to multiple gods it's it's the attributes or the nature of God to see inside of him was the nature to be a father he was self-existent but there was nothing for him to be a father of inside of him was the nature to be a God but a god is an object of worship but there was nothing for him to be a God over inside of him was the nature of a Healer but there was no sick to be healed but it was still part of the nature of God but but after a while said see so there's nothing to worship him there's nothing to be healed nothing to be saved but here in him brother Mark think of it even the word Yahweh that we use the Lord it was part of the nature of God but there was no one to be Lord over it couldn't be Yahweh over anyone there was no one to be Lord over but it was still the attributes of God inside him see because he had these things and his attributes and his nature produced what there is today so the very desire think about God that created to feel the desire of being a savior and a Healer and a father and a god whenever God created us brother Mark he he created us to satisfy his own nature isn't this something that God want wanted a son so he made you he wanted daughters so he made you he was a Healer he would never be able to heal anyone if there wasn't sick but the sick came God healed him he's been able to display the very the attributes the the the greatness of all that God really is it would never be displayed if there wasn't no sick and if there wasn't no the trials and if there wasn't no problems and if there wasn't no if we didn't have all these things that we go through God would never be able to even display the greatness of who God is amen we look at it so much it's such a a negative and all the trial and problems and look at the nation and the everything falling apart but this is the way that God can display the greatness of who God is listen at Abraham the Bible says the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammory he sat in the door of the tent In The Heat Of The Day He lifted up his eyes and he looked and three men stood by him when he saw them he ran to meet him at the tent door and he bowed himself on the ground and he said my Lord if I have found favor in thy sight pass not away from thy servant amen man can you imagine Abraham brother Mark here was a man that knew God he knew him by Vision or dream or how that God had spoke to him when God come and called him out of his land of his home and called him into this Strange Land so God had he had interacted with him he had spoke to him in some way that God had dealt with his heart but he was a man that because he recognized God that whenever he came into the tent or to the tent that he act he immediately knew him by his presence isn't it something he may not seen that the face he may not but he knew him by his presence can you imagine what it was like for Abraham that day here he was out in the wilderness had his family and the servants that they had raised up and trained they they fought battles even with them and here he was sitting in the door of the tent In the Heat of the day but Mark out in the middle of that that Wilderness and that and that that great that great heat up there hund and something degrees and out there maybe him and Sarah sitting over by the tent and and long day is gone by and they're kind of watching how things are going looking over at at the little herd and everything that they had out there and brother Wesley and just pondering on the promises that God had made it had been many years since God had came and gave that promise to him but here as he said and they pondered on this things is you no doubt he's a human being and and just like us maybe we sit there and say you know what it's been a long time and it it kind of maybe you forget about him maybe go a few days and you forget about the things that God has told you or dealt with your heart on and and so as he would as he would think on these things all of a sudden the Bible says all of a sudden then these three men appeared unto him oh my can you imagine here he was thinking about God and he was he was thinking about the promise that he made and all a sudden there he stood I thought my is that is that can you imagine just sitting in your room or at home and think about the promises that God made you and he he promised me I'd be well and he promised uh I'd have a body change he promised we'd see our loved ones again and while you're sitting there and you're thinking on the Promises of God you you look out the door and there he stands on the front La this is what happened with Abraham he he was a man and as he stood there all of a sudden God was standing in his presence and the Bible said here Abraham he ran and he fell on the ground and he said my Lord he recognized Brother David he recognized the presence of God here he said my Lord in other words it was a man standing in his midst but it was a man that Abraham called God he he said my Lord he he he's the same one that he met when he came out of the slaughter of the Kings remember that day when he went down and he fought and he delivered lot out of the hands of those of those kings and and when he went down there on the way back from the battle here melaz didc the king of Salem the king of Peace the one that had no beginning of days and no ending of nights it wasn't just some priest that was some Earthly priest but it was God it was mecdc it was God In the Flesh of a man that met him there the Bible says that Abraham he paid a tenth part of his SPS to him in other words he paid tithes unto mecaz you see see it was the same Elohim it was the same God that he had met and now here he is brother Mark he's standing before him that's right he's standing before his tent door yeah and he's fellowshipping with him and he sits down and he has communion with him and as he's communion with him and the other angels that were with him they said well we got a work to do and they went down into Sodom but the Lord stayed with Abraham and he began to reveal the secrets of the hearts of God and as they go down the Angels you know the story they went down into into Sodom and and they went and they went and they found out the the condition of Sodom and they brought lot out of Sodom and then the Bible say says and after lot left out of Sodom immediately then fire and brimstone fell on the city and it destroyed the city now watch this this very picture come on now because Jesus he picks this story up in Luke 17th chapter 28th verse he says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drink they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of solom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all Jesus is refering referring to this time of Abraham and lot he said but even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now catch this what Jesus is speaking of as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days when the son of man is reveal you watch when the church world gets a hold of this scripture they the the the focus is on the the condition of of Sodom it's all when it's preached about you you watch preachers preach about it on on on on on YouTube a different different backgrounds but but but the the focus is on Sodom it's on the condition of Sodom and the condition of the world and how many knows that we're living in a Sodom condition hello somebody it's the the condition of the world but the focus is on they they ate and they drank and they bought and they sold and they build it and and after all Sodom we're certainly living in a sodomite condition but do you realize brother Mar that the great thing that happened in the days of lot it was not fire and brimstone in Sodom the great thing that happened in the days of lot it's not that they were building and drinking and eating and the great thing that happened in the days of not of lot it wasn't even lot it was Abraham here when Jesus said as it was in the days of lot here lies a secret in this story is that while all of this was going on Abraham was over by his T and the Bible says in the Lord was remaining with him and he was fellowshipping and having communion with the Lord God Elohim the very God Of Heaven the creator of Heaven and Earth and while judgment would come upon the very city of Sodom here he was with his Lord see there's the secret of of what's laying in that story says see notice what happened this great thing that happened before judgment even struck Elohim was standing at the tent of Abraham notice what can I can I just kind just take a minute and no notice what happened when he was standing there first what did he do he discerned the heart of Sarah he said your wife laughed why did Sarah laugh in the tent oh I didn't laugh well yes you laughed he knew he knew exactly what took place in her heart the second thing he did brother Mark is he turned to Abra Abraham and he said why would I keep secrets from Abraham cuz he's going to be he's going to be of a great nation he he's going to be the inheritor of the earth his seed why would I keep a secret from him so then he turns and he begins to reveal the secrets of the heart of God to a man named Abraham and then brother Mark he would tell him how judgment is about to strike he are you catching me somebody he says then he starts telling him how judgment is about to strike he tells him the condition of Sodom then he says I'm want to make sure that the angels are doing what they're supposed to do down there because judgment is on that land but you notice oh my notice how Abraham responds to it but the mark the Bible says Abraham says Lord but if there be 50 over there would you spare the city see what it was Abraham being a top of the Bride of Jesus Christ because we're the Seed of Abraham but Mark he immediately cried out for Mercy he said God have mercy on him if there's 50 would you spare them if there's 40 would you spare them if there's 30 would you spare if there's 20 if there's 10 Lord would you spare the city it was the response is't that a perfect type of today it's a perfect type of the Bride of Jesus Christ under the ministry of the son of man watch this son of man Ministry Jesus said this is the way it shall be uh when the son of man is revealed the ministry of the son of man the first thing you saw was the discernment of somebody's heart here he would come and begin to discern the heart of the woman and discern the hearts of people but then he would reveal to the Seed of Abraham The Secret of God's heart the very thing that happened at the tent of Abraham is the same thing that we've experienced today reveal the secret of God's heart he as he you said well who is the who is the Seed of Abraham it's you and me this is what Paul said he said your HS according to the promise if you be Christ you are Abraham's seed and your HS according to the promise so just like it was in the days of lot there was a lot there was a Sodom there was wickedness there was a wicked City but then there was also an Abraham today there's still Sodom there's still a condition of Sodom but there's the Seed of Abraham and the son of man that stood there before Abraham and begin to reveal the secrets of the heart of God is the same son of man that came today and revealed the very secrets of God's heart to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why think about it that's why he would come and have communion with us brother Mark that's why this this gift of Elohim that would operate under the ministry of the son of man brother Wesley this gift of elem would preach the messages of future home and the revelation of the Seven Seals and the Rapture message you say what was he doing he was revealing the secrets of the hearts of God you think about the world how they would talk about it this whole church world my my wife was raised up in a in a in a church of Christ mixed up Baptist background and and and you know the the way that they believed Heaven it was just you know she used to tell me how the how the the ways they believed things and how people's going to be angels and we're going to get wings and we're and we're going to float off in some Cloud somewhere but here when the son of man Ministry would come he would take that very thing that mindset of people that they they couldn't even find in the word and reveal the heart of God and say but that's not the way it's going to be we're not going to be floating on some Cloud somewhere where you where you float through one another he said but you'll be in this same this this the the the way that God Made You you were made in that very image you'll be an 18 or 20 year old boy in the very Prime of your life that's the theophany body that God has given you and you'll walk up to your brother and you'll be able to shake his hand and you'll have a place to have to dwell in and have communion with it'll be an eternal day and there'll never be a n there won't be a devil to be able to torment you that ain't the way it's going to be they talk about judgment and how that you're all going to go through judgment have everybody scared to death you're going to go through this this great judgment and Friends some people ought to be scared but to the Bride of Jesus Christ he said but that ain't the way it's going to be you ain't going to be judged over there you're judged over here by believing the word of God that's our judgment that's the Judgment that God gives you would you accept the very message that God has sent in the end time the ministry of the son of man see it would show the way it's going to be he said listen as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the time when the son of man is revealed watch the son of man was revealed to Abraham's group as a man he was a prophet in the form of human flesh an ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him Elohim he came to him as a man but he said Elohim say See Jesus promises in the last days the son of man will be revealed again the same type to the same type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls but remember the church never received any more witness listen to this Abraham and them didn't the promised son they were looking for was brought right after that here they were waiting on this son to be born so the Lord would come and he would spend time with him he would promise that you're going to see your promised son he destroyed here come the Judgment it destroyed the city then the very next thing that they saw was the the the promised son he says see that's way the way it is today the the church is looking for the promised son amen we're looking for the promised son which is Jesus he'll come right after the days of this ministry of the son of man he'll be revealed from the heavens he said see it's too plain it's got to be that way don't you see where we are there didn't come said there ain't coming another witness after the ministry of the son of man it's the last witness that the Earth will ever see but after this son of man Ministry then would follow you would see the very promised son you see so that's where that's where we are brother Mark immediately after you my friends that ought to wake everybody up when the son of man Ministry was gone the very next thing was to see the promised son don't you realize it we're living in that day we're we we may not get through this service we may not go through another day tomorrow we're living in the age of the promised son said don't you see where we are here the world is in a Sodom condition here we are the seat of Abraham we're looking for the promise son we've heard the ministry of the son of man the only thing left is fire and brimstone think about it but notice as Moses brother Mark he continues I got just a few more minutes I got glory to God Moses continues with this inspiration of Elohim and as he writes of Elohim you'll find as he goes through the scripture he begins to take I think this is so good he starts to take the very attributes of God and he would add the name of God with his attributes and so when you'd continue to read through the words of Moses he'd go down into Genesis the 14th chapter whenever MDC would come he'd say MDC he would call him L Elon L being Elohim Elon in other words he was the priest of the most high God what did they call Jesus the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Genesis the 21st chapter he calls he calls him LM o l a m which was an everlasting God this came after after Abraham had dug the well at beerseba brother Mark remember the well the very the place that that that Hagar and and and Ishmael was out that day and they' ran out of water and they had they had nothing to drink and so the they begin to cry out unto the Lord they drank the last bit of water that they had and they cried to the Lord and the Bible says but the Lord heard the Cry of the lad and he came down to Hagar and he opened her eyes and in the middle of a Wilderness in the middle of a desert he opened up a well to her that she could have water he said see what was it it was the same Jesus Christ and when he stood in the temple that day he said If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink here when they were lost here when they were in a Wilderness here when they were thirsting for Life Jesus would stand by right beside him brother Mark and he would open their eyes he would call them out by name and said if a man is thirsty I'm The Well of life he was The Well of BBA as it was to Hagar and this place of beerseba it was called the Bible said upon it was called the name of the Lord Elam an everlasting God oh my a't that something he was an everlasting God brother Joe you know what that mean he's an Eternal God he's a constant God he he's a God that outlasts our trials he's a God that outlasts our problem he whenever you feel like you can't last another day but our God is an everlasting God when you feel like giving up and quitting and throwing in the towel but our God is an everlasting God he'll out Outlast every backsliding condition that we go through he'll Outlast all of our unbelief he'll Outlast all of our criticism and he'll still be there why he's an everlasting God you may turn your back on him but he'll Outlast it you may run from him but he'll Outlast you you say Lord I'm going to run from the presence of God but you'll never run too far that God can't find you cuz he's a God that can Outlast he don't matter how far you go he'll Outlast you cuz he's an everlasting God the Bible says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life they're following after you why he's an everlasting God now you can run all you want to but God will find you if you belong to God he'll get a hold of you it don't matter how far you go why he's Everlasting you're going to run out after a little while but my God won't it you're going to feel you're going to feel down but my God won't you're going to feel like giving up but God won't you're going to feel like empty but God don't he's an everlasting God God I can't go another day but he's Everlasting he's lolm an everlasting God he he would go the mark he would follow after us think about it when he pursues you I love this people look at God the wrong way when God pursues after you he's not pursuing after you to kill and to steal and destroy that's what the devil does he said but when he pursues after you he pursues after you to give you life ain't that something to see God pursuing after you saying but I've got life for you I don't I don't know about this God but I've got life for you I I don't know if I can live this kind but I got life for you I I think I'm just going to give up but I've got life for you I don't think I can make it another day but I've got life for you God pursuing after you to give you eternal life that's what kind of God we serve he's an everlasting God he outlasts all our doubt and all of our fears he's coming that even maybe sometimes he will find us he'll find us in our weakest State that's where God founds most of us in our weakest State when there ain't nowhere else to turn to but that everlasting God walks into the room Jared you said what do you do in your weakest day he allows you to draw strength you said well where can I draw strength from well let Moses tell you he said Abram was 99 years old when the Lord appeared to him and he he said I am almighty God El Shad I'm An Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect the very name of God elshad say see what it meant he said the because Shad he said it was speaking of the of a breast just like a a mother would feed her child yes he said I am elhad the the the breasted God the place to be able to draw strength that he would be able to nurse here as we come to the Lord and as children that it would be the place to be able to draw strength so here God even in your weakest condition brother M he would give you a place to be able to nurse you to strength you see most people they come well I can't walk well no you can't walk but you'll be able to nurse I I I'm so sick I can't go another day but God give us something to nurse from to be able to to nurse our strength back brother Mark our healing that we could we can nurse our healing our Salvation God has given us a place to draw every promise that God gave us that we got a place to draw the promise of God from on think about it when God gives you a word you may you may you may come up for healing and you go back and you're sicker than you was the first day but keep drawing from the promise you may not you may go back and you say well I don't guess I got healed I feel the same way I did yesterday I feel worse than I did yesterday they keep drawing from the promise he said see notice if you'll keep drawing from it your strength will begin to renew your the arms straighten up the the eyes begin to brighten up the the heart begins to beat normal why because we're drawing from a breasted God the god that has the ability to give you strength it was God's promise that he gave to the Seed of Abraham brother Mark and we are the children of Abraham and we got a right to draw from the promise of God that's thus sayth the Lord we got to write the draw from the promise of God cuz you're the Seed of Abraham it don't matter how you feel I want somebody say it this morning I'm still drawing you may feel like giving up but say I'm still drawing I may be sick in my body I'm still drawing I may feel like I can't go another day I'm still drawing why because God has given me a place to draw from so we stagger not at the promise of God but we draw strength we build we by faith brother Mark we draw we give glory to God and we still draw said he's the same elhad ey tonight he changes not his Covenant people have the same privilege to draw from that same resource that Abraham had to draw from CU he swore by the same Covenant that he would give us the promise Lord you said well how do you draw from him let me tell you said he's El shadia he's still the rested God in the New Testament and the the Old Testament yes to see so if you want to draw from God draw your strength from it everything you have need of see that's the only way a Believer can get his strength is to pull it from the word of God that's where our strength comes from you won't you won't get it from a seminary somewhere you're not going to get it from from some Feelgood message or something but the only way that you'll ever get strength is to pull it from the word of God that's the very strength of God brother Mah that he promised to the Believers and if you want strength pull it from the word We Stand by it we believe it brother Mark we pull from the word of God we have knees this morning you say how do I get my knees met pull it from the word of God when a man of God would come to preach the word don't you realize had somebody told me the other day he said every word you preach it feels like you just somebody had told him that you just just feels like you just talk right to me and then another sister told me same thing another brother told me the same thing I said isn't it something that every time you come to a house of God how many people ever feel that way I feel like you're just speaking to me is it something that you can set there and talk to 40 different or or 150 different people and they all have different problems and different things that they're facing and you can speak to every one of them because it isn't a man it's the very word of God and when the word of God is preached the word of God finds the places that people have need of the Bible says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of your heart it it finds our weaknesses it finds what the places that we need correction and you feel like why are they just why I feel like he just talking to me but it ain't the men that are preaching it's the word of God that's being preached see he knows what we have need of but Mark we draw from it say well what I need pull it out of the word you come to the house of God you pull you can you you never seen God move until you see a people pull you can see the greatest gift of Prophecy you ever saw and it would never be operated without a people that would pull from a gift of God but when a people pull God speaks he deals with your heart you have needs from God friends don't you wor don't you can't just come to the house of God say well I'm going to sit here and let God fix all my problems pull from the word I'm I'm let God he's going to fix my marriage trouble pull from the word I'm going to let God fix my finances pull from the word I'm going to let God fix my sickness pull from the word of God what you have need of we'll draw it right out of the word is that what the Bible says faith cometh by hearing the word see we pull it from the word it builds our faith the faith to be able to receive the very promises that God gave to him that's the Bible amen watch what Moses I'm going to close as Moses would write but Mark he would sit there and he would start to write about the things of God and what belonged to God yes I love this part because when he would write about Abraham and then Abraham and and Isaac and then here Isaac would have Jacob and Esau he would write the story as you would read about the story of Jacob and you notice how that this Hebrew name L that was that was Elohim yeah it was used in many names to express that they were the children of God you watch how Jacob whenever Jacob would come come out here Jacob was was a man the Bible the name Jacob meant supplanter he was a in other words he was he was a a man he that that would supplanter means to supersede by another Force remember he stole the birthright so here he would many would say he was a Sher he was a he was a deceiver it was it means treachery he his name meant all sorts of of of not good things but Jacob for the mark but he come one day in contact with a man name Elohim and when he came in contact with you the Bible says he wrestled with him here Jacob as he wrestled with the Lord and he was trying to to get what he needed from God oh brother Travis he was he was pulling and he was drawing all night the Bible says he wrestled with the Lord and as he left the presence of the Lord that God touched him and he he made a mark in his thigh remember or in his hip and he he made a Mark that he would that it would affect him all the days of his life but notice what God did I thought it was so good is that God he said no longer will I call you Jacob but now I'm going to call you isra L God took a man and he put his name in his isn't it something the name Israel it don't it it means Elohim perseveres here was a man Jacob that that wrestled with the Lord all night and then God would put his name on him he said Elohim the very nation of Israel was named after God the same Elohim that Moses wrote about the very nation was named after him my brother Mark he say see God put his name on I don't know about y'all that about makes me want to shout out over this building that think that he would that God would put his name on him and don't you realize that because he had the name of God on him that's what the brought the blessing upon his life see because where the name of God is then the blessing of God is you can read that in numbers the 6th chapter he said see the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak to Aaron and his sons saying on this wise shall you bless the children of Israel say the Lord has blessed thee and kept Thee the Lord makes his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you the Lord will lift his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them so the very place where the name of God is is where the blessing of God is oh friends don't you realize that God would name them and then he would bring the blessing upon them the very blessing that was in the name of God I know this may be boring to some of you but the blessing that was in the name won't you stand to your feet this morning the name that was in him he gave to he gave to him so the blessing of God could be on him now watch this name he didn't stop there watch the prophets of God that would come the first the the major prophet come by the name of Elijah Elijah it was the very name of God that was put in Elijah's name the next one was Elisha Elisha the name of God was put in Elisha's name matter of fact if you read Elijah Elijah means Elohim is Lord Elisha means Elohim Elisha means Elohim is my salvation so here the prophets of God would have the very name of God it's no wonder that Elijah stopped the rain the blessing of God was on his life it's no wonder that that he raised a dead boy to life because God's name was on him it's no wonder brother Mar that he parted the Waters of the Jordan cuz God's name was on him it's no wonder that that he that he multiplied the oil because God's name was on him and then it's no wonder that he ascended into heaven cuz God's name was on him but notice what happened a double portion of what Elijah had fell back on who on Elisha the very same name that was named on Elijah was named on Elisha it was the same God that was the god of Elijah was the god of Elijah and brother said see he got a double portion and the same Miracles that was done in Elijah was done in Elisha he said and Elijah was a type of Christ and Elisha was a type of the church Church oh friends don't you realize that's the same thing that God done for us the very think of it the name of God that was on him was on her that's what happened when Jesus if Elijah was the type of Christ what happened when Jesus resurrected he ascended what did Elijah do he ascended Jesus he ascended but notice after his resurrection when he ascended the Bible says when they went into the upper room that day 120 and they were in one mind and one Accord then all of a sudden little licks of fire fell on all of them what was it it was the same spirit of God that that was that was in the man Jesus Christ Elohim that same Elohim the life of God fell upon the Believers and they were filled with the same spirit that Jesus had when he was walking on the earth just like Elisha had a double portion of what Elijah had now this church the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Wesley she's got the double portion of what he had he said see whenever he went on Easter Sunday he sent the holy SP Spirit back upon the church with a double portion of it that we might do the same things that he did for the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe friends don't you realize you can put whatever name on the door if you want to the nominations they'll put the name you can put the name of Christ on the door this is the this is Christ Church this is the Church of Christ this all these things you can do that all you want to you can make a religion and you can call it God you can put God on your shirt you can put God on your Facebook page you can you can put the name of God anywhere but it'll never do you no good good said see Christ's name on the building they can call it what they want but it doesn't make it so just because you put it there he said but when God puts his name in something that's what does it see God put his name in Elijah God put his name in Jacob God put his name in Elisha God put his name in Jesus and God put his name on you you see as Elijah was to Elisha so was Christ to the church there's a fine people here there's fine churches in the world but there's only one one misses Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for because that's where his name lays that's where his worship is oh friends think about it this morning the name that God put on you for the West see the Bible said there's no greater name on heaven and no greater name on Earth and God put that name on you hello somebody catch it this morning it's the greatest name that was ever written and that's the name he chose to call you by Mrs Jesus Christ all the family in the Earth in heaven is named Jesus and all the family on Earth is named Jesus the greatest name that there ever was and he put it on you that's the name that God chose and notice where he put it in Jesus God's chosen name that's his place of worship is in one man it's Jesus Christ it's not in an organization it's not in some other man it's not in following after something else there ain't but one place that God's worship it's in the man Jesus Christ he's the name of above all names brother Mark and he put his name on you a't that something the greatest name there ever was and he put his name on me that's why you have an authority over the devil this morning amen the greatest name that there ever was that you can stand in the face of the enemy say but God put his name on me do you realize that my wife can go down to the bank don't give her any ideas but you realize she could go down to the bank and she could withdraw whatever sum of money she wanted to withdraw you may go down there and try it say I want to draw from Matt Mor's account but Mark you know what they' tell you sorry you can't do it maybe some well you don't understand I'm his brother you can't do it well I I I've got a I got a note from him here says I can it's going to take more than that you can't do it but but my wife goes down there even if they don't know her it could be at a different branch say I need to withdraw well who are you well I'm I'm Sarah moris I'm his wife you realiz I that the same funds that I deposited in that bank that she has access to Glory she has access it don't matter what's in there she's got access to it because she's my wife said well how how how does she have to get it all she had to do said well I I I don't know who you are she go down the courthouse and she can get a what's called a marriage certificate she can go down that marriage certificate and lay it down at the bank and say here is the proof that I'm the the wife of that man and she could ACC access everything that she had need of see that's the way it is the Lord my funds would run out but he's an everlasting God he'll never run out and here we are as the Bride of Jesus Christ it's our spiritual union that you've made with him as the Bride of Jesus Christ as a body of believer of Believers brother Mark individuals were're Sons and Daughters of God but as a body with the bride of Christ and we have right to go to the bank of Heaven as the bride of Christ and everything that he has deposited every promise that he has made we've got a right to withdraw from it why because he put his name on me you don't realize devil says well you can't have it me no Banker you can't have it said well you may not want to give it to me but let me tell you there's some witnesses that were down there that day let me pull up a witness he was called the Holy Ghost let me pull up a witness that was there that day whenever he put his name on me when I when I went down to the Altar and I gave my heart to the Lord and he filled me with a spirit of God the Bible said as a
