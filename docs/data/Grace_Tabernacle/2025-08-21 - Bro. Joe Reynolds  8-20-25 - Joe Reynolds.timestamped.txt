[11:46] times harder, and it looked like hope
[11:49] was gone. But in the midst of the flame,

[24:37] the Holy Ghost, it'll set your soul on
[24:39] fire."

[24:42] everything about you. He said, "Because
[24:43] God loves to go to church, and God loves
[24:46] to worship." So if you got God on the
[24:48] inside of you, there's something in you
[24:49] that can't keep you out of the house of
[24:50] God. And because God's in your heart,

[30:59] certainly, you know, some things seem
[31:01] impossible.
[31:03] And without God, they are. Some things
[31:05] you don't have an answer to. You
[31:07] wouldn't have a a direction, have no
[31:09] advice or anything to give. But without
[31:12] the hand of God, it's an impossible
[31:14] situation. But I believe that God is a
[31:16] God of the impossible. Amen. And I know
[31:19] that you say, "Well, brother Matt,
[31:20] what's that mean?" You know, sometimes
[31:22] we just have to let God do what God
[31:24] does. And sometimes that don't feel good
[31:27] to us because you can't you leave your
[31:29] own emotions in it and your own
[31:30] feelings. And you just have to let all
[31:33] that go aside and let God do what God
[31:35] does. And I think the worst mistakes
[31:37] I've ever been in in my life is trying
[31:39] to fix things myself and got in the way
[31:41] of God or or ahead of God and trying to
[31:44] uh force things to happen a certain way
[31:46] and it's such a a dangerous place to be
[31:49] in and you know it just causes a lot of
[31:52] uh trouble and anxiety in your spirit
[31:55] and but we can just when we can just uh
[31:58] be still and let God fight our ba
[32:00] battles and you know the Bible says they
[32:02] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[32:04] their strength.
[32:05] Amen. Fighting and it just takes you
[32:07] down to where you have nothing left. But
[32:09] when we can just wait on God, I believe
[32:11] our strength will be renewed. And not
[32:13] only that, but I believe our joy will be
[32:15] renewed. Our our our our uh revival, our
[32:19] our hope, everything is renewed when we
[32:21] can just allow God to come in and
[32:24] intervene. And so, I just believe that
[32:25] God is able to do that tonight. I also
[32:28] want to remember sister Lily and I went
[32:30] by and visited her and her family today
[32:32] and uh and just asked the Lord to touch
[32:35] her body and uh she's not able to get
[32:37] around and so we just believe that God
[32:39] is a is a supernatural God. Uh he's able
[32:42] to do things that we don't have the
[32:44] ability to do. And so we just want to
[32:46] rely on him. And maybe just ask you
[32:48] tonight and maybe somebody has something
[32:49] on their heart that you just like to put
[32:51] before the Lord. And you say, "Brother
[32:53] Matt, I you know, I've been trying to
[32:55] fix this or that, but maybe tonight if
[32:57] you just lift your hand to the Lord and
[32:58] just say, Lord, I just want to give it
[33:00] to you and just relax in your presence
[33:02] and in your word tonight and just allow
[33:04] you uh to come in and intercede on my
[33:07] behalf." Let's just bow our heads
[33:08] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[33:11] Lord, we are so privileged, Lord, to
[33:13] know you. And Lord, to know how that we
[33:16] are your children, Lord. And so many
[33:18] times in the Bible, Lord, we read about
[33:20] and we're reminded that we are not
[33:23] forsaken. We're not forgotten. And Lord,
[33:26] it doesn't matter how hopeless the
[33:28] things that we face, Lord, are. And
[33:31] sometimes, Lord, that just don't seem to
[33:33] be an answer, Lord. And we just try in
[33:35] our own flesh, in our own mind, Lord.
[33:37] And but God, we just believe that you're
[33:39] more than able tonight, Lord. And I know
[33:41] that when we don't have an answer and
[33:43] Lord, we don't have anywhere to turn,
[33:45] Lord. You told us in your word that we
[33:47] could call upon you in a time of
[33:49] trouble, Lord. And you would hear our
[33:51] prayer and you would help. And Lord, we
[33:53] just ask you tonight, Lord. I know many
[33:55] trials, Lord, many great needs here
[33:57] tonight, Lord. And Lord, I just ask you
[33:59] tonight, Lord, that you would intervene.
[34:02] Lord, I pray, Lord, that you would come
[34:03] among your children, Lord. Let your
[34:05] spirit be able to minister to every
[34:07] heart. And Lord, I pray that every need
[34:10] would be met. Lord, I'm that kind of
[34:12] believer. Lord, I don't just come
[34:13] believing that you might just show up
[34:15] and help one person or help uh somebody
[34:18] maybe a far off, but Lord, I believe
[34:19] that you're that kind of a God, Lord,
[34:21] that can come in this building tonight.
[34:23] Lord, that you could help every
[34:25] situation. Lord, you could further us in
[34:27] your word. Lord, you can take things
[34:28] that seem completely hopeless, hopeless,
[34:31] and Lord, in just a few moments, you can
[34:33] turn all of it around. And Lord, we just
[34:35] ask you, Lord, that by your spirit,
[34:37] Lord, that we could just relax in your
[34:39] presence, Lord, and allow you to have
[34:41] your way in this church service tonight.
[34:43] And Lord, may we leave this place
[34:45] knowing that you've been in our midst,
[34:46] Lord. And we'll give you the glory for
[34:48] all that you do. We ask these things in
[34:51] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[34:55] Amen. How many believe that tonight?
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I certainly believe that God is
[35:00] more than able. Can we sing uh the
[35:02] goodness of God? Amen. We're just
[35:04] looking forward to what brother Joe
[35:08] coming tonight and just ask the Lord to
[35:10] have his way in the service. Amen. I
[35:13] love you, Lord,
[35:17] for your mercy never fails me.
[35:21] And all my days I've been held in your
[35:26] hands.
[35:28] From the moment that I wake up till I
[35:32] lay my head,
[35:36] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[35:41] [Music]
[35:44] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[35:51] And all my life you have been so so
[35:55] good.
[35:57] With every breath that I am able,
[36:02] well, I will sing of the goodness of
[36:07] God.
[36:08] [Music]
[36:10] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[36:16] I love your voice.
[36:20] You have led me through the fire
[36:24] in the darkest night.
[36:27] You're close like no other.
[36:31] I've known you as a father,
[36:34] known you as a friend.
[36:37] I have lived in the goodness of God. How
[36:42] many can testify about that tonight? For
[36:44] I know all my life you have been
[36:48] faithful.
[36:52] And all my life you have been so so
[36:56] good.
[36:58] With every breath that I am aable,
[37:03] I feel
[37:08] [Music]
[37:11] of the goodness of God.
[37:15] [Music]
[37:24] All my life you have been so so good.
[37:30] Every breath that I am able.
[37:35] Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[37:42] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[37:49] Oh, don't you love him? this evening.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly,
[37:54] he's been a good father.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; He's been an everpresent help in a time
[37:59] of trouble.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; He's never one time forsaken me. I've
[38:03] let him down many times, but he's never
[38:06] let me down one time.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't that want you make you want to
[38:10] praise the Lord tonight? Amen. Men can
[38:13] fail you, but God can never fail you.
[38:15] Amen. And if we could just look past
[38:17] individualities
[38:18] and people's personalities and realize
[38:21] there's a mighty God that's felt before
[38:23] us and look around, you're it.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love him? Won't
[38:28] you give the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[38:32] Little course been on my heart just
[38:34] today. It's early. Well, while I was
[38:37] praying,
[38:39] somebody touch me. While I was praying,
[38:44] somebody touch me. Well, while I was
[38:47] praying,
[38:49] somebody touch me. Well, it must have
[38:52] been the hand of the Lord.
[38:56] Well, while I was shouting,
[39:01] while I was shouting,
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Well, while I was shouting,
[39:11] well, it must have been the hand of the
[39:13] Lord. Have you felt the hand of the
[39:15] Lord? Well, while I was praying
[39:19] again.

[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. Won't we just
[40:45] bow our hearts for a moment of prayer?
[40:47] And if you have a need upon your heart,
[40:49] won't you make it known to the Lord? I
[40:51] know he's more than able to meet each
[40:52] and every one of our needs this evening.
[40:55] Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for such
[40:58] a time as this. Father, we come and
[41:00] worship you in spirit and truth. Father,
[41:02] we come to magnify your name, Lord.
[41:06] Lord God, what a what an atmosphere,
[41:08] Lord God, as believers come together and
[41:11] join their licks of fire together, Lord,
[41:14] to hear from heaven, hear from home,
[41:16] Lord. We've we've been out in the world,
[41:18] Lord, working and shopping and Lord God,
[41:23] embracing humanity, Lord God. And it
[41:27] such darkness in this age, as the
[41:29] prophet of God said, the lid has been
[41:31] pulled off of hell. There's thousands
[41:34] upon thousands of demons that's been
[41:36] released out of the river Euphrates,
[41:38] Lord. But here we are tonight gathering
[41:40] together in Grace Tabernacle, Lord, one
[41:42] more time, Lord, to worship you tonight.
[41:45] give you honor, give you praise, give
[41:46] you glory, Lord. Lord, let's open the
[41:49] windows of heaven, Lord, and pour out
[41:51] among us, Lord, this evening exactly
[41:54] what our heart has desire of, Lord God.
[41:57] We commit this time into your hands,
[41:59] Lord. We pray that you'll anoint us
[42:01] aresh, Lord, that you'd just intercede
[42:05] in every situation here tonight. every
[42:07] every heart that's burdened down with
[42:10] the pressures of life. Lord, I pray that
[42:12] you'd be a burden bearer tonight unto
[42:14] them. Lord, through the ministering of
[42:16] the word, Lord, I pray that you to heal
[42:18] the sick and afflicted. Lord, encourage
[42:21] those that may be down. Lord, we're
[42:23] looking forward to having a good time in
[42:25] the word tonight. Lord God, as we commit
[42:27] this time into your hands in the name of
[42:30] the Lord Jesus Christ, and the bride
[42:33] says,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. If you got your
[42:35] Bibles, I invite you to Ephesians
[42:37] chapter 6. It's good to be in the house
[42:39] of the Lord tonight. And
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just feel like the the Lord's been
[42:44] richly moving among us. And
[42:47] &gt;&gt; wow, I just uh would say tonight, I
[42:51] think we've got some of the cream of the
[42:53] crop and
[42:54] &gt;&gt; man, baptisms and my just rededications
[43:00] and
[43:01] &gt;&gt; new saints coming to the Lord. I say the
[43:03] move is on.
[43:05] I say we uh I believe the message of an
[43:07] hour has produced some of the best men
[43:09] of God to preach the gospel.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful to have a few here
[43:14] at the Grace Tabernacle and
[43:16] &gt;&gt; gives their life to to preach the
[43:18] gospel, give their life to hear, to
[43:20] labor among us and it's good to to to
[43:24] rub shoulders with people that love
[43:26] Jesus Christ and is not looking for fame
[43:29] or fortune, but looking to push the
[43:31] battle and push somebody to closer to
[43:34] heaven. That's what it's all about. And
[43:35] I think uh this world is trying to pull
[43:38] us down, but as brother Mark says, I'm
[43:40] going to rise rise above it all. I I
[43:43] just feel like the move is on in our
[43:45] hearts. Even if we have bad days, I
[43:48] believe the move is still on. It never
[43:50] hinders what the Lord Jesus is doing
[43:53] among us.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may fall short. We might miss
[43:57] the mark sometimes, but Jesus Christ
[43:59] never misses the mark.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; He's got everything under control. if we
[44:05] would just put our trust in him tonight.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about financial problems.
[44:10] Don't worry about church problems. Don't
[44:12] worry about family issues. Just put our
[44:14] trust in God. Cuz we're trusting a God
[44:17] that never fails. He's never late. He's
[44:19] always on time. He's got everything
[44:21] under control. Nothing happens. It's the
[44:23] intelligence of Almighty God. He knows
[44:26] every time a flea bats his eyes.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who would be at church
[44:30] service tonight. He knew exactly what
[44:33] songs would sing. We're talking about a
[44:34] mighty God tonight that's got everything
[44:37] under control.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. Ephesians
[44:42] chapter 6:10
[44:45] says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong
[44:47] in the Lord and the power of his might,
[44:51] &gt;&gt; his ability.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Put on the whole armor of God that you
[44:55] may be able to stand against the ws of
[44:58] the devil." It's coming.
[45:00] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:02] blood, but against principalities,
[45:04] against powers, against rulers of
[45:06] darkness of this world, against
[45:09] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[45:12] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[45:14] of God, that you may be able to
[45:16] withstand in the evil day, and having
[45:19] done all to stand. He says, "Stand
[45:21] therefore having your loins gird about
[45:24] with truth and having it on the
[45:26] breastplate of righteousness as a
[45:29] defense, putting on the breastplate of
[45:31] righteousness, your feet with the
[45:33] preparation of the gospel of peace.
[45:35] Above all, take the shield of faith,
[45:38] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[45:40] all the fiery darks of the wicked, and
[45:43] take the helmet of salvation, and the
[45:47] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[45:51] of God. Amen. God bless you. You can
[45:53] have your seats tonight.
[46:01] We realize
[46:03] it's an age of such confusion. It's an
[46:06] age of such darkness. And we realize, as
[46:10] I said in our prayer, that the lid of
[46:13] hell's been opened up. And all the
[46:16] demons out of the river Euphrates has
[46:19] been released in our day and age against
[46:22] the believers and the the church of the
[46:25] living God. And we know our nation's
[46:27] treaties. There's peace. There's rumors
[46:29] of wars. And there's a great shakening.
[46:32] Brother man would tell us there's a
[46:34] great shakening. The UN is shaken.
[46:37] Everything is shaken. The Bible said it
[46:39] would be like that. He said everything
[46:41] that could be shook would be shook. But
[46:44] we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[46:47] shook.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Everything is shaking. Are you hearing
[46:51] me tonight? Everything around us,
[46:53] brother Morgan. Amen. You're you might
[46:55] think that you got the best job and you
[46:58] got financial security. You can wake up
[47:00] in the morning, your bank account can be
[47:02] empty, your house could be gone, your
[47:05] vehicles could be gone. Amen. Just in a
[47:08] moment of time, everything can stop in
[47:10] this world. Amen. And I believe that's
[47:12] what brother Brown was trying to explain
[47:14] to us here. The world is falling apart.
[47:17] There's no there's no continuing city
[47:21] here. Amen. there. There's no security
[47:24] here. There's no refuge here. You can
[47:27] may feel good under a good banking
[47:29] account. I know it feels good to be
[47:31] financial stable. Amen. Where you're not
[47:34] wondering where your next meal's coming
[47:36] from. Amen. But that's all natural. And
[47:38] that's here today and gone tomorrow.
[47:41] Amen. It's all shaken. Amen. I don't
[47:44] care how much you believe that
[47:45] everything's going to be all right in
[47:47] this life in the natural. Amen. Your
[47:49] tomorrow can be all broken up. Your
[47:52] tomorrow could be broken into a shambles
[47:55] and depression or nervousness or amen.
[47:57] It's just the neotic age that we're
[47:59] living in. Amen. Darkness has such grip
[48:03] the age that we're living in. He said
[48:06] everything could be shocking but we got
[48:08] a kingdom that cannot be shook.
[48:11] Everything is s uncertain. The seasons
[48:13] are uncertain. This world is falling
[48:16] apart. He said, "But there's anything
[48:19] that is certain."
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yes." Hallelujah. He says,
[48:24] "There's something that's positive." He
[48:27] said, Jesus said, "Both heavens and
[48:29] earth will pass away, but my word shall
[48:32] never." There's something that is
[48:35] certain. Heavens are will pass away, but
[48:38] my word shall never pass away. He said
[48:41] that is what is certain. The Bible don't
[48:45] give an uncertain sound. It identifies
[48:48] the characteristics of our God and its
[48:51] sounding or its revealing.
[48:56] And as we read Ephesians, he said,
[48:57] "Finally, my brother, be strong in the
[49:00] Lord
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and in the power of not your ability or
[49:05] brother Matt's ability, our church, our
[49:07] religion,
[49:08] &gt;&gt; but he said, but in the power of his
[49:12] might or his ability,
[49:15] &gt;&gt; put on the whole armor of God
[49:18] &gt;&gt; that you'll be able to stand against the
[49:20] ws of the enemy." Come on.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, for the man is saying,
[49:24] "Amen." He was stating here in a vision,
[49:27] the enemy's coming in like a flood.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's going to be a day of great
[49:32] darkness. There's going to be a day of
[49:34] great gloom and doom.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "But put on the armor of God
[49:39] that you may be able to stand.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[49:44] against principalities." In other words,
[49:46] wrestle against hell and all of his
[49:49] demons.
[49:50] Wherefore take on the whole armor of God
[49:54] that you may be able to withstand.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And then he said, having on the
[49:59] breastplate,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; of righteousness.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't believe we're a bunch of
[50:04] cowards tonight. I don't believe we're
[50:06] just a a wishywashy believers tonight.
[50:11] Amen. Coming to church and fulfill a
[50:13] duty or ritual. Amen. We're not a bunch
[50:15] of cowards. If you'll notice here, Amen.
[50:18] There's no uh defense on the back of a
[50:21] believer. Amen. Because our commission
[50:23] is to speak and move forward.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on the breastplate. He said
[50:30] take on the shield of faith that you'll
[50:32] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[50:35] the wicked. Amen. Put on a shield. Put
[50:38] on some defense shield. Put on a helmet.
[50:42] Something to protect you.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Something that could be your defense.
[50:46] He's telling you there going to be
[50:48] punches. There's going to be fiery
[50:50] darts. There's going to be a Every gun
[50:54] of hell is pointing at a believer. And
[50:58] matter of fact, it's shooting at every
[51:00] one of us tonight. When you get up in
[51:02] the morning, hell never rest. Hell never
[51:05] sleeps. Hell is out to torment you, hunt
[51:08] at your windows, peck at your door, been
[51:11] run you, chase you, trying to break you
[51:14] down, Brother David. But he's telling us
[51:17] here, put on the breastplate. Put on the
[51:20] helmet. Put on put on the shield of
[51:23] faith.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And
[51:28] he said the sword of the spirit.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; The only part of this is actually
[51:36] offense.
[51:37] Offense is take the sword of God. Take
[51:44] the sword of the spirit which is the
[51:47] word of God. The word there comes from
[51:51] remma. It's an utterance. It's a living
[51:54] voice. It It's a message. It's a
[51:58] narrative concerning some occurrence or
[52:00] living voice for immediate situations
[52:04] right now. I thank God tonight, Brother
[52:07] Joe. We serve a God. He's present right
[52:10] now. If you need deliverance, he's a
[52:13] right now God. If you need healing, he's
[52:16] a right now God. If you need something
[52:19] from mighty God tonight, he's a right
[52:22] now God. Ever present, all knowing, all
[52:26] powerful.
[52:28] [Applause]
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's a right now God. Amen.
[52:32] He He's here. He's a living voice. He's
[52:36] the word. Brother Ram makes a statement
[52:38] like this. He's the word. The word is
[52:41] he.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; John 15:7 says, "If you abide in me and
[52:48] my words abide in you, you shall ask
[52:52] whatever you will and it shall be done
[52:55] unto you."
[52:57] &gt;&gt; This word here means remma also. It
[53:01] dwells. It continues. It's not to
[53:04] depart. It's present word that
[53:08] continues.
[53:09] Are you with me for a moment? We'd like
[53:11] to minister tonight just for a few
[53:13] moments on the bride's arsenal.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this for a moment. Amen.
[53:20] It tells you, Amen. Take the sword of
[53:24] the spirit.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes from a word meaning
[53:28] remma, meaning a living voice.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just the word alone, but a
[53:35] word that's alive. Amen. Another say it
[53:39] like this tonight. Amen. Rema word.
[53:42] Amen. Is a special uh help in a specific
[53:47] moment in your life.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you're not calling on a God
[53:51] way up here somewhere or a God back in
[53:54] wide oak somewhere or a a God over in a
[53:58] donut place in Water Ridge somewhere.
[54:00] But right now, he's ever present. He's a
[54:03] right now God. Amen. And then that's
[54:06] what Paul was saying. Take the word.
[54:09] Amen. Let the word live and roll in your
[54:11] life.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; It's present word.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Brother would say it like this. The
[54:17] transforming power of God that's taken
[54:20] us from the chaos of science and
[54:22] education and the things of the world
[54:25] and the understanding of the modern day
[54:28] has transformed us now into sons and
[54:31] daughters of God.
[54:33] Even death itself can never hold us in
[54:37] the grave.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; We'll be changed in the moment in a
[54:42] twinkling of an eye.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Oh church, the grave, where is your
[54:47] victory? Death, where is your sting? We
[54:50] got a revelation tonight, church. Amen.
[54:53] We may, Sister Martha, we may take our
[54:56] last breath on this earth.
[55:00] They may lay us in a ground somewhere,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; but when you take your last breath,
[55:07] remma word never dies.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; There's no ceasing to the Rema word
[55:13] that's been placed in our bosom.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you, you might not
[55:18] be able to hear that trumpet sound with
[55:19] a natural ear. Amen. You'll be laying
[55:22] there dormant, this body going back to
[55:25] the dust. But all of a sudden,
[55:28] There's a shout and a voice and a trump
[55:31] of God,
[55:33] &gt;&gt; church, they can bury us in the ground.
[55:35] They can bury us at sea. Amen. When that
[55:38] trumpet sounds, Amen. our ears are going
[55:41] to hear. Amen. And we're going to
[55:44] respond to the call. It's not by the
[55:47] natural ears. It's by the rema word.
[55:51] It's a sword of God. Amen. It's even
[55:53] working when we don't even realize it's
[55:55] working.
[55:57] Hallelujah. He said, "I am the
[56:00] resurrection and life.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; He that believeth in me, though he was
[56:05] dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever
[56:08] liveth and believeth of me shall never
[56:11] die.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; There is no way to stop the living word
[56:20] of God."
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, they can put you in a
[56:24] casket. They can bury you six foot
[56:26] under.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they can never stop the living
[56:31] word of God. Death can't stop it. Hell
[56:34] can't stop it. Feelings can't stop it.
[56:37] Churches can't stop it.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And the quote goes on, it's got to rise
[56:43] again.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. No matter what they do
[56:49] to this body. Amen. Look at us tonight,
[56:52] church. Amen. What a resurrection that
[56:54] was. I am is a living God, not a dead
[56:58] God. He's not the God I was. He's the
[57:01] God of I am.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; It's a living voice.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a It's an utterance.
[57:10] It's a message of hope.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; A message of liberty. A message of
[57:16] peace.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no way to stop it.
[57:20] It's going to rise again. The word of
[57:23] God will defeat Satan anyone any
[57:27] grounds.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Any place, anywhere, at any time.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And if the word abides in you,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He says, then
[57:41] you are anointed. How many anointed we
[57:44] got here tonight? If the word abides in
[57:48] you,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; then you got a living voice within you.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Then you're anointed person with the
[57:55] word.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Ye abide in me and my word in you. Ask
[58:00] what you will.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That's Christ in you.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Anointing the word for the age.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Not just a good God of history, but a
[58:11] God tied to the God of I am.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the living God?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "What is the living God?"
[58:22] &gt;&gt; The word in you.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What was some arsenal
[58:28] tonight?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the living God? Brother
[58:31] says, "The word in you making itself
[58:36] real."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; In other words, manifesting.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The living God, the
[58:43] word in you. Can you say in me?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Making itself real. He says, "Whoa." And
[58:50] the word of God, which is God, is made
[58:54] flesh in tabernacles of flesh.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to leave this
[58:59] service tonight never thinking about you
[59:02] being a coward.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want you leaving here thinking
[59:06] that you're just 16 element of of trash.
[59:09] Come on.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I want you to realize it doesn't matter
[59:12] what your name is,

[59:21] Doesn't matter what you drive. I want
[59:23] you to know what matters is Christ in
[59:27] you, the hope of glory.

[59:40] the hope of glory.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:45] It's God made flesh in you.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; When God equips his man,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I love this tonight.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; When God equips his man, he equips him
[1:00:01] with his own
[1:00:03] material. Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Matt, if you could tell me
[1:00:07] what God is made out of,

[1:00:24] stuff that cannot be bluffed. You say,
[1:00:26] "Brother Joe, I made a mistake today."
[1:00:28] You're made out of stuff that just can't
[1:00:30] be bluffed. It goes beyond this flesh.
[1:00:34] It goes beyond the spirit.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm telling you, there's
[1:00:40] something down inside of this humanity.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; A church can't give it to you. I don't
[1:00:46] care how good a preacher or pastor we
[1:00:48] have. He can instill eternal life in
[1:00:51] you. He can preach the word.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; And he can preach the word. And I tell
[1:00:56] you, the word in season will cross your
[1:01:00] path.

[1:01:04] service thinking, "I'm coming to be
[1:01:06] seen. I'm coming mom and daddy. I'm

[1:02:09] humanity.

[1:02:41] supernaturally equipped.

[1:02:48] do to us.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; They can talk about us.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; They can make fun of us.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. They can strip you of
[1:02:56] everything you got. They could take
[1:02:59] everything that you have.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Look at Paul and Silas. They took
[1:03:04] everything they had, put them in it
[1:03:06] below the dungeons of hell. Amen. There
[1:03:09] was darkness. There was no light. They
[1:03:12] was tormented.

[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; They It was a place that
[1:03:26] sent somebody into a sananity.
[1:03:30] Oh, hell thought they had these two
[1:03:33] believers.

[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, about the midnight hour. I'm here to
[1:03:38] tell you, they couldn't take this away
[1:03:40] from them. There was some word grenades
[1:03:43] down inside of Paul and Silas.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And when they begin to pray, and when
[1:03:49] they begin to sing, and when they begin
[1:03:52] to praise their God,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; oh, they didn't care. They was made fun
[1:03:57] of, who cares tonight. I tell you
[1:03:59] tonight, church, there's some more Paul
[1:04:01] and Salacuses in the midst of this age
[1:04:04] of darkness and gloom and doom.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And they're trying to take all
[1:04:10] everything away from us. Strip us of our
[1:04:13] our rights.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but they can't take this away from
[1:04:17] us.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; The world didn't give it to us and the
[1:04:20] world can't take it away.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; I tell you about the midnight hours,
[1:04:26] something begin to happen.
[1:04:31] When two believers
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; when two believers, Can I have two
[1:04:35] believers tonight? When two believers
[1:04:38] begin to praise their God,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; forget about what's going on today.
[1:04:43] Amen. And just begin to praise their
[1:04:45] God. I'm here to tell you, he's a God

[1:05:06] like they was outclassed outnumbered.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But he began to tell them
[1:05:13] stand still.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; This is not your battle.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's battle.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to fight in this battle.
[1:05:24] just stand still and see the salvation
[1:05:27] of the Lord.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Church, the opposition was so great, but
[1:05:33] they begin to praise their Lord.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; They begin to sing and shout and praise
[1:05:37] their king,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; and God showed up and showed out just
[1:05:41] like he did for you.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same God.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love him?
[1:05:50] Brother B says the greatest power in the
[1:05:52] world is not atomic bomb but believer in
[1:05:56] contact with his maker.

[1:06:02] Holy Ghost.

[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There was a super
[1:06:18] energy that was exorted. It was
[1:06:21] exhaustion of power when he picked up
[1:06:24] the jawbone. It wasn't an old dried up
[1:06:27] jawbone that began to destroy a thousand
[1:06:30] Philistines.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It was a super energy.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; It was the exhaustion of God's power
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; to a place. Brother Cow, he said when
[1:06:41] Sansson be to strike, it was God
[1:06:44] striking with him. It wasn't a jawbone.
[1:06:47] It was a covenant.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:51] Every time he struck, the power of God
[1:06:54] struck with it.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:07:00] the brains of the army lays in its
[1:07:03] captain.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Brother said the intelligence
[1:07:08] lays within the captain. It's God
[1:07:11] selected,
[1:07:13] God ordained. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you tonight, brother
[1:07:16] Brown. You God selected,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; God ordained,

[1:07:27] world or the world to come lives right
[1:07:30] in you.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; The all- wise God know how to equip his
[1:07:36] army. He equipped it with the baptism of
[1:07:40] the Holy Ghost. What is the baptism of
[1:07:43] the Holy Ghost? It's the same material,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; brother David. He said he rewrapped the
[1:07:49] gift and he sent it back to you. I'm
[1:07:51] here to tell you the same power that
[1:07:54] Jesus defeated the devil with is the
[1:07:57] same power that you and I are going to
[1:07:59] defeat the devil with. It's the same
[1:08:02] anointing. It's the same material.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:11] He says it lives right in you.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Dressed you in the whole armor of God.

[1:08:24] the spirit.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Which is the rema word. A living
[1:08:28] presence, a present day help, a present
[1:08:31] day deliverance, a present day healing.
[1:08:35] So don't tell me of all the
[1:08:37] impossibilities tonight.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; We got untapped resources
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; where all things are possible.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I will not leave you
[1:08:48] comfortless,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to send you a comforter."
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Is it is the divine strength needed that
[1:08:56] you can he enables you to overcome every
[1:08:59] trial that you're going to face. Amen.

[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; brother say there has to come a real
[1:09:18] bride.
[1:09:19] There must come one that's not only got
[1:09:22] the mechanics,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; but she's got the dynamics of it.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says. Not just the
[1:09:29] logos, not just the mechanics, but the
[1:09:32] dynamics to make the church live.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Move in the power of his resurrection.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; The power of God, excuse me, the whole
[1:09:48] armor of God. I love this quote. Amen.
[1:09:51] The power of God, the whole armor of
[1:09:53] God, the entire word of God is wrapped
[1:09:57] up in you. Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the devil's lies
[1:10:01] tonight. You're not a second cousin. The
[1:10:04] power of God, the whole armor of God.
[1:10:06] How many believers we have in the house
[1:10:07] tonight? How many sealed with the
[1:10:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost? Amen. You're
[1:10:12] made out of stuff that can't be bluff.
[1:10:14] The material of Almighty God is living
[1:10:17] within mortal flesh.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; He's making it live.
[1:10:25] regardless whether all hell wages
[1:10:28] against you.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of God, the whole
[1:10:34] armor of God, the entire word of God
[1:10:37] wrapped up in you.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; It's wrapped up within a believer is
[1:10:41] screaming out,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; It's got a living voice."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ.
[1:10:49] Through Christ. Can you say it with me
[1:10:51] tonight? Through Christ I can do all
[1:10:54] things through this ream of word that is
[1:10:58] residing within this portion of clay.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; It might not look much to the world,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; but you can imagine Papa God looking
[1:11:08] down. Amen. Upon your life and he sees
[1:11:12] the very manifestation
[1:11:14] of him walking again in shoe leather.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Oh, they scream out in
[1:11:20] this age. This is my son whom I'm well
[1:11:24] pleased to dwell in
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ in bride form.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's more than a quote,
[1:11:32] church. It's a reality. You're looking
[1:11:36] at it tonight. I don't know about you
[1:11:38] tonight, but I'm Jesus Christ in bright
[1:11:41] form. I'm a believer. I've been
[1:11:44] anointed.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] The whole power of God, the whole armory
[1:11:48] of God, the entire word of God is
[1:11:51] wrapped up in me.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Say, Brother Joe, it's your portion. I
[1:11:58] tell you, I'll take it.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; It's still the same material.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; It's still the same ocean.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; It's still the same God. It's still the
[1:12:07] same word.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] The most powerful weapon, as brother
[1:12:14] Andrew covered this so good last
[1:12:15] Wednesday, is a committ.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; What a weapon. Just to let go
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; and speak his word in season.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You speak the word
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and I will perform it.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; That is my covenant. There you go. There
[1:12:34] is That's my covenant and it can never
[1:12:36] fail. You speak the word and I will
[1:12:40] perform it.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Christ is the energy or the exhaustion
[1:12:45] of power. Brother Bramble said, "Your
[1:12:47] lips is his lips."
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; When you're energized,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; when you're at an exhaustion of power
[1:12:55] from Almighty God, you he Jesus Christ
[1:12:59] is the energy. And he said, "You are the
[1:13:01] show pitcher.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You are his hands when you're energized.
[1:13:07] It's not the jawbone.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; It's because Samson was energized.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; There was an extortion of power
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; that wasn't a part of Samson.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Actually, Samson was a ruddy fella.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; David was a ruddy fella.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't much to look at. But once he
[1:13:29] got feeling of them locks and he
[1:13:32] realized I'm covenant, I'm a part of the
[1:13:35] promise. God cannot fail me. God cannot
[1:13:39] forsaken me.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the enemy was coming in
[1:13:44] like a flood. Amen. He reached down and
[1:13:47] picked up an a little jawbone that
[1:13:50] looked broken down to the world. But
[1:13:52] when it was placed in a man that was
[1:13:55] built to possess the gates of his enemy.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let me tell you
[1:14:01] something. In the natural, that old
[1:14:04] jawbone would have broke when it hit the
[1:14:05] first helmet. But when God when Samson
[1:14:09] struck by the anointing of Almighty God,
[1:14:12] it was the energy of Almighty God that
[1:14:15] was exorting through the hand of
[1:14:18] mortality.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Morgan, he bet he be to dent
[1:14:26] some helmets with an old brittle jawbone
[1:14:29] of a mule.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:32] Oh, it's fanaticism.
[1:14:34] It always has been. He say still's the
[1:14:37] same God tonight.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Samson was the show
[1:14:43] picture, but God was the energy.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; It was a screen showing that God's not
[1:14:52] dead.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Why is a confession such a powerful
[1:15:00] weapon?
[1:15:02] Have I been too long?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Why is the confession such a powerful
[1:15:08] weapon?
[1:15:10] You are transforming the battle.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; You want to live defeated, fight your
[1:15:18] own battles.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, preach, brother Joe. I believe I am.
[1:15:23] Amen. You know why? Cuz I have fought
[1:15:25] tried to fight many of my battles.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You know what? I find a short end of the
[1:15:29] deal every time.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; But the most powerful weapon is a
[1:15:34] committal letting go. That's right.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; And a confession. Amen. Saying what's
[1:15:40] already been said. Like brother Andrew
[1:15:42] said, and you transferring the battle. A
[1:15:47] it's not your battle any longer. There's
[1:15:50] a ream of word down inside of this clay
[1:15:54] that begins to speak word in season.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Oh church, there is nothing in this
[1:16:03] world could defeat this bride walking in
[1:16:07] thus saith the Lord.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; There's this great show picture.
[1:16:18] It was God discipline the power of of
[1:16:22] heaven.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Brother David Samson beat down a
[1:16:30] thousand Philistines
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; with a jawbone.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:41] Could you imagine what kind of revival
[1:16:45] that Sansa was in that he could have
[1:16:47] enough strength to keep pressing the
[1:16:49] battle?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing the battle. You think a
[1:16:53] thousand Philistines, a thousand men
[1:16:56] that Samson handled
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; that day. What a great victory.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; But it was a show picture to the world
[1:17:07] that God is real.
[1:17:11] God's always going to have a witness.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you in 2025.
[1:17:19] There's a great picture
[1:17:22] going on in Lead Ocean.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody is this playing.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody's a covenant people.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:34] Somebody is exhorting Christ power.
[1:17:38] Somebody is speaking remma word
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; and of slaying the enemy
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; to let this world know the exhaustion of
[1:17:50] power of God is still real
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; and it's still powerful.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; The battle is on.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; He said God dresses his army.
[1:18:06] He says, "What kind of equipment do we
[1:18:08] use?" The spirit of the sword.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then brother Brown goes
[1:18:13] through the progression of bow and
[1:18:15] arrow, rock and hammer, the the the
[1:18:18] musket, there comes a Springfield." He
[1:18:20] says, "And then he it keeps evolving
[1:18:22] down to atomic weapon."
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "We," he says, "But God at the
[1:18:30] beginning
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; gave his children the atomic weapon."
[1:18:34] Come on.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; The pinnacle of weapons
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; because he's an infinite God.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; It's the intelligence of Almighty God.
[1:18:44] Seeing there was going to be a conflict,
[1:18:46] there was going to be a battle,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; God equipped his children with the right
[1:18:52] kind of ammunition and the right kind of
[1:18:56] attack and the right kind of everything
[1:18:59] they have need of that would sweep them
[1:19:02] not only to revival to revival, church
[1:19:05] service to church service, but from the
[1:19:07] Garden of Eden all the way to the
[1:19:10] rapture.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The intelligence of God. He
[1:19:18] said the right kind of attack. What was
[1:19:21] it? The word.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; When you got the armor of God on, you
[1:19:26] can take the sword of God with faith and
[1:19:30] cut your way through any promises. If
[1:19:33] sickness stands in your way, cut it
[1:19:35] away.
[1:19:37] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:19:39] carnal, but mighty through what?
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; God to the pulling down of strongholds.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He's equipped us
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; with the anointing.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The rema word.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; A living voice.
[1:20:03] Speak the word.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And I will perform it.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; What an age of overcoming.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You're my bride.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; All I am, I give to you.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] I give you my word. I give you my the
[1:20:21] artillery. I give you the arsenal that
[1:20:24] will defeat Satan any place, any time,
[1:20:28] under any condition. Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who he is, where he's
[1:20:33] coming from, or where he's at.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It will defeat him. Oh, church. I'm
[1:20:40] telling you, the bride's arsenal. He
[1:20:42] said, "I'll give you a energy, exorion
[1:20:45] of power."
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's in the age of such darkness, the
[1:20:51] age of such chatter chatter, age of such
[1:20:54] depression, age of such oppression.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Age of funny feelings, age of hatred.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to anoint my church with a
[1:21:07] flying eagle.
[1:21:09] I'm going to anoint her and equipped her
[1:21:12] with the right
[1:21:14] anointing
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; for the right age.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, right in the middle of Satan's Eden,
[1:21:21] the intelligence of God. I'll anoint my
[1:21:25] bride with the anointing of a flying
[1:21:28] eagle.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. Grace tabernacle. When
[1:21:32] the devil tries to hunt at your windows
[1:21:34] and attack you at every corner, attack
[1:21:37] your body with sickness, attack your
[1:21:40] spirit with with a spirit of hatred or
[1:21:43] bitterness,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:21:51] We got the anointed
[1:21:55] of a flying eagle.
[1:21:58] when it tries to jump on your and attach
[1:22:00] yourself to your body or attach yourself
[1:22:03] to your spirit.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And it'll try to attach and try to grow
[1:22:08] and try to compound the problem and
[1:22:11] begin to talk in your ear and try to
[1:22:13] cause you to be defeated, cause you to
[1:22:15] lay out of church, cause you to quit
[1:22:17] church, quit quit hanging around and
[1:22:19] fellowshipping. What is it? It's the
[1:22:22] those are you still a Christian?
[1:22:24] Absolutely. Are you still filled with
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost? Absolutely. But
[1:22:29] something has attached itself to your
[1:22:31] spirit realm or to your flesh.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I read a story the other day talking
[1:22:41] about a crow and how a crow will attach
[1:22:44] itself to an eagle.
[1:22:50] And he says that's the only bird,
[1:22:52] brother Matt, that will actually try to
[1:22:55] torment an eagle
[1:22:58] by attaching himself to his back. He'll
[1:23:01] peck at his neck relentlessly,
[1:23:05] annoying the eagle. But the eagle stays
[1:23:09] calm.
[1:23:11] And the higher the eagle soarses,
[1:23:14] the thinner the air becomes.
[1:23:17] And the crow that's attached to the
[1:23:20] spirit realm or to the body, it can't
[1:23:24] handle the altitude.
[1:23:27] Eventually, the grow gas gaps.
[1:23:30] Oh, that's what I want to do to that
[1:23:32] devil tonight. Amen. Eventually, amen,
[1:23:35] your altitude determines your
[1:23:38] destination. Amen. Your altitude begins
[1:23:42] to torment the devil. Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And then you begin to suffocate.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, is that what we want to do tonight?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Eventually, the crow gas and loses its
[1:23:55] strength and power and falls off the
[1:23:58] eagle.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Not because the eagle attacked. It's
[1:24:02] because the eagle ascended.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It just kept going higher.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; They can't follow you forever.
[1:24:13] Your growth will suffocate their noise.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me read a quote. I'm
[1:24:20] going to close in a minute. But the
[1:24:22] eagle, I watched him for a few minutes.
[1:24:24] After a while, he got tired of hearing
[1:24:26] the chatter chatter. So, it just made
[1:24:29] one big jump and flopped his wings.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And he began to flop his wings about
[1:24:36] three times and he was done beyond the
[1:24:39] timber. Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, he was right up in the
[1:24:43] timber. He could fly a long ways." But
[1:24:45] you know what? He never flopped the
[1:24:47] wings anymore. He just know how to set
[1:24:50] them. It's the intelligence of God. The
[1:24:54] Rema word. Every time the wind would
[1:24:58] come in, he would ride up a little
[1:25:00] higher. Oh, is that what we're doing,
[1:25:03] believers, tonight? How many eagles we
[1:25:05] got in the house? How many crows been
[1:25:07] attaching theirel to your body? I didn't
[1:25:10] say attached itself to your soul. It
[1:25:12] attached himself to your body and your
[1:25:15] spirit.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, come on up higher
[1:25:20] tonight.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Our arsenal is the ability to soar where
[1:25:25] crows can't fly.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And if you'll keep climbing up higher,
[1:25:31] that old devil that's been tormenting
[1:25:33] you and your family will begin to gasp
[1:25:35] for air.
[1:25:38] on you begin to torment the tormentor.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:44] And he says a little higher and he rode
[1:25:47] away and he started crying. I thought,
[1:25:50] Lord, I'm going to have another spell.
[1:25:54] As I looked, there he went and I watched
[1:25:56] him tell he come just a black dot way up
[1:25:58] in the air. I say, Lord, isn't it isn't
[1:26:02] you join this and go join that and flap
[1:26:04] here and flap there, flop there and flop
[1:26:06] there from one place and another. It's
[1:26:09] knowing how to set your wings in the
[1:26:12] power of faith and fly away
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; and leave the earthbound chickm chatter
[1:26:19] chatter. Days of miracles have passed.
[1:26:22] They no such thing as a Holy Ghost. It's
[1:26:25] all nonsense. Chatter, chatter, chatter.
[1:26:29] The chatter of the crow just that's just
[1:26:32] worked up. That's just enthusiasm.
[1:26:35] That's just because you went to church
[1:26:37] camp. That's just because you're young
[1:26:39] people and you want to be seen. Oh no.
[1:26:42] That's chatter, chatter, chatter. He
[1:26:44] says just set your wings.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Chickens can try, but they can't do it.
[1:26:55] Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have in the
[1:26:58] house tonight?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your ability. Brother Al
[1:27:03] said he just begin to set his wings
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; and the living voice of the wind of
[1:27:08] Yahweh begin to come wings.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; It begin to elevate.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Oh church, I believe that's just the way
[1:27:18] it's going on now.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep overcoming. We're
[1:27:22] going to keep climbing higher. Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Until we come a black dot way up in the
[1:27:29] heavenlies somewhere
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; and Satan says, "Where did he go? He
[1:27:34] wasn't was not. He was no more."
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's the way the rapture is going to
[1:27:40] take place. It's not what we can do.
[1:27:43] It's what if we let go.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Let go.
[1:27:54] Let go. Commit it to God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I can't even walk without you.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Without you, Lord.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Just keep your wings of faith out.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm telling you, he's the God that's
[1:28:08] never failed us one time. You spread
[1:28:11] your wings and the wind of God will sell
[1:28:14] under your wings.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:19] He says
[1:28:21] that's the way to get so high in the
[1:28:25] atmospheres of God, God's grace, until
[1:28:29] you don't even hear the chatter chatter
[1:28:31] any longer.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; It becomes dead to you, sir.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; You're up in the heavenlies
[1:28:38] now. An eagle is made a heavenly bird.
[1:28:42] The eagle is a special built bird.
[1:28:48] Good l I'm not going to be able to get
[1:28:50] done tonight.
[1:28:52] Special built bird. He has to be.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; He has to be because he can fly higher
[1:29:04] than any other bird.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want you living here thinking
[1:29:08] you're nothing tonight, church. I'm here
[1:29:11] to tell you you're more
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; than a conqueror.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; You're a believer.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You just need to let go and begin to
[1:29:20] speak the rema word and let God make
[1:29:24] this trial a blessing today.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And he says because now the eagle
[1:29:33] he could fly higher up up
[1:29:39] reward spirit and life.
[1:29:42] A special built bride
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; has everything she has need of.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Oh little bride, it's the exhortion of
[1:29:53] Christ power elevating you above the
[1:29:56] fanaticism of this world.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; He's the energy.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; We're the show pitcher.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:12] Say, "I just pick up converters." No,
[1:30:15] you're a son of God.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just a fireman. No, you're a son of
[1:30:20] God.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just a P. No, you're a son of God.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; I'm just a school teacher. No, I'm a son
[1:30:26] of God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. My
[1:30:31] God is proud of you.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you tonight, those
[1:30:38] crows that's been attaching to us has
[1:30:40] reached the point they can't go any
[1:30:42] farther.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's want to show his strength
[1:30:47] tonight.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He wants Oh,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; we just seen it the other day. I watched
[1:30:55] this on Fox New.
[1:30:58] Amen. When the Putin got off the plane
[1:31:00] and the president of Russia got off the
[1:31:03] plane and met Donald Trump down there
[1:31:04] and they begin to shake hands and they
[1:31:06] begin to walk down that red carpet, it
[1:31:09] wasn't a coincidence that the B2 bomber
[1:31:12] came flying over.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It was United States of America wanting
[1:31:17] to show their strength because that B2
[1:31:21] bomber, it can fly around the world and
[1:31:24] not be seen. But for a moment they let
[1:31:28] our enemy feel the vibrations and see
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; the show of strength. Oh church, I
[1:31:37] believe that's what's happening in the
[1:31:39] hour that we're living in. Amen. It's a
[1:31:42] show of strength. The invisible God
[1:31:46] become invisible for a moment to let
[1:31:50] hell know that God's not dead. He is
[1:31:54] alive.
[1:31:57] It's you tonight, church. It's you
[1:31:59] tonight.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You're the show picture. You're the show
[1:32:04] of strength.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I could say I'm one of
[1:32:14] them.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you hear that?
[1:32:23] That's the sound of freedom.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's in my notes, too.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; I might not get to it.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to skip this. I like to get
[1:32:40] to one more point. Is that okay?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's my birthday. Can I have 10 more
[1:32:44] minutes?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; I'm just having a good time. Can't have
[1:32:48] no more funner than this.
[1:32:51] If you're in the line of duty, no matter
[1:32:54] what stays in the way.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; The greatest experiences I've ever had
[1:32:59] is up against when you're up against
[1:33:01] something and you can't get over it,
[1:33:03] under it, just stand there and watch God
[1:33:07] make a way through it.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; That's a way to do it. Just keep moving
[1:33:12] and press your nose against it.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; For once, you can be nosy. put your nose
[1:33:19] against it and just keep moving on. What
[1:33:22] is he saying?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Just get right up against it.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of your enemy.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Get up right up. Bump up against your
[1:33:30] promise. Put your nose right into it and
[1:33:33] keep moving.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not your business to open the
[1:33:36] Red Sea. It's God's business.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; God's going to back his word.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Can I have a amen on that? Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; How many believe tonight as we're fixing
[1:33:48] to close, how many believes that God
[1:33:51] backs his up his own word?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Too many promises, too much word,
[1:33:55] heaven's earth passed away. His word can
[1:33:57] never come back.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; So God's going to back up his word.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; God's going to back you up.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; They laughed at David.
[1:34:09] He came out with a slingshot and a few
[1:34:12] stones,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; but God backed him up.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; They laughed at Samson,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; when he picked up a jawbone,
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; but God backed him up.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; They laughed at Shamgar when he picked
[1:34:26] up an oxo, but God backed him up.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; They laughed at the three Hebrew
[1:34:32] children, the young people,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; standing on God's word,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; but he was a fourth man in the fire.
[1:34:38] Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; God backed his children up.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; They laughed at him.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand tonight,
[1:34:48] little bride?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, soon, as brother Matt
[1:34:53] said, soon they will not be laughing
[1:34:56] anymore.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's going to back you up.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Why sit here and die? we can go to the
[1:35:08] enemy's camp.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And when their faith when they begin to
[1:35:12] spread their wings, those those four
[1:35:14] lepers begin to spread their wings and
[1:35:17] go toward the enemy's camp, God back
[1:35:21] them up.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they got down there, church,
[1:35:25] they was all gone.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God magnified the footsteps
[1:35:33] of those believing lepers
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; and they thought a whole army was coming
[1:35:39] in and it was just four broken down
[1:35:42] crowatt attaching leprosy.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, but they kept flying
[1:35:50] and begin to suffocate. Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; I say, proclaim you among the Gentiles.
[1:36:00] Prepare for war. Rake up the mighty men.
[1:36:04] Let all the men of war draw near. Let
[1:36:07] them come up and beat your plowshares in
[1:36:10] the swords and your pruning hooks in the
[1:36:13] spears. And let the weak say, "I'm
[1:36:16] defeated.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I can't make it."
[1:36:21] Let the weak that the crows are attached
[1:36:24] to, let the weak confess they are
[1:36:29] strong.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing is going to stop
[1:36:34] this bride. No weapon formed against her
[1:36:38] is going to prosper. Why? Because God is
[1:36:42] going to back up his word. And his word
[1:36:46] is born in the manger of your hearts.
[1:36:53] No wonder brother Bam can make that
[1:36:54] statement. We're made out of stuff that
[1:36:56] just can't be bluffed.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not fly somebody. Hey, we're
[1:37:02] born of this world, but we're not of
[1:37:04] this world.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; We found who we really was.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this tonight.
[1:37:12] There was a hero in Switzerland. Brother
[1:37:16] B said he took all those spears and
[1:37:19] found the deepest place and he threw up
[1:37:22] his arms and ran as hard as he could and
[1:37:25] screamed with all his m might, "Make way
[1:37:28] for liberty.
[1:37:30] Make way for liberty." And when he ran,
[1:37:33] a hund spears turned to catch him with
[1:37:36] nothing but his bare bosom open in the
[1:37:38] midst of a bunch of them that ran to
[1:37:40] grabbing an armful of spears, plunging
[1:37:42] them into his chest. They caught him
[1:37:45] with the spears running through him as
[1:37:47] such a display. What a hero.
[1:37:51] He routed the whole alien army. Those
[1:37:54] Swiss men followed with sticks and
[1:37:56] stones and beat the alien army plum out
[1:37:58] of the country.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Because one man was willing to step out
[1:38:04] and take the place and make a sacrifice
[1:38:07] that was needed.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; But my brother, listen, that was a small
[1:38:11] thing. when one day Adam's race was
[1:38:14] backed into a corner. And God has sent
[1:38:17] them a law. They didn't keep it. God
[1:38:20] sent the prophets. They stoned them,
[1:38:21] made fun of them. Then they sent them
[1:38:23] judges. They wouldn't tell him to rule
[1:38:25] over them. Every hope had been lost.
[1:38:27] Adam's race was sin, sickness, diseases.
[1:38:30] All was backed in a corner. And the
[1:38:32] devil was with his own marching army.
[1:38:34] Diseases, sin, whipping Adam's race down
[1:38:37] just as fast as he could. And then one
[1:38:39] stepped out of heaven.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. But then
[1:38:47] somebody stepped out of heaven.
[1:38:50] This day I'm going to go to earth. And
[1:38:53] he stepped out and took Joe Reynolds
[1:38:56] place.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; When he was on earth, he looked and seen
[1:39:00] with the greatest dread that man had.
[1:39:02] The thickest spears was death. Ever.
[1:39:05] Man's afraid of death. And he raised his
[1:39:08] precious hands to the heavens. And he
[1:39:10] struck the very hardest part of the
[1:39:12] worst enemy man has. And he plunged the
[1:39:14] spear of death into his own precious
[1:39:16] bosom. And he sent back on the day of
[1:39:19] Pentecost through Adam's fallen race the
[1:39:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost, saying, "Take
[1:39:25] up this and do the best you can. Fight
[1:39:28] away ignorance. Fight away superstition.
[1:39:31] Fight away sin. Fight away sickness."
[1:39:34] Men who claim that kiss the rim of the
[1:39:36] cup of blessing God. How can we hold our
[1:39:38] peace and such a time when God has given
[1:39:41] us the most powerful weapon that man
[1:39:45] ever placed a place in the man's hands
[1:39:49] to fight against sin, sickness,
[1:39:53] ignorance, superstition, isms. He says
[1:39:57] it's a real sky full of genuine
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; and we stand in the corner like a bunch
[1:40:06] of cowards.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; God wants men. God wants women who will
[1:40:13] stand out and take the place.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Listen to this in closing. God wants a
[1:40:20] hero.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; God wants a hero. Could you be one? He
[1:40:27] says, "Could you be one tonight, Grace
[1:40:29] Tabernacle? Could you be a hero?" Yes,
[1:40:32] sir.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. This is God's word which is
[1:40:36] sharper than any two-edged sword. It's
[1:40:40] the greatest power that ever was put in
[1:40:43] the hands of man. God is expecting
[1:40:46] Adam's race to put sickness, sin,
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; devils to the fighting walls. Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; We got the most powerful weapon there
[1:40:56] is.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; They followed this hero with sticks and
[1:41:01] stones.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "But Christ led us with the
[1:41:07] word and spirit."
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; The rema word. Hallelujah. A living
[1:41:15] voice.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He left us with the most powerful weapon
[1:41:19] was his word. the mechanics and the
[1:41:23] spirit, the dynamics. He says, "Let's
[1:41:26] fight."
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, Satan. Come on, crows.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Let's fight.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; He left us with the best weapon that
[1:41:34] would defeat Satan any place
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; under any condition.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; We've got it.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; It ain't a cold that we got.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; It ain't co that we got. We got it.
[1:41:49] Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; What you got, brother Joe? Holy Ghost
[1:41:52] and fire.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Shut up in this clay.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Hell can't silence it.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Demons can't stop it.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you're you're blowing again,
[1:42:03] brother. No, I'm a hero.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; God wants a hero. Say, "God, I'm your
[1:42:09] hero tonight."
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; He gave them sticks and stones. They
[1:42:13] seen their hero. He went out there and
[1:42:16] took the the the the spears into his
[1:42:18] bosom and they took sticks and stones
[1:42:21] and began to fight. He said, "What about
[1:42:23] you people? What about you eagles?" He's
[1:42:26] led you with the most powerful weapon.
[1:42:28] Don't let that crow defeat you. Don't
[1:42:31] let that crow attach to your spirit any
[1:42:33] longer.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Let's fight.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Can I have a witness tonight?
[1:42:43] We got the most powerful weapon. He
[1:42:45] says, "Let's stand for Christ."
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Christ left us a word and spirit. Let's
[1:42:50] fight. Let's stand for Christ. Let's
[1:42:52] stand for the word.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Let's pull the sword out of our sheath.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; It's our only form of offense.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest gift or weapon that
[1:43:11] God could ever give you.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; It can defeat Satan any place from the
[1:43:18] Garden of Eden
[1:43:20] until the rapture.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; And you got it.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And you got it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And you're all backed up.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; God is backing you up.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; You are his show of strength in 2025.
[1:43:36] Grace Tabernacle. It's a good feeling,
[1:43:40] Pastor Matt. We boy, your people is a
[1:43:42] good show up here. True two true word
[1:43:46] tabernacle meeting Youth Valley, man.
[1:43:49] Your people, they conduct themselves.
[1:43:51] There's a great show picture for Grace
[1:43:54] Tabernacle. Well, how's that make you
[1:43:56] feel? Well, I tell you how it made him
[1:43:57] feel. He couldn't wait to get up here
[1:43:58] Sunday morning and tell the church about
[1:44:00] it.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's proud of us.
[1:44:04] How much more is God proud of us
[1:44:05] tonight, church? We're a show picture.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; We got it.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; We're Jesus Christ in bride form
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; with an arsenal that can't be stopped.
[1:44:17] They could put us in a grave. We're
[1:44:19] going to rise again. They could put us
[1:44:21] in a sea. We're going to rise again.
[1:44:23] They could put us in a dungeon. We're
[1:44:25] going to rise again.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Spread your wings.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Let me finish this. He said, "Let's
[1:44:34] stand for the word."
[1:44:37] Men and women, it's time that we pick up
[1:44:39] the weapon
[1:44:41] that our hero of God
[1:44:44] with God's love left us
[1:44:48] and dash out yonder and fight fight
[1:44:51] against ignorance.
[1:44:54] I guess he is fighting some ignorance.
[1:44:57] Fighting some ignorance. What kind of
[1:44:59] ignorance is letting that crow attach
[1:45:00] yourself to our spirits and let him find
[1:45:03] a place of abode? I say we need to run
[1:45:06] him off. He's on po posted ground
[1:45:09] tonight.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That's water has no right to be there.
[1:45:13] You know I if the musicians will come.
[1:45:15] Amen. You know the only power Satan has
[1:45:18] tonight is when you give it to him.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] That crow will stay there as long as you
[1:45:27] let him attach. But when that eagle got
[1:45:29] tired of the chatter chatter, oh yeah,
[1:45:32] he was equipped.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's all I'm saying tonight. Brother
[1:45:36] David, you are equipped. Brother Phil,
[1:45:38] you're equipped.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, you're equipped.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Johnny, you're equipped.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; I'm equipped.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Why sit here and be defeated? Let's go
[1:45:50] to the enemy's camp and take back what
[1:45:52] belongs to us.
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; They might laugh at us,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; but soon they wouldn't be laughing any
[1:46:05] longer.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Fight against ignorance, superstitions,
[1:46:14] formality, and break down the walls of

[1:48:56] is in the Lord
[1:49:00] forever
[1:49:01] more.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I stand it all one more time.
[1:49:08] All within the presence of the Lord.
[1:49:13] The intelligence of Almighty God.
[1:49:18] Lord
[1:49:20] whom the raing of the seas subides
[1:49:27] oh living

[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him, saints?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:20] When the music fades
[1:50:24] and all it swept away, I just simply
[1:50:28] come
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:33] longing just to bring.
[1:50:37] Oh, something that's a word that will
[1:50:40] bless your heart.
[1:50:46] I'll bring you more than a song.
[1:50:50] For a song in itself is not what you
[1:50:54] have required.
[1:50:59] You search much deeper with me.
[1:51:03] Through the way things,
[1:51:06] you're looking into my heart.
[1:51:12] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:51:18] When it's all about you,
[1:51:21] when it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:51:25] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing that I
[1:51:29] made.
[1:51:31] When it's all about you.
[1:51:34] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:45] Being a pinless.
[1:51:49] No one could express
[1:51:52] how much you deserve.
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:51:58] Though I'm weak and I'm bored.
[1:52:02] Oh, all I have is yours. All I need.
[1:52:08] Oh, do you believe it, saints?
[1:52:11] I bring you more than a song.
[1:52:15] For a song in it is not what you have
[1:52:20] required.
[1:52:24] You search much deeper within
[1:52:28] than the dream.
[1:52:30] You're looking into my heart.
[1:52:37] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:52:42] When it's all about you,
[1:52:46] it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:52:51] for the things I made.
[1:52:55] And it's all about you.
[1:52:58] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:53:03] Can we just bow our hearts, Lord Jesus?
[1:53:06] Lord God, we thank you, Lord,
[1:53:09] for allowing us to be a part of this
[1:53:11] greatest hour there ever has been. What
[1:53:14] a showdown that's been going on here in
[1:53:17] this this last day and age, Lord God.
[1:53:20] But most of all, Lord, we thank you,
[1:53:22] Lord, for sending back the material,
[1:53:25] Lord God, that hell can't stop, Lord.
[1:53:28] The same material that you're made out
[1:53:30] of, though the greatest weapon is a
[1:53:32] believer in contact with this material,
[1:53:35] Lord.
[1:53:37] Oh, Lord God, hell can't stop us, Lord.
[1:53:40] The grave can't stop us. Death can't
[1:53:42] stop us, Lord.
[1:53:44] We're going to make it.
[1:53:47] Oh, we believe it, Lord. Just in a few
[1:53:50] more days,
[1:53:52] we're going to be walking. We're going
[1:53:54] to walk right out of this dimension of
[1:53:56] of sorrow, this dimension of sickness
[1:54:00] and diseases into a dimension will never
[1:54:03] hurt again. There'll be no more death.
[1:54:05] There'll be no more sorrow.
[1:54:08] Lord, we're spreading our wings now
[1:54:10] knowing it just a matter of days. We're
[1:54:13] going to be a dot that's going to be was
[1:54:16] not anymore.
[1:54:18] We believe it. That's what the message
[1:54:19] of the hour has explained to us. Lord,
[1:54:23] we know it by revelation. And upon this
[1:54:25] rock, you're going to build your church.
[1:54:28] And the gates of Hades cannot prevail
[1:54:30] against it. Help us, Lord.
[1:54:34] Begin to elevate
[1:54:36] that we can suffocate the crows that
[1:54:38] tries to attach and drain our victory.
[1:54:41] Help us, Lord Jesus. In the name of the
[1:54:44] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray that you
[1:54:46] bless every saint here tonight. We love
[1:54:48] you and thank you for your presence
[1:54:50] tonight, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:54:53] Amen. Just before we turn, I sing a a
[1:54:56] New Testament church rising up.
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:16] Jesus, we believe you're healing
[1:55:18] tonight. Oh God,
[1:55:20] you said by your stripes we are healed.
[1:55:23] Lord God, you said lay hands on the
[1:55:25] sick, Lord, and they shall recover.
[1:55:28] Lord, we anoint our sister with hope.
[1:55:30] Lord, we pray the prayer of faith. Lord
[1:55:32] God, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:35] Christ, I pray that you touch your
[1:55:37] natural body, we ask and believe it now
[1:55:41] in Jesus Christ.
[1:55:44] Amen.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; I believe he's a healer tonight.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:56] I see God's mighty hand. The bride of
[1:56:00] Christ adorned a wedding gown.
[1:56:05] Just like in the days of old, they stood
[1:56:08] in courage b. They turn this whole world
[1:56:12] upside down.
[1:56:15] Oh, rising up,
[1:56:18] rising up.
[1:56:20] Oh, we have some eagles here tonight.
[1:56:25] Oh, rising up.
[1:56:28] rising up.
[1:56:31] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:56:34] up.
[1:56:36] Now, the Bible plainly tells how the
[1:56:39] Holy Ghost is filled
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:43] by apostles.
[1:56:46] Even spirit were cast out in the tail.
[1:56:50] They sing and shout or surrounded by
[1:56:53] God's holy angel. Ain't that much?
[1:56:58] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:02] There's a New Testament church rising.
[1:57:07] Oh, rising up.
[1:57:11] Rising up.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I want to sing this one tonight.
[1:57:17] If you think it's all long gone and the
[1:57:20] miracles are done, I got good news for
[1:57:26] you.
[1:57:28] In the last days,
[1:57:31] out of spirit more what
[1:57:36] we do.

[1:58:09] We're rising up.
[1:58:12] Rising up.
[1:58:15] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:58:18] up.
[1:58:19] Will the Bible plain details how the
[1:58:23] Holy Ghost fell, how signs and wonders
[1:58:27] were done at the apostles.
[1:58:30] Well, demon spirits were cast out in the
[1:58:34] jail. They sang and shout while
[1:58:36] surrounded by God's holy angel way.
[1:58:40] We're rising up.
[1:58:43] Rising up.
[1:58:46] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:58:49] up.
[1:58:51] We're rising up.
[1:58:53] We're rising up.
[1:58:56] Well, there's a New Testament church
[1:58:59] rising up.
[1:59:01] Well, I say Satan, your kingdom's coming
[1:59:04] down.
[1:59:07] Well, Satan, your kingdom's coming down.
[1:59:12] coming down down down coming down down
[1:59:15] down.
[1:59:17] Well, Satan, your kingdom's coming down.
[1:59:21] Won't you tell him, "Well, Satan, your
[1:59:24] kingdom's coming down."
[1:59:27] I say, "Oh, Satan, your kingdom's coming
[1:59:30] down."
[1:59:32] For I heard a voice from heaven say that
[1:59:38] Satan, your kingdom's coming down. now.
[1:59:42] But I know Jesus, this kingdom's rising
[1:59:45] up.
[1:59:48] Well, Jesus, this kingom's rising up.
[1:59:52] Cuz I heard the voice from heaven say,
[1:59:58] "Oh Jesus, this kingdom's rising up."
[2:00:01] Can you tell him like this? Well, Satan,
[2:00:04] I'll tear your kingdom down.
[2:00:08] Well, Satan, I'm going to tear your
[2:00:10] kingdom down.
[2:00:13] Cuz I heard a voice and it's resting in
[2:00:17] my heart. I say, Satan, I'm going to
[2:00:20] tear your kingdom down. How you going to
[2:00:22] do it, brother man? Well, Satan, I'm
[2:00:25] going to praise your kingdom down.
[2:00:28] Willow Satan, I praise your kingdom
[2:00:31] down.
[2:00:33] Cuz I heard a voice from heaven say,
[2:00:39] "Well, Satan, I'm going to praise your
[2:00:41] kingdom down."
[2:00:43] I say, "Oh, Satan, we'll worship your
[2:00:46] kingdom down." I believe that tonight.
[2:00:49] Well, Satan, I worship that your kingdom
[2:00:52] comes falling down. Cuz I heard a voice
[2:00:57] from heaven speak. I say, "Satan, I
[2:01:01] praise your kingdom down."
[2:01:04] I said, "Oh, Satan, I'm going to walk
[2:01:06] your kingdom now." Is that right? By
[2:01:09] faith. The Bible said we walk by faith.
[2:01:11] I'll walk your kingdom down.
[2:01:14] Cuz I've heard the voice from heaven
[2:01:19] speak. I say, "Satan, I'm going to walk
[2:01:22] your kingdom down." What about this one
[2:01:24] right out of the Bible? Well, Satan, I'm
[2:01:26] going to dance your kingdom down.
[2:01:30] Well, now Satan, I'll dance your kingdom
[2:01:33] down.
[2:01:35] Cuz I heard a voice from heaven speak.
[2:01:40] So, Satan, I'm going to dance your
[2:01:43] kingom down.
[2:01:46] [Applause]
[2:01:48] I believe his kingdom's already been
[2:01:51] took a licking tonight. Amen.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that I've heard a voice
[2:01:56] from heaven speak.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Satan, your kingdom is coming down.
[2:01:59] Amen. How many enjoyed that message
[2:02:01] tonight? I'm going to tell you this.
[2:02:06] I think that's powerful that a that a
[2:02:09] the president let a B2 bomber, an
[2:02:12] invisible weapon, become visible in the
[2:02:15] presence of the enemy
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; just long enough that he could feel the
[2:02:18] power of it. And I thought, isn't that
[2:02:20] what our our God done,
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; the Bible said he loved the world and he
[2:02:23] gave his only begotten son?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; That one day whenever Satan thought he
[2:02:27] had this world all in control, but God
[2:02:30] let that invisible power become visible
[2:02:32] upon the earth just long enough that the
[2:02:34] enemy would recognize the power of God.
[2:02:36] That's why when that Holy Ghost in you
[2:02:38] begins to speak to the devil that the
[2:02:40] devil trembles because he recognizes
[2:02:43] that power.
[2:02:44] I I wish I could hear the secret service
[2:02:47] say, "Well, you know, that's awful
[2:02:49] rumbling what you felt, but you only
[2:02:51] felt one of them, but the hundred you
[2:02:53] couldn't see."
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; It has the same power as those that you
[2:02:57] seen come across the battle.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that tonight that God
[2:03:02] has made visible an invisible power in
[2:03:04] our life. That's shouting material right
[2:03:06] there. I I don't know about y'all, but
[2:03:08] that I'm going to be I'm going to be
[2:03:09] feeding on that all night. Let me let me
[2:03:11] say it like a preacher. I'm going to be
[2:03:12] building on that all night. The Bible
[2:03:14] says it's it's uh it's uh seed to the
[2:03:17] ser and bread to the eater. So, I'll
[2:03:19] take it as seed. I I come on build on
[2:03:21] that all night long. I might be in the I
[2:03:22] might not be able to go to sleep tonight
[2:03:24] thinking about that. God becoming
[2:03:26] visible
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; in the presence of our enemies. Amen.
[2:03:30] Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Somebody
[2:03:31] give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[2:03:33] tonight.
[2:03:35] You say, "Brother Matt, I don't have
[2:03:37] what it takes to overcome." Isn't that
[2:03:38] the Isn't that the saying always? I
[2:03:40] don't have what it takes. Well, what
[2:03:42] does it take? I may not be able to
[2:03:44] preach. I might not be able to sing. I
[2:03:46] might not be able to pray like the
[2:03:47] prayer warrior, but what does it take?
[2:03:49] Samson picked up a jawbone. David took a
[2:03:51] sling. I don't I I don't care what it
[2:03:53] was. It wouldn't matter me if it's a
[2:03:55] jawbone or a rock. It was just whatever
[2:03:57] Samson would put in his hand. That's how
[2:03:58] he overcame the enemy because he was
[2:04:00] anointed of God to overcome. And when
[2:04:02] you get a revelation that you're an
[2:04:04] anointed overcomer, it don't matter what
[2:04:05] God put in your hand. You could be
[2:04:08] completely broke and not have two things
[2:04:09] to put together, but if you're anointed
[2:04:11] of God to overcome, then whatever God
[2:04:13] gave you is what you'll overcome with.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that whatever is laying in
[2:04:18] your path, you'll overcome with it. I
[2:04:20] believe that this morning. You love the
[2:04:21] Lord tonight.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just appreciate the Lord. And
[2:04:25] Amen. We just want to invite the youth
[2:04:28] uh this Saturday between 6:00 and 8:00
[2:04:30] p.m. to the fellowship hall. We're going
[2:04:32] to have a meeting with the young people.
[2:04:35] I'll be there. Brother Brian be there as
[2:04:37] well. We're going to have some food and
[2:04:38] everything. We'll feed all all the young
[2:04:40] people and have something special there
[2:04:43] uh in store for all the youth. It
[2:04:45] doesn't matter uh the ages. If you bring
[2:04:47] kids that are under 10 years old, please
[2:04:49] accompany them and sit by them and and
[2:04:51] join in with them and have a wonderful
[2:04:53] time. But if they're uh but if they're
[2:04:56] over 10, you can drop them off and we'll
[2:04:58] we'll take it from there. But if they're
[2:04:59] under 10, uh just be right there with
[2:05:01] them and just enjoy the the youth
[2:05:03] service. So, we just want to make it
[2:05:05] enjoyable uh and be able to allow the
[2:05:07] Lord uh to be able to come. So, just
[2:05:10] want to invite everybody for that. Also,
[2:05:14] um tonight we're going to have some
[2:05:15] fellowship in the fellowship hall. If
[2:05:16] anybody'd like to stick around uh for
[2:05:18] that, we certainly would enjoy uh the
[2:05:21] time of fellowship. So, let's just bow
[2:05:23] our heads together and Amen. just I
[2:05:26] trust everybody's all their hearts and
[2:05:28] minds are clear and enjoy the presence
[2:05:30] of the Lord tonight. And amen. And I
[2:05:32] believe that every service that we come
[2:05:34] to, we can we can find things that we
[2:05:36] don't like about it, but it don't
[2:05:37] matter. I've never been in a church
[2:05:38] service that if you want to be critical,
[2:05:40] you couldn't find something to be
[2:05:41] critical about. But I know that I've
[2:05:43] never been in a church service one that
[2:05:45] I couldn't find something that God had
[2:05:47] said or done or or spoke something to
[2:05:49] me. And I just choose to take what God
[2:05:51] gives me. Uh you know, and I take the
[2:05:53] prescription, allow myself to be able to
[2:05:56] grow and be encouraged in the word of
[2:05:57] God. So let's just bow our heads
[2:05:59] together. Our gracious heavenly father,
[2:06:01] Lord, we just thank you, Lord, tonight,
[2:06:03] Lord, for the word of God. And Lord, we
[2:06:06] thank you for a word of encouragement,
[2:06:07] Lord. We thank you for our brother just
[2:06:09] pouring his heart out to the church. And
[2:06:11] Lord, I just pray that you would give
[2:06:12] him a special blessing tonight. Lord, I
[2:06:14] pray you'd give him strength. Lord, that
[2:06:16] we would be able to come back Sunday.
[2:06:18] Lord, I pray that you would bring such
[2:06:20] an encouragement to each believer. Lord,
[2:06:22] I saw your hand in this service tonight,
[2:06:24] Lord, speaking to many situations, Lord,
[2:06:28] and the things that I I know that that
[2:06:30] are needed, Lord. And I just ask you,
[2:06:32] Lord, that they would find encouragement
[2:06:33] in your word. And Lord, may we go from
[2:06:36] this place rejoicing, Lord, knowing
[2:06:38] we've been in your presence, and we're
[2:06:39] careful, Lord, to give you the glory for
[2:06:41] all that's been done and said. We thank
[2:06:43] you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:06:46] Amen. God bless you tonight. Key of D.
[2:06:51] Well, I've
[2:06:53] got a feeling.
[2:06:55] Well, everything's going to be all
[2:06:58] right.
[2:06:59] Oh, I've
[2:07:02] got a feeling.
[2:07:05] Everything's going to be all right.
[2:07:09] Oh,
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:11] I've got this feeling.
[2:07:14] Everything's going to be all right.
[2:07:18] Be all right.
[2:07:21] be all right.
[2:07:23] Be all right.
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:29] Will God send Moses lead all his people
[2:07:32] out? Well, Pharaoh's heart was hardened.
[2:07:35] Thought he'd give them a new round. So,
[2:07:38] he chased them all down to that Red Sea
[2:07:42] shore. He thought he wouldn't have to
[2:07:45] worry about Moses anymore. But Moses
[2:07:48] stretched his rod out over the sea. And
[2:07:52] the Lord answered Moses with a little
[2:07:55] gentle breeze. I can see Moses now with
[2:07:59] a smile on his face. Just telling all
[2:08:03] the people with his gentle grace. Still
[2:08:07] I
[2:08:08] got this feeling
[2:08:11] everything's going to be all right.
[2:08:15] Oh, I
[2:08:18] got a feeling
[2:08:20] that everything's going to be all right.
[2:08:24] Oh, I
[2:08:27] got this feeling
[2:08:30] everything's going to be all right.
[2:08:34] Be all right.
[2:08:36] Be all right.
[2:08:39] Be all right.
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:44] Well, a little boy named David went out
[2:08:47] to fight a giant. And everybody laughed
[2:08:51] at such a funny little side. What a
[2:08:54] little shepherd boy. He was armed with a
[2:08:57] swing. And beside that great Goliath
[2:09:00] seemed such a puny little thing. But
[2:09:03] David said, "You come to me with spear
[2:09:06] and a sword." But I come to you in the
[2:09:10] name of the Lord. He put in a stone and
[2:09:15] he gave it a flame. And when he left his
[2:09:18] hand, well, David began to sing. Well, I
[2:09:24] got this feeling that everything's going
[2:09:27] to be all right.
[2:09:30] Oh, I've
[2:09:33] got a feeling
[2:09:35] that everything's going to be all right.
[2:09:40] Oh, I
[2:09:42] got a feeling
[2:09:45] everything's going to be all right.
[2:09:49] Be all right.
[2:09:51] Be all right.
[2:09:54] Be all right.
[2:09:59] Well, now for the greatest story of them
[2:10:03] all. My Jesus was a dying and they let a
[2:10:08] fall. Well, demons were rejoicing. They
[2:10:11] thought they'd won the war, but soon
[2:10:14] they would not be laughing anymore. So
[2:10:18] on that first Easter morning, when the
[2:10:21] sun woke up the earth and the caverns of
[2:10:24] the deep opened up to give birth to a
[2:10:28] resurrected Savior with healing in his
[2:10:31] wings. And now the horse of children
[2:10:35] arise and sing. Well, I've
[2:10:39] got a feeling
[2:10:41] everything's going to be all right.
[2:10:46] Oh, I've
[2:10:48] got this feeling that everything's going
[2:10:52] to be all right.
[2:10:55] Oh, I've
[2:10:58] got a feeling
[2:11:00] everything will be all right.
[2:11:04] Be all right.
[2:11:07] Be all right.
[2:11:09] Be all right.
