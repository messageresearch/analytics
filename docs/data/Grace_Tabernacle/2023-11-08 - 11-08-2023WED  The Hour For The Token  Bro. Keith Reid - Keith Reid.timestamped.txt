[39:23] while meeting your pastor for the first
[39:26] time I've heard have
[39:29] him and um mightbe some of you have
[39:32] heard of me amen but um it's good to be
[39:36] together with God's
[39:38] people because one thing we know for
[39:40] certain that the people who are here is
[39:44] the same ones we're going to spend
[39:45] eternity with amen and um you know we
[39:50] might come from different countries we
[39:52] have different accent we speak different
[39:55] language but we are one people we are
[39:57] the people of God Amen and there's one
[40:00] thing that bring us together it's not
[40:03] because of who we are but because of who
[40:05] he is amen we certainly thank God for
[40:08] the message of the hour I've met people
[40:11] who under normal circumstance there was
[40:14] no way our path should have crossed but
[40:17] because of God's grace amen and what he
[40:20] has done in this hour we've got one
[40:23] thing in common God has sent a prophet
[40:27] and we are the recipient of that voice
[40:30] of that seventh angel
[40:31] messenger amen so we greet you from our
[40:35] church spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle
[40:38] in lindstad Jamaica and from the
[40:41] ministers who are there both in our
[40:44] local church and those that are on the
[40:46] island Jamaica if you look on the map to
[40:49] see where Jamaica is you might miss it
[40:52] because it's just a little spot amen but
[40:56] when you get there you realize the spot
[40:58] is it doesn't look like a spot when
[41:00] you're standing there amen but we we're
[41:03] glad for amen the privilege to travel
[41:06] and to meet others and to share amen and
[41:10] my precious brother Joe reyolds who has
[41:12] been in our home and in our church and
[41:15] he's a mighty preacher amen and I I've
[41:18] got a chance of meeting Mighty Men of
[41:21] God in this time amen I thank God for
[41:25] the call
[41:26] I came around the message just about
[41:30] 1980 uh when I was still in high school
[41:33] and um you know got hooked on it in 1985
[41:38] when I got baptized by Brother Thomas
[41:41] Brady who had been around for so long
[41:44] the church day was established in the
[41:47] 60s but um a newcomer to all of that I
[41:51] never grew up in the message I grew up
[41:53] as a Baptist you know and we had a
[41:55] certain way and um Sometimes some of the
[41:58] ways of the people around the message
[42:01] I'm not catching to it because of my
[42:03] background but one thing I certainly
[42:05] know I love the people of God Amen I am
[42:08] not a fighter I a lover of the people
[42:13] amen and you know like they said
[42:15] sometimes they make a circle and they
[42:18] exclude you I just make a bigger Circle
[42:20] and ex include amen praise God because I
[42:24] can't determine who is going to make it
[42:28] and I'm not here to preach for those who
[42:31] not going to make it so I just preachers
[42:34] know everybody is going to make it amen
[42:37] I realize one thing this is not my bride
[42:41] this is Christ's bride and I'm really
[42:43] privileged to be able to speak to her uh
[42:47] think of it that God could have chosen
[42:50] any medium but God has chosen us Amen to
[42:54] prepare that bride
[42:56] for that Rapture and so I'm glad to have
[42:59] my wife traveling with
[43:01] me we have two daughters and um they are
[43:04] grown you know um they're no longer
[43:07] children they're now living in Canada so
[43:10] we kind of live
[43:12] alone amen praise God but we we thank
[43:15] God for all things and um we want to
[43:17] look at the word of God tonight I
[43:19] realize that this church is a very young
[43:22] church amen started just a few years ago
[43:26] amen but I thank God for amen when you
[43:28] started you feel the fire Amen to press
[43:32] on you know I I realized they said this
[43:36] was a little Barn there and so but I
[43:39] look at the beautiful assemble that you
[43:41] have put together amen because you have
[43:44] your heart in all of that and may God
[43:47] bless you amen and may you stay strong
[43:50] and may God send others of like Precious
[43:53] Faith to worship god with you am amen I
[43:57] believe that there was a message for
[43:58] yesterday and there's a message for
[44:01] today amen I believe that you know
[44:04] brother Brandon was here and people said
[44:06] that well if we were back there when the
[44:08] prophet was here what it would have been
[44:11] I believe that this is a greater day
[44:14] because we are closer to our Redemption
[44:16] than we were yesterday and many that was
[44:20] back then and they sit and they heard
[44:22] the message preached back then they had
[44:24] no understanding of what was happening
[44:27] but today there's a greater light that
[44:30] is shining Among Us amen and uh uh we
[44:34] are young and we have never seen the
[44:36] days of the prophet and we have never
[44:39] met the man but hallelujah we're going
[44:42] to carry on the fire until Jesus appear
[44:46] amen praise God so stand on your feet um
[44:49] I'd like you to turn your Bibles to AGI
[44:53] chapter 2 or you call it it ay I don't
[44:57] know the way you pronounce it amen but
[45:00] chapter 2 this was the returning to Zion
[45:07] and the rebuilding of the temple under
[45:11] zerubabel and Ezra and nemiah each had
[45:16] their portion to do what a great
[45:20] template was when Solomon had built it
[45:22] and dedicated and the glory of the Lord
[45:25] came down but when it was fall in ruin
[45:31] and it was to be
[45:33] reestablished you know it speaks of the
[45:36] Endtime bride coming in preview of the
[45:40] word of God and the portion that we are
[45:44] to take you know we're here for a
[45:46] purpose don't let nobody fool you amen
[45:50] we're here for a purpose and the purpose
[45:52] of the Bride today is greater than those
[45:56] of our forefathers that forrun us really
[46:01] with the message of the hour so let's
[46:03] just bow our heads as we look to the
[46:05] word of God
[46:07] tonight our gracious God and our
[46:10] father Lord we thank you God for this

[48:54] place will I give peace said the Lord of
[48:58] host may the Lord that his
[49:00] Blessing reading of the
[49:04] word tonight I'd like to speak on the
[49:08] how for the
[49:12] token you know in the first Exodus the
[49:16] token was
[49:17] required in other words they could not
[49:20] move forward without the
[49:23] token I read from the message toen
[49:26] 1963 brother BM said it's been the lamb
[49:29] all the way through it was a lamb in
[49:32] Luther's time it was the lamb in Wesley
[49:35] time but now is token
[49:38] time that each house must be covered by
[49:42] the token Hallelujah each house of God
[49:46] must be covered by the token and all
[49:49] that's inside of it must be covered by
[49:51] the token and the house of God is a body
[49:55] of Jesus Christ aren't you in it tonight
[49:58] and by one Spirit we're all baptized
[50:02] into the token because am me become part
[50:06] of it that God said when I see the token
[50:10] display Hallelujah I will pass over you
[50:15] and he said what an hour that we're in
[50:19] now what an hour the hour of the token
[50:24] you know hear it was let me take it back
[50:26] from the time of uh
[50:29] Egypt when they were under
[50:32] captivity by
[50:34] Pharaoh but God had a promise in that
[50:39] people and if God say it's got to come
[50:42] to pass I don't care what happened if
[50:45] God say itth you can rest upon that word
[50:48] uh because that word cannot fail is a
[50:51] right amen and here it is they come to a
[50:54] time where Hallelujah you can imagine
[50:56] they get
[50:57] complacent in the things that are
[50:59] happening around them but God was not
[51:03] complacent God knows the hour the moment
[51:07] he's going to move them out hallelujah
[51:10] amen here it is uh we can look back at
[51:12] the old Patriarchs of all amen like Ezra
[51:15] who was a priest on Amen I love the
[51:17] story of nemiah the king CA Hallelujah

[51:41] never bear Hebrew names because uh am
[51:43] mean they were mixing with the itats and
[51:45] the jebat and am mean and all of that
[51:48] and am mean there was a drifting away
[51:50] from uh amen the central part of what
[51:52] God gave to them amen but there there
[51:55] was that day when oh the king gave them
[51:58] leave uh you can go back into your
[52:00] Homeland uh amen and you know there was
[52:03] those who were Prosper amen there and

[52:40] I'll compare you with today amen it was
[52:43] a vision amen that AI had from God uh
[52:46] amen that the day that we're living is a
[52:49] great day hallelujah amen you think that

[53:30] the message of the hour we've seen many
[53:33] drifting off uh amen many Falling Away
[53:36] uh amen but this is the greatest day uh
[53:38] amen that you have ever seen uh where
[53:40] the word of God is coming into
[53:44] Power amen we're not dwelling on the
[53:48] essence of yesterday amen though those
[53:51] things were good uh amen but there's a
[53:53] greater reality uh amen that we are in
[53:56] today uh amen that God is preparing us
[53:59] uh amen not for a long haul uh amen but
[54:01] there must be a quick uh powerful
[54:03] message uh to sweep across the Brad uh
[54:06] am me to lift up us uh am me into the
[54:09] Mount Zion Rapture
[54:11] Showdown Hallelujah am me you know

[54:20] the mechanics uh amen yes the people
[54:22] dress right uh amen there's no mixed
[54:24] mask Mar you don't cut your hair amen
[54:27] and all these things we baptize uh in
[54:29] the name of the Lord Jesus uh amen and
[54:31] we're just message people amen we
[54:33] believe that God sent us a prophet uh
[54:35] amen and he has gone off the scene uh
[54:37] amen and we continue just like that uh
[54:40] amen but I want to tell you the prophet
[54:41] said uh in that message why Christ speak
[54:44] uh he said no church uh in its practice
[54:48] no matter fundamental or intellectual
[54:51] that church might be he said that church
[54:54] cannot strive
[54:55] until the
[54:57] Supernatural is made known among the
[55:00] people amen and I want to bring you up
[55:02] to that spot tonight uh amen that we're
[55:04] not just a church uh for the mechanics
[55:07] uh but we are a church for the dynamic
[55:09] power of the Holy Ghost uh are you there
[55:12] with somebody amen and for this reason
[55:14] the prophet preach uh amen the statue of

[55:22] uh amen many of you have been here for
[55:24] so long uh you said this not what I was

[55:29] but God is calling us to order amen that
[55:32] he call us for a purpose uh amen not
[55:34] just that we are Justified uh or that we
[55:37] are Sanctified uh amen but that I know
[55:39] that I've bet uh amen the pillar of fire
[55:42] that may I say to you tonight uh it
[55:44] doesn't matter where you are who you are
[55:46] uh you cannot really fulfill uh amen
[55:49] God's purpose uh until the supernatural
[55:52] power of the Holy Ghost uh amen come and
[55:55] dwell within your heart uh amen
[55:57] sometimes we take uh amen a mental
[55:59] conception uh of the Holy Ghost oh do
[56:02] you believe uh amen that brother brand
[56:04] is a prophet oh yes I believe uh amen oh
[56:06] yes my children believe uh amen they are
[56:08] filled with the Holy Ghost uh amen for
[56:10] they believe the message but it takes
[56:12] more than that is that right uh it takes
[56:16] an Awakening uh it takes a fire amen of
[56:20] God not a painted fire of yesterday uh
[56:23] amen but something today amen that is
[56:25] real uh amen I want a more of God uh in
[56:29] my heart today uh and if there's a more
[56:31] of God uh amen that I can cry to me
[56:34] there's a more of God for me to receive
[56:37] uh am mean what it is uh it's a deep
[56:39] calling uh unto a deep uh and if a deep
[56:42] call uh there's got to be a deep to
[56:44] respond uh are you there with me uh amen
[56:47] I just don't want an anointing uh amen I
[56:49] just don't want a feeling uh I just
[56:51] don't want an head knowledge uh amen
[56:53] that I've read the book uh I can quote
[56:55] the quotes uh no sir but I need uh amen

[1:35:04] healing service and that was the only
[1:35:07] part of the book that he read because
[1:35:09] that's the only part that appealed to
[1:35:12] him you see that don't put you in the
[1:35:15] message no because signs and wonders
[1:35:19] catch the unbeliever but the message of
[1:35:22] the hour will positionally place the
[1:35:25] believer in Jesus
[1:35:27] Christ amen

[1:36:13] according to Malachi 4 to turn the art
[1:36:17] of the children back to the apostolic
[1:36:20] fathers that's one that's Malachi 4 but

[1:37:45] Christ that Christ might have
[1:37:48] preeminence and if Christ don't don't

[1:54:24] heart amen is that your prayer tonight
[1:54:27] amen how many you say the Lord spoke to
[1:54:29] your heart tonight amen the hour of the
[1:54:32] token I think God's trying to tell us
[1:54:35] something and I I know brother Keith
[1:54:37] hadn't this is the first time he's here
[1:54:39] so I know he hadn't been here the last
[1:54:40] two Sundays so it's first time is this
[1:54:43] first time y'all saw him and but uh if
[1:54:46] he didn't come in start speaking about
[1:54:47] the token and and I don't know if y'all
[1:54:50] remember this Sunday morning but uh we
[1:54:52] had spoke to preached on it the last
[1:54:54] Sunday and spoke on it the first the
[1:54:57] next Sunday of how important it was to
[1:55:00] display the token remember when Rahab
[1:55:03] went in and she took what had changed in
[1:55:05] her life and she displayed it and and I
[1:55:07] believe that's what God is calling the
[1:55:09] bride to do is to display the token amen
[1:55:12] friends I I I really believe it the
[1:55:14] display of the token is a Vindication
[1:55:16] that you received the message that the
[1:55:18] preacher was preaching amen that's what
[1:55:20] message was brought to her it's a
[1:55:21] Vindication that she received the
[1:55:23] message amen I I thank God that we have
[1:55:26] people today that have that displaying
[1:55:28] in their life the very life of Jesus
[1:55:30] Christ displaying in you it's just
[1:55:33] there's nothing less than that that's
[1:55:35] the call of God in this hour is to
[1:55:37] display the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:55:39] and I sure appreciate our brother and
[1:55:41] just pouring out his heart and and is
[1:55:43] going to be around with us for a few
[1:55:45] days and I know we have the um the uh uh
[1:55:49] what are we the festival the Fall
[1:55:52] Festival on Saturday and uh and so look
[1:55:55] forward to that and I know a lot of the
[1:55:58] sisters that are come together to help
[1:56:00] make that happen sure appreciate that
[1:56:02] and and uh and the brothers doing some
[1:56:05] some labor and and I thank I thank God
[1:56:08] for a good brother that comes in there
[1:56:10] and talks about doing the work of the
[1:56:12] Lord amen I think sometimes people
[1:56:13] forget that doing the Lord's work takes
[1:56:16] work but you know it takes work and
[1:56:18] sometimes it just you have to fight
[1:56:20] through things and we have to struggle
[1:56:21] through feelings and problems that we're
[1:56:23] going through at work and and family
[1:56:25] trouble and all this we have to fight
[1:56:27] through that to do the Lord's work it
[1:56:28] takes work but I believe that God has
[1:56:31] called us to it and if he and he gave
[1:56:33] you the strength isn't that something
[1:56:35] the brother said he said the he quoted
[1:56:37] that scripture he said that the people
[1:56:39] that know their God shall be strong the
[1:56:41] Bible called for us to be strong in work
[1:56:43] and if you don't have the strength to do
[1:56:45] the work of the lord well know your God
[1:56:47] it gives you it gives you strength
[1:56:49] strength amen the people that know their
[1:56:51] God shall be strong I just uh just look
[1:56:53] forward to uh the weekend and all that
[1:56:56] God has in store for us so uh maybe I
[1:57:00] just want to encourage you to invite
[1:57:02] friends and family and and those out to
[1:57:05] to the festival and I know we're um you
[1:57:07] know it's a time of fellowship and
[1:57:09] enjoyment but uh there's nothing that
[1:57:11] are done on these grounds that aren't
[1:57:13] for the purpose of the furtherance of
[1:57:15] the Gospel so in our fun and our
[1:57:17] enjoyment it'll be a an opportunity
[1:57:19] maybe to uh meet some people that we
[1:57:21] haven't met and so uh that's that's what
[1:57:24] I that's what I see in it anyway so uh
[1:57:26] just a time of fellowship with one
[1:57:28] another and maybe uh bring some people
[1:57:30] out and let them just enjoy a good
[1:57:32] Christian good clean Christian fun and
[1:57:35] uh just to be around the saints of God
[1:57:37] Amen and how many's looking forward to
[1:57:39] that amen so I think brother they they
[1:57:41] they've done uh uh bride brother Keith

[1:57:47] for the for the Chile contest so uh I I
[1:57:51] have to to be fair I'm just a person of
[1:57:54] fairness I have to disclose something
[1:57:56] that I heard today and and in order to
[1:57:59] be fair because I'm the only one that
[1:58:01] heard it and I I may have said it to one
[1:58:03] of the people that are that are cooking
[1:58:05] chili and so I have to make sure I
