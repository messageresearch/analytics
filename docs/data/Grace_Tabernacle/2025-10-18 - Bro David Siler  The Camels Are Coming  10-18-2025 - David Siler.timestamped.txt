[26:40] [Music]
[26:44] [Applause]
[27:26] Just really quick before I sing this
[27:29] song,
[27:31] a lot of you have probably heard me sing
[27:33] a lot
[27:35] yesterday
[27:42] and we didn't know why. He just stopped
[27:45] being able to walk and
[27:48] he crawled on his arms into the
[27:51] emergency room until I could meet him
[27:53] there and they found a tumor
[27:58] above his kidney and we had no clue it
[28:01] was there. They said they would have
[28:03] never found it.
[28:06] And we went a couple weeks later and we
[28:08] found out that that was not just a
[28:10] tumor, but it was a
[28:14] type of cancer tumor called a
[28:17] fiochromocyto
[28:19] and that it needed to come out right
[28:20] away and there was a problem with that
[28:24] because I was scheduled exactly one week
[28:27] later for brain surgery. So I went ahead
[28:29] and had my brain surgery
[28:32] and we had one failed surgery attempt.
[28:35] He was on 26 pills a day to keep him
[28:37] alive.
[28:41] We went in for surgery. They were able
[28:43] to remove the tumor and then he died on
[28:46] us three times.
[28:49] And I told the Lord, I said, "If you
[28:50] will let me keep my very best friend, I
[28:53] promise I will testify of your goodness
[28:56] and your grace."
[28:58] And they told us there was no chance of
[29:00] it being cancerous. They said, "Out of
[29:02] the one in a million, only one in 10 are
[29:04] everice
[29:10] was diagnosed with a 10 million type of
[29:13] cancer. So rare nobody in the United
[29:16] States had ever treated it on a live
[29:18] person.
[29:20] But here we are nine months later.
[29:24] He's passed his first scan. The cancer
[29:27] cells that were left behind are not
[29:29] growing. And we go in just a few weeks
[29:32] for another six month scan. And we're
[29:34] believing that we're still going to be
[29:35] cancerree.
[29:37] [Applause]
[29:47] [Music]
[30:03] Standing in the middle of the
[30:11] There's no way of knowing what comes
[30:17] [Music]

[33:21] are conable.

[47:47] this mortal body, I'll give it to my
[47:49] Lord tonight. And he's worthy of it
[47:50] all."
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord. I mean, say
[47:54] it's certainly good to be in the house
[47:56] of God. Amen. Turn around, shake

[48:00] the house of the Lord. Amen.
[48:03] Bible says, I was glad when they said

[48:07] Lord. Amen. We come tonight in great
[48:10] expectation
[48:12] of a move of God. And certainly

[48:18] and been such a tremendous meeting thus
[48:22] far. and started there with brother
[48:24] Andrew and just made a great just a
[48:28] great call to the faith of the believers
[48:31] and brother Jonathan right behind him
[48:34] and then brother Wayne last night and
[48:36] had a wonderful message about the great
[48:39] high priest that could be touched by the
[48:42] feeling of our infirmities. What good is
[48:43] a high priest if you couldn't touch him?
[48:46] Isn't that wonderful? But he can be
[48:47] touched. Amen. And many was touched last
[48:50] night. How many lift your hand as a
[48:52] testimony that you touch the hem of his
[48:54] garment? Amen. God is certainly uh doing
[48:57] a lot among his children. And uh we have
[49:00] with us tonight uh Pastor David Siler
[49:03] from Manchester, Tennessee. And we many
[49:07] of us that grew up with brother David in
[49:10] this area and God certainly used him
[49:13] around the world and and called him into
[49:16] the pastor there and some of the
[49:18] congregations. So, we want to welcome
[49:20] y'all uh tonight and just know that God
[49:22] is going to use our brother tonight. How
[49:24] many pulled from a gift of God? And
[49:26] Amen. I just want to say before we have

[49:33] meeting. They've been wonderful. How
[49:34] many's been enjoying those seniors and

[49:42] also also want to recognize our
[49:45] musicians and they've been so gracious
[49:47] to labor each service. God bless y'all
[49:49] and and the playing and
[49:52] Amen. You couldn't it'd be a different
[49:54] kind of meeting without that. Amen. So,
[49:56] we certainly appreciate that. And and
[49:58] also our our sisters and those that have
[50:01] been working in the fellowship hall and
[50:03] uh making sure that we had uh food to

[50:41] remember Sister Tammy having really bad
[50:44] headaches uh to today. Also, uh Jordan
[50:47] had called me before service and they're
[50:50] not letting her get out of the bed, but
[50:51] she said that she was doing good and and
[50:53] wish she was here." So, we just uh glad
[50:56] everything is uh going good and want to
[50:59] continue to remember her. My dad had
[51:01] asked for prayer today and uh and was
[51:03] sick in his body. So, any uh any needs
[51:06] tonight, won't you just lift your hand
[51:07] to the Lord? And I know we have
[51:09] testimonies from last night already and
[51:12] heard the sister giving a testimony
[51:13] about what God had done for her family a
[51:16] while ago. And so I I know God is
[51:18] certainly more than able. So why don't
[51:20] we just ask him to come? If you have a
[51:22] need on your heart and and uh just just
[51:26] trust the Lord. Brother Seth, would you
[51:28] pray over these requests for us tonight?
[51:33] [Music]
[51:35] Lord, we love you. Lord, we thank you
[51:38] for what you're doing for us, Lord, in
[51:39] these services.
[51:41] Lord, we ask that you go, Father, Lord,
[51:43] to each and every need, Lord, to each
[51:45] and every individual, Lord. And Lord,
[51:47] whatever situation it is, Father, that
[51:49] they're going through, Lord, we ask that
[51:51] you minister to it tonight, Lord, and
[51:52] bring them through it, Father. Lord,
[51:55] those that are sick and body, Lord, we
[51:56] ask that you touch them, Father. Lord,
[51:58] heal their body, Lord. Lord, and let it
[52:00] be a testimony, Father. And Lord, we
[52:03] ask, Father, Lord, as a minister comes
[52:05] out this evening, Lord, that you just
[52:07] move him out of the way, Father. And
[52:09] Lord, allow us, Father, as a
[52:10] congregation, Lord, to move ourselves
[52:13] out of the way, Lord, that we can pull
[52:15] from the gift of God, Lord. And we ask
[52:17] that you keep us in your perfect will,
[52:19] Lord, in this service now. We ask these
[52:21] things in the name of Jesus Christ.
[52:24] Amen.
[52:28] Amen. How many's ready to hear the word?
[52:30] Amen. I said, "How many's ready to hear
[52:32] the word?" Amen. You know, while we
[52:34] come, we love the word of God. Come out
[52:36] in the middle of a storm and rain and
[52:39] because we love to be fed by the word of
[52:41] God. And and we got to be indoors. So,
[52:43] we thank God for that. Amen. And if we
[52:45] staying out there, we'd be singing,
[52:47] "Wait in the water." But we're in here
[52:50] and we're going to wait in another kind
[52:51] of water. Amen. And I I want to just
[52:53] wait all the way in and get just
[52:55] completely soaked in the presence of the
[52:57] Holy Ghost tonight. Amen. So, we just
[52:59] want to make the Lord welcome and maybe
[53:01] we just sing this song as we uh ask
[53:04] Brother David to come and take the
[53:06] platform.
[53:07] You deserve the glory
[53:12] and the honor.

[53:31] Lord. I lift my hands to worship,
[53:35] to magnify your name. For you are great.

[53:45] There's no one else like you.
[53:50] There is no one else like you. You are
[53:54] great.
[53:56] You do miracles so great.
[53:59] There is no one else like you.
[54:05] There is no one else like you.

[54:13] the glory
[54:16] and the honor.
[54:18] So Lord, I lift my voice to worship,
[54:24] to magnify your name. You deserve the
[54:28] glory

[54:39] praise your holy name. You are great.
[54:44] You do miracles so great.
[54:48] There is no one else like you.
[54:53] There is no one else like you. You are
[54:57] great. You do miracles to the great.
[55:02] There is no one else like you.
[55:08] There is no one else like you.
[55:14] [Music]
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts now and ask
[55:19] him just to come and speak to us from
[55:21] his word.
[55:24] Lord, we are so honored to be able to be
[55:26] here this evening.
[55:28] There's just something about your people
[55:30] when they gather together and we come
[55:34] together, Lord, believers and believing
[55:37] your word. And there's something about
[55:39] Lord that whenever believers get
[55:41] together,
[55:42] Lord, there there's a great atmosphere
[55:44] that Lord is a make you welcome to come
[55:48] to take the utmost seat in this place
[55:51] tonight. And Lord, we've come, Lord, not
[55:53] to even hear from ma'am, but we come to
[55:56] hear from you. knowing, Lord, that when
[55:58] you come by, you never disappoint. Great
[56:01] things always take place when you come
[56:03] by. So, we're looking to you tonight,
[56:06] Lord. And Father, may your presence
[56:09] never grow common to us. But Lord, I ask
[56:12] that, Lord, that we could just fall
[56:14] deeper in love with you, deeper than
[56:15] what we ever have. And we look to you
[56:18] tonight, Lord, ask that you would just
[56:20] move amongst us, Lord. That you would
[56:22] just take your Lord, as it was, the
[56:24] bread of life. May you break it, I pray,
[56:26] Lord.
[56:27] Lord, that whenever you was walking down
[56:29] the road and Lord, after the
[56:31] resurrection, Lord, I hear the prophet
[56:34] say, you stopped at that little
[56:35] restaurant and you went inside and it
[56:38] was the way that you took the bread into
[56:40] your hands and as you begin to break the
[56:43] bread, as you'd done many times before,
[56:46] the Bible said their eyes come open. So,
[56:49] we ask tonight, Lord, take the bread
[56:51] into your hands. break it to us tonight,
[56:53] Lord, and we'll be so careful to give
[56:55] you the praise in the name of the Lord
[56:58] Jesus Christ. And everybody said,
[57:00] "Amen." Amen. God bless you this
[57:03] evening. So honored to be with you in
[57:06] the house of the Lord tonight. And and
[57:08] we are we are grateful to be able to be
[57:11] to be in here. Um, but you know, I got
[57:14] to thinking about this in the back room
[57:15] that at one time the tent in the
[57:18] tabernacle in the wilderness was a great
[57:19] thing. But they finally went from the
[57:22] tent over into the temple. And so we've
[57:25] just made a great transition.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You don't even know it, but you've been
[57:28] in a dispositional change. And so we're
[57:31] glad to be in the house of the Lord. The
[57:32] rain may come, but it don't stop us.
[57:34] We'll just keep right on going. Amen.
[57:36] God bless you. We want to say certainly
[57:38] appreciate brother Matt allowing us to
[57:40] come to be a part of the meeting. I just
[57:42] love brother Matt and appreciate him so
[57:44] much and we've been buddies for for many
[57:46] of years and and so we're not not just
[57:48] family but real friends and I certainly
[57:51] appreciate what the Lord has done here
[57:53] in this place and how that the the Lord
[57:55] is just well he does great things and u
[57:58] you know the prophet said that one man
[58:00] in the hand of God all God needs is one
[58:02] person
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and look what God can do and so we want
[58:05] to say we appreciate him and also I
[58:08] would like to recognize his wife sister
[58:09] Sarah um I I know that it's not an easy
[58:13] job because being a pastor's wife and
[58:15] bear he bears a load and she's going to
[58:17] bear the load. And we want to say God
[58:19] bless you. Thank you for all your
[58:20] efforts and the struggles and I know how
[58:23] it is. You worry about making sure the
[58:24] meeting's right and everything is is
[58:26] going to be taken care of and uh and you
[58:28] just wanted to go off without a hitch
[58:30] and and you've done that. You've
[58:31] accomplished it. We want to say how much
[58:33] we appreciate you, Sister Sarah and
[58:35] brother Matt. Amen.
[58:43] Uh, I'm honored to be one of the
[58:45] ministers to be able to come after
[58:46] hearing everything we heard last night.
[58:48] I thought we just thought, well, they
[58:49] preached everything there is to preach.
[58:51] Uh, so I thought we'd just kind of go
[58:52] back to the maps and go across them
[58:54] tonight in the back of the Bible. But
[58:56] let's go to the book of Genesis, chapter
[58:58] 24. Genesis chapter 24. We'd like to
[59:01] look at verse at verse 10. We'll just
[59:03] read down a few verses of scripture to
[59:05] give you this setting to get everybody
[59:07] on the same page for what we're going to
[59:09] speak on this evening. This is Genesis
[59:12] 24, of course, where um the servant
[59:14] Eleazar is going to get um a bride for
[59:17] Isaac and uh he's been commissioned to
[59:20] be able to go. And the Bible says, "And
[59:22] the servant took 10 camels of the camels
[59:26] of his master and he departed for all
[59:28] the goods of his master were in his
[59:30] hand. And he arose and went to
[59:32] Mesopotamia unto the city of Nahor. And
[59:36] he made his camels to kneel down without
[59:38] the city by a well of water at the time
[59:42] of the evening.
[59:44] And in the evening, listen this, even
[59:47] the time that women go out to draw
[59:50] water. And a woman of the scripture we
[59:51] know is a type of the church. So great
[59:54] things happen at Wales. And here he is
[59:57] in the evening time when the women go
[59:59] out to draw water. Verse 12. And he
[1:00:01] said, "Oh Lord, God of my master
[1:00:03] Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
[1:00:07] this day. Show me kindness unto my
[1:00:11] master Abraham." And behold, I stand
[1:00:13] here by the well of water. Listen to
[1:00:15] this servant's prayer. I stand here by
[1:00:17] the well of water, and the daughters of
[1:00:20] the men of the city come out to draw
[1:00:21] water. And I and let it come to pass.
[1:00:25] Let it come to pass that the damel to
[1:00:29] whom I shall say, now watch, it's going
[1:00:32] to run twofold. He's got to do his part,
[1:00:35] but she's got to do her part.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; The dames I shall say, let down thy
[1:00:40] picture, I pray thee, that I may drink.
[1:00:42] And she shall say, Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; She's going to have to find her voice.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And she shall say, drink. and I will
[1:00:51] give the camel&lt;unk&gt;s drink also. Let the
[1:00:53] same be she that thou hast appointed for
[1:00:56] thy servant Isaac, and thereby shall I
[1:00:58] know that thou hast showed kindness unto
[1:01:00] my master. And it came to pass before he
[1:01:03] had done speaking. Hallelujah. That
[1:01:06] behold, Rebecca came out, who was born
[1:01:09] to Bethl, son of Mila, the wife of
[1:01:12] Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her
[1:01:15] picture upon her shoulder. She's already
[1:01:18] got what she needs to fulfill the word.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And the damsel was very fair to look
[1:01:24] upon and a virgin. Neither had any man
[1:01:26] known her. And she went up down to the
[1:01:28] well rather and filled her picture and
[1:01:30] came up. And the servant ran to meet her
[1:01:32] and said, "Let me, I pray thee, drink a
[1:01:35] little water of thy picture." And she
[1:01:39] said, "Who do you think you are?"
[1:01:42] And she said, "Drinkle,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; my Lord,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; and watch the Bible." She hastened.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; She's not trying to get slow and
[1:01:53] allowing things just to go. She hastened
[1:01:55] and let down her pitcher upon her hand
[1:01:57] and gave him drink. And when she had
[1:01:59] done giving him drink, she said, "I will
[1:02:01] draw water for thy camels also, until
[1:02:05] they are done drinking."
[1:02:08] And she hastened and emptied her pitch
[1:02:11] into the trough and ran again unto the
[1:02:13] well to draw water and drew for all his
[1:02:18] camels. I'd like to speak tonight. The
[1:02:20] Lord help us on the camels are coming.
[1:02:24] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[1:02:25] word. You can be seated.
[1:02:34] We know that the Old Testament is a
[1:02:38] shadow of the New. And we know that
[1:02:41] because of the way that God has pinned
[1:02:45] the word that
[1:02:47] God a lot of times when he wants to say
[1:02:50] something in the Old Testament that God
[1:02:52] will not just come right out and say
[1:02:55] what is on his mind. But remember when
[1:02:57] brother preached the message Christ the
[1:02:59] mystery of God revealed he said that God
[1:03:02] would actually hide it in the people's
[1:03:04] lives and he tells us when it comes to
[1:03:08] the story of redemption that the story
[1:03:10] of redemption is something that God has
[1:03:13] actually hid in the Old Testament. And
[1:03:16] we know that the mystery of every part
[1:03:18] of redemption truly lays in the Old
[1:03:21] Testament. And we know that things that
[1:03:24] is been spoken about in this day that's
[1:03:27] going to come to pass. Things that's
[1:03:29] going to actually be manifested in this
[1:03:31] day has actually been spoken about
[1:03:33] already in the Old Testament. You
[1:03:36] remember in the seventh seal that the
[1:03:38] prophet tells us, he says that the
[1:03:39] seventh seal is spoken all the way back
[1:03:43] into the book of Genesis. And he said,
[1:03:45] "If I had time to be able to go into it,
[1:03:48] I will show you how that the seventh
[1:03:50] seal is even spoken about plumbed back
[1:03:52] in the book of Genesis." So then the
[1:03:55] seventh seal, which we know the prophet
[1:03:57] tells us is the coming of the Lord. It's
[1:03:59] the rapture of the bride, was actually
[1:04:02] something that was spoken plumbed back
[1:04:04] into the book of Genesis. And brother
[1:04:06] tells us whenever you deal with Genesis,
[1:04:08] he says that Genesis is the seed book of
[1:04:11] the Bible. So whatever is upon the earth
[1:04:14] today has already been planted in the
[1:04:17] book of Genesis by the manifestation of
[1:04:20] seed that had went into the earth. So
[1:04:22] Genesis being the seed book of the
[1:04:24] Bible, we know that God actually swed
[1:04:27] the seed of the seventh seal all the way
[1:04:30] back in the book of Genesis. And God
[1:04:33] sold it at that time because he knew
[1:04:35] there would be a day that if the seed
[1:04:37] was going to be sowed into the field
[1:04:40] that there would come a day that there
[1:04:41] would be a manifestation of that seed
[1:04:44] which had been sold. And we believe that
[1:04:46] today because we are living in the hour
[1:04:49] of the harvest time that every biblical
[1:04:52] type, every shadow that was of the Old
[1:04:55] Testament has got to come to
[1:04:56] manifestation in the day that we're
[1:04:58] living in now. As a matter of fact,
[1:05:01] every scriptural type has got to be
[1:05:03] manifest in the day that we're living
[1:05:05] now. Because remember, there is no more
[1:05:08] ages to come. There's not going to be
[1:05:10] another age that's going to raise up and
[1:05:13] then another messenger and go back
[1:05:14] through the cycle of church ages. We
[1:05:16] have come to the climax, the claremont
[1:05:19] of everything that the Bible has talked
[1:05:21] about. We have made it to the finality
[1:05:24] of everything that God has promised.
[1:05:26] There is no more days to come. There is
[1:05:29] no Listen, there's not another hour to
[1:05:32] be able to wait and an hour to be able
[1:05:34] to play church and all. Oh, no. That
[1:05:36] time has come and gone. And I'll just
[1:05:39] remind you tonight, we are headed for
[1:05:41] the reign of the millennium. We are
[1:05:44] headed for the change of the body. And
[1:05:46] upon this earth, the Bible says there's
[1:05:48] going to be weeping and wailing and
[1:05:50] nashing of teeth. There is a decision
[1:05:52] that you're going to have to make. You
[1:05:54] cannot stay upon the earth. You cannot
[1:05:57] stay. Well, I'm a red-blooded American.
[1:05:59] You may be, but I want to tell you, you
[1:06:02] cannot remain in America because the
[1:06:04] last vision of America was in craters
[1:06:07] and ashes. You better get ready because
[1:06:10] you can't stay here. Wherever you go,
[1:06:13] you're not going to be able to stay
[1:06:15] here. It's because we're living in the
[1:06:17] harvest of all things. Now because it is
[1:06:20] the seed being sowed in the book of
[1:06:23] Genesis as we read it tonight out of the
[1:06:25] book of Genesis chapter 24 we know that
[1:06:28] Abraham's desire looking at Genesis 22
[1:06:31] whenever God would come as brother Wayne
[1:06:34] rather last night said it so beautifully
[1:06:36] how that God would come and not only
[1:06:37] make a promise but then bring that
[1:06:39] promise to pass and we know that the
[1:06:41] desire that lay within within Abraham
[1:06:44] was to have a promised son by the name
[1:06:47] of Isaac and he wanted that son to have
[1:06:49] a bride. And we know that that is a
[1:06:52] scriptural time that God was
[1:06:54] foreshadowing the last days that there
[1:06:56] would be a bride in the end time.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That there would be a people who
[1:07:01] would recognize their day. They would
[1:07:03] recognize the message. They would
[1:07:05] recognize the truth. They're not ashamed
[1:07:07] to say amen to it. They believe it with
[1:07:09] all of their heart. So God was actually
[1:07:12] writing the story of redemption in the
[1:07:15] life of Abraham. He wrote it in the life
[1:07:17] of Isaac. He wrote it in the life of
[1:07:20] Eleazar and he wrote it in the life of
[1:07:22] Rebecca. You believe that tonight? And
[1:07:24] we know that it is a mystery. And
[1:07:26] because it is a mystery, God's not going
[1:07:28] to come right out and tell Abraham.
[1:07:30] Abraham, let me tell you what you're
[1:07:31] doing. You're typing me. What you're
[1:07:34] doing, you're typing me. God doesn't
[1:07:36] tell Abraham that. He just leads
[1:07:38] Abraham. He directs Abraham and he hides
[1:07:40] the mystery of redemption in the man's
[1:07:42] life. So we can see the predestinated
[1:07:45] hand of God is actually in every part of
[1:07:48] this story that God has already spoken
[1:07:51] concerning many things that was going to
[1:07:53] come to pass in the day that we're
[1:07:54] living in now. And let me say this, we
[1:07:57] are living in that hour because not only
[1:07:59] is there a time to speak it, there's a
[1:08:01] time to manifest it. Do you realize the
[1:08:04] coming of Jesus, as brother Wayne
[1:08:05] brought it last night, the coming of
[1:08:07] Jesus was prophesied for 4,000 years. It
[1:08:10] was prophesied that Jesus would come and
[1:08:13] the Bible prophesied that a redeemer was
[1:08:15] going to come. He prophesied a
[1:08:18] resurrection was going to come. And then
[1:08:20] he prophesied there would be seven
[1:08:22] gentile ages that was going to come. And
[1:08:24] not only would there be seven gentile
[1:08:26] ages, there would be seven messengers of
[1:08:28] those ages which isn't prophesied in the
[1:08:30] scripture. But not only is the ages been
[1:08:33] prophesied about, but the people,
[1:08:35] Hallelujah, but the people that it makes
[1:08:38] up that age has been prophesied about it
[1:08:40] as well. And I want to say this, you've
[1:08:42] already been seen in the word.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; You've already been seen in the
[1:08:46] covenant. Your name has already been
[1:08:48] wrote in the book. And God is going to
[1:08:51] bring his word to pass. He don't ask
[1:08:53] you. He don't ask you what you think
[1:08:55] about it. He tells you what you're going
[1:08:57] to be. He said you're called. He didn't
[1:09:00] ask if you wanted to be. He said,
[1:09:02] "You're chosen. You're elected. You're
[1:09:03] predestinated." That's what God tells
[1:09:06] you. You don't tell God what you want to
[1:09:08] be. God tells you what you're going to
[1:09:10] be.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; We know when it comes to Genesis 22 that
[1:09:18] God had already spoken
[1:09:21] Abraham in his seed. And I know
[1:09:23] everybody has heard that that notice
[1:09:26] that God tells Abraham, he said, "You're
[1:09:28] going to have a seed. shall be the
[1:09:29] father of many nations. He's already
[1:09:31] promised that to Abraham. Amen. So,
[1:09:34] after 25 years, Abraham finally has his
[1:09:38] son.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wait a minute, brother David. I
[1:09:41] thought Abraham already had Ishmael.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, Abraham was not the
[1:09:47] father of Ishmael.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; No, Abram was the father
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; of Ishmael.
[1:09:56] Abraham, remember what God told him?
[1:09:59] Take thy son thine and only
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; because Isaac was the only covenant son
[1:10:07] that was identified by God. Remember
[1:10:10] what Ishmael Ishmael was a product of
[1:10:13] the flesh of Abram. It was not a son
[1:10:16] concerning the promise. It was not the
[1:10:18] one that was foreseen by God. It was
[1:10:20] Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Abraham only had one covenant
[1:10:26] son, and that son is Isaac. And now that
[1:10:30] God is going to prophesy through
[1:10:32] Abraham's life that he wants Abraham to
[1:10:35] take this promised son. Amen. Follow me
[1:10:37] now. And he wants him to take that
[1:10:39] promised son. And he's told him to go on
[1:10:42] a threeday journey. So, he takes Isaac.
[1:10:46] They go on a three-day journey. And upon
[1:10:48] this journey, he finally comes to this
[1:10:50] mountain. And God tells him that this is
[1:10:52] the promised place where he's supposed
[1:10:54] to come to. And Abraham takes Isaac on
[1:10:57] top of the mountain and he goes there
[1:10:59] with everything in him. He's fixing to
[1:11:01] slay Isaac. He's going to kill Isaac. As
[1:11:05] a matter of fact, remember the prophet
[1:11:07] said he tied Isaac down and he was
[1:11:09] getting ready to sacrifice him. And God
[1:11:11] said,"Abraham, Abraham, steady your
[1:11:14] hand." God told Abraham one time to do
[1:11:17] it, but he had to tell him twice to
[1:11:19] stop. Father, that's the way I want to
[1:11:21] be. That God can lead it and say it one
[1:11:23] time. He ain't got to beg me. He ain't
[1:11:26] got to twist my arm. All he's got to do
[1:11:28] is tell me one time. And Lord, if you
[1:11:30] change your will, tell me twice to stop,
[1:11:32] Lord.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; So he tells him, Abraham, Abraham,
[1:11:39] steady your hand. And the Bible says,
[1:11:41] "And the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:11:44] Abraham, and he said, by myself have I
[1:11:47] sworn, because thou hast done this
[1:11:49] thing, and thou hast not withheld thy
[1:11:51] son, thine only son."
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; So here is the father,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; and the father is willing to sacrifice
[1:11:59] his son.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the mystery of
[1:12:02] redemption.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; He was willing to sacrifice his son.
[1:12:05] Now, catch it. Isaac on a three-day
[1:12:07] journey. He's going to be sacrificed.
[1:12:09] It's the type of the son of God, the
[1:12:11] Lord Jesus Christ, that was going to be
[1:12:13] upon the cross for three days. Amen. But
[1:12:16] then after the resurrection, all listen
[1:12:18] now. After the resurrection of Jesus
[1:12:21] Christ, something begins to happen. Now,
[1:12:24] God is going to fulfill the promise of
[1:12:27] Isaac's seed, which is bringing him a
[1:12:28] gentile bride. Now, notice what he tells
[1:12:31] Abraham after the resurrection type of
[1:12:33] Isaac. He begins to tell them, "I will
[1:12:35] bless thee. I will multiply thy seed as
[1:12:38] the stars that are in the heaven and the
[1:12:39] sand that's on the sea. And thy seed
[1:12:42] shall possess the gates of your enemy.
[1:12:44] He's already talking about the Isaac
[1:12:46] seed line that is going to be a
[1:12:48] conqueror. It's going to be an
[1:12:49] overcomer.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; He's not fought one battle, but he tells
[1:12:53] him what he is. He's not been won
[1:12:55] through one trial yet, but he tells him
[1:12:57] what he is. It's the same with you and
[1:12:59] I. Before you ever come to the earth,
[1:13:01] God has already declared it by his word
[1:13:03] that you was going to be a conqueror. He
[1:13:05] was going to be an overcomer this day.
[1:13:07] It's already been lived.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And then God says something incredible.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And in thy seed
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; shall all the nations of the earthl,
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; not just Jacob,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; not just the 12 tribes.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the mystery of
[1:13:28] redemption. out of every nation, out of
[1:13:32] every kindred, out of every tongue, out
[1:13:34] of every people, all the nations of the
[1:13:37] earth shall be blessed.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; God is prophesying about the lineage of
[1:13:41] Abraham and he's declaring that you will
[1:13:44] be blessed and every nation will be
[1:13:46] blessed.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the promise after the
[1:13:51] resurrection of Jesus?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the same promise after the
[1:13:55] resurrection? Whenever the spirit of God
[1:13:58] come back on the day of Pentecost, and
[1:14:00] the Bible said, "This promise is unto
[1:14:02] you."
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And to your children
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and to those that are far off,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; and as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:14:09] call. He did not limit it to a certain
[1:14:11] bloodline. He did not limit it to a
[1:14:14] certain lineage. It was not just to Jew.
[1:14:16] But this promise is unto you in the
[1:14:18] prophecy and to your children, those who
[1:14:20] are far Gentiles.
[1:14:23] God's spoken word is prophesying over
[1:14:26] the church and he's letting them know I
[1:14:28] made a promise. I made an oath within my
[1:14:30] word and I will fulfill what I have
[1:14:32] spoken.
[1:14:33] Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, in order for God to do this,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; if he's going to be the type of the end
[1:14:40] time, death, burial, resurrection,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; promise of the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; then he can't stop with just Isaac
[1:14:48] resurrecting
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and he can't stop with just pronouncing
[1:14:51] blessings.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; But now Isaac the son
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; has got to have a bride.
[1:15:00] Can you imagine in your Bible is the
[1:15:02] very story of your life that was wrote
[1:15:05] 6,000 years ago. Your identity inside
[1:15:08] Rebecca was already laying there.
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Now the story of Abraham father is
[1:15:19] coming to an end.
[1:15:21] So it moves from father to son. It moves
[1:15:26] from one office to another,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; from one dispensation to another.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now you've come to the end of
[1:15:32] the book.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; So the whole story of Abraham
[1:15:38] in the physical from the old is now
[1:15:41] changing to the new.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So Abraham is finishing. It's the end of
[1:15:46] the book.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And at the finishing of the book or I'll
[1:15:50] say the fulfillment of the book,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; the father sends. Now watch. He sends
[1:15:56] his servant Eleazar to find a bride for
[1:15:59] his son Isaac.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice something here. After
[1:16:04] he reveals himself as Jehovah Gyra,
[1:16:08] after he provides himself
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; a sacrifice,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; I'll say it a little bit slower in case
[1:16:14] you didn't catch what God told Abraham.
[1:16:16] I will provide my
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I will provide myself
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Now something happens. He tells him,
[1:16:27] "I'll multiply your seed." But the
[1:16:30] problem is he can't multiply it without
[1:16:32] the promised son.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; I'll just say it for you. There's no way
[1:16:38] there's going to be a multiplication of
[1:16:40] Gentiles outside of Isaac, the son of
[1:16:42] God. Because of Isaac, you and I are
[1:16:45] part of it. Because of Isaac, we come
[1:16:48] through the blood. Because of Isaac,
[1:16:50] Isaac, we've been poured into a royal
[1:16:52] sea line and a royal lineage. Because of
[1:16:54] Isaac,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; now watch what the Bible says. It's
[1:17:00] imperative that you catch this. The
[1:17:02] Bible said as soon as he leaves the
[1:17:04] mountain, he goes down to a place. And
[1:17:07] the Bible said he returned him and the
[1:17:09] young men and they rose up and went down
[1:17:11] to Beersa. And Abraham dwelt at Beeba.
[1:17:17] So after the resurrection, after the
[1:17:19] promise has been made, Abraham goes to
[1:17:21] Beeba. And the word Beersa means the
[1:17:25] well of the sevenfold oath.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So after death, burial, resurrection,
[1:17:32] promised son coming on the scene, spirit
[1:17:34] of God being given, the next thing is
[1:17:36] seven seals. I mean, seven O's, seven
[1:17:39] promises of God down there at the well
[1:17:41] of Beha. Abraham goes down there to that
[1:17:43] well of the sevenfold. Let me just say,
[1:17:46] not a one seal well, not a five seal
[1:17:48] well, but a seven seal well. Amen.
[1:17:52] That's got seven seal promise from the
[1:17:54] start to the finish.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; And while he's at Beersa,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham left Haran many years ago. But
[1:18:05] while he's at this well, he hears
[1:18:09] something from
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Haran.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He hears some He hears something from
[1:18:16] his kindred
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; that he not the Bible doesn't record him
[1:18:20] ever hearing one thing before this.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; But he gets to this well and guess what?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Here comes some good news.
[1:18:30] And the Bible said it was told,
[1:18:34] it was told unto Abraham, saying,
[1:18:36] "Behold, I don't want to bore you, but
[1:18:38] this is powerful. Behold, Mila, she had
[1:18:41] also borne children unto thy brother
[1:18:43] Nahor." So he receives word from the
[1:18:46] homeland that his family is producing a
[1:18:50] lineage
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; and they're going to have offspring.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; All the years that has went by, he's not
[1:18:56] dealt with any of that, but he's fixing
[1:18:58] to.
[1:19:00] Did God tell him to leave there? He
[1:19:02] said, "Leave there. Get away from there.
[1:19:04] I'll go to a place that I will show
[1:19:05] you." He's not had anything to do with
[1:19:08] Gentiles, the homeland yet. But now
[1:19:10] something is about to change.
[1:19:12] Something's about to take place. And the
[1:19:15] Bible says that she had borne unto him
[1:19:17] children and Chzo and Hazel and Pilash
[1:19:19] and Jila and Beth. And Beth begot
[1:19:22] Rebecca.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; He's not even sent Elizer yet.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; He's not even commissioned Elizer yet.
[1:19:31] But I want to tell you before the
[1:19:33] servant ever went to get her.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Before he ever went to get her, before
[1:19:38] he was ever commissioned by the father,
[1:19:41] Rebecca's name is already recorded.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Her name is already recorded. And
[1:19:48] Abraham knows that there's a woman out
[1:19:50] there by the name of Rebecca and she's
[1:19:52] blood to you, Abraham.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And Beth begott Rebecca.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; So he's at the well of the seven seals,
[1:20:06] seven old folks.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to him. It's made known to
[1:20:10] him. He receives the word.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; He's got some other blood tin out there.
[1:20:17] Hallelujah. That his brother's wife has
[1:20:20] given birth to a daughter and her name
[1:20:22] is Rebecca.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; So he listen to this. After the
[1:20:26] resurrection,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; amen, something happens and he hears
[1:20:31] this name. Now you move from Genesis 22
[1:20:35] and you come to Genesis 24 and the Bible
[1:20:38] said Abraham was old. Watch him coming
[1:20:40] to the end. He was old and well stricken
[1:20:42] in age. Abraham. Can I say it the way I
[1:20:45] see it? Here comes the ancient of days.
[1:20:48] He's old and wellstricken in age. And
[1:20:51] the Lord had blessed Abraham and all
[1:20:54] things.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; So, some years has went by, some days
[1:20:58] has went by, some ages
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; has went by.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And at the end of the ages, Abraham
[1:21:06] sends his servant Isaac, his servant
[1:21:08] Eleazar, to find a bride for Isaac. So
[1:21:12] all of this time, Isaac has been
[1:21:14] maturing. I said Isaac has been
[1:21:16] maturing, but let me tell you, not only
[1:21:18] has Isaac been maturing, but Rebecca's
[1:21:21] been maturing as well. So there had to
[1:21:23] be some time that would go by to be able
[1:21:26] to allow Isaac to come to the place
[1:21:28] where we had the ability to reproduce
[1:21:30] seed. And not only Isaac reproduce seed,
[1:21:33] but the bride that he's going to marry,
[1:21:34] he's not coming marrying two year olds
[1:21:36] or three year old. He wants a bride that
[1:21:38] is mature. And he wants to make
[1:21:41] shallelujah. He wants to make sure that
[1:21:43] the bride is mature.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, notice this. He said, "And I'll make
[1:21:51] thee swear by the Lord,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; the God of heaven, the God of the earth.
[1:21:55] Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son
[1:22:00] of the daughters of these
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Canaanites."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Do you know the prophet said, "Under no
[1:22:05] circumstance should a believer ever
[1:22:08] marry an unbeliever.
[1:22:11] How many knows that's your that's the
[1:22:12] message of the hour?
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Like it or lump it, it's for all of us.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And Abraham being the first one tells
[1:22:19] him, he said, "You swear to me. You
[1:22:21] swear to me by the God that has made
[1:22:23] this promise. Swear to me, you'll not
[1:22:26] take a daughter out of these
[1:22:27] Canaanites."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; He don't want a Canaanitish woman.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Don't you take a daughter from that
[1:22:34] great Don't you take one of them.
[1:22:36] I want somebody who's blood. I want
[1:22:39] somebody that's not a Hivite or a
[1:22:40] Jebusite or Amorite. I want somebody
[1:22:42] that can believe the word in its
[1:22:44] entirety,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; but I want you to go into my country and
[1:22:51] to my kindred and take a wife under my
[1:22:54] son Isaac.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; So he sends him to his lineage.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; So their blood kin.
[1:23:04] Isaac can only marry somebody who's got
[1:23:06] the same blood on him.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; I said Isaac cannot marry somebody
[1:23:13] outside the blood. That's the reason the
[1:23:16] prophet said you make sure that boy's
[1:23:17] got the Holy Ghost and you make sure
[1:23:19] that girl has got the Holy Ghost because
[1:23:21] that is the blood speaking in their
[1:23:23] life. Make sure it's not a Canaanite out
[1:23:25] here. Oh, they may look better. They may
[1:23:27] they may dress different than the
[1:23:29] daughters of God do, but don't get your
[1:23:30] eyes on that. The prophet said that only
[1:23:32] lasts so long. But get your eyes on that
[1:23:34] character. Get your eyes on that person
[1:23:36] that wants to worship and stand for God
[1:23:38] and believe.
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Go to my people. What I'm showing you is
[1:23:49] every bit of this you have to agree has
[1:23:52] been orchestrated by God.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You think all this happened by chance?
[1:23:58] God did not leave this moment to chance.
[1:24:00] God did not leave this moment to some
[1:24:02] type of a circumstance that it might
[1:24:04] work out and it might not work out. I'm
[1:24:06] telling you, God is behind every part of
[1:24:07] this. And now Abraham is going to
[1:24:10] commission this servant Ezer to go find
[1:24:13] a bride that'll follow him fully.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Remember Eleazar asked him, "Should I
[1:24:22] take Isaac with me?" And Abraham says,
[1:24:25] "No, don't take him. Don't take No, no,
[1:24:28] no. For he said, "The Lord a God of
[1:24:30] heaven, which took me from my father's
[1:24:31] house," watch the way he types this,
[1:24:32] "that took me from my father's house,
[1:24:35] from the land of my kindred, which spake
[1:24:36] unto me and that swear unto me." Watch
[1:24:38] this, "He spake unto me. The one that
[1:24:41] prophesied, the one that spoke the word,
[1:24:43] the one that told me I was going to have
[1:24:44] a son, the one that told me, Amen. The
[1:24:47] one who made the promise, he has
[1:24:49] spoken." Abraham is not dealing by
[1:24:51] hearsay. He has been spoken to by the
[1:24:53] spoken word from God. And he said, "Unto
[1:24:56] thy seed will I give this land." And
[1:24:58] listen to this. And he, the one that
[1:25:01] made the promise, the one that kept this
[1:25:04] promise, the one that brought Isaac from
[1:25:06] the dead,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; he said he shall send his angel
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; before thee.
[1:25:17] He shall send his angel before thee,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt take a wife unto my son
[1:25:24] from then.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; You know what he's telling Elazer?
[1:25:27] You're not going by yourself.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You are not going down there alone.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; I'm letting you know that there's an
[1:25:34] angel that's been making these promises.
[1:25:36] The one that's been keeping his word.
[1:25:38] The one that's been manifesting himself.
[1:25:40] He is going to go with you. Amen. You
[1:25:43] will not go alone. But let me say this.
[1:25:45] God will not allow one promise of his
[1:25:47] word to fall short. And the prophet of
[1:25:49] God said he would bankrupt heaven before
[1:25:52] he'd allow one word to fall.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Do you want to know why the ministry of
[1:25:57] Eleazar was supernatural? There was an
[1:25:59] angel with him.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; It'll be the ministry of the angel
[1:26:03] through a man.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] that when the serpent comes to
[1:26:09] Mesopotamia, Haram,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; he comes to this place and remember the
[1:26:15] prophet said it took him about a month
[1:26:17] to get there and he's got everything he
[1:26:20] needs
[1:26:22] to get a bride.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; He's got everything he needs. He's got
[1:26:29] 10 camels that belongs to the father.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] It would be these camels that would
[1:26:38] carry Rebecca back
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; to Isaac.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Now, he's got gifts.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; He's got gold.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; He's got silver.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; But remember, the gifts was only bait on
[1:26:52] the hook.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Can you do anything for this?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The gifts was only bait on the hook.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The gifts was wonderful, but which one
[1:27:03] would you rather have? the gift or the
[1:27:06] giver.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have the giver than all the
[1:27:09] gifts you can stack into this room. I
[1:27:12] would rather have the giver than the
[1:27:13] gift of the ministry that I got in my
[1:27:15] heart. I would rather have the giver
[1:27:17] than anything that Pentecost, Luther,
[1:27:20] Wesley, any of the rest of the ages can
[1:27:22] produce. Give us the giver. Let me tell
[1:27:25] you why. Because the giver can change
[1:27:28] our body. A gift will never change our
[1:27:30] body. But if the giver ever gets on the
[1:27:33] inside, the giver can change our body.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So he goes to Haran and he's got to get
[1:27:46] her attention to prove that he is who he
[1:27:50] says he is. Ain't that awesome? So when
[1:27:54] he comes to Haran,
[1:27:57] he feels dro
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; out of all the places around Haran that
[1:28:02] he can go.
[1:28:04] He ends up at a whale.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So here's the ministry of Elijah.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Here's the ministry of Eleazar and he
[1:28:14] ends up at a whale.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] So whenever he goes, he's going. There's
[1:28:22] going to be people of all kinds of
[1:28:23] backgrounds. There's going to be all
[1:28:25] kinds. The Bible said with the daughters
[1:28:26] when actually daughters of men would
[1:28:28] come to draw water from that well.
[1:28:29] There's going to be all kind of women
[1:28:31] that's going to come there. It's got all
[1:28:32] kinds of backgrounds. They're going to
[1:28:34] have all kinds of beliefs.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Remember where he come that Haram is
[1:28:38] actually a place of idolatry.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So there's going to be idol worshippers
[1:28:42] there.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; There's going to be man worshippers
[1:28:45] there.
[1:28:48] Wow, there's people around this message
[1:28:49] ain't got rid of that spirit.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; There's going to be all kinds of people
[1:28:54] that's going to be there. But I want to
[1:28:56] tell you, Eleazar is not going to this
[1:28:58] well just to find anybody. He's coming
[1:29:00] to find a specific person. He wants the
[1:29:03] one that God has ordained to be Isaac's
[1:29:06] bride.
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:11] I can imagine the responsibility,
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; the responsibility that's put upon this
[1:29:16] man's shoulders to make sure that you
[1:29:18] get the right one.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the responsibility on
[1:29:25] this servant to make sure it's the one
[1:29:28] that God wants?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; So, you know what the servant does? What
[1:29:31] every other servant does?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; They put it in the hands of God. I need
[1:29:35] your leadership.
[1:29:38] And he said, "Let it be, let it come to
[1:29:40] pass, Lord,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; that the damel to whom I shall say, let
[1:29:46] down thy picture that I may drink."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just stop here.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a picture,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; you're not the right one.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; You've got to meet the criteria to be
[1:30:03] able to be the right bride. And if you
[1:30:05] don't have a receiver,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; if you don't have a container,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; you are not the bride. You've got to be
[1:30:11] able to have something to receive. And
[1:30:14] not just receive, you've got to have
[1:30:16] something to give.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking about giving and
[1:30:21] getting and getting and get. What about
[1:30:23] giving? What about watering some
[1:30:24] candles? What about watering the
[1:30:26] message? What about watering the word?
[1:30:28] You got to have something to be able to
[1:30:29] give.
[1:30:37] Brother, point the antenna closer here.
[1:30:38] I'm losing signal. Amen. We'll get it in
[1:30:41] a minute. Hang on.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't have a picture, then
[1:30:45] you know for sure you ain't the right
[1:30:46] one.
[1:30:48] But not only do you got to have a
[1:30:49] picture, but he says, "Let the woman
[1:30:53] that I say I want to drink."
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And in return, she's got to have a
[1:30:58] voice.
[1:31:00] She's got to say the right words.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; She's got to say the right words.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And she will say, "Drink."
[1:31:11] So the message,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; the messenger
[1:31:15] Eleer has got to do his part.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; But Rebecca, you got to do your part,
[1:31:21] too.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; And not only is she going to give me a
[1:31:28] drink,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; and here's
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; the real trial,
[1:31:33] but she must give thy camels drink also.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; I just got to I know small places are
[1:31:40] pregnant,
[1:31:42] but she will give thy camels also.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Think about that. She She's He's
[1:31:50] literally telling God, "These camels,
[1:31:52] they may belong to Abraham, but that
[1:31:54] ain't where they come from."
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Because every good gift,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; everything that Abraham owned,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; everything that Eleazar had, it came
[1:32:04] from Almighty God.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That thy camels will say, and give thy
[1:32:09] drink to thy camels drink also. Let the
[1:32:11] same be she that thou hast appointed
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; for thy servant Isaac.
[1:32:18] You're talking about believing in
[1:32:19] predestination.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; You're talking about believing in divine
[1:32:22] ordination that God can work things out.
[1:32:24] His This man believes in election.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He knew what God said concerning the sea
[1:32:30] line. He knew what God said concerning
[1:32:32] the promise.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; He knew that Abraham's seed was going to
[1:32:36] be multiplied. And you can't multiply
[1:32:38] the seed unless you got a bride.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So he prays this.
[1:32:45] And when he praised this at this well,
[1:32:49] before brother Ram ever even got done,
[1:32:51] there was already some bride coming out.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Before he ever even got done, the Bible
[1:32:58] said it came to pass before he had done
[1:33:00] speaking
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; that Rebecca come out.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Watch the Bible. who was born to Bethl,
[1:33:10] son of Mila, the wife of Nahor,
[1:33:13] Abraham's brother, her picture with her
[1:33:15] picture on her shoulder.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; She's the right lineage.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; She's the right seed line.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; She's got a picture.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, this is the one in
[1:33:28] Genesis 22 at the bare seat of the well
[1:33:31] of the sevenfold. This is the very woman
[1:33:34] that was told to Abraham before he ever
[1:33:36] commissioned Eleazar. This is the one
[1:33:38] that's already been written about.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; But now she has to prove his
[1:33:46] word.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; She's got to vindicate Eloer's words to
[1:33:50] prove that she's the right one.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So she's got the picture that carried
[1:33:54] the water. And whenever she went down to
[1:33:56] the well, oh my. And she gets this
[1:33:58] water. Here comes Elijah said, "I need a
[1:34:00] drink." Now, she's got to say the right
[1:34:02] words. She's got to speak the right
[1:34:04] words. She must respond correctly to the
[1:34:08] word.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Anybody hear me? She must prophesy
[1:34:13] again.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; You surely believe
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; there's something supernatural going on.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; There was something supernatural going
[1:34:25] on.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you why. Because before
[1:34:28] Eleazar ever even got there, the angel
[1:34:31] of the Lord
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; had already arrived.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; He had already arrived on the scene. And
[1:34:40] whether she knew it or not, or Eleazar
[1:34:42] knew it or not, that angel was already
[1:34:44] at work. He was already moving. He was
[1:34:48] already wooing. He was already pulling
[1:34:50] up on that heart.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you see why you come to this thing
[1:34:55] before you ever come to church? Before
[1:34:57] you ever made a decision, you didn't
[1:34:59] come to God because you wanted to. God
[1:35:01] was pulling on your heart and wooing
[1:35:03] upon your heart to bring you back to the
[1:35:05] promise, back to the word. Why? You're
[1:35:07] the seed of Abraham.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I love the way the prophet says this. I
[1:35:16] believe the angel of the Lord had beat
[1:35:19] Eleazar there about half an hour.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:26] That tells me God travels faster than
[1:35:28] camels.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; I say God travels faster than thoughts.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; He had already be lesser there by a half
[1:35:34] an hour. For the Bible said he will send
[1:35:37] his angels before you to make the way
[1:35:39] clear.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; How many was at that well? How many
[1:35:44] women was at that well? And God, the
[1:35:46] angel come through there going, "You
[1:35:48] need to go home. You need to go ahead
[1:35:49] and go home. You need to get on out of
[1:35:51] here. It's time for you to go home.
[1:35:53] you've had all the water you need. You
[1:35:54] can get that water tomorrow. Can you
[1:35:56] imagine the procrastinator that was down
[1:35:58] there had procrastinated a week about
[1:36:00] getting to that well and she finally had
[1:36:01] made it down there, but something talked
[1:36:03] on the inside and said, "Go ahead and
[1:36:05] procrastinate a little bit more. I need
[1:36:07] you to get out of the way." And here
[1:36:09] comes Rebecca walking right after her to
[1:36:10] the well.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; God knows how to clear obstacles.
[1:36:20] Whatever is in your way from getting to
[1:36:22] the well tonight, God knows how to clear
[1:36:24] them obstacle. Don't worry about what
[1:36:26] your friends is going to say. Don't
[1:36:27] worry about your mama, what she's going
[1:36:29] to say or your daddy. God knows how to
[1:36:31] clear the obstacles to get you to the
[1:36:33] well.
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:35] [Applause]
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; And there's Rebecca.
[1:36:44] She's in the house
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and Something moves over her.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; No, no, let me say it better than that.
[1:36:53] Someone
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; someone moves over her.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It says, "You need to go to that well."
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Am I thirsty?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; You need to go to that well.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But I usually wait a little while before
[1:37:11] I go. No, you need to go to that well.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; You got to go to that well.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; And the more
[1:37:19] The more he spoke his word over her,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; it starts influencing her body.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody hear me?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; The more you hear this word, the more
[1:37:29] you hear this angel, the more the
[1:37:31] influence of that word will have over
[1:37:33] your life. Amen. The more you set under
[1:37:35] the preaching of the word, the more the
[1:37:38] influence, hallelujah, of the gospel
[1:37:40] that'll come to you. Why? Your influence
[1:37:42] from the mighty angels.
[1:37:49] The angel come and said, it was the
[1:37:51] angel of the Lord that come and spoke to
[1:37:52] Rebecca's heart and said, "Go get that
[1:37:54] water.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Go get that water."
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And Rebecca arose.
[1:38:02] They may have been some that was
[1:38:03] sleeping
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; under a layout of searing see a spirit.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; But something awoke her and said, "Go
[1:38:10] get that water."
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And said, "Rebecca, come to the well
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; at the evening time.
[1:38:16] This ain't by chance.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; This ain't just Listen, friends. This is
[1:38:20] not by coincidence.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Rebecca didn't just happen to be there.
[1:38:25] No more than Ezer just happened to be
[1:38:27] there.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Something was working. The prayer of
[1:38:31] Eleazar before he ever prayed it.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You hearing me?
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Before you was ever even born.
[1:38:44] She can't explain it.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's things she
[1:38:48] cannot explain.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; I don't need it all explained, but I do
[1:38:52] need it revealed.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to explain things
[1:38:55] either. You may not be able to take your
[1:38:57] Bible here and here and here and here.
[1:38:59] You're not even called to do that. You
[1:39:01] can say, "I can tell you what I can. I
[1:39:02] may not be able to explain here and here
[1:39:04] and here and here." But let me tell you
[1:39:05] what I do. I believe it here. I believe
[1:39:07] it here. I believe it here. I believe it
[1:39:09] here because I got it in here. Amen.
[1:39:12] Hallelujah. I got it in here as a reason
[1:39:14] why I believe it. I may not be able to
[1:39:17] explain it, but I do believe it.
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you tonight, what brought you
[1:39:26] to this? Well,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; what brought you to this truth? What
[1:39:29] brought you to this message? Well,
[1:39:31] Brother David, my mom and my dad. Yeah.
[1:39:33] Then why are you still here?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Some of them quit years ago. Some are
[1:39:37] just church sinners. Well, why are you
[1:39:40] still here? I'll tell you why. Because
[1:39:42] the angel of the Lord has been pulling
[1:39:44] upon your heart, pulling upon your mind,
[1:39:47] pulling upon your spirit, drawing you to
[1:39:50] the well.
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And not only did you get here, you're
[1:40:01] staying here.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm glad that I got
[1:40:06] something. I might be up and down and up
[1:40:09] and down and up and down, but let me
[1:40:11] tell you what I'm not. I'm not in and
[1:40:13] out and in and out and in and out.
[1:40:16] I may be up and down, but I ain't in and
[1:40:18] out. Once I got in, he wouldn't let me
[1:40:20] out.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Supernaturally,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord got a hold of you.
[1:40:39] Abraham said, "I wonder why."
[1:40:42] He says, "Have you ever wondered why
[1:40:45] that Rebecca came before any of the
[1:40:47] other girls?"
[1:40:50] Here's the reason.
[1:40:54] Because Eleazar had to find Rebecca
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; in the evening time.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; The The sign was performed
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; in the evening time.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the time that we're living
[1:41:11] in.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I trust you get this."
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you, I trust you
[1:41:17] get this.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; This is the evening time.
[1:41:23] So if it's the evening time
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; and we got the well
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; and we got the well,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; we got the message,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; we got truth.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; He said there was an evening time
[1:41:38] Rebecca came out led by the spirit. Do
[1:41:40] you believe that? How otherwise could
[1:41:41] she have come?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; There might have been a many before her.
[1:41:47] church to church, brother.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; But she was led
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; by the spirit
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; and leading.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, she was elected out of
[1:41:57] all the rest of the church's women.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; She was elected to come to this certain
[1:42:02] well.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; There may have been a lot of wells
[1:42:04] around Haram, but I want to tell you
[1:42:06] this is a predestinated spot
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; because this is a meeting place.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? You're not
[1:42:12] here in this place by chance. You're not
[1:42:14] out here on this gravel road by chance.
[1:42:16] God's got a meeting place. And God puts
[1:42:18] whales wherever he wants them at. And
[1:42:20] when you come to the whale, just expect
[1:42:22] to hear truth.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you know that Rebecca Na
[1:42:29] was blood relation?" The bride of Jesus
[1:42:31] Christ is blood relation to him. She's a
[1:42:34] bloodbought bride.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; No wonder she was led by the spirit.
[1:42:39] There was a connection.
[1:42:49] was over at Morgan's farm the other day.
[1:42:51] He said, "You see that wire right there?
[1:42:53] That'll bite you." Do you know why? It's
[1:42:56] hooked up to electric.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And if you get grounded real good,
[1:43:00] you're going to connect.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; And then you're going to holler.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Well, that's okay. That's what happened
[1:43:07] to me when I went to the altar. That's
[1:43:09] what happened when God got a hold of me.
[1:43:11] It to like 220 or even greater they got
[1:43:13] a hold of and we sweat and we cry and we
[1:43:16] ball and we snot. That's okay. That's
[1:43:18] the way every birth is. The prophet of
[1:43:20] God says every birth is a mess.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in no dried confession.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I don't believe in a
[1:43:28] dried confession. I don't care what you
[1:43:31] say.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me you're sorry for
[1:43:35] your sins and it don't bring a tear out
[1:43:37] of your eyes? I believe in a blood
[1:43:39] religion that'll make you weep your way
[1:43:41] to Calvary until God squeezes your heart
[1:43:44] that the juice runs out of your eyes.
[1:43:47] [Applause]
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; People around this message don't want
[1:43:51] that because they're compromisers.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Because they ain't preaching a born
[1:43:56] again experience. They ain't preaching a
[1:43:58] new birth.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I still believe in preaching against
[1:44:01] women cutting their hair.
[1:44:05] I preach against women wearing pants
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; because it's against the word of God.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; We preach against women wearing makeup
[1:44:12] because it's against the word of God.
[1:44:14] That's an Elijah's message.
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; The prophet said if we don't preach it,
[1:44:23] you leave the door open, the goats will
[1:44:24] get in.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your last name is.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your family is. We've
[1:44:31] been called to a message of Ezer. It's
[1:44:34] time for you and I to actually do what
[1:44:36] the word says we can do.
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; He said there was a connection coming
[1:44:44] together.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; There was a union,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; an invisible
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; union
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; that was coming together. Come on.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; So before there was ever a physical
[1:45:01] manifestation
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; of bride and groom, there was already an
[1:45:04] invisible union that was going on by the
[1:45:07] word.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's what happened the night you give
[1:45:11] your heart to God.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That night that you went to the altar
[1:45:13] and surrendered yourself to God, God
[1:45:15] heard you.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; I said God heard you.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God did his part. Then you did
[1:45:21] your part. You come and responded to the
[1:45:23] well.
[1:45:26] Brother said, "Why did Rebecca make that
[1:45:28] sudden move? Why did she go to the
[1:45:30] waters of life so quickly? Why could the
[1:45:33] angel speak to her?"
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Because she was blood relation to Isaac.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And that's who the angel can speak to
[1:45:40] tonight.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Those who are of a blood relation.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; She made her decisions quick.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; She didn't need six months to pray about
[1:45:50] this.
[1:45:55] She didn't need well let me sleep on it
[1:45:56] a couple nights. She didn't need to
[1:45:57] sleep on it a couple nights.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; She made her decision. Watch her real
[1:46:01] quick then. And then stops. He says,
[1:46:04] "Watch them in the meetings. Watch how
[1:46:07] quickly if they are are ordained to
[1:46:10] eternal life, they'll know it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; They will know it
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; because there's something in the message
[1:46:18] that stirs them.
[1:46:22] Hallelujah. There's something in the
[1:46:25] message that stirs them. That's what
[1:46:27] stirred Rebecca. The message stirred her
[1:46:30] and the angel was leading her.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; The angel that went before Eleazar had
[1:46:39] already be to stir that heart up.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And this cake God was doing some baking.
[1:46:52] And whenever he got it just right, here
[1:46:54] comes her. Remember said the angel of
[1:46:57] the Lord was leading her. She got
[1:46:59] stirred.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Did the Bible say she ran? Did the Bible
[1:47:04] say she hastened?
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; This is where he got it at. Why? The
[1:47:08] message she come in contact with it.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Then she was stirred. And immediately
[1:47:12] when she watered the camel, the gift
[1:47:15] went on her immediately.
[1:47:18] I'm going to tell you what we need
[1:47:19] sometimes.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we need to be stirred
[1:47:25] more right now
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; than what we ever have been.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we got families
[1:47:31] that needs to be stirred.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; We got daddies that needs to be stirred.
[1:47:35] It's time for the church to wake up and
[1:47:37] get stirred up a little bit. We want a
[1:47:39] church that is stirred up. We want a
[1:47:41] preacher that is stirred up. Listen,
[1:47:42] friends, what good does it do for the
[1:47:44] pastor to be stirred and nobody else is
[1:47:46] stirred? It ain't pastor religion. This
[1:47:48] is a body move. I said this is a body
[1:47:51] move. I say tonight, God stirs from the
[1:47:53] front to the back. Whether you're sick,
[1:47:55] 16, 60, or 160, let the word of God come
[1:47:59] your way. Let it stir you out tonight.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; I say, keep on stirring, Lord.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You're just about to get a cake right
[1:48:12] here, Lord.
[1:48:14] So when Ellie user asks for that drink,
[1:48:16] she's already start
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; so she can respond quickly.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Everything from this point on. When
[1:48:24] Ellie Ezer says, "Give me a drink."
[1:48:26] Whatever she says
[1:48:29] will determine everything after this.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; If she walks away, it's over.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; If she stays quiet,
[1:48:40] it's over.
[1:48:43] She must speak
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; and she must say the right words.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; She says, "I'll give you a drink."
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; And the next part that Eleazar prayed
[1:48:53] said,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; "Let her walk these candles."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe she'd seen a many men with all
[1:49:02] kinds of camels,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; but this day is different.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And when she had done giving him drink,
[1:49:08] she said, "Hallelujah.
[1:49:10] I will draw water. Can you Imagine Ellie
[1:49:12] Eer said, "You talking about deja vu
[1:49:15] hoohoo?"
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; She says, "Exactly. I will draw water
[1:49:20] for thy camels."
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? He says, "They're
[1:49:25] your camels." And she says, "Thy
[1:49:27] camels."
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Whose camels are they?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "I will draw water for thy
[1:49:32] camels until they have done drinking."
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; They said that a thirsty camel
[1:49:42] can drink 30 gallons of water.
[1:49:46] Now, I don't know how big that picture
[1:49:48] was, but let's just guesstimate. All
[1:49:49] right.
[1:49:51] So, if there's 10 of them and they can
[1:49:53] drink 30. Think about this. And she's
[1:49:56] got a five gallallon pitcher. For some
[1:49:58] of us, we got a little bit bigger ones
[1:49:59] than that. Some of us got symbol size. I
[1:50:02] got all I want in 10 minutes, brother.
[1:50:03] I'm ready to go home. Praise God. I got
[1:50:04] all I need.
[1:50:07] I got all I need in the opening prayer.
[1:50:13] Some people say I'm coming to bring my
[1:50:14] cup.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup, Lord.
[1:50:23] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I want to get as much as I can get.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I said, I want to receive as much as I
[1:50:33] can get. I want to pull every ounce of
[1:50:36] strength that the man of God has. As a
[1:50:38] matter of fact, I want to pull him so
[1:50:39] hard I pull him out of his notes, out of
[1:50:42] his thoughts, out of his mind, pull it
[1:50:43] right out of his sermon and pull him
[1:50:45] right up into another dimension. I want
[1:50:47] to make him do my part and pull from the
[1:50:49] word of God.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you
[1:50:55] think about it? Five gallons, it would
[1:50:57] take 60 trips.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; 60 trips on five gallons.
[1:51:06] 300 gallons.
[1:51:08] God, I'm tired just thinking about it.
[1:51:11] And wells wouldn't, you know, as we have
[1:51:13] today, pull up on the road.
[1:51:16] They actually had stairways. So, she
[1:51:18] would have to go down. No, no, no.
[1:51:21] That's too good to miss. She couldn't
[1:51:23] stay up here all pies. She had to get
[1:51:25] low and she had to get down and get some
[1:51:28] of that water and go back up. Brother,
[1:51:30] can you imagine? Trip after trip. Three
[1:51:32] more trips, I'm going to have that one
[1:51:33] done. Four more trips, I'm gonna have
[1:51:35] that one. 10 more trips, I'm gonna have
[1:51:37] that. I don't know how many trips I got
[1:51:39] to make here to this well. If it's
[1:51:40] another 10 or another 20 or 100, I'm
[1:51:43] going to keep making my trip right down
[1:51:45] to this well. And I'm going to come
[1:51:46] right down if I got to go to the altar.
[1:51:48] I'm coming to get my picture and to fill
[1:51:51] it up to water the camel.
[1:51:58] This is a woman of character. She's not
[1:52:00] going to quit. She's not going to give
[1:52:02] up. She's not gonna stop.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[1:52:09] she hastened.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; She hastened.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; In a picture in the tran
[1:52:22] again.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Now I know like I said sometimes small
[1:52:29] places you just back.
[1:52:31] She emptied her pitcher into the trough
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; which so happened to be the same water
[1:52:38] that Eleazar was drinking.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; So Eleazar and the camels was drinking
[1:52:46] the same water.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, don't talk about a messenger
[1:52:50] that just preached the message. He drunk
[1:52:53] the message. He believed the message. He
[1:52:56] didn't just want the messenger to give
[1:52:57] it. He believed what he was preaching.
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:06] First time I ever seen that, by the way.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And then she hastened into the picture
[1:53:12] of the trough. Ran again.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; If I could just retitle the sermon
[1:53:16] today. Just run again.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; We're losing our runners. We got to keep
[1:53:22] running and keep running. Don't give up
[1:53:24] when you get tired. Don't give up when
[1:53:26] you make mistakes. Don't give up when
[1:53:27] you fall short. get back up and keep on
[1:53:30] running
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:35] until she drew water for all the camels.
[1:53:44] How in the world are you ever going to
[1:53:47] get to Isaac if you ain't watering this
[1:53:50] message?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Watering is part of our lives.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; The waterway. Yes sir.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Is the light today.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a sprinkling.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a full immersion.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; It shall be light in the evening time.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; The path to glory you shall surely find.
[1:54:10] The waterway is the light today buried
[1:54:14] in the precious name of Jesus.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Young and old repent of all your sins.
[1:54:19] The Holy Ghost will surely enter in.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; The evening light has come. It is a fact
[1:54:24] that God and Christ are
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that last I'm done.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that last bucket of
[1:54:36] water?
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Sweating worse than I am right now.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Just one more trip down there,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Lord. One more trip. Give me strength
[1:54:46] for one more trip.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And finally, you get down and maybe 300
[1:54:51] gallons. You're going to have to reach
[1:54:52] way
[1:54:54] So you reach as far as you can
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; and you fill the tub.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; I got something.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I got something.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that
[1:55:04] bucket of water, Rebecca? I got one
[1:55:07] candle left.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Listen to me.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; We've been in this thing for years.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Some of us has been in it, brother.
[1:55:14] We've been in this thing for years.
[1:55:16] We've heard thousands on top of
[1:55:18] thousands of sermons. But listen, one
[1:55:20] day
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; will be your last trip.
[1:55:23] Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; One day I'll preach my last sermon,
[1:55:29] brother. We'll preach our last sermons.
[1:55:31] That'll be it. Your last trip to the
[1:55:33] well.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; That's the reason when I preach, I don't
[1:55:35] care if it's 66,600
[1:55:37] or six. I preach as hard as I can
[1:55:40] preach.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Because if that's my last trip to that
[1:55:42] well, I want to make sure I give him
[1:55:44] everything that I got.
[1:55:50] She gives that last one into the trough
[1:55:53] and that's it. And Ezer took the gifts.
[1:55:58] The moment she got done watering, she
[1:56:01] received the gifts from Eleaser.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens after you get done?
[1:56:10] You receive the Holy Ghost. Every one of
[1:56:12] you in the name of Jesus Christ from and
[1:56:14] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:56:15] Ghost.
[1:56:18] Can you imagine? She's got bracelets,
[1:56:20] gold, silver, earrings, all these
[1:56:22] things. She's wearing them.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; She came there with nothing.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; We came to this thing with nothing.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; We couldn't help ourselves. We had
[1:56:33] addictions we couldn't get out of. We
[1:56:35] had family problems. We made a mess out
[1:56:37] of our life. We couldn't help ourselves.
[1:56:40] Well, that last time watering,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; he throws something on your hand,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; throws something on your finger,
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; throws something around your neck,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; and then he asks the question,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; whose daughter?
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you tonight?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray
[1:56:59] thee. He's asking her, where did you
[1:57:02] come from?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; What is your lineage?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; What is your bloodline?
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I know strange, but look at the way she
[1:57:11] answers.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "What is thy name?" He asks
[1:57:14] her, "What's your name? Whose daughter
[1:57:16] are you?" She could have just said,
[1:57:17] "Well, I'm just Rebecca." But she
[1:57:19] doesn't just say, "Rebecca,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; but she says, I'm the daughter of
[1:57:24] Bethu."
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; The son of Mila, which she bare unto
[1:57:28] Nahor, which is Abraham's brother.
[1:57:33] Whenever the devil goes to circling
[1:57:35] around your life,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; he's not trying to ask you what your
[1:57:40] natural name is,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; but go ahead and give him your spiritual
[1:57:43] pedigree.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Let him know I'm bloodbought. I'm water
[1:57:47] baptized. I got the Holy Ghost from the
[1:57:50] top of my head to the bottom of my feet.
[1:57:52] I've been saved by the blood of Jesus.
[1:57:55] I've been born again. He took my sins.
[1:57:57] He took my iniquity. He washed them in
[1:57:59] his blood. That's who I am tonight. If
[1:58:02] anybody ask you who I am, tell them I
[1:58:05] am.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; She tells him exactly what was told to
[1:58:16] father before Eleazer ever left.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; She tells him exactly what he needs to
[1:58:27] hear.
[1:58:30] Fast forward. It drives my family crazy.
[1:58:32] I listen to things and fast forward. I
[1:58:34] preach fast, talk fast, listen fast. We
[1:58:37] listen to the the broadcast of the news
[1:58:39] coming down the road.
[1:58:42] Oh, Lord mercy, it's going to rain.
[1:58:45] So, let's just listen and fast forward.
[1:58:51] She leaves and goes to her house.
[1:58:54] She went there with nothing on her
[1:58:56] wrist, nothing on her ears, no faith by
[1:58:58] hearing, nothing on her hands. But when
[1:59:01] she comes back,
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; it's hard not to feel good about what
[1:59:05] God gives you.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Kind of like that preacher one time, you
[1:59:09] don't think I'm blessed, look at my
[1:59:10] blessings.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when she comes walking
[1:59:15] into the house, she's got this jewelry
[1:59:18] draped all over her.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I can imagine come up and said, "Where
[1:59:22] did you get all that.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Come see a man.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, come see a man.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; She come wearing the blessings of
[1:59:36] Abraham.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible said when she got done
[1:59:41] watering, the damel ran and told the
[1:59:45] mother's house the things that had
[1:59:46] happened unto hers. And let me just say
[1:59:49] this, she wasn't just telling them that
[1:59:51] she received something. She had an
[1:59:53] evidence.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; She had an evidence that what she heard
[1:59:57] is right. What she's hearing is real.
[1:59:59] What she believed is the truth. She's
[2:00:01] wearing her evidence. Brother and
[2:00:03] sister, don't you realize you are
[2:00:05] adorned with the word of God for this
[2:00:07] hour? And you are wearing your blessings
[2:00:09] around. You've been dressed by the word
[2:00:11] of this hour. Faith has come by hearing
[2:00:14] of the word of God. You've been adorned
[2:00:16] by the word.
[2:00:22] Laban comes out there. Everybody knows
[2:00:24] who Laban is. Ask Jacob. He'll tell you.
[2:00:28] She said, "What did you do to get all
[2:00:30] that? You'll never believe it.
[2:00:33] What did you do to turn that?" I didn't
[2:00:35] really do much myself. I gave him a
[2:00:38] drink, watered a few camels. I got
[2:00:42] I mean, I'm trying to Oh, look at my
[2:00:45] drip, honey. I'm dripping tonight. I got
[2:00:49] bling on top of bling and bling inside
[2:00:51] of bling.
[2:00:55] Come see a man that told me.
[2:00:58] And Laban says, "I'll find out if this
[2:01:00] is real."
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Laban leaves the house and goes down to
[2:01:04] the well.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says,
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; "Let me quit. There stood the man."
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And the Bible interjects this. There
[2:01:12] stood the man
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; by the candles.
[2:01:18] something about these camels.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Now, he couldn't give everything to her
[2:01:23] at the well
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; because that was a public display.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; But once he goes into her house,
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about first pool. I'm
[2:01:34] not talking about second pull. But when
[2:01:36] the third pull, remember in the secret
[2:01:38] place,
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; it will not be a public show. Once he
[2:01:42] goes into the house, he begins to adorn
[2:01:45] her and give her everything that he has
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; and the servant brought forth jewels of
[2:01:52] silver, jewels of gold and raignment and
[2:01:54] gave them to Rebecca unmarited
[2:01:57] favor.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; And then he asks her that question.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; He said, I will inquire and ask the
[2:02:07] damsel from her own mouth.
[2:02:10] I want her to say it.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; That means she cannot remain silent. She
[2:02:14] has got to answer at the right time of
[2:02:15] the right day. And he said unto her,
[2:02:18] "Will you go with me?" And her answer
[2:02:22] is,
[2:02:23] "I will go."
[2:02:26] But Rebecca, you've never seen him. Oh,
[2:02:28] I've seen him.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's something in
[2:02:31] here I cannot fully explain.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; But I think this is what I'm called to
[2:02:36] do. I mean, it's hard for me to explain
[2:02:39] it to Laban and and mother and father.
[2:02:40] It's it's it's hard to explain to
[2:02:42] sister, but all I know is something's
[2:02:44] happened to you
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm willing to go.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Rebecca rose her and
[2:02:49] her damsels and they rode up on the
[2:02:51] camels
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; and followed the man.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to follow men.
[2:02:59] Everybody's followed men.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're following the
[2:03:02] right man.
[2:03:04] She followed the man and the servant
[2:03:06] took Rebecca and went his way. Oh,
[2:03:08] hallelujah. And Isaac, listen to this.
[2:03:10] Watch the other side. Now, let me close.
[2:03:12] Watch Isaac. And Isaac came from the way
[2:03:15] of the well of Lahore. For he had dwelt
[2:03:18] in the south country. But he comes to
[2:03:20] the well. Look where this meeting is
[2:03:22] going to be at. He's going to meet
[2:03:24] Rebecca at another well.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; And this well is called the well of the
[2:03:31] living one. seeing me.
[2:03:36] So, she's going to the living well, and
[2:03:39] that's where the meeting in the air is
[2:03:40] going to be at. Isaac is going to see
[2:03:44] her at the well of the one who is seeing
[2:03:46] me.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; So, she's going to an inexhaustible
[2:03:50] well, a fountain of attributes, and
[2:03:52] she's going to meet him. Listen friends,
[2:03:54] our Lord will not meet us upon this
[2:03:58] earth,
[2:04:00] but God has a meeting place already
[2:04:03] prepared.
[2:04:05] And the Bible said, "And Isaac went out
[2:04:06] to meditate in the field at the evening
[2:04:09] tide.
[2:04:11] And he lifted up his eyes, and he saw
[2:04:15] the camels were coming."
[2:04:19] You think you've been anticipating?
[2:04:21] What about Isaac?
[2:04:25] Can you imagine what at one time was
[2:04:28] just thought in memory and mind, but now
[2:04:31] it's year after year it's had to
[2:04:33] manifest this and then he had to do this
[2:04:35] and then they backslide. He had to pick
[2:04:36] them up. They backslide. And God's done
[2:04:38] this for 6,000 years. But now it's time
[2:04:41] to meet her. The anticipation in his
[2:04:44] heart. Can you imagine? Can you imagine
[2:04:46] natural Isaac his blood pressure going
[2:04:48] up thinking the camels are coming and
[2:04:52] I'll say this Isaac recognizes daddy's
[2:04:55] camels
[2:04:58] and whenever they got close Rebecca says
[2:05:03] what man is this that walketh in the
[2:05:05] field to meet us I bet they'd seen a
[2:05:09] many men along that road but this one
[2:05:11] looks different and the servant has said
[2:05:14] it is my master. Therefore, she took a
[2:05:18] veil
[2:05:20] and covered herself.
[2:05:22] So, the meeting in the air, there's
[2:05:24] going to be a change of veils.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a change of veils.
[2:05:35] And the Bible says, "And Rebecca lifted
[2:05:37] up her eyes." Isn't that something?
[2:05:39] Rebecca lifted up her eyes and Paul
[2:05:41] said, "You'll be changed in a moment, in
[2:05:43] a twinkling of a
[2:05:46] And when she lifted up her eyes, she saw
[2:05:48] Isaac.
[2:05:49] And the way the program explains this is
[2:05:52] as she's coming that Eleazar didn't even
[2:05:54] have time to stop the camels, but the
[2:05:56] Bible said she lighted off the camel.
[2:06:01] She jumped. She didn't even wait to be
[2:06:03] lowered down as a as a real lady would.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; The anticipation was so great,
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; she didn't want to wait another second.
[2:06:12] You know how impatient you be? I'm ready
[2:06:13] to go. And the honey sitting in the car
[2:06:14] and you're sitting there going, "All
[2:06:15] right, baby. Let's go. Let's go. Let's
[2:06:16] go. Let's go. Let's go." Can you
[2:06:18] imagine? She doesn't even wait for the
[2:06:20] car to get stopped. Slings the door
[2:06:22] open. She jumped off the camel. And said
[2:06:25] she met him in the middle of the field.
[2:06:29] And he said, "That's where the bride's
[2:06:30] going to meet him at, in the middle of
[2:06:33] the air."
[2:06:35] Isaac had left the field, had left his
[2:06:37] tent, was meditating in the field that
[2:06:38] afternoon. He saw Rebecca coming
[2:06:43] She never saw him before. She never saw
[2:06:45] him. But it was love at first sight. She
[2:06:47] fell in love with him and he with her.
[2:06:49] And she was even veiled. But he fell in
[2:06:53] love with her. And when she seen him,
[2:06:56] her heart was so full of joy. She didn't
[2:06:59] know who she was going to marry, but by
[2:07:01] faith she believed. And Bar said, "When
[2:07:03] Jesus leaves the kingdom, we'll meet the
[2:07:05] king in glory. will meet even the air
[2:07:07] between the heavens and the earth where
[2:07:08] it's been expanded to be able to redeem
[2:07:10] us. And he'll meet Rebecca, listen,
[2:07:13] between his home and hers.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. I want to go, don't
[2:07:22] you?
[2:07:24] Listen, friends, I don't know how you
[2:07:25] feel. Whatever I got to do to make it,
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; I've got to make this.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I don't care what I got. I don't want to
[2:07:35] miss this. Whatever you got to do,
[2:07:37] whatever you got to sacrifice in life,
[2:07:39] what does it matter for that one
[2:07:41] meeting?
[2:07:43] The prophet tells us the very camels
[2:07:45] that Rebecca watered was the very word
[2:07:48] that took her to meet her bridegroom,
[2:07:50] Isaac. I say tonight, don't you quit
[2:07:52] watering. Don't give up. I don't matter
[2:07:55] how many battles you went through,
[2:07:56] trials in your life, and it may look
[2:07:57] like it's totally impossible. I'm
[2:08:00] telling you, there's coming a meeting.
[2:08:05] The anticipation is so great. We've
[2:08:08] heard about him, preached about him,
[2:08:10] talked about him, fellowshipped about
[2:08:12] him. We've been in services like last
[2:08:14] night when the presence of God comes
[2:08:15] down so strong and your heart melts in
[2:08:17] his presence. What's it going to be
[2:08:19] where it won't be temporary well visits?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; But whenever you move into his presence,
[2:08:27] when I get done preaching in just in a
[2:08:29] few minutes, I'll go to the back room.
[2:08:31] I'll leave the anointing that is up on
[2:08:33] me. It'll just start leaving me and
[2:08:35] start drifting away. What's it going to
[2:08:37] be when it never leaves you again?
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; The excitement that you feel them, some
[2:08:43] people don't even understand, brother,
[2:08:44] why in the world do you preach so hard?
[2:08:46] You're bold as a line. Why are you bold
[2:08:49] as a line? He's the lion of the tribe of
[2:08:51] Judah.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; And you can't help it. You don't want
[2:08:55] nobody to miss it. You don't want from
[2:08:57] the smallest to the greatest. Let nobody
[2:09:00] miss it.
[2:09:04] I've got to make it more than anything
[2:09:05] else. Oh, let's just bow our heads
[2:09:08] today. Oh my. Maybe you're in your this
[2:09:10] place. Maybe maybe you're having trouble
[2:09:13] watering the camels. What should you do?
[2:09:15] Maybe something in the word tonight has
[2:09:17] moved your heart. Young man, young lady,
[2:09:20] maybe you not been where you need to be.
[2:09:22] I want to tell you tonight, just take
[2:09:25] another trip down to the well.
[2:09:28] Fill up your picture tonight. Don't
[2:09:30] leave here empty. Why would you leave
[2:09:32] here empty? Leave here as full as you
[2:09:36] can leave. When these meetings are over,
[2:09:40] whenever you get done, say, "Lord, I'm
[2:09:41] going to leave here with everything I
[2:09:44] can take. I'm taking every ounce of this
[2:09:47] water, and I don't want to spill a drop
[2:09:48] of it." Maybe you've been battling,
[2:09:51] struggling in life. I want to tell you,
[2:09:52] there's help for you tonight. I believe
[2:09:55] that almighty God, he will answer your
[2:09:58] prayer that you've been praying about.
[2:10:00] The things that you've been mentioning
[2:10:01] before him, God can answer that prayer.
[2:10:04] Young lady, you needing a husband, young
[2:10:05] man, you need a wife. I believe that God
[2:10:07] can answer that prayer tonight. You got
[2:10:09] a sickness in your body. I believe that
[2:10:11] God can answer that for you. Remember
[2:10:13] who we serve. Remember how powerful he
[2:10:16] is. The Bible says you have not because
[2:10:19] you ask not. But if you're going to ask,
[2:10:22] ask abundantly.
[2:10:26] Hallelujah.
[2:10:27] Father, we thank you tonight, Lord, for
[2:10:29] your word. I want to say, Lord, how
[2:10:32] great you are.
[2:10:34] Lord, out of all the people that you
[2:10:35] could have drawn, I want to tell you,
[2:10:38] Lord, I'm so humbled.
[2:10:41] Lord, I'm so humbled that you've opened
[2:10:43] my eyes. I want to say thank you
[2:10:46] tonight. Lord, I can truly say it's not
[2:10:49] my grandpa's religion, though my grandpa
[2:10:52] believes it. It's not my daddy's
[2:10:54] religion, though my daddy believes it.
[2:10:56] But I can tell you, Lord, that angel has
[2:10:58] pulled on my heart. Something on the
[2:11:01] inside has been stirred, and I can't get
[2:11:03] away from it tonight. Lord, I can't move
[2:11:05] away from it. Something's moving me.
[2:11:08] It's greater than my flesh. It's greater
[2:11:09] than my mind. It's greater than my
[2:11:11] humanity. Tonight, I feel, Lord, a pull
[2:11:14] on the inside. I thank you tonight,
[2:11:17] Lord. I want to give you praise, Lord.
[2:11:20] Father, I ask on behalf of your children
[2:11:21] tonight, each one. Father, you see the
[2:11:24] needs under every hand. In the name of
[2:11:26] Jesus, we appeal to our high priest

[2:11:42] flesh. We reach higher than our own
[2:11:44] thoughts tonight. We reach to get a hold
[2:11:46] of you, Father. Father, we resent the
[2:11:49] enemy tonight. Satan, you was defeated
[2:11:51] 2,000 years ago, and you're still
[2:11:54] defeated tonight. We claim what is
[2:11:56] rightfully ours as children of God.
[2:11:58] Lord, you've given us the promise and we
[2:12:00] claim it tonight, Lord. And we stand
[2:12:02] upon it, Lord. We put our feet upon it,
[2:12:04] and we believe it with all of our heart.

[2:35:12] is like gold.

[2:35:21] in my soul.
[2:35:23] I said, "My God is real, for I can feel
[2:35:28] him in my soul."
[2:35:36] Amen. How many's been touched by the
[2:35:38] Lord tonight? Amen. What a powerful,
[2:35:42] powerful message.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to talk about that angel
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; before Rebecca ever came to the well.
[2:35:51] There was an angel that was preparing
[2:35:53] everything just to lead her down to the
[2:35:56] well. Man, isn't that powerful? Here she
[2:35:58] took off towards the well. You can just
[2:36:00] hear that angel calling out, "Don't
[2:36:02] forget the picture.
[2:36:04] She's got a she's got something to do
[2:36:06] down there at the well." And he equipped
[2:36:08] her with what she had need of. And we we
[2:36:10] come to this to worship and to entertain
[2:36:14] him. Amen. To pour our praise out before
[2:36:18] God. And the very thing that we're
[2:36:20] entertaining is the very carry us out of
[2:36:23] this world.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever you're doing, it's not
[2:36:26] in vain. There wasn't one ounce of water
[2:36:28] that she carried that was in vain. Every
[2:36:30] ounce of it had a purpose. It would
[2:36:32] carry her home.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; So friends, let me tell you, whenever
[2:36:34] the bucket gets heavy, just keep
[2:36:36] drawing. What a powerful message. How
[2:36:38] many enjoyed that message tonight?
[2:36:45] I tell you one of these days and it
[2:36:47] might be tomorrow.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; I just happen to still believe that
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; we may not and just wake up in the
[2:36:53] morning look down and you don't look
[2:36:56] like your hands start look a little
[2:36:57] different. Your feet look a little
[2:36:59] different. Brother Dave, you're going to
[2:37:01] look a lot different.
[2:37:04] A lot of things are changing. We're
[2:37:06] going to be called out of this old body,
[2:37:08] this old robe of flesh and given a new
[2:37:11] body.
[2:37:12] You say, "How do you know that?" Well,
[2:37:13] let me tell you, the same God that
[2:37:15] created this one certainly is still a
[2:37:16] creator.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what a prophet said. He
[2:37:19] said he's over there right now building
[2:37:21] a city for you. Said he's building right
[2:37:24] now. And how is he building it? He said
[2:37:26] it's to her liking.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Just to her liking. So you'll be
[2:37:30] satisfied with it. What God is creating
[2:37:32] for you, you'll be satisfied with it.
[2:37:34] When you walk out of these doors
[2:37:35] tonight, you look up at the stars of of
[2:37:38] the heaven and the moon that's in the
[2:37:39] sky. When you wake up in the morning,
[2:37:41] look at the sun that God created. And to
[2:37:43] think that a God can create that. He
[2:37:44] made that.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; And that same God is making a new heaven
[2:37:47] and a new earth.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new city that'll come down upon
[2:37:51] this earth that we'll we're going to
[2:37:52] live there one day. It ain't a fairy
[2:37:55] tale. It's a reality. That same God.
[2:37:58] Amen. Do you believe that tonight?
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just say certainly been a
[2:38:02] blessing. How many's been blessed by the
[2:38:04] meetings?
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just trust that it's been a
[2:38:07] blessing to you. It's furthered your
[2:38:10] walk with God. It strengthened your
[2:38:11] resolve to to serve God and to believe
[2:38:14] this message. I I believe every one of
[2:38:17] these men of God were sent here to
[2:38:19] deliver the message that they have
[2:38:20] delivered thus far. Amen. We're looking
[2:38:23] forward to end the morning. Brother
[2:38:25] Andrew is going to close our our meeting
[2:38:27] in the morning at 11 o'clock. And uh I
[2:38:30] know that God certainly has some great
[2:38:32] things in store.
[2:38:34] You know, if a prophet said that end
[2:38:36] time evangelism
[2:38:38] was was the shaping of the stones, that
[2:38:40] that's quite a shaper right there. And
[2:38:43] when you're talking about an evangelist,
[2:38:44] they can do some shaping. And a lot of
[2:38:46] these young people that are here and
[2:38:48] many of us that are here and he's had a
[2:38:50] a big impact uh on our life and and many
[2:38:54] of you gave your heart to the Lord
[2:38:55] through his ministry. And so, we just
[2:38:57] look for God to use him in a mighty way
[2:39:00] tomorrow. And and uh you know, it's it's
[2:39:03] He started the meeting. It's just
[2:39:04] fitting that he end it and and God to
[2:39:06] use him and and we we appreciate God
[2:39:08] using every one of these great men of
[2:39:10] God. And each one a different gift.
[2:39:12] Isn't it wonderful? I love hearing
[2:39:14] preachers. I I sit there all night and
[2:39:16] listen to different ministers and how
[2:39:18] they approach the the word differently
[2:39:20] and how they read things differently.
[2:39:22] They see it differently. That's all
[2:39:23] different gifts. And it's just I just
[2:39:26] love hearing good solid gospel
[2:39:28] preaching. And I I appreciate Brother
[2:39:30] David for that. and he's he's always
[2:39:32] been a blessing to me. Always everything
[2:39:35] every time I've ever heard him preach,
[2:39:36] it's something that you remember
[2:39:37] forever. And you know, I I certainly
[2:39:40] pray that the Lord would strengthen him.
[2:39:42] I know he's got to go back home and he
[2:39:45] would strengthen them on their journey
[2:39:47] and be able to go back to their home
[2:39:49] church and and we just want to pray for
[2:39:51] him tonight to draw strength. And I know
[2:39:54] the sisters have some food and things
[2:39:56] that's prepared next door. So, we're
[2:39:57] going to fellowship with everybody. Just
[2:40:00] want to tomorrow service at 11:00. A lot
[2:40:02] of folks have 10. So, it will be 11:00.
[2:40:05] That's our normal Sunday morning time.
[2:40:08] And and so we just look forward to God.
[2:40:10] How many's looking forward to the
[2:40:11] service? Amen. Amen. We just got a right
[2:40:13] to draw together as believers come
[2:40:16] together for a meeting and to fellowship
[2:40:18] around the word of God. And so we we
[2:40:20] certainly look forward to that. Let's
[2:40:22] just bow our heads together. And as you
[2:40:25] remember the upcoming service, remember
[2:40:27] brother David. Gracious heavenly father,
[2:40:30] Lord, we are so thankful for an
[2:40:33] opportunity, Lord, to come and hear the
[2:40:35] word that you've spoke to us tonight.
[2:40:38] Lord, how fitting that it is to hear the
[2:40:41] story of Rebecca. And Lord, knowing that
[2:40:44] that very call of God that came to our
[2:40:47] life, Lord, that you had already given
[2:40:49] us what we needed to respond to it.
[2:40:51] Lord, how many maybe would hear the same
[2:40:54] call, but they wouldn't have the same
[2:40:56] response. But I remember the teaching of
[2:40:58] of the prophet of God, how he would show
[2:41:01] us that our response is what identified
[2:41:03] who we were. And Lord, I just thank you,
[2:41:05] Lord, for that kind of response, Lord.
[2:41:07] And I thank you for the vindication of
[2:41:09] the identification of the bride of Jesus
[2:41:12] Christ, Lord. how much it means to us to
[2:41:14] know who we are and to be able to find
[2:41:16] our place in the scripture and have our
[2:41:18] identity. Lord, in a a time when the
[2:41:21] world is searching for that very thing
[2:41:23] and don't know who they are or where
[2:41:25] they're from and but God, you've given
[2:41:27] us a true identity. Lord, I pray, Lord,
[2:41:30] that that's been opened in the minds of
[2:41:32] the people, Lord, through this meeting.
[2:41:33] And Lord, I pray that they've been
[2:41:35] strengthened. Lord, I pray that you
[2:41:37] would help us as we go from this place.
[2:41:39] Lord, may we continue to grow draw
[2:41:41] strength from your word and God bring us
[2:41:43] back safely in the morning. Lord, we
[2:41:45] pray for the food, Lord, that is
[2:41:47] prepared next door that you would bless
[2:41:48] it. Lord, I pray for the time of
[2:41:50] fellowship. Lord, give each one strength
[2:41:52] now. We ask we go from this place, Lord,
[2:41:55] let us continue to feed upon thy word.
[2:41:57] We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:42:01] Amen. God bless you as you go tonight.
[2:42:04] Well, I'm laying up my treasures in the
[2:42:07] home above.

[2:42:55] day and night. I'm getting ready to

[2:43:03] of his saving grace. In each earthly
[2:43:07] trial, his love I can trace. I'm sure
[2:43:11] that up in heaven I will find my place.
[2:43:15] I'm getting ready to leave this world.

[2:43:35] ready to leave this world to prepare a
[2:43:40] mansion. Jesus said, "I'll go." If it
[2:43:44] were not true, I would have told you so.
[2:43:48] Well, just a little while to linger here
[2:43:52] below. But I'm getting ready to leave
[2:43:56] this world. Well, I'm getting ready to
