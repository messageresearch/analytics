together and my just have a yourself a little Jubilee and I've had that all day long and I hope and pray that I can minister to you and it'll be a blessing to the Saints here this evening you got your Bibles I'd like you turn to Genesis chapter 22 this is a really familiar um scripture here 22nd chapter the 17th verse and we also would like you to turn to Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 through 20 after this can you say praise the Lord amen said in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply the seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies praise the Lord also Hebrews is the sixth chapter let's start at verse 13 says for when God God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee and so after he heard patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verely swerve by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly show unto The Heirs of his promise the immutability of his counsel and he confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things it is impossible or by by two immutable things is possible God to lie which may have strong consolation who may flee to Refuge to lay upon the Hope set before us which hope we have is as an anchor of the Soul ain't you thankful for this both sure and steadfast which entered into it within the veil whether the Forerunner is is for us has entered even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of MDC amen God bless you can we just bow our hearts for a moment of prayer and Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for the hour that we're living in the presence that's here this evening father Lord we ask you to come in a special way and manifest yourself Among Us us Lord and Lord speak to our hearts once again Lord as our hearts burn within us Lord God to hear from you tonight Lord not just a another church service or a ritual father but a communication a communion with the father once again today Lord God we thank you Lord that You' given us such an opportunity Lord that we can come and worship you in spirit and in truth Lord we ask you to come take this time Lord God minister to your Saints here we ask heal the sick and Afflicted men the Brokenhearted Lord we commit this service into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says amen God bless you you can have your seats this this evening we realized we took Genesis mainly to get to the part that thy seed shall possess the gates of our enemies and and there in Hebrews the last verse I brother Mark I I I I I love how we can look at things and tie things together and how that it says he's a forerunner somebody that that went before us and made a way he bore our shame he took our shame he took our pain he took our guilt he took our past he took our sin amen he he nailed it upon the cross and he he stepped in in our shoes he became me brother Cody that we become him by grace and that's the way we all are tonight from the pulpit to the back door we all need his grace we all need his Mercy we and we stand here this evening amen a beneficiary of that day at Calvary he took the step of Grace don't be afraid this even to follow forgive me this thing is this thing's popping technology huh man that sounds better I don't know what's wrong with this Andrew used it last can we blame him all right God's good to us man that sounds better I can actually hear something but he took the step of Grace and I thought about that tonight brother Mark the footsteps of the good man are ordered of the Lord and and before you ever get there I've said this many times brother Travis God has been in our past he's working in our future I means something tonight he's already been there amen there isn't a step brother Tom there isn't a step that brother Tom makes that God didn't plant exactly what you have need of in that exact moment what a purpose perfect God what a mighty God we serve tonight you realize that Satan amen he's an author of fear he's an author of confusion amen he's he's nothing but uh but an adversary that wants to implant division implant fear implant he wants to steal your joy and steal your praise and steal your your worship and he amen he wants to kill your influence he wants to kill Grace Tabernacle he wants to kill your family he wants to destroy your life but I've got good news to bring to you as Believers tonight that God already was in our path God has already been in our steps God has already been in our future amen I just believe tonight we are winners I don't care how I feel tonight I don't care what we've been going through the B botom line the bride is predestinated the bride is under a covenant and Satan brings fear to place everything he can in your way to block you from the promises of God oh he's came too late brother Mark Hallelujah i' like to take a thought tonight amen I have given you the land brother Brown says there was Moses Abraham's seed and when he did he said he came to the gate in the line of duty he came to the gate of the Red Sea right in the line of duty he came up against something that he know not what to do Amen brother 10 we can all say Amen to that tonight amen the prophet of God came to a place he did not know what to do he said that was the Red Sea well he said what happened the Seed of Abraham was promised to possess the enemy's Gates so when the Red Sea listen to this phrase see he said when the Red Sea become a gate in other words something between Moses and the promise it became a gate that he couldn't come through but God moved upon the scene and took the gate and went away with it and Moses walked across the sea on dry ground Moses didn't move the gate God did hallelujah amen when we come to those Gates it isn't you and I that's moving the gate it's us coming to the gate and not knowing amen how we're going to overcome and or get across it but if it becomes a gate to you God is interested in that gate amen let me tell you something God is interested in you tonight Brother David the world may not care about Brother David amen you they might ridicule you talk about you standardize your name I'm talking to every individual here today it doesn't matter what people think about me or you it's what Papa God believes in us and I'm telling you he's got confidence in you why because he already seen you he already seen you before there was a star brother amamos before there was an earth before there was a a an enemy he already seen you brother Amos overcoming in such a time as this we frit we get excited we get hard feelings we get our we get things tumbled in our Spirits we all do the prophet of God done the same thing he would tell us of instances amen that he got himself all worked up but at the end of the day amen the anchor still held it's sure and steadfast Hallelujah God moved upon the scene and tued that gate and went away with it and Moses walked across on dry ground his seed possessed the gate Hebrew children possessed the gates of the fiery furnace but can have just a little bit on the monitors possess the gates he said the gates of the fire furn that could not even burn them Daniel possessed the enemy's gates at the lion's mouth that could not open to eat him Samson one time bunch of people had fixed him in the city when he did he pulled those great big Gates out out of the rocks and put them upon his shoulders and walked up to the top of the hill he said why was he he was still the Covenant his locks was still hanging on him and he promised was still there and he possessed the gates of his enemy all these died as fine Warriors of Faith they all died then they came on the scene the super Seed of Abraham he said the Royal seed the super Royal seed Jesus Christ which was Abraham's Fai son that he saw by faith through a promise of God that he would bless all be the father of many nations his super seed came on the scene what did these others do they possessed the gates of lions fires and seas and the gates of the city and everything they came they was able to possess the gates because they was promised it brother Matt he said but he said but when it came to death they all had to die now here comes the Royal seed not only did he possess the gates of his enemy but possess the gates of death hell and the grave and he rose up on the third day and he opened up the way he ripped the veil from top to bottom to declare this has nothing to do with man this is God's doing he ripped it from the heavens down to the Earth to let us know that he's still God and he brought a perfect sacrifice amen that we gives us the right gives us us a right to entered in to the holies of holies and he says my seed shall possess the gates of my enemy all all can you say all the gates of his enemy and now we can say brother Travis tonight amen death can't conquer her hey cannot conquer her the grave cannot conquer her no weapons formed against her can prosper amen he said nothing can conquer her she's of this race the power of this sacrifice I come in the volume of the book Hallelujah to do what to take away the first to EXA less thei doing what doing a way they been doing what the bulls and goats couldn't do but the Hebrews tell us but this man once and for all offered up a perfect sacrifice to redeem a fallen man Hallelujah he nailed it and he says in Hebrew their sins and iniquity will I remember no more and his promises brother man can never fail the scripture tell God has set his Tabernacle among us and said I'll walk among you and I'll be your God and you're going to be my people God's promises connect never be defeated God's promises can never but David for never be stopped in the fact of the matter God's promises are yes and amen can I be healed tonight yes and amen every promise God gave is yes and amen amen if you want Deliverance amen if you say God Can I have deliv tonight and the answer would be yes and amen I can do it I already paid for it it's yes and amen Deuteronomy tells us in the first chapter the Lord Our God in the sixth verse says the Lord Our God spake unto us and said you have dwelt long enough in this Mount some times I feel like God speaks to us in that manner we get stuck in some places of Our Lives everybody's different everybody has their issues everybody gets in there as some things bothers me might not brother M bother you brother Matt but things bother you might not bother me Heen but we all get to those place and then God comes down in a song or or Voice or or or a sermon Heen he says hey wake up brother Matt wake up brother Joe it's time to move from this Mount it's time to get up rise it's time to move on you've been here long enough you've been struggling in this area long enough oh ain't something to mope about thank God I have a God that cares enough about me that says Joe you've been moping in that stage way too long thank God when he sends a man of God with a word from a king amen and he says my name but doesn't say my name and he says wake up up Joe you've been struggling too long wake up Joe don't be down there moping it's time to rise and shine for your light has come Step Up Turn you you have dwelt long enough in this Mount turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto the places n there to in the plain in the Hills and the South and the seaside the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon and to the Great River your River your frees behold I like this behold Brother David I I have set the land churches don't set it men doesn't set it good pastors doesn't set it preachers don't set it deacons don't set it late members don't set it I'm telling you amen he set a tabernacle before us he said I'm going to be your God and you're going to be my people amen and our God is not a fairy tale everything that God has done even in the Old Testament with shadows of type saying he's coming he's coming he's coming Hallelujah I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers Abraham ising Jacob to give unto thee and thy seed after them go and possess it it's yours and they had to fight for every inch of the way sister Savannah this ain't a picnic brother Brown said when you receive the Holy Ghost every gun of Hell brother robbert is ain't that you it's ain't that me he said you didn't I didn't join this Army it's not a picnic it's a battle it's a battle amen it's a battle it's a battle with a promise of Victory hallelujah it's a battle but let me reassure you tonight amen you're going to come out on the other side Victorious as Jesus conquered that day at Calvary he conquered the death he conquered the grave he rose on the third day Victorious what God determined in his mind for Jesus's day happened there was no sister Elizabeth there was nothing in time that could actually stop the move that Jesus was in Hell tried to tempt him it didn't move it amen everything they tried to do to stop Jesus never worked and I'm tell you that same demon those same Devils amen is here in the end time amen can't stand you can't stand our church can't stand our pastor can't stand the move of God that's been moving in this Tabernacle don't think for a second that the devil's not trying to stop the move of God but I've got good news we got strong men we got strong soldiers in this house tonight is determined not to let Satan stop what God has started Hallelujah he says they'll fight every inch of the way but it was assured it would be given to them no matter what the results what the circumstances look like it was theirs God gave it to them and they looked at the promise and said of the circumstances they looked at the promise for is yes and amen instead of the problems cuz problems are lying vanities problems are here today and gone tomorrow they're temporal but God is telling us I give you the land brother says the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God has given us when Satan says no our response should be yes and amen I saw that slogan the other day on on Facebook or somewhere it says God's promises are yes and amen it just stirb my soul amen no matter what Satan says here God's promise can never come back void God's promise can never be stopped Abraham received the promised son why because it was a promise we'll get to that in a few minutes hopefully for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we can I have amen we we I put my name there we have a right to for Force the claims upon Satan not against your brother not against your sister not against your mom and daddy but we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say sister Destiny give it back it's not just a slogan it's making Claim by the authority of a king and he has to do it brother B he Satan has not a choice brother Xavier you as a Believer when you make a claim that God has already made for you and when you make a claim against Satan that's right it's not your power you don't have power anyhow you have authority and God gave you authority to make a claim and when you say tonight Satan get off my land give me back my joy give me back my happiness give me back my joy give me back my happiness and you take that claim Satan doesn't have a choice tonight there's breaking news there's a Fox breaking news tonight Satan doesn't have the power to hold it he's only keeping it because you're allowing to keep it but I'm trying to encourage you tonight by the unction of the Holy Spirit to take your ride as a Believer and say give me back my joy give me back my happiness give me back my health and Satan has to do it he said what is it it's enforcing it's enforcing

inheritance so when we come to a place we look for the answer when we don't know what to do or where to turn we only go to the word and we always find our answer in the word of God when you don't know what to say you don't know how to handle it or how to deal with it you find your answer in the word of God how many believes that so we go through the scripture and we find this to be the case the Bible said Heath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say that the Lord is my helper and I will not fear how many say that no matter what any man shall do unto me I will not fear it our answer lies in the word of God you know where fear comes from it comes from the devil anxiety it comes from the devil but our answer lies in the word of God I believe he's given us a way out when you're lonely you can find comfort in Psalms 23 when you're troubled you'll find an answer in second Corinthians brother Mark whenever you're afraid you'll find courage in Ephesians 6 when you're lost you can go to John 14 and find Salvation whenever you have a decision to make James 1 tells us how to find guidance when you're in turmoil Isaiah 26 shows us where peace lays in the time of danger our protections lays in Psalms 91 when we're suffering Hebrews 12 said we'll find relief Hallelujah when you're weary Matthew 11 says you'll find rest in the middle of Temptation James 1 and 12 12 said there's strength when you get complacent and you're indifferent you don't feel like going on said even Galatians that say but there's a warning a calling to the church to put us on our toes and CS us to be able to stand fast I believe that's what we've heard tonight is a call to Stand Fast upon the word of God no matter what you're battling our answer lies within the word amen [Music] Jus is here yes Jesus [Music] Jesus is here and receive yes Jesus is [Music] here Jesus is here oh Jesus is [Music] here oh yes freedom is here yes freedom is here oh freedom is oh and I

followed you I I took a hold of this message and I I've done all that I could to stand for it and I followed you out but whenever it got hard you weren't there and Jesus spoke back to him he said oh friend he said let me tell you something he said when you only seen one set of footprints he said I hadn't left you he said that's the time that I carried you friends if there's only one set of footprints in the sand I say let it be his Lord let me not walk alone but Lord when I don't even know which way to go Lord I pray you'd pick me up and help me on my path help me to make the right
