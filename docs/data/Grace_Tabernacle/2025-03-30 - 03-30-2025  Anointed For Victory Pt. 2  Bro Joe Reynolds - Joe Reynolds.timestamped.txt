[37:46] I bless your name.
[37:52] I give you
[37:56] honor. I give you the
[38:01] praise. You are the
[38:04] [Music]
[38:07] life, the truth, the
[38:12] way. I bless your
[38:16] name. Yes, my Lord. I bless your name.
[38:23] Amen. However, you came to bless his
[38:24] name this morning. Let's all stand as we
[38:27] invite our brother Joe to come and
[38:29] minister to us. Just pull on the gift in
[38:32] his life. Whatever you have need of,
[38:35] just pull it out of him and he'll speak.
[38:37] God will speak right through him
[38:38] directly to you. Let's sing that song.
[38:40] I'm amazed that you love me. Yes, I'm
[38:46] amazed that you love me.
[38:49] Oh, I'm
[38:51] amazed that you
[38:54] care. Through your preious blood, I
[38:58] found
[39:00] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[39:05] all washed away. My sins are washed.
[39:10] I'll sing that chorus once more. Yes,
[39:13] I'm
[39:14] amazed that you love me.
[39:18] I'm
[39:20] amazed how you
[39:23] care. Through your preious blood, I
[39:27] found
[39:28] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[39:33] all washed away. My sins are washed.
[39:38] First
[39:40] verse. Oh, no one knew how alone I was
[39:45] feeling.
[39:47] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[39:51] hide. Although I laughed and said my
[39:55] life was fine without
[39:58] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[40:01] I
[40:02] cried. Oh. Then one day someone told me
[40:07] of your mercy. Aren't you thankful for
[40:09] that? And the love you showed on a hill
[40:12] called Calvary.
[40:15] Oh, there you died and purchased my
[40:20] redemption. When you broke sin's power,
[40:23] set my spirit
[40:25] free. Yes, I'm
[40:29] amazed that you love
[40:32] me. I'm
[40:34] amazed how you
[40:37] care. Oh, through your preious blood I
[40:41] found
[40:43] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[40:47] all washed away. My sins.
[40:52] Let's sing that second
[40:54] verse. Oh yes, it's true. There have
[40:57] been days when I've ever been there
[41:00] before. Lord, you know the many times
[41:03] I've gone astray. Oh, aren't you
[41:06] thankful though? I've learned your love
[41:08] is stronger than my
[41:11] weakness. And your ear is open every
[41:15] time I
[41:16] pray. See, no one else has ever cared
[41:20] for me like you, Lord. Oh, other friends
[41:25] could never be as close to me.
[41:29] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[41:32] tomorrow.
[41:35] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[41:38] need. Sing it to him. I'm
[41:42] amazed that I love
[41:45] you. I
[41:47] [Music]
[41:49] that you
[41:50] came through your preious blood. Oh, I
[41:54] found
[41:56] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're
[42:00] all washed away. All my sins are washed
[42:06] away. That last verse one more time.
[42:10] There days when I failed
[42:13] you, Lord. You know the many times I've
[42:17] gone
[42:18] astray, but I've learned your love is
[42:22] stronger than my own
[42:24] weakness. And your ear is open every
[42:27] time I
[42:29] pray. And no one else has ever cared for
[42:33] me like you, Lord. Don't you believe
[42:36] that this morning?
[42:39] Glory.
[42:42] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[42:46] tomorrow, knowing you are everything
[42:49] I'll ever
[42:52] need. Oh, I'm
[42:55] amazed that you love me.
[42:58] Oh, I'm
[43:00] amazed that you
[43:03] came through your preious blood. I found
[43:09] new and my sins are washed. They're all
[43:14] washed away. All my sins are washed
[43:19] away.
[43:22] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:26] There's power in the blood this morning.
[43:29] There's power in the blood of Jesus
[43:31] Christ. I'm amazed this morning that he
[43:34] thought enough of me to put my name in
[43:36] the lamb's book of life before the
[43:38] foundation of the world. Brother Wesley,
[43:41] there's nothing in time, there's nothing
[43:44] that's happened since the first dawning
[43:46] of the first sunlight 6,000 years ago
[43:50] could ever rob us of our inheritance.
[43:53] cuz he gave us in eternity and nothing
[43:55] in time can rob it from us. Amen.
[43:58] Church, we can allow him to rob a lot of
[44:00] things in our life. We can allow him to
[44:02] rob our joy. We can allow him to rob rob
[44:04] our happiness.
[44:07] He's a thief and he's a robber. But
[44:09] there's one thing about it this morning.
[44:10] The gospel told us he can't rob our
[44:13] inheritance. He can't steal our
[44:15] inheritance.
[44:17] Hallelujah. Nothing in time can separate
[44:19] us from our inheritance. Aren't you
[44:22] thankful for that this
[44:24] morning? Amen. God bless
[44:26] you.
[44:31] Amen. Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord
[44:34] this morning? Thankful for his word.
[44:36] Thankful for his
[44:38] promises. Amen. If you got your Bibles
[44:41] while you're standing, let's turn to
[44:42] First
[44:45] John chapter 2.
[44:49] Last time we was with you, we ministered
[44:51] on anointed for
[44:53] victory and
[44:56] um felt led to go that direction. We if
[44:59] we had a title this morning, we could
[45:00] title it faith in your
[45:03] anointing. First John chapter 2 verse 19
[45:06] says, "They went out from us, but they
[45:09] were not of us. For if they had been of
[45:12] us, they would not no doubt have
[45:14] continued with us. But they went out
[45:17] that they might be made manifest that
[45:19] the way that they were not all of us.
[45:22] But ye have an uncction from the holy
[45:26] one. Aren't you thankful for the
[45:27] uncction? Brother Ram would say that
[45:29] word uncction comes from a Greek word
[45:32] called
[45:33] dynamite. Thank God we have some
[45:35] dynamite from the Holy One. And you know
[45:37] all things. Thank God we can have the
[45:40] mind of Christ to know what he once done
[45:43] with his word.
[45:45] Hallelujah. And nothing can separate us
[45:48] from this uncction that God give us in
[45:51] the hour. It's our holding
[45:54] power. It's our holding power. It's
[45:56] going to hold. Amen. Doesn't matter what
[45:58] we go through in this life. You're
[46:00] sealed with with the baptism of the Holy
[46:02] Ghost. You're sealed to the day of your
[46:04] snatching away of your redemption. Amen.
[46:08] You'll get get on the other side one
[46:10] day, Sister Debbie. Amen. There's going
[46:12] to be loved ones. There's going to be
[46:13] people in previous generations coming to
[46:16] you and saying, "You're from Lady Oia.
[46:19] You're the ones that overcome that
[46:21] wicked age." And you're going to say,
[46:23] "Well, the inoculation held. It wasn't
[46:26] me." But it was the uncction from the
[46:29] Holy One that gave me the power to
[46:32] understand his word and how to overcome
[46:35] in the evil age that we're living in.
[46:36] Aren't you thankful for that this
[46:38] morning?
[46:39] The 27th verse says, "But the anointing
[46:42] which you have received of him abideth."
[46:45] In other words, it remains or stays with
[46:48] you. His word says that I'll never leave
[46:51] you, forsake you, I'll be with you, even
[46:53] in you to the end of the world. But this
[46:55] anointing which you have received of him
[46:57] abideth in you. It's not here today and
[47:01] gone tomorrow. You need not that any man
[47:04] teach you, but as the same anointed
[47:06] teaches you of all things, and is
[47:09] truth. It is no lie, even as he had
[47:12] taught you, you shall abide in him. And
[47:15] now little children abide in him, that
[47:17] when he shall appear, we may have
[47:20] confidence. We shall have faith. We
[47:22] should trust him. We are believers and
[47:26] not be ashamed before him at his coming.
[47:28] If you know that he is righteous, you
[47:31] know that everyone that doeth righteous
[47:33] is born of him. Can we bow our hearts?
[47:36] Lord Jesus, we thank you for this
[47:38] opportunity, Lord, that you've given us
[47:40] sight of glory to come and worship you,
[47:42] Father, in spirit and truth. Lord, we
[47:44] come, Lord God, to give this part of the
[47:47] service unto you, Lord, that you'd
[47:49] minister to the needs of your saints
[47:50] here, Lord God. You are the great
[47:53] shepherd, Lord. We're the sheep of your
[47:54] pasture, Lord. come and have your way
[47:57] and liberty in this service. We commit
[47:59] this time into you in Jesus Christ's
[48:01] name. And the bride says, "Amen." And
[48:04] God bless you this
[48:11] morning. He tells us here in John, he
[48:14] gives us an uncction from the Holy One.
[48:17] And this anointing that you're going to
[48:19] receive is going to abide forever.
[48:23] And the word brother said that here the
[48:26] uncction means dynamite. Dynamite simply
[48:29] means to blow up, to shatter or destroy.
[48:34] Amen. Thank God this morning we have the
[48:36] ability within us that we can shadow our
[48:39] doubt, shatter our weary and shadow our
[48:42] fear.
[48:43] Amen. We realize this morning to make
[48:46] that light up there. Brother Brandon
[48:48] would say, "It takes two things, two
[48:51] materials. It takes the mechanics and
[48:54] the dynamics. It takes a dynamo turning
[48:58] together. It just he says it's just like
[49:01] you." He said, "It it'll make light
[49:05] because there's a source that is
[49:08] channeling the power that's needed for
[49:10] us to have light this morning." He says,
[49:12] "Brother Wesley," he says, "This exactly
[49:15] is the way it is with you. It'll make us
[49:18] light up. It'll make us have faith.
[49:21] It'll make us have power. It'll make us
[49:23] have healing." Amen. When a believer in
[49:26] God gets turning together. Amen. When
[49:29] they get the turning together, it
[49:31] generate the power of his resurrection.
[49:35] Amen. That tells me this morning, Sister
[49:37] Savannah, they couldn't keep Jesus
[49:39] Christ in the grave. Amen. And they will
[49:42] not be able to keep us buried in later
[49:45] and the darkness of this world either.
[49:48] Amen. Because there's a word concerning
[49:50] the church in the evening time. There's
[49:53] going to be light. Amen. If the word
[49:55] said there's going to be light. There's
[49:57] going to be a dynamo somewhere that's
[50:00] going to generate the light that God
[50:02] said was coming. Hallelujah. Aren't you
[50:05] thankful for that? And the auction means
[50:07] to make it light up there.
[50:10] It's a dynamo. We're connected to the
[50:13] source. Ezekiel would say it. It's a
[50:16] wheel in the middle of a wheel. Brother
[50:19] B would say the big wheel turned by
[50:22] faith and the little will turned by the
[50:25] spirit of almighty God. Amen. When they
[50:28] begin to turn together, Amen. It begins
[50:31] to bring things to pass.
[50:35] Amen. and it generates the power of his
[50:39] resurrection. He says, "But the working
[50:41] of the Holy Spirit," he said, "the
[50:44] kingdom of God is in you." God sits on
[50:48] the throne of your heart. He's in the
[50:51] control room. It's a continuous power
[50:55] from the source. He says, "It's
[50:57] controlling your
[50:59] emotions. It's controlling your powers.
[51:02] It's controlling your conceptions. It's
[51:05] contra making you one with him. Aren't
[51:08] you thankful for that power? Amen. That
[51:11] can bring you and I mortals. Amen. Full
[51:15] of failures.
[51:17] Amen. We all make mistakes. If you don't
[51:19] believe so, let's take your wings off
[51:21] and put them in your back pocket this
[51:22] morning. We all come the same way. We
[51:25] was born of sin, shaped in iniquity,
[51:28] came to this world speaking lies. Amen.
[51:31] But this wasn't your first place. Amen.
[51:34] You got you had an appointment in this
[51:36] life. Amen. A predestinated moment of
[51:39] time. Amen. Where you're going to be
[51:41] changed from the creature you once was
[51:43] to the creature you was before the
[51:45] foundation of the world. Yet we're still
[51:48] trapped in humanity. Amen. We're still
[51:50] trapped in this old boy of failures and
[51:52] making mistakes. Amen. But greater is he
[51:55] that's in you. The dynamo, the uncction
[51:58] that God has placed within you. Amen.
[52:01] You may feel like your trial is
[52:02] uncrossable this morning, but hold to
[52:05] God's unchanging hand. I'm here to tell
[52:08] you this morning, this dude will pass.
[52:12] Hallelujah. He's controlling you.
[52:17] Listen, when those
[52:19] 120, I feel his presence here this
[52:22] morning. Amen. When 120 went into the
[52:26] upper room, Brother Brown said there was
[52:28] a bunch of cowards. They was all afraid
[52:30] of the Jews. They were afraid of what
[52:33] they going to say about them. They was
[52:35] worried about what they may do to them.
[52:37] They was worried about what they may
[52:38] take their jobs from them. They was
[52:40] worried about what they may do, talk
[52:42] about them. Amen. Scorn them. Rebuke
[52:44] them. Brother said they went in the
[52:47] upper room, Brother Tom. They barred the
[52:49] windows. They latched the doors. They
[52:52] closed the blinds because they was
[52:54] afraid of what might happen to them. But
[52:58] along about the 10th day, there came a
[53:01] mighty wind.
[53:03] Hallelujah. All of a sudden, there came
[53:06] a sound from heaven like a mighty
[53:09] rushing wind that filled the house where
[53:13] they was at. Amen. And brother Bam said
[53:16] they unbarred the windows. They
[53:19] unlatched the doors.
[53:25] The spirit of doubt was still there. The
[53:28] spirit of fear was still there, brother
[53:30] Amos. Amen. Amen. The Jews were still
[53:33] out there.
[53:35] But the difference was they now have the
[53:37] uncction from the holy one. Amen. The
[53:41] difference was Jesus was in their midst.
[53:46] They unlatched the windows. They unbard
[53:49] the the doors. And they came out with
[53:52] the authority of the king. They came out
[53:56] as witnesses.
[53:59] Hallelujah.
[54:02] Testifying. They was afraid to testify
[54:05] when they went up in the upper room, but
[54:07] they couldn't hold their peace any
[54:09] longer. Amen. When the mighty wind came
[54:11] down from heaven. Oh, don't you feel
[54:13] that way this morning?
[54:17] Thank you, young Christian.
[54:23] that gets filled with the Holy Ghost. Oh
[54:25] yeah. You don't have to talk him in to
[54:28] come to church. You don't have to talk
[54:29] him into praising God. You don't have to
[54:31] talk him into being right. You don't
[54:33] have to talk him into loving his
[54:35] neighbor. I'm here to tell you. Amen.
[54:37] It's an uncction from the Holy One.
[54:40] Amen. It changes your conception. It
[54:42] changes the way that you you think.
[54:45] Amen.
[54:47] It makes you believe that all things are
[54:50] possible to them that believe.
[54:53] It makes you have faith in your
[54:57] anointing. Brother would say it like
[54:59] this. That's what power is in the
[55:02] church. Now, you want to know what it
[55:04] is? He says, "But is controlled by law."
[55:07] And that law is keep is isn't keeping a
[55:10] bunch of commandments.
[55:13] We thought that now when we was in
[55:14] Pentecost. Amen. We thought, hey, a been
[55:17] the dos and the don'ts and you don't do
[55:19] this and you don't do that and you keep
[55:21] keeping of the commandments. Amen. That
[55:23] that's not it. He said it's a it's
[55:25] controlled. It's a it's a law of faith.
[55:29] He said all things are possible to them
[55:31] that believe. If you can believe it,
[55:33] whatever God will lead your soul to
[55:35] believe, it's yours.
[55:38] Every place the soldier your foot shall
[55:40] tread upon by faith, God gives it to
[55:44] you. It's your possession, but you have
[55:47] an uncction from the holy one.
[55:50] Hallelujah. And Psalms tells us like
[55:52] this, those that are planted in the
[55:55] house of the Lord, those that are
[55:59] connected to the dynamo,
[56:04] it's not going to be defeated.
[56:06] You might look defeated this morning to
[56:08] your neighbor. Amen. But if you got a
[56:10] true uncction from the Holy Spirit,
[56:12] you're not defeated. Amen. You got the
[56:15] power within you to create a world and
[56:17] go live on it. Are you kidding me this
[56:20] morning? This bride, she's not defeated.
[56:23] She's not a second cousin.
[56:27] Hallelujah. Amen. She has the uncction
[56:29] from the Holy One. She's planted in the
[56:32] house or of the Lord. And the scripture
[56:35] says she's going to flourish.
[56:38] Amen. If you're connected to this
[56:40] dynamo, you're going to grow. You're
[56:43] gonna achieve your
[56:45] promises, sir. You're gonna flourish.
[56:47] You're gonna bud. In other words, you're
[56:49] going to bring forth more of him and
[56:52] less of this, oh boy.
[56:54] Amen. You're going to thrive. Oh yeah.
[56:57] Flourish means to thrive. How many's
[56:59] thriving tonight or this morning? Amen.
[57:02] We're thriving because we're connected
[57:05] to a source that gives us light and
[57:08] gives us strength, gives us anointing,
[57:12] gives us power. We're going to thrive.
[57:14] We're going to fly. We're surrounded by
[57:17] his presence.
[57:19] Like we said last time, amen. We're in
[57:22] victory formation.
[57:25] And if you're in victory formation, it
[57:27] that the enemy had exhausted all of his
[57:30] tricks and everything to get you to
[57:33] lose. He's defeated.
[57:36] Is that what the message taught us in
[57:38] this hour? Amen. We are in victory
[57:40] formation. Amen. Hell is all against us,
[57:43] but heaven is for us and God before us.
[57:47] Who can be against us this morning? I'm
[57:49] here to tell you church, we're not
[57:51] defeated.
[57:52] We are in victory formation
[57:55] connected to a source of life sir that
[57:59] never had a beginning and never have an
[58:01] end. A adios of life.
[58:05] It's bubbling.
[58:07] It's bubbling. When you don't feel like
[58:09] doing it, there's a there's a bubbling
[58:11] inside of you. It generates
[58:15] power. Generates the power of his
[58:18] resurrection.
[58:20] Do you love him? Amen.
[58:23] How many believes he his presence is
[58:26] near us this morning?
[58:28] Listen to this quote
[58:29] here. And your
[58:32] own Can you put your name right there
[58:34] this morning? Are you with me for a few
[58:36] moments? Your own glorified body is
[58:40] standing near you right now.
[58:45] Well, if that don't make you want to
[58:46] shout, maybe I need to go to Baptist
[58:47] church down here. Amen. your own
[58:50] glorified body standing near you right
[58:54] now in Christ Jesus to give you a
[58:58] strength. Think about that. Give you
[59:01] Jesus Christ strength. What is that?
[59:05] It's giving you his ability.
[59:09] The same power that Jesus conquered with
[59:13] is the same power that he's came to
[59:16] bring to his bride. Oh yeah.
[59:19] And he said to that body is standing
[59:22] right by you right now. He says in Jesus
[59:26] Christ to give you a strength or
[59:28] ability. He said like a charge in a
[59:31] battery.
[59:33] Brother man, when you don't feel like
[59:35] it, amen, there is a a glorified body
[59:39] near you right then. You can't escape
[59:42] this church. Amen. As Psalms tell us,
[59:45] everywhere you go, he follows you. He's
[59:48] pursuing after you. Wherever you go to
[59:51] the jungles of Africa, lo, I'll be
[59:53] there. You make your bed in hell. I
[59:56] can't leave you there. Hallelujah.
[59:59] It's with you wherever you go. And when
[1:00:01] you're down
[1:00:03] and you don't feel like your spiritual
[1:00:06] car was going to start
[1:00:10] and your spiritual life is grinding and
[1:00:13] it just you're you're turning the key,
[1:00:15] but it doesn't seem like nothing's
[1:00:17] happening. You're trying to flip the
[1:00:19] light, but there's nothing coming on.
[1:00:24] And your light maybe seem like it's dim
[1:00:27] to you and to your neighbor.
[1:00:32] But all of a
[1:00:35] sudden, brother Benjamin, there's
[1:00:38] something next to you.
[1:00:41] I can't explain it. Brother B said, "It
[1:00:44] goes against my nature." He says, "But
[1:00:47] it's a fornowledge of God taking place."
[1:00:50] It's his fornowledge taking place. Amen.
[1:00:53] You don't know when you're in most need
[1:00:55] of it. You're ready to give up. But God
[1:00:58] rich in mercy. He knows exactly when you
[1:01:00] have need of and that the that glorified
[1:01:04] body standing right there to give you a
[1:01:06] spiritual charge that you need. Oh, it
[1:01:10] might just be a song, Brother Joe, that
[1:01:12] you're driving down the road to work.
[1:01:14] There's a song. Amen. You just had so
[1:01:17] happened to turn the radio. But God rich
[1:01:20] in mercy before the foundation of the
[1:01:23] world planted that song there for such a
[1:01:26] time as this. Amen. I believe this
[1:01:30] morning he designs a service, a minister
[1:01:32] for such a time as this to give you a
[1:01:35] spiritual charge this morning to let you
[1:01:38] know you can't, but God can.
[1:01:42] Hallelujah. Yeah, we're
[1:01:45] anointed. He says a charge going into a
[1:01:48] battery. The Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:01:52] Spirit's in you.
[1:01:56] It's to charge your body.
[1:02:01] What a message of the hour. What a
[1:02:04] quote. I believe I could have read this
[1:02:06] quote and closed.
[1:02:09] your own glorified body standing near
[1:02:12] you right now in Christ Jesus to give
[1:02:15] you a strength like a charge going into
[1:02:17] a battery. The Holy Spirit is in you is
[1:02:20] to charge your body to give you a new
[1:02:25] strength to give you the ability to
[1:02:29] overcome. Yes, sir. We're justified in
[1:02:32] his sight
[1:02:34] as though you've never done it.
[1:02:39] We are justified. Can we say amen to
[1:02:42] that this morning? He said we are his
[1:02:47] victory. Amen.
[1:02:50] The church is his victory. We come forth
[1:02:53] in the last days with a glorious gospel
[1:02:56] showing his victory. He died for this
[1:03:00] purpose. We are proof of his victory.
[1:03:06] Look around you this morning. This is a
[1:03:08] proof that God's not dead.
[1:03:12] He's alive.
[1:03:17] How many's got hands this morning?
[1:03:20] These are the only hands that he has
[1:03:21] right here this morning. This is the
[1:03:23] feet that he has right here this
[1:03:25] morning.
[1:03:27] He's standing right there. And he goes,
[1:03:29] the message teaches it goes a little
[1:03:31] deeper than that. The Holy Spirit is
[1:03:33] within you. Oh, yeah. And it's sealed.
[1:03:37] He's sealed on the inside and that old
[1:03:39] line devil sealed on the outside. And
[1:03:42] there's no way that he could ever break
[1:03:44] the seal. He's not made out of stuff.
[1:03:48] Can break the penetrate the seal of
[1:03:50] almighty God.
[1:03:53] God gave it to you. The world can't take
[1:03:56] it away. Brother Joe, God gave you the
[1:03:58] Holy Ghost. Brother Matt didn't give it
[1:04:00] to you. A church didn't give it to you.
[1:04:03] But God who is rich in mercy gave you
[1:04:06] the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:09] Hallelujah. It's proof of his victory.
[1:04:13] Yes, sir. Brother Ben, it's proof that
[1:04:17] God's not dead. He's alive. Listen to
[1:04:20] this quote.
[1:04:23] Notice that maybe he's getting trying to
[1:04:25] get our attention here. Notice
[1:04:28] Notice the vindicated word.
[1:04:32] You know what vindicate means? To prove
[1:04:35] it's right.
[1:04:38] The vindicated word in his body. Yes,
[1:04:41] sir. It's vindicated.
[1:04:45] When Jesus rose from the dead, he
[1:04:48] vindicated.
[1:04:50] He proved that God's word was truth. But
[1:04:53] Jared, you my soul. Amen. I in three
[1:04:58] days I'm going to rise again. This body
[1:05:02] cannot see corruption.
[1:05:04] When he rose, when the dawning of that
[1:05:06] third day at the rising of the su dawn,
[1:05:11] amen, church, something be to happen in
[1:05:14] the tomb.
[1:05:16] Hallelujah. Amen. At the in the hour
[1:05:19] that we're living in, he said it's a
[1:05:21] dull sunrise. Oh, this is fresh this
[1:05:24] morning. Amen. And then he said, "Not
[1:05:26] only is it the su n dawning, but he said
[1:05:29] the s o n is dawning upon our lives."
[1:05:34] Yes, sir. And though they couldn't keep
[1:05:37] the the son of God in a tomb when the
[1:05:41] rose, neither are they going to keep us
[1:05:44] buried in Lady Oia either.
[1:05:47] What a resurrection that was. And what a
[1:05:50] resurrection this is this morning.
[1:05:54] Amen.
[1:05:55] vindicated. The vindicated word is in
[1:05:59] his body.
[1:06:03] It's his very victory and the reason for
[1:06:06] his death
[1:06:08] vindicated
[1:06:11] scripture. We're part of it.
[1:06:15] Should they behold I sin unto you?
[1:06:19] Hallelujah. I'm right there. I'm a part
[1:06:22] of this vindication. Oh yeah,
[1:06:26] we're the Juliet.
[1:06:29] He's the Romeo.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. And it's a secret catching
[1:06:34] away. Right in the midst of Leosia, the
[1:06:38] darkest of darkest, the evil of evil.
[1:06:42] Right in the midst of Satan's Eden, the
[1:06:46] S N dawned.
[1:06:50] Yes, sir. He said it didn't change
[1:06:52] everybody.
[1:06:53] Oh, but those dirt that was in housing
[1:06:57] some seed life, the germ seed of life.
[1:07:00] Amen. That God gave you before the
[1:07:02] foundation of the world. Amen. You might
[1:07:05] have been born of your earthly father
[1:07:06] and mother. Amen. You born of I'm born
[1:07:09] of Don and Judy Reynolds. Amen. But this
[1:07:12] wasn't my first place.
[1:07:15] Hallelujah. There's a predestinated
[1:07:18] moment of time. Amen. when the sen was
[1:07:21] going to dawn over that seed life and
[1:07:24] it's going to change me from the
[1:07:26] ridiculous to the sublime.
[1:07:29] Yes sir.
[1:07:31] Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] You are here to prove vindicate that
[1:07:40] this message is truth.
[1:07:43] Hallelujah.
[1:07:45] A vindicated word. a vindicated
[1:07:49] bridegroom
[1:07:50] and a vindicated bride
[1:07:53] to become one. Wasn't that his purpose?
[1:07:57] His three-fold purpose was being. Amen.
[1:08:00] All that was in God, I'm going to pour
[1:08:02] into my son, Christ Jesus. All that was
[1:08:05] in Christ Jesus, I'm going to morph. I'm
[1:08:07] going to pour out. I'm going to empty
[1:08:09] myself out in a many member bride.
[1:08:14] It was the conding sending of God
[1:08:19] that we can vindicate.
[1:08:22] Amen. Oh, somebody's going to vindicate
[1:08:25] his word this morning. I'm here to tell
[1:08:27] you the scripture said, "I'm going to
[1:08:29] have a bride without spot or wrinkle."
[1:08:32] There is going to be a bride that's
[1:08:34] going to vindicate that to be right. I'm
[1:08:36] so glad I can say I'm one of them this
[1:08:39] morning. We're here, church. You're the
[1:08:43] part, amen, that you're playing out.
[1:08:45] Behold, I send unto you. You going to
[1:08:48] vindicate that this message wasn't a
[1:08:52] fairy tale, but it was a reality. It
[1:08:55] come to sweep us home. It was a that was
[1:09:00] born.
[1:09:02] Amen. It was a rapture. He does all
[1:09:04] three in his descension. A shout, a
[1:09:08] voice, and a trumpet.
[1:09:11] G. And this message was a shout to a
[1:09:16] waking a little bride out of a dark
[1:09:20] condition. The same power that shot out
[1:09:23] in the beginning when those seas were
[1:09:25] laying dormant in the earth
[1:09:29] was formed without that didn't look like
[1:09:32] they had any
[1:09:33] hope. But light dawn in a dark
[1:09:38] place and those seas begin to bring
[1:09:40] forth of its own
[1:09:43] kind. I believe we're here vindicating
[1:09:47] the message of the hour. Amen. We're
[1:09:49] here vindicating. Amen. That this
[1:09:51] they're going to have a bride that's
[1:09:53] going to be worshiping and praising
[1:09:56] their king in the midst of so much
[1:09:58] darkness.
[1:10:01] Proving the devil wrong. proving Jesus
[1:10:04] word,
[1:10:05] right? People say, "Well, I got to get
[1:10:09] ready to die." He says, "Oh my, I'm
[1:10:13] getting ready to live."
[1:10:16] The thing of it is, he says, "Get ready
[1:10:18] to live. Live in Christ
[1:10:23] victorious life over sin, death, hell."
[1:10:27] Listen to this. I already have the
[1:10:30] victory. Right. Oh yeah. He's my victory
[1:10:35] and I'm his evidence. He's my victory. I
[1:10:40] am his evidence. What's that saying? I'm
[1:10:43] going to be a vindication.
[1:10:45] I'm going to vindicate his word to be
[1:10:48] true.
[1:10:51] Hallelujah. I am the evidence of his
[1:10:54] victory.
[1:10:57] Yes, sir. It's been spoken. So it must
[1:11:00] be. Hallelujah. Amen. When he said, "Let
[1:11:04] there be light," it was spoken and it
[1:11:07] must be. Amen. He said, "I'm going to
[1:11:09] have a bride in the evening time." He's
[1:11:12] spoken. It must be. And we're arrived,
[1:11:15] church. There's not another age to come.
[1:11:18] This is it. We have arrived.
[1:11:22] Oh, church. Amen. We're not waiting on a
[1:11:25] rapture. We are the rapture. Amen. We
[1:11:29] are beneficiaries of the shout.
[1:11:34] Oh gord. Oh, if you heard that shout, no
[1:11:38] doubt. There's not going to nothing keep
[1:11:40] you from hearing the trumpet of God
[1:11:42] either. There ain't no grave going to
[1:11:46] hold this body down. There ain't no dirt
[1:11:49] going to hold this body down. There's
[1:11:52] not enough darkness and no sin to hold
[1:11:54] this body down. It has been spoken, so
[1:11:58] it must be.
[1:12:02] Hallelujah. We can't escape it.
[1:12:07] Brother Randall, he said, "This
[1:12:10] mortal must put on immortality.
[1:12:15] It's been spoken, so it must be." This
[1:12:19] corruption must put on incorruption.
[1:12:22] It's been spoken, so it must be. He
[1:12:26] said, I got there's going to be
[1:12:28] somebody's going to be a witness. It's
[1:12:30] been spoken. Amen. And it must be. He
[1:12:34] said, there's going to be somebody
[1:12:36] that's going to be translated.
[1:12:38] Somebody is going to walk like Enoch.
[1:12:41] Somebody is going to take a final step
[1:12:44] right out of immortal into immortality.
[1:12:48] And I could say without a shadow of
[1:12:50] doubt this morning, I am one of them.
[1:12:56] Oh, how can you say that? They couldn't
[1:12:58] say it in the under the shuckage. They
[1:13:01] couldn't stand it under some kind of
[1:13:02] tassel somewhere.
[1:13:07] But now he has become me that I could
[1:13:11] become him by grace.
[1:13:16] Amen.
[1:13:17] He said the shuck pulls
[1:13:19] away as you come to relationship as I
[1:13:24] and my father are one. Amen.
[1:13:29] Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] We can't escape it.
[1:13:35] It's been spoken. So it must be.
[1:13:43] He said, "God gives you faith to rise
[1:13:46] from the muck of the earth. Your faith
[1:13:49] overcomes the things of the world." He
[1:13:52] said, "What is your faith?" Your faith
[1:13:54] is the act that God has did in you to
[1:13:58] make you a son of
[1:13:59] God.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah. It's vindicating you. It's
[1:14:05] vindicating his word. Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] You shall receive power, a dunamis
[1:14:12] power. You shall receive a power, a unit
[1:14:16] anointing power, a dynamite power. Yes,
[1:14:19] sir.
[1:14:21] That's going to blow out unbelief.
[1:14:25] He said, "Brother Job, but we have
[1:14:27] treasure in earthly vessels
[1:14:30] that the excellency of the power be of
[1:14:33] God and not of me." Yeah. We are
[1:14:35] troubled on every side. How many can say
[1:14:39] amen to that? We are troubled on every
[1:14:41] side yet not distressed. Why? Because we
[1:14:44] have an uncction from the Holy One. When
[1:14:47] we're ready to give up, he says, uh-uh.
[1:14:50] When I was ready to give up, I was ready
[1:14:52] to give in. There was still something
[1:14:54] kept holding me. Amen. It's the anchor
[1:14:57] of the soul is sure and steadfast.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. We are perplexed but not
[1:15:04] despair.
[1:15:06] Persecuted but not forsaken.
[1:15:09] Cast down but not destroyed. Why?
[1:15:12] Because we got treasure in earthly
[1:15:15] vessels.
[1:15:17] Hallelujah. And God gives you that faith
[1:15:21] as much your faith will be released.
[1:15:24] That's how much power you can have
[1:15:26] because in you dwells the power to make
[1:15:29] heaven and earth. God dwells in you.
[1:15:32] Yes, sir. He said, "You are sons and
[1:15:36] daughters of God."
[1:15:39] Thought you're going to be You are sons
[1:15:41] and daughters of God. And he's right
[1:15:44] there to give you the strength like a
[1:15:46] charge going into a battery. There you
[1:15:48] are. But it's your faith. Jesus said,
[1:15:51] "According to your faith, bid it unto
[1:15:56] me." Oh, faith in your anointing. Mary
[1:16:00] said, "Instead of doubting, brother
[1:16:02] says, "She behold the handsmaid of the
[1:16:04] Lord." Bid it unto me according to thy
[1:16:08] word. He said, "Hallelujah." Oh, that's
[1:16:12] what we need is some more Marys to take
[1:16:15] God at his word. She didn't wait till
[1:16:18] she felt right.
[1:16:22] She didn't wait till she felt a
[1:16:24] sensation.
[1:16:31] Bit it unto me. Bit it unto me according
[1:16:35] to thy word. She started right then
[1:16:40] testifying she was going to have a baby.
[1:16:42] Oh yeah. Hallelujah. Didn't know no man.
[1:16:47] But when she got a visitation from
[1:16:50] Almighty God and she took faith in that
[1:16:53] anointing. bid it unto me according to
[1:16:57] thy word. Amen. And begin to testify, I
[1:17:01] don't know a man, but I'm going to have
[1:17:03] a baby. You're crazy. You've lost your
[1:17:06] mind. But praise God, I've had a
[1:17:08] visitation. I'm here to tell you this
[1:17:11] morning, church, he said, we need some
[1:17:13] more Marys. We've had a visitation in
[1:17:15] this hour to let us know
[1:17:19] we've been pregnantated with the word of
[1:17:22] a king. And where the word of a king is,
[1:17:25] there is anointing. There is a power.
[1:17:28] There is victory. Amen.
[1:17:33] Hallelujah. He's my victory. And I'm his
[1:17:36] evidence.
[1:17:38] Hallelujah. When God takes the Holy
[1:17:41] Spirit and brings the word to you, it
[1:17:45] makes it alive to you, a reality. That's
[1:17:49] your faith. Your faith. Stand up and
[1:17:52] claim it.
[1:17:54] Just stand up and claim it. For God has
[1:17:57] not given you a spirit of fear and
[1:18:00] doubt,
[1:18:02] but of power
[1:18:04] uncction from the Holy One. The word
[1:18:07] there means dynamite. For God has not
[1:18:10] given you a spirit of fear, but of
[1:18:13] dynamite to blow out everything that's
[1:18:16] unlike him. He's standing right next to
[1:18:19] you right now, giving you a charge just
[1:18:22] like a battery this morning. Amen. All
[1:18:24] of a sudden, Brother Tom, those things
[1:18:26] that seemed uncrossable, now you can
[1:18:29] cross it. Those bridges that look like
[1:18:31] you couldn't get over it, now you can go
[1:18:33] over it. Amen. That giant that's been
[1:18:36] tormenting your life has now became a a
[1:18:40] a a scarecrow to you. Yes, sir. And you
[1:18:44] you realized it by the word of a king.
[1:18:47] You ain't got no power on me. You're
[1:18:49] only a bluff. You're only a squatter.
[1:18:51] You have a bow with no arrows. You have
[1:18:53] a you're a bee with no stinger. You are
[1:18:56] defeated. I He's my victory. And I'm his
[1:19:00] evidence.
[1:19:02] Yes, sir. That God's not dead. He's
[1:19:05] alive.
[1:19:06] Bid it unto me according to thy word.
[1:19:11] She took him at his word and began to
[1:19:15] rejoice. Can we have some Marys here
[1:19:18] this morning? Bid it unto me according
[1:19:21] to thy word, she took him at his word
[1:19:24] and began to rejoice.
[1:19:27] He said before, brother uh brothers and
[1:19:30] sister before he even felt life, before
[1:19:32] she even felt life, before she even felt
[1:19:34] pregnant.
[1:19:38] Oh, she begin to voice. Amen.
[1:19:43] Can we have some marriage this morning
[1:19:46] that has faith in the anointing that
[1:19:49] says, "I don't care what this flesh
[1:19:50] says. I don't care what Lady Oia says. I
[1:19:53] don't care what the world is saying for
[1:19:56] me in my house. I'm going to serve the
[1:19:58] Lord. I'm going to rise. I'm going to
[1:20:02] rise by the faith of our anointing." It
[1:20:05] says, "I'm greater." I don't care what
[1:20:07] you're going through. Greater is he that
[1:20:10] is in me, the uncction from the holy
[1:20:13] one, than the Goliath that's in your
[1:20:15] life. Why don't you give a hand clap a
[1:20:18] praise this morning? Hallelujah. He's my
[1:20:22] victory and I'm his evidence. I'm his
[1:20:25] He's my victory and I am his evidence.
[1:20:31] Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] Rejoice. She had to testify about it.
[1:20:40] He said, "As soon as a real genuine
[1:20:47] Christian faith
[1:20:49] anchors in a person's heart,
[1:20:53] listen to
[1:20:54] this. Let them be bound in a
[1:20:57] wheelchair, blind, whatever it
[1:21:02] is, they'll tell it."
[1:21:05] Oh, yeah.
[1:21:06] That's right. He says, "I don't care how
[1:21:09] long they've been bound to a wheelchair,
[1:21:11] how long they've been blind, Brother
[1:21:12] Wesley, they're going to tell it." Amen.
[1:21:15] He said, "We're going to have some
[1:21:16] marries." He says, He says, "That's
[1:21:18] right." He said, "They're going to tell
[1:21:20] somebody, "I'm healed."
[1:21:24] I'm healed. You're still bound in a cot.
[1:21:27] I'm healed. You're still bound to
[1:21:30] feelings. I'm healed. Amen. You're still
[1:21:32] bound in a wheelchair. Extra, extra.
[1:21:35] read all about it. Praise God. I am
[1:21:39] healed.
[1:21:41] Yes, sir. What was Little Blind uh Blind
[1:21:44] Ryan?
[1:21:48] John Ryan was saying, "I'm having faith
[1:21:51] in my anointing."
[1:21:53] God said, "Oh, if we can have some more
[1:21:55] of that." God said I where my feelings
[1:21:59] says God said
[1:22:01] the church said but God says my family
[1:22:04] said but God said
[1:22:08] this too will pass
[1:22:11] hallelujah. How do you know you are
[1:22:13] healed? He said Jesus said so
[1:22:17] and I believe it.
[1:22:20] He said there you are. Oh he said yes.
[1:22:24] Oh, I like to throw that in the devil's
[1:22:26] face. Oh, yeah. When he stood there at
[1:22:28] Mayo's that Mayo's them group of doctors
[1:22:31] around me said, "William Brandom,
[1:22:33] Reverend Brandham, you're finished."
[1:22:38] He said, "But Jesus said, I'm healed."
[1:22:42] Hallelujah. He said, I took him at his
[1:22:45] word. Doctor said, you're finished. But
[1:22:50] God said, I'm just getting started.
[1:22:54] Hallelujah.
[1:22:56] He said, "Yes, I like to push it back on
[1:22:59] him every time I get a chance." Oh, is
[1:23:01] that why we come to church this morning?
[1:23:04] All the baggage that Satan tried to
[1:23:06] attach to us all week long, just put it
[1:23:08] right back in the face. I'm going to
[1:23:10] church anyhow. I don't care what you
[1:23:12] said. I don't care what kind of feelings
[1:23:14] that you raise between me and my
[1:23:16] brothers or sisters. Amen. For me in my
[1:23:18] house, I'm going to serve the Lord.
[1:23:21] Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah. Anyhow, push it right back
[1:23:26] on the devil. He said, "You don't feel
[1:23:28] any better than you ever felt when I
[1:23:30] come out of here." That's why he said
[1:23:31] the devil said to him, "Oh, boy, your
[1:23:34] ears are still hurting. Your back is
[1:23:36] still hurting. Your legs are still
[1:23:37] aching. Your feet are still
[1:23:39] aching." Oh, but God rich in mercy. I
[1:23:43] say God's rich in mercy. He's a healer.
[1:23:47] I'm a vindication of his healing.
[1:23:51] I'm a vindication that God is not dead,
[1:23:55] that he's alive.
[1:23:57] He spoke it. So it must be sir.
[1:24:02] Amen.
[1:24:03] He healed my feet. He's healed my eyes.
[1:24:06] He's healed my ears.
[1:24:10] And he's the same God. And when the
[1:24:12] devil pushes it back on you, says there
[1:24:14] ain't no chance. You don't feel any
[1:24:16] better than you ever felt. He said,
[1:24:18] "Brother V's response said, when I come
[1:24:20] out, come out of there." I said, "Oh,
[1:24:22] boy. If you want to hear me, praise God.
[1:24:24] Just stick around. You'll hear me." Yes,
[1:24:27] sir. I mean, praise him till death shall
[1:24:30] set me free.
[1:24:32] Hallelujah. Feelings ain't going to stop
[1:24:34] my praise this morning. Sickness is not
[1:24:36] going to stop this bride's revival
[1:24:40] till death sets me free. Bid it unto me.
[1:24:44] Faith in my anointing. Faith doesn't
[1:24:46] mean it's not going to rain or storm,
[1:24:48] but it's a direct positive that declares
[1:24:51] this too will pass
[1:24:54] faith in your anointing.
[1:24:56] Instead of seeking external validation.
[1:25:00] Can I have an amen this morning? Instead
[1:25:03] of seeking an external validation, you
[1:25:06] trusting the inner guidance that comes
[1:25:08] from the anointing within.
[1:25:11] I'm not looking at external validation.
[1:25:14] Right. I know I can't overcome.
[1:25:17] I know the enemy is coming in like a
[1:25:19] flood. He's coming in just like he
[1:25:22] always does. He's coming to steal,
[1:25:25] destroy,
[1:25:27] rob, vandalize,
[1:25:30] shake up, break down, break fellowship,
[1:25:34] break unity, break circles. I say let's
[1:25:37] make a circle bigger this morning. Come
[1:25:40] on, Grace Tabernacle. Amen. Get out of
[1:25:42] your comfort zones this morning and make
[1:25:44] our circle bigger. Amen. Let's do
[1:25:47] something for a neighbor, amen, that you
[1:25:49] may not get along with. Let's just do
[1:25:51] something good for them. Let's call them
[1:25:53] up and say how much you appreciate him,
[1:25:54] how much you love him. Let's put it
[1:25:56] right back in the devil's face. You're
[1:25:58] not getting my victory. You're not
[1:26:00] stealing my joy. That's what Shamgar
[1:26:02] did. Amen. He said enough. It was
[1:26:04] enough. He said, "You came in and stole
[1:26:07] my crops year in and year out." Amen.
[1:26:09] But not today, devil. Not today, devil.
[1:26:16] He said, "What do you got in your hand?"
[1:26:17] I ain't no fighter. I'm no warrior.
[1:26:20] Amen. I've never been in a battle
[1:26:21] before.
[1:26:25] But I am circumcised.
[1:26:27] He said, "I'm a part of the promises of
[1:26:29] God."
[1:26:32] And he heard the footsteps of the enemy
[1:26:34] coming in again.
[1:26:37] His wife and children ran to the bedroom
[1:26:40] like before. But there's a righteous
[1:26:42] Indian nation, brother Bram said, was
[1:26:45] building up in Shamgar.
[1:26:48] Not today, devil.
[1:26:50] And he reached over, brother Ed, and he
[1:26:53] grabbed an ox go. Come on, somebody.
[1:26:57] 600 armed, dangerous
[1:27:01] men. and a little farmer
[1:27:04] boy with a little rod with a little
[1:27:08] stick a rock tied to the end of it. Oh,
[1:27:11] it don't take much this morning, church.
[1:27:14] Brother, I preach the message. What do
[1:27:15] you got in your hand? Amen. It doesn't
[1:27:17] take much if when you're striking and
[1:27:19] you're striking with the anointing of
[1:27:21] Almighty God. Oh, church. Amen. Those
[1:27:25] 600 Philistines are coming in like a
[1:27:27] flood. But oh, he said, I've got faith
[1:27:29] in my anointing. I am circumcised. Amen.
[1:27:33] I'm a part of the promise. This too will
[1:27:36] pass. Not today, devil. I've worked all
[1:27:39] year for this. This is my revival. This
[1:27:42] is my time to shine. This is my time to
[1:27:45] jump. This is my time to shout. Yes,
[1:27:48] sir. This is my time. This is the end
[1:27:51] time. Oh, I'm going to let my little
[1:27:54] light shine cuz this is my time. Can you
[1:27:57] imagine what those demons thought? They
[1:28:00] took his joy every year. They just came
[1:28:02] in. They just let him have it. Oh, just
[1:28:05] come on in. Just take everything I
[1:28:07] worked hard for for all these months.
[1:28:09] All all the stuff I had in the barn,
[1:28:11] it's all yours. They just thought it was
[1:28:13] any other year. But Shamgar got a
[1:28:16] revelation. And upon this revelation,
[1:28:19] there wasn't a thousand Philistines.
[1:28:22] There wasn't armored trucks. There
[1:28:24] wasn't atomic weapons could stop a
[1:28:26] one-man invasion. When there was
[1:28:28] anointed, when he had took faith in his
[1:28:31] anointing, it was always there. But he
[1:28:34] needed Shamguard to take faith in his
[1:28:38] anointing.
[1:28:42] You imagine here they come in like a
[1:28:45] flood and here come
[1:28:50] shouting, screaming. Acts
[1:28:53] 2:38 screaming
[1:28:56] baby, screaming to the top of his lungs.
[1:29:00] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[1:29:06] I look outnumbered, but just wait. God's
[1:29:10] going to make this trial a blessing this
[1:29:12] morning.
[1:29:14] That was the first one. Second one,
[1:29:17] church. He was knocking them in the
[1:29:19] heads with an ox gold.
[1:29:23] Could you imagine what the other
[1:29:26] soldiers was thinking?
[1:29:31] I'd say it was a pretty long
[1:29:33] day, but he had an uncction from the
[1:29:36] Holy One.
[1:29:38] I'm not quitting. Amen. He was in
[1:29:40] revival mode. Amen. He felt good. Could
[1:29:44] you imagine the more he took out?
[1:29:50] This is my time.
[1:29:55] If I was that last one, I would have ran
[1:29:57] for dear life after watching
[1:30:00] 599 get struck with a rock with a stick.
[1:30:05] Could you imagine? He was too fast for
[1:30:08] him.
[1:30:12] He was overshadowed
[1:30:14] by the right hand of Almighty God.
[1:30:17] He was
[1:30:18] unsaddled by a rock in a weary land.
[1:30:21] Amen.
[1:30:24] Can I say this? Maybe this is just me.
[1:30:26] They couldn't even see what was coming.
[1:30:31] Brother Daryl Ward say like this old
[1:30:33] runner went
[1:30:35] back to his king. He took notes of
[1:30:39] everything that happened out in the
[1:30:43] battle. And he went back to the king.
[1:30:45] You say, "Oh
[1:30:47] king, we got a bunch this year. Oh
[1:30:50] king, are they getting they they bring
[1:30:53] the wagons full? Oh
[1:30:55] king, sit down for this news." Oh, can
[1:30:59] we have a revival here in 2025 that the
[1:31:03] running can go back to hell and say,
[1:31:05] "You ain't going to believe what's
[1:31:07] happened down there at Grace
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:12] Tabernacle." Amen. That same devil
[1:31:14] that's got the best of you. Not today,
[1:31:17] devil. Amen. That's why you're standing
[1:31:20] here to an overcomer tonight cuz you got
[1:31:23] to the place Shamgard said. Not today,
[1:31:27] devil.
[1:31:33] Smack this morning.
[1:31:39] And you can begin to say, "Devil, you
[1:31:41] ain't going to believe what's happened
[1:31:43] down there at Great Tabernacle. You know
[1:31:46] that sister that we have beat up all
[1:31:48] these
[1:31:50] years, that old hillbilly from Pow Hat
[1:31:52] was up there screaming and snotting and
[1:31:54] carrying on preaching about some of
[1:31:57] these things that William Brandon said.
[1:32:00] And there was a there was a lady out
[1:32:02] there. I tried everything I could. I
[1:32:06] tried the
[1:32:07] babies. I tried the neighbors. I tried
[1:32:10] the song Ben was singing. I tried the
[1:32:14] clapping. I tried to rejoicing. I tried
[1:32:16] to I tried to disrupt the service all I
[1:32:18] could.
[1:32:20] I said the wind tore up the building,
[1:32:22] but now it's going to be a blessing.
[1:32:26] That's what kind of God I serve this
[1:32:27] morning. I tried everything I could do.
[1:32:35] But
[1:32:37] they they begin to hear the word and
[1:32:42] faith come. I ain't going to finish this
[1:32:44] morning, but it's okay.
[1:32:47] Faith cometh by hearing. That's right.
[1:32:50] Hearing the word of God.
[1:32:53] And they begin to draw strength
[1:32:58] like a charge going into a battery.
[1:33:02] They begin to be plugged up.
[1:33:07] They were planted in the house of their
[1:33:10] God, and they're going to flourish in
[1:33:13] the courts of their God. Oh, I'm here to
[1:33:15] tell you that old runner said, "Oh,
[1:33:20] king, he took the first one out. I
[1:33:22] thought it was an accident. He took the
[1:33:25] He took the first hund out. I began to
[1:33:30] wonder. I'm here to tell you that old
[1:33:34] hillbilly from Black Rockck,
[1:33:37] Arkansas beat down every armed soldier
[1:33:42] that we had.
[1:33:47] Who do they join forces
[1:33:51] with? I don't
[1:33:53] know. But there was a strong wind.
[1:33:59] There was a fortress that I've never
[1:34:02] seen before. Yes, sir. There was a
[1:34:05] scream that I had never heard before. It
[1:34:08] was a battle scream. It was a victory
[1:34:11] scream. Listen, church. He had the
[1:34:14] victory before he ever went to find
[1:34:17] knock the first one down.
[1:34:19] Why? Cuz by faith, brother said, he's
[1:34:23] seen the victory. Bit it unto
[1:34:27] me. He said, "No
[1:34:32] wonder." He said, "No wonder." David
[1:34:35] said, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
[1:34:40] not want."
[1:34:42] How he leads us beside the still waters
[1:34:45] and restores their soul and and runs our
[1:34:49] cup
[1:34:50] over. And he anoints us in the presence
[1:34:55] of our enemy. He said, "Did you ever get
[1:34:58] anointed in the presence of your
[1:35:01] enemy?" Just testify till you cut run it
[1:35:04] over. He said, "David," he knew he was
[1:35:08] anointed and was
[1:35:10] vindicated to be a good shot.
[1:35:14] He know that he knew he was a good shot.
[1:35:17] David was anointed. He knew it. And when
[1:35:21] he stood before Goliath, he never cried.
[1:35:25] He said he never cried, "Oh, God, what
[1:35:27] must I do now?" Or, "Wait, no." He said,
[1:35:31] "You, you let me kill a bear. You let me
[1:35:35] kill a lion." But what about this
[1:35:37] Goliath out here? Huh? He never did
[1:35:39] that. He just spoke. What did he say?
[1:35:43] You will be like the bear.
[1:35:48] You catch us this morning. I know it's
[1:35:50] simple. Catch it. You're going to be
[1:35:52] like a
[1:35:53] lion. He says, "And you will be like one
[1:35:57] of them." He spoke and went forward. He
[1:36:00] never prayed a prayer. He never offered
[1:36:02] nothing. He knowed he was anointed.
[1:36:07] Listen to this statement. This is where
[1:36:08] I got my thought. He never prayed a
[1:36:10] prayer. He was anointed. And he
[1:36:12] slingshot has
[1:36:14] proved the right kind of thing. Yeah, he
[1:36:19] had faith in his anointing.
[1:36:23] He had faith in his anointing. He had
[1:36:26] faith that God could direct the rock
[1:36:29] straight to the middle of the helmet
[1:36:31] there where the only place could be hit.
[1:36:38] Are you catching it this morning,
[1:36:41] brother? He wasn't complaining.
[1:36:44] Good
[1:36:45] Lord, that Goliath covered up from head
[1:36:48] to toe. There's only a little no. Oh,
[1:36:51] thank God. There's one little opening.
[1:36:55] You see the difference? He wasn't afraid
[1:36:57] of missing the mark.
[1:37:00] Cuz he had faith in his anointing. He
[1:37:03] knew he wasn't nothing. But he said,
[1:37:05] "You come to me with a shield. You come
[1:37:07] to me with a spear, but I come to you in
[1:37:10] the name of the Lord." He had faith in
[1:37:13] his anointing.
[1:37:16] Oh yeah. He knew he was a good shot.
[1:37:22] The only place he could hit, he was
[1:37:25] standing there. He knew he was a good
[1:37:27] shot. Says Savannah probably
[1:37:30] said, "You know what? When I let that
[1:37:33] go, that crazy rock hit that line just
[1:37:36] where I am.
[1:37:38] I don't know how he done it.
[1:37:41] But thank God he's rich in mercy.
[1:37:46] And he was just a hillbilly, a shepherd
[1:37:49] boy, and said, "If God did it one time,
[1:37:53] I know he can do it again."
[1:37:56] He said he know God made him that. He
[1:38:00] knowed he had killed a lion and a bear,
[1:38:02] but that was earthly father's
[1:38:04] possessions. Here is heavenly father
[1:38:07] possession. He said he didn't get
[1:38:10] down. He didn't get
[1:38:12] discouraged. What must I do now? He
[1:38:14] spoke and said you will be like that. He
[1:38:18] says amen. Glory to God. He spoke and
[1:38:22] went forward regardless of the size,
[1:38:24] regardless of the situation.
[1:38:28] Give me five more minutes.
[1:38:31] Now look here. He says, "Son, he's a
[1:38:33] fighter. He was born to be a
[1:38:36] fighter. You're nothing but a youth.
[1:38:39] You're nothing but a housewife or a
[1:38:42] factory worker. You're nothing but a
[1:38:47] youth. That didn't bother him.
[1:38:51] He knew he was anointed.
[1:38:53] He knew that God that delivered me from
[1:38:55] the line, that delivered me from the
[1:38:57] paws of the bear, he bear, he more than
[1:39:00] able to deliver me from this giant.
[1:39:03] Amen. He met you in the name of the Lord
[1:39:05] God of Israel. He didn't pray through.
[1:39:08] He was already prayed through.
[1:39:11] God prayed him through before the
[1:39:13] foundation of the world.
[1:39:16] He was already prayed through. God
[1:39:18] prayed him through before the foundation
[1:39:20] of the world. He was anointed for the
[1:39:24] job. Oh, I say to you little bride this
[1:39:27] morning. It's a dark lady or see an age
[1:39:29] that we're living in, but you're
[1:39:31] anointed for the job. He has speak and
[1:39:34] go forward, little bride. That's our
[1:39:37] revival this morning. Speak
[1:39:41] be confident of this very thing. He
[1:39:45] which begun a good work in you. He's
[1:39:47] going to bring it to an end. He's a
[1:39:50] determined God to meet the challenge of
[1:39:52] the age. Yes, sir.
[1:39:57] How many believe he's going to meet the
[1:39:58] challenge of the day? Man, I've got so
[1:40:01] much. God's good to us, isn't he?
[1:40:04] I'm going to skip some. Is that all
[1:40:05] right? You mean to tell me that you'll
[1:40:08] let this uncircumcised Philistine, the
[1:40:10] unbelievers, say there's no such thing
[1:40:12] to file the homage of the living God? He
[1:40:15] said, "I'll go fight him." It was a
[1:40:18] paradox. A little boy challenged a giant
[1:40:20] with 14inch
[1:40:22] fingers, no shield, no sword, no
[1:40:26] background, a nobody
[1:40:31] to challenge a man with
[1:40:33] such degrees and armor. He said is a
[1:40:38] paradox. He said you meet the Philistine
[1:40:41] in the name of the Philistine. You meet
[1:40:42] with me with armor, spear, train,
[1:40:45] college. He said, 'But I meet you in the
[1:40:47] name of the Lord God of Israel. He said,
[1:40:49] "That's it. Trust in God. Trust and your
[1:40:54] anointing." Goliath was a begging or
[1:40:58] bragging
[1:40:59] rather. I've never lost a
[1:41:02] battle. I'm head and shoulders above
[1:41:07] all. They had the upper hand. The devil
[1:41:10] thought he had it
[1:41:12] all. But listen to this. You see, you
[1:41:17] was here last night and didn't get
[1:41:20] healed. You was at a meeting and didn't
[1:41:22] get healed. Who is that uncircumcised
[1:41:25] devil? Who is the devil that has no
[1:41:28] relationship with God at all? Who is the
[1:41:30] devil stands with nothing but defeated
[1:41:31] thing before him? His master was
[1:41:33] defeated at Calvary by the Lord and our
[1:41:36] conqueror. He said he's a
[1:41:38] bluff. Christ Jesus stripped him of
[1:41:41] everything. He's defeated. He says, "I
[1:41:44] don't care what's wrong with you." Are
[1:41:46] you hearing me this morning? Yeah. I
[1:41:48] don't care what the odds is, Sister Eve,
[1:41:50] this
[1:41:51] morning. It may be worse than David and
[1:41:54] Goliath, but if it's revealed to you,
[1:42:00] David become fearless.
[1:42:06] Oh, can we have some fearless Davids
[1:42:08] this morning?
[1:42:12] David become
[1:42:14] fearless by faith
[1:42:17] in his anointing. Look Tom, he saw the
[1:42:20] victory.
[1:42:22] He said he saw the victory. Oh bride, by
[1:42:25] faith this morning I see the victory.
[1:42:30] It's the dawning of a new day. Amen.
[1:42:34] Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] Church, David ran to the battle
[1:42:44] because he had faith in his anointing.
[1:42:49] You're going to be like one of them. And
[1:42:52] he took his revival said he took it
[1:42:54] around. Begin to slang it around. Oh
[1:42:57] yeah.
[1:43:00] Charles be to sling that stone of faith
[1:43:02] around.
[1:43:05] And when he let it go, church, just like
[1:43:08] when you let it go this morning, God
[1:43:11] comes down in the power of the Holy
[1:43:13] Spirit and he picks up what you have let
[1:43:16] go and he picks it up, brother Brown
[1:43:19] said, and he speeds it up a thousand
[1:43:22] miles per second.
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:26] Are you hearing me? Just like
[1:43:28] Shamgar, I say that Goliath didn't see
[1:43:32] what was going on. He didn't know what
[1:43:35] was happening. It was so quick. It was
[1:43:38] so fast. It was pinpoint accuracy.
[1:43:47] Glory to God. You talk about a revival.
[1:43:50] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:43:53] That undefeated Goliath begin to
[1:43:55] stagger.
[1:43:58] Oh, church. I see that old squirming
[1:44:01] devil here. He don't like this kind of
[1:44:03] preaching. But we don't really care this
[1:44:05] morning. I tell you, that giant is
[1:44:07] staggering. Amen. Because somebody is
[1:44:10] receiving faith from their anointing.
[1:44:13] [Applause]
[1:44:17] And David runs down cuz the job was not
[1:44:21] finished.
[1:44:22] He goes down and Goliath laying there on
[1:44:26] the ground and he grabs the sword of the
[1:44:30] enemy and he had some uncction from the
[1:44:33] holy one cuz David could not pick up a
[1:44:36] giant sword if he tried to. But brother
[1:44:39] said he picked up the enemy's
[1:44:42] sword. Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] He cut the head of Goliath off.
[1:44:53] Hallelujah.
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:44:56] He picked it
[1:44:59] up and he screamed out great tabernacle.
[1:45:05] God's not dead. He's alive.
[1:45:11] You're not defeated this morning.
[1:45:15] Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] David come fearless. He chopped the head
[1:45:21] of Goliath. Oh yeah.
[1:45:24] Brother B said he held his head up and
[1:45:28] put his foot on that dead body
[1:45:33] and held up the testimony to the rest of
[1:45:35] them.
[1:45:37] See,
[1:45:39] see what God can do if you have faith in
[1:45:43] your anointing.
[1:45:46] Hallelujah.
[1:45:48] And listen what brother Brown brings it
[1:45:50] home. I've got a lot left. We're going
[1:45:52] to close with this. And here the other
[1:45:54] night when that poor little woman from
[1:45:56] Mayo's brothers probably sitting here
[1:45:58] tonight. They done all they could do and
[1:46:02] couldn't find out what was the matter
[1:46:03] with her. They come to hear. The devil
[1:46:06] said, "I've got you. You're defeated.
[1:46:09] You're going to die. But faith cometh by
[1:46:12] hearing.
[1:46:14] hearing the word. She believed God and
[1:46:17] she said she chopped off the head of the
[1:46:20] devil and he hung it up before the
[1:46:23] audience said I was bound by that cot. I
[1:46:27] came in a coward. I came back I come in
[1:46:30] defeated. I came in bearing a
[1:46:33] wheelchair.
[1:46:39] But I'm a witness.
[1:46:41] Amen. I'm a
[1:46:43] vindication. The doctor said I was going
[1:46:45] to die.
[1:46:48] But here's the head of that defeat of
[1:46:50] Goliath. Oh yeah. I'm not going to die.
[1:46:54] I'm going to live.
[1:46:57] Oh, that's a way it is, church. That old
[1:46:59] devil said, "I've got you. You got to
[1:47:01] pass. You're defeated. You can never get
[1:47:04] over it."
[1:47:06] But God condescended down in the hour
[1:47:09] they were living in.
[1:47:11] And he set up a victory formation.
[1:47:16] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] We got to have a messenger with a
[1:47:22] message from the throne to meet the
[1:47:24] challenge of this day. There is a
[1:47:27] Goliath, but God will surely have a
[1:47:30] David somewhere. Remember last time I
[1:47:32] preached, I said every time the enemy
[1:47:35] raises up a Goliath, God's got a David
[1:47:39] somewhere. What is he saying? Amen. When
[1:47:43] Satan raises up his head and the spirit
[1:47:45] of an ox, God or a
[1:47:48] spirit rise it up, he combats it. He
[1:47:52] said, "X, a a face like a man." He said,
[1:47:55] "But the last stage is going to be a
[1:47:56] flying eagle to meet the challenge of
[1:47:59] the age. She's not going to be
[1:48:01] earthbound any longer." Amen. She's
[1:48:04] going to fly in the heavenlies.
[1:48:07] Hallelujah. She's going to be
[1:48:09] anointed vindicate the word in this body
[1:48:14] to prove once and for all this message
[1:48:17] is right.
[1:48:21] Somebody's going to prove this message
[1:48:24] is right.
[1:48:26] Paul said, "Amen." He speaks and he
[1:48:29] tells us there's going to become a
[1:48:32] shout.
[1:48:34] There's going to be come a time of a
[1:48:36] voice and a
[1:48:37] trump and the dead shall rise first and
[1:48:41] those that are remain. Somebody's going
[1:48:44] to be here. Somebody's going to
[1:48:46] vindicate what Paul spoke in the New
[1:48:49] Testament.
[1:48:51] Somebody's going to vindicate it. God's
[1:48:54] word can never come back void. Oh, I'm
[1:48:57] here to tell you, church, I see a lot of
[1:49:00] people here that's vindicating this
[1:49:02] message to be truth.
[1:49:05] We're proving it, church.
[1:49:11] How? I'm telling you, cuz we don't have
[1:49:14] the desires we once had.
[1:49:17] We've been changed, church. Come on. The
[1:49:20] old man is dead.
[1:49:22] He may look the same, but he's dead.
[1:49:26] Yes, sir. There's been a rising of a sun
[1:49:30] that's dawned in a dark
[1:49:32] place and I'm validation that he changed
[1:49:36] me. Amen. From the ridiculous to the
[1:49:39] supplied
[1:49:45] Oh, dumb devils got hit too many times
[1:49:47] this morning. Let's go ahead. Let's hit
[1:49:50] him one more time. Not today, devil. Not
[1:49:52] today. This is the day that the Lord has
[1:49:55] made. I will rejoice. I will rejoice.
[1:49:59] Can I have a Mary? Amen. Rejoice and be
[1:50:03] glad in it. So I don't feel it.
[1:50:06] Goliath's still there. Go ahead. Let's
[1:50:09] try this morning. Come on, Mary.
[1:50:11] Rejoice.
[1:50:14] Rejoice. Have faith in your anointing.
[1:50:18] Amen.
[1:50:20] Hallelujah.
[1:50:26] So what
[1:50:28] happened? Every one of
[1:50:31] them is laying out there
[1:50:36] dead. Who done
[1:50:39] this? It was a man called
[1:50:42] Shamgar. The guy that we stole from
[1:50:44] every year.
[1:50:47] Yes. Hallelujah. Can they say that about
[1:50:51] us tonight this
[1:50:53] morning? Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] If God before us, who can be against us?
[1:51:01] Hallelujah. Can we have somebody to take
[1:51:05] faith in their anointing and say, "Not
[1:51:08] today, devil.
[1:51:11] I'm going to take every day, every demon
[1:51:15] that's been following me around.
[1:51:18] I'm taking the word of God this
[1:51:23] morning. Hallelujah. Say, can you do it?
[1:51:26] I know you can.
[1:51:29] Can you overcome? I know you can. Oh,
[1:51:31] yeah. Can I overcome this? I know you
[1:51:34] can. Can I overcome layer of sleep? Yes,
[1:51:38] I know you can. Cuz I'm a witness.
[1:51:42] I'm a witness.
[1:51:45] I used to be a coward, but I'm a
[1:51:47] witness. God's not dead, he's alive. I'm
[1:51:51] a witness that when I got down to my
[1:51:53] lowest, he couldn't pick me
[1:51:57] up. I'm a witness like Job was when all
[1:52:01] hope was gone, didn't feel like nobody
[1:52:04] around cared, all of a sudden that line
[1:52:07] tightened up to my
[1:52:10] absolute. Hallelujah. And it begin to
[1:52:13] echo into my
[1:52:16] heart. I can never let you go. I can
[1:52:20] never let you go. Preachers can let you
[1:52:23] go. Churches can let you go. But Christ
[1:52:25] said, I can never let you go. Don't you
[1:52:29] love him this morning? How many feels
[1:52:31] like letting go of the faith this
[1:52:33] morning? As much faith you release,
[1:52:36] that's how much power you can have this
[1:52:38] morning. I say there's going to be a
[1:52:40] releasing like never before under the
[1:52:44] revealing of this message. It's just
[1:52:46] going to begin to unfold.
[1:52:51] It's going to we're going to start
[1:52:53] speeding up so fast and this world's
[1:52:56] going to begin to slow down
[1:52:58] and all of a
[1:53:00] sudden we're going to be changed.
[1:53:03] We're going to validate it.
[1:53:05] We're going to vindicate it.
[1:53:08] I'd say I'm one of them. How you know?
[1:53:10] I've already turned heavily. I'm going
[1:53:12] to vindicate it. I've already had a
[1:53:14] resurrection with it. How many's had a
[1:53:15] resurrection?
[1:53:17] How many's had a resurrection? Amen.
[1:53:20] Come on. You can do better. How many's
[1:53:22] been had a resurrection
[1:53:25] already in your
[1:53:27] soul? It's the earnest. It's the
[1:53:30] earnest. It's saying, "Brother Cho, it's
[1:53:33] coming. It's coming. You can't miss it.
[1:53:36] You can't be defeated. You can't be
[1:53:39] stopped. What God has started,
[1:53:42] nothing can stop it.
[1:53:45] [Applause]
[1:53:50] If brother Matt starts it, another man
[1:53:53] can stop it. If this church can start
[1:53:56] start it, then another church can stop
[1:53:59] it. But if God starts it, there ain't no
[1:54:03] man can stop it. Ain't no church can
[1:54:06] stop it. It's God who's rich in mercy.
[1:54:11] Yes, sir. Oh, if you love him, stand to
[1:54:13] your feet this
[1:54:14] morning. Hallelujah. Can we have some
[1:54:18] Marys to give a hand clap of praise this
[1:54:20] morning? Amen. Not
[1:54:22] today. Not today,
[1:54:25] devil. I feel like praising praising
[1:54:29] him.
[1:54:31] I feel like praising him this morning.
[1:54:34] The king of
[1:54:36] glory. The king of glory.
[1:54:40] Hallelujah.
[1:54:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:54:46] Lord.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[1:54:51] Jesus. Can you just bow your hearts this
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:59] morning? Thank you, Lord.

[1:55:05] Lord. Oh, can we be a David this
[1:55:07] morning? Have an have have a little
[1:55:11] faith in that
[1:55:14] anointing. This too will pass this
[1:55:18] morning, Lord. That's been a theme of my
[1:55:22] life, Lord
[1:55:24] God. Lord God, I I I've been there
[1:55:27] through the darkest of the darkest, Lord
[1:55:29] God. Lord, you never forsaken me one
[1:55:32] time, Lord God. I was ready to let go of
[1:55:35] you, but you can never let go of me.
[1:55:38] Lord, we thank you for that this
[1:55:40] morning, Lord God, for you promised,
[1:55:42] Lord God, that you can never forsake us.

[1:55:49] us, Lord. We thank you for your word
[1:55:51] this morning. We thank you for your
[1:55:55] promises. Thank you for a victory
[1:55:57] formation in the hour that we're living
[1:55:59] in. The enemy exhausted all of his
[1:56:02] options and we found in this age an
[1:56:07] overcomer
[1:56:10] victory by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:56:14] word of our testimony. Lord we pray Lord
[1:56:17] God that you anoint us aresh this
[1:56:19] morning Lord. Anoint your saints Lord
[1:56:21] God. Lord God they've been battling
[1:56:23] their their golas of listings this

[1:56:28] faith in their anointing by the
[1:56:29] ministering of your word this morning,
[1:56:32] Lord. That you would give them the
[1:56:33] energy. God would give them strength in
[1:56:35] their in their body like a like a
[1:56:37] strength into a battery. Lord
[1:56:40] God, Lord God, let the dunamis power of
[1:56:43] the dynamite of God would begin to blow
[1:56:45] up in their lives and stir up a revival
[1:56:49] in Jesus Christ's name. This morning we
[1:56:54] ask, hallelujah.

[1:58:14] faith, but a hope. An outcome. The word
[1:58:18] hope in the Old Testament means outcome.
[1:58:20] We have an outcome this morning. He died
[1:58:22] for this purpose, Brother Tom. He didn't
[1:58:25] stay in the tomb for you. He rose on the
[1:58:27] third day for you. That's our outcome.

[2:04:57] storm. Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[2:05:01] Cover me when my strength is gone. Let
[2:05:05] the peace that passes all I
[2:05:09] understand. Cover
[2:05:12] me. Oh, cover me. Amen. Give the Lord a
[2:05:17] hand. Clap of praise this morning.
[2:05:21] How is that your prayer this morning
[2:05:23] that his peace would just come and
[2:05:24] overshadow you? I'm sure David felt that
[2:05:27] way. You know, he had a vindicated
[2:05:30] message he was carrying because he knew
[2:05:33] my God had already delivered me from the
[2:05:35] bear. He already delivered me from the
[2:05:37] lion. So, what is this Philistine? He's
[2:05:40] just nothing. You say, "Well, he picked
[2:05:42] up five stones." Well, he you think you
[2:05:45] think David was worried that God might
[2:05:46] have he might not be able to him the
[2:05:48] first time. You know, because David knew
[2:05:50] he says there's this Goliath and then he
[2:05:52] has four more brothers. So, that's who
[2:05:55] I'm going to go kill. And you know,
[2:05:56] that's how we are this morning. We can
[2:05:59] just go forth forth believing that we
[2:06:01] have a vindicated word that whatever is
[2:06:04] said is already done. It's a finished
[2:06:05] work. We just got to go forth with faith
[2:06:08] believing that it's already going to be
[2:06:10] accomplished in us. Amen. Let's sing
[2:06:12] that song. Victory is mine. Victory is
[2:06:14] mine. How many can you say that this
[2:06:16] morning? Oh, victory is mine. Oh,

[2:07:05] out. So, I got down on my knees. I said,
[2:07:09] "Lord, help me please." And I got up
[2:07:13] singing and shouting the
