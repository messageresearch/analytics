[52:24] raiseth up the dead and qu quickeneth
[52:27] them even so the son quickeneth whom he
[52:30] will for the father judgeth no man but
[52:33] he hath committed all judgment unto the
[52:35] son somebody say the son that all men
[52:38] should honor the son even as th as they
[52:40] honor the father for he that honth not
[52:43] the son honth not the Father which hath
[52:46] sent him so the father hath sent the son
[52:50] verily verily I say unto you he that
[52:51] heareth my word and believeth on him
[52:54] that sent me hath Everlasting in life
[52:57] and shall not come into condemnation but
[53:00] is passed from Death unto life I love to
[53:03] hear a prophet of God read that
[53:04] scripture one time he stops he says now
[53:07] rub that out if you can amen you can't
[53:09] rub that promise out it's an eternal
[53:11] promise verily verily I say unto you the
[53:14] hour is coming and now is when the dead
[53:18] shall hear the voice of the Son of God
[53:21] and they that hear shall live for as the
[53:24] father hath life in himself so hath he
[53:27] given to the son to have life in himself
[53:31] and hath given him authority to execute
[53:33] judgment also because he is the son of
[53:37] man somebody say because he is the Son
[53:41] of Man Marvel not at this for the hour
[53:44] is coming in the which all that are in
[53:47] the graves shall hear his voice and
[53:50] shall come forth now watch this they
[53:53] that had done good unto the resurrection
[53:55] of life and they that had done evil unto
[53:57] the resurrection of damnation now in the
[54:00] Book of Revelations the 10th chapter
[54:03] Revelations chapter 10 another scripture
[54:06] Here We Know by heart this morning in
[54:09] Revelations chapter 10 in verse number 7
[54:13] amen we thank the Lord for the reading
[54:15] of the word of God Amen Revelations
[54:18] chapter 10 and verse number
[54:21] seven but in the days of the voice of
[54:24] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[54:27] sound the mystery of God should be
[54:30] finished or should be filled as Heath
[54:34] declar to his servants the prophets now
[54:37] one other place I want to look is in
[54:38] Luke chapter
[54:40] 17 St Luke chapter
[54:44] 17 how many's thankful this morning for
[54:46] the message of the hour amen St Luke
[54:49] chapter 17 and verse number
[54:53] 30 St Luke 17
[54:56] in verse number
[54:58] 30 even thus shall it be in the day when
[55:03] the son of man is revealed I love what
[55:06] the prophet of God says or Jesus Christ
[55:09] is made manifest in his people we ask
[55:12] the Lord this morning to add the
[55:13] blessing to the reading of his word as
[55:14] you can have your seats here today I
[55:16] want to uh by the help of the Lord from
[55:18] those passages of scripture I want to
[55:20] speak to you today on this thought of
[55:23] obeying the voice of the son of man obey
[55:27] the voice of the son of man uh some time
[55:29] ago I came across a quote where the
[55:31] prophet of God was saying and he was
[55:33] speaking to the people and he actually
[55:35] says this phrase he said now see he's
[55:38] just using my voice and I began to study
[55:41] that in the 1956 I want to read this
[55:43] quote just to lay a foundation 1956 in
[55:46] the message Faith Charlotte North
[55:48] Carolina he says now I'm going to ask
[55:50] you all to be reverent just as reverent
[55:52] as you can you say now brother brandom
[55:55] what are you talking about you're just
[55:57] stalling he said well I am exactly see
[56:00] I'm waiting for that angel of the Lord
[56:02] to come that's exactly right I don't
[56:05] know none of you and how could how could
[56:07] I do anything I can't it's him I can't
[56:10] do it even when he comes unless your
[56:12] faith operates it it's not me see I
[56:16] cannot see Visions unless it's your
[56:18] faith that does it sure he said now
[56:20] God's Will by Divine gift he said the
[56:23] only thing I do is just keep yielding
[56:25] myself
[56:26] and as I get myself completely yielded
[56:29] to the holy spirit amen then he starts
[56:33] talking amen when I when I linger and I
[56:36] wait on the angel of the Lord to come
[56:38] and I get myself completely yielded to
[56:40] the Holy Spirit then he starts talking
[56:44] it's not me he is using my voice see
[56:48] it's not me it's him that's just exactly
[56:51] what the scripture says so amen
[56:53] therefore this morning we have to make a
[56:55] declaration
[56:56] as a church we believe that God still
[56:59] speaks I know a lot of denominations
[57:02] don't but as the Church of the Living
[57:03] God this morning we believe that God
[57:06] still has a voice and he is still able
[57:09] to speak he said now and if you hear a
[57:12] voice speaking to you he said that's God
[57:14] because it copes with the scripture if
[57:17] it doesn't then there's some kind of a
[57:18] wrong voice that's speaking to you amen
[57:21] but the right voice will tell you to
[57:23] follow the rules of the Bible so if it's
[57:26] a scriptural voice that voice will tell
[57:28] you Amen to follow the rules of the
[57:31] Bible he said no sprinkling no pouring
[57:34] no falsely amen come right straight out
[57:37] and follow the rules of the Bible now we
[57:40] all know this morning that God Amen has
[57:43] spokesmen and God sends amen men to
[57:46] speak on his behalf in Hebrews chap 12
[57:49] and verse 25 the Bible said see that you
[57:52] refuse not him amen that speaketh for if
[57:55] they Escape not who refused him that
[57:58] spake on the earth and how much more
[58:00] shall not we escape if we turn away from
[58:02] him that speaketh from Heaven look at
[58:05] this word speaketh it means to
[58:07] articulate sounds it means to declare
[58:10] one's mind amen by speech or by sound
[58:13] now when you start talking about sounds
[58:15] if you study the message you know am
[58:17] then that there's actually two types of
[58:19] sounds amen there is a certain sound
[58:22] amen and then there is an uncertain
[58:24] sound Paul would say in 1 Corinthians
[58:27] 14:8 he said if the trumpet give an
[58:29] uncertain sound amen then who shall
[58:32] prepare himself for the battle amen so
[58:35] there is a sound there is a trumpet amen
[58:38] which is announcing a b a battle
[58:41] Revelation 1:10 I was in the spirit on
[58:43] the Lord's day and I heard behind me a
[58:46] great voice amen as of a trumpet the
[58:49] seven Church ages brother man picks this
[58:51] up he said now a trumpet is an
[58:54] announcement he said Gab at the coming
[58:56] of the Lord shall sound a trumpet amen
[58:59] of God this was God's trumpet blowing in
[59:02] other words he's fixing to announce amen
[59:05] the Eternal destination of the world so
[59:08] when now now when that trumpet sounds
[59:10] it's bringing forth an announcement amen
[59:12] but that announcement is connected to a
[59:15] destination he said a trumpet what is it
[59:18] get ready I'm going to give you the
[59:21] revelation of Jesus Christ to give to
[59:23] the church amen I will speak to you and
[59:26] what will be the destination of the
[59:28] world Amen is for those who receive amen
[59:31] and those who reject see a trumpet of
[59:34] God attention every man amen when the
[59:37] trumpet blows he grabs his sword he
[59:40] stands to a place of attention amen if
[59:42] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[59:45] amen then who shall prepare himself for
[59:48] the War I just want to say this to you
[59:50] this morning amen that there is a
[59:52] sounding of a gospel trumpet amen that
[59:54] is announcing the destination of the
[59:57] world Amen but what's going to determine
[59:59] the destination amen is the attitude
[1:00:02] towards the voice that is speaking amen
[1:00:05] the Revelation that will determine your
[1:00:07] destination I'll say this morning we are
[1:00:09] not listening to any kind of trumpet we
[1:00:12] are listening to a gospel trumpet and
[1:00:14] the prophet of God said oh you can go
[1:00:17] ahead and take that uncertain sound if
[1:00:19] you want to amen but I like the gospel
[1:00:22] trumpet amen because that gives a
[1:00:24] certain sound he said what is the gospel
[1:00:27] trumpet amen it's the good news amen
[1:00:31] that's right that he's here now amen and
[1:00:33] there's nothing uncertain about it amen
[1:00:37] let me sound the gospel trumpet to you
[1:00:39] this morning amen that Jesus Christ is
[1:00:42] not in a grave in Jerusalem amen and
[1:00:45] neither is he in a grave in
[1:00:46] Jeffersonville amen but he is alive and
[1:00:49] he is well this morning and he is right
[1:00:52] here in Grace Tabernacle Amen in the
[1:00:54] power of his resurrection
[1:00:56] in the form of the Holy Ghost to
[1:00:58] minister to every need Amen to deliver
[1:01:01] every heart listen I'll tell you what
[1:01:03] when we hear this trumpet it ain't time
[1:01:05] to tuck tail and run it's time to draw
[1:01:07] our sword amen and face this devil we
[1:01:10] are not a bunch of sissies we are not a
[1:01:13] bunch of pansies amen but we are
[1:01:15] warriors who have been called amen by
[1:01:17] the voice of God in this age to stand
[1:01:20] Amen on the word of God listen Malachi 4
[1:01:23] was promised to come in this age and he
[1:01:25] was was not coming Amen to bring peace
[1:01:28] he was coming to declare war amen a true
[1:01:31] prophet of God is not sent amen or not
[1:01:34] man-made amen but a true prophet of God
[1:01:37] is God sent and I find it amazing that
[1:01:40] God Amen from the beginning from Eden
[1:01:43] brother says from Eden amen and since
[1:01:46] Eden has kept his voice alive amen
[1:01:50] through the prophets amen all the way
[1:01:52] from Eden Amen to now amen The Voice of
[1:01:56] God has never died that's powerful he
[1:01:59] has kept it alive through the prophets
[1:02:01] brother said watch he said when the
[1:02:03] devil F he silenced Abel he said God
[1:02:06] raised up se he said and the same voice
[1:02:10] think about this the same voice that
[1:02:12] spoke in Eden amen is speaking here this
[1:02:16] morning you say the same voice amen how
[1:02:19] many voices does God have amen he has
[1:02:22] one voice amen that sounds to many
[1:02:24] Waters listen and this morning the voice
[1:02:27] of God Amen is not weak the voice of God
[1:02:30] is Not powerless amen but the voice of
[1:02:33] God still has the authority Amen to
[1:02:36] speak and when he speaks things begin to
[1:02:38] shake I say oh God this morning amen
[1:02:41] come in our Sunday morning service and
[1:02:44] begin to speak to our young people begin
[1:02:46] to speak to our homes begin to speak to
[1:02:48] our family listen when God begins to
[1:02:51] speak things begin to shake let me just
[1:02:54] say this it is very important Amen to
[1:02:57] believe that God Amen sent someone to
[1:03:00] speak amen it's very important to
[1:03:02] believe that God sent him amen that
[1:03:04] speaketh amen now watch this and to
[1:03:06] receive him you say to receive him well
[1:03:09] the works of God Amen is believing and
[1:03:13] receiving on he whom God has sent
[1:03:16] remember said the Dark Ages amen the
[1:03:18] word somebody shout the word was almost
[1:03:21] entirely amen lost to the people amen
[1:03:24] but God sent Luther with the word and
[1:03:27] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[1:03:30] but they organized and again the pure
[1:03:32] word amen was lost because organization
[1:03:35] amen tends towards dogma and Creeds and
[1:03:38] not simple word he said they could no
[1:03:41] longer speak for God he said but then
[1:03:44] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[1:03:46] with the word amen for his day amen the
[1:03:49] people who took his Revelation from God
[1:03:52] listen they became amen the living of
[1:03:56] read and known of all men for their
[1:03:57] generation and when the Methodist failed
[1:04:00] amen God raised up others and so it has
[1:04:03] gone on Amen through the years until in
[1:04:06] this last day oh God there is again
[1:04:09] another people in the land who under
[1:04:12] their Messenger will be the final voice
[1:04:15] to the final age listen God raised up
[1:04:18] Luther and they spoke for God he raised
[1:04:21] up Wesley and they spoke for God he
[1:04:23] raised up Pentecost and they spoke for
[1:04:25] God but the minute they went towards
[1:04:28] organization was the minute God left
[1:04:30] them but he couldn't let his voice die
[1:04:33] amen because his voice has been alive
[1:04:35] since Eden and it's still speaking this
[1:04:37] morning well let me say this amen the
[1:04:40] seventh angel in a physical Corporal
[1:04:42] body is not on the earth amen but the
[1:04:45] voice is still here so there has been a
[1:04:48] transfer amen of the voice in this age

[1:04:53] prophet has now come into the prophecy
[1:04:56] listen I can say to you this morning you
[1:04:59] are not a voiceless people you are not a
[1:05:02] silenced people you have received the
[1:05:04] message of the hour you are saying the
[1:05:07] same thing that a prophet has already
[1:05:09] said you know what I say I say there is
[1:05:12] an authority upon you that's why the
[1:05:14] devil's trying to paralyze your vocal
[1:05:16] cords that's why he trying to paralyze
[1:05:18] your praise because he knows you're more
[1:05:21] than just a bunch of church members in a
[1:05:23] Sunday morning service but you are a
[1:05:26] prophetic class of people the devil
[1:05:28] knows the voice of God that was all the
[1:05:30] way back in Eden it's right here in this
[1:05:34] building this morning and you are in
[1:05:36] position to speak the word of God and go

[1:11:08] I love this one obedience unlocks the
[1:11:12] supernatural my goodness in Genesis

[1:11:18] unto Abram Out of Heaven the second time
[1:11:21] and said behold myself have I sworn

[1:11:54] his seed which was Isaac listen friends
[1:11:57] today we are still reaping the benefits
[1:12:00] of Abraham's obedience thousands of
[1:12:03] years later because it unlocked a
[1:12:05] blessing on the seat of Isaac oh can I
[1:12:08] say something to your parents amen your
[1:12:10] obedience is going to unlock a blessing

[1:12:28] say well I don't think obedience matters
[1:12:31] amen can I say this Amen in the middle
[1:12:33] of the time that you're having to
[1:12:35] struggle to obey it don't look like much
[1:12:37] but when you get years down the road and
[1:12:40] you look back and you see amen because
[1:12:43] of that simple obedience I am a blessed
[1:12:45] man I was preaching one time amen out in
[1:12:48] Oklahom at Bryce Collins and brother
[1:12:50] Merl Applegate was sitting there some of
[1:12:52] y'all probably know Merl am then his

[1:13:01] was just preaching along and brother
[1:13:03] brother David he had just told me the
[1:13:05] day before he said brother Andrew he
[1:13:07] said there was never a time when I was
[1:13:09] raising my kids that church was a
[1:13:11] question in my mind I said well I
[1:13:14] believe that he said no he said we lived

[1:13:21] situations in church trouble and false
[1:13:23] doctrines and things he said our church

[1:13:28] 3:00 in the morning and be at the post
[1:13:30] office for work he said but Wednesday
[1:13:33] night never was an
[1:13:34] option now it might get tight here but
[1:13:37] we might as well preach he said
[1:13:39] Wednesday night never was an option he
[1:13:41] said if we left work and drove to church
[1:13:43] he said I would sleep on the way back
[1:13:45] home get to the house go in change and
[1:13:48] go to work and it just dawned on me amen
[1:13:50] today his daughters are married to
[1:13:52] preachers amen all his grandbabies are
[1:13:55] in the house of God are you all hearing
[1:13:57] me amen they lost his son a few years
[1:13:59] ago in a tragic accident amen but he
[1:14:02] standing on the shores of Glory a been
[1:14:04] waiting on their arrival you know what I
[1:14:06] say to you I say don't you let some
[1:14:08] lukewarm leoty and devil amen convince
[1:14:12] you amen that obeying the word of God is
[1:14:14] out of style I'll say you can never go
[1:14:17] wrong by obeying the word of God yes
[1:14:20] sometimes you may have to struggle and
[1:14:23] sometimes you may have to do without but
[1:14:25] but you know what I say amen I say on
[1:14:27] the other side when you see the
[1:14:29] blessings of God upon your babies and
[1:14:32] upon your grand babies you'll shout the
[1:14:34] Hallelujah to Eternity that you obeyed
[1:14:37] the word of God in the face of Leon toy
[1:14:40] and
[1:14:41] influence yes sir amen obedience is what
[1:14:44] God wants listen byy seed amen shall all
[1:14:48] the nations of the earth be blessed
[1:14:49] because thou Hast obeyed my voice B said
[1:14:54] when God called Moses he didn't want to
[1:14:56] go those prophets had such things to do
[1:14:59] that it was a hard thing to do he said
[1:15:01] they didn't want to go out and be
[1:15:02] scorned at they wanted to have
[1:15:04] fellowship and go in with the rest of
[1:15:05] them and go along with Brothers he said
[1:15:08] I forget what prophet it was that said I
[1:15:10] don't want to do this in other words but
[1:15:12] my whole heart will catch a fire because
[1:15:15] God has spoken and I must deliver it he
[1:15:19] said whether they liked it whether they
[1:15:20] crucified him whether they stoned him
[1:15:23] whatever they did amen God had spoken
[1:15:26] his heart and he must say it now listen
[1:15:29] not to be different but to be obedient
[1:15:33] so when a prophet begin to speak he was
[1:15:36] not saying things he meant to be
[1:15:38] different Brother David he was saying
[1:15:40] things to be obedient because obedience
[1:15:44] is better than sacrifice he said God had
[1:15:47] so much complete control of them till he
[1:15:51] was their voice he was their action now
[1:15:55] watch a prophet bring this from the
[1:15:56] prophet into the prophecy he said give
[1:15:59] me a church that's so completely
[1:16:01] Anointed with God to their every action
[1:16:04] and move is thus saith the Lord right
[1:16:08] amen they will walk in that Shak kind
[1:16:11] Glory he said I will show you a messiah
[1:16:14] amen an anointed one of God Amen now
[1:16:17] watch this standing somebody say
[1:16:20] standing standing upon the Earth listen
[1:16:24] the signs of of God Amen they're always
[1:16:26] overlooked and brother said one of the
[1:16:28] one of God's signs amen is the coming of
[1:16:32] a prophet he said now listen the coming
[1:16:34] of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked
[1:16:37] by the people every time see they
[1:16:39] Overlook it they never get it amen L
[1:16:41] their eyes are open to see it now watch
[1:16:43] this amen those who are elected to see
[1:16:46] it amen they do see it but the are y'all
[1:16:49] ready for this the coming of a prophet
[1:16:53] was the sign that God is ready to speak
[1:16:56] cuz God ain't going to speak amen if the
[1:16:59] prophet wouldn't be on the earth now
[1:17:01] remember he wouldn't be on the earth
[1:17:04] unless God was ready to speak there
[1:17:08] would not be a prophet on the earth
[1:17:10] brother Carter unless God was ready to
[1:17:13] speak he said that's the way he speaks
[1:17:15] amen through those channels now you all
[1:17:18] know when a prophet comes amen there is
[1:17:21] a sign amen and there is a voice
[1:17:24] remember said listen he wants an
[1:17:25] audience he wants somebody amen that's
[1:17:28] going to listen to what he is going to
[1:17:31] say he said now the sign is an alert to
[1:17:35] attract the attention of the people that
[1:17:38] the word is getting ready to speak when
[1:17:41] you see the sign it is an announcement
[1:17:44] that there's a voice that's behind that
[1:17:47] sign listen the sign is not your focus
[1:17:51] it's the voice behind the sign that you
[1:17:54] are elected to hear many will see the
[1:17:56] sign but only the elected amen will hear
[1:18:00] the voice can I say this to you and the
[1:18:03] voice is the word and the word is God oh
[1:18:07] church can I say it like this we had to
[1:18:10] move a few years ago and you give me

[1:18:25] a been fighting against God's message
[1:18:27] and I studied one day I studied one day
[1:18:30] brother man and I read where the prophet
[1:18:31] of God said he said now look what he
[1:18:33] said he said see the sign and believe
[1:18:36] the voice I said oh my goodness right
[1:18:40] there where they missed it amen they
[1:18:41] were too focused on the sign and they
[1:18:44] built everything on the sign that they
[1:18:46] never heard the voice listen you can get
[1:18:48] out of line with a sign amen but the
[1:18:51] voice will bring the sign into balance
[1:18:54] with the of God you know what I say to
[1:18:56] you this morning I say thank God for the
[1:18:58] sign but I'm not a sign Seeker I am a
[1:19:01] voice believer it's the voice of the
[1:19:04] bridegroom it's the voice of my beloved
[1:19:07] I hear his voice and his voice has
[1:19:10] called me from the confusion of Leota
[1:19:13] and it set me up on a rock hallelujah I
[1:19:16] wasn't just elected to see the sign I
[1:19:18] was elected to hear the voice but said
[1:19:22] look he said Abraham was elected to hear
[1:19:24] that that voice he said and when he
[1:19:26] heard that voice he obeyed The Voice
[1:19:29] look what the voice said now now you all
[1:19:31] say it's hard look what Abraham heard

[1:19:38] it is they're doubters and they're
[1:19:41] unbelievers and they'll have you in the
[1:19:43] same fix amen come on out and separate
[1:19:47] yourself and live for me what is it

[1:20:10] children separating thems from what from
[1:20:14] see taste feel smell hear imagination
[1:20:17] conscience memory reason affection
[1:20:20] everything open up your mind and let the
[1:20:23] word come in amen and March with the
[1:20:26] word that's the real Soldier the real
[1:20:30] Soldier is a seat of Abraham who can
[1:20:33] separate from the five outer senses and
[1:20:35] the five inner senses and they can put
[1:20:37] on their marching shoes they can get
[1:20:39] their sword in their hand they can get
[1:20:41] the breastplate of righteousness on
[1:20:43] listen and they can march with a word

[1:20:48] days you can walk with the word on the
[1:20:50] bad days because why you are an obedient
[1:20:54] Soldier soier who has heard the trumpet
[1:20:56] sound in the greatest battle that has
[1:20:59] ever been fought and it has released an
[1:21:01] anointing upon you but that anointing is
[1:21:04] a word anointing which says the word
[1:21:07] must be obeyed I'll say this amen is
[1:21:10] this
[1:21:11] okay the principle of obedience it was
[1:21:14] actually established all the way back in
[1:21:16] the book of St John Chapter 2 when Jesus
[1:21:19] was at a wedding amen and they ran out
[1:21:21] of wine and they needed some wine so all
[1:21:24] they had was water you know what the
[1:21:26] Bible says the Bible said that that that
[1:21:29] they told him to bring the water to
[1:21:30] Jesus they looked at the water and
[1:21:33] brother Wesley they said this is just
[1:21:34] water but his mother was standing there
[1:21:37] you know what she said unto the servants
[1:21:39] she said whatever he saith unto you just
[1:21:42] do it whatever he tells you to do just
[1:21:46] do it she said look brother said that's
[1:21:48] still good teaching tonight that's a
[1:21:51] teaching amen whatever God says to do do
[1:21:54] it he said that's still good teaching
[1:21:57] tonight whatever he saith unto you do it
[1:22:00] if he tells you to make ready for death
[1:22:02] then you get ready if he tells you
[1:22:04] you're going to get well then you
[1:22:06] believe it if he tells you that you're
[1:22:07] healed you are whatever he says to do do
[1:22:12] it and if you disbelieve it it's sin now
[1:22:15] it's real easy to obey the easy things
[1:22:18] amen but sometimes we got to get down to
[1:22:20] where the rubber hits the road and Obey
[1:22:23] things that are contrary
[1:22:25] to our wants and our flesh and our
[1:22:27] opinions come on church amen but God has
[1:22:30] so blessed this generation that he sent
[1:22:33] us instructions to an age through the
[1:22:36] angel messenger of that age look in 1
[1:22:38] Corinthians 15:1 the Bible said Brethren
[1:22:42] I declare unto you that the gospel which
[1:22:44] I preached unto you which also ye have
[1:22:46] received look and we're in ye stand by
[1:22:49] which also you are saved if you keep in
[1:22:52] memory what I preached unto you unless
[1:22:54] you have believed in vain look at verse
[1:22:56] three for I delivered somebody say
[1:23:00] delivered for I delivered unto you it
[1:23:03] feels good in here this morning I
[1:23:04] deliver unto you first of all not some
[1:23:07] but all that which also received how
[1:23:11] that Christ died for your sins are sins
[1:23:13] according to the scripture look at this
[1:23:15] word delivered it means to give into the
[1:23:17] hands of another it means to give over
[1:23:20] into one's power or use it means to
[1:23:22] deliver to one something to keep it
[1:23:26] means to use to take care of Brother
[1:23:28] David this one blew my mind it means to
[1:23:31] deliver verbally so when something is
[1:23:34] delivered it's delivered verbally 1947
[1:23:39] the very first tape that we have
[1:23:41] brother's opening statement is this
[1:23:43] brother Mark he says we're getting some
[1:23:45] new gadgets now amen for
[1:23:48] recording right the very I know that me
[1:23:52] I'm the guy okay I know that some say
[1:23:54] well that's silly that's not silly
[1:23:56] Church a I'll say this to you that's a
[1:23:59] blessing that God so loved this
[1:24:01] generation that at the time that the
[1:24:04] seventh angel would be upon the Earth
[1:24:06] and he would begin to declare the
[1:24:08] Revelation that was going to determine
[1:24:10] the destination of the entire world it
[1:24:13] would not just be spoken for brother so
[1:24:16] and so to interpret it would not be
[1:24:18] spoken for brother so and so amen
[1:24:20] because he was on a log and huny with
[1:24:22] brother brandom no it was put verbally
[1:24:25] on take listen that's why today we don't
[1:24:28] have to follow whatever man says we got
[1:24:30] our own books and we got our own tapes
[1:24:33] and we can go in our own bedrooms and
[1:24:35] turn on them tapes and we can hear what
[1:24:37] a prophet delivered
[1:24:40] verbally well I feel like preaching on
[1:24:42] that point he said the only thing I can
[1:24:44] do is deliver the message just like he
[1:24:48] told me you say well that's crazy is it
[1:24:51] the problem God said it's up to the
[1:24:53] spokesman he said now that Jesus died
[1:24:56] God's covenant and raised again he said
[1:24:58] then the same spirit that was on him is
[1:25:01] in the church and it promised by God
[1:25:04] that it would be to the end of the world
[1:25:07] oh god brother Wesley the same voice
[1:25:10] that was speaking and Eden is speaking
[1:25:13] here this morning God promised it would
[1:25:15] be here until the end of the world
[1:25:19] listen it's up to you to receive it well
[1:25:22] I receive that what a prophet said is
[1:25:25] the voice of God to this generation you
[1:25:28] said well that's crazy brother B said
[1:25:30] it's he said God is Duty bound to send
[1:25:33] it it's up to you to receive it whether
[1:25:35] you want it or not see God pokes his
[1:25:38] religion down nobody's
[1:25:41] throat God pokes his religion down
[1:25:44] nobody's throat he said the preacher
[1:25:46] might do it amen but God does it well we
[1:25:50] might as well say Amen to that point
[1:25:52] amen cuz some of you all set through
[1:25:53] some po con sessions amen just poking
[1:25:56] poking poking poking well I don't like
[1:25:58] to be poked amen I like to be preached
[1:26:01] too is that okay amen preach the word oh
[1:26:05] God it's like somebody get up and they
[1:26:07] ain't study they ain't prepared they
[1:26:08] ain't labored before the presence of God
[1:26:10] and they think because they got a
[1:26:12] microphone everybody ought to be
[1:26:13] shouting and Swinging From sh he man
[1:26:15] I'll shout if I want to just preach and
[1:26:17] leave me alone but if you want me to
[1:26:19] shout amen say something I can shout
[1:26:22] about if you want me to dance then
[1:26:24] preach the message I don't respond to
[1:26:27] anything I am an eagle and the only
[1:26:30] thing I respond to is the voice of the
[1:26:33] bridegroom that has been revealed to the
[1:26:35] seventh
[1:26:36] angel yall know it's the truth they been
[1:26:39] poking poking and then come this way
[1:26:41] amen no just do what a prophet did and
[1:26:44] preach the message when Paul the first
[1:26:46] church age messenger came he said I
[1:26:48] delivered unto you first of all that
[1:26:50] which also received look at this word
[1:26:53] received it means not not to withhold
[1:26:55] obedience it is by the instruction of
[1:26:58] teachers now I know people say well
[1:27:01] we're in the bright age and we don't
[1:27:02] need no teaching well that's a
[1:27:04] Pentecostal shuck
[1:27:06] idea come on that's a amen amen somebody
[1:27:09] say well if you teach the word that
[1:27:11] ain't inspired according to who come
[1:27:15] on can I preach according to who all
[1:27:20] right not according to brother brandom
[1:27:22] because he said preaching catches The
[1:27:24] Sinner he said but teaching positionally
[1:27:28] places the believer and you cannot
[1:27:30] rightly have faith until positionally
[1:27:33] you know what you are you know what I
[1:27:35] say I say sometimes we need some good
[1:27:38] oldfashioned teaching Services sir we're
[1:27:41] not a bunch of Pentecostal babies that's
[1:27:43] got to shout on the music all the time
[1:27:46] and dance on the air no we want some
[1:27:48] word we want some substance come on you
[1:27:51] say well you're getting out there well
[1:27:53] can I just show you something you can
[1:27:54] have the Holy Ghost and not know how to
[1:27:56] pay your
[1:27:58] ti you can have the Holy Ghost and not
[1:28:00] know how to dress come on church you can
[1:28:03] have the Holy Ghost amen and not know
[1:28:05] how to have church order in a service
[1:28:07] but thank God there was a voice of the
[1:28:09] son of man that was revealed in this age
[1:28:12] that brought some teaching to the house
[1:28:14] of
[1:28:15] God brother said Ean half an ear let him
[1:28:17] hear I'll just go ahead and get that
[1:28:19] devil out of the room right now I
[1:28:21] believe in Holy Ghost teaching I don't
[1:28:23] believe it's uninspired or intellectual
[1:28:26] or a bunch of refrigerated sermons come
[1:28:28] on I believe it's the word of God and I
[1:28:30] think what we ought to do is get back to
[1:28:32] doing what a prophet somebody say well
[1:28:35] amen amen I'm getting trouble how do we
[1:28:38] judge inspiration you know how I judge
[1:28:40] inspiration by the effect of the word on
[1:28:44] the people listen there's guys can out
[1:28:46] preach me I know that outshout me out
[1:28:48] dance me I know that but at the end of
[1:28:50] the day can we stay with a prophet when
[1:28:53] we're in the middle of the B ble can we
[1:28:55] stand with the prophet when everybody's
[1:28:57] walking away I say God give us some
[1:28:59] soldiers who will be obedient to the
[1:29:01] voice I say God give us some Mamas and
[1:29:04] some daddies who will be more than just
[1:29:06] church members but they will be Warriors
[1:29:09] in the greatest battle that has ever
[1:29:11] been fought and when the rubber hits the
[1:29:13] road they'll stand with the prophet of
[1:29:15] God come on Mama and Daddy when your
[1:29:17] baby looks at and says that's how a
[1:29:19] style you can say but I see the blessing
[1:29:22] that's going to be on you down the road
[1:29:24] so I'm going to stand with the message
[1:29:26] of the
[1:29:30] hour they say well that ain't inspired I
[1:29:34] I'm Hing I feel good this morning I've
[1:29:36] come to conclusion there's a lot of guys
[1:29:38] that would think brother BR wasn't
[1:29:40] inspired y'all know how he preached the
[1:29:43] Rapture sermon y'all know how he done it
[1:29:45] he stood by a table in a banquet and
[1:29:48] preached the revelation of the Rapture
[1:29:51] right he wasn't preaching like I am
[1:29:53] right now he wasn't running all over the
[1:29:55] building and sweating he was standing
[1:29:57] there but he was inspired because he was
[1:30:00] the voice of
[1:30:02] God said he that have an ear let him
[1:30:04] hear what the spirit not the man the
[1:30:06] spirit said to the church it may be that
[1:30:09] Millions will hear these words or read
[1:30:11] them but how many will pay heed to them
[1:30:14] that we do not know but he who will lend
[1:30:16] his ear and want to know the words of
[1:30:19] truth will find the spirit of God
[1:30:22] enlightening him if you're is open to
[1:30:24] the word if your ear is open to the word
[1:30:27] the spirit of God will make the word
[1:30:31] real to you my goodness so it's not the
[1:30:35] work of a man it's the work of the
[1:30:38] spirit I can teach you the truth but if
[1:30:41] you don't open your ear to hear it and
[1:30:43] your heart to receive it then you won't
[1:30:46] get the
[1:30:47] Revelation now brother goes on to say
[1:30:50] like this he says the only way to
[1:30:52] receive the things delivered from God is
[1:30:55] by the spirit of God now in Romans
[1:30:58] chapter 8 and verse 6 for to be carnally
[1:31:01] minded is death but to be spiritually
[1:31:03] minded is life and
[1:31:05] peace I just want to make sure we're all
[1:31:07] on the same page I believe in
[1:31:10] Inspiration I believe in the anointing I
[1:31:12] believe it the way a prophet taught
[1:31:15] it because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:31:18] against God it is not subject to the law
[1:31:21] of God and neither indeed can be say
[1:31:23] said someday he's coming and those that
[1:31:26] are in Christ will God bring with him
[1:31:28] when he comes see it's all a spiritual
[1:31:31] revealed truth and it's laying right
[1:31:33] there look and it takes a spiritual mind
[1:31:36] to catch it that's right he said a
[1:31:39] spiritual mind to catch it how many can
[1:31:41] testify listen what the pr of God says
[1:31:44] he said rest on that through the rest of
[1:31:46] the day but it takes a spiritual mind a
[1:31:50] how many's ever been in service and
[1:31:52] something was said and when it was you
[1:31:54] walked out and said I don't have a clue
[1:31:55] what that meant I don't understand it
[1:31:57] but you driving down the road or you out
[1:31:59] in the field or doing something Brother
[1:32:00] Kyle and all of a sudden that Revelation
[1:32:02] struck you and you said oh I see it I
[1:32:05] called it you know what that is that's
[1:32:07] because you don't have a carnal mind you
[1:32:09] have a spiritual mind and you've not
[1:32:12] Shackled that mind down with
[1:32:14] denominational filters look what the
[1:32:16] prop of God said he said we are hoping
[1:32:18] this morning that there is no carnal
[1:32:21] Minds Among Us that there is a spiritual
[1:32:24] mind Among Us that we could understand
[1:32:27] amen what the father is trying to get to
[1:32:29] us here listen the only thing that can
[1:32:32] catch the revelation of this word amen
[1:32:36] is a spiritual mind you say preacher
[1:32:38] what are you saying I'm saying that it
[1:32:40] seems the spiritual mind is becoming
[1:32:43] numb in the age we're living in now yall
[1:32:47] know what I'm talking about you see so
[1:32:48] much false and so much false and so much
[1:32:51] listen amen somebody get up and they
[1:32:53] they tell something and there's all
[1:32:54] kinds of loopholes in it and then all of
[1:32:56] a sudden you watch somebody's spirit
[1:32:58] amen they hear some false interpretation
[1:33:01] or some false discernment or some false
[1:33:03] prophecy amen now watch every time you
[1:33:05] go to tell something that person puts us
[1:33:08] uh uh how do I say puts a wall up amen
[1:33:11] because they've been hurt by one they
[1:33:13] say I won't be hurt by another let me
[1:33:15] say this that's the devil trying to numb
[1:33:18] your spiritual mind because only the
[1:33:21] spiritual mind can catch the word
[1:33:24] teachings of this day listen this
[1:33:27] message is full of more than just prayer
[1:33:30] lines it's full of more than just
[1:33:32] discernments it is full of word it is
[1:33:35] full of teachings you know what I say I
[1:33:37] say it's time to tear open the books
[1:33:39] it's time to break open the tapes again
[1:33:41] and get back in the message of the hour
[1:33:43] and begin to teach things until there
[1:33:45] comes a strength upon the body of Jesus
[1:33:49] Christ you say preacher you lost your
[1:33:51] mind no I've got a spiritual mind
[1:33:55] and I'll say this can I give you just a
[1:33:56] simple illustration amen of of a word
[1:33:59] teaching how many knows a prophet preach
[1:34:01] has spoken words Original Seed six- hour
[1:34:03] servon broke it up in three parts I
[1:34:05] ain't going that long this
[1:34:06] morning but he says in there he said
[1:34:09] there were three seeds swn he said there
[1:34:12] was a denominational seed which was swn
[1:34:14] by Billy Graham he said there was a
[1:34:16] Pentecostal seed which would be swn by o
[1:34:19] Roberts he said but then there was a
[1:34:21] word seed which would be the entire
[1:34:24] Bible and it would be sown by the
[1:34:26] seventh angel now today by revelation we
[1:34:29] can say the seventh angel is a man named
[1:34:32] William brandom but look the only the
[1:34:34] spiritual mind can understand that look
[1:34:37] what Paul said he said the natural man
[1:34:40] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:34:43] of God for they are foolish unto him
[1:34:46] neither can he know them because they
[1:34:48] are spiritually discerned so these word
[1:34:52] teachings that's laying in this message
[1:34:55] underneath the voice of the seventh
[1:34:56] angel it is foolishness to the world to
[1:34:59] the carnal to the Natural but to the
[1:35:02] elect of God it's Eagle food come on
[1:35:05] Church you didn't hear from your
[1:35:07] theophany on baptism and titles you
[1:35:10] didn't hear from your theophany Amen on
[1:35:12] women preachers or tongues is the
[1:35:14] evidence but when you heard the word for
[1:35:16] your hour said you heard the eagle
[1:35:18] scream he said you left the other thing
[1:35:21] and you come to this he said what is
[1:35:24] this it's the eagle food you heard from
[1:35:28] your theophany well if you want to go to
[1:35:30] church and have a good time and I'll say
[1:35:32] it like this we got to say something
[1:35:35] that our theophany agrees with our
[1:35:38] theophany does not agree with
[1:35:40] denominational teaching or psychology
[1:35:43] amen or a better approach to fix Devils
[1:35:45] our theophany agrees with Mark 16 they
[1:35:48] shall lay their hands on the sick and
[1:35:50] they shall re come on Church they shall
[1:35:53] take the word of God listen neither can
[1:35:55] he know them because they are
[1:35:57] spiritually discerned B said in adoption
[1:36:00] part one he said how many receive the
[1:36:02] promise of the Holy
[1:36:03] Spirit oh aren't you glad you're in the
[1:36:05] land how many's got the Holy Ghost he

[1:40:19] I a part of it Hallelujah the caral oh
[1:40:24] God the carnal mind will never include
[1:40:26] you in the revelation of the word of God
[1:40:29] but the spiritual mind will not just oh
[1:40:32] God Hallelujah the carnal mind just sees
[1:40:35] Malachi 4 and all they see is God and
[1:40:37] Elijah but the spiritual mind Sees God
[1:40:41] sending Elijah to Andrew Glover the
[1:40:44] spiritual mind Sees God sending Elijah
[1:40:47] to Chloe Reynolds you know why because
[1:40:49] the spiritual mind has been unbundled by
[1:40:52] the Holy Ghost and we've got the ability
[1:40:54] to feed on the strong things of
[1:40:58] God hallelujah I tell that devil get out
[1:41:01] of my way come on you know what I say I
[1:41:04] say start eating until you get some
[1:41:05] strength you can stand up and face that
[1:41:08] devil and say a few years ago devil you
[1:41:10] could wreck my mind you could wreck my
[1:41:12] spirit you could wreck my faith but
[1:41:14] today I know who I am I'm over in the
[1:41:17] land of
[1:41:18] inheritance I'm feeding on the word of
[1:41:21] God
[1:41:24] Hallelujah like Billy Paul said that man
[1:41:26] come in there said two men read the same
[1:41:28] book said one man got done reading it
[1:41:30] closed the book said I'll never read
[1:41:31] nothing else he looked up at him he said
[1:41:33] why he said that man called me a
[1:41:36] chicken the other man said funny thing
[1:41:39] is that man called me an
[1:41:40] eagle they read the same book come on
[1:41:44] Church they read the same words by the
[1:41:47] same Prophet by the same lingo by the
[1:41:50] same language by the same Kentucky
[1:41:52] accent but at the end of the book there
[1:41:54] was a whole different change you know
[1:41:56] why because one had a carnal mind and
[1:42:00] one had a spiritual mind I say oh Satan
[1:42:03] I defeat you this morning th filthy
[1:42:06] devil of a carnal mind that would try to
[1:42:08] block the blessings of God off of the
[1:42:11] Church of God I rebuke you in the name
[1:42:13] of Jesus I say Lord bring us a spiritual
[1:42:16] mind you know when you stop praising is
[1:42:19] when you take your spiritual mind and
[1:42:21] you get a carnal mind about situation
[1:42:24] you know when you stop believing God is
[1:42:26] the minute you trade the spiritual mind
[1:42:28] for a carnal mind and start trying to
[1:42:30] work things have you know what I say
[1:42:32] this morning I say throw away the carnal
[1:42:35] mind and get you a holy ghost filled
[1:42:37] spiritual mind that can believe God for
[1:42:40] everything that he
[1:42:41] said brother Wesley how I don't know but
[1:42:45] my mind is UN muddled and God is
[1:42:48] able He's Able what are you saying I'm
[1:42:51] saying we're living in the age or the
[1:42:53] Bible that has been wrote in symbols I'm
[1:42:55] running out of time has been wrote in
[1:42:58] symbols the spiritual mind is catching
[1:43:02] yeah it's catching the reality or the
[1:43:06] revelation of those symbols Daniel 2
[1:43:09] verse 33 his legs was of iron his feet
[1:43:13] was a part of iron and a part of clay
[1:43:15] thou sawest till a stone brother Matt
[1:43:18] there was a stone that was cut out
[1:43:20] without hands which smoke the image amen
[1:43:23] let's just let's just take a minute and
[1:43:24] read that okay Daniel 2:31 thou oh King
[1:43:27] sawest and behold a great image this
[1:43:30] great image whose brightness was
[1:43:32] excellent it stood before thee and the
[1:43:35] form thereof was terrible this image's
[1:43:38] head was of fine gold Daniel 2:32 of
[1:43:41] fine gold his breast and his arms of
[1:43:44] silver his belly and his thighs of brass
[1:43:48] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[1:43:50] and part of clay listen now th Solace
[1:43:53] till that a stone was cut out without
[1:43:56] hands with smoy image upon his feet that
[1:43:59] were of iron and Clay look and break
[1:44:02] them to Pieces somebody say that with me
[1:44:05] and break them to Pieces but there was a
[1:44:08] stone said now look did you notice right
[1:44:10] there when we brought out where that
[1:44:11] last great conference were Cru with five
[1:44:14] nations of the East and Eisenhower the
[1:44:16] leader the five nations of the West
[1:44:18] represented and the 10 toes of the image
[1:44:21] that would not mix and kusf took his
[1:44:24] shoe off and beat it he said the
[1:44:26] spiritual mind would pick that up right
[1:44:28] quick see he beat it on the desk see
[1:44:31] they will not mix now look I love this
[1:44:33] quote now the next thing is the coming
[1:44:37] of the stone so brother K the devil
[1:44:39] don't mind if you understand the tin
[1:44:41] toes amen but just don't catch the
[1:44:44] revelation of that stone he said there
[1:44:46] was a stone that was shoot out of the
[1:44:48] mountain without hands look and it
[1:44:51] rolled into the Gentile Kingdom till it
[1:44:53] will be finished and just before that
[1:44:56] time oh God and just before that time
[1:44:59] he's going to send this Angel to what
[1:45:02] church to Sodom no to the lukor no he
[1:45:06] sent it to the elected the called out
[1:45:08] Church what kind of sign did he show the
[1:45:10] same thing he did here last night amen
[1:45:13] God Elohim manifested in the person of
[1:45:17] the Holy Ghost in his church Hallelujah
[1:45:21] I feel like shouting on the next thing
[1:45:24] amen was the stone that come rolling out
[1:45:27] the mountain he said that ought to send
[1:45:28] us a million miles in the sky with
[1:45:30] shouts and Praises of his glory you say
[1:45:34] preacher why does that excite you
[1:45:36] because that stone is our lord Jesus
[1:45:42] christall God have mercy he said look
[1:45:44] the word of God always attracts that
[1:45:47] spiritual mind I'm going somewhere
[1:45:49] because it's the mind of Christ in you
[1:45:54] that knows that word is
[1:45:59] true when you get the spiritual mind of
[1:46:01] Christ in you it knows that word
[1:46:08] amen regardless of what anybody says
[1:46:11] that word right that
[1:46:14] word is true so the carnal mind it can
[1:46:20] catch the scientific advancements of the
[1:46:22] day but the spiritual mind catches the
[1:46:25] spiritual advancements of the day look
[1:46:28] here in Third Exodus I hope this okay he
[1:46:30] said I hope the spiritual mind can catch
[1:46:32] it he said I'm sure you do but I wonder
[1:46:34] out there anyhow you can't visit every
[1:46:36] nation but you can send tapes to it God
[1:46:39] will have some way to catch that mind
[1:46:42] out there where that seed is solded
[1:46:45] right oh Church the mind of Christ is
[1:46:49] solded in the Church of the Living God
[1:46:51] he said and as soon as that light
[1:46:53] strikes it brother claps his hands
[1:46:55] together once it's gone it takes life
[1:46:58] now let me say this if there is a seat
[1:47:00] in your soul God will find that seed it
[1:47:03] don't matter how he does it just be
[1:47:04] thankful that he did
[1:47:06] it y'all ever heard of a brother mckimm
[1:47:09] from West Virginia irvil mckimm he's an
[1:47:11] ity brother there brother irvil told me
[1:47:13] one time he said but Andrew he said I

[1:47:18] he said I seen this man toss something
[1:47:20] in the trash can and he kept on walking
[1:47:22] he said now the odest thing is something
[1:47:24] would speak to my heart and say go check
[1:47:26] that trash

[1:47:45] every question I had I love what brother
[1:47:48] said he but Andrew what was one man's
[1:47:50] trash was another Man's Treasure are you
[1:47:54] hearing me what was one man's trash was
[1:47:58] another man's treasure listen if there's
[1:48:00] a seed in there it's got to come forth
[1:48:03] if there's a seed with a spiritual mind
[1:48:06] listen God is going to have some oh God

[1:48:25] devil up he pre-arranged this from
[1:48:28] before the
[1:48:31] foundation of the world he already had
[1:48:35] somebody on the earth that had the
[1:48:37] secret seed in their soul that when the
[1:48:40] word would begin to be revealed they
[1:48:41] would catch
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] it he said like the woman at the well

[1:48:59] look see there was a Cay in there that
[1:49:01] come to life he said why she was looking
[1:49:05] for the manifestation of the word 400
[1:49:09] years since Malachi they had no prophets
[1:49:12] and here was a man that manifested to be
[1:49:15] a prophet quickly she know that was
[1:49:17] something yeah she said sir I perceive
[1:49:22] oh God
[1:49:23] yeah I perceive you are a prophet she
[1:49:27] said we know that when the Messiah
[1:49:30] cometh he's going to be that's going to
[1:49:32] be what he does can I just go ahead and
[1:49:35] say it and he looked at her and said I
[1:49:39] am he that
[1:49:43] speaks
[1:49:47] God I am he that speaks to
[1:49:51] you come on
[1:49:53] speaks I am he that speaks to you
[1:49:58] obey the voice of the
[1:50:04] son I am he listen he begin to speak to
[1:50:07] her he begin to declare something to her
[1:50:11] oh God he begin to declare what was in
[1:50:14] God's mind about
[1:50:17] her to
[1:50:19] her I am he that speaks to you now now
[1:50:22] he can reveal himself now look she has
[1:50:26] already received him he is now on the
[1:50:29] inside see he can make himself known
[1:50:35] listen she had five husbands and the one
[1:50:37] she was with right then wasn't her
[1:50:39] husband what when he begin to speak when
[1:50:42] he begin to articulate sounds when he
[1:50:44] begin to tell her things that nobody
[1:50:46] else knew but her she be to receive the
[1:50:50] voice that she was hearing you know what
[1:50:52] he said he said give me a
[1:50:55] drink brother Bobby that voice said give
[1:51:00] me a
[1:51:02] drink she didn't look at it and say let
[1:51:05] me think about it no she dropped her
[1:51:09] water bucket right she gave him a drink
[1:51:12] and she ran into the city what are you
[1:51:15] saying I'm saying the protag God said if
[1:51:17] God sends you the messenger and
[1:51:19] vindicates it by the signs he was a
[1:51:20] messenger sent from God then it's up to
[1:51:22] the to obey this messenger they must
[1:51:26] obey the messenger and have respects
[1:51:29] unto that messenger now let me just say
[1:51:32] this the evidence of obedience was not
[1:51:35] quoting what Moses said about the
[1:51:37] token the evidence of obedience was
[1:51:41] applying the blood as Moses said he said
[1:51:45] now look obedience if the token was not
[1:51:48] displayed then the Covenant was not
[1:51:50] effective see it must be because if you
[1:51:53] say you believe and you don't follow the
[1:51:55] instructions of the word then you don't
[1:51:58] believe he said see though you be
[1:52:00] circumcised though you join though you
[1:52:02] are baptized you done all these things
[1:52:04] like that that still ain't the token the
[1:52:06] Holy Ghost remember says like this he
[1:52:08] says obey don't just come this far I'm
[1:52:12] I'm tying this together don't just come
[1:52:14] this far and say I believe the
[1:52:17] message no you obey the messenger
[1:52:22] he said you come into Christ you saywell
[1:52:25] I believe every word said brother
[1:52:26] brandom that's good but that's just
[1:52:29] being able to read see take the message
[1:52:33] take it into your heart that you must
[1:52:36] have the token the very life that was in
[1:52:39] Christ be in
[1:52:40] you and when I see
[1:52:44] that I will pass over you y'all imagine
[1:52:50] if you go read Exodus 12 it's a it's a
[1:52:51] very powerful reading I'm not going to
[1:52:52] read it for the sake of time but read it
[1:52:54] and all the instructions yes sir he
[1:52:57] didn't just say Wesley didn't just say
[1:52:58] go get your lamb and slap some blood
[1:53:00] above the door no there's all kinds eat
[1:53:03] it this way roast you with herbs do this
[1:53:05] do that do all these things right and if
[1:53:09] the father would have cut corners on one
[1:53:13] thing if he would have changed one
[1:53:17] thing the death things would have come
[1:53:19] right through that house and took the
[1:53:21] first born
[1:53:23] yes sir are you with me look at Noah he
[1:53:26] receives the instructions to build the
[1:53:27] ark you know what he does he has to
[1:53:30] build it to the
[1:53:31] dimensions come on church if Noah would
[1:53:33] have been out there this has always been
[1:53:35] a quote that amazes me brother Wesley is
[1:53:37] Noah being a carpenter brother said Noah
[1:53:39] was a carpenter he said he took the
[1:53:42] dimensions and he went to work now let
[1:53:44] me just ask y'all something what
[1:53:45] Carpenter do you know that takes a set
[1:53:47] of plans and don't try to change
[1:53:50] him come on I grew up with a carpenter I
[1:53:53] never saw my grandfather get a set of
[1:53:55] plans and say well you know what that's
[1:53:57] exactly what we'll do he always looked
[1:53:59] at it and said we could do this we could
[1:54:00] change it's human nature but Noah was
[1:54:04] bringing deliverance and if he would
[1:54:06] have changed one thing on that Ark
[1:54:08] brother it would have went to the bottom
[1:54:10] of the waters but because Noah was in
[1:54:12] the hands of God and he was a mouthpiece
[1:54:15] for God he was an agent of Deliverance
[1:54:17] on the earth he had to stay underneath
[1:54:20] the instructions of The Voice was here
[1:54:23] let me say this to you Moses went out
[1:54:25] there Noah went out there and they
[1:54:27] obeyed God and because of their
[1:54:29] obedience it brought a blessing yes it
[1:54:33] brought a blessing upon the homes it
[1:54:35] brought a blessing upon Noah's family
[1:54:37] but can I say this to you this morning
[1:54:39] church how many says Lord if you did it
[1:54:41] for Abraham if you did it for Moses if
[1:54:44] you did it for Noah then I believe you
[1:54:46] can do it for me you can do it for my
[1:54:49] family you can do it for my babies you
[1:54:51] can do it for my church and the only
[1:54:53] thing will bring it is
[1:54:57] obedience you say what are you saying
[1:54:59] I'm saying the message is
[1:55:01] Christ it's the anointed word you say
[1:55:04] well brother Andrew I think the message
[1:55:05] is a better thought let me say this as
[1:55:07] plain as I know how the message is not a
[1:55:09] better
[1:55:11] thought the message is the only
[1:55:15] thought obedience to the voice I'm GNA
[1:55:18] close on this obedience to the voice
[1:55:21] causes you to
[1:55:25] surrender
[1:55:27] surrender your own
[1:55:31] thoughts I knew it' get quiet on that
[1:55:33] point obedience to the voice actually
[1:55:37] causes you to surrender your own
[1:55:41] thoughts look at Second Corinthians 10:5
[1:55:44] casting down the
[1:55:46] imaginations and every High
[1:55:50] thing you know imagination are
[1:55:53] real you know that and imaginations will
[1:55:55] have you imagine and people don't like
[1:55:57] you come
[1:55:59] on God they'll have you imagin and
[1:56:03] people don't like you and them
[1:56:05] imaginations will make you treat people
[1:56:07] that really love you like dirt all right
[1:56:10] well it's Sunday morning we might as
[1:56:12] well preach brother Bon you get to
[1:56:14] imagining well somebody didn't like me
[1:56:16] and somebody don't come on Church you
[1:56:18] know it's the truth imaginations are
[1:56:20] real but they're devils and they need to
[1:56:24] come subject to the word of God come on
[1:56:26] Church well brother so and so I tell you

[1:56:42] me I'm not going to go back because the
[1:56:44] Deacon don't like me and the whole time

[1:56:59] you what that imaginations do they will
[1:57:01] muddle up your spiritual mind and you'll
[1:57:03] sit in the house of God and you'll sit
[1:57:05] there and try to fix so and so and this
[1:57:07] one don't like me and she don't like me
[1:57:09] and I'm not a part of this and I was
[1:57:11] left out of that you know what I say I

[1:57:16] rebuke that ungodly carnal imagine in
[1:57:19] mind and we say give us a spiritual mind

[1:58:21] and he leave angered and he sat there

[1:58:25] babies to find the mind of God and he

[2:05:15] speaks I believe God still

[2:06:07] voice see I'll tell you why the devil
[2:06:09] don't want your mind
[2:06:11] clear because he knows when this word
[2:06:13] comes
[2:06:14] forth it's not your
[2:06:16] pastor it's not the Evangelist it's not
[2:06:19] the visiting Minister it's the word
[2:06:23] and he
[2:06:24] speaks and the devil knows if he can get
[2:06:26] your mind so muddled up that when that
[2:06:29] word goes to speak and that word's
[2:06:30] bouncing against a carnal mind but if
[2:06:33] the Holy Ghost can just come in and just
[2:06:37] move that carnal mind out when that word

[2:22:22] morning amen how many say that I I'm
[2:22:25] glad to have a
[2:22:27] voice that I can hear the Bible said he
[2:22:30] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[2:22:32] spirit says I'm just glad to have an ear
[2:22:34] to be able to hear that voice brother
[2:22:37] jar we I'm thankful I'm thankful for a
[2:22:39] voice that speaks amen the a voice that
[2:22:42] can give Direction that's what we that's
[2:22:45] what we always look for and all the
[2:22:47] technolog is trying to give you a voice
[2:22:49] to help you through every aspect of your
[2:22:51] life but I thank God that we have a
[2:22:52] voice that that that can answer every
[2:22:54] question he always he always knows the
[2:22:57] answer he knows which way we should turn
[2:22:59] in the direction that we ought to go and
[2:23:01] knows what we need to hear and I believe
[2:23:03] we've heard that voice this morning amen
[2:23:05] you believe that this morning you know
[2:23:07] the other the other day I was asked uh
[2:23:10] Sarah she was in the kitchen I as a
[2:23:12] husband you know how you lose things and
[2:23:15] and things they move inanimate objects
[2:23:18] move in my house and I hollered over at
[2:23:21] Sarah in a nice way I said Sarah where's
[2:23:24] my shoes and my phone spoke up and it
[2:23:27] said I cannot help you with that and
[2:23:30] Sarah sounds like Siri or something you
[2:23:32] know and I thought you know that Siri
[2:23:35] don't have the answer to everything no
[2:23:38] matter what you ask I can't help with
[2:23:40] this I can't help with that I'm limited
[2:23:41] in my ability to help but but my wife
[2:23:44] knew right where it was I thought you
[2:23:46] know that's the way it is with the Lord
[2:23:47] he knows where he knows where every
[2:23:49] Everything is everything in your life
[2:23:51] that's missing he knows where the
[2:23:52] missing pieces are he knows where you
[2:23:54] got to go to find it he knows how to put
[2:23:56] it together and I believe that if we'll
[2:23:57] hear the voice of God a brother told me
[2:23:59] the other day in service and or after
[2:24:02] the service he said you know some people
[2:24:03] was kind of picking on him about a
[2:24:06] prophet and I said you know I found an
[2:24:07] answer to that I said when somebody says
[2:24:09] anything about a prophet if I first off
[2:24:12] I say are you a Christian and and you
[2:24:13] know you you know if you'll get an
[2:24:15] answer if they don't reply yes to that
[2:24:17] well then they're it's a silly
[2:24:19] conversation from that point with you
[2:24:20] need to find Christ first then we'll
[2:24:21] worry about the rest of it but but yeah
[2:24:23] I'm a Christian would you believe in
[2:24:25] Prophecy well you can't be a Christian
[2:24:27] and not believe in Prophecy see because
[2:24:29] it's all through the scripture well you
[2:24:31] know if and if well I I don't know if I
[2:24:33] believe in that said well you know it's
[2:24:35] odd that the same Bible scripture that
[2:24:37] said that God sent a prophet is the same
[2:24:39] one that he said sent an evangelist and
[2:24:42] sent a pastor and sent a teacher and
[2:24:44] sent an apostle for the perfecting of
[2:24:46] the Saints so if he so if he's God at
[2:24:48] all and you can believe that God could
[2:24:50] send a pastor to help you through your
[2:24:53] current situation how many still believe
[2:24:54] that that God can give you a pastor that
[2:24:56] would help you how many believes he
[2:24:58] could give you an evangelist that could
[2:24:59] that could pick you up whenever you're
[2:25:01] down and bring a word from the Lord to
[2:25:02] lift you how many believes he sends
[2:25:04] Apostles and Setter in orders into into
[2:25:06] lands and to do missionary work see so
[2:25:08] if God can do all those things well then
[2:25:11] it's the same verse of scripture so see
[2:25:13] it's a but all all of it is is that we
[2:25:16] separated because of our carnal thinking
[2:25:19] but a spiritual mind said says it's all
[2:25:21] the same voice speaking Paul said it was
[2:25:24] a gift there's a diversity of gifts God
[2:25:26] gave some each of these he said but see
[2:25:28] it's the same voice of God all along
[2:25:31] isn't that wonderful it's hard for us to
[2:25:33] think that way because we look at each
[2:25:34] other in our flesh and to think that the
[2:25:36] same voice that spoke through a prophet
[2:25:38] can speak through my brother but you
[2:25:40] realize that that Prophet had brothers
[2:25:41] and sisters and and family members that
[2:25:43] probably said the same thing how could
[2:25:45] God speak through him just like we do
[2:25:47] one another but I believe that God
[2:25:49] speaks through us I believe he speaks to
[2:25:51] us he spoke through my brother this
[2:25:53] morning and he spoke to my heart and I
[2:25:55] believe that I thank God that I have a
[2:25:57] hear or an ear to hear the voice of God
[2:26:00] are you so thankful for it this morning
[2:26:02] amen want somebody give the Lord a hand
[2:26:04] clap of Praise this
[2:26:08] morning isn't it wonderful to be able to
[2:26:10] recognize Truth key of
