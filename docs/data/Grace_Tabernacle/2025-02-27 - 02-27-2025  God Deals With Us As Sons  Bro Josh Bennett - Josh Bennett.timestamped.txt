[47:17] to God Amen I I tell you I believe
[47:20] there's there's uh two debts that we owe
[47:24] it's really the only two debts we should
[47:26] owe and one is to give God all the glory
[47:30] and the other one is to love one another
[47:33] I manyan know that the Bible says that
[47:34] that's a debt we owe and we should owe
[47:37] no man any other debt than the than the
[47:40] debt that we have to love one another
[47:42] amen and we and we definitely owe it to
[47:45] God Amen to give him all the glory and

[48:57] you to come into this meeting and Lord
[49:00] we want you to take an active part Lord

[49:44] Lord we'll be careful to give you all
[49:46] the glory and the honor in Jesus name we
[49:49] pray amen amen God bless you tonight if
[49:52] you just take your Bibles we'll get
[49:54] right into the word and uh we just want
[49:57] to invite you to turn with us to the
[49:59] book of Hebrews in the 12th chapter of
[50:09] Hebrews Hebrews chapter
[50:13] 12 and I'd like to
[50:16] uh just read from the fifth verse
[50:27] and the scripture says and ye have
[50:29] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[50:31] unto you as unto
[50:34] children my son despise not thou the
[50:37] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[50:40] thou are rebuked of him for for whom the
[50:43] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[50:47] every son whom he
[50:50] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[50:52] dealth with you as with sons for what
[50:56] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[51:00] but if you be without chastisement
[51:02] whereof all are partakers then you are
[51:05] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[51:08] have had fathers of our flesh which have
[51:11] which corrected us and we gave them
[51:14] reverence shall we not much rather be in
[51:17] subjection unto the father of spirits
[51:19] and live for they verely for a few days
[51:22] chastened us after their own pleasure
[51:25] but he for our prophit that we might be
[51:29] partakers of his Holiness now no
[51:32] chastening for the present seeth to be
[51:34] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[51:37] afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of
[51:40] righteousness unto them which are
[51:42] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[51:46] hands which hang down and the feeble
[51:49] knees and make straight paths for your
[51:52] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[51:54] out of the way but let it rest rather be
[51:57] healed and follow peace with all men and
[51:59] Holiness without which no man shall see
[52:02] the Lord looking diligently lest any man
[52:06] fail of the grace of God lest any root
[52:09] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[52:11] and thereby many be defiled may God just
[52:15] add the blessing to the reading of the
[52:16] word as you're seated
[52:19] tonight I want to just speak to you
[52:22] tonight by God's help on God deals with
[52:26] us as
[52:27] Sons God deals with us as sons and I I
[52:32] believe it's a powerful Revelation when
[52:34] you begin to understand that we are the
[52:36] children of God and uh and when we say
[52:39] that we're the Sons and Daughters of God
[52:41] we're we're we're literally saying that
[52:44] we are God's
[52:45] Offspring in other words God we are
[52:48] something that came from God and so you
[52:52] know I I would just say it like this if
[52:54] God has children then they're going to
[52:55] be like him because you know when a man
[52:59] reproduces himself whatever is coming
[53:02] from him is something that's like him
[53:05] and so you know as we as I I thought
[53:07] about this you know the the scripture
[53:09] says I believe Paul writing here in the
[53:11] book of Hebrews he said him you have
[53:13] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[53:15] unto you as unto children and then he
[53:18] says my son despise not thou the
[53:21] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[53:23] thou are rebuked of him for whom the
[53:25] Lord loveth he chasteneth amen and and
[53:30] we know that the Bible says over in the
[53:32] Book of Revelations as many as I love I
[53:35] rebuke and chasen and and the prophet
[53:38] said in the church a book he said to
[53:40] rebuke is to reprove and to reprove is
[53:43] to expose with a view to correction see
[53:46] chasen chastening does not mean to
[53:49] punish it means to discipline because
[53:52] the subject's amendment is in mind I
[53:55] tell you I I I believe believe that so
[53:57] important for us to realize that God is
[53:59] Not punishing us amen but he is chasing
[54:03] he's he's chastising us sure but he's
[54:06] not punishing us amen but God is trying
[54:09] to bring us to Perfection is that right
[54:12] and then Paul would go on to say if you
[54:14] endure chastening God dealth with you as
[54:17] with sons amen as with sons now amen the
[54:21] Bible says over in the book of First
[54:22] John chapter 3 behold what manner of
[54:25] love the father has bestowed upon us
[54:27] that we should be called the sons of God
[54:31] therefore the world knoweth us not
[54:33] because it knew him not and then I love
[54:35] this word this verse beloved now we are
[54:38] the sons of God ain't that beautiful
[54:41] listen the Bible don't say we're going
[54:43] to be the sons of God one day but now we
[54:46] are the sons of God well I tell you what
[54:49] friends when you begin to realize you
[54:51] always was a Son of God Amen you was
[54:53] never made a Son of God you just come to
[54:55] a realiz realization of who you always
[54:59] was amen we were always Sons amen and so
[55:03] he says we are now the sons of God and
[55:06] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[55:08] but we know that when he shall appear we
[55:10] shall be like him for we shall see him
[55:13] as he is now amen as you think about
[55:15] that God deals with us as Sons or as his
[55:17] offspring Amen in other words you are a
[55:20] gene of God in the mind of God before
[55:23] the foundation of the world Amen you
[55:25] know just like brother Brown would say
[55:27] just like you were in your Earthly
[55:28] father you are also in God Amen you are
[55:32] in the mind of God Amen which is the
[55:35] loins of God because God don't reproduce
[55:38] himself like a man but God reproduces
[55:40] himself by Spoken Word and how many
[55:43] knows that a word is a thought expressed
[55:45] so then the prophet comes along and says
[55:47] that we were in the mind of God as a
[55:49] thought of God but for the foundation
[55:51] world I tell you that's beautiful
[55:53] tonight because before you ever made
[55:55] your first mistake
[55:57] amen you were a Son of God and God
[56:00] already knew you amen and he fornew you
[56:03] is that right how many knows that forn
[56:05] knowledge is knowledge beforehand in
[56:07] other words amen God knew you before you
[56:10] even knew yourself and before you ever
[56:12] got here God already knew you were
[56:15] coming I want to tell you God has
[56:17] children but God don't have no
[56:20] surprises amen some of us amen might
[56:23] have had a few surprises but God ain't
[56:26] he listen he don't have no surprises
[56:29] amen he's got a pre-planned
[56:31] family amen and all his children started
[56:34] out in his mind amen as a thought is
[56:38] that right amen I tell you what but just
[56:40] like you were in your father's seat and
[56:42] your natural father yet he could have no
[56:45] fellowship with you until you were
[56:47] birthed amen neither could God have
[56:50] fellowship with you until you were born
[56:53] again and although we were always Sons
[56:56] we had to be born again by the spirit of
[56:59] God Amen so that we could have
[57:01] fellowship with God amen amen as a Son
[57:05] of God Amen do you believe that tonight
[57:07] and that's why the Bible says God deals
[57:10] with us as Sons Amen in other words God
[57:13] is dealing with us as his offspring amen
[57:16] how many knows that God Amen desired to
[57:19] have a
[57:20] family now brother Brown was say in the
[57:22] church book he said here in is set forth
[57:24] the love of God he desired in love a
[57:26] family of his own a family of sons but
[57:31] don't miss this part he says Sons like
[57:33] himself so God didn't just want children
[57:36] but he wanted children like him he
[57:39] wanted Sons like himself now and in in
[57:42] in the adoption series brother Brown we
[57:45] talk about how that God was uh uh just
[57:47] the great Elohim and he was a
[57:49] self-existing one amen and he was known
[57:52] as Elohim amen the alls sufficient all
[57:55] powerful selfish existing God he said
[57:57] but then in Genesis 2 amen he made a man
[58:01] and he said I'm Jehovah amen and what
[58:03] did it mean I am all existing one who
[58:06] has created something off of
[58:09] myself he said to be a son of mine or an
[58:13] amateur little one of mine he said oh he
[58:16] gave man see Jehovah means that he gave
[58:18] man to be an amateur God because he is
[58:21] Father God and he made a man an amateure
[58:24] God so he isn't self existing anymore
[58:28] now he exists with his
[58:30] family hallelujah amen God existing with
[58:34] his family and God created man to be to
[58:38] to have predominant over all the Earth
[58:42] he had a dominion and Earth was man's
[58:44] Dominion is that the scripture amen then
[58:46] he was a god of the earth he could speak
[58:49] and it would be so he could speak this
[58:52] and it would be so amen listen for amen
[58:55] why because he amen was a Son of God or
[58:58] an offspring of God is that right he
[59:01] said there you are it was God now
[59:04] existing with his family his little ones
[59:07] with him I love that amen now remember
[59:11] God is dealing with us as Sons or as his
[59:15] children as his
[59:16] offspring brother Brown would say in the
[59:19] church age book he would give an example
[59:21] of how that God in every age would
[59:23] always praise the church chur or the
[59:26] elect of that age and he would he would
[59:29] uh you know brother Brown would give the
[59:30] example in the Ephesian age how that God
[59:33] would say I Know Thy works and thy labor
[59:35] and thy patience and how thou canest or
[59:37] can't bear those which are evil and thou
[59:39] has tried them which say they are
[59:41] Apostles and or not and found them liars
[59:43] and has born and has patience and for my
[59:46] name's sake has labored and has not
[59:48] fainted and brother Brown would take
[59:49] that and the in the church AG book and
[59:51] and show how he said how beautifully the
[59:54] the Savior praises and commends his
[59:56] children see he takes full account of
[59:59] their fine spiritual attitudes and
[1:00:01] behavior he knows that there's weakness
[1:00:04] among
[1:00:05] them but as of yet he does not cry out
[1:00:08] against it he said isn't that just like
[1:00:11] our Lord he knows how to encourage Us in
[1:00:14] the right ma matters and discourage Us
[1:00:17] in the wrong is that right we could all
[1:00:20] learn a good lesson right here in
[1:00:21] running our church and our families and
[1:00:23] better still we could learn a good
[1:00:25] lesson in that God deals with each one
[1:00:27] of us exactly this way see don't ever be
[1:00:31] discouraged saint of God for God is not
[1:00:34] ungracious to forget your labors of Love
[1:00:37] ain't that beautiful that before God
[1:00:39] ever rebuke them he first commended
[1:00:43] them amen and the prophet of God said
[1:00:46] see why amen why would God do that amen
[1:00:49] because God is dealing with you as his
[1:00:51] children he's dealing with you as his
[1:00:54] sons
[1:00:56] amen but as many as the Lord loveth he
[1:00:59] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:01:02] he
[1:01:03] receiveth and then he says as many as I
[1:01:06] love I
[1:01:08] rebuke now you got to catch this because
[1:01:11] amen you know I know we live in a
[1:01:13] generation of uh of what they call
[1:01:15] gentle parenting and you know and and
[1:01:19] people don't believe in correcting their
[1:01:21] children no more and all that kind of
[1:01:22] stuff and that just seems to be
[1:01:24] oldfashioned amen but the prophet of God
[1:01:26] said we need some of them Old Kentucky
[1:01:28] mamies around again amen that that that
[1:01:31] remembers amen that they got a
[1:01:35] responsibility and look amen because
[1:01:38] amen people have it in their mind that
[1:01:41] less correction means more freedom anden
[1:01:44] that there if there's no chastisement
[1:01:47] then you got more Liberty but I want to
[1:01:49] tell you it ain't nothing but a
[1:01:52] lie amen because I tell you amen what is
[1:01:54] going to produce is is a bunch of
[1:01:57] jellyfish amen generation with no
[1:02:00] backbone entitled thinking everybody
[1:02:03] owes them something they'll never be
[1:02:06] able to stand the
[1:02:08] pressure can you say amen and God don't
[1:02:11] want his family like that as a matter of
[1:02:14] fact God is looking for a bride to rule
[1:02:17] and reign with him in a millennium and
[1:02:20] then throughout all
[1:02:21] eternity and God knows if I'm going to
[1:02:24] have a people or a family or a bride
[1:02:26] that's going to share my power she's
[1:02:29] also going to have to have my character
[1:02:32] and the only way she can get my
[1:02:33] character is she's got to share my
[1:02:36] suffering and there's going to have to
[1:02:38] be correction and chastisement she's
[1:02:41] going to have to stand
[1:02:44] rebuke is that right as many as I love I
[1:02:47] rebuke and Chason is that right now the
[1:02:51] prophet said in the church a book The
[1:02:53] emphasis in the Greek is upon the
[1:02:54] personal Pro of I he does not say as
[1:02:57] many as would feel he should say as many
[1:02:59] as love me he said as many as I
[1:03:03] love see we we we must never try to make
[1:03:07] Jesus the object of human love in this
[1:03:09] verse no amen it is the many that are
[1:03:12] loved ones of God it is his love in
[1:03:15] question not ours brother BR would go on
[1:03:17] to say he said listen we can't say that
[1:03:20] God you know is just a he loved the
[1:03:22] whole of humanity and then he's waiting
[1:03:25] on on on men to fall in love with him so
[1:03:28] that he can express his love to
[1:03:31] them and he said that's not how it is at
[1:03:34] all he's already declared his
[1:03:37] love and the problem said his love is
[1:03:39] elective love ain't got nothing to do
[1:03:42] with human marit at
[1:03:44] all God Don't Love You CZ you deserved
[1:03:48] it God loves you because he saw amen
[1:03:52] through predestination and election amen
[1:03:55] he saw something in you that you can't
[1:03:58] even see in
[1:04:01] yourself Hallelujah I'm glad tonight
[1:04:04] it's not my loving question it's God's
[1:04:06] love that he's declared to
[1:04:10] me I remember years ago I heard brother
[1:04:12] per green say this he said and I I've
[1:04:14] bared it many times he said listen there
[1:04:16] ain't nothing you can do to make God
[1:04:19] love you
[1:04:21] anymore and there ain't nothing you can
[1:04:23] do to make God love you any less
[1:04:27] you say well brother what's this all
[1:04:29] about I tell you amen listen God there's
[1:04:31] nothing you can do to make God love you
[1:04:33] anymore or any less but I keep falling
[1:04:36] in love with him over and over and over
[1:04:41] and over again listen friends amen God
[1:04:43] couldn't love me no more than he did at
[1:04:45] the beginning but I love him more now
[1:04:48] than I ever
[1:04:50] did Hallelujah and the more God reveals
[1:04:53] himself to me and and Reveals His grace
[1:04:56] in my life I keep falling in love with
[1:05:02] him amen but his love is elective love
[1:05:07] amen and he declared it in the Book of
[1:05:08] Romans he said Jacob have I loved and
[1:05:12] Esau have I hated and the Bible is is is
[1:05:16] very specific in saying that before
[1:05:18] either one of them boys done anything
[1:05:20] good or bad God had already declared his
[1:05:24] love for one and and he already said
[1:05:26] that he hated the
[1:05:27] other is that right that the purpose of
[1:05:31] election might stand amen the prophet is
[1:05:35] using these scriptures to prove to us
[1:05:37] that God's love is elective
[1:05:41] love and and now he says to his own as
[1:05:44] many as I
[1:05:45] love I
[1:05:48] rebuke man now now
[1:05:52] remember this this rebuke is to to
[1:05:56] reprove it's it's to expose with a view
[1:05:59] to
[1:06:01] correction now the prophet would then
[1:06:04] read the verses that we read as a text
[1:06:06] tonight and then he said heing is set
[1:06:09] forth the love of
[1:06:10] God he desired in love a family of his
[1:06:13] own a family of Sons Sons like himself
[1:06:16] see and there before him lies all
[1:06:19] mankind and one lump of clay and out of
[1:06:23] that same lump he will now make vessels
[1:06:25] under honor and unto dishonor the
[1:06:28] choosing will be his own
[1:06:30] choosing then those chosen ones born of
[1:06:34] his spirit will be trained to be
[1:06:37] conformed Into His Image in their walk
[1:06:40] see he reproves with all longsuffering
[1:06:43] and gentleness and mercy he chastens
[1:06:46] with nail scarred hands and sometimes a
[1:06:49] Potter must take the vessel that he's
[1:06:51] working on and thoroughly break it down
[1:06:53] in order that he may rebuild it it's
[1:06:55] exactly or that he may rebuild it
[1:06:57] exactly like he desires but it is love
[1:07:01] that is his love another way of his love
[1:07:02] there is not there cannot
[1:07:06] be now you know God's love has been
[1:07:09] misunderstood many times because like we
[1:07:13] like
[1:07:14] Israel a lot of times we think love
[1:07:16] means no suffering well if God loves us
[1:07:20] then we shouldn't
[1:07:21] suffer you know Israel had the same
[1:07:23] question there in the Book of Malachi
[1:07:25] they they said the the the Bible says
[1:07:27] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:07:29] Israel by Malachi I have loved you say
[1:07:31] the Lord yet we say where inest thou
[1:07:34] loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother
[1:07:37] sayith the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I
[1:07:39] hated Esau and I laid his mountain in
[1:07:42] his Heritage Wass for the dragons of in
[1:07:44] of the Wilderness you see they could not
[1:07:46] figure out God's love they thought that
[1:07:48] love meant no suffering they thought
[1:07:51] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:07:53] parental care but God said his love was
[1:07:55] elective love and the proof of his love
[1:07:58] is
[1:08:00] election no matter what happened his
[1:08:03] love is proven truly by the fact that we
[1:08:05] are chosen under salvation because God
[1:08:09] had chosen you to Salvation through the
[1:08:10] sanctification of the spirit and a
[1:08:12] belief of the truth he may commit you to
[1:08:14] death as he did Paul he may commit you
[1:08:16] to suffering as he did job that's his
[1:08:19] prerogative he's Sovereign but it's all
[1:08:22] with a
[1:08:23] purpose if he did not have a purpose and
[1:08:26] he would be the author of frustration
[1:08:28] and not of Peace but his purpose is that
[1:08:32] after we have suffered a while amen we
[1:08:34] would be made perfect and established
[1:08:37] strengthened and settled amen and job
[1:08:40] said he put strength in US you see
[1:08:43] himself suffered he himself suffered
[1:08:46] speaking of Jesus and learned obedience
[1:08:48] by the things that he suffered he was
[1:08:50] actually made perfect by the things that
[1:08:52] he
[1:08:52] suffered is that the Bible though he
[1:08:54] were a
[1:08:56] son yet he learned obedience by the
[1:08:58] things that he suffered and being made
[1:09:00] perfect he become the author of Eternal
[1:09:02] salvation of them that that obey him in
[1:09:05] plain language the very character of
[1:09:07] Jesus was per perfected by
[1:09:10] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:09:12] left the church a measure of suffering
[1:09:14] that they
[1:09:16] too by their faith in God while
[1:09:18] suffering for him would be would come to
[1:09:20] a place of
[1:09:23] perfection see God deals with us as Sons
[1:09:26] now God never corrects us to punish or
[1:09:29] and God ain't trying to make you pay for
[1:09:31] your
[1:09:32] sins that's listen friends if God if God
[1:09:35] was going to make us pay for our sins
[1:09:37] then it then Calvary was in
[1:09:40] vain see God ain't trying to make us pay
[1:09:42] for our sins amen he's bringing us he's
[1:09:45] correcting us sure chasing us absolutely
[1:09:50] but God is Not punishing us or trying to
[1:09:52] make us pay listen friends that's why we
[1:09:54] don't believe in no purgatory and all
[1:09:57] that kind of Catholic nonsense they
[1:09:59] don't realize but that Doctrine is
[1:10:01] nothing but diminishing the power of the
[1:10:03] blood of Jesus Christ and the price he
[1:10:06] paid on
[1:10:07] Calvary come on church I tell you what
[1:10:10] that might be their revelation of their
[1:10:12] sacrifice but I got a greater revelation
[1:10:15] of My
[1:10:17] Sacrifice there's a reason why I ain't
[1:10:19] got to suffer for my sin it's because he
[1:10:22] bore my
[1:10:24] grief he he bore my
[1:10:27] pain Hallelujah the chastisement of my
[1:10:30] peace was upon
[1:10:32] him and by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:10:35] tonight do you believe
[1:10:38] that so you see but I'm telling you amen
[1:10:41] what what what if if God helped me
[1:10:43] tonight I'm just going to tear amen the
[1:10:45] ground right out from under the devil
[1:10:48] because every time you go through a
[1:10:50] trial the devil's right there to say you
[1:10:53] deserve this
[1:10:56] you've done something wrong and that's
[1:10:57] why you're going through this and God is
[1:11:00] punishing you and eventually he's going
[1:11:02] to turn the things so amen that he's
[1:11:05] going to say if you was really a child
[1:11:07] of God you wouldn't be suffering like
[1:11:09] this or if you was really bride you
[1:11:11] wouldn't be going through
[1:11:14] this but I can take the scripture
[1:11:16] tonight and prove to you on the on the
[1:11:21] contrary hallelujah amen I love the
[1:11:24] message of the eye
[1:11:26] thank God for a prophet cuz he can read
[1:11:28] the book of Job and he could say job
[1:11:30] wasn't going through that cuz he was a
[1:11:32] secret sinner Joe was going through that
[1:11:35] because God had
[1:11:40] confidence Hallelujah God was going to
[1:11:43] prove to the devil that I got a man on
[1:11:47] the earth I don't care what you do to
[1:11:50] him you can put him through the pr and
[1:11:52] he'll come out praising me you can take
[1:11:55] away everything he's got and he's still
[1:11:57] going to praise me
[1:11:59] anyhow hallelujah amen and and there's
[1:12:02] one thing joob never
[1:12:04] lost he never lost his
[1:12:09] Integrity is that
[1:12:13] right because
[1:12:15] God deals with you as
[1:12:19] sons and God wants Sons like
[1:12:24] him so God is putting a character in
[1:12:28] you that can only there's only one way
[1:12:31] you get
[1:12:33] it I'm just going to tell you we want
[1:12:36] trials that ain't
[1:12:39] Trials come on friends we we want trials
[1:12:42] but we don't want trial we want trials
[1:12:44] with that really ain't
[1:12:47] trials amen you understand what I
[1:12:50] mean amen but God Amen wants to put
[1:12:53] something in you
[1:12:57] a character listen friends God ain't
[1:13:00] just want sons he wants adopted
[1:13:03] Sons God's looking for adopted Sons amen
[1:13:08] God that's why amen he's taking you
[1:13:09] through the training
[1:13:12] process amen he's bringing you to a
[1:13:14] place amen amen that you can stand as a
[1:13:17] Son of
[1:13:20] God Bible says for as many as led are
[1:13:22] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:13:25] sons of God for you have not received
[1:13:28] the spirit of bondage again uh uh to
[1:13:30] fear but have received the spirit of
[1:13:33] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the
[1:13:37] spirit itself bear witness with our
[1:13:39] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:13:41] and if children then hirs Heirs of God
[1:13:44] and join HS with Christ it so be that we
[1:13:46] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:13:49] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:13:52] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:13:55] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:13:58] that shall be revealed in
[1:14:00] us hallelujah for the earnest
[1:14:04] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:14:06] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:14:08] Amen how many knows that that that the
[1:14:10] whole earth is trembling and travailing
[1:14:12] even now amen what is it for amen
[1:14:15] longing for the manifestation of the
[1:14:17] sons of
[1:14:18] God the prophet said go right back to
[1:14:21] Genesis to the original what is it the
[1:14:23] world in nature is groaning in ing
[1:14:25] everything I is moving what for the
[1:14:28] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:14:30] true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak
[1:14:36] and their word is
[1:14:38] backed I believe we're on the border of
[1:14:40] it right now that's 1960 friends I
[1:14:42] believe we're on the border of it right
[1:14:44] now yes sir when we'll say this mountain
[1:14:46] let it be so brother I desire so so and
[1:14:49] so a certain thing to be done I'm a
[1:14:51] Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to
[1:14:53] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] there's a manifestation oh brother my
[1:14:58] crops are burning out you H I ain't got
[1:15:00] no rain I'll send you rain in the name
[1:15:02] of the Lord God and bless your cross oh
[1:15:04] waiting and groaning all nature waiting
[1:15:06] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:15:08] God ordained it at the beginning he gave
[1:15:11] man a
[1:15:15] domain friends that's God's
[1:15:17] desire to have a family of
[1:15:20] sons like him
[1:15:28] listen friends that's why because that's
[1:15:30] what the prophet is showing you
[1:15:32] everything as God Is chastening
[1:15:37] Us sometimes Hey listen I know I've been
[1:15:40] whipped by
[1:15:42] God and I know any of y'all I know some
[1:15:44] of you been serving God a long time and
[1:15:47] and we know what it's
[1:15:49] like amen we've been we we've been
[1:15:51] through those times amen but you know
[1:15:54] what when you come out on the other side
[1:15:56] you always have the
[1:15:58] testimony I'm better now than I ever
[1:16:00] have been it only brought me closer to
[1:16:03] him it was all for my good amen God Amen
[1:16:08] had had your amendment in mind God was
[1:16:11] bringing you to Perfection it was all
[1:16:13] with a
[1:16:16] purpose though no chastening seems to be
[1:16:19] joyful in the present see as Paul would
[1:16:22] say for the present it seems to be be
[1:16:26] Grievous but but nevertheless afterward
[1:16:28] it brings forth Peaceable
[1:16:30] fruit of righteousness is that
[1:16:34] right amen listen if it don't hurt it
[1:16:36] ain't going to serve its
[1:16:40] purpose amen you know and you think
[1:16:42] about how how you easy it is to
[1:16:45] misunderstand this because you know you
[1:16:48] can think about I'll give you examples
[1:16:49] in the scripture think about David and
[1:16:52] here David is a little Shepherd boy you
[1:16:54] know a a and and and here comes uh uh
[1:16:57] you know Samuel down down there and with
[1:17:00] a horn of oil amen the prophet comes
[1:17:03] anoints David to be king of Israel David
[1:17:05] you know what you know what's amazing to
[1:17:07] me that that after David was anointed to
[1:17:10] be king of Israel David didn't go right
[1:17:12] to the
[1:17:14] throne after that great
[1:17:17] event of the prophet Samuel coming down
[1:17:20] Amen to Jesse's house and all Jesse's
[1:17:23] Sons walking before him say no he's not
[1:17:25] it and he's not a ain't you got another
[1:17:27] one yeah he's out there in the field go
[1:17:28] get him go fetch him amen somebody goes
[1:17:31] out there brings David up there the
[1:17:33] prophet Samuel anoints with o you know
[1:17:35] after all that was over with his dad
[1:17:38] just looked at I guess and just said go
[1:17:40] on back out there and tend them
[1:17:43] sheep think about that amen now he's
[1:17:47] anointed king of
[1:17:49] Israel they didn't build him a special
[1:17:51] room in the
[1:17:53] house amen his daddy didn't look at all
[1:17:55] his brothers say now you serve him and
[1:17:58] and you know make sure no hey and David
[1:18:00] ain't going to work another day in his
[1:18:02] life no he just went right back out in
[1:18:04] the field and started tending sheep
[1:18:10] again and and think about this here
[1:18:13] comes a a
[1:18:15] lion and here comes a
[1:18:18] bear and you know what a lot of people
[1:18:21] would have you know what have happened
[1:18:22] right there for a lot of people they
[1:18:24] would have said bad things just keep
[1:18:26] happening to
[1:18:27] me and I barely escaped I barely escaped
[1:18:30] the bear and I barely escaped the line
[1:18:32] and I just can't believe if God anointed
[1:18:34] me to be king of Israel why does he keep
[1:18:36] letting these bad things happen in my
[1:18:39] life I thought I was chosen of God I
[1:18:41] thought I was anointed to be the king of
[1:18:43] Israel why do he allow that Lon to come
[1:18:45] why do he allow that bear to come I tell
[1:18:47] you why because God knew there was a
[1:18:49] giant that was in front of
[1:18:52] David and God was going to use a line
[1:18:56] and he was going to use a
[1:18:57] bear that David could stand out there
[1:19:00] before that Gass and we heard the boast
[1:19:03] of that devil he can he can stand there
[1:19:05] and say you come to me with a spear and
[1:19:08] a sword but I come to you in the name of
[1:19:11] the
[1:19:13] Lord hallelujah and just like God SLE
[1:19:16] the Li and just like he deliver the Bei
[1:19:20] you will be just like them
[1:19:26] think about that
[1:19:28] tonight because David was going to the
[1:19:31] throne that's why God allowed him to
[1:19:34] face a blind and a bear and a giant
[1:19:36] because he was making a
[1:19:40] king but ain't amazing David could have
[1:19:43] easily took the attitude while I just
[1:19:44] don't understand it bad things just keep
[1:19:46] happening to me I thought God loved
[1:19:50] me think about
[1:19:53] Joseph and Joseph you know you know he
[1:19:56] he's God gives him dreams and visions
[1:19:58] and shows him that he's going to the
[1:20:00] throne and and he and you know and that
[1:20:03] his brothers is going to bow down before
[1:20:05] him and and the position that he's going
[1:20:07] to hold and all these things that God
[1:20:09] shows Joseph and when it was all said
[1:20:11] and done his brothers hated
[1:20:14] him next thing you know they they they
[1:20:17] cast him in the pit sold him into
[1:20:21] slavery robbed him of his coat amen went
[1:20:25] lied to their father amen Joseph ends up
[1:20:28] down in Egypt and just when things start
[1:20:30] getting better that's
[1:20:33] right his master's wife tells a lie on
[1:20:36] him he ends up in
[1:20:40] prison don't you think Joseph could have
[1:20:42] said I just don't get it I thought I
[1:20:47] must have
[1:20:48] misunderstood the
[1:20:50] vision I miss I must have misunderstood
[1:20:53] you know I I thought thought God had
[1:20:55] chose me to you know I I thought I was
[1:20:57] chosen of God I thought I was destined
[1:20:59] for greatness I thought even God was
[1:21:01] going to use me in a great way but it
[1:21:04] just seems like everything bad happens
[1:21:05] and it's just one thing after another
[1:21:07] and just when I get on my feet something
[1:21:09] else comes
[1:21:11] along come on church but you know what
[1:21:14] God was doing he was leading him to a
[1:21:18] throne hallelujah amen God thought when
[1:21:22] he was going in the pit he was on the
[1:21:24] way to the throne when he was sold into
[1:21:26] slavery he was going to the throne when
[1:21:28] he was cast into prison he was on his
[1:21:31] way to the
[1:21:33] throne Hallelujah and when he got there
[1:21:36] he had been through
[1:21:38] enough that he could look at his
[1:21:40] brothers at the right time and say you
[1:21:43] meant it for evil but God meant it for
[1:21:48] good Hallelujah don't
[1:21:51] fear God did this to preserve
[1:22:04] life
[1:22:05] said he said many weary and
[1:22:10] MN been pushed about
[1:22:12] all for their own
[1:22:17] good many weary and
[1:22:20] worn being pushed
[1:22:23] about all all for their own
[1:22:27] good their child
[1:22:30] training to bring them up in the
[1:22:32] admiration of God trials are worth more
[1:22:35] than silver and
[1:22:36] gold but it's written no chastisement is
[1:22:39] Pleasant for the time being see but
[1:22:42] finally when the church becomes to have
[1:22:44] this training or its training then they
[1:22:47] will become adopted Sons or place Sons
[1:22:49] to inherit into the inherit of God which
[1:22:52] shall inherit all things and be equal in
[1:22:54] powers and blessings of the Son of God
[1:22:56] Brothers Listen another place he says
[1:22:59] sons and daughters and who has the most
[1:23:01] power before God ain't this powerful
[1:23:03] brother BR said who has more Authority
[1:23:06] an angel in heaven or a son on the
[1:23:10] earth it's a son see amen cuz an angel
[1:23:15] is a servant but what are you a son and
[1:23:17] a daughter Hallelujah that's been saved
[1:23:21] by the grace of
[1:23:23] God we'll have more Authority in heaven
[1:23:25] than the Archangel that stood by his
[1:23:29] side I want just watch this because I
[1:23:33] don't know what time it is oh my
[1:23:37] Mercy
[1:23:39] but
[1:23:42] Hallelujah catch this because Paul
[1:23:45] says and you have
[1:23:49] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:23:51] unto you as children now I want you to
[1:23:53] catch this
[1:23:55] because these Believers have become
[1:23:57] discouraged because they have
[1:24:01] forgotten am me because one reason for
[1:24:04] discouragement is because when you see
[1:24:07] no reason that God would allow difficult
[1:24:09] times to arise see you forget the
[1:24:13] principles of the scriptures that that
[1:24:15] God chastens them that he
[1:24:17] loves mean God is Desiring a family like
[1:24:22] himself see
[1:24:26] you know I think there's a lot of
[1:24:27] difficult times that comes in our lives
[1:24:29] by by that phrase we
[1:24:37] forgot you know the prodical son if I
[1:24:42] could just maybe use this for a little
[1:24:46] bit he got to the place that he
[1:24:52] forgot and and you know you know what I
[1:24:54] love about that that Parable in the
[1:24:56] scripture is that Jesus never told that
[1:24:59] that story to show the evil of the
[1:25:04] boy go read it friends go Jesus didn't
[1:25:06] tell that even brother Brown said in the
[1:25:08] message he preached prodal he said Jesus
[1:25:11] told this Parable to show us the love of
[1:25:14] the father to a wward
[1:25:17] son so when Jesus is telling the the
[1:25:21] parable of the prodical son he's not
[1:25:22] telling it to show you how evil that
[1:25:24] that boy is he's showing you amen the
[1:25:28] love of the
[1:25:30] father to a son that is
[1:25:34] lost and now just think about that
[1:25:36] because we know that you know he was
[1:25:39] Reckless and wasteful and
[1:25:42] foolish and but he but all those things
[1:25:45] caused him to forget who he
[1:25:48] was and the Bible says and when he had
[1:25:50] spent all there arose a mighty famine in
[1:25:52] the land and he began to be want and he
[1:25:55] went and joined himself to a citizen of
[1:25:57] that country and he sent him into the
[1:25:59] fields to feed the
[1:26:02] swine and when he had filled his belly
[1:26:04] with the husk of the swine did eat and
[1:26:06] we know what a you know to a Jew this is
[1:26:09] just a they they didn't have no dealings
[1:26:11] with pigs you you understand amen but
[1:26:14] now he's eating with the
[1:26:16] pigs amen and the Bible said when he had
[1:26:19] filled his belly with the husk of the
[1:26:21] swine amen the Bible says that he did
[1:26:24] eat and no man gave unto him and when he
[1:26:27] came to
[1:26:30] himself when he came to himself listen
[1:26:34] friends what happened he
[1:26:38] remembered amen and what did he remember
[1:26:40] he said how many hired Servants of my
[1:26:43] father's house I tell you what he come
[1:26:45] to he remembered that he had a
[1:26:49] daddy he remembered he out of
[1:26:52] Father Hallelujah even brother Brown
[1:26:55] said he said think of the father amen
[1:26:57] that has all the wealth he has all the
[1:27:00] things that he has given me and here I
[1:27:02] am laying and dying of hunger laying in
[1:27:04] a hog pin eating slop the Bible said he
[1:27:06] came to himself and that's what the
[1:27:08] church needs today is to come to
[1:27:10] themselves and realize who is your
[1:27:12] father for sometimes we act as though we
[1:27:15] have no Heavenly Father for all the
[1:27:18] goodness of Heaven belongs to the church
[1:27:21] Divine Healing and salvation freedom of
[1:27:24] amen from worry and anything belongs to
[1:27:27] the church Jesus died that we would
[1:27:29] inherit all the things of God through
[1:27:32] him we're HS of the Kingdom my father is
[1:27:35] rich in houses and in lands he holds the
[1:27:37] wealth of the world in his hands that's
[1:27:39] how we are we just need to come to
[1:27:43] ourself Hallelujah and remember we got a
[1:27:46] father
[1:27:49] tonight I'll tell you what that boy's
[1:27:51] problem was he had forgot
[1:27:55] he forgot he was a son he forgot he had
[1:27:58] a
[1:28:00] father I tell you this I believe that
[1:28:02] God has got a pig pin for every
[1:28:05] prodal come on church amen and and watch
[1:28:09] amen because in that story that Daddy
[1:28:11] was going to deal with him as a
[1:28:13] son that's why he didn't send him a
[1:28:16] check every
[1:28:18] week come on church are you hearing me
[1:28:21] amen and that boys amen rebellious
[1:28:24] uh condition when he went went Wayward
[1:28:27] amen that daddy wasn't sending him a
[1:28:28] check in the mail every week to get him
[1:28:30] out of every problem that he ever had he
[1:28:33] allowed him to get all the way down in a
[1:28:35] pig
[1:28:36] pin because he knew that's my boy and
[1:28:40] I'm his daddy and he's got to
[1:28:44] remember come on church he might have to
[1:28:46] get all the way down on his back before
[1:28:49] he looks up to me but I'm going to allow
[1:28:52] the situations
[1:28:56] not because he didn't love him he did it
[1:28:58] because he did love him and it was in
[1:29:01] the big bin that that boy remembered
[1:29:03] amen that he had a
[1:29:06] father telling you that church God's got
[1:29:08] a pig pin for every
[1:29:11] prodical hey there's a lot of other
[1:29:13] people eating in that pig pin amen but
[1:29:14] none of them come

[1:30:40] and brother BR would talk to take that
[1:30:42] in the church they B he said amen

[1:31:56] return first in their mind and then in
[1:32:00] reality that's a perfect example of the
[1:32:02] prodical son he had to first
[1:32:05] remember he came to

[1:40:25] sick if I got money in the bank if there
[1:40:28] ain't no money in the bank I'm not
[1:40:31] praising God because of my
[1:40:35] condition come on church and by the way
[1:40:37] while we're right there I just tell you
[1:40:39] this we need to stop praising God
[1:40:41] because of how we
[1:40:44] feel feelings ain't got nothing to do
[1:40:47] with
[1:40:48] it come on friends and here's another

[1:41:08] worthy come on church and when you get a
[1:41:11] revelation in your heart hey amen if he

[1:41:16] and the lord taketh away blessed be the
[1:41:21] name of the Lord
[1:41:29] Hallelujah people don't understand this
[1:41:31] but I'm going to tell you this is this
[1:41:32] is the gospel truth that's why God
[1:41:35] allows churches to go through
[1:41:39] troubles I'll give you a quote brother B
[1:41:42] said I'm paraphrasing a little bit but
[1:41:43] in the church book he said the church
[1:41:45] that ain't suffering ain't got
[1:41:48] it it ain't a God listen friends why
[1:41:52] amen why would he say things like like
[1:41:53] that why would God allow things amen
[1:41:55] don't you know even the atheists that's
[1:41:57] their biggest argument if God is God and
[1:42:00] he's such a good god which you claim to
[1:42:02] why does he allow all these things to
[1:42:04] happen but I going to tell you something
[1:42:06] there's things that that they put they
[1:42:08] blame God for that never God wasn't the
[1:42:10] author of it in this in the beginning
[1:42:12] but God does allow things to happen and
[1:42:15] he allow troubles to come into the
[1:42:17] church brother Brown said he puts bits
[1:42:19] in trouble's mouth harnesses it
[1:42:24] uses it see cuz God wants a church
[1:42:27] that's why listen I want to just say
[1:42:29] this tonight that's why God allows you
[1:42:31] to have them every now and then you
[1:42:33] going to have a slow
[1:42:35] service and every now and then you going
[1:42:37] to have them Wednesday nights that are
[1:42:38] thin and every now and then you're going
[1:42:40] to have hey you preachers you understand
[1:42:42] what I'm talking about every now and
[1:42:43] then you're going to have them Services
[1:42:44] you walk out there and you think man
[1:42:46] amen I I wish that song leader has sung
[1:42:48] two more
[1:42:50] songs it's so cold and tight in here but
[1:42:53] you know what God wants preachers
[1:42:54] that'll preach whether they there's a
[1:42:56] good feeling in the building or not God
[1:42:59] wants some men that's got enough
[1:43:00] backbone that even when it's being
[1:43:02] resented and resisted they're going to
[1:43:04] say it anyhow so God will allow the
[1:43:09] opposition because God wants some
[1:43:12] Sons God will allow them slow Services
[1:43:16] because God wants a church that ain't
[1:43:18] just going to praise him when the
[1:43:20] Revival's hot and not they're not just
[1:43:22] going to stand and say amen I know God
[1:43:25] is God when they feel it but they're
[1:43:27] going to declare whether I feel God or I
[1:43:30] don't feel God he's still
[1:43:35] God and this message is right whether
[1:43:38] there's a hundred people amen and or
[1:43:45] nobody Hallelujah wherefore now that you
[1:43:50] understand all this lift up your hand
[1:43:53] that hang down and strengthen them
[1:43:56] feeble
[1:43:57] knees Hallelujah in other words just get
[1:44:00] up and Shake That discouragement off and
[1:44:03] let's move forward in the battle tonight
[1:44:06] we got a race to run we got an enemy to
[1:44:11] defeat there's a resurrection and a
[1:44:14] Rapture to be
