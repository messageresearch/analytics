just got quite a reputation of being an easy place to preach and and I'll tell you what that was about the way it was when we come out Wednesday night just to uh sometimes you know I heard some say it one time you don't even have to be called to preach to preach in an atmosphere like that it was an atmosphere created by a body of Believers amen and I believe that God is that kind of a God I believe if you'll make room for God God will do things that you never uh thought or even imagined could happen he he's a kind of God that can fix families and take broken homes and put them back together and he can change our minds you can come in one way and leave out a whole different way brother Mark that's why I preach I like to see God do that I like to see him change situations and he can take a person that ain't have no food on the table and he can put food on the table and he can make your cup run over amen that's the kind of God that he is you can come in sick and you can leave well and you can come in you can come in sad and you can leave happy and that's the kind of God that we serve amen do you love him this morning won't somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise and I just say it's good to serve God Amen I sure love the Lord I love his word and I love the Believers and amen just a good see well hey there's our old friend sister chrisa there come snuck in on us amen I seen mimal walking up the aisle must something must be going on well good to see you may God bless you this morning and and just uh want to invite each one of you to the scripture and we're going to read out of the book of Isaiah and the 53rd chapter and we'll just read in the first verse and read one verse of scripture and take just just a a moment in this and how many enjoyed that service Wednesday night amen just the Lord doing things in our our midst I just I just love the Lord amen Isaiah 53 in the first chapter and just give you a moment to get there and when you get there just say Amen let everybody get caught up and Isaiah 53 And1 and the Bible says who hath believed received our report how many say Amen to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed whom hath re believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and we just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word and you can be seated this morning I want to speak on a subject of Believing by Revelation Believing by Revelation I know this is uh how set up half night last night I had trouble uh sleeping and resting and got to looking at the you know the the reports going on around the world and the war that's going on in Israel and all just seems like other nations getting involved and and saying well for now it's this but it ain't no telling what it'll be like tomorrow whenever you get up and I thought you know just the the confusion that there is among the people brother Mark but all that tells us as a body of Believers is every day we're one day closer amen I believe one of these mornings it'll be the last morning that we'll have to uh face this life and the labor and all the effort that we that we put in it'll all be it'll all be left behind and there'll be a great reward that follows it amen how many believe that this morning I still believe it I believe that one day that uh that we're living in the age of the Rapture I believe that this is the time that the church would depart and and I believe that we were called for that purpose to be a part of it and I don't know about you but I don't plan on missing it I believe that God called me and he opened it to me and open it to my heart and how many believes that say amen amen we we're waiting on that day amen so we we come to the house of God and we we look for the Lord and look for the hand of God and everything that we do and and you know I thought it's just something odd when you get to reading about all the things going on in this world and brother Mark the world is looking for leadership they're looking to be led and uh political leaders are looking to bring in new leaders and maybe this one will come and they'll fix everything and and once they get in office and that'll fix all the problems in the country and that'll solve the economies and that'll solve the interest rates and that'll change the gas prices and that'll make life easier at home and and I thought you know the the world ain't the only thing that needs good leaders but the church needs good leaders too and they need good pastors and good ministers and evangelists and God called men that'll lead by example and and you know that ain't all of it but families need good leaders too they need good good Fathers and good Mothers that'll uh that'll be Christian men and women that'll serve the Lord and be be able to lead their homes and you know when I thought about that leadership I found out that the only way to have a good leadership is to have the leadership of God and brother Jared I believe this I believe that a father and a mother that is Led of God will lead a successful home I believe a pastor that is Led of God or a church that is Led of God will have a successful church and I believe if you ever had a nation that had had a president that was led of God that you would have a successful Nation the key is is that we must have the leadership of God how many believe that that's what Jesus said he said follow me I could preach a whole message this morning on them words just follow me he said see God he he came as our leader he said get rid of everything you got and follow me that's the only way butram said it's the only way to have eternal life that was a decision that God made and he'll never change it he said we must follow him you say well brother Matt what is the leadership of God today he said the leadership of God is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost so this is what God is calling us to do today and I know we look through the scripture and we look for example and we look for leading and we look for Direction but the prophet of God said here's why so many missed the direction of God is because the leadership of God is to follow the Vindicated word of God so you know what that tells me brother Jared that when God sends a word that word is going to lead his children that God will vindicate that word and the reason he vindicates it is to counter any doubt or criticism that Satan is going to bring against it so God would send a word and if God's going to send a word to lead you brother the co you don't have to wander around and wonder if it was the word of God because God vindicates it in a way that you know it was God then it becomes to the believer something that is unquestionable it becomes a foundation of their faith it becomes something that they can build on and establish their their life on and they they don't they don't have to W wander around and question and and try to figure out which way to go but I believe this hour that we have the leadership of almighty God I believe in this hour that we have a word that God has sent to us that was Vindicated by God brother Marsh so therefore all we have to do is just believe it we saw the Vindication of it we believe it and we follow the word of God and I believe what the Bible says the Bible says that God has a message in every age how many believes that say Amen it's always been that way and what God does is he anoints men as prophets and pastors and teachers and evangelists according to Apostle Paul and and he brings the word of God to the people and let me tell you what God does he don't just speak a word and leave it there for a hundred years but I believe that God brings a word that is relevant to today it ain't just some it's not an old message it ain't a message for some other day but in every day that there ever has been a day God has has a me had has a message for the day that we're living in I believe that God has a message today I believe he has something to say to his people I believe he has a purpose for you I believe he has a goal for the church I believe that God has a direction for the Church of the Living God I believe that God has a leading for the church today so we don't have to wander we don't we don't have to uh uh to be wishy-washy but I believe we got something that we can stand on today to be able to see us through in the hour that we live in it's God's word today and brother B said but God's word today if it's going to come and God's going to bring a word for every age well the word that he would bring to this age he said it would be brought to us in Revelation from the hand of God by Vindication so that means whatever it is that you have need of this morning brother Mark that it'll be brought to you by Revelation how many believes that so that means if you need healing healing is brought by Revelation if you need salvation it'll only come to you by Revelation if you need if you want to go in the Rapture the it it'll only come to you by Revelation see it's brought by Revelation see this word revelation brother brother uh Jared it comes from a Greek word which is apocalypsis and what that word means it means to the removal of a veil or the uncovering of something that once was covered so if God is going to come by Revelation in this hour that means he's going to take something that was veiled and he would unveil it or maybe something and let me tell you something about Revelation it could be something that you've looked at your entire life and then one day the the the page is turned or the veil is removed and now you look at the same thing and brother Cody it looks different it it has a different meaning it has a it has a connection that it's never had see that's a revelation so so if it can be uncovered that means there was a time it was covered if it could be unveiled there was a time it was veiled that's why Jesus would say this he said I thank thee father for you have hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but you have Reve fild them unto babes that would receive I believe that's what God does I believe that Through the Ages and Through the Bible there's been so many things brother Mark that were hidden and there's so many things that were buried up and you know what God does is at the right time at the time at the time when it's needed I I think God is just a super god that he's the kind of God that he can lay a seed but the mark for thousands of years and 2,000 years or or 3,000 years that God could lay a seed and allow it to remain dormant but at the time the very time that it's needed that God can take that seed and he can he can put it in the ground and he can bring it to pass and he can bring it to life what is it it's the unveiling becoming veiled it's the UN or the covered becoming uncovered and I believe that God will reveal everything that we have need of I I don't believe there's one Revelation that God don't want you to have if if it's time of the Rapture God will give you a revelation of it if it's time for you a body change God will give you a revelation of it he won't leave you wandering in the wilderness but he will reveal it to you you that you could have everything that you have need of in this hour I believe that's what kind of God that we serve but said the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized he said Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and I'm not talking about the Book of Revelation but I'm talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church I'm trying to I'm trying to establish something here this morning but Revelation is important to you Revelation matters to you it is tremendously important to the church you realize you say well why is it so important it's because Revelation is what the church is built on you remember whenever whenever Jesus spoke to Peter and he came and he said Peter who does men say that I am he said some says you're Elijah some says you're one of the prophets some you know a great man of God he said but Peter who do you say that I am he said I say you're the Christ you're the son of the Living God Jesus said Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father in Heaven hath revealed this unto you he said and and and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I thought isn't it something he said that see Peter had a revelation that the rest of the world didn't have and Jesus said but Upon This Rock I'll build my church I know what the world has done is they took that and they put a question mark by it that's what they do that's what the devil always does with the word of God when God would speak something he'll put a question mark but I thank God that we have a prophet in this age that can come and take the question mark off of the Bible You' be able to see it and have the answer we're not a people that is wondering and question brother Mar but we're a people with the answer today he said see what the the the church world is asking upon what rock is the church built on but you know many would say well it was built on Peter and they established a church on Peter and how that he started the Roman Catholic church and how all this came from him him being the first piece or priest but but you realize that it couldn't have been built on Peter I love how brother Ram said it he said because he said it couldn't been built on the man because later the backslid see God would never build his church on a man cuz the man's always going to fail the man's always going to fall he'll make mistakes he'll so so God couldn't he couldn't rely upon a man to build his church on well then the other group they took it and said well it was the confession that he made because it was the confession that Christ was the son of God but AB even took that he said you know he said that wasn't even it because anybody can confess Jesus was the son of God they could have heard Peter say it and they could go out and say well Peter said he was the son of God so by that confession I say he's the son of God therefore that's what the church is built on he said but no that wasn't it he said but what it was it was Peter's confession of the revelation of Jes of who Jesus Christ was that's the church so see it wasn't just a confession but it was a confession of a revelation are you with me you know you know the church world says well it's just based on her confession if you'll just repeat after me if you'll just say Jesus Jesus Jesus well then you're going to be saved after all Romans the chapter Paul said if Thou shalt confess the Lord Jesus then Thou shalt be saved but friends I've got news for you this morning you can say Jesus all you want to and it'll never save you you could say Jesus you could you could get up every morning and you could spend 24 hours a day and you could speak the name of Jesus although I do believe that if you speak out of sincerity the name of Jesus it'll bring him near but it but never has just saying the name of Jesus or confessing that name out of your mouth CA salvation to come but listen what Paul said he said you should he said but if you'll confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and you'd believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead then thou shall be saved for with the heart a man believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation in the Amplified Bible can I read out of this he says but what does it say the word which was God's message God's message is near you and on your lips and in your heart that is the word the message of God the message of Faith which we preach and if you a a knowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart you believe or you trust or you rely on that truth that God has raised him from the dead then you'll be saved for with a heart a person believes and and and is Justified he's declared righteous and with the mouth he confesses and he declares openly and he speaks freely of his faith and confirms his own salvation I thought isn't it isn't that something good but but the but but when you read this word confess brother Mah it's more than just saying a word this is what the church world has done they've took that word and said you just confess Jesus and you're going to be saved but but there there even there's a deeper meaning see this word confess it's not the same word confess that you read throughout the scripture there's many other times that in our English Bible we read confess but it has a little bit different meaning but this word confess it has even a deeper meaning it comes from the Greek word homio and when you read this word homio it means to agree on something but the but the the the main meaning is to speak the same thing as so listen what Paul said if Thou shalt confess the Lord Jesus in other words if Thou shalt speak the same thing as you hearing me so here Jesus would bring a message and Jesus would speak a word and Jesus would bring something to the believer and Paul said if Thou shalt confess the Lord Jesus it don't just mean to speak it it don't just mean to agree it but that you would speak the same thing so your confession is speaking the very thing that Jesus were that he was and all that he was and all that he would he would speak and you you realize that this is scripture when you go through the Bible you'll find this to be the case that the Bible tells us there is coming a time in the end time that the bride's message would be perfectly lined up with the spirit of God how many knows that to be true Revelations 22:17 it says and the spirit and the bride say come see so what it shows you is the bride's message and the spirit would be the exact same thing so it tells us that the calling out in this last AG is not the message of a man it's not just one man's message it's not and it's not just the spirit just speaking out in the wilderness somewhere but it's the spirit of God through the voice of the Bride saying come oh listen friends it's the very message of God through the voice of the Bride of Jesus Christ but said see when the prophet appears in this last AG this is the church age book he said what he says would be from God and the bride will say the same thing and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same and what they will say will have already been said in his word and they are saying it now come out from among her now and be you separate see the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we don't know but one thing we do know is it won't be long because this is the last Age Now isn't that something that the message of the Bride is the same message that the prophet spoke the message of the Bride is the same message of the spirit brother Mar it agrees with what Jesus said so our confession is not just something that we're saying out of our mouth our confession is not just something we're speaking to or were quoting something they were memorizing some scripture but it's speaking the same thing that Jesus spoke so the very meaning that he had in it the bride is confessing it so when we preach it's the confession of a revelation that Jesus had it's no wonder the prophet said that the very words that's laying in the Bible are the thoughts of God In seed form and if it was ever received in the believer and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible it would bring it to pass because it's a confession of a revelation oh friends it ain't just saying something but it's getting a revelation see you think a man hears the word think about this when a man Hears A word of God and by Revelation he accepts that word to be true and by his mouth he confesses the that he confesses his own salvation has come from the word that was revealed to him because his Revelation was the same Revelation that Jesus had he confessed his Revelation to be true then his confession confirms his Revelation isn't that wonderful his confession not only does it conf confirm the Revelation but it confirms that man's salvation because he's confessing a revelation that Jesus had well let me tell you this friends I I believe this this morning that as you grow in Revelation then your confession becomes greater as you grow in Revelation then all the sudden the confession I know there's a lot of people going out quoting a lot of scripture there's a that's where most of the most of the uh uh the the church world gets in trouble by by convincing people that if you'll just quote some scripture then everything's going to be okay and and and God will come on the scen and and and you're going to receive healing it's what CA people not to believe in Divine Healing is that they'll quote the scripture and they'll never receive healing or they'll or nothing ever happens like like they thought it would happen but you realize it's more than confession see so so when you get a greater Revelation brother Mark your confession becomes greater when your Revelation gets greater then your confession all of a sudden it ain't a powerless confession any longer but because of the Revelation that you have then that confession has power and because you're Revelation then the confession has an Authority behind it and then we're able to overcome by our confession because we have a revelation to back it up see it ain't just a bunch of people saying a bunch of ramblings or or babblings or repeating a bunch of prayers or or something like that but I thank God that we've been sent a revelation in this hour and by revelation we would have a place to stand and with authority we could confess over our sickness and confess over our failure and confess to the devil that would hinder you and the devil would have to flee because we're confessing the revelation of Jesus Christ oh let me tell you friends many confess but they never see the fruit of their confession how many say Amen to that many confess but they never see fruit of their confession why is it it's because they don't have the right Revelation see the fruit of your confession will only come by Revelation you may have confession but it'll never bear fruit without a revelation behind it see if a person will get the right Revelation and then you'll confess it then your confession will release the power that lies with within that Revelation isn't that good it isn't the the power isn't in the confession as much as it's in the Revelation and by confessing that Revelation it'll bring power to your life let me ask you this what good would it do to confess something that was powerless what good would it do if you you can get all kinds of Revelations man man can give you all kinds of Revelations but but if it has no power you can go out confess it it'll never do anything but friends I've got news for you it's my purpose that every believer would have a conf or have a revelation that their confession would have power by behind it that's my that's my purpose is that that we wouldn't just be some some getter by Christians that barely got by one day to the next and can barely can barely get out of bed to be a Christian today but I believe that the Believers ought to have enough Revelation that when they get out they can look the devil in the eye and they could confess the word of God and put the devil in his place it might be a great confession but see if you have the wrong Revelation the confession don't do no good it's a powerless Revelation so when we have what we need is we need a revelation of something that has power behind it so if our confession is confessing in Revelation let's have a revelation of something that'll have a little bit of power some something that that will charge us something that will move situations something that'll drive the devil out of the building we need a revelation of something with power that's why brother B said he said but there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God so friends I challenge you this morning that if you're going to get a revelation get a revelation of God's word if you're going to have a revelation don't take the revelation of some Seminary or the revelation of some denomination somewhere but take a revelation that come right out of the word of God out of the mouth of a prophet of God and let that Revelation strike your heart that your confession would have power in it let me tell you when you start speaking then but the mark things begin to change but said that's what we need that's the same thing with Divine Healing he said people try to get all worked up to try to make it happen and nothing ever happens think about it they'll go confessing and saying nothing ever happens he said they but they're going Plum over the top of it and they leave it right behind them he said but what you do is you go out there and get excited trying to reach for something when it's right there by you all along just simple say thank you Father you promised it to me and now I receive it a't that a simple word it ain't no big work up he said it's just simple say thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it how many can say that this morning thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it see how easy that is that's a confession thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it he said but notice Watch What Happens you see whenever you said that some of you when you said it think maybe you have a situation or something going on in your in your family or something going on in your life that you thought of whenever you said that thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it but notice what the devil does is because that's been going on so long he'll come by and say well you're just lying about that and you're you know you don't even believe that and here you're confessing something you don't believe and and you don't have a revelation of that so so it ain't never going to happen any but you know what you do you say thank you Father you promised it I now receive it see there ain't no sense in getting all worked up about it it's just speak something by confession but says here's what'll happen see the devil makes you think you're lying but you realize the one that makes you think you're lying he's the father of Lies it ain't you that's lying it ain't God that's lying it's the devil that's lying so it's like that little Chloe when she gave her testimony she's thanking God for her healing went back to the doctor and it was worse than it was whenever she got prayed for but you know what she done she kept confessing or healing and went back to the doctor and finally on the next visit he said there ain't nothing there anyhow I thank God that somebody would have enough confession to confess something when the symptom gets worse you say thank you Father you promised it I now believe it the devil says you're lying it's worse than it was before thank you Father you promised it I now believe it let me tell you what'll happen brother B said you you may not even believe it he said but you just keep saying it until you do believe it Hallelujah he said you keep saying it until you do believe it you keep saying it over I thank you Lord for my healing I thank you Lord for my salvation I don't care what you're going through this morning I thank you Lord for deliverance I thank you Lord for salvation of my son Lord I Thank you for the Salvation of my daughter I thank you H for sending the Holy Ghost to where she is and minister to her heart Lord I Thank you for picking her up when she's down I thank you for bringing her to church I thank you for sitting her beside me I thank you for bringing her to an altar the devil tell you your ly you keep confessing it he said you keep saying it until you do believe it he said why because the Bible said he's the high priest of our confession I believe that he's the high priest of our confession he says that that's Hebrews the third chapter he can't do one thing for you he can't make an intercession until first you you confess that it's done isn't that scriptural he's the high priest of our confession and then he can only act when we confess see so brother Wesley you're going to get a revelation that God God's word is true and then confess that Revelation see the step that people Miss it's all confession but get a revelation confess that Revelation and by confession you'll bring it to past my isn't it something see Revelation brings an authority to your confession you remember when Jesus when Jesus went down that day and he spoke to the Fig Tree and whenever he came back the Fig Tree was withered and the disciples begin to ask him this question brother Travis they said well how what kind of authority this was you know when you came by and you just spoke a word to this fig tree now we come back and it's all dried up how did this happen and notice how Jesus answered them he said he said have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say un this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt on his heart but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatever he says therefore I say unto you that what things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them see they were asking by what Authority how how did this happen and he gives them an answer he says whatever whosoever shall say to this mountain believe when you pray and you shall receive them even the Pharisees brother Mark would gather around and begin to ask him by what Authority does he do these things by what Authority does he have this ability you know as the testimonies begin to grow this was the great question by what Authority but you realize that Jesus but Jesus gave you as a Believer a scriptural authority over the devil how many believe that can you say that with me that Jesus gave me as a Believer scriptural authority over the devil you believe that Jesus gave me scriptural authority over the devil that's the question the devil will ask you when you go to confessing something by what Authority do you confess this by what Authority you're not a preacher after all by what Authority you you ain't you you ain't a deacon in the church after all by what Authority do you have this but friends you say because God has gave me scriptural authority over the devil I believe that he gave you a scriptural authority Jesus said when you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart and be you believe what you ask for it shall come to pass whatever thing you desire When you pray believe that you receive them take the devil back to there when he says you ain't got a right to say that brother Tom you say well but but the Bible says but but whatever I say to this mountain it'll be removed and the things I desire in my heart it'll be given unto me because I believe I'm going to receive it see we have a scriptural authority over I know I know what I know what happens whenever God gives you an authority I know people abuse it I know you know people take it they use it the wrong way but God didn't give you an authority to abuse your brother he didn't give you an authority to abuse your wife we have a scriptural Authority the Bible says that men were made in the image of God and have dominion over the earth I believe that we have authority but but but it wasn't to be misused it wasn't to be used wrongly and so men take a hold of that and they'll take a hold of some scriptures and I'm going to get myself in trouble but they'll they'll get a little bold and they'll say well I I'll tell you what I'll put my wife on her place and I I'll have authority over her cuz they can't get nobody else to do it they want they'll try to abuse your authority over their wife or you'll take pastors and they'll abuse their authority over the people of God or over the Church of God but let me tell you friends but that way that ain't what the the authority was given for it was to have authority over the devil that's what it was for he said I'll give you a scriptural authority over the devil let me tell you I know y'all some of y'all looking at me like I'm funny but I me tell you where Apostle Paul said there he Apostle Paul was a man of great Authority he was an apostle of God he was the leader of the Gentiles he was a prophet of God and that man of great power the Devils feared him he was an apostle he was a Setter in order and Paul said he said I have an abundant he said though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting and required of your duty to do in other words I've got an abundant boldness in Christ I can tell you what to do he said but for the Love's sake I prefer to appeal to you you is't that good I could boss you around he said but for Love's sake I prefer to appeal to you the love of God as an ambassador of Jesus Christ an old man now a prisoner in his sake he notice what he was telling us what an example that we have in Apostle Paul see we're not when God gives you a scriptural Authority it ain't to be abused and used on one another but when he gives you a scriptural Authority it's the boldness not to rule each other but to rule over the devil you see how people get that so mixed up I'm going to get myself in trouble but that's what God gave us an authority for to rule over the devil and let me tell you what brother Mark the devil recognizes the authority of Jesus how many believes that he recognizes it I can go go through the scripture and I got a 15 different directions I could go this morning but whenever you go in the scripture the Bible says in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and the and he cried out with a loud voice and he said let us alone what are we to do with thee oh Jesus of Nazareth Art Thou come to destroy us I know who you are the Holy One Of God even the devil recognized who he was and he had an authority over him and the Bible says Jesus rebuked him said hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown out of the midst of him he came out and heard him not and you remember what they said brother Wesley they said they were all amazed and they spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they came out of the man see Jesus had a authority over the devil and brother Mark let me tell you something he had authority over him then and he has authority over him now it ain't something for 2,000 years ago it wasn't something that was just written in the Bible it ain't a history lesson but the same Jesus that user his authority over the devil before he went to the cross of Calvary is the same Jesus that stands here this morning that has the same authority over the same devil he can still put him in his place let me tell you what happened when Peter caught that Revelation he went down to the gate beautiful him and John and there a man set that was lame and he said and he was begging arms and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk see the name of Jesus it still has authority over the devil it had it out of the mouth of Peter it had it out of the mouth of John it had it out of the mouth of Paul it had it out of the mouth of William Brown and it still has it out of the mouth of every believer sitting here this morning the name of Jesus has a authority over the devil I believe that this morning he has authority over the devil you realize that Jesus has always had authority over him you realize that when Jesus came to do his work upon the Earth brother Wesley that that he didn't that that that whenever he went to the cross of Calvary before he even went to the Cross he already had Authority he could have called Angels an army of angels to come and to save him off a calvary's cross could have wiped all of Jerusalem him off the map at the at just one word that he spoke he already had authority over the devil can you think about that he went to the cross of Calvary willingly he already had Authority he went to and gave his own life willingly brother marah he already had Authority you say what was he doing here was a man the Bible says he made himself of no reputation and he took upon himself as the form of a servant and he was made in the likeness of men and being found fashioned as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross thought isn't that wonderful that when God made you Brother David he made you as a as a man in the image of God and then because man when he came and he was made in the image of God that man fell God and he broke his Covenant with God and now we see the Bible says but here God would come again in the form of a servant and God would come in the form of a man where he made man in the form of God now the Bible says but now God fashioned himself in the form of a man that he could come and save man and give them back the very thing that they had lost in the garden he says so God he made himself and became obedient unto death the death of the Cross wherefore God has exalted him and given him a name which is above every name somebody say Amen a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow it don't matter if it was things in heaven it didn't matter if it was things on earth the Bible said or even things under the Earth at the name of Jesus every knee would bow friends let me tell you a secret this morning let me just get to it that God he didn't go to Calvary so he could have authority over the devil he went to Calvary that you would have authority over the devil and he passed it down from generation to generation that we would be able to stand here this morning and still have authority over the same devil that same devil that took him up to calvary's cross the same devil that anointed the Pharisees not to believe his word that same devil you have authority over in this morning by the name of Jesus Christ that's why the prophet God would stand in a meeting and he would say Satan through your education I'm running out of time he would say Satan through your education and through the systems of the world you've blinded the people for years but you're exposed amen somebody say that this morning you're exposed on somebody just go ahead and say it you're exposed you're exposed devil he said see you blinded the people for years but you're exposed that makes me feel good I love exposing the devil I think we ought just get it all out there let you know what's been trouble in your home it wasn't it ain't because you're trying to go to church and your wife's upset about it it's the Devil he's exposed see it's the devil that don't want you going to church it's the devil that want your family broke up it's the devil that wants you to fall it's the devil that wants you to give up on God it's the devil that want you to be back it's the devil that don't want you to be a believer it ain't got nothing to do with your husband or your wife it's the devil I think it's time to expose him this morning God didn't make you sick it's the devil that done it God didn't make your Oh Glory God didn't make your husband do that it's the devil that does it I know we put a lot of blame on him but it's the truth he deserves all the blame you can put on him he's a stinking lying devil amen I feel good this morning he's a liar it's the devil that done it so see he he he said to you've blinded people through education the systems of the world but you're exposed we do not accept you can you say that we don't accept you speak that to the devil we don't accept you we claim that you was defeated at Calvary how many say that with me you were defeated at Calvary we me well and go tell him this morning driving Plum out of the building I claim you were defeated at Calvary I don't accept you you were defeated at Calvary when Christ died and he rose again you were stripped of every Power that you had you have no power left you're just to blood and we're calling on the blood in the name of Jesus Christ by the authority of the angel of God who has charged us in this meeting this morning you come out of the people and all you spirits diseases and leave the people alone in the name of Jesus Christ I thank God this morning that we have a scriptural authority over the devil I said he's been exposed won somebody expose him this morning say Satan you ain't nothing but a blood you lost your power on calvary's Cross when Jesus died and he rose again and he raised in power and gave me power and victory over you this morning you ain't nothing but a blood and I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the spirit of depression in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the spirit of pornography in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke that spirit that Lon Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ you have no authority over the Sons and Daughters of God I expose you in the name of Jesus Christ that's the confession of the Bride of Jesus Christ to say the same thing that Jesus spoke how many believes that brother M had that Authority tens of thousands thousands of times of people that were healed in his meeting many many would take and they would put it on that man and say well it's because of that man but you realize that he never kept that on himself but I love what a prophet said isn't it something that most of us we look and and it's a good thing every one of us well I wish I'd have been in brother B's meetings I wish I could have seen that I W and I do too I wish it wouldn't have been something brother Mark to see that gift of discernment operating in that way and and the in the testimonies of the people that witnessed it as the years go on those those testimonies or or those people would would die off with the old age and and before long there won't even be a person that was ever in his meeting that was they still alive is if the Rapture don't go before that time brother Wesley it's a it's a longing in my heart but let me tell you a secret that brother man he never he never kept that Authority that God gave him listen to this say see the church is going to be without the man but it'll never be without God the church whenever Paul was Pro was was was leading the Ephesian Church there came a time when the Ephesian church had to go on and Paul wasn't there no more they could they couldn't call him up and ask for ad advice I I don't know how they' have called him but they couldn't have sent a runner down there and asked for his advice he had never been able to offer it brother Mark because the man the body flesh of that man would fade away but listen to what brother maram said see he didn't keep that Authority I believe he had a great Authority how many believes that think of that Authority that he had over the devil when you listen to the those messages and how powerful that it is that Spirit you you'd hear an audience of people and you say well I wasn't there but let me tell you friends I rely on the jury of my peers we convict a man to death with 12 people and in that's our country we can we can convict a man to death with 12 people agreeing on one thing and saying yeah they did it and we rely on the jury of our peers to say that's what happened but let me tell you friends we had thousands of jury of a jury of our peers that sat in brother Bam's meetings that said that that ain't nothing but the truth is that what I say is that trueth that ain't nothing but the truth so don't you think you're going to come to me some 50 years later and go againsts what the jury said that mean thousands of jury members that sat in his meetings and said that ain't nothing but the angel of the Lord and everything he said it came to pass just like he said it was so the ver the verdict is already out I'm not here to debate the verdict the verdict is out I'm not here to call another jury you can't with you can't call the case again it's already been done but but but the verdicts already been and the jury of our peers confirmed it to be so the prophecy come to pass what see there was a great power in his ministry but I love this to see if there was a power in his ministry and Authority that he had listen what brother said in the message identification he said if there be a pastor here this morning that believes in praying for the sick I don't want to leave you people thinking that I'm standing up here as an evangelist and with a gift of discernment in this prophetic hour that we're living in I don't want to make you think that your pastor ain't just as much as anybody else he's a servant of Christ with the same Authority that I have or anybody else has because our Authority is in Jesus Christ you know what that Oh Glory that makes me feel good this morning you know why cuz here a prophet of God that had the authority of Jesus Christ that ain't the only one that has it but he your pastor has it just like anybody else has it the Evangelist has it the minister has it let me tell you that ought to make every Pastor stand in this position with confidence this morning to know that he has authority over the devil it ought to make every evangelist stand his position this morning and and have the authority over the devil every gospel preacher to have authority over the devil but brother Mark that ain't the end of it it ought to make every believer every mother every father every son and every daughter of God anybody else that is a believer that that has a revelation of God's word but a mark they've been given authority over the devil this morning every holy ghost filled mother has authority over the devil every holy ghost filled father has authority over the devil every holy ghost filled young man or young woman has authority over the devil so when he torment you and he tempts you and he comes by in the Midnight Hour but Mark I say stand up and look the devil in the eye and say at the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you devil give him his leave we have a scriptural Authority I believe that I'm going to hurry the bride I believe what the bride should be she should be what the word says about her how many believe that I believe that's what the purpose of the message was it was to redeem a a bride and call her back to her position in Christ what man had lost you see the whole big picture brother the jar what man had lost here God would come just before the rapturing of the church and he would put the church back in its position isn't that wonderful that God would think enough about you look how much you mean to God that he would put you in this age an age that that was the worst age there ever was but he but he knew that brother Travis that you would be able to withstand this age and he' bring a revelation he knew you'd catch that Revelation and it would put you right back in your position that God has called you to you believe that this morning I believe that with a bride that the bride ought to be what God says about her that's what that's what God wants with you is is to be what his word says you are God don't want you to be lesser he wants you to be greater he wants you to be what the word says you are you realize this a you you you you find out that from the from from Genesis all the way to the Book of Revelation you'll find out there's only one reason for God's displeasure and that was for people leaving the word and then there ain't but one remedy for it to regain God's favor that's to get back to the word see sometimes we get off and sometimes we we we go down we go down Wild Goose chases and sometimes people get a little bit lost and they'll leave the word of God but here God would come in this last day brother Wesley for the purpose of bringing a people back to the word of God to regain the favor of God B said it like this he says see the church is built upon divine revelation not just any Revelation but the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour but what he is now the Bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature you realize the Church world the church world is looking for a Christ that's 2,000 years old they're looking for a Jesus that was 2,000 years ago and that's why they fail to see him today can I finish up with this but listen what Jesus said in John the the 12th chapter he said except a corn of wheat would go into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die if it dies it bringeth forth much fruit you notice this is think about what he what he's saying it would go into the ground and die it would bring forth much fruit you realize this when Jesus makes this statement he had just came to Bethany to go have supper with Lazarus that just a few days ago was laying in a tomb and he raised him from the dead so then Jesus comes in just a few days before the Passover feast and he comes into bethan he sits down and he's going to have dinner with Lazarus and the Bible says many of the Jews came to the dinner because not they wanted to see Jesus but but they also wanted to see Lazarus because they heard the testimony of how that he was raised from the dead so it caed this great the this great uh movement that was going on around the the resurrection of Lazarus and so here the here they're coming oh just something to me that they're coming and they're gathering around a testimony of Resurrection look what's drawing the people together it's the it's the talk of Resurrection it's the talk talk of a of a Dead coming back to life and so they come and and and brother Mark they came so many to see this testimony the Bible said that even the Pharisees got together and they and they tried to think of ways that they could kill Lazarus what a foolish thought I wonder if how many of them are sitting in there when they sit around the council said I'll tell you what this Lazarus is causing too much problem because you know after all he raised from the dead and yeah I know the corner and the Corner's report was accurate he was certainly dead he had no pul he laid in there four days I mean it it was a long time before he came out he wasn't breathing it's a true testimony and one of them said well I got an idea why don't we just put him to death I wonder if one of them sitting behind said I don't know if that'll work or not you know just a few days ago he was already there but the Bible says but they thought together to put Lazarus to death to end the testimony I I thought my but it wouldn't matter anyway brother Wesley but while they were thinking on these things the Bible says here here they would make this plot and and because of the the many of the Jews they went away and the Pharisees said here's the problem that there's so many of our Jews that are leaving the synagogues and they're going to follow after this Jesus because of the mighty works that he's done and the next day much people came to the feast the Bible said when they heard Jesus was coming they took fig leaves or or or branches of palm trees and they and they went out and they met him and they cried Hosanna blessed be the king of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord they gave him a great welcome because he was coming into town the Pharisees looked out at him and they said it looks like the whole world is going to follow him this was their concern it looked like everybody is going to follow him and I I love this because then the Bible says but then there was some Greeks that came to Phillip and the Greeks said requesting him he said sir we would see Jesus is't that something that's what many are looking for today Sirah we we would see Jesus and notice but then whenever they came and asked him this and then Phillip and and Andrew they went to Jesus and told him there's some there's some Greeks out there and they want to they want to see you and the Bible says and then Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified in other words this is a time that this flesh that that that this ministry of this flesh will no longer be it's coming the time of it fading away this is the purpose of my coming but here he is prophesying that he's going to go into a grave and he'll come back and a glorified body and one day he'll Ascend so so he's actually prophesying of his own death and burial and Resurrection he said the hour has come that the son of man would be glorified notice and when he says this he says but verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat would fall into the ground it and die it abideth alone but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit so not only is he prophesying but he's accepting it he said why why would I say would say well let this uh uh apart from me but but this was for the purpose that I came into this world so he's prophesying of his death and burrow and Resurrection in other words he's testifying that this would be his purpose he said for this cause I came into this hour and then he speaks and he says father glorify thy name and the Bible said and there came a voice out of heaven and said I have both glorified it and I will glorify it again so in other words you have seen it you've seen a mighty work of the Messiah you've seen the signs of the Messiah but that ain't all but you're going to see it again he said I have glorified it but you're going to you're going to glorify it again now watch watch this very closely did you catch this that when the Greek we crested to see them how many knows what a Greek was I got I got just a minute how many it's only it ain't even 12:30 but but but the Greek was the gentile people you go back in the Bible from the days of the flooding of Noah there came three races of people off the ark it was ham sham and it was the Samaritan the Jews and the Gentiles that which is which is what we're of and so we see that the Bible would tell us of these three races that the gentile people had never saw the Messiah sign you remember this sign now now notice there's a there's a powerful point I don't have time to preach it this morning but there's a powerful point but makes here he says the reason they didn't see it is because they weren't looking for it so the Gentile had never seen this Messiah sign but notice the Samaritan and the Jews the other two races they had been represented and seeing the sign of the Messiah because scripturally these two races of people had been taught that he was coming and so because it was prophesied and they were taught that they would see the Messiah and and by their prophets they follow the message of their prophets that they would that how they would recognize him then they saw that Messiah sign we we see it in two stories one of them was the woman at the well remember Jesus said I have needs to go by Samaria there was a Samaritan woman when he went to talk to her notied the sign of the Messiah is because he told her he said I I just hurry through it but but he told her he said woman go get your husband she said I have no husband he said you've spoken true because you've had five husbands and the one you're with now is not your own and she said I've heard that when the Messiah comes he would do these things he said I am he that speaks unto thee she went into town the Bible said saying come and see a man that told me all the things that I've ever done so see it was a Samaritan that seen a messiah sign now notice it again there was a man by the name of Nathaniel that was a Jewish man remember whenever Jesus called philli and Philip went out and he and he called his brothers he went down to Nathaniel and and he's called Nathaniel he said come we found the Messiah the one we've been waiting on see they were looking for him to come they've been prophesied they they beli the proph and so when Nathaniel went to meet Jesus and he was a long way off Jesus said behold an Israelite whom there is no whom there is no G in other words an Israelite that there is no deceit and Nathaniel said unto him he said when did you know me and Jesus said before Philip called you when you were sitting under the Fig Tree I saw you and Nathaniel answered him and said Rabbi you are the Son of God and the king of Israel and Jesus said because I said you were under a fig tree you believe you will see greater things than these see he saw the Messiah sign he saw things that and knew things about his life that that he didn't put there he he knew things about his life that he didn't tell him when did you know me how did you know this was going on the same thing that happened to the woman at the well how did you know my five husbands how how did you know about the back part of my life how how would you know all the things that I've ever done but because he saw what she had done she identified it as a sign of the Messiah I hope you hear me this morning we're not talking about it was just some ordinary man that was sitting by the well but it was a sign of the Messiah and because the Samaritan was looking for the Messiah she recognized the sign when she saw it because the Jew was looking for the Messiah he recognized the sign whenever he saw it see they recognized it was a messiah sign but then then the Bible says but then the Greeks came to see him see now the Gentile comes and what Jesus says when there when the Gentile comes to see him isn't it something that that's whenever he said the hour has come the son of man should be glorified this is the end of it if the Gentiles coming to seek it's the end of it see because the Gentiles started asking questions and Jesus knew that it wasn't time for that listen to me for a minute he knew that it wasn't time that that that that sign had never been performed on a gentile but just as the Jews and the Samaritans would have hundreds of years by The Mark of prophecies that was building up for them to have what they what what what they would would need in order to search for Christ whenever he came then here Jesus would prophesy that the Gentile would have the same thing thing so in other words what would we what that one day the gentile people would be looking for a messiah the thing they never done 2,000 years ago that race of people wasn't looking for a messiah 2,000 years ago but then but after Christ had went into the grave and he raised from the dead you realize that that they came to him and they looked to him because of the prophecies that they had but do you realize that when we come this age and we're looking for a messiah nobody saw that Messiah sign for 2,000 years there ain't a gentile ever saw it until the age that we live in today that's the age that's the age of the revealing listen he says see when the Messiah would come they would look for it we're not looking at the same prophecies that the Jews had I know I run out of time but we're not looking at the same prophecies they had do you realize that the gentile people I'm I feel good cuz I know where I'm going but the gentile people brother Mark we're not looking at Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive because she already did we're not looking at the prophecy he was wounded for our transgression because he already was we're not looking at the prophecy of M that out of Bethlehem that become a ruler over Israel we're not looking for the prophecy of Psalms when David said he would say my God why hast Thou forsaken me you realize friends we're not looking for him to die on a cross we're not looking for him to be born in a manger we're not looking for a Star to announce his birth our prophecies aren't the same thing it's not the same prophecy see if you're still looking to see him in that way you'll never see him you see where the church world has missed Christ because they take them same prophecies and they preach them to their people and that's all they ever that's as far as they ever go and so they look for that same Jesus that walked on Nazareth that had a crown of thorns on his head and Nails cars in his hands and they and they and they'll they'll get people up in front of their Church testifying I think I seen him the other day walking down the street I I heard a great Revival one time in another country they said Jesus was walking amongst them I said well it ain't no Revival that God said because Jesus wouldn't be walking out there it'd be a false Christ because he wouldn't come up on this Earth until it was already burned over he wouldn't even step a foot on it so listen said ain't the same prophecy brother Mark that's why they miss Jesus is because they're looking at the wrong prophecy but I thank God that there's some people like the woman at the well and there's some people like Nathaniel was that looked at the prophecies that was concerning their age see our it started in Paul's Ministry when Paul went out as a messenger of the Gentile and he be to talk about I I the same Jesus that was sent to the Jews but now he's coming to the gentile people and then Luke after Paul's Ministry then Luke begins to write about it and we find Luke 17:30 then John goes to the of patmas in Revelations 10:7 and he begins to write about it what it's prophecies concerning Christ in the age that we live in see if people don't if they if they it ain't preached to them there's no revelation of it then they fail to see Christ in their age see we're not looking for nail scarred hands we're looking for the word to be made manifest isn't that what Jesus said this is the Christ that we would see today the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God then the word was made flesh and then that seed by the market went into the ground and it came back in the form of the Holy Ghost it fell upon them in the upper room and you know what they did they done the same things that Jesus done whenever he was walking upon the Earth they did the same works then the church went through this phase brother Mark where where many would give their lives and and and the martyrs would come and and it looked like the entire church had lost its power and it had died and and spiritually the church had failed but notice when a prophet would come he would say but that wasn't the end of it listen friends pointing people back to Christ this is important that wasn't the end of it he said because Jesus said if a corn of wheat of Christ had to fall on the ground then so would the bride have to fall on the ground through the Dark Ages so don't let it make you lose confidence in God that God had forgotten his people or let him go through that but any grain that goes in the ground it must die or it can't reproduce itself and that great church that had established on the day of Pentecost by sending the Holy Ghost it had to suffer martydom to go into the dirt into the Earth in the Dark Age and bring forth again the age of Luther and in the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day so the church through the Dark Ages you can read the history of the church every historian will tell tell you pretty much the same history that it went into the Dark Ages and it seemed to die off but now in the last day the Revival came back to the church and Martin Luther he went to the Roman Catholic church and he posted something on the door the thesis on the door and said this ain't nothing but a den of Thieves it Ain it ain't nothing but a house of devils and he went out in that great movement and Revival begin to strike the the world again what was was it it was the it was the resurrection of the Church of God in other words I I could say it like this it was the resurrection of the Resurrection see Jesus he had already resurrected they had already seen him in power but now in this age we' saw a resurrection of that power of Resurrection we've seen the same thing you see now so God came in this age and he showed that same Messiah sign to turn the hearts of people back to the word of God are y'all seeing that so that's what God would have to do he would turn it was our turn as a gentile people to see the Messiah sign but he see he brought it to turn the hearts of people back to the word of God and the Bible says you know what happened many believed on him but you know what many saw the same sign and didn't believe but you realize that same thing happened in John 12 Bible says but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believe not on him they that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke Lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed whom hath believed our report and whom ha the arm of the Lord been revealed who would believe a a messiah sign you say well who would believe it would' be those that were called to believe it it would be those that were ordained to believe it it was those that were seeking after it do you realize the the the the difference between that little woman at the well and all the rest of the women that wandered around and Samaria she she was different she was ordained Jesus said I have a need to go by there he said what would made her different than everybody else he knew he's an eternal God he knows all things he knows every thought he know what You' do he know the decisions you'd make he knows the choices you'd make although he'll allow you to make mistakes he knows the mistakes you're going to make because he's an eternal God said but he had a need to go by there I thought isn't it something that in our age but Mark that we would see that Messiah sign I'm closing we you would see that Messiah sign as a gentile people brother Wesley it would it would cause a people to become Believers it would take the word of God and he would take the mysteries of God and reveal them to a people in such a way that you would be able to believe God's word again and all of a sudden the things if you if you if you had the time to go through every church but the things that the churches have taken out of the Bible and saying that's for another day and that's for a day gone by and that was for the disciples and that was for the things that they took out here that God would send them man that was so anointed of God to say that didn't that wasn't meant to be taken out of the Bible it was meant to be revealed and meant to be believed and he would take it and he would prove it by that same Messiah sign that a people would believe the revelation of God's word brother Mark they would see the Messiah sign I thought it was something you know one night one night at a Revival meeting if the music player want to come one night at a Revival meeting there was a there was a woman that came up for for prayer or or or had came to the meeting and and she had her sister that was laying on her deathbed she had cancer in her stomach and had got into such a bad place that that they had left her bedridden the doctors couldn't do nothing for her so they they let send her home to die didn't even couldn't even get out of the bed to use a bathroom or nothing there she was she was just so ate up with cancer and in this meeting here this woman had came and in the audience the audience about 1500 people gathered in this audience here brother Bram was standing in this in this place and he called calls the woman out by name here she's in the audience has this no doubt on her heart and notice whenever he calls her out he says you left home tonight you put a little white handkerchief in your pocket and you got it off a marble top dresser and it's got a little blue working in the corner of it and you got a sister and he told her a sister's name that's dying with cancer he said if you'll go take that handkerchief and you'll put it on your sister thus sayith the Lord she shall live what is it friends it wasn't no different than the same sign that Jesus showed think about it you going to take that handkerchief they had the blue markings on it what could show a man the a handkerchief laying on somebody's marble toop dresser with blue markings on the edge of it and say go take that and lay it on your sister and she'll receive her healing you know what happened brother Mark she she took it and she took that uh handkerchief and she went back to her sister's house and she laid it on her sister and you know what the report said that the that that she that the shout got sooud in there when she received her healing they went to shouting and pra the Lord so loud that the neighbors that were far off they heard the test or the the shouting that was going on and they thought they thought they thought there was some kind of thing going on there and the neighbor said well you know what I think the woman must have died there's some commotion going on at her house and you realize that brother Mark that when this happened that one of those neighbors didn't believe in God but he heard the commotion going on he didn't believe in God he he didn't believe in Jesus he certainly didn't believe in no Messiah but God began to deal with his heart so he goes down the next day and when he goes down they find they find out that the woman she wasn't dead but she was healed he went in they found her sitting there eating breakfast but you know what that man went off that man that was an unbeliever and he didn't believe in God and brother Wesley the Lord began to deal with his heart and as he dealt with his heart he put it on his heart a longing here was a man I thought isn't it something a man that was a admitted unbeliever an admitted atheist he was an admitted Infidel but God would deal with his heart and something in his heart said I would like to meet the man that stood in the pull pit in front of 1500 people and said go take the handkerchief that you took off your dresser and go put it on your sister and the Lord's going to heal her and God healed her that same man had testified he had seen the woman in her dead State he had seen her when she was laying there sick he had seen her there him and his own wife had gone down to her house and changed the sheets on her bed while she was laying there dying and that same man had witnessed the next morning when she was sitting there eating breakfast and for the months that followed he went every day that that man he knew the woman the testimony that surrounded her life and admittedly still yet I'm an unbeliever but some desire in his heart would say I'd like to meet that man if there ever was a preacher I ever would want to meet it'd be that one if there was a true one it'd be that one I thought isn't it something that God would see the desire of an unbeliever he would see he would put a desire in the heart of an unbeliever you me tell you why because unbeliever was predestinated by God you know I know a lot of people get this mixed up and they say well you know there's three kinds of Believers in every Church there's Believers and make Believers and then there's unbelievers then they'll pick themselves out as the Believers and say well that one's an unbeliever and that one's a make believer and they'll they'll just they'll just assign everybody a position but let me tell you a secret friends I've been all three of them hello somebody there was a time when I was a mate believer and there was a time when I was an unbeliever but I thank God today that he made a Believer out of me God God saw a man that was an unbeliever but he put a desire in his heart why because he was predestinated of God and all these years are G by here was a man 76 years old brother Mar an unbeliever and then one day here a couple Brothers was going on a hunting trip brother B was traing with his buddy brother Banks Woods he said you know he said I heard there's some squirrels down here down in this holler they went down there and he she he pulled up and hear that man I thought no doubt his wife had prayed many days for his salvation his friend that was sitting there under the tree with him no doubt he had prayed many days for his salvation his friend he was visiting with he was a Believer and all of a sudden they're sitting under a tree and the Very desire that was in his heart came pulling up in his driveway from another state that he lived in he came pulling up in this man's driveway and he got out and said sir you know the the brothers with him he said sir you know I I I'm looking to go squirrel hunting and then brother BR was in the car he got out of the car he said well who's this he said well this is my pastor he said you mean you got soow down you had to pack a preacher around with you he said I guess y'all know he said I'm an Infidel I'm an unbeliever he said I know you preachers y'all are all baring barking up the wrong tree I don't believe in that kind of stuff I'm 76 years old and I've never seen no God I've never seen an angel of God therefore it don't exist you see the difference he was looking for God in the wrong way he was looking for Jesus from th000 years ago he was looking for an angel to come walking amongst him brother Mark but he said I've never seen God there must not be one I don't believe in that but you realize that why he said he didn't believe it that here but BR he said he said you know he said there is one preacher I'd like to meet though and he begin to tell him the testimony of that girl that was healed he said she was my neighbor and this is what happened to her and he told the told the testimony of it and as he told it all of a sudden he was he he was brother Mark I thought you know he was something like those like those Gentiles that went to see Jesus he said I'd like to meet the man isn't that something sir we would see Jesus I'd like to meet the man that could say that he said you know he said what would you want to meet him for he said well he said I'd like to ask him a few questions you know sometimes that's just what it takes to see Jesus you realize that when the Gentiles asked they asked Phillip and Philip went to Jesus Jesus but said see isn't it something he said sometimes it just takes a servant to bring you into his presence here for 76 years this man had looked for Jesus but couldn't find him but a servant of the Lord came up and brought him into his presence isn't it something brother Wesley here he was sitting under that tree and he came he said you know I'd like to talk to him he said I want to ask him some questions I want to know how he knew that woman up there and I want to know how that he knew he had never been in this country before how do he know she was dying with cancer how did he know that she was going to be healed how do he know what her name was how did he know who her sister was how did he know she was going to get well when the handkerchief was put on her how did he know that her sister had a handkerchief laying on her dresser there's some questions I would like to ask him he said I'd like to talk to him when I see him I want to ask him these questions you know what brother Mark one of the most powerful stories I've ever heard in my life brother B down he there was an apple laid on the ground he picked that Apple up he said you mind if I have one of these apples he said sure you can have one the yellow jackets eat them all anyway he said you know sir he said can I ask you a question he said there ain't even a a sign of frost anywhere it's still warm out he said but wonder why all the leaves are falling off his tree well that man he was proud of his apple tree he planted it 40 years ago he said well he said that's because the sap that's in the tree the life left the leaf he said 'well where did it go the man saidwell it goes down in the root of the tree he said see because we have Winters up here I don't know if you ain't from around here but we have Winters up here that go - 20° below zero he said if that if this tree ever got in that kind of winter it'd kill it it never bring forth fruit again he said so the life leaves out of it the sap goes down into the root he said and then in the springtime the Sap's going to come back and it'll bring new life listen what he's doing he's testifying of the Resurrection if a corn of wheat would fall into the ground it would abideth alone but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit here a man that's an unbeliever is preaching a sermon he's testifying of the resurrection and what he's what he's doing brother Joe is he's actually testifying of the very thing that Jesus said would happen it would abide alone but now it'll bring forth fruit he said if that's what happened he says he explains it and brother B turned and looked at him he says you know I think it's something he said if you put a old wooden bucket full of water you set it on that on that fence post he said that water never goes down in the bottom he said but let me ask you he said what kind of intelligence tells that before the frost Falls you better get out of here and run down the route and hide if you don't you're going to die he said what intelligence tells that sap to do that the man says well I I don't know just nature I guess but said well I'll tell you what he said we're going to go hunting he said but when I come back you tell me what intelligence tells the sap in that tree to go out and to go back in the root and died in the spring to come back again and when you tell me that I'll tell you what intelligence told me that that woman was going to be healed that man said oh no you you're that man he said yes sir I'm brother brandham I was the one that had the meeting said my you don't you don't look like a preacher you know why cuz he was looking for Jesus in the wrong way but it was the life of Jesus Christ manifested here he was testifying brother Mark of a messiah sign and didn't even see it an Infidel an unbeliever but God would put a desire in his heart to change it brother bam LED that man to the Lord a few months later his wife said he died and when he died he was praising the Lord when he died he served the Lord from that day forward why because he saw a messiah sign I thought isn't it something that God of all the I thought man of all the things that that he had seen but the very nature of a tree declared unto him that there was a God he planted it 40 years ago if you don't stand to your feet something that he planted 40 years ago he saw that seed brother Joe for 40 years he saw it go into the ground he saw it bring forth life he saw it mature and every year he's seen it die and he seen it come back again in the spring but he never saw God he seen the death and the bual and the resurrection but he never saw God he seen the testimony but he never saw God but then one day that same God that same Messiah it wasn't the man but it was the god in the man the sign of the Messiah he stood in his midst and tonning the Very testimony of Jesus Christ I thought my a't it something here a man had searched for something for 76 years and in 15 minutes a servant of the Lord led him into his presence it don't take that long years of his life brother Tom he had searched for him the sign of the Messiah I know when the Messiah come he would do these things I heard what the scripture says but I've never saw it they're looking forth their wrong way but it took a servant to lead him into his presence brother Mark and the very thing that had been sitting in front of him all along a hidden thing become revealed I pray that that's what happens to every one of you this morning said we're not living in the days of Jesus walking on the shores of Galilee but we're living in Le oosa we're Liv living in the age of the Rapture we're living in the age of Malachi 4 and the age of Revelations 10:7 that's the age that we're living in and I pray to God that you would that would be revealed unto you the sign of the Messiah in this age that that same Jesus is doing the same works and if he done it then brother Bobby he's still doing it today to do what to give power to the believer that you would have a revelation of God's word for the hour that you live in and you'll be able to stand in the face of the devil and be able to confess your Revelation and have victory in this hour that's the desire of my heart this morning how many raise your hand say brother mat that's what I want want Lord give me enough Revelation that my confession would change show me Lord if there's something that's hidden Lord reveal it unto me isn't it something it's always about Revelation say well brother Matt I've never saw that before when neither had anybody until they saw it I never seen that in the scripture before well neither did anybody else till they saw it the first time but God laid it there and there comes a time in our life that it's revealed under each one of us we're ordained to be Believers you're ordained to be in this age you're ordained to be here this morning I don't believe that you're here by accident I don't believe it's a coincidence that God brought you here this morning but I I believe he brought us in this place to see that very sign and to have that Revelation and to have a confession that would have power over the devil you say brother Matt I pray you you'd remember me this morning that I'd have that kind of a revelation amen Lord seize our hands this morning Lord give me a a solid Revelation Lord give me something sound a foundation that I could stand upon this morning as we bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray Lord this morning God that something that would have been said Lord that God would be a help to the church God knowing that in this hour lord it's an hour of great Revelation Lord God it's not we a church that's looking to days gone by but Lord what we want to see is the Jesus of this hour God I recognize him Lord as your Prophet would speak that he's not some dead God but but the resurrection has came again the very power of the Resurrection is living in the church today Lord I pray Lord that that same power be witnessed this morning Lord I pray it'd be in the heart of every believer Lord I pray you would open their hearts and and Reveal Your word to them Lord let there be such a strength in the revelation God that they would be able to confess your word Lord they would be able to stand in the face of the devil lord whenever he would come by and those unbelieving spirits and C critical Spirits would come by their house they'd be able to stand and say but by the power of the Holy Ghost God has given me a revelation to put you in your place and you've been exposed in this hour God I pray you would secure that in every heart God you would open their eyes Lord those that are blinded Lord that their eyes would be open Lord let their heart be open to the word of God and let the revelation of the hour strike every heart God may we search the scriptures Lord Lord may we search our hearts and discern truth Lord as a body of Believers that we would take our place in the middle of this age we claim it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen oh he here my humble my humble cry and I
