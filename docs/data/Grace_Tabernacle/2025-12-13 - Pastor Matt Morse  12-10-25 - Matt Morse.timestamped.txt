[34:14] within me.
[34:16] Amen. Is that your prayer this evening?
[34:19] Amen. Amen. And brother Bram said when a
[34:21] worshipper comes and puts his head or
[34:23] hand upon the head of his sacrifice
[34:25] which was Jesus Christ and finds out
[34:28] that he had made paid the price for our
[34:30] sin and it wasn't [music]
[34:33] wasn't some bulls and goats or some by
[34:35] law. He said but his name's been put on
[34:37] the lamb's book of life and then the
[34:39] worshipper can walk out with a clean
[34:40] heart. Amen. When you realize that we
[34:43] have a sacrifice that's been made for
[34:45] us. How many say that's the desire of
[34:47] your heart tonight? Amen. and that you
[34:49] could walk out of the presence of God
[34:51] with a clean heart. Amen. We sure love
[34:53] the Lord tonight [music] and just say
[34:54] it's good to be in the house of the
[34:56] Lord. Want to welcome each one of you
[34:59] tonight. And I just want to remember in
[35:01] prayer uh this uh Sister Alina, which is
[35:06] one of the ladies that aren't that don't
[35:08] live here, their family, but they listen
[35:10] to the services. Uh but she's been
[35:13] having some real bad morning sickness
[35:15] asking the church uh for prayer. Also a
[35:18] prayer request for Olivia Simpson. Uh
[35:21] the doctor says says that she either has
[35:24] ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
[35:27] So just ask the Lord to touch her body.
[35:30] Just remember her in prayer this
[35:32] evening. Maybe if somebody else have a
[35:34] need on their heart. I know God is
[35:35] certainly mindful of what we have need
[35:37] of. But before we [music] approach the
[35:39] word of God, I think we ought to bring
[35:41] our petitions before the Lord according
[35:43] to the word. Amen. And just call upon
[35:45] the name of the Lord. So let's just bow
[35:47] our heads together and just each one
[35:49] [music] ask him in your own way.
[35:51] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are
[35:53] so grateful, Lord, to be able to stand
[35:55] and just to come to fellowship together
[35:58] around the word of God. Lord, how
[36:01] wonderful that you are, Lord. You've
[36:03] been so mindful of us, Lord. and you've
[36:06] done so many miracles in our midst,
[36:09] Lord, and many sicknesses that have been
[36:11] healed, Lord. And God, [music] people
[36:13] that have been in all sorts of
[36:15] conditions and places and many cases
[36:18] throughout the the church and the body
[36:20] of believers, but Lord, we've seen your
[36:23] hand on so many times. And Lord, so we
[36:26] just ask you tonight once again, Lord,
[36:28] that you'd be mindful of your children,
[36:29] Lord. And God, I pray that you would
[36:31] touch those that are sick, that are
[36:32] need, have a need this this evening,
[36:34] Lord. you know what we have need of. And
[36:36] Lord, we just come asking your hand of
[36:39] mercy [music] upon each one of these.
[36:41] Lord, we pray that you would anoint the
[36:43] word of God as we read it, Lord, that it
[36:45] would bring life to those that hear it.
[36:47] We pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[36:50] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. And
[36:53] if you have your Bibles with you, just
[36:55] want to invite you to the book of Acts.
[36:57] And we're going to read out of the fifth
[36:58] chapter in the 16th verse. Acts 5 and
[37:02] 16.
[37:10] Amen. How many enjoy those services over
[37:12] the weekend, Brother Homer? Amen. I
[37:14] don't know how many of y'all's been
[37:15] going around the house saying, "I'm
[37:16] still corn."
[37:18] Me and Brother Ben, we texted, we've
[37:20] been texting back and forth. I'm still
[37:22] corn. And it don't matter how loud you
[37:24] say it or how quiet you say it. Has the
[37:25] same meaning. Amen. And I sure enjoy
[37:28] brother Homer and what [clears throat] a
[37:29] blessing he was to the church and and
[37:32] sure always appreciated his ministry and
[37:34] and certainly an elder in this message
[37:37] and have a lot of great a lot of respect
[37:39] for brother Homer. So we sure appreciate
[37:42] him come and open up his heart to us and
[37:44] it was definitely edifying to our
[37:46] church. Amen. And I know I grew so uh uh
[37:49] you know I know many testify the same
[37:52] thing and I think that's what we ought
[37:53] to do every time we come in the house of
[37:55] God is to grow a little bit closer to
[37:57] God. Amen. So I want to read out of Acts
[38:00] the 5th chapter and we'll read from the
[38:02] 16th verse. The Bible says now this this
[38:05] is after uh that they had been the
[38:08] disciples that Peter and they had been
[38:10] thrown into a prison and came back out
[38:14] of the the prison. They had been so uh
[38:16] tormented by the Pharisees and and uh
[38:19] there was many that was following them
[38:21] around and and and seen many great
[38:23] miracles. And the Bible said there came
[38:26] also a multitude out of the cities
[38:28] around about Jerusalem uh bringing sick
[38:31] folks and them which were vexed with
[38:32] unclean spirits and they were healed
[38:34] everyone. Then the high priest rose up
[38:37] and all that were with him, which is in
[38:39] the sect of the Sadducees, and were
[38:41] filled with indignation. And they laid
[38:43] their hands on the apostles to put them
[38:45] in the common prison. But the angel of
[38:48] the Lord by night opened the prison
[38:50] doors and brought them forth and said,
[38:52] "Go stand and speak in the temple to the
[38:55] people all the words of this life." And
[38:58] I would like to use that as a title uh
[39:00] tonight. Go stand and speak. And I'll
[39:04] just allow you to take your seats, go
[39:06] stand, and speak. You know, this
[39:09] instruction has been given many times uh
[39:11] in the Bible. And and in fact, um uh
[39:14] when God has a message for a people,
[39:16] there's always I find that this is the
[39:18] truth that there's always somebody to
[39:20] deliver God's message. God never has a
[39:22] message without uh finding somebody that
[39:24] will deliver it uh to the people. And
[39:26] the Bible is filled with examples of
[39:28] those that were sent out by God. And uh
[39:31] we won't have time to go through them
[39:32] all, but all through the scripture,
[39:34] whether it been Moses who was ordained
[39:36] of God to go into Egypt or whether uh it
[39:39] was Elijah that was called of God to go
[39:42] prophesy in the in the days of Ahab and
[39:44] many great prophets of God. But uh
[39:47] anytime God had a message, he would the
[39:49] Bible would tell us that they would be
[39:50] sent out by God. They would uh they
[39:52] would they would have this same
[39:54] instruction from God. Uh, brother
[39:56] Brandham actually preached a message
[39:57] called Gold Tale, which was a message
[40:00] concerning the commission that the angel
[40:02] of the Lord gave uh, at the time of
[40:05] Jesus's resurrection. Remember when Mary
[40:07] and they went down to the tomb and they
[40:08] found uh, there was that he wasn't
[40:10] there, but there was a man sitting by
[40:12] the side and he said to them, "Go and
[40:15] tell the disciples that he's on his way
[40:17] to meet them." And and so, not only were
[40:19] they sent, but they were they were sent
[40:21] with a message. message. Brother Bam
[40:23] said, you know, it doesn't do much good
[40:24] uh to go if you haven't got something to
[40:27] tell. Said, I think it's been a whole
[40:28] lot of the trouble today as we go to
[40:30] tell, but we've got nothing to tell.
[40:32] Nothing of any benefit, nothing that
[40:34] would help people. But see, there's many
[40:36] people going, there's a lot of people
[40:37] going and there's a lot of people
[40:39] talking and a lot of people telling, but
[40:41] you have to have something to be able to
[40:43] tell. He said, uh, so it's nothing of
[40:45] any benefit or nothing that would help
[40:46] people, but if we would follow the
[40:48] instructions of the these disciples who
[40:51] got the commission and realize that we
[40:53] have the same commission. Go and tell my
[40:56] disciples that I am risen from the dead
[40:58] and just go tell it. I I thought that
[41:00] that that's a good lesson for every
[41:02] preacher. It's a good lesson for every
[41:04] church member. Uh when we when we're
[41:06] when we're out delivering the message
[41:07] that God has given us, there was a real
[41:10] uh commission that he gave us. He said,
[41:11] "It's the same one they had. that it's a
[41:13] go tell that Jesus has been resurrected
[41:15] from the dead. And we see that in Mark
[41:18] the 16th chapter when Jesus would speak
[41:20] to the disciples just before he ascended
[41:23] into glory. The Bible said he told them,
[41:25] "Go ye into all the world and preach the
[41:28] gospel to every creature. And he that
[41:30] believeth and is baptized shall be
[41:32] saved, but he that believeth not shall
[41:35] be damned. And these signs shall follow
[41:37] them that believe in my name. They shall
[41:39] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[41:41] new tongues. They shall take up serpents
[41:43] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[41:45] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[41:47] hands on the sick and they shall
[41:48] recover. So, so first we see this uh
[41:51] being it was it was spoke during the
[41:54] resurrection go and tell my disciples
[41:56] and then uh then after the after it was
[42:00] told to the disciples to go manifest the
[42:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ he said go
[42:05] into all the world and preach the
[42:07] gospel. So it's the same message go and
[42:09] tell. I I thought isn't it something?
[42:11] And it came whenever the angel spoke to
[42:13] Mary. It came when Jesus spoke to the
[42:15] disciples. And then we find that same
[42:17] message in the book of Acts. And that
[42:19] realize that the message hasn't changed.
[42:21] The Bible said, "Go stand and speak the
[42:24] words of this life." And not only did he
[42:26] send them, but brother Ben, but he gave
[42:28] them the words to be able to speak. He
[42:30] said, "Go speak the words of this life."
[42:32] In other words, you have a message and
[42:34] that message is is the life or the
[42:36] resurrection of Jesus Christ. See? So,
[42:38] so God's word it, you know, I think that
[42:41] God has given us that message. It's not
[42:42] a changed message. It ain't a new
[42:44] message. He hadn't given us something uh
[42:46] today that's different than it ever has
[42:48] been. It's always been the same message.
[42:50] It's the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I
[42:52] think a lot of times that people uh they
[42:54] they get lost in what the message is and
[42:56] they uh they lose the reality of what
[42:59] this message is and try to make it
[43:00] something else and and trying to bring
[43:02] people into something else. But this is
[43:04] the message that God has given unto us.
[43:06] It's the tale of the resurrection of
[43:08] Jesus Christ. That's why we live in this
[43:10] age and we've seen many great miracles
[43:12] and there was a prophet in this age that
[43:14] that was per that performed many great
[43:16] miracles. It was to show the
[43:18] resurrection of Jesus Christ. So So you
[43:20] see it's still the same message all
[43:21] along. It ain't never changed. It's the
[43:23] same foundation that was laid. It was
[43:25] Jesus Christ. And and that's the
[43:27] commission that the church has today is
[43:29] to go and tell of the life or the
[43:32] resurrection of Jesus Christ. And you
[43:34] know what I find out to be the truth?
[43:36] That whenever God's word is told that it
[43:39] always has a reaction. How many believes
[43:40] that God's word is spoke, there's alo
[43:43] always a reaction. When the word of God
[43:45] goes forth, there's belief or there's
[43:46] unbelief. There's judgment or there's
[43:48] mercy. There there's there's many
[43:51] different things, but there's always a
[43:53] reaction. You know, I think about how uh
[43:56] that that there's always a response.
[43:57] When God gives an order to go speak,
[43:59] there's something uh that that God is
[44:01] seeking for. God don't send a message
[44:03] without a purpose for the message to be
[44:05] sent. He don't send an order without a
[44:07] purpose. He don't send anything out.
[44:09] There's nothing idle that's done by God.
[44:11] He don't give you a an order to go out
[44:13] and do something that has no purpose.
[44:15] But if God sent you to speak, then
[44:17] there's somebody there that would hear
[44:19] what you have to say. It makes me think
[44:22] of Eleazar. And whenever the Bible says
[44:24] that he went out seeking a bride for
[44:26] Isaac, do you realize that Eleazar uh
[44:28] first of all, Eleazar did not have his
[44:30] own message. He uh he was actually uh
[44:33] when he went down that old dusty trail
[44:35] and he out there going out to seek for a
[44:37] bride for for the man Isaac. But you
[44:40] realize that that the that Eleazar was
[44:42] on a mission of Abraham. He wasn't on
[44:45] his own mission. He wasn't uh trying to
[44:47] do his own thing. But brother said
[44:49] Eleazar he was representing the message
[44:51] that went forth from Abraham. So the
[44:53] message came from Abraham. Eleazar was a
[44:56] vessel that was going forth to bring
[44:58] about a child or a bride unto the unto
[45:00] his son Isaac which was a type of the
[45:02] father today uh that was sending out a
[45:05] message in this hour to bring a bride to
[45:07] his pro to his son which was Jesus
[45:10] Christ. So there would be a church in
[45:11] this last day that would hear the
[45:13] ministry of that eleaser or that eleaser
[45:16] call that would that would respond to
[45:18] it. You realize friends the eleaser he
[45:20] didn't carry his own message. He didn't
[45:22] have his own agenda. He wasn't trying to
[45:24] build his own kingdom. But the Bible
[45:26] said that he carried gifts from the
[45:28] father Abraham down to the well. That
[45:30] mean every gift that he had, every
[45:32] ability that he had, all that he took to
[45:34] the well, all that was displayed before
[45:37] Rebecca, none of it was Eleaser's. It
[45:39] was all belonged to Abraham. Eleazar was
[45:42] just a poor man in service to Abraham
[45:44] and service to the father that came back
[45:47] down and delivered the gifts that the
[45:48] father had given unto him for the
[45:50] purpose of bringing a bride unto his
[45:53] son. And friends, let me tell you, when
[45:54] God sends someone with a message, he
[45:57] equipped him for the journey. He gave
[45:58] Elezer what he needed. He He gave him
[46:00] every gift that he would need. He knew
[46:02] what would turn her heart. He knew what
[46:04] would put a smile on her face. He He
[46:06] knew what would melt her heart.
[46:08] He knew everything to give her that and
[46:11] he knew this. He knew that whenever he
[46:13] went and he that there would be two
[46:15] things just like every call of God there
[46:18] there's a calling and there's a response
[46:20] to the calling. I believe that that God
[46:22] knew when Eleazar left the house of
[46:24] Abraham that Eleazar wasn't going to
[46:26] come back empty-handed. How many believe
[46:28] that? And I believe in this hour that
[46:30] God knew when he sent a message in the
[46:31] middle of Leodysa that it wouldn't come
[46:33] back empty. But there will be somebody
[46:35] that would respond to the call of God.
[46:38] See, anytime there's a calling, there's
[46:40] always a response. Brother Homer
[46:42] preached the message on how a seed
[46:43] responds to the light. And and you
[46:46] realize that you're serving God is a
[46:48] response. It's not just something that
[46:50] you decided to do, but you being here
[46:51] this morning or tonight and you just
[46:53] serving God. It's a response to a call
[46:56] that God has placed in your life. For
[46:58] you to come to church on a Wednesday
[47:00] night and you to have your hands raised
[47:02] and be serving and committing your life
[47:04] to God. Every bit of that is a response
[47:06] to a call. We didn't just get up one day
[47:08] and decide, I'm going to be a church
[47:09] member. I'm going to go down to Grace
[47:11] Tabernacle and I'm going to put in my
[47:12] time and I'm going to but but it has
[47:14] nothing to do with that. All of your
[47:16] serving God is a response to a call that
[47:19] God placed in your life. You being a
[47:21] believer is a response. You serving God
[47:23] is a response. You being filled with the
[47:25] Holy Ghost, it's a response to a call of
[47:28] God. I can prove that by the Bible
[47:29] because Joel said, "This promise is unto
[47:31] is to you and to your children and them
[47:34] that are a far off and as many as the
[47:36] Lord our God shall call." So in order
[47:39] for you to even receive the Holy Ghost,
[47:41] it had to be a response to a call that
[47:43] God has made in this hour. So here God
[47:46] came down and he's calling to the church
[47:48] and he's calling right in the middle of
[47:49] this old rugged age and this old lost
[47:52] age in the middle of the darkness of
[47:54] Leodysia in the filth of this world but
[47:56] the call of God is still going out and
[47:59] the cry of God is still going out and
[48:01] that Eleaser message is still going out
[48:03] and every now and then it'll come by a
[48:05] well where there's a Rebecca that's
[48:07] sitting there that something on the
[48:09] inside of her heart hears the voice of
[48:11] Eleaser and it caused her to turn her
[48:13] heart unto uh Isaac.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that something that she was
[48:17] she was drawn to him? Why? It was a
[48:19] response to a call. See, some I think
[48:21] sometimes people misunderstand God. You
[48:23] know, I I you know, because they say,
[48:25] "Well, I think I thought we we called on
[48:27] God, that's whenever we're ser we're
[48:28] saved." And that's the Bible. That's
[48:30] what Paul said. He said he's the Lord
[48:32] over all and he's rich unto all that
[48:34] call upon him. So, you call for
[48:37] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[48:38] the Lord shall be saved. How many
[48:41] believe that? Whosoever shall call upon
[48:43] the name of the Lord shall be saved. But
[48:45] can I go a little bit farther? Said, but
[48:47] how can they call on him who they have
[48:50] not believed? And how shall they believe
[48:52] in him if they have not heard? And how
[48:54] can they hear without a preacher? See,
[48:56] how can the message get out if there
[48:57] ain't nobody to preach it? And how shall
[48:59] they preach except they be sent? So,
[49:01] what that tells us is before you could
[49:03] ever call on God to be saved, first you
[49:06] had to receive a call from God that that
[49:08] was sent by an anointed person, a a man
[49:11] of God that was anointed for the hour to
[49:13] take the word of God and come right down
[49:15] to your house or to your living room and
[49:17] to deliver a message from God that was a
[49:19] call of God and something would prick
[49:21] your heart and that little prick in your
[49:23] heart WOULD CAUSE YOU TO call upon the
[49:25] name of the Lord. Thereby, you are
[49:27] saved. It all come from God calling us
[49:30] first. See, this was Eleazar's ministry.
[49:32] He went for the purpose of getting a
[49:35] bride for the promised son. And you know
[49:37] what? I I I love this because Eleazar
[49:40] didn't know what her name was. He didn't
[49:41] know what she looked like. He I h how
[49:45] will I know who she is? What if she
[49:47] don't come? How will I be able to
[49:49] recognize her? All these things that was
[49:51] on his heart. But you know what Abraham
[49:53] told him before he left? He said, "Don't
[49:55] worry about all of that, Eleazar,
[49:57] because the God that made the promise,
[49:59] he will send an angel before you, and
[50:02] you shall bring forth a bride for my
[50:05] son." So, there wasn't nothing in
[50:07] Eleazar's heart that wondered, "When I
[50:09] go down by the well, I'm going to come
[50:11] back empty-handed because he had a
[50:12] promise from God. You just go down there
[50:14] and preach the message, and you're and
[50:16] an angel's going to go before you." In
[50:18] other words, he's going to play. He He's
[50:20] going to cause them. He's going to make
[50:21] an atmosphere. He's going to prepare the
[50:23] hearts of the people. An angel will go
[50:25] before you that when they hear the call,
[50:27] they're going to respond the right way.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody has been prepared to hear the
[50:32] word or the message from Eleazar. See
[50:35] the when he come, he he said, "You just
[50:37] go you just go say what I say to to say
[50:40] you." In other words, you just go preach
[50:41] the message. You just go you just go
[50:43] speak it. You know what? He may have
[50:45] went down there feeling like I'm not the
[50:46] man equipped for the I just preached
[50:48] tonight. I I'm not the man equipped for
[50:49] this. and you know there's many that are
[50:51] a lot better than me and maybe somebody
[50:53] would be they'd be goodter at it and
[50:54] they'd get a little bit more response
[50:56] and all of that. He said, "But you just
[50:57] go preach the message. I'll send an
[50:59] angel down there before you and I'll
[51:01] prepare the heart of the one that's
[51:03] supposed to receive it and she'll
[51:04] respond."
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Even after all of
[51:08] that promise, Eleaser still being a real
[51:10] man of God, you know what he done? He
[51:12] got down there and he started praying to
[51:14] God. He said, "Lord, here I am. I've
[51:16] done all this traveling. I I packed the
[51:18] camels. We loaded the the the the train.
[51:20] We we we we've got all the gifts and
[51:22] everything. We come down to the well
[51:24] now. He sat there thirsty and he be to
[51:27] he be to pray to God and say, "Lord, can
[51:29] you give me some way to know that she's
[51:30] the one?" He said, "Let her I I just
[51:32] pray let her be the one that when I
[51:34] asked for a drink that she would say,
[51:35] not only will I give you a drink, but
[51:37] I'll water your camels also." See, in
[51:40] his prayer was that her response would
[51:43] identify who she was. In other words,
[51:46] listen what he's saying. I don't have
[51:47] the ability to identify her. I don't
[51:50] have the ability. I don't know if she
[51:52] belongs TO YOU OR NOT. I don't know if
[51:54] she's the one OR NOT. I CAN LOOK AT
[51:56] ACROSS THE WHOLE CONGREGATION. I DON'T
[51:58] KNOW WHO'S SAVED AND WHO AIN'T. I DON'T
[51:59] HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE who
[52:01] belongs to God and who don't. But he
[52:04] said, God, let her response be her
[52:06] identification. Isn't that a prayer? I
[52:09] don't have the ability. He said, BUT LET
[52:11] HER RESPOND in such a way that she would
[52:13] be identified. And so you see that her
[52:15] response became her identity. And while
[52:18] she was praying, while he was praying,
[52:20] the Bible says all of a sudden Rebecca
[52:22] came walking on the scene. While he was
[52:24] yet praying, the very thing he was
[52:26] praying about, came walking down there.
[52:28] And you know what he done, Eleaser? He
[52:30] called upon her. He he, you know, and
[52:31] and he asked her for a drink. And she
[52:33] said the very thing that he prayed,
[52:35] "Well, not only will I give you to
[52:36] drink, but I'll water your camels also."
[52:38] You know what he didn't have to do? He
[52:40] never had to talk her into it. He never
[52:42] had to coach her into him. He never had
[52:44] to prime it out of her. All he said was,
[52:46] "Would you give me a drink?" And she
[52:48] responded the way she was supposed to
[52:50] respond. And you know what he done? HE
[52:52] SAID, "THIS IS HER. PRAISE GOD. IT'S
[52:54] HER." HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S HER, ELEAZAR?
[52:56] Because her response identified who she
[52:59] was. She heard the message of the hour
[53:01] and she responded to it. SHE HEARD THE
[53:03] CALL OF GOD AND SHE RESPONDED TO IT.
[53:05] There's many that would have ran away.
[53:07] There's many that would have went the
[53:08] other way or went home. But she
[53:10] responded to the call of God and her
[53:12] response identified who she was. And
[53:15] then he told her what his purpose of was
[53:17] for being there and how that she had
[53:19] fulfilled it. But remember says here the
[53:20] character. He said he found the
[53:22] character that was in the woman Rebecca,
[53:24] that beautiful bride of Isaac. And he
[53:25] told her about Isaac and she never
[53:27] questioned one thing but she believed
[53:29] the word of the messenger and she made
[53:31] ready to go. She said I will go. He said
[53:34] to what? A man she had never even seen
[53:35] or know nothing about. But yet she was
[53:37] ready because she was predestinated or
[53:40] for ordained to that. An angel had
[53:42] already came and prepared the way. It
[53:44] had prepared the ground. He had prepared
[53:46] every heart that whenever she heard that
[53:48] message of Eleaser, she would respond
[53:50] the right way. Friends, I don't know
[53:51] about you, but I say, God, let me just
[53:53] respond the right way. I may know not
[53:55] not know the right thing to say, but let
[53:57] my response be so be it. Let my response
[54:00] be amen to the word of God. Let my
[54:02] response be Lord. SO BE IT UNTO ME LORD
[54:05] AS YOU see fit.
[54:07] But notice what it was. What showed her
[54:10] character is that she responded. He said
[54:13] she was a woman of great character. But
[54:15] what showed her character is that she
[54:17] responded without knowing anything.
[54:20] Isn't that wonderful? She didn't respond
[54:23] because she was going to get a gift.
[54:24] Hello somebody.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; She didn't respond because she was going
[54:28] to get something. She responded I as a
[54:31] fulfillment of prophecy. It's it was the
[54:34] heart of a servant. She never expected
[54:36] one thing. See, she she wasn't looking
[54:38] for gifts. She wasn't looking for
[54:41] recognition. Hello, somebody. She wasn't
[54:43] looking for glory. She wasn't looking
[54:45] for praise. She responded because of who
[54:48] she was. I I got news for you. We live
[54:50] in a world that it's like living in an
[54:52] elementary school. Everywhere you go,
[54:54] everybody's looking for praise. I'll do
[54:56] that if you'll give me a little praise.
[54:58] I I'll do that if I can get a little
[54:59] glory. I'll do that if I can get a
[55:01] little money. I I'll do that if I CAN
[55:03] GET A LITTLE BIT. AFTER ALL, don't you
[55:04] see what everybody's like a bunch of
[55:05] elementary school kids? It's good for
[55:08] kids. But when adults are doing it, it
[55:10] shows the maturity of the adult. A kid
[55:12] says, "Didn't I do good, daddy? Don't
[55:14] you like that? Isn't my drawing good?
[55:16] Isn't that good? Isn't that wonderful?"
[55:17] That's a That's a child. But as you grow
[55:19] and mature as a Christian, we're not
[55:21] seeking after that. We're not praise
[55:23] seekers. We're not looking for the
[55:25] praise of men. Matter of fact, the Bible
[55:27] said that there was many chief priests
[55:29] and elders that believed on Jesus
[55:31] Christ, but they wouldn't confess his
[55:33] name because they was afraid they would
[55:34] be thrown out of the synagogue. And the
[55:36] Bible says, "For they love the praise of
[55:38] men more than they love the praise of
[55:40] God."
[55:42] &gt;&gt; This world is full of praise seekers.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Didn't you see what I done? Can't you
[55:47] see what I done? Can't you always
[55:48] looking for praise because they're not
[55:50] confident in just the in just serving
[55:52] the Lord? So, see, they're they're
[55:54] praise seekers. Jesus said, "Take heed."
[55:56] Can
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't that ain't nice. But
[55:59] I'm just going to say it like it is.
[56:01] We're not We don't serve God to get
[56:02] anything.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; So, see, she she didn't she didn't
[56:05] respond to get anything. She wasn't
[56:06] looking for a gift. She wasn't looking
[56:07] for a handout.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; She was just responding because of who
[56:11] she was.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Take heed when you do your
[56:14] arms before men, not to be seen of them.
[56:17] Otherwise, you have no reward of your
[56:19] father which is in heaven."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; So, when you give, you don't give to be
[56:22] seen given.
[56:25] I'm just going to give you some free
[56:26] teaching. You don't give to be sing
[56:28] given. He said, because you will have no
[56:31] reward from your father which is in
[56:33] heaven. Therefore, when you do thine
[56:35] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee
[56:37] as the hypocrites and the synagogues do,
[56:40] but it may be the may glory from men.
[56:42] But I say unto you, they have their
[56:44] reward. But when you do arms, let not
[56:46] the left hand know what the right hand
[56:48] doeth, that thine arms may be in secret,
[56:50] and thy father which seeth in secret
[56:52] himself shall reward thee openly. So So
[56:55] you give in secret that you're rewarded
[56:57] openly. Says, see why why do you serve
[56:59] God? Why do you give? Do we give to to
[57:02] get recognition or to get glory or or to
[57:04] get praise? He said, even when you pray,
[57:06] don't be as the hypocrites are because
[57:08] they stand in the synagogues and the
[57:09] corners of the streets that they may be
[57:11] seen of men. He said, "But I say they
[57:13] have their reward. But when you pray,
[57:15] enter into thy closet, and the door
[57:17] shut, pray to the Father in secret, and
[57:19] the Father which seeth thee in secret
[57:21] shall reward thee openly. But when you
[57:23] pray, use not vain repetition as the
[57:25] heathen does, for they think that they
[57:27] shall be heard for their much speaking.
[57:30] But but be not ye therefore like them,
[57:32] for your Father knoweth what things you
[57:34] have need of before you even ask him."
[57:36] So we don't have to make vain
[57:38] repetitions and vain babblins and try to
[57:41] be somebody or make some some great
[57:43] prayer or something in front of
[57:44] everybody to try to gain recognition.
[57:46] You know why? Because we're not looking
[57:48] for praise. We're not looking for glory.
[57:50] I'm not looking for men's applause. I
[57:53] IT'S OKAY TO GET IT. When somebody does
[57:55] something, it's okay to say good job and
[57:58] God bless you. And it's okay to reward
[57:59] them. But we don't serve God in order to
[58:02] get a reward from men. I SERVE GOD JUST
[58:05] TO SERVE GOD. I SERVE GOD BECAUSE THAT'S
[58:08] WHO WE ARE. And let me tell I may as
[58:10] well just preach that I'm here anyway. I
[58:12] I didn't know I was going to get into
[58:13] all this. But let me tell you what
[58:14] happens when you go praise seeking. It
[58:16] robs you from the blessing that God
[58:18] wants to give you. Because when you're
[58:20] seeking the praises of men and you don't
[58:22] get praised like you ought to get
[58:23] praised or you feel like you ought to
[58:25] get praised and then you're down and
[58:27] you're critical and you're upset in your
[58:28] spirit and then the blessing that God
[58:30] would give you for what you done, you
[58:32] can't even recognize the blessing
[58:34] because you're so tore up because you're
[58:36] expecting something else
[58:38] &gt;&gt; from men,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; it robs you of your blessing.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; You don't get your blessing. It's
[58:42] overshadowed. your blessing from God
[58:44] becomes overshadowed by your desire to
[58:47] be praised by men.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Said, but we don't we don't we don't
[58:51] come to God seeking seeking praise or
[58:54] seeking glory. You know, you remember
[58:56] whenever Jesus was standing in the house
[58:58] or sitting in the house of Simon and
[59:00] that little ill-famed woman went down to
[59:02] where he was, brother said, "Notice that
[59:04] woman when she washed Jesus's feet, he
[59:06] said she never asked for a blessing."
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? She knelt down at
[59:10] his feet. You remember you remember the
[59:12] story? She knelt she knelt down at his
[59:14] feet and she looked at him that that old
[59:16] hypocrite Simon was making fun of him
[59:18] and and trying to degrade his character.
[59:20] So that's what they're always trying to
[59:21] do. Make him look little and like he's
[59:23] nothing but that old Pharisee after he
[59:25] invited him in there and he let him sit
[59:27] back there. He never washed his feet.
[59:29] They never they never done anything to
[59:31] him. They didn't greet him like they did
[59:33] others. They just let him come in so
[59:35] they could make fun of him. And you
[59:36] know, remember when they came in, they
[59:38] they may put a robe on them or or wash
[59:40] their feet at the door and spray some
[59:42] perfume and make them welcome that that
[59:44] everybody can come and fellowship
[59:45] together. But when Jesus came in the
[59:47] building, even though that he was
[59:48] invited in there, they didn't welcome
[59:50] him. They didn't wash his feet. They
[59:52] didn't greet him with a kiss. They they
[59:53] didn't put a robe on him. They didn't
[59:55] they they they had no perfume to put on
[59:58] him, but they just allowed him sit over
[59:59] there in the corner with dirty feet to
[1:00:01] be mocked and made fun of. That's the
[1:00:03] one down there in Nazareth. That's the
[1:00:05] one that's out prophesying. That's the
[1:00:07] one that that's out healing the sick and
[1:00:09] raising the dead and making the lame
[1:00:11] leap like a heart. That's the one that
[1:00:12] that's trying to fulfill all the all the
[1:00:15] words of David. They just sitting there
[1:00:17] and poked fun and made fun of him
[1:00:19] sitting there. But all of a sudden that
[1:00:20] little prostitute walked by. But says
[1:00:22] she was just a little degraded woman.
[1:00:24] Had a few nickels that she had earned
[1:00:26] from her ill fame living. But when she
[1:00:28] saw him sitting there and she came down
[1:00:30] to his feet and those big tears rolled
[1:00:32] down her cheek, she went down there and
[1:00:34] she bought an alabaster box with all the
[1:00:36] money that she had. She bought an
[1:00:38] alabaster box of ointment and and she
[1:00:41] slipped away in some way. She snuck in
[1:00:43] into the building where he was and she
[1:00:44] fell down at his feet and she began to
[1:00:46] cry. And when she went she didn't have a
[1:00:49] towel to wash his feet with. He said so
[1:00:51] she took her hair and she began to wipe
[1:00:53] his feet with her hair. thought what a
[1:00:55] what a beautiful water for his feet was
[1:00:58] the tears of a repentant sinner as she
[1:01:00] began to wash his feet and you realize
[1:01:02] that she wasn't asking God I thought
[1:01:04] about her kneeling there many times
[1:01:06] you'd wonder but that woman kneeling at
[1:01:08] the feet of Jesus what what would you do
[1:01:09] at the feet of Jesus but you know you
[1:01:11] realize that while she was down there
[1:01:13] she never asked him for one thing she
[1:01:16] never asked him for one thing she wasn't
[1:01:18] kneeling there to get personal gain she
[1:01:21] wasn't kneeling there to make her life
[1:01:22] better she wasn't kneeling there uh to
[1:01:24] try to gain some wealth or or gain some
[1:01:27] recognition or to be a somebody. She
[1:01:29] just seen but said she just seen that it
[1:01:31] needed to be done. She knelt down at his
[1:01:34] feet because she seen that it needed to
[1:01:37] be done. He said that's what I was. I
[1:01:39] was I was just that type of people, a no
[1:01:41] good sinner. Every one of us was the
[1:01:43] same that hasn't come to him. He said,
[1:01:45] "But you don't just come to be a member
[1:01:47] of a church, but you come because
[1:01:49] there's something to be done because
[1:01:52] Jesus needs to be served. Somebody
[1:01:55] should be there." Oh, don't you think we
[1:01:57] ought TO DO IT? SOMEBODY should be
[1:01:58] there. She didn't say, "Lord, IF YOU
[1:02:00] BLESS ME, I'LL SERVE YOU. LORD, IF
[1:02:02] YOU'LL BLESS MY HOME, I'LL SERVE YOU.
[1:02:04] LORD, IF YOU'LL GIVE ME WEALTH, I'LL
[1:02:06] SERVE YOU. LORD, IF YOU'LL GIVE ME
[1:02:07] STATUS, THEN I'LL SERVE YOU." BUT SHE
[1:02:09] JUST SEEN THAT IT NEEDED TO BE DONE.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And she served him. He said, "Is there
[1:02:14] somebody that'll just serve him?" She
[1:02:16] just washed his feet and she wiped them
[1:02:18] with the hairs of her head. Said, "Can't
[1:02:20] we do that today? Can't we do that today
[1:02:23] that we just don't ask for nothing?"
[1:02:25] Hello, somebody. Can't we do that today
[1:02:28] that we just don't ask for nothing? It
[1:02:30] just needs to be done. He needs to be
[1:02:32] worshiped. He needs to be served. The
[1:02:34] gospel needs to be preached. WHETHER WE
[1:02:36] GET A PENNY OR OR WE DON'T GET NOTHING,
[1:02:38] IT NEEDS TO BE PREACHED. WE HAVE A
[1:02:40] CAUSE. WE NEED TO SERVE GOD. He needs to
[1:02:43] be sure. HE NEEDS TO BE WORSHIPED
[1:02:45] WITHOUT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. I don't
[1:02:47] need a position. I don't need a payment.
[1:02:50] I don't need to be a somebody in the
[1:02:51] church in order to show up for church. I
[1:02:53] DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN OFFICE IN THE
[1:02:55] CHURCH. OH, GOD forbid we give somebody
[1:02:56] an office to make them come to church.
[1:02:58] If that's the reason, that's the worst
[1:03:00] person to ever give an office to.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; It'll be the ones that come to church
[1:03:05] that are there at their posted duty.
[1:03:07] That's the kind of people you give
[1:03:08] offices in the church to because they're
[1:03:11] there. God, y' don't y'all don't get
[1:03:13] after me. Just preaching the word. But
[1:03:16] we don't we don't need a position in
[1:03:18] order to serve God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; I don't need a a a gain. I don't need
[1:03:23] recognition in order to serve God. I
[1:03:25] serve God because of who I am and
[1:03:27] because of who he is. So we were all a
[1:03:30] sinner just like her. But I can come
[1:03:32] before him. I can serve him because of
[1:03:35] who I am and because of who he is. You
[1:03:38] see, we you don't you realize, don't we
[1:03:40] have in there a cause to preach the
[1:03:43] gospel? Do we not have a need? Is this
[1:03:45] world in the worst condition that it's
[1:03:47] ever been? There's certainly a need.
[1:03:48] There's a cause. In a in a time of war,
[1:03:52] there's a need for peace. In a time of
[1:03:55] darkness, there's a need for light. In a
[1:03:57] time of famine, there's a need for
[1:03:59] bread. IN A TIME OF HATRED, there's a
[1:04:01] need for love. I say there's a cause.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; We have a cause. You see, but it's a
[1:04:06] message. But remember said it's a
[1:04:08] message and it's got to go regardless.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what we get out of it,
[1:04:13] it's a message and it has to go forth.
[1:04:15] We serve God because there's a message
[1:04:17] and it has to go forth. Don't you
[1:04:19] realize there's a herd and a wounded and
[1:04:20] a sinful world that's been deceived by
[1:04:23] the devil. But God has given you a
[1:04:25] message to tell the world about a
[1:04:27] resurrected Jesus. I'm not talking about
[1:04:29] the preachers. I'm talking about
[1:04:30] everybody. He's given you a message to
[1:04:32] tell the world about a resurrected Jesus
[1:04:35] that's still alive and he's working
[1:04:37] amongst his people today. How many
[1:04:39] believe that? Say amen. I said he's
[1:04:41] still alive and he's working among his
[1:04:43] church. Let me tell you why, friends?
[1:04:45] Because the devil's done everything he
[1:04:46] can to stomp out the name of Jesus. You
[1:04:49] realize why we have a right to go speak
[1:04:50] the name of Jesus out in this community?
[1:04:53] Because the devil's doing everything he
[1:04:54] can to stomp it out. But I say in the
[1:04:57] face of every devil in hell, in the name
[1:04:59] of Jesus. I say, come on, somebody say
[1:05:02] it WITH ME THIS TONIGHT. IN THE NAME OF
[1:05:04] JESUS, IN THE IT DON'T MATTER WHAT THE
[1:05:06] devil said. IN THE NAME OF JESUS. OH,
[1:05:08] DON'T YOU REALIZE that that in the Bible
[1:05:10] they had been preaching and they and the
[1:05:12] devil it didn't bother him that Peter
[1:05:14] was preaching. It didn't bother him that
[1:05:15] the disciples were preaching. But the
[1:05:17] Bible says what bothered them, what
[1:05:19] stirred them up is because they spoke in
[1:05:22] the name of Jesus Christ. And
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; you know what they done? They came and
[1:05:26] they they put them in the jail and the
[1:05:29] angels came and let them out.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Then they went down
[1:05:33] in the temple and they were preaching in
[1:05:34] the temple according to the instruction
[1:05:36] of the angel. And the council went and
[1:05:38] got them again. And when they brought
[1:05:40] them and set them before the council,
[1:05:42] the high priest asked them, listen what
[1:05:44] he asked. The high priest asked them. He
[1:05:46] said, "Did we not straightly command you
[1:05:49] that you should not teach in his name?"
[1:05:52] Other words, you can you can preach all
[1:05:54] you want to, but leave the name of Jesus
[1:05:56] out of it.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something like the devil? He
[1:06:00] said, you can you can preach what you
[1:06:01] want to, but leave the name of Jesus out
[1:06:03] of it, and you or otherwise you'll fill
[1:06:05] Jerusalem with your doctrine. You intend
[1:06:06] to bring this man's blood upon us. But
[1:06:08] the Bible said, "But Peter and the other
[1:06:10] apostles said, but we ought to obey God
[1:06:12] rather than men. For the God of our
[1:06:14] fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew,
[1:06:17] and you hanged on a tree. In other
[1:06:19] words, you crucified him, but my God
[1:06:21] raised him up. You cast him out, but my
[1:06:24] God drew HIM BACK IN. YOU YOU CURSED
[1:06:26] HIM, BUT GOD BLESSED HIM. YOU STOMPED
[1:06:28] HIM DOWN, BUT GOD HAS ELEVATED HIM.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; He said he's EXALTED HIM WITH HIS RIGHT
[1:06:33] HAND TO BE A PRINCE AND A SAVIOR to give
[1:06:36] repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
[1:06:37] sins. And we are his witnesses of these
[1:06:40] things. And so is the Holy Ghost that
[1:06:43] has been given unto us to them that obey
[1:06:45] him.
[1:06:47] See, they were preaching the name of
[1:06:49] Jesus.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And finally, there was a halfway smart
[1:06:51] Pharisee. There's some men today that
[1:06:54] need to take the wisdom of Galia. There
[1:06:56] was a halfway smart Galia, a Pharisee
[1:07:00] named Galiel. And he said, "If this be
[1:07:02] the work of men, then it'll come to
[1:07:04] nothing. But if it be the work of God,
[1:07:07] we couldn't overthrow it if we wanted
[1:07:08] to, and we're going to find ourselves
[1:07:10] going against God." He said, "So,
[1:07:12] wouldn't it be best if we just left it
[1:07:13] alone and just see what kind of work
[1:07:15] that it is?"
[1:07:17] He said, "See, so finally whenever they
[1:07:20] left, so they said, 'Okay, we'll just
[1:07:21] let them go." So they gave him a good
[1:07:23] beatating and they said, "You can go out
[1:07:26] and then we'll go beat you and then we
[1:07:27] go out, but don't you speak the name of
[1:07:29] Jesus anymore." And they let him go. You
[1:07:33] know what they did, brother Ben, when
[1:07:34] they left? The Bible says they left out
[1:07:36] rejoicing because they counted it worthy
[1:07:39] to suffer shame for his name. They count
[1:07:42] it worthy to be like that little
[1:07:44] prostitute that knelt down at his feet
[1:07:46] that people that ill-famed woman. They
[1:07:48] they count it worthy to be like Rebecca
[1:07:50] that would that would go and just water
[1:07:51] the camels. And why why are you down
[1:07:53] there, Rebecca? You don't even know who
[1:07:54] that is. What are you what are you
[1:07:55] following after? YOU YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
[1:07:57] HIM OR OR WHERE HE COME FROM. You've
[1:07:58] never met THIS HOUSE. WHAT CAUSED YOU TO
[1:08:00] WATER LIKE your water? But she counted
[1:08:03] them worthy
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; because she's who she was. He's who he
[1:08:07] was. The Bible says, "In daily in the
[1:08:10] temple and in every house, they cease
[1:08:12] not to preach and teach in the name of
[1:08:14] Jesus." Let me tell you why Satan don't
[1:08:17] like it. Because he fears the name of
[1:08:19] Jesus. And he's done everything that he
[1:08:21] can to keep the name of Jesus out of the
[1:08:23] mouth of believers. But I say this, I
[1:08:25] say this tonight. In the name of Jesus,
[1:08:27] let the sick be healed. In the name of
[1:08:30] Jesus, let the lame walk. In the name of
[1:08:32] Jesus, let the deaf let the deaf hear.
[1:08:35] In the name of Jesus, let let the dumb
[1:08:37] speak. In the name of Jesus, let the
[1:08:39] blind LET THE BLIND SEE. IN THE NAME OF
[1:08:41] JESUS, LET THOSE THAT ARE BOUND BE FREE.
[1:08:44] IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LET THOSE THAT ARE
[1:08:46] LOST BE SAVED. I DEFY EVERY DEVIL OUT OF
[1:08:48] THE PITS OF HELL THAT WOULD TAKE THE
[1:08:50] NAME OF JESUS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE
[1:08:52] believers or to try to separate it from
[1:08:55] this message in the name of Jesus. So,
[1:08:57] let it be done. Oh, let me tell you what
[1:08:59] that devil's done. He tried to come by
[1:09:01] AND SAY, "WELL, Y'ALL'S FALLEN after
[1:09:02] something, some phony thing, but but but
[1:09:05] because try to make it something that IT
[1:09:07] AIN'T." BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEPARATE the
[1:09:09] name of Jesus away from the message of
[1:09:11] the hour. You realize that, brother
[1:09:12] Brandham, in his recorded ministry, he
[1:09:15] spoke the name of Jesus over 37,000
[1:09:18] times. That's,200 sermons. 37,000 times.
[1:09:22] That's 31 and some change times per
[1:09:25] sermon on an average that he spoke the
[1:09:27] name of Jesus. THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T
[1:09:29] SEPARATE THE MAN FROM HIS MESSAGE. HE
[1:09:32] CAME AS A MINISTRY, an eleaser ministry
[1:09:35] to PREACH THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS
[1:09:37] CHRIST. EVERY TIME HE HAD A MICROPHONE,
[1:09:39] HE SPOKE THE NAME OF JESUS. EVERY TIME
[1:09:42] HE HAD A PLATFORM, HE SPOKE THE NAME OF
[1:09:44] JESUS. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE HIM A VOICE,
[1:09:46] HE SPOKE THE NAME OF JESUS OVER SIN,
[1:09:49] OVER DEVILS, OVER HELL, OVER BONDAGE.
[1:09:53] EVERY TIME YOU GIVE A MAN OF GOD AN
[1:09:55] OPPORTUNITY, HE'LL SPEAK THE name of
[1:09:57] Jesus. He wasn't coming to BUILD HIS OWN
[1:09:59] KINGDOM. HE WASN'T COMING TO TO DRAW
[1:10:01] SOMETHING. WELL, FRIENDS, LET ME TELL
[1:10:03] YOU THAT WHAT A WHAT A MAN THAT THE
[1:10:05] DEVIL WOULD SAY WAS BUILDING A KINGDOM
[1:10:07] UNTO HIMSELF. HE SPOKE ABOUT JESUS a lot
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; to be a man that was trying to build a
[1:10:13] kingdom to himself. But the devil hates
[1:10:15] it. He hates when you preach about the
[1:10:17] resurrection of Jesus Christ. He hates
[1:10:19] it to be manifested. You know why Satan
[1:10:22] hates it? Hello, somebody. You know why
[1:10:23] he hates it? Because the Bible said, "If
[1:10:26] you shall confess with thy mouth the
[1:10:27] Lord Jesus and believe it in your heart
[1:10:30] that God has raised him FROM THE DEAD,
[1:10:32] YOU SHALL BE SAVED."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE DEVIL HATES YOU WHEN YOU
[1:10:36] SPEAK THE NAME OF Jesus
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and confess the name of Jesus with your
[1:10:41] mouth. [snorts]
[1:10:42] Said, "For every for the heart of every
[1:10:43] man believeth under righteousness, with
[1:10:45] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:10:48] salvation.
[1:10:50] said, "Confess the name of the Lord
[1:10:52] Jesus.
[1:10:54] Believe it in thy heart and thou shalt
[1:10:56] be saved." Ain't that powerful? Sister
[1:10:59] Paige, she here few days ago her
[1:11:03] grandfather had passed away. She had
[1:11:05] asked the church for prayer
[1:11:08] and uh he was been very sick and you
[1:11:10] know her real concern was is that her
[1:11:12] grandpa never served the Lord. Many
[1:11:14] times she stood and gave a testimony and
[1:11:16] gave a witness to him, testified to him,
[1:11:19] lived a life in front of him, but he
[1:11:21] never served the Lord. She tried to talk
[1:11:23] to him about church and tried to talk to
[1:11:25] him about the Lord, but no, no, no, no.
[1:11:27] Don't want to talk about that. And I I
[1:11:29] went to his funeral, you know, I
[1:11:31] recognized at his funeral when they
[1:11:32] started putting the pictures on the
[1:11:33] board that Paige was his favorite human
[1:11:35] being. I found that out real fast. Every
[1:11:38] picture flashed whenever he was in a
[1:11:39] picture with her, he was a different
[1:11:40] man. You you just see it on his face.
[1:11:43] But when she asked asked for prayer, he
[1:11:45] was in the hospital, she they they they
[1:11:47] had gone in there to do surgery and the
[1:11:50] and it had failed. And so whenever he
[1:11:52] came back into the room, they said that
[1:11:54] that he's he's probably not going to
[1:11:56] live. It had failed. And they had to
[1:11:57] rush him back in. He was bleeding
[1:11:58] internally. There was no way to stop
[1:12:00] him. And so so we we all went into
[1:12:02] prayer for him. And and and so he went
[1:12:05] back in. It looked like he he wasn't
[1:12:07] going to make it. And they they got
[1:12:09] through the night and they came back the
[1:12:10] next day. And the nurses even said that
[1:12:13] he was a walking miracle. The next day
[1:12:15] he came back and and he he was able to
[1:12:18] communicate with his family and they
[1:12:19] said he was a walking miracle. And the
[1:12:21] next within 24 hours later he had passed
[1:12:23] on. And I remember whenever pages sent
[1:12:26] out the testimony to everybody and said,
[1:12:27] you know, it's such a miracle. My
[1:12:29] grandpa, they gave him they said he was
[1:12:31] wasn't going to make it through the
[1:12:32] night and all this and but but God
[1:12:34] brought him through the night and now
[1:12:35] and now they're they're calling him a
[1:12:36] walk of miracle and glory to God for for
[1:12:38] what he done. And within 24 hours he had
[1:12:40] passed on. You know it troubled her. It
[1:12:42] was uh because you know she had prayed
[1:12:45] and told this testimonies all of it. But
[1:12:47] you know when we were sitting at the
[1:12:48] funeral I heard the minister that was
[1:12:50] doing the doing the service and he got
[1:12:52] to telling that testimony of how what
[1:12:54] had happened to him and how that how
[1:12:56] that he was supposed to be gone. And
[1:12:58] then the and all of a sudden he was back
[1:13:00] and it was a miracle. And here he had
[1:13:01] another day to spend with his family.
[1:13:03] And that man had been trying for a year
[1:13:05] to go sit down and talk to him about the
[1:13:06] Lord. He said, ' And every time I went
[1:13:08] to talk to him, he said, 'N no, not
[1:13:10] right now. Now is not a good time. Very
[1:13:12] friendly, a good man. Everybody loved
[1:13:14] him. He just didn't want to talk about
[1:13:15] the Lord. He said, but that day his son
[1:13:18] called me and said he wants to see you.
[1:13:21] He said, so I went up there with him and
[1:13:23] he said, I heard him out of my own ears.
[1:13:25] I heard him speak, Lord Jesus, will you
[1:13:28] please save me?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I said, that's all I needed to hear
[1:13:31] right there because that's what my Bible
[1:13:32] said in Romans 10:9. If thou shalt
[1:13:35] confess the Lord Jesus with thy mouth
[1:13:37] and believe it in thy heart, thou shalt
[1:13:39] be saved. I thought, isn't our God a
[1:13:42] miracle working God that would give a
[1:13:44] man that SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE THAT
[1:13:46] NEVER ONE DAY DID HE EVER serve the
[1:13:48] Lord, BUT THEN HE WOULD GIVE IT HE WAS
[1:13:49] SO MERCIFUL ENOUGH THAT HE WOULD BRING
[1:13:51] HIM BACK OR OR GIVE HIM LIFE ANOTHER
[1:13:53] DAY, JUST ONE MORE DAY WITH AN
[1:13:55] OPPORTUNITY TO CONFESS THE name of the
[1:13:57] Lord Jesus Christ. FRIENDS, I'M TELLING
[1:13:59] YOU that one confession out of thy mouth
[1:14:02] of the name of Jesus Christ is enough to
[1:14:04] wipe away 80 years or A THOUSAND YEARS
[1:14:07] OF THE SIN OF MANKIND. IT TOOK ONE
[1:14:09] CONFESSION AND A FAITH IN THY HEART TO
[1:14:12] BELIEVE IT. OH FRIENDS, it don't take a
[1:14:14] big work up. It's a confession. THAT'S
[1:14:16] THE POWER THAT'S IN THE NAME OF Jesus
[1:14:18] Christ. No wonder the devil wants to
[1:14:20] keep the name of Jesus out of the mouth
[1:14:22] of the believers because there's power
[1:14:24] in the name of Jesus. It's a deliverer.
[1:14:27] He's a healer. He's a savior. HE SAID,
[1:14:30] "GO STAND AND SPEAK OF THE LIFE THAT GOD
[1:14:33] HAS GIVEN YOU. TAKE A STAND IN THIS HOUR
[1:14:35] AND PREACH THE GOSPEL of Jesus Christ."
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You friends, let me tell you this. The
[1:14:41] apostles, they they disagreed on a lot
[1:14:43] of things, but there's one thing. Many
[1:14:45] Bible studies, there's one thing they
[1:14:48] all agreed on, and that was everything
[1:14:50] we do, we do it in the name of Jesus
[1:14:51] Christ. Paul said, "Whatever you do in
[1:14:54] word or deed, do it in the name of
[1:14:55] Jesus." Book of Acts said there's no
[1:14:57] other salvation in any other name than
[1:14:59] than under the heaven is given among men
[1:15:01] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[1:15:03] Jesus Christ. I say we have a cause to
[1:15:07] bring Jesus present among the people to
[1:15:09] make him known. That's how you realize
[1:15:12] that's how you win people to the Lord.
[1:15:15] They that they can see him in you.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you'll ever win
[1:15:19] anybody to the Lord. That's our cause.
[1:15:21] That's our that's our purpose. It's our
[1:15:23] business. Our business is to win the
[1:15:25] center.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You know, I told Sister Paige and I
[1:15:29] asked her, could I share this? So, it's
[1:15:31] okay. But I told her, I said, you know,
[1:15:33] you you you may not even been there
[1:15:35] whenever your grandpa made that
[1:15:36] confession, but every day you lived a
[1:15:38] life in front of him.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And every day, I promise you that he
[1:15:43] that that that was on his mind. Every
[1:15:45] testimony that you ever told him, it was
[1:15:47] on his mind. Every every thing, every
[1:15:49] opportunity that you ever gave him, it
[1:15:51] was on his mind. See, you win. You don't
[1:15:54] win a sinner. See, see, see, people
[1:15:56] think people think they win souls by by
[1:15:58] by praying for people. Can I just Can I
[1:16:00] give you something?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And you know, you can pray the most
[1:16:03] sincere prayer and it'll never win a
[1:16:05] soul to God.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; They think it's by praying for people.
[1:16:08] I'm going to go pray for the sinner and
[1:16:09] if I pray for them, it'll win them to
[1:16:10] the Lord. But you're praying for them
[1:16:12] will never win them to the Lord.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; It don't win people to God. But said,
[1:16:15] you don't win him by praying for him.
[1:16:17] You win him by talking to him and
[1:16:19] introducing him to Christ. That's your
[1:16:21] business. That's your duty is to win
[1:16:23] sinners by talking to them and
[1:16:25] projecting to them the love of God
[1:16:27] through the word of God. That's what
[1:16:29] wins the sinner. Because some people
[1:16:31] say, "I won't even go to a church, but I
[1:16:32] sure like that woman or I sure I sure
[1:16:34] like that fella." See, because you're
[1:16:36] winning them. And if you would have
[1:16:37] stayed at home and just prayed for the
[1:16:38] sinner and never went in contact, then
[1:16:40] there is very little that can be done.
[1:16:43] But you've got to pray and then go. See,
[1:16:46] you got to go do it. Then you're
[1:16:48] projecting his love. So, it wasn't pray
[1:16:50] and stay, but it was pray and go.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; See, there's a lot of people that pray
[1:16:54] and stay, but that ain't the commission
[1:16:56] that God gave us. It ain't pray for the
[1:16:58] sinner and stay, but it's pray and go
[1:17:00] and go to the That's why Jesus said, "I
[1:17:02] HAVE A NEED TO GO by Samaria to the
[1:17:04] woman at the well." That's why he went
[1:17:06] to the caves of the of the man from Ga
[1:17:09] the Gera that was that was filled with
[1:17:11] ALL THE DEMONS. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE MAN
[1:17:13] THAT WAS HEALED OF BLINDED EYES AND THEY
[1:17:14] KICKED HIM OUT OF THE SYNAGOGUE, THE
[1:17:16] BIBLE SAYS, "BUT JESUS FOUND HIM OUTSIDE
[1:17:18] OF THE CITY AND SAID, "DO YOU BELIEVE on
[1:17:20] the son of God?"
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; See, because he wasn't afraid to go
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; to where they were.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Said, "Pray and go." Not pray and stay.
[1:17:29] Pray and go. Go stand and speak.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; See, we have a commission to go. A
[1:17:37] message to preach. I wish I had all
[1:17:39] night and I know I don't. But we have a
[1:17:42] commission to go and a message to
[1:17:43] preach.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But you realize that what you speak
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; is only as good as the platform that
[1:17:48] you're speaking from.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; It's only as good as you realize that
[1:17:53] what whenever whenever Stephen was
[1:17:56] stoned in the Bible and they they
[1:17:58] brought him down there and here they
[1:18:00] were they were going to stone him for
[1:18:01] for for his conviction. He was out there
[1:18:03] preaching and my he gave him a straight
[1:18:05] message. The Bible says that they saw
[1:18:08] his face as it had been the face of an
[1:18:10] angel. I I know how that's interpreted
[1:18:12] because when people preach it, they say
[1:18:13] his face shined as an angel or it shone
[1:18:16] like an angel. But do you realize that
[1:18:17] when you read that word, they saw his
[1:18:19] face as the face of an angel, that word
[1:18:20] angel is actually messenger. So the
[1:18:23] Bible says, so they saw his face as it
[1:18:25] had been the face of a messenger. Now a
[1:18:27] messenger is face is not a bright light.
[1:18:30] It's not a it's not a bright light. They
[1:18:31] didn't see Stephen in a bright glow on
[1:18:33] his face, but he be here he was
[1:18:35] preaching. You stip you uncircumcised in
[1:18:38] your heart and ears. You resist the Holy
[1:18:39] Ghost. You're just like that what your
[1:18:41] father's done. You do the same thing.
[1:18:43] You crucify Jesus. You're going to pay
[1:18:45] for his sin. You're the you're the ones
[1:18:47] that are lost. He was giving him a
[1:18:48] straight message. But remember, but but
[1:18:50] but the glowing he wasn't glowing like a
[1:18:52] light, but his shining came from where
[1:18:55] he knew where he was standing and he
[1:18:57] knowed his position. Said, "So his face
[1:18:59] may not have shined like a light up
[1:19:01] there, but the angel knows what he's
[1:19:03] doing. An angel is a messenger that's
[1:19:05] commissioned from God. And he don't have
[1:19:07] to back down because he knows right
[1:19:09] where he stands. So what gave him the
[1:19:12] face of an angel was that he had met
[1:19:14] God. He was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:16] HE WAS STEADFAST IN THE MESSAGE THAT GOD
[1:19:18] GAVE HIM. That he was preaching. He
[1:19:20] lived it. He breathed it. And he
[1:19:22] believed it. AND THAT GAVE HIM A PLACE
[1:19:24] TO STAND. BUT SAID THAT'S WHY HIS FACE
[1:19:26] SHONE LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE KNEW RIGHT
[1:19:28] where he was standing
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; because he believed the word of God. He
[1:19:31] was a son of God. Oh friends, don't you
[1:19:33] realize in order for you to go and
[1:19:34] speak, you have to have a place to stand
[1:19:36] and you can't stand You can't stand on
[1:19:38] your own reputation because every one of
[1:19:41] us will be lost. We don't Everybody
[1:19:43] would look at your past and say, "Well,
[1:19:45] I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE I
[1:19:46] know where you came from and I I know
[1:19:48] what you used to be. How I I I promise
[1:19:50] you they'll come and condemn you if you
[1:19:52] no matter where you go to church and no
[1:19:54] matter what your who your pastor is.
[1:19:56] Every church hears the same thing about
[1:19:58] every pastor. But you bet whenever you
[1:20:00] come in the house of God, don't you
[1:20:01] think somebody ain't gonna come by and
[1:20:03] say, "Well, I couldn't ever sit under
[1:20:05] him because I know he used to do this. I
[1:20:07] REMEMBER ONE TIME HE DONE THIS." And you
[1:20:09] know, after all that is, what is it?
[1:20:11] It's a devil that would try to dispute
[1:20:14] the place that we're standing. But do
[1:20:16] you realize that our ministry, it don't
[1:20:18] come from oursel? Our ministry don't
[1:20:20] come from our uh from our past. IT DON'T
[1:20:23] IT AIN'T IT AIN'T BUILT ON OUR OWN
[1:20:24] MERIT. WE'RE NOT STANDING ON OUR own
[1:20:26] reputation, but what we're standing on
[1:20:28] is I'VE BEEN REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF
[1:20:31] JESUS CHRIST. AND THE STEADFASTNESS
[1:20:33] DOESN'T COME FROM MY EFFORT. It come
[1:20:35] from the BLOOD OF JESUS. I MADE MY
[1:20:37] CONFESSION. I BELIEVED IT WITH MY HEART.
[1:20:39] AND THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL THAT CAN TAKE
[1:20:41] IT AWAY. I WONDER HOW MANY CAN SAY THAT
[1:20:43] TONIGHT. I MADE MY CONFESSION AND I
[1:20:45] BELIEVE IT WITH MY HEART and there ain't
[1:20:47] no devil that can take it away.
[1:20:50] But a man said, "Now because of that,"
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; he said, "Now you're standing completely
[1:20:55] justified." Hallelujah.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Well, that make a old country boy want
[1:20:59] to dance. He said, "You're standing
[1:21:01] completely justified as though you never
[1:21:03] did it at the beginning." Said, "This is
[1:21:05] my message to the church now. You are
[1:21:08] standing if you're listen if you're
[1:21:10] standing on God's word and with God's
[1:21:13] word every amen every jot every tit
[1:21:16] you're standing complete justified like
[1:21:18] you never did it in the first place
[1:21:20] justified. Why? Why are you justified?
[1:21:23] Because you're standing on God's word.
[1:21:25] He said you are the pure, virtuous,
[1:21:27] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:21:29] God. Every man and woman that's born of
[1:21:31] the spirit of God and washed the blood
[1:21:33] of Jesus Christ and believes every word
[1:21:35] of God, he stands as though he never
[1:21:39] sinned in the first place, you are
[1:21:41] perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:44] Now, brother Ben, not only are we going,
[1:21:46] not only do we have a message TO SPEAK,
[1:21:48] BUT WE'VE GOT A PLACE TO STAND. I'm
[1:21:50] standing by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:52] GOD HAS GIVEN US A platform to speak the
[1:21:55] testimony OF JESUS CHRIST. HOW DO YOU
[1:21:57] SPEAK LIFE ANYHOW? IT'S BECAUSE THAT
[1:22:00] LIFE HAS CAME DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF ME
[1:22:02] AND IT'S TRANSFORMED ME. AND WHAT USED
[1:22:04] TO BE DEAD HAS COME ALIVE. WHAT USED TO
[1:22:07] BE LOST HAS BEEN SAVED. WHAT USED TO BE
[1:22:09] SICK HAS BEEN MADE WELL.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not standing on my own merit, but
[1:22:14] I'm standing on the blood of Jesus
[1:22:17] Christ. So, now we stand as though we
[1:22:20] never sin. Now, because we're standing,
[1:22:22] we stand as free men, brother Tom. Free
[1:22:24] men and women standing as children of
[1:22:26] God. standing as redeemed saints of God
[1:22:30] as the music players want to come. See,
[1:22:33] it matters where you stand. You can't
[1:22:35] stand on your own merit, brother David.
[1:22:37] Your own righteousness, it you couldn't
[1:22:39] stand on that. We couldn't stand on our
[1:22:42] own efforts. But now we have a place to
[1:22:44] stand, a platform to speak from. And on
[1:22:49] that platform, Brother Joe, you have a
[1:22:51] right to speak.
[1:22:53] Isn't that right? You know what the
[1:22:54] devil does? He tries to take that
[1:22:56] testimony out of your life.
[1:22:59] Friends, let me tell you, by the blood
[1:23:01] of Jesus Christ, he gave you a place to
[1:23:05] be able to testify, to go and speak,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; place to stand on, to tell what God has
[1:23:10] done for your life. Friends, nobody
[1:23:13] wants to hear you preach if you don't
[1:23:15] live the testimony that you're
[1:23:17] preaching.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to hear you sing if you
[1:23:20] don't live the testimony that you're
[1:23:22] singing about.
[1:23:23] said, "But when you put it under the
[1:23:25] blood, then it gives you a platform to
[1:23:28] stand and speak. It gives you a platform
[1:23:31] to stand and sing because my sins have
[1:23:35] been put under the blood of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ." He's given us a place to say,
[1:23:40] "I've been justified."
[1:23:42] Oh, friends, you ain't got a you ain't
[1:23:45] got a long enough night for me to tell
[1:23:46] you all the things I've done wrong. You
[1:23:49] do you don't have enough enough books. I
[1:23:51] I could go all day of all the things I
[1:23:54] thought, all the things went through my
[1:23:55] [music] mind. You You ain't got enough
[1:23:57] time.
[1:23:59] We're not looking at our own marriage.
[1:24:00] Quit looking at yourself.
[1:24:02] You're ugly.
[1:24:05] Quit looking at yourself.
[1:24:08] Think of it. Our our past, it's ugly.
[1:24:12] You're never going to find anything
[1:24:13] beautiful in it. It's just ugly. We have
[1:24:15] an ugly past.
[1:24:18] But we have something else to look to.
[1:24:20] Amen. The mirror of his word. He said,
[1:24:23] "If you'll stand on his word, you stand
[1:24:26] justified as though you never sinned in
[1:24:28] the first place." I don't know about
[1:24:30] you, but if I was standing here [music]
[1:24:33] and you had a word from the Lord that
[1:24:34] says, "If you'll just stand here, you
[1:24:36] can stand justified. I'd just step on
[1:24:38] over here.
[1:24:40] I don't want to stand over there where I
[1:24:41] was lost and filled with sin and oh I my
[1:24:46] my testimony is ruined but let me just
[1:24:49] as easy as you stepped over into that
[1:24:51] you can just step right back over here
[1:24:53] under the blood of Jesus. I want you to
[1:24:55] stand to your feet this evening. [music]
[1:24:58] I wonder how many say God give me a
[1:25:00] platform to speak from.
[1:25:04] See, on that platform, you have a right
[1:25:05] to to speak, to testify,
[1:25:09] to sing, to preach, to to be a true
[1:25:12] witness. He's given us a place to stand.
[1:25:18] When we come tonight,
[1:25:20] we just come to serve the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:23] Amen. How many's thankful of that
[1:25:24] tonight?

[1:30:09] Shine through the shadows.
[1:30:13] burn like a fire.
[1:30:15] [singing and music]
[1:30:18] Amen. I wonder how many tonight as you
[1:30:21] bow your heads
[1:30:23] say, "Brother Matt, I pray you'd
[1:30:24] remember me." Amen. That God would give
[1:30:27] us a place to stand.
[1:30:29] And it ain't by our own merit or
[1:30:31] efforts, but God's given us a place to
[1:30:34] stand. And maybe the devil's done
[1:30:35] something.
[1:30:37] He just brings things in your testimony
[1:30:39] and brings so much condemnation in your
[1:30:42] life that you can't even go do the
[1:30:44] commission that God gave you. How can I
[1:30:46] go stand and speak? I've lost my place
[1:30:48] to stand from or I've lost my voice or
[1:30:50] I've lost my zeal to go and I just pray
[1:30:53] that God would come and restore it.
[1:30:56] You realize that [music] Satan's doing
[1:30:57] all he can to rob you of your testimony.
[1:31:01] Maybe you've had a misstep, but God is a
[1:31:04] merciful God this this evening. Say,
[1:31:07] "Lord, I pray pray you'd remember me.
[1:31:09] God bless you, brothers, sisters, God
[1:31:11] bless you." Amen. Gracious heavenly
[1:31:13] father.
[1:31:15] Lord, we just thank you tonight for your
[1:31:17] spirit, Lord. God, that you would come
[1:31:20] among your children and speak to us in
[1:31:23] the way that you do, Lord. God that
[1:31:26] minister an angel Lord that's ministered
[1:31:28] to our hearts and God that that convicts
[1:31:32] us Lord and God we just ask you tonight
[1:31:35] Lord God that you would restore all
[1:31:39] things Lord every hand that's raised and
[1:31:41] Lord I pray Lord that you'd restore
[1:31:44] their zeal to go and Lord maybe there's
[1:31:48] something in their life or some in our
[1:31:51] testimony Lord that Satan has put some
[1:31:54] trap there Lord to
[1:31:57] cause us to seek after the praise of
[1:31:59] [music] men and all these things, Lord.
[1:32:01] But we just ask you, God, that you'd be
[1:32:03] merciful to us [music] tonight, God. May
[1:32:06] we just come to worship you, Lord, and
[1:32:08] fall down at your feet. And God, may you
[1:32:10] have mercy upon each one, Lord. Forgive
[1:32:12] us of our sins and our mistakes and
[1:32:15] failures.
[1:32:16] God, that [music] that platform to speak
[1:32:18] from, Lord, would be restored, God. That
[1:32:22] we could stand upon the word of God and
[1:32:24] fulfill the commission that you've given
[1:32:26] us in our life, Lord. God, and I pray
[1:32:30] that you would give them the courage to
[1:32:32] speak, Lord. The voice that you've given
[1:32:34] us, [music] the voice of the bride of
[1:32:36] Jesus Christ, Lord, I pray that you
[1:32:37] would give her the encourage, Lord, and
[1:32:40] and the words to be able to say. Lord,
[1:32:43] we thank you for it now in [music] the
[1:32:44] name of Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[1:32:53] Your name is light.
[1:32:58] Oh,
[1:32:59] break [music and singing] every
[1:33:00] stronghold.
[1:33:02] Shine through the shadows.
[1:33:06] Burn light.
[1:33:08] All cuz your name is power tonight.
[1:33:12] Oh, your [singing] name is power.
[1:33:16] Your name is [music] healing.
[1:33:19] Your name is life.
[1:33:25] Oh, break [singing and music] every
[1:33:26] stronghold.
[1:33:29] Shine through the shadows.
[1:33:32] Burn like a [singing] fire.
[1:33:41] I love I love him. I love him. I mean,
[1:33:44] he was talking about just
[1:33:47] worshiping him with nothing
[1:33:50] in return.
[1:33:52] If you had nothing in return, [music]
[1:33:53] but would you still worship him? And the
[1:33:56] song came to my mind while he was
[1:33:58] singing this or while he was saying
[1:34:00] that.
[1:34:02] And it says, "I love him because he
[1:34:04] first loved me and he purchased my
[1:34:08] salvation."
[1:34:10] So I I just want to sing this song right
[1:34:12] before we go. Let's just sing this just
[1:34:16] let's just put everything aside.

[1:35:56] tree. Oh, just once more now without the
[1:35:58] music.
[1:36:00] And
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; all sing it to him now.
[1:36:46] Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:36:49] Lord, we truly say that we love you,
[1:36:51] Father.
[1:36:53] Lord, for what you've done for us,
[1:36:55] Father.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've provided us a platform for
[1:36:59] us to stand on, Father, through your
[1:37:01] shed blood, Lord.
[1:37:03] Lord, we heard tonight all we have to do
[1:37:05] is just speak your name and accept it,
[1:37:07] Father.
[1:37:08] We can step over onto that line of stand
[1:37:11] on that platform and we'll be justified,
[1:37:13] Father.
[1:37:15] Lord, we thank you for a provided way
[1:37:17] you've given us, Father.
[1:37:19] Lord, we thank you for a call,
[1:37:22] Lord, but even greater, Father. Even
[1:37:24] more thankful, worship. Thankful that
[1:37:26] you place something in us to respond to
[1:37:28] that call, oh God. And as we respond to
[1:37:32] that call, Lord, I pray that we would
[1:37:34] hear the word from our pastor. Father,
[1:37:37] now it's our turn to go and speak,
[1:37:39] Father. May we not stay and pray,
[1:37:42] Father, but may we pray and go and speak
[1:37:44] this message, Lord. [music] Declare it
[1:37:46] to everyone we come in contact with, our
[1:37:49] neighbors, our friends.
[1:37:52] Lord, may we share [music] with them the
[1:37:53] goodness of God. Oh, Lord. And may we
[1:37:55] not just share it with them, Father, but
[1:37:57] may we live it in front of them, Lord. I
[1:38:00] pray you would just be with us now,
[1:38:02] Father, as we would depart, watch over
[1:38:04] each one, Lord, as we would go to our
[1:38:06] places of home. Father, I pray you would
[1:38:08] just bless our pastor, Father, for
[1:38:10] pouring out his heart, Lord, speaking
[1:38:12] truth to us tonight. Lord, I pray you
[1:38:15] just be with each one. Be with our
[1:38:16] brother Andrew as he travels now.
[1:38:18] Father, may you be with him this weekend
[1:38:20] in the meetings, as he ministers,
[1:38:22] Father, may you give him strength,
[1:38:23] Father, [music] be with each one, lo,
[1:38:26] Lord, those that may be homesick
[1:38:27] tonight. May you just touch their
[1:38:28] bodies, Lord. I pray you would just be
[1:38:32] with us, Father. May Lord may we once
[1:38:35] more hear that call Lord go and tell
[1:38:38] Father may we follow that commission
[1:38:40] Lord be with each one Father we just
[1:38:42] love you and thank you in Jesus [music]
[1:38:44] name I pray. Amen. Give
[1:38:49] I want to live
[1:38:53] the [music] way
[1:38:56] he want. Oh, you're dismissed tonight.
[1:39:00] I want to give [singing and music]
[1:39:04] until there's just no
[1:39:07] [music and singing] more to give. I want
[1:39:11] to love.
[1:39:14] Love till there's [music]
[1:39:17] just no [singing]
[1:39:19] more love. For I could never
[1:39:24] ever [singing] out love the Lord.
[1:39:31] I want to live
[1:39:34] the way
[1:39:37] he wants me to live.
[1:39:41] I want to give [music]
[1:39:44] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:39:51] want to [singing] love
[1:39:55] love till there's just
[1:39:57] [singing and music] no more love. For I
[1:40:02] could never
[1:40:04] ever out [music] love the Lord.
[1:40:11] I want to live
[1:40:14] the way
[1:40:17] he wants me to live.
[1:40:21] I want to give [music]
[1:40:24] unto you.
