[48:04] moment to turn there Matthew the 4th
[48:06] chapter 13th verse and I just want to uh
[48:10] make a quick announcement as you're
[48:11] turning brother uh Andrew I announced

[48:17] ago uh that they were trying to get
[48:19] everything moved uh in October about or
[48:22] Middle October sometime be a few weeks
[48:24] um but they had a little bit of uh
[48:26] change of plans and a Time window that

[48:42] and so um just excited about our friends
[48:46] being able to come and spend the time
[48:47] serving the lord with us amen so we want
[48:50] to read from Matthew the 4th chapter and
[48:52] the 13th verse and we'll read down
[48:53] through the 17th verse the Bible says
[48:55] and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt
[48:57] in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast
[49:00] in the borders of zabulon and neth Alum
[49:03] that it might be fulfilled which was
[49:05] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the
[49:08] land of Zebulon and the land of nephalem
[49:11] by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan
[49:14] Galilee of the Gentiles the people which
[49:17] sat in darkness saw great light and to
[49:20] them which sat in the region and the
[49:22] shadow of death light is sprung up or
[49:25] light is sprung up
[49:27] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[49:30] to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[49:33] is at hand I also want to read from
[49:35] Matthew the 6th chapter and the 33rd
[49:38] verse give you a moment and then the
[49:40] Bible says but seek ye first the kingdom
[49:42] of God for and his righteousness and all
[49:46] these things shall be added unto you and
[49:50] as you take your seat this morning I'd
[49:51] like to speak on this subject of an
[49:54] established Kingdom seek ye first the
[49:57] kingdom of God and all these things
[49:59] shall be added unto you last Sunday uh
[50:02] we were speaking on an everlasting
[50:04] Kingdom when we had started uh into this
[50:07] uh subject and and we realized that this
[50:09] was a promise that Jesus had made of an
[50:11] oncoming Kingdom and one day that that
[50:13] Kingdom would come and uh that we would
[50:16] see that that great physical Kingdom
[50:18] that Jesus was speaking of and uh John
[50:20] actually wrote about it in Revelations
[50:22] the 21st chapter he said I saw remember
[50:24] in John's Vision he said I saw uh the
[50:27] holy city the New Jerusalem coming down
[50:29] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[50:31] bride adorned for her husband and I
[50:34] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[50:36] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[50:39] and he will dwell with them and they
[50:41] shall be his people and God himself
[50:44] shall be with him and be their God and
[50:46] God shall wipe away all the tears from
[50:48] their eyes and shall be no more death no
[50:51] more sorrow no more crying neither there
[50:54] shall be any more pain for the former
[50:56] things are passed away and he that sat
[50:59] upon the throne said behold I make all
[51:01] things new and he said unto me right for
[51:04] these things are true and faithful so
[51:07] here John writes of this coming Kingdom
[51:09] of this great physical Kingdom and and
[51:11] when he writes of it he's writing after
[51:13] the first Heaven and the first Earth has
[51:15] passed away now we realize that brother
[51:17] B would show us that there would be a
[51:19] time when there was no more sea and so
[51:21] the first Heaven would pass away which
[51:23] what was the first Heavens the first
[51:25] Heavens was the millennium he said it
[51:27] would pass away and then the first Earth
[51:29] which is the earth that we live on it
[51:30] would pass away and and and when it
[51:32] would be gone it would be renovated it
[51:34] would be baptized like it was baptized
[51:36] in the days of Noah and he preached and
[51:38] it was Sanctified by Christ and he
[51:40] sprinkled his blood upon it and it was
[51:41] renovated and and but this time it would
[51:44] come and it would take all of the germs
[51:46] and everything off of it and the
[51:47] renovation at the end time would be a
[51:49] fire baptism that would kill every germ
[51:52] every sickness every disease every filth
[51:54] that was ever upon the Earth it would be
[51:56] destroyed off of the face of the Earth
[51:58] brother Mark that within there would
[52:00] come a new kingdom remember when John
[52:01] wrote about it here would come a city
[52:03] that would come and sit down upon this
[52:05] Earth it would be a great City it would
[52:08] be500 square miles and it would rest
[52:10] upon the Earth this is a literal City
[52:12] this isn't something uh spiritual that
[52:15] isn't something that's Supernatural it's
[52:16] a literal City that God the Creator
[52:19] would set up on the earth you say well
[52:20] how would he do it well the same thing
[52:22] he done this one it's the same God that
[52:24] created the first Earth is the same God
[52:26] God that would clean it over and the
[52:28] same God that would establish it again
[52:30] that great Creator God that made the
[52:32] stars and he made the Sun and he made
[52:34] the moon but this time brother Wesley
[52:36] he's creating a city and in that City
[52:38] would have streets of gold and and the
[52:40] great the great Jasper and all the the
[52:42] great colors and precious stones and the
[52:44] great Gates all of it is created by God
[52:47] this is a literal and a physical place
[52:49] and and and you know you know it doesn't
[52:51] it doesn't matter what takes place in
[52:52] this world I can sit here with a body of
[52:54] Believers and say but I'm Bound for that
[52:56] City how many say that this morning I'm
[52:58] Bound for that City so then but said so
[53:00] then what else matters what what what
[53:02] what does everything else matter anyway
[53:04] because we're Bound for the city he says
[53:06] so if the sun don't shine today well it
[53:08] don't matter cuz I'm Bound for the city
[53:10] If Tomorrow Never Comes well it don't
[53:12] matter cuz I'm Bound for the city
[53:14] because see what difference does it make
[53:16] we have a home a resting place whether
[53:18] you're tired or not tired or whether we
[53:20] we still have a resting place you know
[53:22] people would look at it and they say
[53:23] well brother may that's an old man's
[53:25] dream that's what old people talk about
[53:26] when they ain't got nothing no other
[53:28] promise and they it looks like they're
[53:30] going to face death that's an old man's
[53:31] dream but friend this isn't an old man's
[53:33] dream this is a Bible truth that there's
[53:35] a city a new Heaven and a new Earth
[53:37] that'll come down and the saints of God
[53:39] will dwell in that City how many say
[53:41] Amen to that I I believe that's why
[53:43] Jesus when he talks about this Kingdom
[53:45] he tells us the way to enter into that
[53:47] Kingdom he said I am the way the truth
[53:50] and the life and no man cometh unto the
[53:52] father but by me how many believe that
[53:54] Matthew 16 Jesus tells the disciples
[53:56] this way he said If any man would come
[53:58] after me let him deny himself and take
[54:01] up his cross and follow me so whosoever
[54:03] would save his life shall lose it but
[54:05] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[54:07] shall find it for what is a man profit
[54:10] if he would gain the whole world and
[54:12] lose his own soul but what shall a man
[54:14] give in exchange for his soul for the
[54:16] son of man shall come in the glory of
[54:19] his father with his angels and then he
[54:21] shall reward every man according to his
[54:24] work see he's talking about that great
[54:26] physical Kingdom the son of man will
[54:27] come in the glory of the father and with
[54:30] his angels and in that Kingdom every man
[54:32] would be would be rewarded for his works
[54:35] it was a it was a physical Kingdom but
[54:37] then Jesus would go on to say he said
[54:39] but there is some that are standing here
[54:41] that will not taste death he said until
[54:43] they see the son of man coming in his
[54:46] kingdom so see so now he had talked
[54:48] about the physical Kingdom but now he
[54:50] goes on into this spiritual Kingdom see
[54:52] this word Kingdom in this verse of
[54:54] scripture it come from the Greek the
[54:56] Greek word Balia which meant a kingdom
[54:59] or a sovereignty or a royal power so in
[55:02] other words you could say it like this
[55:03] they would not taste death until they
[55:05] seen the son of man coming in his power
[55:08] so so today in this spiritual Kingdom
[55:11] brother Mark is a kingdom of great power
[55:13] that's what took place in the upper room
[55:15] when they were in there and they were
[55:16] praying and waiting upon the Lord to
[55:18] come remember what he had told them he
[55:20] said you would receive power whenever
[55:23] whenever the Holy Ghost would come upon
[55:25] you so they were waiting on the coming
[55:27] of the Holy Ghost they were waiting on
[55:29] the coming of the power of God and so so
[55:31] when that power came when the Holy Ghost
[55:33] came now the kingdom came when it came
[55:36] it w it came in power so the very power
[55:38] that they had was a was a uh it was the
[55:41] presence of the kingdom of God upon the
[55:43] Earth so so this Kingdom brother Mark
[55:45] here Jesus would show it it would come
[55:47] in a physical form but also before then
[55:49] it would come in a spiritual form so so
[55:52] here we see if a kingdom is going to
[55:54] come spiritually then there has to be a
[55:56] spiritual way to get into it so Jesus
[55:58] would would show us there's a way in
[56:00] order to get into this Kingdom to be a
[56:02] part of the Kingdom see that's why when
[56:03] somebody ask you and say well what
[56:05] denomination do you belong to you say
[56:07] well I don't belong to any denomination
[56:08] well what do you belong to well you can
[56:10] just say it like this I belong to a
[56:12] kingdom how many you ever been asked
[56:13] that question what kind of church do you
[56:15] go to who are you what kind of people
[56:16] are you anyway well the answer is I
[56:18] belong to a kingdom and I you say a
[56:21] kingdom yeah well how do you get into
[56:23] that Kingdom I can tell you what Paul
[56:24] said he said by one spirit we are
[56:26] baptized into one body but said so you
[56:29] can say it like this by one Spirit we're
[56:32] baptized into one kingdom here we are
[56:34] we've been baptized by the spirit of God
[56:36] into the kingdom of God and friends you
[56:38] you can say it like this if that kingdom
[56:40] was in the earth see that there are many
[56:42] that are looking they're trying to find
[56:44] a way to get into this they're trying to
[56:46] they're searching they're seeking after
[56:48] the kingdom of God they're searching for
[56:50] an entrance into the kingdom of God
[56:51] they're searching for for power another
[56:54] there's Nations that are searching for a
[56:56] way to have the upper hand on another
[56:58] Nation but but but but we're looking for
[57:00] this great Kingdom of power it's been
[57:01] sought after since the time that that it
[57:04] was spoke of in the scripture and you
[57:06] know I thought about how that it's such
[57:07] a real thing remember when Abraham was
[57:09] called by God and he told him he said
[57:11] you're going to go into a land it'll be
[57:13] a Strange Land you're going to go into a
[57:15] place and and it'll be a place of
[57:17] inheritance and you're going to be able
[57:18] to receive it and Abraham when he went
[57:21] out seeking this place that God had
[57:23] promised to him the Bible says he went
[57:25] into a strange country sister Joy he
[57:27] went into a strange country and he was
[57:29] searching and and trying to find the
[57:31] place that God had called him to and it
[57:33] was so real to him even though that God
[57:36] had called him there was nothing
[57:37] physical out there brother Mark there
[57:38] wasn't a foundation there wasn't there
[57:40] wasn't a gate there wasn't a great wall
[57:42] there was there was no great there was
[57:43] no great entrance there was no sign out
[57:46] there that would say this is the place
[57:47] of the kingdom of God but he walked out
[57:49] into a strange country and the Bible
[57:51] said he walked by faith and listen what
[57:53] Paul said he said he looked for a city
[57:55] that had foundations whose Builder and
[57:58] maker was God he believed in the promise
[58:00] of God so much brother Mark that he was
[58:02] seeking a city that had a literal
[58:04] Foundation see it wasn't something that
[58:06] was just some myth unto him but the
[58:08] promise of God was real to him and the
[58:11] promise it was so real that he went into
[58:13] a strange country looking for something
[58:15] that had a foundation he was looking for
[58:17] something that had a wall he was looking
[58:18] for something that wasn't built by the
[58:20] hands of men but it was built by the
[58:22] hands of God I thought my if that would
[58:24] do that way with Abraham in the natural
[58:26] what all what ought it to do to us in
[58:28] the spiritual for we have came out of
[58:30] this world and been called by God into
[58:33] this spiritual Place we've been called
[58:35] brother Mark out of the out of what the
[58:36] world calls normal and out of what the
[58:38] church World calls normal and sometimes
[58:40] it may be a strange place but here we've
[58:42] came into a strange country and and into
[58:45] things that we didn't even understand
[58:47] but God had led us by faith into this
[58:49] land looking for a city brother Mark a
[58:52] literal place that God could come and
[58:54] dwell in the hearts of believers let me
[58:56] tell you what Jesus said when he talked
[58:58] about this Kingdom he began to speak
[59:00] about it there was those that believed
[59:01] him and there was those that mocked him
[59:03] and those that made fun of it you know
[59:05] that there was those say well I can't
[59:06] see anything so why would I believe
[59:08] anything like that but Jesus listen even
[59:11] when he would talk about it that the
[59:12] Pharisees would ask like this they said
[59:14] well when will the kingdom of God come
[59:17] here he is talking about the coming of a
[59:19] kingdom they said when should the
[59:20] kingdom of God come and Jesus said he
[59:22] said the kingdom of God don't come with
[59:24] observation so neither can you say here
[59:26] it is or there it is for behold the
[59:29] kingdom of God is within you brother
[59:32] manam says see so here we are we are his
[59:34] kingdom people that are professing that
[59:37] this world is not our home I wonder how
[59:39] many of those are here this morning
[59:40] we're the kingdom people that are
[59:42] professing that this world is not our
[59:44] home and we're looking for the coming of
[59:47] the king to set up his kingdom oh I
[59:49] don't know about you but that's what
[59:50] we're doing this morning I'm looking for
[59:52] the King of Kings to come and establish
[59:55] that great king Kingdom upon this Earth
[59:57] I don't know about you but I plan to be
[59:59] there that day whenever the king of
[1:00:01] glory comes in when the when that great
[1:00:03] Kingdom that physical kingdom is
[1:00:05] established upon this Earth it ain't a
[1:00:07] myth it's not just some fairy tale it
[1:00:09] ain't something just to make you feel
[1:00:10] good when you're at an old age and
[1:00:12] looking to passing over but it's the
[1:00:14] truth that come out of God's word the
[1:00:16] same God that created this world is the
[1:00:18] same God that said there'll be a new
[1:00:20] Heaven and a new Earth and upon that
[1:00:22] Earth shall come this great City and the
[1:00:24] Believers the Saints will inhabit the
[1:00:26] city thereof so today here we are that
[1:00:29] Heavenly Kingdom brother Wesley even
[1:00:32] though it would come in the physical but
[1:00:33] today that Heavenly kingdom is dwelling
[1:00:35] in the heart of every believer and when
[1:00:37] we look around I see representatives of
[1:00:40] that Kingdom we're ambassadors of the
[1:00:42] kingdom of God well and I got news for
[1:00:44] you not only am an ambassador of the
[1:00:46] kingdom of God brother Wesley but I'm
[1:00:48] not here to visit I'm not here as a
[1:00:50] part-timer I'm not in this Kingdom as
[1:00:52] just somebody that's coming as a tourist
[1:00:54] but I've tooken up permanent residence
[1:00:56] in the kingdom of God I I made it my
[1:00:59] permanent home in other words I have a
[1:01:00] lifetime membership to the kingdom of
[1:01:03] God and there ain't nothing the devil
[1:01:04] can do to take me away from it I think
[1:01:06] what a powerful thought this is this
[1:01:08] morning when you look around look around
[1:01:11] this building if you could see past the
[1:01:12] walls in this building and you could see
[1:01:14] past the flaws and the and the in the in
[1:01:16] the construction failures and the in the
[1:01:19] Leaky Roof and the stains on the carpet
[1:01:21] and and you can look past all of that
[1:01:23] and you can look through the eyes of
[1:01:25] Faith you would recognize that we are in
[1:01:27] the presence of a Heavenly Kingdom see
[1:01:29] when you look around this morning all
[1:01:31] you see is the natural you see the same
[1:01:33] piano you see the same building you see
[1:01:35] the same people but if you could ever
[1:01:36] look through the eyes of Faith you would
[1:01:38] realize that we're not just sitting in a
[1:01:39] building to be sitting in a building
[1:01:41] we're not just setting in the middle of
[1:01:43] these four walls but we're sitting in
[1:01:45] the presence of a Heavenly Kingdom and
[1:01:47] here in this Kingdom brother Mark that's
[1:01:48] why whenever you start to pray and you
[1:01:50] start to sing songs that the atmosphere
[1:01:53] begins to change in the room you say
[1:01:55] what is it atmosphere that is changing
[1:01:57] is the influence of another kingdom how
[1:01:59] many have you ever felt bad and you get
[1:02:01] to pray and all of a sudden the
[1:02:03] atmosphere begins to change or or you
[1:02:05] start singing a song and you know you're
[1:02:06] kind of down in the dumps and driving
[1:02:08] down the road and you start singing a
[1:02:10] song and all of a sudden the atmosphere
[1:02:12] in the car begins to change and you
[1:02:14] start weeping or maybe with joy and you
[1:02:16] clap your hands what's happening it's
[1:02:18] the influence of another kingdom oh
[1:02:20] don't you see it it's the presence of
[1:02:22] another kingdom this is what God is
[1:02:24] calling us into to get our minds and our
[1:02:26] our hearts out of this world and enter
[1:02:28] into this place that God can have
[1:02:30] communion with you oh let me tell you
[1:02:32] friends there's room at the table this
[1:02:33] morning the doors are open this morning
[1:02:36] to a Heavenly Kingdom a spiritual
[1:02:38] Kingdom to call a people out of this
[1:02:40] natural realm oh if I could this morning
[1:02:43] I would take your eyes and your mind
[1:02:45] away from the natural things if I could
[1:02:47] I'd bring you to another plane that you
[1:02:49] could see past the things of the natural
[1:02:51] and see past the flaws and past the
[1:02:53] failures into this heavenly Kingdom oh
[1:02:55] friends if you could look at the at at
[1:02:57] the building that way and you could look
[1:02:59] at the world that way then how ought we
[1:03:01] ought to look at one another we could
[1:03:02] look at each other but a mark and we
[1:03:04] could see past the flaws of a man and I
[1:03:07] I could see past the mistakes of a man
[1:03:09] and the stains that are upon a person's
[1:03:11] life and realize that that in order to
[1:03:13] see spiritual things that you have to
[1:03:15] look past natural things and it ain't
[1:03:17] just in the building but but it's the
[1:03:19] same way with every one of us if you
[1:03:21] could look through a spiritual eye and
[1:03:23] pass that veil of Flesh you would see
[1:03:25] that your sitting today among royalty
[1:03:28] the Bride of Jesus Christ the people
[1:03:30] that are called by God brother the
[1:03:32] Travis it ain't just some ordinary
[1:03:33] person the lady sitting by you she's not
[1:03:36] just another lady off the street the man
[1:03:38] sitting by you he's not just another man
[1:03:40] in this world but these are those that
[1:03:42] were called of God these are the
[1:03:43] purchase of the possession of the blood
[1:03:46] of Jesus Christ oh how that ought to
[1:03:48] make us feel it's the ones that he went
[1:03:50] up calvary's cross and gave his own
[1:03:52] blood for he shed his blood for him oh
[1:03:55] my I thank God this morning if we could
[1:03:57] look past the veil of Flesh and see one
[1:03:59] another it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] oh can't you see it we're sitting among
[1:04:03] royalty you say but M what are you
[1:04:05] trying to do I'm trying to get our minds
[1:04:07] out of this world just for a few minutes
[1:04:09] and to recognize the presence of the
[1:04:11] kingdom of God that is Among Us and the
[1:04:13] people that you're sitting next to the
[1:04:15] Bride of Jesus Christ the purchased of
[1:04:18] God not only are we in the presence of
[1:04:20] one another brother Wesley but we're in
[1:04:22] the presence of the king of kings you
[1:04:25] see what it does it calls our attention
[1:04:26] that we don't just come here it Ain it
[1:04:29] ain't just a social a social Gathering
[1:04:31] but we come to have communion with the
[1:04:33] King of Kings we come to get ourselves
[1:04:35] out of you realize what a what it takes
[1:04:37] brother Andrew was preaching the other
[1:04:39] day he said the kingdom has to be
[1:04:41] preached and then it has to be pressed
[1:04:42] into so in other words there's somebody
[1:04:45] that'll come and preach it and somebody
[1:04:47] that'll press into it you know what it
[1:04:48] means to press to press means to apply
[1:04:50] pressure or to push against something so
[1:04:54] if the Bible says that we have to press
[1:04:56] into it Brother David you know what that
[1:04:57] means with the law of physics the law of
[1:04:59] physics tells us that we can't even use
[1:05:01] the word press unless there's some other
[1:05:04] force that we're pressing against it
[1:05:06] wouldn't even be the word press unless
[1:05:08] there was a force or a resistance or
[1:05:10] something that you could press against
[1:05:11] you realize that's what we're doing
[1:05:13] today is we're pressing against an
[1:05:15] unseen force and that Force wants to
[1:05:17] keep you out of the kingdom of God it
[1:05:20] wants to keep you out of the atmosphere
[1:05:22] where God can move it wants to keep you
[1:05:24] out of the atmosphere of the
[1:05:26] supernatural where where God where the
[1:05:28] where the the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:29] can come into a building again and
[1:05:32] miracles take place and Supernatural
[1:05:34] things happen and people give their
[1:05:36] heart to God and God discerns the the
[1:05:38] hearts of of people and helps them and
[1:05:40] corrects them and and and grows them and
[1:05:42] that that that enemy that great pressure
[1:05:44] in this age is keeping you out of that
[1:05:46] atmosphere so brother Andrew preached
[1:05:48] that message so we're pressing against
[1:05:50] an unseen Force cuz it wants to keep us
[1:05:53] out of the Kingdom wants to keep you
[1:05:55] from having having Liberty it wants to
[1:05:57] keep you from from being able to speak
[1:05:58] your heart and speak the truth of the
[1:06:00] word it wants to keep you from praying
[1:06:02] hello somebody am I the only one in here
[1:06:04] it wants to keep you from shouting it
[1:06:05] wants to keep you from clapping don't
[1:06:07] let me offend you I'm just preaching the
[1:06:08] gospel it wants to keep you from
[1:06:10] clapping it wants to keep you from
[1:06:12] saying amen it wants to keep your mind
[1:06:14] on the things of the world and away from
[1:06:16] the things of God it's a force that is
[1:06:18] pressing on you to keep you from
[1:06:20] receiving something from God well but
[1:06:22] friends the Bible said but there is a
[1:06:23] people that can press through there's a
[1:06:26] people that'll press through it don't
[1:06:27] matter what the Devil Comes or how hard
[1:06:30] that he comes but I thank God that
[1:06:31] there's somebody there's a body of
[1:06:33] Believers this morning that didn't stay
[1:06:35] up partying too late last night but they
[1:06:37] come to the house of God to press
[1:06:39] through the pressures of the enemy into
[1:06:41] the atmosphere of the kingdom of God why
[1:06:44] are we pressing through butar because we
[1:06:46] want to be in the presence of the king
[1:06:48] why are we why are we pressing through
[1:06:50] we want to see him we want to be in his
[1:06:51] midst and be in his presence this
[1:06:53] morning amen think about that brother
[1:06:56] Brown tells the story of of when he went
[1:06:58] up to Canada and brother bter was there
[1:07:01] remember they went to see the King
[1:07:02] George when he came through Vancouver
[1:07:04] but bter said when I went the king came
[1:07:07] by he said he was here he was telling me
[1:07:09] when the king came down the street he
[1:07:11] said he was such a gallant man that
[1:07:12] brother Baxter went over and he began to
[1:07:15] cry and weep whenever the king and and
[1:07:17] the queen came by this great Entourage
[1:07:19] he said all the Canadians was gathered
[1:07:21] there and had their Flags out waving and
[1:07:23] brother Baxter went over the side he
[1:07:24] said he was just weeping when with all
[1:07:25] his heart and he asked him he said well
[1:07:27] why was you crying he said well well I
[1:07:29] couldn't help it he said because I know
[1:07:31] all the pain and things that he's going
[1:07:32] through and here the King was was sick
[1:07:34] in his body had multiple therosis had
[1:07:36] stomach trouble and here why he was
[1:07:38] going through that great pain but but he
[1:07:40] still yet went through the parade and he
[1:07:41] waved at everybody and he and he and he
[1:07:43] greeted everybody and he said see
[1:07:45] whenever he came by he said I couldn't
[1:07:47] do nothing but weep but B said well why
[1:07:49] was you weeping he said because our King
[1:07:50] was passing by see and when he passed by
[1:07:53] it represented the freedom of our
[1:07:55] country it represented the liberty of
[1:07:57] our country it was it was the one it was
[1:08:00] the monarchy that defended our way of
[1:08:02] life said so there was some in in their
[1:08:04] heart they were they they love the the
[1:08:07] the monarchy that had came by he said I
[1:08:09] thought my he said that may be that way
[1:08:11] that when the when the king came by and
[1:08:13] those beautiful people and subjects and
[1:08:15] how they wept just because he was
[1:08:16] passing by but I thought if it would
[1:08:18] make a Canadian Weep For Joy when the
[1:08:20] king rode by then what will it be when
[1:08:22] King Jesus comes by the king of Heaven
[1:08:25] and the king of Earth friends we're
[1:08:27] looking to see the King of Kings when we
[1:08:30] come in the house of God you don't come
[1:08:32] to see me God forbid but come to see the
[1:08:34] King of Kings come to see King Jesus
[1:08:37] brother Mar to make an atmosphere that
[1:08:38] the king could come by to enter into
[1:08:40] this place he say see we want to see the
[1:08:43] king but that ain't all Brother David
[1:08:44] not only do we want to see the king but
[1:08:46] remember there was a little girl that
[1:08:48] was there crying at at the end of the
[1:08:50] the parade and the teachers went into
[1:08:52] class and they came back and and and how
[1:08:54] this little girl she she was she was
[1:08:56] missing and so they went out looking for
[1:08:57] her and they found her out there had her
[1:08:59] little Canadian flag or her British flag
[1:09:02] and so they went out and and and they
[1:09:03] they told her you got to come back in
[1:09:05] and she was just crying said well what's
[1:09:06] the matter with you honey didn't you
[1:09:08] didn't you get to stand out there with
[1:09:10] all the other kids she said yeah I did
[1:09:12] she said well didn't you get to raise
[1:09:13] your flag like everybody else she said
[1:09:15] yeah I raised my flag and you know see
[1:09:18] that flag it was a display of loyalty
[1:09:21] she said yeah I got to raise my flag
[1:09:22] like everybody else she said well didn't
[1:09:24] you didn't you see the King she said
[1:09:26] yeah I saw him she said well then why
[1:09:27] are you crying she said it wasn't that I
[1:09:30] didn't get to see the king she said I
[1:09:32] saw the king but I'm so little I don't
[1:09:34] think the king saw me but said isn't
[1:09:37] that that way he said but that may be
[1:09:38] that way with the natural King but with
[1:09:40] King Jesus it's never that way he said
[1:09:43] see it no matter how little you are or
[1:09:45] what little you do he records everything
[1:09:47] you do he knows all about you whether
[1:09:50] you're big or whether you're little he
[1:09:51] knows all about it it's recorded in his
[1:09:53] book oh don't you realize friends that
[1:09:55] King Jesus sees you it don't matter how
[1:09:58] he sees every wave that that sign of
[1:10:01] loyalty when you wave your hand he sees
[1:10:03] every wave every time you raise your
[1:10:05] hand you say Lord I love you he sees
[1:10:07] every wave he sees every flag every
[1:10:09] Banner that's lifted King Jesus sees it
[1:10:11] he hears every voice that cries out
[1:10:14] Glory unto his name he hears every
[1:10:16] Hallelujah he hears every amen there
[1:10:18] ain't nothing little that you can do
[1:10:20] that King Jesus don't see so we lift our
[1:10:23] hearts this morning we lift our voices
[1:10:26] we lift our our Banner we raise our flag
[1:10:28] in loyalty to King Jesus how many how
[1:10:30] many can do that this morning and say
[1:10:32] Lord I just want to lift my my flag to
[1:10:34] you Lord I want to let you know I'm
[1:10:35] loyal I ain't loyal to a man I'm not
[1:10:38] loyal to a church but I'm loyal to King
[1:10:40] Jesus I'm not loyal to the devil don't
[1:10:42] you realize that you oh you say well
[1:10:44] well Satan wants to do everything he can
[1:10:45] to keep your hand down but I thank God
[1:10:47] there's somebody that'll press past our
[1:10:49] own thoughts this morning and say Lord
[1:10:51] but I'm loyal to you this morning I want
[1:10:53] to display my loyalty to King Jesus oh
[1:10:57] my you don't feel like you don't feel
[1:10:59] like a good subject sometimes to be a
[1:11:01] part of this great Kingdom sometimes we
[1:11:03] feel like we're the least in the kingdom
[1:11:05] of God you know sometimes you say well I
[1:11:08] ain't the best best preacher and I ain't
[1:11:10] the best singer I'm not I'm not the best
[1:11:12] one see but you realize that because we
[1:11:15] feel that way you realize that the
[1:11:16] greatness in the kingdom of God is not
[1:11:18] measured the way it is in the Kingdom of
[1:11:20] the world can I just take a minute on
[1:11:22] this to be great in the kingdom of God
[1:11:24] don't mean the the same thing as it does
[1:11:26] to be great in the Kingdom of the world
[1:11:28] see it's actually it's actually
[1:11:30] backwards it's different than the
[1:11:31] worldly Kingdom see the the great ones
[1:11:33] in this earth they're noted for exalting
[1:11:36] themselves and exercising their power
[1:11:38] and dominion and their strength and mind
[1:11:40] that's what makes a a great one in other
[1:11:42] words they they exercise dominion over
[1:11:44] those that they have control over so see
[1:11:46] that's the the greatness in the Kingdom
[1:11:48] of the world remember remember in the
[1:11:50] Bible that that James and John the the
[1:11:52] sons of Zebedee that came and their
[1:11:53] mother to Jesus and said granted that we
[1:11:55] would sit one on thy right hand and one
[1:11:57] on the other on their left hand when we
[1:11:59] get into glory and Jesus said you know
[1:12:01] not what you ask he said see you shall
[1:12:03] indeed drink of the cup I drink of and
[1:12:05] with baptism that I am baptized you
[1:12:06] shall be baptized but to sit on my right
[1:12:09] hand and on my left is not mine to give
[1:12:11] but it shall be given to them of whom it
[1:12:13] is prepared so notice what Jesus does is
[1:12:16] he shows us after this he starts showing
[1:12:18] the kingdoms of the world and how the
[1:12:20] kingdom of the world is he said see they
[1:12:23] which are accounted to rule over the G
[1:12:25] Gentiles they exercise their lordship
[1:12:27] over them and their great ones exercise
[1:12:30] their Authority on them but it shall not
[1:12:33] be so she he says so shall it not be
[1:12:36] among you for whosoever will be great
[1:12:38] among you will be your minister or your
[1:12:40] servant he said in other words see so
[1:12:42] whoever whosoever of you will be the
[1:12:44] chiefest shall be the servant of all so
[1:12:47] in order to be great in the kingdom of
[1:12:48] God requires that you be a servant one
[1:12:51] to another listen what Jesus I'm just
[1:12:53] telling you what Jesus said he said see
[1:12:55] and the son of man came not to be
[1:12:57] ministered or not to be served unto but
[1:12:59] to serve another he said he gave his
[1:13:01] life and a ransom for many Mark the 10th
[1:13:04] chapter he said see even as the son of
[1:13:05] man he came not to have services
[1:13:07] rendered unto him but he came that he
[1:13:09] might serve and give his life as a
[1:13:11] ransom or instead of many so see in the
[1:13:14] Heavenly Kingdom brother wesle the life
[1:13:16] in the kingdom of God it don't operate
[1:13:18] the way the world it's the opposite of
[1:13:20] the kingdom of the world so it don't so
[1:13:22] it's not it's not uh uh it's it's more
[1:13:24] obvious then in the matters of power and
[1:13:26] Leadership see Jesus said those who want
[1:13:28] to be great in God's kingdom May achieve
[1:13:30] that but not by the world's methods so
[1:13:33] if you want to be great in the kingdom
[1:13:34] of God you wanton you're going to have
[1:13:35] to redefine what greatness is so you can
[1:13:38] achieve greatness but only by defining
[1:13:40] greatness the way Jesus does and that's
[1:13:42] by serving others and not yourself so
[1:13:45] see being a servant to one another makes
[1:13:47] you great in the kingdom of God so even
[1:13:49] when you don't feel great and you feel
[1:13:51] little and you say brother you know I I
[1:13:53] don't do a whole lot and there ain't a
[1:13:54] lot ask to me but the great ones in the
[1:13:56] kingdom of God are not are not those
[1:13:58] that that do so much or establish
[1:14:00] themselves so much but it's those that
[1:14:02] are willing to serve others isn't that a
[1:14:04] good principle this morning to find our
[1:14:06] our place in God's Kingdom so see but
[1:14:09] with this Kingdom let me get back to my
[1:14:10] message with this kingdom comes a great
[1:14:12] power and an authority but the W you see
[1:14:15] you see we're the heart of a true
[1:14:16] servant we possess the power of God by
[1:14:18] the Holy Ghost remember that's what came
[1:14:20] in the book of Acts this is how Paul
[1:14:21] wrote it he said he has delivered us
[1:14:23] from the power of darkness and has
[1:14:25] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:14:27] dear son and right now we reign with
[1:14:30] Christ having dominion over sin over the
[1:14:33] world over the Flesh and the devil
[1:14:35] Church age book showing forth his praise
[1:14:38] and glory and showing forth himself for
[1:14:40] it is Christ in US willing and doing of
[1:14:43] his good pleasure so what we are doing
[1:14:45] brother Mark by the power of the Holy
[1:14:47] Ghost or the or the kingdom of God being
[1:14:50] in US is we're demonstrating that we're
[1:14:52] no longer under the Dominion of Satan
[1:14:54] you say well how do I demonstrate it
[1:14:55] well let me tell you what I saw even in
[1:14:58] this assembly brother Wesley I saw that
[1:15:00] Kingdom power demonstrated I saw Kingdom
[1:15:03] power demonstrated with the laying on
[1:15:05] the hands of the sick and they recovered
[1:15:07] I saw people come up for prayer and that
[1:15:09] Kingdom power demonstrated whenever they
[1:15:11] were in having dizzy spells and God took
[1:15:13] it and brought them back to where the
[1:15:15] dizziness was gone I I saw Kingdom power
[1:15:18] when people come up with back trouble
[1:15:19] and that Kingdom power it took the it
[1:15:21] took back trouble away from them and it
[1:15:23] caused them to be able to walk it walk
[1:15:25] up right I saw that Kingdom power take a
[1:15:27] body that had no pulse and put breath
[1:15:29] back in his life I saw that Kingdom
[1:15:31] power give somebody strength to walk
[1:15:33] when they didn't have the ability to
[1:15:34] walk I saw Kingdom power take blinded
[1:15:37] eyes and open them and give somebody
[1:15:39] sight again I saw Kingdom power discern
[1:15:42] somebody's spirit and tell them the
[1:15:43] things that was wrong with them and what
[1:15:45] God could do to bring them out of it but
[1:15:47] let me tell you my favorite brother
[1:15:48] Markus I saw Kingdom power that would
[1:15:50] give unbelievers the power to believe
[1:15:53] God I saw King om power caused
[1:15:56] unbelievers to take God at his word and
[1:15:58] no longer be an unbelief but they came
[1:16:01] and became a believer of the word word
[1:16:02] of God don't you realize friends that
[1:16:04] we're living in an age of unbelief we're
[1:16:07] living in this great age Paul said he
[1:16:09] said in whom the God of this world has
[1:16:10] blinded the minds of them that believe
[1:16:12] not we're living in an age of unbelief
[1:16:15] but what it takes is it takes a kingdom
[1:16:17] power to come and take you out of this
[1:16:19] Spirit of unbelief and bring you into a
[1:16:21] place of faith into this heavenly
[1:16:23] atmosphere that you can believe in the
[1:16:25] things of God again that you can believe
[1:16:27] in the Supernatural friends I know what
[1:16:29] the devil's trying to do today he's
[1:16:31] trying to take the supernatural out of
[1:16:32] the church he's trying to take the holy
[1:16:34] ghost out of the church he's trying to
[1:16:36] take the move of God out of the church
[1:16:38] but I thank God that there's still
[1:16:39] somebody as long as I have a voice to
[1:16:42] say that the kingdom of God is still
[1:16:44] here and the kingdom of God has still
[1:16:46] got the same power that it's always done
[1:16:49] and if you want to see God move then
[1:16:51] come out of the kingdom of the world and
[1:16:53] get into the kingdom of God
[1:16:55] and see the supernatural see the hand of
[1:16:58] God in your life get out of the
[1:17:00] atmosphere of the world and get into the
[1:17:02] atmosphere of God and allow God to have
[1:17:04] dominion over your life instead of
[1:17:06] letting the devil rule you oh god listen
[1:17:08] friends stop letting the devil rule you
[1:17:10] and Rule you and beat you down with
[1:17:12] cigarettes and beat you down with
[1:17:13] alcohol and beat you down with with
[1:17:15] drugs and and pot and all these things
[1:17:18] that Satan brings on PE you're living
[1:17:20] under the Dominion of Satan but I thank
[1:17:22] God that he's given us a way a way out a
[1:17:25] door an entrance into another kingdom
[1:17:27] that you can look down at the Devil and
[1:17:29] say devil you have no power over me any
[1:17:32] longer I saw Kingdom power yes sir come
[1:17:35] on take people out of unbelief and make
[1:17:37] a Believer out of them I saw a woman one
[1:17:40] time when I was preaching in India and I
[1:17:42] was preaching on doubt being an enemy of
[1:17:44] God and I was telling the testimony of
[1:17:45] how God healed my arm when I was a
[1:17:47] little boy and I told to how that I that
[1:17:49] I always remember rubbing the dirt off
[1:17:51] my broke arm that was that was that was
[1:17:53] the bone was sticking out out of and I
[1:17:55] remember wiping the dirt off of it and I
[1:17:57] was telling that testimony and while I
[1:17:59] was telling it there was a woman sitting
[1:18:01] in the back of the room that for 6 years
[1:18:02] hadn't been able to walk and we're in
[1:18:05] the middle of the preaching of the word
[1:18:07] she literally she took her her little
[1:18:09] hand and she said well Lord if that
[1:18:11] would work for him it would work for me
[1:18:13] and she got up in the middle of that
[1:18:14] meeting and came walking to the front
[1:18:16] right in the middle of the preacher like
[1:18:18] a old scary woman trying to get her
[1:18:20] strength back in her legs because she
[1:18:21] couldn't even walk walking in there
[1:18:23] without somebody carrying her sitting
[1:18:25] her in the back of the room the old
[1:18:26] Pastor got to jump it up and down he
[1:18:27] said brother man don't you see what's
[1:18:29] going on I said no I thought it was just
[1:18:31] a spooky or or some Spirit or something
[1:18:33] I didn't know why she was walking that
[1:18:34] way he said that woman hadn't walked in
[1:18:36] six years she's been paralyzed she got
[1:18:38] hurt in a Rick Shaw accident she came up
[1:18:41] and gave a testimony she said that that
[1:18:44] the Lord had told her in a dream six
[1:18:46] years ago after that she had been in
[1:18:47] this accident here she was a Hindu woman
[1:18:50] didn't even know what Christianity was
[1:18:52] didn't even know who Jesus was but she
[1:18:54] she had a dream and in the dream a man
[1:18:56] told her go to the gospel meeting and
[1:18:58] you'll receive your healing that next
[1:19:00] week she went to the first thing that
[1:19:01] was called a gospel meeting there was a
[1:19:02] Pentecostal church that was having a
[1:19:04] meeting she went over to it well she
[1:19:06] went up for prayer and she didn't get
[1:19:07] healed and so the next time they had a
[1:19:09] gospel meeting she went to that one and
[1:19:11] she went up for prayer and she didn't
[1:19:12] get healed and the next time they had a
[1:19:14] gospel meeting she went to that one and
[1:19:15] she went up for prayer and she didn't
[1:19:17] get healed brother Wesley for six years
[1:19:19] she went and done the very same thing
[1:19:21] and that brother said isn't it a miracle
[1:19:23] that she's able to walk I said said
[1:19:24] brother that ain't even the miracle the
[1:19:26] miracle is that for 6 years she never
[1:19:28] received her healing but she still
[1:19:30] believed God and for six years she could
[1:19:32] have those same symptoms but she still
[1:19:34] believed God the miracle was that she
[1:19:36] was still sitting in a gospel meeting
[1:19:38] waiting on God to to to to fulfill his
[1:19:42] word that's the real Miracle it's the
[1:19:44] Kingdom power brother Wesley that can
[1:19:46] take a person out of unbelief and take
[1:19:49] them into a place of believe it oh don't
[1:19:51] you see it by believing the word it
[1:19:53] releases something in you
[1:19:55] that Satan can't handle here it was a
[1:19:58] woman that just believed the word of God
[1:20:00] and by believing the word her faith came
[1:20:02] to a place in that time of Mercy I can't
[1:20:05] explain it neither can I explain why
[1:20:07] Jesus would walk down and all those sick
[1:20:09] people were laying over by the pool but
[1:20:11] he went over to where one was and he
[1:20:13] said can would you be made whole he said
[1:20:15] I can't be cuz nobody will get out of my
[1:20:17] way every time I try to go some man gets
[1:20:19] in the way but J the very healing that
[1:20:21] he was looking for had came to his
[1:20:23] doorstep neither can I explain why this
[1:20:26] God of Mercy would come that way but
[1:20:29] brother Mark I know it took a person
[1:20:31] that was an unbeliever and it makes a
[1:20:32] Believer out of you see it's Kingdom
[1:20:35] power it's Christ the anointed one
[1:20:38] coming in his power you realize see
[1:20:40] believ in the word of God it it brings
[1:20:42] this power in your life so no wonder
[1:20:45] Satan wants to make you disbelieve the
[1:20:47] word no wonder he brings so many attacks
[1:20:49] on the word and caus you to look at
[1:20:51] those things and and say well I I don't
[1:20:52] know if I can I can believe that why
[1:20:54] because he knows that that that if you
[1:20:56] ever become a believer that it releases
[1:20:57] a power in your life so he tries to keep
[1:21:00] you in unbelief but friends let me tell
[1:21:02] you this morning when that belief comes
[1:21:04] then all of a sudden then that same
[1:21:05] spirit that Christ had it begins to work
[1:21:07] in your life it has Authority it takes
[1:21:10] things out that don't belong there it
[1:21:12] begins to to clean up and you see who
[1:21:15] was it it was Christ you remember when
[1:21:16] he came in his Earthly Ministry in his
[1:21:18] Earthly Ministry they called him what
[1:21:20] the Messiah remember it was Christ the
[1:21:22] anointed one which was called the
[1:21:23] Messiah but said see what is the Messiah
[1:21:26] he said the Messiah is the kingdom of
[1:21:28] God it is the anointed ones them
[1:21:31] Anointed with the same Spirit he was
[1:21:33] anointed with anointed he said see it
[1:21:35] was the kingdom of God remember it was
[1:21:37] the one that they came to when they
[1:21:39] asked of him and they said can I sit at
[1:21:41] thy right hand or at thy left and Jesus
[1:21:44] said can you drink of the cup that I
[1:21:45] drink can you be baptized with the
[1:21:46] baptism I'm baptized they said yes he
[1:21:49] said well you will but the kingdom in
[1:21:51] other words to sit at my right hand or
[1:21:53] my left he said the kingdom is not mine
[1:21:55] to
[1:21:56] give so this is that's what they were
[1:21:58] asking for we want the kingdom we want
[1:22:00] to sit at thy right hand and thy left
[1:22:02] hand we want to sit on the throne so in
[1:22:03] other words he's saying the kingdom is
[1:22:05] not mine to give but said it showed us
[1:22:07] that we we could drink out of the same
[1:22:09] cup of persecution you could be called
[1:22:11] beel whatever it might be you could be
[1:22:13] baptized with the same Spirit he's
[1:22:14] baptized with so if he was called the
[1:22:16] Messiah which he was because he was
[1:22:18] anointed with the Holy Spirit said then
[1:22:21] any church that's Anointed with the same
[1:22:22] holy spirit is a messiah a little or
[1:22:25] smaller God someday when this body is
[1:22:27] resurrected he said I hope beforehand
[1:22:29] that God can get a hold of a bunch of
[1:22:30] people that'll manifest his power in
[1:22:32] every Dimension that it's supposed to be
[1:22:34] in he's the Messiah the anointed one you
[1:22:37] realize what he's trying to get the
[1:22:38] church to is to become that very same
[1:22:40] thing the Messiah the anointed one it is
[1:22:43] the kingdom of God the Bible said you
[1:22:45] are Kings and Priests a King to deliver
[1:22:47] and a priest to be able to minister
[1:22:49] you're a messiah he said and his signs
[1:22:51] was to follow in all ages reflecting his
[1:22:53] light and and his presence within his
[1:22:56] kingdom people oh my don't you see what
[1:22:58] we are this morning the kingdom people
[1:23:00] that are gathered in this place brother
[1:23:03] Mark to receive the power of God a so
[1:23:05] here we are a kingdom people with
[1:23:08] Kingdom power a very quiet Kingdom
[1:23:10] people with a very powerful Kingdom
[1:23:12] power we're a kingdom people with a
[1:23:15] kingdom
[1:23:16] power but the W see so we watch the
[1:23:19] watch what God done in this age if you
[1:23:21] look at the ages of the kingdom of men
[1:23:24] you realized that men came to this place
[1:23:27] where this great Kingdom of or this
[1:23:29] Kingdom of power had came to where it
[1:23:31] didn't seem to have much power at all it
[1:23:34] had came down it had been reduced down
[1:23:36] the kingdom of God this great Kingdom of
[1:23:38] power had been reduced down to manmade
[1:23:40] religion it had been reduced down to
[1:23:43] denominations to where the church had no
[1:23:45] power it was a very fulfillment of what
[1:23:47] Paul said it would be he said they' have
[1:23:49] in the last days a form of godliness but
[1:23:51] deny the power thereof so it had been
[1:23:53] this great Kingdom of power had been
[1:23:55] reduced down to this this just
[1:23:56] ritualistic church and and and going to
[1:23:59] these services and all and and just to
[1:24:02] just to maybe have brother said one time
[1:24:04] maybe have an anointed preacher and a
[1:24:05] couple of people that might get a little
[1:24:06] bit with him he said but but but there
[1:24:08] just no move of God because the people
[1:24:10] have so much pressure on this age to
[1:24:12] keep them from getting into that
[1:24:13] atmosphere said but here we are in this
[1:24:16] age but we're still preaching it and
[1:24:17] we're still we're still pressing why
[1:24:19] because it's a it's a returning of the
[1:24:22] power of the kingdom of God so what the
[1:24:24] the Bible also says that it would come
[1:24:25] to this place that this Kingdom power
[1:24:27] it'd be reduced down to that but the
[1:24:29] Bible said that also in the last agage
[1:24:31] that the seventh angel would appear with
[1:24:33] a Ministry and that Ministry would
[1:24:35] declare remember what the Declaration of
[1:24:37] the seventh angel was in the revelations
[1:24:39] it said it would declare the ending of
[1:24:40] the kingdom of man and the restoring of
[1:24:43] the kingdom of God and so you say well
[1:24:45] how would he do it he would do it by the
[1:24:47] restoration of the word in the slides
[1:24:50] didn't didn't work he said by the
[1:24:51] restoration of the word in the hearts of
[1:24:53] the Believers so so see here it's a it's
[1:24:56] a declaring of the ending of the kingdom
[1:24:58] of man and the restoring of the kingdom
[1:25:00] of God so it would be restored in the
[1:25:02] hearts of the Believers that's where
[1:25:03] this Kingdom would be restored so the
[1:25:05] power of the Kingdom it's going to be
[1:25:06] restored in the hearts and now he said
[1:25:08] see so Kingdom this Kingdom would be
[1:25:10] established by the revealing of the word
[1:25:12] of God and then God would take his word
[1:25:15] that was written and in the end time for
[1:25:17] the W that he would reveal it to men so
[1:25:19] this is what the revelation of the word
[1:25:21] of God was to do the Revelation would
[1:25:23] restore the power power of God in the
[1:25:25] hearts or in the in the hearts and the
[1:25:27] mouths of the Believers it would in
[1:25:28] other words it would restore the
[1:25:30] Believers back to their position so this
[1:25:33] is the purpose of God is to bring this
[1:25:35] Kingdom back to the Earth it was a in in
[1:25:37] the seventh age when the kingdom looked
[1:25:39] like it had lost power but there would
[1:25:40] come a restoration of the kingdom it
[1:25:42] would come it would come with the power
[1:25:45] of the same power of Jesus's Earthly
[1:25:47] Ministry it was the same works and the
[1:25:48] same power what was it to do it was to
[1:25:51] restore the kingdom back in the hearts
[1:25:53] of Believers again that they would that
[1:25:55] they would be able to to be in the
[1:25:57] position that God had called them I
[1:25:59] thought my a't that something he's
[1:26:00] restoring us back to our position this
[1:26:02] is the purpose of the restoration of
[1:26:05] Kingdom power I don't know if you ever
[1:26:06] played chess but you realize when you're
[1:26:08] playing the game of chess you can make
[1:26:10] one wrong move and it will take you out
[1:26:12] of position and you can hardly ever get
[1:26:14] it back you one one wrong move and now
[1:26:17] you get out of position you'll wind up
[1:26:18] in Checkmate because you can't defend
[1:26:20] your position because because you you've
[1:26:22] made a move or made a mistake
[1:26:24] I thought you know you know that's the
[1:26:26] way it is see whenever you get out of
[1:26:28] position you lose leverage on the enemy
[1:26:30] and so if you move out of position now
[1:26:32] you you've lost your leverage that's why
[1:26:33] when you go into battle in military they
[1:26:35] want the higher ground because the
[1:26:36] higher ground is a better position it
[1:26:38] gives you leverage against the enemy so
[1:26:41] see what Satan has done Through the Ages
[1:26:43] is he's he's came to take the church out
[1:26:45] of her position he's came see he's came
[1:26:47] to pull you out of this place but do you
[1:26:49] realize that the body of Christ has been
[1:26:51] given position over the devil how many
[1:26:52] knows what it was he said the devil has
[1:26:55] position under the feet of the Bride so
[1:26:57] you've given a position so you know what
[1:26:59] Satan wants you to do that's why he put
[1:27:01] so much pressure on you to lay down and
[1:27:03] to give up and to Destro your hands see
[1:27:05] because when you're laying down then
[1:27:07] you're out of your position see because
[1:27:09] Satan is supposed to be under your feet
[1:27:10] so whenever you're laying down he's not
[1:27:12] in his position and neither are you no
[1:27:14] wonder he wants you laid down and giving
[1:27:16] up or sitting down on the job but friend
[1:27:18] but I thank God that the Holy Ghost can
[1:27:20] come today and he can bring a person and
[1:27:22] establish them back on their feet where
[1:27:24] they belong that you don't have to lay
[1:27:26] down in a gutter and let the devil run
[1:27:27] over your life and wreck your life but
[1:27:29] he give you the authority that the power
[1:27:32] of the kingdom of God can establish you
[1:27:34] in God's kingdom in the position you're
[1:27:36] supposed to be in and put the devil back
[1:27:39] in his place see that's what this
[1:27:41] message done brother Mark it called the
[1:27:43] church back to her position as the Bride
[1:27:45] of Jesus Christ brother said God may we
[1:27:48] tonight take our stand may we take our
[1:27:51] position in Christ like men and women of
[1:27:54] God Sons and Daughters of the Creator
[1:27:57] who just spoke and the world came into
[1:27:59] existence we call ourselves Christians
[1:28:01] but we can't even believe for a little
[1:28:02] healing what you've promised to give us
[1:28:05] God forgive us of our stupidity may we
[1:28:07] rise tonight like real men and real
[1:28:10] women and real sons and real daughters
[1:28:12] of God and go forth in the earth
[1:28:15] conducting ourselves in like manner see
[1:28:17] it's a call to position you see what
[1:28:20] this message was doing it's a call to
[1:28:23] position there's so many that's out of
[1:28:25] cater there's so many that are out of
[1:28:27] their position but here what the message
[1:28:28] is doing this morning it's calling you
[1:28:30] to your position you say my position in
[1:28:33] what in the Kingdom of God in in to
[1:28:35] where you would have the Kingdom power
[1:28:37] brother Mark don't you realize that God
[1:28:39] don't want you to be powerless he wants
[1:28:41] you to possess the power of the Kingdom
[1:28:43] that you would be able to speak and the
[1:28:44] devil would have to take his lead it's a
[1:28:47] call to position he said that's a way we
[1:28:49] all made up differently we have
[1:28:50] different positions he said but we just
[1:28:52] need to find our position in Christ
[1:28:54] Christ and abide there and serve him in
[1:28:56] another place if we can find our
[1:28:58] position that's why that's why Joshua
[1:28:59] and Caleb when they went down and they
[1:29:01] were going into the promised land that
[1:29:03] none of the other spies could believe
[1:29:05] that they could take the land because
[1:29:07] there was Giants in the land but Joshua
[1:29:09] and Caleb were those that took position
[1:29:11] on the word of God see whenever the
[1:29:13] others they were taking position as
[1:29:15] little guys in a little army but they
[1:29:17] weren't taking position upon the Flesh
[1:29:19] and their position wasn't on what it
[1:29:21] looked like around them or what
[1:29:23] abilities that they had but they stood
[1:29:25] on the position of God's word has given
[1:29:27] us an authority to take the land so
[1:29:29] Satan is trying to take the church out
[1:29:31] of position but God sent a word brother
[1:29:33] Mar to restore you back to your position
[1:29:35] that where you could have the kingdom of
[1:29:37] power in your life again so you say well
[1:29:40] see see what happens watch our
[1:29:41] relationship with Christ now I'm going
[1:29:43] to hurry I'm won't hold you long but
[1:29:45] watch our relationship with Christ
[1:29:47] Christ his position is where in the
[1:29:49] heart of the believer your position is
[1:29:52] in the word which is Christ
[1:29:54] that's why Jesus could say I am in you
[1:29:57] and you are in me they're in me and I in
[1:29:59] them who all those that believe what
[1:30:01] they're preaching they're in me and I am
[1:30:03] in them see because Christ is in in you
[1:30:05] he's taken his position you take your
[1:30:07] position upon the word of God which is
[1:30:09] Christ now you're in him you see now
[1:30:11] Satan has no room you're in your
[1:30:14] position see notice what Satan wants to
[1:30:16] do he wants to take you out brother Mark
[1:30:20] take you out your position you notice he
[1:30:22] this is what he tried to do with Jesus
[1:30:24] and that's what he wants to do with you
[1:30:26] the Book of Matthew tells the
[1:30:28] story remember first in the third
[1:30:31] chapter John the Baptist preaches and in
[1:30:33] in his preaching he says repent for the
[1:30:36] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand then Jesus
[1:30:39] comes in Matthew the 4th chapter and
[1:30:41] watch what his message it was the same
[1:30:42] message he says when Jesus began to
[1:30:45] preach Matthew 4:17 repent for the
[1:30:47] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand but before
[1:30:50] Jesus begins preaching this notice see
[1:30:52] here John the Baptist had Pro side what
[1:30:54] the message would be and now Jesus would
[1:30:56] come to manifest that and preach that
[1:30:58] message but before he ever got into his
[1:31:01] position watch what Satan done see
[1:31:03] before Jesus said repent the Kingdom of
[1:31:04] Heaven is at hand Matthew 4 and8 the
[1:31:06] Bible says the devil took him upon an
[1:31:08] exceeding and high mountain and showed
[1:31:10] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:31:12] the glory of them remember what he told
[1:31:14] him he said if you'll Bow Down and
[1:31:15] Worship me I'll give you all this if
[1:31:18] you'll Bow Down and Worship me you
[1:31:20] notice what he was doing he was trying
[1:31:21] to take him out of out of his position
[1:31:24] right but you know what Jesus done here
[1:31:25] Satan would offer him here this great
[1:31:27] world he took him into this great place
[1:31:29] you know you may go up on that high
[1:31:30] mountain and it may look like a good
[1:31:32] position here look what Satan was
[1:31:33] offering what a great position he was
[1:31:35] offering here are the kingdoms of the
[1:31:37] world and if you'll Bow Down and Worship
[1:31:38] me I'll give them unto you what an offer
[1:31:41] he was trying to give him a great
[1:31:43] position but Jesus said but there's
[1:31:45] another position that I've been called
[1:31:46] to and notice what he said you can offer
[1:31:48] what you want you can but see he said I
[1:31:50] wouldn't fall for it he said but notice
[1:31:52] Jesus when he turned back him what did
[1:31:54] he say anybody remember what he said he
[1:31:56] said get thee hints you know what that
[1:31:58] word hint means it means removed from a
[1:32:01] place or a time in other words Satan you
[1:32:04] go from present tense to past tense as
[1:32:05] quickly as possible get behind me devil
[1:32:09] in other words get lost here I'm trying
[1:32:12] to offer you a position let let me
[1:32:13] establish you in this great position in
[1:32:15] the Kingdom of the world but he said get
[1:32:18] lost God's already given me a position
[1:32:21] I've been called to something greater
[1:32:23] I'm not going to ENT aain you there
[1:32:24] ain't nothing that you have to offer
[1:32:26] offer that I'm going to accept but I've
[1:32:28] been called of God to do something
[1:32:30] greater I been I wonder how many could
[1:32:32] look at that same devil when he offers
[1:32:34] you a position in the Kingdom of the
[1:32:36] world and say Satan I won't be in that
[1:32:37] place you ain't going to find me in no
[1:32:39] wh house somewhere you ain't going to
[1:32:41] find me in a drug house somewhere you
[1:32:43] ain't going to find me down there
[1:32:45] partying you ain't going to find me in
[1:32:46] that kind of field but I pray to God
[1:32:48] that you'll find me in the house of God
[1:32:50] in the position of a believer of a son
[1:32:52] and daughter of God
[1:32:54] I've been called to a higher
[1:32:56] position Satan's trying to take us bring
[1:32:59] you to another position but I ain't
[1:33:01] going to entertain him see what the
[1:33:03] gospel came to do brother Mark it called
[1:33:05] to establish you in your position listen
[1:33:06] what Paul said he said refuse see that
[1:33:09] you refuse not him that speaketh for
[1:33:11] they escape not who refused him that
[1:33:13] spake on
[1:33:14] Earth how much more shall we not escape
[1:33:17] from him that speaketh from heaven for
[1:33:20] whose voice shook the Earth but now he
[1:33:22] has promised saying once more for I
[1:33:24] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[1:33:27] and this word yet once more signify the
[1:33:30] removing of those things that are shaken
[1:33:32] as of things that are made and those
[1:33:34] things which cannot be shaken May remain
[1:33:36] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:33:39] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:33:42] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:33:44] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[1:33:47] a consuming fire said if God judged them
[1:33:50] when he spoke on Earth and they didn't
[1:33:52] Escape judgment how much about how much
[1:33:54] more will we not Escape judgment when he
[1:33:56] speaks from heaven but notice he said I
[1:33:58] I will shake the heavens and I will
[1:33:59] shake the Earth is't it something that
[1:34:01] that the bride she was shaken but not
[1:34:03] moved see the purpose to shake is to
[1:34:06] take all things and to and and and to
[1:34:08] vigorously uh to vigorously move them in
[1:34:11] a way that they would become loose so
[1:34:13] here the gospel would come in its power
[1:34:15] brother Wesley what would it do it would
[1:34:17] Shake everything that don't belong it
[1:34:19] would shake it off it would it would
[1:34:20] shake the things of the world it would
[1:34:22] shake them off of you that where they
[1:34:24] they would have no place anything that
[1:34:25] didn't belong there it would be shaken
[1:34:27] loose say see so so it came you notice
[1:34:30] there's so many I can't just preach to
[1:34:32] you a minute there's so many that have
[1:34:34] been shook up there's so much that have
[1:34:36] been shaken you realize to be shaken it
[1:34:38] means to have one's composure or
[1:34:40] confidence upset and shock to be shocked
[1:34:43] or to be disturbed said see so things
[1:34:45] will happen in our life God will allow
[1:34:47] things to happen in order to shake and
[1:34:50] lose confidence things that people say
[1:34:52] or do it'll it'll it'll have our our our
[1:34:55] compo our composure upset but you
[1:34:57] realize but the word move it don't mean
[1:34:59] what shape means move means to change
[1:35:01] your position say see so God will allow
[1:35:04] things to come into your life that will
[1:35:06] shake you but but you can't be moved it
[1:35:09] will allow that things to be shook off
[1:35:11] of you that don't belong maybe some
[1:35:12] little Spirit or some feeling or
[1:35:14] something that was passed down from your
[1:35:15] father but these things that are all
[1:35:17] over our life and we'll go through
[1:35:18] things and say well I wonder why
[1:35:20] everything's falling apart and I wonder
[1:35:22] why it ain't like it used to be and I
[1:35:23] wonder why all you know all these things
[1:35:25] that happen but God allows things to
[1:35:27] happen in our life to shake the things
[1:35:29] off of us that don't
[1:35:30] belong but it'll never take you out of
[1:35:32] your position see it can't move you oh I
[1:35:36] think about I think about David here
[1:35:38] when he was anointed to be king and I'm
[1:35:39] going to close with this but he was
[1:35:41] anointed to be king brother Wesley you
[1:35:44] realize he was a man of great Authority
[1:35:46] and here Samuel had came and poured the
[1:35:48] oil over his head said you you will be a
[1:35:50] great king over Israel and after he had
[1:35:53] received this anointing you would have
[1:35:54] thought that everything would have been
[1:35:56] perfect from that point on why didn't
[1:35:58] David go off and riding in a chariot
[1:36:00] after he was anointed to be the king
[1:36:02] over Israel but you realize that ain't
[1:36:03] what his life led him after he was
[1:36:06] anointed it wasn't very long you find
[1:36:08] David after after he he he goes and he's
[1:36:11] he's captured and he's taken to this
[1:36:13] place of the king of gath that was the
[1:36:16] member that the he had just destroyed he
[1:36:18] had killed their leader the the you know
[1:36:20] the the great Philistines and all all
[1:36:21] them and Goliath that came from them he
[1:36:23] said see but they took him to the king
[1:36:25] of gath you realize they captured David
[1:36:27] and they took him in there and David got
[1:36:29] to looking around well how'd I get in
[1:36:30] this place I I'll never be out of it and
[1:36:32] he and he pretended to be a Madman went
[1:36:33] clawing at the walls and foaming at the
[1:36:35] mouth and all this stuff so the the king
[1:36:37] said what this man's crazy what there
[1:36:39] ain't no prestige in having him and so
[1:36:41] he escaped out of him because he he was
[1:36:43] pretending to be a mad man so he goes
[1:36:45] out and he finds himself he he he scours
[1:36:48] all through the land and David that's
[1:36:49] anointed to be king finds himself hiding
[1:36:52] in a cave I don't know if you ever read
[1:36:54] about it but the cave it was the cave
[1:36:55] called adalum and in this Cave of adalum
[1:36:58] the the word adalum it means a refuge or
[1:37:00] the Justice of the people so here David
[1:37:03] that was that was called to be the king
[1:37:05] over Israel because of circumstances in
[1:37:07] his life brother mariri was hiding out
[1:37:09] in a cave and David begin to cry out to
[1:37:12] the Lord and he says Lord he said how
[1:37:14] long would you forget me how long would
[1:37:16] you hide your face from me shall my
[1:37:18] enemy come and destroy me you realize
[1:37:20] that Wy was hiding in that cave brother
[1:37:22] Mark that the Bible says that everybody
[1:37:23] else that was in the condition David was
[1:37:25] in they found theirself in the same cave
[1:37:27] there were those that were distressed
[1:37:29] they made their way to the cave those
[1:37:30] that were in over their head in debt
[1:37:32] they made their way to the cave those
[1:37:33] that were discontented they made their
[1:37:35] way to the cave and they gathered there
[1:37:37] with him I thought my no wonder David WR
[1:37:39] in Psalm 13 how long shall I take
[1:37:41] counsel in my soul having sorrow in my
[1:37:43] heart how long shall my enemy be exalted
[1:37:45] over me consider and hear me oh my Lord
[1:37:48] lighten my eyes lest I sleep the death
[1:37:51] lest my enemy shall say I have prevailed
[1:37:53] against him and those that trouble me
[1:37:55] Will Rejoice because I am moved this is
[1:37:58] that David's prayer God why how long
[1:38:00] would I lay here until you finally until
[1:38:03] I moved out of my position until I moved
[1:38:06] past what you've promised me to be until
[1:38:08] I'm taken completely out of the way Lord
[1:38:10] how long will I be here until you'll
[1:38:13] intervene but in the middle of this
[1:38:15] listen my enemy Rejoice because I'm
[1:38:18] moved from my place but listen at
[1:38:20] David's response he said but I have
[1:38:22] trusted
[1:38:24] in thy
[1:38:25] mercy how'd I get here my heart shall
[1:38:28] rejoice in thy salvation I don't know
[1:38:31] why these things are taking place I will
[1:38:33] sing unto the Lord why is everything in
[1:38:36] my life falling apart you've dealt
[1:38:38] bountifully with me Lord you're such a
[1:38:41] great God Amen everything's ack God how
[1:38:44] wonderful that you are I can't I can't
[1:38:47] get out of bed I can't I can't pay my
[1:38:49] bills oh God what blessings you have
[1:38:51] bestowed upon me it didn't matter matter
[1:38:53] the condition that David was in at the
[1:38:56] end he was praising God he would go on
[1:38:59] several times psalm 16 you'll find out
[1:39:02] why because this is the spirit of David
[1:39:04] he said because I have set the lord
[1:39:05] always before me because he is at my
[1:39:08] right hand and I shall not be moved so
[1:39:12] it doesn't matter what came my way I
[1:39:14] know the position that God has called me
[1:39:16] to and I shall not be moved Psalm 62 he
[1:39:19] said he's my rock and my salvation he's
[1:39:21] my defense and I shall not be
[1:39:24] moved so David gives instruction he says
[1:39:27] so trust in him at all times you people
[1:39:31] pour your heart out before him for he's
[1:39:33] a refuge for us trust not in oppression
[1:39:36] but become not vain in robbery if riches
[1:39:39] increase don't set your heart on them
[1:39:41] for God has spoken once but twice have I
[1:39:43] heard this that power belongeth unto God
[1:39:46] sir and and to he alone belongeth mercy
[1:39:50] and thou render us to every man
[1:39:51] according to his work
[1:39:54] so no matter what perplexity would come
[1:39:56] my way I shall not be moved I wonder how
[1:39:59] many stand to your feet this morning say
[1:40:01] the Devil he's trying to take you out of
[1:40:02] your position but say but Satan let me
[1:40:04] tell you what I'm going to do I'm going
[1:40:06] to walk right into the position that God
[1:40:08] has called me to amen I'm the Bride of
[1:40:11] Jesus Christ somebody remind the devil
[1:40:13] who you are this morning we're the Bride
[1:40:15] of Jesus Christ amen look around at
[1:40:17] somebody and say Miss Jesus isn't it
[1:40:20] wonderful brother Mark we're we're
[1:40:22] standing in the presence of this this
[1:40:23] great royalty this morning in a position
[1:40:26] that God has called us
[1:40:28] to I know
[1:40:30] sometimes we don't feel that
[1:40:34] way sometimes you feel like you're in
[1:40:36] the
[1:40:37] cave I don't know how long David stayed
[1:40:40] there many days weeks maybe months time
[1:40:44] for men that would come from all across
[1:40:46] the country to join him there camped out
[1:40:49] in a in a cave by the mark that that
[1:40:51] would be a refuge
[1:40:53] a place that looked like it was a a
[1:40:55] place of
[1:40:56] distress it looked like it was a place
[1:40:58] of failure you ever been there you ever
[1:41:01] get so low you to say I failed anybody
[1:41:04] ever feel that way besides me I failed
[1:41:07] I'm just not a I'm just not a very good
[1:41:09] Christian I'm a poor
[1:41:12] excuse poor excuse for a Son of God I'm
[1:41:15] a poor excuse for one that would have
[1:41:18] Kingdom
[1:41:20] power but here was an anointed king
[1:41:24] in a
[1:41:26] cave it looked like a rough place but
[1:41:29] you realize that even in that place he
[1:41:31] was right where God wanted him to
[1:41:34] be isn't it something Brother David I
[1:41:37] thought it was something here he was
[1:41:39] complaining about all this he was hiding
[1:41:41] but in this place that he had ran to it
[1:41:44] was a place of
[1:41:46] refuge and all these failures and all
[1:41:48] this stuff that was going on in his mind
[1:41:50] but God said but I've called you here
[1:41:52] you know what it does done it made David
[1:41:54] closer to God that he would call out to
[1:41:56] him and say Lord you see my condition my
[1:41:59] situation and I need your
[1:42:01] help maybe you find yourself there this
[1:42:04] morning in a cave of
[1:42:07] adalum Lord how'd I get to this place I
[1:42:10] know I was called to be something
[1:42:12] greater I I was anointed to be a king
[1:42:15] and a priest you say you was anointed
[1:42:17] but certainly we were anointed by the
[1:42:19] word of God you realize that's what when
[1:42:22] the when the the word of God goes forth
[1:42:24] and the spirit of God takes his word and
[1:42:25] pours it out over the body of people
[1:42:27] that ain't no different than than than
[1:42:29] Samuel pouring that anointing oil over
[1:42:31] David's head it's the spirit of God
[1:42:33] anointing his church you've been
[1:42:34] anointed to be king anointed to be
[1:42:38] priest you be say but Lord how'd I get
[1:42:42] here David said how long shall I stay
[1:42:44] shall I stay long enough till all of my
[1:42:46] K my enemies Mock and laugh at me in my
[1:42:50] condition that I am moved
[1:42:53] but brother Mark he had a revelation
[1:42:56] that I shall not be
[1:43:00] moved don't matter how deep the cave is
[1:43:03] no matter how dark the corner is you can
[1:43:06] lift your hand this morning and say but
[1:43:08] I shall not be
[1:43:09] moved maybe if somebody would join me
[1:43:12] say brother mat that's my testimony I
[1:43:15] don't care about how far gone you were
[1:43:18] how far you fell we're not here to talk
[1:43:20] about all the David's failures not here
[1:43:23] to talk about all the all the wreck
[1:43:25] wreck of his life and how he wound up in
[1:43:27] a cave as a
[1:43:29] Madman but I'm here to talk about his
[1:43:31] testimony that in the middle of all of
[1:43:34] that there was something down on the
[1:43:36] inside of him that could still lift his
[1:43:38] hand say Lord I recognize my surrounding
[1:43:41] I've been in a cave but in the cave of
[1:43:44] adalum I lift my hand and I say I shall
[1:43:47] not be
[1:43:48] moved Lord I shall not be moved I
[1:43:51] recognize God you haven't forsaken me
[1:43:53] you haven't failed me you've not given
[1:43:55] up on me I shall not be
[1:43:58] moved Lord
[1:44:01] Jesus oh God what a atmosphere in this
[1:44:04] building this
[1:44:06] morning God I realize Lord as the
[1:44:09] pressing Lord that we've done and God
[1:44:12] the ministering and the pressing and the
[1:44:14] pulling God to enter into this great
[1:44:18] atmosphere of the Kingdom of
[1:44:21] Heaven God we see H Lord that you would
[1:44:25] Minister to hearts and God I also see
[1:44:28] that great enemy Lord but it would comat
[1:44:31] that the Kingdom power as he did with
[1:44:34] Jesus that
[1:44:36] day but Lord we realize that your word
[1:44:38] is
[1:44:39] greater God that would overcome the the
[1:44:42] words that the enemy would speak to the
[1:44:44] hearts of these young people Lord to
