Certainly, we have just one request tonight as we get ready to bring them before the Lord. Just says, "Please pray for Sister Sandy. She's having problems with her shoulder tonight. So, just remember her. I'm sure a lot of people know Sister Jordan's in the hospital right now looking to have that baby. So, we ask the Lord to be with them tonight.

And it's been a rainy day outside and but certainly good to be in the house of the Lord with licks of fire. And amen. God's manifesting himself among us once again. Hope we never take it for granted. God's a good God. Amen. I just been looking forward to the service today and I hope you have done the same. And man, I tell you, God's never failed us one time. He's never yet not to meet our expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you expect me to do something special for you, I'm going to fail you. But God has never failed his children one time. He'll meet your expectation. That's what kind of God we serve tonight. Amen. If you could bow your heads one more time tonight and just before we go to his precious word, if you got a need upon your heart, just make it known to the Lord, just remember my sister in prayer once again. And also the family, Xavier and Sister Jordan, and the family there, brother Matt, pastor, and the family all there. And it's just looking for a new life coming too. It's just nothing like it. So, just pray for them and let the Lord be a hand upon that. and and bless him in a sweet way this evening. Just pray in your own way. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for an opportunity to come and worship you once again, Father. Lord, that we're such a needful people, Lord. We stand in a need of prayer tonight, Lord. Lord, we realize tonight without you, we're nothing, Lord God. We we we fall short. We make mistakes, Lord. But not one time have you ever failed us, Lord. Lord, in our humanity, Lord, it may feel like you're you're late sometimes, but you're always on time. Lord, we serve a powerful God tonight. Lord God, you're you're our healer. You're our savior. You're there's still some bomb in Gilead for whoever has need of it tonight. Lord, we pray, Lord God, that you'll go by the hospital this evening to my sister, Lord, laying in the intensive care unit, Lord. I pray, Lord God, that you'll minister healing to her body, Lord. Lord, I pray Lord God for brother Xavier and Sister Jordan, Lord, that you'll go by their bedside too tonight, Lord. Lord, and give them exactly have what they have need of the strength in their body, a a healthy baby to deliver, Lord. We place it those needs into your hands tonight, Lord, for now, for the remainder of this service, Lord, that you'll come in a special way. Anoint us aresh, Lord, as we dig into your word one more time, Lord. Come and use our our lips, Lord God. and anoint us aresh Lord knowing the ears to hear. Let our hearts burn within one more time for your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you got your Bibles tonight, we would invite you to Ephesians chapter 2. Chapter 11, verse 14. Do you love the Lord? Amen. God's good to us, isn't he? We like to take a thought tonight the power of this everlasting covenant. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 11 says, "Wherefore remember that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumciition by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands. that all that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace and who hath made us both one and hath broken down the middle wall of petition between us. Can you say praise the Lord? Hebrews chapter 13 verse 20. Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead of our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of this sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. Well, God bless you tonight and you can have your seats and we like to take for a moment tonight and some of these things that's been laying on our hearts for a couple weeks and actually two or three weeks now. And and uh God knows all things. He knows exactly who who's preaching. He knows exactly who would be here. He knows exactly what's going on. We serve a very mindful God. He's a pre-planned God. He has it all pre-planned out before the foundation of the world. That's the beauty of our God. Nothing catches our God by uh by catches him off guard. We You might catch us off guard. We might be caugh uh caught off guard sometimes, but God never gets caught off guard at any time of our journey. Nothing happens to us by a coincidence. Remember Romans 8 tells us all things work for the good of them that love their God and called according to his purpose. Amen. So we would like to take for a moment tonight and preach on the power of this everlasting covenant as we glean through Ephesians chapter 2 for a moment. And we REALIZE THAT EVEN GOD MAKES A covenant with man, God never breaks it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that when man makes a covenant with God, Brother Brown says he always seems to break his covenant. Amen. It's just the way it is. But when he told Abraham there in Genesis, "Thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy." It was an unconditional covenant. It was a sign of victory for many to come. Amen. That brother would say, "Thess gates of his enemy." And he would say it like this, brother Noah, in you all things. Amen. You have the power to overcome temptation. You have the power. Amen. Everything lays within a believer. If you are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, even the rapture is already within you. It's just needing to be exercised or released. So we realize, amen, we're not waiting on a great power to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not waiting on another messenger to come. just waiting, amen, for us to take that last step of faith and and change from this dimension to that dimension. But every time man made a covenant with God, he breaks it. But we serve a determined God. Amen. That God that was going to make a covenant that would never be broken. Not if you will or you have. No, he's an unconditional covenant that he makes between God and his his prodigy. So, brother would say it like this. When he swore by no greater, he swore by himself. And it WAS GOD BY GOD'S FORNOWLEDGE. God made a covenant with himself. &gt;&gt; And he tried to hook a covenant with Adam and he said Adam broke it. He said he broke it. He hooked it on the covenant and he broke it. Amen. BUT HE SAID, "BUT GOD MADE THIS COVENANT UNCONDITIONALLY and he hooked it in Christ Jesus." HE SAID, "THERE it anchored. There's no slipping. There's no sliding. There's no way of getting away. What is it? It's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath." And he said, "What it is, it's the pathway. It's a traveler's way from earth to glory." In other words, he's making a way that a believer can overcome no matter what phase of the journey that he may be in. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; So he says he hooked it around his son. He hooked it around the heart of God above and the son of God on earth and it will travel his way from earth to glory. I like it like this. He says, "You can't fail." Amen. Look, there's great companies of angels up and down, extending and descending, picking up the weary and picking up the sick and HEALING THEIR BODIES AND SHOWING VISIONS AND MIGHTY SIGNS AND WONDERS. AMEN. IT CAN'T FAIL. IT CAN'T SLIP. It can't slide. He said, "YOU ARE SAFE." GOD SAID SO, and that settles it forever. IT'S HOOKED AROUND THE HEART OF GOD OF HEAVEN and he's hooked it on the son of God down here. AND HE SAID WE ARE BROUGHT INTO IT THROUGH THE SON OF GOD. HE SAID AND we can you say with me tonight we ascend to him. Amen. We ascend to him. That should make you excited tonight. Amen. If you're hooked in between here and here, you can't fail. You can't die no more than GOD CAN DIE. YOU CAN'T BE DESTROYED. YOU CAN'T BE DEFEATED. I TELL YOU TONIGHT, HIS GRACE is amazing. Amen. Yet we realize, Amen. because of what happened in the Garden of Eden. Amen. They look back there in THE OLD COVENANT FROM from the since the fall there in the garden of Eden. Amen. When man sin, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM GOD AND HE CROSSED the great chasm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he put himself into death on this side. And from that moment, brother Joe, there was a distance. &gt;&gt; Amen. THERE WAS A SEPARATION. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHASM that was put between man and God. MY BUT GOD'S TAKEN for this very moment WHEN THAT FALL OF ADAM and Eve THAT GOD WENT into action and he for the first time, BROTHER TIM, HE WENT AND slew an innocent lamb and he took the bloody lamb skkins AND HE TOSSED THEM TO HIS HIS SON AND HIS DAUGHTER AND THEY WRAPPED THEMSELVES BECAUSE FROM THAT POINT. A BUT GOD HAD TO HONOR HIS WORD. AND THE DAY THAT YOU EAT OF THAT, THE DAY THAT YOU SHALL DIE AND FROM THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A SEPARATION. THERE CAME A DISTANCE BETWEEN MAN AND GOD. A BUT THERE WAS GOD LOOKING OUT. THERE WAS A GOD WATCHING ADAM AND EVE WALK OUT OF HIS PRESENCE WITH THE INNOCENT LAMB BLOOD SLAPPING AGAINST THEIR LEGS. WALKING OUT OF HIS PRESENCE. AMEN. AND SOMETHING BEGIN TO STIR IN GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, if you've EVER LISTENED TO BROTHER BRANDON DRAMATIZE IT OUT. AMEN. SOMETHING BEGIN TO HAPPEN THAT GOD COULDN'T HARDLY STAND IT ANY LONGER. HE SAID, "I." AND HE SCREAMED OUT, "I AS A PERSONAL PRONOUN. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYBODY GOING TO TAKE MY PLACE." IT WAS A PERSONAL PRONOUN. I WILL PUT ENMITY BETWEEN THY SEED AND THE SERPENT SEED SCREAMING THERE'S A SAVIOR COMING. THERE'S A REDEEMER COMING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GOD WHO'S RICH in mercy. Amen. And we know that GOD TOOK A SACRIFICE FROM THAT MOMENT AND THE OLD COVENANT UNDER THE OLD LAW. AMEN. THEY WOULD TAKE BULLS and goats and sacrifice them. Amen. and they would PUT THEIR HANDS UPON their altar &gt;&gt; and the blood of bulls and goats would never divorce sin. &gt;&gt; It would only cover it &gt;&gt; for a space of time. &gt;&gt; So, it's only a temporary victory. &gt;&gt; It's only a temporary covering. IT'S ONLY IT'S A SPACE OF TIME. THE OLD COVENANT JUST COVERED UP OR PATCHED it up. HE'S STILL THE SAME DESIRE THAT HE WALKED IN WITH. &gt;&gt; HE WALKED BACK OUT WITH THE SAME DESIRE THERE. THE THERE WAS A GREAT CHASM THERE. From that point, THE MEN BEGIN TO FALL FROM GOD. AMEN. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE BORN OF a woman. Just bear with me for a FEW MOMENTS. WE'RE BORN OF A WOMAN A FEW DAYS AND FULL of trouble. Can you say amen? AMEN. FROM THAT MOMENT, THIS BODY BEGINS TO GO BACK TO THE DUST. IT BEGINS. THERE'S A THERE'S A PULL BACK TO THE DIRT WHICH WE CAME FROM. AMEN. As time, brother, would go through time as a sun comes up. Amen. Makes his way over about midday and back over. HE SAID, "THERE YOU ARE." AMEN. JUST A BABY. AMEN. And there you go. AS A SUN COMES AROUND, YOU'RE reaching your 18 to 20 years old, your prime. Amen. As the sun goes over, THERE YOU ARE. AMEN. REACHING YOUR YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS. AND 40 AND 50 YEARS OLD. AMEN. Just in a few day, a few months, I'LL BE TURNING 50 YEARS OLD. AMEN. AND I AND I LOOK BACK, WHERE DID TIME GO? AMEN. YOU JUST take a blink. And you got grandkids. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, AMEN. YOUR your shoulders begin to stoop. Amen. YOU START TO GO BACK TO THE DUST WHERE YOU COME FROM. AS YOU BEGIN TO AGE, it begins to pull you back to the to the dirt which you COME FROM. AMEN. BUT THAT'S THE BECAUSE OF THE fall in the beginning. AMEN. YOU'RE BORN OF A woman and you're a FEW DAYS AND FULL OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; But under THAT OLD COVENANT, BROTHER SAID THE OLD COVENANT IS WITH ONE THING. He said, "BUT THIS NEW EVERLASTING covenant is God bloodbound promises &gt;&gt; makes us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world." There was a law of God that under the blood of the lamb, they didn't take away the sin. And when a man sinned, HE CROSSED THE GREAT CHASM. WHEN HE SINNED AWAY, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF AWAY from God, LEAVING HIMSELF WITH NO WAY BACK. &gt;&gt; SO THE COVENANT OF SIN IS A TEMPORARY COVENANT WITH NO RELEASING POWER. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS TENDER MERCY ACCEPTED THE substitute for him. And the substitute lasted for thousands of years, but it wouldn't take away sin. &gt;&gt; It only covered up sin. Remember, brother would say like this. If I had a red dot in my hand and I touched something and I covered it up, &gt;&gt; it's still there. &gt;&gt; That's what the the the blood of bulls and goats, shadows and types of one coming. the very thing that God were visualizing there in the Garden of Eden when he seen him walking out. Amen. He would say, "I would put empathy." He was saying, "I'm going to come. I'm going to be a kinsman and redeemer. I'm going to shed my blood." Amen. IT WAS A BUT BUT UNTIL THEN, AMEN. IT WAS A TEMPORARY COVERING. IT WAS A TEMPORARY FIX. IT WAS A PATCHED UP &gt;&gt; COVERED UP. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO REDEMPTION POWER. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY VICTORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But it wouldn't take away sin. It only covered it up. &gt;&gt; But brother, I would say, BUT NOT BUT THIS BLOOD. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But when God kind of send it down, &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my time for a moment. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN GOD CONSIDED SEND IT DOWN FROM the heavens. Remember this is wasn't going to be a work. He had it was A SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD. HE WASN'T GOING TO PUT THIS IN NOBODY ELSE'S HANDS. AMEN. When he said, "I would PUT ENMITY." HE MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID. I WILL BECOME MAN. AMEN. I KNOW THAT THIS POINT THERE IS A CHASM. A MAN CANNOT REACH HEAVEN. BUT WITH BUT THE GOD WHO'S RICH IN MERCY, I WILL PUT EMPATHY BETWEEN THY SEED AND THE SERPENT SEED. HE WAS SCREAMING OUT THESE VERY WORDS. I'M GOING TO MAKE A WAY. I KNOW MAN CAN'T REACH HEAVEN, BUT HEAVEN WILL COME DOWN. &gt;&gt; HEAVEN CAME AND EMBRACED EARTH. &gt;&gt; NOT MANUFACTURED. &gt;&gt; NOT THE HELP OF MARY. NOT THE HELP OF JOSEPH. THIS WAS A SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD. IT WAS NOT MANUFACTURED. &gt;&gt; My brother SAID IT WASN'T MANUFACTURED. IT WAS THE CREATIVE. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT WAS THE CREATED BLOOD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; Brother B said, "But God not manufactured. It was his creative power created a blood cell without sexual desire. in the womb of a virgin that don't only cover sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It don't ONLY COVER SIN, IT EMITS SIN. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES IT SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY TO NEVER IN THE MIND OF GOD AGAIN. It don't make a bridge. &gt;&gt; But now CHRIST JESUS, HE SAID IT doesn't make a bridge. He moves the chasm. BUT NOW CHRIST JESUS, YE WHO SOMETIMES WERE FAR OFF, &gt;&gt; IS MADE NIGH BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WAS AT A DISTANCE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAME TO THIS WORLD a certain way. AMEN. UNDER THE OLD COVENANT. AMEN. LISTEN, CHURCH. AMEN. We was all born &gt;&gt; in a fallen condition. &gt;&gt; Come on. Look to your neighbor. Are we all the same tonight? Hey, but Tom, if it wasn't for his grace, if it wasn't for his mercy, Amen. we would be just LIKE THE THE GAMBLER DOWN THE ROAD OR THE HARLOT DOWN THE STREET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But he made nigh HE BROUGHT US BACK. BUT THE two is able to become one again. AEN THAT HE DID NOT MOVE OR BRIDGE the chasm. He didn't LEAVE THE DISTANCE THERE ANY LONGER. AMEN. THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, NOT MANUFACTURED, BUT THE BLOOD OF THE CREATIVE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. HE DID NOT BRIDGE A WAY BACK. HE REMOVED THE CHASM THAT THE THAT WE COULD BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God for it. Amen. The maiden high by the blood of Christ. For it is our peace who hath made boat one hath broken down the middle wall petition &gt;&gt; between us. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. For the law having a shadow of good things to come. Not the very image of these things can never with those sacrifice were they offered year by year continually make comers there unto perfect. For thou would they have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices there is remembrance again made of sins every year. In other words, it only covered the red dot. &gt;&gt; It never took the desire away to sin. &gt;&gt; Man, this thing could blow up tonight. Amen. So, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE BLOOD of bulls and goats should take away the sins. &gt;&gt; It didn't have the ability, THE ONLY ABILITY IT HAD WAS TO COVER IT UP. IT WAS A TEMPORARY VICTORY. &gt;&gt; So it was it WASN'T NEVER DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO break it down. &gt;&gt; Whereinfor have we cometh unto the world, he said, sacrifices and offers thou wouldest not, but a body has thou prepared for me, and burnt offers AND SACRIFICE FOR SIN THAT HAS no pleasure? Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book. It is written of me to do thy will, oh God. In other words, I come to FULFILL THAT PERSONAL PRONOUN THAT WAS SPOKEN there in THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I WOULD PUT EMPATHY BETWEEN THY SEED AND THE serpent seed. I COME IN THE VOLUME of the book. I've come to FULFILL EVERYTHING THAT IS WRITTEN OF ME. And above when he said, "Sacrifices offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin, thou wouldest not, neither has pleasure therein, which are offered by the law." Then said, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God, he taketh away the first, that he can establish a second, by which we were sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all." Every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifice. Brother David Paul there was no rest. &gt;&gt; Listen to listen to the scripture. I know I minister on these years ago. Just bear with me. Every priest standed daily ministering offering OFTEN TIMES THE SAME SACRIFICE. WE CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY SIN. BUT THIS MAN AFTER HE OFFERED UP ONE SACRIFICE FOR SINS FOREVER SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. IN OTHER WORDS, AMEN. THERE WAS NO REST. IT WAS A NEVER A FINISHED WORK. THE THE PRIEST STANDED DAILY OFFERING UP THE SAME SACRIFICES. BUT THIS MAN OFFERED UP THE SACRIFICE OF A CREATIVE BLOOD THAT CAN NEVER LOSE HIS POWER. HEY, BUT SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD TO TELL HIS BRIDE, "THIS IS A FINISHED WORK. THIS IS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT." &gt;&gt; The reason why it's an everlasting covenant is because the blood is good to the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, he says he's going to Calvary. Amen. He's going to Calvary. Can I finish the scripture first? But this man after he offered up this sacrifice sins forever sat down at the right hand of God. For henceforth expect until the enemies be made his foottool. For by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof, the Holy Ghost also is witness to us. For after that he has said before, this is a covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I'll put my laws into their hearts and their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a power. AMEN. SO THERE GOES GOD. AMEN. THERE GOES CHRIST AT CALVARY. HIS BACK'S BEATING till his ribs showing through NEARLY HE SAID THERE HE STARTS UP THE ROAD WALKING along as he's going looking at them and I look oh all over his back there's little red spots over there like old GARMENT WAS WO THROUGHOUT WITHOUT a seam look AT THOSE RED SPOTS HE SAID WHAT ARE THEY directly they get bigger and bigger and bigger and the first thing they all run to one big spot he says now I hear something again what is it. HE SAID, "THERE GOES THE SECOND ADAM. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST ADAM BROUGHT IN DEATH, &gt;&gt; a chasm, a distance, a fall." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE FIRST ADAM BROUGHT DEATH." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BUT HERE COMES THE SECOND ADAM." &gt;&gt; HE'S GONE. HERE HE GOES. THIS ONE'S BRINGING LIFE. THERE'S ONE WHO TOOK LIFE OUT OF THE WORLD AND PLACED A CHASM THERE. HERE'S ONE WHO'S BRINGING LIFE BACK IN THE WORLD. THE SECOND ADAM WITH HIS OWN BLOOD HITTING AGAINST HIS OWN LEGS. THE SON OF GOD GOING TO CALVARY bearing away our sins. &gt;&gt; The blood to perfect the man and woman. Oh, catch this brother man. Even perfect a man or woman unconditionally. Hallelujah. Amen. You don't have to work for this. It ain't what I will do or have done. Amen. It's no. No. This is the unconditional COVENANT THAT GOD MADE. AMEN. With his creation. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER TO BREAK EVERY FALL. IT'S A POWER TO BREAK EVERY CHASM. IT'S A POWER, A TO LOOSE EVERY SIN. And the 17th verse of Hebrews chapter 10 says, "And their sins and iniquities, brother Travis, I remember them no more. Oh church, it's as easy as that." When he was looking at the cross, Sister Martha, he was looking to the thief on the cross. He looked over and said, "This day thou will be with me in paradise." Brother Bram said, "That was God's grace that did that. Amen. Thy sins and iniquities I will remember no more. &gt;&gt; It's the power of this everlasting COVENANT. GOD DOES NOT IMPUTE to you anything that's done because you're under this blood. He doesn't see it. It's the blood sacrifice. The only thing he God can see you in. Are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it? &gt;&gt; Amen. When God looks through the blood and looks through the innocent blood, he looks through the sacrifice OF HIS OWN CREATED BLOOD, &gt;&gt; he don't see Joe Bourneger's FAULT. HE DOESN'T SEE YOUR FAILURES. &gt;&gt; SAY, "Brother Joe, you're making a grace of disgrace." No. Amen. And he said, "The only thing that God CAN SEE IS THE WAY HE SAW YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD." WHEN HE PUT YOUR NAME IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, HE SAYS, "THAT'S ALL HE CAN LOOK AT BECAUSE YOU ARE REDEEMED FROM EVERYTHING, EVERY SIN, EVERY BITTERNESS, EVERY SHAME, EVERY GUILT. You're washed in the blood of the lamb. He says, "Therefore, there's no g in you." &gt;&gt; You know what that means? There's no sin in you. There's no bitterness. There's no unclean habit in you because the blood of the lamb has did this. And God cannot impute sin to you after you got a sin offering laying there waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Tom, what can make me whole again? HUH? WHAT CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE AGAIN? THE BLOOD changed me. THE BLOOD OF THIS INNOCENT CREATIVE BLOOD, IT DIDN'T AMEN COVER MY PAST. &gt;&gt; It didn't cover the red spot. IT WASN'T A TEMPORARY VICTORY. IT WASN'T ONLY A TEMPORARY WORSHIP. IT WASN'T A TEMPORARY PRAISE. AMEN. BUT UNDER THIS NEW AND LIVING WAY, UNDER THE BLOOD, UNDER THIS POWER OF THIS NEW COVENANT, UNDER THIS EVERLASTING COVENANT, AMEN. WE'RE FULL OF VICTORY. WE'RE FULL OF WORSHIP. WE'RE FULL OF PRAISE. WE'RE FULL OF OVERCOMING POWER. WHAT CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. It's not just a temporary fix. Revelation 1 and5 says unto him that loved us and a and washed us from our sins in his own blood. The word wash actually said means loosed. He's loosed us. Can we reread it? Unto him that loved us and loosed us from our sins in his own blood. Consider this. How many wants to consider this? Consider this. Since it is the blood of God, it's not manufactured. &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not man-made. Religion didn't make this. A church didn't make this. A man didn't make this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Since it is the blood of God, &gt;&gt; Brother Morgan, he said it is a perfect blood. He said it is a perfect blood is loosening us from the power of bondage and defilement of sin. Then it's loosening is perfect and his loosening is complete. No water. He said now there is now no more condemnation to them. Amen. I'm telling you this loosening IS PERFECT. I MAY FALL. I may MAKE MISTAKES. I MIGHT FALL SHORT. BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CAN NEVER FALL. IT CAN NEVER FALL SHORT. IT CAN NEVER LOSE ITS POWER. IT CAN NEVER LOSE ITS STRENGTH. IT CAN NEVER LOSE ITS ABILITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's solution is perfect and complete. Who brother Romans tells us who should lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Think about how powerful that statement is. Amen. We know. &gt;&gt; Nobody else knows, but &gt;&gt; we know. &gt;&gt; I know. You know, you know your past. &gt;&gt; You know what you done. You know what you're guilty of. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He said, "But who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies you." He said, "And declares US RIGHTEOUS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE WORLD SAYS about me. THEY CAN TALK ABOUT ME. THEY CAN STANDALIZE MY NAME. THEY CAN ATTACH MY NAME TO anything want they want to." Amen. But what can make me WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER OF THIS EVERLASTING COVENANT. IT HAS TRANSFERRING POWER. IT HAS A TRANSFORMING ABILITY. &gt;&gt; What happens to the son? He said he becomes perfect fellowship with the father again &gt;&gt; standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance. See see where he puts us. Amen. standing on the other side, not the opposite side. Amen. Where we was under the old covenant. A no, he drew us nigh by the blood of THE INNOCENT LAMB. AMEN. NOW WE'RE STANDING ON THIS SIDE OF THE CHASM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED?" PERFECT FELLOWSHIP STANDING ON THIS SIDE OF THE CHASM WITH NO REMEMBRANCE OF sin against him. NO MORE. THERE IS NO MORE STAIN OF THE BLEACH COULD EVER SEE it anymore. He is free. Oh, I'm preaching to every one of you. He is free. JUST AS A CLOROX ink can never you drop. And remember he said you take ink and you go drop it into the bleach. And the bleach, brother John has the ability. It's a solution. It has ability. Water can't do. It has ability. SODA CAN DO, HAS ABILITY NO OTHER LIQUID CAN DO, BUT COROX'S BLEACH has the chemical UH ABILITY TO BREAK DOWN THE MOLECULES THAT'S IN the drop of ink. &gt;&gt; And you drop THE INK IN AND THE BLEACH AUTOMATIC STARTS TO WORK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUMP IT UP, PRIME IT UP, TALK IT INTO IT. It the bleach just begins to do THE WORK. AMEN. THAT'S THE WAY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUMP IT UP, PRIME IT UP. YOU DROP YOUR PAST IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS, IT HAS THE ability to break it down. &gt;&gt; UNDER THE OLD COVENANT WAS COVERED UP. &gt;&gt; BUT UNDER THIS NEW COVENANT, THE BLEACH OF GOD'S BLOOD, &gt;&gt; not just cover it up. can never be ink no more. &gt;&gt; You think it's a coincidence? Brother Brown tripped over and found found something to say on tape about Clorox bleach. No sir, it's powerful. ONCE INK IS DROPPED INTO the bleach, IT REACHES THE POINT OF NO RETURN. HALLELUJAH. AND OUR SINS AND INIQUITY WILL BE REMEMBERED NO MORE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Cuz it's created blood. Not any blood would work. Not manufactur blood would work. NOT BULLS AND GOATS. MANUFACTURED BLOOD WOULD NEVER WORK. That ink can never be ink no more because it's broke up and sent back again. WHEN CONFESSED SIN IS CONFESSED and dipped into the blood, man or woman, it kills all symptoms. Catch this, Sister Eve. Every molecule of sin, every molecule of sin goes back, it breaks it down, all your past, all your failures. When your sins are confessed and dropped in the bleach of the son of God, it remits sin so much till he puts it in the sea of God's forgiveness and can never ever be remembered in the SIGHT OF GOD ANYMORE. What does that make a man? He said, what does that make a man? A son of God. And he SAID, "HEY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO be on this side of the chasm now." Amen. He has made you a SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD COULD NEVER GOD CAN NEVER remember your sins again. &gt;&gt; He said, "There it is. His death gave us the blood and the blood has loosed us. There is now no condemnation. How can there be? There's nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from our sin. We are free. We are guiltless. Don't listen to man. Come on, somebody preach with me. Don't listen to man. Listen to the word. YOU ARE LOOSED BY THE BLOOD. HE DIED NOT TO REDEEM PART OF YOU, BROTHER JOE. HE DIED TO REDEEM ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; To give you THE ABILITY TO COME BACK WHERE YOUR FIRST PLACE IS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, what the power of this everlasting covenant has such a transforming power. But if you're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ, brother, you're linked. You're linked with him. In other words, you're connected with him. You're joined with him. So the blood of this everlasting covenant not only has a transferring power, it has a joining power. It has a connection power. No wonder, brother, sister Denisha say, "All my power," God says, "All my power is yours, Sister Denisha. It's yours. You're an heir to it. ALL MY PROMISES, ALL MY POWER, ALL MY ABILITY, I give to you." &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE BLOOD BROUGHT YOU in connection with that power. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is that going over your heads tonight? Amen. That you're connected. AMEN. YOU'RE NOT WAITING ON THE POWER TO GET TO THE OUTLET. THE POWER'S ALREADY THERE. AMEN. And when the BLOOD OF THIS INNOCENT LAMB, AMEN, YOU CROSS THE CHASM, YOU'RE CONNECTED WITH THE POWER. YOU'RE NOT WAITING ON IT TO COME. AMEN. YOU'RE THIS SIDE OF THE CHASM. YOU SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND IT WILL HAVE TO FLEE. YOU SPEAK TO YOUR STORM AND IT WILL HAVE TO CEASE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. There's connecting power. There's a joining power. There is a linking power. Linked with him in power. Linked with him in freedom. No wonder it says in Revelation, we overcome by the blood of the lamb. In the word of our testimony, by the blood I'm redeemed. By the blood, I'm healed. By the blood, I'm delivered. By the blood, I'm secure. By the blood, I'm I'm justified. There's no shame on me. All records are destroyed. &gt;&gt; We can't be judged no more. He says we're not patched up or covered up. The molecules have been changed by the bleach of the blood that transfor transferred our sin and our guilt and our shame. You are declared righteous through the power of this everlasting covenant. Hallelujah. Living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he carried my sins far away. He took your sins of the people upon himself. He was a sin offering. Buried, he carried my sins far away. No more can they be remembered. They're gone. Listen to this powerful statement. They are out of the eyes of God. That's powerful tonight. They are paralyzed. They are divorced. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE PUT AWAY. GOD don't even remember them anymore. They are been loosed. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE BEEN BROKE DOWN. EVERY MOLECULE HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN. HALLELUJAH. You say, "Not me, Brother Joe. I've been a drug addict. I'VE BEEN A ALCOHOLIC. I'VE BEEN AN ADULTERER. I'VE BEEN I've been a gambler. I've been this and I've been that." Amen. I'm telling you. Amen. You ain't been to a place where God's grace can't find you. Amen. If you're a part of God before the foundation of the world, Amen. HE SAID, "YOU MAKE YOUR BED IN HELL. I'LL SHOW UP THERE. IF YOU ASCEND TO THE HEAVENS, I'M GOING TO SHOW UP THERE. IF YOU RUN, I'LL CATCH YOU. IF YOU HIDE, I'LL FIND YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY GRACE TO YOU TONIGHT. YOU SAY, "NOT ME, Brother Joe. You don't know what I've been through. I might not know, but I know the power of this blood." That one lady at Michigan was thinking the same thing. She was a harlot. Hey, she gave her life to prostitution. She was a drug addict. A bet. Nobody wanted nothing to do with her. She was an outcast. There she was. Amen. A RED SPOT ALL OVER HER LIFE. &gt;&gt; And brother B said, and begin to encourage us. Just pray, sister. Just pray. Just begin to pray. Begin to pray to your God. BEGIN TO ENTER ENTER INTO PRAYER. AMEN. I'm telling you, God can do something with you. GOD CAN REMOVE GOD CAN DO SOMETHING SPECIAL for you. And she be to pray just like you did one day. Amen. She came to an altar. She began to pray right there where she was at. Brother Brown would walk by and there she was still praying. All of a sudden, Brother Brown said she she reached the point of no return. Something happened. BROTHER BROWN SAID IT TOOK HER BACK TO THE time of she was a virgin. Oh, you talking about the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. We put limits on the blood. WE PUT LIMITS. AMEN. THERE'S PEOPLE I GIVEN UP ON. SAID THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR. BUT GOD WHO'S RICH IN MERCY NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU. HE CAME CHASING YOU DOWN. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING. AMEN. NO GUILT, NO MOLECULE OF SIN, NO SHAME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And there's no big eyes and little 's &gt;&gt; from this wall to the back doors. &gt;&gt; We all humans. &gt;&gt; We're all came the same way. We all fight our battles. We all go through situations. But end of the day, I am what I am by the grace of God. I'm serving the Lord NOT ON MY OWN MERITS. I'M NOT SERVING THE LORD ON MY OWN WORKS. AND I TELL YOU TONIGHT, I'M PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST TONIGHT BECAUSE I AM WHAT I AM BY THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND THE BLOOD of the innocent lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an everlasting covenant. You love him. &gt;&gt; Oh my time's getting away. He said New Testament is a new covenant. It's a new life. show Jesus has met every requirement for us that God required to make us make us back truly sons and daughters of God under the blood with there's no more condemnation the bride. Oh, what can he do with me? Have you ever said that Dave Paul? I know I have. What could God do with me? Look at you. Look at you. I tell you what, God can make you a son and daughter of God. said, "What could he do?" They thought the same thing the day of Noah. &gt;&gt; What in the world was Noah doing with a bunch of gopher wood? &gt;&gt; Hey, that was the worst wood. Amen. That wasn't that well, you couldn't get no worse wood. &gt;&gt; And and Noah's out there collecting the all the gopher wood that he can get. and he takes and go gets an evergreen tree and he begins to take the light the sap out of the evergreen tree and he begins to boil the sap and all of a sudden he begins to pour the hot resin upon the gopher wood and the gopher wood is designed it WAS THE ONLY WOOD THAT WOULD soak it up and brother BROWN SAID THAT THAT GOPHER WOOD I tell you that's the way I feel tonight amen I wasn't nobody special I was a gopher wood a but God WHERE I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO HEAVEN HEAVEN CAME DOWN and embraced this earth. He been told me, he said, "Hey, JOE, YOU CAN'T, BUT I'VE ALREADY done it." HE SAID, "WHEN I WILL PUT EMPATHY," BROTHER BROWN SAID, "WHEN HE SAYS, "I WILL," THAT MEANS IT'S ALREADY DONE. I'M NOT WAITING ON it to come, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But once, brother M said once that old gopher wood is filled up with that that hot sap, it begins to get harder than steel. too heavy. Didn't look like it'd ever float. They said, "Man, that that guy there'll never make a good Christian. That guy there'll never make a body change. That guy right there will never that lady there'll never make a rapture. She's nothing but gopherwood." And God's pouring out his life upon her. &gt;&gt; She keeps soaking it up. And all of a sudden, she gets so hard. Hey, but not her spirit hard, but she gets so cased over by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. Listen friends. Amen. Brother said you can bump AGAINST THE LOGS AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE YOU. You can go through trials and it doesn't stop you. You can go through persecution and it can't hinder you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT'S THE WAY THE ARK WAS. AMEN. IT WAS RISEN AND RAISED ABOVE IT ALL. &gt;&gt; And church, that's the way you are. You bloodbound promised people. AMEN. YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH. PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF YOU. THEY COULD STANDIZE YOUR NAME, BUT I'M telling you, church, this boat's going to float. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything here has an end. &gt;&gt; The new trucks we buy, the new homes we remodel, the new homes we build, the new job we take, it's here today and gone tomorrow. There's no continuing city.

But I CAME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What a pro. Extra, extra. Read all about it. That red spot. Are you with me for five more minutes? That red spot that Satan wants to tell you about all the time. Your past, your past, your failures, your failures, you what you've done.

Are you with me? Amen. Begin to break down the molecules of that sin BECAUSE WHAT THAT SIN WAS, it was a righteousness perverted AND BECAUSE IT GOT OUT HIS rightful condition. Amen. There that bleach was had the ability to break that down AND SEND THOSE MOLECULES BACK TO WHERE THEY come from. &gt;&gt; It attached me.

We thank you, Lord, for another opportunity to come and rally it around your precious word tonight. I pray, Lord God, that they catch a glimpse of such a precious word that's came in our hour by the messenger of Malachi 4. Lord, to let us know, Lord, we never done it in the first place. It's been broken down in our past and went back to the accuser, the devil, to take it all the way to hell. Oh, what the power of this New Testament covenant that was given to a believer. Oh, God. That we're standing not not just forgiven but justified. In your eyes, who can lay anything to the charge of of your elect? It is you, Lord, that justify. It is you, Lord, that liberated us. It was the power of that creative blood cell that was broken that day at Calvary. And the life of that blood could come now and separate us and erase it, divorce it, make us free. We're so thankful for it tonight, Lord. Thank you, Lord God, for our service tonight. Thank you for your presence, Lord. I pray, Lord God, that you just bless everyone here tonight.
