[1:00:37] and amen amen God bless you tonight if
[1:00:41] you have your Bibles we would like to go
[1:00:43] right into the word
[1:00:46] um i' would like to go into Ephesians
[1:00:48] chapter
[1:00:49] 1 and and uh as this book of Ephesians
[1:00:53] parallels the of Joshua uh we want to
[1:00:56] look in here the ninth verse the n9th
[1:00:58] and 10th verse this this uh book of
[1:01:01] parallels of course the two books and so
[1:01:05] we've been preaching out the Book of
[1:01:06] Joshua and we're dealing with that when
[1:01:09] Joshua came to the captain of the host
[1:01:11] of The Lord's army brother man teaches
[1:01:14] us who that was it was meaz it was
[1:01:17] Elohim it was God the Unseen one took a
[1:01:22] took a physical body so he could talk to
[1:01:25] his servant amen and in the great
[1:01:28] warrior Joshua brother bam actually says
[1:01:30] he says that was where Joshua was
[1:01:32] position amen he was put in Authority by
[1:01:35] the voice of that angel so we know amen
[1:01:38] that's exactly what gives the authority
[1:01:41] to the bride Church in the last days
[1:01:43] Ephesians chap 1 and verse
[1:01:45] 9 and Paul's saying this having made
[1:01:48] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:01:53] according to the good pleasure which he
[1:01:55] had purposed in himself that in the
[1:01:57] dispensation and fullness of time he
[1:01:59] might gather together in one all things
[1:02:02] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:02:05] which are on earth even in him and may
[1:02:09] the Lord bless his words you can be
[1:02:11] seated I want to uh just take a few
[1:02:14] minutes in this tonight and I'm going to
[1:02:16] continue on this Joshua generation amen
[1:02:19] and I want to uh just that this morning
[1:02:21] in your mind we want to transition just
[1:02:23] for a moment
[1:02:24] and we read this and I want to read this
[1:02:26] spe specific area I want to read to you
[1:02:29] out of the Amplified Bible now making
[1:02:31] known unto us the mystery secret of his
[1:02:34] will of his plan of his purpose and it
[1:02:38] is this in accordance with his good
[1:02:40] pleasure his merciful intention which he
[1:02:43] had previously purposed and set forth in
[1:02:46] him he planned for the maturity of the
[1:02:49] times and the climax of the ages to
[1:02:52] unify all things and head them up and
[1:02:55] consummate them in Christ both things in
[1:02:58] heaven and things on the earth now I I
[1:03:02] think it's a powerful thing when the
[1:03:04] when the prophet uh speaks to us about
[1:03:06] this uh according to the mystery of his
[1:03:09] will and I want to I want to just take
[1:03:12] for a moment here and read uh just a
[1:03:15] just a definition according uh to the
[1:03:17] Greek here on the word uh or at least on
[1:03:20] the word mystery it's the word mysterium
[1:03:22] and it literally means something into
[1:03:26] which one must be initiated now before
[1:03:29] it is fully known see to initiate or to
[1:03:32] instruct and then anything which is
[1:03:34] concealed or hidden now we commonly use
[1:03:36] the word to denote that which is above
[1:03:38] our comprehension or unintelligible but
[1:03:42] this is never the meaning of the word in
[1:03:44] the New Testament it means there it
[1:03:46] means that there's some Doctrine or fact
[1:03:49] which has been concealed or which has
[1:03:52] not been before fully revealed which has
[1:03:55] been set forth only by figures and
[1:03:57] symbols and when the doctrine is made
[1:03:59] known it may be as clear as any other so
[1:04:03] many people think about the word mystery
[1:04:05] as something that's uncomprehensible
[1:04:07] it's not uncomprehending it just means
[1:04:10] it's something you must be initiated
[1:04:12] into somebody must show you and when it
[1:04:15] speaks of even just like the Gentiles
[1:04:17] when they were in the Old Testament they
[1:04:19] were they were forecasting that they
[1:04:20] would be The Heirs of salvation but they
[1:04:23] didn't know it until get to the New
[1:04:24] Testament and then the book of Acts
[1:04:26] remember they referred back and said was
[1:04:28] it not written in the scripture that he
[1:04:29] would reveal again the House of David so
[1:04:31] the scriptures were there but they
[1:04:33] didn't really know it because it wasn't
[1:04:35] initiated into it but when God initiates
[1:04:37] a person then that mystery is made known
[1:04:40] so it's not
[1:04:42] uncomprehended it just was hidden until
[1:04:44] a time that it was revealed and so we
[1:04:47] look at it in this age of the church and
[1:04:49] we recognize now that's why that we're
[1:04:51] not standing here like um trying to
[1:04:54] teach like like everything's a mystery
[1:04:57] because at the season we're living God
[1:04:59] has made plain or has made clear the
[1:05:02] great Mysteries of the Bible so as that
[1:05:05] just a hillbilly preacher can preach the
[1:05:07] great Mysteries of the scripture amen
[1:05:10] without a lot of Education a lot of
[1:05:12] understanding you and I'll tell you one
[1:05:13] thing's different about studying a
[1:05:15] prophet than there is studying
[1:05:16] theologians because theologians are not
[1:05:18] able to bring an exact this is that to
[1:05:22] everything they're looking at but a
[1:05:24] prophet does it it's different because
[1:05:26] he's able to vindicate that he don't
[1:05:28] just have to say well it could be but
[1:05:30] most theologians they'll say well so and
[1:05:32] so said this and it could be this and
[1:05:34] and it could be this and and then again
[1:05:36] it could be this but see faith is never
[1:05:38] built on it could be but Faith must be
[1:05:42] built on Vindicated World we're not just
[1:05:44] wanting any faith in this age we're
[1:05:47] wanting Rapture Faith so Rapture faith
[1:05:50] has to come from a direct Revelation
[1:05:53] which is like what Moses gued the pillar
[1:05:55] of fire out of the burning bush he got a
[1:05:57] direct Revelation that's exactly what
[1:06:00] was happening to Joshua at the walls of
[1:06:01] Jericho a direct Revelation this is your
[1:06:05] land you see he said the Lord have given
[1:06:08] to this see this see this the Lord have
[1:06:10] given thee this land Joshua 6:2 when
[1:06:13] he's talking to him he actually says
[1:06:15] these words see the Lord has given thee
[1:06:17] this land I have given thee see you've
[1:06:20] got to catch the vision that it belongs
[1:06:22] to you and that has to come from the
[1:06:24] authority of the one that owns it that
[1:06:26] he's given you something and God begins
[1:06:28] to deal with the church he begins to
[1:06:30] make it clear so as that you understand
[1:06:33] what really belongs to you now the
[1:06:35] brother bam in the adoption Series in
[1:06:37] part four he'll talk about some powerful
[1:06:39] little area here and brother said
[1:06:41] something tied together from me he said
[1:06:43] and he was taking the word mystery and
[1:06:45] running it through the scripture and he
[1:06:47] said see the mystery of his coming he
[1:06:50] said the mystery of his will and the
[1:06:52] Mystery of us setting together together
[1:06:54] now there's three things that you would
[1:06:56] if you want to write them down you can
[1:06:57] CU a powerful thought amen there is the
[1:07:00] mystery of his coming there is the
[1:07:02] mystery of his will and there's the
[1:07:04] mystery of us setting together in other
[1:07:07] words he's showing you that when you see
[1:07:10] the mystery of his
[1:07:11] coming you'll then get the mystery of
[1:07:14] his will and then you'll see us setting
[1:07:16] together with him amen it'll begin to
[1:07:18] position the church in your position
[1:07:21] with God now here's the thing when we
[1:07:23] talk about the coming of the lord we
[1:07:25] talk about the mystery of his coming now
[1:07:27] if you're standing there at the walls of
[1:07:29] Jericho you can see that was the Lord if
[1:07:31] you're was at the burning bush you can
[1:07:33] see that was the Lord now what we
[1:07:35] dealing with in this age is we recognize
[1:07:38] that there is a there is a corporate
[1:07:39] Return of the Lord Jesus to come here at
[1:07:41] the Gentile age and that the bride
[1:07:44] churches to be caught up and meet him in
[1:07:46] the air I was just listening to uh three
[1:07:48] kinds of Believers this week and brother
[1:07:50] man said he said now here it is there'll
[1:07:52] come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:07:54] said that'll catch this bride off of the
[1:07:56] earth and we'll meet the Corporal body
[1:07:58] in the air and he said that's what every
[1:08:00] believer believes amen that that will be
[1:08:03] that but see here's the thing that
[1:08:04] traditional teachings and the churches
[1:08:07] have taught that that we're going to
[1:08:08] look for that body on the earth and then
[1:08:11] we're going to to Mee in here so the so
[1:08:13] the the ministry of Jesus Christ would
[1:08:15] be in this Nar body but brother random
[1:08:18] is the one that's teaching us from the
[1:08:19] Bible it was already there we just
[1:08:21] didn't know it was there and he begins
[1:08:23] to teach us on there that there is a
[1:08:25] mystery to his coming Amen to the Church
[1:08:27] of God to to the bride Church there is a
[1:08:30] mystery of his coming to us and that
[1:08:33] great mystery is it's the mystery of
[1:08:37] Elohim now if you go back and see this
[1:08:39] in the piece of trumpets brother man
[1:08:41] says the wise shall know but the foolish
[1:08:43] and unwise wouldn't know and he shall
[1:08:45] appear in the last days to bring these
[1:08:48] people back to the word so this bride
[1:08:51] will know her husband her ma the
[1:08:53] revealed word that's why this has to
[1:08:55] happen now it wasn't in the reformers
[1:08:57] and it wasn't in Lutheran it wasn't in
[1:08:59] the Pentecostals or Wesley he said see
[1:09:02] he says but the promise for this age see
[1:09:05] we're living in the age his coming will
[1:09:08] be now now brother man is not talking
[1:09:11] about just his physical body he's
[1:09:14] talking about this is the age that the
[1:09:16] word he just told you the revealed word
[1:09:20] is your mate and this is the season the
[1:09:23] revealed word your mate will be coming
[1:09:26] to the church you see what he's talking
[1:09:28] to us about is the mystery and he says
[1:09:30] watch now he said he packed me over
[1:09:32] there and he showed me the mystery of
[1:09:34] his coming and the Mystery of his wheel
[1:09:36] and the Mystery of a setting together
[1:09:38] now let's take just a few minutes on
[1:09:40] this on the mystery of his coming now
[1:09:42] what are we talking about it's the
[1:09:43] revelation of Elohim many of you here
[1:09:46] tonight already possess it now you can
[1:09:47] say it different ways and I've always
[1:09:49] been amazed with the by the bride church
[1:09:52] that sometimes you say it one way and
[1:09:53] church will think well that's as far off
[1:09:55] as the east from the west and then you
[1:09:56] say it a different way they say well
[1:09:58] that's exactly the way we believe it but
[1:09:59] really it's the same thing just terms
[1:10:01] just turns are a little bit different
[1:10:03] from different directions but when you
[1:10:05] talk about the mystery of his coming
[1:10:07] we're talking about Elohim we're talking
[1:10:09] about the revelation of Elohim of how
[1:10:12] that God is an unchanging
[1:10:15] God right God who is unseen amen who no
[1:10:19] man seen at any time is an unseen God
[1:10:22] and he is an changing God now that's the
[1:10:25] direct nature of God is he said I am God
[1:10:29] and I change not and that's the most
[1:10:31] powerful Revelation that you can ever
[1:10:33] catch is that God is God and he said I
[1:10:36] do not change he never changes amen the
[1:10:39] the unchanging God with unchanging
[1:10:42] nature but that God changes forms and
[1:10:45] that's an important Revelation because
[1:10:47] one time you see him as a pillar of fire
[1:10:50] the next time you see him as a man
[1:10:51] standing next to the wall and you be a
[1:10:54] man meeting Gideon at the wine press
[1:10:56] he'll be another time meeting s's mother
[1:10:58] out in the field amen what it is is God
[1:11:01] changes forms amen but he never changes
[1:11:05] his nature no matter the form that he
[1:11:07] appears into the church amen now we find
[1:11:09] out here according to Philippians the
[1:11:11] third chapter amen the Philippians the
[1:11:13] second chapter amen that brother Adam
[1:11:15] teaches the whole message the unveiling
[1:11:17] of God he teaches that message and tells
[1:11:21] us that no matter what form he's in he
[1:11:24] remains to be God he is always God and
[1:11:27] that's why in Joel chapter 2 he said I
[1:11:29] pour out my spirit saying the Lord in
[1:11:32] the last day brother said the word pour
[1:11:33] out doesn't mean like pouring water out
[1:11:35] of a glass he says it means he's going
[1:11:37] to change his mask he's going to be God
[1:11:41] in Mor who was in Mor in the father who
[1:11:43] was Mor in the son he said but now he
[1:11:46] will be in Mor thing in the bride it's
[1:11:49] the same God he's changing M The God Who
[1:11:53] Wasn't above us it became the God who
[1:11:56] was with us is now The God Who is in us
[1:12:00] he is in the people we got himself to
[1:12:02] the people that we have come to the
[1:12:04] fullness of time by the fullness of the
[1:12:06] word amen to the fullness of the
[1:12:08] manifestation of God this is the last
[1:12:11] attribute of God to be manifested on the
[1:12:14] earth it's rapure time and the Church of
[1:12:17] the Living God is receiving the same
[1:12:20] Jesus amen he's the same yesterday today
[1:12:22] and forever but this time he appears in
[1:12:25] Bride
[1:12:27] form he's the same Jesus but he is in
[1:12:30] Bride form amen I love how brother Rand
[1:12:32] says in here he says see it's the bride
[1:12:35] coming of Christ amen what is it it's
[1:12:38] bride coming of Christ amen it's the
[1:12:41] same Jesus but he packs three different
[1:12:44] names is it is it beautiful if you start
[1:12:47] catching the revelation of the names
[1:12:48] amen he comes as as the son of Son of
[1:12:52] God he comes as son of of David and he
[1:12:54] comes the son of man same God but he
[1:12:57] packs different names three same names
[1:12:59] amen let's just put it when Jesus was on
[1:13:01] the earth and he was standing there one
[1:13:03] day and a blind beggar he wanted to call
[1:13:06] him the son of David and he got his eyes
[1:13:08] Sid but there was a little woman
[1:13:10] standing over there by amen and she
[1:13:12] began to approach him and she said unto
[1:13:14] the same man now she said thou son of
[1:13:17] David have mercy on me and he wouldn't
[1:13:19] even talk to her he wouldn't even
[1:13:21] acknowledge that she was talking to him
[1:13:23] but the minute she changed and said thou
[1:13:26] St she said unto him Lord amen Lord and
[1:13:30] when she called him Lord Brother said
[1:13:32] there it was there was the Revelation
[1:13:34] the name was the Lord he was the Lord to
[1:13:37] the Gentiles he was not the son of David
[1:13:40] to the gentille he was the Lord and
[1:13:43] under that name she found out that all
[1:13:46] the power she' ever needed was standing
[1:13:49] right there but she had to know how to
[1:13:51] access that power it was in the name she
[1:13:55] had to recognize him is Lord oh Church
[1:13:58] of the Living God that's exactly who
[1:14:00] he's revealed to to the Gentiles in the
[1:14:03] last day is the same Son of God who is
[1:14:06] the same son of David but he said I will
[1:14:08] be revealed as the son of man in the
[1:14:11] last days it would be a prophetic office
[1:14:13] that would reveal Jesus Christ and he is
[1:14:16] not in the Tom in Jerusalem he has not
[1:14:19] in our history books he's not just back
[1:14:21] there in Jerusalem he is in the Bride of
[1:14:25] Jesus Christ the sa yesterday today and
[1:14:28] forever he's not just in this room he's
[1:14:31] not just in our services he is packing
[1:14:34] right inside every member of this bride
[1:14:36] in the last days he has revealed himself
[1:14:39] as the son of manen he's revealed
[1:14:42] himself as the son of man because he
[1:14:44] packs three names and then the prophet
[1:14:46] of God said amen now I'm not getting
[1:14:48] away from revelation of Jesus now amen
[1:14:50] his three sons names now watch here
[1:14:52] because in the trial you all know that
[1:14:55] in 1933 a light appeared to brother
[1:14:58] brandom and spoke and said as John the
[1:15:00] Baptist forun the first
[1:15:02] coming you'll have a message at a
[1:15:04] forerunning second coming and all the
[1:15:06] way in 1964 in the trial Amen brother
[1:15:09] man says he starts calling people blind
[1:15:11] prosecutors he says because they knew
[1:15:14] they knew what the promise was they knew
[1:15:17] what the commission was and brother M
[1:15:19] had been there so long and he said now
[1:15:22] but but see scri prosecutor scripturally
[1:15:25] blind prosecutor he said you're going
[1:15:27] around and this sounds ridiculous
[1:15:29] because you're scripturally blind he
[1:15:31] says but the Bible said in Luke 17:30
[1:15:33] that Jesus would be the son of man as it
[1:15:35] was in the days of Sodom he says now you
[1:15:38] want to know where is the man he's the
[1:15:41] same yesterday today and forever you
[1:15:43] want to know where the nail scars and
[1:15:45] the prince and things are he said any
[1:15:47] hypocrite could do that and look at what
[1:15:50] brother man say he said anybody could
[1:15:52] dress up like Jesus walk in this room
[1:15:54] tonight he says but see the Life of
[1:15:57] Christ returns in the form of the Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost not a nail
[1:16:03] Scar the Corporal body is sitting at the
[1:16:06] right hand of God to make intercessions
[1:16:08] but the Holy Ghost has come to carry out
[1:16:11] his word I want you to know that the
[1:16:14] Holy Ghost has come to carry out his
[1:16:16] word how many knows that the body is
[1:16:18] there brother said the body is there
[1:16:19] there is a literal body in heaven he
[1:16:22] said but that this body this mystical
[1:16:24] body is on the earth as a shadow of that
[1:16:27] body that is there he said that's why
[1:16:29] when you say that the church can't
[1:16:31] perform Miracles you have paralyzed his
[1:16:34] body because you paralyzed his shadow he
[1:16:37] said but as long as his body is there
[1:16:39] and his shadow is here the shadow should
[1:16:41] do everything that the body does you are
[1:16:44] the shadow of the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ what he's casting upon the earth
[1:16:50] and the work of God should be in the
[1:16:51] church and because you are his actual
[1:16:54] body so it's not a nail scarred body
[1:16:57] amen it's a bride body but it's the holy
[1:16:59] ghost in the form of that body amen do
[1:17:02] you see brother man said it like this in
[1:17:04] the trial he said every knee and every a
[1:17:06] shall tongue sure he said but he promise
[1:17:09] now to turn into Power of the spirit and
[1:17:13] vindicate his
[1:17:14] word that's what his promise is that he
[1:17:17] would come as the spirit and vindicate
[1:17:19] his word in the trial of man said he
[1:17:21] promised that Christ returning in the
[1:17:23] form of the word working in human beings
[1:17:26] showing signs promised it would be he
[1:17:28] promised that that would be see God
[1:17:31] promised it and in sech we would see
[1:17:33] Jesus but the man said this Jesus was
[1:17:35] God In the Flesh and if Jesus is in you
[1:17:38] tonight it's still God manifest himself
[1:17:41] in the last days the son of man
[1:17:43] revealing himself in his church the
[1:17:45] human flesh making himself known isn't
[1:17:49] that amazing amen if you take God and
[1:17:51] put him in Jesus he's God but if you
[1:17:54] take that same God and put him in the
[1:17:56] church he's the same God now now I don't
[1:17:58] know how to explain it but let me just
[1:18:00] say is a he amen uranium seems pretty
[1:18:03] harmful doesn't it amen y' anybody know
[1:18:05] what uranium is just that radioactive
[1:18:07] stuff they put nuclear bombs your head
[1:18:09] your your hand melts off if you touch it
[1:18:11] and on Amen but you know can you imagine
[1:18:13] somebody taking a water of uranium that
[1:18:15] was refined and put it in the paper bag
[1:18:17] and handing it to you and say hey don't
[1:18:19] worry about the paper bag changed it
[1:18:21] it'll be all right amen you know that
[1:18:23] paper bag don't change that uranium and
[1:18:25] you know that that a plastic bag don't
[1:18:28] change that uranium it's just as
[1:18:30] powerful in a plastic bag or a paper bag
[1:18:32] or a carpet bag it doesn't matter the
[1:18:34] kind of bag you p in it don't lose his
[1:18:37] power by the bag and if that's true of
[1:18:40] the name what about the God of all the
[1:18:43] creation if you put it in the blue if
[1:18:46] you put it a p dress and you put it
[1:18:49] behind the skin of a young child or an
[1:18:51] elder sister even need to be the same
[1:18:54] Jesus t with the same power with the
[1:18:57] same Authority our God is Not
[1:19:01] de the church the same yesterday today
[1:19:04] and forever of course this is Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ that has come down in this age he
[1:19:10] promised he would be here as the son of
[1:19:12] man amen it would be in the bride coming
[1:19:15] of Christ and brother man says if he
[1:19:17] appeared to us in a physical body and
[1:19:20] looked exactly like Hoffman's head of
[1:19:22] Christ at 3 with blood running out of
[1:19:24] his hands and nil scars over him I
[1:19:26] wouldn't accept him
[1:19:30] good now now if you want to go back to
[1:19:32] history remember brother R said Mark was
[1:19:34] sitting writing one night and he said
[1:19:36] there was somebody appeared unto him
[1:19:38] that looked just like the Lord Jesus
[1:19:40] with a crown on his head and brother
[1:19:42] said that in Pentecostal bait right
[1:19:43] there he said they they have flung to
[1:19:46] that he said but that Mark was
[1:19:48] scriptural Tau and when he seen that
[1:19:50] appear he knew that Jesus wasn't big to
[1:19:53] the Millennium so he knew that was out
[1:19:55] of season it was the word out of season
[1:19:57] he knew that wasn't the Lord and brother
[1:20:00] said he took that e and throw that him
[1:20:02] and told the devil to get he wouldn't he
[1:20:04] wouldn't power if he that and the Church
[1:20:07] of the Living God's not power in sou
[1:20:09] posture but Jesus never a promise to
[1:20:12] come Among Us like that he did promise
[1:20:15] to come as the sou man to manifest his
[1:20:18] care in the last days to put
[1:20:21] this he embodies himself I'm reading
[1:20:25] directly out spiritual food be see he
[1:20:27] embodies himself in my body and your
[1:20:29] body and gives gifts and Goes Through
[1:20:31] the Ages it's the secret
[1:20:33] food it's the secret food now let me ask
[1:20:36] y'all something what was brother bram's
[1:20:38] real job when he was here what was the
[1:20:40] real job he had I tell you what brother
[1:20:43] Ram says about it he said my Ministry is
[1:20:45] different than a pastor or a teacher he
[1:20:47] said but this is my Ministry is to
[1:20:50] declare him he is
[1:20:55] here now brother Adam might have he
[1:20:57] might have mixed up a story and used
[1:20:59] numbers this way and that way and he he
[1:21:02] proved to us that he had the memory like
[1:21:04] a man amen but the ministry that he had
[1:21:08] was not to tell you how many was in the
[1:21:10] crowd at at the Ohio river which I
[1:21:13] believe whatever he said on fine with me
[1:21:15] amen but that wasn't his ministry that
[1:21:18] wasn't what brother random was sent here
[1:21:19] to do what he was sent to do is to
[1:21:22] manifest Jesus so plainly that he would
[1:21:25] declare that he was here among the
[1:21:27] church let me just say what brother man
[1:21:29] said we have the answer to the devil's
[1:21:31] question he said the headship is him
[1:21:33] Christ the religion Lord is him the same
[1:21:36] power of the Resurrection he's
[1:21:38] manifesting himself the headship is here
[1:21:41] he is here the headship is here look
[1:21:44] what it is amen the headship of it when
[1:21:46] you see the coming of Elohim when you
[1:21:48] see that now this this makes sense to us
[1:21:51] makes helps us understand
[1:21:53] why in Joshua 1 that the Bible said they
[1:21:55] was to meditate upon the word Day and
[1:21:57] Night the things that Moses said they
[1:22:00] were to hold on to now you got to think
[1:22:01] about this an entire nation was
[1:22:04] dedicated to keeping a man's words that
[1:22:07] entire nation was dedicated to keeping
[1:22:09] those words and I'll tell you why
[1:22:11] because it wasn't just the words of a
[1:22:14] man they knew where Moses got those
[1:22:16] words they knew that those words come
[1:22:19] out of God's mind and they put it down
[1:22:22] now now we all look here today and we
[1:22:24] got a Bible and we can confirm it all
[1:22:26] but they didn't have that back there
[1:22:27] Moses was the one that wrote the Bible
[1:22:30] and and in the first chapter of the Book
[1:22:32] of Genesis watch Moses and God and God
[1:22:35] and God and God and what was he doing
[1:22:38] eloh him Elohim Elohim Elohim why
[1:22:41] because the author of The Bible was
[1:22:43] mentioned more times in the first two
[1:22:45] chapters of the Bible because eloh was
[1:22:48] the one that was tell Moses didn't know
[1:22:50] how the world was created but Genesis 1
[1:22:53] he said it as if he knew because he was
[1:22:56] a prophet and God was using a man to
[1:22:59] dictate words to a church before it was
[1:23:03] it was am it was the same one Moses met
[1:23:07] and was re rting the Bible was the same
[1:23:10] one Abraham
[1:23:11] meant I always love it I always love it
[1:23:14] when Moses is writing about Abraham's
[1:23:16] meetings with meel cazic and then he
[1:23:18] gets down to the 10 door there in
[1:23:20] Genesis and talks about how that he
[1:23:22] entertains the angel and what he did and
[1:23:24] all the things that happened amen I
[1:23:26] thought it was beautiful because Moses
[1:23:28] wasn't there but he says it just like it
[1:23:30] was that and let me say this amen
[1:23:32] anytime you can retell a story like that
[1:23:35] you talked to one of the two people that
[1:23:36] was involved and Moses didn't know
[1:23:39] Abraham and Moses didn't know s but the
[1:23:42] one that was being entertained at the T
[1:23:45] door and met Moses right there in the
[1:23:47] bush and that same him that same him was
[1:23:52] the one that made Joshua as a wall it's
[1:23:54] the same one that stood on the platform
[1:23:57] in the last days and read the hearts of
[1:24:00] the people where from coming because was
[1:24:04] speaking
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:10] again now if you see if you see why if
[1:24:15] you see why they kept that word it was
[1:24:18] because Elohim gave it to
[1:24:21] them you begin to understand that that
[1:24:25] was the mystery of the wheel other words
[1:24:28] the wheel the work was the will of him
[1:24:31] that was speaking now now if you go back
[1:24:34] in this brother man will tell us in the
[1:24:35] Book of Daniel he'll tell us that in the
[1:24:37] last days that the wise will understand
[1:24:41] now that's a that's that's a beautiful
[1:24:43] saying the wise will understand now in
[1:24:47] Ephesians chapter 5 Paul will say this
[1:24:50] he says you should awake all them that
[1:24:51] Sleepless and rise from the dead for
[1:24:53] Christ should give the light see them
[1:24:56] that that walk circumspectly not as
[1:24:58] fools but as wise that's right Redeeming
[1:25:01] the time that days are evil wherefore be
[1:25:05] ye not unwise but understanding what the
[1:25:09] will of the Lord is how do you know the
[1:25:14] will of God unless you know the mystery
[1:25:17] of his coming see the the the mystery of
[1:25:21] his will begins
[1:25:22] with the one that sets the order now I
[1:25:25] just go in here and say this unless we
[1:25:27] know the word what's the sign unless we
[1:25:29] know the word we don't know what to do
[1:25:31] we can't have faith until we know what
[1:25:33] is the will of God and he says then if
[1:25:36] we know it is the will of God the word
[1:25:38] of God says something that we should
[1:25:40] gladly follow
[1:25:42] that see how you going to know the will
[1:25:46] until it's revealed if you go back in
[1:25:47] the scripture in Revelations 18 Abraham
[1:25:50] visits with Sarah and Abraham and after
[1:25:52] at the end of the visit amen he begins
[1:25:54] and turns to Abraham and brother he just
[1:25:57] says something to him like this he says
[1:25:59] now look being that you're the air of
[1:26:00] the earth I'm not going to hide what I'm
[1:26:02] about to do from you and he begins to
[1:26:04] reveal the entire thing to Abraham and
[1:26:07] Sarah the same one that read their
[1:26:10] hearts the same one who proved it was
[1:26:13] the Lord talking to them then turned and
[1:26:16] told them the future events of the earth
[1:26:20] my goodness church and I know there's a
[1:26:23] lot of prophets and I know there's a lot
[1:26:24] of people prophesying and some of it's
[1:26:25] real good cuz Spirit of Prophecy is true
[1:26:27] right Spirit of Prophecy exists it is
[1:26:30] the truth it is the spirit of God Amen
[1:26:32] but but when have you seen people who
[1:26:35] can who can who can actually prophesy
[1:26:37] the world
[1:26:38] events amen what what we around he
[1:26:40] wasn't just prophesying little things
[1:26:42] that was going to happen in our lives
[1:26:44] and little things in our church and
[1:26:46] things and that's a beautiful the spirit
[1:26:47] prophecy is beautiful but brother R
[1:26:49] would stand there and say now communism
[1:26:51] and Russia he said Iron Curtain and
[1:26:53] purple curtain and you know what he's
[1:26:56] talking about world
[1:26:58] movements and he's telling you how it's
[1:27:00] going to be and before it ever gets
[1:27:02] there what's going to take place hey
[1:27:04] I'll tell you this them driving's cars
[1:27:05] are getting real right now is that right
[1:27:08] they're getting real right now amen that
[1:27:11] woman president standing there she was a
[1:27:13] vice president but she was wearing
[1:27:14] purple and she swore amen it's real
[1:27:17] right now amen the Catholic systems took
[1:27:19] over America they never fired a shot
[1:27:22] but it's real right now and everything
[1:27:25] that Prophet said has been checked right
[1:27:27] off of the listen the only thing left he
[1:27:29] said she' be sitting in Boulders or
[1:27:31] smoldering in ashes but before she
[1:27:33] smolders in ashes there has to be a
[1:27:36] visitation of because it's a bride who
[1:27:40] will not be a part of the destruction it
[1:27:43] takes the son of man to the bride into
[1:27:46] the Rapture it's not the will of God
[1:27:49] that you go to judgment it's not the
[1:27:51] will of God you part of the destruction
[1:27:54] of America God Wills to change your body
[1:27:57] and make you a part of the ruring Mind
[1:28:00] glory be the god Ministry to find the
[1:28:04] anointing to tell us these things amen
[1:28:08] now here's the thing amen the prophet of
[1:28:10] God will tell us this according to
[1:28:12] Revelations 10 that this message is
[1:28:14] going to be given and it will be at the
[1:28:15] time of the sounding of the seventh
[1:28:17] angel if you like to read your Bible
[1:28:19] says Revelation the 10th chapter and the
[1:28:21] seventh verse
[1:28:23] and when these things will be revealed
[1:28:25] it will be the last
[1:28:27] days that's right amen it will be
[1:28:30] revealed in the last days and God will
[1:28:33] properly identify them to the
[1:28:36] church God will never require you to
[1:28:40] worship something he don't properly
[1:28:43] vindicate we are not worshiping at the
[1:28:46] altar of the unknown
[1:28:48] God he might be the Unseen God but he's
[1:28:51] not the
[1:28:53] unknown on this God has been made known
[1:28:58] to you and I and my man says it like
[1:29:00] this in the days in the third seal but
[1:29:02] Begins the teaching and he says look in
[1:29:04] the days when Jesus came he said look at
[1:29:07] this he said they missed it a million
[1:29:10] miles he said they they even missed John
[1:29:13] being
[1:29:14] Elijah and he says in the last days
[1:29:16] they'll do the same thing you know the
[1:29:19] scriptures tells us that the very dis
[1:29:22] deciples and Jesus missed
[1:29:24] it in Matthew the 17th chapter when they
[1:29:26] come off the mountain and mount
[1:29:28] Transfiguration they saw Jesus transfig
[1:29:30] and they come down they said Master we
[1:29:32] thought Elias was first come and he said
[1:29:35] and he came already and you knew it not
[1:29:38] to his
[1:29:39] disciples but then he said he shall come
[1:29:42] again and restore all things and spoke
[1:29:45] of the coming of Elijah in the last day
[1:29:47] brother said he was so humble even the
[1:29:49] apostles missed it what was it getting
[1:29:52] the day of the Lord Jesus amen the
[1:29:54] Pharisees the people amen they both
[1:29:56] missed the messenger and his message
[1:29:59] they missed the they missed the
[1:30:01] Forerunner and they missed the Messiah
[1:30:04] they didn't know they didn't only not
[1:30:05] know Jesus was a Messi they didn't know
[1:30:07] joh was John and the in the third seal
[1:30:10] brother saids watch he said when Jesus
[1:30:12] came he wasn't known NE the scripture
[1:30:14] said he came unto his
[1:30:16] own and his own knew him not now watch
[1:30:20] this because what we're looking at now
[1:30:23] brother BR says there's no need of me
[1:30:24] trying see if if if everybody's going to
[1:30:27] miss it now brother paints a picture the
[1:30:29] third seal is so powerful amen that you
[1:30:31] it looks like ain't nobody going to
[1:30:33] catch it do y'all know y'all know when
[1:30:35] Jesus came the first time and John
[1:30:37] introduced him y'all y'all recognize
[1:30:40] that it wasn't supposed to be a secret
[1:30:42] no true biblically like it was not
[1:30:45] promised to be a secret but on the other
[1:30:47] hand Isaiah said that there would be
[1:30:49] mountains that be made Low Places High
[1:30:52] high plac is low and he he describes
[1:30:54] geographical changes and it was going to
[1:30:57] be so publicized and so but brother said
[1:30:59] hardly anybody ever even knew Jesus was
[1:31:01] on the earth is that right and other he
[1:31:05] spells it out said the apostles missed
[1:31:06] it the Pharisees missed it the people
[1:31:08] missed it but watch he says so he says
[1:31:11] but we can get into the place where we
[1:31:13] say well if everybody's going to miss it
[1:31:15] why
[1:31:16] try because today it's promised to be a
[1:31:20] secret amen but if if God has made a
[1:31:23] promise to the church that it was going
[1:31:25] to be a secret said but why try he said
[1:31:28] that's the wrong kind of Faith he said
[1:31:31] the kind of Faith you're going to have
[1:31:33] to have is if there's only going to be
[1:31:35] one person get it I'm going to give it
[1:31:38] if there's only one person going to see
[1:31:40] it I'm going to see it see if there's
[1:31:42] only one going in the Rapture I'm going
[1:31:45] in the Rapture you see what it is he
[1:31:47] promised it see amen and there's the
[1:31:49] very thing when God makes a promise now
[1:31:52] the first bride that was on the earth
[1:31:54] now we talking about the will of God
[1:31:56] Amen the first bride that was on the
[1:31:58] Earth was eeve right and she fell in the
[1:32:01] garden of me but you got to ask yourself
[1:32:03] what she fell from all right what she
[1:32:06] fell from was the word amen that was her
[1:32:10] fault it was the fall was the word she
[1:32:13] fell from the word and before she could
[1:32:15] be married amen of course didn't she
[1:32:17] amen and still staying with the word now
[1:32:20] the prophet of God said that God who was
[1:32:22] full of Mercy this is powerful but God
[1:32:25] who is full of Mercy he said made a way
[1:32:28] to redeem that
[1:32:29] woman he promised her telling her in the
[1:32:34] future the true word would come to her
[1:32:37] again now the true word would be known
[1:32:39] to her again now watch when when Eve was
[1:32:42] fallen into the garden she fell from the
[1:32:44] word and God says to her the word will
[1:32:47] come to you again now before the word
[1:32:50] can come we know that was a woman seat
[1:32:52] right Christ but before he can come you
[1:32:54] know what what happens is God gives them
[1:32:58] substitutes remember brother said God
[1:33:00] called them to a conference he said but
[1:33:02] they didn't have nothing to wear they
[1:33:04] were naked right so he said he went out
[1:33:06] and found them in their condition and he
[1:33:08] said he took the Fig leaks off of them
[1:33:10] and killed two sheet skins and threw
[1:33:12] them into the bushes and said put them
[1:33:15] on for the conference so he gave them a
[1:33:18] substitute that they could stand in
[1:33:21] until
[1:33:22] the true word came to them so Moses's
[1:33:25] Tabernacle was a substitute of the real
[1:33:27] one the blood of the altar was a
[1:33:29] substitute of the real one the law was a
[1:33:32] substitute everything was a substitute
[1:33:35] amen but Jesus was the real thing he was
[1:33:38] the real Tabernacle he was the real
[1:33:40] blood he was the real man he was
[1:33:43] whatever should have been to begin with
[1:33:46] the promise was the word should have
[1:33:48] come through the W it should have come
[1:33:51] through
[1:33:52] Eve should have had
[1:33:54] Jesus but she traded off the word and
[1:33:57] she took the LIE of the enemy and he
[1:33:59] says but watch the word will come to you
[1:34:02] again but brother man says but when the
[1:34:04] word came to them he said they were so
[1:34:06] steep in their substitutes that they
[1:34:08] turned down the wheel and kept their
[1:34:11] substitute in other words they said to
[1:34:13] they said to them we got Moses can you
[1:34:15] imagine that God Moses prophesied was
[1:34:18] talking to them in the flesh and they
[1:34:20] were saying sorry brother we believe
[1:34:22] Moses and Jesus said you believe Moses
[1:34:25] and you believe Moses you believe me
[1:34:28] because Moses R me I don't condemn you
[1:34:31] Moses condemned you because I am what
[1:34:34] Moses talked about they said more the
[1:34:36] children of Abraham he said Abraham long
[1:34:38] to see my
[1:34:40] dad you see what it was amen the word
[1:34:44] had come to
[1:34:45] them said it was it was it was not a
[1:34:48] substitute it was the real but they
[1:34:51] wasn't ready to let go of the substitute
[1:34:53] to accept the we they miss it and they
[1:34:58] crucified they cut off the head of the
[1:35:02] messenger murdered the
[1:35:04] messenger amen and they crucified the
[1:35:07] messenger amen and look now brother says
[1:35:10] but watch he said but here's that
[1:35:12] Gentile Church born here it is born the
[1:35:15] second Eve is born there at Pentecost
[1:35:19] and he says now they're born he says
[1:35:21] they're coming back to the original word
[1:35:23] he said but then they're going to fall
[1:35:26] at NAA takes two be now this is
[1:35:28] important he takes two Eaves and he said
[1:35:31] one of them fell in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:33] from the word he said but Christ bride
[1:35:36] the second Eve fell at NAIA when she
[1:35:40] traded the word for the reasoning and
[1:35:43] Creeds and doctrines of man so she done
[1:35:46] in the New Testament the same thing that
[1:35:49] Eve done in the Garden of Eden she
[1:35:51] forsook the word amen but watch but
[1:35:54] brother R said but when she did it God
[1:35:56] already knew she was going to do it so
[1:35:58] he made a promise to the second Eve amen
[1:36:02] you will come to the word again that's
[1:36:05] why Malachi said I shall restore sayth
[1:36:08] the Lord that's why said I shall restore
[1:36:12] sayth the Lord listen before you ever
[1:36:14] fail before the genti ever fail God
[1:36:18] already made a plan to bring you back
[1:36:20] again
[1:36:22] it would take the word to restore the
[1:36:25] chur now watch brother says and in the
[1:36:28] absence of the word God gave a
[1:36:33] substitute there's your Baptist your
[1:36:35] Lutheran your Pentecostal there's your
[1:36:38] there's your traditions of the church
[1:36:40] all of those things are
[1:36:42] substitutes and just like the Pharisees
[1:36:45] of Le Ona when the real came they were
[1:36:49] so settled in the sub itute they didn't
[1:36:52] want to give up the substitute to take
[1:36:55] the real and so has Leia got so settled
[1:36:59] in the Creeds they got so settled in the
[1:37:01] Traditions it's already wrot books we
[1:37:03] already got schools we already got
[1:37:05] churches we already got everything we
[1:37:07] got it planned out how God's going to
[1:37:09] come and what he's going to do and all
[1:37:10] that but it was a mystery and God kept
[1:37:13] it a mystery and only a prophet can
[1:37:16] reveal the mystery they missed the whole
[1:37:18] thing and whenever Christ came in the th
[1:37:21] to the son of man you know what they did
[1:37:23] they kept the substitute and said we
[1:37:25] really don't need a
[1:37:28] prophet cuz we can shout
[1:37:31] right we can dance and we can have good
[1:37:34] meetings and we can H Hallelujah and you
[1:37:36] can't tell me that I'm lost cuz I'm
[1:37:38] cutting my hair cuz I feel
[1:37:40] you church that's what the prophet
[1:37:42] taught us he taugh us not on the end
[1:37:44] time he said the rain fallowing the just
[1:37:46] and the unjust alive and that's what
[1:37:48] they were doing back there in Pentecost
[1:37:50] man would prophesy the truth and they'd
[1:37:52] get up and sing in tongues and prophesy
[1:37:54] directly this what he was saying and
[1:37:56] then because they were anointed they
[1:37:58] would say we don't have to listen to you
[1:38:00] we don't have to listen to you William
[1:38:02] Bram because we're anointed you can't
[1:38:04] tell us we're lost you can't tell us
[1:38:06] we're dead but a prophet but a prophet
[1:38:08] was anointed to bring us back to the
[1:38:12] truth now I I want you to see something
[1:38:14] clearly because today people think about
[1:38:17] it like this they think well what we
[1:38:19] need to do is we we need to actually get
[1:38:22] the church see we we need to get them to
[1:38:25] Christ and then we can get them to the
[1:38:30] message now let's just let's just reward
[1:38:33] that we need to get them to the
[1:38:37] substitute because what people are
[1:38:39] thinking they're getting to Christ is
[1:38:41] the substitute that was waiting until
[1:38:44] the real Cen see God weaked the
[1:38:47] substitutes God weeped the inur of
[1:38:50] people and the denominations and he he
[1:38:52] turned his head while people baptized in
[1:38:55] trinary dockins and he gave him the Holy
[1:38:57] Ghost smoking pipes and every he was
[1:39:00] weing at the because they didn't know no
[1:39:03] better but there was coming a day when
[1:39:05] the truth would restor the church and
[1:39:08] you would have to stand subtitute when
[1:39:11] the Bible tells us that God will open
[1:39:13] these seals he would we the in no longer
[1:39:17] and we would have to leave the subtit we
[1:39:19] would have to leave it behind move into
[1:39:22] the word move into the realities of the
[1:39:24] word of God listen my says it he said
[1:39:27] that substitute would work until the
[1:39:29] time the
[1:39:32] original can I can I just say something
[1:39:34] to you we've been in dispensational
[1:39:36] change
[1:39:37] now we we crossed the
[1:39:40] Jordan and we have moved into the
[1:39:43] Sun the administration I I I I say it in
[1:39:46] different ways we say it like this it's
[1:39:48] the administration of the son of man now
[1:39:50] if you're in a if you're in a real small
[1:39:51] town and you go and you go up to the
[1:39:54] county courthouse and they have a
[1:39:55] license department the title of parment
[1:39:57] and they they may just have one they may
[1:39:59] just have one little office there totle
[1:40:01] Department Revenue Office everything's
[1:40:03] right there and they may just have one
[1:40:05] clerk working there you walk up to the
[1:40:06] office you say to them hey look I like
[1:40:08] the title my truck they said well we
[1:40:10] can't do it here at at the T at the at
[1:40:12] the license you got to go over to the
[1:40:13] title department first and they you said
[1:40:16] where's the ti Department say well down
[1:40:17] to end the town and that same person
[1:40:20] take off one hat put on another and
[1:40:22] slide their chair down there now they
[1:40:24] can do it in this place but they
[1:40:26] couldn't do it in that place Heen you
[1:40:28] see God Amen was changing offices it was
[1:40:32] the same God it was the same God but he
[1:40:36] had a different office and God has
[1:40:39] revealed himself under a prophetic word
[1:40:42] in this age that has brought us back to
[1:40:45] ex but Paul talk in the beginning we do
[1:40:49] not have another gospel there is not
[1:40:52] another gospel there is only one gospel
[1:40:55] and the message of the hour has restored
[1:40:57] the
[1:40:59] Church we're not standing here with I
[1:41:02] we're standing here with exactly what
[1:41:04] Paul taught in the beginning under the
[1:41:09] original you see Jesus
[1:41:12] proved he proved what was the real he
[1:41:16] Vindicated what was the real he was
[1:41:19] promising to be the red but now here's
[1:41:21] the thing that they fail from the word
[1:41:25] what will restore a church that fail
[1:41:27] from the
[1:41:28] word word the
[1:41:30] word if you fail from the word the only
[1:41:34] way to get back is the word if it was
[1:41:37] the word we lost it's the word we got to
[1:41:40] be have restore and here's the thing you
[1:41:43] can give the badst and God bless the
[1:41:44] Baptist for all the good things they do
[1:41:46] but you can give them 2,000 years and
[1:41:48] they can't put us back give the
[1:41:51] Pentecost 3,000 years and they never
[1:41:53] shout us back but you give a prophet to
[1:41:56] the church and that Prophet can restore
[1:41:59] the church to the original Mind Of God
[1:42:02] by the
[1:42:04] word I shared this with the church I
[1:42:06] think it's a great example I think that
[1:42:08] that if you ever see what true
[1:42:10] Vindication is it helps you on helps you
[1:42:12] on everything you you know uh we had a
[1:42:15] chance to visit Israel and uh while we
[1:42:17] were while we were there we went and
[1:42:19] they have now a temple Institute which
[1:42:20] is kind of like the old s00 Council and
[1:42:23] they they actually are putting together
[1:42:25] the tools for the temple like um they're
[1:42:28] putting together the shovels and the
[1:42:30] manura they got a gold one man it's no
[1:42:33] telling thousands of or million dollars
[1:42:35] it's worth but it's beautiful and they
[1:42:37] got the they got the ash pans and the
[1:42:38] shovels and the altar abrasions built
[1:42:42] they got the ramps built it's pretty
[1:42:43] neat cuz we wouldn't even seen it all
[1:42:45] it's all laid out amen but they were
[1:42:47] working on this blue curtain it was a
[1:42:49] neatest thing
[1:42:51] because the curtain to go into the H H
[1:42:53] blue right but here's the problem what
[1:42:57] shade of blue oh now you look across
[1:43:00] this congregation you see blue blue blue
[1:43:02] blue blue and there all kinds of shades
[1:43:04] of blue now can you imagine that your
[1:43:07] whole life as ministers are dedicated to
[1:43:10] figure out what shade of blue that
[1:43:12] is so you read every book amen and and
[1:43:16] it's so carnal that they're breaking
[1:43:18] down every cind they're breaking down
[1:43:20] every l they're dedicating hours of
[1:43:22] prayer and study to figure out what kind
[1:43:24] of plant bases were what kind of Shades
[1:43:27] amen their whole lives is dedicated and
[1:43:29] and and it's and it's and one of them
[1:43:31] maybe maybe they put 30 years on it and
[1:43:34] he comes in and says it's this shape for
[1:43:36] sure and another guy comes in and say
[1:43:38] well I've been working 22 years myself
[1:43:41] and no no no it's not that shape it's
[1:43:43] this shape and another guy over here
[1:43:46] said well I I got a group of 100 guys
[1:43:48] and we sat down and figured this out and
[1:43:50] it's this and another guy said well no
[1:43:53] it ain't that we got 10,000 over here
[1:43:56] and they've been studying night and day
[1:43:57] and they say it's this well if you was
[1:43:59] the guy making the decision amen you're
[1:44:02] going to go oh my
[1:44:04] goodness what amen how in the world he
[1:44:08] says it's that he says it's that and he
[1:44:10] says it's that and they've all got good
[1:44:12] reasons why it is what it is but you
[1:44:14] know what if Moses can walk in the room
[1:44:16] for 5
[1:44:17] minutes if Moses can be there 5 minutes
[1:44:20] Moses can walk in that room and say this
[1:44:23] is the shade of blue thus sayith the
[1:44:25] Lord you don't have to study your whole
[1:44:27] life you don't have to fast and pray
[1:44:29] your whole life you have now got the
[1:44:32] answer listen to me people have tried to
[1:44:35] figure out predestination for 2,000
[1:44:38] years we got volumes of books written on
[1:44:41] predestination but God sent us a
[1:44:45] prophet say the Lord this is
[1:44:48] predestination should we be
[1:44:51] Face Forward backward mer sprinkle
[1:44:53] should it be in father son Holy Ghost
[1:44:55] should it be in Bap should it be should
[1:44:57] it be in the church be but long comes
[1:45:00] the prophet of God and gives us
[1:45:04] an the Lord we're not
[1:45:08] laying right we're not laying wonder if
[1:45:11] I God is right because God sent us
[1:45:16] a the mystery of his coming gave us the
[1:45:20] Myst of his will the will of God on our
[1:45:23] lives the will of God on how to set our
[1:45:26] churches up on how to have in our church
[1:45:29] what to do what not to do how a pastor
[1:45:32] how how we going to do it the headship
[1:45:35] is
[1:45:36] come come this church
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:44] and what he had in his
[1:45:47] mind not what I think not what you think
[1:45:51] is what he had in his mind a prophet has
[1:45:54] come Among Us and took the back part of
[1:45:56] God's mind and said this is that that
[1:46:00] was prophesied this is how it should be
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:04] hand this is what it should
[1:46:07] be now here's the thing in third seal
[1:46:11] you can catch this point very quickly
[1:46:13] brother said but what they missed was
[1:46:14] the Incarnate Word that's what they
[1:46:16] missed that's right now watch he says
[1:46:19] what we're going to do
[1:46:21] is we're going to see justification
[1:46:23] that's part of restoration right and
[1:46:25] then he said we're going to see
[1:46:26] sanctification and then he said we'll
[1:46:28] come to the baptism of the spirit he
[1:46:31] said but then we have to see the
[1:46:32] Incarnate Word and in another way he'll
[1:46:35] say justification Make Way for
[1:46:37] sanctification and sanctification make
[1:46:39] way for the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:46:41] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:46:43] himself he brought the son of man in
[1:46:46] Perfection to the church am not just a p
[1:46:50] ISM of a spirit but a word that would
[1:46:53] direct the church right back to the mind
[1:46:56] of God we are not confused tonight we're
[1:46:59] not sitting here wondering what this is
[1:47:01] and how this is what that is if you're
[1:47:03] confused it's because you got more than
[1:47:05] one voice and I think it's time to get
[1:47:08] back to the original voice of this I
[1:47:11] don't care what has to about it I don't
[1:47:13] care what so and so has to say about it
[1:47:16] we go back to feeling a voice of a
[1:47:18] prophet we would go back to knowing
[1:47:21] exactly what say for the
[1:47:25] here I tell you what you can do you can
[1:47:27] set listen to people long enough you
[1:47:29] start wondering what truth
[1:47:31] is some people got under a godhead
[1:47:33] teacher and they was teaching them there
[1:47:34] was to LS you got to you got to speak to
[1:47:37] the father you got to speak to the son
[1:47:39] you
[1:47:39] got after a little while poor little
[1:47:42] poor little woman sit down to pray over
[1:47:43] her food and she can't figure out how to
[1:47:45] even pray now because somebody's made
[1:47:47] such a deal either praying for the
[1:47:49] father or praying for son PR amen don't
[1:47:51] you know these three are one the prophet
[1:47:54] of God these three are one he said not
[1:47:59] theology theology is wrong
[1:48:02] a we got we got to theological just come
[1:48:08] the prophet of God and stand on what he
[1:48:10] said about it he said there is one Lord
[1:48:13] there is one fath there is one baptism
[1:48:16] there is one gospel there is one Lord
[1:48:18] Jesus Christ and there is app
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:27] to now here's the thing now if you
[1:48:30] missed that Incarnate
[1:48:33] Word you just missed your
[1:48:36] Revival on you just missed your Revival
[1:48:41] I'll tell you why the prophet of God in
[1:48:42] the third seal says this he said there
[1:48:44] hasn't had a Revival for the ride GI
[1:48:47] because there's been no manifestation of
[1:48:49] God distur her up that's 1963 in March
[1:48:53] sir let me just let me just rehearse
[1:48:55] something to you amen look at what has
[1:48:58] been done in the ministry of William
[1:49:01] brandom up to March of 1963 the dead
[1:49:04] have been raised the L have walked
[1:49:06] thousands have been saved there has been
[1:49:08] outpouring after outpouring after
[1:49:10] outpouring we don't even have me listen
[1:49:13] he filled up the biggest auditoriums in

[1:53:52] of the word what was on the earth he
[1:53:54] said he walked up to Peter and he said
[1:53:56] Peter was in those
[1:53:59] substitute he said but he had had a
[1:54:01] scripture T to him by his old
[1:54:03] daddy that when the Messiah comes he'll
[1:54:06] be like this and he didn't carry a
[1:54:09] picture of him that's right he didn't
[1:54:11] have a he didn't have a h in his picture
[1:54:13] he carried his purse or his pocket or
[1:54:15] something like that when Jesus
[1:54:17] walked he didn't have that he had
[1:54:20] scriptural
[1:54:22] description and when that old fisherman
[1:54:25] who never had a day theology who
[1:54:28] couldn't write his name who had no
[1:54:31] education who had no scholarly a
[1:54:34] position of any the churches that old
[1:54:37] fisherman was talking Amen to the
[1:54:39] Messiah himself and the Messiah looked
[1:54:42] at him he says hey he said your name was
[1:54:45] Simon that the J and from now on I'll
[1:54:48] call you p
[1:54:50] amen said what happened to him he said
[1:54:53] the light flashed across the sea he said
[1:54:57] you see how long that took he said it
[1:54:59] didn't take long at all did it he said
[1:55:01] because the seed was already there
[1:55:04] waiting on
[1:55:07] light come on it didn't take an all
[1:55:09] night prayer meeting it didn't take a re
[1:55:12] wor of Revival the the light touch the
[1:55:15] sea said it like this he said that light
[1:55:18] roll back to out he takes it to the
[1:55:20] little woman at 12 now if you watch if
[1:55:23] you watch brother B he's not just he's
[1:55:26] not just picking certain things for
[1:55:28] without reason he picks Peter who's the
[1:55:32] Jew and then Jesus goes to a Samaritan a
[1:55:35] woman at the wh yeah and he says to her
[1:55:40] bring me your husband she said well I
[1:55:42] don't have one he said that's right
[1:55:44] youve had five the one you're living
[1:55:45] with now is not your own brother said
[1:55:48] what he done with that that say is he
[1:55:50] rolled the doubt off of that seed he
[1:55:54] rolled
[1:55:56] the the clouds of doubt that was
[1:55:59] covering the seed of five husbands and
[1:56:02] her current life was only covering
[1:56:05] eternal life seed that was in her and
[1:56:08] when he rolled it away said look how
[1:56:10] long it took the moment the life struck
[1:56:13] the seed he said because the seed was on
[1:56:16] the
[1:56:17] in out she didn't e all day pray she had
[1:56:23] s she she need to come man she knew
[1:56:28] Authority when she
[1:56:30] saw now brother does it in the third
[1:56:32] seal and the fourth seal if you'd like
[1:56:33] to study he does it in both seals third
[1:56:35] and fourth and he says exactly that was
[1:56:38] what happened back there in the
[1:56:39] beginning when God created the heavens
[1:56:41] and the Earth and was without form of
[1:56:43] void and what Darkness covered the Earth
[1:56:45] he said now watch he said the seeds were
[1:56:48] already in the Earth
[1:56:50] he said the water was only covering what
[1:56:53] was already there so when he said let
[1:56:55] there be light he rolled back the
[1:56:57] darkness so the light could get to the
[1:57:00] Sea and exactly what happened at that
[1:57:03] well that day when that little woman
[1:57:04] walked up there and she stood in front
[1:57:06] of the great Son of God who was the
[1:57:09] light of all the ages and that light
[1:57:11] rolled the darkness back and the moment
[1:57:14] that doubt was lifted off of her the
[1:57:16] seed come to life eternal germ seed
[1:57:21] watch watch what takes place there and
[1:57:25] y'all know to tell you the truth some of
[1:57:26] you was convinced of this message first
[1:57:28] time you heard
[1:57:30] it some of you my dad sat back here grew
[1:57:32] up as a little baptist boy took himself
[1:57:34] to church cuz his his mom and dad didn't
[1:57:36] go to church much took himself to church
[1:57:38] and sat down that Baptist Church and
[1:57:39] wondered what was about predestination
[1:57:42] what happened in the garden why is there
[1:57:43] people talking about one God and three
[1:57:45] gods and and that little Baptist Church
[1:57:47] didn't have the answers they were doing
[1:57:48] good it was a good little group good
[1:57:49] good brother good people but they didn't
[1:57:51] have the answers for it they didn't know
[1:57:53] how to get the darkness off of the sea
[1:57:56] and remember back about 1964 amen Emma
[1:57:59] Emma Faith walked in and be to introduce
[1:58:01] the message to my mama amen and the
[1:58:03] spirit of God be to move and and my dad
[1:58:06] said this he said some people run around
[1:58:08] the message while back and they were
[1:58:09] saying that you didn't have to love
[1:58:10] brother man get the Rapture I don't know
[1:58:11] what that about but but Dad come to me
[1:58:13] later he said H I'm sorry he said but if
[1:58:16] You' been like me he said I was standing
[1:58:18] like a Bo and a dark closet he said and
[1:58:21] when I heard Willam R begin to describe
[1:58:24] the Garden of Eden and the and the and
[1:58:26] the and the godhead he said it's like
[1:58:28] somebody walked in and turned the light
[1:58:30] on and all the darkness just went away
[1:58:33] listen the voice of this message willp
[1:58:36] all the dark itel all the town it'll
[1:58:39] tell you who God is it'll tell you who
[1:58:42] you
[1:58:46] are it'll take the KN out give you a
[1:58:49] higher thought now you got to you got to
[1:58:51] see something because because the
[1:58:52] gentile people wasn't expecting why
[1:58:54] didn't Jesus go down to the Gentiles
[1:58:56] went to them Jes and then Spar why did
[1:58:58] they go to them Gentiles brother man
[1:59:00] said because Gentiles were not expecting
[1:59:02] the Messiah right right but from that
[1:59:05] time remember Paul began to preach and
[1:59:09] they begin to expect the Messiah and
[1:59:12] that's why God had to send the message
[1:59:15] in this hour listen we are not looking
[1:59:17] for a messiah we has found the Messiah
[1:59:21] it's not a man it's God it's the Holy
[1:59:24] Ghost here to leave the
[1:59:27] church
[1:59:29] ration Revelation what is it amen down
[1:59:32] in that little heart is a predestinated
[1:59:34] sea that Spirit moved away that past
[1:59:38] life oh brother that seed can rise up
[1:59:41] and live that's what brother Ram said he
[1:59:43] said when the true Vindication the
[1:59:45] revealed truth of God's word strikes
[1:59:47] that heart he'll strike the water and
[1:59:49] out with the Holy Ghost as hard as it
[1:59:51] can go you can't stop him from doing it
[1:59:54] because there's new life working in
[1:59:56] him I love how brother Ram says that he
[1:59:59] said your name is now in the new book on
[2:00:02] the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb what he
[2:00:05] redeemed I love this one IND thisal
[2:00:07] union he said with the anointed word of
[2:00:09] God being Vindicated before any man
[2:00:11] that's born a Son of God with a
[2:00:14] predestinated German here for this hour
[2:00:16] he'll see God's message as sure as
[2:00:18] there's a God in
[2:00:22] heaven you'll never hide this because it
[2:00:25] was put in there by
[2:00:28] predestination you never hide the
[2:00:30] message from a from a true ger gen
[2:00:33] Gentile seed of God you never do it amen
[2:00:35] you can you can pile whatever you want
[2:00:37] to but the anointed word of this day
[2:00:39] will
[2:00:40] speak and he said my sheep know my voice
[2:00:44] is all right it'll speak it'll be the
[2:00:46] voice of God that was what was coming
[2:00:49] from that stranger at the wall that
[2:00:52] stranger at the wall went from a
[2:00:55] stranger but when he begin to talk to
[2:00:57] Joshua he began to take off his shoes
[2:01:00] because he was talking to the captain of
[2:01:02] the host that was that same stranger
[2:01:05] that stepped down on the road to AAS and
[2:01:07] they thought they were visiting with a
[2:01:09] stranger but the longer that he visited
[2:01:11] with at the end of the journey and said
[2:01:14] it's the resurrected Messiah it was a
[2:01:17] stranger in the sky when the little
[2:01:19] Eagle looked up and saw that strange
[2:01:22] bird but when the voice of the eagle
[2:01:24] begin to cry he began to say my
[2:01:28] God the voice of God is sounding to the
[2:01:33] church and it may sound like a stranger
[2:01:36] at
[2:01:38] first after a little while something
[2:01:42] inside that
[2:01:44] heart let me say this to
[2:01:46] you John now in in the Bible the Bible
[2:01:51] says he that have the
[2:01:54] bridegroom he says he that has a bride
[2:01:57] is the
[2:01:59] bridegroom but the friend of the
[2:02:01] bridegroom which standeth and hear
[2:02:03] rejoices
[2:02:05] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[2:02:07] voice oh yeah this my joy therefore is
[2:02:13] fulfilled and now watch the next verse
[2:02:16] John says it like this and he must
[2:02:20] increase and I must
[2:02:23] increase now John did that in the first
[2:02:26] coming of the Lord and he said there's a
[2:02:29] difference between the bridegroom and
[2:02:31] the friend of the
[2:02:32] bride and that friend will rejoice at
[2:02:35] the sound of the bridegroom's voice and
[2:02:39] when he hears that bridegroom's voice he
[2:02:41] said John begin to decrease and the
[2:02:44] bridegroom begin to increase do you know
[2:02:47] that William BR on the end of his
[2:02:48] ministry begin to decrease do you all
[2:02:51] realize that Brother begin a decline
[2:02:54] around the world in his ministry and he
[2:02:56] told us why he said because there won't
[2:02:58] be two of us here at the same time he
[2:03:00] said I'm going to decrease and he's
[2:03:02] going to increase and let me ask you
[2:03:04] this when Willam Bron was here how many
[2:03:06] people were sting listening to sermons
[2:03:08] like this and understanding what they
[2:03:10] were
[2:03:11] hearing but in this generation there are
[2:03:15] thousands of Believers that are
[2:03:18] receiving the coming of the Messiah by
[2:03:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and see
[2:03:23] the son of man come among them and
[2:03:25] manifest his word in this amen what is
[2:03:28] it it's an increase now I I'll just say
[2:03:31] this just maybe maybe just to make some
[2:03:33] things plain here because of the
[2:03:35] bridegroom's voice that was what the joy
[2:03:38] of the friend of the bridegroom was now
[2:03:40] William Braham was not the
[2:03:43] bridegroom right he was the
[2:03:46] friend that's right right he was the one
[2:03:49] introducing him amen do you see this
[2:03:53] brother tells us this that the voice of
[2:03:55] God sounds through the word amen now can
[2:03:59] I I'll just I'll just make it uh just as
[2:04:01] let me just put it to you like this so
[2:04:03] brother B standing here and prophesy
[2:04:05] something all right now now that you
[2:04:08] hear you hear the prophet's voice yeah
[2:04:11] but when you see it
[2:04:13] fulfilled that's the voice of God
[2:04:15] sounding
[2:04:17] back see it's one thing for the prophet
[2:04:20] to speak the
[2:04:22] word that's the man but when it comes
[2:04:25] back fulfilled that's God so so brother
[2:04:30] says see the friend of the bridegroom
[2:04:34] rejoices at the sound of his voice in
[2:04:37] other words he was showing you that
[2:04:40] Christ is here by the Fulfillment of the
[2:04:43] word here's the scripture that is the
[2:04:45] Fulfillment he's here how he do brother
[2:04:49] said how do we recognize his presence
[2:04:51] you know these quotes how do we
[2:04:54] recognize his presence whole message on
[2:04:56] how can we recognize his presence he
[2:04:58] said when the word is fulfilled among
[2:05:02] you that that is the presence of God he
[2:05:05] is appearing to release his desires amen
[2:05:10] that you have in him I think it's
[2:05:12] powerful because right here in the
[2:05:13] middle of this brother R begins to show
[2:05:15] that the Revelation coming is what
[2:05:17] brings the joy
[2:05:19] and there's a lot of talk in the last
[2:05:20] days about worship and things like
[2:05:23] thaten but you we got to just get real
[2:05:25] for a moment and when brother says what
[2:05:27] we need to do as Christians is realize
[2:05:29] we're saved he said then get down to the
[2:05:31] basis of why we were saved and how we
[2:05:34] were saved and what it means to us as
[2:05:36] Christians is that right amen and I
[2:05:38] think tonight amen just as the Church of
[2:05:40] the Living God as we receive this great
[2:05:42] voice Among Us amen sometimes people
[2:05:46] misunderstand I shout it and sometimes
[2:05:49] people misunderstand our rejoicing and
[2:05:52] our worship amen but but but be assured
[2:05:55] friend amen that the rejoicing and the
[2:05:58] shouting of the bright church amen is
[2:06:01] coming from the message of
[2:06:05] Yahweh let me let me let me give you
[2:06:07] what brother B says in the third seal
[2:06:10] it's it's something it's something
[2:06:11] powerful to write out in the third seal
[2:06:14] the prophet of God says in the middle of
[2:06:16] that third seal he said there's a voice
[2:06:18] that comes out out of there and says
[2:06:19] hurt not the oil and the wine how many
[2:06:22] those said that the scripture says that
[2:06:25] hurt not the oil or the wine how many
[2:06:28] knows who said that brother R said the
[2:06:31] Beast he says was talking to John he
[2:06:33] said they were out here he said but this
[2:06:36] one stood up from among the throne he
[2:06:38] said it was the lamb himself the voice
[2:06:42] of the Lamb spoke out in the age and
[2:06:46] said hurt not the oil and the wine now
[2:06:50] brother said what does oil mean don't
[2:06:52] hurt oil what does that mean he said oil
[2:06:55] means the Holy Ghost oil is a type of
[2:06:59] the Holy Spirit don't touch the spirit
[2:07:03] of God in the
[2:07:04] church I can put up with a lot of things
[2:07:07] folks that when I hear somebody bing up
[2:07:10] against the move of God something inside
[2:07:12] of my heart just turns over I cannot
[2:07:15] stand to hear somebody amen coming
[2:07:18] against God God's worship and God now
[2:07:20] there's a reason being it's because I
[2:07:23] understand where it's coming from if you
[2:07:25] were walking down that Hall and you just
[2:07:27] started screaming you're just walking
[2:07:28] down that Hall and you start screaming
[2:07:30] maybe two or three of these deacons to
[2:07:32] get up to look out there to see what
[2:07:34] caused you to scream they're looking for
[2:07:36] what caused you to act like that amen
[2:07:39] and instead of worrying about you
[2:07:40] screaming we need to find out what's
[2:07:42] causing the scream let me tell you
[2:07:44] what's causing the screaming in the
[2:07:47] church in the last days it is the oil of
[2:07:50] the Holy Ghost is in the church and C A
[2:07:56] stimulation of the revelation of the
[2:07:59] word of God in our hearts said r word
[2:08:04] causes stimulation the wine represented
[2:08:08] revealed word causing stimulation says I
[2:08:11] know how he says it he I'm just simp
[2:08:13] Heil so heiling things help me and he
[2:08:16] said this he said this spiritual wine
[2:08:18] called the new wi he says and the reason
[2:08:23] they call it this he said because he
[2:08:25] says see natural wine has an effect on a
[2:08:29] person when they drink it it makes them
[2:08:32] go
[2:08:33] unseemingly they act unseemingly when
[2:08:36] they drink it so the scripture was using
[2:08:39] Revelation as a symbol of wine because
[2:08:43] when God gives you a revealed word it
[2:08:46] makes a person act un sing is there
[2:08:49] something somebody you take a pretty
[2:08:52] quiet person amen they to stand on their
[2:08:54] feet and scream out and Shout amen and
[2:08:56] they wonder what made me do that well it
[2:08:59] was a revealed word struck a place in
[2:09:01] your heart and something on the inside
[2:09:03] of you had to give V and pulation the
[2:09:07] same way and I'm I'm I'm I'm going with
[2:09:09] a prophet here third and four seal both
[2:09:11] he does and you know what brother R says
[2:09:13] he says it has the same effect as
[2:09:15] natural wine on a man well let me say
[2:09:17] this amen amen if you want a quiet
[2:09:19] Church you better not pass out the
[2:09:22] wine go
[2:09:24] ahead if we invited 120 people in here
[2:09:27] tonight and we UNC the bottle and we
[2:09:30] gave everybody a Giff of wine and they
[2:09:33] drink on that wine a while what kind of
[2:09:35] group you think it'd be after a little
[2:09:38] while it'd be people staging around here
[2:09:39] saying I love you I love here let me
[2:09:44] give you $100 I love you oh God and
[2:09:48] somebody be crying another guy cathine
[2:09:50] laughing somebody staggering around and
[2:09:53] amen it was like that on the day of
[2:09:55] Pentecost when the promise of God come
[2:09:57] among them and they saw them and they
[2:10:00] thought they were drunk and Peter said
[2:10:02] oh this is the new W this is come on
[2:10:07] church this is the W the Holy Ghost and
[2:10:11] the hold the word and the two come
[2:10:13] together it'll cause something to happen
[2:10:16] in the Church of the Living God I tell
[2:10:18] you this I'm sorry people get upset I've
[2:10:21] had people say why people stand up and
[2:10:23] harder in your meetings and stuff what
[2:10:25] in the world's going on what what is it
[2:10:27] listen I'm sorry if this message has
[2:10:29] power I'm sorry now some people water
[2:10:33] this thing down until they don't have
[2:10:35] any power and they add all their Creeds
[2:10:37] and all their dogas and and you feel
[2:10:39] more like you've been beat up when you
[2:10:42] leave amen but if you preach this
[2:10:44] message exactly the way God gave this
[2:10:47] message it'll have an effect upon the
[2:10:50] church of living and you'll see a
[2:10:52] stimulation a revelation stri the heart
[2:10:55] of the church and Jesus said don't you
[2:11:00] touch don't touch the all and the
[2:11:06] wi I got some little masas out here but
[2:11:09] this is all they got I got some little M
[2:11:12] that they watch kids all day and they
[2:11:15] suffer and they got nerves and they're
[2:11:16] built up and they don't know what to do
[2:11:18] with theirselves and they don't go down
[2:11:19] to the bar and drink and they don't take
[2:11:21] the ner pills and they don't go down to
[2:11:23] the psychologist but they look at their
[2:11:25] wies and they read the sermons and then
[2:11:28] they come into a meeting somewhere amen
[2:11:30] and they and they they went through hell
[2:11:32] to get there and they come and sit on
[2:11:34] the meet and all of a sudden the Holy
[2:11:35] Ghost picks up something they've been
[2:11:37] studying and the spirit of God begins to
[2:11:39] WHL around them and something get the
[2:11:42] little heart say hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:46] hallelujah don't touch
[2:11:48] [Applause]
[2:11:51] Al
[2:11:52] [Applause]
[2:11:59] church I believe it I believe it says
[2:12:03] here in Revelation 66 to hurt not the
[2:12:05] oil in the
[2:12:07] wind Paul said don't quench the
[2:12:11] spirit quch not the spirit of God is
[2:12:16] that sound you said let me I I'll help
[2:12:18] us understand as heal with this again
[2:12:20] did you ever build a fire you ever build
[2:12:22] a fire if you build a fire let's just
[2:12:24] say you build a fire out in your dad's
[2:12:25] front yard there's two ways to quench a
[2:12:27] fire number one thing you can do is take
[2:12:29] a take a a blet blanket or water hose
[2:12:32] and just spray it
[2:12:34] down and there are words that people
[2:12:39] say exactly and God help us sometimes
[2:12:43] creatures and they take a water hole to
[2:12:45] the fire of
[2:12:47] God and the poor little child the poor
[2:12:50] person it's all the fire the God and
[2:12:53] somebody spray water on it and 90% of
[2:12:56] the reason they're doing it brother Ben
[2:12:57] is cuz they watched the YouTube
[2:12:58] somewhere and they saw some meeting they
[2:13:00] don't agree with and they go to their
[2:13:04] churches and correct the crowd because
[2:13:07] what they want to do is correct that
[2:13:08] crowd and what I say is quit being a
[2:13:10] coward and go down there and correct
[2:13:12] that brother and leave the all and the
[2:13:14] wine
[2:13:16] alone
[2:13:22] that fire can be neglected two ways you
[2:13:24] can put water on it and the other way to
[2:13:26] neglect it or to quench it is just don't
[2:13:28] put nothing on
[2:13:30] it just don't put no wood on it and
[2:13:32] you'll quench it just don't add nothing
[2:13:35] to it and you quench it but I think we
[2:13:37] ought to take some fire quotes once in
[2:13:39] while I think we ought to take some
[2:13:40] Holocaust quotes
[2:13:42] once people strong instead ofing out
[2:13:46] instead of not giving them any
[2:13:49] on that and say that's right that's
[2:13:52] right you got a to the Holy Ghost you
[2:13:55] got to the power of God list we are not
[2:13:58] a deal
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:01] church I'm pastor of Church in Ohio I
[2:14:04] don't know how many we got up there I
[2:14:05] don't want to sound off but but there's
[2:14:07] there's several people there and let me
[2:14:09] say this we got some quiet people in our
[2:14:10] church we got some Qui people saying we
[2:14:13] really do but I ain't got one former
[2:14:15] person that whole
[2:14:16] church I got some quiet people in there
[2:14:19] that pull the button right off your
[2:14:20] shirt they don't hard to say one word
[2:14:23] with their Spirit just like just like
[2:14:25] brother Harvey sitting there he's
[2:14:26] sitting there pulling and pulling and
[2:14:28] pulling he ain't saying a lot but his
[2:14:30] Spirit saying a lot because something on
[2:14:33] the inside CAU fire years ago and this
[2:14:36] message feels as much die as you got God
[2:14:42] say the Holy
[2:14:45] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost I say give God
[2:14:48] Liberty and let the quiet people be
[2:14:50] quiet let the loud people be loud let
[2:14:53] the shout shout let the
