[38:13] said my father he said here am I my son
[38:16] he said behold the fire and the wood but
[38:19] where's a lamb for the burnt offering
[38:21] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[38:24] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[38:27] they went both of them together and they
[38:29] came to the place which God had told him
[38:31] of and Abraham built an altar there and
[38:33] laid the wood in order and bound Isaac a
[38:35] son laid him on the altar upon the wood
[38:37] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[38:39] took the knife to slay his son and the
[38:42] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[38:44] heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said
[38:46] here am I he said lay not thy hand upon
[38:49] thy lad neither do thy thing unto him
[38:51] for now I know that thou fearest God
[38:53] seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son
[38:55] thy only son from me and Abraham lifted
[38:58] up his eyes and looked and behold behind
[39:01] him a ram caught in a Thicket by his
[39:03] horns and Abraham went and Tuck the RAM
[39:06] and offering him for the burnt offering
[39:08] into instead of his son and Abraham
[39:10] called the name of this place Jehovah
[39:12] Gyra as he said to this day in the mouth
[39:15] of the Lord shall B it shall be seen and
[39:19] the angel of the Lord called unto
[39:20] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[39:23] and said by myself I have sworn sayeth
[39:26] the Lord for because thast done this
[39:28] thing and H has not withheld thy son thy
[39:31] only son that in blessing I Will Bless
[39:34] thee and multiplying I'll multiply the
[39:37] seed as the stars of the
[39:39] Heaven and the sand which is upon the
[39:42] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[39:46] gates of his enemies amen God bless you
[39:49] just ask the Lord to bless the reading
[39:52] of his word tonight
[39:55] and we last time we was with you we
[39:58] shared a few things with you and uh ma
[40:02] just uh here maybe two months ago and I
[40:05] think brother Matt was uh maybe on
[40:07] vacation I took a service for him and uh
[40:10] I I Minister on I give you the land and
[40:13] and uh on this trip we uh we got to
[40:15] diing back into these things and and uh
[40:18] just been just a stirring on my heart
[40:21] and just seen the Holy Spirit uh move uh
[40:25] and in our meetings uh and North
[40:27] Carolina and South Carolina and just
[40:30] just pray the Lord can bless you the
[40:32] same tonight and I know he's a he's a
[40:35] god when he's moving he's moving and we
[40:37] was we was actually
[40:39] um at both locations brother Matt at at
[40:42] brother Josh's and brother Luke Gibson's
[40:44] and and uh it it's it's strange because
[40:47] you hear the same things that you hear
[40:48] here when we brother Mt vites feels led
[40:51] to invite somebody here and brother Ben
[40:53] it's not a coincidence a lot of times
[40:55] that uh that brother said man that guy
[40:58] just picked up where I left off or he he
[41:00] started dealing with the same things I
[41:02] was dealing with and and we find the
[41:05] that's just the mind of God and and
[41:07] God's moving and we heard those things
[41:09] this weekend and I couldn't put it
[41:11] together but God put it together and
[41:13] we've seen the the sick healed and
[41:15] delivered and I believe the Lord's just
[41:17] moving in a special way for the Bride of
[41:19] Jesus Christ can you say
[41:21] amen and we' like to pick some of those
[41:24] thoughts up tonight and and and maybe
[41:26] carry just a little father by by by
[41:29] God's grace tonight and if you'll just
[41:31] bear with me tonight but we took this
[41:34] scripture here in the 17th verse that
[41:37] the Lord is telling Abraham this is
[41:40] unconditional that blessing I Will Bless
[41:43] thee and multiply and multiply and I'm
[41:45] going I'm going to bless thy seed and
[41:47] they're going to possess the gates of
[41:49] their enemy and we realize tonight this
[41:52] is beautiful tonight that you as a
[41:55] Believer can escape the bless
[41:57] blessing there's nothing in time sister
[42:00] Eve can prevent you from receiving the
[42:03] blessing or The Inheritance that God had
[42:07] in his mind before the foundation of the
[42:09] world he told us that the seat of
[42:11] Abraham was promis to possess the gates
[42:15] of his enemy and brother BR would say it
[42:18] like this brother Morgan when the when
[42:20] the Red Sea became a gate God came on
[42:23] the scene and removed the gate because
[42:26] the gate was blocking access or
[42:29] preventing the children of God from
[42:31] their blessings and they cannot escape
[42:34] the blessing that God has already given
[42:37] them before the foundation of the world
[42:40] and he would tell us God moved upon the
[42:43] scene and Tuck the gate and went away
[42:46] with it so there's no weapon that is
[42:49] formed against you can prosper we
[42:52] believe that God is a consuming fire
[42:55] amen God will consume anything that
[42:58] stands in between you and your promises
[43:02] amen for you as a Seed of Abraham cannot
[43:06] escape the blessings that God has
[43:09] bestowed upon you amen and we realize
[43:12] tonight that nothing in time can prevent
[43:15] you from inherent the blessing Moses
[43:18] couldn't escape it the three Hebrew
[43:20] children could escape the blessings of
[43:22] God Amen Daniel couldn't escape the
[43:25] blessings of God and I believe Brother
[43:27] David you and I here tonight in Grace
[43:29] Tabernacle amen that God has a blessing
[43:32] for you tonight and no imagination no
[43:35] conscience no memory no feelings amen
[43:38] can block you tonight if God's got a
[43:40] predestinated blessing for you tonight
[43:43] guess what sister Vana you're going to
[43:45] receive
[43:46] it amen God pre pre-ordained this
[43:50] service before the foundation of the
[43:53] world Amen and here we are tonight

[43:59] something special for Grace Tabernacle

[44:04] because two or three are gathered in his
[44:06] name and expecting God to move whether

[44:43] Strange Land and that is not their
[44:47] own God begin to tell them that I will
[44:50] deliver them with a mighty hand and it's
[44:53] a promise and it's unconditionally
[44:58] but there came a time that had come a
[45:01] jubilee Exodus and that's what my God is

[56:08] hallelujah an inheritance listen this I
[56:11] I'm fixing to
[56:13] preach
[56:14] inheritance by
[56:19] predestination inheritance by
[56:22] predestination in other words he forn
[56:25] knowledged he had knowledge of it so he
[56:28] predestinated it he gave you the
[56:31] inheritance listen what he says he says
[56:34] what it what what inheritance they had
[56:37] somebody to Lead Me inheritance he says
[56:41] you say Jesus left you an inheritance he
[56:45] said I beg your pardon Jesus never left
[56:49] me an
[56:51] inheritance what a statement he said he
[56:54] didn't leave you an inheritance either
[56:56] right he only come down to pay for your
[57:04] inheritance he listen he said he brought
[57:06] it to you he bought it to you he brought
[57:10] it to you but your name was put on the
[57:13] land's book of life before the
[57:16] foundation of the world God gave your
[57:20] inheritance The Inheritance he gave was
[57:23] first and Jesus came
[57:26] to make the inheritance
[57:31] real isn't that
[57:34] beautiful and time nothing in time can
[57:38] hold your
[57:42] inheritance glory to God I feel like
[57:45] praising praising God
[57:50] hallelujah he says Jesus didn't give you
[57:54] inheritance you a got your inheritance
[57:58] before the foundation of the
[58:00] world and you as a Believer can escape
[58:04] the
[58:07] blessing amen Brothers you can run for a
[58:12] season but God's going to find
[58:15] you you can hide under denominationalism
[58:18] you can hide under feelings you can hide
[58:20] in Mama and Daddy but there's going to
[58:23] come a predestinated time why because he
[58:27] can not lose a one of
[58:30] you you might have win a straight for a
[58:33] season because somebody preached
[58:36] somebody done you wrong somebody
[58:38] preached something wrong to you you lost
[58:41] confidence in Preachers you lost
[58:42] confidence in churches come on come
[58:46] on and Satan might have held your joy
[58:49] for a season and held your happiness for
[58:53] a
[58:54] season but if he received it in time he
[58:58] can never hold it if you receive
[59:01] something in time it's here today and
[59:04] gone
[59:06] tomorrow that's the reason why a lot of
[59:08] people can come to church and receive a
[59:10] good blessing and go out amen and go
[59:13] back to their sins go back to the the
[59:15] ways of their old life all
[59:19] right they feel the emotions they feel
[59:22] it but what happened to
[59:24] you what happened happen to you have you
[59:28] ever thought of this this this this
[59:31] before before today have you ever
[59:33] thought why God raised up brother Matt
[59:40] Morris and
[59:42] feel a desire an unction years after he
[59:47] begin ministering to open up this
[59:50] Tabernacle and you was laying out there
[59:52] and seeing somewhere laying out there
[59:55] and and and and and and beaten down by
[59:58] hell beaten down by the devil and no joy

[1:00:04] happiness but this is the way God works
[1:00:07] oh bear with me tonight I got some
[1:00:08] Liberty tonight God God begin to work

[1:19:43] all down through the Bible Paul was
[1:19:45] ridiculed brother Brandon was still
[1:19:47] ridiculed men of God are always ridicule
[1:19:50] they're always knocked down cuz Satan
[1:19:52] hates

[1:20:03] your your your church members yes sir he
[1:20:05] doesn't like
[1:20:07] you but it really doesn't matter what he
[1:20:10] likes just Jordan doesn't matter what
[1:20:12] the world thinks about you come on it
[1:20:14] doesn't change your value amen amen amen
[1:20:19] sir cuz our value don't come from time
[1:20:21] our value comes from eternity
[1:20:25] and there's something there that's
[1:20:26] backing you
[1:20:28] up yes sir but no I asked you if you
[1:20:31] wanted that $100 what would you
[1:20:35] say oh didn't he didn't say it very loud
[1:20:38] but he said
[1:20:40] yes sure he does but it doesn't matter
[1:20:43] what I do to it I can W it up I can say
[1:20:47] no you still want this $100 bill oh
[1:20:51] yeah I can drop it as a world and they
[1:20:54] can Stomp on it that's good they can put

[1:21:04] because the circumstan doesn't change
[1:21:06] the value yes sir amen there's a go
[1:21:10] somewhere backing this up and and he
[1:21:13] knows it and that's the way I believe
[1:21:16] the message of the hour has come to let
[1:21:18] you know your true value doesn't matter
[1:21:22] what the world thinks about you it does
[1:21:24] doesn't matter what the the churches
[1:21:26] think about you God seen value in a
[1:21:30] woman with five husbands and the one
[1:21:33] that she was living with wasn't her own
[1:21:36] but she held
[1:21:38] value there's gold somewhere backing her
[1:21:42] up she had
[1:21:45] representation when everybody else
[1:21:47] didn't warn her God says she's a value I
[1:21:51] right before the foundation of the world

[1:54:49] Moses made it down to the daughter of
[1:54:52] Pharaoh's house and
[1:54:55] became Lord God a powerful man in
[1:55:00] Egypt to depart from Egypt for a journey
[1:55:04] out in the desert and meet the pillar of
[1:55:07] fire and brother Bram said Moses lacked
[1:55:11] what the pill of fire had Lord it took
[1:55:15] out everything that's unlike him all the
[1:55:17] military experience he
[1:55:19] had Lord and you gave him a rod in his
[1:55:22] hand

[1:55:26] in ours and he went down
[1:55:30] and a jubilee
[1:55:33] Exodus to lead God's people out of
[1:55:37] bondage into a promised
[1:55:39] land and that was where Caleb went
[1:55:42] Hebron
[1:55:43] Lord he embraced that land he went over
[1:55:47] God's evidence of his promised land and

[2:03:59] of the worship amen what a a mighty God
[2:04:02] I think just a wonderful message brother
[2:04:06] Joe delivering some some I'll just call
[2:04:08] it like this Bible principles amen amen
[2:04:11] that you belong to God and you were
[2:04:13] created of God before the foundation of
[2:04:15] the world and no I didn't tell brother
[2:04:17] Joe our phone conversation but God knows
[2:04:20] amen he knows what we have need of Amen
[2:04:22] do you believe that I believe God can
[2:04:24] directly speak to our heart and answer
[2:04:26] questions that we asked that no man
[2:04:28] would have an answer to but God that's
[2:04:30] our God and God is Sovereign and God
[2:04:33] comes in the when you're least expect it
[2:04:35] and he speaks to your heart and he he
[2:04:37] settled something in your mind that
[2:04:39] you've been struggling with or questions
[2:04:41] that you had and and he'll use the
[2:04:43] weakness of our flesh isn't that
[2:04:44] something the ignorance of preaching the
[2:04:46] Bible said or the foolishness of
[2:04:48] preaching that men are saved I believe
[2:04:50] that's our God we don't have a we don't
[2:04:53] have a a thought coming but God is God
[2:04:55] is a God that can take men and and out
[2:04:57] of the mouth of men God can SP he can
[2:05:00] still speak to us a't he a wonderful God
[2:05:03] Amen I just thank him for it it just
[2:05:05] amazes me what God is able to do when we
[2:05:08] surrender to his will amen I just love
[2:05:11] the Lord I appreciate that message you
[2:05:13] know he said that God had it in control
[2:05:15] all the time and M if you had time just
[2:05:17] to preach the uh the the message of the
[2:05:20] River of Life what a powerful thought
[2:05:22] that is of going down the River of Life
[2:05:24] and directing all the uh the things that
[2:05:26] would come our way and I believe that
[2:05:28] one day we'll sit over on the other side
[2:05:31] and the Lord will show us all the things
[2:05:32] that we didn't even know he did can you
[2:05:35] imagine sitting there you got all
[2:05:36] eternity for God to say you know all
[2:05:38] that time you thought I wasn't doing
[2:05:39] anything but look at all this stuff God
[2:05:41] was doing I love hearing those stories
[2:05:44] about all the the different avenues that
[2:05:46] God takes and and we don't even know why
[2:05:48] it's happening but God has it all in
[2:05:50] control I believe believe that you know
[2:05:52] in in 2002 the the Congress uh there was
[2:05:56] an act of Congress by that was led by
[2:05:58] George Bush called the No Child Left
[2:06:00] Behind Act and they purposed that there
[2:06:02] wouldn't be any child that didn't have
[2:06:04] any education they wouldn't be left
[2:06:05] behind in any of the schools and you
[2:06:07] know there's been great debates on
[2:06:08] whether that was whether it came to pass
[2:06:11] or whether it would F or succeed or
[2:06:13] whether it would fail but I thought you
[2:06:14] know long before that God had a No Child
[2:06:16] Left Behind that and it certainly
[2:06:18] succeeded because Jesus said I've never
[2:06:21] wasn't one that the father ever given me
[2:06:23] that won't come to me and when he comes
[2:06:25] to me I will not cast him out but all
[2:06:27] that the father has given me they will
[2:06:29] come unto me you know why because we
[2:06:31] belong to God and he has never left a
[2:06:33] child behind do you believe that tonight
[2:06:36] I believe that God had a message for our
[2:06:37] heart to let you know when you belong to
[2:06:39] God he don't leave you behind he ain't
[2:06:41] going to leave you out but everything he
[2:06:43] promised you is going to come to you
[2:06:45] amen can you praise the Lord for it
[2:06:47] tonight isn't he wonderful God Amen how
[2:06:50] you enjoyed that message tonight amen it
[2:06:53] really spoke to my heart amen I I know
[2:06:56] the Lord really used brother Joe tonight
[2:06:58] and and spoke some things that he
[2:06:59] wouldn't even be be privy to I'm not
[2:07:01] that kind of a pastor I've never no one
[2:07:04] ever counsels with me that I repeat it
[2:07:06] to somebody else I don't talk about it
[2:07:08] to other brothers it it it go I don't
[2:07:11] talk about it with my wife it goes to
[2:07:12] the Grave that's between you and me and
[2:07:14] the Lord but I know God knows what we
[2:07:16] have need of Amen I believe that I
[2:07:18] believe you you can always rest assured
[2:07:20] that when the Lord's speaking to you cuz
[2:07:22] sometimes it's so direct you had to tell
[2:07:24] them but it's just the Lord that's the
[2:07:26] way the Lord works I appreciate God for
[2:07:28] that amen do you love him tonight amen
[2:07:31] we just look forward to the service
[2:07:33] Sunday and going to do our best to
[2:07:35] deliver our Christmas message to you on
[2:07:38] Sunday morning what the Lord's put on
[2:07:40] our heart and and certainly looking
[2:07:42] forward to that and I really I really
[2:07:45] enjoy uh this time of year I enjoy the
[2:07:47] fellowship and uh I've always always
[2:07:50] kind of been a little bit of s y uh for
[2:07:52] Christmas time and and I love the you
[2:07:55] know the joy that it brings and that's
[2:07:56] what it should do that's what the
[2:07:58] Christmas story ought to bring and I
[2:08:00] know the world has tried to change it to
[2:08:02] something else but no matter what they
[2:08:03] change it to we still have a Christmas
[2:08:05] story and it's still real and and I'm so
[2:08:08] thankful for all that that God has uh
[2:08:11] done for us and so just be praying and
[2:08:13] you know if you can give somebody a
[2:08:15] extra encouragement or something in this
[2:08:17] season it would be a a good thing to do
[2:08:19] a little gift a little word or a text or
[2:08:22] a uh just just a word of encouragement I
[2:08:25] believe that's that's what we're called
[2:08:26] to do Amen to be a light in a time of
[2:08:29] darkness and so here uh we have an
[2:08:31] opportunity and we just we just thank
[2:08:33] each one of you for all that you do for
[2:08:35] the Lord and I just be praying about our
[2:08:37] services upcoming and also our trip
[2:08:40] there to India I know some had had given
[2:08:43] to support the trip and we certainly
[2:08:46] appreciate that and it's all welcomed
[2:08:48] and so we we actually have to take care
[2:08:51] of the the service and the venue those
[2:08:52] Brothers a lot of the uh the in or the
[2:08:55] money to do that they don't have the
[2:08:57] ability to do so we're trying to uh
[2:09:00] assume that that debt just to be able to
[2:09:02] make sure that we have a meeting of
[2:09:04] several thousand people that we'll be
[2:09:06] able to minister to and just a few days
[2:09:08] and so I believe that God has something
[2:09:10] in store uh for them as well and so we
[2:09:13] certainly appreciate the support in that
[2:09:15] so let's just bow our heads together and
