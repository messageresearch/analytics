[51:38] i appreciate each one coming out this

[51:43] the bible says this luke 17 11
[51:46] and it came to pass as he went to
[51:48] jerusalem
[51:50] that he passed through the midst of
[51:51] samaria and galilee
[51:54] and as he entered into a certain village
[51:56] there met him ten men
[51:58] that were leopards
[52:00] which stood afar off
[52:02] and they lifted up their voices and said
[52:04] jesus
[52:05] master
[52:07] have mercy on us
[52:10] and when he saw them he said unto them
[52:12] go show yourself unto the priest
[52:15] and it came to pass that as they went
[52:18] they were cleansed
[52:20] and one of them when he saw that he was
[52:23] healed
[52:24] he turned back and with a loud voice
[52:27] glorified god
[52:30] and he fell down on his face at his feet
[52:33] giving him thanks
[52:35] and he was a samaritan
[52:37] and jesus answering he said well there
[52:40] are not ten cleansed
[52:43] but where
[52:44] are the nine
[52:47] they are not found that return to give
[52:49] glory to god
[52:51] save this stranger
[52:54] and he said unto him arise and go thy
[52:57] way
[52:58] thy faith have made thee whole
[53:03] let's bow our heads
[53:05] i want to speak to you for a few minutes

[53:26] god and beside thee there is
[53:29] none other
[53:32] and lord it is with thanksgiving in our
[53:35] hearts that we bow our heads to the dust
[53:37] from which you brought us lord
[53:40] knowing dear god that no matter what we
[53:43] face in this life lord
[53:45] we do not face it alone
[53:48] for you promised us in your word you
[53:51] would never leave us nor forsake us
[53:55] and lord as we have gathered here this
[53:57] day lord
[53:59] and set aside this
[54:00] sunday for a fellowship dinner of
[54:03] thanksgiving lord
[54:06] oh god we want to thank you for all that
[54:08] you've done for us lord
[54:11] for while i was yet a sinner
[54:14] you died for me
[54:17] and lord we asked your blessings upon
[54:20] our precious brother matt lord and his
[54:22] family dear god and this congregation
[54:25] and lord we ask that signs and wonders
[54:28] would be brought at the hands of the
[54:30] believers that this area would know that
[54:32] thou art god
[54:35] lord we pray today for those in need
[54:39] her brothers and our sisters lord who
[54:42] are hurting because they've lost loved
[54:44] ones to this pandemic lord may you
[54:46] comfort their hearts
[54:49] and those dear god that are sick and
[54:51] afflicted
[54:52] may you heal them lord
[54:55] and father those that would be nervous
[54:57] and may be weary of all that's happening
[55:00] god and the oppression
[55:02] may you come and lift him up today lord
[55:05] that there would be thanksgiving upon
[55:07] their lips
[55:08] because you are our god our healer and
[55:11] our deliverer
[55:14] lord we ask you god that you would take
[55:16] this congregation and myself lord and
[55:18] this this simple little broke up thought
[55:22] oh god may you bless us today lord we
[55:24] pray
[55:26] and we'll be careful lord to give you
[55:28] praise and honor and glory
[55:30] for we ask these things in jesus name
[55:33] and the bride says
[55:35] i mean god bless you saints you may be
[55:36] seated
[55:39] you know brother matt was telling us
[55:40] that after church today that we're going
[55:43] to have a thanksgiving dinner
[55:46] for the for the church and i was
[55:47] thinking about that and as i was
[55:49] thinking about thanksgiving you know
[55:51] we're getting close to that time and
[55:53] it's a shame you know that
[55:55] because of commercialism and because of
[55:57] profit that they just overrun
[55:59] thanksgiving and already putting up
[56:01] christmas stuff which
[56:03] it's kind of sad because really
[56:04] thanksgiving is truly the only
[56:06] protestant holiday that there is
[56:09] all other holidays is by the catholic
[56:11] church if you'll study it you'll find
[56:12] that to be true
[56:14] and so i was thinking along these lines
[56:16] and and i got to thinking about all that
[56:19] i have
[56:21] and i was sitting in the hotel room last
[56:23] night and i got to thinking about all
[56:25] that god has done for me
[56:29] and all that we've got to be thankful
[56:32] for
[56:34] and so i thought i'm just going to go to
[56:36] the pulpit today and i just want to say
[56:39] thank you lord
[56:41] i just want to give you thanks
[56:45] for the bible says in psalm 69 i will
[56:48] praise the name of our god with a song
[56:51] and i will magnify him with thanksgiving
[56:54] so i want to magnify his name today with
[56:57] thanksgiving in my heart i want to lift
[56:59] my voice in the midst of the
[57:01] congregation and i want to say thank you
[57:04] lord for all that you've done for me i
[57:07] want to thank you for his goodness i
[57:08] want to thank him for his faithfulness i
[57:11] want to thank you for his mercy i want
[57:13] to thank you for his love
[57:15] i want to thank you for his long
[57:17] suffering i want to thank you for his
[57:18] forgiveness
[57:20] you know when you begin to think about
[57:22] all that he's done for us we begin to
[57:24] realize that there's not enough hours in
[57:26] the day to really thank our god
[57:30] we could never thank him enough amen
[57:33] the bible says in the book of psalms
[57:35] know you that the lord he is god it is
[57:38] he that has made us and not we ourselves
[57:41] we are his people
[57:44] well that's enough to be thankful for we
[57:47] are his people and the sheep of his
[57:50] pastor
[57:51] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[57:53] and enter his courts with praise be
[57:56] thankful unto him and bless his name
[58:02] in our scripture reading we find that
[58:04] the lord is coming to this village
[58:07] and as he enters in they are these ten
[58:10] leopards who are standing afar off
[58:13] now these leopards they were marked men
[58:17] to be a leopard was to be an outcast
[58:20] it was to be rejected
[58:23] it was a death sentence
[58:26] separation from family
[58:28] separation from friends
[58:30] separation from the village
[58:32] you were shunned and when they went into
[58:35] the village they had to cry out unclean
[58:39] unclean to give everybody a warning
[58:42] don't get around me
[58:46] so they were standing afar off
[58:48] because of their condition
[58:53] but i'm so thankful this morning
[58:57] that when others would shun us
[58:59] when they say that we were hopeless case
[59:02] that we were too far gone i am so glad
[59:05] and so faithful that we have a god that
[59:08] will come to us
[59:10] [Applause]
[59:11] who will still stand still for the
[59:14] biggest drunk in arkansas for the
[59:16] biggest come on somebody for the biggest
[59:19] prostitute in arkansas we serve a god
[59:21] who'll still stand still when someone
[59:24] will cry out
[59:28] oh my
[59:29] crying out for deliverance for
[59:31] restoration
[59:32] regardless of our situation he will
[59:35] still hear our hearts cry
[59:39] so these tens standing up far off they
[59:42] begin to cry unto jesus saying master
[59:45] have mercy upon us
[59:48] and jesus tells them go to the priest
[59:51] and show thyself clean
[59:54] you see he was telling them to fulfill
[59:57] the law of leprosy
[59:59] because according to leviticus chapter
[1:00:01] 13 the priest would examine you and
[1:00:05] declare
[1:00:06] that you were clean
[1:00:08] they wanted to be clean and he told them
[1:00:12] obey the law of moses
[1:00:17] you want your healing you've got to come
[1:00:19] god's way amen
[1:00:22] there is a way provided for every one of
[1:00:25] us amen but you must come god's provided
[1:00:29] way
[1:00:30] god is not moved by sensation god is not
[1:00:33] moved by emotion god will never move on
[1:00:36] us because of pity but faith moves god
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:44] and so they went as they went along
[1:00:46] their way
[1:00:48] they become clean
[1:00:50] the leprosy left them
[1:00:52] but why because they were obedient to
[1:00:55] what he told them to do
[1:00:57] and when they saw that they were clean
[1:01:00] can you just imagine the joy
[1:01:03] that all it was is the disease that your
[1:01:05] fingers would fall off and your nose
[1:01:07] would fall off and your ears would fall
[1:01:09] off and all it was from being a
[1:01:12] contaminated individual that couldn't
[1:01:14] get around anybody till all at once
[1:01:16] they're in their skin was like a baby
[1:01:19] skin can you imagine the joy
[1:01:21] no more rejection no more separation
[1:01:24] restored back to the community restored
[1:01:27] back to the families
[1:01:29] and when the samaritans saw that he was
[1:01:32] cleansed
[1:01:33] i don't know what the other nine went i
[1:01:35] don't know where they went i i don't
[1:01:36] know what they did but this one
[1:01:38] samaritan
[1:01:41] when he realized he was healed
[1:01:43] when he realized he was free
[1:01:47] oh if you could only realize this
[1:01:48] morning the bible says whom the son hath
[1:01:51] made free is free indeed amen
[1:01:55] when he realized he was free
[1:01:58] he began with a loud voice
[1:02:00] to praise god
[1:02:04] you know it's a shame that people can
[1:02:05] get excited and scream at a ball game
[1:02:08] and people accept that but you get happy
[1:02:11] to scream in church and they look at you
[1:02:12] like you've lost your mind
[1:02:15] but i don't know about you friends
[1:02:16] pigskin don't excite me too much
[1:02:18] basketball don't excite me too much but
[1:02:20] when i start seeing what god has done
[1:02:22] for me and my family i start getting
[1:02:25] excited everywhere
[1:02:29] i may not care about the volunteers i
[1:02:31] may not care about the razorbacks but
[1:02:33] there's one i do care about and that's
[1:02:35] god's word amen
[1:02:38] hallelujah he began with a loud voice to
[1:02:40] praise god and the bible said he fell
[1:02:43] down at his feet and began to thank him
[1:02:48] you can see his desire to express his
[1:02:51] thankfulness with a loud voice he fell
[1:02:53] on his face giving thanks to jesus
[1:02:57] and jesus says
[1:03:00] wasn't there 10
[1:03:02] wasn't there 10 that needed a miracle
[1:03:05] wasn't there 10 that needed to be free
[1:03:09] wasn't there 10
[1:03:11] that i touched
[1:03:16] was there not 10
[1:03:18] where are the other nine
[1:03:22] oh god don't let me be that way
[1:03:25] if god has done something for me god
[1:03:27] give me the courage to testify
[1:03:33] that were the other nine healed yes
[1:03:36] i believe they were did they lose their
[1:03:38] healing no i don't believe they did they
[1:03:40] were still healed
[1:03:43] he never took their healing away from
[1:03:44] him you know because the bible says in
[1:03:46] luke 6 35 but love ye your enemies and
[1:03:50] do good and lend hoping for nothing
[1:03:52] again and your rewards shall be great
[1:03:54] and you shall be the children of the
[1:03:55] highest for he is kind to the unfaithful
[1:03:59] and to the evil
[1:04:02] he is kind to the unthankful that's the
[1:04:05] kind of god that we serve he is kind to
[1:04:08] even those that are thankful
[1:04:11] that was 10 healed but only one turned
[1:04:14] back to say
[1:04:16] thank you
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:18] where was the gratitude
[1:04:20] of the other nine
[1:04:23] and i was thinking about that and i
[1:04:26] thought if that's not the attitude of
[1:04:28] this nation today
[1:04:30] unfaithful ungrateful
[1:04:33] the bible says in second timothy 3 this
[1:04:35] know also that in the last days
[1:04:37] pearlesce time shall come for men shall
[1:04:40] be lovers of their own selves
[1:04:42] you know like selfies
[1:04:45] lovers of their own self covetous
[1:04:47] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:04:51] to parents
[1:04:52] unthankful unholy
[1:04:55] without natural affection honey that's
[1:04:58] not something that's coming it's here
[1:05:00] now amen
[1:05:01] truth breakers false accusers
[1:05:03] incontinent means they have no control
[1:05:06] fairest despisers of those that are good
[1:05:09] trendy uh traitors heavy high-minded
[1:05:11] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:05:13] god having a form of godliness but
[1:05:16] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:05:19] away this is the hour that we're living
[1:05:21] here a generation of unthankful people
[1:05:24] you hardly see anybody bowing their
[1:05:25] heads and thanksgiving for their food
[1:05:27] anymore you go to a restaurant you
[1:05:29] hardly see anybody that'll pray over
[1:05:31] their food but let me tell you something
[1:05:32] brother sister do not be ashamed to bow
[1:05:35] your head because one day you'll never
[1:05:37] know you'll never realize how many times
[1:05:40] that prayer before you ate kept you from
[1:05:42] food poisoning
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:45] hallelujah
[1:05:46] let them laugh at us let them call us
[1:05:48] what they want to call us i want to bow
[1:05:51] my head and thank my god amen
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:57] amen
[1:05:58] brother branham said you sit down at a
[1:06:00] table
[1:06:01] he said never eat never eat
[1:06:05] without thanking him for it
[1:06:08] i see many people call themselves
[1:06:09] christians and yet they never return
[1:06:12] thanks
[1:06:14] just as illiterate as a hog under an
[1:06:16] apple tree a hall could sit on an apple
[1:06:19] tree and they eat apples all day long
[1:06:21] and those apples will beat him on the
[1:06:22] head
[1:06:23] and he'll eat till he can't grunt no
[1:06:25] more the prophet said but he'll never
[1:06:27] look up to see where they're coming from
[1:06:31] oh my just like thanksgiving day many
[1:06:34] people today never thought the prophet
[1:06:36] said tens of thousands times thousands
[1:06:38] and millions of americans eat dinner
[1:06:40] today in a thanksgiving celebration with
[1:06:43] a turkey on the table and never as much
[1:06:46] offer a blessing or return
[1:06:48] of faith
[1:06:50] a nation of ungrateful unholy unthankful
[1:06:55] but oh god i don't want to be like that
[1:06:58] i don't want to be ungrateful i don't
[1:06:59] want to be unthankful
[1:07:03] i don't want his blessings to become
[1:07:05] common to me i want to thank him i want
[1:07:07] him to know that i appreciate it
[1:07:11] the bible says in hebrews 13 by him
[1:07:13] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:07:16] praise to god continually that is the
[1:07:18] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[1:07:20] name how often continually thanking god
[1:07:24] for his blessings and his goodness of
[1:07:26] life
[1:07:27] so i want to come this morning and just
[1:07:29] take a little bit of time
[1:07:31] to thank him
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:36] and there's just just a few things
[1:07:38] i could sit down and brother matt could
[1:07:40] get up and he could sit down and brother
[1:07:41] mark could get up and he could sit down
[1:07:43] and brother david could get up and he
[1:07:44] could sit down and sister so-and-so
[1:07:46] could get up and on and on and on and
[1:07:48] come into the night and the next day or
[1:07:50] the next day and never get done thanking
[1:07:53] him for the blessings he's given to our
[1:07:55] lives
[1:07:57] but just for a few minutes just to pull
[1:07:59] a few things out
[1:08:00] that i want to thank my god for
[1:08:05] i want to thank you for salvation
[1:08:10] but the bible says in romans but god
[1:08:12] commendeth his love towards us that
[1:08:15] while we were yet sinners christ died
[1:08:18] for us
[1:08:19] much more than being now justified by
[1:08:21] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:08:25] through him
[1:08:27] oh he ill
[1:08:29] he is our escape door hallelujah he is
[1:08:32] the god who owns the issues of death and
[1:08:36] you look at word issue of it means the
[1:08:38] escape he is the exit door out of this
[1:08:42] world
[1:08:45] we
[1:08:45] shall be saved from the wrath by passing
[1:08:49] through the exit door for unto him
[1:08:52] belongs the issues of death david said
[1:08:55] while i was yet a sinner he sought me
[1:08:58] out
[1:09:00] just like he did you
[1:09:02] just like he did his first son adam
[1:09:04] in the garden of eden
[1:09:06] when god had to be true to his holiness
[1:09:08] and true to his word when even adam had
[1:09:11] done evil when god himself it wasn't
[1:09:14] adam he was hiding from god
[1:09:17] but it was god himself who ran up and
[1:09:20] down the garden hollering adam adam
[1:09:23] where art thou adam
[1:09:27] if somebody wants to know who jesus
[1:09:29] really is
[1:09:31] let me ask you something who was it that
[1:09:33] come hunting for the first lost son
[1:09:38] who come honey for adam it was not the
[1:09:40] angels
[1:09:42] no no no it was god himself
[1:09:47] god himself come looking for his first
[1:09:49] lost son and god himself through the
[1:09:52] skin of a body named jesus came looking
[1:09:55] forever adam that was ever lost upon the
[1:09:58] earth
[1:09:59] don't you see who up looking for you not
[1:10:02] a preacher not an avenger not a prophet
[1:10:05] but god himself make flesh amen
[1:10:09] hallelujah he come looking for me

[1:13:13] i want to thank him
[1:13:14] for his ability
[1:13:16] to remember
[1:13:18] amen jeremiah 2 1 says this moreover the
[1:13:20] word of the lord came into me saying go
[1:13:23] and cry
[1:13:24] in the ears of jerusalem saying thus
[1:13:27] saith the lord
[1:13:29] i
[1:13:30] remember
[1:13:31] thee
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:36] the prophet said the ever remembering
[1:13:38] god remembers every promise of his word
[1:13:41] said oh i like to preach on that see god
[1:13:44] don't forget nothing concerning his word
[1:13:47] though it looks like sometimes
[1:13:50] that he does
[1:13:52] but yet god never forgets a promise
[1:13:58] he told noah it's going to rain
[1:14:00] 120 years went by but it rained you know
[1:14:04] why god said so
[1:14:06] he told isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[1:14:09] how long 800 years after he spoke it
[1:14:14] and god remembered
[1:14:16] his promise
[1:14:19] he told moses that israel been there 400
[1:14:22] years they had to go up at that time he
[1:14:24] told abraham his seed would sojourn in a
[1:14:26] strange land for 400 years
[1:14:29] then he'd bring them out with a mighty
[1:14:31] hand
[1:14:32] he told father abraham your seed will
[1:14:35] sojourn in a strange land they will
[1:14:37] afflict them they will beat them they
[1:14:39] will persecute them but i will deliver
[1:14:42] them saith the lord
[1:14:45] go with me
[1:14:47] for a few minutes
[1:14:49] to the mud pits of egypt
[1:14:51] and hear the cry of the people who have
[1:14:54] been placed
[1:14:55] in bondage
[1:14:58] i see an old man stomping the straw into
[1:15:00] the mud
[1:15:02] to make brick for pharaoh cities it just
[1:15:05] seemed like he can't
[1:15:07] stop
[1:15:08] stomping
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:13] i can't
[1:15:14] hardly go
[1:15:16] i can't hardly make one more stomp into
[1:15:19] this mud
[1:15:21] did you hear the crack of a whip
[1:15:23] and his cry as it strikes his old back
[1:15:27] and a voice cries out work dog or you'll
[1:15:30] die in the pit today
[1:15:33] someone yells out take courage old man
[1:15:36] cut
[1:15:37] deliver us
[1:15:40] and someone yells out how long are we
[1:15:42] going to hear that
[1:15:43] i see no deliver around here nothing
[1:15:46] ever changes someone else says god will
[1:15:48] remember he will remember his promise
[1:15:53] so the cry
[1:15:55] goes up
[1:15:56] before god
[1:15:58] and now we hear a different cry
[1:16:00] it is the cry
[1:16:02] of a baby
[1:16:04] and someone says it's a boy
[1:16:07] it's a boy a hebrew male child that was
[1:16:10] certain death
[1:16:12] but somehow his mother knew he was
[1:16:14] different perhaps it was the light that
[1:16:16] came into the room
[1:16:17] the morning he was born
[1:16:20] she tries to hide him but after three
[1:16:22] months she can't hide him anymore and
[1:16:24] knowing that god had delivered noah by a
[1:16:26] boat or by an ark she builds an ark and
[1:16:28] places her baby in the bark of this
[1:16:30] basket
[1:16:31] and pushes it out into the river and
[1:16:33] what happens to that basket the hand of
[1:16:36] god grabs it and begins to direct that
[1:16:38] basket and he takes it right straight
[1:16:40] into pharaoh's palace just as pharaoh's
[1:16:43] daughter who had just lost a child came
[1:16:46] down to bathe in the water and the
[1:16:48] basket floated right up to her
[1:16:51] and she took the lid off
[1:16:54] it's a baby
[1:16:58] and she said the gods have given me a
[1:17:00] baby but you see she had it wrong it
[1:17:02] wasn't the gods it was the guard
[1:17:07] and she picked it up and she said i
[1:17:09] shall call you and she heard a voice no
[1:17:11] doubt say
[1:17:12] moses
[1:17:15] i should call you
[1:17:16] moses
[1:17:18] one taken from the water
[1:17:20] and his sister who followed the basket
[1:17:22] was in the reeds
[1:17:24] and she said no i'm going to need you
[1:17:25] know they didn't have bottles in that
[1:17:27] day so i'm going to need a wet nurse i'm
[1:17:29] going to need someone to nurse this baby
[1:17:30] and marion goes
[1:17:32] steps right out of the reeds
[1:17:34] she said your highness my mother
[1:17:36] immersed that baby
[1:17:38] what's that you say child my mother
[1:17:40] she'll nurse that baby
[1:17:42] oh she take good care of this baby oh
[1:17:44] yes ma'am she'll treat it just like it
[1:17:46] was her own
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:54] what was it
[1:17:55] god's promise was unfolding and 40 years
[1:17:59] went by
[1:18:00] and we find down in the mud pits not one
[1:18:03] thing has changed
[1:18:05] still stomping out the mud
[1:18:07] still making bricks for the cities
[1:18:10] and someone cries out take courage
[1:18:12] brothers
[1:18:13] remember the promise
[1:18:16] someone said where is the promise of our
[1:18:18] deliverance somebody else yeah maybe he
[1:18:20] meant spiritual maybe we're already
[1:18:22] delivered
[1:18:25] listen friends when god makes a promise
[1:18:27] we don't need to cut it up squeeze it up
[1:18:29] to make it fit we don't need to
[1:18:31] interpret ourselves god doesn't need our
[1:18:33] help god can keep any promise that he's
[1:18:36] made he's just looking for somebody who
[1:18:39] will believe him amen
[1:18:43] well i know some of you seen the ten
[1:18:45] commandments you know in that scene
[1:18:46] where the old man's in there in the pits
[1:18:48] and he can't stomp no more and you know
[1:18:50] he starts to rebel and he throws the
[1:18:52] dagger and stabs him in the side and
[1:18:54] moses happened to be down there and he
[1:18:56] jumps into the mud pit and the old man
[1:18:58] falls into his arms
[1:19:02] and moses grabs him because he's seen
[1:19:04] he's been stabbed
[1:19:06] he said i'm dying an old man
[1:19:10] god forgot the promise
[1:19:12] for he told me my eyes would see the
[1:19:14] deliverer
[1:19:17] did he realize that the liver was
[1:19:19] holding him in his arms
[1:19:23] oh friends sometimes the thing that you

[1:20:23] this morning
[1:20:24] because not only is he the god who
[1:20:26] remembers
[1:20:27] there are some things
[1:20:29] that he forgets
[1:20:35] you see if we have confessed
[1:20:39] that we have been in his presence
[1:20:41] and we have confessed our sins
[1:20:44] they are blotted out of the book of his
[1:20:47] memory
[1:20:49] there is nobody that can do that with
[1:20:50] god
[1:20:52] now you can do anything to me i'll
[1:20:53] forgive you but i remember it amen

[1:21:03] but god
[1:21:05] he ain't like us like that but god can
[1:21:08] forgive and forget
[1:21:10] think of it this morning
[1:21:12] he doesn't even remember that you've
[1:21:15] done it
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:19] though our sins
[1:21:20] would be a scarlet he has washed them
[1:21:23] wider than snow and wiped them out of
[1:21:26] his book of remembrance
[1:21:29] you may remember that thing that you've
[1:21:31] done you may remember and you hold it
[1:21:33] down for years something you made a
[1:21:34] mistake when you was a young girl and
[1:21:36] you made a mistake and you've helped
[1:21:37] that over you for years but let me tell
[1:21:39] you the moment you confess that god
[1:21:42] dropped it in the bleach of his blood
[1:21:43] and god doesn't even remember that
[1:21:45] you've ever done it and you are free
[1:21:48] this morning from the condemnation
[1:21:56] amen
[1:21:58] it makes me feel good when it's not even
[1:22:00] remembered nothing can do that but god
[1:22:02] nothing but god can do that he said he
[1:22:05] would blot it out of his book of
[1:22:06] remember i can't do it you can't do it
[1:22:08] because we've got this little finite
[1:22:10] senses but he's an infinite god he can
[1:22:13] absolutely forget that it was ever done
[1:22:20] hallelujah
[1:22:22] what's in are you talking about
[1:22:26] god puts our sins in the sea of
[1:22:28] forgiveness he blots them out there as
[1:22:30] though you never did happen oh my then
[1:22:33] we stand here free by the grace of god
[1:22:35] through jesus christ there lord pure and
[1:22:38] holy just as holy as he was because he
[1:22:40] doesn't see me when i come up there he
[1:22:43] sees his own son don't you see my
[1:22:44] brother my sister when we confess those
[1:22:46] failures god gives him in that bleach

[1:28:57] were
[1:28:58] healed
[1:29:00] isaiah 53 says surely he has borne our
[1:29:03] grief and carried our sorrow yet we did
[1:29:05] esteem him stricken
[1:29:06] smitten of god afflicted but he was
[1:29:09] wounded for our transgression he was
[1:29:11] bruised for our iniquity and the
[1:29:12] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:29:15] and with his stripes we
[1:29:18] are
[1:29:18] healed
[1:29:21] isaiah 56 says i gave my back to the
[1:29:24] smiters and my cheeks to them that
[1:29:27] plucked off the hair i hid not my face
[1:29:31] from shame
[1:29:32] and from spit
[1:29:36] my
[1:29:36] redeemer my provided lamb amen
[1:29:41] my healer
[1:29:42] they took him to pilate's hall
[1:29:44] they tied him to a whippin post they
[1:29:46] begin to beat him
[1:29:48] stripe after stripe and the bible says
[1:29:51] think of this the bible says for the joy
[1:29:54] that set before him
[1:29:57] he endured
[1:29:59] the cross
[1:30:01] brother what joy could come
[1:30:03] from being beaten until they could see
[1:30:06] your kidneys through the open wounds
[1:30:08] when great pieces of flesh hung off of
[1:30:10] his back how could there be joy in such
[1:30:14] a beating
[1:30:16] the bible says
[1:30:18] for the joy that was set before him
[1:30:21] he endured
[1:30:23] the cross
[1:30:25] what was on his mind
[1:30:27] what was he thinking as they whipped him
[1:30:28] at the whipping pose
[1:30:31] he starts a calvary and they throw him
[1:30:34] down
[1:30:35] drop the nails into his hands and his
[1:30:37] feet what was he thinking of
[1:30:39] oh god
[1:30:42] he was thinking of you
[1:30:49] [Laughter]
[1:30:54] the bible said there they crucified him
[1:30:58] the most horrible form of death that
[1:31:01] could be placed upon a human being
[1:31:04] but the bible said for the joy that was
[1:31:07] set before him he endured the
[1:31:09] afflictions of the cross
[1:31:12] for the joy
[1:31:14] how could there be joy
[1:31:16] because he looked for it in time
[1:31:20] he was the word he knew all things
[1:31:23] he saw you well he saw you happy he saw
[1:31:27] you free he saw you sitting in church he
[1:31:30] saw you standing on your feet he saw you
[1:31:32] praising him and loving him and faking
[1:31:35] him he saw you changed he saw you healed
[1:31:38] he saw you free he saw you restored he
[1:31:41] saw you redeemed he saw you
[1:31:45] and he saw me amen he saw you healed he
[1:31:49] saw me well he saw me happy he saw me
[1:31:53] forgiven and i want to thank him this
[1:31:55] morning because he said i could go free
[1:32:05] whatsoever you do in word or deed

[1:32:44] when the world
[1:32:45] has gone insane

[1:32:51] when a man don't know whether he's a
[1:32:52] woman or a man he's lost his mind
[1:32:58] ain't it crazy that the same ones that
[1:33:00] tells us to follow the science
[1:33:04] follow the signs
[1:33:07] but when it comes to a man or a woman
[1:33:08] they say well it's up to you whatever
[1:33:09] you want to be
[1:33:12] well it gets quieter but that's all
[1:33:13] right
[1:33:16] the insane assignment is filled up now
[1:33:17] it's flooded over into the government
[1:33:20] look i'm not democrat or republican if
[1:33:22] you voted you vote you vote the
[1:33:23] conscience of your heart these good men
[1:33:24] died we just come through veterans today
[1:33:26] thank you brother david for your service

[1:33:36] democrat or a republican i'm a christian

[1:33:58] thankful for what he's done for us the
[1:34:00] great mysterious hand of the living god

[1:34:04] more privileged people could we be than
[1:34:06] to have our presence the king of kings
[1:34:08] the lord of lords we would probably blow
[1:34:10] whistles and host flags and lay out the
[1:34:12] carpet and everything for the president
[1:34:13] of the united states even though you may
[1:34:15] not agree with him yet you would respect
[1:34:17] the office that the man helped
[1:34:21] to honor the mayor or the governor of
[1:34:22] arkansas if he was to come to your house
[1:34:24] you'd make him some coffee you'd make
[1:34:26] him feel welcome sure you would
[1:34:28] but think of it i'm not talking about
[1:34:30] the governor of arkansas i'm not talking
[1:34:31] about the mayor of black rock i am
[1:34:33] talking about the god almighty who
[1:34:35] created the heavens and the earth who
[1:34:37] spewed the stars out of his mouth who
[1:34:39] there are billions of billions of stars
[1:34:42] and the bible said that my god knows

[1:36:24] for hearing
[1:36:26] our prayers
[1:36:36] you know i'm so glad
[1:36:38] that our prayers don't have to be fancy
[1:36:41] because i can't pray a fancy prayer
[1:36:44] somebody asked me one time said you know
[1:36:45] a foreign language i said yeah english
[1:36:47] it's foreign to me
[1:36:49] i don't know a pronoun from a noun i'm
[1:36:51] not the sharpest knife in the drawer but
[1:36:53] i'm so glad
[1:36:55] that my prayer don't have to be a great
[1:36:56] day and a thou in the destiny of that
[1:37:00] that it can be just a simple prayer
[1:37:02] from the desire of my
[1:37:04] heart and god will hear us
[1:37:08] even at the point where a little boy
[1:37:10] whose parents was killed in a car wreck
[1:37:12] and he went to live with his uncle and
[1:37:13] his uncle was mean to him
[1:37:15] and he wanted to pray for his uncle
[1:37:18] and the pastor walked in found the boy
[1:37:20] at the altar
[1:37:22] not sure what he was doing he got a
[1:37:23] little bit closer and when he got closer
[1:37:25] he could hear the boy he was saying the
[1:37:27] alphabet
[1:37:28] a
[1:37:29] b
[1:37:30] c
[1:37:31] d
[1:37:34] what is he doing
[1:37:37] and when he was over the boy stood up he
[1:37:39] wiped his tears out of his eyes the
[1:37:42] pastor said i didn't mean to eavesdrop
[1:37:43] on you
[1:37:46] but what was he doing
[1:37:48] they said pastor i was praying
[1:37:51] i said praying
[1:37:53] i said yes sir
[1:37:55] said my mom and daddy took away from me
[1:37:57] i'm living with my uncle said he'd been
[1:37:59] mean to me
[1:38:01] he said i wanted to pray for him
[1:38:04] but i didn't know how
[1:38:06] so i just said a b
[1:38:08] c
[1:38:09] d
[1:38:10] e f
[1:38:12] and i thought god could take the letters
[1:38:14] and put the words together
[1:38:17] and know
[1:38:18] what's in my heart
[1:38:20] and i'm so glad brother matthew
[1:38:22] sometimes
[1:38:24] i wonder if he even hears the words
[1:38:28] but if he just sees the sincerity
[1:38:31] of our hearts
[1:38:35] how many times when we get there that
[1:38:37] day when we find out
[1:38:40] that that prayer before we pull out the
[1:38:42] driveway
[1:38:44] help us from a head on collision amen
[1:38:48] amen the bible said this is the
[1:38:50] confidence that we have in him if we ask
[1:38:53] anything according to his will

[1:38:58] so i just pulled out a few things from

[1:43:32] and i got up and went to church and i

[1:43:55] i was sick i didn't feel good
[1:43:58] there's only one place that i wanted to
[1:44:00] be
[1:44:01] and that was home

[1:44:05] towards flagstaff up 89a if you ever get
[1:44:08] out in that part of the country go
[1:44:09] through there it's beautiful out there
[1:44:11] and i began to talk to god

[1:44:23] am i doing any good
[1:44:26] maybe i should just go home sit down
[1:44:30] i'm getting old

[1:44:44] grown up there was cups and trash and
[1:44:46] hadn't been mowed i thought my goodness
[1:44:49] and there was a concrete bench there and
[1:44:50] i got out
[1:44:52] and i sat down on that bench
[1:44:54] and i began to pray again
[1:44:57] and i said god
[1:45:00] do you even know my name
[1:45:04] do you even know i'm out here
[1:45:07] when i got done praying bro mark i
[1:45:08] looked beside me
[1:45:09] was a coin
[1:45:11] and at first i thought it was stuck in
[1:45:13] the in the concrete but when i touched
[1:45:14] it it moved and i picked it up
[1:45:17] and on the coin was this verse jeremiah
[1:45:20] 1 8
[1:45:22] before i formed thee in the womb
[1:45:25] i knew you
[1:45:27] and i set you aside for service
[1:45:30] and i turned it over on the other side
[1:45:33] it was jeremiah 29
[1:45:36] every experience
[1:45:38] and i said
[1:45:40] he knows my name
[1:45:43] and i just want to thank him this
[1:45:44] morning
[1:45:45] that in our weakest moments
[1:45:50] that we can honor a simple prayer from
[1:45:53] our hearts
[1:45:55] and our god hears her prayer
[1:46:00] he said brother daryl i prayed and god
[1:46:02] ain't answered me
[1:46:03] that's simply not true he just ain't
[1:46:05] answered you yet
[1:46:06] or it wasn't the answer you wanted so
[1:46:08] you didn't think he answered you but the
[1:46:09] bible says in jeremiah 33 3 call unto me
[1:46:12] saith the lord and i will answer thee
[1:46:17] i'm so glad this morning
[1:46:20] that he knows our name
[1:46:22] he knows everything about you he knows
[1:46:24] the reason you're here this morning he
[1:46:26] knows the motive that brought you here
[1:46:28] this morning
[1:46:30] you didn't surprise god when you walked
[1:46:32] through the back door before the
[1:46:33] foundation of the world he knew you
[1:46:35] would sit here the clothes you would
[1:46:37] have on the color of your hair the color
[1:46:39] of your eyes and even your name
