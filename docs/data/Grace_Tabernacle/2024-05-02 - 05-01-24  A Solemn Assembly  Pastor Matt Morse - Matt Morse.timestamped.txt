[39:47] Book of Joel and we'll start in the
[39:49] first chapter and we're going to read
[39:50] from the first verse and amen I just uh
[39:54] just say it's good to be in the house of
[39:56] the Lord amen one more time time and and
[39:58] we just love his word how many love his
[40:00] word amen how many's been reading your
[40:02] Bible this week amen now now you got to

[40:10] praying and getting closer to God this
[40:11] week amen now we got to be honest amen
[40:15] you love the Lord amen I believe that's
[40:17] something we ought to do every day take
[40:18] a little bit of time and I know it I
[40:20] know you can't do it all day long we
[40:22] have work to do and jobs and things like
[40:24] that but you know to take some time a
[40:26] little bit of time and dedicate it to
[40:28] the Lord and just let the devil know
[40:30] that's God's time it's a good thing
[40:31] it'll strengthen you as a Believer I
[40:33] believe that and it's always been that
[40:35] way for me it's always been that case
[40:38] but I want to read out of the Book of
[40:39] Joel in the first chapter in the first
[40:42] verse and the Bible says the word of the
[40:44] Lord that came to Joel the son of pethel
[40:46] hear this ye old men and give ear all
[40:49] the inhabitants of the land hath this
[40:51] been in your days or even in the days of
[40:53] your fathers tell ye your children of it
[40:56] and let your children tell their
[40:57] children and their children another
[40:59] generation that which the pal worm have
[41:02] left ha the Locust eaten and that which
[41:04] the Locust hath left had the cankerworm
[41:06] eaten and that which the cankerworm hath
[41:08] left had the caterpillar eaten I also
[41:11] want to read from the 15th verse the
[41:13] Bible says alas for the day for the day
[41:17] of the Lord is at hand and as a
[41:19] destruction from the almighty shall it
[41:23] come and then I also want to read from
[41:25] Joel the 2 chapter this is our favorite
[41:27] portion of this scripture that many of
[41:29] us quote out of the 23rd verse and the
[41:33] Bible says and I will restore to you the
[41:36] years that the Locust hath eaten the
[41:38] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[41:40] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[41:43] among you we'll just ask the Lord to add
[41:45] His blessings uh to the reading of his
[41:48] word as you take your seats and I want
[41:50] to speak on uh this subject tonight on a
[41:52] solemn assembly I know that uh that this
[41:56] is a this is a great age how many
[41:58] believes that tonight that we're we're
[41:59] living in the greatest age the Bible
[42:01] prophesies we could go through we could
[42:03] go through hours of scripture that talks
[42:05] about the age that we live in and the
[42:07] condition of the age and uh it's it's
[42:09] not something that is that is hard to
[42:11] identify by by Bible prophecy uh to
[42:14] identify that we're living in this age
[42:16] or the end time but uh although we're
[42:18] living in this great age I believe it's
[42:20] time for God's Church to be at its best
[42:22] I me say Amen to that I I don't believe
[42:24] that we're uh that you know that we're
[42:26] living in something small but brother
[42:28] Mark if we're living in the day of great
[42:29] evil then it's a day that'll take great
[42:31] courage to be able uh to overcome it but
[42:34] you know what I believe that God's
[42:35] church will fulfill every promise that
[42:37] God said she would amen I believe that
[42:39] she'll be everything God said she would
[42:41] be I don't believe there's one thing in
[42:43] the scripture that God ever spoke of his
[42:45] church that she's not going to fulfill
[42:46] in this age I happen to believe that I
[42:48] don't believe there's any other age
[42:50] coming I believe we're in the final age
[42:52] I don't believe there's another church
[42:53] coming I believe we are the final church
[42:55] I don't believe there's another people
[42:56] coming I believe we are the people of
[42:58] God that has been written about for
[43:00] thousands of years and I don't know
[43:02] about you but I believe that what the
[43:03] prophets prophesied she' be here I
[43:05] believe what they prophesied she'd
[43:07] become and I just want to live in that
[43:09] amen I believe that I believe we're in
[43:11] that age and I believe we'll be that and
[43:13] you know I I I read this scripture and
[43:14] of course we read this many times and
[43:16] many quote this scripture and and that
[43:18] God will restore and uh but most
[43:21] whenever they read this brother Mark
[43:22] they say God will restore but we fail to
[43:24] see how God would restore the church and
[43:27] uh you know the Lord this is the
[43:28] scripture the Lord had had had spoke to
[43:30] my heart today in the 14th verse of Joel
[43:33] chapter 1 he says but sanctify you a
[43:36] fast and call a solemn assembly gather
[43:38] the elders and all the inhabitants of
[43:40] the land into the house of the Lord your
[43:42] God and cry unto the Lord I thought
[43:45] isn't that something to he that God was
[43:47] telling them the condition of the church
[43:49] and the condition of of the of the age
[43:52] and he said but if you want to have a
[43:53] restored Church here's what you do he
[43:55] says you call a solom a L and you gather
[43:58] the elders into the house of the Lord
[43:59] and and then you cry unto the Lord I
[44:01] thought why wouldn't that be a fine
[44:02] message to preach tonight to gather and
[44:05] to call and to cry unto the Lord here we
[44:07] come together tonight We Gather in the
[44:09] house of God every time we come in the
[44:10] house of God brother Mark We Gather in a
[44:13] place uh an Assembly of God We Gather in
[44:15] the house of the Lord but but the Bible
[44:17] says but call a solemn assembly and may
[44:20] uh be prepared for the Lord friends let
[44:21] me tell you if you want to have a
[44:23] restored Church GA call and cry unto the
[44:26] Lord if you want to have a church that's
[44:28] moving then I believe that God has
[44:30] called for his church to be restored I I
[44:32] don't believe that it should remain in
[44:34] the condition it was in Joel chapter 1 I
[44:36] I think that there's many that read that
[44:38] and I got news for you that God has
[44:40] already brought us out of it this ain't
[44:41] a a church that's that's in a stump
[44:43] somewhere that's been aten down or or
[44:45] eaten down and that don't have no life
[44:47] in it or don't have no power in it but I
[44:49] believe that God called for a living
[44:51] church if you believe that say amen I
[44:53] believe he called for a church to
[44:55] demonstrate the power of God how many
[44:57] believes that say amen I don't believe
[44:59] that we're an idol church I don't
[45:00] believe that we're a church that's
[45:02] supposed to watch and see the things
[45:04] that are going on I believe God's church
[45:05] is an active church I believe he called
[45:07] her in this age to be active to actively
[45:10] manifest the word of God and and
[45:12] actively manifest the power of God and
[45:14] actively demonstrate the power of
[45:16] almighty God that's the kind of church
[45:18] that God has called in the end time and
[45:20] you know I think about the churches
[45:21] today and I think sometimes the church
[45:23] forgets what their purpose is and I got
[45:26] to look through the scripture I thought
[45:27] you know if you go through the scripture
[45:29] and then find out what is the purpose of
[45:31] the church anyhow what do what do God
[45:33] caus us to do and and you know you could
[45:35] find many scriptures that would speak
[45:36] about this but the the the Lord led me
[45:39] to one place of after the resurrection
[45:41] had taken place and do you realize what
[45:43] was the first commission that the angel
[45:45] gave after Jesus resurrected from the
[45:48] dead how many remember the scripture
[45:49] Matthew 20 in the 28th chapter and the
[45:52] Bible says but the angel of the Lord
[45:54] told them to declare his resurrection
[45:57] remember when Mary Magdalene and Mary
[45:58] and they came down to the tomb and and
[46:00] they were looking to find Jesus in that
[46:02] dead State they were looking to find him
[46:04] in grave clothes they were looking to
[46:06] find him buried up in a tomb they were
[46:07] looking to find him in the place that
[46:09] they had last saw him but when they came
[46:11] down there looking for something dead
[46:13] they met an angel of the Lord said
[46:15] there's no death here but all you're
[46:17] going to find is life there there's
[46:18] nothing down there there's no Darkness
[46:20] here the darkness has fled and you're
[46:22] going to find light and the Bible says
[46:24] and the angel answered and said unto
[46:26] them fear you not for I know that you
[46:29] seek after Jesus which was crucified
[46:32] glory to God but he said but he is not
[46:34] here for He Is Risen and he said come
[46:38] and see the place where the Lord lay and
[46:40] go quickly and tell his disciples that
[46:43] he is risen from the dead and behold he
[46:45] goeth before you into Galilee and there
[46:48] you shall see him Lo have I told you
[46:51] then the Bible said and they departed
[46:53] quickly from the SRE with fear and with
[46:56] great joy and they did run to bring his
[46:59] disciples the word I thought isn't it
[47:02] something the angel of the lord gave
[47:04] them a word from the Lord and said you
[47:05] go tell them that Jesus Christ has
[47:08] raised from the dead you go tell them
[47:10] that that that there ain't nothing dead
[47:11] here but there's life and brother B
[47:13] brother bam took this very same
[47:15] scripture and and brother Jared he
[47:16] preached a message out of it called go
[47:18] tell he said you know it doesn't do you
[47:21] so much good to go if you haven't got
[47:23] something to tell so not only did he
[47:25] send them but he sent with the message
[47:28] he say so I think that's been a whole
[47:29] lot of the trouble today we go to tell
[47:32] but when we go we have nothing to tell
[47:34] there's nothing of any benefit there's
[47:36] nothing that would help people friends
[47:38] you can look at the church world today
[47:40] it's a world full of people that go and
[47:42] do and do all they can do but there's no
[47:44] message to tell but I thank God today
[47:46] that the Bride of Jesus Christ is not is
[47:49] not empty of a message but in the in the
[47:51] work that we had to do and all the going
[47:54] that we had to do I thank God that He
[47:56] gave us a message that we could teare
[47:58] when we got to our destination then he
[48:00] says the speaking of the Angel the angel
[48:03] said now you go preach it and you show
[48:05] these signs that I am alive from the
[48:07] dead this is the purpose of the church
[48:09] but said what a message it was go tell
[48:12] and go show my disciples these things
[48:14] that you have seen that I am not dead
[48:17] but I am risen from the dead oh my isn't
[48:19] it something that was the message from
[48:21] the angel you you think about he said
[48:23] take the Angel's message and you go
[48:25] spread it to the disciples there there
[48:27] was a great evangelist by the name of
[48:28] Charles Spurgeon he said one time he
[48:30] said whenever you get the chance to play
[48:32] the angel then go play the angel I thank
[48:35] God that we've had an opportunity in
[48:36] this hour to play the angel I thank God
[48:39] we've had an opportunity to take the
[48:41] message of the Angel and you go tell it
[48:43] to the world it it ain't just some dead
[48:45] message butor but it was a message of
[48:48] the resurrection of Jesus Christ what a
[48:50] message that the angel gave her you go
[48:52] preach of his resurrection you go talk
[48:55] about his resurrection and the Bible
[48:56] said when they went out with a message
[48:58] from the angel and they told of the work
[49:00] that that had been done that Jesus
[49:02] Christ ain't laying in no tomb but he's
[49:04] alive and well you tell him I'm a
[49:06] resurrected savior you tell him that the
[49:09] prophecy of David has been fulfilled you
[49:11] tell him that death has been conquered
[49:13] you tell them I went down into Hell and
[49:15] Hell has lost its power you tell them I
[49:18] put the devil in his place and the grave
[49:20] couldn't hold me any longer he said you
[49:22] go and tell them when you get there that
[49:24] Jesus Christ is Resurrected
[49:28] we got a living message it ain't a dead
[49:31] message we've got a living message we've
[49:33] been caught by the angel of the Lord to
[49:35] tell the world of the living savior
[49:37] that's been resurrected in this hour it
[49:39] ain't some dead Church going by but I
[49:41] thank God I've got something I can share
[49:43] that'll bring life to a body of people
[49:46] this message is Alive and Well I wonder
[49:49] if there's somebody out there can
[49:50] testify about it tonight it ain't just
[49:52] alive for everybody it's alive in me let
[49:55] me be a testimony the message of the
[49:57] hour of the resurrection of Jesus
[50:00] Christ Play The
[50:02] Angel Play The Angel and tell the
[50:06] message he's alive and well you know
[50:09] there's a story glory to God
[50:13] hallelujah you know there's a story of a
[50:15] little boy one time he went out and many
[50:17] of the young men had been called brother
[50:19] Mark to to go running this race there
[50:22] was about 150 of them came together they
[50:24] come up to the beginning of the race and
[50:27] said 'w what we're going to do is we're
[50:28] going to give you a p phrase and when
[50:30] you get to the end of the F the race
[50:32] then you know the first one there you
[50:34] just tell the man the past phrase he'll
[50:35] let you in you're going to win the great
[50:37] prize so the boy began to prepare did
[50:41] all the work that he could and he built
[50:42] up and he gained strength done endurance
[50:44] test and ran many miles before the race
[50:47] and got all his strength built up he
[50:49] thought you know there's one thing I I'm
[50:51] pretty strong on my body I'm not going
[50:53] to let them them pipsqueaks beat me I'm
[50:55] going to I'm I'm going to beat them so
[50:56] he went to strengthen it up he did
[50:58] everything right got real strong and got
[51:00] his endurance and got to learn learned
[51:03] how he could he could make the short
[51:04] cuts in the track so finally come the
[51:07] day of the race and they lined up on the
[51:08] line little boy line lined up and put
[51:11] his nose right on the wire along with
[51:12] the rest of them as they lined up to say
[51:14] go he he got to looking at his at his
[51:17] competition and man they ain't got
[51:18] nothing on me I know all the tricks I
[51:21] can jump higher than they can I can run
[51:22] faster than they can I can go farther
[51:24] than they can I I I can build better
[51:26] than they can I got a lot matter of fact
[51:28] I got a lot to offer but Mark all of a
[51:30] sudden the gun fired and off they went
[51:33] that boy went to running and Friends he
[51:35] knocked him out of his way he jumped
[51:37] over some he shoved his way he took
[51:39] every short cut that he could he could
[51:42] take and maybe the people that were on
[51:43] looking say my look at the strength of
[51:45] that boy but he got all the way to the
[51:47] end and all the the work his way through
[51:49] the course and he got all the way to the
[51:51] end he waited and to hear the guy at the
[51:53] gay he said what's the password and then
[51:55] all of his training and running and
[51:56] doing and going he forgot the P
[52:00] phrase I couldn't remember I came my I
[52:03] forgot the I forgot what I what I
[52:05] supposed to say when I get here but BR
[52:07] said see and he wasn't even able to
[52:08] enter in he said he forgot what he was
[52:10] running for he said I think that's the
[52:12] condition of the church today is they
[52:14] forgot what they're running for that's
[52:16] the trouble but go tell my disciples
[52:18] that I have raised from the dead and I
[52:20] will meet them in Galilee he said see we
[52:22] forgot the key word we've been so busy
[52:24] with other things making big churches
[52:27] and building big denominations until we
[52:29] forgot the key word but I thank God that
[52:31] we would have a reminder in this hour
[52:33] brother Mah to remember what the key PHA
[52:35] phrase was to go and tell that he's
[52:38] resurrected go and tell that he's still
[52:40] alive go and tell that he's still doing
[52:43] the same word go and tell that he's not
[52:45] a god of yesterday but the Bible said
[52:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[52:49] forever and he's still God the same God
[52:51] that was God for Elijah is God for you
[52:54] the god of Samson is a God for you the
[52:57] god of the Bible is a god of today he's
[53:00] the same God so we got something to go
[53:02] tell go preach the world the gospel you
[53:05] me tell you what those disciples did
[53:07] they went out Brother David whenever
[53:08] they met Jesus he he got to telling them
[53:11] about his coming Kingdom I the preachers
[53:13] here I wish I could he got to tell them
[53:16] about his the kingdom that would be
[53:17] coming into power and he and he told
[53:19] them what would take place and but Mark
[53:21] he was prophesying of what would happen
[53:23] over the next few days but you realize
[53:25] that just a few days later
[53:27] then Jesus laid the very Foundation of
[53:29] that Kingdom that he was going to build
[53:31] here here was some of them old weak
[53:33] Christians that were that were scared
[53:34] about what was going to happen tomorrow
[53:36] like sometimes we feel like but the
[53:38] Bible said Jesus said behold I send the
[53:40] promise of my father upon you tar in the
[53:43] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[53:45] with power from on high he said see he
[53:48] promised of a coming of a coming Kingdom
[53:51] you go t in this place cuz my kingdom is
[53:54] coming it's going to rise it ain't it
[53:56] ain't going to always look like this

[54:19] a promise of power friends and that same
[54:21] Power Glory to God that same power that
[54:24] raised Jesus from the dead the power to
[54:26] heal and the power to raise the dead and
[54:29] the power to open the blinded eyes and
[54:31] the power to make the lame wall and the
[54:33] power to to give sight to the blind that
[54:36] same power Jesus was given to the church
[54:39] the Bible said if that same spirit that
[54:40] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you

[54:46] old Mortal body this old flesh body that
[54:49] fails and gets sick and you can't even

[55:32] it would give life back to God's
[55:34] church let me tell you and God's been
[55:36] changing lives ever since ever since the
[55:40] power of God fell down upon those men

[55:45] hearts and lives were changed and turned
[55:47] to Jesus Christ he ain't ever stopped it

[55:54] same result it'll still take a drunk and
[55:57] it'll bring him in the house of God
[55:58] it'll still take a drug addict and
[56:00] deliver him from drugs it'll still take
[56:02] a prostitute and it'll take her off the
[56:04] street and establish her in the house of
[56:07] God
[56:08] hallelujah it'll take a cold formal dead

[56:25] Hallelujah see but somebody somebody's
[56:28] got to meet the devil's
[56:29] challenge you realize the devil's put a
[56:31] challenge on God's Church somebody's got
[56:34] to meet his challenge you say well
[56:35] what's his challenge listen his
[56:36] challenge is the church has lost its
[56:38] power how many ever heard him say it his
[56:41] challenge is that God can't save Sinners
[56:43] anymore this is the devil's challenge
[56:46] there ain't no true conversions anymore
[56:48] everybody just kind of goes through the
[56:49] motions and join churches and they feel
[56:51] good and that's what makes them come
[56:52] back it's all about emotions there ain't
[56:54] no true conversion
[56:56] nobody can be filled with the Holy Ghost
[56:58] no more that was just for the disciples
[57:00] that was just for the apostles that that
[57:02] was that wasn't for us you may as well
[57:04] give up on your children they'll never
[57:05] be saved anyway they're too far gone
[57:08] they've done blaspheming the Holy
[57:10] Ghost the Revival's over and it ain't
[57:14] coming back that was something for back
[57:17] 50 years ago or 100 years ago but it
[57:19] ain't for now it's the devil's challenge
[57:22] said but see somebody has got to meet
[57:24] the devil's challenge but B say see but
[57:26] when you're going to meet it you ain't
[57:27] going to meet it in a backsliding
[57:29] condition he said see the backsliding
[57:31] condition of the church can't meet the
[57:32] challenge of this hour it's going to
[57:34] take the church coming to another place
[57:36] see so if you're going to meet the
[57:38] challenge then you got to get back to
[57:40] the
[57:40] Revival Revival means life it means take
[57:43] something that was dead and bring it
[57:45] back to life so if you're going to meet
[57:46] the challenge of the devil you're not
[57:47] going to do it in a dead State it'll
[57:49] have to be under Revival say see so here
[57:52] here we're going to take the church back
[57:53] to this revival says so let your heart
[57:55] be stirred sometimes that's what we need
[57:57] brother Jared we need to be stirred we
[57:59] need to be recharged we come to the
[58:01] house of God and we we get so depleted
[58:03] in our spirit we just need to come and
[58:05] hear some this oldfashioned gospel
[58:07] renewing of our spirit we need the Holy
[58:09] Ghost to fall in the house of God and to
[58:11] lift us up into another realm that our
[58:13] mind can get off the things of the world
[58:15] and get back on the things of
[58:17] God that's what God does for us you
[58:20] think about it this is what Samson was
[58:22] doing Sunday we're talking about Samson
[58:24] and how that he went out then he went he
[58:26] went out calling out to God he said see
[58:28] when he called out to God you realize
[58:30] when he called to God he knew that his
[58:32] backsliding condition couldn't meet the
[58:34] challenge of the hour he would never
[58:36] defeat the Philistine in the condition
[58:38] that he was in so he called out to God
[58:40] that God would restore him back to his
[58:42] rightful place that he would be able to
[58:44] defeat the enemy that had him held
[58:47] captive couldn't do it in his
[58:48] backsliding State she had lost his power
[58:51] broken his Covenant let me tell you
[58:53] friends you won't meet you won't meet
[58:55] the challenge of the hour by memorizing

[59:03] be meet the challenge of the hour by
[59:05] being a cold church or dead church or
[59:07] formal Church like these people of today
[59:09] are trying to put up on the people of
[59:11] God you won't meet the challenge of the
[59:13] hour in that kind of condition it leads
[59:16] the church to be backslid see well how
[59:18] do you do it well there ain't but one
[59:19] way to meet the challenge of the hour is

[1:01:53] to be a part of that
[1:01:57] he said well how will it come I can tell
[1:01:59] you according to the scripture he said
[1:02:01] the only way that church would come
[1:02:02] would be by a Pentecostal
[1:02:04] experience they would come and they
[1:02:07] would testify of his resurrection they
[1:02:10] would testify of his of the supernatural
[1:02:12] they would testify of his power they

[1:02:51] tonight we're a kingdom of the witnesses
[1:02:53] of Jehovah
[1:02:54] God how will it come you say well let me
[1:02:58] ask you how would it come how did it
[1:03:00] come how did it ever come how did it
[1:03:03] come to humanity whenever whenever
[1:03:05] whenever life first came to the first
[1:03:07] man that ever walked upon the Earth this
[1:03:09] is what God's trying to do to bring life
[1:03:11] into the church how did it come you
[1:03:13] think about when Adam was setting that
[1:03:15] day and God had created the Bible says
[1:03:17] God made Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:03:20] ground and when he made man do you
[1:03:22] realize that that man laying there in
[1:03:23] the dust of the ground he still had no
[1:03:25] life in you that's what the Bible said
[1:03:28] all the forming was done now I could
[1:03:31] preach on that all the form was built
[1:03:34] perfect it was made just like God had
[1:03:36] had had intended on it being made
[1:03:38] everything was just in its place it was
[1:03:40] so it was so if you it was so formal and
[1:03:42] ritualistic it was just perfect I'm
[1:03:44] going to get myself in trouble it was
[1:03:46] just perfect but it had no life in it
[1:03:49] everything looked good but it had no
[1:03:50] life in it but the Bible said but then
[1:03:53] God breathed into his nostrils am the
[1:03:57] breath of
[1:03:58] life and Man became a living
[1:04:01] Soul God breathed into his nostrils the
[1:04:05] breath of life I don't have to look no
[1:04:07] farther to find out where we came from I
[1:04:09] don't have to look no farther to find
[1:04:11] out what was my origin brother Mark but
[1:04:12] I believe when God made man he made them
[1:04:14] in His image he breathed into his
[1:04:16] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[1:04:18] became a living Soul we can trace
[1:04:20] ourselves all the way back to that very
[1:04:22] place when God made the first man isn't
[1:04:26] it something that he that he that he
[1:04:27] created Life by breath it was a it was
[1:04:30] the Breath of God he was it was a
[1:04:31] life-giving breath that I don't have
[1:04:33] time to read them all but David said
[1:04:34] this he said by the word of the Lord
[1:04:36] Heavens were made and by the breath of
[1:04:39] his mouth job said it like this he said
[1:04:41] the spirit of God has made me and the
[1:04:44] breath of the almighty is what gives me
[1:04:46] life it's the Breath of God brother Mark
[1:04:49] that brings life into the church isn't
[1:04:51] that what he done when they went and met
[1:04:52] him they doubted it was even him when
[1:04:54] they went to meet him down there on the
[1:04:56] on the way that day but when he came in
[1:04:58] there oh doubt and Thomas I don't even
[1:04:59] know if that's you you don't even look
[1:05:01] the same how do we know it's really you
[1:05:03] and the Bible said he showed him the
[1:05:04] nail prints in his hands and he let him
[1:05:06] feel the the the the the spear on his
[1:05:09] side the scar and he said and the Bible
[1:05:11] said when he had so said he showed them
[1:05:13] his hands in his side and they were glad
[1:05:15] that they saw the Lord and then Jesus
[1:05:17] said unto them peace be unto you as my
[1:05:20] father has sent me so send I you the
[1:05:24] same thing about the same message that
[1:05:25] the angel had given to Mary and Mary
[1:05:28] Magdalene and now Jesus was sitting in
[1:05:30] their presence he said the father sent
[1:05:31] me and so send I you and the Bible said
[1:05:35] when he done this after he had said it
[1:05:37] he breathed on them and said unto them
[1:05:40] receive you the Holy Ghost friends they
[1:05:43] were a people that had lost Direction
[1:05:45] they were a men that had lost their
[1:05:48] their their their CS or they didn't know
[1:05:50] which way to turn they didn't know where
[1:05:52] to go when he got put in the Tomb but
[1:05:54] when he met him again he said is I be
[1:05:56] not afraid I'm the same one that came
[1:05:58] walking on the water that day when you
[1:06:00] was going across in the boat feel my
[1:06:02] hands and feel the nails car feel where
[1:06:05] a spear pierced my side and he breathed
[1:06:07] on them and he said receive the Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost all of a sudden these men that
[1:06:13] were lost these men that had no courage
[1:06:15] these men that were hiding these men
[1:06:17] that were hiding in their homes it was
[1:06:19] so bad that Peter he just a few days ago
[1:06:22] he wouldn't even deny that he even knew
[1:06:23] who Jesus was they were lost and hiding
[1:06:26] and afraid but all of a sudden they were
[1:06:28] close enough to feel the Breath of God
[1:06:32] can you imagine being that far away oh
[1:06:34] friends if you could take yourself there
[1:06:36] a moment if you imagine being that far
[1:06:38] away and so lost without the Savior the
[1:06:40] light of the world had gone de he had
[1:06:42] been buried this great how the Earth had
[1:06:44] quaked and and the great Darkness had
[1:06:46] came upon the face of the Earth and fear
[1:06:48] shook their hearts these men that were
[1:06:50] so bold when they were standing in his
[1:06:52] presence and they had got into that
[1:06:53] shape and now they were went from that
[1:06:57] and all of a sudden they were close
[1:06:58] enough to feel his
[1:07:00] breath I a't it something that's where
[1:07:03] we want to be tonight close enough to
[1:07:05] feel the Breath of God close enough that
[1:07:09] the Bible says he breathed on them oh
[1:07:11] friends I don't know about you but
[1:07:12] that's the desire of my heart is for the
[1:07:14] Lord Jesus to breathe on me in his
[1:07:18] breath it had the power to give his
[1:07:20] spirit in his breath the power to to
[1:07:23] give the Holy Ghost in his breath you
[1:07:24] realize it was the same breath that
[1:07:26] spoke at lazarus's tomb that said
[1:07:28] Lazarus come forth he was the same
[1:07:30] breath that healed the sick he was the
[1:07:31] same breath that spoke that that that
[1:07:33] that spoke water and turned it into wine
[1:07:36] this great breath of almighty God had
[1:07:38] breathed upon
[1:07:40] them receive you the Holy
[1:07:42] Ghost think of it all of a sudden
[1:07:45] brother B said that's how the church is
[1:07:46] born he said the church is born on the
[1:07:49] of the Breath of God he said when this
[1:07:51] stature has molded itself up there in
[1:07:53] condition God's breath breath Breeze
[1:07:56] upon them Hallelujah receive the Holy
[1:07:59] Ghost and then you are a son of God you
[1:08:02] can join anything you want to but you're
[1:08:05] born into the church of living God
[1:08:07] you're born by the Breath of God God
[1:08:09] breathed upon them and said receive you
[1:08:12] my goodness you're born by the Breath of
[1:08:15] God it gives you life you're born you
[1:08:18] you think about think about the prophet
[1:08:20] Ezekiel he when he went down there and
[1:08:23] the Bible says he said I was called into
[1:08:25] this Great Valley when I went out into
[1:08:28] the valley it was a valley filled with
[1:08:29] dry bones there wasn't no life in the
[1:08:32] valley everything was there was dead and
[1:08:34] dried up and but Mark had no life to it
[1:08:37] he said but the but the angel that was
[1:08:39] speaking to him be to tell him glory he
[1:08:42] began to give him a message he said Can
[1:08:45] these bones live again what a question
[1:08:47] to ask him he said oh son of man can
[1:08:49] they live again how how would I know
[1:08:52] Lord only you would knowest he said I'll
[1:08:54] tell you not only will they not only can
[1:08:57] they but they will he said oh you and he
[1:09:00] begin to speak to him he saidoh Ezekiel
[1:09:02] he said prophesy unto them dry bones you
[1:09:05] take the very mind of God and you begin
[1:09:07] to speak God's mind and you'll see those
[1:09:09] bones that have not done they've been
[1:09:11] laying down there they're all mixed up
[1:09:13] they don't know what arm goes to what
[1:09:15] leg they don't they've been so taken
[1:09:17] apart they don't even know how to put
[1:09:18] their body back together but the angel
[1:09:20] of the Lord would come and he'd begin to
[1:09:22] speak God's word and the arm would know
[1:09:24] where it was supposed to go and the foot
[1:09:26] would nowh it's supposed to go and all
[1:09:28] of a sudden this body that God called
[1:09:30] the church that was so scattered around
[1:09:31] the world and had no direction in this
[1:09:34] last days in the end time that you would
[1:09:36] see a bone a leg bone connected to a
[1:09:38] knee bone and a knee bone connected to a
[1:09:41] hip bone and the body of the church be
[1:09:43] put back together
[1:09:45] again he said prophesy you dry bones
[1:09:48] hear you the word of the Lord and I will
[1:09:50] cause breath to enter into you that you
[1:09:53] can live again and it eel said so I
[1:09:56] prophesied and as I prophesied I heard a
[1:09:59] great noise and I heard a great Shak and
[1:10:02] and all of a sudden those bones got to
[1:10:03] coming up out of the grave and the skin
[1:10:06] Came Upon the bones and the senu be to
[1:10:08] show it together and they stood before
[1:10:10] me as a great Army he said now what he
[1:10:13] said oh you you're a form of a man you
[1:10:16] realize brother Mark here they stood but
[1:10:18] they still had no life he said now what
[1:10:20] will I do he said you say unto them he
[1:10:23] said prophesy under the wind prophesy oh
[1:10:26] son of man and say to the wind thus
[1:10:28] sayeth the Lord God come from the Four
[1:10:31] Winds oh breath and breathe upon these
[1:10:34] slain that they may live oh isn't it
[1:10:36] something that God gave his Prophet an
[1:10:38] authority to call upon the wind that he
[1:10:41] could breathe into them the breath of
[1:10:43] life that them old dry bones could live
[1:10:45] again and manifest the life that God had
[1:10:47] called them
[1:10:49] to
[1:10:50] Hallelujah what he prophesied listen he
[1:10:53] said I'll call you out of the graves
[1:10:56] I'll restore you to your rightful place
[1:10:59] and I shall put my spirit in you glory
[1:11:02] and you shall live and I shall place you
[1:11:04] in your own land and then you shall know
[1:11:06] that I the Lord have spoken it and I
[1:11:09] have performed it sayth the Lord I spoke
[1:11:13] it and I performed it this is our God
[1:11:17] God don't speak things idle he said
[1:11:19] you'll know that I spoke it and then I
[1:11:21] also performed it I sent the message and
[1:11:23] then I Vindicated it I it wasn't just
[1:11:25] something idle I spoke it and then I
[1:11:27] performed it friends don't you see when
[1:11:29] they gathered when they them them
[1:11:31] disciples gathered that day in the upper
[1:11:33] room brother Mark they went up there
[1:11:35] they gaed they were afraid they didn't
[1:11:37] know what was about to happen they were
[1:11:39] in there scared they prayed They Carried
[1:11:42] they waited but the Bible says all of
[1:11:44] the sudden they heard the sound of A
[1:11:46] rushan Mighty
[1:11:48] Wind and when that wind of God be to
[1:11:51] blow through that building little licks
[1:11:53] of fire that were formed in that place
[1:11:55] it fell upon them brother Mark can me
[1:11:57] tell you what it done it took a man that
[1:11:59] was backslid and gave him the ability to
[1:12:01] go stand and preach the Gospel of Jesus
[1:12:03] Christ sometimes that's the condition of
[1:12:05] the church they get they get so weary
[1:12:07] and they get so afraid and and they get
[1:12:09] so worldly and sometimes we get backslid
[1:12:12] he said but what would it take it will
[1:12:13] take the Breath of God breathing life
[1:12:15] back into the church again you say how
[1:12:17] would he breathe it he'll call somebody
[1:12:19] to speak the word of God for God's word
[1:12:21] is life it's the breath of almighty God
[1:12:24] and it's spoken the believer and they'll
[1:12:26] manifest what God called them to
[1:12:28] be this was a man that was afraid it
[1:12:31] took a man that was backslid named Peter
[1:12:33] that was so he was so afraid that when
[1:12:35] they said aren't you one of them
[1:12:36] Believers I don't even know who Jesus is
[1:12:38] Oh I thought I saw you down there when
[1:12:40] he was down in the garden I've never met
[1:12:42] that man in my life oh I know you're
[1:12:43] really one of them we' seen you down
[1:12:45] there on the River Bank he was with
[1:12:46] Jesus I'm telling you I don't know who
[1:12:48] he was and the Bible says He was cursing
[1:12:50] them it took that old coward man and
[1:12:53] when the Breath of God came blowing
[1:12:56] through that building that same man went
[1:12:58] out there and he found him a place he I
[1:13:00] wish I had a place to stand he found him
[1:13:01] a place to stand so that everybody could
[1:13:03] see him he that sometimes you just feel
[1:13:05] you need to be a little bit taller he
[1:13:07] found him a good place to stand he said
[1:13:09] I come to declare unto you that that
[1:13:11] Jesus that you crucified that God has
[1:13:13] raised him from the dead and he's gave
[1:13:16] the very power of Heaven has been given
[1:13:18] unto him and I come to declare it to you
[1:13:21] you laid him in a grave but God raised
[1:13:23] him up what he spoke was true truth he
[1:13:26] gave a man that was afraid the courage
[1:13:28] to preach the gospel he gave a people
[1:13:30] that was backslid that wanted to turn
[1:13:32] their back on God the C to be restored
[1:13:35] again brought a Revival to his life let
[1:13:39] me tell you something it didn't stop God
[1:13:41] he filled them and then he sent them
[1:13:44] Hallelujah he said I spoke it and then I
[1:13:46] performed it he filled them then he sent
[1:13:48] them that's what's happening today
[1:13:49] there's too many people that's assembled
[1:13:51] in
[1:13:52] fear but it come the Breath of God he
[1:13:55] filled them and he sent them that's what
[1:13:57] we need you may how how you may assemble
[1:14:00] yourselves I don't know how you came
[1:14:02] tonight I don't know if you come afraid
[1:14:04] I don't know if you come backslid I
[1:14:06] don't know if you come to Revival I I
[1:14:08] don't know that but you know that but
[1:14:10] God knew how they were assembled think
[1:14:12] about when we We Gather in this way
[1:14:14] think we all we all go back and we we
[1:14:16] quote the apostles and we say well those
[1:14:18] were God's disciples and you know well
[1:14:20] God could use them after all they were
[1:14:22] his disciples they were great men and
[1:14:24] you know this is what many people quote
[1:14:25] they say well the disciples or the book
[1:14:27] of Acts was the framework of the church
[1:14:29] I believe that but that's not all it
[1:14:32] was see it's what prophet of God said he
[1:14:35] said we do not believe that the Acts of
[1:14:37] the Apostles is just the framework we
[1:14:40] believe it's the word of God it's the
[1:14:42] acts of your Holy Spirit in the apostles
[1:14:45] listen now we believe that the same Holy
[1:14:47] Spirit Lord that come upon them and the
[1:14:50] way they acted it'll do the same thing
[1:14:52] in us when it comes upon us if it's the
[1:14:54] same spirit that was from a message does
[1:14:56] God change his mind in 1965 and the
[1:14:59] whole message was about no God don't
[1:15:01] change his mind about his word it was it
[1:15:04] was showing that the same mind of God in
[1:15:06] the beginning is the same mind of God in
[1:15:07] the end he said Lord and we believe the
[1:15:09] same holy spirit that come on them and
[1:15:11] the way they acted he'll do the same
[1:15:13] thing in us when it comes on us if it's
[1:15:15] the same spirit and I still believe that
[1:15:17] today so let me tell you I can meet the
[1:15:20] challenge of the devil today don't you
[1:15:22] come and try to take the move of God out
[1:15:24] of our Church don't you come and try to
[1:15:26] take the holy ghost out of this church
[1:15:28] don't you come and try to take the
[1:15:30] liberty of the worship of God out of
[1:15:32] this
[1:15:33] assembly I believe we have a right to be
[1:15:36] what they were I believe we have a right
[1:15:39] to have the same power they had I
[1:15:41] believe we have a right to talk to the
[1:15:42] same devil the way they talk to him and
[1:15:44] to put him in his place but man said the
[1:15:47] Holy Spirit must be alive in the church
[1:15:50] always leading the church for the age
[1:15:52] that it's living in to confirm the word
[1:15:55] that's promised for that
[1:15:58] age I believe we have a right listen
[1:16:02] what Joel said he says sanctify you a
[1:16:06] fast call a solemn assembly gather the
[1:16:10] Elders of all the inhabitants of the
[1:16:11] land into the house of the Lord your God
[1:16:14] and cry unto the
[1:16:17] Lord
[1:16:18] gather call and
[1:16:22] cry see the word solom
[1:16:25] it means to take it serious or to be
[1:16:29] sincere this is what God called for we
[1:16:32] come to the house of God see there's a
[1:16:35] sincerity that we come to get something
[1:16:37] from the Lord I sent brother Tim a
[1:16:40] message he's asked me about the sermon
[1:16:43] title and such I said well brother you
[1:16:44] just pray for me he said I always pray
[1:16:46] for you you know that's a sincerity to
[1:16:49] come to the house of God that the Lord
[1:16:51] will speak to me the Lord will use the
[1:16:53] the minister that comes to the pull pit
[1:16:55] or the Lord will anoint the singers that
[1:16:57] sing We we don't put singers up in front
[1:16:58] of the church to be something to be a
[1:17:00] spectacle or to make fun of but we come
[1:17:02] there and say Lord Lord I pray you'd
[1:17:04] bless them Lord that it'd be a blessing
[1:17:05] unto me Lord I pray you'd use them Lord

[1:17:09] welcome in this place don't you realize
[1:17:11] friends how easy it is to offend the
[1:17:13] Holy Spirit our attitude and the way we
[1:17:16] act towards God it's a very timid spirit
[1:17:19] and sometimes people they just offend
[1:17:20] God they offend the spirit of God I
[1:17:22] don't want to offend him I want to make
[1:17:23] him welcome I want to I want everything

[1:18:14] power I'll restore her to her rightful
[1:18:17] place my people shall never be ashamed
[1:18:21] do you believe that tonight friends when
[1:18:24] God makes a promise Pro you think about
[1:18:25] it when God makes a promise he uses you
[1:18:28] to perform it he uses you to bring it to
[1:18:31] pass you you you ever think of that
[1:18:34] every promise when God makes he proves
[1:18:36] his promise by
[1:18:38] Believers there's a world of people
[1:18:40] gathered together in assembly
[1:18:42] unbelievers they say well I've never
[1:18:44] seen God move like that I've never seen
[1:18:46] anybody healed I've never seen the power
[1:18:48] of God in that way but God don't prove
[1:18:50] his promises by unbelievers so how would
[1:18:52] they ever see it God proves his promises
[1:18:55] by Believers you think about it he shows
[1:18:58] us this in the scripture when he went
[1:19:00] down you remember when he was walking
[1:19:02] that that day and that gyus came to him
[1:19:05] and he said Lord my daughter's sick
[1:19:07] would you come and heal her and he went
[1:19:10] on his journey that way and gyus had
[1:19:11] gone back to his house and this lady
[1:19:14] come to him the the the big crowd had
[1:19:17] gathered around him and after a little
[1:19:20] while the time had went too far about
[1:19:21] gone and finally a servant came to him
[1:19:24] and said Lord don't worry to come by
[1:19:26] gyus his house because it's too late
[1:19:28] she's already
[1:19:29] gone you see he wasn't looking to prove
[1:19:33] his promise by unbelievers he was
[1:19:36] looking to prove it by
[1:19:37] Believers and he already spoke these
[1:19:39] words he says well she's she's just
[1:19:41] asleep so he goes down to the house
[1:19:43] brother Mark and you know when Jesus got
[1:19:45] in there the Bible says when that they
[1:19:47] said don't worry about it don't come but
[1:19:48] he walked in anyway wish I had time to
[1:19:51] dramatize it but he came in the house
[1:19:53] and oh Mom and daddy gather then all
[1:19:55] their friends and stuff's gathered
[1:19:56] around cuz she was in her in in this
[1:19:58] sick place and he said don't worry he
[1:20:01] said she's not dead she's just asleep
[1:20:04] the Bible says they got to laughing and
[1:20:06] making fun of him and scorning him why
[1:20:08] because they were a bunch of unbelievers
[1:20:10] you know what Jesus done that Mark he
[1:20:12] said he told him to take all those
[1:20:14] unbelievers and kick them out of the
[1:20:15] house Jarvis I don't know who these
[1:20:17] people are but they're a bunch of
[1:20:18] unbelievers that ain't got no place here
[1:20:20] said notice what he was showing us it
[1:20:22] didn't matter it didn't matter what had
[1:20:24] happened he had already spoke it didn't
[1:20:25] matter what took place he already said
[1:20:27] he was coming by see and if Jesus has a
[1:20:29] promised appointment to your house
[1:20:31] there's a reason he's coming by he he
[1:20:34] ain't just coming by to poke at you or
[1:20:35] make fun of you and say well that's what
[1:20:37] you get for acting that way that that's
[1:20:39] that that's what you're going it wasn't
[1:20:40] like that he made a promise to come by
[1:20:42] and when he comes by he's coming by to
[1:20:45] restore he spoke it now he had to prove
[1:20:48] it the man said see he knew she was
[1:20:49] asleep he knew he knew that he knew the
[1:20:52] father would come because here he was a
[1:20:54] believer he said he knew this little
[1:20:55] girl she was a Jewish maid she was only
[1:20:57] asleep because the righteous do not die
[1:21:00] and he knew by the word that she was
[1:21:01] just asleep he proves his promise by the
[1:21:04] believer he came to redeem the righteous
[1:21:06] redeem means to bring back from where
[1:21:08] you once was and how could he he
[1:21:10] couldn't redeem unbelievers because they
[1:21:11] weren't redeemable they had to go to
[1:21:13] their destination and that room full of
[1:21:15] unbelievers begin to laugh Jesus just
[1:21:17] kicked them out you know what he showed
[1:21:18] us that the unbeliever would never be a
[1:21:21] witness of the Resurrection he kicked
[1:21:23] him out he took him out of the scene
[1:21:24] brother Mark and that the only ones that
[1:21:26] would be a witness of it would be the
[1:21:28] Believers that remained in the house
[1:21:30] that one day they' see a resurrection
[1:21:32] and they'd be a part of it because they
[1:21:34] were Believers and God proves his
[1:21:36] promise by Believers but say Christ is
[1:21:39] his word and you're a part of his word
[1:21:41] and that's the reason you are here is to
[1:21:43] confirm your place in life you're not
[1:21:45] confirming your place in death you're
[1:21:46] confirming your place in life confirm in
[1:21:49] our place as a Believer and you'll
[1:21:51] witness the very things that an
[1:21:52] unbeliever never will glory to God I
[1:21:54] wish I had another hour you'll witness
[1:21:56] things an unbeliever will never never be
[1:21:58] able to witness brother Mark he said why
[1:22:00] because God's word is confirmed by the
[1:22:03] believer that same God brother Mark he
[1:22:05] was the one but that by forn knowledge
[1:22:07] when he went down to lazarus's grave and
[1:22:09] called him out of the Grave he knew he
[1:22:11] wasn't dead that he was only asleep and
[1:22:13] he knew that little girl wasn't dead
[1:22:14] that she was only asleep he said why
[1:22:17] because she belonged to God she was a
[1:22:19] Believer she was a daughter of God he
[1:22:21] said and when our work on Earth is over
[1:22:23] if we don't live till it's coming we
[1:22:25] cannot die we're only asleep he proved
[1:22:28] it here and he'll prove it again well
[1:22:31] somebody stand to their feet tonight
[1:22:33] how's he going to prove it he'll prove
[1:22:35] it by Believers he said he'll do the
[1:22:37] same thing cuz he'll do the same
[1:22:39] yesterday today and forever and he'll do
[1:22:41] the same thing someday to every True
[1:22:43] Believer for his word promised that he
[1:22:46] would all of those that are in Christ
[1:22:48] God will bring with
[1:22:50] him you realize what he was quoting
[1:22:52] Thessalonians the fourth chapter Paul
[1:22:54] said but I would not have you ignorant
[1:22:56] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:22:58] asleep that you sorrow not as others
[1:23:00] that have no hope but we believe that
[1:23:02] Jesus died and rose again even so them
[1:23:04] that also which sleep in Jesus will God
[1:23:07] bring with him you say where is he going
[1:23:09] to bring them he's bringing them to the
[1:23:10] greatest meeting that this world has
[1:23:12] ever seen he's bringing them to a
[1:23:13] meeting in the air to meet those that
[1:23:15] are alive and remain Paul said for this
[1:23:17] I say by the word of the Lord that they
[1:23:20] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:23:21] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:23:23] them that are asleep but the Lord shall
[1:23:25] descend from heaven with a shout and the
[1:23:26] voice of an archangel and with the Trump
[1:23:28] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:23:31] first and then we which are alive and
[1:23:33] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:23:35] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:23:37] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:23:40] Lord I will restore sayeth the Lord
[1:23:44] there ain't nothing that's dead that
[1:23:46] remains dead it may be dead in your mind
[1:23:48] but here the Lord says they can't even
[1:23:50] be dead if they belong to God they can't
[1:23:52] even you can no more die than God can
[1:23:53] die there are sleep just like they was

[1:44:05] darkness hallu my you know it don't take
[1:44:09] much light to drive out
[1:44:12] Darkness how many was there when we when
[1:44:14] we watched the eclipse the other day
[1:44:16] wasn't that something to see God's
[1:44:19] Mighty creation we stood out everybody
[1:44:21] out in the field and it was just
[1:44:23] something to me how that after a little
[1:44:26] while and it finally you know I me me
[1:44:28] and Sarah went on a trip just shortly
[1:44:29] after everybody on all the planes it
[1:44:32] took us hours to get to the airport
[1:44:34] everybody on all the planes were solar
[1:44:35] eclip shirts everybody just came from
[1:44:37] watching it and I they were all talking
[1:44:39] about it on the flight and everybody was
[1:44:40] sharing their photos back and forth up
[1:44:42] and down the seats of different ones
[1:44:43] that had photos and well we got out we
[1:44:46] got out to on our on our trip and we got
[1:44:49] over there and landed and got settled in
[1:44:50] of course we were still a little bit
[1:44:51] excited about and people said where
[1:44:53] where y'all from where'd y'all come from
[1:44:54] when we were over in Arkansas and now we
[1:44:57] just seen the the eclipse and and the
[1:44:59] first guy I talked to he said yeah he
[1:45:00] said I seen it looks like most of them
[1:45:02] that we saw he said I think we had about
[1:45:03] a 90 a 90% or something here he said
[1:45:05] they they all look the same to me I
[1:45:07] thought he didn't see what I
[1:45:09] saw see 90 wasn't the same 98 wasn't the
[1:45:12] same 99 wasn't the same and nowhere over
[1:45:14] there could we tell them so you know
[1:45:16] what I did Brother Jared I pulled up my
[1:45:17] phone and took pictures of it I said
[1:45:19] here's what it looked like where I was
[1:45:21] where I was my they just ad it well that
[1:45:23] ain't what we saw I no it was something
[1:45:26] different and I thought you know isn't
[1:45:28] it something we were sitting there
[1:45:29] watching that and that that that Moon
[1:45:31] finally had got into its place and there
[1:45:33] was no light you know just how you know
[1:45:35] how it kind of went dim and dark and I
[1:45:37] thought it was just so after just a
[1:45:39] moment when there was just a pen a pen
[1:45:43] of light if you still had the glasses on
[1:45:45] it looked like the moon was still in
[1:45:46] full control you remember how it went
[1:45:48] from dark and brother Morgan all of a
[1:45:50] sudden it was just like out of nowhere
[1:45:51] came this great lie this great cutting
[1:45:54] torch of a lie that just shined in there
[1:45:56] it brought brightness back to the Earth
[1:45:58] and if you look back through the glasses
[1:45:59] it was 0 point nothing per of the of the
[1:46:02] Moon that had moved and it had such a
[1:46:05] great light I thought isn't it something
[1:46:07] that it that's all it took
[1:46:09] 99.9% of it was out but it was still
[1:46:11] enough light to light the whole earth I
[1:46:13] thought that's the way it was in this
