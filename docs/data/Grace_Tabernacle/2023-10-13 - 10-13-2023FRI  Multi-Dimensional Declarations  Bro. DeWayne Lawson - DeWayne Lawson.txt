many of you's been there in India and you've seen the gods that they serve and sometimes they'll have a big old stone God up there and then people will go by and they'll wipe actions on it and and they'll touch it every which way they can touch it but they don't have the power to touch back that's right but the god that we serve when you touch him he can touch back and if he's ever been touched by him you know that you've been touched by the master amen it's certainly a tremendous honor to be here tonight and we appreciate you each of you forgive my not being here the last couple nights we was in a a funeral there uh back home and U it's certainly a sad time for that family uh but we we hated to not be here the last couple nights we've heard you had a tremendous time and the Lord's just been blessing greatly I know the preachers you had so I know you had good preachers I know you people so I know they had a good congregation amen so it's just makes out for a good meeting amen it's not much like coming back home to Arkansas and seeing the folk and sometimes you walk in a meeting like this and see everybody and you start your mind just starts going back to all them times and fellowships and and alers and the shouting and I'm just walking in just sitting there walking in there the day stood up with me we was worshiping for that song and I thought about when we were kids back there shouting under the under the altar of where Mort rge and I was like my that goes back so far amen and amen it's certainly good to see what God has done and his Mercy amen here tonight on this camp ground just under the tent and we thank the Lord for brother Matt and Grace Tabernacle Sister Sarah and all they're doing and the folks and with meals that's being cooked and I tell you there's not enough to be said about people to put their heart in the work of God it's an eternal inheritance the rewards will never be lost God's given it is a a great honor to be speaking with these men of God and of course tomorrow night brother Andrew will be coming and I I thank God God for young men that God's raising up in this message amen I I know you're not supposed to have pride but I'm really proud of this young man and what he's doing and uh and the blessing that he's been uh I think he's the greatest weapon we have against the enemy for our young people I believe we are to get behind him with all of our heart encourage him and strengthen him amen and it's a it's a tremendous time and so we just want to tonight to take a few minutes and the word but just before we do uh we' like to Bow our heart in a word of prayer now the prophet taught us power was prayer is powerful that power is lifechanging change atmospheres it can change direction it can change attitudes change lives and if we take just a moment in prayer tonight we want to ask the Lord to come by this way maybe there's a special need here tonight maybe someone's body that having need or has something in their family family tonight they have special need we just want to ask the Lord Jesus to come in and speak and father we bow our heart here tonight we stand here on these grounds speaking to this lovely group of people Lord you raised us up among them Lord they suffered with me early in life through the first sermons that I preached some are sitting here tonight that they encouraged me and helped me Lord long many years have been the battle father there STI standing I want to thank you Lord for the encouragement that theyve been for this gospel in this area Lord for our brother Matt standing here in this community Lord holding a platform for these men of God that would Lord be a part of it for these Pastors in this area I I want to thank you for them Lord and now Lord as we turn to you we want to invite you Under the Tent tonight Lord father may you heal the sick among us Lord may you touch the need of you Lord may you fill with the Holy Ghost may you may you break every bondage and Lord Jesus we invite you now we invite you to come into this meeting take a hold of it glory and use it for your glory we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen we would like to turn in the Bible tonight uh I want to go to the book of Hebrews uh the 11th chapter I want to go on the first verse and certainly good to be on the platform here that Brother David and brother Vernon playing that music tonight and takes takes me back many many years amen Hebrews the 11th chapter I want to read the first three verses now Faith is the substance of things hopeful for and the evidence of Things Not Seen I like that word there the evidence everybody wants evidence well faith it is the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it Elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the world they were framed by the word of God Amen so the things which are seen they were not made of things which do appear so the things you see was not made from things you see they were made from things you couldn't see and this this this is the report that we have tonight we ask the Lord to bless his word tonight as you can be seated I want to take a title tonight and amen and uh the Lord just placed this on our hearts so I want to share it with you uh I want to speak to you on multi-dimensional decorations multi-dimensional decorations I believe faith is a very powerful thing and Faith it is the very foundation of the Christian church amen God has so arranged things that a person that has faith can have everything that God has amen and a person has no faith has nothing so faith is the F fundamental part of being a Christian it's Faith amen faith is that and the prophet teaches us that faith and and you could go through our quite a a little while teach what faith is but I just want to Pi speak on this very point the prophet of God said that faith of course was our six sense and he said we're grateful that we have five senses he said but no means was five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you for Earthly contacten but there was given you the six sense which belong to the Christian and you cannot have the six sense until you become a Christian right it's only way you can ever have any more than five natural senses the natural person but the sixth is better known to the Christian as faith it is the one that governs and guides you it is superior to all other senses we find out that five senses are giving to you that they may contact this Earthly home you know everybody needs their senses that's what allows you to taste feel smell hear those those dimensions of of of the these three dimensions that we live in they need the five senses to activate in them now you know as well as I that some people live without some of those senses they actually able to move and live without part of those senses but isn't it beautiful to have all the senses is it beautiful that a person's able to uh contact this home in every one of those Dimensions but we find out that five senses were given to you by God and they are used but sometimes see when the five senses are contr to the word then they're lying to you so the six sense cannot lie it's the super sense so when the prophet speaks of this that that you got five senses but you know every one of you's been to a m or most of you has probably been to some kind of magic show or you've seen some slide of the hand and you're sitting there looking right at it and a guy fools you because he's doing it by your senses he's using your side and distraction and you you're sure that something happened a certain way and he used mirror and smoke and it Li to you it was a deceiving portion of that and that can be done you can take and you can take it and you maybe you can put one thing under another make it look like something make something smell like something else and that's an odd thing it sometimes you think it's one thing and it's something else so your senses can actually be deceived and they can lie to you so the prophet of God said see then all of the five senses that we have he says now they're lying to you if they're contrary to the word of God but the six sense it cannot lie it is a super sense now that's a good sermon title you can go home and look it up tonight the super sense that's a sermon brother Ram preaches to explain to us Faith sounds more like a testimony service if you listen to it amen but it's a super sense it's a faith sense it's something that don't lie to you now in super sense brother B will say this the super sense is the holy spirit now that settles a lot of matters amen that the holy spirit is the super sense when a man receives the Holy Ghost he's receiving a super sin see the Holy Ghost is the only thing that will always agree with the word of God your feelings won't always agree with the word amen your mental attitude or your your your body language or or your life or something within that sometimes you don't agree with the word of God but the Holy Ghost will always agree with the word of God so the super sense is the Holy Spirit and that's the faith of God that dwells in you now if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five under control of the super for it's far above natural senses the spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens are above amen it is five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see amen it makes you act when you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond that come from God it's called Faith see the super sense comes from God and just as your five senses were given to you God gave you a super sense but it's not it's it's here to guide you in this life and here's the thing amen the prophet of God says in super sense then what is the six sense to do then brother brandom why do the six cents come the six cents come for this reason say for this reason the six sense is the faith of the super sense the six sense for some of this reason only was it was to make five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to the word of God that's what the six sense is for that's what the scriptures speaks of you know the Bible said casting down reasoning right and anything that would exalt itself above the word of God that's what super sense does it takes a hold of reasoning and cast it down it takes a hold of un belief and it cast it down that's why it was given to you amen super sense is the holy spirit of God that dwells in you amen the six sense comes upon a human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom that's contrary to God's promise the six sense says it isn't there is that amazing makes you sound like a crazy man you say it ain't there now I'm not talking about denial like in some of you that work in medical science know sometimes somebody gets cancer and they say the first stage of cancer is denial people say I don't have cancer when they really do have cancer so I'm not talking about denying cancer in that manner because you know how can I overcome brother Rand will tell us this he'll say now real overcoming is recognizing the devil and overcoming him he said let's say someone has cancer he said now overcoming is not to say I don't have cancer he said it's to recognize you you do have cancer and it's to recognize that there is a real devil he said but then you have to recognize that greater is he that is in me than he that's in that hand greater is he that's in me than the sickness that's in my body greater is he that's in me see that's real overcoming and the six sense is in every man woman and child that is received of God to make them deny anything that is contrary to the word of God am is it beautiful when the scripture says let the weak say that I am strong words you might be weak as you ever been and you recognize I am weak but because that you are not you are not defeated but brother you're Afflicted in your body you can stand there and say to Satan Satan I am not defeated anden I am strong because the word of God says I'm strong listen as long as God's word says you're healed you're healed I don't matter how sick you feel he doesn't matter how troubl you feel the word of God has declared over you that you are healed and by my strip you are healed it's not in the future chance it's in the present chance you have already been healed by the blood of Jesus Christ the payments have been made you have already been saved by the payments of God and been Lo last night there won't be no more blood Jesus won't die again he's already died the blood's already been shed you've already been saved you've already been healed and left the Church of the Living God declare that the word of is true in this Dimension no matter what struggles you come to I anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom that's contrary to the word of God it'll make them deny it it'll make them tonight Romans the 4th chapter I'll give you a scripture for it amen Romans chapter 4 as it is written I have made thee the father of many nations now that this is Romans 4 it says speaking of Abraham who was fatherless he was buried and not only baring he was old he was baren and he was old so it wasn't like he was a young man and he was just starting to try to have children he'd been trying to have children for years and can't do it he can't have children and his wife can't have children and God comes down and seemingly mocks him and said how you doing father of Nations amen God called him a father of Nations and he was yet childless and God was calling him a father you see what God was doing is God knows that his word has the power Amen to shape the future of a man God has the ability not to just know what the problem was or what the problem is but God knows the direction of how to change something to make it come out like it's supposed to I love it when God calls a baren woman a a mother of many nations and stars and dust of the earth I love when he begins to prophesy to a man that don't have children and he's the father of Nations because when God says you are you are When God says it's finished it's finished it doesn't make any difference because watch now Romans 4:17 he said before of him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calth things which be not as though they were amen that call of things be not as though they were and watch what happens before him even whom he believed even God who Quicken the de it amazing how Paul does this he gets talking about this God he said and he the one that quickens the dead amen so what he's trying to do he's trying to say to like me and you standing out here tonight and and or maybe and we see a we see an animal run across there and I said Hey There Goes an animal and and and Brother David you say what kind amen I said well maybe it's a raccoon or it's a cat You' say what kind well he says he says even God so he say see even God but now he's going to tell you what kind of God he's going to tell you what kind of God we're talking about he's telling you the god that quickeneth the dead other words now whatever the situation is if you're above the ground amen you got to know that God is able to deal with your situation the god that quicken foret in other words everything from a dead man being raised Amen to an old body being changed to a Barren body bringing children it doesn't matter what the condition is that you are in it matters the kind of God that is dealing with you now I don't know about you but the kind of God that I serve he's a God that open the let SE he's a God that called J to fall because of the children of Israel he's the kind of God that changed Abraham's body and gave him a baby he's the kind of God he's the kind of God that can change every situation of your life he's a kind he's that kind of God he's the kind of God that can make David face a jack with a rock and a slingshot when you make him your God the impossi become possible because you know it's not you that does it it's God that does it and I say tonight that he's that kind of God and he's my God he's not just the god of my parents he's not just the god of Matt Morris or Andrew or Brother David he is the god of dway Lawson he's my God and I tell you tonight the prophet of God said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and other man said before the beginning he was even God how many know he said he wasn't even God he was self-existence he said but when Angels begin to worship him he became God and God is not your God until you take to worshiping him and then he becomes your God I tell want you making your God right now w't you start worshiping and say Lord I believe you I serve you I believe the kind of God that can walk down into my life and change every something stand for pastors I believe you the C of God and can come into our church and can save he SI that's the kind of God that I want your Saint that's the kind of God that we invite to the platform he's the kind of God that can change things oh yes sir he's the kind of God that can take a young man on and make a preacher out of him he's the kind of God that can take a drunk and sober him up and make him a winner of souls he's that kind of God that can take a crack atct and break the addiction and make him move in the power of the Holy Spirit that's the of God Ser I think is there is no I there is no here and God he said and he's God and I change not so whatever he was for d he's for me tonight whatever he was for Abraham he is for me tonight whatever he was for [Music] will you got the god of Elijah Among Us in this age than he's that kind of God when he take another step his name is called Jehovah Shi Amen in other words the Lord our God is present what good would it knew if he was a deliverer and he wasn't here he was a savior and he wasn't here but our lordes Jus said yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me for I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age and I believe and declare he is here God he's a god of the universe he's a god of the heavens he's the kind of God that can roll a planet off of his hand and speak a word and it come into existence he's the kind of God that can give life to man is that kind of God I tell you what I begin to believe that you can bring out of God whatever thing that he has in him is accessible to the church through faith break it down it's through faith now what kind of God that kind of God our God's in the building what kind of God that kind of God right kind of God take a mar woman and give a child I'm talking about the kind of God that can take a stroke and heal it up come on church sometimes healings are not Miracles they're healings healings are healings meaning amen that a man can have a stroke but it don't mean it's the end of it it means there a god that can come on the scene and stre back come on stand that for the Lord I'm playing over heal of the blood was his off [Applause] ton kind of God kind of God hallelujah God is that kind of God he's a kind of God that is real that's reality to my God so poor God some idolatry he's not some rock or some come on you you got to know what kind of God you're serving I know how people are they go after the gods of entertainment they go after the gods of their own of their own Creations that's right you know how people are in this age they got every kind of thing that's God has been set up in front of them but you better make sure the gods are worshiping when your kids are sick you can go to him when you lose your child you can find out he's Jehovah J when you find outen in an hour when you thank God and sudden destruction begins to come you need the kind of God he said that I am an every bless H in the time of trouble that's the god that we serve tonight he is not limited by space he is not limited by time he is not limited by condition he is not limited by anything but our [Applause] unbelief I say take the limits off of God you hear me take the limits off of God you can't hard believe for that well don't get in the way of somebody that can man said if I can't walk like walk he said I'm not going to get in the way of Enoch if you can't believe for the impossible then get out of the way while somebody else beli The Impossible God who can change circumstances really what God wants is your worship really what he desires is your adoration your adoration your praise your worship amen he's God Amen the Bible said that faith is the substance of things hope for and the evidence of things that are not that's right brother looking to the unw into the Inward and looking to the Unseen brother said the inward man did not come from the earth it came from heaven and that's the Eternal part of a human being yeah but yet strange that he tries to figure out his own way yeah we find it in the scriptures that when a man chooses to walk in his own way he does what he wants to God just lets him alone how many y'all ever been there you get you want to do your own thing you know you're serving a gentleman God is a gentleman if you want to go a certain way he'll back up and let you go right so far right I tell you kind of God he is he's a god that'll let things go so far amen he let he let Jonah go so far amen but then Jonah found a place to turn around thank you Lord you know it's true he let Peter go so far and then that chicken saved his life amen y'all know it's true amen them chickens that saved every missionary's life we eat them things that's where it started but P back there that chicken cowed that third time he knew he's that's far enough amen we called him for he could get too far right cuz he's that kind of God he'll let you he'll let you he'll be a gentleman and he'll let you go so far but thank God he has that place where he says that's far enough that's far enough some of you and you thought for sure you was about gone and then he tued in a little turn around come home brother Tom always remind me when brother Brown was up in Jeffersonville they come to him you know like the Bible talked about Saul in the scripture when he lost his mules and he went over and and he went to Samuel wasn't he with Samuel and ask and and he asked for the mules and that's when Samuel told him were to find the mules and then they anointed him as king but he went to a prophet because he lost and brother R said the other day he said they come to me there's a car sto it and they come to me and ask me where that car was see there scripture there and they asked him where that car was brother R said I I knelt down and began to pray and he said I had a vision remember the car was going uh it was going toward Bowling Green y'all all know that trail it's going towards Bowling Green and he said the Holy Spirit convicted that man now there's a little bit there I don't teach on it but I'll just say this brother man said it was something to convict there was something that God could still deal with that fell and there he was driving a stolen car and the Holy Spirit could still convicted is that awesome I don't want to ever get past the place God something tapped on this heart said you're doing wrong and need to take it home young man tur the car around and took it back home I always wonder brother man said he walked up the car and said when the guy got his car back said the the the everything was there all of his clothes and all his possessions everything was there he said only thing gone was a half tank of gas and I always thought to myself why did God make that man stop and fill that gas tank up why didn't he bring the whole thing back and then I I and and I was just praying about it the Holy Spirit struck my heart he said but see that was proof of how far it had went had it come back with a full tank somebody said oh it didn't go that far but when it only had that half tank it had just enough gas to on it went down there and come back and that's why God let some of those memories stay with you and that's why when he restores you but yet you remember a few of those things you used to do and there's still a few marks around your life to remind you amen that you used to be a certain way but you ain't that way no more you used to be a certain that she kind can turn you around and your back Hallelujah he's that kind of God he's that kind of God you must think say see we are not to think for ourselves we are to call anything contrary to what he said as though it was not no matter what our eyes claim to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe life comes from what we believe not what we see what we believe that's what matters what we believe about it something happens to you amen what you believe about it is what matters amen what you believe is what takes place in your life I want you to watch the scripture in Hebrews 11 the Bible says it very clearly it said that Moses endured as seeing him who is invisible all right that's how Moses endured now if you've ever studied Moses's life and Moses had some endurance he had to endure some things you know when God sitting down there with that Supernatural sign he had no clue there would be people mocking him I mean you know you you left the burning bush and he had a he had a stick he could throw down and come in the snake and pick it up and then stick again I bet he thought I I mean this is going to be the tops and he gets down and does it somebody stands up and says cheap magician trick and copies the same thing come on and and that's when Pharaoh's hardened heart came because it devalued that that miracle and made it just like anybody could do it so God didn't tell Moses he was going to encounter that he didn't tell him that was going to be that way but you see what happens is he had to endure that and be certain that God had sent him to do it when it happened to brother R brother R said but notice Moses was first Moses was first am now I don't have time to preach on it I'll tell you this where them sticks go where did the sticks of James and Jamber go said they were right there in Moses's stick he said see because Moses had the real gift the others wasn't real at all they were only impersonations when Moses left he still had the real [Music] thing amen you see then you see a son of daughter of God and you see them people say well that's no such thing as a real son or daughter of God cuz I seen this guy and he went that way I seen that guy and he went that way now see they were copies of a real son and daughter of God but the real son and daughter of God is still [Applause] here you got to endure see you had to be able to endure things and Moses endured and I think it's powerful that he endured it by seeing the invisible right that's how he did it by seeing the invisible now the prophet teaches us from second Corinthians Paul will tell us that we also can see the invisible second Corinthians 4:1 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish the inward man Remember That Man From Heaven yeah the inward man is renewed day by day for our Li Affliction uhhuh which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen they are temporal but the things which are not seen they are Eternal so see the inward man lives by renewing his strength day to day that day today renewal of strength comes from faith it is that what you feed on the word of God you must realize real and it's important to realize that faith will declare the Unseen faith will give you multi-dimensional declaration it will give you a way to declare something that's not in these three dimensions at all you can't taste it you can't smell it you can't feel it you can't hear it but you say it's true anyhow because you're accepting that From Another Dimension that Dimension is conted by faith amen when that is contacted by faith faith then therefore declares in this life something that is not seen in this life but you declare it anyhow one of the greatest examples of this is when Gesa is with Elijah and the Syrian Army comes off the mountain and they're there to destroy them and it's always amazing because Elisha says there's more of us than there is them and of course Gesa thinks he's a crazy man cuz there's a lot more syrians than they are these to and Elisha just said Lord open the boy's eyes that he might be able to see now what he did was he opened the eyes he never brought the Angels there have y'all ever noticed that there wasn't any Angels come on the scene they were actually already there but Elijah's Ministry opened their eyes to what was in the room now you as a Believer sitting here tonight is a natural carnal man you might look around and say I don't see any angels in the building I don't see God in the building I just see a chch I just see people but see it was Elijah's Ministry that came upon the Earth in the last day and showed this Pride children there is something else in this room besides you and me the prophet of God tells us that the angel of the Lord is in this building now he did it in a way you could not ever deny it he declared God in the building so powerfully so Vindicated so real any school boy ought to be able to stand up and say he's here tonight in the building not because I feel an electric presence which I do not because there's a certain anointing in the room which I do feel that amen but I don't declare he's here because of that there's a higher level of things than the way I feel the way I think the way I see because what if I didn't feel good what I was sick in my body what if I was tired what if I was cold what if it was trouble then there's got to be something you can reach into another dimension when this Dimension is dark and tormented and sick and unbelieving you got to go somewhere house to come back and R the dimension you're living in Oh Brother I tell you this amen the word we are declaring in this age did not come from this Dimension will br Ministry did not come from this Dimension It Came From Another Dimension it was the presence of Jesus Christ beared to this church no matter how you feel tonight no matter the struggle no matter the trial no matter what you're going through in the name of the Lord the angels are in the building the presence of God is in the building and you can just begin to believe it you can break out of every barrier and every Str Hallelujah the power of God is still real there's got to be a declaration a declaration of the Unseen [Applause] [Music] real I was preaching over Africa West Africa a few years ago a guy named Eric makoko he worked for the voice of God for since he was a young child we went to Brother Andrew's been there we went there and preached in their meetings I don't know maybe about 5,000 people in that building that night when I got got home they started sending emails listen while you were preaching something really odd happened said there was a fog moved in around the platform and said we couldn't see you no more all we can do is hear your voice amen you said preacher what is happening do you recognize that in this room right now is the angels of the Lord do you realize all of the glory of God is in this room right now you realize the Angels the Bible said that the angels of the Lord encamp about them that [Applause] fear I'm going stand I'm going to stand on this word I don't care how you feel I'm going to stand right with a Vindicated prophet and declare what the truth is I'm not declaring this because of my good feeling I'm declaring this by a Vindicated voice from the M age but I can believe I can't believe my own life I can believe it but I can't believe believe the preacher or I can't believe the church and I can't believe the devil I can't believe my friends there is a voice that we can't believe he is a voice of Mali for that said I am here to declare he is here hallelujah it's the only thing I'm sure of he is here he in this SPI Declaration of that come from a prophet who said I am God's voice to you break Brother come on come on you see here's a prophet that stands there in a visible realm and declares an invisible realm people thought he was crazy uhhuh until he started telling them the prayer uhhuh they thought he was crazy until he said well when you were about 8 years old you were running up a steps of the house and you were wearing a little checkered skirt and the dog bit you and you've been carrying nervousness your whole life is that right you see then they had to admit somebody here greater than this man William amen you see because this was a messiah sign given to the age to declare the realities of God to a church that had lost the hope and the realities of another dimension now today I believe we have a right to declare it as a prophet declar I love how brother brandom says it in my redeemer he said just imagine today that his presence is here now the Lord Jesus is in another world or another dimension right here in the form of a spirit right here in the building now amen our eyes can't see him because they're physical yet unless there would be something that we could see the vision but here is just as visible he's just as real as the day he spoke to Mary at the grave or cleopas on the road to amus and you've read those stories and you thought mine wouldn't be good to run into the Lord on a walk in the afternoon right but the prophet said he's here just as real right now in this building his presence is here and I love how he says it and it can be felt amen he said with an inner charge that's on the inside of a human being called the New Birth the soul has has been magnetized unto him and once in a while I love it you you got dry days you got jeury days you got sometimes a little bit rougher Services than others you've all been there but brother R said once in a while you begin to let your mind be concentrated on him begin Believing on him and after a while something a reality you begin to feel something sweep over your being it's a Vindication of his resurrection you know if if you just begin to set your mind on it and this is one of the greatest one of the greatest Troubles of the church today yeah is there's too many other things on our mind come on y might as well get real with me I'm just a real preacher I'm he preacher y'all know me you get too much on your mind you get to working on the tractor you're working on the car you're trying to pay that bill trying to figure out how that fence how that gate will hang up there you're trying well I got that cow she's running I might need to get out of here got them on at the house I wish my daughter was here tonight wish my son was here tonight you get so many things on your mind that you forget amen that if you could just begin to concentrate your mind on the Lord the Bible said 120 were gathered in the upper room and they got in one Accord and that wasn't one Accord against something it was one Accord believing in the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit when they begin to focus on that they begin to forget about everything else yeah I wonder what it would cost you to forget everything else tonight I wonder if you forget the little troubles that you share the little little feelings and and I've been around a long time those little church Spirits you know don't do it like that down to church I appreciate you doing it in the tent tonight amen I feel like I'm just right at home amen amen you see it ain't really at anybody's church then see and sobody well I don't want every service to be like this well this ain't your Wednesday night service this ain't this ain't the Sunday morning home church this is a convention service this is a tent meeting this is when you let your hair down this is when you find a moment to get in the presence of God and people that are a thousand miles from this meeting you get in such a contact with God that you'll shake them out of their beds and Cancers can be healed situations can be changed because people got their mind on the Lord I'm talking about the Lord who can change everything get your mind your God and when you begin to concentrate on God something begins to happen and you begin to feel that presence that you Ain felt a long time well I ain't felt the Lord in a long time let me tell you why cuz you got your mind on everything else you got your mind on how many likes you got on Facebook how many likes you got on Instagram and who thought this and how they felt mad I think they should have said it this way and they should have did it that way you got your mind so many places amen but the devil knows amen that if the True Church of God ever get focused on the word of God they can take hell over tonight and there Ain one thing God can do you can go down and get that baby bring them back to God you can go down and change the circumstance because you're putting your mind on God he's heing when you begin to declare he's here brother said just start talking about him just start talking about it when you start declaring he's here and you start worshiping and you start praising him like he's in the building amen the presence of God becomes more real and more real and more real until it begins to begin to take over and the prophet of God will tell us this he said the gift of God he gave me to work was by visions to declare his presence and the people would know the presence of God is near amen now I want to give yall a news flash on God didn't go anywhere after brother brand was here can I say something else I don't believe brother Rand would have to come back to prove anything else you believe brother R it's already a proven fact come on church now I'm the kind of guy you got to give me a reason for something if you telling me brother man's got to come back I want know why I want to know why you think he's got to come back amen you said well preacher I don't know why y'all get in all this cuz if you think brother R's got to come back you just open the door for another a Angel you just invited the door for somebody to get a special gift and come and start leading the church this way or leading that because you ain't satisfied with what Malachi 4 already done brother I'm satisfied with Revelations the 10th chapter with Mal the fourth chapter will br's Ministry finished the opening of the seals I delivered the Church of indicated word you just believe that word amen there's a ruring faith that's coming from the message of the hour it's a perfect Faith it's an aftering Faith it's anoch Faith it's a powerful faith and you here to declare in the face of every trial every problem every sickness God is still able in R oh yes sir said my Ministries declare him he's here let me say this he's here and he ain't went [Applause] nowhere we have and we have seen the resurrected one by side you have more evidence that Jesus is Alive than any man since the history that met him personally like Apostle Paul you have more evidence can I just say this if you want to hold a trial tonight and you want to put somebody on trial to prove the evidence that Jesus lives there is no greater evidence on this planet than the ministry of William Brad there was more done in that Ministry than there was the entire life of Jesus when he was on the earth amen right see but it wasn't brother random was doing it it was the ministry of Jesus Christ that's why we don't worship the prophet amen we worship the God he worshiped can I just say it since we're here we're all much can I just say it you don't put on don't don't you dare try to put on this church that we worship William Brown Don't You Dare come around some some old devil trying to tr trying to make it like these people worship brother Brown that's the biggest lie that's ever been told that might be somebody somewhere that does it but this little church and these people here have been directed to Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection you might want to worship Jesus in another well we just want to Jesus you mean the one that was on the cross back there well I got good news he rose up on the third day and he still alive and he's still working he's still doing Miracles the Jesus I worship I worship the Jesus that come on and change of heart Jesus we going to worship tonight I I realiz I realiz by my Approach some people might think I am entirely crazy I I I I I I give you that that's okay you think I'm fanatical that's okay the prophet of God said everybody thinks faith is fanatical except the one that has it and the one that gave it to it but I can show you in science my faith is true the the the nature testifies with my faith death B and Resurrection it's the only thing that nature agrees with as Christian [Applause] don't speak for Muhammad but it speaks for the death burial and Resurrection the son every day 24 hours every day you can see the birth of Christ the death of Christ the resurrection of Christ every day every spring you can see you can see the flowers come out of the ground and they all testify he has risen from the grave from the dead heart denomination risen but that Resurrection wasn't just for Jesus it was for the Church of the Living God that they raised out of the page tunes and out of the Lutheran tunes and out of the denominational tuns that shut God away from the people but this message come to open the door to bring people back to God I have proof I even signs proves what I'm telling the truth now it's a it's a you know when Paul said declaring the Unseen when he talks about looking to the Unseen to endure or looking to the Unseen when Paul said that there was no radio or television at all yeah right how how odd that must have seemed to the people for him to say look to the Unseen and that's how you're going to overcome but in the age we live in yeah isn't it odd that television and movies came in in the same age a prophet came to the Earth right is that odd yes sir I mean at the same time watch how it starts out it starts out with just motion picture real staticy black and white no color and look at the advancement look at the advancement they added voice they brought Clarity they brought color and to now it's almost a living reality in the room with you right because it so declares another dimension right radio you you can turn on radio right here in this building while I'm preaching you can listen to something else completely different and the voices of people that's never been in Arkansas can play right in this room that's right so even science declares that is a multi dimensional declaring age that it's the age when science is declaring it a prophet of God was declared because it is a junction of Time and Eternity and if you watch scripture every time that Time and Eternity begin to have a junction God filled that Junction with angels and he filled that Junction with Supernatural because he wanted to turn his children a certain way yall know the Bible said Ministry spiritual sin from the presence of the Lord do you know it actually says that they're ministering Spirits unto The Heirs of the promise of Abraham now what's that mean to you ministering Spirits never came on the earth until Abraham's seed came on the earth angels that don't show up in the Bible until God gives seed to Abraham every time an angel showed up in the Bible it spurred the people toward the supernatural right Angel never came for a natural movement Angels always inspired people to the supernatural side of life so they inspired Mary to believe but she didn't have a child she didn't have a man she was not no way to believe but the Angels said to believe it am because Angels declare the supernatural you see right here in this room there are colors there are dimensions and I I don't have time don't have pictures but I can even show you the pill of fire that was there with Moses that was there with Paul has came down into this age the angels of the Lord are here in the room brother said you can't maybe see them but you could feel the influence of them isn't that amazing you can feel the influence of angels how many how many's ever been in service you was I've seen some of you right here in this service how many ever been in service and all like you feel like something just charges you the point hit a certain way just you feel charged you know what that is that's influence of angels that's Angels influencing you to believe you know what Angels done you know what they always done what they were created for worship for millions of years they worshiped God Amen isn't that amazing do you know the book of Isaiah says that when Isaiah saw the presence of the Lord he saw the Holy Temple feel it he said that that voice of one Angel shook the temple post that was there brother said think about that one Angel could shake the voice one Angel could move a post of a of a temple one Angel he said there's millions of them in heaven he said what must it sound like in heaven what must it sound like in heaven with a million angels that have never come on now that never knew sin that never knew condemnation that never in trouble they don't even have a reason to worship they've never been safe for nothing they never delivered from nothing they never had any success that come from the blood said he said but God was so holy that he literally had to cover the Angels had to cover their wings he said they had to take their wings and cover their FA just to say holy in the presence of God he said but see by the blood of Jesus Christ you can step in the presence of God you can stand in the presence of God and give back worship I tell you that with that thought in mine tonight we ought to worship like nobody wor not because we just want to make some noise but because he's worthy of our worship because he saved UNS he healed my body he touched my life he delivered my heart I like it's too loud you going to be in [Applause] trouble now you know the prophet of God said I I'll just read this one quote I know you love it he said sometimes he says he says you say I feel a strange feeling here tonight looks to me I just want to cry shout or something he said that's the angels of the Lord I take five minutes right now angelology would that be something demonology y'all yall know that Ser right demonology it's what causes spirits and things and you know now I'm not going to ask you for hands but let me just say you ever felt jealousy you got a choice don't you embrace it a rejected come to your choice you ever felt angered that first moment it hit you your choice embrace it reject it well if the presence of demons who are Fallen Angels bring envy and Malice and jealousy what about when the feeling to worship comes what about the feeling to put your arm around somebody saying I love you and I appreciate you as a brother what about that being the I think we got a decision I think we can decide to reject it or to embrace it and I tell you what I want to do I want to embrace the power of the Holy Ghost I want to Pro in my pres of God let me worship you under the influence of angels under the influence of the Holy matter of fact brother I wouldn't mind to get so trun and I forgot who my name was and somebody said well he was preaching Under the Influence tonight I'm going to preach under the influence and declare things that I can't see said well I feel funny but said it's Angels making me feel that way it's angels in the atmosphere that's right now watch what happens if that atmosphere is real if that if that realm is real can I get you to believe me that that realm is there can let me just say this you're in here right now and Brother David Paul look at that wall sitting right there you see that wall it it's a it's like a barrier I promise you there's something on the other side all right and you say to me but Wayne I want a drink and I said well you're going to have to get out of here and go through there to get what you're looking for amen if you don't believe that there's something outside that wall you'll stay in this tent and even if you're hungry or you're starving whatever need and I said you got to go outside to get it if you don't believe that there's an outside to those walls you'll never get it but if you believe that there's that does only a par it's only a barrier and it can be moved and it can be torn and it can be open and there's a whole lot on out there listen to me sometimes you got to break out the barriers that's been placed on your mind and somebody saying to you it's just unel it's just unbelief it's not real it's not real depression is not real it's just a barrier to keep you from joy and happiness listen the sun is shining outside your depression son is shine outside your nervousness there is peace there is Joy outside your sin there is there but you better break out of it yall know the prophet a little chicken try to get out of EG he said it's got to Peck its way out it's got to get out of it but you know the beauty of it is that everything that little chicken needs to get out of that egg is in the egg with ever you need to get out of the situation you're in it's in you right now it's only inside of you right now God ping on S and the voice of faith is saying to you break out of the faith break out of it tonight don't you just come here just come here and enjoy being in the tent get out get out and experience God get out of your dimensional real of I'm sorry and I can't do it it's just more than I tell you when I've sinned away my day and there's no way I can make it it's too late for me it's a [Applause] lie it's not [Applause] true every human being is a spirit and you have to break from one dimension to another that's a prophet yes sir he said you are a spirit and you don't have to go anywhere but sitting in your seat you can move out of depression into Joy you can travel sitting in your seat said one time what we need is more Soul travel he said see what's traversing the prayer he said so traveling that's what happens you travel out of something into something else you travel by the spirit you can travel now Willam brandom literally traveled you've heard you've heard witchcraft people talk about they get out of their body and go try to put curses on stuff in people listen a true prophet in this age left his body and went places and come back and said to a man your house is this color your your floor is this color your child is this sick this is what's happening because he went there and come back and then LED people into Faith to believe I've already been there and God's going to change the situation amen because he knew a man could travel if a man can travel in his spirit and I can tell you this tonight if we could teach you how to break out of your spiritual barrier you can find the home you can find what you're looking for you can find the desire that you're searching for because you can break out every [Applause] time now I I'll just read what a prophet said he said he broke all the sound barriers amen amen and all the reason barriers and went beyond reasoning and beyond anything else Jesus went beyond all reasons wouldn't that be wouldn't that be amazing tonight if I said you could receive the Holy Ghost you said well I can't because see that's a reason you you give me a reason why why somebody can't be saved you give me a reason why somebody can't be healed you give me a reason why Jesus went beyond the reason and look at the power of that because he says you can do the same thing you can take God at his word and go beond the reason brother ad said this is an astronaut age a preacher what are you talking about it's the age that man broke out of Gravity Man didn't just break the sound barrier in this age he broke the gravity barrier in this age he literally went beyond his own abilities and God gave him away and brother BR said any man or any woman he says God been able to do it by his church a spiritual people who will believe a man or woman who will dare at any time to take God at his word is an astronaut now the prophet says in faith of Abraham you'll never receive the Holy Ghost in his fullness you'll never walk in the spirit of God until you totally separate your things from unbelief amen you got to get away from the world you got to come out of the world and Sh brother says it doesn't take too much prayer it takes some believing that's powerful Church CU I've seen peopleall that have met barriers in prayer because they just wouldn't believe anybody that's been in church long has seen it you've seen people that visit the altar almost on a regular basis and they weep and cry and they go back to their seat and they got the same problem they had when they came up they went cuz they're praying and they're praying and they're praying let me tell you what a prophet said he said you can pray till you get blue in the face but until you change your confession until you change your confession now long does it take it takes trust it takes trust to change confessions and there ain't nobody can come up here and take your sin away there's nobody can give you a wife across the head or a shake of the hand to take away the problem you're having come on Amen what removes the barrier of your problem is your absolute faith in the blood of Jesus Christ you look at that blood and you say Satan I'm no one get you but the blood P the price for me and I will not carry this another day but by the blood of Jesus Christ I believe I'm saved I believe I'm Healed I believe I'm forgiven now your faith has took a hold of the promise of God and you're ready to get outside the Buri you're ready to take off out you know you while because you made no longer hell come on you make a ritual out of prayer come on Muslims pray Hindus pray Christians pray and believe they don't just pray and pray and pray they believe the word of [Applause] God by gra you are saved and that is true faith and everyone of them that believed be baptized in the name of Jesus it didn't say come and pray for 5 hours make a ritual out of it you make a you'll make a way for the devil to cause somebody to Totally Miss God because they keep praying and praying and praying when the answer's already here when the power of God is already released what you need is Faith to break into that soul and say Yes Lord I [Applause] believe I know that's theologically challenging you're saved by what you believe come now you're healed by what you [Applause] believe so at some point you got to and I believe in prayer folks it's the most powerful weapon there is good but if you're praying without believing come on you know what I'm talking about right amen Lord go do Lord go do yeah Lord go do like he some Aaron boy come on you know some people been to God for forgiveness for the same thing 25 times come on and after the first time he started saying what are you talking thank have you ever had people come to you and they was upset at you and they said something and you said okay ain't no problem and really it wasn't a problem to start with cuz You' already kind of just forgot about it yeah they had to remind you what they said you know and you're like well hey no problem I love you man don't ever let that be a problem next time you see them they got their head down a little funny what's matter with them you're ready for Hardy you know ready enjoy them and love them and got that funny look think I do something ain't even treating me right what's going on here you're talking to him well you know I said that well we talked about that last time we saw each other come on and that person just can't let it go you know what that's called it's called a crutch it's called something that keeps you from normalizing your relationship with other people preach out here you don't want to normalize it cuz you don't want to mix in the crowd come on you don't want to be a part of things you don't want to normalize things you don't want to forgive and accept forgiveness and you don't want to just normalize it and move on with life but people do that with their Christian experience they want to get saved every Saturday night they want to get saved every Tuesday night every weekend they want to come get saved again come get saved again come get saved again folks I'm telling you there's Life be on the altar it's a Christian Life to leave there's a man to accept the blood and said God save me if a man that gets the Holy Ghost he a seal from the day of redemption there ain't no going back there

telling you this unbelief is a demon power I'm listening to what a prophet of God said he said there's something in your heart you want to be a Christian but there's something won't let you be a Christian is that right he said I say it's the devil and that's unbelief do you believe that I said Do you believe if I ask God he'd break the power of that unbelief do you know people sitting in this room right now would have been saved when they was comeing to the age of canil I seen them I seen people that would have been saved I I watched my nephew Jared I watched him for years you all know Jared no matter where he God what he done he talked to me I said God going to get you cuz I can see it in than Lord I remember when Matt was in seventh grade he was going his own way even Sarah got married and he was going his own way he can tell you this and I take him out to eat not hang out with them something other people say you're wasting your time you're wasting your time but I can say [Music] something I could see that if that Spirit of unbelief would get away from that seed he would lead people to God I seen an influential person that would influence others if he get that Spirit of unbelief away from him he'd be a Powerhouse turns out I was right there comes out on Rock com out on [Applause] rock you I was claiming young men PA turn out that a mother's player can break the powers of hell you can't turn the situation around turn out turn out turn out and God can bring a back he can bring a can I just say it to you the dev prophesied over a lot of you people was a l when

I don't know the Tabernacles here there a lot of you here I tell you what as a child of God as a deliver of God I believe this I personally believe that Satan does not have the right over your future I just don't believe it amen I don't believe it young lady I don't know your name but I know this God has a plan for you and Satan don't control your future God's the one that control your future God knows that boy's name God knows who you're supposed to be God knows cuz God is a God who understands the future and the devil's a liar from the beginning he lied to your mama he lied to your daddy now he's trying to lie to you let me tell you I'm not taking the LIE Satan does not have the right to prophesy over my future he is not a prophet he is not God matter in fact he's a fallen angel and the prophet of God told us a Son of God has more Authority on Earth than an angel in heaven what about a fallen angel about a fallen Ang say something in your feet tonight let me tell you how the purpose let me tell how you brise the devil you take everything he said and you throw it down and mother car you take your cowboy boots and you stop on everything the devil said your future will be this way your future will be this way cast it down and stop on and say s you I'll be a Son of God I'll be a daughter of God I'll be filled with the Holy Ghost I you in the church if God all things all things are [Applause] possible you know what you can do with faith tonight you can take faith and believe for salvation you can believe for the filling of the Holy Ghost you can believe for different Liv Spirit mothers mothers can believe for the Salvation of the and while he was preaching the adoption series he goes to the book of Isaiah and he said the Bible said they shall be there with their offsprings he said mothers that's a token for you you will be there with your offsprings can I say it that's just sayth the Lord whatever it looks like forget it whatever you think about it forget take the of the prophet and say that's the truth brother that's the truth brother my sons will be not like Sons that's the truth of the create a faith create an anointing in your life create an anointing in your home I'm going take him too far it's a lie he don't know the future he can't look in the future he don't know anything about tomorrow that devil don't know about tomorrow he don't know about anything about tomorrow he's just trying to take away the joy today and make it seem like something tomorrow but if his lies are trying to AFF the future you got to ask yourself what the future must be for Satan to be so interested the devil's that interested in you what must God have plan for [Applause] you Hallelujah I don't believe the devil I don't want to hear this nonsense [Applause] said his new ministry was he said it was to curse the devil that's what he said he said to speak to it to speak to the life that's in the cancer to speak the life that's in the disease to speak to the life that's that unbelief to curse that thing so you what that's put us sister Jennifer that's puts at Mountain Moving Faith at Mountain move in other words it's a mountain in front of you but who are thou oh Mountain who are you that says we can't go through this land we serve a God that said say to the mountain be th Mo and God can move mountains it's Mountain Moving [Applause] for come on it's the of Christ Ming tell you it's time to turn the tide you know what that means tide turning faith in other words situations that's been going this way you can prophesy you can speak the word you can get the belief on you and say Satan I know it's been that way but it won't be that way no [Applause] more preacher are you trying to get out of these people let me just say something to you the Bible said hold the conf confession of faith that he's the high priest of our confession and that's the word of [Applause] God other words when God put the Moon Over the oceans do you know that the ocean it obeys the moon and the moon never [Music] strains the moon never strains now I hate to say it this way but the moon don't even have pram me the moon has an authority that God gave him and he said I give you authority over every Serpent and over fouling crawling things and I give you authority over sickness and over dead and in my name you shall cast out devils and in my name you shall heal the sick and raise the dead you see there's an authority given to this church don't you surrender your Authority tonight don't you let the devil talk you out of your way don't you let him tell you oh you're just a nobody it don't matter what you think and it don't matter what you say listen even and I even to the youngest and smallest Christian Among Us the prophet said when the weakest Christian begins to go on their knees begins to [Applause] trous because you're not standing by yourself in a body and even if you was the skin even if you were the skin on the bottom of the feet of Jesus it said he has been lifted up and all things have been put under his feet it does matter tonight Church what condition of what the devil's done first of all he's a liar and he's trying to move you into a position where he might take authority by his life here's a prophet that comes in yeah he begins to preach Faith to you and you think it's a real simple thing come on now Faith just like a just like a little side note Faith you know just some little sermon some somebody didn't have anything else to preach so they just preach faith is what will let a young woman stand in the face of the enemy say my Lord has G me authority [Applause] over for the glory god and the whole [Applause] worlden do [Applause] that I I don't believe friends I don't believe the LI the I've seen lies I've seen lies that look like it was over come on now I see I heard what people say Well they're done they can't never I I se I've seen the I've seen it and I've seen it prophesied over them and I've heard people say those things but you know when you do you know when it's over come on [Applause] now I said it ain't finished don't count us out it ain't done it ain't done yet you know tonight friends I believe yes Lord that you can declare multi-dimensions I believe you can stand in this Dimension and declare another dimension right but you're doing it by faith amen faith is not an imagination that's right that's right amach it come on I might I might have to come back sometime and preach a whole sermon on prayer so you know I believe in prayer we believe it brother quit using prayer as a [Music] crutch [Music] let me ask you something if you if you prayed and cried for an hour would you be any more [Music] saved than a person said Lord I accept you on Amen a person is sorry for their sins and you repent to God but I only believe in DED confessions I get all but you've seen people that you you've watched them year after after year they never come to something real but it's because they're using even prayer itself if become a CH yeah and they're explaining to God how bad they are and they're explaining why they can't and they're explaining on but it to break a barrier in your existence now I've been in the ministry a while I talk to Ministries to break a barrier in your ministry it takes faith cuz the devil's going to tell to you well you went as far as you can go things are going to fade away from here this is going to be and if you believe that that's your ceiling right there but if you can believe that the words of this message can change the entire Earth and I might not be nobody and I might not know nothing but I believe this message message and I'll declare it in the face of the president God will LIF you in places you teach the people you'll say things you could never dream what God could because the barrier has been removed can I tell you won't you make your won't you won't you make your ceiling your [Music] floor what you what you what you think is a ceiling right now make that your floor quit let you see get stand you can do it as a Christian you can do it s as far as you to go your experien your pray life you can't see a vision you can't have a dream you can't you can't you can't have the prophecies you can't listen the devil's just trying to make a barrier over you and if you believe it don't believe believe it that's right all things are every promise in this book belongs to me that's right brother you look what happen you'll start raising you start climbing up in faith and you'll start declaring things you can't see look at you awful funny but then 10 years down the road they go you know what he right because your Fai is an expression your works is an expression of your fa that's right brother true can change things if you believe in absolutely you know honestly I might have more confidence in you than you do you may have less confidence in you than I have you on come on cuz you know all that other stuff
