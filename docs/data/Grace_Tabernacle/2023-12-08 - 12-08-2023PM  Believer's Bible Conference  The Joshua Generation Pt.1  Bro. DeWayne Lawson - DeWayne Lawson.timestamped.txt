[5:16] we want to our third Bible Conference
[5:20] that we've had and and I just want to
[5:23] it's a privilege to be able to welcome
[5:25] you say God bless you and look forward
[5:27] to what God has in store and I think
[5:30] that song was about fitting to what this
[5:31] conference is about of the Joshua
[5:34] generation amen I believe we're living
[5:36] as the Bride of Jesus Christ in the
[5:38] season of rapture and so we're just
[5:40] looking forward to what God has in store
[5:43] in these meetings and and I just wanted
[5:45] to to greet everyone at the opening of
[5:47] the meeting and say God bless you and
[5:50] thank you for for coming and being a
[5:52] part of this meeting and uh just uh just
[5:55] a few years ago we had I had been in a
[5:58] meeting s similar to this and the Lord
[6:01] had really uh touched my heart my family
[6:04] and and made a big change in us and our
[6:07] ministry and just a few years later we
[6:10] had brother Wayne and I had had it on
[6:13] our heart and it was something that was
[6:14] on my heart and it was something that
[6:15] was on his heart and so when we came
[6:18] together about it it just seemed to
[6:20] seemed to be the right time and and so
[6:22] we we had we had came over and looking
[6:25] for places and different areas just for
[6:27] a place that we could have a family camp
[6:29] a typ meeting where people could come I
[6:31] know there's a lot of Youth meetings and
[6:33] and everybody drops off their kids and
[6:35] they and they just have a time but there
[6:37] not a lot of places where families can
[6:39] go and have that kind of meeting so we
[6:41] just had it on our heart to do it and
[6:44] and and not to not for the purpose of
[6:47] any church but just to to establish the
[6:49] message in the hearts of Believers and
[6:52] we we' had this meeting as a as a as a a
[6:55] foundation or or a platform just to
[6:58] edify the message to the hour in
[7:00] people's hearts and so brother Wayne has
[7:02] been spending all year getting ready for
[7:04] this meeting so there's there's no limit
[7:07] to what God can do and there ain't no
[7:09] telling what God has in store but I just
[7:11] want to say as we're opening the meeting
[7:13] I appreciate the brother's support and
[7:14] our local assembly for coming and and
[7:17] working in the meeting whether being PR
[7:19] their assembly and and just been a huge
[7:22] support and making it happen all our
[7:24] ministry Brothers coming and to have a
[7:26] meeting like this everybody that here is
[7:29] here is here for the same purpose we
[7:30] want to grow in the word and draw closer
[7:33] to God and and to be able to have the
[7:36] Lord do something in our hearts and I
[7:38] just wanted to read this to you out of
[7:39] the message conferences as we're
[7:42] starting and brother said let's just
[7:44] have a conference somebody say amen he
[7:47] said let's just have a conference and
[7:48] let's see if we don't need a little love
[7:50] one for another let's see if it wouldn't
[7:52] kind of cure the thing if we could just
[7:55] had a love and respects and more one for
[7:57] another will you do that I want wonder
[7:59] how many can say that tonight that's
[8:01] good let's just have a conference with
[8:02] the Lord and that's what this meeting is
[8:04] about so uh I know there's a little bit
[8:06] of Kinks and things they work out with a
[8:08] sound and trying to do a meeting in a in
[8:10] a hotel like this but they given us the
[8:12] room and the liberty so you just you
[8:14] just come and worship the Lord according
[8:16] to the dictates of your heart and and
[8:18] just come to to receive something from
[8:20] the Lord and draw out of the gift that
[8:21] God has placed in our in our midst and
[8:24] so we just appreciate brother Wayne and
[8:26] taking the time and his family for being
[8:28] here with us look forward to what God
[8:30] has in store so maybe if we can just bow
[8:32] our heads together and and if you have
[8:34] something this weekend that is just a
[8:36] real desire on your heart just start
[8:38] putting it before the Lord over the next
[8:39] few days and and ask the Lord to come
[8:42] and just minister to us but each one
[8:44] maybe if those this by you you Brothers
[8:46] maybe join hands together and won't we
[8:48] just each one just ask the Lord to come
[8:50] and and I know this building has been
[8:52] used for many things as you know they

[51:48] Joshua if you can and
[51:52] uh I think it's a tremendous reading
[51:55] here
[51:56] now after the death of Moses the servant
[51:58] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[52:00] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of n
[52:03] Moses is Minister
[52:05] saying Moses my servant is dead now
[52:10] therefore arise and go over this Jordan
[52:13] thou and all the people under the L
[52:16] which I will give to them even to the
[52:18] children of Israel every place that the
[52:20] soul of your foot shall fed upon that I
[52:22] have given unto you as I said unto Moses
[52:26] now from the Wilderness and leanon even
[52:28] unto the Great River the river Euphrates
[52:30] and the land of the hites and the great
[52:32] sea toward the Ping down to the sun
[52:34] shall be your
[52:35] Cod there shall not any man be able to
[52:38] stand before thee all the days of thy
[52:41] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[52:45] with thee I shall not fail thee nor
[52:48] forsake thee don't you know Joshua was
[52:50] having the fit right there amen this is
[52:53] a God's covenant Commission Joshua right
[52:56] here now there shall not be any man
[52:58] stand before thee all the days of thy
[52:59] life neither as I was with Moses so I
[53:03] will be with thee I will not fail thee
[53:05] nor forsake thee be strong and of good
[53:09] courage For unto this people sht thou
[53:13] divide for an inheritance in the land
[53:15] which I
[53:17] swear unto their fathers to give them
[53:20] now here's the commission over Joshua's
[53:22] life all right I'm giving you the job
[53:25] josua to divide this land under the
[53:28] people who I promised it to now now
[53:31] never mind there's people living on it
[53:33] never mind there's wall cities and
[53:34] Giants and there's going to be a lot of
[53:36] battles and all that that has nothing to
[53:38] do with the commission he's been given
[53:40] he's been told to divide this land and
[53:42] give it to these people who I said can
[53:45] have and only thou be strong and very
[53:48] courageous that thou May to observe to
[53:50] do all according to the law which Moses
[53:52] my servant commanded thee now turn not
[53:54] from to the right hand but to the left
[53:57] that thou mayest Prosper wheresoever
[54:00] thou Hest now this book of the law shall
[54:03] not depart out of thy mouth but thou
[54:05] shall meditate therein day and night
[54:08] that thou mayest observe to do according
[54:09] to that is written therein for then thou
[54:11] sh make thy way prosperous and thou sht
[54:14] have good good success have not I
[54:18] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[54:21] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[54:24] dism
[54:25] for the Lord God thy God is with thee
[54:29] wheresoever thou goest amen let's turn
[54:33] to the book of Ephesians if we can and
[54:36] let's read the book of Ephesians and
[54:38] we'll read the first nine verses of
[54:46] EP now Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[54:49] to the will of God to the Saints which
[54:50] are of emphasis into the faithful in
[54:53] Christ Jesus now Grace be to you and
[54:56] peace from God our Father for the Lord
[54:58] Jesus Christ blessed be the God and the
[55:00] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[55:02] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[55:05] in Heavenly places now according as he
[55:08] has chosen Us in him before the
[55:10] foundation of the world that we should
[55:12] be holy without lame before your love
[55:15] having predestinated us unto the
[55:18] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[55:20] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:21] of his will now to the praise of the
[55:24] glory of his wherein he had made us
[55:26] accepted in the blood in whom we have
[55:28] Redemption through his blood the
[55:31] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[55:32] riches of his grace where abounded
[55:34] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[55:37] having made known unto us the mystery of
[55:40] his will according to the good pleasure
[55:42] which he have purposed in
[55:46] himself amen uh if we could let's just
[55:49] bow our hearts this afternoon for a word
[55:51] of prayer most gracious father we thank
[55:54] you this evening Lord for the Gathering
[55:56] of this Congregation of people around
[55:58] your word and Lord we've congregated
[56:01] here in this area Lord just something
[56:03] Lord that we felt may be a neutral Place
[56:06] Lord for hearts to come together for
[56:08] believers Lord that father we just want
[56:11] to be thankful tonight that we could be
[56:13] identified Lord Lord not just by the
[56:16] church we attend or Lord by the by the
[56:20] ideas that we gather with but Lord that
[56:22] blood tag that you have given to your
[56:25] children Lord we come together tonight
[56:27] Lord on level ground each one of us
[56:30] comeing to the Cross Lord where there's
[56:31] no big big ones no little ones there's
[56:34] no important ones there's no simple ones
[56:36] Lord we're all one in you and we stand
[56:39] at the cross needing each one of us the
[56:41] same thing from you but Lord we ask you
[56:44] that while we stand up and walk away
[56:47] with the blood upon our hearts Lord that
[56:49] you would direct us Lord to the things
[56:51] that you would have us to do the places
[56:53] you would have us to go now tonight as
[56:55] we enter your word we ask that you would
[56:57] bless these meetings may you bless them
[56:59] Lord for this visible audience for those
[57:02] that will be watching tonight I pray and
[57:04] Lord whoever would watch this in the
[57:06] future may it be taken with the
[57:08] intention Lord that you put in our
[57:10] hearts that it would be only a blessing
[57:12] and encouragement to your children we
[57:14] ask for these things father in the
[57:16] mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[57:20] and amen God bless you tonight amen if
[57:23] you just had your seats we'd like to
[57:24] talk to you a little bit about this uh
[57:27] about this if uh if we can we're going
[57:29] to be talking to you about the Joshua
[57:30] generation amen but I I think it's a
[57:33] powerful thing uh we call it the Joshua
[57:36] generation of course what we're talking
[57:37] about is we're talking about the
[57:39] generation after Moses uh who who
[57:42] actually didn't just uh wasn't just the
[57:45] children of Israel but they were the
[57:46] children of Israel who were moving into
[57:48] the promises which God had gave them it
[57:51] was a it was a season of change a
[57:53] generation of change change it was a
[57:55] generation moving not receiving promises
[57:59] but moving into promises and getting
[58:01] what God had promised other Generations
[58:04] they were now receiving amen they wasn't
[58:06] there to write scripture they were there
[58:08] to fulfill scripture they wasn't there
[58:11] amen uh looking for a prophet they had a
[58:13] prophet they had the word they knew what
[58:16] they were to do and they were just going
[58:18] to move into amen amen and we want to
[58:20] just take a minute tonight to uh maybe
[58:23] as we introduce some of these things to
[58:25] you I believe that it would help us as a
[58:27] New Testament Church as a people to
[58:29] recognize uh that brother Ral preach
[58:32] four parts on the message adoption if
[58:34] you have not familiarized yourself with
[58:37] those it'd be good for you uh there's
[58:39] actually four different sermons brother
[58:41] teaches on it it's amazing sermons uh
[58:43] and in these brother Ram actually tells
[58:46] us in the first uh book adoption he
[58:48] tells us something powerful and he says
[58:50] that this book of Ephesians in my
[58:53] opinion is one of the greatest books
[58:54] books of the New Testament it leaves us
[58:57] where Calvinism runs out on the Lim and
[59:00] arenium runs out on the limb but the
[59:02] book of Ephesians draws it all together
[59:05] and positionally places the believer
[59:08] amen now y'all know one side arminianism
[59:10] is legalism and that's about you work
[59:12] your way into into the things of God if
[59:15] you're working in a certain way you get
[59:16] something if you don't work a certain
[59:18] way you don't get it and then on the
[59:20] other side Calvinism goes out into the
[59:22] side if you're predestinated why try any
[59:24] right amen why have an Al call why have
[59:27] Services why have Evangel they go way
[59:30] out of the other side what's going to
[59:31] happen is going to happen amen but the
[59:33] prophet of God said the truth is right
[59:35] in between amen a predestinated people
[59:38] by Grace receives from God and he gives
[59:41] them a free gift of Grace and they have
[59:44] eternal salvation so it's not what you
[59:46] work it's what you receive from God he
[59:48] said that then it comes together on love
[59:50] right amen that you love God and and and
[59:53] that you're moving on so this book of
[59:55] Ephesians actually begins to take people
[59:58] who are already born again and begins to
[1:00:01] show them where they belong in Christ
[1:00:04] now the prophet says it like this he
[1:00:06] says in adoption he says this I'd like
[1:00:08] to say this that this book of Ephesians
[1:00:11] perfectly parallels the Old Testament
[1:00:13] Joshua Ephesians the book of Ephesians
[1:00:16] it's a perfect type see I typ it with
[1:00:19] Joshua if you've notied the Israel was
[1:00:21] brought up out of Egypt and there were
[1:00:22] three stages of their Journey one stage
[1:00:24] was leaving he said the next stage was
[1:00:26] the journey and the next stage was in
[1:00:28] Canaan he said now these Canan does not
[1:00:31] represent the age of a millennium he
[1:00:34] said it only represents the age of the
[1:00:36] Overcomer it is the dispensation of
[1:00:39] overcoming because Canaan they killed
[1:00:42] and burned and took cities and
[1:00:44] everything else amen so in Canaan is
[1:00:46] where they inherited possessions but
[1:00:49] they had to overcome to get them and
[1:00:51] that's why the New Testament Bible would
[1:00:53] say to them that overcome shall inherit
[1:00:55] all things right so this is an
[1:00:58] inheritance uh that God has given amen
[1:01:01] but it's something you're going to have
[1:01:03] to This Book of Joshua actually it's a
[1:01:07] book actually it's a book now of
[1:01:10] redemption the Old Testament Joshua and
[1:01:13] we have to consider it the book of
[1:01:14] redemption because it's a Redemption has
[1:01:16] two parts See Redemption always has two
[1:01:20] parts it's an out of and an into it
[1:01:23] takes two parts of redemption see now
[1:01:26] Moses represented the law which brought
[1:01:28] them out of Egypt and Joshua represents
[1:01:31] the grace that took them in the promised
[1:01:33] land amen see the law and the grace were
[1:01:35] two after different aspects of God's
[1:01:38] command the law brought them out under
[1:01:40] Moses but Joshua took them in he said
[1:01:43] now this represents something for our
[1:01:46] day now they are all the way back in the
[1:01:49] scripture Moses bringing them out Joshua
[1:01:52] putting them in and brother said it's
[1:01:53] going to repr represents something for
[1:01:55] our day it represents our journey amen
[1:01:58] their Egypt into the promised land
[1:02:01] represents Us coming out of chaos and
[1:02:04] going into the promised land or In My
[1:02:07] Father's House of many mansions and if
[1:02:09] it were not so I would not have told you
[1:02:11] amen amen you see it's God leading the
[1:02:14] church not into a natural land but into
[1:02:17] a spiritual inhabitance so into a
[1:02:20] spiritual land as a gentile we have a
[1:02:22] spiritual land the tells us in the
[1:02:25] adoption of course this is being
[1:02:27] positioned in the promise of the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost is that right that's where our
[1:02:32] position lies is in the Holy Ghost we
[1:02:34] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:36] and and that's a great experience in our
[1:02:39] lives but what we're looking for tonight
[1:02:41] is not just to experience the holy ghost
[1:02:43] in a birth but we're talking about the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost positioning Us in the word to
[1:02:48] give us of Faith as a Sons and Daughters
[1:02:50] of the Living God you see what it is in
[1:02:53] Joel 2 he said I pour out my spirit
[1:02:55] there's your promise it's a spiritual
[1:02:57] promise do you see God in Ephesians 1
[1:03:00] and3 said Paul said it like this after
[1:03:03] that you have heard the word of truth
[1:03:05] and you have trusted you receive the
[1:03:07] spirit of Promise that's it is a spirit
[1:03:10] of Promise in Luke 24:49 it was Jesus
[1:03:13] said go out under the upper room and
[1:03:16] receive the promise of my father of
[1:03:19] course he's talking about Isaiah 28 with
[1:03:21] the Bible We Stand another tongue will I
[1:03:23] speak under these people and this shall
[1:03:25] be the refreshing remember Jesus said
[1:03:27] the rest come unto me and I will give
[1:03:30] you rest said what is that rest it was
[1:03:33] zoy life amen he was going to give them
[1:03:36] zoy life he going to give them rest amen
[1:03:39] not wondering anymore if I lost or
[1:03:41] unsaved not wondering anymore am I going
[1:03:44] to make it am I not going to make it I'm
[1:03:46] talking about coming out of the land of
[1:03:48] wondering wondering one day to the next
[1:03:51] do
[1:03:52] I youall know yall know me been hearing
[1:03:54] me preach for years I believe in
[1:03:56] experience with God I believe in all
[1:03:57] calls I believe in getting yourself in
[1:03:59] the place with God but many of you
[1:04:01] sitting here tonight and received a new
[1:04:03] birth years ago many of you had the Holy
[1:04:06] Ghost a long time but the devil's been
[1:04:08] trying to run you around to figure out
[1:04:11] are you going to make a rapure you're
[1:04:12] not going to make a rapure you're going
[1:04:13] to be saved you're not going to be saved
[1:04:15] you have a good day so you feel way down
[1:04:17] up here you have a bad day and you feel
[1:04:19] way down here but there's got to come a
[1:04:21] time in your life when you take the of
[1:04:24] God and begin to live a solid Christian
[1:04:27] Life not up and down in the altars not
[1:04:30] in out of the world but to satisfy your
[1:04:34] soul upon the word of the Living God to
[1:04:37] stand amen when the weather's bad when
[1:04:39] the weather's good when the day is bad
[1:04:42] and the day is good you're just as saved
[1:04:44] on your bad day as you are on your good
[1:04:47] day I'm going in the Rapture of my bad
[1:04:50] day and on my good day because nothing
[1:04:53] amen that is day has anything to do with
[1:04:56] God's election upon your life and if you
[1:04:59] begin to believe like that you can live
[1:05:02] above the devil you can live above
[1:05:04] everything the enemy says according to
[1:05:06] your life I'm talking about a higher
[1:05:08] place in Christ set our feet up in
[1:05:11] Heavenly places amen you see it's a
[1:05:14] spiritual land the promise that's been
[1:05:16] given to this church is not a natural
[1:05:19] land it's a spiritual land it's not a
[1:05:22] natural but it's a spiritual that's why
[1:05:24] they call it a Promised
[1:05:26] Land just as God promised unto Abraham
[1:05:30] he would give him a land and Genesis the
[1:05:32] 12th chapter God told Abraham to get up
[1:05:35] out of Babylon amen out of that place of
[1:05:38] confusion right get up out of the valley
[1:05:40] of sheni get out of this city of
[1:05:42] confusion amen and move to a land which
[1:05:45] you don't even know about but a land
[1:05:48] that I'll give you and I'll get the seed
[1:05:50] after you and it'll be your land right
[1:05:54] because Abraham didn't need to stay down
[1:05:56] there in the valley of Shar and try to
[1:05:58] convince all of those pagans that there
[1:06:00] was only one God they wouldn't never
[1:06:02] believe it all his whole life would just
[1:06:04] be alive to fight so God said get out of
[1:06:06] this land and I'll make a nation under
[1:06:09] myself amen I'll make you see as the
[1:06:12] stars of the heavens as the Sands of the
[1:06:13] sea amen and thou sh be a blessing unto
[1:06:16] all people you see a powerful thing that
[1:06:19] God was promising this man if you just
[1:06:21] believe me if you just walk in me I'll
[1:06:25] give unto you this land in Genesis the
[1:06:27] 12th chapter God promised this his land
[1:06:30] God made the promise un them in Genesis
[1:06:33] 26 the Bible told us he said that God
[1:06:35] told his seed I will give me this land
[1:06:38] and I will give these countries and I
[1:06:40] will perform the oath that I swear un
[1:06:42] Abraham thy father and again in Genesis
[1:06:44] 28 he promises the seed Abram not just
[1:06:47] Abraham but the Seed of Abraham and I
[1:06:50] said the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:06:53] and the god of Isaac the land without th
[1:06:55] Li to thee I will give to thee thy seed
[1:06:58] Jacob even made the promise years later
[1:06:59] God said to land you're laying in I'll
[1:07:02] give it to you as a promise because God
[1:07:05] gave them the promised land that's why
[1:07:09] yah's having that war over there right
[1:07:10] now cuz he knows that's his land he
[1:07:13] knows that's his land as a Seed of
[1:07:16] Abraham he knows by the Jewish Line This
[1:07:19] land belongs to us no matter what the
[1:07:22] whole world says he knows he has a seed
[1:07:25] right to that land and his deed is not a
[1:07:28] deed written on any paper it is a deed
[1:07:32] by from almighty
[1:07:34] God the one that created the
[1:07:36] earth and the same thing tonight the
[1:07:39] very creator of the spirit of God is the
[1:07:42] one that gave you his spirit and gave
[1:07:44] you a position in that spirit and put
[1:07:46] you in a place that no devil whatever
[1:07:48] this position you again if you can hold
[1:07:50] to the word of God you see amen it's
[1:07:53] it's it's a very deep subject but I'll
[1:07:55] say to you like this Adam and Eve had a
[1:07:57] powerful position until Eve got to full
[1:08:00] in the ram of the word and she lost her
[1:08:02] place in inheritance amen and and and
[1:08:04] she forfeited her rights to that Garden
[1:08:07] is that right amen but God said I have
[1:08:09] another
[1:08:11] E I'll have another E that she will not
[1:08:14] Reas in this word she will not tell this
[1:08:16] word because she will be that way come
[1:08:20] on I'm not talk about you mising
[1:08:22] something I talk about who you are you
[1:08:24] are the word of the so I don't believe
[1:08:27] you de we are living manifestation of
[1:08:31] the word of the Living God have you ever
[1:08:33] seen that God anointed us and place in
[1:08:37] we're already in the
[1:08:39] wordness your positions what you're
[1:08:42] fulfilling tonight was written about
[1:08:44] thousands of years ago you begin to put
[1:08:47] your feet on that kind of gr right come
[1:08:49] on brother you begin to understand this
[1:08:50] belongs to me I was born from
[1:08:54] this is my name this is my inheritance
[1:08:57] this is my place you see the scripture
[1:09:00] tells us that this promise was given and
[1:09:02] it was passed on to the ages through
[1:09:04] Moses and Joshua Jacob and Isaac all
[1:09:07] these men even in Joshua 6 when Joshua
[1:09:10] was atent the walls of Jericho it was
[1:09:12] the Lord said unto him I have given thee
[1:09:14] this
[1:09:15] land Paul wrote In the book of Ephesians
[1:09:19] things that you're said in here with the
[1:09:21] now you might not maybe sometimes when
[1:09:23] you're
[1:09:24] really understand or catch but Paul is
[1:09:54] very quickly to you in the Book of
[1:09:55] Matthew the 20th chapter you can read
[1:09:57] where Jesus is there and there's two of
[1:10:00] his disciples and and the mother of Zeb
[1:10:03] and John Matthew 20 and and they said
[1:10:05] Lord would you allow my sons mother's
[1:10:08] prayers are powerful now would you allow
[1:10:10] my sons to sit at thy right hand and thy
[1:10:12] left hand to be baptized with your
[1:10:13] baptism to drink of your cup and he said
[1:10:16] well I'll let him drink of my cup and I
[1:10:17] let him be baptized I baptism but now
[1:10:19] these positions on my side with my prone
[1:10:22] said now it's not mind to give for these
[1:10:25] things have already been given they've
[1:10:28] already been granted by my father to
[1:10:30] another person and other man picks that
[1:10:33] up and he says who is that graned to he
[1:10:36] said it's the Overcomer of the L age
[1:10:40] amen all the way in the days of Jesus he
[1:10:42] was saying no you can't have this
[1:10:45] position now but when the test
[1:10:47] come the same test that Jesus was going
[1:10:51] through in Matthew the 14th chapter this
[1:10:53] bride would go through a test on the
[1:10:56] word and once the word was received amen
[1:10:59] that bride would be SE in the thr of
[1:11:02] almighty God and tonight Paul is telling
[1:11:06] us you will be lifted up into the
[1:11:08] Heavenly places and seated with God in
[1:11:11] the last days his positions were written
[1:11:13] back there but they were not fulfilled
[1:11:16] till down
[1:11:17] here now I can show it to you in another
[1:11:20] very beautiful uh ESS brother up and he
[1:11:24] says Isaiah now saw the heart of Satan
[1:11:27] and he said I will Ascend under the
[1:11:29] heavens and I will put myself above the
[1:11:31] stars of the heaven said that was the
[1:11:33] sons right and he wanted to come up into
[1:11:35] the North and make it to the throne
[1:11:37] that's why Satan wanted to get into the
[1:11:38] church cuz he going to make it to the
[1:11:40] throne and he knew the bride was going
[1:11:42] to the throne and God said I seen what
[1:11:45] was in your heart right but here in
[1:11:47] second Thessalonians Paul writes the
[1:11:50] same thing but then he shows that he
[1:11:53] says he sth in the temple of God acting
[1:11:56] as if he is God exalting himself above
[1:11:59] all that is called God now to you that's
[1:12:02] studying this I'll tell you what that is
[1:12:04] that's the Vindicated word of the edge
[1:12:06] the prophet said what Satan is doing is
[1:12:08] he's arguing with Vindicated word saying
[1:12:11] he's greater than God what what is it
[1:12:14] all that is called of God in the
[1:12:16] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:12:18] with God the Word was God he said the
[1:12:21] Vindicated word and should be ruling
[1:12:24] right but Satan comes against that
[1:12:27] anytime you hear somebody say well
[1:12:29] brother man's wrong on that you know
[1:12:30] what he's doing he's exalting his
[1:12:33] opinion above A God Called Prophet let
[1:12:36] me tell you the spirit com Straight Out
[1:12:38] of Hell the devil's job to this word to
[1:12:43] a Believer the devil
[1:12:46] knows just one word of this message he
[1:12:49] put you in his
[1:12:52] hand
[1:12:54] we the kingdom of God when the spirit
[1:12:57] the word
[1:13:00] power
[1:13:01] H yes sir man said the devil's position
[1:13:05] said Isaiah saw it in his heart he said
[1:13:09] Paul saw him in position but it's not
[1:13:11] till today that William brandom said
[1:13:14] he's now the god of his evil agent and
[1:13:16] he has
[1:13:18] achiev said he has achieved his desires
[1:13:21] by devaluing the word
[1:13:27] if he achieved his desires by valuing
[1:13:30] the world then there is god brother
[1:13:34] who's been wanting a church that he can
[1:13:36] fully manifest himself in he said he has
[1:13:40] now achieved a
[1:13:42] church on this rock I will will build my
[1:13:46] church Jesus prophesied that he do let
[1:13:49] me say something now that's no longer a
[1:13:51] prophecy the prophet is said he has now
[1:13:54] achieved his church I looking at a
[1:13:58] position by the message of the hour you
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:09] lost that's
[1:14:10] my she recognizes who she is and what
[1:14:14] she can do she will be in the mutal Army
[1:14:17] the adoption is not out in front of us
[1:14:19] the adoption is upon us to the is
[1:14:23] telling you who you are where you belong
[1:14:26] where you what
[1:14:32] of I'll be trying to twist that around
[1:14:36] too this pure word will set you next to
[1:14:44] God see these promises put you in
[1:14:48] position Joshua's job was to say to them
[1:14:53] people this is your
[1:14:57] portion now over there under Moses they
[1:15:00] could have took binoculars and looked
[1:15:02] over the river and said that part's mine
[1:15:04] some said well that part's mine some
[1:15:06] said well that part's mine hey but
[1:15:07] listen Joshua's job was to walk them
[1:15:11] over in the land and say this part is
[1:15:15] your
[1:15:16] part and we now find that Joshua has
[1:15:19] been risen up again in this age
[1:15:23] absolutely you see it's a time a time of
[1:15:27] God spiritual moving now we recognize
[1:15:30] that there actually is a movement in the
[1:15:32] end time amen that that would make the
[1:15:35] church move warm and formable it would
[1:15:38] just take all the anointing all the
[1:15:40] power of God away from brother man says
[1:15:42] it that this Apostolic age will not
[1:15:45] cease see as long as God is called God
[1:15:49] is still giving the Holy Ghost he's
[1:15:51] still worth it now I want you to watch
[1:15:53] something very clearly though had you
[1:15:55] been born under the time of Moses you
[1:15:58] would have been birthed your birth would
[1:16:00] have placed you in the
[1:16:01] wilderness right but after they crossed
[1:16:05] over in the Jordan the people that were
[1:16:07] born were born in the land now not there
[1:16:11] under Pentecost it was a new birth but
[1:16:14] when they were burned they were burned
[1:16:15] under confusion and no matter how long
[1:16:18] they liveed they remained in the age of
[1:16:21] confusion because it was the whole W but
[1:16:24] watch when God s a
[1:16:27] prophet people born we we still have new
[1:16:31] more babies but they birth into the land
[1:16:35] I Children s here I can to
[1:16:40] the because they had the
[1:16:43] answer and you might not know all the
[1:16:45] scriptures but you got the
[1:16:49] answer it it a great thing because
[1:16:51] there's a lot of people got all the
[1:16:52] script and no answer so they got a lot
[1:16:55] of questions but if you have the message
[1:16:58] you have the answer even you don't know
[1:17:00] all the
[1:17:02] scriptures you see this book that we're
[1:17:05] talking about tonight Joshua and
[1:17:07] Ephesians the Book of Joshua is the book
[1:17:09] of Ephesians of the New Testament so
[1:17:12] brother R says watch now this book is
[1:17:14] addressed to certain people this is not
[1:17:18] for
[1:17:20] everybody this is not for those who have
[1:17:23] not been
[1:17:25] born this is for people who have been
[1:17:28] born again and filled with the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost now the prophet tells us this he
[1:17:34] says it's election he said now we're
[1:17:36] going to have to get on that real strong
[1:17:38] you didn't you didn't become a Christian
[1:17:40] by
[1:17:42] coincidence you become a Christian
[1:17:45] before you was in this
[1:17:48] world I
[1:17:52] ask I need your hand really if you're a
[1:17:54] Christian I don't want to see him all
[1:17:56] right see if you're a Christian then I'm
[1:17:59] not talking to you about getting born
[1:18:01] again
[1:18:01] right I'm talking about how you got
[1:18:04] where you are I'm talking about what put
[1:18:06] you where you
[1:18:08] are see you didn't just get a desire I'm
[1:18:11] going to come to the Altar and get saved
[1:18:13] and then if I do wrong then I'm going to
[1:18:15] be lost but said you did you come to the
[1:18:17] altar because you were a seed the
[1:18:20] start and had you not had a seed you
[1:18:22] could have never been
[1:18:24] born I'm not I'm not a theologian but I
[1:18:27] I I'm just a simple he but every person
[1:18:30] in here that is a human being started
[1:18:33] out as a seed in their father and they
[1:18:35] come here as a human being and if you
[1:18:37] was the seed you're not
[1:18:40] born come on if you thece you MN but if
[1:18:43] you he it
[1:18:46] proves if you say here it's proof there
[1:18:49] was a seed before there was a you and if
[1:18:53] you were a Christian that was a seed
[1:18:54] that made you a
[1:18:57] Christian election brother said you got
[1:18:59] to get on Christian he says not by
[1:19:02] coincidence before the world began
[1:19:04] before you were born God obained you to
[1:19:06] be a Christian from the garden of of the
[1:19:08] very Foundation is that right right
[1:19:11] before there was ever before you know
[1:19:13] anything there was a time that you knew
[1:19:15] but your mind is darken to that now your
[1:19:20] mind is darken to that now I hate to ask
[1:19:23] but if you can EQ this thing it's got
[1:19:25] too much Bas in it puts me T there it's
[1:19:27] just ear mon amen there was a time that
[1:19:30] you knew that but your mind is darkened
[1:19:33] to that now now watch but man is telling
[1:19:36] you you were there but you don't
[1:19:37] remember being there right but there's
[1:19:40] only one man on Earth that never ever
[1:19:42] knew that and he said glorify me the
[1:19:44] Lord whichs I have it for the world he
[1:19:46] was the Incarnate God and he can move
[1:19:49] back there and know what it is but our
[1:19:51] minds have been blackened
[1:19:54] but we were ordained and predestinated
[1:19:56] you know what that predestination means
[1:19:58] it means preol by God that's not skin I
[1:20:03] believe that St you but we better go
[1:20:04] over now turn over me to Ephesians 1 and
[1:20:07] let's read it he said I'm afraid you're
[1:20:09] missing in just thinking now listen
[1:20:12] closely we'll go down to the church in a
[1:20:14] few minutes now Paul is speaking
[1:20:16] addressing Ephesians 1 directly to the
[1:20:19] shoulder of the church and that's what
[1:20:21] we're doing tonight this is not for
[1:20:23] babies this is for grownups this is not
[1:20:26] for babies listen now this is not for
[1:20:29] that I think in and little babies he
[1:20:32] said I got one little back there he says
[1:20:35] they learn to walk bump fall down and
[1:20:37] get back up he said thought they were
[1:20:39] doing something great he said but one
[1:20:41] day but now I'm a man and I'm going to
[1:20:43] put away childish things we've got to
[1:20:46] come to full
[1:20:48] Doctrine I like little shouting meetings
[1:20:51] where we clap our hands and Shout have a
[1:20:53] good time have great powerful services
[1:20:55] and things and dance on the Bubbles as
[1:20:57] it were but when the show time comes you
[1:21:01] don't know where you're standing we've
[1:21:04] got to get back and find out let's find
[1:21:07] out what's making us do that let's get
[1:21:10] back to the foundation and see where
[1:21:12] we're at see the foundation Paul Apostle
[1:21:15] will of God he says see no Seminary sent
[1:21:18] me out the will of God sent me out now
[1:21:20] watch he dresing the faith in Christ
[1:21:23] Jesus not to The Sinner not to the baby
[1:21:26] them that are grown up who's he
[1:21:28] addressing not a bunch of babies to
[1:21:31] people that are sitting in Heavenly
[1:21:33] places that be blessed you know
[1:21:34] something you've been taught and you've
[1:21:36] been saved and I want to tell you what
[1:21:38] it's about a that amazing say hey we
[1:21:42] might as well settle this point you're
[1:21:44] Sav let talk about what that's about
[1:21:47] because if you really have that
[1:21:49] discussion by the word then you're not
[1:21:52] going to Wonder tomorrow standing with
[1:21:55] God Amen now this book of Ephesians is
[1:21:59] not to
[1:22:01] everybody it's not for everybody good
[1:22:04] amen according to Genesis 17 God made
[1:22:07] his Covenant with Abraham and his seed
[1:22:11] that would be after him right Amen to I
[1:22:14] se I will establish it the Bible said
[1:22:16] let me just read Genesis 17 for th
[1:22:20] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[1:22:21] ABR but th name Shall be Called Abraham
[1:22:23] for the father of many nations and I
[1:22:26] will make thee exceeding fruitful and I
[1:22:29] will make the Nations and kings and
[1:22:31] shall come out of thee and I will
[1:22:34] establish my Covenant well then said
[1:22:36] that word establish should be
[1:22:38] predestinate so you can understand it I
[1:22:40] will establish or predestinate my
[1:22:43] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[1:22:45] seed after thee and generations for an
[1:22:48] Everlasting Covenant to be of God unto
[1:22:51] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[1:22:53] will give unto thee and thy seed after
[1:22:55] the the land th a stranger and that land
[1:22:57] of Canan for an everlasting possession I
[1:22:59] will be their God now now we look at
[1:23:02] that and we look back there and say then
[1:23:04] all of the Jews are the Sea of Abraham
[1:23:07] but in Galatians chapter 3 and verse 16
[1:23:10] Paul said now to Abraham and his seed
[1:23:12] were promises made and he saith not unto
[1:23:16] seeds as of many but as of one and that
[1:23:20] seed is Christ all right now watch unto
[1:23:23] the seed were all promises made many
[1:23:28] promises one seed Abraham had a lot of
[1:23:32] kids yeah Abraham knew Isaac was the
[1:23:36] natural blessing right Isaac but Isaac
[1:23:40] was not the true Seed of Abraham the
[1:23:43] Royal Seed of Abraham was not born in
[1:23:46] Abraham's day but Abraham saw his day
[1:23:50] but he live in his day but wa but Jesus
[1:23:53] when Jesus came what the true Seed of
[1:23:56] Abraham and through that seed all the
[1:23:59] nations of the Earth would be blessed
[1:24:01] now through Jesus in Christ would we
[1:24:05] become the Seed of Abraham that's why in
[1:24:08] Ephesians he said unto the faithful
[1:24:10] which are in Christ Jesus now how do we
[1:24:13] get in Christ we are baptized into
[1:24:16] Christ by the Holy
[1:24:18] Ghost right the Holy Ghost births you
[1:24:21] and I to
[1:24:23] deity it takes you from being just a
[1:24:26] human being to being a son or daughter
[1:24:30] of God making you a God man or a god
[1:24:34] woman I know you just think you're a
[1:24:36] home savior but that's not really
[1:24:39] true that's not really true there is a
[1:24:43] part of you that is deity that has been
[1:24:46] birth or ignited by the baptism of the
[1:24:49] spirit and now you are in Christ amen
[1:24:53] and being in Christ you are Abraham seed
[1:24:56] and you're heir to every promise that

[1:25:02] says in the Book of Romans there that we
[1:25:04] are air to God and join hes with Jesus
[1:25:08] Christ so everything that God gave Jesus
[1:25:12] he gave you and I through Jesus is every
[1:25:16] part come on Matthew 17 took me to the
[1:25:19] top of the mountain and said this is my
[1:25:21] beloved son hear you him and he
[1:25:24] positioned Jesus as the son who was
[1:25:27] appointed unto the air of all things and
[1:25:30] through that son comes all salvation
[1:25:33] comes all heing comes all anointing come
[1:25:36] all blessing and we can get into him by
[1:25:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if
[1:25:42] we're in that tonight everything God
[1:25:44] promised in Jesus
[1:25:49] prom so we ask ourselves tonight is the

[1:31:35] place where you can wh
[1:31:41] [Applause]
[1:31:45] Dev they're already in there I'm talking
[1:31:48] to this congregation this morning people
[1:31:50] that's already in there right
[1:31:52] now in paragraph 220 says it's like this
[1:31:55] who did it God and when did he do it
[1:31:58] before the world
[1:31:59] began and watch God did something before
[1:32:03] the world begin right he said but then
[1:32:07] he said you come in an illegitimate
[1:32:10] birth through Eve right into corruption
[1:32:14] on brother before your birth you were a
[1:32:18] part of God you come through a channel
[1:32:22] that brought you into the Earth
[1:32:24] illegitimate now y'all know some
[1:32:26] people's got a bunch of doctrines on
[1:32:28] illegitimate if if you ain't got the
[1:32:30] right parents you can't come in
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:34] rtion tell the truth if you wasn't
[1:32:36] raised right you wasn't part of the
[1:32:37] message I don't even know if you make it
[1:32:39] if your dad's a drk or amen if you come
[1:32:42] up out of a Catholic church or you had
[1:32:43] some kind of background rough maybe you
[1:32:45] didn't have an education but you got to
[1:32:47] have all these pedigrees According to
[1:32:48] some people got to come up under certain
[1:32:50] Ministries you got C Church cry this C
[1:32:55] Place been
[1:32:59] nons I don't care how
[1:33:01] youor make your parents you were part of
[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:10] God
[1:33:14] word said like this he said we were all
[1:33:17] illegitimately born through Adam he said
[1:33:20] that through Christ we have leg
[1:33:23] God made us all legitimate
[1:33:30] SE then if we come through an
[1:33:32] illegitimate birth ease corruption
[1:33:34] making all the children and subject to
[1:33:36] death then the Sovereign God has to make
[1:33:39] a way to redeem his children that's
[1:33:41] right all the father has given me will
[1:33:44] come now God making a way to redem his
[1:33:49] children yeah now I don't have time to
[1:33:52] preach it I want you to catch my thought
[1:33:54] God making a way right remember Daniel
[1:33:57] the lies diduh see Daniel needed a fence
[1:34:01] but God come down in the pillar of fire
[1:34:05] he made a way that wasn't a fence but
[1:34:08] God made a way he made a fence his own
[1:34:11] way right right amen Moses needed a
[1:34:14] bridge cross the Red Sea God made a way
[1:34:17] he open the Red
[1:34:18] Sea brother said he actually them to
[1:34:22] come to that point to show those people
[1:34:25] that when God needs to make a way he can
[1:34:28] make a way when there is
[1:34:31] no right so God made a way we we look at
[1:34:34] Calvary and we see Jesus bleeding and
[1:34:36] dying we see the blood and the spit and
[1:34:39] the nail Stars we what a horrible scene
[1:34:42] you say what's God doing making a
[1:34:46] way that was God's way of making a way
[1:34:50] right you see we brand come on the earth
[1:34:53] Kentucky IL No
[1:34:55] Education meeting an angel come out no
[1:34:57] denomination
[1:35:00] about them men were mad that kind of
[1:35:02] gift was in that kind of man they wanted
[1:35:05] somebody they can work with a little bit
[1:35:07] they wanted somebody who would give the
[1:35:09] rules of and include more people you
[1:35:12] know just set aside some of that harsh
[1:35:14] Holiness teaching and some of them ideas
[1:35:16] of Doctrine they wanted somebody if that
[1:35:19] gift could have just been in the land
[1:35:20] they wanted
[1:35:23] but it was God making
[1:35:26] away because God knew denomination can
[1:35:30] never put the bride in her
[1:35:32] position hallelujah
[1:35:34] hallelujah was going to send the prophet
[1:35:37] among who had no manmade connections who
[1:35:40] had no denominational parents who had no
[1:35:43] favors to play give certain group what
[1:35:46] was it it was God making a way to
[1:35:49] position this church
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:56] in the Paradox 1965 brother said used to
[1:35:59] be you can hand me a Bible and I can say
[1:36:02] what is my commission he said I can drop
[1:36:03] the Bible and we fall open with Joshua
[1:36:05] the first chapter yeah now that's a
[1:36:08] that's a heavy Bible and I'll tell you
[1:36:11] this Joshua's only a couple chapters in
[1:36:14] so there's some anti-ra stuff going on
[1:36:16] there
[1:36:18] some it opened Joshua the first chapter
[1:36:22] every time he asked what's my commission
[1:36:23] he dro the Bible and would open to
[1:36:25] Joshua the first chapter wow he said one
[1:36:27] day I was in my study and a vision he
[1:36:30] said appears and he said there was a
[1:36:32] Bible come down out of the
[1:36:34] sea would that be something a Bible
[1:36:37] starts down out of the ceiling and he s
[1:36:39] a hand with a collar of cuff on it went
[1:36:41] down the first nine verses of the Book
[1:36:43] of
[1:36:44] Joshua what was it it was commissioning
[1:36:47] William Brown to do what Joshua did
[1:36:51] right in the Old
[1:36:52] Testament he was being commissioned by
[1:36:55] God he wasn't commissioned by the
[1:36:57] Baptist they threw him out he wasn't
[1:37:00] commissioned by the assemblies they
[1:37:01] threw him out but God himself
[1:37:04] commissioned the prophet because they
[1:37:06] were children that came
[1:37:10] into and somebody
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:18] had you are in the word back to the word
[1:37:23] the word is your
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:28] identity was it the prophet was being
[1:37:30] told to the Lord in the Paradox cross
[1:37:33] this Jordan y'all remember the story he
[1:37:35] appeared and I'll go through some of
[1:37:36] these things later but I want to just
[1:37:38] catch this and going the prophet said he
[1:37:40] had a dream he stand on the map of
[1:37:42] Palestine he said it's broken three
[1:37:44] pieces the River Jordan was there he
[1:37:46] said I had come two3 of the journey yeah
[1:37:49] but he said over the Jordan was the last
[1:37:51] part of the journey and he said they
[1:37:53] told me that's where all the promises
[1:37:55] are I don't know if y'all realize this
[1:37:57] but first P second there was a Jordan
[1:38:02] and then there was a promise somebody
[1:38:04] got mad at me for this one time but I'll
[1:38:06] just go ahead and tell you teaching for

[1:38:23] there's a little Gap there somebody had
[1:38:25] to take us over that Gap into that
[1:38:28] headship that headship amen was where we
[1:38:32] came from our identity is in the
[1:38:35] headship of God took a prophet to bring
[1:38:38] a head back to the Earth we are not a l
[1:38:42] SE group of people we are the original
[1:38:50] seed this is Le but we are not Le we are
[1:38:56] the First Church of the
[1:38:59] Living our name Jesus
[1:39:02] Christ some people that get so mad at me
[1:39:05] over these things I'm sorry it's still
[1:39:07] true said well there's not more than
[1:39:09] Seven Cities but there is actually yes
[1:39:12] sir there's an epes right there City
[1:39:15] ephus and there's an Ephesus age there's
[1:39:18] a city of samna and there's a samna ag
[1:39:21] and there's a city of Leia and there's
[1:39:24] Le you know why they call it Leia don't
[1:39:27] you because it reflects the spirit of
[1:39:29] that City amen but there's another city
[1:39:32] that's not on this Earth there a New
[1:39:35] Jerusalem
[1:39:37] that and the word we the Jesus Christ
[1:39:44] it's another city it's the New
[1:39:48] Jerusalem out that City
[1:39:51] the L is
[1:39:54] the the
[1:39:58] streets and don't B son come on church
[1:40:02] it's not keeping the days and news it's
[1:40:04] not keeping up character and laws and
[1:40:07] denominations it's the bride and the
[1:40:14] Bri GL be to
[1:40:17] God every promise is in that promise
[1:40:22] who's going to go over there brother say
[1:40:25] the Caleb and Joshua outfit yeah the
[1:40:29] rest of them man had their opportunity
[1:40:32] yes but they came to a c and what they
[1:40:35] did was they looked over in that land
[1:40:37] and they said there's too many Giants
[1:40:38] over there they have they have the
[1:40:41] reality to say that it is a land with
[1:40:44] milk honey right but there's wall cities
[1:40:48] yes sir and giant yes sir so they
[1:40:51] decided to look at the
[1:40:53] opposition rather than the promise sir
[1:40:56] Caleb and Joshua could care less what
[1:40:58] was over them they were looking at a
[1:41:01] promise look at Giants I can't see no
[1:41:03] Giants they said look at the walls I
[1:41:06] can't see no walls cuz all they had eyes
[1:41:09] for is the promise there
[1:41:13] is and Abraham seeks to possess the P of
[1:41:16] the eny because they believe the word of
[1:41:20] God don't make no difference what the
[1:41:22] enemy has said according about your life
[1:41:25] what does the word say about your life
[1:41:27] it don't make this is going to happen
[1:41:29] and this going to happen that's going to
[1:41:31] happen I don't hear Satan I don't
[1:41:33] believe Satan he's alive to
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:37] start it was that josua out yes sir said
[1:41:42] the rest of stopped in the land and they
[1:41:45] couldn't go over it and the difference
[1:41:48] was one looked at the word one looked at
[1:41:50] the other
[1:41:51] position you see these men were looking
[1:41:55] at the promise because the promise spoke
[1:41:57] of
[1:41:59] them their identity was in the promise
[1:42:03] of Abraham is is that beautiful I don't
[1:42:07] oh I don't have time the promise was in
[1:42:10] there now where where was their names
[1:42:12] where was the where was the tribe where
[1:42:15] was the name that they were living under
[1:42:16] come from anyhow it came from God in
[1:42:19] inspiration Genesis 30 hundreds of years
[1:42:23] before these men were on the earth these
[1:42:26] tribes were actually the sons of Abraham
[1:42:30] Abraham had a son right Isaac and then
[1:42:33] out of Isaac comes Jacob and they change
[1:42:36] Jacob's name
[1:42:38] to and Israel has how many
[1:42:41] sons so Israel the nation is named after
[1:42:45] Jacob Israel and the tribes of know
[1:42:49] after the tribes of Sons of Jacob so it
[1:42:54] would be like uh somebody having F
[1:42:57] kids and every state in the United
[1:43:00] States was named one of those kids and
[1:43:03] they said where do you live said well my
[1:43:04] name's arkans right my name's theer my
[1:43:07] name's Ohio so they lived in the place
[1:43:11] that they were named for yeah and those
[1:43:14] names wasn't something somebody just
[1:43:15] come up with but even in their birth
[1:43:18] pains the mothers cried out those names
[1:43:22] under
[1:43:23] inspiration in bir their names were
[1:43:26] screamed over their forefathers these
[1:43:28] kids ain't even been born yet 400 years
[1:43:32] in Egypt and they still carry those
[1:43:35] names and every time they speak one of
[1:43:37] those names it is a name speaking of
[1:43:40] something that's going to happen in the
[1:43:41] future but now the name has come
[1:43:44] together the land and the people are
[1:43:46] coming together the prophecy and the
[1:43:49] people are coming together the is BEC
[1:43:52] posi the word is word the is not just a
[1:43:57] denomination she

[1:47:18] to start settling in the what God done
[1:47:21] for you yes sir good

[1:47:47] trouble yeah brother R said I'm going to
[1:47:50] give a lot of of of of word here to
[1:47:53] encourage and position and place his
[1:47:54] people I feel led by the Holy Spirit to
[1:47:56] do it to let the people I say how many
[1:47:58] Christians are here tonight you raise
[1:48:00] your hand Christians no matter what
[1:48:01] church you belong to now about 99% and
[1:48:04] that was true here about 99% of you are
[1:48:07] Christians maybe there be eight or 10
[1:48:09] people here maybe tonight that's not
[1:48:10] Christians I don't even think that's
[1:48:11] true here well now what must you do to
[1:48:15] that
[1:48:17] people but if you're Christians I mean
[1:48:19] and I been preaching Evangelical message
[1:48:21] that you need to get
[1:48:23] saved we've about called this conference
[1:48:25] in vain on
[1:48:27] now because we're trying to redo the
[1:48:30] first work
[1:48:31] again I can't say everybody's exactly
[1:48:34] what they need to be I got that but in
[1:48:37] this position of the church that we're
[1:48:40] in we have got to teach this message to
[1:48:43] our
[1:48:46] people this is when the church goes to
[1:48:48] their position yes sir
[1:48:51] now watch here we see this now watch
[1:48:53] brother man says it like this he said
[1:48:55] then there's he says what must the
[1:48:57] people do right you must positionally
[1:49:00] let them know what they are who they are
[1:49:03] and how to handle that
[1:49:07] evil and there's thousands of Chicago
[1:49:10] tonight Christians see then you're going
[1:49:12] to go out and be
[1:49:14] Warriors because you know you know where
[1:49:17] you're standing and you're going to meet
[1:49:19] the evil one now you can't meet that
[1:49:21] evil one until you're solid of who you
[1:49:23] are you better know where you're
[1:49:26] standing with
[1:49:28] that you see what it is you got to have
[1:49:30] a positive faith and brother said I
[1:49:32] believe it's right now that we are to
[1:49:34] break a complete understanding
[1:49:35] positionally of what we are in Christ
[1:49:38] you know brother said preaching will
[1:49:39] save the Lost he said but teaching
[1:49:41] positionally places them and we can
[1:49:43] never have the right Faith until
[1:49:45] positionally we know what we
[1:49:48] are the right kind of faith everything
[1:49:51] that we have is controlled by a law of
[1:49:54] Faith all the power you have depends
[1:49:58] upon the faith you
[1:49:59] have if you're still trying to figure
[1:50:02] out if you're going to be forgiven for
[1:50:04] what you done last year your faith is
[1:50:07] nothing it's a r on faith come on you
[1:50:11] can go so far but when you really come
[1:50:13] in front of that evil one he'll back you
[1:50:15] down every time but when you really
[1:50:18] getting settled in your heart that it's
[1:50:20] a finished work that day in Calvary and
[1:50:23] the blood of Jesus covers my sins you
[1:50:26] get that set down and you get there and
[1:50:28] you get to Rel your faith that faith
[1:50:31] that should come in your heart is a
[1:50:33] faith of the finish work I don't have
[1:50:35] any faith myself I don't have any faith
[1:50:38] in you but I got all the faith in the
[1:50:40] world that God P your price and made
[1:50:43] away
[1:50:49] you
[1:50:51] now that's the power of the church now
[1:50:53] is controlled by a law how much Faith
[1:50:56] you have how much power you can have
[1:50:58] will matter how much Faith you can have
[1:51:01] you see what it is amen if you begin to
[1:51:03] believe you can come to Mountain Moving
[1:51:05] Faith you can come to checkbook
[1:51:07] Authority Faith you can come to the kind
[1:51:10] of faith that the devil don't know what
[1:51:13] to do with
[1:51:15] you because it becomes faith brother
[1:51:18] says there's got to be an effort
[1:51:21] there's got to be not not the Ephesians
[1:51:24] there's got to be a moving into there's
[1:51:25] got to be an Ephesus see now to really
[1:51:28] have genuine Faith you absolutely have
[1:51:31] to leave everything that's contrary to
[1:51:33] the word behind you to enter into Faith
[1:51:37] words anything that says you can't do it
[1:51:39] you're going to have to leave
[1:51:40] it anything that says you can't be that
[1:51:44] Pride you're going to have to cross the
[1:51:45] Jordan and you're going to have to say
[1:51:47] you got to stay on that side as I going
[1:51:50] over here anything that says that you
[1:51:52] can't have the spoken word Authority you
[1:51:55] need to cross your Jordan and say Satan
[1:51:57] I to leave another lie that you going to
[1:51:59] speak about me at some time you have to
[1:52:03] come to the place you will only believe
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:09] work remember if you can get the people
[1:52:13] to not even cancer will stand in the way
[1:52:19] what is it we got to another Ephesians
[1:52:20] whether telling us intellectual
[1:52:22] demonstrations all educational programs
[1:52:25] has got to come to its Jordan we've got
[1:52:27] to have an Ephesians we've got to come
[1:52:29] out and we got to go into for this
[1:52:32] Exodus of the rapure what is it there's
[1:52:35] got to be an Ephesians to this do you
[1:52:37] realize brother places the Ephesians of
[1:52:39] the church in laa he says it very
[1:52:42] clearly we promis a lay to see a church
[1:52:44] that that's when the Ephesians would
[1:52:46] come the seven Church age now I don't
[1:52:49] have time to teach on all that but let's
[1:52:50] just get it clear okay real quick the
[1:52:52] seven Church age hasn't ended because
[1:52:55] it's Gentile dispensation but the bride
[1:52:57] has been lifted out of
[1:53:00] it by the
[1:53:02] word right when that ends it goes into
[1:53:05] tribulation and and Jews right so what
[1:53:08] we're looking at is that the hour has
[1:53:10] come the messenger of the age amen has
[1:53:14] brought when the seals open that's the
[1:53:17] time to go into because until it's open
[1:53:19] how you go into let me put it let me put
[1:53:22] it let me put it in my tongs how you
[1:53:24] going to eat a can of green beans till
[1:53:26] you open
[1:53:28] it how you going to believe the seals
[1:53:31] till they're
[1:53:32] open how are you going to find a d until
[1:53:36] God sends a prophet to tell you where
[1:53:37] you
[1:53:39] go that's right yall know you you know
[1:53:42] you s wait on your wife to come to the
[1:53:44] table tell you where we
[1:53:46] set cuz when the guys sit down they just
[1:53:49] mess everything
[1:53:50] up some said well if you guys sitting
[1:53:53] there you girls are sitting there kids
[1:53:54] are sitting here kind of helps
[1:53:55] everything
[1:53:58] right somebody had to put it in
[1:54:00] order that's right amen now help your
[1:54:06] mothers you just walked out of your
[1:54:08] house as a three-year-old lose and it
[1:54:11] pull everything off the
[1:54:13] shelf and they pulled everything down
[1:54:15] and everything's out the floor pots and
[1:54:17] P and shells and everything else is out
[1:54:18] there and you walk out now hey here you
[1:54:20] go please walk back in and say aah put
[1:54:23] it all
[1:54:26] back go ahead we'll give you a couple
[1:54:29] hours come back two hours you probably
[1:54:31] have a bigger mess and she might have
[1:54:32] some stuff put back and I bet it's going
[1:54:33] to be in the wrong
[1:54:35] place yeah because she don't know where
[1:54:38] it goes right that's good but Mama come
[1:54:41] back in the house yes sir and everything
[1:54:43] gets right back in the yes sir because
[1:54:46] she was the one that put it there to
[1:54:48] start
[1:54:51] and when God comes into the age and
[1:54:54] begins to open the seals it all goes
[1:54:56] back into order what denominations
[1:54:59] couldn't put in place God puts in place
[1:55:02] because he was there in the original and
[1:55:07] know the Holy Spirit PES the church into
[1:55:11] their position to the word listen there
[1:55:14] comes an Ephesians we're a promised
[1:55:16] Ephesians it's an age of overcoming
[1:55:18] that's where we are it's an overcoming
[1:55:21] age now I'll say this to you tonight
[1:55:26] amen that how and and I love how brother
[1:55:29] says this he said then how is it that
[1:55:32] you can preach predestination like this
[1:55:35] right yeah and not having atment all
[1:55:39] right how can I say it's possible for
[1:55:42] you to be here without paying the fair
[1:55:45] to get you
[1:55:46] there and the prophet says it he said
[1:55:49] how can you preach predestination of God
[1:55:50] and for ordain and set in order unless
[1:55:52] there's a sin atonement
[1:55:56] somewhere there got to be a sin
[1:55:57] atonement somewh he
[1:56:00] says now this is right in our subject
[1:56:03] now which each day you make a mistake
[1:56:05] and each day you do
[1:56:06] wrong but if you're born again man or
[1:56:09] woman soon as you make that mistake God
[1:56:11] knows you're sorry you can stand in the
[1:56:13] presence of the rose of ever or anybody
[1:56:15] else and say I'm wrong God forgive me
[1:56:18] for this thing
[1:56:20] and there's the blood
[1:56:22] atonement watch now notice sins a sinner
[1:56:25] is a sinner he doesn't commit sins now
[1:56:27] if you read the book of Ephesians and
[1:56:28] you'll see there about the 6th and sth
[1:56:30] verse Paul says we're Redeemed by the
[1:56:33] blood and we have forgiveness of
[1:56:37] sins now brother separates it I'll tell
[1:56:39] you how he separates it he says how can
[1:56:41] a sinner sin he is
[1:56:44] sin all right it's like it's like if you
[1:56:46] were wearing a complete black shirt
[1:56:50] amen and put a black God on it you can't
[1:56:52] tell if the whole thing's black put on a
[1:56:54] white shirt and put a black God on and
[1:56:56] brother says an unconverted man is a
[1:56:59] sinner and his whole life is sin but
[1:57:02] when he's redeemed he said then he
[1:57:04] becomes a Christian so if some little
[1:57:06] something happens in his life he said
[1:57:09] see you're already redeemed of God but
[1:57:12] then there is a forgiveness of sins oh
[1:57:15] yeah he said the sinner don't sin he
[1:57:18] says the believer is the one that has
[1:57:23] sin now might as well get it out there
[1:57:25] because if you really believe that if a
[1:57:27] man ever gets the Holy Ghost he can't
[1:57:29] never have a sin again in his life then
[1:57:31] what you does is put the people in a
[1:57:33] position that they got to get saved
[1:57:34] every week every mon every year but the
[1:57:37] prophet never taugh that he taugh that a
[1:57:40] man was born again and sealed into the
[1:57:43] kingdom of God that was a finished work
[1:57:46] and if there was trouble coming to that
[1:57:48] life that there was the blood told me to
[1:57:51] bring that man back in life with
[1:57:57] God it take me two days to prove that
[1:57:59] but but leave me can't see but there's a
[1:58:01] Sinners of sin who just doesn't commit
[1:58:03] sin but the church commits sin does
[1:58:05] wrong gets wrong thought wrong
[1:58:06] impression makes SC troubles now watch
[1:58:09] what man said it's like a little child
[1:58:12] walking and he's trying to learn how to
[1:58:14] walk how many y'all trained the child to
[1:58:16] walk yet amen trying to learn to walk he
[1:58:20] just don't know how to walk good yet he
[1:58:23] said cuz he's a little boy but we have a
[1:58:26] hand that reaches down and steadies us
[1:58:29] and if he makes this step this way son
[1:58:32] he doesn't pick us up and spank us
[1:58:35] because we made a mistake he doesn't
[1:58:37] beat us to death because we're trying to
[1:58:41] walk God's not mad at you cuz you're
[1:58:44] trying to walk come on your desire is to
[1:58:48] serve God and the devil keeps telling
[1:58:51] you if you ever made a mistake you can't
[1:58:53] ever get back up that's a lie out of the
[1:58:56] pit of Hell Satan is trying to find the
[1:59:04] church let me get
[1:59:06] somewhere that's the trouble of the
[1:59:08] church today you're a scared of making a
[1:59:10] failure and how can you fall in Christ
[1:59:13] is in you you can't fall you got
[1:59:15] everlasting life and all the Demons of
[1:59:17] hell can't shake you you got everlasting
[1:59:20] life so don't you be scared of
[1:59:23] fell now now friends somebody said
[1:59:27] brother man said the man went to want to
[1:59:28] get a job and fell said Hey where's your
[1:59:31] eraser the guy said I don't have no
[1:59:32] Erasers on my pencils man said the boss
[1:59:35] said we can't hire you then he said why
[1:59:36] can't you he said because if you don't
[1:59:39] have an eraser you ain't doing nothing
[1:59:42] because a man that don't make mistakes
[1:59:43] ain't tried nothing and brother Mar says
[1:59:46] it he said see I rather have mistakes
[1:59:49] then rather than S do
[1:59:51] nothing well I tell you what yall didn't
[1:59:53] do that right you didn't do that right
[1:59:55] but we were doing
[1:59:56] something good yes sir but we were doing
[2:00:00] see when I think of Abraham and all the
[2:00:02] mistakes he made boy powerful when I
[2:00:04] think of Abraham and all the mistakes he
[2:00:06] made and when Abraham's commentary was
[2:00:08] written the Divine commentary was
[2:00:09] written Paul wrote Abraham's commentary
[2:00:12] and he never mentioned one thing about
[2:00:15] Abraham's
[2:00:17] unbelief he never mentioned one thing
[2:00:19] about Abraham's unbelief no never not
[2:00:21] was never accounted to him Abraham
[2:00:24] staggered not to the promise of God
[2:00:25] through unbelief and was strong and
[2:00:28] giving praise my humble prayers before
[2:00:30] the grace of God I hope mine wrote like
[2:00:35] that I hope he writes mine like that
[2:00:38] that when my commentary is written my
[2:00:40] obituary he said he never makes the
[2:00:42] mistakes that I done now I I don't I
[2:00:45] don't know if you've ever seen this but
[2:00:46] I think it's a powerful example amen of
[2:00:49] of the Old Testament and the New
[2:00:51] Testament how many realize is there just
[2:00:53] actually one page in
[2:00:55] between there just one page in between
[2:00:58] and if you read the book of Genesis and
[2:01:00] you see Abraham over there amen you'll
[2:01:03] see all the problems and mistakes that
[2:01:04] Abraham made amen but then watch on one
[2:01:07] side of that page Abraham and all his
[2:01:10] mistakes on the other side of that page
[2:01:12] there no
[2:01:14] mistakes and what what what was it that
[2:01:17] changes you there is a new testament
[2:01:21] there is the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:01:24] the Propet God say he was nothing left
[2:01:27] of Abraham's mistakes cres over the
[2:01:31] blood listen this blood has more power
[2:01:34] than you realize the blood of Jesus has
[2:01:38] more power than
[2:01:40] understand oh my goodness the prophet
[2:01:43] God said see if mine is written like
[2:01:44] that now now he goes into this private
[2:01:47] interview I'm closing pretty soon watch
[2:01:49] this now he goes into this private
[2:01:51] interview with sister Bru with sister
[2:01:53] Bruce and when he does he comes up to
[2:01:55] this place and brother BR speaking to
[2:01:57] this woman and she's a she's a Believer
[2:02:00] and she's having some unsettled feelings
[2:02:03] and she's feeling like maybe she's fa
[2:02:05] the Lord and brother was talking with
[2:02:07] her and he does he says now sister I
[2:02:10] miss to pray for you and I'm not worthy
[2:02:13] to do that what would I do if Jesus was
[2:02:15] sitting here now he said if he was
[2:02:17] sitting here he' lay his hands on you
[2:02:20] and with his great faith you get
[2:02:22] well well I think when I'm a sinner he
[2:02:26] says I'm not himal but I've come to
[2:02:29] represent him remember me being a sinner
[2:02:33] and before God I'm not a
[2:02:36] sin and neither are
[2:02:39] you we got a blood sacrifice laying
[2:02:43] there and God don't even see
[2:02:47] it he hears our voice but he sees the
[2:02:50] blood of Christ see he sees the blood of
[2:02:53] his own son it's our voice it's Christ
[2:02:57] blood then if Christ that talks through
[2:03:00] us to God therefore we're not Sinners no
[2:03:03] more we are
[2:03:09] Christians now brother just told you're
[2:03:12] sitting in the
[2:03:13] room and he just told you that oh now
[2:03:17] this is her this is what she said back
[2:03:20] to him which represents what many of say
[2:03:24] I made so many mistakes and I fail so
[2:03:27] many times yeah and he says that's why
[2:03:31] Christ
[2:03:32] died he said so that you with your
[2:03:35] mistakes wouldn't be lot to you he took
[2:03:38] your mistakes your desire in your heart
[2:03:41] is to serve him and she says that's the
[2:03:43] truth he said that's what he died for so
[2:03:46] you can serve you your mistakes are not
[2:03:48] looked at they're not led to you he is
[2:03:51] your propitiation he he is your sin
[2:03:54] offering your sins are not know you are
[2:03:56] not sinner before God Christ took your
[2:03:59] sins and became you because your desire
[2:04:02] is to serve
[2:04:05] him I said but look sister you don't
[2:04:08] look at yourself it's what you desire
[2:04:11] and what you try to do and if you really
[2:04:14] love the Lord you're going to try to
[2:04:15] serve him with all your heart then your
[2:04:17] mistakes are he in the blood of the Lord
[2:04:20] Jesus see he made a way for you and what
[2:04:23] am I talking about every person in here
[2:04:25] can live above sin because you can live
[2:04:28] without sin you make mistakes but the
[2:04:30] blood of Christ will forgive
[2:04:35] you get back back to the devil one time
[2:04:39] and see if you don't feel like serving
[2:04:41] God
[2:04:43] again in position a Believer he said
[2:04:45] life with Christ shut out the world and
[2:04:47] the Very nature God is in you still
[2:04:49] subject to mistakes but God can't see it
[2:04:52] now there's a reason I'm saying these
[2:04:54] things every time he looks through the
[2:04:56] blood it looks
[2:04:58] white in Joshua 1 and verse 5 in the
[2:05:01] Commandment of Joshua he said therefore
[2:05:03] shall not any man stand before thee all
[2:05:05] the days of thy life as I was with
[2:05:10] Moses so will I be with me brother R
[2:05:15] says it like this brother sister if you
[2:05:16] want to be sincere after all my mistakes
[2:05:19] is showing reason I brought these
[2:05:21] messages previously was that God shows
[2:05:23] us that he's merciful Moses made his
[2:05:28] mistakes a great man like him then when
[2:05:32] Joshua come up he was going to have to
[2:05:34] make his too but God said as I was with
[2:05:37] Moses so will I be God never left Moses
[2:05:42] and God never left iten Joshua and God
[2:05:46] will never leave this life
[2:05:53] I know I know I know what the world's
[2:05:55] coming to and I know the issues and I
[2:05:57] know struggles and problems and I've
[2:05:59] been preaching for a long time now
[2:06:00] there's been a lot of lot of situations
[2:06:02] that's come up through these years let
[2:06:04] me let me just say something to you the
[2:06:06] prophet in this adoption series is going
[2:06:07] to tell us something we're on a journey
[2:06:09] and we crossed this Jordan River and now
[2:06:11] we're in a battle you know the only
[2:06:14] thing that can keep you from Victory now
[2:06:15] is
[2:06:17] sin when they go up to the Bible of
[2:06:19] Jericho we'll get to it later when they
[2:06:21] go to the Bible of Jericho they have a
[2:06:23] master picture when they leave the Bible
[2:06:26] of Jericho they go to the Battle of a
[2:06:29] which is a lesser battle and they lose
[2:06:32] the battle and the Bible said if they
[2:06:34] lost their courage for the Bible for the
[2:06:36] B for the battle and their and their and
[2:06:38] their courage and their backbones melted
[2:06:41] like water and they fled from the city
[2:06:44] and the enemy raced and chased them out
[2:06:46] and I think they lost up to nearly men I
[2:06:49] believe in was and when they got there
[2:06:51] Joshua said wait a
[2:06:54] minute something is wrong something is
[2:06:58] wrong there's no way this Army could be
[2:07:01] losing like this with God on their side
[2:07:04] so he goes back and begins a prayer
[2:07:06] meeting and God said they're sin under
[2:07:09] they're sin among the church now watch
[2:07:11] this because brother R says it happens
[2:07:13] to local assemblies
[2:07:16] right he said when somebody in that
[2:07:18] church church starts going a certain
[2:07:19] direction and they get way off the path
[2:07:21] he said it'll it'll hinder the whole
[2:07:25] church now you said brother Wayne are
[2:07:27] you starting into legalism now no I want
[2:07:29] you to watch something as an as an elder
[2:07:32] if you're a if you're a
[2:07:34] sister however you're living is the
[2:07:36] influence of these young
[2:07:38] girls that's right listen some of these
[2:07:40] young girls I know they got off they go
[2:07:42] now to the theaters and things you know
[2:07:43] they no don't matter what R said they do
[2:07:45] what they want to and you're the one
[2:07:47] wrong if you say something that the
[2:07:50] funny part about it they ought to be
[2:07:52] ashamed but they want you to be ashamed
[2:07:54] because you say it's not to do it other
[2:07:56] day I was down I was with a pastor in a
[2:07:58] couple of his daughters and and we were
[2:08:00] up at a and they were giving away the
[2:08:03] tickets for a meal or something like
[2:08:04] that there's a couple of them and the
[2:08:06] lady walks up to me and she says to me
[2:08:07] would you like these theater tickets
[2:08:09] there was some kind of movie tickets you
[2:08:11] know and I said no I'll give it to these
[2:08:13] girls they probably W and they come
[2:08:15] around and both of them were astonished
[2:08:18] and they look they look back at me said
[2:08:21] I can't let us go the movie theater I
[2:08:24] said I'm glad to
[2:08:27] hear amen but I was glad to hear that
[2:08:30] from a heart I want you to watch
[2:08:33] something young people are going to do
[2:08:35] some things and they're going to try
[2:08:37] some areas but don't let our elders
[2:08:40] teach them to do
[2:08:45] it so what the kids are doing it anyhow
[2:08:48] well pray will be to God somebody teach
[2:08:50] them
[2:08:51] differ you don't join in with it power
[2:08:55] to it that preach said we should do it
[2:08:57] well M doing it too that should
[2:09:03] never now watch this we're talking about
[2:09:05] we're talking about Believers now that's
[2:09:08] right I'm talking about salvation now
[2:09:10] we're talking about your victories we're
[2:09:12] talking about your walks the the don't
[2:09:14] have have the power to put you in hell
[2:09:17] they take all the Victory you got out of
[2:09:19] your life and it'll take the power of
[2:09:21] Faith away from you and you'll sit
[2:09:23] around condemned in your unbelief and
[2:09:26] when God when God's willing to bless you
[2:09:28] and give you glories and pow the next
[2:09:31] thing you know now now watch this Joshua
[2:09:34] got the pray and found out there was an
[2:09:35] A and y'all remember what the a was he
[2:09:38] he buried a wedge of gold and silver the
[2:09:40] T beneath his T speaking speaking of
[2:09:43] taking a curs thing now watch as a group
[2:09:45] of people T don't you just make that
[2:09:49] about no
[2:09:51] church now let's pull that down to our
[2:09:54] personal
[2:09:55] lives and let's remember when we were on
[2:09:58] top of the mountain and we were shouting
[2:10:00] the greatest victories and we were
[2:10:02] getting victory over this Spirit victory
[2:10:04] over this Spirit victory over this
[2:10:06] spirit and all of a sudden we getting so
[2:10:08] much Victory
[2:10:10] anymore and that sister said this I'm
[2:10:14] you Ain no
[2:10:15] fun and this this person said this
[2:10:18] you're offended you know he didn't sing
[2:10:21] my song you're offended you know where
[2:10:23] all that's
[2:10:25] happen do you know where all the
[2:10:27] criticisms coming from somebody said
[2:10:29] this is wrong that's just kicking
[2:10:31] they're mad about everything all you
[2:10:33] know where that's coming from it's
[2:10:34] coming from something in that
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:39] tent watch now the Holy Ghost started
[2:10:42] digging in the camp till it
[2:10:44] found it found the spot and what did
[2:10:47] they do they took aan and his entire
[2:10:50] family and they burned him to ashes with
[2:10:54] his curse with his his it's Joshua it's
[2:10:57] the Bible Book of Joshua and they took
[2:10:59] all this and they took it down to this
[2:11:02] Valley and they spread it out in this
[2:11:03] Valley and they covered it up with rocks
[2:11:07] and you know what they did they went
[2:11:09] back after that was dealt with and they
[2:11:12] went back up to that same battle they
[2:11:14] had got ripped in and they were
[2:11:16] Victorious now that lesson in in there
[2:11:19] has been used a lot of times in a very
[2:11:21] negative way don't you allow it to be
[2:11:24] negative learn a lesson that if you're
[2:11:27] losing a battle it's not God's fault go
[2:11:31] back and look at your life and say what
[2:11:33] is hindering my life from the victories
[2:11:36] that God has given me and God gave you
[2:11:39] the victory after the problem there a
[2:11:42] victory W for every believer that is
[2:11:45] made to confess their sins I the blood
[2:11:49] of Jesus
[2:11:50] [Applause]
[2:11:52] Christ brother brother Jo you sang that
[2:11:55] song uh complete with your mother the
[2:11:58] words of Hosea yall know that's that's
[2:12:01] that's the story of redemption right how
[2:12:04] many knows this story you remember and
[2:12:06] and the problem with it was was Hosea
[2:12:08] was a prophet and he was he was looking
[2:12:10] at the Lord and he was and he was saying
[2:12:13] how do you still love these people and
[2:12:16] they've done this and they've done that
[2:12:18] they went into whoredom and they served
[2:12:19] other gods and how is if you just keep
[2:12:22] he said I tell you what we'll do you
[2:12:24] don't marry yourself a heart and have
[2:12:27] kids by her and then you're going to
[2:12:30] understand
[2:12:31] me then you're going to understand why I
[2:12:33] just can't throw Israel away because
[2:12:36] she's my wife and she has children and
[2:12:39] remember the story and then if you're
[2:12:42] reading the book of Hosea she goes back
[2:12:44] into her HS after she get married after
[2:12:47] she she has children she goes back into
[2:12:50] this place and when she gets out there
[2:12:51] if you read Hosea the second chapter God
[2:12:55] through Hosea just starts speaking
[2:12:57] judgment upon to judgment upon to of
[2:13:00] judgment then you get to the 14th verse
[2:13:03] of Hosea chapter 2 and he says but
[2:13:08] therefore
[2:13:10] oh and there's a break right in the
[2:13:12] middle of this Jud oh yeah that's right
[2:13:14] but therefore I will l
[2:13:19] Into the Wilderness now watch's the
[2:13:21] attraction the Bri I will Allure thee
[2:13:24] I'll draw you
[2:13:26] out and he said and I'll give you the
[2:13:30] valley of acor yeah for a door of wh
[2:13:33] right oh my and here's a woman that's
[2:13:35] sold herself in the whorm and has a
[2:13:37] husband and children and she's a long
[2:13:40] way in the whorm and here's a prophet
[2:13:42] saying to her I know the trouble you're
[2:13:45] in but I will give you the valley of a
[2:13:48] for Hope and what's that y probably like
[2:13:50] I was first time I read that what in the
[2:13:52] world's a valley L and how would that be
[2:13:55] A Door of
[2:13:56] Hope it's because that was the same
[2:14:00] Valley that
[2:14:03] they that was the place where aen had
[2:14:06] been
[2:14:07] put and he was telling Homer he was
[2:14:09] telling hosea's wife that if God could
[2:14:13] reverse the defeat of the whole Camp of
[2:14:16] Israel and he gave them a place to hide
[2:14:19] their sins he gave them appointed place
[2:14:22] that they can put it and they can lead
[2:14:24] Victorious then God as a place for you
[2:14:27] that you can place your sins and you can
[2:14:30] walk the away and un keep the church
[2:14:34] Len if God has anointed you and
[2:14:36] appointed you to be the B of Jesus

[2:16:10] be able to see them again can you
[2:16:13] imagine that God has a place for you
