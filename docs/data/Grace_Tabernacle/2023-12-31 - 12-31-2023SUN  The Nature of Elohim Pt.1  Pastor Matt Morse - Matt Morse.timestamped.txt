[45:06] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[45:09] now we'll read from Deuteronomy the 6th
[45:12] chapter in the fourth
[45:16] verse this is Moses writing he said here
[45:19] oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[45:23] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[45:25] with all all thine heart and with all
[45:27] thy soul and with all thy might and
[45:29] these words which I command thee this
[45:31] day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt
[45:34] teach them diligently unto thy children
[45:37] and shall talk of them when thou sest in
[45:39] thine house and when you walk by the way
[45:41] and when you lie down and when you rise
[45:43] up you shall bind them for a sign upon
[45:46] thy hand and th shall be the frontlets
[45:48] between your eyes and thou shalt ride up
[45:50] on the post of thy house and on thy
[45:52] Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy
[45:55] God shall have brought you into the land
[45:57] which he swear unto the fathers of
[45:58] Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give thee
[46:01] great and goodly cities which thou
[46:03] buildest not isn't it something how God
[46:05] would give he said he would give you
[46:07] great cities which you built not Houses
[46:09] full of all good things which you filled
[46:11] not whales that were dug which you did
[46:14] dug not Vineyards and olive trees which
[46:17] thou plest not but when thou shallal
[46:20] have eaten and be full then beware lest
[46:23] thou forget the Lord which brought thee
[46:26] forth out of the land of Egypt from the
[46:28] house of bondage but thou shal fear the
[46:31] lord thy God and serve him and you shall
[46:34] swear by his name and we'll just ask the
[46:36] Lord to add His blessings uh to the
[46:38] reading of the word this morning and I
[46:40] want to speak on this subject on the
[46:42] nature of
[46:44] Elohim here uh we read this scripture to
[46:48] speak or to swear by his name I I
[46:50] believe that we ought to pray we heard
[46:52] this uh brother spoke this Wednesday
[46:55] night to pray for Revelation more than
[46:57] anything else how many believers do we
[46:58] have here this morning how many believe
[47:00] that that that that uh statement we
[47:02] ought to pray for Revelation more than
[47:04] anything else you say brother Matt why
[47:06] is that our brother was speaking
[47:07] Wednesday night he asked this question
[47:09] which I thought was a was a wonderful
[47:11] question he said which would you rather
[47:12] have would you rather have education or
[47:14] Revelation I pondered on that a little
[47:16] while I thought it was a I thought it
[47:17] was a good question to bring to the
[47:19] hearts of people he said would you
[47:20] rather have education or revelation of
[47:22] course he didn't know that last Sunday
[47:25] it went right along with what we were
[47:26] speaking on on the trees that God had
[47:28] placed in the Garden of Eden one being
[47:30] the tree of of life and other being the
[47:32] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[47:35] and so we see how that God has always
[47:37] put this question or put this uh uh uh
[47:40] the the this choice in in amongst
[47:43] humanity is to be able to gain knowledge
[47:45] or to gain Faith or to gain life or or
[47:48] or to eat of this tree of knowledge and
[47:49] so uh but but when we see this we spoke
[47:52] on that last week I I get to thinking
[47:54] about this knowledge and some sometimes
[47:56] people take this and they they go a
[47:57] little over the other side with it and
[47:59] and they get a little bit too far off
[48:00] and and and then and in some backwards
[48:03] thinking that God's people don't need to
[48:05] know anything and that's not true it Ain
[48:07] it ain't that God don't want you to have
[48:09] knowledge it's just the right kind of
[48:10] knowledge it didn't that God wants you
[48:12] to not know anything I know uh that that
[48:14] there are men in this world today that
[48:16] they want people to be ignorant of the
[48:18] word of God you say well why would
[48:19] people want you to be ignorant it ain't
[48:20] really the man but it's the it's the
[48:22] spirit that the man's anointed by but he
[48:24] wants you to be ignorant why would the
[48:26] spirit want you to be ignorant of the
[48:27] word because if you're ignorant of God's
[48:29] word then that man can have control over
[48:32] you or that Spirit could have control
[48:34] over you so so if they know more than
[48:36] you well then you're always beneath them
[48:37] and they're always higher than you and
[48:39] you always had to go for the answer you
[48:41] realize that's the same spirit that
[48:42] Martin Luther had combed in the Catholic
[48:44] church because the church had set
[48:47] themselves up over the people of God and
[48:49] the people were ignorant of the word of
[48:50] God they wouldn't even allow them to
[48:52] have a Bible that they could read in
[48:53] their own language because they didn't
[48:55] want them to have the word because the
[48:56] word of God would bring Liberty to the
[48:59] people of God so you see how that the
[49:01] devil would come and and to bring
[49:02] bondage if he's going to keep the people
[49:04] of God bound then the best way to keep
[49:06] them bound is to keep the knowledge of
[49:08] the Lord out of the hearts of people
[49:10] where they don't know who they are and
[49:11] they don't know where they going but
[49:13] friends let me tell you something about
[49:14] Revelation Revelation doesn't make you
[49:16] ignorant Revelation actually brings
[49:18] knowledge it I know many people
[49:21] misunderstand knowledge that it's wrong
[49:23] or it's no good because they say well
[49:25] educ brings knowledge and that is true
[49:27] it certainly brings knowledge but the
[49:29] reality is is that Revelation also
[49:31] brings knowledge see but it's a
[49:33] different kind of knowledge see whenever
[49:34] you read the book of Daniel the Bible
[49:36] says in the end time knowledge shall
[49:38] increase but as knowledge increases
[49:40] people move further away from God so it
[49:42] doesn't matter how much knowledge they
[49:44] gain they're farther away from God today
[49:46] than they were in the days of Daniel or
[49:48] in the days of Paul or in the days of
[49:49] Peter people continued to get further
[49:51] away from God even though they advance
[49:53] in knowledge even the Bible would say it
[49:56] like this the Bible says they are ever
[49:58] knowing but never come to the knowledge
[50:00] of the truth do you realize that they're
[50:02] ever knowing they ever have knowledge
[50:04] but yet they're not coming to the
[50:05] knowledge of the truth so there's one
[50:07] knowledge that didn't do them no good
[50:09] but there's another knowledge that God
[50:10] is calling us to as the Bride of Jesus
[50:13] Christ this is the this is the knowledge
[50:15] that Peter I may as well just speak to
[50:17] you what's on my heart this morning but
[50:18] this is the knowledge that Peter had
[50:20] spoke of he said he said he said
[50:22] whenever you have the stature of a
[50:23] perfect man it wasn't a knowledge that
[50:25] come from the world brother Wesley but
[50:27] it's a knowledge that came from God it
[50:29] wasn't a knowledge that came from
[50:30] education but it's a knowledge that came
[50:32] by the revelation of the word of God
[50:34] it's a Godly knowledge the knowledge to
[50:36] know the things of God the knowledge to
[50:38] know who you are and where you come from
[50:41] and what was our existence brother Mark
[50:43] and what and and where we're going to
[50:45] and this is this is a Godly knowledge
[50:47] how to handle ourselves as the Bride of
[50:49] Jesus Christ in the world that we live
[50:51] in today in the in the craziness of
[50:53] 2024 that we're that we're approaching
[50:56] brother M but to have the knowledge of
[50:58] God to be able to be able to go forward
[51:00] in this life you say brother Matt what
[51:02] kind of knowledge is this anyway here's
[51:04] what Peter said he said besides this
[51:06] remember he's talking about building a
[51:08] man or building a Christian or a
[51:09] Believer he said besides this give all
[51:12] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[51:14] to your virtue what knowledge and
[51:17] knowledge Temperance and patience and
[51:19] godliness and brotherly kindness and
[51:21] charity he said for if these things be
[51:24] in you and the bound they will make it
[51:26] that you will neither be Barren or
[51:28] unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord
[51:30] Jesus Christ so Peter tells us if you'll
[51:32] have these things in you then you'll be
[51:34] able to stand in the last day if you'll
[51:36] have these things in you then you'll be
[51:38] able to bear fruit if you'll have these
[51:40] things in you then you won't be a Barren
[51:42] Church but you'll be a church that's
[51:44] able to produce the very life of the one
[51:46] Jesus Christ but Peter said but he that
[51:48] lath these things is a blind man he that
[51:51] lath these things he cannot see a far
[51:53] off and he has forgotten that he was
[51:55] purged by his own sins he said wherefore
[51:58] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[52:00] your calling and your election sure for
[52:03] if you do these things you shall never
[52:07] fall if you'll have the knowledge of God
[52:10] and brotherly kindness and virtue and
[52:12] and these things and patience and
[52:14] godliness the very the very things that
[52:16] God has given to us Peter said if you'll
[52:18] have these things you shall never fall I
[52:21] love reading this because you see in one
[52:23] place the Bible said well we didn't need
[52:25] that knowledge in the next place Peter
[52:26] said you must have knowledge I think
[52:28] this is so wonderful because when Peter
[52:30] uses this if you read this in the Greek
[52:32] it's actually a different word knowledge
[52:34] it ain't it ain't y like like to have
[52:36] the knowledge that the world has but the
[52:38] Greek word is josco let me tell you what
[52:40] this means Peter said you must have
[52:42] knowledge the knowledge the word josco
[52:44] brother Wesley it means to properly to
[52:47] know something especially through a
[52:49] personal experience in other words it's
[52:51] the knowledge by a firsthand
[52:54] acquaintance this is what the word josco
[52:56] means in other words it means to
[52:58] experientially know something so it
[53:00] didn't just knowledge or head knowledge
[53:02] like the world would put in you or
[53:04] something that you would try to to gain
[53:06] by education but this knowledge Peter
[53:08] speaks of he said it's an experiential
[53:10] knowledge it's something that isn't
[53:11] gained by reading a book it's something
[53:14] that isn't gained by by by trying to
[53:16] further yourself in education but the
[53:17] only way to gain it is to have a
[53:19] firsthand experience it's an
[53:21] acquaintance with something I thought it
[53:22] was so wonderful that this is the same
[53:24] word that that that Mary uses when the
[53:27] angel comes to her and he says unto her
[53:29] you will bring forth a son and you shall
[53:31] call his name Jesus and the Bible said
[53:33] Mary turned to the angel she said how
[53:35] can this thing be for I have not known
[53:38] josco I have not known a man friends let
[53:41] me tell you this morning Mary knew what
[53:44] a man was she had knowledge of a man she
[53:46] had knowledge of what men were she had a
[53:49] knowledge of men all around her but
[53:50] there was something that she didn't know
[53:52] she didn't know one by experience she
[53:54] said I had haven't known josco I haven't
[53:57] known a man he just says so how can this
[53:59] can't be this is the kind of knowledge
[54:01] that Peter said that we had to have it
[54:03] has to be a personal experience with the
[54:05] one Jesus Christ to have the knowledge
[54:07] of God or the experience of God it's an
[54:10] experiential knowledge that's what Jesus
[54:11] said he said when they come to me in the
[54:13] last day they'll say Lord Lord have we
[54:15] not prophesied in thy name have I not
[54:18] cast out devils in thy name have we not
[54:20] have we not done many wonderful Works in
[54:22] thy name and he said I'll say unto you
[54:24] depart from me you worker of in iniquity
[54:27] I never knew you josco I never knew you
[54:31] I didn't have that knowledge of you we
[54:32] didn't have a personal acquaintance we
[54:35] it wasn't an experiential knowledge but
[54:37] brother Mark the Bible tells us we ought
[54:39] to have a knowledge a knowledge of God a
[54:42] knowledge that come by experience
[54:44] brother B would say it like this he said
[54:46] that's the problem that was the
[54:47] difference between Satan and Jesus
[54:49] Remember When say well you may as well
[54:50] preach with me just a minute it's it's
[54:51] the last service of of 2023 make it the
[54:54] best
[54:55] but whenever they came there remember
[54:57] when Satan took him up on a mountain and
[54:58] he tempted him by the word of God he
[55:00] said the difference they both knew the
[55:02] word but they knew the word differently
[55:03] Satan knew the word by knowledge he said
[55:06] but Jesus knowed it by experience he
[55:08] said he knew it by Revelation he knew he
[55:10] was the son of God he knew he' come into
[55:12] the world for a reason he knew where he
[55:14] was standing brother Mark he knew he was
[55:16] born into the world for that purpose and
[55:18] that's the reason the word of God could
[55:19] work through him because he knew what he
[55:22] was that's the only way to be able to
[55:24] defeat the devil is to know who you are
[55:27] it's to know where you come from it's to
[55:28] know where you stand it's to know that
[55:30] that God has called you for a purpose
[55:32] that's the only way you'll ever defeat
[55:33] the Devil brother Mark is to have an
[55:35] experience a real experiential knowledge
[55:38] with the Lord Jesus Christ it ain't
[55:39] coming and sitting in some church
[55:41] somewhere and feeling yourself full of a
[55:43] bunch of head knowledge and going out
[55:44] and trying to quote it it's having an
[55:46] experience where the baptism of the Holy
[55:48] Ghost to the very word that you're
[55:50] reading is living on the inside of you
[55:53] and you're manifesting the life of God
[55:55] and the believer say Amen it's a
[55:58] knowledge by experience so that's the
[56:00] reason the word could work through him
[56:02] because he knew who he was friends I got
[56:04] news for you this morning Satan wants
[56:06] you to be ignorant you say why does why
[56:08] does Satan want me to be ignorant
[56:09] because if he has you ignorant he can
[56:11] rule over you but how many knows this
[56:13] when Apostle Paul would preach Paul said
[56:15] there's four things that the church
[56:16] should specifically he said there's four
[56:19] things that you should not be ignorant
[56:20] of how many knows that he told the
[56:22] Corinthian Church he said do not be
[56:24] ignorant of Satan's devices so here's
[56:27] four things that Paul's going to lay out
[56:29] in the Bible that you need to make sure
[56:31] you're not ignorant of in other words
[56:32] you need to have a knowledge of these
[56:34] things he said the first one is don't be
[56:37] ignorant of Satan's devices you say
[56:39] brother man what's that mean don't be
[56:40] ignorant of the plans and the deceiving
[56:43] the the the the the the tricks that
[56:45] Satan has know the snares that he would
[56:47] lay before you don't be ignorant uh in
[56:50] in in the in the year coming forward
[56:51] maybe in 2023 maybe you fell into some
[56:54] traps and maybe Satan trapped you and
[56:56] maybe he got you caught up in the middle
[56:58] of the night somewhere doing uh things
[57:00] you shouldn't do or or thinking things
[57:02] that you shouldn't think and he and he
[57:03] laid a little trap and you walked right
[57:05] in the Trap and he got a hold of you but
[57:06] Paul says don't be ignorant of his
[57:08] device you say brother man how can I
[57:10] overcome that well now you've had an
[57:11] experience with it now you you've
[57:13] experienced something you you've gained
[57:15] a little bit of knowledge about the
[57:16] tricks of the devil and Paul says don't
[57:18] be ignorant of his plan I say this as a
[57:20] pastor this morning don't be ignorant of
[57:22] Satan's device don't be ignorant of what
[57:24] he's trying to do to the Church of the
[57:26] Living God don't be ignorant of the
[57:28] spirit of the devil that would come and
[57:29] sit right down amongst Believers and try
[57:31] to take the spirit of God out of the out
[57:34] of the Church of the Living God to keep
[57:35] God from being able to move and speak to
[57:37] his children and change hearts and lives
[57:40] don't be ignorant of the trick of the
[57:41] devil that would try to keep your hands
[57:43] down when God desires praise don't be
[57:45] ignorant of the device of the devil that
[57:47] would keep you from singing praises unto
[57:49] the Lord the very thing that would bring
[57:51] a blessing upon your life don't be
[57:52] ignorant of his devices don't be
[57:55] ignorant of his device when he said well
[57:57] don't say amen and don't get into the
[57:59] service and and my you ain't going to
[58:00] get nothing out of it anyhow there ain't
[58:02] nothing different than the other don't
[58:03] be different than Satan's device say
[58:05] today is a different day it don't matter
[58:07] what happened yesterday but today is a
[58:09] new day I believe the word of God I'll
[58:12] stand on it I'll get behind God's word
[58:14] and I'll let the spirit of the Lord move
[58:16] amongst us again don't be ignorant of
[58:19] Satan's
[58:19] devices he's always trying to defeat the
[58:22] believer you say brother Mar what what
[58:24] what do we do he said well God gave us a
[58:26] way to defeat him it was the word of God
[58:29] the revelation of God's word is the only
[58:31] way you'll ever defeat the Devil you
[58:34] think about it but manam said God he
[58:35] could have give his people anything to
[58:37] defeat the Devil with he would have done
[58:39] it he said and so when God he said I
[58:41] always say this when God makes a
[58:42] decision that's the best that there is
[58:44] he never has to alter his decision said
[58:47] the first decision God Made In the
[58:48] Garden of Eden was to combat the enemy
[58:51] with his word they were fortified behind
[58:53] the word but notice Satan because he
[58:55] knows your nature brother Mark so here
[58:57] comes Satan along in the garden when
[58:59] they were fortified behind the word of
[59:01] God they had established the word of God
[59:02] as the only thing that would defend them
[59:04] from the from the uh the the the Ws of
[59:07] the devil and so he said they would know
[59:09] their nature so he studied Eve until
[59:11] finally he found the best strategy he
[59:13] could use on her was that she would
[59:15] reason with the word of God that's why
[59:17] that's what caused the fall in the
[59:18] garden is because she reasoned with the
[59:21] word of God well maybe that's right but
[59:23] you know what I I don't if I can live
[59:25] just like that well I'm sure that was
[59:27] okay for somebody maybe that was for
[59:29] another age but I just don't think God
[59:31] can heal like that anymore I just don't
[59:33] think I I had to live like that anymore
[59:35] see it's it's reasoning with the word of
[59:37] God that's why we as a body of Believers
[59:39] that we never want to reason with God's
[59:42] word somebody say Amen you say well what
[59:44] do you do you just believe it you don't
[59:46] reason with it you believe it you don't
[59:48] re you don't try to explain it you just
[59:50] believe it you don't try to figure it
[59:51] out he said you just believe it for how
[59:54] can you you figure out God anyway
[59:56] somebody enlighten me so I'll know
[59:59] somebody tell me how you figure out God
[1:00:01] anyway and your vast knowledge I there
[1:00:03] the the men of today they're so wise
[1:00:05] beyond their years they know everything
[1:00:08] but how do you figure out God you
[1:00:10] explain in this finite mind how that you
[1:00:12] would look at a universe and and and and
[1:00:14] figure out God and the vastness of the
[1:00:16] world that we live in and how that God
[1:00:18] in the beginning would create a world
[1:00:21] and speak worlds into existence and I
[1:00:23] off the palm of his hands that he would
[1:00:25] blow stars and universes that he would
[1:00:28] be able to create as somebody help me to
[1:00:30] understand that how would you even be
[1:00:32] able to figure out God bam said see you
[1:00:35] can't figure figure out God he said the
[1:00:37] word isn't made to figure out it's just
[1:00:39] made to believe he said and that is the
[1:00:41] strength of the believer today is just
[1:00:43] to accept God's word you want to know
[1:00:46] where the strength of the church is is
[1:00:47] to accept the word of God you want to
[1:00:49] know where your power over the devil is
[1:00:51] your victory over the devil is to accept
[1:00:53] the word of God your strength over Satan
[1:00:55] is to accept God's word your mind right
[1:00:57] now your mind goes to race saying but I
[1:00:59] got to figure that out I I got to make
[1:01:01] that statement fit and I I got to make
[1:01:03] that if you could ever just surrender to
[1:01:05] the word of God this morning and say I
[1:01:06] ain't maybe not ever going to be able to
[1:01:08] figure it out but I'll just believe
[1:01:09] God's word and I'll live it to the best
[1:01:11] of my
[1:01:12] ability the Bible says his ways are past
[1:01:14] finding
[1:01:15] out but we believe
[1:01:18] it Paul said don't be ignorant of this
[1:01:21] thing next thing second thing he said
[1:01:23] don't be ignorant of the mystery
[1:01:25] concerning Israel and the Gentile he
[1:01:27] said that God in other words God had a
[1:01:29] time that he raised up this great nation
[1:01:31] of Israel but then there come a time a
[1:01:33] new dispensation when God would turn
[1:01:35] from Israel and he would Minister to the
[1:01:37] gentile people how many knows that's the
[1:01:38] age that we're living in now that's our
[1:01:40] dispensation can you imagine that he God
[1:01:43] he carved out of space and time just to
[1:01:45] minister to you here whenever you
[1:01:47] weren't a people of God but he made you
[1:01:49] people of God isn't that isn't that
[1:01:50] something you you you wasn't born of
[1:01:52] this lineage of Jacob or or Abraham of
[1:01:55] their natural lineage but here God has
[1:01:57] made a place for you and I he said don't
[1:02:00] be ignorant of this thing that God he'll
[1:02:01] go save Israel in their time but right
[1:02:03] now he's working on the Gentiles know
[1:02:06] that it's our age know that it's our
[1:02:09] dispensation know that it's the time
[1:02:11] that God is dealing with this church the
[1:02:13] third thing he says to the Thessalonian
[1:02:15] Church don't be ignorant of this one
[1:02:17] thing he said Brethren concerning those
[1:02:20] that have fallen asleep unless you would
[1:02:22] sorrow like the rest of the world when
[1:02:24] they would lose a loved one and there's
[1:02:26] such sorrow because they'll never see
[1:02:28] them again there's such sorrow because
[1:02:29] they've been taken from their life
[1:02:31] there's such sorrow because they can't
[1:02:32] put their arm around him and they can't
[1:02:33] hug him and they can't and it'll never
[1:02:35] be that way again but Paul said don't
[1:02:38] sorrow like the rest of the world don't
[1:02:40] be ignorant of this thing because it's a
[1:02:42] promise that came from God he said for
[1:02:44] our sorrow is not like theirs that has
[1:02:46] no hope he said our sorrow has hope in
[1:02:48] other words that we he said for we
[1:02:50] believe that Jesus died and he rose
[1:02:52] again and God will bring him with or
[1:02:55] with those with him that sleep in Jesus
[1:02:57] he said that we say by the word of the
[1:02:58] Lord that they which are alive and
[1:03:00] remain at the coming of the Lord they
[1:03:02] will not proceede those that sleep but
[1:03:04] he will descend from heaven with a shout
[1:03:06] and a voice of an archangel with the
[1:03:08] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:03:10] shall rise he said don't be ignorant of
[1:03:12] that thing what's he trying to he's
[1:03:14] trying to set the church in order don't
[1:03:15] be ignorant he said then then he goes on
[1:03:17] the fourth thing don't be ignorant of
[1:03:19] the gifts that God has placed in the
[1:03:20] church he said concerning spiritual
[1:03:23] gifts I would not have ignorant but the
[1:03:25] diversity of gifts but there's one
[1:03:27] Spirit In other words there's all kinds
[1:03:29] of members of this church but we're not
[1:03:31] all the same he said but we're all led
[1:03:33] by The Same Spirit that's why you don't
[1:03:35] go attack another churches another
[1:03:37] Minister they're all led by the it's the
[1:03:39] same Spirit God calls one man to to be
[1:03:42] one way or have one gift or do it and
[1:03:44] every man's not going to be the same
[1:03:45] every Pastor is not going to be the same
[1:03:47] every church is not going to be the
[1:03:49] exact same because the ministry isn't
[1:03:51] the exact same is it something they're
[1:03:53] preaching the same word you say what
[1:03:54] makes them different Paul explains this
[1:03:56] he said there's difference of
[1:03:58] administrations but there's the same
[1:03:59] Lord he said there's a diversity of
[1:04:01] operations but it's the same God that
[1:04:03] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:04:06] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:04:08] profit for one is given the spirit of
[1:04:11] wisdom and the other the word of
[1:04:13] knowledge but they have the same Spirit
[1:04:16] he said another is given Faith by The
[1:04:18] Same Spirit to another the gifts of
[1:04:19] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[1:04:22] the working of Miracles by The Same
[1:04:23] Spirit to another prophecy to another
[1:04:26] the Discerning of spirits to another
[1:04:28] diverse kinds of tongues and to another
[1:04:30] the interpretation of tongues it was
[1:04:32] different gifts but it was all by The
[1:04:35] Same Spirit I that something listen what
[1:04:37] Paul's telling us don't be ignorant
[1:04:39] church can I just say it in my Arkansas
[1:04:41] way don't be ignorant of these things as
[1:04:43] you go into this new year don't be
[1:04:45] ignorant of these things that God has
[1:04:47] called he has a lot of a space and time
[1:04:49] for this Gentile church that God has
[1:04:51] called a gentile people in order to be
[1:04:53] one with God and ain't not one of us
[1:04:55] going to be a liive and every one of us
[1:04:57] have have different gifts and one of us
[1:04:59] may have a gift of Prophecy and the
[1:05:01] other one may have a have a gift of
[1:05:02] healing and he said but it's the same
[1:05:04] Spirit we're diverse in there but what
[1:05:06] we are you going to win anyway we're
[1:05:08] going to go with him in the Rapture
[1:05:10] we're going to meet the Lord in the air
[1:05:12] and if some of us would fall by the
[1:05:13] wayside along our journey then don't you
[1:05:16] worry they're going to be with us in
[1:05:17] that day don't be ignorant church have
[1:05:21] the knowledge of the word of the Lord
[1:05:23] see Revelation mark it set you apart
[1:05:26] Revelation gives you faith I didn't mean
[1:05:28] to get this long into this Revelation
[1:05:30] gives you Faith you say well that
[1:05:32] doesn't Faith come by hearing we sure it
[1:05:33] does that's what the Bible says but you
[1:05:34] realize Revelation is actually what
[1:05:36] gives you Faith you said see brother
[1:05:38] says see whenever you could be living
[1:05:40] your whole life and all of a sudden you
[1:05:42] come to a service or somewhere and you
[1:05:43] would hear the gospel being preached how
[1:05:46] come that one person would hear the
[1:05:48] gospel and you know the Bible says faith
[1:05:50] cometh by hearing he said but Revelation
[1:05:52] comes by hearing he said how come that
[1:05:54] one person there would be two people
[1:05:55] sitting side by side and the word of God
[1:05:57] goes forth and this one would hear it
[1:05:59] and receive it and he would gain faith
[1:06:01] and the other would never get no faith
[1:06:02] out of it they both heard the exact same
[1:06:04] word so it can't just be the hearing
[1:06:06] with the ear that would bring Faith to
[1:06:08] the people but there had to be something
[1:06:10] greater that would give you Faith he
[1:06:12] says see so Revelation comes by hearing
[1:06:14] one man right beside you he says I don't
[1:06:16] believe that stuff it's nonsense I don't
[1:06:17] believe it it's just like they did on
[1:06:19] the day of Pentecost when they came out
[1:06:20] brother Jared they were worshiping God
[1:06:22] they were filled with a of the day said
[1:06:24] they thought they were drunk on new wine
[1:06:26] but it didn't matter to them he said
[1:06:28] they laughed at them and said they're
[1:06:30] filled with new wine he said but it
[1:06:32] didn't matter to the others he said
[1:06:33] because there was a great thing that was
[1:06:36] happening to them so they didn't care
[1:06:38] about the world laughing at them because
[1:06:39] there was something great that was
[1:06:41] happening on the inside of them friends
[1:06:42] let me tell you this morning you may be
[1:06:44] sitting in the house of God and the word
[1:06:46] of God goes forth and something begins
[1:06:47] to steering your heart don't worry about
[1:06:49] how everybody else reacts don't worry
[1:06:51] about what everybody else does what
[1:06:53] matters is there's a a great thing that
[1:06:55] is working on the inside of you maybe
[1:06:57] it's a guy by you he didn't get nothing
[1:06:58] out of it maybe the lady across the road
[1:07:00] maybe she didn't get nothing out of it
[1:07:02] but don't worry they can laugh at you if
[1:07:04] they want to but there's a great thing
[1:07:06] that's working on the inside of you they
[1:07:07] can make fun of you if they want to but
[1:07:09] there's a great thing that's working on
[1:07:11] the inside of you he said While others
[1:07:13] laughed these just kept on rejoicing
[1:07:16] glory to God that makes me feel like
[1:07:17] having church this morning let them
[1:07:19] laugh if they want to but they just kept
[1:07:21] on rejoicing while the others cofed they
[1:07:23] just kept rejo that's the way I feel
[1:07:25] about this church let them make fun of
[1:07:26] us if they want to but I'm going to keep
[1:07:28] on rejoicing let let them call us what
[1:07:30] they want to but I'm going to keep on
[1:07:32] praising God let them let them put us
[1:07:34] down if they want to you can call us
[1:07:35] what you want but I thank God that he
[1:07:37] saved me I thank God that He gave me a
[1:07:40] place of worship I thank God that He
[1:07:42] gave me brothers and sisters to have
[1:07:44] Fellowship I thank God let them say what
[1:07:47] they want but we're just going to keep
[1:07:49] on rejoicing let them say let them talk
[1:07:52] how they want to we keep rejoicing reing
[1:07:54] he said it was an individual Revelation
[1:07:57] which is faith faith that's revealed see
[1:07:59] our faith brother the Mark is a product
[1:08:02] of our
[1:08:03] Revelation the greater Revelation that
[1:08:05] you have then the Revelation is going to
[1:08:07] bring Faith but it only comes it's not
[1:08:10] just hearing the word with a natural ear
[1:08:13] but it's hearing a word that is revealed
[1:08:15] in the heart see when a revealed word
[1:08:17] comes brother Mark it gives you such a
[1:08:19] faith such I get to look at this last
[1:08:22] night and or all day yesterday yesterday
[1:08:24] thinking about these Revelations that
[1:08:26] God has laid in the Bible you find in
[1:08:28] the first verse in the Bible which we
[1:08:30] read is one of the greatest Revelations
[1:08:32] that lays in the scripture the Bible
[1:08:34] says in Genesis 1 in the beginning God
[1:08:36] created the Heaven and the Earth how
[1:08:39] many knows what that word God is in
[1:08:40] Hebrew it's Elohim says so in the
[1:08:44] beginning Elohim created the Heaven and
[1:08:47] the Earth this word Elohim for the mark
[1:08:50] it means the Lord God or the great one
[1:08:53] the all efficient one the strong one the
[1:08:56] almighty God the self-existing one this
[1:08:59] is the god that created the heavens and
[1:09:02] the Earth he was self-existing but the
[1:09:03] mark that means God was there when there
[1:09:05] was no air God was there when there was
[1:09:08] no light he was there when there was no
[1:09:11] Earth and no stars and no solar system
[1:09:14] there was there was no Universe there
[1:09:15] was only God he was self-existing you
[1:09:18] realize that friends that just to have
[1:09:20] the knowledge with your head knowledge
[1:09:22] of Elohim in the beginning it bypasses
[1:09:24] human understanding to even understand
[1:09:27] Elohim see because our nature what's
[1:09:29] your nature do look at all of humanity
[1:09:31] over the past 6,000 years the very
[1:09:33] number one question that Humanity has
[1:09:35] tried to answer is where did I come from
[1:09:38] so they come up with all these theories
[1:09:39] of of where men came from and how we
[1:09:41] came from this cell and this big old
[1:09:43] Atomic blast or and they make shows
[1:09:45] about it and movies about it and they
[1:09:47] have a they have they have entire uh uh
[1:09:49] uh sections of colleges and universities
[1:09:51] that are dedicated to that very thing of
[1:09:54] understanding the conception of human
[1:09:56] life where did we come from because of
[1:09:58] our nature that's on our nature our
[1:10:00] nature is to want to know where we came
[1:10:02] from isin't that something that's why in
[1:10:04] your own nature or your own mind you
[1:10:06] could never even understand God because
[1:10:08] the question would be well God was
[1:10:10] self-existing he was there when there
[1:10:12] was nothing and your nature would say
[1:10:14] but where did he come from well he was
[1:10:16] just there but how is he just there he
[1:10:18] was just there but what put him there
[1:10:20] well nothing put him there he was just
[1:10:22] there are you with me right now see our
[1:10:24] our understanding cannot even fathom it
[1:10:27] because our buildup is that we were
[1:10:28] created somewhere in our human this
[1:10:31] flesh man brother Mar it came by
[1:10:32] creation and so we're always looking to
[1:10:34] Creation where did it come from how did
[1:10:36] it start what is the origin of it so we
[1:10:38] couldn't even understand the basic first
[1:10:40] thing in the Bible by our own knowledge
[1:10:42] is that God was a self-existing god you
[1:10:45] can't even prove it by your own
[1:10:47] knowledge there ain't no great education
[1:10:49] no matter how educated you ever become
[1:10:50] you'll never be able to prove that thing
[1:10:52] that God was a self existing God you
[1:10:55] there there's no way to show it where
[1:10:57] did it come from said see our nature
[1:10:59] asked this where did we come from he
[1:11:01] said but the revelation of the name
[1:11:02] Elohim watch this brother Wes it's the
[1:11:05] Revelation that shows how Christ would
[1:11:06] even return in the age that we live in
[1:11:09] to me it's one of the greatest
[1:11:10] revelations in all the scripture to be
[1:11:12] able to recognize Christ in his present
[1:11:14] form a this something what good is a God
[1:11:17] that you can't recognize what good is a
[1:11:19] God that you can't talk to what good is
[1:11:20] a god of History what good is he being
[1:11:22] so great but he but he but he ain't
[1:11:24] nothing to you to see but to be able to
[1:11:27] recognize him now watch what what what
[1:11:29] helps us to be able to see God is
[1:11:31] there's a principle you can Malachi the
[1:11:33] third chapter the sixth verse the Bible
[1:11:35] says for I am the Lord and I change not
[1:11:39] here's a principle that God lays in the
[1:11:40] scripture this is how that we can
[1:11:42] recognize God we got to have this as a
[1:11:44] foundation we're going forward in 24 we
[1:11:47] got to have this as a foundation that
[1:11:49] God is a God that does not change he
[1:11:51] said I am the Lord and I change not
[1:11:54] Hebrews the seven or in the book of
[1:11:56] Hebrews Paul says wherein God would more
[1:11:59] abundantly to show The Heirs of his
[1:12:01] promise the immutability of his counsel
[1:12:04] now that word immutable means unchanging
[1:12:06] over time or unable to be changed so
[1:12:09] Paul says here God is making a promise
[1:12:12] to The Heirs and to these heirs This
[1:12:15] Promise he's going to give is by the
[1:12:17] immutability of his counsel so for God
[1:12:19] to be immutable Paul says that God used
[1:12:21] two immutable things one that it was
[1:12:23] impossible for God to lie and then God
[1:12:26] swore an oath it did something so Paul
[1:12:28] said that God wants to make sure that
[1:12:30] you're able to accept this that one that
[1:12:32] God doesn't change he cannot lie and the
[1:12:35] god that can't lie is the one that made
[1:12:37] the promise so that you don't have to
[1:12:38] worry about it whenever God put it in
[1:12:40] his word it was put there that that it
[1:12:42] would never go away see brother B said
[1:12:44] see immutability it means unchangeable
[1:12:46] this is a principle that you have to
[1:12:48] have that God is an unchanging God
[1:12:50] somebody somebody catch that this
[1:12:51] morning he's an unchanging God he said
[1:12:53] he's unchangeable he cannot change but
[1:12:55] he has to remain the same so if he ever
[1:12:57] healed one sick person he can't change
[1:12:59] his attitude if he ever forgave one
[1:13:01] sinner or one prostitute he couldn't
[1:13:03] change his attitude if he he's immutable
[1:13:05] he's unchanging of God's word if he ever
[1:13:08] said in one place I'm the Lord that
[1:13:10] heals all thy diseases then he has to
[1:13:12] stay with it because he's an infinite
[1:13:14] God sometimes we give our word brother
[1:13:16] Mark and we have to change it because
[1:13:18] we're not infinite we're finite
[1:13:20] sometimes we'll say brother I'm going to
[1:13:21] do that I I'm going to do it next week I
[1:13:23] promise you that you don't have to worry
[1:13:25] about it it's going to be done next week
[1:13:27] rolls along something happen
[1:13:28] circumstances and all of a sudden you
[1:13:30] sayy brother I'm so sorry I meant to do
[1:13:32] that but next week it's going to be the
[1:13:33] week see sometimes we have to change
[1:13:36] circumstances that cause us to have to
[1:13:38] change our our word or change our mind
[1:13:41] but you realize brother R says notice
[1:13:42] God is not that way he don't change his
[1:13:44] mind that means whatever he thought
[1:13:46] about you in the beginning he still
[1:13:47] thinks about you right now oh that makes
[1:13:49] me want to preach that Manan it don't
[1:13:51] matter how bad you got it don't matter
[1:13:52] how far away way you got from God
[1:13:54] whatever God thought about you he can't
[1:13:56] even change his mind about you if he if
[1:13:58] he created you in His image then he
[1:14:00] still thinks of you that way today it
[1:14:02] don't matter where he has to go to get
[1:14:03] you why cuz God is going to build you
[1:14:05] back to the way he made you he said we
[1:14:07] don't change we change our word God
[1:14:09] always keeps his he say so the question
[1:14:11] isn't on the word the question is
[1:14:12] whether you believe the word or not so
[1:14:14] there's our our principle that we're
[1:14:16] basing all of this on is that God can't
[1:14:18] change his word can't change he cannot
[1:14:20] change how wonderful is it that God
[1:14:22] cannot change that's why Jesus would say
[1:14:24] if you can believe then all things are
[1:14:27] possible so it isn't that God ain't
[1:14:29] doing it anymore but it's can you
[1:14:31] believe it it is that God a ain't moving
[1:14:33] amongst his children anymore but it's
[1:14:36] can you believe it see God's word is
[1:14:38] true is is God's word still true is it
[1:14:40] still inspired is does he still do the
[1:14:43] same thing is he still a Healer is he
[1:14:45] still a savior is it still true in
[1:14:48] 2024 you know there was a there was a
[1:14:51] story of of a little woman one time her
[1:14:53] son was off at a seminary school and she
[1:14:56] got real sick and so they called him and
[1:14:58] they said you that your mom she's on her
[1:15:00] deathbed and so just hang on by the
[1:15:02] phone because we're we don't know what's
[1:15:04] going to happen to her they're taking
[1:15:05] her to the doctor and so the he waited
[1:15:07] around next day they they called him
[1:15:09] back they said don't worry everything's
[1:15:10] fine everything worked out he said well
[1:15:12] good praise the Lord he went on to
[1:15:13] school few months later he gets out of
[1:15:15] Seminary and he comes back home to his
[1:15:17] mom and and you know they got to visit
[1:15:19] in hadn't seen her in a while finally he
[1:15:21] says mom you know there's something I
[1:15:22] meant to ask you he said you remember
[1:15:23] here a few months ago when you when I
[1:15:25] was down at school and and and and you
[1:15:28] you you you were sick and they said that
[1:15:29] you know something had happened that
[1:15:31] night and he said you everything was
[1:15:32] well he said what what what what was
[1:15:34] wrong with you what what what medicine
[1:15:35] did they give you the you know what the
[1:15:37] doctor do to make you well overnight he
[1:15:39] said here they told me to wait by the
[1:15:40] phone that you might be on your deathbed
[1:15:42] he said the next day they told me all
[1:15:43] was well he said what did the doctor
[1:15:45] give you that could allow you to be well
[1:15:47] overnight she said oh son I I didn't
[1:15:49] have an opportunity to tell you she said
[1:15:51] but it wasn't nothing the doctor gave me
[1:15:53] at at all she said but there was a
[1:15:54] little Mission down here a little church
[1:15:56] and and there was a couple sisters in
[1:15:58] there and they got it on their heart
[1:15:59] when they were in their prayer meeting
[1:16:00] and they got it on their heart to come
[1:16:02] and pray for me and so they got their
[1:16:03] pastor and they came over there and
[1:16:05] their Pastor sat down in our living room
[1:16:07] and he got to explaining to me Mark the
[1:16:09] 16th chapter and he told me about how
[1:16:11] that God would heal the sick and how how
[1:16:13] that that the commission was given to
[1:16:15] the church to lay hands on the sick and
[1:16:17] they shall recover she said and they
[1:16:18] laid hands on me and that all that stuff
[1:16:21] went away from me that very night and I
[1:16:23] woke up the next morning and I was
[1:16:24] perfectly well oh my she got to praising
[1:16:27] God she said my wasn't it wonderful and
[1:16:29] her son he got a little worked up he
[1:16:31] said now mama he said no I hope he said
[1:16:33] now I hope you didn't go over there and
[1:16:34] start going to church with them and
[1:16:36] stuff like that she said well honey what
[1:16:37] do you mean he said well I'll have you
[1:16:39] know I spent four years in a seminary
[1:16:41] school and the scripture that they
[1:16:43] quoted you he said we were actually
[1:16:45] taught in seminary and proven by
[1:16:47] theologians that that scripture was not
[1:16:49] even inspired by
[1:16:51] God and that little woman got the
[1:16:53] shouting she said Oh Glory to God
[1:16:56] hallelujah thank you Lord he said oh
[1:16:59] mama what's the matter with you she said
[1:17:01] well I've read of all the promises that
[1:17:03] God has laid in the Bible and just to
[1:17:05] think that if God could heal my body
[1:17:07] with a scripture that wasn't Inspire
[1:17:09] then what about all those that are is I
[1:17:11] thank God that there's still a word that
[1:17:14] is inspired by God let me tell you
[1:17:16] friends Paul said all the scripture is
[1:17:18] good for Doctrine all scripture is
[1:17:21] inspired by God it's God's word word and
[1:17:23] if he ever wrote it he still means it
[1:17:25] today he's an unchanging God with an
[1:17:27] unchanging
[1:17:29] word it's inspired by God yes amen it's
[1:17:33] something we can build on you can build
[1:17:35] your family on you can establish your
[1:17:37] family on it and build it and in 10
[1:17:39] years from now you don't have to look
[1:17:40] back and think you made a mistake this
[1:17:42] is the year of 2024 friend you say I
[1:17:45] want to build my life I want a greater
[1:17:46] life I want everything to work out
[1:17:48] better build your life on the foundation
[1:17:50] of the word of God establish your in
[1:17:53] God's word and allow God to be able to
[1:17:55] build for you it's a real Foundation now
[1:18:00] watch this Paradox here the
[1:18:03] god that don't change I'm going to hurry
[1:18:05] God that don't change here but when you
[1:18:08] see God if God doesn't change but when
[1:18:10] you see God in the scripture isn't it
[1:18:12] something that every time God presents
[1:18:14] himself to somebody he always does it
[1:18:16] differently you notice here you read the
[1:18:18] Bible says God he doesn't change he's
[1:18:20] the same God but then when you read
[1:18:22] about Abraham he goes down to the tent
[1:18:23] here comes a man that that walked down
[1:18:25] by Abraham brother Mark and he picked up
[1:18:27] food and he sat there and ate and had
[1:18:28] fellowship with Abraham he showed he
[1:18:30] came to him as a man but then when Moses
[1:18:33] met him he was a burning bush the god
[1:18:35] that don't change one day he was a man
[1:18:38] the next day he was a burning bush the
[1:18:41] god that don't change the next time we
[1:18:43] find Gideon over hiding behind a wine
[1:18:45] press and he comes to Gideon as an angel
[1:18:47] the next time we see Joshua and Joshua
[1:18:50] meets him when he's getting prepared for
[1:18:51] battle to go in into Jericho and the
[1:18:53] Bible says Joshua met him as the captain
[1:18:55] of the
[1:18:56] host he wasn't Abraham met him as MDC
[1:19:00] Joshua met him as the captain of the
[1:19:01] host Daniel met him in a in the Lion's
[1:19:04] Den as a pillar of fire brother said
[1:19:06] here here was a pillar of fire whenever
[1:19:08] when the Hebrew children met him brother
[1:19:10] Mark he was a man the fourth man walking
[1:19:12] in the fire isn't this something that
[1:19:14] here is a God that don't change but when
[1:19:16] you see him but a Mark he's different
[1:19:18] and every it just seems he's he's
[1:19:20] different he presents himself in a
[1:19:21] different way but was Christ that would
[1:19:23] come in every age Ezekiel saw him as a
[1:19:26] will in the middle of the whe Abraham
[1:19:28] said I saw him as mecdc John whenever he
[1:19:31] looked out across the Wilderness he said
[1:19:33] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[1:19:35] the sin of the world see he saw him
[1:19:38] differently but now watch this when you
[1:19:41] read about this word Elohim brother the
[1:19:43] mark do you realize that the name Elohim
[1:19:45] is not a singular word in the Hebrew
[1:19:48] language Elohim is actually plural so
[1:19:50] instead of Apple say apples because
[1:19:52] there's many matter of fact this word
[1:19:54] Elohim is the very word the very first
[1:19:56] scripture in the Bible is the word that
[1:19:58] people use that denominations use to
[1:20:01] prove the Trinity well there's a father
[1:20:03] and a son and a holy ghost there's three
[1:20:04] Gods because right in the Bible it says
[1:20:06] Elohim his name's Elohim and after all
[1:20:08] Elohim is a plural word so there must be
[1:20:11] more than one God because they are them
[1:20:13] Elohim it's a plural word really is but
[1:20:17] notice I thank God brother Mark that
[1:20:19] when you read something see there's a
[1:20:21] difference way we read and way the the
[1:20:22] world reads sir see we're not reading it
[1:20:25] with a question we're reading it with an
[1:20:26] answer is it something to live after a
[1:20:28] prophet comes can you imagine living in
[1:20:30] the age before there was a prophet and
[1:20:32] you didn't know the answer and everybody
[1:20:33] it was all this debate and confusion but
[1:20:35] we're reading it after the Prophet come
[1:20:37] see see notice he said Elohim the the
[1:20:40] Elohim certainly it's a plural word but
[1:20:43] the plurality of Elohim doesn't refer to
[1:20:46] multiple gods but the plurality of
[1:20:48] Elohim is not many gods but it's many
[1:20:51] attributes in one God amen So when you
[1:20:53] say all of this as as plural then you
[1:20:56] say well God the Healer God the Savior
[1:20:59] God the comforter God the Father God the
[1:21:01] mother oh friends don't you realize it's
[1:21:03] whatever you have need of he's the same
[1:21:05] God that heals you he's the same God
[1:21:07] that heals your diseases he's the same
[1:21:09] God that comes to you in the Midnight
[1:21:10] Hour when you need a when you need a
[1:21:12] comforter by your bedside he's the same
[1:21:14] God that that that that will save you
[1:21:16] when you're lost he's the same God the
[1:21:18] plurality of Elohim is the attributes of
[1:21:20] almighty God don't you realize that
[1:21:22] that's what God was everything that was
[1:21:24] in Him Sister Debbie it was something on
[1:21:26] the inside of this self-existing God he
[1:21:29] was a father but he had nobody to be a
[1:21:31] father to he he he was a mother but he
[1:21:33] had nobody to be a mother to the very
[1:21:35] attributes the the nature of God all
[1:21:37] this was in God's
[1:21:39] nature he was a Healer but there was
[1:21:41] nobody sick to heal he was a savior but
[1:21:44] there wasn't nobody lost that he could
[1:21:45] save he was a God but there was nobody
[1:21:47] to worship him so he couldn't be God and
[1:21:49] it drove him to create it drove him to
[1:21:53] make
[1:21:55] life said inside of that was attribute
[1:21:59] this attribute which meant he was inside
[1:22:01] the great l or Elohim was an attribute
[1:22:04] he said you know what it was it was the
[1:22:06] nature of God he said inside of him was
[1:22:08] the nature to be a father but he was
[1:22:10] self-existent there wasn't nothing to be
[1:22:12] a father by inside of that was a nature
[1:22:15] to be a God but the god is an object of
[1:22:17] worship and he was self-existent so
[1:22:19] there was nothing to worship him inside
[1:22:22] of that that was a savior but there was
[1:22:24] nothing lost nothing could be saved
[1:22:27] inside of that he was a Healer but there
[1:22:29] was nothing sick that could be healed
[1:22:31] nothing to be sick to see do you get the
[1:22:34] picture they were God's attributes and
[1:22:36] his nature listen friends he said his
[1:22:39] nature produced what is
[1:22:42] today the desire of God to be a Healer
[1:22:45] produced what is today the desire of God
[1:22:48] to be a father produced what is today
[1:22:51] the desire of God to be a a savior
[1:22:53] produce what is today that he could
[1:22:55] manifest himself as a savior now is this
[1:22:57] something that this the plurality of the
[1:23:00] word Elohim brother the Wesley the Old
[1:23:02] Testament we find that many ways names
[1:23:04] that he was called by matter of fact he
[1:23:06] was called by the Redemptive names the
[1:23:07] seven Redemptive names they all had a
[1:23:09] different meaning one called him Jehovah
[1:23:10] Gyra you're my provider one called him
[1:23:13] Jehovah Jam or shama he's present with
[1:23:15] me one call him Jehovah Shalom he's my
[1:23:18] peace one said he's Jehovah nessi he's
[1:23:20] my victory one Jehovah rehea my shepherd
[1:23:23] one Jehovah sidono he was my
[1:23:25] righteousness one called him Jehovah
[1:23:27] rapi he's my he's my healer he was all
[1:23:30] those things it it didn't matter what
[1:23:32] name that they used he was all of those
[1:23:33] things but notice even though he was all
[1:23:36] those things listen what Moses writes
[1:23:39] Deuteronomy the 4th chapter he said here
[1:23:42] oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:23:46] now can I read that to you in
[1:23:48] Hebrew it says Shema
[1:23:50] Israel Yahweh
[1:23:53] Yahweh Elohim EAD
[1:23:57] Yahweh the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:24:01] Yahweh Elohim EOD Yahweh the Lord our
[1:24:06] God is one Lord but the Mark here
[1:24:09] although he would manifest himself in so
[1:24:11] many ways here when it was written of
[1:24:14] him Moses would make it plain that God
[1:24:16] he will come and he will he he was met
[1:24:19] him in a burning bush and Abraham did
[1:24:21] meet him as MZ dig but Abraham but but
[1:24:24] when he writes to that he said Elohim
[1:24:26] the Lord Our God Elohim is one Lord It's
[1:24:30] Elohim he's one God but Mark he came to
[1:24:34] Earth as a baby no wonder whenever they
[1:24:37] they saw him when he was born in a
[1:24:39] manger that they couldn't accept him as
[1:24:41] God because they were looking for
[1:24:43] something else but he came in a way that
[1:24:46] men had overlooked the very gift that
[1:24:48] God had brought to the world here here
[1:24:51] that they had brought him that God had
[1:24:52] brought him this way and they would they
[1:24:54] would look at him and they couldn't they
[1:24:56] couldn't accept him can you realize that
[1:24:57] they were looking for this great big God
[1:24:59] but all of a sudden how could they how
[1:25:01] could they even understand that Elohim
[1:25:03] would come in the form of a baby well
[1:25:05] don't you know brother that Isaiah
[1:25:07] prophesied that a virgin shall conceive
[1:25:09] and maybe the men of that day said well
[1:25:11] we believe that we we believe that she
[1:25:13] she could conceive but that don't you
[1:25:15] know but but but but we don't know that
[1:25:17] that was it and you know they're always
[1:25:19] they they couldn't apply it to him cuz
[1:25:21] they just couldn't see El him in a
[1:25:23] Manger the self-existent one the god of
[1:25:26] Heaven even though they couldn't they
[1:25:28] couldn't recognize think of it here
[1:25:30] Moses recognized him in a burning bush
[1:25:32] everybody else didn't recognize him that
[1:25:34] way they took the word of Moses other
[1:25:37] whenever Abraham met him and and he fed
[1:25:39] him at the door here Abraham had a faith
[1:25:41] that his wife didn't even have she was
[1:25:42] laughing at the promise had she known
[1:25:44] that was the god of Heaven standing
[1:25:46] there the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:25:47] maybe she wouldn't have laughed so
[1:25:49] much see but Abraham knew him
[1:25:53] they saw him as who he was but here he
[1:25:55] goes through every age brother Mark as
[1:25:56] an unseen God he comes into every age
[1:25:59] revealing himself to a people but they
[1:26:01] don't see him in the in the form that
[1:26:03] he's in here when he came in a Manger
[1:26:05] they didn't see him in the form that
[1:26:06] he's in but watch what David says in
[1:26:08] Psalms 45 and6 he says but thy Throne oh
[1:26:11] God speaking Elohim thy Throne oh Elohim
[1:26:15] is forever and ever and the scepter of
[1:26:17] thy kingdom is a right scepter listen
[1:26:20] here here David writes of it thy throne
[1:26:22] oh Elohim is forever and ever Paul picks
[1:26:24] it up in the Hebrews the 1 chapter in
[1:26:26] the 8th verse he said but unto the son
[1:26:29] he was speaking thy Throne oh Elohim is
[1:26:32] forever and ever here Paul lets you know
[1:26:35] he said the Elohim that David was
[1:26:37] speaking of was the very Son of God it
[1:26:39] was Jesus Christ so it wasn't just God
[1:26:42] in the beginning the very God Of Heaven
[1:26:44] was Jesus Christ he said th the son he
[1:26:47] saith thy Throne o Elohim is forever and
[1:26:50] ever here Paul tells us right Hebrews 1
[1:26:52] and8 that the Son of God is Elohim it is
[1:26:55] God the self-existing one that man Jesus
[1:26:58] that they crucified it's God the
[1:27:00] self-existing one he fulfilled the very
[1:27:03] scripture his righteousness is the
[1:27:05] scepter of the Kingdom backa said he
[1:27:07] would be born in Bethlehem Hosea said
[1:27:09] he'd be called out of Egypt but when you
[1:27:11] meet him today for the west of you know
[1:27:14] him by the name of Jesus Christ you know
[1:27:18] him by his name Jesus you said well how
[1:27:20] do I know it was Elohim well listen what
[1:27:22] Paul said Paul or Peter said he said let
[1:27:25] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[1:27:27] that God hath made that same Jesus who
[1:27:29] you've crucified both Lord and Christ
[1:27:33] the son to the son he
[1:27:35] said thy Throne o Elohim isn't that
[1:27:38] something that he called the son Elohim
[1:27:41] he said the same Lord in Christ that
[1:27:43] Peter spoke of was the same Lord in
[1:27:45] Christ that Moses was writing about oh
[1:27:47] you ever notice this in Mark the 16th
[1:27:49] chapter and I'm going to hurry and close
[1:27:51] you ever notice in mark
[1:27:52] 16 at the beginning of it the Bible says
[1:27:54] when Jesus was risen the first day of
[1:27:57] the week he appeared to Mar Mary
[1:27:58] Magdalene first out of whom he had cast
[1:28:01] out Seven Devils remember he had just
[1:28:02] resurrected he appeared to Mary
[1:28:04] Magdalene first I've never really caught
[1:28:06] this in this way the next verse it says
[1:28:09] and she went out and told them they had
[1:28:11] been with him as they mourned and wept
[1:28:13] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:28:15] alive and had been seen of her they
[1:28:17] believed not and after that he appeared
[1:28:21] in another form
[1:28:22] unto them two that walked and went into
[1:28:25] the country a't that something that just
[1:28:27] after he appears to Mary Magdalene the
[1:28:29] Bible says but he appeared to them in
[1:28:31] another form the same God the same
[1:28:34] Elohim he appeared to him in another
[1:28:36] form and they went out and told the
[1:28:37] disciples but they didn't believe them
[1:28:38] either and afterward he appeared under
[1:28:40] the 11 as they set at meat Jesus came to
[1:28:43] the 11 and he up braided them because of
[1:28:45] their unbelief he had braided them
[1:28:47] because of their Hardness of Heart
[1:28:49] because they believed not them which had
[1:28:51] seen him him after he was risen isn't
[1:28:53] that the condition of the world today
[1:28:55] that they would believe not them that
[1:28:57] has saw him after his resurrection you
[1:29:00] can go and testify of all the things
[1:29:02] that you've seen God do and vindicate
[1:29:04] his resurrection but they didn't believe
[1:29:06] those that saw him after his
[1:29:07] resurrection but I think it's something
[1:29:09] see he appeared to Mary Magdalene in one
[1:29:11] form he appeared to them on the road to
[1:29:14] EMAs in another form but Mark here he is
[1:29:16] today he's an unseen God I'm going to
[1:29:18] close you may as well just preach with
[1:29:19] me a minute he I know y'all getting
[1:29:21] tired God bless you but I I know I am
[1:29:25] but it's I tell you but he's an unseen
[1:29:28] God but Mark he's an unseen God he in
[1:29:32] the world when they look to him they
[1:29:34] look for God they find him they they
[1:29:36] look for a god with nail scarred hands
[1:29:38] they're looking for a crown of thorns
[1:29:40] that they can identify Christ they're
[1:29:41] looking for something that they can look
[1:29:42] to and they can put their hands on and
[1:29:44] say now we have God but he's an unseen
[1:29:47] God you realize this is the very thing
[1:29:49] even though the Bible would tell us
[1:29:50] that's what the brother he would take
[1:29:52] that very thing he say but the Bible
[1:29:53] never promised you'd see him with NS
[1:29:55] cardan that's what the world is full of
[1:29:57] today it's a bunch of doub and Thomases
[1:29:59] that are that are looking today let me
[1:30:00] see the hands of Jesus let let me put my
[1:30:02] fingers in his hand but you'll never see
[1:30:04] him that way in this world that we live
[1:30:06] in I know there was a great Revival some
[1:30:08] men told me of when I was doing
[1:30:09] missionary work in India they said
[1:30:11] you've got to you got to go over into uh
[1:30:13] into I forget the Iraq or or or Saudi
[1:30:16] Arabia or somewhere you got to go over
[1:30:18] there the greatest Revival that's ever
[1:30:19] struck the Earth they're actually seeing
[1:30:22] Jesus walked down the road I said I
[1:30:23] wouldn't want no part of that because my
[1:30:25] Bible tells me differently I don't care
[1:30:27] what you're seeing but it sure ain't him
[1:30:29] cuz the Bible says he won't be there
[1:30:31] until after the Millennium he wouldn't
[1:30:33] even be walking upon the Earth that so
[1:30:35] you don't have to look for him walking
[1:30:36] on the earth anybody could dress like
[1:30:38] Jesus and put nail prints in his hands
[1:30:40] Hollywood can put can put a crown of
[1:30:42] thorns on a man's head and walk him down
[1:30:44] in front of you if that's all it takes
[1:30:46] to believe anybody could produce that
[1:30:48] but he didn't promise to come that way
[1:30:50] he promised to come by the word of God
[1:30:52] and it would be manifested in the
[1:30:54] preaching of the word would produce the
[1:30:56] very same thing that it did when Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ was walking on the earth he's an
[1:31:01] unseen God remember when John the
[1:31:03] Baptist came preaching brother Wesley
[1:31:05] when he came down there he preached he
[1:31:06] said there's one among you who you know
[1:31:08] not how many knows that today you
[1:31:10] couldn't even use that scripture there a
[1:31:13] you can't even use that no more CU it
[1:31:14] don't even fit it a't be no different
[1:31:16] than you saying Noah telling everybody
[1:31:17] that there's a flood coming there's no
[1:31:19] flood coming you can't even use the
[1:31:20] scripture of John the Baptist there's
[1:31:22] one among you who you know not you can't
[1:31:24] use it in that way cuz today it's no
[1:31:26] longer an accurate statement today you
[1:31:28] know who he is here John was standing
[1:31:31] amongst a group of people and here Jesus
[1:31:33] was walking and nobody knew that he was
[1:31:35] the Christ but notice what John done
[1:31:38] what what he done brother Mark is he
[1:31:40] made him known you remember what Paul
[1:31:41] did when he went on Marsh Hill is that
[1:31:43] not the same thing Paul did he went up
[1:31:45] there on their on their altar there was
[1:31:47] an inscription that said to the unknown
[1:31:48] God Paul went right up in the midst of
[1:31:50] them and he went to preaching but Mark
[1:31:52] he said let me he said let me declare
[1:31:53] unto you he said I've seen your altar it
[1:31:55] said to an unknown God he said but you
[1:31:58] ignorantly worship him but I want to
[1:31:59] declare to you that the god that made
[1:32:02] the world and in all things therein
[1:32:04] seeing that he's the lord of the Heaven
[1:32:06] and Earth he dwells not in temples made
[1:32:08] with man's hands neither is he worship
[1:32:10] with your hands that he needs something
[1:32:11] from you for he's the one that gives
[1:32:13] life to all he's the one that gives
[1:32:15] breath to all he's the one that gives
[1:32:16] all things to us and he has made of one
[1:32:19] blood all nations of men to dwell on the
[1:32:22] face of the Earth it's God that made men
[1:32:26] that determined our limits of our
[1:32:28] habitation determined the the time that
[1:32:30] we would be appointed he said and that
[1:32:32] you when you would seek after the Lord
[1:32:34] he said don't worry if you'll feel for
[1:32:36] him you'll find him cuz that Creator
[1:32:38] Elohim is not far from you what was he
[1:32:40] doing he was making God known to the
[1:32:43] people you look for a God you're praying
[1:32:45] to an unknown God you get down on your
[1:32:47] knees and you're calling out oh god of
[1:32:49] Heaven somewhere oh come and help me
[1:32:51] Lord you you know how I need you and how
[1:32:53] that people today they're praying to a
[1:32:55] god an unknown God but Paul said but let
[1:32:57] me make him known unto you if you're
[1:32:59] seeking after God it's because God put a
[1:33:02] desire in your heart to find him so if
[1:33:04] you're seeking him you shall find him
[1:33:06] cuz he's not far from
[1:33:08] you let me make you known what was he
[1:33:10] doing he was declaring God he made him
[1:33:13] known to the people he said for in him
[1:33:15] we live in him we move in him we breathe
[1:33:19] in him we have our being without him we
[1:33:21] wouldn't even exist We Are The Offspring
[1:33:24] of Elohim We're The Offspring of God he
[1:33:28] said listen he's appointed to this day
[1:33:31] to be the judge of the world in
[1:33:33] righteousness he by one man that he has
[1:33:37] ordained he would be the judge of the
[1:33:39] world but he ha given Assurance unto us
[1:33:43] in that he ha raised him from the dead
[1:33:46] what did he do he preached they were
[1:33:47] looking for a God that was unknown and
[1:33:50] he made him known to them
[1:33:52] and the man Jesus Christ the
[1:33:54] resurrection said what was he doing he
[1:33:56] was preaching in the power of his
[1:33:57] resurrection to make him known friend
[1:33:59] don't you realize that's the same thing
[1:34:01] that happened today he made God known to
[1:34:03] the people he used a Prophet by the name
[1:34:05] of Paul to go down there and preach to
[1:34:07] him and say let me make him known unto
[1:34:09] you friends the same thing happened
[1:34:10] today it wasn't Paul it was a prophet
[1:34:13] named William brandham but when he
[1:34:14] preached he proved the resurrection of
[1:34:16] Jesus Christ what was he doing he wasn't
[1:34:18] trying to build his own Ministry but he
[1:34:19] was making God known to the people that
[1:34:22] had lost their way that had been wrapped
[1:34:24] up in spiritualism and formalism and
[1:34:27] denominational uh denominationalism and
[1:34:29] they' got so wrapped up and they needed
[1:34:31] a way out and God sent a prophet right
[1:34:33] down amongst his children to to to
[1:34:35] vindicate the resurrection of Jesus
[1:34:38] Christ and to say he ain't some God of
[1:34:40] History he ain't a dead God he's not a
[1:34:43] bygone God but he's the same yesterday
[1:34:45] today and forever and what he did back
[1:34:48] then he'll still do today he made God
[1:34:51] known to the people and let me tell you
[1:34:53] what happened the same thing happened
[1:34:55] today well you say well what's going to
[1:34:56] happen well I'll tell you what happened
[1:34:58] in the days of Paul and that'll show you
[1:35:00] what'll happen today the Bible says when
[1:35:02] Paul made Jesus known that many of them
[1:35:05] mocked him for what he said many of them
[1:35:07] made fun of him some of them scoffed at
[1:35:10] him others said well we'll just talk
[1:35:12] about it later is that not the same
[1:35:14] thing today some was cough he's made the
[1:35:18] Resurrection on some made fun but the
[1:35:20] Bible says I love this heart here's our
[1:35:22] portion the Bible says how be it there
[1:35:25] were certain men that clave unto him and
[1:35:28] believed majority they wouldn't they
[1:35:31] wouldn't believe it the majority they
[1:35:32] wouldn't accept this man Jesus that was
[1:35:35] being Vindicated his resurrection from
[1:35:37] Vindicated by Paul's Ministry they
[1:35:38] wouldn't accepted said but there was
[1:35:40] some that clave unto him and believed
[1:35:43] said why why why they believe but a m
[1:35:45] because God had been made known unto
[1:35:47] them is't it something he said see John
[1:35:50] you want to go ahead and stand to your
[1:35:51] feet I'm I'm not going to get to all of
[1:35:52] it anyway we'll pick it up next Sunday
[1:35:54] but John said there's one among you whom
[1:35:56] you know

[1:38:08] brother bram's whole Ministry was to
[1:38:09] make him known see many people get that
[1:38:12] they get that backwards they look at the
[1:38:14] ministry brother brandom and so many
[1:38:16] people following after his ministry and
[1:38:18] they say Well they're all following
[1:38:20] after this man and all the the gift that
[1:38:22] he had but you you fail to realize that
[1:38:24] it was no different than those that
[1:38:25] followed after Paul's Ministry they went
[1:38:28] to Paul's Church they went and sat down
[1:38:30] under the ministry of Paul who was a
[1:38:31] prophet of God brother Mark because he
[1:38:34] had an experience with the Lord and He
[1:38:35] Vindicated the resurrection of Jesus
[1:38:37] Christ that's what the ministry of
[1:38:39] William brandham done it proved the
[1:38:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ let me ask
[1:38:43] you if you put him on trial today what
[1:38:45] would you
[1:38:46] do if you was on trial life or death and
[1:38:50] they told you you Pro Pro to me that
[1:38:51] Jesus Christ is still alive you proved
[1:38:54] to me he's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:56] forever how would you prove
[1:38:59] it ask the Muslim that well I know he's
[1:39:03] alive cuz he's living in my heart that's
[1:39:05] wonderful but the Muslim says well my
[1:39:07] God's alive he's living in my
[1:39:09] heart well I know he's alive because he
[1:39:12] makes me feel good the Muslim says well
[1:39:15] our God's Alive he makes me feel good
[1:39:19] well I know he's alive because all of us
[1:39:20] gather from around the world and there's
[1:39:21] such a a people that are so supportive
[1:39:24] of the ministry well our Gods alive
[1:39:26] people gather around the world matter of
[1:39:28] fact they're the greatest prayer
[1:39:29] warriors that there are daylight the
[1:39:32] dark they get up every morning before
[1:39:33] most of us even get out of bed and
[1:39:35] praying see so that that can't be it
[1:39:38] said well what would you do to prove it
[1:39:40] you would find him in the power of his
[1:39:44] resurrection it isn't just to know that
[1:39:46] he resurrected but it's to see him in
[1:39:48] the power of the Resurrection but in
[1:39:50] other words Jesus said whenever they
[1:39:51] came to him and they were they were
[1:39:53] going to Stone him he said Don't Judge
[1:39:55] Me for for what I say he said but the
[1:39:58] works that I do see you say you're the
[1:40:01] Son of God he said but what works but
[1:40:02] look at the works that I've done are
[1:40:04] they not the very prophecy fulfilled is
[1:40:07] it not God is it not the same work of
[1:40:09] God is it not the Fulfillment of
[1:40:11] scripture isn't it something you said
[1:40:12] well brother man how would we prove it
[1:40:14] there ain't but one way to prove it is
[1:40:15] to see him manifested in the power of
[1:40:17] his resurrection that's what the
[1:40:19] ministry of William brandham done it
[1:40:21] proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:40:24] it didn't prove William brandom it
[1:40:26] proved the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:40:28] it was a man that had dedicated friends
[1:40:30] this is all free this morning but but it
[1:40:32] was a man that had dedicated his life to
[1:40:34] proving Jesus Christ to say I'm not here
[1:40:37] to build a church I'm not putting my
[1:40:38] name on I'm not trying to make a
[1:40:40] denomination I'm trying trying to make a
[1:40:42] church of me I'm not trying to get y'all
[1:40:43] to all follow after me but look to Jesus
[1:40:46] Christ he's alive and well he's here in
[1:40:48] the power of his resurrection and he's
[1:40:49] not out there in that the denominational
[1:40:51] system that that men have made and all
[1:40:53] this Seminary knowledge that men have
[1:40:54] built up he's here just like he was in
[1:40:56] the book of Acts when people went down
[1:40:58] in the upper room and they prayed and
[1:41:00] they got their heart and one mind and
[1:41:01] one Accord until the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:03] fell upon them and they became one with
[1:41:05] him he's the same God here today amen do
