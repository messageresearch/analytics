Lord to come and minister to us if you have a need this morning just lift your hand to the Lord I know he's mindful of what we have need of and certainly certainly more than able amen so let's just

name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning we just want to invite you to the scripture to the Book of Joshua and we'll read out of the sixth chapter and we'll reading the first verse and we'll also then read from Joshua the 2 chapter in the first verse I want to before we uh uh get out of the service without remembering but brother Ben puit uh is having their annual meetings up in Hardy uh starting on Thursday night and so uh that service is at 7:00 and us all to attend the meeting I know we take a lot of people down there each year just to be a support and and and this wonderful Ministry it's always been a good meeting and to be a part of and brothers there just coming together in unity and and just appreciate that he sent us out an invitation so anytime we're invited i' like to extend the invitation to the church so uh we just want to remember that coming up but I want to read uh Joshua the 6th chapter and the first verse and the Bible says now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and I'd also like to read out of Joshua the 2 chapter and we'll read from the first verse the Bible says and Joshua the son of nun sent out of shum two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and they came into an harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there and it was the Lord it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight to of the children of Israel to search out the country and the king of Jericho said unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that have come to thee which are entered into thine house for they come to search out all of the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but I wish not where they where they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out and whether the men went I don't know but pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fors and soon they which pursued after them were gone out and they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon on us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when he came out of Egypt and what he did unto the kingdom or the kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan Sahan and OG and whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath now now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning and I would like to speak on a cord of Salvation now I know that here we are living in this age and you know of course we see some uh the crazy things that goes on in our world today and and and you know yesterday it wasn't just something that happened uh uh yesterday evening but things that that have been going on it's an evil place that we live and evil times and and I realize that we are living in a time of judgment the Bible tells us this is this is the days of judgment it's the last days it's the end time it's the time of rapture and uh any Bible student knows that God will bring judgment on this world it's not a uh it's an unrepented World by the the desire of the world they have a desire to sin and a desire uh a desire to uh to to not repent and and because of that that God would bring destruction upon the world and and I realized that God but also through His prophets and through his word he always told us that before there would come judgment there would always come a warning and so you can go all the way back into Genesis the 19th Chapter and you'll find when God had first destroyed Sodom and gomorra that before God destroyed Sodom that he sent Angels into Sodom and he took out lot and all that belonged to to lot and his family and the Bible said whenever the the fire was about to fall in Sodom that the angel came to lot and he said Escape for thy life and look not behind thee don't stay in the plain escape to the mountain unless thou be consumed and be uh so so God always warns in the days of Eli and the days of the prophet Samuel when God would bring judgment upon Eli for his for his son's uh uh actions that were never corrected in the Lord but before God brought destruction he sent the prophet Samuel in there and he said to Israel he said the thing which I do this day every ear will tingle he said in that day I will perform against Eli all the things that I have spoken concerning his house and when I begin I will also make an end for I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not in the days of Nineveh whenever God would destroy Nineveh he sent a Prophet by the name of Jonah into Nineveh to to warn Nineveh that there was an oncoming judgment if they didn't repent in the days of of the Prophet Jeremiah then when when God would come to Israel he sent Jeremiah and in and when Babylon had came and they had took over Israel when God spoke to Jeremiah he said now look at Jerusalem and you realize there's no inhabitants in Jerusalem it's a desolate place it's been destroyed the the great things that were growing there and the people that were living there none of it none of it's there any longer he said and if you wonder why it was because of their wickedness which they committed they provoked me to anger they want to burn incense to other gods and they knew uh that that they knew not to do it and neither them or their fathers but how be it here's why God destroyed it he said I sent unto you all my servants the prophets they rose up early and I sent them and I saido not do this abom abominable thing that I hate but they hearken not nor inclin their ear to turn from their wickedness and they burned incense unto other God so we see that anytime in the scripture that there's judgment that comes upon a place that judgment is preceded by a warning from God so God he's a just God he's a god of Mercy he's a god of Grace he's a long-suffering God and and so God would continue to to offer to offer this and so we we see that in this time of Jericho in the days of Joshua and Rahab that here here Jericho had received a sentence from God a judgment for their wickedness and for hundreds of years that God had warned them and turned to turn back to God these were a people that had turned away from God so not only uh the did was it was it just judgment but in the days when Joshua brought the army of Israel to the doors of Jericho it was a it was a fulfillment of the promise of judgment but but it wasn't just a fulfillment of a promise of judgment but brother Mark it was also a fulfillment of a promise to the Seed of Abraham that this land would be given to them so when Joshua's Army is standing at the wall of Jericho it's a two-fold purpose of God one in that God was going to bring judgment on Jericho and two that the land that they inhabited belonged to the children of Israel so it was a promise under the seed of God and so you know I thought when I just read this this morning that here in this land of Jericho I thought this is such a wonderful thing and I I I know you've heard this but here there was a there was a woman by the name of Rahab the Bible called her a harlot she was an illame woman and I thought this is such a powerful Tye because in this land of Jericho that judgment was coming upon there was a gentile woman how many knows Rahab she was a gentile and and so in the middle of this land where judgment was promised was a little Gentile girl that was trapped in this place it wasn't she didn't get there by choice she was just born in the middle of it it wasn't something she decided to be a part of she was rais raised up in it she was brought up in it she was in a condition that she had no way out of I thought that's how we were born into this world brother Wesley we didn't we didn't choose the world that we were born in we didn't choose the condition and the the things that the world would be doing and the things that were going on but we were born in a world that had already received a promise of the Judgment of God but in this world there was this little Gentile bride that had been that she had been pass from one Church to another and one uh one belief to another and one denomination over to another and she would continue to be passed along and searching what was she searching for she was searching for something that would sustain her she was searching just a way to to to have another meal a way to be able to feed her family and just something to to prevent starvation so she would about go through anything in order to uh to pay the price just to be able to make it another day and but I thought here in this condition that she was in that and and maybe it just seemed hopeless and there would never be a way out and there would never be an opportunity and she's always just going to be in this same situ situation and God had just neglected her and he just left her there and you know she she couldn't help her how he's ever looked at your situation said but I didn't do anything to get here what did I do wrong to cause to cause this and where did I mess up to cause this but you realize it had nothing to do with her it wasn't her fault it wasn't nothing she had done it wasn't a mistake she had made it wasn't punishment or or anything like that because in her heart there was something different in her heart she didn't even want to be in the condition that she was in she longed for a way to get out of it and and you know I thought as as as this judgment would begin to build and I I'm sure the pressure around Jericho begin to build up as they begin to feel the pressure of the army of Israel as they were moving across the land and and day after day here there were Caravans that would arrive in Jericho with news that that the army of Joshua was on its way and I could just see with every Wagon Train that came in weary Travelers that would come by and say but there's an army coming there there's this great Army they're coming across the Wilderness you remember the story of when they when they come across the Red Sea some 40 years ago and how that God parted the waters and that Army Coss that same Army and they're just down the road and they're on their way heading in this direction I thought my here as these rumors be begin to come and The Travelers begin to share rumors friends let me tell you those rumors began to build faith in the heart of a woman named Rahab and let me tell you what you know why why it was special to me cuz it didn't matter who said it what matter was who heard it and here she was a girl that was predestinated of God the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and here the faith of God came riding into Jericho with every rumor I thought my here they would come into town and you know what happened brother Mah is that Faith mounted the words of heathen unbelievers as they come into Jericho and they begin to speak and and they would come into this city and that Faith rode right into the heart of a Woman by the name of Rahab and and and with every rumor her faith be to grow and with every rumor there she she be to to see something else and maybe there was an opportunity there and with every rumor she realized that there was a power that was greater than Jericho this very thing that had held her down this thing that had held her in bondage this thing that kept her from being what God had called her to be but there she she started believing that maybe just maybe there's a power that's greater than my bondage maybe there's a power that's greater than my condition maybe there's a power that's greater than my past and greater than my nature and greater than what was handed down for my father and my mother may there's something that's just greater and opportunity be to rise in her heart I thought my that's the way it is but said she wasn't put there on purpose it it wasn't something that she done she didn't even want that way of life it was her parents that put her in it just like many of us today we've been caught up in situations and you you was raised up in conditions and you picked up spirits and and all kinds of religious spirits and alcohol spirits and and and and and anger spirits and and tempers and things that we picked up from from those that come from before us but but but it it just seems like we're in a condition with no foreseeable way out and you know sometimes when you get so bad off can I just preach to a minute sometimes you get so bad off that you think that the Judgment of God might just be a welcomed relief either one way he'll take me out or another way he'll save me but just bring on the Judgment CU I have no way to get out of the condition I was in this is where the heart of Rahab was but with every Caravan brother marah Faith begin to build and she started to see there was a possibility of an opportunity that something could change in her life what if Joshua could bring a Brave New World what if this Army of Israel could come in and and bring a new government and change the way that things are in in in Jericho and maybe they'll they'll they'll make a crops that's a little better and maybe maybe they'll know how to run this place a little better and maybe I could it could be a a little bit better off but friends you realize that there was nothing she she she didn't really realize the power that Joshua actually had because Joshua the Bible would tell us that Joshua he was a type of the Holy Ghost and he had a commission brother Wesley to come into this into this place to bring judgment on a city whatever he would speak it would be done if he judged it it'd be judged if he gave it Grace it would be given Grace He was ordered with a commission from God that whatever Joshua spoke what happened in the land of Jericho do you realize that God gave oh friends I'm I'm preaching to you that God gave his Prophet the ability he gave he gave this Holy Ghost he gave him the ability to bind whatever you bind on Earth will be B found in heaven whatever you loose on Earth will be loose in heaven and he set him loose on this land of Jericho and he came to the walls and begin to speak I thought my the the power of life and death was in his tongue and when it came you realize how helpless she must have felt that no matter what they done they could not stop the Judgment of God friends let me tell you a secret there's no way to stop it there's no way to that you can stop the Judgment of God you you can escape the Judgment of God but you certainly can't stop it see judgment was coming I thought how little she must have felt there are our people are greatly afraid our our people they've heard about you and you know it's just a a terrible thing and and she knew they were coming she met the spies that came to spy out the land but she couldn't stop it and how it must have feel that that that that you know the Judgment of God's coming and there ain't nothing you can do about it and people that will be lost and there's nothing you can do about it and there's no you can't change their situation and you can't make them Believers and you you can't make them turn to God and it don't matter how hard you try or how how much you preach they they just look at you and go go their own way it just don't have any effect on them I realize brother Mark that we're just powerless to stop the Judgment of God I know the people to the world today they don't believe that but let me tell you a little secret this morning that just because you don't believe it certainly ain't going to stop it your unbelief will not stop God's judgment your prayer won't stop God's judgment you can fast till you starve to death you'll never stop God's judgment Satan and his angels are according to the Bible will be burned in a lake of fire and all of those that are partakers of the kingdom of Satan will be burned with him you can't stop the Judgment of God I know what the world's doing today is the world that's taking this and turned and says I'll tell you what we'll do we'll avoid the Judgment of God and we'll just put judgment on the word of God so what they'll do is they just come to judge the word and say well that ain't true there's too many churches that preach too many different things there's too many beliefs there's too many there's too many doctrines and they they try to discredit try to discredit the word of God and they they'll build up beliefs and all these things just to discredit that God even exists you know I thought he isn't it silly that the creation would judge the Creator here the thing that God made would come back and say well let me judge the one that made me and tell you if he's really there and tell you friends let me tell you you got two choices either you believe what the what the science says is that there was a great big bang that came and we all came from nothing and it's there was no meaning behind it it was a total coincidence it was an accident that happened in the universe some millions of years ago that created life form or you can believe that God created the Heaven and the Earth ain't but two beliefs you can pick one or you can pick the other but let me tell you they say well it was a big bang and and it was a great big noise I say friends maybe it was a big bang I think it might have made a big noise when God said let there be light it might have been a big noise when God took an earth that was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and he took it in his hands and he formed it into a world and he took chaos and he formed it into order I imagine it made quite a racket when the light of God sprung out Across the Universe and breathed life into a in into a dead lifeless thing it was a big it may have been a big b I know what the world says see the if you ever study some science can I just preach a minute y'all go ahead and preach with me if you ever study some science the UN they say the universe is only five things it's time energy space matter and motion that's what the universe is made up of so everything that we are consists of time time energy which is a power so a time there has to be a power source there has to be space there has to be matter and motion you take that out and there ain't nothing exist I thought well my y'all are so close to the truth but you realize that everything that the Universe has and everything that there is to make it you don't even have to read the whole Bible to find it brother Mark it's found in the first two verses the Bible says in Genesis the first chapter in the beginning what was it talking about time in the beginning God created do you want to find a source of power well there's the source of power it was God creating by the power of the spoken word he created what the heavens the space and Earth the matter you say well brother Matt that's all of them but what about the motion there has to be motion to make a universe the Bible said the Earth was without form it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so there you have it it's time energy space matter and motion it wasn't an accident it it wasn't a coincidence it was the power of the spoken word of a living God that is a reality today he spoke this world I say how wonderful are the works of God it was created by the voice of God he made every mountain and he made the sea he made the forest he made the stream he made the Lakes he made the rivers he made the fish he made every creature Great and Small he made everything and for everything God had a purpose I say how wonderful are his Works David said God created the god the Creator he oh I love can I just tell tell it like David told it I feel like preaching this morning David said God the Creator he wrapped himself in light and he wore it like a garment that's our God his clouds are chariots and he walks on the wings of the wind he makes his Angel Spirits his ministers as flames of fire he laid the foundations of the earth that they could never fall he took the waters that was over the mountains he receded them into the valleys and he set a boundary to keep them where they are and the water flows in the valleys and the springs and the rivers and it comes for a purpose to feed the wild animals and so just so they can have a drink everything that God made brother Mark everything that we see it was God that made it and every bit of it had a purpose the waters even on the Hills they' bring forth fruit he made grass for the cattle sap for the tree tree for the for the birds he made day for work and night for rest how wonderful are your Works David says how wonderful are your Works he said I'll sing of the the Lord as long as I live and I will praise my God while I have a being I wonder for somebody like David here this morning it says I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live as long as I have a being I'll give Praises unto my God I'm not an accident hello somebody the worst thing you can tell a kid is you're an accident we ain't no accident we ain't accidentally here we ain't some we ain't some some accident that happened but we were purposed by God when God called you he formed you he told Jeremiah I knew you when I formed you and before I formed you in your mother's womb he knew what color hair You' have he knew what color eyes you would have he knew he knew how pretty and how ugly every one of us said be it was God that knew us he made us and he made us for his purpose friends how dare that we judge the word of God we don't have the right to judge the word it's the word that judges us I'm just going to get straight here the Bible says that God would the the word of God listen this Bible brother Mark the word of God it's the power of God to them that believe it and will accept it it may just be some some book that's been translated a bunch of times to some people in this world there's been all kinds of translations it may not mean nothing to them but to me it's still God's word it's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever prophet of God said he's Dy Bound by his word he must stand by it because it's his word and God must judge the world but if God is going to judge the world how can he judge it he can't judge it by a church can you imagine if God took one man's church or another the church said well I'm going to judge the whole world by the Baptist well then everybody else will be lost I'll judge the whole world by the Catholic well everybody else will be lost I'll judge the whole world by the Pentecostal everybody else will be lost God can't use a church to judge the world he said I won't it wasn't a church that he promised he didn't promise to judge it by a church but he will judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word Jesus said If any man hear my words and believe not I don't judge him but I come to judge the world I come not to judge the world but I come to save the world but he that rejects me and will not receive my word he has one that judgeth him for the word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day see so it ain't the church that God's using it ain't your church my church the church down the road it ain't a church that God's using to judge the world it's the word of God which is Christ Jesus that God will use to judge the world friends you realize that's what we need this morning and that's that's why we have a pull pit is to take people back to the word of God it's it's to take people to an ad abolute something that you can anchor your soul in but the Jared that you know that when the Judgment of God comes that you have something to look to I thought my here a lot of people live out most of their lives they never have an absolute but that's what we need this morning we need a thorough Vindication of the word of God we need a real experience with God to be able to believe that God's word is true that it came out of the mouth of God it's been tampered with it's been tainted it's been resp spoken it's been it's been reprogrammed every which way you can but I thank God that there's still a spirit in the land today that would turn the heart of the children of God back to the original faith and say my word is the truth get back to the word of God get back to the Bible get back to the original creation when God said let there be get back to thus sayith the Lord again it's God calling his church back to a Vindication of the word of God see before you can fulfill Oh Glory I feel like preaching before you can fulfill a commission you realize that here even Moses who was a man of God he was called of God he was a servant of God but he was a he was a man that was a runaway servant he was he was he was doing everything he could to avoid doing what God wanted him to do maybe some of you are that way here maybe you're a runaway servant of God maybe you've been running for a long time and you said I know that God's draw at me every time I come in the house of God God speaks to me every time I allow him a minute he's poured at my he's pulling at my heart he's drawing me and he's pulling at my family but but I can't help but there's something else in me there's a there's a law of the flesh has draw me away from God here was Moses brother Mark he was a God's prophet he was a man that God would speak lip to ear with but even Moses would run from the presence of God he was a runaway you know what God does to every runaway he said all that belongs to me will come to me you know what he did he went out there he wouldn't meet him in the city he wouldn't meet him at the gates Moses wouldn't give God enough time to deal with him Moses I I'll just go out in the wilderness and he ran away and he when he got out there in the middle of the wilderness one day he was walking and up on the mountain there was a fire that was burning on a bush and he said what an odd thing that the fire is burning but the bush is not consumed and it draw Moses up on a mountain friends don't you realize that's what God is trying to do today he's got a pillar of fire that's been held over the people of God he's saying it it's something that when you see it it'll draw you to it brother Tom it draws you out of the out of the valley it draws you out of your condition to come and have a meeting with God right when he came to this place God said Moses what do you have in your hand well I I got a little old stick he said throw it on the ground he threw it on the ground it became a serpent he said now pick it up when he picked it up it became a stick again he said what was it it was God giving Moses an absolute it was a Moses this whole time he knew he was chosen for it but he just didn't have an absolute but whenever God done that he gave him a Vindication of the absolute see when he giv him this brother Mark it removed the question you realize that's what the purpose of the message was it was to remove the question of God's absolute it was for God to come and vindicate that all the things that he's told in this Bible that they were true in the middle of 2024 that we' hadn't look back and say well that's just something of history and that's just a god of history and God don't do that kind of stuff no more but it was sent as a Vindication of the very absolute that God had already sent oh let me tell you friends in that absolute when it got in the hand of Moses it became a rod of judgment over Egypt here a prophet of God he took an absolute and he went he went that was Vindicated by God and he went into Egypt and he set his people free that's what we need this morning we need an absolute you need God to vindicate the word to you in order in order for something that you can establish your life on I remember can I just tell this story I remember brother B telling this story one time of how that he would remember he had a had this this this uh the dream or a vision that he had of a snake that was trying to kill one of his friends and he he tells it like this he said you know he said I spoke to it and and it and it and it and it consumed itself and it went away went up in a blue smoke he said but whenever I I woke up he said I looked up and there was this little there was this thing this evil thing over in the corner of my bedroom and it was sitting there mocking him and and making fun of him and he said it just started saying and saying well you you ain't nothing it was just Old Demon Spirit speaking you have no no power with God and you're just a bluff and you have you have no power he said but I said Satan you're an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ he said I laid there in a little bit in the bed and I started to raise up and I felt this little Spirit come by this sweet Spirit he said I wonder if the spirit of the Lord is near now he said this sweetest voice that I've ever heard I I ever heard in my life it said Don't Fear to go anywhere or fear to do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go said that settled it for me it it didn't let them rage I've got an absolute I've got an anchor that holds Yonder because it's the word of the Living God he said if you ain't got that kind of absolute that's what we need this morning I want something that'll punctuate the word of God and I can see the word of God made manifest I wonder how many have that request this morning God give me an absolute that'll cause me to to punctuate God's word and to see it made manifest I thought what a tie This Is Not only would he punctuate it but that absolute it'll cause you to back the word or get behind God's word and it'll cause that word to come to pass in your life I was preaching on it Wednesday night on manifesting God's purpose you realize it brother Mark that you just backing God's word and getting behind the word of God it causes the blessing of God to come upon you that ain't that ain't brother match blessing that's the that's the law of God it come out of the book of Deuteronomy he said out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every matter be established so we need an absolute brother Mark that could get behind the word we need an absolute that would cause us to support something you realize that all the work and the effort that you're doing in your life let me ask you for what purpose are you doing it are you doing it to build a bigger house are we doing it to have another car are we doing it to have in a few years there ain't none of it going to matter in a few years you'll meet God one way or another and you'll have to answer to God and say well that all that all that I done did it have any purpose but we need an absolute something that we can build our life around that has purpose something that has meaning that that would fulfill that emptiness that's inside of you that's always been there no matter what you've ever done no matter what job you've ever had no matter who you married or where you've been there's still an emptiness in there what is it it's a place that God is longing to F that you could fulfill the purpose that God has for your life we need an absolute you said well what is it it's the holy spirit it's the spirit of God he said that Spirit you don't have to worry about it it'll only cause you to back the word of God it won't make you say Amen to some manmade Creed or something like that but the Holy Spirit it'll lead you the right way it'll get behind the word of God and notice here's what was happening when these two spies come to Jericho brother Mark when they come to this place now just can I just tell this as a story here when they when they came into this place that that that Rahab of course the Bible would tell us that she was a a harlot and that she was raised in in this in this place you know she brother dramatized this says you know you know maybe she was maybe she was poor and she didn't have anything and her parents you know or old crippled daddy or something that she was out there working and just trying an ill- Fame woman just trying to make a way for their family this little girl that grew up in the streets of Jericho and tried to make a living there was no way for her to work as as a girl in those days they didn't they didn't go work for money most of them just worked around the house and in Homemakers and so and they didn't have the ability but she went out and just trying to do something to provide for her family but I can imagine that the whole time that she knew what she was doing was wrong there was something in her that told her that it wasn't right to do it there was something in her that longed for something else this this is isn't who I want to be and this this isn't the kind of person that I want to be but I know that God is calling me to something greater but one day she heard that there was a God that was moving and in her heart it began to tremble brother marah and you know what brother M says she found a Messer from that great move that told her what was going to take place she she got the Feeling what was going on in the land in this age of judgment but but in her heart began to tremble she realized that that there was things that were things were shook up that was UNS ESS there was uncertainty in the world so she found a messenger from that great move and he told her what was going to take place he said and notice that Rahab she didn't even ask to see a sign from Joshua you know what she done she was a I oh I love this huh she he says she was a type of the church a type of the true church she's been pulled away into all kinds of prostitution one day she was a Methodist the next day she was a Baptist the next day she was a presbyterian the next day she was something else people are pulled from one thing to another and they're never drawn to God She was drawn into every kind of system that there was but one day she met a messenger that came from the move of God and he told her that God is coming he'll judge that thing that's been built up that thing that's brought death to so many that that old that old mystery Babylon that you call that that has brought destruction that that vile creature that was made by by Satan himself that would that would deceive the very people of God but she heard a a word from the move of God from a messenger that a move is going to take place said she was the type of the church but all of a sudden a little preacher enters into the City and says there's a God that lives that's it on he lived yesterday and he's the same today and his power is yet the same and he does the same works that he did when he was here on the earth and friends his agents are on the road today my is't that something it took a little preacher a couple preachers to come by our house and to say the same you you realize what she told the preachers she told them she said I've heard of your God over when he brought y'all out of Egypt and he rolled back to Red Sea I've heard of your God when you came in and he took that that whole nation of kings and y'all didn't even have the ability to do it I've heard of your God how Mighty he is but you know what they did Brother marah they didn't leave God in the past they didn't leave him at the Red Sea they didn't leave him at at the kings that they had taken he said he's the same God today he's the same he's moving into Jericho he'll bring judgment Upon This land and and if you want to be saved then you better turn to God they brought her they brought God out of history and preached it in her house said see now Rahab she was a known Harlot she was the type of the believer today she was a real believer and she didn't say I hear that Joshua can do signs because he's the successor of Moses so I'd like to see those signs isn't that the way people tell you today when you go telling them about the word of God and all and and God being well show me a sign that God's real take this crippled person and raise him up and show me that God's still heal say friends let me tell tell you I've seen a crippled person that was 6 years that was paralyzed that got up in the middle of a meeting and came to the front of the meeting walking I've seen people that were blind that their eyes were open I've seen people that were dead that God gave them back their life you come too late to tell me that God ain't a Healer and God God ain't still real and he ain't doing the same things that he's always done he's still God but never did I approach God and say God if you'll show me that then I'll believe you I was a Believer before God ever done any of it I was a Believer before I ever saw God move in a miraculous way I was a Believer before I ever saw the pillar of fire I was a Believer before I ever saw the miracles of god I was already a Believer said that's the way Rahab was she didn't ask to see those signs she said we didn't have to see those I I think this is so good he said why she didn't ask to see him is because Moses when he had SE when he had signs he went and performed the signs but there was a reason why Moses performed the signs because he was Vindicated as a prophet of God so God gave the signs to Moses to vindicate the commission that Moses had he said but the sign isn't what took him into the promised land what makes me want to dance all over this building but a mark it wasn't the sign that let him over it wasn't the sign that took him in it wasn't a sign that c that that caused them to be able to have their inheritance he said see it wasn't the sign was only a Vindication of the commission I think that's what people need to hear today they're still looking for a sign men standing in their pull pits trying to trying to to mimic a prophet of God and trying to do the same things he done and act like he act and talk like he talked and produce the same sign but there ain't going to be another sign given there's a sign that's given to a generation to vindicate the commission of Moses the prophet of God and when Joshua came it wasn't a sign that took him in anyway I know this is may be much but it's the truth the sign ain't what took them in brother Wesley why are we looking for signs before we worship God yeah we looking if I seen a cloud on the wall I'd be a real believer then if I seen the pillar fire up there oh I'd come to church different then I'd have my hands raised I'd stand on my feet when the preacher's preaching I'd say Amen I'd shout Glory if i' just seen a sign why are we looking for signs anyway so the sign was sent to vindicate Moses but the sign ain't what took him in the promised land you notice she never asked for that she said she believed it without seeing anything she believed what they were and here them spies brother Mark when the men came looking for him she hit him she said I pray I swear you by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me now listen I want to make a point and give me a true token listen a Scarlet this scarlet cord that they came out of the window with they told her you hang it in your window and when death strikes there'll be life in this house when judgment strikes Jericho there'll be life in the house of Rahab you you realize that brother Mark when she hid those Messengers MERS they ask her what do you want you realize what they're asking they're asking her to open the desire of her heart to them what is it that you long for what is it that you desire what is it that you want here brother Mark but when they would ask her this she said I want my family saved I want you to show me give me a true token but notice brother Jared what she didn't know is that to have a token was already a promise of God when they came out of Egypt here she was asking for something and she didn't even know that her request had already been a promise of God you remember when Moses come out of Egypt and the Death Angel would come come upon Egypt that Moses that God told him he said but you take the sacrifice and put the blood on the door and when I see the blood I will pass over you so to her when the death angel came to to Israel and or to Egypt and and all the firstborn were killed the death angel came through the land and it went right by every house that had the blood on display it was a token the the Bible says it was a memorial for God to know to pass by it he says see so whenever she when she asked for this and they asked her when what is your desire she begins to speak the desire of her heart I want a true token he said but notice that when she asked for a desire or she told her desire then the men of God were able to tell her that that ain't just a desire but that's actually a promise of God oh friends let me tell you something you don't talking about changing your faith but when your desire becomes a promise it changes the way you you look at things when your desire becomes a promise it changes the way you see your future or you can say well brother man I have a desire to receive the Holy Ghost well friends I'm here to tell you it ain't just a desire it's a promise of God and through the prophet Joel you said I have a desire to be healed it ain't just a desire it's a promise of God he said by my stripes they are healed I got a desire to see my children saved it ain't just a desire it's a promise of God David said Delight thyself in the Lord and He Shall give you the desire desires of your heart you desire something but Mark where did that Godly desire come from it came from God oh friends but tell you whenever your desire turns to a promise when a that that promise of God it can't lie it's the promise made by God he said he made a promise by two immutable things one that God can't lie and it's God that made the promise to you and it can't change when your desire brother Mark when your desire becomes a promise you're looking out different window amen now you're looking out rahab's window when the Judgment of of Israel came walking around the walls of Jericho out of every window they were trembling out of every window they were shaken and they were in the fear of judgment but when Rahab looked out and she saw the army of God she didn't see them as judgment she saw him as a promise of Salvation no longer when you're looking out rahab's window brother Jared or you're looking at judgment but you're looking at the Salvation of God let me ask you that this morning what do you see when you look out the window what do you see when you look at the World Fallen apart and the destruction and the wars and the rumors of wars and the promise of oncoming judgment do you see judgment and fear and Chaos or do you see the salvation of the Lord you see when her desire became promised it changed the way she saw it her desire it became promised she when she heard judgment she heard those old footsteps I could just see Rahab sister Lillian as she would hear the Army begin to March around the walls of Jericho and all all the maybe everybody get a little shook up in the house but she' go over to the window and check and make sure that that cord was still there you know after a little while they the old place started rumbling and walls started falling down and all around her house every I don't even think the house of Rahab even shook I think when the walls fell down the foundations of it didn't even Shake that's the power of God but it stayed there the Bible says her house was upon the wall and the walls fell down flat but whenever the walls Begin to Fall with the Tom she'd go look out make sure that cord was still there my brother Mark it was it was a different window her desire became salvation she realized that whenever this Begin to Fall the pressure all the things begin to build up she had a promise of God let me tell you what that I can just hear those preachers I got just a minute I can just hear those preachers when they're talking to her and she says I heard about your God and what he did when he come out of Egypt I could just hear him saying oh it was it was more than that let me tell you let me tell you exactly what God Said have you ever I know you've heard a rumor and I I know you've kind of heard some hearsay but can we tell you exactly what God said when he came down there when God came to Egypt or or to Israel he said unto them he said I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite the firstborn but then he said but in the blood he said but you'll take the gods of Egypt I'll execute my judgment Fring the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you or destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt oh they just wanted to let her know how God really worded it I can imagine one of them oh one of the other ones said just break it down for a little bit more oh listen what God Said in verse 12 he said when it comes to the land of Egypt I will pass through the land of Egypt but when it comes to the believer he said I will pass over her I said oh my it's God that when he comes through judgment May sweep through the land it may lay every stone upon the ground where there ain't a stone left upon a stone but when it comes to the people of God he said I will pass over her let me tell you friends the Judgment of God is passed over you you say brother M how would it do it because she had a token from God that was displayed it was a representation of the blood of the Covenant of God but the mark that the enemy or that the Judgment of God could not even strike her life butam said there it was applied it was the blood of the Lord Jesus it was made a scarlet cord what a type it is for us he said it was a blood it it was a it it was a type of the blood of Jesus and she hung it out of her window but notice that when she displayed it she displayed it publicly this is what God's asking for told her you you do you believe that God is God enough that had she not hung the cord out her window that she could have still been saved how many believes that how many believes it took a cord for God to save her house how many thinks it had to be a rope hanging out a window for God to have the power to keep her house from falling fall down when all the rest of them fell down around it God didn't need the cord but he done it for a sign said listen what is he showing us that there was there would be a token of blood that that that God would hang over us and notice he asked her to display it publicly why would God tell her to display it publicly he could have done it just because of what changed in her heart but he asked her to display it publicly but Mark you know why because for her whole entire lie there had been a sign that was hanging on her door and I don't have to explain to you what it said but but God asked her whenever something changed in her heart the sign changed I could see this woman when she went out and said I'm not going to be that what I came out of but God promised to save me I've been trying to get out this long enough I'm tired of being an alcoholic I'm tired of being a Harley I'm tired of being in this condition I don't want to be in it no more and she kicked the old sign down and took the sign that God told her to hang and hung it out her window he said what did she do she displayed it publicly to let that old world know the people that saw what's the matter with her there's something something different let me tell you what's matter there's something different hanging out rahab's window this morning it ain't the same sign she ain't the same woman she ain't the person you used to know but she's got something on display in her life it's a new creation it's a brand new man it's a person that God took and he changed their life from the inside out and now they're displaying the very life of Jesus Christ he displayed it pugging no wonder that we dress in Holiness you want to wonder where that came from because God requires you display it publicly Bo are dress and the way we Act and the way we present ourselves to the world that we live in it's a sign of God being displayed to the world it's the very Covenant of the blood of Jesus Christ it's a sign of Holiness it's on display to let the world know that the old sign ain't hanging on this window anymore but I have a new sign on display and I want it to be made public this morning that God has came into my house and he's gave me a true token that in the days of judgment that I'll be spared she she displayed it publicly so that's the way the blood has got to be displayed it's got to be hanging on the outside of the wall that's the way it was in Egypt that's the way it was in rahab's house and that's the way it is for me and you it's got to be hung on the outside to show that on the inside something has been taking place that's the way the True Believer is in Christ this morning on the outside is the display of the blood of the Lord Jesus have you ever thought about that the way you live your life on the outside is the display of the blood of the Lord Jesus there they're looking for a sign of God they're looking for a sign of the Resurrection they're looking for a sign that God is real but do you realize that when you walk around in this world that it's the blood of Jesus that is on display the grace of God that could take a life that was lost a person that's this heart was black and evil thoughts that was in their mind continually hatred and bitterness and envy and all these things that come with it but then God would come and change the heart said what happens we put a different sign on display to show that something has taken place on the inside said and when through this God looked down when the Wrath fell and the trumpets begin to blow and God seen that scarlet cord hanging there as a memorial let me tell Oh Glory to God but Xavier God didn't see listen he didn't he didn't see her as a harlot he didn't see her as a failure he didn't see her mistakes he's seen a scarlet cord he didn't see her past he didn't see all the the things that she had gone through and the people that had been in her house and all the the filth that had gone on he seen a scarlet cord brother said and it pleased him to pass over the blood my isn't that something it pleased him to pass over the blood said it always pleases God to pass over the blood he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you you see that cord brother Mark it was Grace in a time of judgment believe it brother and it pleases God to give Mercy isn't that something it pleased him to pass over you it pleased him to pass judgment over your house and and to pass by in the time it pleased God to give Grace to your life it pleased God to give Mercy to you it's pleasing we're so worried about our our flesh and all of our mistakes and how can we be pleasing to God said but it's pleasing to God to pass over the blood it's pleasing to him to see our to to not see our failures and to just see the blood it's pleasing to God to not peer into your heart and see all the Blackness and all your mistakes and your can can you see that with me this morning it's pleasing to God to not look into your past and and to bring all that stuff back up it's pleasing to God brother Mark to look at your life and to just pass over the blood that's on display it pleases him he said he sees the token on display in your life I I know that people say Well it that token it represented Christ but can I look at it just a little deeper just a minute can I have a minute just a little deeper to see not only brother Mark did was it Christ but notice what she had actually accepted see when those men came they brought a message to her telling her what was about to take place and something in her heart caused her to believe the message that was brought see so she Vindicated that she had now when the message came that but now many say well I believe it I some say I do some say I don't but it doesn't matter what they say but she Vindicated that she believed it not because of what she said brother Jared but she Vindicated it by what she put on display see when they told her when you hang the Scarlet Court out your window it'll bring Salvation to your household she Vindicated that she believed that message because she put it on display you realize that brother wesy so so her promise it came out of the mouth of a messenger she in her house would be saved I I wasn't there to hear him brother Mark I didn't hear what they told her I just read about it but I know one thing's for certain that she believed it you say how do you know she believed it because she displayed it you say well that how do I know I believe the message God sent today well it'll be on display in your life right if it was the same way for Rahab it was the same way they were in the in the days of Egypt it's the same same way today whenever God sends a message to his people how do you know that you believe the message will you'll take the message that God sent and put it on display in your life the sign will be different the th that that scarlet cord will be hanging out the window brother Mark it's the blood of Jesus Christ that is hanging over our life and when judgment came to that City let me tell you what happened she was safely hidden away she protected and she supported the men of God she she took the word that God sent her she accepted the message as a way out of her condition see that's what happens today that when God sends a message to your house he's looking for somebody that'll get behind it when he sends Joshua he sends the Holy Ghost to this place he's looking for somebody that'll get behind what the messenger said and that's what she done she said I believe what you're saying I believe your God is a God I believe he's a deliverer I believe he's the real God I believe he's the creator of the Heaven and the earth I believe that judgment's coming and I believe that he'll save me and my family and Joshua said to them he said the city shall be cursed all that are in it will be cursed to the Lord but only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are with her in her house because she hid The Messengers that we sent my isn't that something brother Mark that Scarlet core that was bound out her window was a protection for her house but said it was a protection for her because she received the message that God sent and she when she received it brother the mark she displayed it and it protected her said you you see that she was such a type of the Gentile church when they heard the message we were all out there and all these things and spiritual fornications against the god of Heaven all the things but whenever we heard that there was a God that still lived that could still perform Miracles quickly we received the message when we heard that there was a God that still lived then quickly we believed it when we heard that there was a God that still can then quickly we believed it when we heard there was a God that could still heal the sick we believed him when we heard there was a God that could still raise the dead we believed it we didn't go looking for some proof of it we just believed it when we heard of it he said listen when she quit quickly believed it and she quickly received the message I thought my this is the way our God is when we heard it how many when they heard it they believed it when you heard that God can can raise the dead how many say I believe it when you hear that God can heal the sick how many say I believe it when you hear that God can deliver somebody of some substance abuse you say I believe it when you hear that God can take a temper off a man that you say I believe it why we heard it and we believe the the the mouth of God so when we believe it that's what God's looking for he's already a God that can he's just looking for a people that will he's looking for a people that'll stand behind the word of God he's looking for a people that will accept his word that'll get behind the word that'll surrender to him the people that will accept the token of God and put it on display in their life as a music players would come that's what God's looking for this morning he's looking for a people that will he's a God that can needing a people that will amen let me tell you how he was introduced but the mark the Bible says the first time Jesus was introduced to this world when he came John said he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world look how he's introduced a man that could take away sin when he comes into this world no long no longer it wasn't that he was that sin was taken out of the world brother Mark but Satan's kingdom is still full of sin but he took the headship of sin off of every believer he took the bondage of sin away from you that you could freely display the token of Jesus Christ Paul said know this our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed henceforth we should not serve sin in other word we're not a he that is dead is freed from it we don't a servant means one that attends to or gives respect to a superior he said but we no longer serve sin in other words it's no longer our Superior it's no longer our headship it no longer governs your life Paul said but when you're dead in Christ see to be to serve sin would be to accept its Authority but when Christ came he took away its Authority he took the power of sin away the influence of sin out of our life where John could write it he said he that committeth sins of the devil for the devil sined from the beginning but for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and whoever is born of God does not commit sin for God's seed remaineth in him I is't that something Brother David you can't even do it it was the source of power that Satan held over our lives sin in order in order to remove it you said well what would God have to do well you'd have to take the power away from it said well where's its power can I tell you where the power is the power of sin the Bible says is the strength of sin is in the law so when Christ came realize the power that sin held over you was in the law that God made he said but when Christ came Romans 8:2 that the the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death the very thing that had you bound said but God sent a new law and it made you free from it we died to our flesh we surrendered to God he said then don't let sin Reign Over you any longer don't let it rule over you as a king over your life I know we we think we're big men and women but we're being ruled Whom Shall you serve I remember the words of Joshua when he said that he said as for me in my house we will serve the Lord I say don't let sin rule over you as a king that you would obey the lust of it but do as Paul said he said sin shall not have dominion over you see it's a desire I wonder if you just bow your heads with me this morning maybe there's somebody say brother Matt I have a desire to take that out of my life I have a desire ire to be free from sin I have a desire in my heart it it's deep down in there somewhere God bless you brother sister Lord bless you being honest I have a desire in my heart to be freed from sin but friends but when the desire becomes a promise it changes the view Paul said sin shall not have dominion over you for you're no longer under the law but you're under grace it's a promise of God and now being made free from sin you become Servants of God don't go back to Servant sin but serve God friends your desire is a promise of God the very thing that's on your heart say Lord I I just want to be right with God I want to find my place I want to find my purpose what has God for me in this life you know we I I don't know your life many of you been been from many places lived in other states and countries and places that you've been and came from and things you've gone through but God knows and he knows that in your heart there's been a longing and desire to serve God maybe as a Young Man whenever it was it was burning it was on fire and there was something there but because of what people have done and maybe people have said maybe even ministers things that have taken place that would cause you to lose faith in the very God that created you but you realize that today that God would send a messenger to speak to your heart and to say What is your desire there's the Judgment that's coming to this world said but I'll spare all those that believe what's the desire of your heart brother man I don't want to serve sin I want to serve the Lord said whenever Joshua came to her notice this she didn't go back to her old life she reached out and she took a hold of the promise of God and she believed it I wonder how many as you stand to your feet tonight or this morning you say brother Matt I want to that's what I want to do I want to display the promise of God maybe just lift your hands say Lord let me put it on display this morning God the very change that you made in my life let me let me display it let me let me as I as I speak to you this morning God let that token of the blood of Jesus Christ be displayed in my life gracious Heavenly Father Lord as you see our hands this morning God lifted unto you God the very desire of our heart Lord God is to display a true token Lord to display the that scarlet cord Lord that of Salvation that youve sent to us and God that you have taken us and chosen us and forgiven us and Lord that you would look over our lives and our failures and our past and God that you would see something greater Lord you would see the desire of our heart and the promise that you made God and you'd bring it together this morning Lord you see everyone Lord God you know every need God I pray Lord that your mercy had overshadow this place this morning God as your word has gone forth Lord maybe there would be somebody here that don't know you God that have a desire to give their heart to you this morning God that would hear a simple message that would go out but Lord they would recognize it as a voice of God not looking for some great sign but just to believe believe the message that you sent God I ask you Lord that you would hear their prayer Lord that you would speak to their heart this morning you would receive our our our request in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I've been changed [Music] free delivered in our found joy peace and and favor

blood of Jesus Christ displaying the token of God Amen we just want to ask this morning if somebody would would have on their heart to come and stand with with us um Joyce had asked for prayer for Bethany little I know yall know her come and sing for so many times and made the CD and and done all that she can ever since she's been a little girl to serve the Lord and and she's been really bad sick over the past few uh weeks maybe even months and a lot of don't really have a way to see what it is all is going on but um last night took a real bad turn and just ask that that that anybody that would come and stand with us for her and I believe that God will honor our request as a body of Believers that we have a right to stand for those that are in trouble and there's a daughter of God that's in trouble and her heart goes out to her this morning just ask the Lord that he would come and touch heren let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord you see our sister Lord little Bethany and God in a great need this morning God I know that you've told us Lord in your word that we had a right as a body of Believers to call upon you you told us when there was a time of trouble Lord that we could turn to you and that you would be there to help us and Lord I see this enemy Lord that has attacked this girl's body and Lord that it would cause so much fear and uneasiness Lord and Lord and questions that would surrounded but God we just ask you Lord this morning as a church body Lord as we come together Lord we ask you Lord that you wouldd go to where she is Lord there laying in a bed God that you would take her and Lord that you would you would know the source of the problem Lord you know all things Lord you're the one that made us you're the Creator God

wonderful works this morning God we ask you Lord that that very testimony Lord would find the heart of this little girl this young lady God I pray Lord that the very sickness that's attacked her body Lord that it would take its leave God that you would send the the spirit of God Lord that that you would touch your body Lord God you would raise her up from this condition Lord let her rise up as a testimony Lord let her sing like she's never sung before God let her stand upon Thy word Lord let her be a testimony to the Bride of Jesus Christ to the power of God that can take a hold of a life Lord we're Believers Lord and we're calling upon Thy Name Lord we bind the spirit Lord that's attacked her body Lord we bind that enemy Lord that would attack her try to keep her from being able to stand and do what you called her to do Lord we bind it this morning God we ask you Lord now to take it and deliver Lord and God that the testimony would come back you're a miracle working God lord and

possible for Jesus is he Jesus is he Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is amen you believe that how many Believers we have here I believe that God is more than able brother Mar he changed us let me tell you what happens when God changes something in your heart you become a different person I watched that young man Xavier standing there when he was about 13 14 years old Lord began to deal with his life you know what brother the mark after a few years he he he done like all the rest of us do and he ran from the Lord but I watched a few months ago when God got a hold of him and any of you that's near to him knows this is a fact that he's not the same man that he used to be when God gets a hold of you it changes who you are and I tell him I'm proud of you for standing upon the word of God I'm proud of you for taking a stand upon on God's word in the face of adversity and friends that would forsake you make fun of you and mock you that You' stand for truth that's that's a God sent man those are God called men that'll stand on God's word you ain't the same man that you used to be let me tell you what the Bible says when when that when Rahab came out of her house brother Mark she didn't go back to being a harlot Brother David she didn't go back to the old life but that little what they called a harlot she went out and she met a Jewish Prince and she gave her heart to him something that she had never done she'd gave her body away but she' never gave her heart to anybody and she gave her heart to this Jewish Prince said they went back and he took his bride back to Bethlehem a settling down place to live where there was plenty of bread and through this great Romance and her Obedience of Faith they brought forth Boaz from one child generation to the next all the way down to Joseph the man that would look over and raise the baby and the boy Jesus Christ isn't it something that God would take aive and use it for such a great purpose friends you may have been using it for something else but you let the Lord get a hold of you this morning it'll change what you use your life for said it changed her what a what a romance that's what's happened to us this morning for the market it's a great Romance of a Jewish prince and a gentile bride Christ Jesus here when we were unworthy but he comeing he called us out of this condition here when we had built up all kinds of walls and denominations and systems and religious beliefs to keep people away from him but he came through all of it he tore down every wall and he found us right in our condition and we're never going back to that again he called you out by your own name I love what Joshua said he said go in and take every man it's all been cursed except the house of Rahab can you imagine that she was an unknown human nobody knew who she was an ill- fign woman there ain't nobody in the world she had she had no reputation of great but the greatest man that walked on Earth in those days knew her name when he walked in he said go by the way of rahab's house and bring her and all of her house out everything else is cursed but everything she has is blessed isn't it something when the Holy Ghost knows your name that he can go into your house and Brother David in the middle of the night when everything's all mixed up and he can call you out by name but the man he knew knew you when you didn't know him and when you had no desire to serve him but he knew you friends let me tell you it matters for God to know your name for the joob Salvation [Music] of love because [Music] he and he Pur my
