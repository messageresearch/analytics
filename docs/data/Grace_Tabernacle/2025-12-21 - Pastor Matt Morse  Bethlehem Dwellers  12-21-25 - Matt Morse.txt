How many love the Lord? Just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Want to welcome everybody here this morning and all the home folks, visitors alike. Just trust that the Lord would speak to you this morning. And amen. just a privilege to be in the house of the Lord. I I thank thank each one of you for coming and allowing us to speak to you and just be able to speak what's on on my heart this morning. And I know God is mindful of everything that we have need of. Amen. And he's never failed us. And I don't take this lightly. I never [music] stand before a single person to speak the word of God and in a light way. [music] But uh it's the word of life. It's the most important thing that we could ever hear and the most important decisions that we ever make are in times like these. Amen. And uh before the word of the Lord. So we just want to before we read out of the scripture, we want to bow our heads just ask the Lord to come. Remember sister Barbara requesting prayer for family [music] sickness in her family. Also Aiden sick this morning. Prayer request for Adam Rond Rondell. He was in a wreck on Friday in the ICU in Memphis Hospital. Remember him in prayer. It's from Sister Sandy. If you have a need on your heart, just lift your hand to the Lord. I know he's mindful of what we have need of. And [music] I believe we have a right as believers to approach him and to invite him on the scene this morning. So, let's just pray each one in your own way. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we love you today. Lord, we're so thankful for your presence here, Lord. How wonderful that you are, Lord. Tremendous anointing, Lord, that you've given [music] us in this hour, Lord. And God, you've just been so good [music] to us, Lord. And here, your spirit is here. And Lord, we just ask you, Lord, as we stand in your presence, Lord, and God, that you would take everything that is unlike you, Lord, and let it be moved from this place. And Lord, let us just take a moment just to surrender ourselves to you, Lord. That you could just come and speak to every heart. And Lord, that you would meet every need, every sickness, the sickness would be healed. And God, that we would leave this place, Lord. We would grow in thy word. And we would go out of this [music] building closer to you than we were when we came in. And Lord, we just ask you to anoint the word as we speak it. And we'll give you the glory for all that's done now. [music] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. For you're worthy of [singing] it all. You're worthy [singing and music] of it all. For from you are all things. To you [singing] are all [music] things. You deserve the glory. You're worthy of it all. [singing] You're worthy [music] of it all. [singing] For from you [music] are all things. To you are [singing] all things and you deserve the glory. [singing and music] Can you sing it to him with all your heart this morning? You're worthy of [singing] it all. Yes, my Lord. You're worthy of it all, [singing] my Jesus. For from you are all things. To you [singing] are all things. [music] And you deserve the glory. I say [singing and music] you're worthy of it all. Yes, my [singing and music] Lord. You're worthy of it all. [singing] Oh, from [music] you are all things. And to you are all things. and you deserve the glory. Amen. How many declare him worthy this morning? [music] Amen. We just want to give the Lord a hand clap of praise and Amen. just to come and [applause] here in the holiday season around [music] Christmas time and Lord just put a Christmas message on my heart for you this morning. So trust it be a blessing to the church and just want to invite you to the scripture to the book of Zechariah. We'll read out of the 13th chapter and we'll start in the first verse. Zechariah 13 and one. I sure enjoyed that message Wednesday night. Amen. Wasn't that wasn't that good on that throughout the week and some of the brothers testimony being planted. Amen. Amen. We all go through things. How many enjoyed that? Was here Wednesday night. Amen. just tremendous. God bless you, brother Joe, for that. And Amen. It takes a lot just to surrender to the Lord and and we sure appreciate I appreciate our ministers and appreciate our young people. Man, wasn't that wonderful? Those young kids singing and my there was a whole bunch of the little ones. And somebody told me the other day that there was nearly 70 young people in our church and which I didn't there was 25 of the older groups singing the other day and 25 or 30 of these and then I ain't no telling how many babies but there's a there's a bunch of them and but there's a there's a growing youth group and it just does my heart good to see young people on fire for the Lord and and so we just we just thank God for each one of them and but we want to read out of Zechariah the third chapter or the 13th chapter, excuse me. And we're going to read from the first verse. So, Zechariah 13 and one. And the Bible says, "In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin, and for uncleanness. And it shall come to pass in that day, sayaeth the Lord of Hosts, that I will cut off that I will thou will cut off of the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered. And also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. And we'll just ask the Lord to add his blessing to the reading of the word. And as you take your seats this morning, I would like to speak on Bethlehem dwellers. on Bethlehem dwellers here. This book of uh Zechariah, it was written a period as Hagi 500 years before Jesus uh was born on the earth. And of course, if you read of the prophecies of Zechariah, you'll find uh that that he speaks of the future of the salvation of Israel. And when you study Zechariah, there's actually two parts to the uh book of Zechariah. uh the first few chapters, I believe it's the first eight chapters, they speak of of the building or the or the restoration of the temple in in uh Jerusalem or or the rebuilding uh after they come out of that Babylonian captivity. And uh it's the restoration of the natural part of Israel. But uh when you get to the ninth chapter on on uh it's called the oracles is and so uh in the oracles Zechariah is no longer talking about the things that are going on uh presently in Israel because here he was in that time when they were rebuilding and restoring. So God used him for that restoration. But uh when it comes to the other chapters he speaks it's what's called the oracles. He's speaking of a coming uh of a messiah. So there's a there it's it's all about the Messiah or the coming of a Messiah. And the prophecies are no longer local prophecies, but they're spanning across hundreds of years or thousands of years in time. And along with Isaiah, David, the book of Daniel, uh uh many of the Old Testament prophecies, mainly Isaiah and David in Psalms, but uh but Zachchariah was also of those that prophesied of the coming of Jesus. He prophesies of his birth. He prophesies that he would be sold for uh 30 pieces of silver. He even speaks of his crucifixion, how he would be pierced with a sword or or or with a spear. And uh but in the seventh verse of the 13th chapter, Zechariah says, "Awake, oh sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, sayeth the Lord of hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered, and I will turn mine hand upon the shepherd would become a catalyst to the people returning back to the Lord." And so when you read actually when Jesus is arrested, Jesus actually says this written, I will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. So even Jesus declares that the prophecy of Zechariah is speaking of him. He so he said this night you shall be offended for what Zachchariah spoke is going to take place this night that I will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. So it's definitely a prophecy that is concerning Jesus. So we realize that this is actually what it is is what fulfilled the opening of the fountain. So when the Bible says in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David for sin and uncleanness. So we realize it's a prophecy. It's certain that it's speaking of Jesus and the smiting of the shepherd would be would bring about the opening of that fountain. Zechariah's talking about a fountain being opened. He's talking about a cleansing that is going to come to Israel. But in order for that to happen, there had to be a shepherd. and the shepherd had to be smitten and the sheep had to be scattered, but then there would come a time that they would all be brought back into this place with God. So, we realize that because this is a prophecy uh from the Lord, it speaks of cleansing. It's speaking of a purification from idolatry. And it's talking about a people coming back to God. And I I don't know if y'all was here last week, but last Sunday we were speaking on the gods of our fathers and and how easy it is to pick up these gods. How many remember that? Remember what a god is? A god was an object of worship. It's something that you worship. It It don't matter what it is. It could be an object. It could be a It It could be anything that's built with a man's hands. It could be an idol. It could be an image. It could be a picture. It could be somebody. But remember what Jesus said? He said, "God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." But friends, can I tell you something this morning just to be plain with you? That although God is a spirit, do you know that God is not the only spirit? But there's other spirits beside God. So I can say it like this this morning, but yet Satan is a spirit. And they that worship him worship him also in spirit. And it ain't in truth. It may be in the spirit of error, but people worship Satan in spirit just like they worship God in spirit. They get attached to spirits. They worship spirits. They make idols out of these spirits. They they become the rulers over their lives. and and because of our nature and because of humanity and our desire to worship and because we build up these idols and there had to come a cleansing that would cast away the idols of worship out of our life, the gods of our fathers, the things that we picked up throughout our life. There has to come a cleansing in our life that we can cast away people over at the house. But I remember one day when when the when the the dishes was piled up all over the they were in the sink, they were on the they were on the table. They were on the counter and and it was just a big mess. So, mom mom was gone and me and Mark, we had this great idea. We're going to be good Samaritans. We're going to help mom out and and so we got all the dishes and we got a little wagon and we loaded them all up in the wagon. We took them all in the bathroom, filled the bathtub up with water and and and we we got our little sister's bassinet, her little baby bassinet and we brought it in there, set it by the bathtub and and and boy, we just put every dish. It was the best place, wasn't it, Mark CI? Because the the sink wouldn't hold the dishes, but the bathtub, it was a bigger basin. And and so we filled it full for a little while. You know you what we there and of course we don't see what mom sees. We just seen the dishes and the and what we did. Mom seen a mess. I can't imagine. I mean we in the wagon. The wagon had mud on the wheels. It it it was a it was a mess in mom's side. And so so e even though we were washing she she got really up upset at us. And we couldn't figure out we were we were kids. We couldn't figure out why mom was upset. And and uh but but what we didn't realize as children is we didn't realize that conditioner didn't have the ability to take pork chop grease off of a ceramic plate. And so mom knew this. She knew that no matter how much conditioner that you put on it, it wasn't ever going to clean it. And it it didn't matter how it didn't matter how you know how many times you scrubbed it, it wasn't going to turn. It's not an agent that has the ability to remove grease. And so we had quite a moment of understanding with mom about how to wash dishes. And we earned some dish duty and how how to do it properly because we wanted to help. And so uh from that day forward, we knew how to do dishes, didn't we? We and we we sure wasn't afraid to get up there and do the dishes. That's a free one for mom and dad. But but but but we but we learned a little bit about cleansing the the alkalion metals on the periodic table of elements over on the left hand side, three or four down. And so you take sodium and hydrogen and oxygen, they mixed it together and it formed this compound called lie. But in chem class, you would take the lie and mix it with an oil. And when with oil, it would there I forget the uh the name of the process, but the process that occurred, it formed a chemical reaction. It became soap. In other words, it would sud up. It would make suds when you mixed it with water. But with that oil and it became that that agent, it actually created what science calls a lifting agent. And so because so now it's a soap, it had the ability to separate dirt from the oils of the body. that. So that's why they they made up this live soap and you know you when you put it on the body it has the power to do what water by itself can't do. See you can take water all day and you can wash it in water and there's a lot of people that's been washed in water. Preach somebody there. You can take water all day and you can wash them in the water and you can bury them in water and you can dip them in all the water. You can sprinkle them in water. But there has to be an agent that would get a hold of the dirt that would remove the dirt from a body. See it takes more than water. But I say this this morning that just as there was a cleansing agent in the natural that God has made a cleansing agent in the spiritual and the Bible said and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. You know that tells me that the blood of Jesus is a cleansing agent. It has the ability to do something that water can't do. It can take dirt from your skin. It can take dirt from your life. It can take dirt from your past. all the things that you've been born in and drugged through and out in the mud in the dirt of sin, the filth of this world. But that cleansing agent called the blood of Jesus Christ has the ability to remove the dirt of this life out of your life and cleanse you and set you aside whole on the other side. Oh friends, let me tell you, it's a cleansing agent. It ain't something you can buy in a store. You can't go down to the church bookstore and buy it. You can't go down to the Bible bookstore and get it. But there ain't but one place. It's a David. The Bible said there is a fountain that is open. I say it's a fountain filled with blood. It's drawn from Emanuel's veins. And when the sinners plunge beneath the beneath the flood, they lose all their guilty stains. It's a fountain that's filled with blood. It's an inexhaustible fountain. And listen what David said about this fountain. He said it's opened unto the house of David. &gt;&gt; Now think about this house of David. You realize promise here. David was sitting as a king of Israel. I just want to read this to you out of the scripture. The Bible said, "It came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all of his enemies, that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, see now I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the Lord dwelleth within the curtains." And Nathan said unto him, "Go do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee." And it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan saying, "Go tell my servant David." So here David has on his heart to build something for the Lord. And God comes that night to the prophet Nathan and gives a message to David. How many remembers what the message was? He said they he said that that thus sayeth the Lord, shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in? Have I not dwelt in any house since the time I was brought you up out of Israel and out of Egypt? I walk in a tent and a tabernacle. Was there ever a time that I ever asked for a cedar house? Was there ever a time that I asked for you to build me this in such a way? He said, "But thou shalt say unto my servant David that that that I brought you from following uh from the sheep coat and from following the sheep and to be a ruler over my people of Israel. I was with you wherever you went. I've cut you off from your enemies, out of thy sight. I've made thee thy great name like unto the great men that are in thee. Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more. Here's here's what God is is settling in David's heart that I am going to plant a place that my children can inhabit that they don't have to move no more. I'm going to give them a permanent dwelling place. I won't have to move no more. And neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as before. And as since that time I commanded judges over the people of Israel, I've caused you to rest from thine enemies. Also the Lord tellth him that I will make thee that he will make thee a house. And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with thy fathers. I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be proceed out of thy boughs, and I will establish his kingdom. And he shall build a house, speaking to David. And he shall build a house for my name, and will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. and I will be his father and he shall be my son. And if he commit iniquity, I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men. But my mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it away from Saul. But whom what a promise from God. Yeah, you may fall like Saul did, and you may make mistakes like Saul did, and you may have iniquity just like Saul did. But unlike Saul, I will never remove my mercy away from you. I'm going to build a house that cannot be destroyed. I'm going to build a house that will not fail. And you'll live in it, but your iniquity, you may get in trouble. You may be chasened as I would chasen men, but my mercy will never leave you. &gt;&gt; In thy house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee, and thy throne shall be established forever. So here God gives this promise unto David that he has a a a throne that would be there forever. So the house of David is established. But when you read in the history about the house of David, according to the Hebrew Bible, David and his house, they were appointed by God to rule over all of Israel. This is what God promises him. You're going to rule over all of Israel. But but if you ever look up the term what he's speaking of when he speaks of Israel, he's actually speaking of the United Kingdom of Israel. Now, how many knows that whenever David had became king that it included the tribe of Judah, which is which was in the south. That's where David's uh home territory was. That's where that's where Jerusalem was. That's where he came into power. But it also included the 10 northern tribes of Israel, which is where Saul ruled before David took over his kingdom. So Saul ruled over these 10 these 10 tribes. And David here that come from Judah. But when David became the king of Israel, it became a united kingdom. It was no longer divided. So his rulership or dominionship was over the entire kingdom. But you notice as you read through history, you'll find out that after the death of David's son Solomon, that the tribes of is Israel, they split from that united kingdom. And then Rahoboam, which took over Judah, uh the house of David, that's the only part of it that he ruled over. Uh he had his capital in Jerusalem, but all the other 10 uh tribes, they were they had other kings that was raised up. So here, as God had given this promise that he would rule over it all, but just short time through history, it's no longer together. It separated Raboam's only only ruling over a certain part. But then in the then come that Babylonian war and the destruction of Jerusalem and they exiled the the remaining Davidic kings and now Jehoken and Zedekiah they were taken out of there and it actually ended the dynasty of King David. So, so you realize that that even though God had made this promise to David, when you and this kingdom would be established forever, but when you read through history, it wasn't just a few years through history, the kingdom was divided. It was torn apart. Jerusalem was torn down. Babylon had taken over. The kings had been exiled. And no longer was there a dividic king in the throne of Israel. So, it looks like it ended. And brother Mark, in the natural, it did end. But the problem is is the prophecy was still there. See, if you only looked at that in the natural, you'd say, "Well, well, then Zechariah's prophecy didn't come to pass." But his prophecy was still there. He said, "Thy house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee, and thy throne shall be established forever." Even though it looked like it was over, but when you read about the house of David, you have to realize that the house of David didn't end with David's natural lineage. It wasn't just talking about David in the natural, but the house of David in the scripture is referring to King David's dynasty that was established by God and promising an eternal rule through David's descendants. But whenever it was fulfilled, it wasn't fulfilled in David or or Jehokin or or these other kings, but it was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. So, it was the promise of a Messiah who fulfilled the lineage to bring a peace upon the earth. So you realize it wasn't just a physical house, but brother Charles, it was it was God's chosen royal line. It wasn't just the physical lineage of David or the bloodline of David, but it was God's chosen royal line. That's why when you read of the birth of Jesus, it includes the lineage of David. Remember in Luke the first chapter, the Bible said, "And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouseed to a man named Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came into her and said, "Hail Mary, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation it should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. And behold, you shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus, and he shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the Highest. and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. So here we realize that it was not the ending of David's lineage when the natural fell apart, but the Bible said he shall give unto Christ unto his throne f of his father David and he shall reign that the dynasty of David or the lineage of David uh the descendant of King David that would that would that would go go through David that was forming this royal bloodline. But you realize that that bloodline of the house of David when David was born or or became king then the bloodline of the prophecy of Zechariah came to pass. You real you realize he was speaking a bloodline into existence. He was he was talking about a bloodline that was coming through the through the king David. And when that prophecy went forth, there was a bloodline that came out of David that carried on this this physical bloodline into Israel. But that physical bloodline, brother Mark, it died in and Zedekiah. Oh, but I thank God this morning that that wasn't the end of the bloodline. See, there was another bloodline that was greater than the natural. It's greater than a natural birth. Brother David Paul's greater than a natural seed. See, brother Bam said, "We find in Israel when they were compared with Moab how that they stayed true and the bloodline was true." He said, "But we find out there that Moab was illegitimate. They were all fundamental just the same as Israel was. But Israel who had the true bloodline and signs and wonders following them, they had a brass serpent. They had divine healing. They had a shout of a king in their camp. They had a smitten rock for their salvation. So here's talking about how that the bloodline was there before David was even there. Before David was even before king this bloodline that was that that that the prophet was prophesying of is something that was lo that was there long before David ever took office. He said they had a heavenly father that fed them from above. They were having a glorious time. They weren't yolked up. They were an interdenominational group of people just floating around and they were people making fun of them because they wasn't a nation. They was a scattered people. I wonder how many say amen to that. They kind of pick on you because you don't belong to a big group or or pick on you because you don't belong to a certain organization or or you don't have a a founding fathers or founding members over your door. He said, "But here it is. I hope you get it." They were headed for their homeland. A perfect type of the true church today. Headed for their homeland, wandering about in sheep skins and goat skins. They were destitute. He said, "But we are looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. And that's the way the true church is moving today, brother Mark, because we're led by another bloodline. We're not of the bloodline of the natural lineage of Israel. We're not of the bloodline of the natural lineage of David, but and therefore because we're not of that bloodline, we're not bound by denominational rule. Hello, somebody. We're not bound by the attacks on our church. We're not bound by the attacks on the message. We're not I'm not bound by I don't care what people say on the outside because I'm a part of a royal bloodline. I know where I came from and I know where I'm going and I know the blood that is flowing through the veins of every believer. It's a spiritual bloodline that was sent from the cross of Calvary. Sunday offering. I don't care what they say. I heard a guy say the other day, he said, "Every time you prove these message believers wrong," he said, "they just stand up and say, "Well, that's fine. I believe it anyway." I thought, "Hallelujah. It don't matter what you say to them because there's something on the inside of them that causes them to be a believer." You said, "How do you know you believe the message?" Can I just tell you this morning? Because I believe that we're living in Leoa. Hello, somebody. I believe that we're living in a rapture age. I believe we're living in the end time. I believe in laying hands on the sick and they recover. I believe in divine healing. I believe in the supernatural. I don't believe Eve ate an apple. I DO. BUT I DO BELIEVE IN holiness and I believe that women ought to be women and men ought to be men. I believe in election. I believe in divine appointment. I believe in predestination. I BELIEVE IN THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. I BELIEVE IN EPHESIANS THE FOURTH CHAPTER. I DON'T BELIEVE JUST PART OF IT. I BELIEVE ALL OF IT. I BELIEVE GOD SENT PASTORS AND TEACHERS AND EVANGELISTS AND AND APOSTLES AND PROPHETS UNDER THE LAND. I'M A BELIEVER. YOU SAY, "WHY DO YOU BELIEVE IT?" BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO. WHY ARE YOU A MESSAGE BELIEVER? CUZ THE BIBLE SAYS SO. I'M NOT BOUND by a denomination or bound by some church creed, but I I'm of a different bloodline. &gt;&gt; You're attacking the wrong thing. Let me just tell you out there, you're attacking the wrong thing. You say, "Well, you know, Brother Brandham lied about this or the they lied about this." But let me tell you, when you try to tell a message believer, you're running a fool's errand. You can waste your time all you want to. You can call me a fanatic if you want to, but let me tell you, don't you ever associate God called believers. I know what they do. They just attack. Well, look what he did. I know what they do. They just attack. Well, look what he did over here. And you know, he was just a man. And one time he told a story and I may as well just preach. But one time he told a story and there was 400. Next time he told it there was 600. And they took put them side by side. See, he lied because one day he said 400, one day he said 600. I hope y'all don't ever hear me tell a story &gt;&gt; how many people got baptized in India. I don't know how many it was to this day, but I remember it was a bunch. And if you want to go back and find the first time I ever told it, you might find out the real number. But because I'm human and the weakness of humanity, sometimes I think it was 30 and sometimes I think it was 50. I don't always remember because I'm a human. So when you attack THE WEAKNESS OF A PERSON'S HUMANITY, don't think that that causes me as a believer to be discouraged. Matter of fact, the more flaws that you point out, the more faith I have. &gt;&gt; You know why it gives me faith? It's because it gives me faith in my own experience because it proves that God can use somebody with mistakes and God can use somebody with failures and God can use somebody that's flesh and God can use SOMEBODY THAT FORGETS JUST LIKE I DO. AND IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME HOW MUCH YOU forgot and how much he TOLD SOMETHING WRONG, I SAY, "THANK GOD BECAUSE I DO IT ALL THE TIME." BUT THAT MEANS GOD CAN STILL USE SOMEBODY LIKE me because I'm a part of a different bloodline. Therefore, I'm a believer. But said, "The one who made the line of blood." Listen, this is the bloodline we're a part of. He made the line of blood all the way from Pilot's judgment hall to Galatha. That's the line that we stand in. It's the bloodline of the Lord Jesus. That's how we gain faith. That's how we gain power. That's how we defeat the devil. We That's how you look at the devil and say you're nothing but a deceiver. You have no legal rights to hold anything over a Christian. &gt;&gt; He once had you bound, but now he's bound. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a part of a different bloodline. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a bloodline. You belong to God. You're God's property. Abraham said, "In the beginning was the word." This is a scripture. The the word was with God. The word was God. And and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld him in the glory of the father. You see, we beheld the word that was in the beginning. It become flesh on earth. What a marvelous thing to think that God made flesh to take away sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God made himself flesh &gt;&gt; to take away sin. And through the bloodline, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; it wasn't David, &gt;&gt; but through the bloodline, David was a type of Christ, but through the bloodline of that flesh, hallelujah, that through the bloodline of that flesh, that dynasty, that lineage, the royal blood of God, you and I have been made clean. &gt;&gt; That's why David said, listen what God said. He said, David, your house, somebody say, your house &gt;&gt; will be established forever. &gt;&gt; That ought to make every believer shout this morning. Your house shall be established forever. Talking about Christ. Your house shall be established forever. In your kingdom, there would never be an end. It was a promise that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. See, it was the hope of a Messiah. But just like any house, you realize that this house of David, it also had a key. It wasn't a squatter's house. &gt;&gt; Not just anybody can dwell in the house of David. It ain't It ain't a squatter's house. It had a key. It had a locked door. It required a key. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, there there's nothing in this life as satisfying as it must be. But said, "But you will find the sum of total perfection is in one place. It's in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not in no man. It's not in no man's ministry. The only place you'll ever find perfection is in one man. It's Jesus Christ." For the Bible said, "He hath the key of David." What a beautiful phrase it is. It comes from the preceding phrase. He is true. He's Christ. He's the perfect realization. And and contrasted from a partial realization, he's the perfect realization. Here it is. Moses was a prophet of God, but Jesus, like unto Moses, was the prophet of God. David was a man after God's own heart. He was a king of Israel. But Jesus was the greater David. He was a greater Moses. He was a greater David. He was a greater than Solomon. So, see, he was a greater David. He was a king of kings. He was the Lord of Lord. He was God himself. And David, see, he was born of the tribe of Judah out of no whom no priest came, but he ate the shoeb bread reserved for priests. He was a great warrior. Think about David. He overcame his enemy, established the people. He he he set as a king upon the throne. But yet, he was a prophet. He prophesied of things. And so, he was a wonderful type of Christ. Here's what the Bible said. Isaiah 22 said, "And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder." See, there's a key to this house. And it's found in in Isaiah. In the key of the house of David, I will lay upon his shoulder. So, he shall open and none shall shut. And he shall shut and none shall open. So it shows us that there's only one person that has access to open and shut the door of the house of David. There ain't but one person that can let you in or let you out. There ain't one person that can take you in or take you out. So he says, see the spirit used this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus. Now this is speaking out of the book of Revelation. John writes this how that that the key was upon his shoulder. He talked about that he held the key of the house of David. So said, see, but this is it's using the Old Testament reference. What the key of David signified at the time is just a mere shadow. It was now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands in the book of Revelation. And it's speaking of our Lord after his resurrection and not during his earthly pilgrimage. So this is very important because we're not living in the age of Jesus's earthly pilgrimage. Are you with me? We're living in the time after his resurrection. So it's speaking of a time after his resurrection, Brother David. after his resurrection. Notice he said, "What does this key signify?" Well, the answer of it lies in where the key was found. It's the position of the key. He said, "Notice the key was not found in his hand. It was not worn around his neck. It wasn't placed in the hands of other men." But or the verse or the verse couldn't say that he alone has the use of the key. For he alone opens and he alone shuts. And no man has that right but Jesus himself. Isn't that right? Jesus himself is the only one that has a right. said, "But notice, but where is the key?" It wasn't found in his hand. It wasn't in his pocket. It wasn't worn around his neck. But the Bible says, "But the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder." See, see? So, isn't that an odd thing to say that the key is laying on his shoulder? Why would the key to the house of David be laying on the shoulder of one? He said, "But the answer comes in Isaiah 9:6. The answer comes from this. The government shall be upon his shoulder." Says, "What does it mean? The answer, the government shall be upon his shoulder." It comes from that eastern wedding tradition of how that the bride would come down the aisle and she was veiled when she come to the uh to the marriage ceremony. But when she came to the groom that she actually removed the veil from her face, what covered her face and she put it on the shoulder of the groom which represented her coming under headship of the groom or or being subject to the groom under under his headship. And so so this is the the government shall be upon his shoulder. He says see so this is the best part. He says, "So whenever the bride comes down to the groom, notice what takes place now. The groom bears the responsibility and the care and he and he alone." That means no one else. He and he alone. No other man, no other power has any right or responsibility to her. And that is the key of David. So here it shows that Christ, he holds the key. That means, oh hallelujah, that means God being sovereign. Brother Mark, he knew by divine decree who would be in his bride. Abraham said he chose her. She did not choose him. He called her. She did not come on her own. He died for her. He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for her. She belongs to him and to him alone. She is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation because her veil has been placed upon his shoulder. The key to the house has been put upon his shoulder. In other words, I give the authority of my life over to Jesus Christ. I GIVE MY CHOICES AND MY THOUGHTS and my FEELINGS AND ALL MY ALL ALL MY PLANS. I PUT THEM ON THE SHOULDER OF JESUS CHRIST. HE SAID he is her head. For Christ is the head of the church. Just like Sarah called Abraham Lord. Even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord and when he speaks she obeys him for he is her delight. &gt;&gt; He holds the key to the house of David. Somebody say amen. He reigns in the house of David. Somebody say amen. He holds the key. It's the authority of the house. &gt;&gt; No man can enter in or go out without him. &gt;&gt; It's he that holds the key. No wonder David says, "Surely, listen what he says. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Do you realize that David wasn't wasn't speaking about a certain building. &gt;&gt; I will dwell in the house of the Lord. He was born in Bethlehem. He lived in in the caves. He lived in the wilderness of Judah, in Gath, and in Getty. He went he he he lived in the the the the wilderness of Ze. He he went to the city of Keela. Remember where the Philistines came in and he defended the people of the city just for a few months while he lived there. He lived in Hebron. He was actually anointed in Hebron to be king over Israel. But but that was his his public anointing. But but also he lived in Jerusalem. That's where he became king. And that's where he established his throne and his kingdom. It's called the city of David or the city the city of God. He he took the the city over and established that as the as as the kingdom of Israel. And so we realize that in David's life that I just want to focus on these three main places just for a minute. In David's life, there was three places that he spent the majority of his life. One, he spent his life in Bethlehem. He lived in the wilderness where he slept in caves. And then finally, he lived in Jerusalem. These are the three main places that David lived. And so, you know, you think about how that he was born, David's birthplace. He was born in Bethlehem. And in Bethlehem, David was a shepherd. See, he was a in Bethlehem he got his training. That it was in Bethlehem that David learned courage. It was in Bethlehem that he learned how to use a sling. Isn't that right? In Bethlehem, David learned how to to to shepherd a flock. In Bethlehem, he had some training. In Bethlehem, he was even anointed by the prophet Samuel to be king. Remember, that was his private anointing. Oh, I think isn't it something here that he was anointed there? All these things took place in the city of Bethlehem. But then one day in David's life, and you realize, I want you to catch the spiritual side of this, that you realize that although he was raised in Bethlehem, hello, somebody, he was raised in Bethlehem, he grew up in Bethlehem, he had his training in Bethlehem, he knew how to learn how to read his Bible in Bethlehem, he learned how to go to Sunday school in Bethlehem. He learned he learned how to sing in Bethlehem, he learned a in Bethlehem, he learned he learned how to read uh to quote the scripture in Bethlehem. HE LEARNED ALL OF THOSE things in Bethlehem. But there came a time in David's life that he couldn't just stay in Bethlehem. He had to go somewhere else. There had had to be another place that David went into. And I'll just say this tonight that the real battle didn't even take place in Bethlehem. Hello, somebody. The real battle don't play take place in Bethlehem. It ain't taking place here. It took place after he went out of Bethlehem and went out into the wilderness and he found out when he got there that his Bethlehem training, it was good. But you realize that spiritually Bethlehem wasn't enough. He had to have something that would give him a victory. But remember said it gave him a great victory one day when he seen Israel all backed up. He they were hearing these creeds and everything. They had all that they they all went to church. They had all been circumcised. Hello, somebody. I'm preaching to you. They all had creeds. They all went to church. They were all baptized. They were all circumcised. They were they all went to the priest and they got their blessing before they went into battle. But when it come to the showdown of the supernatural, every one of them were cowards because they seen something that was in opposition. You know what I found out today? It's easy to be a warrior when there ain't nobody to fight. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I said it's easy to be a fighter when there ain't nobody to fight. It's easy to be big and bad in front of a mirror. It's easy to flex in front of a mirror and look at her muscle. I think that's the way it is when people come to dad that's had the same blessing but in the middle of the battle they met an opposition AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO STAND BEFORE THE GOLIATH. I WONDER HOW many today they can stand before the Goliath in THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY MEET HIM ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH BUILDING. &gt;&gt; It takes more than that kind of exper that kind of experience. &gt;&gt; See sometimes when you get out you got to get outside the walls of the church. That's &gt;&gt; See, sometimes when you get out you got to get outside the walls of the church. That's when the devil tempts you. That's I love to come to church. It builds our faith. But then you got to get outside the walls of the church. Call us to be church members. He called us to be believers. &gt;&gt; So here this event that takes place in David's life. It was outside of Bethlehem. David, you think about here he would come he come to this place. You think of after David he was anointed to be king by Samuel and because of this great battle after he done them this huge favor then he was hunted by the king that he was serving. Remember the story he feared David because David was a threat to his monarchy. He he would be replaced by David. He he could hear him in the streets dancing and singing. Saul has killed his thousands but David killed his tens of thousands. And there was such a jealousy in Saul because of the anointing that was on David. And so he attacked him and he he went after him and he run him out and chased him out. And but because uh this anointing and this jealousy, he threatened him. He pursued him. And so he hid David, he hid from Saul. He fought the armies of the Philistines. He went out as a refuge. He he would hide out in the wilderness. But here when he was trying to survive and coming to a place of survival, he was doing everything were they were looking for a refuge of their own. The Bible says when they came to David, these were people were they were looking for a refuge of their own. The Bible says when they came to David, these were people that had been abused. They had been broken. They were bitter. They came through some that had been abused. They had been broken. They were bitter. They came through some problems. They they had problems with people. They had problems with leaders. They had problems with religious leaders and spiritual brokenness for purpose. They traded their shame for an authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in a place of brokenness, they were transformed into real men of God. &gt;&gt; This is where they found David. And in this same place, David, brother Mark, he was transformed to not only not only being anointed by Samuel or not only being a leader of sheep, but David was transformed into being a leader of men. &gt;&gt; He was transformed in the cave of Adelum. This was the another training ground in his life. It was a a place that broke. Isn't that something that we may have been raised up in one place and we got a lot of training in there, but then David goes out in the wilderness. They call it the school of hard knocks in 2025. But David goes out in the wilderness and he gets beat up a little bit and he finds himself in a refuge seeking God. And in that refuge, David became a real leader and a king and a captain over men. The Bible says as he was there in this cave of Adelum that David was then in a hold. The garrison of the Philistines was all in Bethlehem. And here David was up in this cave overlooking his homeland of Bethlehem where he grew up, where he was raised, his mom and daddy was, and the streets that he ran down when he was a little boy. And David as he set up in that place, the Bible says, David said, "Oh, that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate." See, there was a longing in David's heart as he sat there in the heat of this wilderness, in the heat of battle, in the refuge, a hiding place. They were scrging what they could for food, drinking what they could out of some old nasty bottles or something just to drink out of. is sitting there that David is is in this place and looking out of this cave of this wilderness and overlooking down in in Bethlehem and thinking, "Oh, if I could just get back to their cave, that my soul thirsts after thee." As a deer panth for the water, after the waterbrook, so does my soul thirst after thee. He cried. He was a fugitive. He had been anointed with oil. He knew he was GOING TO BE KING. THE PROPHET HAD ANOINTED HIM. BUT here in his soldiers, they were setting up there on top of this mountain. And they and be because of their sin, they were they were garrisoned by Philistines. But on that hot day, he began to write the my soul longeth for water as a deer panth for the water. In his condition, he would think about how when he was a little boy and he would come to that certain pool and all of a sudden as he was there laying up there a fugitive away from his own people, he had no PLACE TO GO AND HIS SOUL be to cry out for some of that pure water. And you know what the Bible says that some of the men, some of the servants of David that came there as cowards, came there as refugees, came there as fugitives, came there fleeing from the law and freeing from men, but but they had so became followers of David. They they had so became the followers of the anointing that David had. They they were so under that anointing that even the desire of David's heart became a command to them. David didn't have to tell him, "Go down there and get me water." He said, "Oh, if I could just have a drink of the water that's down in Bethlehem." And there was three men, the Bible says, that stood up that was of the servants of David and said, "We'll have to no matter who we have to fight on the way down and on the way back. Where's that well at?" He said it was over by the gate. Well, friends, let's go. You know what they did? They grabbed up their swords. And the Bible says they fought Philistines all the way down to the city of Bethlehem. And they went to the pool of water and they got some water for David. And they fought Philistines all the way back till they came to the cave of Adelum. And they presented their king or their future king with with a water that came from Bethlehem to fulfill the desire of his thirst or the longing that was in his heart. But when they got the water back, think about it. But when they got the water back, you know what David did with it? When they gave it to him here, he finally held that water. He looked at it how thirsty that he was and how long did he long for it and he come out of Bethlehem and they had fought their way spilled blood going down to get it. He looked at the water and he looked at the men and he looked at the blood and David couldn't bring himself to do it and so he just turned the glass to the ground and he dumped it upon the ground. Said, "God, how could I drink of this? How could I satisfy that?" But says, "See, he wouldn't even drink it. He poured it on the ground." He said because his soul was more thirsty for God than it was to satisfy the thirst of his own body. &gt;&gt; He couldn't drink it. His men couldn't. There wasn't enough for them. There wasn't enough for the next one. There wasn't enough for the next one. And David said, "I won't drink it in front of them. How be it that blood was spit spilled over it." But Ram said, "See, his soul is so long for something greater than the waters of Bethlehem." He says, "See the house of God, the soul cooling waters of Jerusalem which is above." That's what Jesus said. He said, "I am the bread of life. I am the I I am the bread of life." Is that you know what Bethlehem means, brother Mark? Bethlehem means the house of God's bread. But Ram said, "It's our church. It's our earthly church of God. It's the church that's here on earth." That's what Bethlehem is. It's the church that we go to. It's the church that's on earth. He said, "And oh, how we love to go to church here on earth. But greater is Jerusalem, which is above, which is God. Jerusalem above, which is God. Greater is that soul's thirst to be there with him than it would be just to satisfy yourself with joining a church somewhere. See, joining a church don't satisfy that thirst. David proved it there. Bethlehem wasn't enough to satisfy the thirst or the longing that was in David's soul. So, Bethlehem was type of the church and Jerusalem was a type of the supernatural or this place with God. He said, "And Bethlehem wasn't enough to satisfy his thirst because his so long TO GET TO JERUSALEM. IT'S SO LONG FOR SOMETHING GREATER. SO, SEE, David proved it when he poured the waters right out of the house of God. HE GOT THE WATERS OUT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD, BUT HE STILL YET HE poured it on the ground. And he said to find favor, to get a good cool drink from God. He said even on that, greater than the thirst that's in you is the soul thirst for God. Oh friends, I wonder how many are like David this morning and say, "Oh, I our thirst goes beyond my desire to go to church." My thirst goes beyond my desire to be a member of a church. My thirst goes beyond. Friends, I we believe in going to church. I believe in going to church, but brother said there ain't but one real church. And you don't join it. You're born into it. And you're born into it. The living God works itself through you. He makes itself known. That's where God dwells in his church because God goes to church every day. He just lives in church. He lives in you. You are his church. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle that God dwells in. You're the church of the living God yourself. Somebody raise your hand. Everybody raise your hand. Everybody raise your hand. Everybody, come on. Put your hand up. You. I'm talking about you. You are the tabernacle that God dwells in. YOU ARE HIS CHURCH. IT AIN'T A BUILDING SOMEWHERE. IT WASN'T A HOUSE OF CEDAR. GOD NEVER GOD SAID TO DAVID, "NEVER HAVE I ASKED YOU FOR A HOUSE OF CEDAR. NEVER HAVE I ASKED YOU TO BUILD ME A PLACE LIKE THAT TO DWELL IN. BUT I SHALL ESTABLISH A HOUSE THAT'LL NEVER BE THAT'LL never be torn DOWN." OH, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF THE HOUSE OF DAVID WILL STAND, AND YOU'RE THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, THEN IT DON'T MATTER WHAT THE devil does, HE CAN DESTROY YOU. HE CAN TEAR YOU DOWN. HE CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE, BUT HE'LL NEVER DESTROY THE TABERNACLE THAT GOD HAS BUILT. We ain't looking for a building with four walls to say that's my home. That may be where we come to fellowship and we ought to go to church. The Holy Ghost goes to church. But there's a real church. He said you are the church. You're the tabernacle that God dwells in. And if you are the church of the living God yourself and if the living God is living in you, then your action is of God. And if it isn't, then God isn't in there. &gt;&gt; Real simple. See, David, I'm gonna close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's more to serving God than going to church. &gt;&gt; You know why people have trouble serving God? Can I just I'm going to just be honest with you. Because your service to God never got past going to church. &gt;&gt; Your service to God never got past a struggling out of bed on a Sunday morning and struggling out on Wednesday night. People don't even do that no more. But struggle out of bed just to go to the house of God. That's the struggle. Then we go to church and go back and do all the all all the stuff that we have to do to work. But your service to GOD NEVER GOT PAST going to church. I'm a church member. I go to so and so church. I I belong to this one. I Everybody I go your your your service to God &gt;&gt; has to get beyond &gt;&gt; going to church. &gt;&gt; That ain't enough. &gt;&gt; Can I be honest? It ain't enough. &gt;&gt; It ain't enough. You have to meet God one day. And when you meet God, there's not a book of how many services you attended. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost goes to church. When the church door's open, you ought to be there. &gt;&gt; Everything in your power. You see, if you got to work under I understand sometimes, but we but we we want to go to church. We have a desire to go to church. But it ain't just to be in church. &gt;&gt; It ain't just to be in the building. &gt;&gt; Our service to God is more than going to church. All kinds of people go to church. That don't make you a Christian. &gt;&gt; Even if you go to our church, that don't make you a Christian. &gt;&gt; That don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; Just because you come to church, that don't make you a believer. Well, look how good he's going to church. Good. He's He's head. Oh. Oh, glory help me. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. He's going to church now. Look at him. He's going to church. I'm going to preach that old Pentecostals message I I heard one time stopping by the church on the way to hell. &gt;&gt; See, there's a lot of people in church that are unconverted. &gt;&gt; They're they're they're churchgoers, but they're not converts. &gt;&gt; There's more to serving God than going to church. &gt;&gt; See, David had to go beyond Bethlehem. Jesus, he was born in a manger in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; But Jesus had to go beyond Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And every true believer, they'll go beyond a Bethlehem experience. &gt;&gt; You can't just stay in a Bethlehem. You can't just stay in a a Bethlehem experience. But brother Mark, you have to move into a Jerusalem experience. &gt;&gt; See, if Jesus would have remained in Bethlehem, you know what would have happened? The Bible said that Herod found out he was there because they followed the star there. and they found out he was there and he sent men there to take the life of every boy that was about that age so that he could make sure he died. If Jesus would just remained in in Bethlehem, he would have died at two years old. &gt;&gt; If David WOULD REMAINED AT BETHLEHEM, HE WOULD HAVE DIED AND HAD NEVER BEEN A KING. I don't care how anointed he was. HE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN A KING IF HE NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT BETHLEHEM. &gt;&gt; He had to get past the Bethlehem experience and move into a Jerusalem experience. He had HE HAD TO GO BEYOND BETHLEHEM. WELL, FRIENDS, let me tell you, we can we can go to church, and we should go to church. And you need a Bethlehem, but Jesus wouldn't be Jesus wouldn't be Jesus without Bethlehem. HE HAD TO HAVE IT. YOU WOULDN'T BE A REAL CHRISTIAN WITHOUT YOUR BETHLEHEM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; GOD CALLED YOU TO THIS PLACE. And Jesus wouldn't be in Bethlehem. He He was born there in a manger. That's where the star sent the magi. They brought the gifts unto him of gold and frankincense and myrr. remember gold which meant deity, frankincense uh which meant service and myrrh which was a type of death and so said what was it? It was a deity in service for death. It was God serving for the purpose of dying. So there was a purpose of Jesus being in Bethlehem. There was a there was a purpose of David. David wouldn't be David without Bethlehem. Don't you realize that he had to have Bethlehem? It was in Bethlehem that he that he killed a lion. It was in Bethlehem that he killed a bear. It was in Bethlehem that day that that that David learned h how to be a king. He had to HAVE THAT THAT PLACE OF BETHLEHEM. IT WAS IN BETHLEHEM THAT he met the prophet Samuel. &gt;&gt; But it was in Jerusalem that David reigned as king. It was in Jerusalem that Christ reigns as king. The Bible said, "There's coming a new Jerusalem." Isn't that what John said? He said, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, AND THEY SHALL BE HIS PEOPLE, AND GOD HIMSELF SHALL BE WITH THEM, AND HE WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND HE WILL WIPE AWAY all the tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, NOR CRYING, NEITHER SHALL THERE BE ANY MORE PAIN. FOR THE FORMER THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY. &gt;&gt; OH, can I just TELL YOU THIS, FRIENDS? WHEN BETHLEHEM IS GONE, JERUSALEM STILL REMAINS. &gt;&gt; You got TO GET PAST THE BETHLEHEM EXPERIENCE AND MOVE INTO A JERUSALEM EXPERIENCE. BETHLEHEM IS TEMPORARY, BUT JERUSALEM IS FOREVER. IT'S THE HOUSE OF DAVID. IT'S THE HOUSE OF GOD. IT'S A SPIRITUAL PLACE. YOU CAN BE WITH GOD. YOU GOT TO GET BEYOND YOUR BETHLEHEM experience and have a Jerusalem experience, a heavenly walk, a supernatural life. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Right in the middle of our Bethlehem, a Jerusalem is open unto us. &gt;&gt; And what a thought this morning that here we are gathered in our Bethlehem. But it's in our Bethlehem that Jerusalem opens up. &gt;&gt; The one that holds the key, the right, we come into the house of God, into the house of God's breath. That's what this church is. You come into the house of God, but but it's Jerusalem that is opened up &gt;&gt; by the one that has the key. See, what is he doing? Abraham said, "We bypassed on creeds and drinking stagnated water from sistns. But what we need today is an opening of the word that lives." What is it? Oh, opening up a a new Jerusalem. Opening of a word that lives. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He cannot fail. It don't matter what the devil calls it. &gt;&gt; We need a supernatural experience. It ain't a It's more than church services. It's a supernatural experience. You realize there's a whole world of people that are Christians this week. &gt;&gt; It's a bunch. &gt;&gt; They're Christians this week because it's the birth date of Jesus. &gt;&gt; They're all Christians to celebrate Jesus's birthday. What a wonderful time. And I think that's the greatest birthday of any birthday of any man ever had. And if you're going to celebrate anybody's birthday, that's the birthday you should celebrate because it was the greatest birth that's ever been on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's the birth that we should celebrate. But people are so they're so they're so stuck in Bethlehem &gt;&gt; that that's their Christian experience. They can't get past Bethlehem. That's the whole of their Christian experience. But we really need to move. We got to move beyond &gt;&gt; Bethlehem. and take on this Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; You see, they don't, the world calls it a lot of things. They call you holy rulers. &gt;&gt; They call us Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; They call it fanaticism. &gt;&gt; As long as the word's flowing free and producing what God said it would do, then I'm behind it. &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "It's a fountain in the house of David again as the music players want to come." He said it's a fountain in the house of David again back in Bethlehem where that Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever to his Bethlehem dwellers live with it. They live in it. It's life jouring water for us just like Israel had. That makes you feel like David, don't it? &gt;&gt; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. I wonder how many could raise your hand as you stand to your feet this morning. Say, "I'm not just a dweller of Bethlehem. I'm not just a churchgoer. But I believe in the supernatural power of God working in the church. I'm not stuck in Bethlehem, although it's good. Bethlehem's needed. &gt;&gt; But I'm not just a Bethlehem dweller. But I've moved into another place. When that Jerusalem's opened up, that it's the place of deity. It's the place of of reigning, of kingship. John said, "I saw it as a bride adorned for her husband coming down." See, so not only will he reign there, but she'll reign there also. My isn't it wonderful to think? I believe that I believe that the house of God is more than a a Bethlehem experience. I hope you catch that this morning. I'm not knocking anything. But I believe it ought to be more than just a a churchgoing experience. I believe that being a Christian ought to be more than an Easter and Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that serving God ought to be more than coming to church on Sunday and Wednesday. &gt;&gt; And I believe the house of God still has a Jerusalem. that still has forgiveness in the house of God. There's still mercy in the house of God. There's still healing in the house of God. There's still deliverance in the house of God because Jerusalem has been opened up &gt;&gt; unto us. He said, "In the house of David, in that day there shall be a well of water springing up in the house of David." Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Oh, there [singing] is [music] a fountain with blood flows from Emmanuel's face. Where sinners plunch beneath [music] the flood, lose all [singing] their guilty [music] stains.
