in jesus name amen [Music] [Applause] all right let's go amen and see we have a testimony here this morning um brother daniel jr have a testimony brother you're welcome [Applause] god bless you saints yeah i just wanted to give president thanks to god today for all the obstacles he has saved me from and the one that he just saved me from as well again growing up i was not living the type of path in my life that i should have been living and throughout it i caught a lot of cases in my life from the cases in my life from the things that i was going about doing and through it all god gave me mercy on each and every one of them each and every one of them like i would be sitting down sometimes in jail and selling something with somebody and would be like what was your charge i'll go about explaining it to him and he'll just look at me and go like man you shouldn't even be here right now you should just went straight down for that i'll be like man it's all presents to god for real like when you really want to look at it and it's like my last case that i just recently went through it's so amazing how god worked in that situation because it's like what i got convicted for this thomas like could have really affected something that i'm on probation for in the past right now if certain things would have happened but i'm going through each and everything i'm going through and i'm asking god to please see me through the police help me through this situation and please to please help me to stay on this new path that he he has for me that i'm trying to continue to live and court's coming up so i asked god the day before court and even beforehand when i'm still praying i asked god when i go to court can he please be the judge can he please be the jury could he please be the bailiff can he please be the prosecutor the defense attorney all of them for no man's willingness to be done but his will and his will to be final so i go in there and there was a deal that i was supposed to be getting and everything seemed like that's what was supposed to happen when i went back to course i was just ready for it to be all over and this is my last case that i'm going through my last and final case so i'm just ready for it to be done i went there the defense attorney that was representing me has said that the person who i'm in the case with does not want me to get the departure that we had just came from talking about the last time a departure meaning probation so once i get probation in a sense the case is over i just have to stay law and everything is completely fine i don't have to go do any form of jail time or anything like that god given me mercy so he told me that the person who i was in the case with does not want me to go about getting the departure and that they just want me to see it through and for everything just to go about happening the way it's supposed to happen and i told them that's not what we talked about the last time like things not seeming right this this now we kept going back and forth and then he had told me you know what that is what had happened but it's like this or you could try a straight plea a straight plea is when you just plead guilty to each and every charge that you had and just leave it up to the judge to make the decision for you on how he wants to go about handling it if he wants to give you a departure or if he wants to say no and just have you see the whole entire case through and i'm over here still trying to go back and forth with the public defender and they hit me and isn't this what you've been praying about haven't you asked god to be the judge haven't you asked god to be the jury have you asked him to be the bailiff the prosecutor the defense attorney once that hit me i stopped talking to this man completely and the only words i said to him then on was you said you want me to take it straight please say yeah that would be a gosh i'm like saying no more let's go so we go inside the courtroom and we're all just sitting down while i'm sitting down i'm ready to go i'm just waiting for everything to happen the prosecutor pulls a defense attorney out and talks to him for a little bit now i i haven't said that that the prosecutor the person who he was defending had basically said that those words that the person said to him that how they would not like for me to get a departure and they want their words to be heard by the judge he said i cannot go against my client and i have to make sure that person's words are heard but i will not push towards you not getting a departure but i have to make sure that their words are heard he said that so while i told my defense attorney that oh yeah let's go do it and then he was pulled out by the prosecutor my defense attorney came back in pulled me out and said they're trying to they're trying to like ask if you're willing to take an ankle and if you take the ankle that the prosecutor himself will push towards you getting a departure as well with me and if he does that you're definitely going to get that departure ankle meaning that it's just a more serious charge if i end up messing up once again on the probation that i'm going to be getting so i told him you know what let's go and do it but you know how amazing god is it's like that same man who said i have to make sure that my client's voice is heard and it could affect me getting a departure and that he won't go against his client was the same man five minutes after i told my defense attorney let's go do it after i had thought hasn't it been something you've been praying about that god should be the judge after i told him that we went in no more less than five minutes i was pulled back outside just to be told that the prosecutor is willing to help me get a departure as well wow and through the whole entire thing never once did he ever say those words that his clients told him to say throughout the whole thing to tell you how people are used by god and they don't even realize what has happened so like i said saying that that was my last and final case and i just want to give god the glory for it to know that through it all he has shown me through and he has given me mercy and he has shown me his strength and i just thank him for it i thank you [Applause] yes we are serving the living god let us put our hands together for jesus [Music] all right um we're going to continue with the song service our song we have here i just want to give a brief history about that song it's called leaning on the everlasting amps celine on the everlasting

praise the lord amen and [Music] his dad is over in liberia he and brother deli helping the situation there so we pray that the lord will be able to go before them praise the lord amen and uh we we stop somewhere on wednesday night the lord gave us a wonderful service a wonderful blessing of his presence there was there's a sister that called me after the service and share how the law was able to minister to her and we just thanked the law for that and it was not it was now more of the preaching there was more of some of the things that she had on her heart and she was dealing with and reading through and the holy spirit coming back and uh you know and and re-echoing those things it's always a blessing praise the lord you know when the lord can come through the preaching of the word and then he can come in and bring the very thoughts that are on our heart the very things we were thinking the very things you were reading through the week and the very song that we were singing i've seen it many times here many times praise the lord many times yet i've seen that amen there's there's something i wanted to i wanted to share with us this is something that i came across many years ago many years ago and i actually actually got a copy of that it was uh something like a statistics that was written back in and i think it was written back in the uh around around uh 1993 also and and it became a very big curve and now the reason why i want to read this is to be able to help us to see some of the things that the grace of god without our effort has rescued us from praise lord amen some of the things that the grace of god has rescued us from now this statistic was actually put together i was looking at it last night and i mean it's just it's just uh too many information so i would just i would just read few of it just to use it i'm using it as a bit on the hulk so as you know me i like to fish that way so just just uh let's share this together like i said it just so many years that uh now this it picks up year with the 1993 [Music] issue divorce and out of werelock childbirth transforming the life of american children in the post-war generation more than 80 percent of children grew up in a family with two biological parents who were married to each other by 1980 only 50 percent could expect to spend their entire childhood in an intact family if current train if the current train continues less than half of all children born today will live continuously with their own mother and father throughout childhood most american children will spend several years in a single mother in a single mother family some will some will break up then intact but which may by which i mean two biological parents family an increasing number of children will experience family breakup two or even three times during childhood now this this statistics was only on america now you think about other parts of the world okay this person was just using the data on america but you think about other parts of the world i call into the growing body of social scientific evidence children in family disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in in tax family on several measure of well-being children in single-parent family are six times as likely to do poor they are also likely to stay poor longer 22 percent of children in one parent family will experience poverty during childhood for seven years or more as compared with only two percent of children in two-parent family a 1988 survey by the national center of health statistics found that children in single parent family are two or three times as likely as children in two-parent family to have emotional and behavior problems they are also more likely to drop out of high school or you know drop out of high school take uh get pregnant as teenage drugs abuse and to and and to be in trouble with the lord compare with children in a tax family children from this raw family at a much higher rates of physical or sexual abuse now the way the place is quiet i think my bed has has got a fish i've i sure think i can feel it i can feed the pool let us stand up for the reading of the word i can feed the poor i can feed the poor praise the lord i can feed the poor first corinthians chapter three we read that on uh wednesday night i will come back to that i will come back together um that we were reading a little bit and i will try to help you to see what i'm looking at like i said this is a statistics it's not the word of god okay it's not a word of god don't say amen to it don't say amen to it you should only say amen to the word of god this is just a public statistics that was gathered from different data is not the word of god it's not a divine saying praise the lord and because it's not god's word i don't expect it to come to pass in my life [Laughter] praise the lord amen it's only god's word that will not afford vowed will surely accomplish what they have said praise the lord so uh but there's a reason why and just like i said the reason why is to be able to appreciate is to be able to appreciate what the grace of god is doing in our lives amen what god's grace is doing in our life what did i say we are reading from first corinthians 3. okay first go into in chapter three uh first is that uh praise the lord let me just bear with me here i'm more nervous than you praise the lord we first read from second corinthians chapter five let's read that one first corinthians chapter three is where paul is talking about him being the master builder we read that on on wednesday night but we start up with uh we start up with uh uh paul bringing the argument that uh it's not apollos it's not paul we are just liberals is the main god that is doing the work is the lord above amen so don't put men into your view you know you know god will always use men god will use men to deliver you god will use men to persecute you he will always use man amen he will use some to encourage you he will use some to discourage you praise the lord so don't keep man in your view let's keep our eyes on the lord jesus second corinthians chapter 5 let's just read as we'll repeat this and then we will come back wherefore we liver we are labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted we may be accepted of him pleasing that word accepted there has the sense of pleasing that we are all maybe pleasing of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the thing done in his body that was our emphasis this body in uh first corinthians chapter three is the temple of god so god did not just made this body for men to go about and use their body for anything and everything this body was made because in god's mind he wanted to use this body to be able to manifest his attributes to express himself for god to express himself that's why the prophet said everything that saved god's purpose there is a resurrection that is bound to wake so that's the reason why god made this body you remember god made man in his image and man was a spirit man you know he was a spirit man just like god genesis 2 7 then man came to the dust i mean god came to the dust of the earth and then he took the dust and he mowed man and and then uh breath into man the breath of life man became a living soul but it did not stop there after a while then god put that man to a deep sleep and again he broke into the man and took up a wreck and he went into the silence and he found a woman he went into a silence he he he formed the woman out of the dust of the earth put three sacred vets you in that woman to lock up the plane of redemption because there was a plane of redemption in god's mind the lamb was slain from the foundation of the word so god formed the woman to be a weaker vessel but yet he locked out three sacred vets you in her for the plan of redemption so you see the the you know uh everything that that god gave us he he he really made us for the purpose praise the lord amen the bible says he created a man in his image and in his likeness david said all the psalmist said uh you know fearfully and wonderfully which means man was made with lot of reverence god was reverent when he was making man he was reverence when he was supporting our cells our our intestines our heart in everything everything that is the reason why the the the human body the inside of our human body i mean you can bring the tabernacle out of there you can look at the the heart the two valves that are pumping the two valves that are that are receiving you can tie the full gospel to it that's the reason why he promised to write the tables on our heart let's bow with his heavenly father we want to thank you for your presence lord and and we kind of said privilege that you will associate with us in this way father by your spirit get in the hold of our house lord i pray that god you bless the service lord as you begin you have already begin to do just come out of the pages of your word meet us lord meet us uh at the very point of our needs lord god the little ones lord father the young people oh god father even the the elders lord we pray that we all be in your hands now we are all your children are you forced to needing from you in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your sin so here paul is saying that we will all be at the judgment seat every man uh will receive the thing done in his body according to that which he have done whether good or bad now this does not have to do anything with the final judgment no this this is uh uh i call in if you said it is is is called the bema seat you know is is the seat where uh rewards are handed over and so we've been talking about rewards we've been talking about the rewards of crown looking at the different different uh rewards of crown uh in in the scripture i had this one yet in that i really did not touch the philippian chapter one uh philippians chapter four verse one let's just look at that one then we will uh digress back to what we are talking about philippians chapter 4 philippians chapter 4. philippians chapter four verse one therefore my brethren uh therefore my brethren is the la beloved and long for my joy my crown to stand fast in the lord dearly beloved okay uh let's look at first testimony in 2-9 i know there's a thought that i tied that wave and for you remember brethren's our labor and trial for labor and night and day because we will not be chargeable on to any of you that i said 219. 219 first thessalonians 2 19. for what is our hope our joy our crown of rejoicing okay that's that's the word i was looking for crown of rejoicing do you realize that god can give a man crown of rejoicing you know god can actually reward a man and gave him a crown of rejoicing and he says for what is our hope our joy our crime of rejoicing and not even here in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming now a man can have a crown of rejoicing but here paul is uh alluding to the fact that our our staying in the faith you know if we if we hold fast to the faith to the coming of the lord that would be the crown of rejoicing this is almost like you go to the book of uh first second john you hear john using this statement he says he says i rejoice to see my children walking in the truth it's a crown of rejoicing every time the apostle will come back and he will meet the people that he had preached to you know carrying on in the face is it rejoices heart that's that's actually what rejoice the heart of a preacher to have people to preach talk you you cannot pay a preacher you know when a preacher travel the things that make his joy i mean his his trip joyful is to have people to preach to him praise the lord i'm telling you if i don't have people to preach i would go mad i would go because some of the things that is in my head praise the lord amen so that's actually what paul you know was was speaking about to have people waiting for the coming of the lord to have people serving god you know he says it's a crown of rejoicing i feel crowned in my heart the apostle paul says to see you waiting for the coming of the lord amen you know it's almost like you go to a place you're not very sure never got an address no contact and and and right at the airport or right in the market you just you just see someone that you know that that is a believer oh my god what a relief it brings man that's a believer in this era wow you know i mean everything just yes everything just changed praise the lord to see people of like precious faith is a crown of rejoicing so as we look at this as we look at this we will you know we will trust yeah i want to start start from where i stopped on wednesday night because i mean uh uh the presence of the law was so blessful to us that we couldn't we couldn't even preach we just only read but random testimony in there from the the sixth seal now so uh uh and so like i just like i said what the reason why i read that statistics is for for us to be able to appreciate what the grace of god is doing in our life because i call into the statistics that is the path that is set for many to walk into and what is happening here is that the grace of god has snatched you from that path god has says no you are my own praise lord amen now all you need to do is to just embrace that grace and hold fast to it [Music] because the society is saying this is what you will become and every devil in hell is swearing by their life that this is what you will become amen this is what your life will become this is what your marriage will become this is what your children will become and the grace of god is saying no they are mine they have been purchased by the blood a price have been paid how we should appreciate that grace amen how should we appreciate that grace praise the lord now brother branham uh we that the sixth ceo uh we're reading that on on uh uh wednesday night he was talking about uh uh that dream of uh you know of the recording injured i kind of broke it here because it was a kind of a long reading wednesday night i'll go back to it he says the recording injury and that's the reason why i'm going back to it and the recording angel stood and said well brandon i never thought i they have to walk that so then i was scared why was he scared praise the lord amen why was he scared do you remember where paul says i don't i don't want to preach and then at the end i see myself at castleway the man i was that was the prophet to the gentile that had the mystery of the new testament is saying that i don't want to preach all of this and at the end i've been i've being a cast away and your brother batman is expressing the same thought he says so then i was here so you see every preacher every son of god hold that in their heart that's the reason why we we we we approach the word of god with with grace and with reverence ignoring that i mean is is not only only the the the people that you are preaching to you're also preaching to yourself and that's the reason why many times the way a preacher receives a message he cannot deliver it that way sometimes you will think that i really want to bring it to the people no because the first thing there is that god starts to deal with you praise the lord and maybe there is just a little portion for the people amen praise the lord so he said so then i was here and i started walking up through there and just just as i made the first step i i stopped i looked at his face and i thought i want to i want to get a good look at him uh this way then i stopped i had my hands like this i felt something slip in my hands here it was somebody else's arm i look around and and there's two hope those big those those uh big black eyes and and and that that head hanging down her back and and white robin looking up at me like that praise the lord he says and i said open and and i felt something hit my arms look around there was me there that dark eyes looking up and they had black head hanging down and white robe and i sent me there and they look uh and they look at one another i got them in my arms and and oh i woke up it says i sat down in a chair and i cried you know i thought oh god i hope that comes like that both associate with me in life and bringing children and things like that okay that's that is the online place and there's a reason why i read that is is uh i will follow the talks here and brother branham here uh in this in this uh uh a dream he's having is is is also representing what we have we have uh uh i read about uh every man receiving the reward of what is done in their body and yeri said he's seen here that uh the two sisters that associated with him in his life as his wife uh because uh hope was the first wife and and when she passed away then uh uh uh true a vision yeah she told brother brown don't be single you have to get married billy you have to go on you have to find a woman to raise my son billy paul and burt benham got married to meet him and uh but there are there are some things that we will not appreciate unless the grace of god help us to look at some things so i want to read a few of them to you right here brother branham talks yet about his first visit to the pentecostal people at the uh martial arkham meetings he said so i remember when i first come around the pentecostal people years ago it was at mishawaka he said there there was two group of them one was called the the the pa of w and and uh another one the pe and the jc uh jc there was a jesus name people and uh and and the pentecostal i think it was oneness because the pentecostal after azusa street split it into two groups it split it into the united pentecostal and also the assembly of god amen there was the two groups that are denominated from the real pentecostal revival right now so he says i believe their convention in enough lane because there there was segregation i want you to notice that word there was segregation so the the the colorado veterans who attend the meeting i watched them all day how peculiar no more church man of mine i was sitting there and we baptized we know we tried to to add kind of churchy in church but this fellow didn't have any baptist man at all all in a church manner what is the beginning of the year so i can i can i can i can take the liberty and express some things there you will realize that the first church order that brother branham gave the first church order if you study church order verbum talks about uh you know the the sunday school superintendent coming giving the sunday school report and all of that all of that was a baptist order if you rehab in the baptist church if you have stayed around the south in baptist you will know that as brother branham was bringing this church although there were there were things that that was the best that he knew that is the reason why when you go back and you look at the church order or the dedication before the seals you found out that there were major things that brother branham major on and why the reason why i say that is because many don't appreciate the progression the progression the way brother branham progress the bible says even our lord jesus learned by the things that he suffered amen praise the lord [Music] now so that was just a parenthesis uh now so what i want us to to see here is the other let's read the next the next quote live story then maybe you you might grab it or you might not why there there were there where the trouble started right there he's talking about uh uh he and his mother-in-law uh sister hope mother uh she said william william branham do you mean to tell me that you did take my daughter out among a bunch of trash like that i said well look uh mrs brownback they are not trash he said that's a bunch of holy ruler now so what was happening here you know to be able to appreciate this was a time where uh there was there was segregation okay and and uh i mean the the the the people in the south or the black and the white they were not migrating even in in churches so now brother branham seeing what is happening here among the the pentecostal people that there is something in there i want you to appreciate and you have to remember that william simon was a black man that you know that god you know started using uh at the azusa stream meeting and and and this there has always been any ages there were many people that that associated with with a pentecostal move just only because i'm a bunch of black people were there they never had no revelation they never had no birth okay but this is what is happening now so you can you can realize here that from this court brother branham realized what is happening among those pentecostal people and uh uh remember he's a young preacher now then god is dealing with his heart and he come and share that with his uh with his young wife and and uh hope and and you know and hope is supporting him you you remember brother branham we'll talk about how hope would read the bible to him and he would say yeah that's true you know and and he says read the next chapter oh yeah praise the lord you know because of his poor education and all of that now so uh uh she going now to support her husband in that revival i'm trying to bring you to why god is involving her in his reward praise the lord because the reward is what is done in this body why is god involving her in the reward because at this major junction of her life she was willing to stand with the prophet of god willing to support she may she may not understand her or she know i mean she's in love with this man and and that i mean he keeps talking about vision he keeps talking about all these spiritual things [Laughter] praise the lord can you imagine a man wake up and then he's just telling you all this spiritual thing and your hair's standing on your back praise the lord you're asking yourself i wonder he knows how how many table of spoons i put in the soup as you are cooking oh my goodness bill man a vision can't stop praise the lord it's just few that we had on tips but just imagine the things that were happening to him daily praise the lord when you see the picture of brother branham rome in tucson he had two twins bed the picture of the room he was sleeping before he went behind the curtain of the time his two twins bear why because of his nature of having vision media never wanted to disturb him praise the lord remember one other vision brother branham talks about he says i was just coming out of the vision and i heard mida and the children talking i needed to get them to school that was the kind of a life that he lived and here is a woman that was standing by the man like that that would stand by a man like that and support his lifestyle brother brahma comes from missionary work he comes home and then i mean uh casey's wife spent just a day or two and then he goes hunting you see while um social media flipped when joseph was was you know as a young boy was you know and she said well you are now always here and and all of that but it gives you it gives you an idea because these are the things that god rewards are we together these are the things that god reward god associating them with his reward hope supported him as a major junction of his ministry because he needed to experience the pentecostal people because he was he was going to breach the edge from the pentecostal over to the seals praise the lord amen and and and media you know supported him through the rest of the ministry are we together praise the lord amen now let's take another one here uh truth easter seals now he's talking now about uh donnie herron prophecy i don't want to bring the whole story to you you know about it if you want to know more you can come we'll talk about it you want my quotes ask the people back there they will send it to your email because they are has choosing the narrow path the harder way that has walked in your own choosing when brother brandon read this he made an emphasis he said you remember moses how to do his own choosing it was moses own choice to leave the palace and go down and associate himself with the hebrew people it was his own choice it was not a dream it was not a vision it was his own choice are we together amen praise the lord because there there has chosen the narrow path the harder way there that has walked in their own choosing now now this man now watch how he wrote it you can see it wrote in foreign words thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it and it is my way bless god is my way he said because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven await thee now watch the connection here now he had never heard about the vision what vision it was beyond the curtain of time so what is he doing here he associating danny hendren prophecy with the visit behind the curtain of time are we together amen praise the lord am i am i making you bald amen did i miss the road somewhere [Music] praise the lord people let's get into the word amen let's get into the word amen it's no time to talk fairy tales god want to take us into another level of our walk with him amen he's now only satisfied of us being church member he want to take us this is the age of inheritance this is the age where we must possess praise the lord god is depending on us to be sons and daughters of god it will only come by us knowing the things that we are entitled to amen so don't sleep on me now amen praise the lord now so he's he's connecting these two things now you have to remember what what we are driving at brother bram says in the message how can i overcome he said these are the things that pastors see you know watching where the people are and where they are supposed to be praise the lord i think we are hanging around this mountain too long it's time to go into the lane amen [Laughter] it's time to go into the land young people praise the lord amen because there is blessing on the other side that we have to enjoy there is blessing on the other side when you take your position as a son of god no matter what the devil does there's blessing on the other side that we have to enjoy amen we have grapes as big as our blood amen so you don't have to throw blood just take one grip and send it on the devil face it's as big as your blow now so he's connecting these things uh uh uh he he has not heard about the vision you remember the vision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision there has made praise the lord now when brother branham talks about the vision behind the curtain of time in the message having confidence he prayed this prayer now watch this now he says may every person that that this year on this ground may i meet them everyone over there in that glorious place wherever it was or whatever it was lord let me meet them in that place i love them and they love me and you told me all that you ever love and all that love you has gathered you to be with you now the reason why i'm putting all of these together is because this is not your reward this is brother branham's reward it's not our reward you see because people you hear people saying it you know brother brown says all all that love him and all that he loved will be there that was not said to you it was said to him this huge portion of heaven is his reward god is rewarding him or maybe you didn't understand me i will help you i will break it down so it can be a little bit clear see when when eliezer went to look for a wife for isaac he swirled onto abraham amen took an art with abraham and then after he left he found his ground of uh his little closet and he said lord god of my father abraham oh god please leave me lord let me not made a mistake father lord o god i pray the lord god you will bless me as i travel lord father god as he prayed as he prayed as he prayed he broke into a place he said lord may the woman that come out and gave me water to drink and gave my camber water to drink praise the lord now you might not you might not realize that but l.a is a trouble with some men it's in the text but that's another thing let me not stray let me now straight so he said this prayer to god he said this prayer to god now when uh uh when uh he got there and rebecca came out and and she gave uh the candle water to drink now you realize that uh uh that was an answer to eliezer prayer are we together so god in another sense was rewarding eliezer by not not fulfilling the prayer in a symbolic way but uh uh you know fulfilling it in a way word is is it's a direct thing that he has prayed for now god rewalling eddie easier by bringing his prayer to pass is completely different are we together completely different than uh because rebecca actually is going to be a wife for isaac amen eliza is going to get isaac wife so god fulfilling his prayer in one sense is rewarding his faithfulness his dedication but yet the bride is going to be isaac's bride and what i want you to see is that the the the the reward of eliezer and the bride of isaac god is rewarding ali but his commitment his prayer putting his heart before god let me take another example paul told timothy and says there's a gift you know that is upon your life because of your grandmother praise the lord amen because of your grandmother and your mother loyal there's a gift that is that is upon your life now so you see what i'm coming with this thought is at a place where parents are forerunner eliezer was a forerunner of isaac to get a bride for isaac and because he gave the bribe for isaac he could not make the bride his own he was only a forerunner are we together amen the same with parents parents are forerunner there are a lot of things that we enjoy in our lives all because of the blessings that comes from our parents praise the lord you might you might not know if you might not uh uh either your parents or your grandparents because the law of god are visiting the iniquities still is these things visiting the iniquity of the generation and generation to come he visit the iniquity and he also blessed the people praise the lord there is uh if you you follow the [Music] brother branham was talking to i'm trying to get the brother name he was the one that was growing the fruits were he was he was blending the season and where brother branham got that thought of uh if this sea ever pulled forth again it would bring his original crop okay when brother branham was visiting him and uh uh you know brother bam talks about being on his farm and seeing you know one tree bringing many fruits and you're asking how how did you how did this happen he says oh no they were great you know but if they ever bring food again you know they will and uh uh is that john sheriff if i remember the name and uh so brother branham as he was talking to the man he uh he broke into a vision and and told the man he says you know that god has blessed you because of your father he says your father was a great supporter of missionaries he supported missionaries whenever the missionary came true you know he he took care of them and you know whether his father or his grandfather trying to get the story together and uh uh so you see jerry said he's enjoying you know uh uh because he he was blessed he was he was wealthy and you ever said he's enjoying all of this but actually is a reward from his grandfather whether the father or the grandfather praise the lord amen god blessing him because uh uh you know his uh his uh his father or his grandfather was a great supporter of missionaries so you see that that is the thing with with four runners john the baptist was a forerunner of jesus ministry but he came he preached behold the lamb of god that that takes away the sin of the word the thing that he talks about before the blessing comes for him to be opening the blind as john hare was cut off even though he was a forerunner he prepared the house of the people but he never sat down to enjoy the ministry that's another group of people that are receiving the blessing of the the lame walking the dead and and all of that are you grabbing the concept of where i'm going with this the lord amen god is gracious to us and in helping us because some of our parents have sleep has not praying for us and then sometimes we are not conscious of that we are not conscious we we attribute it to our smartness we think because we are smart you have not been rewarded for the things that are done in your body the things you are enjoying is your forerunners that have laid the path for you praise the lord amen because you're still filling your cup yet whatever you're putting inside stick is it's coming up are you grabbing the concept of where i'm going praise the lord that's the reason why god gave us foreigners that's why he gave us parents and put people's people in our lives people that we meet in and people that care for us and people that love us and people that we pray for us so if you put all of these together you realize the other you know when i when i thought about it i i was thinking the other you know how how lazy it and how people you know all i have to do i just have to love brother brandon because brother branham says you know them that love him and them that he love will be there that's why i love my prophet jesus says the end that love me will keep my commandments that's what he said that's what jesus said so you can print brother branham gown and put it in front and put it behind if you're not living by the world that is not your reward it's not your promise it is his reward praise the lord amen because of the stain that he talks for the world now he's gone this is our time what stand are we taking oh we are only depending on his stain how are we standing for god in our time dumbbells of what you have because it's somebody else's benefit that you're enjoying keep working for what you have amen somebody's left over that you are enjoying so praise the lord i wanted to bring that thought across matthew chapter five let's go there matthew chapter 5 jesus our lord jesus in matthew chapter 4 if i'm right the bible says and jesus began to preach that the kingdom of god was a hand amen praise the lord are we together matthew chapter 3 verse 1 in those days john the baptist preaching in the wilderness said repent the kingdom of heaven is a hand praise the lord matthew chapter 4 verse 1 jesus went into the wilderness and then he was tempted by the devil praise the lord and then in verse 17 the bible says and from that time after he came out of the wilderness he begin to preach saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is a hand now he's talking about this kingdom of heaven he's talking about this kingdom of heaven you will realize that matthew is uh is one of the person that used there is two expressions on this the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of god okay but matthew is one of the one that that specifically used the kingdom of heaven praise the lord now watch my train of thought here now now he's preaching here talking about the kingdom of heaven is a hand and then when he gets into chapter 5 the scripture said and seeing the multitude he went up into the mountain and and when he and and and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them now you have to remember when you come when you come to the end of this teaching that goes all the way over into chapter 6 and chapter 7 the bible says all the people that sat around it says wow we have never heard this kind of a teaching we have never heard a doctrine like this because there were you were here jesus said it was said unto you but now i say unto you amen you have heard an eye for an eye but now i say unto you now this is where he lay out of that but let's follow the trend of thought because we will find ourselves caught up into our subject right here jesus come along he opened his mouth and he started talking about blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall you know for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they the moon for they shall be comforted blessed are the made for they shall inherit now he brings out all of these beatitudes and uh and and many of the time i i mean i don't know about you but i've taken the time to really try to to follow the talk and see what was these things that jesus was bringing now remember that he's teaching now about the kingdom of heaven you know uh on earth he teaching about it and that was something that was completely new to the to the jews they were looking for the kingdom that was promised to david amen they were looking for the kingdom that was promised to david where the son of david would ruin on the throne and yet jesus coming and he's bringing out of this thought and then as he gets over he gets over to verse 12 verse 13 blessed i yeah when man shall revert you then persecute you and shall say a man of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward praise the lord so could this blessing that he was pronouncing be a reward to the people that would go through that the meek blessed are the meek could he be talking about some form of reward that was going to come through the baptism of the holy ghost for people that would suffer for the namesake of christ because he gets through talking on death and then the next thing he's talking about great is your reward in heaven ye are the sword of the earth you are the light of the world he goes on and he says uh uh thing that i've come to destroy verse 17 the loss and the prophet noah come to fulfill them he goes down and talk [Music] then you realize he goes down and talk and then i'm trying to to catch another talk here sorry i had all of these things lined up here kind of for punishing myself a little bit amen now so you see he gets down there in verse 46 he gets there in verse 46 and then he talks about if you love them we should love you what reward have you do now the publicans do the same and then he goes down into chapter six and he keeps talking about reward and reward and reward and reward now so jesus is is is is uh uh uh uh talking about a dispensation that is coming upon the word a time where god is going to associate himself with man you have we have to know that god had this great plan of redemption in the back part of his mind amen praise the lord it's his plan of redemption but yet he have choosed to use man through all the ages or in the old testament he used those men to lay out types and shadow of what will be fulfilled under the new covenant are we together amen now so here we see now at the beginning at the beginning at the very beginning his first major crusade he had right coming from out of the wilderness after he had faced the temptation with the devil the first major crusade where he has everybody there on the mountain he starts bringing this thought of blessing a dog that suffer for the gospel sake blessed are the poor in spirit someone asked brother brandon about a polling spirit he said it's just someone like lazarus he said you remember lazarus that was that was that was uh uh uh you know uh the one that was uh the the dogs were making his say you know his uh his the sword on his feet and when he died he find himself in abraham bosom barbarian gave that as a type of people that live poor in spirit you know uh it means that they go through one affliction and another affliction they suffer in their body sickness and different things but their faith is strong in god amen praise the lord so jesus is talking all of this and in another sense he's trying to let this these people know that look god do not forget our labor of love he's making them to realize that whatever part that god has ordained for you if you walk in that path he will reward you for it [Music] there are some we will see in this life and some will go and wait for us on the other side are we together see how he's building his ministry at the very beginning of this ministry he he's making the disciples to have a life of expectation amen you remember whether peter says lord what will become of us we have left churches we have left loved ones praise the lord he says in this life and the life to come [Music] praise the lord amen the rewards of things that are done in our body praise the lord and that's the reason why god has this dealing with us through the stages of grace where he justified us and he brings us to a place where we can be a centrify vessel a vessel that is ready for service praise the lord he can trust you with a trial or he can trust you with a duty whichever way it comes praise the lord if we can rightly handle it he says there will be a reward praise the lord now so jesus as he goes along here he also starts to make you know uh the disciple realize he says i mean you you have to be careful now one of the reason why jesus said this i was just reading that this morning on the pharisees the pharisees they were a set they were a set that came up just before john the baptist in that four in that 400 years after malachi there were a set of religious people that came out and they were measuring on works they were measuring onwards your gown has to be at a certain length they're curved got to get certain inch you got to be i mean they were watching of hands watching the pots and all of that so they were they were very big in those things and and and you remember that the the pharisees believed in angels one of the uh they are they are they are teaching about angels they also believe in devils that's the reason why they did not enjoy john the baptist calling them devils praise the lord amen so they believe that in in i mean in this physical life if if you know if you are wealthy you i mean or you have money or something is happening to you it means that angels is blessing you if you are going through tough time it means that demons are afflicting you praise the lord now so you see jesus having this crowd he says chapter 6 verse 5 when god prayeth thou shall not be as the hypocrites uh for the love to pray standing in the synagogues and these were the things that the pharisees love they love to be known as religious people people that are on fire for god my prayer life you know the boss about it [Music] standing in a singing gas or in the corner of the street that there may be sin of men verily i say unto you they have their reward praise the lord he said verily i say unto you they have their reward praise the lord verse 6 but now when their prayers enter into the closet and when thou has shut the door pray unto thy father in secret pray unto the father in secret praise the lord now so jesus is struggling with a taught year of talking about rewards and how men are seeking rewards and how men you know that's that's why the prosperity gospel is all about it's all about physical reward big cars and big house and god will bless me and god will bless you you know and he will you will bless you and you will bless you it's just all about it amen what kind of for what you were gold chained or whatever they put on themselves that's all the prosperity gospel is about jesus is not kicking against the idea of reward he's not kicking against the subject he's trying to show here that the preachers of those days which which were the mega church preachers were wrongly preaching the subject now yeah god is going to reward you praise the lord help that brother he said god is going to reward you but it's not going to be in some cases a public reward it's going to be a secret world brother badam said in adoption he said he will pull you to the corner praise the lord he will pull you to the conan and start to bless you with spiritual dreams [Laughter] oh because you dedicate yourself to praying and living a clean life and taking filtered thoughts from your mind god will pull you to the corner and start to bless you with spiritual dreams and start to send angels to minister to you it's a reward it's a reward of a man that have fought battles for spirits denied himself go sleep and wake up in the night and say lord i need you praise the lord while we talking about prayer here let me let me get a little breach a little parenthesis here i was i was reading was i was uh it's actually clean is clean in the snow yesterday and i was listening to a book and uh and this this uh this thing came up and i decided to go and make some research to find it it was a prayer or referred this is back in the 1800s a prayer of humbleness he used the thought of the of the beatitude yes that's what catch my mind because that was what was on my mind he said oh jesus making humble of heart hear me from the desire of being esteemed deliver me oh jesus it was written in latin and he kept it on his board he prayed that prayer every day from the desire of being the stain delivering oh jesus from the desire of being loved deliver me from the desire of being a store deliver me from the desire of being honored deliver me from the desire of being praised deliver me from the desired of being prepared to others deliver me praise the lord oh you can see how i was cleaning snow you know how my snow cleaning was then i mean i came out my finger was so numb because i was so caught up in my mind i said oh god see the prayer you see the cry of a man's heart deliver me from being praised lord let me go unnoticed [Music] from the desire of being consoled from the desire of being approved amen the desire of being despise the fear of being despised the fear of suffering rebuke praise the lord in another sense he said lord let me stay in rebuke let me stand rebuke when correction come away give me the heart to embrace it let me stand rebuke lord should not be afraid when i'm corrected from the fear of being forgotten nobody call me let it come in there i got you a bunch of hypocrites praise the lord sometimes god will put you in that place praise the lord is because his eyes are on you and he wants you to look at him you are looking around too much he wants you to lift up your eyes up unto the hills from the fear of being ridiculed from the fear of being wrong some people are so afraid of being wrong they are so afraid of being wrong until they can pick up anything for their defense they are ready to pick up anything they are ready to make any kind of a story for their defense because they are so afraid of being wrong from the fear of being wrong deliver me from the fear of being suspected those people they are two speeches you know what this man is dealing with he's dealing with inner character [Music] he's dealing with the silence with the silence that is inside and that's one thing i learned we all have silence in us because silence is part of god but we don't we don't use our silence most of the time the best way when jesus says enter into your closet it means go into silence go into secret silence must be spent with god because god is the god of silence amen he brings the snow he don't make noise praise the lord the sun come up you don't hear trumpet blowing there is no horn that goes through the street to announce the sun comes up praise the lord but you see many times people turn to the silent within when they feel bad then that's when they draw to themself you will never make use of the the god-given silence that god gave you the silence that god gives you is a time for you and him it's it's not a time when you are feeling bad and you get out of this thought they think they are what they think they are what it's just a bunch of negative energy praise the lord that silence is in every one of us it's in us there is a time where you just want to be quiet praise the lord you just want to be quiet and some people think it's a problem when you are quiet because they are never quiet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a time where you just want to draw back you just want to relax you want to get inside of yourself praise the lord that's the time where god comes tonight that's where he comes tonight because what he realized now you have shut the windows you have closed the door you're getting into the closet and say the lord jesus oh god oh lord father yeah am i i don't know but lord am i yeah the thoughts can't even come praise the lord but because people are afraid of silence the first thing they get in their room like the door like the window they get on your phone you are not stay quiet the choir that you are looking for you are not quiet you get more busy because there is a lot of energy that comes from this train that drains your mind the brain energy when your brain losses energy your body is useless that's the reason why when a man goes brain dead there is nothing they can do there is nothing they can do if they put all the machine on you and your brain cannot communicate the doctors cannot help you and the devil has brought something to send us brain dead praise the lord amen people that works i mean now i mean works are uh on a computer and i work on the computer i know what it is i mean you just get tired that light is just drawing your strength drawing your stream so you are told to get up go go and walk just get away from it just go and walk refresh your mother there is there is just so much energy that pulls your mind the fear of being suspected that order may be love more than i jesus grant me the grace to desire it what a prayer what a prayer that a man will exercise himself in what a prayer main option of this world order may increase and that i decrease is he joined the baptist no it's not john the baptist but it's the same spirit of god the same spirit i can say may i decrease and let him increase praise the lord the same spirit the same spirit that made johnny turn to realize that david was the next king that he went against his own father that's one of the thought i had on my note i don't know why i did not write it down but when when when david would call uh mashiboshet to the table he was not rewarding him it was a reward to his father because of the kindness of jonathan so he's bringing this man to the king's table he's now enjoying the same thing with solomon he gained peace with all the nations around him because of his father david's sake was not that he made deals or he fought walls he was enjoying a blessing that he did not labor for that he did not live before stop knocking your chest praise the lord and all of these things i mean i was i was uh yeah going through that and and and all of this uh marty chapter five just just brought my mind together on all of that so you see here let me find a place to close here now you see so these are the things you know these are the things that uh like we said our salvation is is a don't deal you as you accepted the lord jesus with all of your heart praise the lord if you accept the lord jesus in your heart you accept him as your lord and savior god promise you it's a free gift but we're not talking about the free gift we are talking about the reward praise the lord the reward that we have in this life and in the life to come praise the lord yes jesus starting his ministry on the very subject of it to prepare the minds of the people there is a kingdom that is coming here on earth the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of god he said that kingdom is in you it's coming here god coming to rome on the hearts of his people he would take them through different things and as they submit to him he will reward them praise the lord he will reward him wednesday night we read and which of course we have looked at that before looking at the three god-given elements gold savers and pressure stones and looking at the three main me element now remember paul says there will be trial by fire amen and if the fire can't turn it god will burn it but the individual will be safe why because you already have salvation but everything that he was doing was just works amen now so you see paul carried this thought let's look in the book of romans i will leave you here pretty soon my time is up here romans chapter 4 romans chapter 4 that's where he brought the thought of abraham the brother taught of abraham and it's and it's a thought it's a subject that is normally compared with what james said in the book of james faith and work romans chapter 4 you know the scripture there so verse 3 for what sarah the scripture abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of depth praise the lord amen so paul is saying if you are trying to work which of course is is more in the place of trying to be men pleaser and looking for the name and trying to build something of yourself he says you are just working to pay your debt and who can pay the same debt you are just working to pay your debt praise the lord but if it is the grace of god that is working through you amen amen if it is grace that is working through you you are appreciating the grace of god that is dealing with your life and helping you to see this place and oh lord and your father i i wish that i saw the earlier i'm sorry lord give me grace saying you know help me lord and you are you are appreciating the grace of god that is dealing with your heart and it is moving you to different level then the reward is righteousness in that way god counts you righteous now that you don't make mistakes but you make mistakes you accept your mistakes praise the lord you take it to the lord and say lord help me give me grace god come there for righteousness then the person that is always justifying themselves looking for every reason to be right but you're just bleeding like a goat you're just not saying bad you're just saying but if you keep saying it you hear yourself saying bad just like a god are we together amen do you see the things that god have freely given to us the things that he has freely appropriated to us the thing that he has given to us that we can enjoy embracing the grace of god embracing god's grace because it's only the grace of god that would deliver us from what this word is determined that our life will be praise the lord amen when people say we are following a man praise the lord glory be to god and the thing that i mean is it's it's an old testament thing it's an old-timer than you where and you sisters you're making yourself look old and you're in all of that he carried about and said what do you want to say now you cannot stand up to that challenge praise the lord you just have to appreciate the grace of god lord is only because of your grace that they can't see it praise the

praise the lord if you are on the other side of the fence you will say the same thing praise the lord but remember that god is rewarding us of the things that we do in this life the thoughts we allow to go through our mind the way the things we give our body to he don't forget our labor of love praise the lord setting yourself even being in the house of god the dedication you gave to be in the house of god to be in the service of the lord look god knows the end from the beginning we have to realize he's a god that you cannot impress you can't impress god you can't do something and he says god wow i never thought about it you can impress god praise the lord but you know just like what eleazar taught in his mind and what he said in the backside of the desert to realize that god pick up his thought and lay it in rebecca's heart praise the lord a paralyzed him he never had no other option god pick up his thought and lay it in rebecca's heart and that's the thing that please the father when you can pick up the mind of god and the father can see that's exactly what i was thinking that's the thing that moved god on the scene and now you're trying to impress him you can't impress him but just when in all the business just to grab that divine movement and to know that god put you to that place for a purpose just to be a quiet witness and then you were there he said i don't even know why i was down there i don't even know you mean all the time just went by and you didn't know that you were placed here to be a son of god to be a daughter of god oh were you just sitting down

god first that give god the preeminence putting him to his right place that's why god delayed the rapture all of these years because we were all about building big churches and making our names but since this is the time where christ is going to have the preeminence in the people there's a group of people that will lift him up and he said if i be lifted up i would draw all men onto me musicians
