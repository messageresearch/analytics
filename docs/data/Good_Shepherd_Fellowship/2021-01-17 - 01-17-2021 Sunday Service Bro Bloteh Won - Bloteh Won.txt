thank you brother yes he cares for you yes he does well through sunshine or shadow he cares [Music] for you [Music] he cares for you [Music] cares for you let's hum it quietly now as our musicians play yes [Music] um you know i was talking to naomi and rochelle last night and they're talking this morning too that you know brother branham's life story remember how he got so desperate you know billy paul of course his wife was gone and his little daughter sharon rose the lord had taken them home and brother branham was really just about beside himself and and of course billy paul is just a little boy and he'd say i wanted my mama and my brother brad who could bring her back and then one day he said i s look at i saw him i see mama she's up on that cloud that the lord allowed billy paul to see his mother up on a cloud and of course brother branham you know you know the little money that was for the christmas fund for sharon rose came from the bank and he was just so tore up to the point where he got the place where he took his gun and kneeled by his bunk and was going to take his own life and of course you know the story how that all of a sudden the lord just he talked about it as a dream but i believe that the lord allowed him to step into that other dimension and there was a young woman standing there at the covered wagon and the wheel was broken saints [Music] and of course he was saw the beautiful young woman said how do you do he says how how do you do dad hi dad dad you're almost as old as i am he says i'm not little girls are not little girls over here and how that mama's waiting for you up at your mansion and of course she went running up the steps to the mansion she met him at the door and of course she brought him in and a little easy chair that he had a nice little comfortable chair he says you remember that chair that you had i said remember they had to pay payments on it couldn't make the payment one day the chair was gone but she told him says it's paid for over here think about that saying god even the littlest thing like a chair that's how much he cares he knows exactly each and every one of you this morning listen to my voice now he knows the littlest thing in your life he can speak a word to you this morning every day whether you're here in the church building or whether you're at home he can drop something in that will be so personal just to you nobody else would even know what what he's talking about it's personal to you oh my saints he's so personal [Music] so as we approach his throne of mercy this morning let's look for him to speak to us individually something that we have need of we don't even know what we have need of but he knows exactly what we have need of this morning so i want to ask you a question as we sing this song we're going to sing it this way he careth do you he careth do you think about it saints yes he do you well through sunshine [Music] do you let's sing it now he cares i do yes he [Music]

burdens down at your feet and anytime when i don't know what to do has cast all my keys upon you i guess all of my cares upon you i live out of my birthings down at your feet and any times i don't

god lord we dearest thank you precious lord father oh thank you lord if there is one thing father we can thank you for this the lord you are dealing with our hearts lord oh god and like solomon said

the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning praise the lord the last few a few of our folks are away but uh we will we will be keeping them in prayer until they get back praise the lord all until we see them the next service amen we just want to thank the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord and just as we announce on wednesday night we will be taking up an offering for brother hillary traveling tuesday to lay his mom to rest so if you came with any special offering give it to brother cassidy praise the lord amen and uh we want to greet every one of you sister eunice good to see you good to have you back from your travel and uh i want to agree there young brother brother glenn good to see you praise the lord amen and uh like every one of us we have a history glenn have a history and and his history is the other young man that loved the lord used to be there in ghana with uh with the group of the brothers there on the camp his brother mike moore nephew and uh and he had to travel to the u.s to his dad uh his sister came through here one time she's up in the fargo area somewhere there and i got a call during the weekend he wanted to see me and he came over to see me at the church we had a good talk and he just had this desire to get back to god amen well i told him i said i says well i mean it's it's a good thing i don't think i didn't send you an invitation praise the lord it's good when god is dealing with a man's heart amen then you are putting church pressure i think we have passed uh that place in our walk where we don't put church pressure on people you know it's the most horrible pressure to put on any man church pressure praise the lord if you're putting church pressure on your children's topic because it's the most horrible pressure to put on anybody amen and so we had a good talk and and i knew he was around i heard he was around and i spoke with him once because there was another friend of his that came from australia a couple of years ago to visit with me and they were all together many of them and so we spoke and then he came in we had a good talk and we had time to pray then and to encourage him and uh tell him that he's welcome back praise the lord so he will need all your prayers and and support and encouragement that we can give him praise the lord jesus we just thank the lord for that amen and uh there was something on my mind again i wanted to talk about well brothers where our meeting after service let's put it to the next sunday that would be be fitting there are few things that i want for us to cover will not be able to cover it in the meeting today so let's just put it over to next sunday praise the lord so next sunday after service we will meet with the brothers amen and so let's let's stand on our feet uh i want to i want to temper it into something that's a little bit historical and history but it's it's all it's all good i'm praying that the lord will put his blessing upon it uh i was reading something in uh in isaiah chapter 50 and it kind of cut my mind it drew me to this subject thank you musicians thank you sorry uh that's what happened you put us in the spirit and then we forget about you amen praise the lord we want to thank the lord for the musicians thank you very scared for stepping in this morning and and and just bringing us to the throne of grace that was beautiful amen that was beautiful jeremiah chapter 6 jeremiah chapter 6. i had a few scriptures to to cover uh this morning but i want you to pay very very keen attention uh i believe we are living in the day where even san may clear by prophecy i believe we are living in the days where prophecy is growing so fast that we we we may not be able to catch up with it amen don't run after it because you will not catch up you have to believe that god is doing it amen praise the lord it's the time that we are living in it's the time and the season that we are living in and i believe you know like uh but branham said in in the message invisible union he says there will be a message that would come and sweep the bride into the rapture now it's not coming it's not a message that there will be a new messenger that will rise on the scene but it will be the time word the bride will be making i mean we will be putting emphasis on the time that we are living in i believe we have gone past the time of the pentecostal season if you are expecting me to come here and expect me to start preaching and don't wear makeup and don't have fornication god forbid forget about it amen praise the lord if you count me out not to be a preacher because i'm not preaching that forget about it we have a message to get ourselves ready for a rapture praise the lord if you don't know that those things are not right then you have to come to the altar have an experience with god praise the lord amen jeremiah chapter 6. let's read from verse 16. thus said the lord stand ye in the way and see and ask for the old path amen we need the old path praise the lord and that's the reason why i thank god for giving us the prayer meetings that we've been having wednesday night i mean it's been beautiful amen the first night we went 30 minutes last wednesday we went almost an hour we can break the sound barrier amen i believe we can break the sound barrier i believe that we can pray and get lost in the spirit and have people running all over the place shouting over their head i'm looking for that amen i'm looking for where people will turn looks and cry out to god amen now we are asking for the old path where is the good way and walk there in ask for the old path where is the good way and walk there in and ye shall find rest for your soul praise the lord but they say we will not walk there in you know people don't want that old-fashioned experience they want to hear prosperity gospel they want to hear you know things that would tickle their ear conspiracy theory praise the lord god delivered me from there amen i said deliver me from there if i don't have nothing to preach i will play a tape for you amen i'm not going to gather a bunch of garbage from the internet and come and tell you this is this and this is all of those things amen are we together praise the lord but they said we will now walk there in also a set watchman over you prophet ministry fightful ministry amen saying yerking to the sound of the trumpet but they said we were not yet king therefore yeah now look at this just look at the sequence underline the sequence in your mind because we will use that therefore years ye nations amen and no all congregation praise the lord what is among them all year of earth behold i will bring an evil upon this people even the fruit of their tops praise the lord amen you see all the things that are happening around us is what is in the minds of men praise the lord men are ripping the fruits of their tops like in nowhere days their thoughts were evil continuously the imagination of man yeah o earth behold i will bring evil upon these people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not came unto my word known to my lord but rejected it praise the lord let's pray together heavenly father lord i need all the help they are the mortal we need to be able to stand in your father and speak your word come this morning lord and just bless your word father the few things i want to take and encourage the people i pray that lord you add your blessing to it in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen praise the lord i want i want to read this to you and and i will take my mind now i will take my thoughts from there this morning making a way making the way this code here for the message making the way i use that in kind of for later background for what i want to share with you and i predicted i don't say this is the law saying this now i'm predicting that this year america will receive christ or rejected praise the lord amen america will receive christ or rejected i'm getting the little echo i'm thinking if somebody's talking behind me okay i think i'm the one talking so let me read that again i'm predicting that this year this is 1956. this is 1956. i'm predicting that this year america will receive christ or rejected see i believe this will be the turning point now i want to talk on the turning point uh uh that's that's the way i uh uh titled my message 1956 the turning point of america praise the lord now you got to listen to me very carefully many of us even myself were not born in 1956 and uh but what is important here is that uh this generation and the children that are born in this generation almost like the kids that are born now uh uh born in 2000 and and i mean 2020 and uh you know the ones that will be turning one year they will all be born i mean i mean they're all born and as they grow they will now realize that we are very matched now so those kids will think that from the day that man was created they would wear rematch praise the lord amen because they are born into the word and and when they start to recognize their parent they just see these funny things around their face and if max wearing stay little longer that little generation or little kids would just think that's the way it has been praise the lord amen and pretty soon when they start reading their bible they might actually did adam war max [Music] now it's it's sounding funny but i'm saying that to grab your attention here because this word has not always been like this right all the riot that we have seen the violence that we are exposed to that i mean and the declining of the church it had it was not always that way but you see coming into an age where you see things the way it is you think that is the normal way that it's supposed to be praise the lord we think that is the normal way that it's supposed to be but things has not always been like that amen are we together so that's that's the reason why there there is there there have always been a time where dispensation has come to its junction praise the lord nations have come to his junction it would be strange to you if you look on the on the on the index you'll find that 1956 was when brother brandon preached the junction of time because it also have to do with the turning point sure it was where he says we are standing on the threshing flow of the greatness of of unimportance right praise the lord amen there are few things that i'll bring to you but i want to i want to grab your wrap your attention on this because uh uh you know it might it might sound to you like uh history what are we talking about 1956 in 2021 praise the lord but if you follow me a little bit you'll be able to understand some of the things that we will be pointing to you so i predict that this year america will receive christ or reject it see i believe this will be the turning point that america will go in we will have a revival this year or we won't have a revival now think about it think about it in the context of the acceptable year because we're coming right into the jubilee that's what we're coming into so think about it when when jesus said this is your day of visitation amen praise the lord if you accept it you can get the blessing of it that's right the danger there is to put it aside now that i'm standing here uh okay and then uh uh genesis chapter 27 i want to take my time i have a lot of scriptures because i want to build this in a way that you'll be able to understand it amen not just to to bring you know all of the cults and and all of the lecture to you but i want to make this very personal to you praise the lord genesis 27 34 the bible says here [Music] now the story here is that jacob has already got the blessing and then ether has returned from the field he prepared the meal and now he's going to his father to give his father the meal teddy 3 and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said whoa where is he that have taken venison and brought it to me and i have eaten of all before thou came it and have blessed him ye and he shall be blessed and when easter heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exciting bitter crying and said unto his father bless me even me also oh my father and he said my brother came in socialite and have taken away that blessing hebrew chapter 12. hebrew chapter 12. now if you look at that jacob i mean he's a play down the breath right you have to realize the breath right is tied to the blessing amen the breath right is tied to the blessing praise the lord amen repent is tied to the holy ghost you can't get the holy ghost if you don't want to repent are we together hebrew chapter 12. just want to grab your attention here so we can be able to find a place here hebrew chapter 2 verse 16 the bible says least there be any fornicator or preferring person as easter who for a muscle of meat saw his breath right for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected so you see because he played down the birthright he was rejected from the blessing amen now if you go back to the story it looks like he's i mean jacob deceiving and rebecca they all play this out but paul by inspiration is telling us because he played down the breath right he was rejected from the blessing are we together amen and when he will inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance he found no place of repentance it was not in him amen it was not in him though he sucked it carefully with tears he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried and there was just no place it was not in him are we together do you realize that's what weeping has gone from the church it has gone from the church people don't come on a conviction to weep praise the lord amen we can argue our way through our wrong we can get scriptures and call to back ourselves what this is right just to justify ourselves praise the lord amen so uh it's it's it's almost like in jesus word he says recognize the day of your visitation praise the lord and like i've always said from here if god is dealing with your heart you must count it a treasure and you must make use of that you must make use of that you don't know how many words church life has just become a fun memory today praise the lord amen it becomes a foreign memory and even some struggle to even they don't even want to remember those days it's not because it was not real because they realized they had gone too far for me and there is no way to trace their way back there is no way to trace their way back sleeping and having a dream in a revival at the altar they will stream from their sleep because of the conviction that it brings to them sisters that treasure long hair cutting their heads shut even boiling it on the side and doing all sorts of things getting away from decency just to just to fit into the supe to the present uh uh the tolerating society praise the lord so let's let's go with this let's go with this now just to give you a little background which of course we will get we we will grab it but uh 1956 was 50 years from 1906. so 1956 was a jubilee from the pentecostal revival amen 1956 was a jubilee from the pentecostal revival and that pentecostal revival that's the reason why a church life is the way it is you know they are there i mean there are many that are in church and different churches and different you know denomination they don't even know the history of their church you know i mean they they've been married all of their life for catholic or you know uh you know or even lutheran and you don't even know the history how did that church how did that organization was called lutron i mean where did it started from praise the law but what happened is there 1906 god visited his people with the gift of the spirit in azusa in california there was the moving of the spirit we know that god dared with the church he dealt with his people true looter amen bringing them out of the dark teachings of catholicism praise the lord and then after that in germany the holy spirit moved over to england john wesley he brought the the the revival of sanctification i was named after him and uh uh called the meredith group which of course they have gone far from the end praise the lord we have gone far from there because i'm a methodist praise the lord amen but god was bringing the gift of the spirit to to his church to his people and and he visited them on azusa when when once again the church had the same experience like how it was in the book of acts praise the lord the gift of the spirit broke among the people they spoke in tongues the prophesied they received interpretation and it was just told the god praise the lord amen amen that song that comfort is here it has a big history in that movement the holy ghost from heaven the comforter is here now so that was 50 years from there and uh so that is the reason why it is set up a junction of time are we together it's set up a junction of time there's a lot of information here i'm trying to to to share there for for the young people and uh because i call into uh leviticus chapter 25 i call into leviticus chapter 25 we get there to read that a little bit we realize that israel had a mono jubilee of every seven years amen every seven years they were supposed to give the land a time to rest amen they were supposed to give the land a time to rest i would come back to that there was a mono jubilee and they had a major jubilee that came every 50 years so after after seven seven then comes their jubilee which was the major jubilee uh of of of a restoration of everything that they have lost right the lord amen now you think about this god give them a uh a a a tiny jubilee a tiny little let me call it like that we have a minor and a major but a very tiny that after every sixth day the seventh day they must rest amen and that was like a sabbath to them praise the lord amen i'm coming to death also it's all part of the sequence that we're going to deal with here because it's it's it's very important you know the church the church taking on you know uh uh uh the the teachings the understanding of what the sabbath is the true sabbath that is not in the literal day is in the holy ghost bring that true rest to us has also misplaced the church because people think that it is it is the holy ghost you know the rest is the holy ghost so because of that you know they don't even get rest you don't even set a time aside praise the lord a true sign that you have the holy ghost you will give you will give that rest amen your your your sabbath will not be in the observation of a day or ceremony like it was in the jewish custom for your true sabbath you have a time rest where you can spend with the lord you can spend with your family you can cease from work and we together so god gave them there it was the seventh thing and he gave them the seventh year that when it comes to the seventh year every six years you can talk the sword you can plan dig the ground plan i will bless it by the seventh year leave the land don't don't don't tell the ground don't touch it as we look at this you will see the importance of it as we go along but you will realize because israel strayed away from god they went into the days of the headings they broke god's sabbath his seventh day they did not respect it they broke his law they did not respect it the seventh year to give the land is rest god said i will get it you're going to go 70 years i would rather keep the land in desolation so it can rest than to have you there abusing my lord and that's what happened when you don't get this land rest praise the lord if you don't give rest please praise the lord i can go into a lot of things here but he that have ears let him hear what the spirit says to the church amen and they had 49 years because the true sense of the jubilee was israel possession everything they had was given to them by god and i will say to you this morning that is god's principle everything you have is given to you by god as a child of god you better recognize that that everything you have is given to you by god and if it is given to you by god it belongs to god amen amen praise the lord the house you have is belongs to god so you better be calling his name in the house he better be respecting his principle in their house israel possession was given to them by god it was divided by divine leadership joshua divided the land and gave them their inheritance praise the lord it was a perpetual inheritance an inheritance forever got it in that they did not work for me you hear the language that's my money that's my money i work for it praise the lord it was a perpetual inheritance so in the way that the jubilee works the way that the jubilee works is that if a land was sold they did not buy land in houses like we do today amen when a land was sold it was only sold for the value from the time it was sold to the jubilee right it was so for that value from the time the land was sold it was so from that time told the jubilee because when the jubilee comes you have to turn it over so you set it only for that value if it was just two years to the jubilee you only set it for that value if it was 30 years to the jubilee you you can you you can put a price of 30 years so the price of 30 years will not be the same as the price of five years because when the jubilee comes they must return back to the original owner praise the lord now so you will see that's the reason why when zaraphat's daughter were claiming their father inheritance it became it became a uh it became a question it became a struggle the ender says no you know a woman have have never been given inheritance in the land because when she gets married this tribe inheritance will go over to the next tribe and one tribe is not supposed to have inheritance across their border so when moses went to meet the law the law says you gives our five daughters their father inherited but this is how it works they cannot marry out of their tribe that the inheritance will not go to across the border are we together now so that this is how the jubilee or this is how the the dividing the selling of inheritance works praise the lord amen amen so six days you can work seven day rest six years you can told the the the field seven years rest uh uh seventh sabbath you can you can take a man possession or the man can be sold and then after that the fifth year they must come back praise the lord amen that's the reason why uh uh it's called pentecost because it was on on on the 50th day the holy ghost came uh uh on the days of pentecost amen praise the lord the bible says 40 days you know after jesus resurrection you know those old testament scenes were appearing and disappearing in the holy city you know and then 10 days the disciples were gathered in the upper room i mean so after that 40 days you put the 10 to 8 it's 50 that is your pentecost i are we together praise the lord amen too much information here wonderful brother but i'm praying that the lord will just be able to help us let's get back to that quote making the way he says here i believe this will be the tiny point that america will go in we will have a revival this day or we won't have a revival praise the lord i read something else to you let's read this down i believe that this is the year that america will make his decision that was the same year he preached the message to church and his condition look on the charts you will see it he preached the junction of time that same year in in los angeles he preached on the on the azusa street jubilee praise the lord amen church we are not following couldn't devise people these things are not just a makeup theory these are realities praise the lord these are realities let's uh let's let's just go on a little bit here i believe this this will be the year that america will make its decision and i and i trust that they will make it and we will have a great revival that will just sweep we are having much preaching and much in evangelizing but we need a revival a real revival praise the lord amen amen and and and i and i feel the same praise the lord i mean you can get you can get a preacher into the pulpit we can preach you know we can we can preach yeah i mean there are just a lot of things there there are things that have not been touched we can pick up a subject and preach but what the church needs is to get back on speaking terms with god praise the lord it's for the people to give back to the reality not church membership right now i believe the message your individual personality you're behind the curtains life with god amen amen behind the curtains when nobody is seeing you you're behind the curtain life with god [Music] because we can all come up and we can show up to our duty and if it is to play it we can play it right so help me god or behind the curtains and we together that's what we need the lord bless you now let me pick up another thing here so you will you will see a little bit here combination by representation condemnation by representation in 1956 we just left 1956 this is 1960 in 1956 illinois he preached a series of messages there standing at that lane tech high school i said this year is going to be the changing point of america i have just come from overseas don't know why i come come back cancel my meeting in africa and around billy graham something mysterious he canceled his tommy osborne cancer hits and we are crossing the country from meeting to meeting what were they doing calling america back to he said something mysterious happening god allowed them to cancel their overseas meeting to stay warm and give the church her last invitation [Music] and we are crossing the united states in meetings i said america will either receive or reject christ this year amen in 1956 then i said when when they elected an indiana uh 22 year old boy aboard to george the spirit of the lord came with me and i said they finally have a president that will be one of uh one of these crew cut playboy and uh and and and right under this right under the context of this the reason why i touched this uh uh um the reason why i i added this into my note here uh well i was just focusing on running around but right under this context this was the bringing in of johnny john f kennedy the first catholic president and brother brown would see the country haha one they would have the second amen and every one of them are coming on at the same time playboy they are all playboy and they are ladies men praise the lord now so you see uh uh uh the the same voice of god that taught us there was one pres catholic precedent and there will be a second you know uh uh and it is for is fulfilling right in our days it's the same voice that says that that 1956 will have been at any point praise the lord it would have been a turning point for for america it would have been a turning point for the church right now watch in jeremiah prophecies like i told you the prophecy was to the nation he called the nation first and then the next was the congregation amen when god sent a prophet he sent a prophet to the people to the nation when he refuses war then he call and heal it out that becomes a congregation that will hear the voice of god amen are we together amen i've always said when you know god that's the way you will self him the way you know him that's the way you would serve him praise the lord if you know him through a trinitarian channel that's the way you will selfie right young man i've been talking to and uh uh uh been kind of encouraging him witnessing to him and he sent me the text those couple of days he says this is uh uh i you know i gave him the bible and told him uh you know read one if you have a problem just just you know sent for me we'll talk about it text me and says uh yeah we need to talk about this you know this god versus jesus you know it looks like we pray too much to jesus and and and [Music] and i'm seeing the bible talking about god you know this god versus jesus we need to talk about i said okay that's that's a good place to start amen by the way you know god right that's the way you would sell him sure that's the way you were selling that i mean there's just there's just no other there's no no other way there you know sometimes we think that you know we have to pump things in no all a man needs is revelation praise the lord it needs for god to be real some people think god is in heaven they are on earth they are free to do whatever they want to do praise the lord while some people think that he's so near me that i can take one step without him he know my uprising you know my down sitting even if i go beneath the seat he is there and because of that understanding it make them so calm are we together praise the lord so as we look at this together as we look at this together amen as we look at this together there is something crossing my mind so we we realized here that the church had this on their hands the church had this on their hands and and exactly 1956 the church never recognized that they never came to that revival you know they did not recognize that they never came to the revival and that was the turning point of america now why america it will bring us to revelation chapter 13. because this is this is a place now you think about it god brought the the the pentecostal revival to to to azusa there in california and that was in his mind right from the foundation of the world but this is a country that god raised up praise the lord for the freedom of religion bringing the people from europe and skipping the torture of catholicism that suppress the church amen and just like i mean the departing is just like israel god set this nation in its foundation that's what gave her the influence that she had around the world that's what gave her the name that she had right praise the lord it's so sad for many of us even that that migrated to america we came at a time where the country has lost its is uh reverence for god right and that's the reason why you find people they were fearing for god overseas when they come here they backslide because they take this as a way of [Music] you life into the right race yes instead of having a dream for heaven to go all going after the american dream right [Music] and pretty soon their experience with god is lost they can't even pray they can't even read their bible they don't even know where the church door is right praise the lord oh yeah because there was a time where on sunday all working places were closed you never came you never knew that because you came to america and there is work all over praise the lord amen amen praise the lord now so we see this it was it was it was it was amazing yesterday when i was looking at this last night it was i mean it was it was just amazing a few things were were so beautiful came so in line and i hope i can be able to to be able to share that with you as we go along but we're looking at this tiny point you know we are looking at the standing point because it has affected the church life the family life and we see where the nation is right praise the lord we see where the nation is and even the the the internet is not even helping because it's just feeling all of those conspiracy theories and we are filling our mind into those things praise the lord that we are not even looking that prophecy is fulfilling before our eyes [Music] we're not even asking ourself what day are we living in what is happening glory be to god amen so that there was that was the turning point with uh with the church and like i said the church did not it didn't that it did not got its liberty then this now would bring us over to uh uh leviticus chapter 25 praise the lord it's so beautiful amen it's so beautiful because when you look at the rejection of the jubilee you look at the rejection of the jubilee and and and and you look at you know what what the scripture described now you have to you have to you have to realize that this was not man's doing this was god's ordinance god says if a man if a man now this is the way it is if a man was giving into slavery because he could not pay his debt or uh you know and and and he owned and whatever and at the 15-year time you know uh when that time comes uh like brother bran said he can have he can have an axe in his hands and and and all his slave master can be behind him with a wick as soon as that jubilee trumpet sound if he's bringing his hand down he must not touch him he must dare not touch him after that trumpet has signed amen praise the lord if he's bringing his hand that the best thing he should do just leave it let him fall down he must not touch him if this man is using an axe when that jubilee trumpet sound he can just throw it down and say i see you and just [Music] praise the lord oh god amen praise the lord amen amen god gave that a as a natural lord because it was already a spiritual lord a law of redemption amen that everything that adam lost will come back amen it was a lot of redemption but he gave it to israel as a natural lord it was god's own law praise the lord it was god's own lord now if a man was giving in into slavery and and love of his master and his master gave him some benefits maybe a house maybe a wife now you have to realize that everything that his master gave him belongs to his master right that's right now when a jubilee comes he can go but he cannot go with those things because it was given to him by his master praise the lord now so that is where the trump comes in he was given a home he was giving wife and now he has children yeah is he going to walk away from them that's right there you go and his master has been nice to him praise the lord that sometimes the devil tried to be nice to people right well he's never nice amen he never nice that's right but what happened with that law is dead if he's trapped into this thing maybe the law for his family and i mean i mean he's i mean he's he's here even though he's asleep but he's he's not being treated as a slave praise the lord then the scripture says now he must be taken to the temple not idle temple to god's own temple and there must be a witness of the priests the priests witnessed him being pierced now that was the thing that triggered this whole thing for me it was the thing that triggered this whole thing for me i'm saying to myself this is this is this is not an idle temple this is god's own lord amen this is his own lord hey glory to god what is [Music] because you see we have look at this on one side right i'm going to bring you on the other side praise the lord amen glory be to god are we ready oh my now so that's that's the law of redemption so he's sticking to the to the to the to the to the temple and the priests witness it and and and the bible says his ear is put to the doorpost amen that's very powerful that's right right that many people die right in the pill people get reprobate just by sitting on a preacher and misunderstanding what he's saying and they take a wrong attitude and that attitude lead him away from god it's just like god saying king what have you done and he took an attitude before god he never took an attitude when god was not there right before god yes am i my brother's keeper in his heart right in the eye in the house of god he got his seal people become reprobate right in church they sit right in church and they become reprobate man instead of being there and say oh god have mercy help me lord lord jesus help me speak to me lord father speak to me be with me they sit back they look over their shoulder here they look over every service they get something to criticize every service they look for some kind of something that will amuse them funny it's right in church that people get reprobate and they think nothing about it they come back again and get more reprobate they come back again and get more reaper by resenting the word of god nothing you say apply to them they know who they're talking about when they talk this one they know what they're talking about when they say this other one praise the lord the bible says why peter speak these words the holy ghost telling them that was colena's house those people were sobbing they were sucking everything that peter was saying it was sucking lord being unto me oh god thank you for your mercy oh lord thank you for sending peter to our house oh jesus thank you they were just receiving it they were sucking the word just like sponge that it please god to give them the holy ghost even before they got baptized [Music] take him right to the temple and he pierced his ears as i chapter 50. let me show you something oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness if we don't finish work find a time to continue you love the lord thank you jesus isaiah 50. verse one god said the lord where is the build of your mother divorce me whom i have put away now israel is complaining to god accusing god that god has put them away you have rejected us you don't love us anymore so god is bringing him to question because if you were put away according to the to the lord of moses you must go with a written sheet right you must keep it as a witness the build of divorcement was given to the woman for her protection that she that she cannot be abused by the man's family she has some evidence that he wrote it that he signed it with his own finger so god says show me amen you are accusing me of something you went away and you are accusing me that i pull you away if i put you away bring me the bill of divorce show me the proof that's it that's it brother show me the proof amen are we together all which of my creditor is it to whom i have sold you amen do you have a receipt that i sold you to any of my creditors behold for your iniquity have yet sold yourself your sin has driven you into what you into and for your transgression is your mother put away amen wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shouting amen wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there known to answer is my hand shutting at all that ye that it cannot redeem or have no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers the wilderness their fishes stink because there was no water and eye for tears i clothed the heaven with blackness and i make cyclops their covering praise the lord this all sound of judgment there's something here in verse 2 but we will we will visit that another time let's go ahead a little bit verse verse 4 the lord god has given me the thunk of the it praise the lord amen that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary amen [Music] lord give me the tongue of the learning circumcise my tongue lord and give me a tongue of the learning that i would know how to speak a word in season to him that is worthy he waking up morning by morning he awakened at my ears to year asked the learn praise the lord amen now verse 5 this word i want to wrap your attention on this jubilee thing the lord god have opened my ears and i was not rebellious neither turned away back praise the lord if you look at that word open it's the same word pierce oh my goodness oh my goodness praise the lord to be open to loose to tone open to [Music] free to loosen to open open oneself to lose oneself to carve to engrave peace to be an engrave but watch the setting here of the verse that's the thing that grabbed my attention to this subject grab the setting here the lord god have opened my ears and i was not rebellious now when a man become rebellious to the to the to the jubilee he was pierced amen when a man is also not rebellious god put a seal on him too he's also ps because it's either to reject or to accept that's right and what the prophet said here he says the lord have opened my ears i was not rebellious neither turned away back amen neither turned away back he has pierced me i was not rebellious to his lord just like the one that rejects choose to stay with his seven now from isaiah chapter 50 if you want to put this whole thing in context this is where isaiah is prophesying about jehovah seven because it's going to go into 51 50 51 52 53 is the prophecy of jehovah seven in another sense jehovah's slave that's where paul talk his inspiration when he says i'm a prisoner i'm a prisoner for christ i'm jehovah prisoner i'm jehovah's slave he has been so good to me i don't want to leave you have given me everything that i have you give me joy you give me peace you give me the family put my ear to the doorpost log pierce it let me hear your word just like they are getting peers for rejection we are getting ps also because we want to stay with our seven oh my goodness me oh my goodness me praise the lord listen to verse 6 jehovah 7 speaking he says i gave my back to be smarting i gave my back because now i have been pierced not giving my back that his pleasure will be done upon me oh my goodness thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus all people that are all about prosperity and all they want from god is just prosperity better job more money in more house and other base and i even want to partake of his suffering not even want to partake look at jehovah seven this is all prophecy about jesus i give my back to be smithing in my cheeks to them that pluck off my head they pull off the hair from his face that he would disfigure just for you and you can even spend 30 minutes with him i hate now my face from shame and spitting let's not go into that we will have time to go into it i mean oh my goodness the lord has opened my ears he have engraved upon my ears he have opened my ears and i was not rebellious and i did not turn back praise the lord i'm becoming emotional i'm getting away from my subject but it was a year that they could have rejected all receive a revival and billy graham and tommy osmond and and and and over rival all of those men were running around the country calling for revival revival revival come back to the lord america god just heard those men calling the nation back calling the church back and they rejected it now watch and see what happened seven years will bring us to 1963 seven years will bring us to 1963 in the end the the the year of jubilee under the modern year seventh year was the place to let the land rest and that's what the opening of the seals was to take the people from church work and come to christ for their rest that all is in jesus all the pentecostal working let's do this let's do this they're going to mountain like i'm in the valley let's roll on the ground god was calling his church by the opening of the seals showing us what was in god's mind is not by power it's not by might it's by the spirit save the lord seven years after 1963 god left the act door open for seven days that was in noah's time seven years the people were called again to this feast come to rest and did they accept it they rejected praise the lord 1963 seven more years would be 1970. that was when pentecost embraced catholicism i was talking that about that the last time tsunami was not demonstrating it was david diplusi he was the one called mr mr pentecost he was the one called mr pentecost it was a man that brother brown met dead in south africa he was an evangelical preacher a pentecostal man and he thought that he would turn the catholic church to a pentecostal church and finally he emerged catholicism and penicaster in 1977 the pope called him mr pentecost praise the lord to pentecost uh this this is something that gathered a little bit from from his autobiography at the end of david duplicit uh 1977 autobiographic a man called mr pentecost he related what he considered a key validation movement in his life work and calling in room in 1976 with all the key members of the roman catholic pentecostal dialogue he came face to face with the pontiff paul vi we have introduced him one by one to paul as he as as i reached him my name was red and loud he looked into my face and said so you are mr pentecost that's what they call me i reply amen i'm gonna read it i love that to you let me go back to what i'm saying here i was also looking into this as i was studying i sought for the greatness and and genius of america in in her comedian hubbard and her emperor rivers and it was not there in her felt of fields and boundary forests and it was not there i sought for the greatness and genius of america in her rich mind in her world commerce and it was not there in house in hall democratic congress and her marchless constitution and it was not there not until i went into the churches of america and heard her puppets a flame with righteousness that i understand the secret of her genius and power america is great because she is good and if america ever cease to be good she will cease to be great a critical moment in american history the revolutionary war and civil war president george washington and abraham lincoln sought god miraculous intervention helping turning the tides in those walls and save america at the height of the civil war in 1863 lincoln called for several days of fasting and praying praise the lord we have gone to believe the signs listening to the signs that's all our leaders telling us no national day of fasting no national day or praying believe to the science and that's what happened in 1963. 1963 was the very same year where the bible was rejected in schools the 10th commandment was taken from the ward of the supreme court praise the lord you think about it all of those children that were born in the wilderness 40 years they went about in the wilderness and all of those children that were born in the wilderness they were not in egypt everything they heard about egypt was what their parents told them amen praise the lord so the the parents the parents that were bragging on their good time in egypt created a desire in their children to want to go back to egypt the parents that were that were telling their children of how they suffer i mean they just make egypt a bunch thank god we are going to our promised land they create a desire in their children to long for the promised land the society is tied into modern america because that's all that that's all the parents are talking about freedom of liberty and and this right and this other right fight for your right nobody should tell you anything so they are polluting the minds of the children in violence violence everything is just misinterpreted in the height of the civil war 1963 lincoln called for several days of fasting and praying in churches across the nation americans sought to return and be reconciled with with god in prayers and re and and repenting for personal and national sin two days later confederate general stonewall jackson was fatally wounded in the fight accident by his own guys two months later the south lost the battle in god's mercy the war soon ended having seen how many prayers and fasting and repenting god restored america lincoln after name and poured as one of america's best president went to free the african-american slaves and in this culture of slavery by the way men they were men that knew what what the benefit it is into things seeking the face of god that how they solve their problem by seeking the face of god by asking for prayers i know i'm all over the place here but it's fine amen 1956 america rejects her jubilee she choose signs and education and then seven years after when she had mercy she pulled out of the education and judicial system of america she put god out revelation chapter 3 was for free before i stand at the door and knock god was kicked out of the schools praise the lord the symbol in god we trust how many atheists and hit group has been pleading let's move that thing they have been asking for the removal of that seal in god we trust that just show how the people have been tolerated far away from god the god that they sing about is themself amen the god that they talk about is the enterprise what are we talking about here seven years after 1963 will be 1970. seven years after 1970 will be 1977. so keep that in your mind we will get back to that i will show you bring in a little bit about the 1977 prediction and put it on the chat and see what the holy spirit was telling us what he was driving our attention to that people taught brother branham said 1977 the world we're in we will deal with that as as god gave us grace praise the lord but what i wanted to i want to close here i want to close here amen i want to close here in deckman brother branham said this in the message in deckman let's read that and we close in the message in deckman he says this he says and now every seventh year your life changes that seven times seven you see and it makes it kind of high and that's a complete change it bothers the women men usually get a kind of a funny caring and during that time i to talk a little bit about that but that's that's the way that's the way it may that's the way god designed it you know as we talk about this jubilee and talk about this timing every seven years there's a major change that take place in our lives every seven years our first seven our second seven we get right into that teenage that's where the pressure comes on us we start looking for new identity amen we want to be like our favorite person new identity young men struggle honor that time young women experience changes in their lives 7 21 it looks like a life-giving season it's another changes that comes in our life young people think about getting married want to settle down and and all of that praise the lord i love one what one friend of mine said he says he says god gave us 70 years he says it's 10 7. this is revelation 10 7. those brothers in south africa we pull everything out of the scripture from us for us oh my goodness me but i love that you know it's kind of make you start thinking but yeah those things happen those things happen wednesday night i might share some things with you and and and you know and and we go through those changes young people it's god that designed this it's god that designed it when you when you when you're experiencing pressure don't look to the media don't go to google and facebook or youtube go to god and say lord i don't understand what's happening to me help me lord talk to your parents many times young people experience these changes that it is not your fault that's how god designed it but in this period of time that's when you need someone to help you well you see that that that teenage bring us to the place where we think we're smart we're smart we know how to hire our actions we know how to move and nobody will know what's happening but you're destroying yourself you are destroying yourself and until we leave until he call us every time we go over a seven there will be a change in our lives there will be a change in our lives uh and he's he goes here he says uh you know it bothers the women uh after they get over their second uh seven they start to see those changes in their life they start to step into womanhood men usually get a kind of funding and carrying on and during their time and sometimes you know that's that's why you know you see all of these guys uh older guys that want to tie their heads like young men you know i mean uh their body can tell them that what they're doing is not good you know as at the ideation you know uh their makeup cannot keep up anymore you know they they wanna they wanna uh piercing they wanna tattoo they wanna behave young they start going to the gym to wake up they're not even understanding what's happening to them but but listen to this and sometimes but but uh women at a certain period of time to get on filter it's a change of life and we all go through that and we must remember that it's it's things that we must bed with one and understand those things praise the lord and what happened here is that i mean just bertrand was was dealing with a case he was talking about somebody he just dropped that that was a passing thought he was not actually teaching on that but what happened here is that there are there are there are things that happen and sometimes we don't understand it sometimes we attribute it to to to devil sometimes we attribute it to uh you know some people would say it's witchcraft some people will say you know it's it's out of there looking at some of that the other time but the brand was talking about the same thing and and talking to a woman and says well you think you know uh uh is is it's not it's a demonic oppression he said no it's just a change of life just like we were saying on wednesday night talking about god bringing us you know a voice calling us out of our wilderness some people goes through these changes of life in rough places it becomes so rough for them it becomes so rough praise the lord while some people is is uh is bringing them uh from their valley to a plain walk with god and they might think in your mind it should be easy for anybody when i got to that age it was easy for me it's not like that it's not like that but those are the things that happen the reason here is that when we get to that seven it's a junction of time every seven in your life is a junction of time it's a tiny point in your life praise the lord and if you listen to the jubilee if you allow your ear to be pierced by this master praise the lord amen if you come to the house of god he said open my ears lord musicians come forward we'll continue i find myself keep going and i don't want to if you says open mind he is lord amen let's sing that song open my heart lord help me to listen [Music] [Music] ah [Music] if she said lord open my heart lord pierce my heart to receive your word [Music] let's just worship him a little bit now [Music] we want to see jesus and say that we love me or let just worship him down and help us we want to blessing to him oh yes lord we want to see jesus to reach out and toss it let it be lord let it be sweet jesus and say that we love it oh open my ears now father [Music] yes [Music] my [Music] oh let's just sing it to him let's worship him [Music] thank you lord yes oh god reach out and touch you say that please lord open my ears father open mind oh god i want my piercing to come from you open
