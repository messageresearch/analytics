[20:09] and as we here today many of us have
[20:13] went through the similar time

[20:33] from the world
[20:36] and other companions to live only to

[20:49] accept
[20:50] from the world
[20:52] separated

[21:10] and longing for that great wedding

[21:16] one day when he just comes
[21:20] though he carry yet he'll be here
[21:24] as we leave today they may just be
[21:28] reunited in our minds and our hearts
[21:31] and may we pledge ourselves to be as new
[21:34] to live
[21:35] undefiled
[21:37] from the world that we might someday be
[21:41] a partaker of that great ceremony to
[21:44] soon to come
