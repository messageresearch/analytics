Lord and father there is no one like you. Let's sing that to the Lord. carries like you. Lord, no one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search throughout eternality, Lord, and find there is no like. Let's sing that one more time. There's none like you. There is none like you, oh Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all in time and find there is no like you. Just before we pray, I just want to read this and uh uh get it get it off my note. That would be the first code there and uh second coming. Brother Brandon share this. Now when we used to have our meetings, this was uh this was the team of our meeting. That's why we were using you can put it up. That's we were using that code for the team of our meeting. But Ram says when that time comes when the church find it brotherly love when the church find is holy decency when the church find it place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us. God want his church to love him. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh, this gone Sunday, we were talking a little bit on, uh, uh, church church discipline and, uh, we we will continue if as the Lord will continue to inspired us. But just like we were trying to say that you know uh we we brought that thought just to be able to remind us living in such a time where there is just a great pressure uh uh on on God's people and uh uh not not only only us as an assembly is is with the the bride of Jesus Christ around the world God's people everywhere dealing with one thing or another is either family thing or the financial thing or a health thing. I mean, the devil knowing that his time is out. He's throwing everything that he can at God's people. Praise the Lord. But you see, we have a commission uh uh from the Lord uh that we we have to brother Brandon in talking here. He was talking about that woman that lost her queen. She was sweeping all over the place. We tried to find it. And that is the place you have to realize that brotherly kindness, it is it is the call for our age. That is our place in the capstone. Amen. That brotherly kindness, we know that we going into the a we can talk about all of that. But uh uh we also see that uh we we we we have to find our holy decency. We have to get back to that place where the house of God is a decent place where our thoughts and our our motives and uh and and our objectives of coming to church is just purely on the word and also the church finding its place in Christ. And brother Bam says and then the rapture we go when the bride know who she is when she find her place in Christ. So we just want to also use that as a prayer need tonight. We want to use that as a token as we go to the Lord in prayer bringing all of these sick needs. Let's also pray and then just commit oursel in the hands of God as a as an assembling. The year is closing on us month of October. We'll be gone November the end of the year. We'll soon be ringing the bell of uh uh 2026. But before that time, we just want to once again just commit ourself in the hands of the Lord. We want this place to be a place where God will meet us every time we come. A place where oh uh the the burdens will be lifted from people. Hearts will be mended and and healing will come to people when we bring knees when we bring people's sick need. We will not just mumble with our our lips but we will be able to put our hearts and put ourself in people's shoes. see that uh sister will be praying for after three miscarriage the Lord bless her with a child and yet he said the baby is sick why if it was in your situation or my situation let's uh we just we just want the Holy Ghost to to hover over us that the time the the time that will be spent here will be a time that will be worthwhile.

Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you tonight. Thank you musicians. Let's take our Bibles. Hebrew chapter 4. Hebrew chapter 4. Just for the scripture reading, let's read Hebrew chapter 4. Then we get into what we want to uh uh do it on tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews chapter 4. We will uh read from verse 14. Hebrew chapter 4. Let's read from verse 14. And then we will go just roll down into chapter 5. Chapter 14. Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heaven, Jesus the son of God. Let us hold fast our profession. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben said is the same word confession. Yeah. Hold fast our confession. Hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities. Amen. But was in all point tempted like as we are yet without sin. Amen. He can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and also he was tempted in every way. Whatever we are going through, he was in a body system elements, he could feel it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He could feel it. He felt hungry. He felt sick. He felt lonely. He felt uh forsaking. Verse 16. Let us therefore come boldly &gt;&gt; unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in help. Grace to help in time of need. &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a time of need and we need that grace to help us. Chapter 5 verse one. For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin. Who who can have compassion on the ignorant, the high priest can, and on them that are out of the way, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmities. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And by reason of he ought as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sin. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God as also Aaron. Father, bless your word. is your internal word. May you just drop thoughts in our hearts tonight. Something that will comfort us, that will strengthen us, thoughts that will draw us closer to you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. You know when uh like we have said before, when Jesus said to the woman, you know, uh uh uh go and sin no more. When he says, "Neither do I condemn thee. go and sin no more. Jesus was not just telling the woman uh uh uh don't what you did don't do it again. No, that's not what he was telling her. But he was giving uh divine command in her life that uh you had just been released from guilt. &gt;&gt; You have also been released from the thing that was holding you that was bounding you. Praise the Lord. So I believe that this word have enough power that it can be preached to us and it can free us from whatever that is bothering us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has enough power you know to uh to come right to that dividing that sunder of our soul and spirit our mind and and and and our entire inner being and and and be able to help us. That's that's how much power I believe that is in the word. Praise the Lord. Tonight we want to look at uh a little thought that we want to we want to call the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; We want to look at the high priest of our confession. But uh what I want to do uh because I don't want to I don't want to be too far away from what we were talking about. Uh, I want to I want to I want to bring uh us back to to uh uh just just keep us in the cycles of what we we we've been speaking about uh of the anointing and the riders and the seven spirits and the seven eyes. I I want to just keep us right in there. But there is something that I want to share with you tonight. And and the reason why I want to I'm speaking on this trying to bring it, you know, from uh uh a Sunday service talking about church discipline and uh uh we just found that way to be able to to uh uh uh you know give ourself a title and just to be able to talk to ourself a little bit. You know when we had that church meeting where we shut down from service, there was just a whole lot that was on my mind. And I was I was really burning and there were things that I want to talk about. But uh again I I I was I was just I was just saying Lord uh uh uh you know help me and I want to bring these things so the people can get under it. They can they can be able to get under the burden of what is on my heart to see to be able to understand that the I mean uh this is not just a social gathering. Amen. We have a responsibility. We have a divine commission from God. Amen. Praise the Lord. We have a divine commission from God. I don't know what about other assembly in Minneapolis, but I believe this little assembly on this corner of the street 6900 uh Humble Avenue have a divine commission. Amen. And and and our responsibility here is to quiet the spirit in Minneapolis. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's our responsibility. Praise the Lord. Like I said, I'm not responsible for other groups and you know and what they are doing and what they are preaching, but I believe that we have a divine responsibility to stand in the gap to pray for our city, pray for our people, pray for the the believers that are everywhere around the city, everywhere around the the country, you know, and uh uh you know uh that's that's our commission. Praise the Lord. And for us to do that, we have to equip ourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to fortify ourself. &gt;&gt; Because if we take on that responsibility, if we as a church say we are responsible for this city, praise the Lord, to be able to lift up the name of Jesus Christ just from this little corner. If we take on that responsibility, I'm telling you, every devil in this city is going to turn against us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They say they have a Buddhist temple. It has a haricrishna temple. You if you if you you really don't know about Minneapolis. Amen. You really don't know about Minneapolis. I mean you having bunch of adult places all around this place. All around this city. Praise the Lord. And uh uh you know uh uh uh and and just just a whole lot. Praise the Lord. Just a whole lot. I mean you go you drive downtown in some of these places you just see you see you just see the spirits in all of his colors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if we are taking on that responsibility which of course we are taking on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't want to be part of it then you you can draw your lines but we are taking on. Amen. And uh uh uh because because you see you just you just cannot play a fair neighbor with the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If if Satan is your neighbor, you cannot play fair neighbor with him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because every morning when you get up, he move he move his f closer to your house. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "No, you know, I'm just planting some flowers." It's just the flowers that is crossing over. You You cannot play a fair neighbor with him. You got to cut those flowers down. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to cut it down. Cut it down from the root. and push him back to his boundaries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you I mean you we cannot play niceness in this age. &gt;&gt; And I think that is the thing that we've been trying to do. &gt;&gt; You know, I mean we've been know you know uh you know just just a kind of a church of uh uh uh you know uh an inclusive group and uh and we start allowing all our young people to start misbehaving. Watch boys here coming with their hairs all flying in the air &gt;&gt; and we see them and they are sitting there and it's not even helping them. &gt;&gt; It's not like they are doing those things asking for help. They are doing it and gradually going away from God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They grow their hair wide. They pierce their ears and and and all and they are gradually going away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I mean we just want to be nice to them and and and it is not it is not helping us, &gt;&gt; right? It's not helping them either. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not helping them. &gt;&gt; We must tell them that it's not right. We love them, but it's not right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh let's let's talk about the high priest tonight. Our high priest. and and and I my my I'm actually taking this from Zach uh uh Zecharias chapter 3. Let's go to Zechariah chapter 3. That's where we want to read from tonight. We just read uh uh uh Hebrew as our scripture reading. But actually in Zechariah chapter 3, the the Lord used Zachchariah to be able to to show something to the house of Israel. the uh uh uh and and and because if you study the book of Zachcharias, Zachcharias had eight vision, eight successive vision in one night. The whole book of of Zachchariah, he's telling us those visions he had. It was eight successive vision he had in one night. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says one vision will kill you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you think about a man having eight visions &gt;&gt; in one night. Now, but uh uh uh uh now so so watch this now as as we go along here. If you remember from our our study last week, we were talking on the seven spirits. Uh we read in Revelation chapter 5, Revelation chapter 4, Revelation chapter 3. We you know we we kind of twist there. But something we read from the church ages a single copy book brand says now the seven spirits that are before God these seven spirit was represented as the seven spirit that when that will be sent forth for the church ages seven spirit before God. We could pick up we could we could pick up from the Old Testament and pick it out there if we just had time. Praise the Lord. So he's telling us there is a representation of the seven spirit over in the in the new in the Old Testament if we have time. Last Wednesday, we went back. We read from Chronicles where the Bible talks about the eyes of God moving to and forth. You know, uh uh uh uh the prophet was warning that king. You are relying on the arm of flesh. You are taking you know uh uh uh your eyes from on the Lord. So uh uh uh that's what we want to stay in that thought. Oh, I just I pray that the Lord will be able to help me tonight to be able to bring this to you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so let's go to to to uh Zachcharias chapter 3 and we read from there. And he's showing Joshua. Now, Zachcharias is having a vision and he's in this vision, he's seeing Joshua the high priest. This is not Joshua the son of Noah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, not the Joshua that was with Moses. This is a different Joshua. Now, this time in Israel history, they they have come from Babylon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. they have come from Babylon. Uh uh uh at this time the Joshua with Moses was from Egypt. This Joshua is from Babylon. So he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. Joshua it I mean Zachcharias is having this vision. He's seeing uh Joshua the high priest standing before the Lord as a high priest. That is his position. He had to stand before the Lord, pray for the people, stand before the Lord, h confess the people's sin in order of that. Now look at this picture carefully. Joshua means Jehovah Savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in another sense, Jesus means Joshua. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's the reason why we we rar account to talk about our high priest Jesus, the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because that is what is being represented here. But uh uh as we go along, you will be able to see it because it shows our high priest Jesus Christ. It also show sometimes what the ministry goes through. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the fight for ministry, the pastor of the local church works closely in the office of the high priest. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He works closely in the office of the Old Testament high priest. He's supposed to be he's supposed to be uh uh at the altar, you know, standing and and and uh uh uh for the people, you know, uh praying and and consecrating himself. You see, uh uh uh the the the New Testament church is uh is uh is structure a little bit different and you know, and God deals with with people in their calling very different ways. But you know uh uh when when it comes over to the things of God, let me tell you there is no there is no h a a part-time service in God. It has to be a full-time service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has to be a full-time service. I believe that every man of God supposed to be fulltime dedicated to the word of God, dedicated to the service of God, not only the word, giving himself to the word, giving himself to prayers, and also standing in the gap of the people. I will show you a picture here as as we go along. Now, here is Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan, And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuked thee, oh Satan. &gt;&gt; Even the Lord that have chosen Jerusalem. Now Jerusalem, choosing Jerusalem, a city that is choosing is a is a type of a choosing woman. Is a type of a choosing bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Jerusalem here is typing the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, uh, uh, Joshua, I mean, uh, Zachchariah is in this vision. And in his vision, he's seeing the high priest standing before the Lord. He's in his position of service, but also in the vision, he's also seeing the enemy trying to resist him, &gt;&gt; trying to attack him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it is not Joshua that is saying the Lord rebuke thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, he's not the one saying it, but it is the Lord that is rebuking the devil. &gt;&gt; Now, this man, he's in his post of duty. He's doing his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the enemy, it's not like he's seeing the enemy. Zachariah in his vision is seeing this but Joshua is not seeing what is happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can only identify the devil by the by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuked thee. Oh Satan, even even the Lord that that have chosen Jerusalem rebuked thee. Is not this the the band plug out of the fire? Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garment and stood before the angel. Praise the Lord. You have to bear with me a little bit here. Amen. Now, if you read uh uh uh what we read from uh uh Hebrew uh chapter 4, uh if you did not pay attention to that, let's go back to that a little bit. Let's just let's just skip back to Hebrew chapter 4 a little bit quickly and then we will come back here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when we read in Hebrew chapter 4, Paul is saying here Jesus Christ is our high priest. What is he saying? That our high priest, he is touched by the feelings of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In another sense, we our weaknesses, our our our sin uh uh becomes the garment that our high priest wear. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if Joshua is wearing a filthy garment, &gt;&gt; let let me let me not go ahead of myself. Let's let's let's let's let's continue to look there in Hebrew. Throw the page away. Let me not go ahead of myself. Let me let me just establish what I want to say here. He said he's touched by the feelings of our infirmities. And then when you come down to chapter 5 verse three, it says, "And by reason of he ought as for the people, &gt;&gt; so also for himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To offer sin. So the high priest is wearing his own burden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's wearing the people own burden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me tell you when you are dealing with something, okay? And I I don't care what it is, even if it is sickness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh and and uh and and and and you you you tell your pastor about it, he talks about it and uh and and and he's standing in that place to anoint you with oil, to pray for you, and all of that. You know, brother Brandon will explain that, you know, how all of those spirits that are cast out of the meeting come back to attack him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you see that is the reason why the Old Testament uh uh priest had to be completely separated from the people. He he just still in the in in the tabernacle. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he needs to avail himself whenever the people comes with their need. He needs to be light enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't need to be heavy and overburdened with his own thing &gt;&gt; and then to charge the people think on himself then he's going to die. &gt;&gt; So he needs to be light enough. &gt;&gt; What about prayer? what about fasting and he just he need to be light enough so when the people bring their knees he can be able to jump into the fight. He can stay on his face and pray for them. He can be there to counsel them. Cry to God and say just like David knowh this bear or this lion is not going to take the sheep of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we get so busy where we we we you know we have to be running after this and we running after that and there's no time to pray and and you know and we just pass the sheath and look for one quote you know brother Brandham says in in in this message brother Baron says this is the way to handle this that does not solve problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is it in this vision. Zachariah is seeing Joshua the high priest. Satan trying to resist him. But then moreover he's close with filthy garment as he stood before the angel. This word filthy garment really don't explain what is happening here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not explain what is happening but you will grab the concept just now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This word filter garment from the Greek is is is very foul. is is ugly because what what uh h uh uh what Joshua is covering your way if I was looking at that today or or the other day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look in here, you will see that the word the word filter G in here is is uh is is very gross because just just using the word filter, it does not really explain what it is. But uh let me let me just let me just help you yield. It says that it's from a it's it's from a root word that means a soul and uh uh as if a streetman which mean he's covered in his own mess. Okay. So then if you look here, it does not say filthy. It says stinky. &gt;&gt; It say stinking garment in in the Hebrew that does not say filthy. It say stinking garment because filthy really do not describe what is happening here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like when Isaiah says, praise the Lord, when Isaiah says in Isaiah 64:6, "But we all, we are all as unclean things and all our unrighteousness is as filthy rag." It's the same word. Now, this is where I want to go tonight. I want to I I want to dive in the place of why our high priests have to stand before God because it's so easy for us to take on a selfrighteous spirit. &gt;&gt; And a self-righteous spirit is stinking before God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; A self-righteous spirit smells. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Except righteous spirit do not help us to appreciate the grace of God every day of our life &gt;&gt; because it give us the sense that we have achieved something and it looks like we are better than them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When we don't realize that the only thing that hangs over you is the grace of God. That's the only thing that hangs over you because evil thought goes through your mind. Evil desire goes through your your your mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there is the grace of God that hangs over you &gt;&gt; that keeps you away from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So we see this man, this priest here standing before the Lord. You think about it. Standing before the Lord. Brother Brandham, brother uh uh uh Don uh he used to help brother Brandham in the prayer line and one time he quit. He told brother Brandon I can't do this anymore. Brother Brandon says why do he says uh he said brother but he says he said I can't believe I'm standing right there where the angel of the Lord comes down and heal these people yet I have evil thought going through my mind. The angel of the Lord, the pillar of fire is there descending the people and he's having brother Brandon told him whatever you are going through time by 100. &gt;&gt; That's what I go through. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through, &gt;&gt; if you think it's so bad for you, times it by 100. That's why I call true. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he's not only taking it. &gt;&gt; He's looking right in the people life and see them committing adultery and see them commit. He's seeing it on a vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, so this this high priest standing in the presence of God, Satan trying to resist him. &gt;&gt; Another word is Satan is trying to accuse him. Right? &gt;&gt; As he's standing in the presence of God, Satan is trying to accuse him. See how filthy he is. See the thoughts that is going through his mind. &gt;&gt; But he's standing in the presence of God, standing on behalf of the people, confessing his sins and confessing the sins of the people. And yet Satan is trying to accuse him before God. And Joshua was clothed in filthy garment and stood before the angel. That's the reason why the Bible says uh God says come and let us reason together. Your sin may be as scal. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no foul saint. &gt;&gt; Yeah. of our unbelief and misbehavior that is so stink that God cannot come closer. There is no mess that we find oursself in that he cannot come closer. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God was just like like man with our self-righteousness, he would not take filthiness in his presence. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He would tell the angel, "Pack this man away. He smells so stink." And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, "Take away the filthy garment from him." All of this is happening in vision. The priest comes and he's he's laboring for the people. He's offering the people needs before God. Oh God, help this family. Lord, help this young man. Yeah. Lord, help this young woman. Let her come to conviction. let her understand that uh you know let let this word be so real to her. He's doing all of that and yet the devil standing right there and accusing him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's just not he's not like a Catholic priest that stay be behind the box. No, he's identified with the weaknesses of the people. He's identified with the failures of the people. That's the work of a prince. That's the reason why Paul says, "No man take this to himself." God has to call a man into it. &gt;&gt; Just like Aaron was called into the priesthood. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if you are not called to it, &gt;&gt; you will spend your whole day on the phone talking people problem from one person to another. You know what is happening? I can't I can't imagine this other person is going through. Oh my god. Oh, I can't that that just all you do &gt;&gt; and that is the thing that people have seen and have experienced. It have destroyed the confidence between the the service the confidence in the service. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We having the confidence in the man because we have a pastor. But the confidence in the service, the way the preacher should labor with the people, they have destroyed that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because of some of the things we have experienced and some of the things that people have experienced. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he said, the Lord said, and speak unto those that stood before him, those angels, saying, take away the filthy garment from him, and and onto him he said, behold, I have caused iniquity. So in the vision, the Lord is speaking to the angels to take the filthy garment off of of Joshua. And he's speaking to Joshua, and he say, "Behold, I have taken away your iniquity." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is all happening in a vision. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Visions should be wonderful things. Amen. &gt;&gt; And also terrifying things. &gt;&gt; Terrifying experience. Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of rim. Praise the Lord. I will close thee with change of rim. Let's let's go quickly as time is getting off our hand. And and and I said, let them set the feral merch upon his head. So they set a ferret mer upon his head and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood by, and the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying, Thus say the Lord of hosts, if thou will walk in my ways, and if thou will keep my charge, then thou shall also judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. &gt;&gt; And who was standing by? Those angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will give you a place among them. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here now, oh Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee, for they are men uh h wonder for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch. Now we know that in the old testament this branch represent Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the old testament he was called the branch. But when he came, he said, "I am the vine, you are the branch." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I am the vine, you are the branch." In the Old Testament, Isaiah call him the branch. And uh and yet Zechariah is calling him the branch. So uh uh uh the angel says, "Behold, I will bring for myself the branch." Now watch carefully now. This is where I want to get to. For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua the high priest, upon one stone shall be seven eyes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we go back to what we were looking at uh uh last week from Revelation. the seven eyes, the seven spirit which are the seven horns and the seven eyes that are before the Lord. Now here we seeing also here in this time God now is showing Joshua that after he has gone through all of this experience in a vision he has gone through all of this experience God is also now introducing him to something that's where I want to bring bring us tonight and behold the stone that I lay before Joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold I will in engrave the engraving thereof the Lord of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in that day shall the Lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbor on the vine and on the fig tree. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, so we see just like Joshua, so our high priest is and also we bring in it as a little type of what our ministry is supposed to be, what what the pastoral ministry is supposed to be, the man that stands between the people and uh uh uh uh uh and the mercy seat. Now, so we see here that uh uh Joshua is now being introduced to something different here after this accusation of the devil trying to resist him. Now we also see here the Bible says and the angel of the Lord protested for Joshua. Amen. That word means that the angel of the Lord witnessed to him. Amen. The angel witness in his defense. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, oh Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee. Behold, behold, I will bring forth myself the branch. Now, the whole thing now, our Lord Jesus is introduced into it in another way. For for behold the stone that I I I I lay before Joshua upon one stone shall have seven eyes. Now so we see here we see and and that and and those seven eyes the scripture says I will engrave the engraving therefore say the Lord of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon will use this here in in in the bridge 1963. He says here, now I want to read Zechariah chapter 3. We we we are just going to get this symbol here. Now, he's teaching on the seven spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he's going to link it to to Zechariah chapter 3. The seven spirit we talk about that is the seven horns and the seven eyes. He's he's now going to link it now. And what did we say? Those four beasts have seven eyes. This is this is the eye of the Lord that run two and four. You will see it also here in Zechariah chapter 4. But what what actually it is is that that's that is the place where I want to bring you like I said on Sunday you know we we must realize that uh when God call us into his covenant when he call us as his children he's not looking at at uh at your ability. Amen. He's looking at his ability. &gt;&gt; He's the one that is making provision here giving you seven eyes to watch over you. Amen. Praise the Lord. So you see Joshua is coming through this vision where the enemy is is accusing him. Praise the Lord. And and and and and the enemy is accusing him of the filthiness that he have, the filthiness of the people just like Bam Balak tried to to bring Bam into to accuse the people before God. Now the enemy tried to accuse him. But then we see on the other side there is a stone that has seven eyes. Amen. that's been watching the whole scene. Joshua has to come through all of that trial of filthiness. He has to come to the place where the the angel was commanded, take the filthy garment from on him. You change his garment, put a clean gun. Why? Because there is an eye that was watching. &gt;&gt; The very eye that gave Zachariah the vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what hashu the high priest was representing the people of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So no matter what the people has gone through, no matter their backsliding and how they have filled God, but God got a man in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's going to use that man life on a vision &gt;&gt; to tell them that I've been watching you out of this. Why? There is nothing of your life that is hid from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you will walk in my ways, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If thou will walk in my ways and keep my charge, &gt;&gt; praise, then I will give you a place &gt;&gt; among these angels. Are we together? Oh, it is getting beautiful here. Chapter four. Let's go. Let's go ahead here. Chapter 4. And the angel that talked with me came and wake me as a man that is waking out of his sleep. And he said unto me, "What that?" Another vision broke out. Now Joshua came from one vision. Another vision broke out. The angel wake him up. Now remember, he's not dreaming. Daniel was the one that had dream that trouble him. This man is having vision. The angel woke him up as a man waking out of his sleep and said, "What see there?" He said, "I look and behold a candlestick or of gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereof, and seven pipes to the seven lambs, which are upon the top thereof." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now last week when we were talking about the seven eyes that represent the seven horns the I mean the seven spirit that represent the seven horns and and the seven eyes we trace it back to the church ages and it was also representing the seven golden candlestick. Now remember now brother Brandham told us we can pick these things up in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; It's not only unique to the New Testament. is not only unique to the church ages. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All through the ages, God's people has been candlestick in his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has raised up prophets and messenger as a lightbearer to lead his people from darkness to light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When do we use candle? In the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't need to use candle when the daylight is off. You use candle in the in the night. That's the reason why brother Brandham said all the messenger came in the evening time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To be able to lead the people through the darkness to the break of the morning, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So you see even from the Old Testament, God eyes has been watching his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reason why in Jeremiah he told Israel, I took you like a young lady. I saw you when you committed harot on all the tree. My eyes were upon you, but yet I pick you up out of your mess. I wash you. I dress you and I brought you to myself and call you my wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. right from the beginning. That is the reason why what took place in Eden never took God by surprise. His eyes were open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His eyes was looking down. When the Hebrew babies were slaughtered, God was not sleeping. His eyes were open. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He's touched by the feelings of your infirmities. &gt;&gt; He knows what you are going through. He feel it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Abraham says our God is not an a a h an imperson God. A one that is not that is not real. He say he's a god that is identified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. He says uh uh uh uh God rich in mercy. Every little thing that concern you matters to God. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The problem there is that is it real to us? &gt;&gt; Is it real to us? Is is that is it the way we see it? &gt;&gt; Do we see that? Just like his eyes are on the spirals, his eyes is on us. Are we seeing it like that? Is it real to you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is it real to us or it's just a lecture? Are we able to trust God to know that he knows our emotion? He knows our disappointment. He knows our hurts. &gt;&gt; He knows. Are we able to trust God like that? Do we really see him like that? Or is something we are considering in our mind? It could be truth. It could not be truth. No, no, no, no, no. It's truth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he's he's showing right here that all through the ages. Now, we read this. There's no time for us to read the entire thing. Let's drop down. Let's drop down a little bit here. Woo. Let's Let's drop down a little bit there. Let's Let's go over to to verse 8 of chapter 4. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "The hand of Zarab has laid the foundation of this house. His hand shall finish it." Amen. &gt;&gt; The alpha and omega principle. God is showing in a vision. I started this. I will finish it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everything that concern your salvation, your redemption, I started it and I will finish it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I have to drag you into heaven, I will drag you. Lord of hosts have sent me unto you. Verse 10, for who have despised the days of small things, for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hands of Zarabel with those seven. Which seven? Now he's pointing back to the seven in verse two. with those seven. Amen. They shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hands of Zarubbabel with those seven. They are the eyes of the Lord which run to and forth through the whole earth. In Revelation chapter 5, that was the scene where it was identified the seven out of the Lord which cover the whole earth. So it's not only concerning the seven church ages. It's been there right from time when it looks like the people of God were abandoned in in in Babylon and and it looks like Nebuchinnezar just had charge of these people and and uh you know and and and and I mean the slaughter and the the the rape and all the evil that was going on. His eyes was there. He kept his eyes on Shedra, Misha, and Abednego. &gt;&gt; He kept his eyes on the Daniel. &gt;&gt; He kept his eyes on a little group of people that was standing for his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he will bring he will bring Joshua against Babylon for what Nebuchadnezzar did to his people. He said, "I gave them to you and then after I will judge you, I will punish you." Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took and and and that is what our high priest does. That is what our high priest does. Okay, we're right here on time. Glory be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ban says something here. It was it was wonderful when I read it. He says uh he said this. He said uh oh Joshua the high priest and his fellow he says uh okay he read the very same scripture. I would bring for myself the branch which is Christ. For behold the stone that lay before Joshua. Seven eyes. He gets he gets here. Okay. Up there. He says uh we're just going to see the symbol of this. He says if I got my scripture wrote in there, I just he says I was I I was just shouting all over the place this afternoon when I hit this. Amen. He says when I when I came to realize that what is in revelation is also here. Amen. It just broke a revival in my heart. Amen. I was just shouting all over the place and yeah that's exactly what happened when the word opened to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now so here brother Brandon was says what do thou hear Elijah he's uhh what dust thou hear? He says that's what the church need is a revival to shake shake from all of its worldiness and the things of the word. You see because because uh we are losing our grip on the confidence of the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When people start backsliding is because they are losing their grip. It looks like the word is not doing it for me. It looks like these promises that that is said is truth is not coming to pass. and we start losing our grip and all that is left with us is just a form. We just have a form but we don't trust the word. &gt;&gt; We don't believe the word. If we believe the word it will affect our attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will have the attitude that says even though he's flaming, I will trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; People start losing their their concentration. They start losing their consciousness of right and wrong. And when we start indulging ourself in things, no time to pray, no time to read the word, no time for meditation, no time, no quiet time, no time to listen to the still small voice. It's just lost. shake off the worldliness and the things of the word and bring back purity and the holiness of God in the hearts of the believer. That's what we need. A feeling where we we hate what is wrong. You'll realize that when people talk about hatred today, it's not against things. It's against people. I hate them. I hate them. &gt;&gt; They are not hating what is supposed to hate. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Bring back the purity and holiness of God in the hearts of the believer. They don't get revival once in a while in the spirit. They become so conned and so indifferent till till they get self tied and starchy self-righteous. That's that's that it was God is God way of describing self-righteousness because just like us that's how the the the the the Jewish people were. That's how the the the the the the Israelites were right here. They fear that they were the people of God. They just took the name of the people of God. We are the children of Abraham. But they were indulging in all the things. So when God want to show our self-righteousness, he says, "What is in you? What is in your stomach?" Praise the Lord. Our self-righteousness is like you taking the dirt from your stomach and covering your entire body with it. That's how God sees self-righteousness. It stink in his nose. That is the beginning of the backsliding of the church. When a person starts to backslide, they start to become self-righteous. It just put them to that place where they they know how to condemn all of you. See the other one. See the other one. See the other one. No, it's supposed to be at a place where your heart becomes the mercy seat of God. You say, "Oh God, have mercy. Help these children. Help this my neighbor. Help these people." If they just wouldn't knew the grace of God that has come to us. If they knew the judgment that is coming upon this world, &gt;&gt; we only know that we are doing well. Me and my family, we serving the Lord. Me and my children start self-righteous rethe. That's good. But that's the thing we are talking about. You know more about the word. It's good to know the word, but it is better to know the altar of the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See that little something that you leave out, that little thing that you leave out. We get on our knees to pray that just it just Oh, God help me. God help. It's just you and you and you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who's the next person you are burdening for? That little something you leave out that that's something in your heart that makes you what you are. That is the think. Praise the Lord. That is the think. See what he says of you in message one. He says, "If ye abide in me, my word abide in you. Ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. If ye abide in me and my word abide in you," what is it? You have got to get the word. Get yourself killed out. Die to yourself. &gt;&gt; Die to yourself. Let Christ live in us. I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but just we just received enough Holy Ghost to make to make us to be to make us to the place where we don't want to lie. We don't want to steal. We don't want to do so. I mean, we don't dress because we don't smoke. We don't drink. We just think that we have we have made it. We think that we have achieved &gt;&gt; Christ in us. Praise the Lord. We think we have achieved it. We have enough just not to make us lie and still we don't want to do anything. But God want to fill every fiber of his church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He want to fill our thinking. He want to fill our mind and and fill every bit of you. Just make you completely totally dear to yourself &gt;&gt; or to your thinking. just so surrender to God till the word of God just living right through you having the burden in your heart. What next? Lord, how can I how can I share this this hope that I have in me with this young lady? How can I have shared this hope that I have in me? Self-righteousness has just it make us so proud that we can't even talk about the Jesus we love. We so we so proud that it is it is only our Jesus. There's one thing that is killing the church especially around the message bunch of self-righteous people. We spend all our time blasting denomination and blasting and blasting and blasting when it's just hitting the word and coming right back to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God was was was through a vision here to Zachchariah. He was trying to show the condition of the people how their self-righteousness is so burdened by this by this by this priest and the devil is there. They are trying to accuse him and and and and seeing condemn the people. Oh, see what has happened again. See what is going on in this other person life. See what is going on in this other person life. But he stay right there before God confessing his sin and confessing the sins of the people and saying, "Oh God, have mercy upon us. bring us a decent church once again where the people have decent spirit. It it does not become difficult to apologize. Oh brother, I'm sorry, sister. I'm very sorry. Praise the Lord. Are we together? Second hand of Galvin musicians, you can come. I want to wrap myself in his righteousness. I know there's a great shadow sitting before us. Every one of us is coming to death tonight. Friends, every every time your heartbeat, you are one step closer to that big door called death. One day you are going to make your last beat and you are going in and I realize as as your evangelist in seven I too I have to I have to go there go to there I have got to come down no matter how much I have preached about it I've got to come down to it but what I do I don't want to come in my own self-righteous rag Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When I see that my last beat coming up and I'm entering the door, I want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness. Knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection. You cannot know him in the power of the resurrection until you first know him in the forgiveness of your sin. You first know him as the God that stands between you and all of your wrong. You see, when you when when you come to that place and you get off that you get that self-righteous garment from on you, the things that you are struggling with, it does not condemn you because you know there is a there is one there that has a garment in his hands and is ready to take your filter garment off and put his robe upon you. That's what he did to our our father Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden when they took a fake a a a a fake leave and cover their shame. He what what did he do? He came down and took a bloody sheep skin representing his word. Wrapped them in a bleeding skin. And that's what God want to do to us. Wrap us in his word. Wrap us in his word. That is the thing that make us to appreciate the grace that we have. We don't walk like we have everything under control. Oh, I know my life. I know my life. You don't know your life. You don't know your life. You don't know what is against you. But you walk under the grace of God. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, thank you for your grace. If it was not because of your grace, I would have been like that man. I will have been like that woman. Thank you for your grace. Lord, I pray if there is just grace that can be able to meet them in their condition. As soon as the Lord can get self-righteousness from in our mind and and take us out of that filthy garment of self-righteousness, you will see how your heart will warm towards people. Even when you greeting the brother, you will see you will be so glad to be able to greet appreciating that the same grace that saved you is the same grace that saved this person. Let's bow our heads tonight. And I be wor Oh. Oh yes, Lord. and never fail. Teach me Lord. Oh, teach me Jesus how to live. Oh yes, they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with way as a eagle. Oh, they shall run and I be wary. Oh, they Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Oh, teach me Lord. Oh, teach me Jesus how to wait. Let's just speak to the Lord while the musician play softly down. Let's just pray together tonight. Speak to the Lord yourself tonight and let just thank him. Let's just thank him that he is our high priest. He's touched by the feelings of our infrequities. He became sin for us that we might become his very righteousness. He was identified with all of our mess and he still identified with all of our failures, all of our weaknesses. But he has come with a with a clean garment in his hands. He has come with his own righteousness. Oh, sin is is an experience. When you experience that, you thank God every day. You lift up your hands in thanksgiving. You say, "Lord, it is your grace. Lord, I thank you for the grace that is still dealing with my heart. I thank you for the grace that is giving me strength every day. Lord, I know it's not by power. It's not about might, but it's by the spirit of the Lord. Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you tonight, Lord.
