[0:00] very much for having kept us by a mighty
[0:06] right hand and for having provided as a
[0:11] safe haven because we know as the
[0:15] scripture says that a named Jesus is a
[0:18] mighty tower the righteous run it into
[0:21] root and is safe we know that our lives
[0:25] are safe and secure in you dear Lord
[0:27] Jesus and we fear no fool
[0:29] I don't care what the enemy does because
[0:32] we know that our lives are in your hands
[0:34] whatever it pleases you to do with them
[0:37] further oh God that is what you are
[0:40] going to do we are so grateful for
[0:44] having been with us not for having seen
[0:46] as true in difficult times you have
[0:50] never left us on our own you have been
[0:54] with us for a truth we can thin and we
[0:56] are so grateful Lord that our life's
[0:58] high in your hands we give you the glory
[1:00] this morning we praise thee further we
[1:02] wash when we bless thee our Lord and our
[1:05] Savior Jesus we have got it once again
[1:07] to talk about our prayer topic we thank
[1:10] you Lord for the tool you have given us
[1:12] for that weapon for this weapon of
[1:13] prayer you have given us for the weapons
[1:17] of our warfare are not carnal by the arm
[1:19] idea to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:21] father open our eyes to see what we have
[1:24] and to reckon in the weapons of our
[1:27] warfare now we can break when the need
[1:30] arises we can destroy with it when the
[1:33] need arises we can make amends with it
[1:35] when the need arises
[1:36] now we can use this weapon of warfare in
[1:39] every single field Lord I shall not be
[1:42] let down
[1:43] we are just so thankful we are asking
[1:46] for your grace your love and your mercy
[1:47] slow to abide with us and we pray
[1:50] committing as many as only away come in
[1:52] father they will bring them in safely
[1:54] also now you would unite our hearts
[1:56] together this morning Lord that we will
[1:59] lift our voices on today in Jesus name
[2:02] Amen
[2:04] praise God yeah I wasn't very sure if
[2:10] we're going to have a pre-meeting we're
[2:14] going to look at prayer this morning but
[2:17] hang God we are here this morning yes so
[2:28] [Music]
[2:33] yes start talking about prayer I want us
[2:41] to look at Matthew 26:41
[3:06] mari 26:41 okay
[3:20] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[3:25] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[3:29] but the flesh is weak Jesus speaking you
[3:38] know if we would humble ourselves and
[3:46] pray there are a lot of things we would
[3:51] not go into if we would humble ourselves
[3:56] and pray watch out and pray there are a
[4:03] lot of circumstances that would not even
[4:06] come our way to begin with but when we
[4:12] do not pray or when we do not give
[4:15] ourselves to prayer we open the door so
[4:18] wide for the devil to walk in and out of
[4:22] our lives it's like you have no privacy
[4:28] it's like you're living in a room and
[4:30] the door is open a jar anybody walks in
[4:36] when they want and they walk out when
[4:37] they want and that is what the devil
[4:40] does in a prayer less life because there
[4:45] are no guards prayer would keep the
[4:51] enemy at bay it keeps the devil in check
[4:58] but where there is no prayer that ever
[5:03] tells you like a football this is you
[5:07] when you go there when it's ready it
[5:08] comes for you and he's in the other
[5:09] place but when you give yourself to
[5:16] prayer
[5:19] you limit what the devil can do you keep
[5:24] the devil in check they come back on you
[5:28] they can't take you for granted
[5:31] why because you have given yourself to
[5:35] prayer watch out and pray that he
[5:43] entered not into temptation and now and
[5:48] it's not as if when you are pray or
[5:50] enter into temptation the temptations
[5:53] would come my brother Branham said to be
[5:57] tempted is no evil Jesus after he fasted
[6:01] and prayed for forty days he was tempted
[6:05] so to be tempted is loss in it's when
[6:09] you yield to the temptation there you
[6:12] have given birth to sin praise be to God
[6:17] so when the devil throws anything at you
[6:21] is like you were wearing a bulletproof
[6:24] vest and then they fire at you with a
[6:29] rubber bullet in the first place a
[6:34] rubber bullet would not kill but you've
[6:39] been in a blood proof vest and be fire
[6:42] outwitted by a rubber bullet you would
[6:46] even feel it it would even though it
[6:49] wouldn't do anything to your life you
[6:53] will see when the devil is coming in but
[6:56] he's going to flee in seven ways praise
[6:59] be to God so to be tempted is no evil
[7:02] but it's when you hear to it then there
[7:05] is a problem now a lot of the times
[7:09] people fall and they say that ever made
[7:12] me to do it the devil didn't make you do
[7:16] anything
[7:18] let's read James 1:13 2:15
[7:35] James 1:13 to 15 let no man say when he
[7:40] is tempted I am tempted of God for God
[7:44] cannot be tempted with evil neither
[7:47] tempteth he any man but every man is
[7:52] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[7:55] lust and enticed then when lust has
[8:01] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[8:05] when it is finished bringeth forth death
[8:09] so the part that I'm interested in this
[8:12] morning is but every man is tempted when
[8:18] he is drawn away of his own lust and
[8:21] enticed so when you are drawn away of
[8:27] your own lust and you get enticed and
[8:32] you yield to it their sin has been given
[8:36] back to the devil can never compel you
[8:42] to sin he will tempt you all right that
[8:46] devil is behind every single temptation
[8:50] God does not tempt what God does to us
[8:54] he will try you because the Bible makes
[8:58] us to understand the trail of our faith
[9:00] is more precious than both to him but
[9:03] God would not tempt his children so just
[9:11] know that you have enough power you have
[9:16] been given enough power to stop the
[9:18] devil in its tracks and when you go out
[9:22] of your way to do anything on godly it
[9:26] is you doing it just tell me
[9:33] those that go to the nightclubs that he
[9:38] just got to the point and you said no I
[9:40] am NOT going to go there anymore and
[9:42] then you entered your room and you lay
[9:45] on your bed and you lock the door and
[9:47] then you open your sight you
[9:49] open your eyes all of a sudden to
[9:51] realize that you are inside there it
[9:53] doesn't happen you would have to get up
[9:55] put on your shirt put on your shoes
[9:58] open the door drive good pay money and
[10:02] enter the devil doesn't carry you bind
[10:06] you in Chains and carry you know in the
[10:11] book of Genesis the Bible says we are
[10:12] free moral agents in other ways you can
[10:16] choose to serve God or not
[10:18] God does not compel you God would not
[10:22] force you that is why in the book of
[10:25] Revelation the Bible says he stands at
[10:26] the door and he keeps knocking pleading
[10:31] that you open the door and let him in he
[10:37] doesn't force you he doesn't force
[10:38] himself on any man praise be to God and
[10:44] it is not just only to the kingdom of
[10:47] God it is also to tell you that the
[10:51] devil cannot compel you to do something
[10:53] that is against the will of God it has
[10:57] to be by a personal choice the choices
[11:01] you make would lead you into those days
[11:12] and now
[11:21] so as we said the double the only thing
[11:25] the devil fears is prayer the devil
[11:29] doesn't feel your muscles but if he s
[11:32] prayer because he knows what prayer can
[11:35] do and because the devil knows what
[11:37] prayer can do the devil would try to
[11:41] stop you from praying by any means
[11:47] possible
[11:48] the devil will try to stop you from
[11:50] praying and where the devil cannot stop
[11:58] you from praying and then you get on
[12:01] your knees to pray or you go ahead to
[12:03] pray anyhow he doesn't stop there he
[12:06] comes again and tells you that your
[12:09] prayer will not be answered what is he
[12:13] trying to do to get you to lose
[12:16] confidence in the Word of God and in the
[12:18] promises of God and if the devil can get
[12:22] you to disbelieve or to believe that
[12:25] your prayer will not be answered that it
[12:27] was buried it even prayer to begin with
[12:30] if you pray and the devil can better to
[12:35] believe that your prayer will not be
[12:37] answered it is as good as not praying so
[12:46] if the devil is not able to stop you and
[12:49] you go ahead and you pray and the devil
[12:52] is telling your prayer will not be
[12:53] answered and he gives you 1000 reasons
[12:56] why a prayer will not be answered and
[12:58] you are still holding on to the promises
[13:01] of God and you are believing and
[13:03] trusting that God will answer the prayer
[13:05] he doesn't stop there when God finally
[13:09] answers the prayer he comes again oh it
[13:12] was by chance it was meant to be
[13:16] it wasn't God answering your prayer that
[13:20] is for the devil does so if it was meant
[13:23] to be if it was by chance if it is no
[13:27] good as in the prayer why did we have to
[13:30] professed before we see the results
[13:37] tens that happen by chance you don't
[13:42] pray wait on the Lord and then you see
[13:47] them happen when we'll pray and we hold
[13:52] on we wait on God and God answers that
[13:55] prayer and we see the manifestation of
[13:57] the result is God on the move it is not
[14:00] by chance it was not meant to be and why
[14:05] would the devil do that so you don't
[14:08] come back to God to give God his glory
[14:14] God lost it when he unless your prayer
[14:19] and you can't come back to him to give
[14:23] him the glory to give him the praise to
[14:26] tell him thank you God honors that
[14:29] praise be to God where there not ten
[14:33] lepers that were healed how many of them
[14:37] came back to the Lord Jesus one only one
[14:40] came out of the ten he came back search
[14:44] for him and when he got there he threw
[14:46] himself by his feet and he praised the
[14:49] Lord he blessed him and Jesus talked a
[14:53] lot about that lepida was healed praise
[14:57] be to God you can go back to read every
[15:00] scene look 17 14 to 19
[15:15] it's a good thing to show gratitude
[15:20] because in first Timothy 6:6 the Bible
[15:24] says that God lead us with contentment
[15:26] is a great game it doesn't matter how
[15:31] small it is show gratitude if you can
[15:41] have time to fast and pray I'll pray I
[15:45] don't care for how long and God answers
[15:48] your prayer you should have time to come
[15:51] back to God and tell him thank you what
[15:58] that does is that it opens the door of
[16:01] your blessings wider I remember in 1991
[16:07] later 1990 or 1991 or 92 Dara boss I had
[16:11] a friend who had a pen a pen for a pen
[16:13] pal and a purpose sent her fifty US
[16:17] dollars so she went for the money and
[16:20] then she came back and said oh my pen
[16:24] friend sent me fifty dollars I said that
[16:27] is good is that what is good about it
[16:30] only fifty dollars then I asked her you
[16:33] mean only fifty somebody you don't know
[16:35] I said I call him and I told him now oh
[16:41] you sent me only fifty dollars then I
[16:46] told her I said that was very ungrateful
[16:49] I said this is the last time you are
[16:53] going to hear from him and it happened
[16:56] that that was the last time she ever
[16:59] heard from him
[17:04] you don't even know this person maybe
[17:08] he's trying to find out with this
[17:10] manicure to this person so let me try
[17:13] with something small and if that goes
[17:15] through oh I cannot trust the channel to
[17:19] send more a lot of the times that is
[17:22] what God does
[17:25] sometimes you would overlook the
[17:27] blessing oh this small team miss Martin
[17:30] it is not how small it is we're grateful
[17:36] when God does something for you show
[17:39] gratitude go to God thank him let God
[17:44] know that you appreciate what he has
[17:45] done what that does is that it opens the
[17:49] door wider for God to give you a lot
[17:52] more blessing even our own children if
[17:56] you have two children and then you give
[17:58] this may be a saint
[17:59] this one I sent and oh and then one is
[18:03] happy Oh daddy thank you God bless you
[18:05] and the other one France only one sent
[18:08] trust me
[18:09] the above your children but your heart
[18:12] before you away your heart is tilting
[18:14] towards that one who shows more
[18:15] gratitude praise be to God so the devil
[18:23] wanting to close in on your blesses
[18:26] would give you a lot of reasons to think
[18:30] now oh this did not happen oh it was
[18:33] meant to happen it was in God just to
[18:36] make sure that you don't go and give God
[18:39] what belongs to him and by so doing you
[18:42] have hindered yourself in a lot of ways
[18:45] don't listen to the devil as I said one
[18:48] time ago the devil is a liar a liar he
[18:53] has always been he'll always be a liar
[18:56] when the devil tells you look left what
[18:59] it means is that look right when he says
[19:02] it is not from God that means is coming
[19:04] from God praise be to God so for every
[19:08] time just know just this morning
[19:14] something I have down
[19:16] I just don't know for what reason when I
[19:18] woke up it's like something else came in
[19:24] even though I have it I did not print it
[19:27] out it's on my computer at work and that
[19:32] writer came in and that is what I'm
[19:35] going to talk about at this point
[19:38] what I have here it's not to say it it's
[19:40] not important but it looks like we'll be
[19:45] talking about this another time when I
[19:47] don't know but well we have reached
[19:51] actually gets me into the next phase of
[19:54] what we are going to talk about that is
[19:57] situations that call for prayer and I
[20:02] have enough time to put this one in bear
[20:07] with me I don't know whether I was going
[20:10] to talk about it this morning so I just
[20:13] wrote it in ink so there are certain
[20:19] situations in our lives that would draw
[20:23] us onto our knees and what I'm going to
[20:29] talk about today is desperation I want
[20:33] us to read from Luke 22:44 Luke 22:44
[20:42] look 2244 okay and being in an agony he
[20:57] prayed more earnestly and his sweat was
[21:00] as it were great drops of blood falling
[21:04] down to the ground praise be to God
[21:09] this was the Lord Jesus Christ shortly
[21:11] before his crucifixion in the garden
[21:13] when he first saw what was going to go
[21:16] through desperation set in being in
[21:22] agony
[21:23] that is why desperation comes in he saw
[21:29] what was going to go through the shame
[21:32] the humiliation the reproach the pain
[21:35] the agony it was just too much
[21:40] just imagine the Lord Jesus Christ all
[21:43] his life was just nothing but what
[21:45] prayer prayer prayer
[21:49] but on a point where he prayed he prayed
[21:52] more earnestly to the sweat of his face
[21:57] began to drop like cross of blood was
[22:01] shortly before his crucifixion now in
[22:05] times of desperation if you're a child
[22:11] of God and I'm saying that again if you
[22:15] are a child of God it draws you closer
[22:18] to God because desperation is not
[22:22] necessarily a good thing it can draw you
[22:26] closer to God and it can send you far
[22:28] away from God it depends on where you
[22:33] stand
[22:38] last week one better one was preaching
[22:40] he talked about John Wesley and his wife
[22:44] that John Wesley credited his prayer
[22:48] life to his wife you would think oh he
[22:51] was patting him on the back oh and it's
[22:54] time to pray it's time to pray get up
[22:56] and pray no as you said last week she
[23:00] was not just a woman who had a mouth she
[23:03] also had the muscles you can imagine how
[23:07] she was pulling the Prophet throwing him
[23:11] up and down in the room and it's a
[23:15] dangerous thing when a woman can beat a
[23:17] man I don't know we've all been children
[23:23] before if you see three children and one
[23:27] can beat the other
[23:30] the wonder is stronger doesn't have you
[23:33] you need a week of and you don't have to
[23:35] provoke him he just comes and he looks
[23:37] at you and I said no you deserve some
[23:41] beating today that is all it takes and
[23:44] then they get on you why because they
[23:47] know they can beat you so a woman that
[23:51] can beat a man that is what it takes and
[23:54] I don't think sometimes your voice
[23:58] leaving would have to provoke here
[24:01] and I see him crying so on his meal one
[24:05] is me it's I know it's you you deserve a
[24:07] little more just wait till I finish with
[24:09] you and imagine just all of this he goes
[24:15] what is it that's precious sitting in
[24:18] and then it drove him more onto his
[24:22] knees to pray and we see the face of God
[24:25] more but there isn't why I say that
[24:30] spreadsheet can be a button it's if you
[24:34] are not standing in the Lord if you are
[24:37] on the borderline if you are sitting on
[24:39] the fence if today is one leg in
[24:42] tomorrow one leg out when this pressure
[24:45] sets in what it does is that it keeps
[24:48] you away it keeps you out of fellowship
[24:54] it keeps you out of prayer that is one
[24:58] way you begin to look around seeking
[25:01] solutions outside of God and that is
[25:06] where you find people going and
[25:08] consulting Oracle's consulting mediums
[25:10] people looking for answers in the
[25:13] whiskey bottle people looking for
[25:14] answers in the nightclubs why because at
[25:19] the point where the expression was
[25:21] setting in they were not standing in the
[25:23] Lord so it took them in a different
[25:25] direction
[25:27] it doesn't necessarily mean that when
[25:31] that happens and it doesn't draw you
[25:33] closer to God a trustee of balance it
[25:36] doesn't necessarily mean that you are
[25:39] not a child of God but one thing that is
[25:43] sure is that you understanding well it
[25:49] doesn't mean you are not a child of God
[25:52] somehow God is so gonna lead you back
[25:57] home somehow somehow how God does it
[26:04] nobody knows yes but somehow God is
[26:09] going to bring you in
[26:11] desperation can be a good thing and it
[26:14] can be a bad thing and that is one
[26:17] situation that actually can draw you
[26:24] very close to God or can send you very
[26:26] far away from God as I was looking I did
[26:29] this morning as I said I didn't plan for
[26:32] this
[26:32] they just came in and I believe it is
[26:34] for a very good reason bad can't cause
[26:39] you to be desperate what causes the
[26:43] spiration
[26:43] storms when there is a storm in your
[26:47] life it causes desperation and what is a
[26:54] stone a storm can come as a result of a
[26:58] trail and a storm can come as a result
[27:03] of a temptation a trail coming from God
[27:07] temptations coming from the devil
[27:11] they're both generate stones and that
[27:15] would cause you to go on your knees and
[27:17] to seek God and as I was looking at this
[27:21] looking at it this morning I saw job
[27:25] that God creating a storm in the life of
[27:29] job God can create a storm in your life
[27:32] and that storm would be to draw you
[27:37] closer to spice up your prayer life you
[27:42] wouldn't like it what you go through you
[27:45] may have headaches hot eggs
[27:48] sleepless nights but just come to think
[27:52] of it the girl is behind it for a very
[27:56] good cause and sometimes we can also
[28:03] generate our own storms look at
[28:08] something there was absolutely no reason
[28:12] why something was supposed to go to what
[28:14] he went through he had another Islam
[28:19] he didn't have to cut his hair the
[28:25] finishes didn't know posture of mendes
[28:27] was a very shot
[28:31] tiny man with that sort of voltage in
[28:35] him they were all shocked
[28:40] what sort of man he was but they knew
[28:42] there was the secret behind his strength
[28:46] and Delilah would come Oh what is the
[28:50] source of your strength just you know
[28:52] going around and something created his
[28:56] own stone he knew what you are so
[29:00] supposed to do and he gave into it he
[29:05] bought into it Delilah was not Samson's
[29:09] enemy Delilah was not his problem the
[29:14] Philistines were not Samson's problem
[29:16] Samson's problem was something himself
[29:19] he created his own stone sometimes we
[29:28] create our own stones we create
[29:31] situations situations of desperation in
[29:36] our life and when that happens it takes
[29:42] nothing by the grace of God to get you
[29:45] out because God is not behind it I
[29:51] remember when trials come trails are not
[29:56] meant for us to fail no trails are meant
[30:01] to promote us you are in stage one God
[30:07] wants to carry to stage two so you have
[30:10] to write the exam right to go to the
[30:13] next stage so God brings a storm it's
[30:17] not meant for you to fail God would not
[30:21] bring a trial so you would fail no he
[30:23] doesn't do that but when you create your
[30:27] own storms
[30:28] it's a different deal altogether
[30:31] but always know even when you have
[30:34] created your own stone that a god we are
[30:37] seven it's a second chance god he will
[30:43] give you a second chance at that chance
[30:46] a fourth chance I'm not preaching this
[30:49] morning but when something could feel
[30:53] the hair on his head coming and he held
[30:57] those pillars and once again he prays
[31:02] remember our God is a prayer answering
[31:05] God well God is a prayer answering God
[31:09] it doesn't matter how low you have
[31:12] fallen my time is all praise be to God
[31:14] if you can just trace your steps back
[31:18] and then identify yourself with God and
[31:23] spray your grass and cry out to God
[31:25] praise be to God God is going to
[31:28] vindicate himself alright so the time is
[31:35] up I don't know why I had to go through
[31:39] this route this morning but I believe it
[31:43] was for a very good cause shall we pray
[31:47] our Lord and our Savior Jesus with me so
[31:52] very much for this morning and we thank
[31:54] you Lord for the pieces of wastes that
[31:58] have come out this morning father
[32:01] for the encouragement of the instance
[32:03] and others to spice up our prayer life
[32:06] Lord and to draw us nigh on today now we
[32:10] shall seek your face more than we have
[32:11] ever done before
[32:13] now we shall know the weapon of warfare
[32:17] we have Lord not such as the word gives
[32:21] not a power that we have when we go down
[32:25] to pray we pray dear Lord Jesus that you
[32:31] would help us father in our walk with
[32:33] you Lord give us faith
[32:40] get us out of the shelf load the shots
[32:43] of humanity get us into thine inner
[32:48] courts help us dear Lord Jesus and let
[32:55] your perfect will be done in our life
[33:01] you have given us prayer as a weapon of
[33:05] warfare
[33:07] let us record in this weapon of war free
[33:11] that it is mighty as the Bible says to
[33:14] the pulling down of strongholds it is
[33:18] not a mean weapon of warfare that when
[33:23] we pray and we believe it shall be done
[33:27] we commit the next process of the
[33:29] service into thine hands Lord may you
[33:32] come and inhabit our praise this morning
[33:34] may you come a minister unto us from lip
[33:37] to ear address the needs and the
[33:39] concerns we have Lord and channel your
[33:43] word towards them that none of us dear
[33:47] Lord Jesus would leave your persons the
[33:50] way we came in in Jesus name Amen
[33:57] god bless you sense
