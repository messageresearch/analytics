[50:55] [Applause]
[51:01] hallelujah we're grateful this morning
[51:05] to
[51:06] this opportunity to be once again here
[51:08] in the this house of god
[51:11] amongst god's people here in uh
[51:15] minneapolis a cold place
[51:18] [Music]
[51:20] we don't have cold much where i come
[51:22] from
[51:24] uh we have a lot of heat so we're not so
[51:27] accustomed to the cold but
[51:29] when you're going to be anywhere for a
[51:31] short time it's easy to bear
[51:35] like our sojourning through this life
[51:37] compared to eternity
[51:40] amen amen so uh
[51:45] hallelujah we'd like to speak on a
[51:49] subject this morning we pray it'd be a
[51:51] blessing to all of you
[51:53] we entitle it uh what house will you
[51:56] build me
[51:57] and uh the subject to get to get to our
[52:00] title
[52:02] uh the subject is the ten virgins
[52:05] friends or foes so
[52:08] we'll be looking into visions and
[52:11] parables uh but from an open book
[52:15] that's now being revealed to you and i
[52:17] in this stain
[52:19] and just to kind of uh warm up our
[52:22] hearts and minds uh
[52:24] to enter into this subject i'd like to
[52:27] read from revelation 6 to begin
[52:30] and verse one and two of course we all
[52:33] know it's uh
[52:36] john's vision of the first seal
[52:40] and it's in two verses but within these
[52:43] two verses
[52:45] those of you that study this message of
[52:47] this hour
[52:48] you realize that in two verses it's
[52:51] contained over 300
[52:53] years of church history so
[52:56] so that so then we begin to realize
[52:59] there's
[53:00] much detail that isn't said in two
[53:03] verses
[53:04] but can be found elsewhere in the bible
[53:07] because wherever you have
[53:08] whenever you have a bible question
[53:11] then there's a bible answer for it to be
[53:14] found nowhere else
[53:16] if the question comes out of the
[53:17] scriptures the answer will be found
[53:19] there also
[53:21] revelation 6 says and i saw when the
[53:24] lamb opened one of the seals
[53:27] and i heard as it were the noise of
[53:29] thunder one of the four
[53:31] be saying come and see
[53:35] so john seen a lamb the lamb opened the
[53:38] seal
[53:39] then john heard a voice he heard a noise
[53:43] as of a thunder
[53:44] so there was a lamb present this opening
[53:47] there was a thunder that sounded
[53:49] and one of the four beasts saying
[53:52] come and see so it wasn't a time of
[53:54] rebuke
[53:55] it wasn't a time of exhortation it was a
[53:58] teaching time
[53:59] yeah so all of these components
[54:03] had to be present in the literal sense
[54:06] when it unfolded when it actually took
[54:08] place
[54:09] not just the vision future but something
[54:12] present happening in the midst on planet
[54:14] earth
[54:16] so the second verse says can i saw
[54:19] and behold a white horse
[54:22] white we usually assume is something
[54:25] good
[54:26] but now we realize through prophecy it
[54:28] can be something bad
[54:30] yeah and he that sat on him had a bow
[54:34] and a prophet said did you notice no
[54:37] arrows
[54:39] no arrows so when this can tie
[54:42] in this anti-christ ride
[54:46] the bold was israel
[54:51] the orthodox church
[54:54] that followed the law of moses that had
[54:57] the many books
[54:58] of torah
[55:01] she had no arrows she could put
[55:04] no one to death as her religion
[55:07] took glory in
[55:11] and a crown was given unto him
[55:14] the crown was pagan rome
[55:17] and that day when the orthodox church
[55:21] of israel united with the pagan crown of
[55:24] warm
[55:26] they went together conquering and
[55:28] conquer
[55:30] and the denominate and the greatest
[55:32] denomination of that date
[55:38] now was able to fulfill its dastardly
[55:40] deed
[55:41] and put to death jesus of nazareth
[55:46] they had no boat to do it they had no
[55:48] power
[55:49] rome had took them all powerful it was
[55:52] against roman law for anyone to be put
[55:54] to death
[55:55] unless they did it
[55:59] so the church of that day the
[56:02] denomination
[56:05] united with the state power
[56:10] and put to death jesus of nazareth
[56:14] the bow and the crown
[56:18] now together they went where conquering
[56:22] and to conquer make no mistake
[56:26] sometimes we thought because it had no
[56:28] arrows
[56:30] that it wasn't doing anything wrong no
[56:32] one's getting hurt folks
[56:35] but church history tells us that the
[56:38] disciples of christ in that day
[56:41] were persecuted unto death church
[56:44] history tells us
[56:45] the 12 apostles all but one died martyrs
[56:49] church history tells us they were the
[56:51] disciples of christ were persecuted
[56:54] they scattered the world over escaping
[56:58] persecution and death and took the
[57:00] gospel with them
[57:03] everywhere they went
[57:06] but when the bow and the crown came
[57:08] together
[57:09] then they went conquering and to conquer
[57:14] and it's repeating again amen once again
[57:17] amen let's bow our heads heavenly father
[57:22] the book is yours you're the author
[57:25] you're the writer
[57:27] and you've written in your word both the
[57:30] parables
[57:30] the visions lord and you've given us the
[57:34] understanding
[57:36] and we pray this morning that you would
[57:38] open the eyes and hearts
[57:40] lord to see your word to see you working
[57:42] in this day
[57:43] that you're in control of all things we
[57:46] thank you now in jesus name
[57:49] amen you may be seated
[57:55] in romans chapter 1
[57:58] verse 14 and and 15.
[58:01] the apostle paul is speaking here and he
[58:03] says
[58:05] in this chapter and in these verses
[58:07] romans 1 14
[58:08] and 15 he says i am adapter
[58:12] both to the greeks and to the barbarians
[58:17] both to the wise and the unwise
[58:21] so as much as is in me i am ready to
[58:24] preach the gospel
[58:26] to you also that are here in minneapolis
[58:30] this is the parable and as parables go
[58:33] what sounds
[58:34] very literal is always hiding a a deeper
[58:37] meaning
[58:38] for instance the parable of the sower
[58:41] found in matthew 13
[58:43] i'm sure you've all read it many times
[58:45] and verse 33
[58:48] it says another parable spoke unto them
[58:51] the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[58:53] leaven which a woman took
[58:55] and hid in three measures of meal
[58:58] till the hole was leavened verse 34 says
[59:02] all these things spake jesus unto the
[59:05] multitude in parables
[59:07] and without a parable spoke he not unto
[59:10] them
[59:11] and it wasn't just in this instance that
[59:14] he was doing this
[59:15] it was it was prophesied it would be the
[59:18] style of the ministry of the son of man
[59:21] at the first coming of christ verse 35
[59:24] says
[59:24] that it might be fulfilled which was
[59:26] spoken of the prophet which was isaiah
[59:29] saying i'll open my mouth in parables
[59:33] and i will utter things which have been
[59:35] kept secret
[59:36] from the foundation of the world what
[59:39] was he bringing this jesus christ to us
[59:42] he was bringing to us a plan of
[59:44] redemption
[59:46] both redemption of the fig tree and a
[59:48] plan of redemption
[59:50] for the bride tree but how would he say
[59:52] it
[59:54] in parables and without a parable
[59:58] he wouldn't speak it sid and the reason
[1:00:00] for it
[1:00:01] was that it might be fulfilled that thus
[1:00:04] saith the lord would be fulfilled
[1:00:06] i'll open my mouth in parables all other
[1:00:09] things has been
[1:00:10] kept secret from the foundation of the
[1:00:12] world this ministry
[1:00:14] of jesus christ i'll come and tell you
[1:00:18] things that only the years of
[1:00:20] adam have ever heard because i'm back
[1:00:23] for redemption
[1:00:24] because i'm back for you yes
[1:00:29] what about the great commission to the
[1:00:30] church
[1:00:32] was it a parable or was it just a
[1:00:36] literal statement
[1:00:38] thus saith the lord it's another parable
[1:00:43] the risen lord jesus said this in
[1:00:46] matthew 28
[1:00:47] beginning at verse 18. and jesus came
[1:00:51] and spake unto them saying all power is
[1:00:55] given unto me in heaven
[1:00:56] and in earth go ye therefore and teach
[1:01:00] all nations
[1:01:02] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:01:05] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[1:01:09] teaching them to observe all things
[1:01:11] whatsoever i have commanded you
[1:01:13] and lo i am with you always even
[1:01:17] unto the end of the world amen
[1:01:21] but acts 2 is the revelation
[1:01:24] of this parable acts 2 adds more detail
[1:01:28] to the parable the great commission
[1:01:30] becomes more clear
[1:01:32] another word we use for that clarity is
[1:01:36] revelation
[1:01:39] acts 2 and verse 37 now when they heard
[1:01:42] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:01:44] said unto peter and to the rest of the
[1:01:46] apostles
[1:01:47] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:01:50] then peter said unto them repent
[1:01:54] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:01:56] name of jesus christ
[1:01:58] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:02:01] receive the gift
[1:02:03] of the holy ghost one
[1:02:06] is the parable the other
[1:02:09] is the revelation of that parable god
[1:02:12] hid it
[1:02:13] in simplicity
[1:02:16] okay god god hid it in simplicity
[1:02:20] then revealed it unto babes such as
[1:02:22] would learn
[1:02:23] and this style of ministry birthed a new
[1:02:27] testament church
[1:02:28] this style of ministry taught men and
[1:02:30] women to walk by
[1:02:32] faith and not by sight
[1:02:35] and now to the ministers i say
[1:02:39] this morning your adapter
[1:02:42] both to the wise and to the
[1:02:47] and i say what house will we build them
[1:02:49] gentlemen
[1:02:51] and to the laity i ask
[1:02:55] the foolish virgin is she your friend
[1:02:59] or cheerful now the parable
[1:03:04] turn with me to matthew 25 and verse 1
[1:03:09] and it reads like this
[1:03:12] then shall the kingdom of heaven he
[1:03:16] likened unto ten virgins
[1:03:20] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:03:23] meet the bridegroom
[1:03:25] they were all the same there was ten
[1:03:29] they were all virgins there was ten
[1:03:32] they all took their lamps there was ten
[1:03:36] and they all went forth for the same
[1:03:39] purpose
[1:03:40] to meet the bridegroom and five of them
[1:03:43] were
[1:03:44] wise and five were foolish
[1:03:47] now they had a detail of the distinction
[1:03:51] between them they that were foolish took
[1:03:54] their lamps
[1:03:56] and took no oil with them but the wise
[1:03:59] took oil in their lamps
[1:04:04] and and while the bridegroom carried
[1:04:08] they all slumbered and slept
[1:04:12] now the ten virgins are not the church
[1:04:15] of laodicea
[1:04:17] but believers of all denominations and
[1:04:19] man-made
[1:04:20] systems that make up the bride of christ
[1:04:24] the woman of revelations 12 and the
[1:04:28] remnant of the woman's seed
[1:04:30] both wise and foolish
[1:04:36] verse 5 it can be taken literally
[1:04:40] but remember it's a parable
[1:04:44] we could use it this morning and and and
[1:04:46] wait till someone's falling asleep and
[1:04:48] say there you are
[1:04:49] there's revel there's matthew 20
[1:04:53] five and verse five you're slumbering
[1:04:55] and sleeping
[1:05:01] and it might be a way for some
[1:05:03] evangelists to get your attention maybe
[1:05:06] but there's a deeper meaning way deeper
[1:05:10] than just a tired lay member
[1:05:14] no but it was saints through the ages
[1:05:18] in a cycle of life being born living and
[1:05:21] dying
[1:05:22] from the time of ephesus all the way to
[1:05:24] laodicea
[1:05:26] the message of the 10 virgins and the
[1:05:27] 144 000
[1:05:29] prophet says this all the way down
[1:05:32] through
[1:05:33] both all died
[1:05:37] wise and unwise wise and foolish
[1:05:40] slumbered and slipped see as they went
[1:05:43] down through
[1:05:44] now they're not lost but they're just
[1:05:45] slumbered and slipped
[1:05:47] in another dimension waiting
[1:05:52] they didn't they didn't they didn't say
[1:05:54] they was dead
[1:05:56] but they're slumbering and sleeping
[1:06:00] from ephesus to smyrna to bergamos to
[1:06:02] thy
[1:06:03] to sardis to philadelphia
[1:06:06] to laodicea but in matthew 25
[1:06:10] and verse 6 it says and at the midnight
[1:06:15] there was a cry made the bridegroom
[1:06:18] cometh
[1:06:20] go ye out to meet him
[1:06:23] one cry of the lord himself
[1:06:26] with three manifestations each one
[1:06:29] designed to take us closer to take us
[1:06:32] higher
[1:06:33] to take us deeper to take us nearer to
[1:06:36] him
[1:06:38] it's the voice it's the shout it's the
[1:06:41] voice of the archangel
[1:06:44] it's a trump of god another parable that
[1:06:47] paul spoke
[1:06:49] adding more detail to the one that jesus
[1:06:51] said
[1:06:52] all connecting together all dovetailing
[1:06:56] so we can see this great picture a
[1:06:58] picture of redemption
[1:07:01] a picture of restoration for the fig
[1:07:04] tree
[1:07:05] and for the bride-three
[1:07:09] paul said in first thessalonians 4 and
[1:07:11] 16
[1:07:12] for the lord himself shall defend
[1:07:14] descend from heaven with a shout
[1:07:17] and the voice of the archangel with a
[1:07:20] trump of god
[1:07:21] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:07:26] part of this parable of the ten virgins
[1:07:30] another detail added to the end of the
[1:07:33] eleventh hour
[1:07:34] at the midnight cry one cry but three
[1:07:37] manifestations of the lord himself
[1:07:40] crying out matthew 20
[1:07:44] verse 1 to 16 is of course the 11th hour
[1:07:48] parable of
[1:07:49] seven church ages it's the calling and
[1:07:51] choosing to the mystical body of jesus
[1:07:54] christ
[1:07:55] and the rewards the same to all seven
[1:07:57] measures of this body of christ
[1:07:59] it's eternal life
[1:08:03] in this parable of this eleventh hour
[1:08:09] it says in verse 3 of matthew 20
[1:08:13] and he went out about the third hour and
[1:08:16] saw others standing idle
[1:08:17] in the marketplace remember what he
[1:08:20] likened to unto
[1:08:21] a man that's a householder which went
[1:08:24] out early in the morning to hire
[1:08:25] laborers to his vineyard
[1:08:28] and when he had agreed from the labors
[1:08:30] for a penny a day
[1:08:32] he sent them into his vineyard
[1:08:35] the sixth verse says and about
[1:08:38] the fourth verse and and said unto them
[1:08:40] go ye also into the vineyard and
[1:08:42] whatsoever is right i will give you
[1:08:44] and they went on their way and again he
[1:08:46] went out about the sixth
[1:08:48] and ninth hour and did likewise and
[1:08:50] about the eleventh hour he went out
[1:08:52] and found others standing idle four
[1:08:55] times he went out
[1:08:57] throughout seven church ages together
[1:09:01] went out as the lion went out as an ox a
[1:09:04] beast
[1:09:05] of sacrifice went out as the man went
[1:09:08] out as the ego
[1:09:09] four times four stages through seven
[1:09:11] church ages
[1:09:12] offering his children eternal life the
[1:09:15] same reward from the first to the last
[1:09:21] verse 7 of matthew 25
[1:09:26] it says then all those virgins arose
[1:09:30] and trim their lamps they were so alike
[1:09:34] in so many ways they were all virgins
[1:09:37] they all had vessels they all were going
[1:09:40] out
[1:09:41] with the same purpose of mind to meet
[1:09:43] the bridegroom
[1:09:46] then all close virgins arose trimmed
[1:09:49] their lamps
[1:09:50] that means they went to prepare
[1:09:53] the lamp to light the wick
[1:09:57] to put the fire to the lamp
[1:10:04] it was time to light it it was time for
[1:10:06] the fire of god
[1:10:08] to be in the house of god to be in his
[1:10:10] temple you and i
[1:10:14] and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:10:18] give us of your oil for our lamps
[1:10:22] are gone out remember at the beginning
[1:10:25] verse three it said they had they took
[1:10:27] no oil no oil
[1:10:31] none and the foolish and twice give us
[1:10:35] of your oil for our lamps are gone out
[1:10:40] now the lamp had a vessel where the oil
[1:10:43] was
[1:10:44] but the top of the lamp was where the
[1:10:46] wick was
[1:10:50] and the foolish tendon to wise give us
[1:10:52] of your oil
[1:10:54] for every time we try to let light our
[1:10:57] wick
[1:10:59] and it begins to burn because we have no
[1:11:02] oil
[1:11:03] then the fire of god doesn't stay with
[1:11:05] us
[1:11:07] in our testimony in our christian walk
[1:11:11] but they wanted it
[1:11:14] but the wise answered saying not so
[1:11:18] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:11:21] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[1:11:24] buy for yourselves
[1:11:26] and while they went to buy the bride
[1:11:29] room came
[1:11:31] and they that were ready went in with
[1:11:33] him to the marriage
[1:11:35] and the door was shut afterward came
[1:11:37] also
[1:11:38] the other virgins the foolish
[1:11:41] saying lord open to us
[1:11:44] this is when they truly became foolish
[1:11:49] when the wise were taken when the wise
[1:11:52] were
[1:11:52] quick and changed and translated by the
[1:11:55] power of the holy ghost when a
[1:11:56] rapturing faith caught them up in the
[1:11:58] air
[1:12:00] then they found that they'd been foolish
[1:12:07] afterward came also the other virgin
[1:12:09] saying lord open to us
[1:12:11] but he answered can said verily i say
[1:12:13] unto you
[1:12:14] i know you not
[1:12:18] i know you not and yet did he know them
[1:12:22] yes he knew them
[1:12:26] there was a time if you think back in
[1:12:27] your memory
[1:12:29] of a man called saul and a prophet
[1:12:32] called samuel
[1:12:34] and samuel had to face that man
[1:12:38] who had been ordained of god to be king
[1:12:40] of israel
[1:12:43] and tell him salt how be it
[1:12:46] that you have become an enemy of god
[1:12:50] i first read that as a young boy and i
[1:12:53] said yep he got what he deserved
[1:12:57] enemy he's probably frying in hell
[1:13:00] right this moment got what he deserved i
[1:13:03] thought
[1:13:06] did he not kill the priest of god have
[1:13:09] him executed
[1:13:14] that i said is a real
[1:13:18] enemy of god
[1:13:21] but one day i heard a prophet speak
[1:13:26] and i had to hear it two or three times
[1:13:30] and he said when saul went to the witch
[1:13:33] of endor
[1:13:35] and had samuel summoned up and samuel
[1:13:39] tell saul
[1:13:41] saul you're going to die in battle
[1:13:46] at this time tomorrow you'll be with me
[1:13:48] in paradise
[1:13:50] and a prophet with eagle vision
[1:13:54] he said did you notice he wasn't lost he
[1:13:57] was saved that man
[1:13:59] the enemy of god had been saved
[1:14:02] oh so don't read this bible like a
[1:14:05] newspaper
[1:14:08] don't read it like data on your computer
[1:14:11] sheet
[1:14:13] oh it takes revelation
[1:14:16] amen and revelation is free
[1:14:21] amen like everything else god offers you
[1:14:25] there is a price
[1:14:28] but it's not the money in your pocket
[1:14:33] but he answered and said verily i say
[1:14:35] unto you i know you not
[1:14:37] watch therefore for ye neither the day
[1:14:39] nor the hour
[1:14:41] wherein the son of man cometh and they
[1:14:44] did not
[1:14:46] for it was the very son of man that was
[1:14:48] speaking to them these parables
[1:14:50] it was the very son of man whose
[1:14:51] presence they stood
[1:14:53] it was the very son of man that john put
[1:14:55] his head on his bosom
[1:14:58] and didn't quite understand who he was
[1:15:02] in this parable it was he the son of man
[1:15:05] speaking to them
[1:15:07] already come and they knew it not
[1:15:11] for he had hid himself in simplicity
[1:15:14] but revealing himself to his children to
[1:15:16] his disciples
[1:15:18] this son of man ministries effective
[1:15:21] right up to the rapturing
[1:15:23] of the wise virgins the bride of jesus
[1:15:26] christ
[1:15:28] and all the way to the gathering
[1:15:32] of a hundred and forty four thousand and
[1:15:36] the remnant of the woman's seed the
[1:15:38] foolish virgin
[1:15:42] you say where does it say that in the
[1:15:44] bible
[1:15:47] i'm glad you asked that question
[1:15:51] matthew 24 then shall appear the sign of
[1:15:54] the son of man in heaven
[1:15:57] then should all then shall all the
[1:15:58] tribes of the earth mourn
[1:16:00] israel and they shall see the son of man
[1:16:04] coming
[1:16:04] in the clouds of heaven angels
[1:16:08] with power and great glory
[1:16:12] if the cloud of heavens was angels in
[1:16:15] our day
[1:16:16] then these clouds will be angels again
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:21] at the end where was the son of man
[1:16:24] ministry
[1:16:26] in the voice of many waters go to them
[1:16:28] that sell
[1:16:29] and buy the fifo ministry
[1:16:33] and many helps in the church
[1:16:36] how shall we buy isaiah
[1:16:40] 55-1 o everyone
[1:16:43] that thirsts come ye to the waters
[1:16:47] and he that hath no money
[1:16:50] come ye buy and eat
[1:16:54] yay come buy wine and milk without money
[1:16:58] in what without price
[1:17:01] how can you buy without money in christ
[1:17:05] the price for what he's offering you has
[1:17:08] already been paid
[1:17:10] but the price you must pay must
[1:17:13] be repentance sincerity humility
[1:17:17] dedication
[1:17:24] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:17:26] which is not bread
[1:17:30] he means iphone 12 that's what he's
[1:17:32] talking about there
[1:17:35] and your labor for that which satisfy if
[1:17:38] not
[1:17:39] another app on the phone that you got to
[1:17:42] pay for
[1:17:44] hearken diligently unto me and ye that
[1:17:47] which is good
[1:17:48] and let your soul delight in fatness
[1:17:52] incline your ear come unto me and hear
[1:17:54] your soul
[1:17:56] shall live and i will make an
[1:17:58] everlasting covenant with you
[1:18:00] even the sure mercies of david amen
[1:18:05] another parable that will add details to
[1:18:08] this 11th hour
[1:18:10] as it blends into the midnight crime
[1:18:13] luke 17
[1:18:16] and verse 34 and he reads like this
[1:18:21] i tell you in that night there shall be
[1:18:24] two men in one bed
[1:18:28] one shall be taken the other left
[1:18:32] now in this day and age when you hear
[1:18:35] two men in one bed you go oh
[1:18:40] this is the parable amen written 2 000
[1:18:43] years ago to give us insight
[1:18:46] to a plan of redemption today this
[1:18:49] morning for you and i
[1:18:52] what is it and i tell you from that
[1:18:56] night
[1:18:57] there shall be two men same gender
[1:19:01] means they're both the same
[1:19:06] two men in one bed and though they the
[1:19:09] same gender
[1:19:10] and they are the same in the detail the
[1:19:13] bible gives you
[1:19:14] yet one shall be taken and the other
[1:19:18] left
[1:19:19] why because one was wise and one was
[1:19:23] foolish
[1:19:24] though they were the same how were they
[1:19:26] the same
[1:19:29] they were believers the ten virgins
[1:19:33] how were they the same they were
[1:19:34] believers
[1:19:38] i tell you
[1:19:41] two women shall be grinded together
[1:19:45] they're the same same gender
[1:19:48] one shall be taken
[1:19:52] and the other left two women the same
[1:19:55] gender
[1:19:55] doing the same things on earth yet one
[1:19:58] was taken
[1:20:00] and one was left what was the difference
[1:20:05] between these two that were the same
[1:20:07] believers
[1:20:09] one had the oil one didn't
[1:20:15] two men shall be in the field once again
[1:20:20] same gender found in the same place
[1:20:24] found doing the same things and yet
[1:20:27] one would be taken and the other left
[1:20:32] when god descends
[1:20:35] to rapture a bride he's only coming
[1:20:38] looking for believers
[1:20:40] but amongst those believers
[1:20:43] if you're gonna make it out of this
[1:20:45] world and be translated and change
[1:20:49] you've got to have this oil
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:56] and yet the foolish virgin
[1:21:01] you know you couldn't put a finger on
[1:21:02] their lives
[1:21:08] the foolish virgin you can't
[1:21:11] put a finger on their lives
[1:21:17] in the message the sudden secret going
[1:21:20] away of the church
[1:21:22] paragraph 35
[1:21:27] you thought it was just my opinion
[1:21:32] and it is what i believe but he said it
[1:21:35] too
[1:21:36] god's a prophet how many of you all
[1:21:39] perhaps have read of the virgins
[1:21:43] some were wise some were foolish
[1:21:46] virgin means purity they were all good
[1:21:49] people
[1:21:50] every one of them virgin sanctified
[1:21:53] vessels of god
[1:21:54] but those who had the oil on their lamps
[1:21:56] went in and the others was left out
[1:21:59] they were all virgins every one of every
[1:22:01] one
[1:22:02] people that you couldn't put your finger
[1:22:04] on for anything
[1:22:06] wrong they everyone
[1:22:10] believed in the coming of the lord they
[1:22:12] were ready to go meet him
[1:22:14] but some of them let their oil go out
[1:22:16] don't let that be your case
[1:22:18] keep oil in your lamp oil is the spirit
[1:22:21] the holy spirit never let it drain from
[1:22:24] you
[1:22:24] when you feel your love dying away your
[1:22:26] sincerity to christ
[1:22:28] the cause quickly go to him who has the
[1:22:32] fountain of oil and buy for yourself a
[1:22:34] feeling of the holy spirit
[1:22:36] our nation is gone morally corrupted
[1:22:40] and ruined our politics are corrupted
[1:22:43] and gone our leaders oh god what could
[1:22:46] we do about it
[1:22:48] you can put a good man in and he comes
[1:22:50] out a crook
[1:22:52] there's only one we can bring now that's
[1:22:54] the lord jesus
[1:22:56] let's make ready for his coming
[1:23:02] the foolish virgin they are sheep
[1:23:07] and they are saved
[1:23:11] but you said they they missed the
[1:23:12] rapture attaching away
[1:23:14] they did but they are sheep
[1:23:18] and they are saved
[1:23:25] my opinion but now backed up by a man
[1:23:28] called william branham
[1:23:30] the patmos vision 1960
[1:23:34] paragraph 25. brother branham
[1:23:38] are the foolish virgins of matthew 25
[1:23:42] counted as the gentile remnant i
[1:23:44] understand that the foolish virgins were
[1:23:46] saved but have to go through the great
[1:23:48] tribulation period
[1:23:49] is this correct if so what will be their
[1:23:52] final destination
[1:23:54] could they be the sheep which are
[1:23:56] divided from the goats in matthew 25
[1:23:59] 33-34 a prophet
[1:24:02] says pretty good theologian according to
[1:24:05] what i
[1:24:06] i think too that they are the remnant
[1:24:09] the sleeping virgin is the remnant spoke
[1:24:11] of in revelations of the woman's seed
[1:24:13] that keep the commandments of god and
[1:24:15] have the testimony of jesus christ
[1:24:18] you bible readers know that's
[1:24:19] revelations 12.
[1:24:21] he says a woman will take a piece of
[1:24:23] goods lay it down
[1:24:25] what is what is that what she's cutting
[1:24:27] her or takes her pattern lays
[1:24:29] anywhere she desires which way she's
[1:24:31] going to cut that
[1:24:32] and then what she has left over is
[1:24:34] called the remnant
[1:24:36] but she chooses to cut it from a certain
[1:24:38] place by her own free thinking
[1:24:40] but what's left over is called that
[1:24:42] remnant now if you'll notice
[1:24:44] there was five foolish and five wise
[1:24:47] virgins
[1:24:48] all of them were virgins made out of the
[1:24:51] same material
[1:24:52] but by election god chose his bride by
[1:24:56] election
[1:24:56] before the foundation of the world put
[1:24:59] their names on the lamb's book of life
[1:25:01] slain before the foundational world
[1:25:03] before the world ever began god
[1:25:06] in his mind being infinite
[1:25:09] yes now
[1:25:13] you could say i'm i'm doing some math
[1:25:16] in my head brother and there's only
[1:25:20] three kinds of believers
[1:25:24] and the way you're talking i'm
[1:25:27] my math says you're making it four kinds
[1:25:38] now
[1:25:40] there are three kinds of believers only
[1:25:44] only but
[1:25:48] in this saved church there's two classes
[1:25:51] of people
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:58] once again i like to say that's
[1:26:01] my opinion but i also want to say backed
[1:26:04] up
[1:26:05] by a friend of mine called william
[1:26:08] miriam branham may i read it
[1:26:13] the 10 virgins and the 144 000
[1:26:16] paragraph 55 now this remnant was the
[1:26:20] sleeping virgin
[1:26:21] that he spurted the water from his mouth
[1:26:23] to make war with the remnant of the
[1:26:25] woman's seed
[1:26:26] what is a remnant you have to get these
[1:26:28] types together now
[1:26:30] there is a church which is church
[1:26:32] natural
[1:26:33] maybe i can draw it here and make it a
[1:26:35] little bit plainer so he's got a board
[1:26:37] behind him a chalkboard and he's going
[1:26:39] to start
[1:26:39] riding on it maybe i can draw it here
[1:26:42] make it a little plainer
[1:26:43] now brother neville if i take up some of
[1:26:45] your time you please forgive me
[1:26:47] brother neville says i don't have any
[1:26:52] i don't have any
[1:26:55] brother he said he don't have none to
[1:26:57] this morning give it all to me
[1:26:58] so listen close now now
[1:27:02] there is now remember that there is what
[1:27:05] the unbeliever he draws a circle on the
[1:27:08] board
[1:27:09] and he says and i'll put you b right
[1:27:11] there
[1:27:12] unbeliever and that's the sinner
[1:27:15] then there's another one which is a
[1:27:17] formal he draws another circle
[1:27:20] and i'll put fo formal church later he
[1:27:23] called it
[1:27:24] unbe the make believer
[1:27:27] and then there's another one which is
[1:27:30] the saved church he draws a third
[1:27:32] circle puts s a
[1:27:35] the saved church now keep them in mind
[1:27:39] all the time three kinds of believers
[1:27:43] he says now in this saved church there's
[1:27:46] two
[1:27:47] classes two classes of people in the
[1:27:51] same church
[1:27:52] in this church right here right here
[1:27:54] which was which was typed by christ
[1:27:57] one of them was a sleeping virgin and
[1:28:00] the other one had oil in the lamp
[1:28:03] how many remembers the story we're gonna
[1:28:06] get to it
[1:28:07] in just a minute
[1:28:12] the foolish virgin he places her
[1:28:16] in the believer's circle the believer of
[1:28:19] what of the same thing
[1:28:23] that the raptured church was believing
[1:28:25] amen it's got to be the message
[1:28:28] got to be the reveal word gotta be what
[1:28:31] god brought to us in this day
[1:28:32] got to be those from an open book glory
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:40] so we're coming down to we're seeing
[1:28:41] this foolish virgin
[1:28:44] she's a good woman
[1:28:48] she's a good woman
[1:28:52] because i say so i'd like to say
[1:28:56] yes because i say so
[1:29:00] but i also have to tell you because
[1:29:02] william branham said so
[1:29:04] the seventh seal 1963
[1:29:08] paragraph 2 25.
[1:29:11] now when he called them over there the
[1:29:14] 144
[1:29:15] 000 they were missing that's right
[1:29:18] they're not in even numbered in there
[1:29:20] and joseph and levi is put in place of
[1:29:22] dan and ephraim
[1:29:24] now you can look at there right there it
[1:29:27] is before you see
[1:29:28] and here's god's promise way back there
[1:29:30] hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:29:31] before that brother branham speaking of
[1:29:34] how this
[1:29:35] change was going to take place now what
[1:29:38] happened
[1:29:39] they were purged during the time of the
[1:29:41] awful tribulation period
[1:29:43] if god's going to purge that that virgin
[1:29:46] that was a good
[1:29:47] woman but she just failed to get oil in
[1:29:50] her lamp
[1:29:51] and he's going to perjure through
[1:29:52] persecution in there he put some tribes
[1:29:55] right in there for the same time
[1:29:56] purges them during the time of the
[1:29:58] tribulation period
[1:30:00] because it's a purging it's a judgment
[1:30:02] and look here here comes up 144 thousand
[1:30:05] after the purging of israel
[1:30:07] here comes also the sleeping virgin
[1:30:09] comes up purge and has
[1:30:10] white robes on how perfect how beautiful
[1:30:14] that is
[1:30:18] all under that sixth seal amen
[1:30:22] and the sixth seal is not only a time of
[1:30:25] tribulation
[1:30:28] the sixth seal is also a time of
[1:30:29] redemption
[1:30:32] for a hundred and forty four thousand
[1:30:34] and the foolish virgin
[1:30:36] and the six seal of prophet said is a
[1:30:38] long seal
[1:30:40] many things happening there too many to
[1:30:44] share this morning
[1:30:47] or i'll get off my subject as i've done
[1:30:49] several times already
[1:30:52] now the foolish virgin does not take the
[1:30:56] mark of the beast
[1:30:58] neither does she suffer torment in hell
[1:31:02] the fifth dimension of prison house for
[1:31:04] those who've rejected christ
[1:31:06] but instead she's on the paradise side
[1:31:09] of the fifth dimension
[1:31:11] awaiting a white throne judgment where
[1:31:13] she's a virgin
[1:31:15] where she's an eagle where she's the
[1:31:18] sheep
[1:31:19] in the parable matthew 25
[1:31:23] 31 says when the skin of man
[1:31:27] shall come in his glory and all the holy
[1:31:30] angels with him
[1:31:32] then shall he sit upon the throne
[1:31:35] of his glory
[1:31:49] and before him shall be gathered all
[1:31:51] nations
[1:31:52] and he shall separate them one from
[1:31:54] another as a shepherd divide as his
[1:31:57] sheep
[1:31:57] from the goats what is it it's the white
[1:32:01] throne
[1:32:02] where in the second resurrection every
[1:32:05] man
[1:32:06] that was ever born and died will rise up
[1:32:09] unto this judgment place here the king
[1:32:13] with his queen the bride of christ
[1:32:16] judging the nations
[1:32:18] from this tribunal from this judgment
[1:32:22] hall
[1:32:24] it's either eternal life or a lake of
[1:32:26] fire
[1:32:34] the human race has been in prison long
[1:32:37] enough
[1:32:38] it's judgment time it's time to execute
[1:32:42] judgment
[1:32:44] because the kingdom of clardon is christ
[1:32:46] is coming in amen
[1:32:50] and when the man of man shall come in
[1:32:52] his glory and all the holy angels with
[1:32:54] him
[1:32:54] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:32:57] glory
[1:32:59] and before him shall be gathered to all
[1:33:01] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:33:04] from the other
[1:33:05] as a shepherd divide as his sheep from
[1:33:07] the goats
[1:33:08] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:33:10] hand but the goats
[1:33:11] on the left for judgment begins first
[1:33:15] in the house of god amen then shall the
[1:33:19] king say unto them on his right hand
[1:33:22] there they are they're brought forth out
[1:33:25] of paradise
[1:33:26] the sheep they're brought forth out of
[1:33:28] that fifth dimension on the paradise
[1:33:30] side
[1:33:31] they're sitting in this courtroom in
[1:33:33] this tribunal with
[1:33:35] millions and billions of people
[1:33:38] and they're the first that the judge
[1:33:39] says
[1:33:42] looks at him and says you
[1:33:46] stand to your feet i'm going to read to
[1:33:49] you
[1:33:51] what you did on earth your works
[1:33:54] what you are guilty of i'm going to say
[1:33:57] it
[1:33:57] openly for all the billions in this
[1:34:00] courtroom to hear
[1:34:02] and he first goes to the sheep the
[1:34:05] foolish virgin
[1:34:07] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:34:08] right hand come
[1:34:11] stand up for the reading amen
[1:34:15] of what you did on earth of what you are
[1:34:17] guilty of
[1:34:18] and he said ye blessed of my father amen
[1:34:22] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:34:24] from the foundation of the world
[1:34:28] no doubt some of them sitting there as
[1:34:31] they stood when he said come
[1:34:33] maybe a couple of them fainted they
[1:34:34] dropped on the ground when he said it
[1:34:38] they still didn't understand the
[1:34:40] ramifications of what he was saying
[1:34:45] he said for i wasn't hungry
[1:34:49] and you gave me meat i was a thirsty
[1:34:53] and you gave me drink i was a stranger
[1:34:57] and you took me in naked and you clothed
[1:35:00] me
[1:35:01] i was sick and you visited me
[1:35:05] i look at you eyeball to eyeball and you
[1:35:08] me
[1:35:12] and i judge you thus for i don't know
[1:35:15] the intents of your heart
[1:35:17] but this judge unlike all the judges on
[1:35:21] the earth
[1:35:22] the best of judges on planet earth
[1:35:25] they don't know the heart's intent
[1:35:31] you might have done a good thing but
[1:35:33] with the wrong motive
[1:35:35] we don't know that as men on this earth
[1:35:37] but god knows
[1:35:39] if you did something good with the bad
[1:35:41] motive he knows about everything
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:46] on this day of judgment we can't hide
[1:35:51] and he says naked
[1:35:55] and you clothed me i was sick and you
[1:35:58] visited me
[1:36:00] i was in prison you came to me
[1:36:04] then shall the righteous answer
[1:36:07] him saying
[1:36:10] lord
[1:36:14] because he started with laodicea
[1:36:18] lord when saw thee
[1:36:21] we unhungered
[1:36:25] and fed i think i was born like
[1:36:28] 2500 years after you were
[1:36:34] i don't remember this
[1:36:39] when saw within hungered and fed thee
[1:36:43] or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw
[1:36:46] we thee a stranger
[1:36:48] and took the in or naked and clothing
[1:36:52] or when saw with these sick or
[1:36:54] imprisoned and came unto thee
[1:36:58] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:36:59] them verily i say unto you
[1:37:03] and as much as you've done it unto one
[1:37:05] of the least of these my brethren
[1:37:08] you've done it unto me amen
[1:37:14] the foolish virgin at the white throne
[1:37:18] judgment
[1:37:20] justified by faith sanctified
[1:37:24] by the spirit but no oil
[1:37:30] and look what they were doing on planet
[1:37:32] earth
[1:37:33] in the sincerity of their hearts
[1:37:40] the foolish virgin who is she
[1:37:44] virgin or
[1:37:48] virgin believer
[1:37:52] or unbeliever believer
[1:37:55] eagle or crow eagle
[1:37:59] sheep or goat sheep remnant of the
[1:38:03] woman's seed
[1:38:04] or serpent seed remnant of the woman's
[1:38:07] seat
[1:38:08] friend or foe this morning
[1:38:12] she's your friend i assure you
[1:38:17] let me read you once again her deeds
[1:38:20] although she misses rapturing faith in a
[1:38:23] supernatural body change
[1:38:25] at the white throne judgment the sheep
[1:38:28] of god are exonerated
[1:38:31] of all sin for their godly deeds
[1:38:36] you know that on planet earth they were
[1:38:38] doing the right thing
[1:38:41] for the right reasons god
[1:38:44] said so
[1:38:50] verse 33
[1:38:54] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:38:56] hand but the goats on the left
[1:38:59] then shall the king who looked down from
[1:39:02] heaven above
[1:39:03] who watched everything they said who
[1:39:06] knew the very intents of their hearts
[1:39:09] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:39:10] right hand come
[1:39:13] ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:39:16] kingdom prepared for you
[1:39:18] from the foundation of the world for i
[1:39:21] was in hunger
[1:39:23] and you gave me meat i was thirsty
[1:39:27] and you gave me drink i was a stranger
[1:39:32] and you took me in naked
[1:39:35] and you clothed me i was sick
[1:39:39] and you visited me i was in prison and
[1:39:42] you came unto me
[1:39:44] then shall the righteous answer him
[1:39:46] saying lord when saw we thee and
[1:39:48] hungered and fed thee
[1:39:49] or thirsty and gave thee drink when
[1:39:52] shall we clear a stranger and took the
[1:39:54] inn or naked and clothing or when saw
[1:39:58] with these sick were imprisoned and came
[1:40:00] unto thee
[1:40:02] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:40:04] them barely i say unto me
[1:40:06] you in as much as you have done to one
[1:40:08] of the least of my brethren
[1:40:10] you have done it on to me
[1:40:16] what a lady what a woman
[1:40:23] she busied herself
[1:40:26] on planet earth in the churches and the
[1:40:30] assemblies that she was in
[1:40:33] doing all these things for the brethren
[1:40:36] for the children for the sisters for
[1:40:38] those in prison for those without food
[1:40:40] for those that were naked
[1:40:51] my
[1:40:56] what a woman she was
[1:41:02] and she was who the foolish
[1:41:07] the foolish did this thus
[1:41:11] saith the lord the foolish lived this
[1:41:13] way
[1:41:17] what were the wise doing
[1:41:25] i know what the y's for doing
[1:41:29] but i don't know if i have time to tell
[1:41:31] you
[1:41:33] you may have to wait another year
[1:41:38] would you like to know
[1:41:41] the wise were doing
[1:41:45] exactly the same thing
[1:41:49] the wise and the foolish
[1:41:53] on planet earth are indistinguishable
[1:42:00] they're believers they're virgin
[1:42:03] they're eagles
[1:42:12] one difference that only god can see
[1:42:18] one had the oil and one didn't
[1:42:24] but they had begun in this process in
[1:42:27] this plan of salvation
[1:42:30] in these three steps of grace both were
[1:42:33] justified by faith
[1:42:36] genuine experience both were sanctified
[1:42:39] by the spirit
[1:42:40] genuine experience but
[1:42:43] one of them had received the baptism of
[1:42:46] the holy ghost
[1:42:48] which which called them culminated
[1:42:53] the born again experienced for them and
[1:42:56] begin them in a journey
[1:43:00] called the adoption of sons and
[1:43:02] daughters of god
[1:43:05] amen and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:08] is just the earnest of this adoption
[1:43:13] what follows is more oil
[1:43:16] in the vessel and that's called
[1:43:20] the refilling of the spirit
[1:43:24] a prophet told us one holy ghost baptism
[1:43:28] many refillings throughout your
[1:43:30] christian walk
[1:43:31] it's the way of adoption what is the
[1:43:34] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:36] it's a friendship restored with a father
[1:43:39] like adam head
[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:43:50] it's a friendship restored with the
[1:43:51] father
[1:43:53] like adam had
[1:44:04] preachers and sometimes those who think
[1:44:07] they are
[1:44:09] have used this parable to try
[1:44:13] to discern who is foolish and who is
[1:44:16] wise
[1:44:18] they think because they're preachers
[1:44:21] they have a license to do so that's
[1:44:23] right
[1:44:25] let me tell you this
[1:44:28] they've wasted their time and they've
[1:44:30] wasted the time of their people and
[1:44:32] congregations
[1:44:34] and completely missed the reason for the
[1:44:37] parable
[1:44:39] for the parable is indeed to provoke a
[1:44:42] very personal question
[1:44:45] that you must ask yourselves or allow me
[1:44:48] to ask
[1:44:52] or let's let my friend ask you
[1:44:56] the apostle paul
[1:45:00] a brother once asked me have you ever
[1:45:03] been to jerusalem
[1:45:06] he had just come back i said yes
[1:45:10] he said really
[1:45:14] how often you've been there a thousand
[1:45:16] times
[1:45:17] and i'm actually going back tonight
[1:45:25] so i know jerusalem well and i've
[1:45:28] learned
[1:45:29] i know paul well well he's a friend my
[1:45:32] friend
[1:45:34] like you are my friends he's a friend
[1:45:37] acts 19 and one
[1:45:42] and it came to pass that while apollos
[1:45:44] was at corinth
[1:45:46] paul having passed through the upper
[1:45:47] coast came to ephesus
[1:45:49] and finding certain disciples he said
[1:45:52] unto them
[1:45:54] have you received the holy ghost
[1:45:57] since you believe
[1:46:02] and he said unto them
[1:46:05] and they said unto him we have not so
[1:46:08] much as heard
[1:46:10] whether there be any holy ghost
[1:46:20] like this morning you might say i didn't
[1:46:23] even know the foolish virgin were
[1:46:25] in the message because they're called
[1:46:27] foolish
[1:46:32] but the definition of foolish as the
[1:46:35] bible speaks to them
[1:46:36] you cannot find it in a dictionary
[1:46:40] whether it's spanish or english or
[1:46:42] french
[1:46:47] to the spanish brethren i tell them
[1:46:52] dictionaries
[1:47:00] and he said unto them what then
[1:47:03] were you baptized they said unto john's
[1:47:06] baptism
[1:47:08] paul said john verily
[1:47:11] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[1:47:18] saying unto the people that they should
[1:47:21] believe on him
[1:47:22] that should come after him that is on
[1:47:24] christ jesus
[1:47:28] you see they were followers of john they
[1:47:31] had been baptized
[1:47:33] unto repentance
[1:47:37] but they still didn't realize they
[1:47:40] hadn't yet heard the message preach
[1:47:44] what the holy ghost is for
[1:47:49] they hadn't come across that tape
[1:47:53] but they came across one of the tape
[1:47:55] boys paul
[1:47:57] and he said unto them
[1:48:00] john verily baptized with a baptism of
[1:48:02] repentance saying unto the people
[1:48:04] that they should believe on him which
[1:48:06] should come
[1:48:07] after him that's what the forerunner
[1:48:11] said then
[1:48:13] that's what the forerunner said in our
[1:48:14] day
[1:48:17] that they should believe on him which
[1:48:19] would come after him
[1:48:21] that is
[1:48:24] jesus christ
[1:48:29] not a return ministry of the same man
[1:48:36] but the one who's riding this trail
[1:48:38] again
[1:48:39] is the son of man jesus christ in our
[1:48:42] hearts
[1:48:44] that they should believe on him that
[1:48:46] should come after him
[1:48:47] that is on christ jesus when they heard
[1:48:50] this
[1:48:51] they were baptized
[1:48:54] not in the name of the father and of the
[1:48:56] son of the holy ghost
[1:48:58] now they had a revelation now they knew
[1:49:01] who the man was
[1:49:02] and they were baptized in the name of
[1:49:04] the lord jesus christ
[1:49:06] who is the father the son and the holy
[1:49:08] ghost but one was the parable
[1:49:10] now we have a revelation now we
[1:49:14] [Applause]
[1:49:18] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[1:49:21] them
[1:49:22] the holy ghost came on them and they
[1:49:24] spake with tongues
[1:49:26] and prophesied and
[1:49:30] all the men
[1:49:33] were about 12.
[1:49:37] just 12.
[1:49:42] so god took the messenger to an age
[1:49:47] god took a man a prophet
[1:49:50] and more than a prophet
[1:49:54] and instead of going to some big meeting
[1:49:56] at corinth with the policy
[1:49:58] he said i have need to go by samaria
[1:50:03] because sometimes it's not even 12.
[1:50:05] sometimes it's one little lady
[1:50:08] lost in sin without hope but inside her
[1:50:11] heart is a germ seed word of god
[1:50:14] an attribute that was in god before the
[1:50:16] foundation of the world
[1:50:17] you were in his mind while he was on
[1:50:21] that cross
[1:50:23] and you're on his heart this morning
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:36] acts 2 and verse 36
[1:50:40] therefore let all the house of israel
[1:50:42] know assuredly
[1:50:44] that god had made that same jesus
[1:50:48] whom ye have crucified both lord and
[1:50:51] christ
[1:50:55] because you were the bow he told ezra
[1:50:57] with no arrows
[1:51:00] seeking a way to crucify him
[1:51:04] then you joined yourself to the crown of
[1:51:06] rome
[1:51:07] and together you went conquering and to
[1:51:11] conquer
[1:51:12] and yet every bit in the plan of god
[1:51:17] not out of control everything working
[1:51:20] exactly according to god's word
[1:51:23] for redemption for you for restoration
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:32] therefore let all the house of israel
[1:51:34] know assuredly
[1:51:36] that god hath made that same jesus whom
[1:51:39] ye have crucified
[1:51:40] both lord and christ now when they heard
[1:51:43] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:51:45] and they said unto peter to the rest of
[1:51:47] the apostles
[1:51:48] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:51:53] then peter said unto them repent
[1:51:57] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:52:00] name of jesus christ
[1:52:02] for the remission of sins
[1:52:07] and ye shall receive
[1:52:10] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:52:15] if there's someone here this morning
[1:52:18] who has yet to give their life to jesus
[1:52:24] who hasn't been baptized in that
[1:52:26] precious name
[1:52:31] i say let not your heart be hardened
[1:52:35] as it was in the day of the provocation
[1:52:38] but today this morning
[1:52:42] move out of the foolish realm
[1:52:46] and walk into the wise
[1:52:49] and repent and be baptized in jesus name
[1:52:54] why brother daniel because then he is
[1:52:57] obligated
[1:52:59] to give you the holy ghost
[1:53:03] he'll pour oil in your land
[1:53:07] he'll give you victory in your christian
[1:53:11] life
[1:53:12] he'll give you overcoming power over the
[1:53:15] lust of the flesh and the lust of the
[1:53:16] heart
[1:53:17] and the pride of life
[1:53:24] so the purpose of this parable
[1:53:28] is have i received the holy ghost
[1:53:31] since i believed and how long has it
[1:53:35] been
[1:53:36] since i've received the refilling of the
[1:53:39] blessed holy spirit
[1:53:43] this morning you could ask yourself
[1:53:48] is there foolish amongst us wise and
[1:53:51] foolish
[1:53:53] prophetically speaking yes
[1:53:58] in reality god has given us
[1:54:03] you this morning a space of time
[1:54:09] for they were truly foolish
[1:54:13] when a rapture took place
[1:54:17] but until a rapture takes place if you
[1:54:22] need a refilling
[1:54:24] it's available this morning and if you
[1:54:27] need the holy ghost
[1:54:29] it's available this morning
[1:54:33] i want to believe with our brother
[1:54:35] brought tape that there isn't three
[1:54:37] kinds of believers
[1:54:40] within the reach of my voice
[1:54:43] but there's just two classes of people
[1:54:45] this morning
[1:54:49] you received the baptism of the holy
[1:54:51] ghost
[1:54:53] maybe many years ago
[1:54:57] for me it was october the 8th
[1:55:02] 1974.
[1:55:09] but this morning i need a refilling of
[1:55:13] that same baptism
[1:55:19] what mature believer
[1:55:22] who's had that experience could just
[1:55:25] slip up their hand and say
[1:55:27] refilling lord jesus amen refilling lord
[1:55:30] jesus
[1:55:34] now what if
[1:55:39] you've never received it
[1:55:44] and you know you need that holy ghost
[1:55:46] experience
[1:55:48] would there be someone say brother
[1:55:51] daniel
[1:55:54] i don't have it i've not received it
[1:56:01] i won't ask you to slip up your hand
[1:56:05] i'll ask you to close your eyes say lord
[1:56:08] jesus
[1:56:10] i need the baptism
[1:56:13] of the holy ghost this morning
[1:56:18] and i want it and it's easy to ask for
[1:56:23] because he promised it
[1:56:28] first corinthians chapter 1
[1:56:33] and verse 23 but we preach christ
[1:56:36] crucified unto the jews a stumbling
[1:56:40] block
[1:56:41] unto the greeks foolishness but unto
[1:56:44] them
[1:56:44] which are called both jews and greeks
[1:56:50] christ the power of god and the wisdom
[1:56:53] of god because to receive him this
[1:56:57] morning
[1:56:58] are we feeling for the baptism for the
[1:57:01] first time
[1:57:03] is the wisdom of god for you
[1:57:08] because the foolish foolishness of god
[1:57:10] is wiser than men
[1:57:12] even the foolish virgin is wiser than
[1:57:15] the men of this world
[1:57:18] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[1:57:21] men
[1:57:22] even in their weakness
[1:57:25] as the foolish they were stronger
[1:57:29] but you don't have to stay that way this
[1:57:30] morning
[1:57:32] there's a fountain in the house of david
[1:57:35] i'm telling you
[1:57:38] come drink buy without money without
[1:57:42] price
[1:57:45] give your life a willing testimony
[1:57:49] a sacrifice
[1:57:53] for he gave his life a sacrifice for you
[1:57:58] in romans chapter one
[1:58:01] beginning at verse three concerning his
[1:58:04] son jesus christ
[1:58:06] our lord which was made of the seed of
[1:58:08] david
[1:58:09] according to the flesh and declared to
[1:58:12] be the son of god with power
[1:58:15] according to the spirit of holiness by
[1:58:18] the resurrection from the dead
[1:58:23] paul said i am adapter
[1:58:27] both to the greeks and to the barbarians
[1:58:32] both to the wise and to the unwise
[1:58:39] so that old time pastoral saying brother
[1:58:42] blond when a tired old pastor puts his
[1:58:46] hands in his hips they get to be about
[1:58:48] 64 years old
[1:58:50] and they say i sure need some low
[1:58:53] maintenance sheep
[1:58:59] it's funny but it ain't right
[1:59:02] no we are called to be depthers
[1:59:06] both to the wise and to the unwise
[1:59:09] so as much as in me is i'm ready to
[1:59:13] preach the gospel to you
[1:59:15] that are here in minneapolis also
[1:59:20] amen for i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:59:22] of christ
[1:59:24] for is the power of god unto salvation
[1:59:26] to everyone that could believe this
[1:59:28] morning
[1:59:30] for therein is the righteousness of god
[1:59:32] revealed
[1:59:34] from faith to faith as it is written
[1:59:38] the just shall live by faith
[1:59:43] justification by faith
[1:59:46] sanctification by the spirit

[2:00:44] bloody lambskins
[2:00:48] from the minute he walked out of his
[2:00:50] presence

[2:04:47] brother
[2:04:50] feeling like i just can't get through

[2:05:05] you take the last paper you had and you
[2:05:08] you crunch it up you look for the
[2:05:10] wastebasket
[2:05:13] and just then the holy spirit drops down
[2:05:18] and he tells me pick up your pen
[2:05:21] and now right and this is what he told
[2:05:25] me

[2:05:47] come true it's not a busy place where
[2:05:50] the multitudes abide

[2:05:55] bride
[2:05:56] and groom reside
[2:05:59] i know it's the best way and yet i try
[2:06:02] it last
[2:06:05] it was my testimony
[2:06:08] i know it's the best way and yet i try
[2:06:11] it last
[2:06:12] only to be defeated by satan's ugly
[2:06:15] blast
[2:06:16] i dedicate myself again to the prayer
[2:06:20] closet with my friend
[2:06:22] who listens so attentively to every word
[2:06:25] i say
[2:06:27] but when i listen quietly to every word
[2:06:29] he speaks
[2:06:30] it gives me all the strength i need to
[2:06:33] hear him say
[2:06:35] you're free
[2:06:39] free from the sickness

[2:07:13] with all my heart
[2:07:16] that to this house of god
[2:07:19] through this year of 2021
[2:07:23] you are bringing freedom
[2:07:27] you are casting down all fear
[2:07:30] and you're wanting to replace it with
[2:07:32] the love of god in their hearts
[2:07:34] that they might live this clear a year
[2:07:36] of victory
[2:07:39] not moved by the things of this world
[2:07:42] not caught away in the pleasures
[2:07:46] not made sad by the bad news they hear
[2:07:50] because they've received the good news
[2:07:52] of the gospel
[2:07:53] of which we are not ashamed
[2:07:57] we ask lord that you would quicken to
[2:07:59] every heart
[2:08:00] that you give refillings to those who
[2:08:05] desire that you would baptize with the
[2:08:08] holy ghost
[2:08:10] those who are hungry and thirsty for
[2:08:12] righteousness
[2:08:14] may there no one leave this building the
[2:08:16] way they came in
[2:08:18] but may everyone leave with another
[2:08:20] measure of oil in their vessels
[2:08:22] their lie their lambs trimmed and the
[2:08:24] fire of god burning in their hearts
[2:08:28] and we'll be sure lord to give you all
[2:08:29] the honor
[2:08:31] all the glory and all the praise
[2:08:34] in that beautiful name of jesus
[2:08:38] we thank you god bless you

[2:10:10] friendship with jesus let your saying
[2:10:12] friendship with jesus
[2:10:13] fellowship divine
[2:10:17] we want to just thank the lord for the
[2:10:20] message
[2:10:21] amen are you grateful this
[2:10:24] afternoon that god can speak to you like
[2:10:27] this
[2:10:29] of his choice let me say this to you uh
[2:10:32] uh i was just talking to
[2:10:36] a brother yesterday and we were
[2:10:38] fellowshipping and i told him
[2:10:40] i say among all
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:44] the relationship you can have on earth
[2:10:47] there are stages
[2:10:49] but yet friendship is the middle
[2:10:54] relationship
[2:10:56] you look through the scripture god
[2:10:58] related to israel our sevens through the
[2:11:01] old testament
[2:11:03] they came to the new testament
[2:11:05] [Music]
[2:11:06] he says now i call you friends
[2:11:11] you no longer my seven i call you french
[2:11:14] and before he resurrected he said you
[2:11:16] are my brethrens
[2:11:18] so friendship was right between seven
[2:11:21] and and
[2:11:22] and brotherhood
[2:11:26] it's very important
[2:11:29] before you get married you have to have
[2:11:31] a good friendship
[2:11:33] praise the lord i can never be so
[2:11:36] successful to you as a pastor if i don't
[2:11:38] have a good friendship
[2:11:41] sometimes even in parenting
[2:11:46] you need to have friendship with your
[2:11:50] children
[2:11:52] it's a relationship that
[2:11:56] you have to you don't look to the next
[2:11:58] person
[2:11:59] you have to tell yourself because
[2:12:01] solomon said he that won't frame
[2:12:05] must be friendly
[2:12:08] so you don't tell the other person you
[2:12:09] got to be friendly you have to put the
[2:12:11] work
[2:12:12] in to be friendly
[2:12:15] it's a very very important
[2:12:18] relationship
[2:12:23] and that god will come down to be our
[2:12:26] friend
[2:12:28] what a blessing
[2:12:33] what a blessing
[2:12:37] as we go into the new year
[2:12:41] and with the message that was preached
[2:12:44] to us
[2:12:46] this morning what house will you build
[2:12:48] me
[2:12:49] i just want to encourage you to say
[2:12:53] our attitude matters
[2:12:54] [Music]
[2:12:58] and no matter what attitude you have
[2:13:03] it shows how much you appreciate
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:08] what you have as the message of the hour
[2:13:12] your attitude to god show how much you
[2:13:15] appreciate him
[2:13:17] your attitude to others show how much
[2:13:21] you appreciate our attitude
[2:13:26] is very important just like but then you
[2:13:29] preach
[2:13:32] we have class people we have
[2:13:36] condemned people all because of our
[2:13:39] attitude
[2:13:40] or because we think we are better than
[2:13:42] them
[2:13:44] but when we begin to start learning
[2:13:47] to appreciate god and what he has done
[2:13:51] for us
[2:13:53] it will change your attitude
[2:13:57] it will change your attitude
[2:14:00] praise the lord and that's the reason
[2:14:03] why you realize i say this over and over
[2:14:06] sometimes you work with people when they
[2:14:09] really get on the edge and you're angry
[2:14:12] you know this is well you know i don't
[2:14:14] care for anybody i just said my god
[2:14:17] you know and people just take that kind
[2:14:19] of attitude because they want to be so
[2:14:21] self-centered you know it's maybe
[2:14:25] just they feel so lonely on an island
[2:14:28] and and they think that you know that it
[2:14:31] shouldn't have any time
[2:14:33] for for anybody but as
[2:14:36] as i listened to the message this
[2:14:37] morning you know
[2:14:40] just appreciate
[2:14:43] and and just like we said
[2:14:48] internal life brother branham said is
[2:14:50] living for others
[2:14:53] it's what we do for others that's what
[2:14:56] matters to god
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:15:01] what we do for others
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:06] as we you know think about all of this
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:12] and uh the invitation was given
[2:15:17] for those that uh
[2:15:22] need the holy ghost
