[1:09:49] you love the lord this morning
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] thankful for his mercy and his grace yes
[1:09:55] thankful for the songs that have been
[1:09:57] sung this morning
[1:10:00] i thank god for
[1:10:03] you know we read the scripture last
[1:10:04] night
[1:10:06] said this didn't come by the will of man
[1:10:11] the holy men of god were moved
[1:10:13] by the spirit
[1:10:15] and they spake as they were moved and
[1:10:17] yes
[1:10:18] so
[1:10:20] i didn't really expect brother stephen
[1:10:21] to be here this morning
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:26] but i really wanted to hear him sing and
[1:10:28] he was moved on by the spirit to read a
[1:10:30] quote
[1:10:31] and it couldn't that quote could not go
[1:10:34] any more perfect with what the lord laid
[1:10:35] on my heart than any other quote in the
[1:10:37] message
[1:10:39] so i'm just thankful for it
[1:10:41] and uh
[1:10:42] man it's just uh it's good to be back
[1:10:44] with you again and
[1:10:46] i see some southern folks here that's
[1:10:49] are y'all back north now
[1:10:51] you're still southern
[1:10:56] right well i'm still alone i guess kind
[1:10:59] of so
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:03] if we could this this morning let's just
[1:11:05] turn to the book of ephesians chapter 3
[1:11:07] and
[1:11:09] just thank you for the fellowship and
[1:11:11] thank brother
[1:11:12] blattay once again for the invitation
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:18] i wanted to say i forgot to mention last
[1:11:20] night but man the church looks great
[1:11:23] i think
[1:11:25] covert was a blessing in disguise we we
[1:11:27] kind of did the same thing we remodeled
[1:11:29] our church back home and kind of went
[1:11:31] with the same color scheme as you guys
[1:11:33] and uh so it looks really good
[1:11:36] ephesians chapter 3 verse 13.
[1:11:40] it says wherefore i desire that you
[1:11:42] faint not at my tribulations for you
[1:11:45] which is for your glory
[1:11:48] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[1:11:50] father of our lord jesus christ
[1:11:54] of whom the whole family
[1:11:57] in heaven and earth
[1:11:58] is named and you can be seated this
[1:12:01] morning
[1:12:05] as i said that quote brother stephen
[1:12:07] read was perfect it was talking about
[1:12:08] coming back into unity and
[1:12:11] uh
[1:12:12] so i want to take a
[1:12:13] message this morning i want to title it
[1:12:17] the family of god
[1:12:19] uh you know we we have to come to an
[1:12:22] understanding that we're all part of the
[1:12:24] same family
[1:12:26] and uh once birthed
[1:12:29] by the blood
[1:12:30] we become no more uh you know my name's
[1:12:32] farmer and brother stephen's name is
[1:12:34] carlin and we don't become
[1:12:36] farmer and carlin and brother juan but
[1:12:39] we become miss jesus christ
[1:12:42] and so i i want to look at this where it
[1:12:45] says here
[1:12:47] um
[1:12:49] family this word family of whom the
[1:12:51] whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:12:52] named
[1:12:53] the word family in the greek it says it
[1:12:56] means lineage
[1:12:58] or ancestry
[1:13:00] it says it means a group of families all
[1:13:02] those who in a given people lay claim to
[1:13:05] a common origin
[1:13:07] i begin to think about this that if we
[1:13:09] were to just go around the room some of
[1:13:11] us would say well uh uh we originated
[1:13:14] from you know my family we originated
[1:13:16] from germany and you know some of you
[1:13:19] originated from
[1:13:20] uh your part in africa uh some of you
[1:13:23] would say well all i know is i'm from
[1:13:25] minnesota uh some of us would say well
[1:13:28] i'm a northerner some would say i would
[1:13:30] say i'm a southerner but what we come to
[1:13:33] find out is that none of these things
[1:13:35] matter
[1:13:36] what we what the word has come to do is
[1:13:39] to place us as sons and to let us
[1:13:42] recognize that we all have the same
[1:13:44] origin and that origin is where we were
[1:13:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:51] so
[1:13:51] uh i i don't know about up here but down
[1:13:54] in our area uh ancestry.com is is
[1:13:58] everybody's wanting to know where did i
[1:13:59] come from who was our grandparents where
[1:14:02] you know uh uh what nation do we come
[1:14:04] out of and so i went to ancestry.com
[1:14:08] and the slogan on the top of their page
[1:14:09] says every family has a story
[1:14:13] and so i began to think that you know uh
[1:14:16] the farmers have a story farmers are hot
[1:14:19] tempered uh heart attacks run in the
[1:14:22] family strokes run in the family so i
[1:14:25] begin to think that i really don't want
[1:14:27] to lay claim to the origin of the farmer
[1:14:30] family and and you know uh uh we've got
[1:14:33] some family members that you know i mean
[1:14:36] drugs kind of run in the family and you
[1:14:38] know uh addiction to pills and things
[1:14:40] like that and so i thought i don't want
[1:14:42] to lay claim to that but i would like to
[1:14:44] lay claim to the real family
[1:14:47] the seed of abraham
[1:14:49] the the lineage of jesus christ that's
[1:14:53] the claim that i want to leave
[1:14:56] so i want to look every family has a
[1:14:58] story so i want to look at where our
[1:15:00] story begins john chapter 1 verse 1
[1:15:05] and it says in the beginning
[1:15:09] now we find and i just want to stop here
[1:15:11] we find genesis 1 1 says in the
[1:15:14] beginning but we understand that's a
[1:15:15] different beginning
[1:15:17] and brother branham addresses this he
[1:15:19] says you can't go any further back
[1:15:21] mentally speaking than the beginning
[1:15:24] that's mentally speaking
[1:15:26] but this morning we want to get out of
[1:15:28] our mind
[1:15:29] and let the mind that was in christ come
[1:15:31] into us we want to get out of this
[1:15:34] mental capacity and the things around us
[1:15:37] are things of the world and when we go
[1:15:38] we want to go back because john 1 1 was
[1:15:41] before there was a world
[1:15:44] but it says in the beginning was
[1:15:46] the word
[1:15:48] in the beginning before there was man's
[1:15:50] idea before there was thought of man
[1:15:52] brother stephen there was just word
[1:15:54] that was what was in the beginning
[1:15:56] but he says the word
[1:15:59] was with god
[1:16:01] so there was a being
[1:16:03] in the beginning that was so much word
[1:16:06] that when john looked at it and i
[1:16:08] believe that to be christ that he said
[1:16:10] that that the word
[1:16:13] was with god
[1:16:14] but also the word was god so you have
[1:16:18] god which is a spirit then you have
[1:16:21] christ the manifestation of the spirit
[1:16:24] of god
[1:16:25] and the word was with god and the word
[1:16:28] was god but now i want to go to verse 2
[1:16:31] and include you and i in this chapter
[1:16:36] he says the same
[1:16:38] was in the beginning with god so now
[1:16:41] look here's john looking into the
[1:16:42] heavens and he goes wait a minute i see
[1:16:44] the word
[1:16:46] i see more word that's in the beginning
[1:16:49] with the word
[1:16:50] but then he sees a bride body and he
[1:16:53] says now i see something that is so much
[1:16:57] word that all i can say is it's the same
[1:17:00] thing when john saw the bride the bride
[1:17:04] and christ and the word were won
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:08] he said all things were made by him and
[1:17:11] without him was not anything made that
[1:17:13] was made
[1:17:15] in him was life and the life was the
[1:17:18] light of men
[1:17:20] brother branham said in the beginning
[1:17:21] before there was a world
[1:17:23] before there was a star
[1:17:25] before there was a sun a moon or
[1:17:27] anything else that's in the beginning
[1:17:31] hebrews 11 and 14
[1:17:35] it says for they
[1:17:36] speaking about the fathers of faith
[1:17:40] for they that say such things declare
[1:17:42] plainly
[1:17:43] that they seek a country
[1:17:46] how many seek in a country
[1:17:50] i like verse 15 it says and truly if
[1:17:53] they had been mindful
[1:17:55] of that country from whence they came
[1:17:57] out they might have had opportunity to
[1:18:00] have returned
[1:18:02] and the word mindful means to be aware
[1:18:04] of something of importance
[1:18:07] so
[1:18:08] the scripture is telling us that they
[1:18:10] were seeking to go to another country
[1:18:12] abraham sought for a country not made
[1:18:15] with a man's hand
[1:18:17] and so now the scripture says what
[1:18:20] abraham needed was to be mindful that he
[1:18:23] was already in that country
[1:18:26] and so i begin to look at when you if
[1:18:29] you're we need to be mindful of where we
[1:18:32] came from
[1:18:33] brother branham tells the story about
[1:18:35] the old man you remember he said he went
[1:18:37] to the meeting there and he said all
[1:18:39] these preachers were preaching about
[1:18:41] things that was going on down here on
[1:18:42] the earth right
[1:18:44] he said but one old man got up there and
[1:18:47] said he was a bald-headed couldn't
[1:18:50] hardly walk walk him with a cane right
[1:18:52] old and he said but he wasn't preaching
[1:18:56] about what was going down here on the
[1:18:58] earth
[1:18:59] he said but he went way back billions of
[1:19:02] years before there ever was a world now
[1:19:05] watch what happens when this old man old
[1:19:10] walking with a cane
[1:19:11] when he gets his eye off of what's going
[1:19:14] on on the earth
[1:19:16] and he gets his mindset on the heavens
[1:19:19] and what happened before the foundation
[1:19:21] of the world
[1:19:22] the prophet says the old man with a cane
[1:19:25] jumps up in the air
[1:19:27] clicks his heels together and says
[1:19:29] there's not enough room for me on the
[1:19:31] pulpit i begin to think that if looking
[1:19:34] before the foundation of the world would
[1:19:36] cause a 90 year old man to dance in the
[1:19:39] spirit
[1:19:40] what audit to do to us to look and see
[1:19:43] where were we
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:49] one time job was going through
[1:19:52] a battle
[1:19:53] and you know we go through trials
[1:19:56] sometimes we act like you know i
[1:19:57] preached a message on trials back home
[1:20:00] and i read the scripture it says don't
[1:20:01] think that some strange thing happened
[1:20:03] to you right sometimes we go through a
[1:20:05] struggle and we we we act like you know
[1:20:08] it just
[1:20:09] it's mind-blowing
[1:20:11] that we would have to go through a trial
[1:20:13] and the bible said don't think that it's
[1:20:15] something strange
[1:20:17] don't think that it's strange that cove
[1:20:19] had happened
[1:20:21] don't think that it's strange that you
[1:20:22] lost your job
[1:20:24] don't think that it's strange that the
[1:20:25] car breaks down don't think that it's
[1:20:28] strange that church trouble happens
[1:20:30] these things are going to happen
[1:20:34] he said let me just go back to this if
[1:20:36] they had been mindful of that country
[1:20:38] from which they came out
[1:20:40] they might have had opportunity to have
[1:20:41] returned
[1:20:43] so the entrance
[1:20:45] into
[1:20:47] that country
[1:20:49] is the mindset
[1:20:51] that you came out of it
[1:20:54] now watch this
[1:20:56] brother branham says and you can look
[1:20:58] this up
[1:20:59] quote before the foundation
[1:21:02] he says it 519 times
[1:21:09] that shook me brother stephen
[1:21:12] that brother branham over 500 times
[1:21:16] pointed our mindset
[1:21:18] to not what was going on here
[1:21:21] but something that happened before the
[1:21:23] foundation of the world
[1:21:25] now watch this he says that's the way we
[1:21:28] are here we come from a higher being
[1:21:31] in the beginning
[1:21:32] we were in the image of god
[1:21:34] the veil and the darkness keeps us from
[1:21:37] knowing it now but jesus told his
[1:21:39] disciples he was with them before the
[1:21:42] foundation of the world see we were you
[1:21:46] can't know it now but you was in the
[1:21:48] beginning and if this earthly tabernacle
[1:21:52] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:21:56] hallelujah then we move into this
[1:21:59] theophany watch i says this where we
[1:22:03] once lived
[1:22:05] you're actually trying to go back
[1:22:09] to where you already lived at
[1:22:13] hallelujah now i want to go back to the
[1:22:15] story i left off
[1:22:17] god comes to job in the midst of job's
[1:22:20] trials
[1:22:21] and he did not say job do you remember
[1:22:24] when i gave you children
[1:22:27] because job's final anchor was not in
[1:22:30] children
[1:22:32] he did not say job do you remember when
[1:22:34] i gave you the oxen because job's final
[1:22:37] anchor was not in oxen but he said joe
[1:22:41] do you remember
[1:22:43] before the earth was formed when the
[1:22:47] morning stars were shouting and all the
[1:22:50] sons of god shouted for joy job where
[1:22:54] were you
[1:22:56] the only way to overcome the trial of
[1:23:00] this flesh is to understand i have
[1:23:04] another tabernacle
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:11] he said then we move into this theophany
[1:23:15] where
[1:23:16] we once lived
[1:23:18] now you want to know where spirits come
[1:23:21] from i want you to understand every
[1:23:22] spirit that you combat it has a
[1:23:24] beginning
[1:23:26] there's a history for it
[1:23:28] brother branham says
[1:23:30] we realize that satan in the beginning
[1:23:32] set up a kingdom in the northlands
[1:23:35] to be more beautiful than what michael
[1:23:36] was
[1:23:38] and there was a day that he declared war
[1:23:40] in heaven
[1:23:41] and he pulled two-thirds of the angelic
[1:23:44] beings with him
[1:23:46] now i want you to look at this here we
[1:23:48] are brother branham says we were there
[1:23:51] in the beginning
[1:23:52] he said we were made in the image of god
[1:23:55] he told job we were shouting we were
[1:23:57] worshiping we were singing
[1:23:59] let me tell you if we're going to shout
[1:24:01] and worship and sing over there i think
[1:24:02] we ought to do it here
[1:24:06] you know the way that you can show
[1:24:07] you're a son is that you remember we
[1:24:09] were supposed to be shouting right
[1:24:11] that's right
[1:24:12] but satan's goal from the beginning was
[1:24:16] to break up the family
[1:24:19] watch what he does he gets jealous
[1:24:23] and now he wants to be like god
[1:24:26] he's not satisfied
[1:24:28] with pointing worship to god
[1:24:30] now he wants worship to himself have we
[1:24:32] not seen that around the message
[1:24:35] come on have we not seen men that want
[1:24:36] worship to themselves
[1:24:38] we have we have seen men that i'm the
[1:24:40] only one that's got it right and i'm the
[1:24:42] only one you've got to come to me to get
[1:24:44] the word let me tell you that is a
[1:24:46] lucifer spirit on a man
[1:24:50] right that's right
[1:24:52] so brother madam says satan
[1:24:54] never changes his tactic
[1:24:56] neither does god
[1:24:58] it just changes ages
[1:25:00] he said but what satan got in back there
[1:25:03] to the first family of god on earth here
[1:25:06] it is brother sister don't fail to get
[1:25:09] this now brother branham says don't fail
[1:25:11] to get this i cannot really start
[1:25:13] listening
[1:25:15] he said how did satan get to the first
[1:25:17] family
[1:25:18] he could break it no other way but to
[1:25:21] get the word broke
[1:25:23] for they were fortified behind that word
[1:25:27] and i like the way brother branham says
[1:25:29] this he doesn't say that he broke the
[1:25:30] wall of the word down he said if he
[1:25:32] could only get one gap
[1:25:37] you see satan is not looking for every
[1:25:39] wall around you to be broke down
[1:25:41] satan is walking for one little entrance
[1:25:45] one little root of bitterness
[1:25:52] god just preached here for a minute
[1:25:55] there was a brother in our church one
[1:25:56] time we we had a man that he he had went
[1:25:59] out and sinned and he came back and he
[1:26:00] repented
[1:26:02] he wanted to be reunited with his family
[1:26:04] and this brother comes to him and he
[1:26:05] says brother i want you to understand
[1:26:07] something i will never forgive you
[1:26:13] and so our pastor was talking with him
[1:26:15] and he said brother why are you why are
[1:26:17] you so
[1:26:18] adamant to not forgive this brother you
[1:26:20] know it just really wasn't making sense
[1:26:23] and the lord began to show our pastor
[1:26:25] something out of his history
[1:26:27] and he said brother you're not angry
[1:26:28] with this man
[1:26:30] he said you're angry about what your
[1:26:32] father did 40 years ago
[1:26:37] and the brother admitted brother stephen
[1:26:39] he said yes he said my dad has been dead
[1:26:42] for 15 years and i'm still bitter in my
[1:26:44] heart toward him
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:47] and the root of bitterness sometimes
[1:26:50] will be so i don't know why i'm here but
[1:26:52] the root of bitterness will be so
[1:26:54] engulfed in ourselves
[1:26:56] that it defines we cannot even we can't
[1:26:59] have friends hardly because of roots of
[1:27:02] bitterness we cannot lean on our brother
[1:27:04] and sister we cannot even fellowship
[1:27:06] freely with one another because of all
[1:27:08] roots that are still hanging around i
[1:27:11] say god come by this morning and root
[1:27:14] out everything
[1:27:15] if there
[1:27:17] laying there that's wrong god root it
[1:27:18] out
[1:27:22] he said he's just looking for one gap
[1:27:25] he said that's how he got every church
[1:27:27] in every age
[1:27:29] he just got that one gap he said well i
[1:27:31] believe the bible is right but i don't
[1:27:33] believe that
[1:27:34] and there he'd go too bad but there he
[1:27:36] went he said it's every word
[1:27:38] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:27:42] now i'll mention this last night about
[1:27:44] eve in the garden but watch what happens
[1:27:48] the only way
[1:27:50] that satan could enter into the human
[1:27:52] race was by the breaking of a blood cell
[1:27:56] and the blood cell
[1:27:57] of satan of lucifer now enters into the
[1:28:01] human race and now we've got sin in the
[1:28:04] garden
[1:28:05] and because of sin god runs them out of
[1:28:08] the garden and there's an angel placed
[1:28:11] at the way at the entrance back to the
[1:28:13] garden of eden
[1:28:14] with a flaming sword
[1:28:16] but i'm thankful that the word also said
[1:28:18] that there would be an entrance
[1:28:20] ministered unto us into the everlasting
[1:28:23] kingdom i'm going to tell you i'm
[1:28:25] looking for the stephen for that
[1:28:27] entrance back to the garden of eden and
[1:28:29] i'm going to tell you where the entrance
[1:28:30] is it is through the ministering of the
[1:28:33] word
[1:28:37] you see we wonder now
[1:28:39] how can
[1:28:40] how could cain have killed abel
[1:28:42] because he didn't recognize it was his
[1:28:44] brother
[1:28:47] and the reason he didn't recognize him
[1:28:49] as brother
[1:28:50] is because satan was in the mix
[1:28:54] and so when you understand when you get
[1:28:55] message brothers that are fighting and
[1:28:57] cannot love one another and we can't
[1:28:59] feel for one another and we can't be
[1:29:02] brothers anymore you understand satan is
[1:29:04] god in the mix
[1:29:07] you understand when we cannot fellowship
[1:29:09] and when we cannot put our arm around
[1:29:11] the brother that we barely disagree and
[1:29:14] still love that brother now satan is in
[1:29:17] the mix
[1:29:25] the only way
[1:29:26] for satan to get in was through the
[1:29:28] breaking of a blood cell
[1:29:30] so now we have a human race
[1:29:33] that is messed up
[1:29:35] it is doctored up by the devil
[1:29:39] so there's only one way to fix that
[1:29:41] brother oil
[1:29:42] we needed another blood cell
[1:29:47] brother branham called he called a
[1:29:49] kinsman redeemer a goal g-o-e-l and he
[1:29:53] said it means one who is worthy
[1:29:56] i begin to think that there had to be
[1:29:59] another blood cell that could come and
[1:30:01] fix what the devil messed up
[1:30:04] and brother branham said it like this he
[1:30:05] said their god he said he humbled
[1:30:07] himself down
[1:30:09] and became a blood cell
[1:30:12] and he said the blood wrapped around it
[1:30:14] he said now it's billion times smaller
[1:30:16] than a natural eye could see that blood
[1:30:18] cell was he said and then the blood
[1:30:21] wrapped around it he said but god was
[1:30:23] the egg
[1:30:24] god was the germ
[1:30:27] placed into the to the womb of mary
[1:30:31] now watch this
[1:30:33] the blood cell comes from god
[1:30:36] and when the blood cell was broken at
[1:30:38] calvary
[1:30:40] the life of that blood was able to enter
[1:30:43] back into the human race
[1:30:45] the blood of god was already in the
[1:30:48] human race but it had been tampered with
[1:30:50] in the garden
[1:30:52] that is how you get serpent seed but now
[1:30:55] because of the shedding of the innocent
[1:30:57] lamb of calvary the breaking of a new
[1:30:59] blood cell is now has the power to
[1:31:03] overcome the enemy in me and you
[1:31:08] amen i want to look at this goal though
[1:31:11] one who is worthy he could not be one
[1:31:14] with sin
[1:31:16] he cannot be one with a spot
[1:31:18] so let's look at a man that's not worthy
[1:31:21] one time
[1:31:24] joshua excuse me moses he wanted to lead
[1:31:26] the children of israel over
[1:31:30] and so he comes in contact with the
[1:31:31] burning bush and the lord was wanting
[1:31:33] moses to know you're not worthy
[1:31:36] he said moses take your shoes off amen
[1:31:40] joshua one time came in the presence
[1:31:44] of the captain of the host
[1:31:47] and joshua wasn't worthy and he said you
[1:31:49] take your shoes off
[1:31:52] well
[1:31:53] in the story of ruth we're told
[1:31:55] that tobe wanted to redeem ruth
[1:31:59] but he did not have enough finances to
[1:32:02] redeem naomi
[1:32:04] so boaz comes on the scene and he says
[1:32:07] to
[1:32:07] if you don't have the money to redeem
[1:32:10] not only the gentile bride but to redeem
[1:32:12] the jewish bride then you can't redeem
[1:32:15] ruth entirely
[1:32:18] he said but i'm worthy
[1:32:20] i have the finances
[1:32:23] he said tobe take your shoe off
[1:32:29] but one day our lamb
[1:32:31] our kinsmen came walking down to the
[1:32:34] banks of the jordan river
[1:32:36] and john the baptist looked at him and
[1:32:39] he said behold the lamb of god whose
[1:32:42] shoes i'm not worthy to loosen
[1:32:45] there was no man that could say to
[1:32:48] christ you're not worthy john said leave
[1:32:51] your shoes on you're
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:01] now
[1:33:03] the breaking of this blood cell
[1:33:05] i'm going to go back to the quote you
[1:33:06] read brother stephen
[1:33:08] it reunites the family
[1:33:11] the breaking of the blood cell of
[1:33:13] lucifer divided the family
[1:33:16] the breaking of this blood cell brings
[1:33:18] the family back in unity again
[1:33:22] brother branham says it this way in the
[1:33:23] kinsmen redeemer he said god
[1:33:25] became man
[1:33:27] he had to become kin folks
[1:33:30] and he couldn't be god and us sinners
[1:33:34] creations of his creation
[1:33:37] creative beings of his creation because
[1:33:39] we couldn't be kin folks there
[1:33:44] i want to ask you to think in your mind
[1:33:46] for a moment what is god
[1:33:49] because i think sometimes we read quotes
[1:33:51] and we don't catch the power that's
[1:33:53] laying in them
[1:33:55] what is god
[1:33:57] he's all-knowing amen he's the
[1:34:00] all-in-all
[1:34:01] he's the alpha and he's the omega
[1:34:04] so brother branham says this so god
[1:34:07] the creator of heaven and earth
[1:34:09] right
[1:34:10] god became man
[1:34:12] so we understand that when you see jesus
[1:34:15] you are seeing god
[1:34:16] in a human body
[1:34:19] but brother branham says god became man
[1:34:22] that man
[1:34:23] might become god
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:29] what is god
[1:34:31] come on
[1:34:33] god is a creator
[1:34:35] see brother branham says these quotes
[1:34:37] and now you start to see them line up
[1:34:39] brother branham said you're messiahs
[1:34:41] little messiahs
[1:34:42] brother branham says you have the power
[1:34:45] to speak a world
[1:34:47] and go live on it i want to tell you i
[1:34:49] don't want to live in this united states
[1:34:51] anymore
[1:34:52] i want to speak my own world and even
[1:34:54] though i've got to work in the united
[1:34:56] states
[1:34:57] i've got to live here and i've got to
[1:34:59] drive through the city but let me tell
[1:35:01] you i am every day when i get up i speak
[1:35:04] a new world and i go live on it me and
[1:35:08] god we just step over into another
[1:35:11] dimension i may drive here but i'm
[1:35:14] walking in a higher place
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:19] god became man
[1:35:22] that man
[1:35:23] might become god look at how much power
[1:35:26] you have
[1:35:31] the song says he
[1:35:33] became me
[1:35:35] that i might become him
[1:35:38] by grace
[1:35:40] now brother branham says
[1:35:43] in blind bartimaeus
[1:35:46] he said the weight
[1:35:47] of every sin
[1:35:49] that was ever committed on the earth
[1:35:52] or ever would be committed
[1:35:54] rested upon his precious shoulders
[1:35:58] he was a big man
[1:36:02] so i looked at this the other morning i
[1:36:04] my mind just began to go back and
[1:36:08] i thought about how much weight did he
[1:36:09] carry to that cross
[1:36:13] brother branham says
[1:36:15] the weight of every sin that was ever
[1:36:17] committed
[1:36:21] brother
[1:36:22] he had to run
[1:36:24] now remember brother branham would stand
[1:36:26] he was a word prophet and he would stand
[1:36:27] on the on the platform and he would look
[1:36:29] at people in this world in this hour and
[1:36:32] he would say i see you 35 years ago
[1:36:38] so a word prophet son of man ministry
[1:36:41] has the ability to stand here but leave
[1:36:45] and go somewhere else
[1:36:47] and the brother branham says that he
[1:36:49] went back 4 000 years
[1:36:52] i'm going to tell you what my lord and
[1:36:54] savior done he stepped into another
[1:36:57] dimension and he went to the garden of
[1:36:59] eden
[1:37:01] and brother he picked up mother eve's
[1:37:04] sins
[1:37:05] and he said just lay that sin on my
[1:37:07] shoulder
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:13] he began to walk down through time
[1:37:16] and he came past abraham
[1:37:19] and he said i want to take abraham's
[1:37:20] laughing i want to take his doubting and
[1:37:23] i just want you to lay it upon my
[1:37:25] shoulders
[1:37:26] hallelujah oh let me tell you how great
[1:37:28] the blood is
[1:37:30] how great is the blood this morning
[1:37:32] i want to talk to you about how great
[1:37:34] the blood is
[1:37:35] this is how strong the blood is brother
[1:37:40] this is how strong the blood is
[1:37:42] let me turn i got an alarm going off i
[1:37:44] don't know why
[1:37:46] it ain't time yet is it
[1:37:50] i want to talk to you about how strong
[1:37:52] the blood is
[1:37:53] in the book of genesis it said that when
[1:37:56] the angel spoke to abraham that he fell
[1:37:58] on his face laughing
[1:38:03] but when paul
[1:38:05] wrote about abraham he had to look
[1:38:07] through matthew mark luke and john he
[1:38:10] had to look through the blood and he
[1:38:12] said abraham never staggered
[1:38:19] abraham said
[1:38:20] how could i being old and well stricken
[1:38:24] in age but when paul looked through the
[1:38:26] blood he said abraham never considered
[1:38:30] his own body
[1:38:34] abraham said how with sarah's womb being
[1:38:37] barren can this happen but when paul
[1:38:40] looked through the blood he said and he
[1:38:42] never thought about the deadness of
[1:38:45] sarah's world
[1:38:49] that's how powerful the blood is
[1:38:53] the blood is so powerful
[1:38:56] that the eye of a prophet cannot see sin
[1:38:59] when he looks through the blood
[1:39:07] i see him come down
[1:39:10] oh i want to talk about the sin that
[1:39:12] jesus washes away
[1:39:14] he comes down to a little woman
[1:39:16] the scripture tells us that she was a
[1:39:18] harlot
[1:39:20] rahab the harlot
[1:39:23] what an ugly name to have
[1:39:29] but she received the message
[1:39:32] there were some messengers that came and
[1:39:34] she received the message
[1:39:37] and i want you to understand something
[1:39:39] everybody was destroyed around her
[1:39:42] everything about jericho was laying in
[1:39:44] ashes and in rubble but it made me think
[1:39:46] about the prophet of god said that we
[1:39:48] the bride of christ will walk out on the
[1:39:50] ashes of the wicked amen but there was a
[1:39:54] promise given to rahab
[1:39:56] if you will apply the token
[1:40:00] you
[1:40:02] and everybody else
[1:40:04] that you can fit in that house
[1:40:06] is going to be saved
[1:40:08] and the prophet of god came and
[1:40:11] illuminated that to us and he said mamas
[1:40:14] you claim your children
[1:40:16] and you apply the token over them and he
[1:40:19] said thus saith the lord they'll be
[1:40:21] there
[1:40:23] i don't understand it but i got two
[1:40:26] little girls at home and i want you to
[1:40:28] know i've claimed them
[1:40:30] so i don't understand it but i love it
[1:40:36] i don't know how it works
[1:40:38] but all i know is wherever my little
[1:40:40] girls go throughout life
[1:40:42] they've got a scarlet thread left onto
[1:40:44] them
[1:40:45] i don't know what they're going to do
[1:40:47] when they get older but there's a cord
[1:40:49] that has been hung out of my window
[1:40:52] there's a token that has been applied to
[1:40:54] my children and it is just saith the
[1:40:57] lord
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:09] hallelujah i got to find this scripture
[1:41:11] the lord's just giving me this phrase i
[1:41:12] gotta i gotta find this here
[1:41:14] the book of hebrews
[1:41:16] chapter 11
[1:41:19] rahab walks out
[1:41:21] she's a harlot
[1:41:23] but did you know that the bible said
[1:41:25] that you can't bring an accusation
[1:41:29] unless there's two or three witnesses of
[1:41:30] good report
[1:41:32] that's right
[1:41:34] and so the lord
[1:41:36] killed
[1:41:38] all of rahab's accusers
[1:41:50] so
[1:41:52] hallelujah
[1:41:55] so salmon the great high priest
[1:41:59] them walking in with the spools of
[1:42:01] jericho and he needs a wife
[1:42:04] see sometimes the devil tells you you're
[1:42:06] not fit to be the bride well just tell
[1:42:08] him to shut up
[1:42:11] and salmon said
[1:42:13] that woman's beautiful
[1:42:14] and some of those men i'm sure stand
[1:42:16] around old legalistic preachers they
[1:42:18] said ah you don't know where she's been
[1:42:20] you don't know rahab's past
[1:42:24] and so
[1:42:25] they came to salmon i'm sure i'm just
[1:42:27] going to dramatize this they said salmon
[1:42:29] we know you think rahab's beautiful but
[1:42:31] man she's got a past
[1:42:33] she's got a bad past
[1:42:35] and salmon said okay
[1:42:36] what do we do with an accusation
[1:42:39] we've got to find two or three witnesses
[1:42:41] of good report
[1:42:42] so salmon said if you can bring me two
[1:42:44] or three witnesses out of
[1:42:55] and jericho
[1:42:57] come on brother brandon said joshua
[1:42:59] means jesus
[1:43:01] and joshua or jesus said
[1:43:03] salmon there are no witnesses
[1:43:07] they're all dead
[1:43:10] glory to god
[1:43:11] he said
[1:43:12] by my own sword i killed every last
[1:43:16] witness in jericho
[1:43:18] i will tell you when the devil comes to
[1:43:21] you bringing up your past remember the
[1:43:24] devil is alive
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:28] the devil's accusation could only be
[1:43:32] proven if he had another witness
[1:43:35] and they would have to be of good report
[1:43:38] but god said the devil's a liar he is a
[1:43:41] blood and his word
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:55] let me find this scripture
[1:44:00] hallelujah i gotta find it it's
[1:44:02] beautiful
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:11] well i can't find it here we go
[1:44:14] hebrews 11 31.
[1:44:17] he's still a liar
[1:44:23] by faith
[1:44:25] the harlot rahab
[1:44:28] perished not with them that believed not
[1:44:30] when she had received the spies with
[1:44:33] peace
[1:44:36] look at this
[1:44:38] she didn't perish because of what
[1:44:42] she believed
[1:44:46] believing
[1:44:47] in the shed blood of the lamb
[1:44:50] takes away you you don't have to perish
[1:44:53] the devil says you're going to die i'm
[1:44:54] not going to die
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:58] i was speaking with brother frank prater
[1:45:00] yesterday on the or day before yesterday
[1:45:02] and i said you know
[1:45:03] i think sometimes we discount
[1:45:06] what god has done for us
[1:45:09] the prophet of god drew out one time on
[1:45:11] the board and he said there's that each
[1:45:13] person you are a triune being
[1:45:16] you're made up of body spirit soul
[1:45:20] so when you
[1:45:21] get a new birth there's a new soul
[1:45:25] so the soul has been changed
[1:45:30] and the soul begins to change the spirit
[1:45:33] that's right
[1:45:35] and now the devil's saying you can't
[1:45:37] make a body change
[1:45:45] i want you to understand something not
[1:45:47] only am i going to make a body change
[1:45:51] but the soul has been changed
[1:45:53] the spirit has been changed i'm already
[1:45:56] two-thirds of the way through the body
[1:45:57] change
[1:45:59] i'm not looking for something to come it
[1:46:02] is happening now
[1:46:04] the word the scripture said from glory
[1:46:07] unto glory he is changing what is
[1:46:12] changing a process
[1:46:20] he picked up
[1:46:23] and he went down a little further he got
[1:46:25] he got rahab's sin
[1:46:27] he picked up ruth's sin
[1:46:30] and he picked up job's children sin
[1:46:34] but i see jesus walking now he's still
[1:46:37] he's walking back in time
[1:46:39] and he walks
[1:46:40] out on a banister
[1:46:43] and he looks down and he's standing next
[1:46:45] to david
[1:46:47] and he sees david lust after bathsheba
[1:46:51] and the lord said if you're going to be
[1:46:54] part of my lineage
[1:46:56] i got to remove this sin
[1:46:58] so he just picks up david's adultery
[1:47:01] and he just laid it right there on his
[1:47:03] shoulders
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] i find in another place where he picked
[1:47:08] up hosea's wife
[1:47:10] all of the whoredom he just laid it upon
[1:47:13] us precious shoulders
[1:47:15] he brought every past sin
[1:47:17] brother brahm said every sin that had
[1:47:19] ever been committed
[1:47:20] he brought every sin up to date
[1:47:23] and it was so heavy
[1:47:26] that the bible says that he stumbled
[1:47:29] under the weight of the cross
[1:47:32] and i'm going to tell you
[1:47:33] all things happen for our good
[1:47:36] and even though the roman soldier didn't
[1:47:38] know it
[1:47:40] he said you know this man needs some
[1:47:42] help carrying this cross
[1:47:44] and he picked a man out of the crowd and
[1:47:45] he said i want you to carry his cross
[1:47:47] let me tell you why his cross needed to
[1:47:49] be carried
[1:47:51] because jesus had another 2 000 years
[1:47:53] worth of sins that he hadn't got yet
[1:47:55] and about that time as simon picked up
[1:47:58] his cross jesus began to step forward
[1:48:01] amen
[1:48:02] and he saw where stephen was being
[1:48:04] stoned
[1:48:06] and he said i'd just like to take that
[1:48:07] sin
[1:48:08] of paul because he's going to be one of
[1:48:10] my church age messengers and if that sin
[1:48:12] lays on him it can't happen so he just
[1:48:14] took that sin
[1:48:16] and he just laid it right up on his back
[1:48:20] jesus went
[1:48:21] and he picked up peter's denial
[1:48:25] come on now
[1:48:26] he picked up peter's denial and he just
[1:48:28] laid it up on his precious shoulders
[1:48:30] let me just stop here some people around
[1:48:32] this message believe if you walk away
[1:48:34] from the message there's no coming back
[1:48:38] don't discount the value of my precious
[1:48:41] lord jesus blood
[1:48:44] because peter denied the message of the
[1:48:46] hour
[1:48:47] right
[1:48:48] the message of the hour was christ
[1:48:51] and peter denied it
[1:48:54] so what happened when jesus rose from
[1:48:55] the dead he already knew that all those
[1:48:58] legalistic preachers had put peter out
[1:49:01] so what did he tell mary he said go tell
[1:49:03] my disciples and peter
[1:49:07] that i'm resurrected
[1:49:09] the invitation
[1:49:11] good god almighty it does not matter how
[1:49:15] far you run it does not matter if you
[1:49:18] walk away from the message
[1:49:20] the invitation is still open
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:29] i got a precious brother down in north
[1:49:31] carolina one of my dearest friends that
[1:49:34] walked away from this message and said
[1:49:36] brother branham's a false prophet but i
[1:49:37] want you to know i believe there's a way
[1:49:40] back for him
[1:49:42] and brother latte when he comes back i'm
[1:49:45] going to be the first one with open arms
[1:49:47] to greet my brother back and welcome him
[1:49:50] back into the pool
[1:49:59] he took the sins
[1:50:01] of seven church ages
[1:50:04] i want to tell you he came down where i
[1:50:06] was at
[1:50:07] see i was raised in the message but i i
[1:50:10] was a little devil child
[1:50:14] come on i had addictions
[1:50:16] i was a mess
[1:50:18] i was a sinner
[1:50:20] but god knew there was no way i could
[1:50:21] ever walk to a pulpit free
[1:50:23] unless he would walk down to an altar
[1:50:25] where i laid down one night
[1:50:27] and jesus just walked over that altar
[1:50:30] about 18 years ago and he picked up the
[1:50:32] sins that i laid on the altar and he
[1:50:35] carried them and he put them upon his
[1:50:37] shoulders
[1:50:40] but i want to tell you it gets better
[1:50:41] than that
[1:50:43] he said that the blood of he said that
[1:50:45] every sin that had ever been committed
[1:50:46] or would be committed was on his
[1:50:48] shoulders
[1:50:49] but i got a better quote than that
[1:50:51] he said when he died at calvary
[1:50:54] every sin that ever was committed or
[1:50:56] ever would be committed was forgiven
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:01] it wasn't just on his shoulders
[1:51:04] it was forgiven
[1:51:07] where did sin come from
[1:51:10] from lucifer
[1:51:12] so what did jesus do with the sin
[1:51:16] every sin was on his shoulders and he
[1:51:19] went to hell
[1:51:25] brother
[1:51:26] said he kicked the door of hell open
[1:51:30] and what did he do
[1:51:32] he took 6 000 years of sins
[1:51:36] [Applause]
[1:51:44] how would you understand
[1:51:46] now brother brandon made a statement one
[1:51:47] time if you bring up someone's past sin
[1:51:50] that sin is now on you
[1:51:54] when the devil brings up your sin
[1:51:57] remind him that sin is on him
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:10] so i want you to know something
[1:52:12] every sin up to today
[1:52:17] it's covered by the blood amen
[1:52:21] but i got a better quote than that
[1:52:25] tell me about it
[1:52:27] amen he said and tonight his blood still
[1:52:30] pleads
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] so you say what about tomorrow let me
[1:52:36] tell you what it said in the old
[1:52:37] testament he said every morning his
[1:52:40] mercy is
[1:52:43] you new say brother cliff i feel like i
[1:52:45] have repented so many times that i've
[1:52:48] ran the mercy of god out well just rest
[1:52:52] because in the morning
[1:52:54] he refills his mercy
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:07] he said his blood pleads tonight for our
[1:53:09] sins
[1:53:11] father forgive them
[1:53:13] they know not what they do
[1:53:16] oh
[1:53:18] you say what about my children
[1:53:20] anybody got a lost loved one they're
[1:53:21] concerned about
[1:53:24] you wonder what's going to happen to
[1:53:25] them well i'm going to tell you what's
[1:53:26] going to happen to them
[1:53:28] wherever they go
[1:53:30] the blood already beat them there
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:36] he said every sin that would be
[1:53:38] committed
[1:53:42] what about if i fail him tomorrow the
[1:53:44] blood beat you there
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] what about if my children see even job
[1:53:49] had a revelation of this job said i'm
[1:53:51] going to offer a sacrifice just per
[1:53:53] adventure
[1:53:54] just in case one of my children done
[1:53:56] something wrong
[1:53:57] so jesus just sheds enough blood that he
[1:53:59] says just in case they keep doing wrong
[1:54:01] i'm just going to keep forgiving amen
[1:54:08] he went to hell
[1:54:10] and he dropped off
[1:54:12] the sins of the world
[1:54:14] he put them back
[1:54:16] on their rightful owner
[1:54:20] now when jesus gets done putting sin
[1:54:23] away
[1:54:25] what begins to happen
[1:54:27] a process
[1:54:28] and brother branham says it this way
[1:54:31] i can see him coming back up
[1:54:35] it's the resurrection
[1:54:37] he said it's coming towards daylight
[1:54:39] there's some more people up there
[1:54:42] the old testament saints
[1:54:44] they couldn't go to heaven
[1:54:48] now watch this
[1:54:50] the old testament saints had some
[1:54:52] bloodshed
[1:54:54] but it was by the blood of bulls and
[1:54:56] goats
[1:54:58] how do bulls and goats reproduce by sex
[1:55:01] act
[1:55:02] nothing that is born
[1:55:04] without being born of the spoken word
[1:55:07] can free you of sin
[1:55:11] he said they couldn't go to heaven
[1:55:14] they had to stay in paradise because the
[1:55:16] blood of bulls and goats won't take away
[1:55:18] sin
[1:55:20] it just covers sin
[1:55:23] he said but jesus has shed his blood
[1:55:26] that divorce is sin
[1:55:28] it puts her away and wipes her out he
[1:55:31] said i see him there's another place up
[1:55:33] there called paradise i can hear the
[1:55:36] door open
[1:55:38] listen to this
[1:55:39] brother branham go back and watch this
[1:55:41] in your message search i hear the door
[1:55:43] open brother branham knocks six times
[1:55:49] not seven
[1:55:51] because it wasn't the seventh dimension
[1:55:53] that he was at
[1:55:55] it was paradise
[1:55:58] so he knocked six times to a people that
[1:56:01] were held
[1:56:02] by blood of bulls and goats
[1:56:05] and somebody said who's there
[1:56:07] open the door abraham
[1:56:09] and he said sarah come here
[1:56:12] that's the man
[1:56:14] that i entertained that day
[1:56:16] under the oak tree
[1:56:19] brother stephen i'm going to keep going
[1:56:21] back to your quote the same jesus christ
[1:56:26] he said that's the one i entertain under
[1:56:28] the oak tree
[1:56:30] daniel said well what do you say
[1:56:33] that's the rock that i saw hewed
[1:56:36] out of the mountain without hands
[1:56:38] here come ezekiel and said i seen him he
[1:56:42] was in the heavens and the clouds looked
[1:56:44] like dust under his feet
[1:56:47] he said boys
[1:56:48] you have all believed under the shedding
[1:56:50] of the sacrifices of the blood of bulls
[1:56:53] and goats
[1:56:54] but sin
[1:56:55] is divorced now amen
[1:56:58] we're going up
[1:56:59] [Applause]
[1:57:02] watch this
[1:57:03] as good as they could be
[1:57:06] they were in a holding place
[1:57:08] because the blood had not been said they
[1:57:10] lived the law brother bate but living
[1:57:13] the law did not put them in a rapture
[1:57:17] see we try to preach people into a
[1:57:18] rapture by your hair's got to be this
[1:57:20] way and your dress has got to be this
[1:57:22] long and you got to do this and you got
[1:57:24] to do that but i'm going to tell you
[1:57:25] what he's showing us right here that the
[1:57:27] difference between being held in
[1:57:29] paradise and being raptured into the
[1:57:32] throne room was one drop of blood
[1:57:42] he said but when the son of god died
[1:57:44] the life that was in him
[1:57:46] was none other but god
[1:57:48] to come back and adopt us into the
[1:57:51] family of god
[1:57:52] and now we are children of god
[1:57:54] the life from his blood
[1:57:58] how precious is that blood
[1:58:01] and now he says you
[1:58:03] are the life of the blood
[1:58:06] you got to understand
[1:58:08] we would give anything
[1:58:11] to hold one drop
[1:58:13] of literal blood in our hands
[1:58:16] but the life of that blood
[1:58:19] is in the bride
[1:58:21] how many of you would like to touch a
[1:58:23] drop of the blood of jesus
[1:58:26] then reach over and touch your neighbor
[1:58:30] come on you didn't get it
[1:58:32] the life of the blood
[1:58:35] is within the body of christ
[1:58:38] you say i want to touch the body i am
[1:58:40] the body
[1:58:42] where is the body it's here among you
[1:58:46] [Applause]
[1:58:54] he said moses was in him joshua was in
[1:58:57] him and if you are in him you was in him
[1:59:00] before the foundation of the world the
[1:59:02] family of god you suffered with him you
[1:59:06] died with him you went to the cross with
[1:59:08] him you raised with him and now you're
[1:59:11] still with him sitting in heavenly
[1:59:13] places reflecting the message of the age
[1:59:16] to the world
[1:59:18] the light of the world
[1:59:21] we'll walk in the light
[1:59:23] what's the old song say the beautiful
[1:59:25] light
[1:59:27] jesus
[1:59:28] the light of the world but now the
[1:59:30] prophet of god says you
[1:59:33] are the light of the world
[1:59:39] i don't know what time i got up here so
[1:59:40] i don't know when i'm supposed to close
[1:59:45] galatians 4
[1:59:48] it says now i say
[1:59:50] that the heir as long as he is a child
[1:59:53] differeth nothing from a servant
[1:59:55] though he be lord of all
[1:59:58] you know that scripture just
[2:00:01] that's beautiful
[2:00:03] he said he's no different than the
[2:00:04] servant
[2:00:05] even though he's the lord of all
[2:00:08] you say brother
[2:00:10] what about the alcoholic
[2:00:13] sitting on a bar stool
[2:00:15] but he's still the lord of all
[2:00:17] he just don't know it yet
[2:00:22] thank you lord and all you've got to do
[2:00:24] to be lord of all is just accept the
[2:00:27] image of the son
[2:00:29] did you ever hear the story about the
[2:00:31] painting
[2:00:32] there was a rich man he had many
[2:00:34] millions of dollars worth of paintings i
[2:00:36] think there were van goghs and there
[2:00:38] were michelangelo's there was all kinds
[2:00:40] of art and painting and there was an
[2:00:42] auction
[2:00:43] and there were all the rich people had
[2:00:45] showed up
[2:00:46] millionaires were there
[2:00:48] they wanted to come and buy this
[2:00:49] expensive art
[2:00:51] the auctioneer started off and he said
[2:00:55] he said there's this one painting
[2:00:57] that's got to be sold first according to
[2:00:59] the wheel
[2:01:01] and it was a painting and it wasn't good
[2:01:04] it wasn't pretty it wasn't
[2:01:06] it wasn't that great of a painting it
[2:01:08] didn't have any value
[2:01:11] but it was a picture of his son that had
[2:01:13] died in the war
[2:01:15] and he said this picture must be sold
[2:01:16] first
[2:01:19] no one would bid on the picture
[2:01:22] because it seemed of no value
[2:01:24] it was just a picture of the sun
[2:01:27] and there was a farm hand that had
[2:01:28] worked there with the with the old man
[2:01:31] and he walked up and he said
[2:01:33] i don't have much money
[2:01:35] all i've got to my name is ten dollars
[2:01:38] he said bye
[2:01:40] i knew that boy
[2:01:42] and i would like to buy that picture
[2:01:44] with this ten dollars
[2:01:46] the auctioneer said ten going once
[2:01:50] going twice
[2:01:52] going three times
[2:01:54] sold
[2:01:56] he said the auction is now over
[2:02:01] the millionaires they looked around they
[2:02:03] were astonished this is a true story
[2:02:05] and the auctioneer said according to the
[2:02:07] will
[2:02:09] the seller said
[2:02:10] that whoever takes the image of my son
[2:02:16] is the heir of everything at home
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:20] i want you to understand
[2:02:22] that it doesn't take money
[2:02:24] it doesn't take by speech but it takes
[2:02:28] taking the image of the sun
[2:02:30] and when you take the image of the sun
[2:02:32] you are heir to everything
[2:02:40] he said
[2:02:41] he's under tutors and governors until
[2:02:43] the time appointed of the father
[2:02:45] even so we when we were children were in
[2:02:47] bondage under the elements of the world
[2:02:49] but when the fullness of time was come
[2:02:51] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[2:02:53] made under the law
[2:02:56] to redeem them
[2:02:58] that were under the law that we might
[2:03:00] receive the adoption of sons
[2:03:03] and because ye are sons
[2:03:06] god hath sent forth the spirit of his
[2:03:07] son
[2:03:08] into your hearts
[2:03:11] see
[2:03:12] how many of you got the holy ghost
[2:03:16] now you know you got the holy ghost but
[2:03:18] does the devil still not tell you you're
[2:03:19] not going to make a rapture
[2:03:24] you can't have one without the other
[2:03:27] watch this
[2:03:28] because you're a son
[2:03:32] let's put that scripture up there
[2:03:34] where are we at galatians 4
[2:03:38] and 6.
[2:03:42] why do you have the holy ghost
[2:03:45] because you're a son
[2:03:48] you didn't get the holy ghost because
[2:03:50] god said well i feel sorry for him i'm
[2:03:52] just going to go ahead and give him a
[2:03:53] blessing no because you're a son
[2:03:56] he sent the spirit of the son into your
[2:03:59] heart
[2:04:00] and what does it cause you to do
[2:04:05] abba
[2:04:06] [Applause]
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:17] the spirit within
[2:04:21] the future
[2:04:24] you are my father
[2:04:26] and brother brown said god cannot lose a
[2:04:29] one if you are a part of god god cannot
[2:04:32] continue eternity without you
[2:04:38] wherefore
[2:04:40] thou art no more
[2:04:42] a servant
[2:04:44] but a son
[2:04:46] and if a son then an heir of god
[2:04:50] through christ
[2:04:52] one more scripture galatians 3 26 for ye
[2:04:56] are all the children of god
[2:04:58] by faith in christ jesus
[2:05:00] for as many of you have received
[2:05:03] as many of you have been baptized into
[2:05:05] christ have put on christ
[2:05:08] there is neither jew
[2:05:09] nor greek
[2:05:11] neither bond nor free
[2:05:13] neither male
[2:05:15] nor female
[2:05:20] can i go a step further
[2:05:22] there's neither black nor white
[2:05:26] there's not mexican and portuguese and
[2:05:29] come on
[2:05:32] there's not brazilian and egyptian and
[2:05:35] russian there is no more room for that
[2:05:38] in the church there's no male or female
[2:05:41] we are all one
[2:05:44] [Applause]
[2:05:49] that's why the prophet of god said he
[2:05:51] said the love of jesus christ makes the
[2:05:53] tuxedo hug the bib overall it makes the
[2:05:57] white man love the black man what does
[2:05:59] it do it puts away enmity
[2:06:03] what did the seed of the serpent do he
[2:06:05] said it will be enmity between my seed
[2:06:08] and thy seed
[2:06:10] so what does the breaking of the blood
[2:06:12] cell of christ do it ends enmity
[2:06:22] in closing let the musicians come
[2:06:26] brother brian i'm in the token
[2:06:29] he said your life
[2:06:31] has gone
[2:06:33] now i want to bring you back full circle
[2:06:34] to john chapter one
[2:06:39] your life
[2:06:40] has gone
[2:06:42] and you are dead
[2:06:45] your life
[2:06:46] is dead
[2:06:49] you are hid in god through christ
[2:06:53] and sealed in there
[2:06:55] by the holy
[2:06:56] spirit the mind that was in christ
[2:07:00] is in you
[2:07:03] now look at the difference paul when he
[2:07:04] was preaching it said let this mind
[2:07:08] be in you
[2:07:10] but in our age
[2:07:11] our messenger said this mind is
[2:07:15] in you
[2:07:18] he said
[2:07:19] and christ i want you to catch this
[2:07:23] christ
[2:07:25] and the bible
[2:07:29] how precious is christ amen
[2:07:33] how precious is he amen
[2:07:37] how precious is the word
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:43] he said
[2:07:44] christ
[2:07:46] and the bible
[2:07:48] and the word
[2:07:50] is the same
[2:07:54] he takes us back to john 1 1 here he
[2:07:56] says in the beginning was the word and
[2:07:57] the word was with god and the word was
[2:07:59] god
[2:08:00] now listen
[2:08:01] he says then you somebody say me me
[2:08:06] and the word
[2:08:08] and god and god and christ
[2:08:12] are the same
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:24] jesus
[2:08:26] when he walked on earth was god veiled
[2:08:28] in a human flesh
[2:08:31] brother branham said one time he said
[2:08:33] every scripture has compound meaning
[2:08:37] i want you to look at this scripture a
[2:08:38] little bit different
[2:08:39] jesus was standing on earth in a flesh
[2:08:41] body
[2:08:43] death was subject to him
[2:08:46] leprosy was subject to him
[2:08:48] and he said i'm preparing a place
[2:08:51] that where i am
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:54] where was he
[2:08:56] brother stephen he was in a flesh body
[2:09:00] but satan had no control over him
[2:09:03] and he said i'm preparing a place that
[2:09:05] where i am
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:08] that's where you can be
[2:09:11] by the blood there's a place prepared
[2:09:14] that you can walk
[2:09:16] and cancer has no hold over you
[2:09:19] diabetes has no hold over you
[2:09:22] lust has no hold over you
[2:09:26] the things of the world have no more
[2:09:28] hold on you
[2:09:31] i want you to understand
[2:09:34] i believe when we catch this revelation
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:38] brother stephen this body's got to give
[2:09:40] way
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:43] i'm looking for the body change
[2:09:46] i am looking for the open door
[2:09:49] now what you understand brother stephen
[2:09:51] one of these mornings
[2:09:53] it's gonna click
[2:09:55] and every revelation that has been
[2:09:57] preached
[2:09:59] it's going to unfold
[2:10:01] and i'm going to look in the mirror
[2:10:05] and this body
[2:10:07] will have to turn loose
[2:10:09] to the revelation
[2:10:12] this body will come subject
[2:10:15] to the word
[2:10:16] paul said mortify the deeds but this
[2:10:19] flesh will be mortified by the word
[2:10:23] and this body will be changed
[2:10:26] [Music]
[2:10:29] brother and sister
[2:10:31] this is not something coming in the far
[2:10:33] blue yonder
[2:10:35] it is upon us
[2:10:38] every prophecy
[2:10:40] has been fulfilled
[2:10:43] the prophet of god said
[2:10:46] every prophecy every one of those
[2:10:48] visions
[2:10:50] have already been fulfilled
[2:10:53] he said the only thing we're waiting for
[2:10:56] is the coming of the lord
[2:10:58] he has come
[2:11:00] we've united with him in our soul
[2:11:02] our spirit is united with him
[2:11:05] all i'm waiting for
[2:11:07] is that open door
[2:11:09] and this body
[2:11:12] this old robo flesh is just going to
[2:11:13] drop
[2:11:14] [Music]
