[0:00] [Music]
[5:21] i think i have that right the symphony
[5:23] uh peter the wolf you remember that the
[5:25] old story how they used to i've heard
[5:27] that
[5:27] how they take the drums and make the
[5:29] little woodpecker pecking and
[5:31] peter going out the growling of the wolf
[5:32] the tuning of the horns
[5:34] a symphony now if you
[5:38] don't understand a symphony it's a big
[5:40] bunch of racket to you
[5:42] if you don't understand it you've got to
[5:43] understand what it is
[5:46] it's all done by signs and motions
[5:49] but it acts out a drama in this sympathy
[5:53] now we notice
[5:56] the only one that understands the
[5:58] sympathy is the composure
[6:01] and those who are interested in knowing
[6:04] it
[6:05] knows it's changes knows what takes
[6:07] place
[6:08] the composure knows every move from the
[6:11] end to the beginning from the beginning
[6:13] to the end
[6:14] did you know that the one who wrote it
[6:16] up he composes this
[6:18] he knows every little junction if he
[6:22] knows every junction
[6:24] so does the director have to do to
[6:25] direct it
[6:27] now how you go twist your creed in that
[6:30] one little miscue of that stick that
[6:33] sign
[6:34] one little missed sign at a junction
[6:36] would throw the whole orchestra off
[6:38] throw the whole symphony out now you
[6:41] know that's true
[6:43] the composure and director has to be in
[6:45] the same spirit
[6:48] that's why the minister and the word of
[6:50] god god's great sympathy he's been
[6:52] playing since the dawn of time
[6:56] the minister at the word has to not look
[6:58] over here it's happening this rpr and
[7:00] make it this way
[7:00] he's got to go the way the sheep music
[7:02] says take it
[7:04] that's the way the gospels got to be
[7:06] preached the way the word says take it
[7:09] i don't know if you throw a creed in
[7:10] there you got the whole thing messed up
[7:13] it's got to go to make the drama just
[7:15] exactly right
[7:18] the director has to go what the composer
[7:20] said
[7:21] beat i just exactly saw the music and
[7:23] watch it's all
[7:25] done by signs it's got to be the right
[7:28] kind of sign
[7:30] to give the right kind of a sound
[7:33] paul said if the trumpet gives an
[7:35] uncertain sound
[7:37] who will prepare himself for war now you
[7:40] see the composure
[7:42] god who wrote the bible it's all
[7:45] together the revelation of jesus christ
[7:48] he know the changes of time and amanda
[7:51] the director who's directing them the
[7:53] son
[7:54] of the age has to go just exactly with
[7:57] the bible signs
[7:59] hallelujah
[8:02] thank you oh brother sister what's the
[8:05] matter with the world
[8:07] why am i crazy there's something wrong
[8:11] somewhere amen glory to god the symphony
[8:14] is not in harmony with the sheep music
[8:17] [Music]
[8:19] you're making church creed and
[8:20] everything else when it's the words
[8:22] supposed to be priests to be manifested
[8:26] something wrong with the directors
[8:30] then the whole band's mixed up they
[8:32] don't know what to do
[8:33] they're all funny what happened what
[8:35] this do what this happens how does that
[8:37] happen
[8:38] they don't know what to do now scattered
[8:41] because it never come in harmony with
[8:43] the word
[8:46] that's what samaras are what we call
[8:47] last day revival
[8:50] that's why i smeared our pentecostal
[8:51] message
[8:53] we gotta upbeat with the bible when
[8:56] organized like they did back there
[8:58] she will feed
[9:02] god have mercy i wish i had
[9:06] words that i could make it sink in
[9:09] because it was that i could spit it open
[9:11] and pour it in
[9:13] can't you see my brother sister it's got
[9:15] to be in harmony the director's got to
[9:18] be with the word
[9:20] when it says one thing don't say
[9:21] something else
[9:24] you'll give the wrong sign then the
[9:26] whole thing goes out a rhythm
[9:28] it's ryan god's word is a great sympathy
[9:32] a symphony rather excuse me you must
[9:35] begin
[9:36] like he did in the music
[9:39] you must begin with him notice
[9:43] get in the rhythm of it say well i
[9:46] joined church that's not the rhythm
[9:49] i did saw that i knocked the rhythm i
[9:51] went up to the auburn i said i believe
[9:53] jesus christ son of god
[9:54] satan does the same thing that's not the
[9:57] rhythm
[9:59] see you get out of swing what happened
[10:02] maybe some director told you shake hands
[10:06] and put your name on the boat
[10:07] join our club our organization you're
[10:10] all out of the swing
[10:12] then when the real thing begins to
[10:13] happen out here amongst the little bunch
[10:15] you'll say well what about that they're
[10:16] out of harmony
[10:17] go back to the word and see who's out of
[10:18] harmony see what god promised
[10:21] see what the composer said about it see
[10:24] you got everybody in your audience
[10:25] that's reason the world's looking around
[10:26] with a church army
[10:27] looked upon as a bright shining star a
[10:30] light that's sitting on a hill that no
[10:32] man can
[10:33] hot shine no man condemn it today it's a
[10:37] laughing stock of the world
[10:39] the cause that the directors got out of
[10:42] harmony with the composer
[10:45] see what i mean they're beating out
[10:46] things that isn't in there
[10:48] the musicians hardly knows what to do
[10:50] now the church they're all in a twist
[10:52] we've been talking about all this stuff
[10:53] all years and commitment now joining
[10:55] right in with it
[10:57] something wrong somewhere notice you
[11:00] must begin
[11:01] in the music like he did get into the
[11:03] rhythm of it
[11:05] get into the promised word see the way
[11:08] he'd done it at the beginning
[11:10] see the way you've done it in the middle
[11:12] age see the way he does it now
[11:15] always the same watch the director
[11:18] how he does it if he doesn't do it if he
[11:21] points you into some organization there
[11:23] never was a director done that
[11:26] a director always pointed you to the
[11:28] word
[11:30] the prophets of old pointed to the word
[11:32] they was the word they lived the word
[11:34] and what did it do it manifested god
[11:38] that brought the written word for that
[11:40] day to life because
[11:42] it come to them it was revealed to them

[13:45] brown and when they turned me out to
[13:46] what i done
[13:47] i just like started at them that's why
[13:51] he knows the rhythm how it's got to
[13:54] change and what junctions has got to
[13:55] make
[13:56] yes sir before it's written
[14:00] he knows all about he knows the rhythm
[14:02] don't ask why believe it
[14:05] god has moved down to the time of
[14:08] history
[14:09] with his promised word in each age and
[14:12] has never
[14:12] failed to break the rhythm by the power
[14:15] of god
[14:16] when it comes to the elected and
[14:18] vindicated people
[14:20] the rhythm of his word in the days of
[14:22] noah the rhythm of his word in the days
[14:24] of
[14:26] noah the days of moses in the days of
[14:29] elijah
[14:30] in the days of john in the days of david

[14:33] on down he keeps the rhythm of the word
[14:36] right on down
[14:38] never has broken he's come right down
[14:39] through history and uh
[14:41] elected seed that seen and bolina fall
[14:44] right into that rhythm with it
[14:47] the others say well but the church says
[14:48] that has got nothing to do with it
[14:50] you're not born do that you're born into
[14:52] the word for you're born into christ
[14:54] christ is the word yes sir
[14:58] each one in its age you say well i'll
[15:01] just say brother graham i can't look
[15:02] ahead then look up
[15:05] god promised if you look up see shown
[15:07] peace
[15:08] god's peace dresses he said and why does
[15:11] others make fun of me brother
[15:13] you know others make fun of me and
[15:14] saying uh um
[15:16] i got long hair i'm old-fashioned to the
[15:18] women the man because i'll be the bible
[15:21] you don't have fellowship with us no
[15:22] more we can't accept you because
[15:24] that you believe such and such and you
[15:26] know it's exactly the way the words
[15:27] written
[15:29] god's duty bound to you to back that up
[15:30] then it certainly is
[15:32] don't matter about that why they say to
[15:34] make fun of god's a jealous god
[15:36] remember suffering for his word's sake
[15:40] is growing pains of his grace when you
[15:44] suffer for his word saying
[15:45] it's just growing pains you know a
[15:47] little kid 10 12 years old gets pains
[15:49] come and say mama
[15:50] my arms hurt my legs are hurting so
[15:52] forth it's growing pains
[15:54] it shows he's got some good vitamins
[15:56] he's growing up
[15:57] and when somebody begins to make money
[15:58] to say she's old-fashioned look at him
[16:00] he's oh i'll tell you he used to be
[16:02] all right just remember it's growing
[16:04] pains that's how persecution is good for
[16:06] you
[16:07] it's growing pains oh yes he permits
[16:09] crosses and crossroads and junctions he
[16:12] always does that
[16:13] in order to perfect us for his service
[16:16] he permits those things to happen can't
[16:18] you understand that
[16:20] he does that so he can perfect you for
[16:22] the call that he's called you for
[16:25] that's your growing pains he did daniel
[16:28] that way you know
[16:29] he did the hebrew children in the fire
[16:30] furnace wasn't it five furniture
[16:33] the five furnace only broke the bands
[16:35] that hadn't bound
[16:37] that's all the furnace did just burnt
[16:39] loose the bands
[16:40] sometimes it takes trials to break the
[16:42] bands of the world off of us
[16:45] take you out of the world might be have
[16:48] to take out your creed first
[16:51] like the man drowning in the river he
[16:53] had to take him out of the river before
[16:54] he get the river out of the man
[16:56] that's about what god has to do sometime
[16:58] let him troll you out one time
[17:00] let me get the world out of you gotta
[17:02] get you out of the world first
[17:04] sometimes these growing pains is what
[17:05] doesn't oh yes
[17:08] god stands on the promised word for each
[17:11] new year
[17:12] he stands on it this year to fulfill
[17:14] what he's got promised for this year
[17:15] whatever it is i want to be right in the
[17:17] center of his will
[17:19] in the future like they did like abraham
[17:21] when he met his crossroads
[17:22] he didn't know how he would do it god
[17:24] told him i'm going to give you a son
[17:26] 25 years he waited for it finally the
[17:28] son come and god said
[17:30] now by this son i'm going gonna make you
[17:31] the father of many nations take him up
[17:33] there and kill him
[17:35] take him up and kill him destroy the
[17:37] very thing that he'd wait
[17:38] 25 years on take him up and kill him
[17:42] abraham never worried it never bothered
[17:44] him he picked up the
[17:46] wood and put it up on a little donkey
[17:47] and took his son tucked him up the top
[17:49] of the hill
[17:50] to offer him up because abraham knew
[17:53] that he had received him as one from the
[17:55] dead
[17:56] sarah's womb was dead he was sterile so
[17:59] there's no way this boy he's 100 years
[18:01] old and she was 90.
[18:02] so he come by a promised word the same
[18:05] god that made the promise that i'll make
[18:06] you a father nations
[18:08] after 25 years and been 100 years old
[18:10] him and his wife
[18:11] received the child if god told him to
[18:13] offer him up god was able to raise him
[18:15] up
[18:18] praise god brother i feel religious
[18:24] oh how could i feel i know there's one
[18:26] thing he's
[18:27] able to raise him up again hallelujah
[18:30] we'll stand on that
[18:31] unadulterated word of light for this
[18:34] hour
[18:35] god will raise us up when this
[18:36] generation comes forth a shining light
[18:38] against this generation
[18:41] amen no wonder he said the queen of the
[18:42] south shall rise in the judgment
[18:44] with her generation and condemn this one
[18:46] because she came from that most parts of
[18:48] the earth
[18:48] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[18:50] greater than solomon and sharon
[18:52] how that little uh queen way down uh
[18:56] heathen
[18:56] saw that light and convert miles through
[19:00] the desert three months on a camel's
[19:02] back
[19:02] to sear the wisdom of solomon them
[19:05] standing right there was solomon being a
[19:06] type a figure of it and then come in
[19:09] seeing wesley
[19:10] luther all the others denominations back
[19:12] here being a figure in a type of what's
[19:14] happening now
[19:16] and they walk right through it oh
[19:19] all right far so the new year
[19:23] is determined by god just determined to
[19:27] stay in his word
[19:28] walk where the word says well as we come
[19:31] now to the close
[19:32] like others elected seed did in their
[19:35] day when they saw the word
[19:36] what did they do it they walked in if
[19:39] they were elected seed in other ages
[19:41] for he is the unfailing word
[19:44] how many believe that jesus christ is
[19:47] the word
[19:49] oh my i heard a program the other day of
[19:52] a
[19:53] certain denomination of people mr hms
[19:56] richard said
[19:57] it wrote the book for the year
[20:01] i don't want to disagree with the man
[20:02] like that although being a seventh-day
[20:04] adventist i don't
[20:05] agree with sebastian's doctrine but i
[20:07] certainly like the man
[20:09] i'll disagree with him that might be hms
[20:12] richard's
[20:13] book for the new year but my book and
[20:15] your book for the new year's the book of
[20:17] the whole year
[20:18] the bible god's word just make it
[20:21] live to what it's promised to live for
[20:23] yes sir
[20:24] and every coming year to come and every
[20:26] year that has been he's the eternal of
[20:28] god living through the eternal word that
[20:30] he spoke
[20:31] when every bible truth and every promise
[20:35] in it
[20:35] has been vindicated as it has been down
[20:38] to the ears
[20:39] how god promised that he'd destroy the
[20:41] world
[20:42] with water and he'd vindicated it by
[20:44] moses or by
[20:45] noah he promised that he would send to
[20:48] the liver and bring
[20:49] israel up out of egypt they sojourned
[20:51] for 400 years
[20:52] he did just exactly that amen and he
[20:55] swore that he'd raise up david
[20:57] how'd david be a son uh christ would be
[21:00] his son through david would come christ
[21:02] hi swore that he would do that he did
[21:04] just that he promised he would send
[21:06] john the baptist before the coming of
[21:08] jesus christ he did just that
[21:10] he promised he would send a messiah he
[21:12] did just that
[21:13] he promised the world would get into a
[21:15] great group of organizations and make a
[21:17] system
[21:17] of power known as a beast and would be
[21:20] up there sitting on seven hills it did
[21:21] just exactly that
[21:23] how the church should be persecuted unto
[21:24] death they did just exactly that
[21:26] how they come out in reformation they
[21:27] did just exactly that how he promised
[21:30] that each agent would be any promise for
[21:31] this age and here he is today
[21:33] making that word live just exactly like
[21:36] he did at the beginning
[21:38] certainly and when every promise is
[21:40] fulfilled
[21:41] death is sworn up in victory jesus will
[21:44] come and the last one is vindicated
[21:46] then there will come an eternal peace
[21:49] upon the earth and an eternal
[21:51] shalom an eternal shalom
[21:55] peace will rest upon the earth when
[21:57] jesus came the prince of peace
[21:59] why wasn't there peace because all the
[22:02] word wasn't fulfilled in his day
[22:05] he's fulfilling it today but when all of
[22:08] his promise
[22:08] were which was a thought of god a
[22:12] word is a thought expressed
[22:15] god in his thinking thought it and
[22:17] expressed it through his prophets and
[22:19] now it has to be fulfilled
[22:20] and when he foretold us of these things
[22:22] so we wouldn't make a mistake and
[22:23] blunder in darkness
[22:25] then when we see it being fulfilled now
[22:27] he promised to send christ the second
[22:29] time
[22:30] and whenever he does when christ comes
[22:32] the second time
[22:33] there will be an eternal shalom listen
[22:35] friends as we close
[22:37] remember the bible is the fountain of
[22:40] all wisdom it doesn't come from dr phdld
[22:46] it comes from the word of god
[22:49] there was doctors of divinity sitting
[22:51] there by the hundreds
[22:52] and a little 12 year old boy i called
[22:54] him down because he was the word
[22:57] a little boy had no education at all yet
[22:59] he was the word
[23:01] because he was the light spoken for that
[23:04] day he was
[23:04] manifesting that word the word was in
[23:07] him
[23:07] it had to be no wonder what he said come
[23:09] to pass because he was the word
[23:11] you understand all i understand say amen
[23:14] he was the word remember the bible not
[23:18] some book of the year
[23:19] that's written by man let every man's
[23:21] word be alive but mind the truth
[23:23] and cults and religions and and so forth
[23:26] all just get it so conglomerate up when
[23:28] you get a bunch of men into it
[23:30] god never did deal in such a group if
[23:33] jesus would come today would he take
[23:34] sides of the methodists
[23:36] but the baptist with the adventist
[23:38] jehovah witness
[23:39] christian science pentecostals
[23:41] presbyterians
[23:42] nasser he certainly would not
[23:45] it's an individual affair you and god
[23:49] there's no two men see eye to eye
[23:51] together alike
[23:52] no two thumbs like god deals with a
[23:55] individual and how you know whether he's
[23:57] right or not then look back and see if
[23:58] he's with the word
[24:00] if he's with the word then god's dealing
[24:01] with me isn't something else is dealing
[24:02] with it
[24:04] that's right remember the bible is the
[24:06] fountain of all wisdom
[24:08] and holds all the hopes of the future
[24:11] in it shalom god's peace
[24:15] like a story is told one time about a
[24:17] little boy lost his daddy
[24:19] before he was old enough to see his
[24:21] father just an infant baby when his
[24:22] father died
[24:24] one day he got about 10 12 years old he
[24:26] had another brother called john
[24:28] he went to his brother and he said john
[24:31] which is several years older
[24:33] said you you remember dad said yeah
[24:36] say what was he like said well he was a
[24:39] tall man and
[24:41] he was a very fine man he's always good
[24:43] to mother he was kind to
[24:45] me and he was kind to everybody he said
[24:47] well is that all you know about him john
[24:50] he said well i'll tell you said henry
[24:52] said
[24:53] everybody says i look like him and said
[24:56] everybody says
[24:57] i got a nature like him he said oh
[24:59] that's good that's what i want to know
[25:01] so when i see you i see my daddy there
[25:03] it is
[25:04] when the world sees jesus christ it'll
[25:07] be in you
[25:10] when this word that's written up today
[25:12] where do you see
[25:13] jesus and david when the word was made
[25:16] manifest through him
[25:17] how do you see christ god and elijah and
[25:21] that
[25:21] chariot going into heaven see jesus
[25:25] in elijah because the word was
[25:27] vindicated how do you see it in moses
[25:29] jesus is in moses the bible said so see
[25:32] that's right here's a burning bush that
[25:34] was with moses in the wilderness
[25:36] how will people know jesus christ one
[25:38] day he sees him
[25:39] in you when they see jesus in you for he
[25:43] said the works that i do
[25:44] shall you do also greater than this
[25:48] shall you do because i go to my father
[25:52] is that right that's how the world knows
[25:55] not because
[25:56] that the pentecostal oneness is greater
[25:58] than the pentecostal tunis or the two
[26:00] this is greater than a three this
[26:01] whatever you have not because of method
[26:04] this is greater than a baptism southern
[26:05] baptist taking
[26:06] the prize this year for all the all the
[26:08] baptist churches all the
[26:10] protestants they've got more members
[26:12] this year than and the rest of them i
[26:13] understand by the count
[26:15] that doesn't make them any different god
[26:18] doesn't know you by numbers the heathens
[26:19] got you outnumbered any time
[26:21] the catholics got you all
[26:23] mohammedanism's got all them
[26:25] see you're known when jesus christ
[26:28] lives in you by his life and promised
[26:31] word of this day reflects itself
[26:34] see now the same word that was reflected
[26:36] in moses could not be reflected
[26:38] in elijah because that's another day
[26:40] same one that was reflected in noah
[26:41] could not be in moses
[26:43] because see noah built an ark moses led
[26:45] a people
[26:46] just exactly what was promised the same
[26:48] light was reflected in one was than the
[26:49] other but one told of the other one
[26:52] all the new testament speaks of this
[26:54] hour jesus christ speaks at this hour
[26:57] who is it then some man it's jesus
[27:00] christ
[27:01] the son of god manifesting
[27:05] reflecting the light on the word that he
[27:07] promised for this day
[27:09] when man see you living like him
[27:12] when he sees your character your conduct
[27:15] with the word just exactly like he was
[27:17] the word being manifested
[27:18] then man will see jesus christ amen they
[27:21] won't have to look around anymore and
[27:22] say
[27:22] what does this creed teach what does
[27:24] that creed teach they'll know what god
[27:25] is when they see you
[27:27] shalom god's peace be like
[27:31] upon you and when god's word is
[27:33] vindicated in this age
[27:35] completely and you see it and believe it
[27:38] shalom to you face the new year with
[27:41] this
[27:42] but as david said i put him always
[27:44] before me because he's on my right hand
[27:46] i shall not be moved if you meet death
[27:49] this year what difference does it make
[27:50] god promise he'd raise you up
[27:52] if an accident kills you what difference
[27:54] does it make you have eternal life i'll
[27:56] raise him up in the last days
[27:57] amen what if anything happens no matter
[28:01] what it is nothing can separate us in
[28:03] the love of god that's in christ
[28:05] hunger peril nakedness no matter what it
[28:08] is
[28:09] nothing can separate us from the love of
[28:11] god that's in christ
[28:12] and he is the word shalom
[28:16] let's bow our heads
[28:22] everybody keep your head now just a
[28:24] moment
[28:27] god's peace gross
[28:31] as it was in the days of noah where they
[28:33] were eating drinking mary and given in
[28:35] marriage
[28:36] aren't about in the whole world of red
[28:38] light
[28:39] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[28:41] of man
[28:42] as it was at sodom where god was
[28:44] manifested in a human being
[28:47] and abraham called elohim the old
[28:50] sufficient one
[28:51] stood there eat meat drinking milk
[28:55] bread and could tell what sarah was
[28:58] thinking
[28:59] behind her behind him in the tent he
[29:01] said that will return again
[29:03] at the coming of the son of man a little
[29:06] while and the world won't see me no more
[29:09] yet ye shall see me for i will be with
[29:12] you
[29:12] even in you to the end of the world
[29:17] the jews returning to their land
[29:20] the things has taken place it is in this
[29:22] day would prevent
[29:24] from me from halfway beginning to tell
[29:26] you what's taking place but we see it
[29:28] what is it word made manifest
[29:33] what do you think the hebrews did when
[29:34] they seen the word made manifest
[29:37] well the promise they got ready to leave
[29:39] the land
[29:41] if you're not ready today friend start
[29:43] this new year
[29:44] outright start it with your hand in
[29:46] god's hand
[29:47] god's word in your heart said lord jesus
[29:50] i don't know what part of this symphony
[29:52] that you want me to play
[29:53] but when that junction comes for me to
[29:55] be persecuted laugh that made fun of
[29:58] i still take my stand that your sympathy
[30:01] will not be
[30:02] messed up because of me i'll stay right
[30:04] with your word no matter what it is
[30:06] i'll stay right there and when death
[30:08] beats up to my door
[30:09] that's part of the sympathy i know then
[30:11] this assures it beat death up to my door
[30:13] the resurrection will beat out one of
[30:15] these days too
[30:16] and you'll raise me up again it's part
[30:18] of your symphony
