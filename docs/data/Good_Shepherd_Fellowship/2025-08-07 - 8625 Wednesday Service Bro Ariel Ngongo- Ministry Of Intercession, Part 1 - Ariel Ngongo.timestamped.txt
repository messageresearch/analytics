[1:12] them out of the hand of the Egyptian to
[1:15] bring them up out of the land unto a
[1:18] good land enlarge, unto a land flowing
[1:22] with milk and honey, unto a pl a place
[1:25] of the Canaanite, of theite, of the
[1:27] Amorite, of the Perasites, and the
[1:29] Aites. and a jebside.
[1:31] This is a you know you this is the
[1:34] encounter that Moses is having with the
[1:37] burning bush.
[1:39] God is promising this. He says I see the
[1:41] affliction of my people. I have come
[1:43] down to deliver them.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45] &gt;&gt; But let me ask you something.
[1:48] Was God in Egypt physically? No.
[1:52] God says I have come down. I will be
[1:54] going to Egypt. But people the Egyptian
[1:57] did not see God. They see a man with a
[2:00] dry stick.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; You see, was God in Egypt? Yes, God was
[2:05] in Egypt. Where was God? He was there in
[2:07] the body of Moses.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; You see the power of a man that is
[2:12] commissioned by God to do a job.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Because when God sends you, he does not
[2:17] just say go by yourself. He goes along
[2:19] with you.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; He says let's go.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; God never say go by yourself. He can't
[2:24] let you go by yourself.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27] He has to be there with you. So if God
[2:29] revealed the word to you, you're not
[2:31] going by yourself.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; He's going with you.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; Because what you have in your heart is
[2:37] the promise. When you're carrying the
[2:39] promise, you're carrying the promise
[2:41] giver.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; You are not alone, saints.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; You might be going through things, but
[2:48] you're not alone. Hold on to the
[2:50] promise.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Take the promise of God. Walk through
[2:53] the fire.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56] Amen.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; When God says let go, let go, it does
[3:00] not mean you going by yourself.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to be there.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; You might see fire. You might see water.
[3:06] You might be seeing the Red Sea. But he
[3:08] says, "I will be with you." Amen.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; And I will never leave you.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[3:13] my my my.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; And Moses was God's prophet with a
[3:18] vindicated message to get him out of
[3:19] that place. It was not this man Moses
[3:22] that had a super, you know, his own
[3:24] ability as a man, but it was God.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; It was God that was actually driving the
[3:30] own thing. Moses was under the influence
[3:32] of that angel.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Hosea chapter 12:3,
[3:41] I like this scripture. Watch what the
[3:44] Bible is saying here. It says, "And by a
[3:47] prophet the Lord brought Israel out of
[3:50] Egypt,
[3:52] &gt;&gt; and by a prophet was he preserved."
[3:58] &gt;&gt; So Hosea 12:3
[4:03] prophet the Lord the Lord brought Israel
[4:07] out of Egypt and by a prophet was a
[4:11] preserve.
[4:13] So God preserved, protected. God guarded
[4:17] the children of Israel.
[4:19] It was not Moses as a man to do the work
[4:22] by himself. It was God that was actually
[4:25] preserving them.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; But he was using a man. He was using a
[4:30] prophet for that exodus.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; To take them out, to bring them into
[4:35] that promised land.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; That's why in the journey of your life,
[4:39] saints, God sent the word. He sent a
[4:42] prophet to guide you to that place where
[4:45] you have got to you have to go.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Because you need the Holy Spirit. You
[4:50] need the pillar of fire. You need a
[4:51] prophet to guide you there.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; You can't walk by yourself.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Israel did not even know the way.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Moses as a man, he did not know the the
[5:01] way, but he was under the influence of
[5:03] the angel.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Let's open Exodus chapter 23.
[5:11] I'm going to get into my message. I'm
[5:13] just going to lay the foundation first
[5:15] and then we'll fly real quick.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:20
[5:20] now. Watch what the scripture is saying
[5:22] here. It says, "Behold,
[5:25] I send an angel before thee."
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. We'll just read it from there.
[5:32] Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[5:35] keep thee in the way.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is an angel that is keeping
[5:39] you in the way.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; The way is long, but there is an angel
[5:45] that has been commissioned to guide you
[5:48] in the way, to keep you in the way.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; To bring thee into the place which I
[5:57] have prepared.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; There is a place that God had prepared.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; And that was in the promised land that
[6:04] he gave the commission to the angel. He
[6:06] had an angel that was going before them.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; To keep them in the way.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; To protect them, to guard them
[6:16] &gt;&gt; until they're going to go to arrive to
[6:18] the final destination.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; So this Christian life is not just I'm
[6:22] walking. No. No. There is an angel that
[6:24] is coming with me to bring me to my
[6:26] final destination.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; You know that we are under influence of
[6:32] angels.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:35] There are ministering spirits
[6:38] &gt;&gt; that are only sent to the ends of
[6:39] salvation.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; It's not everybody that has an angel.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Only those that got predestinated. There
[6:46] is an angel that goes along with them
[6:49] &gt;&gt; because they have been commissioned to
[6:50] bring them to the final destination.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; That's why there's no enough demon in
[6:55] hell that can stand on the way.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God, church.
[7:03] Now it was in a journey that they never
[7:07] gone before. It was a new they never
[7:09] been there before but that angel was
[7:12] leading them go this way. They could
[7:14] have taken another way than the Red Sea.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; But God was bringing them where the
[7:18] trouble was.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; They got to the Red Sea and they see, oh
[7:23] my goodness, what is going? They look
[7:24] behind. Pharaoh is coming. Left and
[7:27] right. There's mountains in front of
[7:28] them. The Red Sea. They didn't know what
[7:30] to do. But it was not the job of them to
[7:33] worry.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; It was the angel's job to do it
[7:37] &gt;&gt; because the promise was there.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your own ability. Look at
[7:44] the promise.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; Because every time that you look at your
[7:48] own ability, you will fail.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; How many of us have already failed? Let
[7:52] me be honest.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; I'll probably lift my hands. I failed.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Look at the promise. When you look at
[7:58] the promise, that's when God is making
[8:00] the way because that angel is showing
[8:02] you where to go.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; My We thank the Lord tonight.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; They were under influence of that angel
[8:12] while traveling from where you are to
[8:16] the place that you are going. There's an
[8:17] angel that is appointed. Now verse 21,
[8:20] it says, "Be aware of him. Obey his
[8:23] voice. Provoke him not
[8:25] &gt;&gt; for he will not pardon your
[8:27] transgression
[8:28] &gt;&gt; for my name is in him.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Obedience to the voice of that angel.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; So if that angel that is leading you the
[8:38] way is telling you take left, you follow
[8:41] left.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; If he tells you go right, you follow
[8:44] right.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Don't question. Just follow what the
[8:47] angel is saying.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; That that's very important. Obedience is
[8:54] one of the things
[8:55] &gt;&gt; when God gives his word, don't worry
[8:57] about what will happen. You just obey
[8:59] what he said.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; He can't fail.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that he cannot do
[9:04] is fail.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; God may not tell you where he's bringing
[9:08] you.
[9:09] You might be going through the Red Sea,
[9:11] maybe a deserted place,
[9:13] &gt;&gt; a place of no pasture, where there's no
[9:15] water, a place of danger,
[9:18] a place where you don't even know where
[9:20] how you're going to come out of it. But
[9:22] just listen to the voice
[9:24] &gt;&gt; of that angel.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Because God is about to set a trap for
[9:28] the enemy.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; So if he tells you, you probably trigger
[9:32] the enemy. That's why he doesn't even
[9:34] tell you.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; He puts traps for the enemy somewhere.
[9:38] He says, "No, certain things that this
[9:40] is what I'm going to take, but I'm going
[9:41] to bring them where danger is
[9:43] &gt;&gt; to show them that I to show them my
[9:46] power, my ability."
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; What I'm able to do.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has done it throughout the
[9:51] Bible. Throughout the Bible,
[9:53] &gt;&gt; you see that
[9:55] be aware, be watchful, be careful, and
[9:59] be cautious of that angel. Verse 22, but
[10:01] if that shall indeed obey his voice and
[10:05] do all that I speak, then I will be an
[10:08] enemy unto thy enemy and the adversary
[10:11] of the adversary. To the obedient,
[10:14] he will be the one that will be fighting
[10:15] the battle.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:17] You cannot disobey and expect God to do
[10:20] something.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; It requires obedience to his word to
[10:23] bring forth that fruit for you to enjoy
[10:26] the whole thing.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; And that required obed obedience.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; If the devil touches you,
[10:34] &gt;&gt; he will face him.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; If anyone who curses you,
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; shall be cursed.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Because you are follow, you are
[10:42] following. You are a followers. Amen.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; There is a leader that is there.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; It's not your problem. is the leader's
[10:47] problem.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Just to encourage somebody here.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; He repeats it again. He says, "For my
[10:54] angels shall go before thee to bring
[10:57] thee in unto the Amorite, theite, the
[10:59] parasites, the Canaanites, the the Aite,
[11:03] the Jebite, and I will cut them off."
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Sometime it's easy for us to believe
[11:10] these things, but we can't believe the
[11:11] God that is doing things in our own
[11:12] life.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[11:13] &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh, wow. I believe the Bible."
[11:15] But what is happening today? Can we
[11:18] believe God the same way?
[11:20] &gt;&gt; How many of us can believe God the same
[11:22] way?
[11:24] &gt;&gt; In impossible things, you can't trust
[11:25] God for it
[11:28] &gt;&gt; because he specializes in things like
[11:30] that.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; My You love the Lord.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; My He will bring you in.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; He will be the one to position you into
[11:42] the land of the promise. Amen.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; You were ordained to possess it.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; You were chosen. You were predestinated
[11:49] to possess it. It belongs to you.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; But you have to be obedient to that
[11:53] voice.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; You must follow the leadership of that
[11:55] angel
[11:57] &gt;&gt; to have all to be beneficiary of the
[11:59] whole things. You must obey that voice.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:05] Now
[12:08] we see here when they got to the Red
[12:09] Sea, Israel start complaining. The first
[12:14] thing they forgot
[12:16] that God has sent them a prophet. Do you
[12:19] see that? As a human being, we forget.
[12:22] They got to the Red Sea, they start
[12:24] complaining. It says because there were
[12:27] no grave in Egypt that thou has taken us
[12:30] away to die in the wilderness.
[12:33] They start questioning God.
[12:36] Didn't you see that is the one that got
[12:37] you out of after all these plagues that
[12:40] happened in Egypt
[12:41] &gt;&gt; for your for you?
[12:44] You could have got involved into an
[12:45] accident. God came to save you.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Amen.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; You were supposed to die a long time
[12:53] ago, maybe when you were a baby, but you
[12:55] you are.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Is it by your own power? No. And
[12:58] sometime because of those little things,
[13:00] we start complaining and questioning
[13:01] God.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; That's what Israel did.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Jesus.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; They got to the Red Sea, they start
[13:08] complaining. He says, "There's no grave
[13:09] in Egypt. Why are you going to bring us
[13:12] here?" They start questioning God.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Watch God's mercy and grace. It says to
[13:17] Moses, "Speak the word."
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? The Red Sea
[13:21] parted.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; God did not go over there and complain.
[13:26] He just told to Abra Moses. He says,
[13:28] "Speak the word."
[13:29] &gt;&gt; What happened? You know what happened
[13:32] &gt;&gt; miraculously?
[13:35] &gt;&gt; God departed the sea, the Red Sea. They
[13:38] got to this place called Mara. They
[13:40] didn't have water. The the water was
[13:42] bitter. The people start mamming against
[13:45] Moses. He says, "What are we going to
[13:47] drink? We don't have water. They just
[13:50] crossed the Red Sea. God opened the Red
[13:53] Sea before them.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; They sung songs of Moses.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; But now there's no water. They start
[13:58] complaining.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know there's no water in
[14:02] here. What are we going to do? You have
[14:04] brought us here to die because I mean
[14:06] what are we going to do with all this
[14:07] cattle that we that are following us?
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Men start complaining again.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; And God made the water sweet.
[14:19] God did it again.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; He did it again.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; But men, as men, as human being, we
[14:27] start complaining again.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; They got to a place where there's no
[14:31] food. They start murmuring against Moses
[14:34] and Aaron in the wilderness. Would to
[14:36] God we had died by the hands of of the
[14:39] Lord of the Lord in the land of Egypt,
[14:41] when is sat by the fl the flesh of part
[14:44] when we did eat uh bread to to the
[14:47] fullest to the fool for yet brought us
[14:50] forth into the wilderness to kill this
[14:52] whole assembly with anger. They start
[14:55] complaining about food now.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; They forget that God gave them water.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; They forgot that God parted the sea.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? They start complaining
[15:04] again.
[15:06] Oh no, I don't have this. Why everybody
[15:08] has that? Only me.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Look back what God has already done.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Look back what God remember what he has
[15:20] done
[15:21] &gt;&gt; before you complain.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; You see why we have to be grateful to
[15:25] the Lord.
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Because what had happened then is
[15:31] happening today.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Is happening in our life. Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; But I'm just here to remind you of one
[15:37] thing.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go ahead on myself.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; They got to a place there's no water.
[15:43] And Raphaim,
[15:45] sorry, Raphaim,
[15:47] the people with Moses, they got mad. He
[15:50] says, you know, we thirsty. We need
[15:52] water. And the murmur against Moses.
[15:57] He says, where are we going to get water
[15:58] again?
[16:01] God gave them water from the rock at
[16:03] orb.
[16:05] This is God. You know sometime we
[16:07] complain a lot. God is still giving.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I don't have money. It comes, he
[16:12] gives you money.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; You forgot to thank him.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; You walk away. It looks at you. He
[16:18] doesn't say anything.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I want children. I want
[16:22] children. Lord, everybody else are
[16:24] holding children. I don't have it. God
[16:26] comes miraculously. He give you a child.
[16:29] You come, oh wow, God is so good. Few
[16:31] months later, there's another situation
[16:32] that come. We complain again.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; But God is merciful, saints.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; They face the Amalecch. They face
[16:41] Amalecch. God gave them a great victory
[16:44] against Amalecch.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; You know, the Egyptian, the the the the
[16:47] Jews, they did not have, you know, they
[16:49] were not a great army, but they had a
[16:51] pill of fire.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; They had that angel. They were under the
[16:55] influence of that angel.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That angel was fighting the
[16:58] battle. When you go to bed, you don't
[17:00] see how many angels are fighting.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; You don't see it. You just wake up in
[17:04] the morning.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Sometime we forget to say, "God, thank
[17:07] you."
[17:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened last night,
[17:09] but Lord, I thank you tonight.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see
[17:19] now? He got to a place where Moses was
[17:22] in a mountain where the ten commandment
[17:23] was given unto him. Do you see that?
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's let's read this for a
[17:27] minute. I'm getting into my my sermon
[17:29] now. Exodus 2032:7.
[17:34] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go and
[17:36] get thee down." Now, this is the part
[17:39] where Israel built a calf and worship
[17:42] it. Do you see? You read the Bible, you
[17:44] you remember that they made a calf and
[17:47] said, "Moses is taking a long time. He
[17:49] has been gone for a long time. Let us
[17:52] make a calf here and worship him." They
[17:54] start worshiping a calf. That did not
[17:57] please God at all.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; And Moses God spoke to Moses. It says
[18:02] here verse 7, Exodus 32, and the Lord
[18:06] said unto Moses, "Go get thee down, for
[18:09] thy people and that which thou brotherth
[18:13] out of the land of Egypt have corrupted
[18:15] themselves." Now, I want you to notice
[18:17] something. The Lord is saying unto
[18:20] Moses, "These are your people.
[18:24] Do you see that?
[18:26] &gt;&gt; God is not saying this is my people. God
[18:28] is the one who chose them.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; He even sent Moses. But in this case
[18:33] when they sin, he looked to Moses says
[18:35] thy people have sinned.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Are we reading the Bible together?
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And they have turned aside
[18:47] quickly out of the way which I commanded
[18:50] them. I have made the uh sorry they have
[18:53] made a molden calf and have worshiped it
[18:56] and sacrificed there unto and said this
[18:59] be thy God oh Israel which has brought
[19:02] thee out of the land of Egypt.
[19:07] You see that? And the Lord said unto
[19:09] Moses, I have seen these people. Behold
[19:12] the this is a stiff neckaked people.
[19:16] Verse 10. Now therefore let me alone
[19:21] that my wrath may work hard against them
[19:25] that I may consume them and I will make
[19:30] of thee a great nation. God is literally
[19:34] saying let me destroy them. I'm ready to
[19:38] destroy them because they have broken my
[19:39] covenant.
[19:41] I helped them here. I've I've done this
[19:43] for them. But they the knife and they're
[19:46] complaining all the time and this sin
[19:48] that I have committed that has gone
[19:50] beyond what I can even now I'm ready to
[19:52] kill them. Do you see that?
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Is I broke the covenant
[20:00] because there was a covenant that was
[20:01] between them and God.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; And as long as they had that covenant,
[20:05] they were protected.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; They were guarded by that covenant.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; And now they start worshiping other
[20:10] gods. They start worshiping and and and
[20:12] offering sacrifices. You see that?
[20:16] But watch Moses standing in the gap.
[20:20] My my title is who will stand in the
[20:24] gap.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Watch what Moses is doing here.
[20:30] Verse 11. And Moses besought the Lord
[20:33] his God, and said, Why do why do thou
[20:39] wax hat uh wax hat against thy people?
[20:45] Moses, now you see that God was saying
[20:48] thy people, Moses, now Mo, you know,
[20:52] Moses is saying thy people to God. Do
[20:55] you see that?
[20:56] &gt;&gt; True.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? And Moses besought the
[21:00] Lord his God, and said, Why does thy
[21:02] wrath works hard against thy people,
[21:05] which thou brought forth out of the land
[21:09] of Egypt with great power and with great
[21:13] hand?
[21:16] Wherefore should the Egyptians speak,
[21:19] say, for mischief did he bring them out,
[21:22] to slay them in a mountain, and to
[21:24] consume them from the face of the earth.
[21:26] Turn from thy fairest wrath, and repent
[21:29] of this evil against thy people.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; This is a man
[21:37] &gt;&gt; talking to God.
[21:43] [Music]
[21:44] It's getting a little silence here.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; This is a man. But we have read in song
[21:48] they say a chosen.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Moses was what? Chosen.
[21:56] I want you to keep that in mind. Moses
[21:59] was chosen. It says therefore he said
[22:04] what will he destroy them? has now Moses
[22:07] his chosen stood before him in the
[22:11] bridge
[22:14] says why do you want to kill them what
[22:16] the other nation will say that's your
[22:19] people you got them out of Egypt you see
[22:23] God will never leave you
[22:26] &gt;&gt; oh glory to God will never leave you
[22:33] &gt;&gt; oh glory to God.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Moses stood in a bridge pleading,
[22:40] &gt;&gt; reminding God about his promises that he
[22:42] gave to Abraham.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Verse 13, remember now that's Moses
[22:48] speaking to God. He says, "Remember
[22:50] Abraham, Isaac, Israel, that servant, to
[22:54] whom thou swearth by thy own self?
[22:58] and said unto them, I will multiply your
[23:01] seed as the star of the earth and all
[23:03] this land have spoken of will. I give
[23:08] unto your seed and they shall inherit it
[23:10] forever.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; You cannot remember God your thoughts.
[23:15] Remember him his word.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Sometime we come God you see everybody
[23:19] are laughing at me. No, remember remind
[23:22] God of his word.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Not your thoughts,
[23:26] &gt;&gt; your thoughts will not stand before God.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; His word only will stand before him.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[23:38] &gt;&gt; My my. But the Bible says the Lord
[23:42] repented of the evil which he thought to
[23:46] do unto his people.
[23:48] Does it mean that God
[23:51] didn't know that Israel will sin or
[23:54] would do whatever? No, he knew it.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Do you think God was surprised?
[24:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; No. He knew all things.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; But God was trying to display something.
[24:07] God was was was pointing to a role that
[24:11] Christ will let her do for Abraham's
[24:14] race.
[24:17] It was it's the infinite. It knows the
[24:19] end before the beginning.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; But now he sees the approach because
[24:25] remember it was still the influence of
[24:26] that angel.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Moses as he was thinking pleading for
[24:31] the people. Moses maybe did not know it
[24:35] but it was the spirit of Christ in Moses
[24:39] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap for the people.
[24:41] Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; So if you are a chosen son and a
[24:45] daughter of God, you have a job to do.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Because if you know your position with
[24:51] God, then you know where you have to
[24:53] stand.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; So when you're standing in the gap, you
[24:57] playing a role.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; You know, he did it by revelation, not
[25:03] knowing. But that but Bam says
[25:04] something. I I'll read something a quote
[25:06] here.
[25:09] uh standing in the gap. Paragraph 40.
[25:11] I'm going ahead of myself, but that's
[25:12] okay. Now, today, if God was going to
[25:16] liquidate the people,
[25:18] and there was a time that when God had
[25:21] gotten tired of fooling with our sin, we
[25:25] constantly going wrong. Who would stand
[25:28] like Moses today for the people? Where
[25:31] would we find a person that will stand
[25:34] and could stand and God would accept
[25:37] like he did Moses?
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[25:41] &gt;&gt; It says, "And Moses own life on earth
[25:45] meant so much to God till he stayed the
[25:48] wrath of God and would not cross over
[25:52] Moses."
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; But what was pushing Moses to do that?
[26:00] It was the spirit of Christ in Moses.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; So, it's God playing here through the
[26:08] life of Moses to show us what he will
[26:10] later do.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; For you and I.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Do you see this? Do you see a little bit
[26:15] of picture here?
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Another message. what I'm saying. And
[26:21] Moses threw himself in the front of God,
[26:24] bre bridged his way and said, "God, take
[26:29] me."
[26:30] And God could not cross that man. Watch
[26:33] what the prophet says. A power of a
[26:36] saint before God.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; You can stand also for your family.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you are a scented son and
[26:47] daughter of God, you can also stand in
[26:49] the bridge for someone.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Because if the spirit of Christ is in
[26:54] you, you will do what Christ did.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; With Moses, it was the Christ is the
[27:00] spirit of Christ that was leading him to
[27:02] stay in the bridge.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; The power of a chosen son and a daughter
[27:13] of God.
[27:16] that can stand between a angry God and a
[27:18] sinful sinful people.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; God is seeking for a man to stand in the
[27:23] gap. We just read in the book of Ezekiel
[27:26] &gt;&gt; is asking I want to see who will stand
[27:28] in the gap who will be praying for the
[27:31] abomination that is happening in the
[27:32] land.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Who will stay alone in prayer for your
[27:36] brother? You know how many of our family
[27:38] members are still in the world?
[27:41] If we have received God, how many of
[27:44] them through your life have come to know
[27:46] Christ?
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them the sp the
[27:50] saving power of God?
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them that Jesus
[27:54] saves?
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Who's going to tell them that Jesus is a
[27:56] healer?
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to say it.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; And that's every single one of us.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; And to do it, we must be the chosen of
[28:08] God
[28:08] &gt;&gt; to stand in the bridge. Mhm.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of Abraham.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; How he stood in the bridge for Lot.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; What about Esther?
[28:18] &gt;&gt; She stood in the bridge for her people.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; There were people in the Bible.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; So if we are anointed by the same
[28:24] spirit, we must do the same thing.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; But the question is to the church,
[28:31] &gt;&gt; where are we at?
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Is Christianity just going to church?
[28:37] &gt;&gt; You see, it's more than that.
[28:40] And God is dealing with our heart.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; It's not just about going to church, but
[28:45] it's to make a change.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; How many people outside are being
[28:48] influenced by our life?
[28:54] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; How many of us need God's grace?
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; It says the power of a saint before God.
[29:07] My my
[29:09] the souls that that are in prison. He
[29:11] says, watch what brother says here. He
[29:13] says there was a scripture that always
[29:16] puzzle me. He says how that Moses could
[29:20] tell God a better idea than God had till
[29:24] I found out that it was the spirit of
[29:28] Christ in Moses.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[29:31] &gt;&gt; It says God said, Moses, separate
[29:34] yourself from them. I will destroy the
[29:36] whole thing
[29:37] &gt;&gt; and start with you.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; And he said, Lord, I he throw himself in
[29:43] the bridge saying take me
[29:46] &gt;&gt; plot out my name of these very people
[29:49] that had rebelled and his heart went for
[29:53] them.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Say, do you see this?
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:58] after all the rebel rebellious people
[30:01] that make his life a you know harder but
[30:06] Moses was still willing to stay in the
[30:08] cup for them
[30:10] &gt;&gt; he went before God and said Lord please
[30:12] forgive me forgive them you know let's
[30:16] continue to read here
[30:17] &gt;&gt; verse 32 chapter 32:30
[30:20] are you happy are you tired
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen brother
[30:26] &gt;&gt; my goodness 32 2 verse 30. It's a Bible
[30:30] study, right? Is that right?
[30:32] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass on the tomorrow.
[30:34] That's after the people have sinned.
[30:37] They have done something wrong and God
[30:38] was mad at them and and many of them
[30:40] died too. But now Moses saying something
[30:44] with God. This is a conversation with
[30:45] Moses and God. And it came to pass on
[30:48] the moral Moses said unto the people,
[30:50] "You have seen a great scene, and now I
[30:52] will go up unto the Lord. Perventure
[30:57] I shall make an atonement." Oh, glory to
[31:01] God.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; This is a man that is born out of is is
[31:06] a a natural man like you and I.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying here. Says, "Pray
[31:13] a venture. I will make an atonement for
[31:15] your sin.
[31:18] See, it's not just Moses. You as well.
[31:21] You can stand in the gap for somebody.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; You as a parent, you can stand in the
[31:27] gap for your children.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Job did it. He was offering the
[31:31] sacrifice for his children. Maybe pray
[31:33] my children have sinned against God. He
[31:36] was offering the sacrifice.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; What about our parents? Our parents
[31:42] maybe they don't even know God.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Can we stand in the gap and tell them a
[31:46] little bit about God
[31:48] &gt;&gt; about our own experience?
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Can they say in see your life and see
[31:52] the change?
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Can our parents you know can look at us
[31:57] and say wow that child is no longer what
[31:59] they used to be.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Something had happened to them.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; They used to have an anger issue but
[32:06] they no longer have that. Wow. Only God
[32:08] can do that. Amen.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; They used to struggle with this, with
[32:12] smoking. But no, no, no, no. Only God
[32:14] can change that.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; You know when you preach to a person
[32:17] like that, you they will believe it.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; They can doubt it.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Because they've seen that message.
[32:23] Whatever you preaching, they've seen it
[32:25] in your life.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; What about toward our husband and wife?
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Sometime our wife does not believe. We
[32:33] go over there and say, "Man, this is a
[32:34] pacing from here." But how many times
[32:35] you stay on the knees praying for the
[32:37] wife?
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Oh our husband man is it's really bad.
[32:40] Is I don't even know what he's doing.
[32:42] But how many time you stay on your knees
[32:44] praying for your husband?
[32:48] &gt;&gt; How many of us stands in the gap for
[32:51] somebody every day?
[32:54] &gt;&gt; But we're busy. But how many of us are
[32:56] standing in the gap?
[32:57] &gt;&gt; The question is who is going to stand in
[33:01] the gap?
[33:04] who is going to stand in the gap.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; And Moses knew his position in God. He
[33:10] was commissioned, chained, as sent,
[33:13] chosen for deliverance.
[33:15] He knew that God could not plot out his
[33:17] name out of his book.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz the lamb's book is sealed with his
[33:22] own blood.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; He cannot take away your name out.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; That's the power of a chosen son,
[33:29] daughter of God. You have the right to
[33:30] do it, saints, tonight.
[33:33] It's not just attending church. Let's
[33:35] enter into action. If we believe, let's
[33:38] work now
[33:40] &gt;&gt; because faith involve also work.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; You cannot say I believe and we sit
[33:45] there and I relax. No, no, no. The
[33:47] reason why if you have really believed,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; that faith will put you in action.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; If you are really saved, that salvation
[33:55] will put you in action.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; To seek for lost souls.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] How many of our family knows that we
[34:04] have received such a message?
[34:07] &gt;&gt; How many people on the street knows that
[34:09] God has sent a prophet in this
[34:10] generation? We don't even talk about it.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; We don't we can't talk about money. We
[34:15] can talk about how many houses we have.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to God, we don't even
[34:19] mention it.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[34:28] Moses verse uh chapter 33:12
[34:32] Moses says unto the Lord see thou has
[34:35] saith unto me bring up these people and
[34:39] thou has not let me know whom thou th
[34:43] that will sent with me yet thou has said
[34:48] I know thee by name and thou has also
[34:51] found grace in my sight now therefore I
[34:54] pray thee if I have found grace in thy
[34:57] side. Show me now thy way I may know
[35:00] thee, that I may find grace in thy
[35:03] sight. Consider that this nation is thy
[35:07] people. Do you see that?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "My presence shall go
[35:12] with thee." That's God that is speaking
[35:15] to me.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; "My presence shall go with thee, and I
[35:19] will give thee rest." Oh my. And he said
[35:22] unto him, "If thy present go not with
[35:25] me, carry us not up then.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; I will not go until I feel your
[35:31] presence."
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Prove me that you have forgiven these
[35:37] people.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; You cannot just say, "Oh God, I'll pray
[35:39] for my family members and walk away."
[35:41] You have to make sure God are they going
[35:43] to be saved?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; my children say, "Are you going to save
[35:47] them? Prove to me that you're going to
[35:49] save them. Give me a sign that you're
[35:50] going to save them.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to stay in the gap.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; It's not just a little prayer and leave.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; It's a constant prayer.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; It's a constant prayer.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Times time is not really our
[36:09] friend.
[36:12] But here it was Christ in Moses standing
[36:15] in the gap interceding
[36:18] advocating for the people.
[36:21] Let me read something here.
[36:31] You know when God allow things to
[36:33] happen,
[36:35] God intention is not to to bring you
[36:38] down his wrath upon his people or to
[36:41] bring judgment.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; He always extend mercy.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; He want you to be safe. He want you to
[36:48] have an experience. He want you to be
[36:50] happy.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; He want you to be happy. God want you to
[36:55] be happy. Sometime when things negative
[36:57] happen in your life say no I feel like
[36:59] God doesn't want me to be happy. No, he
[37:01] wanted to be happy,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; you know, but he's seeking for a man
[37:06] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap that will be having
[37:08] a burden for for your brother, for your
[37:10] sister. Say, "Lord, I want you to deal
[37:12] with them."
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Even in our church, if somebody's
[37:15] dealing with something, pray for them.
[37:17] They may not even know it.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Just pray for them. Stay a little
[37:20] longer. Say, "Lord, I've been
[37:21] interceding for this brother."
[37:24] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ, not
[37:26] criticizing them.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's easy for that spirit
[37:30] to come in our midst.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Instead of us praying,
[37:33] &gt;&gt; we are spending more time criticizing.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, this one is doing this way. Can you
[37:39] wake up the brother, please?
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; You know, may God help us
[37:48] that we'll have time to stay on our
[37:50] knees praying.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And
[37:54] &gt;&gt; advocating
[37:55] &gt;&gt; for our church.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know the pastor does it.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; That's not just the pastor's job. It's
[38:01] all of us. But who's going to stand in
[38:03] the gap for him?
[38:05] &gt;&gt; So if he's standing in the gap for your
[38:07] family, who's going to stand for him
[38:08] then?
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to stand in the gap for
[38:13] him?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody need to pray for him.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; God is seeking a man.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; I sought for a man among them. Thank
[38:26] you, Lord.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; That should make up the edge
[38:31] &gt;&gt; that will stand in the gap before me for
[38:34] the land
[38:36] &gt;&gt; for the church
[38:38] &gt;&gt; for your family.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; For your neighbor,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; maybe your neighbor is the last elect
[38:47] &gt;&gt; before the rapture take place. Yeah,
[38:50] &gt;&gt; but you must be you must have that
[38:52] burden until one day God will help you
[38:55] to say you go knock at his door. Hey
[38:57] &gt;&gt; neighbor. Hey I just want to tell you
[38:59] about God how he dealt with me.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; And after ministering to that person
[39:05] after standing in the gap for that
[39:06] person that can trigger the rapture.
[39:08] Maybe he's the last person.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; You don't know that.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; But God want you to have a burden. Maybe
[39:15] this message might be very simple.
[39:18] And I know it is simple.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Might get a little boring and quiet.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; But s let me tell you something. There's
[39:25] a reason why
[39:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching this message just
[39:28] preaching it.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; There is a reason behind this.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; It's a normal Wednesday.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; But for somebody, it's not going to be
[39:38] that Wednesday.
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody must sending the go for
[39:48] somebody.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; We cannot let our children in the world
[39:52] and wondering.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; They are our inheritance.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait for Joseph to be
[40:00] 20.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; I have to start now.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Oh, no. My children are
[40:05] still little. I mean, they're innocent."
[40:07] The enemy is still hunting even the
[40:09] little ones. Yes.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; So the time that you spending on your
[40:13] knees today would have an impact 20
[40:16] years if the Lord
[40:17] &gt;&gt; ter
[40:20] &gt;&gt; those prayer will guard the children
[40:21] when they about to go this that angel is
[40:23] telling them come back this way.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Because of your prayer 20 years ago
[40:29] &gt;&gt; because you were standing in a gap for
[40:30] your family 20 years ago.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; We I am standing here because somebody
[40:35] 20 years ago was praying.
[40:38] [Music]
[40:40] Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; There was a woman, there was a man that
[40:43] was praying for me to stand here.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; I never even know that I will stand
[40:47] here.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; But somebody back there 20 years ago was
[40:51] on the knees praying, "God, please help
[40:53] this young man."
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to stand in the gap.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:03] When Adam's race was all backed up into
[41:06] the corner, death and sickness on every
[41:09] side,
[41:12] Adam's race was defeated,
[41:14] outnumbered by demon power.
[41:18] You see that the law had failed, the
[41:21] prophet had failed because they were
[41:23] human.
[41:24] Diseases and ignorance had collapsed
[41:27] them into a place until there were no
[41:30] hope left.
[41:32] Because nobody was worthy. Adam rest had
[41:36] fallen. There was nobody to stand in
[41:38] between. There was nobody to stand in
[41:41] the gap.
[41:43] But God himself said, "No, I can't let
[41:46] these people in this condition.
[41:48] In his mind, he had already slain a
[41:51] lamb.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; He already made a way.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; But Moses was just displaying
[41:58] Christ. It was Christ in Moses that was
[42:01] showing how to stand in the gap. You can
[42:03] see in the life of David. You can see in
[42:06] the life of Abraham standing for Lot,
[42:08] Esther and all of those.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; But that was the spirit of God to do it.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; It was just to show us there is one that
[42:14] is coming.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; That would do that will fulfill all of
[42:18] that.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; And Adam race was in that place where
[42:23] there was no there was no they were
[42:26] helpless, no hope.
[42:31] John in the book of Revelation chapter 5
[42:35] it says no man in earth that no man in
[42:40] heaven nor in earth neither under the
[42:43] earth was able to open the book because
[42:46] Adam had lost that book he had lost that
[42:49] authority
[42:51] John elitic says nobody was ready to
[42:54] open this nobody's able to save us.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; But he wept much because no man was
[43:03] found worthy.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; No man was able to stand in the gap for
[43:08] Abraham's race a h Adam race because
[43:12] they all have fallen into sin.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Nobody was perfect.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Joseph who was closer to the perfect
[43:21] really close
[43:23] he told the lie.
[43:26] All of them had failed. The law had
[43:28] failed.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; But there was one that had to come.
[43:32] That was our Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says something here.
[43:38] Brother one read that quote on Sunday.
[43:41] You know when brother one read that
[43:42] quote, I said, "Please, brother one,
[43:44] don't go in that direction." I'll read
[43:45] it again. The mighty conqueror.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] It says, "But oh brother and sister," I
[43:53] think that's quote number six. Okay. It
[43:56] says, "Uh, six."
[43:59] Perfect. But oh brother and sister, what
[44:02] was such a little things to one day when
[44:05] Adam race was backed up against the
[44:08] wall? You see that they had no they had
[44:12] prophets. They had had laws.
[44:16] They had killed the prophets and
[44:17] destroyed the law. And Adam race was
[44:20] backed up, helpless, hopeless against
[44:24] the coming of the enemy. The devil and
[44:27] all his host host well trained spirit
[44:30] beings. The mortal were no match for
[44:34] them at all. And what could they do?
[44:38] They were helpless. Do you see that? Do
[44:41] you see that? It says, "But there was
[44:44] one
[44:45] &gt;&gt; who stepped out in glory. from the bas
[44:49] of the father
[44:50] &gt;&gt; and he said I will go down this day and
[44:55] give my life for Adam fallen race
[44:59] &gt;&gt; let's continue
[45:00] &gt;&gt; oh glory to God
[45:02] &gt;&gt; it says and when he was here on earth
[45:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[45:06] &gt;&gt; he found the darkness part of the spear
[45:08] that conquered men
[45:11] &gt;&gt; and was dead and he grabbed an arful of
[45:15] them at cover and and and and plugged
[45:18] itself to death.
[45:21] That's our Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; It says and left the commission with
[45:26] what?
[45:28] &gt;&gt; His church
[45:30] ragged group uneducated illiterate
[45:33] fishman. Fisherman. He never left a just
[45:36] stick and stone to fight with. But on
[45:40] the day of Pentecost,
[45:42] &gt;&gt; he put the greatest weapon
[45:44] &gt;&gt; in the church sin. Yes.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And he never it never had. He said,
[45:50] "Follow me and fight with all that is in
[45:53] you."
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to stand in the gap for
[46:03] Abra Adam's human race.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; He came out victorious.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; He redeemed and released us from the
[46:12] bondage of sin. Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You see that he broke our chains.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; He forgive our sin for never to be
[46:21] remembered.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; He fulfilled the law for us. Glory to
[46:25] God.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; And he paid the price. He paid our debt
[46:28] with his own blood.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz no man could stand. Let's read some
[46:34] scripture here. 1 Timothy chapter 2
[46:37] verse 5. I'm coming to the closure soon
[46:39] here.
[46:41] 1 Timothy 2:5 it says, "For there is one
[46:45] God and one mediator between God and
[46:49] man."
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; It says, "The man Christ Jesus."
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; In another scripture, John 14:6, Jesus
[47:00] said unto them, I am the way. You see
[47:03] that way that he was leading them, he
[47:06] was the way.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way. Amen.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; The truth and the life. No man cometh
[47:13] unto unto the father but by me.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; He was the one in who made the bridge.
[47:19] He was the one in between God and sinful
[47:22] men.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But Moses was displaying that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 5
[47:33] verse 10. For if when we were enemies,
[47:38] we were reconciled to God by the death
[47:41] of his son, much more being reconciled,
[47:45] we shall be saved by his life.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to stay in the cup for you
[47:53] and I.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[47:57] &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2 verse one. My
[48:00] little children, this thing right add
[48:02] unto you that ye sin not. If any man
[48:06] sin, we have an advocate. Oh, glory to
[48:10] God.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; We have an advocate with the father,
[48:13] Jesus Christ the righteous.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And he is the propitiation for our sin.
[48:19] Not for our our uh our only but also for
[48:25] the sin of the whole world.
[48:28] Do you see that? And I'm going to close
[48:31] with this uh this quote here.
[48:34] Somebody has to stay in the gap.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Quote number seven.
[48:40] Christ the bread of life
[48:42] comes down from heaven emiliating
[48:45] himself
[48:47] giving his life that through his life we
[48:51] might have surgeon surgeoning mercy.
[48:54] Where did that come from? out of the
[48:58] pillar of fire. That's where he dropped
[49:01] out of. He was up there. That was Christ
[49:05] himself. The logos, the angel of the
[49:08] covenant. You see that Moses stood h
[49:12] forsook Egypt not knowing where he was
[49:14] going. But he was on this road. The
[49:17] children of Israel followed and God
[49:20] promised that the angel will lead him.
[49:23] Do you see that? And look, God said, "I
[49:27] will put my name in him."
[49:30] He won't pardon your transgression. So
[49:33] be aware of him. He has not been he
[49:39] hadn't been made flesh yet to dwell
[49:42] among us to shed his blood to take away
[49:45] our sins. So the blood of the lamb and
[49:49] goat was very very fragile. You see
[49:53] that? it would break easy. But now the
[49:58] blood of Christ once said cleans until
[50:03] the day of redemption
[50:05] &gt;&gt; and all the way through once perfected
[50:08] through sanctifying process of the Holy
[50:11] Spirit by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[50:14] Christ. The believer is anchored until
[50:18] the day of redemption. What? Yes sir.
[50:22] Ephesians 4:30,
[50:24] grave not the Holy Spirit of God whereby
[50:28] you are sealed unto the day of
[50:30] redemption.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 80 86.
[50:35] Don't just take the scare of it now.
[50:39] God is with us.
[50:43] Although you sin, now we're coming to a
[50:45] closure here. Although you sin, you got
[50:49] an advocate.
[50:51] Tell God you are sorry.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Come on back.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; That's the way to do it. Don't think you
[50:59] are cast off forever. Oh my goodness.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; As long as you still have enough desire
[51:06] to come to this church.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; God is still with you. That's why sure
[51:16] he is.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; God's grace
[51:27] &gt;&gt; and mercy
[51:29] &gt;&gt; is still available.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; If you are standing here, if you're here
[51:35] because somebody had prayed for you.
[51:39] If you say, "Oh no, all my family
[51:40] members are not in the message. They
[51:42] don't believe."
[51:44] But there's this man called Jesus.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; He thought of you before the foundation
[51:49] of the world.
[51:51] He knew that you would come to this
[51:52] church today.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; He knew that you will believe what you
[51:56] are believing.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; And he stood on the in the gap for you
[52:01] &gt;&gt; to save you. Saint, you see, we have to
[52:06] stop complaining.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; We have to be thankful of what God is
[52:09] doing in our life.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; But who's going to stand in the gap? He
[52:13] already did it.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; This is your time
[52:17] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap for somebody else.
[52:20] It must be the spirit of God. Even
[52:21] tonight, maybe somebody may not catch
[52:23] this.
[52:26] But somebody got to stand up.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; If that spirit dwells in you,
[52:31] you know, if you have the spirit of tar
[52:34] in you, you will do what Tarzan did.
[52:39] That's true. But if you have the spirit
[52:42] of Christ in you, you will do what
[52:44] Christ did.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a different spirit.
[52:48] is going to be the same spirit.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; May God help us
[52:53] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gut for somebody else.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe next to you there is a brother and
[52:58] a sister that you know a situation
[53:00] about. You know what they are dealing
[53:03] with.
[53:05] If you can do don't criticize them. Pray
[53:07] for them.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord Jesus.
[53:24] Can we play only
[53:27] please?
[53:32] How many of us tonight
[53:34] want to lift your hand and say, "Lord, I
[53:36] want to stand in the gap." Tonight, as
[53:38] we're about to pray,
[53:41] I want you to remember somebody tonight.
[53:44] If you don't have anybody to pray
[53:47] for, please remember me.
[53:52] Remember our pastor.
[53:56] He's far.
[53:59] But this meeting that expected that he
[54:01] has to preach, he will depend on our
[54:03] prayer.
[54:05] He will need our prayer to stand in the
[54:07] gap for him and say, "Lord, please
[54:10] help our pastors, Father. May you keep
[54:13] him. May you protect him. May you
[54:16] minister to the people. What about
[54:18] family members? What what about our
[54:20] children, our wives, our husband?
[54:26] May God help us. Heavenly Father,
[54:33] we are coming before you tonight
[54:37] with your people, Lord, with this simple
[54:39] message.
[54:42] But Lord, you have placed a burden in my
