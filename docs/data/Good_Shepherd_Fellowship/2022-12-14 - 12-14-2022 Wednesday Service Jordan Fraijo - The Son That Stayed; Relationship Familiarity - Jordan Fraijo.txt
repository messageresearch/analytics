amen ready for the word [Music] we will bring you announcements on on Sunday for what will be planning for the holiday weekend because most of the time Christmas you know people spend with family and loved ones this Christmas come on Sunday so it's a worship Christmas praise the Lord and but we looking at the weather also for how it would be next week uh I I got a report yesterday that brought a team as Sean had a little high blood pressure so he had to go into the hospital and uh and and the doctors kept him there to observe him so uh I'm not sure he'll be able to travel but uh we might have brother Stephen ajaro back again visiting with us on the weekend so we are either planning to have a weekend Service uh Saturday night Sunday morning and then we can have you excuse you for Wednesday so uh but we will bring more of that on on Sunday by the grace of God praise the Lord and so that's that's the plan for for next week and so let's just sing a song here then and then we will call the preacher for the night of uh oh I have this chorus on my mind is leaving my mind I thought we were going to to practice a song or two but I got in a little bit late so uh I just had a song leader just going on with uh with the worship and I had a chorus on my mind uh foreign covered by the blood you know we sang the song cover me cover me so that song kept playing on my mind [Music] I am covered by his God I'm walking by faith Justified oh yes I am me oh I am covered I am covered one more time [Music] Jesus one more time what my face [Music] thank you mine hey man [Music] covered by his blood walking by faith living in love [Music] it's just such a beautiful thing you know you have to I don't know that the song reader was thinking about it when he wrote it but you have to have it in that order you see if you weren't covered by the blood it'd make it a whole lot harder to walk by faith but because you know you're covered by the blood you can walk by faith knowing no matter where you go he's leading you no matter what happens you have the covering of the blood over you you don't have to be afraid you don't have to worry about where you're going or what you might do because he's leading you and even if you might have a misstep even if you might backslide in some point you're covered by the blood but he looks down he still sees a sin the saint because when he looks down to the blood he doesn't see that he just sees the Son and Daughter of God and that's why you're living in love because his love just encapsulates around you say it's just beautiful it's just beautiful you can't help but love a God Like That my goodness my goodness it's just so wonderful to be back in service here with all of you and here on a Wednesday night like for the one said we're all watching the weather because the weather is doing what it wants and it's not sure if it wants to be winter or fall or or go back to Spring and uh it's just such a privilege to be here you know so many times I think we watch the weather for a lot of the times when we have obligations to things and sometimes we watch the weather and we see the weather get bad and we're like yes don't have to do that but I think you can take a look and oh I'm sure we've all had it on a Wednesday night you had a busy week and you know that back thought oh man you know whether maybe I don't have to go and I'm busy and that's a good excuse but I think in every son and daughter of God even on days like that there's something in you where you're like well whether or not I'm gonna go and only if the weather's real bad I'm going to stay home you know but there's something about it where you know you can come to the place in the house of God and it has nothing to do with the building but he instruct us to gather together to draw strength one from another he wanted us to come and and actually bring our experiences together that's why he sent them all to the upper room there in the day of Pentecost it wasn't because he couldn't have they couldn't have all been in their separate homes and he couldn't have got his omnipresent he could have met each of them right in the place where they were at if he wanted to but he wanted all of them to bring their flame together so that when it was lit on fire it'd be something so bright burning so like furiously that the people couldn't help but recognize it and see it and that's what happened on the day of Pentecost is when the fire the that little lick of tongue of fire on each and every individual was all in one place and it poured out onto the street the people couldn't help but notice and that's what it's about for each one of us when we come into service it's not because God couldn't meet us in our home or he couldn't meet us in a place by ourselves and there's times for that but God wants us to bring our little flames of fire and maybe some of us have got a Burning Flame that is nice and bright and is visible and everyone can feel it even some of us have just got a just a little bit of a spark left but if you bring that all together sooner soon enough when they all are put in the same room together they'll all burned at the same intensity you see that's what we're here for is so that those of us who are burning intensely then then help the one next to us because maybe their Sparks about to go out and rekindle that thing inside of them and the one who's and vice versa and we some of us some days are better than others for some of us and and someday we're the spark and someday we're the flame but God knew that it would be the way it would be and he said that's why go gather yourself together Rejoice around the word and share that flame together let's just go right to the word I'm going to let you guys sit down here um if we can oh I'm sorry I was talking to the Musicians um let's turn in our the scripture to Luke 15. I wasn't real clear there um got a little thought here and by God's grace we'll be able to share that and just speak from the heart Luke chapter 15 25-32 we'll read that and then and then I'll let everyone else sit down um and it reads like this now his Elder son was in the field and as he came and Drew Nye to the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father have killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and entreated him and he answered ring saith to his father load these many years do I serve thee neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment yet thou never gave us me a kid that I might make Merry with my friends but as soon as thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou has killed for him the fatted calf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me all that I have is thine it was meat that we should make Mary and be glad for thy brother was dead and is alive again was lost and has found let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just ask you to come and take full control the service father Lord and just have your way we know you're here your presence is here for you said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I would be also Father and Lord the Saints have come they've gathered they've worshiped they've praised father Lord they've made themselves ready Lord and I've come and desire to set myself to the side father but or even in that I need you father so I ask you just come have your way set me to the side Lord and with this little thought if it's where you would want to go then father then may you make it a reality to the people and if it's not then Lord you just take us wherever you want father or we dedicate ourselves back to you asking that you'd come and have your way in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated you know we're going to go ahead and turn to Luke 10. verse 38 through 42. Luke 10 38 through 42. and it reads now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard his word but Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said Lord Dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid heard therefore that she helped me and Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her I want to take a little thought and if I was to give it a title I would call it the Sun that stayed in a relationship of familiarity no as you all know if you didn't catch it already is that that first scripture we read was actually about the Elder son and the story of The Prodigal Son right and I think that the prodigal son is usually the sun that's that's spoken about and taught on and if a preacher is going to preach he preached about that particle son the one who took the father's goods and went out into the world and squandered them away and and used them all up and then the Redemption of that sun coming back and the father going forth to meet him and and we all know that story so well but very rarely do you ever take time have I ever seen someone take time to take and and look at that Elder son you see the Elder son made no demands of the father like the younger son the Elder son caused no problems this guy was a worker in fact I think if you read the the story in Luke it says that the younger son came to the father and said give me that which is mine and then the next thing that happens is he takes that and walks away and I'm I'm gonna blink right now on whether or not this Parable is told in the other gospels but at least in Luke it never says that the eldest son came to the father and said well if you're giving him his give me mine also it doesn't so the younger son takes it and runs away and the Elder son just stays there and keeps on working keeps on working away and here the part that we're reading is here years and years later when the younger son comes back the father goes out to meet him he's rejoicing he's having a good time and the Elder son comes in from still working and he asked the servants said what's up with the party why didn't word I didn't hear anything we didn't have anything planned you know typically if there's something going on I I he was probably the one who planned most of the events if he was a worker if he was a doer the father probably didn't do much at all that's why he could stand out at the road watching for the younger son all the time because he had this responsible older son that taken on the father's business in every single way possible he was busy he put himself about the father's business in every way imaginable because he was working towards adoption he knew that in order to reach adoption you had to apply yourself in every aspect of the father's work so that eventually it will get turned over to you because the father would be so confident in your abilities and the work that you do and he said you know what he can just take it he can do it full responsibility whatever my son says that goes because I know the decision he'll make would be exactly the same as me so here this elder son has been working that whole time towards that pinnacle and so now he comes home after working again and he gets greeted by this party that he he didn't plan and so he says what's going on must have been a real something special for it to happen this quick and me not know about it and he calls one of the other servants from around the house and he said what's up what kind of what dignitary what world leader came in on the spur of the moment no planning that I didn't know about who is the special person what is the special event and he gets told oh well you know your younger brother the one who took away half the family fortune and ran off and uh used it all up having fun yeah he's back and your father threw him a party and he is so angry he is so angry because he says what is the point of all of this I stay here I don't ask for nothing I work night and day I don't ever get appreciated for the work I do and you're just standing out there and the father comes to him and I want to focus in on verse 31 of Luke 15. this this they had a very spirited conversation now it happened in one verse here where the father comes out and he asked him you know why is it you've never thrown me a party you've never done anything for me and my friends you've never done anything special for me and as soon as the son that has devoured thy living just just threw it away as soon as he came home you throw him a party and the father says to him son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine now this is very sad this is extremely sad this very short verse thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine you see because this son this whole time was still living below his privileges as a son of the father in his the father's house because although he had put so much time and effort into laboring in the father's works he'd put very little time into actually getting to know the heart of the father and you may say well how do you know that is because the Son and the father here had a disconnect on who and on who everything belonged to you see and how do I know that is the father said everything that I have is thine but the son said you never gave me anything so that son had been working that whole time all those years and still to that very moment under the impression that nothing belonged to him and he had no rights with the father and the father this whole time he's probably since the younger son had left was under the impression and on the understanding all that I have is dying to doeth as you will now we'll come back to that in in Luke 10 we read about Martha in I don't want to focus in on it even on the same way that many people do and and many people they focus in on the part where Martha comes to Jesus and he said Lord why isn't Mary helping me and he says well Mary's doing that which is um that but one thing is needful and Mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her but I want to focus in on here's Martha if you go to the beginning of the first verse it says now it came to pass as they went that he entered a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house so Martha was the one who recognized Jesus when he entered into the village and said ah I am going to purpose of myself to go out and invite Jesus into my home Mary reap the benefit of Martha's insight it doesn't say Mary went to invite Jesus into her house it doesn't even say Lazarus when invited Jesus into the house which during that time and custom it would have been more customary for a man to invite another man into his home but Martha was discerning and she was watchful of those coming and going in the village and when she saw Jesus she made it a point to go out there and say Jesus come to my home I want you to come and stay in my home and now under a a feeling of great responsibility of inviting and had Jesus Come into her home Martha goes to work she's taking care of Jesus she's taking care of the disciples she's taking care of everyone else who was could possibly have tried to squeeze into her home from the rest of the village and she's working she is serving the master in the best way she knows how she said there's no way I'm going to let Jesus Come into my home and not be refreshed there's no way that I'm going to let Jesus Come into my home and not take care of his people there's no way that this is ever going to happen but what when they leave they're going to say Martha took the best care of anyone of Jesus you see many times I think when people focus on it they want to point out that maybe Martha chose the wrong thing but it wasn't because Martha just didn't want to be there Martha loved him so much and was so committed to her Duty as a hostess that she put herself to work she didn't sit down for a second she went out she invited him in and went right to work to make sure that his stay was as good as it could possibly be no hold on to those two things and I want to just take you into our own lives because many times it's even as we begin to look at them it's very hard to take scriptural stories of people in the Bible and see ourselves especially if we've spent a lot of time reading these stories we know the stories we've heard them told backwards and forwards we know the names we know the dates we know the events that happened around it and their stories and their good stories but they're hard to relate to at times but I can tell you this from my personal experience and maybe you all can too but many times in loving showing love to those around us we get caught up in The Daily Grind of loving them and what do I mean by that well if you're someone you're married or you're a mother or father and even young people you have responsibilities to other people that you love but you won't know you won't know it quite the same until you move on to those next stages of life but many times we have responsibilities to work it's cleaning up and doing things around the house it's taking care of the kids it's making sure that everyone's taken care of watching out for the family's health it's all the little things you can think of that you do it day in and day out and you do it without even thinking and and and you would never ever even think of not doing it and it takes hours and hours out of your day and out of your life and you'll be in the middle of doing it and perhaps your wife or your husband will tell you something like I miss you and you're like what do you mean you miss me I just saw you this morning you'll be driving down the road in the car and they'll say I miss you you're like what do you mean I'm sitting right here you're sitting right there how is it possible that you could miss me we're in each other's presence right now but that's not what they mean and I'm driving at something I'm driving at something is that when we get caught up in the busyness same thing they'll say do you love me you know like you'll say of course I love you it's like don't you see all the things I do for you don't you see all the things I do for the family it's because I love you and they say yeah but do you love me you see because we get so caught up in serving each other in in the works of life that we miss out on the relationship is that we get so caught up in the works of maintaining that relationship that we lose out on the connection and these are things that happen to all of us in all different walks of life whether it's with loved ones with friends with relatives but you get so caught up in doing the works and you say you see I do these works because I love you but their feeling of love is so empty because you haven't taken time to connect with them on a personal level and that's what we're seeing in these two stories this is what we're seeing this is has so many more moving Parts than if we just read it quickly and pass on this father and son the father is here he's saying son all that I have was is dying of course I love you I've always loved you I've loved you the most the whole time everything I've had since then has been yours and is yours now I don't own anything it's all yours son but the son never knew it the son never knew it he was so busy working for the father that he never even really knew the Father's Love and that was even the thing with Martha here Martha she loved the Lord and the Lord loved her but what he wanted to do is say Martha he didn't say Martha what you're doing is bad he never said that we need people who can work and do things and help the body and there's people working in the back tonight there was a musicians up here they were working the Deacon in the back who's watching and you know he's still in the building but he's watching off a monitor he's not in the sanctuary he doesn't get the same feeling with the worship those who have to go out and maybe every once in a while walk the parking lot and make sure everything's okay we need people who can do that these are not bad things we need people who can clean the church and are willing to put their shoulders of the wheel and come and help with the yard and and clear snow from time to time these are good things but many times just like in our personal relationships we get so caught up in working to prove our love we forget about the relationship because our works are taking up so much of our time The Works are not bad The Works are good we know if you go into the Book of James he says if you show me show me your faith by your show me your works he said your Works will show me your faith so there is an aspect to that but I think it's so easy in today's day and age to get caught up in the works because we're so disconnected from the relationship and you find in life is that the further you get disconnected in a relationship the more you'll pour yourself into the works to fill the void and you don't realize that if you just take a few moments to set down with that other individual with that person that you feel like you're struggling with because you love them but you feel like every time you get together there's just there's a clashing the gears don't mesh right you think well I'm doing all these things for them and can't they see that and they're thinking on the other side I'm doing all these things for them and can't they see that why don't they just want to spend time with me and you come together and because the relationship is out of sync then instead of meshing together it grinds how many of you have ever driven a manual transmission or been in a vehicle with a manual transmission yeah have you ever been in it with someone who's just learning how to drive it and they go to get started or they're shifting from the stoplight from first to second and all you hear is right there ain't nothing wrong with the vehicle there's nothing wrong with the transmission there's nothing wrong with the moving part the working moving parts of that vehicle the problem is with the relationship between the driver and the vehicle is that the driver does not have a close enough under working relationship with that vehicle to make those gears mesh appropriately and that's exactly what happens in life is that it's not that there's anything wrong with the the moving vehicle is it not that there was anything wrong with the work the workings but because the relationship is out of sync then even though it's all the right things in the right place the timing is off you see that and this happens between husbands and wives this happens between Fathers and Sons daughters and mothers parents in general in fact the busier you get and the more obligated you feel the more likely it is to happen because you feel like you're doing what you should be doing to just keep this thing moving if I stop if I take a second's breath if I it's all going to fall apart and can't each one of us is thinking can't they just see I'm doing the best I can and the reason why I'm doing the best I can is because I love them and then when we have these moments in life where it clashes we feel unloved now I'm driving at something I'm driving at something here is perhaps if we can recognize it on a personal level on relationships that we see every day then we can apply it to our relationship with our heavenly father if we can turn to Luke 21 verse 34-36 I believe it says take heed to yourselves lest at any time your heart be overcharged with surfacing and drunkenness and the cares of this life so that day so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man what I want to focus on this is on verse 34. and it says take heed to yourself less any times your hearts be overcharged and I'm going to skip the first two and just go to the cares by the cares of this life so that the day may come upon you unawares now when we read this the beginning and it it says surfing and many of us including myself wouldn't know what the term surfing means off the top of my head so I'm going to assume it's something horrible it's not really I looked it up briefly and it just says that it basically implies there's a lot of things taking up your time and drunkenness and drunkenness you could you can either take it as actual drunkenness by way of alcohol or maybe there's something else that is intoxicating in your life that is causing a distraction and distorting your judgment okay but I don't even want I don't need to focus on those I want to focus on the cares of this life you see because the cares of this life is not a sin we all have cares of life daily cares of life we set the alarm in the morning we get up we go into our job it's a care of life brushing your teeth is a care of life maintaining your health is a care of life everything every little thing think about it everything you have to care about to stay living is a care of life The Works in and around this church are cares of life the things that need to be done and someone needs to do them so that things stay working your daily works and your routines are cares of life now let me step out a little bit and take one more step all of your routines in life would be related to your cares of life you know many of us have very good routines and those routines could even be things like I have a routine of perhaps you say I have a routine of every morning I get up and the first thing I do is I open my bible and I make sure to read three to five verses every morning before I do anything else that's my routine now that is a very good thing to do but something to ask yourself is that still part of your relationship or has it become a part of your works you see because it's a very good thing to do it's a wonderful thing to do in fact brother Branham said if you want to get closer with the Lord you want more Revelation how do you do it read your Bible and pray every day so right away we know this is a good thing to do this is something we should do this is something we've been instructed to do but in the busyness of our life is this still something that we're doing because it's something that we do to help grow our relationship with Jesus Christ or to prove our love has become a work that we maintain it's the same as all the other things you might think you're doing for the Lord because as soon as you you change it from Lord I'm doing this because I want to get grow closer to you to in your brain it becomes Lord I'm doing this for you and not I'm doing this for you in a way that for both of us but I am doing this for you so you can see I'm doing something for you because that's when it becomes a work now you're working at it to prove to the father you're worthy of him and the minute becomes a work you lose the benefit because it was meant for a relationship just like time spent with a significant other or a spouse if you come together and every time you come together the next time something comes up you say well what was the point of us going on that date or what was the point of us spending that time together I did that for you thank you then you did it for the wrong reason you're doing a work to prove to the other person Your Love and now you're holding that over them as something you did for them and not something you did for you and not something you did for the relationship and many times we find ourselves in that same place with the Lord is the minute something starts going wrong or the minute perhaps we're that we're up for that promotion at work and you go and you start to pray you don't say Lord your will be done you say Lord I spend all this time in in devotions and I do all these works for the church and I do this and I play music and I sing specials to bless the people I deserve this you cheapen all those things from a relationship to works that you believe that you have a right to claim rewards off of it's so subtle and the devil does that on purpose he tries to speed us up that's where we're at in this day and age is the reason why it's so sped up and moving so fast is that the devil doesn't want to give us even a second to slow down and think about why am I doing this you see the this old Elder son the whole time he was working so hard he was putting in so much time in fact when he came in it was already dark that night he stayed out in the field all day managing the estate working for the father trying to win The Father's Love and approval not realizing it that he had it the whole time and many times that's where we we find ourselves is at the beginning of our relationship with the Lord we he comes and he saves us he justifies us we go through sanctification we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh we come out of that water and we feel like we're we're walking on clouds I can still remember it today I can remember the experience I felt like I was walking on clouds and nothing could go wrong for at least two weeks straight like I had a bounce in my step it was wonderful But as time goes on we forget that we forget what that relationship's supposed to feel like and I'm not saying every day your life is going to feel that way sometimes the Lord lets us go through things but sometimes we just get caught in the motions of coming to church of reading our Bible of we got to be in service by a certain time we got to have a certain level of devotion we got to make sure this is done in a certain way we got to make sure that the order is in in such a certain way and we got to make sure that each thing is done in special and and in its place and you know and those are all good things but are we slowly but surely finding ourself in the place of this elder son where we feel like we have to do the work because we know in our heart that the relationship is lacking so we'll go do the work because we're in a routine and if we're like okay I did that I did that part now okay I feel I went to church on Wednesday and I felt like I was an integral part of the service and I fell asleep with a few people and I shook a few hands and I said God bless you I did my work for the week and now I can breathe again and I'll make it till Sunday no we don't think this in our we don't actually think this out loud but that's a in our spirit that's what's going on is we're making it from day to day from work to work not realizing that we're missing out on a relationship the whole time and that's where Martha found herself too is Jesus didn't call her out in telling her that Mary had chosen the better part because he wanted to shame her he was saying Martha take a minute I appreciate all you do I appreciate you inviting me to your home but after you invited me in it'd be nice to spend some time with you I came here because you invited me I came to spend time with you and I haven't got a moment to spend with you since I got here you've been so busy trying to please me you haven't spent one moment with me you're so busy trying to do all the things you think will make me happy you think Will Curry my favor and and be worthy of my love when you don't have to do any of those things to Curry favor or be worthy of my love your word your I already you're already have my favor I already love you now I just want to spend some actual time with you you see because we could sit down and you could have that time where you sit down and read that certain number of verses but if you've locked it in as I needed to read so many chapters or I need to read so many verses to to have accomplished my devotion I say you're probably missing out at some point it's going to start out real nice but as you get focused in and locked in on the routine you're going to lose focus on the relationship because there will be times and maybe the relation in the relationship you'll read a whole chapter and God will use that chapter to speak to you and there'll be other times or he'll want you to stop on the first verse and go back and read it again and read it one more time and then just sit there and just bask in his presence as he just begins revealing it to your heart as you begin speaking to you through that verse but if you're so focused I got to read the whole chapter and speed reading you know it reminds me when I was growing up I was homeschooled and uh every morning before we started school we would have Bible you know and we'd all sit down around the table or in the living room and each of us would read a verse around whatever scriptures we were reading at the time from the youngest to the oldest I remember we were going through the book of Exodus at one point and my younger sister just younger than me at the time she was probably four or five years old so she could read a few small words here and there but she was not that good but almost every chapter in the book of Exodus starts what the Lord spoke unto Moses so the first verse was always hers to read and she wasn't reading it she had memorized how that chapter should start so it was always as the Lord spoke unto Moses and then he'd go on to the next person so she was so proud of that but I remember one time we were allowed to each one of us pick a scripture to read and I was I was doing fairly well at reading I was pretty proud of myself with the fact and in Sunday school at the time we would do speed drills and so being really fast was really important and also something I was very proud of at the time a lot of Pride going on there um and so I picked Psalms 119. and I read it in under five minutes out loud as fast as I could go you know what I don't think me or anyone else got anything out of that scripture reading and I say that and it's it's funny but sometimes that's how we are is that we feel like we have an obligation to a certain parameter or a certain amount of information we have to consume because that's the spirit of the age that's what's going on right now if you want to stay on top of things if you want to stay up with the current times it's the speed at which you can consume information and sometimes we consume information so fast there we don't even bother to stop and check whether the information we're consuming is even correct and then we go running off when we share it with someone else and we share it with someone else and someone else and it's not till we get to the third or fourth person that they're like that that that's not not a true story did you bother to double check it he's like no oh yeah that was completely made up you've been duped and that's what we do in our spiritual life sometimes is that we get such a hurry and we want we know I got need to read so many verses I need to listen to so much of a message I need to whatever it is whatever parameters you've put around your works did you jump in there and like I did when I read Psalms 119 because I know okay I got up late or I'm I'm and I need to leave for work really fast but I still need to do this before I go or you know I need to go to bed and I need to read it real quickly so I can fall asleep we jump in there and we try and read it as fast as we can or listen as quick as we can or or now we're not really listening but you're reading ahead on the message as fast as you can on your phone so you can finish the two so many paragraphs so when someone asks you yep that's what I did I read two chapters I listened to 20 minutes Worth or I read so many paragraphs every day wow brother that's really good thank you that's that's how we feel but then they say well but what is the Lord have been speak how's the Lord been speaking to you and you're like well I read such and such a chapter in such a such a verse that's not what they asked you though they said how has the Lord been speaking to you because if you do a work you'll memorize it because it's a part of the work or you'll commit it and you want to prove to someone that you did your work right like being in school you want to be able to prove you did your work so you can get the good grade and that's how we begin to treat it as a work where we're looking to submit it just so we can get the grade and it's not about that it's about an understanding it's about the relationship with Jesus Christ where he wants to pull us away from getting caught up in the spirit of this age where we're just running and rushing to get things done he would rather you if you have five minutes take that five minutes and say Lord speak to me from this verse here read the verse and say Lord speak to me and take that few minutes to just let him move on the scene quiet your spirit and let him do something for you because when he sent the disciples out in the book of Acts he didn't tell him go memorize as much as the scripture as you can as fast as you can he never did in fact most of them were ignorant and unlearned the scripture says they'd never even read the scripture personally themselves they couldn't open it up and read to you well here's the quote of the prophet they couldn't Jesus told them have a relationship with me so personally that when you're called before the Kings and magistrates and between before the high priest he said don't worry I will give you the things to say and you know what the result of that was it wasn't that the Jews and the Pharisees or the Kings and the people they came before said wow he really knows his Bible wow he really knows the the message of the Prophet Moses line for line man he's like a Pharisee I'm not using that as an insult in this case that would be it quite the honor because the Pharisees and Sadducees and the scholars of their day not only could they read it not only did they know it but they knew it so well and the Scrolls were rolled up in such a way they could take a pin push it through the scroll and tell you what verses and letters it hit as it passed through yet they're the ones who cried crucify and sent him to the cross scripture tells us this as he was on the cross they were in the temple quoting the Psalms of him being on the cross their Works were so intense and they thought they were proving their love to God through their works it's a religious spirit and it's never changed if you even follow it through and it's not even specific to Christianity a religious spirit will outwork anybody else any day of the week you can't beat it it's even it's going to be one that will bring all you to even acknowledge all your faults and then it'll give you a work to do to try and save yourself from those faults because you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ because if you did and you are doing all these works and you had the relationship as you were memorizing the scripture you'd realize he'd already paid the price but when you call get caught up in your works and this isn't just a religious thing for those who are denominations but we ourselves get caught up in this is that we get caught up in our works and then we do something and we think we can outwork our faults and we just pour ourselves into those works and you know if God will just see how how much I I love him because of what I'm doing and he's just down to the side said if you just sit down and talk to me for a minute we could talk this out and you'd realize that there was no problem at all but you're so focused on fixing it yourself you're so focused on working it out that you don't even know who I am you don't even know what the what the the work of Calvary was all about you're so busy doing your own works you have no idea what the works of the father were for you already you don't realize you don't need those Works to prove Your Love because he's already done the work he wants to create a relationship with you because as you create a relationship you and the father will become one as you and the father become one in mind and heart you'll become one indeed also and now he's not trying to chase you around did you do that did you do this you'll find this in in relationships too you'll find in a home where the mother and father have a relationship where they truly love each other you won't hear someone always chatting hey did you did you take out the trash who's the last person don't you know you're supposed to be doing that why don't you ever help me around the house no it won't you know why because they love each other and when two people love each other they grow in sync when they spend time on the relationship they grow in sync and we can see what the example of growing in sync because of a relationship of love will do one for the other not just from the scripture but a prophet of our age you say how do I know this is brother Branham with the limited amount of time that he had with his family showed us exactly how that would work on a home is that when the home was in chaos and everyone was upset and the whole place was all stirred up he walked in he didn't start correcting nobody he didn't start tossing out thus saith the Lord and you better do as you're told I'm a prophet of God none of that it says he went into the kitchen where there was a mess where there was a bunch of dirty dishes and he put on an apron and he started washing the dishes and singing to himself he didn't even try and go tell anyone how they should live better or tell the boys how they should stop fighting he didn't he didn't tell anyone any of those things but there was such a relationship in the home that he didn't do the works to prove his love but his love drove him to the works you see that is the relationship that as you build a relationship with Jesus Christ you don't have to worry if you really fall in love all the things that he said are a representation of his love you won't be able to help but do them if I say focus in on the relationship first so that you don't find yourself like this son like you don't find yourself like Mary all worked out and in a tizzy all worked out and tired and saying Lord why doesn't anybody help me can't they see all the work I'm doing he's saying yeah they can see it and I see it too but what I'd really like is if you just spend some time with me in Mark chapter 10 we're actually going to skip this is the story of the Rich Young Ruler and we all know it but I want to just jump straight to verse 24. it says and the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus answereth again and say it to them children how hard is it for them that trust enriches to enter into the kingdom of God now riches we would like to all immediately read that and disassociate ourselves like well I ain't got no riches so that doesn't apply to me but I thought I would apply a a term that maybe more of us would recognize and I would say that those that trust in the hustle of life right bring it bring it to more modern times those who Trust in the hustle of life it's hard for them to enter into the kingdom of God because they're so busy doing it themselves see that was the the problem with the Rich Young Ruler is that he had done all the works his whole life this guy was a good guy when Jesus said when he came to Jesus he said what do I do to attain eternal life Jesus said well keep the Commandments and then Jesus named up the Commandments and the Rich Young Ruler said all these have I kept from my youth this guy was not just this guy wasn't sneaky and and that's why he was financially well off this guy had kept all the Commandments this guy was at every church service he helped with every event he was there he was on top of it and he was successful in fact he paid his tithings from that success he great gave great offerings we know that because he was well liked he was known in the church there but Jesus picked out the one thing about it that was the problem is that he saw it as I did it all myself and I'm not asking for eternal life but I'm asking what can I do for eternal life because it if I do it I deserve eternal life he was looking for another work and anytime you work for something it means that you're getting paid so Jesus didn't hit him at his riches because he of it was money but it was because however he viewed it and Jesus realized if he had to give up everything that he felt he had earned just like he was trying to earn eternal life if he could turn his back on all of that then there was a hope and a chance for him to actually see that eternal life is not something you work for but a gift it's not something you can earn it's something given not because you deserve it but because of the grace of God and we get caught up in the same way we get caught up in the same way we think if we can hustle hard enough we deserve to win if we hustle hard enough we deserve God's blessings if we hustle hard enough if we if we prove ourselves if we work the hardest within the church if we work the hardest within the body if we testify to the most people if we sing the most songs if we play the most beautiful music if we convert the most people then we deserve eternal life and you're trying to do this by something that you can attain by what you've worked but you've never developed a relationship with the father here we are we're already 9 20. in the message the power of decision 1955. got two quotes here we develop routines we develop conditioning we develop things that we just become to see as familiar now the word familiar in my title what that means is is you become so accustomed to someone or something that you actually lose the respect to a certain extent for that person or their position or or or the location and I think many times in our relationships both with each other and with the Lord we become too familiar and we get so familiar that it doesn't mean anything anymore when something's familiar it loses its specialness and when it loses its specialness then it loses its importance to us and it's okay to have a certain amount of familiarity that allows you to interact with someone and not always be uncomfortable or uneasy but just like certain areas that say the like with the president of the United States of America it doesn't matter how familiar someone becomes with that man as long as he is the president of the United States of America you will always address him first as Mr President it's not just Bob or John or or whatever that Man's first name is but because of the office it commands a certain amount of respect that doesn't allow you to become overly familiar and we forget that God wants to know us to know him as a father and be willing to come to him in that way but he doesn't ever want it to come to a point that we lose that reverence in his presence where it's just something ah I'm just going to church again I'm just reading my Bible again but there should be a certain amount of reverence every single time and that's sometimes through our routines what we lose is we lose that reverence because we come become overly familiar that it just becomes just another book to us we say no it's it's it we believe something about it but how do you treat it where do you leave it how do you take care of it where do you place it when we come into this building when we come into the church you know there's nothing special about the building it's just a building made out of brick and mortar and made out of wood and drywall insulation metal same as any other building but it's about what the building represents about the reverence but many of us especially if we grew up in church we become very familiar and we lose that reverence for the fact that not that we're entering a church building but the reason why we come then to the church building we come into the church building to meet with God not that you can't meet God anywhere else but this location this space this room it's reason for being is for the people of God to meet with God and so when you come under that expectation it'll put you us under under a certain amount of reverence not for the building but for he whom you come to meet in the building you see because you could walk into a room and if it was empty it'd just be any room but if the head of if you're the head of the CEO of your company was sitting in the room you would act different in that room than you would if no one else was there you'd be you'd probably be very nervous you walk into the room and you weren't expecting them there and there he is and and uh you're gonna be walking around pacing or if you get to sit down and and at a desk or something and hide your hands you're you're like you know you don't know where to leave your hands you don't know where to look up look to the side look down you're why because there's there's something about the position of the men that develops a certain amount of respect and you want to know okay why is it why am I in this room with this individual as a single employee of this company you're not you're not the person right below him the where he has a reason to be talking to you even your direct manager if you get called in you don't know why you're first thinking well what did I do wrong what's going on what should I be preparing myself for what should I know you don't just unless you're someone who just doesn't care about your job you don't just wander in there and like throw yourself down in the chair and kick your feet up on their desk no because there's a certain amount of respect there's a certain amount of reverence not for the room not for the chair not for the desk but for the person in the room and what they represent and so it is when we come to church is it's not that we're putting any amount of reverence on the building or on the chairs or on the instrument or even on the minister or on the other people coming but if you're coming for the right reason a relationship with Jesus Christ where he said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I'll be also and you know that many times many times more than two or three have gathered in his name in this room in this building you'll come through those doors with a different attitude you'll come through and you'll say you're waiting you'll come and take your seat and you'll begin to just pray and read and enter into the worship and just say Lord I know you're here father let me approach you correctly in a way where you would be willing to come and speak directly to me and meet my need father I don't come asking or demanding anything from you but only that which you've already promised and I'm coming according to your word that you said you could not break you see it's all about the approach you're approaching him the right way you're not just walking in and sitting down all right Lord bless me I'm here can't you see the work I did I made it to church I had to work real hard I really wanted to sleep in it's a Sunday morning I didn't really I was tired I stayed up playing all night on Saturday didn't really feel like being here I had to really put in some effort to make it I deserve to be blessed now and yet that's how many of us come through the doors is we feel like in some way the effort of us making it to church makes us worthy of a certain amount of blessing but what he wants to see his children coming through those doors pouring out their praises unto him and letting those Praises come up before the altar and hymns being so pleased he says I can't I can't stay up here any longer I can hear my people worshiping I can hear them praising and I can't stay here away from them they're not asking me for anything all they've done is thank me all morning and I am so happy I'm gonna go down there and just walk amongst them that only that's all he has to do for all our issues and problems to be solved you know is One Moment In His presence he doesn't even have to say anything just let his presence come by and all those problems and issues wafed away but he'll do that and much more if you approach the throne correctly if you come realizing you're a son and everything that you've seen all these promises have been yours the whole time and the father's just been waiting just waiting for the sun to get into the right condition to come and ask the right way that's all the father was waiting for in the story we read the father wasn't withholding from the son the son didn't come and ask and father would it be okay if I had a little party with my friends and the father saying I don't know maybe we work another five years I'll think about it the sun just never came and asked he he was trying to work hard enough to be worthy of a party someday because he felt it belonged all to the father and the father said well it's all the sons so he can do with it as he wishes when he wishes so he must not wish and yet that's where we all stand tonight come before the father say Lord I'm just coming upon your promises I'm coming upon your word I'm not trying to work it up I'm not trying to prove anything I'm just coming because I read in your word that you promised you'd be with me you promised you'd care for me you'd promise you'd you'd watch over me you promised me good health you promised me all these things I don't I don't need to deserve them you've promised them and you said I've already paid the price for all of them but we're so busy trying to work it up we've never even read the promises we've never gone back to the will to see what the father put in there for us we're trying to work ourselves to win an inheritance that always already belongs to us we have to break our routines break out of our shell and go beyond it the power of decision you know what's the matter with the church today don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves my if you'll just get out of yourself long enough you say well you know our churches we have a regular routine who cares about your routine I wish you'd get out of the routine long enough to get saved anyhow amen get saved get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit then you can see things done an old Prophet one time got all stirred up because somebody come to him it wasn't right for him to come he kind of got his righteous indignation up and you know what he did before the Spirit come on him he had to go sing some good spiritual songs then he got in the spirit and began to see things he saw some visions I tell you brother life will look a lot different when the church gets in the spirit that's right and gets out of itself and the routine that you're in amen lay aside those weights those weights you gotta find out the ladies Aid Society got their dinner next week and what you got to do lay aside those things lay aside those works give time to old-fashioned heartfelt pouring out of the to the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy Ghost pours down upon your soul you'll get beside yourself maybe you can get with Jesus if you get away from yourself once amen musicians if you want to come you can't be with yourself and Jesus Now isn't that something you can't be with yourself and Jesus because as long as you're focusing on yourself there ain't nothing he can do for you you find out you're the biggest enemy you got if I can get William random out of the way Jesus can have a wonderful time but you got to get him out of the way so then you start see they started on the light-footed feeling wonderful why they were following the pillar of fire god going before them they were following the pillar of fire god going before them when he cut away through the Red Seas and she walled up then they got on the other side and got back to Earth again their feet on the ground they looked around after the spirit went off of them they seen what had happened they got excited they got so excited until Moses raised up his hands and began to sing in the spirit and Miriam his sister the prophetess that was the celebrity of the crowd amen she got so excited she grabbed the tambourine and began to beat the tambourine and dance and the daughters of Israel followed her up and down the banks beating the tambourine and dancing Hallelujah if that ain't an old-fashioned Pentecostal camp meeting I never seen one in my life brother if this is the latter rain that must have been the former Reign hallelujah what is it the same Holy Ghost the pillar of fire the same Redeemer walking in the light moving on what a Time Saints [Music] if we can just break out of our routine of serving God and re-establish our relationship with him Everything Will Change Everything Will Change not just the relationship you have with him but the relationship the relationships where you feel you're struggling with others those problems will just melt away I didn't say you won't have no problems but it'll be different because the comforter will be dwelling inside [Music] when that relationship with Jesus Christ when you begin to gain that back and you realize that I'm not just reading this Bible because I have to it's a it's a requirement of a Christian it's a requirement and I want to prove to people that I want a greater Revelation I I want more of God so I'm going to prove that by doing this but it becomes something that you can't wait for even if it's that first few verses even if it's that one verse it's just that moment that you're listening to a message and brother random maybe says one word that touches your life and you just let that message keep playing but all of a sudden something comes wasting over you the message goes on brother bradham's voice drones on and God begins to speak to your heart it's no longer about the message you're listening to it's no longer about trying to do enough but all of a sudden [Music] God wolf stepped down on the scene like he did for job and he'll call you up higher [Music] you won't be worried about how much you memorized or how much you can prove or how spiritual you look because in that moment it'll all be Jesus in that moment whether you're in your car you're at work wherever you're at wherever you're at because it's a relationship and not a word you see the difference between relationship and work is that when it's a work if you feel you're being forced to do it outside of the routine time for that to happen you're going to be uncomfortable you're going to feel uneasy and you're going to be upset about it because that's what happens anytime something that is a work foreign gets forced into your life during a time that when you feel you don't have time to do it I'm already busy I give enough time to that as it is I don't have more time to give it happens to all of us someone will ask you to do something that hey hey can you do this one thing for me and you'd be like I'll do that a little bit later I ain't got time for that right now can't you see I'm busy [Music] but if you have a relationship of love and be like yeah no problem I can do that [Music] I'll take care of that for you and that's a natural type but the same thing with our spiritual life when you have a relationship with Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what you're doing you'll be studying for the biggest test you've ever taken in your life foreign you could be under so much pressure from work and there's a problem you got to figure out and your job is on the line and all of a sudden you'll feel that presence come by and the level of importance of that test the level of importance of that problem will just melt right away you'll say Lord I am so thankful you're here right now what is it that you wanted to share with me I am so humbled to be in your presence [Music] because you know that he cares so much about you that he won't let you fail [Music] that test you were studying for he'll see you through it that job you're in if you're meant to keep it you'll be fine but he's wanting to see Abraham Abraham take your only son sacrifice him back to me God wasn't looking for Abraham's works he was looking for his relationship it wasn't about what Abraham did but why he did it he said Lord I love you so much even if you want this thing I prize the most not only will I give it to you but I'll go on a three-day journey to do it I'll take more of myself and put that into [Music] because God was trying to get Abraham's attention and say Abraham Abraham do you even understand the relationship we have and my depth of love for you because in all these situations of job of the this young man here with his father of Abraham with Isaac it was all the father's purpose to get the son to recognize the love of the father [Music] see the father in all these situations the father already knew how much he loved the son but he wanted the son to realize how much [Music] he loved him back that he would come to a realization this isn't just something I do for works but I love you so much there isn't anything I wouldn't do let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you once again this evening father Lord and Lord I hope that just this simple thought was a benefit to somebody father Lord that they can see the lord it's not about how many Works they can do or how they can prove their love father how busy they can be but it's about a relationship with Jesus Christ it's about getting one-on-one with the father and realizing all the things that we've been trying to garnish favor for they've been ours all along this time if we would just realize the Father's Love For Us if we just realize his promises and his will that we can start laying start laying claim to them one at a time and the father would just be so pleased foreign pour them out upon us with all we ask that you just come and have your way go with your people father bless them for Lord coming and Lord putting in their time and effort despite the weather father despite what the outside would look like Father those who are unable to be here whether they're at work or whether they had other obligations father the family or sickness whatever it might be or to ask you just go to each of them wherever they are Lord your presence would go with them now and throughout the week Lord may they just go rejoicing father realizing that they don't need to hurry the father's favor they've had it all along oh we're just so thankful for your goodness and your mercy in our lives we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy oh this put all these things before you in the most wonderful and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray man he just put this song up they'd say that wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord [Music] [Music] no Teach Me Lord [Music] a doubt on my knees [Music] teach me not are to realize [Music] for an answer from you they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings [Music] they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not Faith teach me Lord teach me Lord they that wait upon the Lord [Music] they that weighed upon the Lord child shall renew their strength let's stand on our feet

thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Father blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Lord you are wanted to be praised thank you Father thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen what a design of God what a message for the Wednesday night Amen on a cool weather praise the Lord uh what a move of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord I mean it was just so beautiful tonight beautiful don't tell that I can I can come right behind brother Jordan tonight and says that that was wonderful tonight amen we thank the Lord you know uh just sitting there and and you know being preached or and just seeing how the Lord was bringing for the word you know every serve is just so special amen every self is so special you know last last Wednesday brother Dan was preaching on three minutes to midnight and it was almost about uh uh it was almost about 8 53 55. before he started getting into his message so I'm thinking in my mind is he trying to preach on it for three minutes I'm watching what this brother is doing is he actually going to preach for three minutes he kept going from one thing to another I've not got to my message yet I'm looking at the time it's almost three minutes I said I see I will see how he will pull this one out tonight praise the Lord but we thank the Lord and uh but let me say this let me say this before we pray because I just think that after listening to the message tonight I mean it just called for I was going into our our individual closet the Holy Spirit that's that's what the message is you know it just for us to go into our individual let's turn around the message which of course that's what God is doing we are the bride and the thing about that is the other it's all about a relationship it's not about church membership that's what the message is all about this message is all about relationship this message is is supposed to affect every form of our relationship because the marriage relationship is the highest form of relationship is the highest form of relationship in life praise the Lord that's the reason why the talking is the highlight of the message like brother Branham said If the message is not affecting your relationship then that's where your problem is praise the Lord It's All About relationship it's all about relationship and you know when you when you break into that cycle of relationship church is not a burden you enjoy it it's almost like you enjoy to go home you must enjoy to go home you must not start to go oh my goodness man my wife and you know you would really have a problem you just enjoy being out and spending time home then you have a serious problem praise the Lord oh I'm telling you we're going to cook this one amen we're going to cook this one we take the message to be about a privilege we are in a message so we have this privilege we are the bride like an entitlement there are people they don't do nothing they are the foolish virgin their denomination and here we don't have no relationship with the father the older son he was just as practical as the one that was going away because the word prodigal means wistful when you are Wishful you are a prodigal when you don't know how to manage your time because he gave us 24 hours [Music] so I was seeing the prodigal at home and a brother got away that is the beauty of this message brother Branham says this message had taught us how to marry our wives how to raise our children foreign that's the beauty of the message it's relationship it must be able to affect our relationship in every way every way [Music] foreign we all can take their home and see how much are we in the chamber how much are we allowing the Holy Spirit to have his will we try to trying to make it by our hustle we are trying to make it we are trying to do it if you just think about it it's just always baffled my mind and that thought has blessed me all the time you know before everything that Joseph went through he became a prime minister begin the next to pharaoh Daniel there in captivity he was brought to the place of greatness [Music] and it was all because they fall in the relationship Daniel purpose in his heart that he will not Define himself saying sometimes it's the simple things as much as just just those things that just move the heart of the father [Music] foreign [Music] have won the lover let thy presence cover Ed it's all I long for into the chamber be free Holy Spirit lost between Me Gently as I close the blue Heavenly lover let thy breasts has covered on any is all I [Music] know [Music] my being and ever too about I always [Music] I need you more and more yes Lord my heart is open please come inside [Music] I don't open on the windows and I drew white every won't you come inside the alone I need you more and more what a musician Softly playing let's buy our house together he said all I have is dying [Music] I love you from the beginning he still love you foreign why can't we just serve God on the basis of love save the father live your life of appreciation not a life to please him a life of appreciation of all that he have done [Music] foreign [Music] problem there is that we don't trust him and when the element of trust is destroyed in relationship foreign for the downward slope you trust the Lord enough tonight can we trust the Lord enough tonight he had a thousand cattles on a hill he know what our need is the Lord know your financial status he knows your financial status he knows your debt he knows your credit is called he knows he knows everything [Music] the verse we're having a conversation the bird says maybe those humans they don't have the god that we have maybe they don't have the God maybe our God from their God you see them in the hustle and a puzzle [Music] even our our devotion with the Lord is in such a hurry foreign we can't even get on our bed like David said he David said I pulled my pillows to me and I saw taking on your goodness I wet my pillow with tears [Music] I was going to preach a message this Sunday on Mary how she Ponder and they just called uh just in line with their how she Ponder on all of those things that the shepherd said let Ponder on the things that were said tonight are we having the relationship with God are we have we entered into a relationship with him you have a relationship you are excited to see the person you can't wait that's why brother Branham said we can't wait for those doors to be open when a relationship goes sour that's when we linger that's when we dread that's when it's become a burden Heavenly Father your word being preached tonight Lord father my hands are upload my hearts are before you just thinking about the top law father they are very daring in prayer I was lying on the bed just thinking on this very taught to God [Music] communion with you father that's what you have brought that's what the opening of the seals is all about it's not just about hair knowledge and and mistrace it's about a relationship foreign you have opened your chamber you have opened your secret and you want us to come in and just appreciate the things that you have taught about us the promises you have made concerning us the price that you pay father we live our hands to you tonight we live our hearts to you father God and say oh Lord bring us into a relationship with God [Music] we thank you tonight we thank you Father thank you for your word thank you for speaking to us Lord in a way that our soul go understand Lord Jesus thank you Father
