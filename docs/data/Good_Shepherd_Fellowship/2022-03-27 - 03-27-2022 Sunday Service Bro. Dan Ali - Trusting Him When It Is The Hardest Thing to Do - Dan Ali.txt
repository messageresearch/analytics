welcome to the house of god thank you brother johnny it's such a privilege to know that you are numbered among the laws despite you and um it's heartwarming when we come to the house of god you know we see one another it's a reminder that we are all fighting the same battle and that we have a common enemy i don't care what your brother ever does to you what your sister ever does to you that is not your enemy you should be able to resolve it there is nothing that can never be resolved praise be to god one thing we should always look out for to make sure that there isn't any disunity in our midst because brother brother says something that why there is this unity the spirit of god is not welcomed always search your heart make sure you are right with god and when we all come and we are under the same anointing under the same spirit there is no doubt that god is going to come down praise be to god god bless you all once again and happy to see you as brother once said last sunday he's traveled he's in washington dc i spoke to him yesterday he took the service on thursday he's preaching there today and i just saw a note of course he told me yesterday he'll be flying in tonight with the children and also also brother brother joseph he's going to iowa with cisco zane they are also coming in tonight so um or remember them in prayers keep them in your prayers shall we just say a word of prayer our most gracious and eternal father we thank this sincerely for this moment we've had to once again gather together that we don't come to church looking across our shoulders to see who is coming after us that we have freedom of worship that we can worship our god anyhow anyway and we are not afraid we are so very much grateful that we have it here it is not so in other places we just thank you so much for getting us together this morning both far and near father oh god that we may hear from you we are not here father oh god to see a man neither are we here to hear the voice of a man we have come that we may hear from god and father we pray may you come down in a very special way you alone know the desires that are on the house of your children you alone know what the needs are father we pray this morning in the name of jesus that you would come and minister unto your children from life to ear to the glory of your holy name if there are any sense if there are any iniquities if there are anything five there is anything in our lives that would hinder our prayers father we pray and we commit them under the blood and we pray that you will just glorify yourself in our midst today we are so grateful we commit your seven brother one and the children into your hands in washington dc father we pray that you will grant him wisdom and healthy father to be of help to the saints day and we pray that father tonight you will bring them safely back home to the glory of your holy name we also commit brother joseph and his cousin into your hands that father you will shepherd them safely in tonight to the glory of your holy name father as many of us that have gathered tonight may you come and breathe over your word into our souls and let your word take on flesh in us father and as many as are following online father we pray committing them into your hands that you will remember them also father oh god and be gracious unto them this amount further we ask in the name of jesus as we turn the service over into your hands in jesus name father we pray with thanksgiving amen [Music] as we stand can we just take our bibles musicians god bless you we are reading uh some 62. psalm 62 verse 1-8 truly my soul waited upon god from him cometh my salvation he alone no he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall he be and as a torturing friends only consult to cast him down from his excellency their delight in lies they're blessed with their mouth but they cast inwardly seller my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my defense and i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god verse 8 trust in him all times you people pour out your hearts before him god is a refuge for us seller praise be to god i take verse 8 again trust in him at all times ye people pour out your hearts before him god is a refuge for us seller praise be to god shall we be seated once again i welcome you to the house of god the bible says where two or three are gathered in his name there he is and he is a promise keeper whatever god has said he will do that is what he will do praise be to god he is not a man that he should lie we say one thing and we do the other it is not same with god i believe we have all come to hear from god this morning if you have come to hear from god you would hear from god praise be to god covenant that angel of the covenant that was following brother branham when god took his servant away that angel of the covenant never went with him he is here when you come with your heart open to hear from god you will hear from god and if you also come to hear from a man you will hear from a man and the question is what good will he do you to get up dress up drive all that way to come and hear from a six foot three mess that is standing before you this morning i'm sorry to tell you you are disappointed in advance praise be to god but if you are here to hear from god you will certainly hear from god it is the reason why a lot of the times people get offended in the house of god because they come not with the intention of hearing from god but they come to hear from a man so even when god is speaking to you all you hear is the voice of a man and the question you ask who is he to talk to me that way but if you come to hear from god even when a man is talking to you you will hear nothing but the voice of god praise be to god the word the god we are worshiping is a living god the scripture we have read one time i was just listening to a music it just came in a wave that around that time any music that came to me just came with a message and i took this down and i titled this i titled this message trust in him when is that it is the hardest thing to do trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do praise be to god it is sunday morning you are in the house of god there are no strangers in our gates just relax and enjoy the world praise be to god i don't know how far we are going to go i don't know whichever way we are going to go it all depends on god brother brother says something that when you are going to the house of god and you tell god that i have just 50 minutes for you guess what all you have is 50 minutes even though after 15 minutes you will be seated in your pure in your chair your timing with god is over it's over if you tell god it's 30 minutes i have for you after 30 minutes even though you'll be here your time with god is over because god works with what you give him don't give god conditions do not give god time praise be to god after all when we come to the house of god how long do we stay here the longest maybe two two and a half hours three hours just relax and enjoy the world praise be to god trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do praise be to god the days are getting to a head when you read your scriptures and you look around you can tell you don't need anybody to remind you you can tell that the deaths are getting to ahead the bible says that in the end time we shall hear of wars and rumors of wars we hear that every day we hear of earthquakes online in sea by the name of tsunami every single time people are high-mandated the love of many is waxing cold people are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god everything the bible talks of you can see it happening the devil is working 24 7 24 7 the devil is not resting because he knows that his time is closing in on him we are at the end time it is not time to play church any longer it is time to mean business with god because why the days are getting to earth and as the days are getting to a head and the devil is doing over time the devil wants you to to work below your time and you know what the economies of all the world are failing it doesn't matter what they do it will never get better but god is going to take care of his children anyhow but the economies of the world would never change it will get worse and worse and worse and the devil would make you think that by working overtime working two three jobs is going to get better and you do it over and over and it gets worse and worse and worse the devil is trying to steal your attention to get you to relax and to think you have a lot more time on your hands than you actually do and then he would exploit it your own disadvantage praise be to god and because of that people are getting cold and formal we are getting cold and formal and so complacent and we don't pay heed to whatever it is that is going on and the most vulnerable things in life we don't even pay heed to them and i want us to take hit tonight this this morning that the most vulnerable things in life are the things that come at no cost at no cost because if there is a cost attached to it you can't afford it it comes at no cost now let's just take food everybody eats everybody eats it doesn't matter what quantity you eat either plenty or small you eat except you don't have stomach if you have stomach you will get hungry you will eat if you hear somebody say oh what is it what is food i've heard that a thousand times already what is food what is food that that fellow has over eaten that morning amen if you can lock them in the room just lock them and give them 48 hours come back and ask them whether they have the same opinion they will change their mind now look at food we buy food any food you eat you pay for it if you are not paying for it somebody else is paying for it and do you know that you can go for 21 days without food was it indira gandhi i believe he was that went for 21 days without food i am not talking of somebody who is fasting that is a spiritual exercise that comes with its own you know in its own environment i'm not talking about somebody that is on a spiritual mission i am talking of the colonel man that somebody survived 21 days without food take water the water that runs through your meter you pay for every gallon of it if you go to buy water from this from the store every bottle you pay for it but a man can go for three days without water again i'm not talking about somebody who is fasting and waiting on the lord no now there is a story about an australian man who survived for 17 days without water and he made it to the guinness book of records not because he liked it but he was arrested by two police officers and trump being in the cell and they forgot of him and he was there for 17 days before they remembered oh we arrested somebody and he's in the cells and they went low and behold he was still breathing so somebody made it for 17 days we pay for water we pay for food but you can survive days and weeks without them let's come to the air we breathe how many people pay for the air you breathe breathe all you can how many people pay for air but yet without air i give you three minutes because science says that anything after three minutes brain damage begins to set in anything after three minutes the most vulnerable things in life come at no cost and we breathe and we don't even we don't even know you know god is so wonderful god does not take advantage of his children can you imagine how important air is to man if god had put a meter on our noses to calibrate how much oxygen you take and then at the end of the month the angel of god comes going round taking the bills if you had to pay 90 of your salary to stay alive you will pay it before you spend on any other thing but god does not take advantage of his children i don't know about you but when i look in the mirror there is something in front of me that tells me i'll be in trouble praise be to god i can just go through the aisle and i can look at your faces and tell how many of us will be in trouble praise be to god and then the angel comes and tells you you are owing too much on your oxygen bill you know what i i am i am cutting off your supply next week are you going to sleep and then you run to the bank like we have it in america here you're going to sit in the air conditioning room you are sweating and that you know how the tellers are is becky here praise god i say can i give you some water you are thirsty but no you don't want the water can i give you some coffee no um you do want some soda no and then they come back can tell we are sorry your credit score is so bad we can't help you where do you stand now i am bringing us to a point look at how important oxygen is to a man the bible says man shall not live by bread alone amen but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god look at the word of god to the soul of a man salvation is of the lord he alone paid the price it cost him his life on the cross that freely have we received if a man had to pay for his salvation how many people will be able to do it if we should put all the resources of the world together all the gold and the diamonds and the box side all the billions and the three lost in the millions together could we pay for one soul no we couldn't but the word of god comes to us freely freely we don't have to pay for it and because of that we disregard it you know it is just the nature of man that anything you are not spending money on you disregard it but if you had to save five years 10 years 15 years 20 years to buy something you are going to hide it somewhere and once in a while you go and look at it and you cherish it and you are so proud about it and you are telling people about it and you are boasting about it but when it comes to the word of god which we have freely received we disregard it because it didn't cost us a cent because it didn't cost us anything and just look at it all that we struggle for going to work working overtime working two three jobs to get food to get close to get shelter what is it for is for this man here brother brother said once upon a time he walked through the museum and he saw that there was an analysis that was made of a man weighing 150 pounds and that analysis came with the conclusion that a man weighing 150 pounds is equals 84 cents 84 cents not 84 dollars not 84 000 not 84 million 84 cents you say oh i look in the mirror and i'm so beautiful 84 cents i look in the mirror i am so handsome 84 cents that i am wearing a hat hundred dollars i'm wearing shoes three hundred dollars i'm wearing a coat five hundred dollars you know what i'd raise ten thousand dollars to come to church today that is good 84 cents i am not saying that when you get up and you are coming to church just dress anyhow and come that's not what i'm saying i am saying look come with your best your best attitude your best clothes because you are coming to the house of god come and show your appreciation to god but it's all what 84 cents but do you know something in this 84 cent body there is a soul in man that was 10 000 of this world there is a soul in men that worth 10 000 of this world and all we spend our time on is 84 cents 84 cents i want the best car for 84 cents i want to live in the best house to make 84 cents happy i want the best clothes so 84 cents can be happy [Applause] i want the biggest bank account so 84 cents can be happy and then we neglect the weightier matters of life which is your soul which is your soul which man or woman for that matter in your right senses would spend more time taking care of 84 cents than the 10 000 wells that is in his heart in his soul but that is what we do a lot of the times that is what we do a lot of the times once upon a time i told a story here about that young man in his mid-20s thou got his phd he had everything going well for him and then he was diagnosed with a terminal illness and he was going to die and his ass called his father to get him all his books his father gathered all the books he bought for him and brought them and he said daddy you did very well for me you bought all the books i needed i am very successful i am very rich i have the best job but where is the bible where is the bible if god blesses you enjoy it but do not forget do not forget you may think that the air you breathe is even more important it doesn't mean anything the word of god means a lot more to your soul than oxygen means to your lungs you say oh brother if i don't if i don't breathe for four minutes i'm dead but i have not read the word of god for one week i have stayed without the word of god for 10 years and i'm still alive god have mercy on you [Music] amen if you were suffocated god forbid if you were suffocated the worst that would happen you are just going to exit this life you will never enter here if you are a child of god amen but if you died without the word of god in your soul that is a dangerous condition for anybody to be in the word of god means a lot more to your soul than oxygen means to your lungs praise be to god do not lose sight of who you are the pressure there is in life is making us to lose sight of who we really are and we begin to think and do things like the world praise be to god jesus and his disciples they believed in jesus they trusted in him they had confidence in him they knew who he was it wasn't a second thought they were not in doubt because one time jesus gathered his disciples together and he asked them who do men say i am and they said oh they say you are elias you are one of the prophets you are this you are that you are that and when they were done he asked them but who do you say i am and the bible says the place was quiet and someone by jonah said you are christ the son of the living god and jesus told him that flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i shall build my church and the gates of hell would not prevail against it so they knew who he was that he was the son of god the messiah brought on two feet and they saw it praise be to god they saw how he turned water into wine they saw how he opened the blind eyes they saw how he made the cripples walk they saw how he cleansed the lapis once once upon a time he was in the boat with his disciples he said let us go on the other side of the sea and while they were on the sea he was behind the boat sleeping on the pillow and the winds just came from left right and the waves just came trying to sing the boot and the fishermen inside just did all they could and the harder they tried the worse it was then they remembered that jesus was behind there and they cried out unto him master carries thou not that we perish and then he rose up and he rebuked the wind and he spoke to the sea and it just calmed they just stand and look at one another in the face what manner of man is this that speaks and even the winds obey him they knew who he was praise be to god he raised the dead from from from the dead he raised them back to life when lazarus was sick and he was sinful the bible says he turned there for a while and on the fourth day after lazarus were dead and buried he told his disciples to go let us go and wake lazarus up amen now science proves it when a man dies after 72 hours corruption sets in and here he comes and when mata had that the lord was coming she went and met him was crying master oh our only brother is dead he's dead i know if you were here he wouldn't have died but all the same whatever you ask of the father he is going to do it and jesus told him your brother would live again and mother said yes i know he would live in the resurrection in the last day and jesus said i am the resurrection of the life if any man believeth in me though he were dead yes shall he live and if any man believes in me and is her life he shall never see death praise be to god and when they were going marry hears oh jesus is coming she ran and met him oh if you were here my brother would not have died oh and they say you know what come on let's go to the grave they went and people were wondering what is this man going to do couldn't this man have stopped this man from dying now this man is dead he is buried what is he coming here to do then he commanded them took off the stone and they said oh for this today he is thinking jesus said did i not tell you that if you can only believe you see the glory of god [Music] take the stone away and the lord is thrown away and he calls us from the grave say what is this praise be to god they knew who he was there was no question about who he was they trusted him they believed in him they had confidence in him their hopes were in him praise be to god now look at what is going to happen that he was betrayed remember we are talking about but trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do he was betrayed and he was arrested now the disciples knew him that once upon a time that people took stones to stun him and the bible says he just went through their midst and they couldn't even see him so when they came to arrest him they knew something was going to happen and nothing happened they arrested him he was taken to palace judgement hall we all know the story i wouldn't want to go into them he was tried and sentenced to death the disciples were waiting to see because they knew him and they knew something was going to happen and nothing happened he was meant to carry his cross they were hitting him left right center spitting on him making fun of him they knew something was going to happen as they followed is he going to call fire from heaven is the ground going to open and swallow them up is he going to call legends of angels to come and destroy these people they knew something was going to happen as they followed from distance and nothing happened they whipped him and broke his back they knew something was going to happen and nothing happened they got him there put him on the cross and they nailed him to the cross they knew something was going to happen and nothing happened praise be to god brother brown said that it was not the roman spear or the nails that were driven in his hands and feet that killed him that it was broken hearts and you wonder is that how strong is that how strong broken heart can be is that how strong it can be let's just take a lesser form of it just imagine you've been the us for let's say 20 years and all along you've been communicating with people back home and now you tell them you are coming on a visit and they are there expecting you and then you get ready you buy your a ticket you do your shopping and then you take your plane you buy your a ticket you fly at the airport you are expecting not to meet you there you get it there is nobody you see people standing with you with names with names written on a piece of paper and they are standing there and they are coming with cars and taking their families away you get there you are expecting that treatment nobody and then you remember you have the address to the house you take a taxi you got to the house and there they are sitting and then you stand at the gate and you shout it's me it's me it's me done and they're they're looking at you weird look and then they get up and they enter their rooms and you look i mean you just wish the ground opened and then you just buried yourself you will get so disappointed is just a strong dark energy now the man they had believed in all their life to be the messiah the money had been lived in all their life to be the son of god there was no doubt about it there was no question about it the man they had believed to be the one that was to redeem israel here he hangs on the cross where does that leave your faith why do you stand why does that leave your faith you say you believe why does that leave your faith look at the two people on their way to emails they were so heartbroken their house was shattered they felt so hopeless it was like the ground they were standing on had caved in on them while they walked and they commute one with another they were sad would use to believe trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do in this day and age the same thing is happening that a man we have all believed him to be the prophet of god sent to us in this day and age with nothing but the word of god the man who denied himself of everything just for the sake of the love of god that his own family did not even get enough of him because of the love he has for the word of god and for the people of god that today not just people outside the message that even people in the message have not only turned against him but they are saying a lot of negative things about him posting a lot of negative things about him on social media calling him names dragging his reputation to the mud lamp pulling him lambasting him saying things they don't have any idea about they have hung his reputation on the cross this is the man you have believed in all your life to be the prophet of this age say to you would you still believe and trust in him remember the message is not brotherhood brahma's message the message is the message of the lord jesus christ to turn the message down is to turn christ down would you still believe in him and sister called me probably three days ago it's one thing when you hear about people saying things you don't even know them you don't even read about those things is one thing when you hear about them it's another thing when you know the people it's another thing because your sister was telling me brother these are people i know message believers not only were they message believers but they were people that preached the word people that encouraged me and they are leaving the message i know them brothers and sisters and they are leaving the message would you also go once upon a time jesus asked his disciples he told them if you don't drink of my blood and eat of my flesh you have no part in me and the bible says they got offended and they just started leaving one by one praise the lord and he had the twelfth would he also go and decide to who shall we go because you and lord have the words of eternal life praise the lord to whom shall we go now people you know that stood for the truth and they preached the message to you and i encourage you and they are living would you also go would you also go this is where you ought to know where you are standing this is why you ought to know where you are standing if you are not standing shield if you are not standing on the word of god and your faith is rather hooked on other people's faith why does that leave you have a relationship with god make sure that your faith is deeply uncut in the world because the word is our defense the word is our rock the word is our healer the word is our salvation the word is our peace the word is our joy is the word that is keeping us we are not keeping the word is the word that is keeping you have a relationship with the world in the beginning was the way the word was with god and the word was god have a relationship with god and this is where your faith is going to be tested to the call would he also go i don't know about you but as joshua said as for me and my family we shall save the lord if god is god let's worship him and he has proved beyond doubt that he is god praise be to god i don't care what anybody says i don't care what anybody says i have told you how i came to this message that i was looking for a message and i didn't know what i was looking for i was born a catholic i became a muslim i became a protestant i started going to church of pentecost i have roamed a lot i became i became an african traditionalist all that i have been true praise be to god and i was looking for something i didn't know what i was looking for but i knew it that day oh praise be to god when i heard the message i knew this was it praise be to god and how can i on earth ever turn my back on something that i have acknowledged to be the truth praise be to god if the message is in error i am an arrow the message came to a people and i am one of them praise be to god and i know by the grace of god that the message has come to make me a better person [Music] [Applause] yes in all my life things i couldn't do by the grace of god i am doing it now [Music] and how can i ever turn my back on the message because people are saying all things against the prophet god forbid i know that once i was blind but i can see them by the grace of god i know that i was deaf but i can hear the voice of god i know that i was living in sin as sin of a praise be to god i am served by grace i know that i was a slave to sin but the chains are falling praise be to god there is a song that says i hear the chain falling i hate when the chains were falling praise be to god that i am free i am free the devil cannot impute sin on me i am free i am a finished way praise be to god i don't care what happens i am a finished wife our praise be to god don't let anybody deceive you we have not believed canningly devised fables we have believed us here the lord it is the word of truth praise be to god amen where do you stand where do you stand trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do praise be to god look at job would you trust him in your darkest hour amen we are not talking of when things are rosy we are not talking of when things are going in your favor we are not talking of when you have everything at your back and call we are not talking of when life is so nice when you are having the promotion when there is money why there is no hardship that is not what we are talking about but would you still trust him in your darkest hour that was why satan got it wrong when satan went to god he told god it's because you have blessed him that is why he's serving you take all those things and see if you not kiss you if god blesses you enjoy it do not let your faith be in those things let your faith be in god [Music] enjoy it don't let your trust be in those things because they will perish in it let your trust be in god and we know the story how satan went in one day destroyed everything job had his beautiful family beautiful family sons and daughters he had his servants he had his cuddle he had a sheep mention it the man didn't kiss god he didn't kiss god it's that god has given me and he has taken praise be to his holy name and that wasn't enough satan went he said you know what a man can give anything for his life but you know what let me touch him we know the story again look at it a man that was faithful to the call and he served god the best he knew he gave his all that even after he lost everything he was still faithful to god and now his body he was in so much pain so much eggs sleepless nights normally somebody has to die before you see worms coming out of your body but he was living and worms were coming out of his body no wonder he cares the day he was born would you still trust in god in your darkest hour in your darkest hour not when life is good but in your darkest hour would you still have faith in that god you are saving he never gave up give up on god so much so that his own wife sabbah why don't you just cast god and die because the man was going through a lot he said don't speak like one of those foolish women must we only receive good from god and not evil can you imagine a man in that condition praise be to god he said praise god anyhow you got to that place and you glorify god when you know who your god is have a relationship with god have a relationship with god do not let anything take the place of god in your life praise be to god let your attention be here in your darkest hour in your darkest hour with you so trust in him look at mary and mata when their only brother was sick and they sent for the lord jesus christ and he didn't come and their brother died and was buried now look at it when they had jesus was coming if it were you and i we probably would have entered the room he waited for our brother to die now where is he going he was only a good friend when things were good we used to cook for him and he would come and spend time our older brother was sick we said for him he never came he is dead what is he coming for hey mata let's go to the room and we look up and jesus comes don't mind him when is that he'll go but it wasn't so with them even though they trusted in him even though they believed he was the one that was going to save their brother and he didn't show up and they died he died anyhow they so had so much confidence in him they still had a lot of trust in him so much so that when the head he was coming they didn't even wait for him to come they beat him outside there praise be to god in the darkest hour of your life would you so trust him trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do will you trust him when it is not the popular way to go we are living in a world where it is not a popular thing to do serving god is not the popular thing in this life in this in this world we are living in look at the job places at the workplaces it's okay when you have homosexuals and lesbians talking about your face and everybody around kind of they just want to contribute it's okay when people go to the concert and they come oh i went to a concert this weekend oh everybody's talking yeah who was that what was that and they are all contributing oh how much was it was it nice they are all talking everybody wants to contribute it's okay on the job for people to talk about any nonsense they have but as soon as you start talking about god they look at one another's face those who want to live who live those who are not interests will burden their hearts and you can see it praise be to god serving god is not the popular way so if you want the popular way you are at the wrong place would you still trust in god when trusting in him is not the popular way to go at the disciples of the lord jesus it was not the popular way to go in his days the popular way was just to team up with the science they did the pharisees and they said you cease and shout let this blood come upon us and upon our children that was the popular way and yet they stood their crowns and when the devil cannot get you to stay away and he can get you to come to church all the same and get you to have one leg in the world and one leg in church he is comfortable with that he doesn't have to worry about you you have to watch the last day spirit that laodicean church is spirit you have to watch it the bible says in the book of revelation 3 in the book of revelation 3 that i know your words that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that was either cold or hot but because thou art lukewarm i will spew you out of my mouth people want to live in the world and they want to serve god at the same time you can't serve two masters at the same time and if the devil can get you to that point where you can do a little bit of the world and do a little bit of the church he is fine with that and that is the spirit we should be watching out for that lukewarm spirit that when you look at the world you identify yourself with the world and you still want to identify yourself with church and what god is doing in the house of god would you trust him when it is not the popular way to go trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do trust in him one it is the hardest thing to do look at abraham when god gave him the promise that he was going to have a child he probably thought it was going to be in in a matter of a year or two years or five years and it went on on on on a scientifically the longer he waited for the promise the more impossible it was if you were in abraham's shoes would you still believe in the promise that god has given you or you are going to believe science over the world there is a story i'm not touching my nose i'm just speaking from it i don't want to even go by it praise be to god there is a story of a 16 year old girl by the name fatima fatima was born a muslim and as i said i was a muslim before and they used to call me sadat if i tell you the circumstances under which i came to christianity it was just the hand of god i have told that story but i don't think i'm telling it today and fatima a muslim girl 16 years old she had a friend that they used to go to school together and then she'll go to this friend and a friend will say i'm going to church let's go she said no i'm a muslim so one day she said let's go together and then they all went and from that time on fatima would go to church with her friend from that time on and then he got to a point fatima said you know i want to get baptized and the pastor said that is good but go and tell your mother because fatima was an only child fatima didn't grow to see her father her mother was her mother and her father at the same time she went and told the mother that mommy in fact i want to become a christian initially the mother disagreed but then she kept persisting then the master the mother said go and tell your uncles if they agree go ahead and do it so she went told the ankles and the anchors got so angry now i am telling you for a fact that in the muslim world if you want to live that faith to join christianity your whole family will kill you and they call that honor killing they say it's an honor to the family for them to lose you to another faith especially christianity they will kill you and that is fine and they were so angry with her and they said you know if you die we are not paying your school fees anymore we are done with you and then she went and told the mother say okay i told you then she said you know mommy i still want to do it. the mother said go ahead so she went got baptized started going to church this family was there helping her everything was so nice life was good in a way and this family had to leave and now fatima was on her on her own going to church anyway she never stopped and then her mother took ill of a terminal disease and she was dying and she was admitted to the hospital the last two months of her mother's sickness was very terrible she was admitted to the hospital now here she is an only child 16 years old how many of us adults adults i'm not talking of a child are able to shoulders trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do they were living in a village the mother was admitted to the hospital now if the hospital in america here is all you know you don't actually know what i'm talking about these hospitals are different that when you are lying down you want the nurse to come you just press a button and they show up anything you want you press the button i remember one time my wife went she was lying down and she was not getting the button she pressed something and they all came running the doctor the nurses everybody came running nobody presses this she said i didn't know i am talking of a hospital when you go you are on your own i remember december 1985 december 22nd i took ill of pneumonia in ghana and i was admitted to the hospital i spent that night after 24th night christmas day i was in the hospital and were only two people the awards are not like this 24 rooms i mean 24 beds you can stand at the end and see all the best there were two nurses who were two patients they came do you have anybody around here so you can go and stay with the person i said no they went to the person the other person the other person said yes and he left there were two nurses by 12 midnight i was on my own there was no light in the hospital it was a lantern a lantern at the desk i spent the whole i spent the night in the hospital alone the following day when my parents came and i told her i said no you're not spending the night here we are going home if you are going to die let's go home you die in the house a hospital like that her mother was admitted to fatima will get up no money nobody for her to go to there was no help coming from anywhere fatima will get up 16 year old girl go to the bush go and cut dry firewood carried on her head come and sell it i can identify with that i did that before when i was small you will carry the wood and your neck would just go in you are sweating your neck is paining you and your jaws begin to hurt and you get then you throw the firewood down and it's like you just grew taller and this was what fatima was doing come just go and they will give her some small money she will go buy what she can buy with that money get to the house prepare some food carry to her mother and she will do that in the morning boil water i am not turning i'm not talking of turning on the stove or the range and heating water that's not what i'm talking about you have to get firewood put it in the half light it put a body heat the water up and the water there is no tap why you just turn the water on you have to go to the stream go and get the water come and boil it and as you put it in a bucket and then cover it up with a i mean with a towel put it on her head go to the hospital for her mother to go and take her bath and then sit down for the mother to eat before fatwa will come back from the hospital and then get ready to go to school and fatima would come and she gets to school late and when she gets to school late the teacher would call her to in front of the class why did you get to school late bring your hand and then the teacher will whip her and she'll be there jumping and the students are laughing you know how mischievous students can be and they are laughing kick kick kick the following day the same thing fighting my country changed they didn't know what was going on in her life she would come they'll whip her she will cry she would jump sit down go through the school day when she closes and she's going home when others are just going home to their families she has no family to go to she goes she's going to the bush going to cut firewood to go and sell when about what she can buy come get something ready boil some water get it to the mother that was just a routine for two months and every day the whipper in school every day the whipper in school and then one day before then all the prayer fatim i knew you could just sum that up into three ways all the prayers she knew she looks up in the skies father i love you won't you love me father i love you wouldn't you love me that was all fatima's prayer when life gets so hard and so tough and so rough and then oh should i go back to my uncles and go and just apologize so they can take me back probably life will be better and then something can say no i will not do it if i have to die for this cause i am going to die but i'm not going back i am not going back praise be to god the bible says he does put his heart to the plow and turns back is not worthy of me and there is a song that says i have decided to follow jesus that is not turning back there is no turning back there is no turning back praise be to god that was how once upon a time there was a king of his people would go to war and for every time they would kill the people and the people ran away they would kill them and the few ran away and the last time they went he said you know what when we cross the bridge we are going to blow that bridge we are going to blow it it's because there is a bridge and you guys have the comfort of running away that is why when the war gets tough you guys ran away this time when we cross the bridge we are blowing the bridge there is no turning back and when you know there is no turning back the fight is different and that was how come this time they won the war a lot of us still have bridges connecting us back to old friends connecting us back to the world connecting us back to different things and because of that there is no commitment there is no commitment we are just in for a while when the going gets tough then we are running away why because there is no commitment but if there is commitment if there is a sense of commitment if it will cause you to die you would die for your faith when the soviet union was soviet union there was a story of a soldier who took his gun and he knew that some believers were meeting somewhere in a house it is not the type of freedom we have here that you have the freedom you have the freedom to carry your bible and stand in the street and read and praise god people walk by and think you are mad that is okay and then he went to this place and then he knocked at the door entered there and then he caught his ak-47 he said you hypocrites you guys are those making this country difficult christians i'm going to kill all of you but before i start killing whoever is here and he knows he doesn't believe should get out oh no i i didn't believe then he walks out no no no this is my first time he goes out um i know i just came to see what was going on the workshop and then they kept going that one by one kept going out one by one and they run so fast that they even forgot to close the door behind them and when they were gone the soldier closed the door and he turned the gun on the rest so you guys are the believers you are the christians i'm going to kill all of you and then the pastor in the midst said we are ready to die for our faith [Music] for me to live is christ and to die is gain i am ready to die for my faith i am not going to renounce christ i have not come this far to turn back i am ready you can go ahead shoot me first and then he uncocked the gun and put it down and then sat down praise the lord and he said you know what i just came to have fellowship [Music] [Applause] yes that everywhere i go that i see people [Music] people christ all over i want true believers people i can just associate with and worship god praise me to god yes you say you know what you are my brothers and sisters and then they started worshiping some people just hang around just long enough till there is problem and then they run away as a matter of fact there are some that want to even go but then they are waiting for an excuse so they can say i went because of this if you are that type of person don't wait for an excuse just go praise god don't wait for anybody to offend you just go fatima i've never forgotten my story [Music] wants to go back should i go to my uncle and just plead with them probably they will take me back but something in here says no and all she would do look to the heavens father i love you wouldn't you love me i love you father why don't you love me and she is not hearing from god is this god real this god you are talking about is he real is he actually there and he if he is why is he not hearing me is he not seeing my tears is he not seeing what i'm going through trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do and then one day the people came to school and they were waiting to see fatima they were happy fatima was like coffee in the morning so the whip and they would laugh laugh and rejoice fatima didn't show up that's how she came tomorrow she didn't show up and then five days in a row fatima didn't show up then they knew that oh fatima has dropped from school and they said no it's even good for her she's good for nothing every day you come in late they're with you never change then they come the following week fight when i wasn't there the whole week fatima was not there two weeks in a row then they said oh yeah she has dropped now you can drop us through it's not like america here when you don't go to school for one day the school is calling calling home to find out what is wrong and if they are not catching anybody they are sending a social worker to come and find out what is wrong in the house i didn't go to school for three months when i was in form two and my parents never knew about it i would get up in the morning and leave the house and they know i'm going to school there was a mango forest i would go and be in the mango forest with a friend and we'll just clear mongoose like monkeys from one branch to another and those who actually went to school will get to the house before me i dated for three months one day i said no let me just go to school because it was getting to the end of the term and then i just go to school sneaked in and sat down i will never forget that teacher's name mrs fatty miss fati miss fatigues dania i said yes madam hey come here come where have you been three months i couldn't talk he said no i'll not let you spoil he said you are too good to spoil the way she whipped me what do you guys call abuse in america we call it discipline because of that i have never forgotten her name [Music] when i go to ghana i'll go and look for her even if she's dead i will make sure i get her grave miss fatih three months and my parents didn't know and they never got to know about it here in america they don't go to school one day they call if they don't get to their senate police social worker to come and find out what is going on two weeks two weeks five minutes didn't go to school oh she's lost she's good for her and then the third week before they came to school fatima was the first person to be in school everybody was amazed and then the teacher came to class and then she caused everybody's attention and said fatima was the first person to come to school shall we applaud her and then when the french are plotting her she's a fighter but it's not over come for the two weeks you didn't come to school i'm going to whip you for it the fatima came so bring your hand say before i before you with me can i say something he said no what are you going to say hurry up he said no can i just say something say go ahead he said you know what all that time i was coming to school late i had a mother who was sick and she was she was sick to the point of death and was in the hospital and i'm an only child and i had to go to the bush after school get firewood come to the house come and sell get some food ready for her edit the following morning get her water to bath before i get back to the house and then get ready to come to school that was why i always came in late but for the two weeks you guys didn't see me she passed so i was in the house mourning her and i'm ellie to school today because there is nobody to take care of and then she did this and then the cane dropped from the teacher's hand and the teacher said why didn't you tell us this all this time he said no it's my cross but you should have told somebody he said no it's my cross and then all the school the people filed just one after the other and they came and started hugging fatima fatima we are sorry fight i'm sorry forgive me first i'm sorry forgive me fatima i'm sorry forgive me and the case went to the district office and this office took the mata over and her life changed from that time it changed so much so that they gave her scholarships her life changed so much so that finally in her life her uncles wanted to come back trust in him one it is the hardest thing to do how many of us would walk in fatima's shoes and still believe the god we are believing today how many of us after what fatima went through and she was still holding on believing in a girl she had never seen she only heard of a girl she had never experienced and she was still holding on and some of us have seen signs of miracles in diverse places and the little thing that happens we are ready to throw in the towel where do you stand on that day with such a little girl why do you stand we are not talking about you trusting and believing in god one things are rosy one things are good one you are comfortable one things are going your way but in the hardest moment of your life would you still believe in that god that god you claim that you know that god is a prayer answering god and that you have put a request before god and here you've been crying out to god crying out to him crying out and yet it's like he's paid a deaf ear to your call and you see god moving around you see you see god changing lives you see god performing miracles here and there and the one thing you have put before god and you've been crying day and night day and night it's like that god has paid a death ear to your call would you still believe him yes would you still trust in him that when people at work have ganked up against you in falsehood and people are ready to testify against you maliciously and you know it is not the truth and you are crying out to god for god to vindicate himself and you are not hearing back would you still believe in that god the times we are living in we are living in the most difficult times and if christ terrorists conditions are going to get worse and worse and worse the only way you can make it is to make sure that you have a relationship with god don't come to church because you want to please anybody don't come because you want to be seen don't come to church and then sit down and sleep as a matter of fact it's a very dangerous thing to sleep in the house of god amen because when the word of god is being preached and as you sit down and you are taking in the word evil spirits are living they are living you don't even realize it it only gets to a point in time and you realize that you know what i used to deal with this condition but it is no more you don't even know when it left [Music] but one thing happens then when the evil spirits leave they are looking for another vessel to enter into so when you are sitting here and you are sleeping under the anointing of the word of god when the evil spirit is leaving one vessel is looking for the easiest one to inhabit you become a target is the reason why some people come to church healthy and go back sick come with your heart open come ready and willing to hear from god never depart from the word never if a man steals your car and you never get the car back forgive them if you're walking by the road and somebody just comes and give you a slap forgive them as hard as hard as it may be if somebody shows you their calling names they make fun of you have mercy on them forgive them but if somebody comes and tries to get you away from the word of god if you can take a picture of them take it and write satan under it that is the devil right there in human flesh just make sure they don't carry it to culture because if they carry the court i'm not be there to defend you but you have seen satan any spirit that will try to take you away from the word of god is nothing but the enemy hold that word so dear let it be so dear to you have a relationship with god because the only way the only way you can trust and keep trusting in god in the midst of the storms in difficult times when it is very difficult to trust in him that you can still keep trusting is when you have a relationship with him and you'll get to that point to know that oh there have been times when i actually wanted to just let go and as a matter of fact sometimes you let go the steering wheel you let go the steering wheel but you never end up in the ditch because he takes over praise be to god i like it when i'm talking from my heart straight praise be to god trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do the prophet says something and i want us to look at it just read in the message the mighty conqueror i think it wasn't forgotten the year but the mighty conqueror the angels sang and praised the monster as it moved down the street as the mighty conqueror who had conquered the sins of the world and had brought forth the righteous triumphantly on down through the city they went till they come to the throne there upon the throne sat the mighty jehovah mighty conqueror and as jesus came to the throne he fell on his knees and he said father i have finished that work that you gave to me to do i have paid the debt for sin i have the keys of both deaf and hell and your enemy is defeated and these are those who waited patiently for this hour and i can see the father as he sat climb up here on my throne my son and sit here until i make every enemy your footstool praise be to god there he sits the mighty conqueror trusting in his word believing everything he says trusting him as my all as my breath as my life as all that i have tonight i fully surrender myself to him both soul body and spirit looking for his second coming in glory when i'm sad i trust in him when i'm glad i trust in him when i'm sick i trust in him and when i'm lost i trust in him whatever befores me i trust him praise be to god and you wonder the prophet saying when i'm lost even when i'm lost i trust in him even when an angel comes to tell you that you are wasting your time and that you will die and you go to hell i would encourage you to keep trusting in him hold on first with the word of god if you can hold on first to the word of god and die believing in god if you even end up in hell it is going to be anything but hell hell cannot contain god praise be to god if you end up in hell with the word it will be something else but hell praise be to god that even when i'm lost even when i'm lost i trust in him in my saddest moment i want to trust in god when i'm happy i want to trust in god when i understand i want to trust in god when i don't i still want to trust in god praise be to god trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do musicians can come over trust in him when it is the hardest thing to do and i want us to take our bibles for some reason just go back go back to some 62 again truly my soul waited upon god from him cometh my salvation salvation is of the lord is not a man's making you can't work it out now people try to work out your own salvation i don't care how many broken bottles you work you walk on or how many times you walk on it can't change anything you either accept what the lord has done or you are in danger of condemnation praise be to god he is only he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing world shall it be and as a torturing their only console to cast him down from his excellency their delight in lies they're blessed with their mouth but they cast inwardly praise be to god my soul went down only upon god is that your prayer this morning is that your prayer this afternoon my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him and god would meet every expectation of your heart whatever your expectations are god in his good time would meet every one of them [Music] my soul went down only upon god my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times you people trust in him at all times trust in god at all times if you forget anything that was said here during the course of this service remember this that trust in god at all times in good times and in bad times [Music] whether god answers your prayer or not trust in him [Music] never turn your back on god for this world is not worth our attention this world is already gone [Music] it is already gone know who you are that you are a child of god and when you know who you are and what your purpose is it doesn't matter what you go through it will not take you away from who you are like that slave we have heard of a lot of times know who you are [Music] praise be to god shall we go to the lord in prayer i want you to talk to god i don't know in whatever way god has spoken to you because the bible says that all scripture all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in all righteousness i don't know how god has spoken to you but the bible has given us a promise that the word of god will not go out and come back void there is a reason why this way we have gone this way this morning i cannot even tell but i want you to set yourself set your heart i want you to talk to god talk to god as a son as a daughter of god we are to have a relationship with our god do not let the pressure there is there is so much pressure on the land enough pressure to take you away from the love of god there is enough pressure to keep you embarrassed but i don't care how busy you are i don't care how much pressure there is find time to seek the face of god find time to seek the face of god do not let the dog go by without you having a relationship with god try to seek the face of god by day and by night he is our rock he is our defense he is our comfort he is our joy he is everything to us if you set the lord aside life would never be the same it's just a matter of time and we'll be out of here praise be to god in whatever way god has spoken to you i want you to talk to god our lord and our savior jesus we thank this so much oh god for this morning afternoon father we are so grateful oh god for having guided us by your feet lord and for

everything we would ever do you knew every sin we would that we would commit or god you knew everything and yet lord god you still chose us lord god you still wanted us help us lord god to want you help us lord god to desire father to have your word lord god in our hearts or god that we would desire father to know you more we desire lord god to walk with you more we desire lord god to spend more time with you more time in your presence father we just asked lord god that you would help us that you would bless us that you would draw us lord that you would cause us lord jesus to surrender that
