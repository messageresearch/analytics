[1:41] church we have tried to go accordingly
[1:44] to the way we understand the orders
[1:48] given in the dedication of the new
[1:51] church and by doing so some have gotten
[1:57] mad and left the church and others will
[2:01] not listen to anything we
[2:04] say especially the children we have talk
[2:08] to the parents about their children and
[2:12] they won't take care of them
[2:16] now have we misunderstood or are we
[2:20] going about it in the wrong way thanks
[2:24] now let me answer this as they come
[2:28] down um and and respect to the order of
[2:31] the church we have tried to go
[2:33] accordingly to the way we understood at
[2:36] given in the dedication of the new
[2:38] church now that's correct you're doing
[2:40] right now this is supposed to be deacons
[2:42] I suppose because it's right here it's a
[2:44] Deacon's job all right and by doing so
[2:48] we have often people has often gotten
[2:51] mad at us they do at me too they'll do
[2:54] it any man see a person that does that
[2:58] there's something wrong with that person
[3:00] they're not right with God for the
[3:02] spirit of Christ is subject to Christ
[3:06] teaching Christ house Christ order and
[3:10] any man that or any woman or any
[3:13] person's children that would get angry
[3:16] with a Godly Deacon that would tell them
[3:18] to be or any parent would get angry with
[3:21] the Deacon really we want everybody in
[3:24] this church that we can get but if that
[3:26] would only cause trouble somewhere else
[3:29] there's a thought
[3:30] or rabbit in the woodpile as we used to
[3:32] say it that person isn't right if they
[3:35] leave there's only one thing to do let
[3:37] them go and pray for
[3:38] them then maybe some of the deacons go
[3:40] to the church or go to the house
[3:42] sometime and find out why they left and
[3:45] ask them what was wrong then and if they
[3:47] see if he can reconcile him if he can't
[3:49] then take two or three Witnesses with
[3:51] him that they might be understood then
[3:53] if he can't be understood then it's told
[3:54] before the church if they are a member
[3:56] here of the church then they are and
[3:58] then if they're not members of the
[3:59] Church of course they're not members of
[4:01] this congregation they should be made to
[4:03] to be rued see they they've got to
[4:05] listen to our orders here because this
[4:07] is the orders of the church this is
[4:09] things we don't want to do things that I
[4:11] don't like to do but it's things that
[4:13] must be do and I'm exposing myself and
[4:15] tell them here but this tape it's me
[4:16] they can hear me talking and know that's
[4:18] me not you man you've asked me these
[4:21] questions and I'm giving it to you the
[4:23] best that I know how from the word of
[4:25] God now if those people get angry go out
[4:28] from you what is the scripture say about
[4:30] it brother Braham they went out from us
[4:32] because they wasn't of
[4:34] us that settles
[4:36] it left the church that's what they did
[4:39] all right others will not listen to
[4:41] anything we say especially the children
[4:45] the children are supposed to know
[4:47] discipline they should get it at home
[4:50] but even if it's mine my kids getting
[4:53] here anytime they get this already I
[4:55] don't want you to draw One String Sarah
[4:58] Rebecca Joseph Billy or whoever it might
[5:00] be you tell me I'll see to it if they
[5:05] can't behave then they'll stay away from
[5:06] church till they do learn to behave this
[5:08] is not an arena this is a house of God
[5:11] this is not a place to play and skate
[5:13] and write notes and laugh and cut up
[5:15] this is the house of God is be carried
[5:18] out Godly you come here to worship not
[5:20] even to visit this is not a this is not
[5:23] a picnic ground this not a visitation
[5:26] place this is the visitation place of
[5:28] the holy spirit this L to what he has to
[5:30] say not to one another we don't come
[5:32] here to Fellowship uh with one another
[5:35] we come here to fellowship with Christ
[5:37] This is a house of worship and children
[5:39] must be disciplined and if they are of
[5:42] the parents let it be known if these
[5:47] deacons if these parents of the children
[5:51] will not listen to what these deacons
[5:52] said then this parents should be
[5:55] corrected
[5:56] themselves we have talked to the parent
[5:59] parents about the children and they
[6:02] won't take care of them if they are
[6:04] members of this church then you should
[6:06] take two or three with you and call that
[6:09] parent into a private
[6:11] meeting into one of the offices I don't
[6:15] care who it is if it's me if it's
[6:17] brother Neville it's Billy Paul and his
[6:20] little boy if it's brother Collins and
[6:21] one of his children or any rest of you
[6:24] we're we love one another but we're Duty
[6:27] bound to God in this word
[6:32] it's D but no matter who it is we're to
[6:35] call one another in and be honest with
[6:38] one another how can God ever deal with
[6:40] us if we're not honest with one another
[6:41] how are we going to be honest with him
[6:43] see this is an order we must keep the
[6:46] house of God and deacons are supposed to
[6:49] know how to do that and that's why I'm
[6:51] telling you now I keep them things call
[6:53] them and if this you tell the parents
[6:55] and they won't listen to the won't
[6:56] listen to it then you get you another
[6:58] Deacon or one of the trustees or some
[7:00] good person in this church and call take
[7:02] your trust take your Deacon boore all
[7:05] your deacons together say brother Jones
[7:07] brother Henderson brother Jackson or
[7:09] whoever it might be see their children
[7:11] are disbehaving we've told them two
[7:12] three times about these children and
[7:13] they won't listen to it then call
[7:14] Brother Jones and or brother whoever it
[7:16] is and say brother Jones We've called
[7:18] you in here for a meeting we love you
[7:20] and you're a part of us you're one of us
[7:23] let me just sit in a certain tape and
[7:25] listen to what brother brandom said
[7:26] about it see now we've asked you to make
[7:29] the those children behave see if they
[7:32] won't behave and you can't make them
[7:33] behave in church leave them with someone
[7:35] while you come to church until they
[7:37] learn how to behave thems in the house
[7:39] of
[7:40] God but this is an order it's got to be
[7:42] carried out see now other question goes
[7:46] on now have we misunderstood no sir you
[7:50] haven't misunderstood that's correct I'm
[7:52] saying it again the orders in the army
[7:55] they don't ask you will you go do a
[7:58] certain thing if you're in the Army
[8:00] you're compelled to do it see and that's
[8:04] the way it is in the I'm compelled to
[8:06] preach the gospel I'm compelled to stand
[8:09] for this regardless of what my other man
[8:11] and Brethren and so forth say about I'm
[8:13] compelled to do this I have to hurt
[8:14] feelings and cut man to Pieces but if I
[8:17] you don't want to get like oswal see if
[8:21] you can't disagree with a man in things
[8:23] then shake his hand and still have the
[8:24] same feelings towards him then there's
[8:26] something wrong with
[8:27] you if I can't disagree agree with a man
[8:30] bitterly from one side to the other and
[8:32] still think as much of him as as Christ
[8:35] would and there's something wrong with
[8:36] my spirit I haven't the spirit of
[8:39] Christ if he says well brother brandom I
[8:43] believe that you are teaching is this
[8:45] all right brother let's come together to
[8:46] reason you and I we'll take it ourselves
[8:48] we'll go over here in the room to
[8:49] ourselves we'll reason it out and he
[8:51] just cuts me to pieces now I have to say
[8:54] things back to him if in my heart I
[8:56] can't feel the same about him and he's
[8:57] still my brother and I'm trying to help
[9:00] him then I'll never help him there's no
[9:02] way for me to help him if I don't love
[9:05] him what's Ed of going over there
[9:07] telling in first place first brother I
[9:08] don't love you and let me get that out
[9:10] of my heart right here before we go in
[9:11] there because I can't help you until I
[9:13] love you and that's right and that's the
[9:16] way see car on you've done it exactly
[9:19] right that's the way it should be you
[9:20] never misunderstood are we going about
[9:22] the wrong way no it is the right way
[9:25] they carry that let order be kept
[9:27] because it's constantly uh Little
[9:30] Children mothers little babies and
[9:32] things they they'll cry and if they get
[9:34] crying too much and interrupting your
[9:35] pastor up there remember you are his
[9:39] bodyguards you're his gospel
[9:42] bodyguards see and if it's interrupting
[9:45] the message of the Lord then you are
[9:48] deacons what are you to do just like men
[9:49] speaking in tongues he's Duty bound and
[9:52] a man preaching he's Duty bound to the
[9:54] word he's Duty bound to these things
[9:57] each one of you is Duty bound to an
[9:58] office and
[10:00] that's just what we're uh we're here to
[10:03] do now we don't want to wait too long
[10:05] and I know I got an appointment a few
[10:07] minutes so I'll I'll just try to hurry
[10:09] as quick as I can brother Brenham
[10:12] there's three two questions on this card
[10:14] here brother brand what should be the
[10:17] policy of taking up offerings in the
[10:20] church for
[10:22] people how should this be
[10:26] done I think taking up offerings in the
[10:28] church for people should not be done
[10:31] unless it's for your pastor and I think
[10:34] if someone comes in for charity or
[10:36] something like that that or someone in
[10:40] in bad need like one of our members here
[10:43] a congregation say have one of our
[10:45] brothers and uh they have some trouble
[10:49] well I think then that should be
[10:51] announced at the platform and let the
[10:53] pastor do that I think it's his duty to
[10:56] do that some brother that's in need of
[10:58] something let him present it to the
[11:00] church if it wants to be taken that way
[11:02] if it's someone in need and um and then
[11:05] uh you don't want to take the offering
[11:06] up far the person that's in need then
[11:08] let the boards meet together and agree
[11:12] upon certain sums that they want to give
[11:14] to this person out of the treasury but
[11:17] the treasur is low at that time and they
[11:19] can't afford to do it then it has to be
[11:21] taken up well let let the let it be
[11:24] talked with the board given orders to
[11:25] the pastor and let the pastor ask for
[11:28] this certain thing said tonight our
[11:30] brother Jones he had a a horrible
[11:33] accident his house burned down and
[11:36] tonight as Christians we're going
[11:38] together to each one of us make a pledge
[11:40] of what we can do to help brother Jones
[11:42] back with his house again see or or
[11:44] whatever it is see we do that let that
[11:47] be said from the platform that's the way
[11:49] to do that and then let the pledges be
[11:51] given and then give it over to The
[11:54] Treasure of the church and these pledges
[11:56] be paid to The Treasure of the church
[11:58] and give to them and and give the person
[12:00] a receipt for it because I don't know
[12:01] where that's tax redemption or not I
[12:03] guess it is for something like that now
[12:06] but when it comes to like a a stranger
[12:08] come
[12:09] in a stranger come in like the man comes
[12:12] in said well you know what I um I I'm on
[12:16] a journey and uh I blow out a tire and I
[12:18] want a new tire take me up offering
[12:19] tonight for a new tire now that
[12:22] shouldn't be done no that should not be
[12:25] done and if it seems to if it seems to
[12:28] be a worthy thing of somebody that you
[12:30] know the board could meet and designate
[12:33] a certain amount of money from the
[12:35] treasure to buy that manatar or whatever
[12:38] it was or either if the church treasur
[12:41] is low and it's decided by the board uh
[12:44] that these the pastor shouldn't have
[12:46] nothing to do in this the the deacons is
[12:48] forced to do this are the boards and now
[12:52] if this um if it's agreed not give to
[12:55] the pastor the pastor can take the
[12:57] offering but notice
[12:59] [Music]
[13:00] if it's a
[13:01] stranger it's in an emergency a fell
[13:04] needs a little money and you feel it
[13:07] it's for a just
[13:09] cause uh this is my opinion if it's for
[13:13] a real just cause and you know it is for
[13:16] a just C now first if you go up there
[13:20] and look on my books at the house of
[13:22] people coming by say I'm Reverend so and
[13:24] so from this certain certain church and
[13:26] I I had some trouble down the road here
[13:28] and I I need need a set of tars and know
[13:30] I just come in from a meeting and had an
[13:32] offering or something like that I give
[13:34] it to them really to go get a set of
[13:35] tars and look in the minutes there no
[13:37] was such a minister is that never lived
[13:38] in such a place and there's 10 or
[13:42] $20,000 on the books from these years
[13:44] I've give out like that never know
[13:46] nothing about him worthy was come to
[13:48] find out other ministers say well he
[13:49] made me for so and so and so and so now
[13:51] the church is not responsible only for
[13:53] their
[13:54] own that's right their own they're
[13:56] responsible but if it seems to be a
[13:58] worth calls and then if you the if you
[14:01] trustees might say well now wait a
[14:03] minute this man there is his car down
[14:06] there this is to happen and this it's
[14:08] not of our congregation see but it is
[14:11] then if they want to do it like that and
[14:13] would say something special about an
[14:14] outsider not our own now see not our own
[14:17] people our own people be taken up right
[14:20] here amongst their their own their
[14:21] brothers here see but if it's somebody
[14:23] on the outside and the fellow says he's
[14:26] hungry or and somebody wants to reach
[14:27] down his pocket and give him charity
[14:29] that's up to you but I'm talking about
[14:32] from the church and then if the church
[14:34] people are asked to donate then now if
[14:38] you got an evangelist of course in he
[14:40] preaching then you take you that's
[14:41] understood before he comes you know that
[14:43] you'll give him offering or pay him
[14:45] salary or whatever he wants to do but
[14:47] then if this person is here it's for a
[14:49] just cause and the pastor and the board
[14:52] would want to agree and tell the pastor
[14:54] app on it they let the pastor say a
[14:56] certain certain person is sitting here
[14:58] we don't know the man he come in and he
[15:01] ask us for he says his children are
[15:03] hungry we haven't got the time we
[15:06] haven't had the time to investigate the
[15:09] the the the claim see if there's
[15:13] anything like that that are or if
[15:15] there's anything among our own our our
[15:17] own deacons go investigate those claims
[15:19] see then if it's worthy then do it if it
[15:22] isn't worthy don't do it don't have to
[15:25] but now if it's a man here and you you
[15:28] let the pastor say now the trustee board
[15:30] told me they did not know this person
[15:33] but the man is sitting here he says his
[15:35] name is Jim Jones or whatever it might
[15:37] be and he's sitting right here would you
[15:39] stand up Mr Jones now Mr Jones at the
[15:42] end of the service you stand just at the
[15:45] back door there as you go out and if any
[15:47] people feel in your heart or anything
[15:50] that you want to do for this man give it
[15:51] to him as you go out is that understood
[15:54] now did you get that on
[15:57] yours uh to those who are on the tape
[16:00] and uh one of the brother Collins missed
[16:03] it on his tape I want to uh reinstate
[16:06] that the quotation again if uh because
[16:09] he's one of the deacons if uh if there
[16:12] be any other one man comes in that you
[16:16] and is in emergency and he wants an
[16:18] offering from the church let the
[16:20] trustees or deacons meet together and um
[16:24] let the meet together and make this
[16:26] decision then tell the pastor it might
[16:29] be done like this let
[16:32] them let the pastors say that this
[16:34] certain man call him by name we know him
[16:38] not and our policy here is to in
[16:42] investigate before we take offerings for
[16:45] people and that is of our own but this
[16:48] man here he says he's broke down he's
[16:50] had emergency he's got sick children he
[16:52] trying to get medicine for his children
[16:54] or whatever it might be the emergency
[16:57] now he's standing right here would you
[16:58] stand up Sir see and let him stand up
[17:01] and say now you people see what who he
[17:03] is now at the close of this service this
[17:05] man shall stand there at the front door
[17:08] and people going out that feel that you
[17:10] want to contribute to this you're at
[17:12] liberty we only announced it in the
[17:14] church you're not sanctioning it you're
[17:16] only announcing it see that's
[17:19] Hospitality to a stranger see understand
[17:24] now all right I think that settles that
[17:27] question what about
