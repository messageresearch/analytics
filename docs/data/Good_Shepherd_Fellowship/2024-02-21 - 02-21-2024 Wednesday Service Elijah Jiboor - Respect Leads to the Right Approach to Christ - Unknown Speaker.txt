Sunday we were reading the uh portion of the cup there from the the Sunday School tape and brother B was talking about those that uh s and cry for the Abomination that is done in the City of Minneapolis and uh uh right after the service when we went home and looking through the the the news field uh uh on my on my phone realized that uh the city of Burnsville all through the night uh had a they had a case there where the city lost two of uh the police officer and one paramedic and and uh and what I was just reading there through the news and it just hit my mind and uh uh thinking on the very thought of the things that are done within our city but here he said the Lord watch over us and uh keep us together you watch over our going out and our coming in and sometimes we can go an entire de and not even realizing all the wrongs and all the evils that are done around us it's not because we are perfect it's all because he promised to build a wall of protection around us he promised to give his Angel charge over us and and all of these things bring us to the place where we we uh learn to appreciate the grace of God and that's what I want for us to do tonight I want for us to live our voices together and just thank the Lord and toight I was uh just spending some time in thinking about this to realize that 59 years ago brother Brandon preached that message marriage and divorce and I was thinking about it uh uh and just saying uh what a message of Pardon what a message of grace and the thought that was on my mind of which I I tried to put these dates in in places it is all in the place that uh those men that we read out of the scripture they walk on this very same Earth those messages were preached in the same country the Revival took place here you walk on this same street d drove around this place maybe they were not paved like the way they are but it is right on this same Earth and this is our time this is our time let's just uh speak to the Lord

of God and we see I trying to read the book of Psalm before I see anything just read the scripture so we cannot keep us keep standing for a long time amen the book of Psalm Hallelujah want to read the book of Psalm 65 amen Psalm 65 read verse 4 now Psalms 65:4 that read the word of God the Bible said blessed is the man whom thou has chosen and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in the court we shall be certifi with the goodness of thy house even unto thy Holy Temple May Lord are a blessing to the reading of his word please be seated amen I thank God to be your mid again amen and

gathering bless the meetings hallelujah amen the time of Fellowship around God's word and God bless you for holding the work on on this side and God should God should bless everyone of us our effort in God's work I believe is never in vain Hallelujah I believe God have a purpose for that Hallelujah and and you don't know we all going to get our reward someday and they all keep holding on the battle hallelujah amen hallelujah so by the grace of God and just approach the word of life and talk on on God's word and I want to speak this this evening on respect lead to the right approach to Christ respect lead to the right approach to Christ and I just read the book of Psalm 65 verse4 because the Bible said blessed is the man whom the Lord chooses so we can see if you to approach Christ God have to call you and it's a blessing for God to call you and not only calling you but trues you hallelujah it's a blessing because not everybody can come to him because Jesus said in his word no man can come except the father draw him so it take it's a blessing for God to call you and for God to chooses you to come unto him Hallelujah so the Bible say say blessed is the man whom the Lord chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in the court and we shall be set with the goodness of that house even to that Holy Temple so when God call you it's a blessing when God chooses you it's a blessing I say many are cou few are chosen when God call you then God can chooses you and when God don't choose you you cannot approach him Hallelujah but when God call you he chooses you then give you Grace to come before his throne to approach him or else you going to approach the Lord hallelujah so he said then he call CES you chues you to approach him that he can dwell in his Temple Hallelujah so you can see that that is what the word of God says that is what you look in the book of Psalm you look in the book of Psalm 101:1 the Bible said for the fear of God is a beginning of what wisdom yes the fear of God is a beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all did th do his commandment his Praises endures forever so you can see the fear of God the begin of wisdom and no fear bring what respect Hallelujah if you don't fear Him you cannot respect him when you fear him then you respect him Hallelujah and respect bring what reverence Hallelujah and when you reverence and you have respect and you have fear then it will lead to the right approach if you don't have fear you don't have reverence you don't respect and you don't have fear your approach will be different Hallelujah watch those who don't have no respect have no fear for the things of God hallelujah or ins for their parents or for their loved ones for their wife or for their husband Hallelujah they watch the approach how they approach situations in the home how they children approach issue between children and what and parents if they not fear the parents not have respect for their parents watch how they talk to their parents watch how they do certain things Hallelujah but if you have respect you have fear your approaches will be different and how you see things will be different Hallelujah so in the house of God the Bible say blessed are those it's a blessing to approach him and to approach him you have you have fear you may have reverence if you reverence him then you approach him in the right manner but if you don't have no respect don't have no approach then your your attitude will be contrary to God's word hallelujah then lead to a disobedient spirit because of no respect and no respect lead to God God always allow those who approach him you don't approach God anyhow you might come with with reverence you might come Express with fear you might come expressing with dedication Hallelujah and when you come you might come expecting and what you expect is what you receive it's just a simple thing Hallelujah so it's how you approach God Is So relevant we don't approach God anyhow that when you coming to God's present come prepare come expecting come pray up you don't enter God's pres anyhow or you don't enter God's pres any way when you come into His pres you might know you are coming in the Pres of the great king so how you approaching how do you come a person that's why many people come to church and don't get nothing from God because they don't come with respect hallelujah amen so if you are coming to his presence you man to approach him and you may approach him respect hallelujah amen is what the Bible said the fear of the Lord is a beginning of wisdom because you fear God you get wisdom and wisdom lead to understanding wisdom will lead to how we do certain things in life Hallelujah because wisdom is the word of God Amen and the Bible said in the scripture in the book of Psalm 128:1 the Bible said blessed is everyone thou fearest the Lord and thou walk in his ways because when you fear Him you Reverend him you'll walk in his ways you walk according to God's word amen because you get out reever you get out fear if you don't respect him you don't walk in his word hallelujah you don't you don't take his advis you don't take his instruction but when you fear Him you walk in his ways you will take instruction and you will take advice in the house of God hallelujah the B say what blessed is everyone thou fear the lord and walk in his ways it said for thou shall eat the labor of thy hand so you fear God you eat the label of your hands you fear God how God will guide your life Hallelujah if you fear God and you you order your steps he said how shall thou be and a shall be well with thee Hallelujah they shall be well with the if you fear him if you love him you fear him if you love me keep my commandment if you fear him you know how to do certain things in your own life the Bible say to the scriptures the wife shall be as a fruitful van by the side of down house and th children shall be o plan and run about that table behold that thou shall the man be blessed blessed th fear the lord you see it B say thou shall be the portion of the man woman young boys young girls that fear of God Hallelujah remember the the god in the days of your youth Hallelujah and in your youthful age you might Rend God you may re the things of God and may fear him it's what the Bible say bless is a man whom the Lord chooses to approach him who the Lord chooses to come before his presence who the Lord chooses to enter his Gates is that is why the book of Psalm 100:3 said know ye the Lord he is God and it is he that made us not ourself we are his people and a sheep of what his pasture hallelujah amen enter in his gates with Thanksgiving and into his court with praises be thanks he be thanksful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good and his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generation Hallelujah so bless the man that the Lord chooses causes to approach him amen so they what and they when you when you respect him then you'll know how to approach him hallelujah amen so that is why God said bless the man that God chooses to approach him and now because it's not everyone that can approach him hallelujah it's only when God call you you can approach him that he may dwell in his court and be certified in what what his Temple so when you when when when when you when God call you you'll be satifying God's presence you'll be happy to be in the person of the king you'll rejoice in the person with with the King why David said I was glad when they said to me let go to the house of the Lord because God call and a bread in your heart that is why a true Christian a Believer when you respect him you don't D to church Hallelujah you don't come to church anyhow you can't prepare you can't pray up and you come expecting Hallelujah because that's is the prayer God bring the Mage come conduct all Uline how we conduct oursel in God's presence How We Gather 10 30 minutes of the time you might be on time in church we don't come our we don't choose our own way Hallelujah we must come God say Min the time we can't prepare we can't pray up we come expecting we don't come anyhow they see when we going to the job we on time when you come to God's pres be on time hallelujah oh yes be on time come pray or come prepare come praying and trusting God for your Christian Life hallelujah amen he said blessed is the man who the Lord chooses because not everybody go can call that you may dwell in your court and you might be stify in his Temple amen satify his Temple that is what Psalm psalm 16: 19 said in the court of the house in the court of the Lord house in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise ye the Lord and notice pray God told us the approach to God God has a way of an approach he say you know if you are going to visit the king there's an approach to the king Hallelujah that there is a way to approach he said well it make it it it may be more simple than that but a boy that want to approach a young lady to get acquainted with her there's a certain way he approach a young lady and my Approach that young lady will respect and reverence feel my reverence you my respect her to approach her you don't approach a young girl anyhow should you don't just say see some the street I you might approach certain way and take note even in the home there certain we approach our parents our mother a certain way we approach our dad Hallelujah certain way we approach our children amen so you can see that as a mod how you approach your children a different you approach your husand hallelujah oh yes sir and and the children they different you approach your mama different approach or that but everything is approach to a situation everything is approach to it so in God house there's approach of everything according to God's word amen oh yes sir that is why in dealing with dealing with the parents you don't talk to your parents anyhow when your parents talking to you you don't just walk out it will be a dis disobedient Spirit Hallelujah and to have long life obey your parents in the law for this is right and parents provoke children to anger hallelujah oh you want to you don't Prov no anger balance the word amen the same way children be obedient to parents respect the parents and when you respect your parents you know that when God is in your life it all bring respect in your life so you don't talk anyhow in the home amen because the home that is Godly you all have God's pres in that home hallelujah amen so always there's approach to things and you don't approach things anyhow so there a certain way to approach issues amen and when you have respect for a lady you approach her will respect Hallelujah you not approach her and you treat as a lady Hallelujah there is a way to approach all things and there is a way to approach God if we don't know the approach to God will never be able to get an audience with God the pray God said so if you don't approach him you not get audience for for him it's the same way as a child if you don't have to approach your parents they don't give you audience Hallelujah if you talking to your mama you know you talking to your mama you not to talk to your mama is Mama talking shout then they talking to them they go out and slam the door behind them it's on respectful Spirit hallelujah it's a sound that you don't have God a sound that you not yet born again if something your heart you don't just stamp your do your mama anyhow hallelujah oh yes sir amen amen and also also the same way as a wife you talk you don't talk to your husband anyhow oh I boss talk your husband with respect amen oh yes sir and also as a husband you talk to your wife with respect you might know that is a wife hallelujah oh yes sir amen so you can see that it's in the family Christ say and I show you a mystery Christ and his bride and God telling us that he said if you don't know the approach to God will never be able to get an audience with God so we have to know how to approach him in said in the house of God if you respect things in the church then you not to approach issue in the church hallelujah oh yes sir because Church the house of God is the heart of order the heart of God is how we approach issue in the church church we don't approach according to your feelings or your desire we approach according to God's word what God say about this because it will respect the word of God my Approach what the word of God says hallelujah oh yeah don't base upon your feelings or your ideas or upon your thought or how you feel or how you think we approach what God says because the word of God is our absolute am the word of God is our all in all Hallelujah because the word of God is our head I hope you understand me I hope I'm talking too fast hallelujah amen I'm okay BR okay there I get continue God bless you Sister I love that hallelujah oh yeah that fire rain Amen Let the Fire God bless everywhere Hallelujah and I love the amen hallelujah oh yes sir so you can see church that's is the word of God so you can see that that's it so you you think in the Church of God you don't come your own way or your own feelings and you want to project your thought then sometimes because many people don't respect when a pastor is preaching they take offense oh the preaching against me why should you preach who the minister to preach I preach to he Don't Preach to benches he preaching to people that is certain Hallelujah preaching the human beings preaching to the church it's what PR go say exp your thought to your pastor so if not going let your pastor know but you don't say oh and you do how no if you respect your pastor you always exp your thought to him oh man of God this this or pastor this this and will help to guide you because Jeremiah said I the Lord I gave you what pastor and when he gave you Pastor what to teach you knowledge and what understanding and H is what wisdom Hallelujah to guide you help you out to help you in Direction anything you are doing but sometime we don't have respect we don't approach things don't we don't discuss things we think we are AR Hallelujah we think we arri we think we know it all and it's that affecting our Christian Life that affecting our Christian walk Hallelujah so you can see that's a prayer God said if you don't have to approach into the situation you don't get audiences Hallelujah so if you if you respect they will go with a right approach on issues in our life Hallelujah as a young man listen listen to the voice of the message listen to the voice of your pastor listen to The Voice the in the church listen try to be obedient to God's word hallelujah and now the prayer of God said now there's a way to approach situation everything in his life there's a way to approach it Hallelujah he said you go to the court to approach the judge you don't just go into the joint say hi your majestry or yes you preach a jge anyhow he say you don't just walk up and say hi judge and just stand up he said they get some to throw you out of the court amen then a judge you might approach you say his hor and when he say his hor the judge have to recognize you but you can speak or they will pull you out of this conduct and will chunk you also then how much will the church how much will the house of God how much in our Christian life amen if just in this after life we we approach Jorge and and we don't just do anything and TR also because the way we approach the natural judge so also there a way we approach the Divine judge hallelujah amen is said when we we approach a Divine judge so we come to church we should know we are going to the The House of the king the Bible said what two or three are G in my name there are in the midst of them am know that God is here and God know your thoughts that is running through your mind thought sounded louder in the person of God than your voices Hallelujah so if you approaching come to church we should know come with obedience come with reverence come with respect hallelujah oh yeah sir because sometimes in the church some people address the pastor anyhow talk talk talk talk talk anyhow don't talk like that amen if you know you are talking or you talking to a brother in the church or you talking one in the church because if I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God so we don't address any us ourself anyhow want know who we are talking to know this my wife is a daughter of the king this my husband is a son of the king Hallelujah ljah oh yes sir when we are all children of God praise the Lord amen hallelujah so you can see church so that is it so we approaching issues you don't you my Approach your respect Hallelujah he said how how much more how we approach that Great Divine judge and know that said when men are falling from the Garden of Eden men always approach God when God created men there was Unity there were love how many com in God's person with Thanksgiving com in God's person with with praises Hallelujah and men were approaching god with reverence but when they fall came when men left his place when men left the word of God them men are left the path of righteousness men begin to lean to their own thought their own honesty in their own ways and that is why this add to approach God he want to come with a fake Lea Hallelujah because he makes the Revelation you come own hon a fake Le a own Doctrine Hallelujah so we don't come to God our own thought our own fake Le we might come according to his word and when Adam Come Away God rejected because it wasn't the word the word of God then God make a provided way that make approach him and how be through the blood Hallelujah to approach that great king you must come his provided way and church we have a PR way in the end time we have the message of the hour we have a message that tell us how to approach him in our marriage how we approach things in our homes how we approach things in our personal life hallelujah oh yes sir the message govern our life that's right amen say Church you are not American you're not African we are not this or that we are Christian our citizenship from what above we have our Constitution that govern our life and that is the God's word and we you approach it right Hallelujah we approach it right we approach the word of God with reverence with respect hallelujah amen so God G bring me back to his word and God provided way of approach Accord to God's god Set because men way were far from God hallelujah men way were far from God may become a stranger May begin leave God economy May to do many things and will also God's word hallelujah and the prayer of God said there is approach to God for many different things now if I want if you go to your father you approach your father in certain matter of Finance is it will be a different way how you approach another issue when a child going to a dad when a child approaching a dad Financial issue he approach it different Hallelujah when you're going to that oh no is me me material something or close all things them the approach will be different so you can see that every approach there is always different way to approach situations in our life hallelujah amen so you can see church so when men L that way men lost a way for approach to God when men are falling he lost the right approach to God go and church when you're not in God's word we are not born again and you don't get God in your life you always miss your approach to God's word that why always make sure Bible say You must be born again and when men left God's word men were obedient it wasn't men going after God anymore men was running from God it was God calling men to bring him into how to approach him Hallelujah because unbelief man left the word of God he went out and start started to do a own thing his own way of doing things but was God now running after men say bless God CA and chooses because so we are so many but it's not everybody on the face of the Earth can approach God that is what you can see in the church there are people in the church they don't listen they get with they will disobey God to do anything because not everybody in the CH believer Hallelujah is everybody CH believer some people get their own way their own feeling their own thought they to go about things they take portion word of God and reject portion of the word of God hallelujah when men left God disobedient now was God running after men it was God calling men to himself s hallelujah what Jesus said no man come to me said father draw him you cannot believe unless God call you and when God call you be obedient to his word when God call you you submit yourself to God's word when God call you you'll bring your B your B subjection when God call you you doubt to your thinking and your thoughts and your ideas and take what God says hallelujah you not say oh we know we can do me my my desire I can do my things this way or I can do my my way of doing things I can do it this way it's not this way that way it's What God Says About It hallelujah amen so you can see was God Hing down men was God running after men was God hunting men it wasn't me hunting God he said did ever think that men no men at any time or any any ages ever did within himself desire to serve God never been his nature his nature been against God's word that men always F the way to Hell F the thought to do certain things against God's word but if you love God say you love me keep my commandment and you'll be obedient to his word hallelujah amen I will approach to him that is why you can see look 21 verse 16 can imagine those were in the priest office but God said those can't approach me because so so so things in the Life imagine the Old Testament God can approach my auor because of see this effect this in their life which are Aon Sons if you 21: 16 where God said so you can see imagine so God get W approach and when God call you can approach him not call you can approach him amen although was songs but he's looking gen and Leviticus 21:16 the Bible said and the Lord speak to Moses saying Speak unto Aon saying whosoever is he that he that beat of the seed in their generation that had any blish let he not approach to the altar the bread of his God whosoever man he that be th blish he shall not approach a blind man or a limb or he that have a flat nose or anything superflu or a man that of a broken foot or what broken handed or a cro back or a dwarf or he that

come night unto the altar because he have blish then he profim not my cry for I the Lord has Sanctified him stifi them so you can see was the seed of but they could approach him because certain things in their life Hallelujah defect they couldn't approach him so you can see that God get everything how you approach him Hallelujah if you have defect in your life you get s in your life you get to approach it when you get issue get things on your sleeve you are doing things com to God's word you are made Behavior you come to you pretend but when you go out you live any life how do you approach

they can stand where God God say thank you Abraham my son you do well for me you know you wash my feet then church let me give a test because now you must know that that the same God that came down to Simeon house you know that Simon the FES the same came to S house the came to Abraham that the same God that came to S the F house and when I see God house what he did he receive him he keep Jesus in the corner when Abraham came to that to him because he should be the SE of Abraham when Abraham came to when God came to Abraham the first thing Abraham did Abraham take water to wash his feet as a service you think God don't look at his promises Hallelujah say that see yesterday today and forever hallelujah oh yes sir so we see that when when Abram ABR watch his feet when you go to Sim house Sim loc him you're making more of him because he to realize that was going B skin the same God Genesis 18 he came in B skin they same God came B skin son there and Sim don't know him take entertain strangers ENT own a way Hallelujah s said there look at him making Mo of Christ but I'm preacher what they unwelcome what Christ because he not respect Christ you pretend him in the S respect God so

important don't come to more better person we all God's children you might raise that thought hallelujah amen oh In The House of the king the king of King Hallelujah so you see why you see why when dispers him he reject him but what happened Church there was a Seed of Abraham there that woman that a woman that person you although body was def but Soul there was a seed so no matter who you are God call you God chooses you God bring you in hallelujah oh yes sir so no matter what ST in your life no matter what im to scar you put you in in the situation put you in that condition never come to the thought to Fe that you're not a child of God you're the child of the king hallelujah hallelujah never even discouraged and nothing you are somebody in God's kingdom Hallelujah em is that true say amen hallelujah hallelujah oh yes church we are somebody in God's kingdom we are we are the apple of Jehovah are one soul is worth 10,000 of this world so you are more important to God than anything so not come to you not nobody you are somebody hallelujah oh yes sir oh yes if that one could sit the saw him the how they rejected him how Simon desp him then she remember that see God came to Abraham but Abraham to wash his feet and she know that his feet was smelly his feet need attention his feet need a key and what she do she to show reverence and what a reverend she went she KNE down the same way Abram saw Abraham bow down when she went she Reverend with respect she KN her hold her feet and be to wash God open the Fountain of her eyes the tears and been to wash Jesus feet and she
