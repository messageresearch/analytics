[15:38] it happened you can sit down you can see
[15:41] it
[15:42] uh it happened at home over the week
[15:46] and uh there was somebody who was
[15:48] selling some items
[15:50] walking around the neighborhood so he
[15:52] came knocked out our door
[15:54] and uh he introduced himself
[15:57] he's a young man going to college and
[16:00] then uh
[16:01] i'll cut the story short because we had
[16:04] a testimony of almost three hours
[16:06] by the sidewalk just sharing about the
[16:09] lord
[16:10] so uh he told me excuse me it's from
[16:13] utah
[16:15] he goes to school there so i asked him
[16:18] how comes you come to minnesota from
[16:20] utah he said that's what he does over
[16:22] the summer
[16:22] break so i told him well i might
[16:26] buy your stuff but i need to be sure
[16:28] what you're selling and
[16:30] you know and then he told me well he
[16:32] sold it my neighbor i told him well i'll
[16:34] talk to my neighbor you can come back
[16:36] later
[16:36] so he came back later and then
[16:39] unfortunately i didn't talk to my
[16:41] neighbor he was not there
[16:42] so uh we started talking and i asked him
[16:45] about where you come from here
[16:46] utah oh okay and then told me but there
[16:49] i'm a mormon
[16:50] i said oh okay oh that's scared and then
[16:53] i told
[16:53] he asked me what i have met at the
[16:55] moment i say yeah there are some who
[16:56] came to my home
[16:58] and we have had discussions about the
[16:59] bible and we talked about
[17:01] baptism and then he said oh okay
[17:04] then things started rolling from there
[17:07] now yeah he asked him about the baptism
[17:09] of the holy ghost
[17:11] and what baptism means and then i asked
[17:13] him whether he was baptized he said yeah
[17:15] and i asked him do you know jesus said
[17:18] we about
[17:19] we should go he commanded the disciples
[17:21] go and
[17:22] baptize them in the name of the father
[17:24] son on holy ghost he said yeah
[17:26] but i asked him do you know that father
[17:28] is not a name that's right
[17:31] son is not a name then he said well
[17:35] he said but jesus commanded it then i
[17:37] told him yeah but i know he commanded
[17:39] but peter turned around and paul and
[17:40] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[17:43] so you we went from there then i asked
[17:46] him what do you think about that he said
[17:47] well i've heard about you
[17:49] but let me tell you my mind then i said
[17:51] yeah you have the right to tell me what
[17:52] you believe or what you know he said
[17:54] since childhood he has believed that uh
[17:57] just been taught is the name of the
[17:59] father son and holy ghost
[18:01] then i asked him uh what's your name
[18:04] he told me his name i don't want to say
[18:06] it because it's online
[18:08] and then asked him what's your dad's
[18:10] name he told me his dad's name
[18:12] so i asked him if i stand up
[18:15] during your graduation if i stand up and
[18:17] say oh daddy stand up for father's how
[18:19] many would stand up you said many
[18:21] then ask him if i say your dad's name
[18:23] how many will stand and say only one
[18:26] say huh okay yeah so i told him i asked
[18:28] him
[18:29] who do you think the father when jesus
[18:32] was saying go baptize in the name of the
[18:34] father son of hergers who's the father
[18:36] then uh then he asked me then who it is
[18:39] i said
[18:40] jesus christ say wow and that's why the
[18:45] apostles went and preached and baptized
[18:48] the name of jesus christ they did not
[18:50] make a mistake
[18:51] so he said okay so
[18:54] do you want me to leave all that i've
[18:57] been told since childhood and follow
[18:59] what you're telling me
[19:00] i told him no i want you to see what i'm
[19:03] telling you and compare with what you've
[19:04] been taught and see which one is the
[19:06] truth
[19:07] and i don't want you to give you or to
[19:10] give you
[19:11] my own mind i said wow say yeah
[19:15] i think you need to come to youth and
[19:17] talk to me and my parents i said yeah i
[19:19] can come there but i have a big family
[19:21] here i said well
[19:22] i'll ask my parents to host you i said
[19:24] well if you get a chance god willing
[19:27] i'll come so we kept on going like that
[19:30] and then uh he told me how he believes
[19:32] three goals they are
[19:33] separate and you know jesus is here holy
[19:36] ghost
[19:37] and the father is here and they are all
[19:39] three in one
[19:40] and uh but separate but you can see them
[19:43] one at the same time
[19:45] and god works out in a mysterious way
[19:47] because
[19:48] the time he was telling me that and then
[19:51] it was time to go pick up my daughter
[19:53] from work
[19:53] but i was late because i was talking my
[19:55] wife pulled up from the driveway
[19:57] and she left and then he told me
[20:01] uh it's just like you and your wife
[20:05] your uh the bible says when
[20:09] a man leaves his father and mother and
[20:11] joins his wife they become one
[20:13] he said oh okay so that's how it is with
[20:16] the holy ghost and father
[20:18] so i told him huh okay but did you know
[20:21] the bible says
[20:25] the bible says jesus christ when he was
[20:29] asked
[20:30] show us the father he said peter i've
[20:34] been with you this time
[20:36] all this time and you don't know me
[20:40] i and my father are one
[20:43] then he looked at me and said then i
[20:44] asked him huh
[20:47] if you see me you see the father that's
[20:49] what jesus christ said
[20:50] so i asked him huh look at me you are
[20:53] seeing me right
[20:54] yeah my wife just left are you seeing my
[20:56] wife
[20:59] i said no so i said told him you see
[21:02] jesus christ is god amen
[21:07] then we went on i told you to three
[21:08] hours testimony preach
[21:11] testifying about the lord he was telling
[21:12] me inside i was telling him my side
[21:14] and they were saying huh that's how he
[21:16] ended up and saying do you want me

[1:03:44] revelation chapter 17 that's where we
[1:03:47] spoke on
[1:03:47] wednesday night we want to take uh a
[1:03:51] verse yet again
[1:03:52] like i said this verse couldn't leave my
[1:03:54] mind
[1:03:56] uh all through the night it was almost
[1:04:00] like i was sleeping
[1:04:02] in a weekend i was trying to look for a
[1:04:05] certain
[1:04:05] information uh that i studied before
[1:04:08] uh i listened to it on tape and
[1:04:12] it was just like a flashback on my mind
[1:04:14] so i would wake up
[1:04:15] and then i would turn to this tape and
[1:04:17] play it and fall asleep
[1:04:18] and then wake up turn to another one and
[1:04:20] play it and you know all of that
[1:04:22] but i just pray that the lord will be
[1:04:24] able to to take something from yet and
[1:04:27] make it a blessing to us
[1:04:28] revelation chapter 17 praise the lord
[1:04:33] amen and uh
[1:04:43] revelation chapter 17
[1:04:47] we will now read the the entire
[1:04:50] uh chapter but we want to drop down here
[1:04:54] uh and take uh
[1:04:58] our primary verse here is going to be
[1:05:01] verse 12.
[1:05:04] our primary verse is going to be verse
[1:05:06] 12.
[1:05:14] praise the lord verse 12
[1:05:18] and the ten homes which they are
[1:05:21] revelation 17 verse 12
[1:05:25] are ten kings
[1:05:28] which have received no kingdom
[1:05:32] but receive power as kings
[1:05:36] one hour with the beast
[1:05:39] praise the lord the lord bless you let's
[1:05:41] see right there in revelation chapter
[1:05:44] 17.
[1:05:48] you may have your seed
[1:05:52] so on wednesday night we started this uh
[1:05:55] uh
[1:05:57] little talk on uh
[1:06:00] one hour with the beast and then we just
[1:06:02] look a few scriptures that spoke about
[1:06:04] one hour
[1:06:06] and uh and and just to go over that
[1:06:09] again
[1:06:09] it's not it's not our literal
[1:06:13] uh system meaning that make one hour
[1:06:17] no it's not your system meaning that
[1:06:19] make one hour
[1:06:20] like i was i was saying on uh talking
[1:06:23] about jesus asking his disciple why
[1:06:25] don't you pray with me one hour
[1:06:27] well you could take that literally in
[1:06:29] that sense but then when it comes over
[1:06:32] to this prophecy here in in uh
[1:06:35] in revelation just like the 11 hour
[1:06:38] worker
[1:06:39] you know the 11 hour worker speaks
[1:06:43] about the last hour before midnight
[1:06:47] that is the principle that is behind
[1:06:49] that scripture when jesus talked about
[1:06:51] the 11 hour worker
[1:06:52] is the last hour before midnight because
[1:06:55] when you get to 12 midnight
[1:06:57] you are already in another day
[1:07:01] so it speaks of uh uh
[1:07:04] the last you know the last uh uh
[1:07:07] the last age believer it speaks about
[1:07:10] you know what they are so that's the
[1:07:12] principle i want for us to keep in our
[1:07:14] mind
[1:07:14] so as we talk about this one hour with
[1:07:17] the beast
[1:07:18] we want for us to keep there in our mind
[1:07:22] and let's look at verse 8
[1:07:26] in that revelation chapter 17.
[1:07:32] let's look at verse 8.
[1:07:35] i mean it would just be good to read
[1:07:36] from verse 1 but
[1:07:41] i just want to use this to be able to
[1:07:44] drive our thought here the beast that
[1:07:46] thou saw with
[1:07:48] was in its net
[1:07:52] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[1:07:55] pit
[1:07:55] and go into petition and they that word
[1:07:59] on the earth shall wonder whose name
[1:08:02] was not written in the bulk of life from
[1:08:05] the foundation of the word
[1:08:06] when they behold the beast wish was
[1:08:10] and is not and yet is
[1:08:14] now what i want to grab your attention
[1:08:17] on
[1:08:17] is their statement the beast wish was
[1:08:21] and it's not and yet is
[1:08:28] praise the lord you know when i when i
[1:08:30] think about this statement i think about
[1:08:32] what jesus told neko demons
[1:08:35] he he says you know uh
[1:08:38] uh no man has seen you know the
[1:08:42] the son of man uh he's his wishes
[1:08:45] which is uh uh uh noun in heaven that's
[1:08:48] the way he said it
[1:08:50] in uh us in john chapter three
[1:08:54] but if you just think about it
[1:08:57] it is kind of for showing
[1:09:00] uh there is just there is just a lot of
[1:09:03] language to this
[1:09:04] the beast which was and
[1:09:07] it's not and yet is
[1:09:11] so keep that at the back of your mind
[1:09:14] while we
[1:09:15] study this subject together and
[1:09:19] talking about uh
[1:09:23] one hour with the beast my inspiration
[1:09:26] this morning
[1:09:27] is getting authority from the wrong
[1:09:32] influence
[1:09:36] getting authority getting power from the
[1:09:39] wrong
[1:09:40] influence praise the lord
[1:09:44] that's what i want for us to watch as we
[1:09:46] will follow uh
[1:09:48] the the the scriptures that we will be
[1:09:50] looking at
[1:09:52] uh this morning let's let's study
[1:09:55] together
[1:09:56] a little bit and then
[1:09:59] now remember that when we when we spoke
[1:10:02] on wednesday night
[1:10:04] we we brought ourselves to
[1:10:09] these kings
[1:10:12] that receive power
[1:10:15] but they had no kingdom
[1:10:19] okay and we said that they were
[1:10:21] detectors
[1:10:24] praise the lord because to be
[1:10:28] a king you must have a kingdom
[1:10:33] praise the lord but they got their
[1:10:36] kingship
[1:10:40] by getting an influence from the beast
[1:10:44] by spending time with the beast system
[1:10:47] they got their king shape but they did
[1:10:50] not have no kidding
[1:10:53] so what happened here is that it's so
[1:10:56] easy for
[1:10:58] uh uh the system to now
[1:11:03] send them to different regions you can
[1:11:05] go and take over this place you know
[1:11:07] and and and be the the you know and
[1:11:10] remove one passage and put another
[1:11:12] pastor
[1:11:12] in remove one you know and just like
[1:11:15] that this
[1:11:16] this whole thing we are we are starting
[1:11:18] with it works both politically
[1:11:20] and also religiously
[1:11:26] so as we look at the beast which was
[1:11:29] and it's not and yet is is
[1:11:33] a system that started politically
[1:11:36] but now become a religious power
[1:11:41] so just follow me in a little bit now we
[1:11:43] said
[1:11:44] that uh when jacob
[1:11:47] was blessing his sons
[1:11:52] he blessed judah and said judah out of
[1:11:54] your limbs would come the king
[1:11:58] judah was given the blessing of kingship
[1:12:02] are we together amen
[1:12:06] so we realized that
[1:12:09] uh just like we we talked judah
[1:12:12] experienced with tema
[1:12:15] and and because of that there was no
[1:12:18] king that rose up in israel until
[1:12:22] after 10th generation
[1:12:26] praise the lord until after
[1:12:30] 10th generation and as we study there in
[1:12:33] time past
[1:12:34] we realized the tenth from judah
[1:12:37] was david are we together
[1:12:40] that's just a review because we did that
[1:12:42] uh not too long
[1:12:44] the tenth from because it was a calling
[1:12:48] to the lord of god those
[1:12:50] abominable as judah went with his own
[1:12:52] daughter-in-law
[1:12:54] those abominable arts were kept away
[1:12:56] from the congregation from ten
[1:12:58] generations so god
[1:13:00] denied gave israel a king
[1:13:04] until after 10th generation
[1:13:07] now so but before that
[1:13:11] king will come on the scene
[1:13:15] we see the quest of the people the
[1:13:17] requests of the people wanting to be a
[1:13:19] king
[1:13:20] not because they wanted god's order or
[1:13:23] they wanted
[1:13:24] god's word but because they wanted to be
[1:13:27] like
[1:13:27] other nations
[1:13:32] amen they were not desiring they were
[1:13:34] not crying for a deliverer
[1:13:36] like when they were in egypt crying for
[1:13:39] the deliverer all god sent us a
[1:13:41] deliverer
[1:13:42] and god sent them moses
[1:13:45] but this time the cry was to be like
[1:13:48] other nations praise the lord
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:56] let's be you see this other church this
[1:13:58] is the way to do it let's do it like
[1:13:59] that and
[1:14:00] this other church this is the way to do
[1:14:02] it and at the end of faith
[1:14:03] you get something that is completely
[1:14:06] different
[1:14:10] now so when that happened
[1:14:14] what i want for us to watch now let's go
[1:14:16] in the book of first kings
[1:14:19] let's go in the book of first king i'm
[1:14:21] first samuel sorry
[1:14:23] i'm really really trusting that the lord
[1:14:27] will be able
[1:14:28] to help us amen help
[1:14:31] us i'm i'm a little bit nervous on the
[1:14:34] subject
[1:14:36] not because
[1:14:40] it's just because the other
[1:14:43] these are the kind of a subject that is
[1:14:45] so easy to go down the rabbit trail
[1:14:50] you get on one thing and then you start
[1:14:51] going and then you you
[1:14:53] just miss your inspiration now first
[1:14:56] samuel chapter nine
[1:14:58] first samuel chapter nine will bring us
[1:15:00] to the place where
[1:15:02] samir cried before the lord in in
[1:15:06] uh uh
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:12] first samuel chapter 8 the last verse
[1:15:14] verse 22 and the lord said unto samuel
[1:15:17] yaking unto the voice of the people
[1:15:20] and make them a king and samuel said
[1:15:23] unto the men of israel go ye
[1:15:25] every man onto your city now samuel when
[1:15:28] the people came to summit and said they
[1:15:30] wanted a king
[1:15:33] samia asks them have had done anything
[1:15:35] wrong because at the time they were on
[1:15:37] under the leadership of a prophet so
[1:15:40] right in the ministry of samuel there
[1:15:42] was both
[1:15:43] prophet king and priests
[1:15:47] praise the lord now but they wanted
[1:15:50] a king a man that is dead as a king to
[1:15:53] be like
[1:15:53] other nations so samir you know pleaded
[1:15:56] with the people but god told him
[1:15:58] samuel you are not the one that they are
[1:16:00] rejecting they are rejecting me they are
[1:16:02] rejecting my leadership
[1:16:05] let's bring it back to the gospel
[1:16:08] jesus said why call me lord lord
[1:16:11] and do it not my commandments
[1:16:15] praise the lord so it's it's it is at
[1:16:18] this place
[1:16:20] where he is both king and lord
[1:16:24] so as we said on wednesday night
[1:16:28] our kingship is submissiveness to the
[1:16:32] word of god
[1:16:35] amen this is not all about a church
[1:16:39] organization but this is a spiritual
[1:16:41] kingdom
[1:16:43] that we have been called to amen
[1:16:47] and our king is the lord jesus
[1:16:52] that is dealing with us in the form of
[1:16:54] his word
[1:16:57] praise the lord so
[1:17:00] to reject the king that the subject of
[1:17:03] the rejected king
[1:17:04] is rejecting the leadership of god
[1:17:08] in your life either rejecting or
[1:17:11] rebelling against it
[1:17:15] so let's travel a little bit now as we
[1:17:18] as we just want to
[1:17:19] uh uh uh establish our thought here now
[1:17:22] so
[1:17:23] yeah god now told samuel go and give
[1:17:25] them a king if that's what they want
[1:17:27] you go and give them a king so samuel
[1:17:30] went out god already gave him a vision
[1:17:33] because he was a prophet
[1:17:35] and uh he saw that uh uh
[1:17:38] kish saul's father has lost his eyes and
[1:17:42] and and then someone knew exactly where
[1:17:45] it was
[1:17:45] but let's go down a little bit because
[1:17:47] that might give us a too much
[1:17:49] of a reading
[1:17:58] let's drop to verse
[1:18:02] 18.
[1:18:09] verse 17 and when samuel
[1:18:12] saul saw the law said unto him behold
[1:18:15] the man whom
[1:18:16] as i speak to thee of
[1:18:20] this same shall reign over my people
[1:18:24] praise the lord then samuel
[1:18:28] then saw drew night onto samuel in the
[1:18:30] gate and said tell me
[1:18:32] i pray thee where the word is
[1:18:35] the the see your house is now someone
[1:18:38] advised
[1:18:39] saul to go and find the seer which is
[1:18:41] the prophet
[1:18:42] that's what the uh a prophet was a seer
[1:18:46] now he was going to the seer to get get
[1:18:48] an advise
[1:18:50] to find his father lost animal
[1:18:54] now take it in the context now of
[1:18:57] leadership
[1:18:58] take it in the context we are the sheep
[1:19:01] of his pasture amen
[1:19:05] we are the sheep of his posture that's
[1:19:08] what we need
[1:19:09] to be led sons of god are led by the
[1:19:13] spirit of god
[1:19:14] that's what the bible says but see the
[1:19:17] scene that god
[1:19:18] said god allowed the one that was going
[1:19:23] to be the leader now the one that was
[1:19:25] going to be
[1:19:26] placed as a king for his father
[1:19:29] animal to be lost so
[1:19:33] uh i saw father anima was representing
[1:19:38] israel in the lost form because now they
[1:19:42] are streeting away from god's principle
[1:19:45] the father asked the father sheep
[1:19:48] amen and now saul
[1:19:51] is going to be ordained as captain so
[1:19:55] the ability of going to redeem
[1:19:58] or going to find this lost sheep
[1:20:02] are we together amen so
[1:20:05] god in his great mind
[1:20:08] set a scene
[1:20:12] amen he said a scene yes
[1:20:15] i saw you trying to be a good boy
[1:20:18] and he's looking for his father's sheep
[1:20:21] now because you're going to see the
[1:20:22] difference between
[1:20:24] saul and david because that was the same
[1:20:27] condition
[1:20:28] that david was in trying to protect his
[1:20:31] fathership
[1:20:34] are we together are you seeing the
[1:20:36] comparison
[1:20:38] because god is bringing a man into
[1:20:41] leadership
[1:20:42] but yet he's using a natural scene to
[1:20:45] prepare
[1:20:46] that man the man is driving
[1:20:49] into that natural scene but there is a
[1:20:52] supernatural thing
[1:20:54] that is happening behind are we together
[1:20:59] amen so saul goes about
[1:21:02] looking for his father's sheep and
[1:21:04] someone said oh the seer is
[1:21:06] up there now he's going to the prophet
[1:21:11] are we together now
[1:21:14] when he when he got to the prophet as we
[1:21:16] read down here
[1:21:18] uh uh okay verse 19 and samuel
[1:21:23] saul and god already spoke to simon yes
[1:21:26] the man there
[1:21:27] praise the lord yes the man the same
[1:21:29] thing happened in jesse's house
[1:21:32] he tried to go there not the first one
[1:21:34] god said no the second one when david
[1:21:36] king god said this is the man
[1:21:39] yeah god is revealing to samuel that's
[1:21:41] the man
[1:21:42] i told you about the people want a king
[1:21:46] that's the man i told you about are we
[1:21:48] together
[1:21:49] so let's let's just stay together now i
[1:21:52] don't want to lose you
[1:21:54] because i'm beginning to feel the
[1:21:55] connection
[1:21:58] amen and samuel answered saul and said
[1:22:02] i am the seer go up before me
[1:22:05] unto the high place for years shall eat
[1:22:08] with me today
[1:22:10] and tomorrow i will let you go so samia
[1:22:12] is going
[1:22:13] to keep him in his presence what are we
[1:22:17] talking about
[1:22:18] one hour with the beast
[1:22:23] it's a time spain with the beast
[1:22:27] so samya is going to keep him
[1:22:30] all through the night till the next
[1:22:32] morning
[1:22:34] are we together and that time spent with
[1:22:37] the prophet
[1:22:38] is going to change his life
[1:22:50] you eat with me today and tomorrow i
[1:22:51] will let you go
[1:22:53] and uh and will tell thee
[1:22:56] all that is in thine heart
[1:23:01] the ministry of a prophet i will tell
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:04] everything that is in your heart
[1:23:08] amen when he goes he goes to me
[1:23:12] samia he's uh uh uh
[1:23:18] you know he want to see samia to to
[1:23:21] inquire of samuel but even before he
[1:23:24] said what he want to see the prophet for
[1:23:27] the prophet is telling him
[1:23:28] i will tell you everything that is
[1:23:31] in your heart
[1:23:35] so he did not even ask the prophet the
[1:23:37] prophet is descending him right there
[1:23:40] are we together and as for the
[1:23:43] eyes that were lost three days
[1:23:48] how would the prophet know except god
[1:23:49] had revealed it to him
[1:23:53] are we together and as for the night
[1:23:56] that is lost three days ago
[1:23:59] set not the mind on them for they are
[1:24:02] fun
[1:24:05] praise the lord now you have to realize
[1:24:08] you go back to the beginning
[1:24:10] of first samuel before samya came on the
[1:24:13] scene
[1:24:14] there was no open vision
[1:24:17] which means god was not dealing with no
[1:24:20] man
[1:24:20] like the way he's dealing with samuel
[1:24:22] here right now
[1:24:24] this is an open vision the prophet
[1:24:27] looking right at you and he's telling
[1:24:29] you what is
[1:24:29] in your heart
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:34] and we have that same word in our midst
[1:24:38] the word of god discern the intent of
[1:24:40] the heart
[1:24:43] praise the lord are we together amen
[1:24:47] now so the prophet tell him all of this
[1:24:52] you know uh even the sheep that you come
[1:24:55] running for
[1:24:56] that was lost three days ago don't
[1:24:57] bother they have already found it
[1:25:01] and he says and on whom is the desire of
[1:25:05] israel the desire of israel which means
[1:25:09] what the people have been crying about
[1:25:11] we want a king it's in
[1:25:12] every house people are talking about it
[1:25:14] we want a king all the nation has king
[1:25:16] our church is not like this oh we want a
[1:25:18] king
[1:25:23] is it not on thee
[1:25:26] and on their father's house
[1:25:29] and saw answer and said
[1:25:33] i'm not a benjamite
[1:25:37] now so what is this where is the
[1:25:39] contention there where where is the
[1:25:41] subject of talk
[1:25:42] they are wanting a king is he he's
[1:25:44] telling he's telling saul
[1:25:47] you are the desire of the people the
[1:25:48] people are looking for king
[1:25:50] you are you are the desire but saul
[1:25:54] being and a trained jewish boy
[1:25:57] in the world knew that a king must come
[1:26:00] from the trap of judah
[1:26:01] and not from the tribe of benjamin
[1:26:06] so now he said wow he stepped back a
[1:26:09] little bit and said wow
[1:26:10] am i not a benjamite
[1:26:16] according to the law if we should get a
[1:26:19] king you must come from the house of
[1:26:20] judah
[1:26:23] so saul immediately
[1:26:27] knew there was something his
[1:26:30] his inner conscience knew that
[1:26:34] he was out of place for this office
[1:26:39] but one hour with an authority
[1:26:44] can influence your life even if you are
[1:26:47] not called to do that work
[1:26:53] are we together
[1:27:01] now so saul said i'm
[1:27:04] i'm not out of benji might
[1:27:08] okay that's that's our inspiration then
[1:27:10] let's let's go further now
[1:27:12] first samuel chapter 10. first samuel
[1:27:18] chapter 10
[1:27:20] and that we just we just want to we want
[1:27:22] to go
[1:27:23] very quickly yeah and
[1:27:26] you can you can re read the rest of the
[1:27:29] story
[1:27:30] praise the lord amen
[1:27:40] and as you as you also you will also
[1:27:43] realize this as you study now
[1:27:47] i'm giving you some homework here
[1:27:51] when when
[1:27:54] saul annoyed samir
[1:27:59] he anointed samuel
[1:28:02] no when samuel anointed saul
[1:28:06] praise the lord
[1:28:09] i could feel the correction in your
[1:28:12] spirit
[1:28:14] praise the lord when samia
[1:28:18] anointed saul uh
[1:28:23] i'm trying to
[1:28:29] i'm trying to find a place here but
[1:28:32] you'll find it right here in chapter 10
[1:28:34] he took he took a vow and he
[1:28:37] he poured the oil on uh
[1:28:41] on saul and he says
[1:28:44] i have anointed you captain
[1:28:47] over israel
[1:28:50] when he anointed david he took a horn
[1:28:56] and he annoyed david
[1:29:00] two different
[1:29:04] two different type of anointing
[1:29:08] are we together but this is what i want
[1:29:12] to bring you in this uh
[1:29:13] in this chapter 10. i want i want you to
[1:29:16] see something here
[1:29:21] in chapter 10
[1:29:34] chapter 10 verse 1 that's where some
[1:29:37] you're annoyed
[1:29:39] so then when you go
[1:29:42] down the scripture says
[1:29:47] verse 10 and when they came
[1:29:51] here to the hell behold a company of
[1:29:53] prophets met him
[1:29:54] and the spirit of god came upon him who
[1:29:58] saw and he prophesied
[1:30:01] among them
[1:30:06] praise the lord and it came to pass when
[1:30:09] all that knew him before
[1:30:12] time saw that they even
[1:30:16] wondered behold
[1:30:19] he prophesied among the prophets
[1:30:22] then the same went out
[1:30:26] people said wow all that knew him before
[1:30:30] time when he saw him
[1:30:35] no in a sense that they never knew him
[1:30:37] to be among the prophets
[1:30:41] they never knew him to be hauling a
[1:30:43] religious office but yara said now
[1:30:46] he has an anointing on him he's
[1:30:48] prophesying with the prophets
[1:30:53] are we together
[1:30:57] the spirit of god came upon him he
[1:30:59] prophesied among them and it came to
[1:31:01] pass
[1:31:02] all i knew him before he prophesied
[1:31:04] among the prophet then the people said
[1:31:06] one to another
[1:31:07] what is this that is come
[1:31:11] unto the son of kish it saw also
[1:31:14] among the prophets now let's drop down a
[1:31:17] little bit
[1:31:20] the proverb you know it became now a
[1:31:22] proverb among the people wow it saw now
[1:31:25] also among the prophets
[1:31:26] wow you know a benjamin wow
[1:31:29] i thought it was supposed to be you know
[1:31:31] levites and uh you know uh
[1:31:33] from the tribal judah or all of that you
[1:31:35] know it started becoming
[1:31:37] a saying
[1:31:41] gossip did not start it now it started
[1:31:43] ever since
[1:31:47] praise the lord now
[1:31:50] watch this also that i want to bring you
[1:31:52] to this place
[1:31:55] verse 14 when saw uncle
[1:31:59] said unto him into his seven well let's
[1:32:02] go
[1:32:03] uh to seek the ass and and when this
[1:32:06] and when and when we saw that their
[1:32:12] were nowhere we came to samyam
[1:32:15] and and saw onku verse 15 said
[1:32:19] tell me now he's talking to saul so
[1:32:21] uncle is talking to saul
[1:32:23] i pray what samir
[1:32:26] said unto you now watch this principle
[1:32:29] very kingly
[1:32:32] and saul said unto his uncle he told me
[1:32:36] he told us plainly that their ashes were
[1:32:40] found
[1:32:41] but of the matter of the kingdom
[1:32:45] where of samuel speak he told him that
[1:32:51] so you realize that
[1:32:54] so it's not he's not having conviction
[1:33:02] he's not having conviction
[1:33:06] samia told him
[1:33:09] are you not a desire of ezra he said
[1:33:13] am i not a benji might
[1:33:18] verse 10 i mean chapter 10 verse 1
[1:33:21] the bible says samuel
[1:33:25] then samuel took the vial of oil and
[1:33:28] poured it upon his head
[1:33:29] kissed him and said unto him
[1:33:32] is it not because the lord have anointed
[1:33:35] thee to be
[1:33:36] captain over his inheritance so he was
[1:33:39] anointed
[1:33:41] he got among the prophets he prophesied
[1:33:45] but yet he's not convicted
[1:33:53] his uncle wow you were with you were
[1:33:55] with the seer you're with the prophet
[1:33:56] what did he say
[1:33:58] oh you know he told me that the ship was
[1:34:00] lost three days ago
[1:34:02] and where i would find it he told me
[1:34:04] everything about it
[1:34:07] but the main thing that the prophet met
[1:34:09] him for
[1:34:10] he never said anything why because
[1:34:14] there was not an inner conviction
[1:34:25] there was not an inner
[1:34:30] conviction
[1:34:34] there was not a birth
[1:34:39] no one is is it's hard for people to
[1:34:42] testify
[1:34:43] of their christian faith when there is
[1:34:45] not a birth
[1:34:50] we can talk about the church is
[1:34:52] completely different
[1:34:54] than to talk about our experience
[1:35:04] but he prophesied
[1:35:08] he was even anointed
[1:35:15] but from the very first question am i
[1:35:18] not a benjamite
[1:35:20] shows that there was something haunting
[1:35:26] saw
[1:35:29] in his inner in his inner man in his
[1:35:32] inner
[1:35:33] most part of his being
[1:35:38] but one hour with the beast now you have
[1:35:40] to realize that
[1:35:42] biblical sample as a symbol this means
[1:35:46] power
[1:35:48] okay
[1:35:52] when moses spent a time in the burning
[1:35:54] bush
[1:35:55] it changed his life
[1:36:00] just that little time he spent in the
[1:36:02] burning bush
[1:36:03] it means that it's a time of focus
[1:36:09] the time that has grabbed your attention
[1:36:13] can you imagine saul thinking in
[1:36:16] all of his mind the prophet said spend
[1:36:19] the night with me
[1:36:21] can you imagine he never slept
[1:36:26] i came right in front of this man he
[1:36:28] told me my father name
[1:36:30] he told me the day that the sheep was
[1:36:31] lost oh my goodness
[1:36:35] will you be able to have a good sleep
[1:36:37] before a man that knows all your life
[1:36:41] so laying down there oh my goodness what
[1:36:43] a privilege
[1:36:44] i ate with a prophet i eat with the
[1:36:48] prophet i slept with him
[1:36:52] he's building his resume
[1:36:57] he has enough to build his resume to
[1:37:00] prove that
[1:37:04] i mean the message
[1:37:07] you know you you have you are yes you
[1:37:09] can tell me say you saw
[1:37:11] have you slept with the prophet
[1:37:14] you slept with him and i mean he could
[1:37:18] build a lot of story because nobody was
[1:37:20] there where he
[1:37:20] and the prophet
[1:37:23] he could he could function his own thing
[1:37:25] everybody would be leaving
[1:37:31] and the prophet told me this and the
[1:37:33] prophet told me that and the prophet
[1:37:34] said this to me
[1:37:40] i hope you see where i'm going with this
[1:37:43] praise the lord
[1:37:46] i hope you see where i'm going with this
[1:37:50] amen just
[1:37:54] one hour with the beast these men became
[1:37:58] king
[1:37:58] but yet they had no kidding
[1:38:04] i will come back to that there are some
[1:38:07] there are some historical
[1:38:08] uh uh
[1:38:12] things we would like to look at in this
[1:38:15] in their life
[1:38:18] but this is just to be able to establish
[1:38:20] our thought
[1:38:21] getting influence i mean getting
[1:38:24] authority from the wrong
[1:38:25] influence just by association
[1:38:32] just by associating
[1:38:36] praise the lord we have to realize now
[1:38:39] relationship chapter 17
[1:38:42] is a continuation let me let me help you
[1:38:45] to be help us to be able to look at
[1:38:49] uh uh uh the the whole subject here
[1:38:53] in revelation revelation chapter 12.
[1:38:55] let's go there a little bit
[1:39:07] and what we want to achieve here is
[1:39:10] you know is to be able
[1:39:13] to bring all our experience back to the
[1:39:15] word of god
[1:39:17] amen not just to fall in a sensation oh
[1:39:22] i tremble oh yeah at that meeting i
[1:39:24] cried oh yeah no
[1:39:25] bring it right back to the world
[1:39:29] bring all your experience back to the
[1:39:31] world because
[1:39:32] if it is not aligning with the word you
[1:39:34] are influenced
[1:39:39] by the wrong spirit
[1:39:47] if you have a haunting question bring it
[1:39:50] to the word
[1:39:54] the same one i told samir how long
[1:39:58] his father's sheep was lost that same
[1:40:00] one can tell you
[1:40:01] when did that thing started
[1:40:11] you know the christian church under the
[1:40:13] dispensation of grace we are saved by
[1:40:15] grace
[1:40:16] that that has become a slogan of the
[1:40:18] church
[1:40:20] but i wish the think that everything
[1:40:22] goes because god grace has saved us
[1:40:25] we can do whatever we want to do
[1:40:28] well i was saved by grace
[1:40:32] there is no weapon form against me will
[1:40:34] prosper
[1:40:36] you know when people start finding those
[1:40:38] defensive uh
[1:40:40] uh uh quotation of the bible it
[1:40:43] always shows there is something they are
[1:40:45] struggling over
[1:40:50] because it is not how much you cut god's
[1:40:52] word
[1:40:53] that made god to back his word god is
[1:40:56] already obligated to his word
[1:41:04] are we together
[1:41:09] now so in in scripture here
[1:41:13] you realize that in the book of
[1:41:16] revelation there
[1:41:17] there are three women that the bible
[1:41:19] talks about
[1:41:20] three women but one
[1:41:27] appears in revelation chapter 12.
[1:41:31] that's that's this woman great the bible
[1:41:34] says she was a great woman
[1:41:37] also and she had uh
[1:41:40] uh the son
[1:41:44] let's read our revelation chapter 2
[1:41:46] verse 1 and that appeared
[1:41:47] a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed
[1:41:50] with the sun
[1:41:51] and the moon under her feet and she's uh
[1:41:54] and upon her head
[1:41:55] where towards ties we know that this
[1:41:58] will go back to the jewish church
[1:42:02] she will go back to the jewish church
[1:42:04] she could
[1:42:05] also type the gentile church but there
[1:42:07] is there is a lot of jewish element in
[1:42:09] him
[1:42:10] now and then in revelation chapter 17 it
[1:42:13] talks
[1:42:14] about another mystery woman mr babylon
[1:42:18] two great woman but there is a woman
[1:42:21] that was talked about
[1:42:22] earlier in revelation chapter one
[1:42:29] the one that had her pipes given
[1:42:34] the bride suffers in revelation chapter
[1:42:37] 1
[1:42:39] honor the identification of christ
[1:42:41] because when john
[1:42:42] looked back he saw one in the midst
[1:42:46] of the church one in the midst of the
[1:42:48] seven golden candlestick
[1:42:51] but that very same one that he saw
[1:42:55] which was christ he also had
[1:42:58] a female representation
[1:43:04] because the one in the midst of the
[1:43:06] seven golden candlestick
[1:43:08] was gathered around the pipes
[1:43:13] so it was christ in bright form
[1:43:18] because god has kept he has kept that
[1:43:21] right from the beginning
[1:43:23] genesis 1 26 god made man in his
[1:43:27] image male and female
[1:43:32] he made man in his image
[1:43:35] but there was two representation of that
[1:43:37] one image
[1:43:39] male and female
[1:43:42] are we together
[1:43:47] praise the lord am i bringing too much
[1:43:48] information
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:54] well if you uh looking for the
[1:43:57] prosperity gospel i think this is one of
[1:43:59] the best one
[1:44:02] amen we're not talking about money we're
[1:44:05] talking about how you can prosper in
[1:44:06] your walk with god
[1:44:09] by watching out from being under the
[1:44:10] wrong influence
[1:44:14] praise the lord amen
[1:44:18] so as as we watch this together now
[1:44:20] let's go now this this
[1:44:22] spoke about here in revelation and then
[1:44:24] revelation chapter
[1:44:26] 12 as we read about this great woman she
[1:44:28] was with chai
[1:44:29] which means she was uh she was pregnant
[1:44:31] she was about to give birth
[1:44:33] and there was a dragon a red dragon that
[1:44:36] wanted to
[1:44:37] to devote her child uh uh you know
[1:44:40] uh and and out of there
[1:44:43] so as the scripture goes on
[1:44:47] it brings us to verse nine and the great
[1:44:51] dragon
[1:44:52] was cast out that all
[1:44:55] sapping called the devil
[1:44:59] and satan one person
[1:45:04] one person he was that all stepping
[1:45:09] we can trace him back to genesis chapter
[1:45:11] three
[1:45:13] that all second called the devil
[1:45:18] sit on which deceiveth the whole world
[1:45:23] now so we identified
[1:45:26] uh we identified
[1:45:30] the great the the great dragon here are
[1:45:33] we together
[1:45:35] so identifying the great dragon
[1:45:44] there is a place i want to get to here
[1:45:57] so we identified the great dragon just
[1:46:00] bear with me in a little bit here
[1:46:03] because what what i want to catch here
[1:46:06] or i want to
[1:46:07] i want to take up with you here is that
[1:46:10] right from revelation
[1:46:12] 13 is announced has to deal
[1:46:15] with the beast system now
[1:46:18] god starts to show the best system that
[1:46:21] was once
[1:46:22] revealed to daniel in the book of daniel
[1:46:25] we won't have all the time to go after
[1:46:27] the scripture but
[1:46:28] you will realize from from from
[1:46:30] revelation chapter 13
[1:46:37] he starts to show the beast system and
[1:46:40] it runs
[1:46:41] over to revelation chapter 14.
[1:46:45] it goes he there with it a little bit on
[1:46:48] a revelation chapter 15.
[1:46:51] revelation chapter 16 speaks about the
[1:46:54] vowels
[1:46:55] revelation chapter 17 until revelation
[1:46:58] chapter 18.
[1:47:00] so right from there you will see little
[1:47:02] by little he's talking about
[1:47:04] how he's going to deal with this beast
[1:47:06] system
[1:47:09] now you you will get the picture when we
[1:47:13] we uh we go back to the beginning let's
[1:47:16] let's read this
[1:47:17] let me let me help myself here a little
[1:47:20] bit let me let me release myself a
[1:47:22] little bit
[1:47:22] by just reading some few quotes to you
[1:47:26] are we together are we together
[1:47:32] let's read uh uh wow why am i holy ruler
[1:47:37] now in genesis
[1:47:41] genesis was the sea chapter where all
[1:47:45] the seas
[1:47:46] were sown everything
[1:47:50] that you find in the world today
[1:47:53] came out of genesis
[1:47:56] actually that's what the word genesis
[1:47:58] means the beginning
[1:47:59] the seed are we together
[1:48:03] everything begins back there in the
[1:48:05] beginning
[1:48:06] well now it's just like so in a crop
[1:48:10] now if you watch what kind of a seed you
[1:48:14] got
[1:48:14] you got in no matter what it looks like
[1:48:20] when is this high you will have to see
[1:48:23] what it is once the seed
[1:48:27] you will see it will be
[1:48:30] when he come to see
[1:48:34] praise the lord amen
[1:48:37] and jesus i mean paul says
[1:48:41] be now deceived god is not one
[1:48:45] whatsoever a man soweth that he would
[1:48:49] reap
[1:48:52] is a general principle of life
[1:48:57] everything that we do
[1:49:00] we are either planting seeds or we are
[1:49:04] reaping
[1:49:04] one
[1:49:09] whatever we do is a general
[1:49:12] principle of life we are either planting
[1:49:16] seeds
[1:49:17] or we are in the process of the growth
[1:49:20] of a seed that we have planted
[1:49:22] or we are at the harvest
[1:49:29] are we together it's a general principle
[1:49:33] of life we have to
[1:49:35] you we have to watch that
[1:49:40] jesus said whatever other word we speak
[1:49:45] it will come to fruit
[1:49:50] whatever thought we think in our mind
[1:49:55] we come to fruit by our actions
[1:50:03] praise the lord
[1:50:08] are we together
[1:50:12] the bible says children obey your
[1:50:14] parents
[1:50:16] for this is the the word of god and also
[1:50:19] it's a commandment
[1:50:20] with promise what does that mean it's a
[1:50:24] commandment
[1:50:25] that has a seed principle in it
[1:50:30] it has a seed principle in it
[1:50:40] praise the lord
[1:50:45] because if we get in rebellion to our
[1:50:48] our parents
[1:50:49] what you're doing is that you are sowing
[1:50:51] seed to reap when you start having
[1:50:52] children
[1:51:02] genesis 1 11 every seed will bring forth
[1:51:06] of eight kinds are we together
[1:51:17] so genesis is the c chapter let's go
[1:51:19] down again
[1:51:20] and take another one trying to do god
[1:51:23] service without his will the beast
[1:51:27] from the beginning
[1:51:30] he was the beast at the garden
[1:51:33] of eden amen now so we see here
[1:51:37] revelation 12 identified him that great
[1:51:40] dragon
[1:51:41] that was cast out that was cast
[1:51:44] out would take also uh isaiah chapter
[1:51:48] 14 where he was cast out of heaven
[1:51:53] and before he was cast out of heaven to
[1:51:55] be there to be
[1:51:56] the old serpent he was first called
[1:52:00] lucifer
[1:52:02] was cast out that oh serpent
[1:52:05] called the devil satan now so we see
[1:52:09] here he was the beast from the beginning
[1:52:11] wish
[1:52:12] was the beast at the garden of eden
[1:52:15] yeah he's the beast at the end
[1:52:19] he that was
[1:52:22] that's what the scripture says the beast
[1:52:24] that was
[1:52:26] and it's not and yet it is it's the same
[1:52:30] beast just
[1:52:31] changing system changing nation
[1:52:35] the same spirit that kept israel in
[1:52:38] captivity
[1:52:39] for the same reason in egypt was the
[1:52:42] same one that kept them in captivity
[1:52:46] by the assyrians it was the same reason
[1:52:49] that kept them in captivity by the
[1:52:56] babylonians
[1:52:58] praise the lord it was the same reason
[1:53:01] and the same spirit that kept them in
[1:53:03] captivity
[1:53:04] by the roman empire
[1:53:09] are we together
[1:53:13] so the beast at the beginning
[1:53:16] was the beast in the garden of eden he
[1:53:18] was the beast at the end
[1:53:20] and it showed that he's a religious
[1:53:24] person a relate a a a denomination that
[1:53:28] made a denomination and it comes right
[1:53:30] through
[1:53:31] the same trill is just
[1:53:34] traveling from genesis all the way to
[1:53:37] revelation because genesis
[1:53:39] is the sea chapter is sword abyss
[1:53:42] he was more subtitled than all the
[1:53:45] beasts of the field
[1:53:46] that see was sold in genesis and yet he
[1:53:49] comes up in revelation
[1:53:51] as the beast at the end
[1:53:57] are we together
[1:54:06] let's read this one also from mike uh
[1:54:09] mark of the beast book
[1:54:11] daniel saw the same vision 800 years
[1:54:14] before this
[1:54:15] he saw the vision he saw those be
[1:54:19] separated one from another in the
[1:54:21] beginning
[1:54:22] of their gentile ruling and here they
[1:54:26] are
[1:54:26] john seeing the same thing
[1:54:31] the beast that was
[1:54:34] and it's not but yet it is it is not but
[1:54:38] yet it is
[1:54:40] which means it's not now in a political
[1:54:42] system
[1:54:43] but it is in a religious system
[1:54:47] it is not but yet it is
[1:54:54] are we together
[1:54:59] praise the lord
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:05] so the same beast that moses saw by
[1:55:08] vision
[1:55:09] in the garden of eden is the same beast
[1:55:11] that dania sought
[1:55:13] now uh john is seeing the same thing
[1:55:15] here
[1:55:16] for down here it was a political system
[1:55:19] that represented himself in the head of
[1:55:21] gold
[1:55:22] the breadth of any uh uh uh the breast
[1:55:25] of sivir
[1:55:27] the the the leon surprise and the feet
[1:55:30] of iron
[1:55:31] that was how daniel saw it but yet
[1:55:35] when john saw the same beast he's seen
[1:55:38] it as a different power
[1:55:42] that a woman is riding on
[1:55:50] are we together
[1:55:56] okay i knew that that i missed something
[1:55:59] here
[1:56:00] i knew that i missed something but let's
[1:56:02] go to genesis chapter 10.
[1:56:07] genesis chapter 10
[1:56:11] praise the lord
[1:56:19] i really not started preaching here
[1:56:21] though
[1:56:25] i'm just i'm trying to find
[1:56:28] how to take root in what i want to say
[1:56:33] so i'm just laying the foundation here
[1:56:38] genesis chapter 10 when you read genesis
[1:56:40] chapter 10
[1:56:41] right here we see a man that is
[1:56:45] emerging here and he comes
[1:56:48] out of he comes out of
[1:56:52] let me say it this way let me let me
[1:56:53] find the right right way to say
[1:56:57] noah had three sons and one of his son
[1:57:02] disobeyed his father a
[1:57:05] disgrace's father let me say that way
[1:57:08] let me just say that way because
[1:57:10] i don't want to go into anything
[1:57:14] so and god came down
[1:57:18] and he dared with him by cursing
[1:57:21] kenneth and ham and cana
[1:57:30] and then ham had this son
[1:57:33] called kush now verse eight kuch is the
[1:57:36] father of nero
[1:57:40] nimrod he began to be a
[1:57:44] mighty one on the earth
[1:57:49] praise the lord now so
[1:57:52] let's let's trace it back
[1:57:56] because his very name nimrod means
[1:58:00] rebellion
[1:58:04] his very name nimra becomes
[1:58:07] rebellion and this is the guide that is
[1:58:10] now
[1:58:10] going to be the bible say he became a
[1:58:12] mighty one in the earth
[1:58:16] he was might he was a mighty
[1:58:20] hunter before the lord
[1:58:26] if you really go back in and said it on
[1:58:29] that verse
[1:58:30] it was not being a mighty hunter before
[1:58:34] the lord then it's not meaning that
[1:58:38] he was in the word of god
[1:58:41] okay he was a mighty hunter
[1:58:45] that was defiant to god
[1:58:49] this is the man that that they were
[1:58:52] going to build this tower of barbell
[1:58:54] to reach to the heavens but he became a
[1:58:58] mighty one in the earth
[1:58:59] where did he got his authority from from
[1:59:03] a root of rebellion
[1:59:09] he just suffered and became a mighty one
[1:59:12] in the earth
[1:59:19] are we together so as we as we follow
[1:59:24] this
[1:59:24] we see here and then that uh uh
[1:59:27] he was very defined to the lord a mighty
[1:59:30] hunter before the law wherefore
[1:59:33] he said even as as nero is
[1:59:37] is a mighty hunter before the lord
[1:59:40] and the beginning of his kingdom
[1:59:44] was babel
[1:59:49] praise the lord the beginning of his
[1:59:52] kingdom
[1:59:53] was barbell now we have to watch
[1:59:56] here that the serpent
[1:59:59] saw a sea of doubt
[2:00:03] against god's word
[2:00:06] one word he dropped into god's
[2:00:09] commandment
[2:00:11] god says the day you eat of death you
[2:00:14] will
[2:00:15] die you will surely die
[2:00:18] he says the day you eat of it you shall
[2:00:21] not
[2:00:22] that three-letter word was a
[2:00:25] seed of discrepancy
[2:00:32] that would change the cost and it it was
[2:00:36] it was a seed of this tree princess that
[2:00:38] would make
[2:00:39] eve to stop in her tracks
[2:00:42] and say i wonder what this mean
[2:00:45] one hour will the beast influence her
[2:00:49] life
[2:00:52] one moment by just stopping and say what
[2:00:55] you said
[2:00:56] i wonder what does that mean
[2:01:04] are we together
[2:01:08] it would change the edom of god it would
[2:01:11] change the perfection
[2:01:12] a garden of peace and perfection will
[2:01:15] now become a guiding of disorder
[2:01:20] because a wrong seed was sold
[2:01:26] praise the lord amen
[2:01:30] and that would cause the first death the
[2:01:32] first murder
[2:01:34] that was ever that ever took place on
[2:01:35] the earth where king
[2:01:37] would kill ibel that would bring about
[2:01:41] the first line
[2:01:43] when god asks him where's your brother
[2:01:45] abel he told the first lie
[2:01:49] a seed was sword
[2:01:55] are we together
[2:01:58] and this little seed of doubt
[2:02:01] sea of unbelief that was sold
[2:02:05] noun is becoming a kingdom
[2:02:09] in genesis 10.
[2:02:15] that little seed of deception
[2:02:19] is now growing it grew up
[2:02:25] it first started by passing the ball god
[2:02:28] came down adam what have you done that's
[2:02:30] the wife you gave me
[2:02:31] woman what have you done that's the
[2:02:32] second you gave me that seed started
[2:02:34] pushing things around
[2:02:39] then it became a lie king tore a lie
[2:02:43] then it became a murder and it starts
[2:02:47] it starts growing it starts growing and
[2:02:50] now
[2:02:52] after the act and now becoming a kingdom
[2:02:58] from norway nero is rising to become
[2:03:02] a mighty man in defiance of god
[2:03:18] praise the lord the beast
[2:03:21] that was and it's not but yet is
[2:03:32] so yeah we'll see this this money ketum
[2:03:36] that has that that has built in and all
[2:03:38] of these people in one
[2:03:39] car we want to build a town that reached
[2:03:41] heaven speaking one language they are
[2:03:43] determined
[2:03:45] because they are honoring an influence
[2:03:47] of a mighty
[2:03:48] rebellious king
[2:03:56] we build something better than the boat
[2:03:58] of noah
[2:03:59] if there can't ever come at judgment
[2:04:01] again it would never get to us
[2:04:05] something stronger than the board of
[2:04:07] noah that that rocket thing that he
[2:04:09] built
[2:04:09] up there we need to get something
[2:04:12] stronger
[2:04:13] if there's a god behind the clouds we
[2:04:15] can get to him
[2:04:17] there's just only one way it is by the
[2:04:19] sheer blood
[2:04:22] oh praise the lord amen
[2:04:26] you love the lord this morning let's
[2:04:28] give the lord a hand of praise
[2:04:30] amen
[2:04:33] these waters will be praised
[2:04:39] is because you and myself
[2:04:42] we are in we are in battle with this
[2:04:44] defying spirit
[2:04:46] we meet it every day we come
[2:04:49] we come in contact with it every day
[2:04:53] they want to change our way of life we
[2:04:55] want to it want to detect to us
[2:04:58] you have to remember it does not have a
[2:05:00] kingdom it's a detecting spirit
[2:05:07] lucifer said i will ascend my throne
[2:05:10] above the stars of god
[2:05:11] how do you have a throne if you don't
[2:05:13] have a kingdom
[2:05:17] but he was going to build a throne and
[2:05:19] then use his
[2:05:20] evil influence and draw people
[2:05:23] intimidate them
[2:05:27] god knows that when you do this you'll
[2:05:29] be just like him
[2:05:31] he robbed them of their deity
[2:05:35] because they were already gods because
[2:05:38] they came right from the lineage of god
[2:05:41] he made them in his image
[2:05:46] but to become more smarter he robbed
[2:05:49] them of their divine
[2:05:52] attributes
[2:05:56] are we together praise the lord
[2:06:01] amen
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:10] this is not you know this is not against
[2:06:11] any and then anybody is just it just
[2:06:14] thought as i was thinking of
[2:06:15] thinking about this yesterday studying a
[2:06:17] little bit it just hit my mind
[2:06:19] it's almost just like a seminary a man
[2:06:22] goes to seminary
[2:06:24] and he goes to spend four years six
[2:06:26] years every year
[2:06:28] he graduates and then
[2:06:31] he get a diploma to become a pastor but
[2:06:34] he don't have a church
[2:06:38] but he gave him a diploma you are a
[2:06:41] pastor
[2:06:43] you are a shepherd but he don't have
[2:06:45] sheep
[2:06:47] but because he have associated with a
[2:06:51] system
[2:06:52] that system has given him power
[2:06:58] you see the concept are you seeing the
[2:07:02] concept
[2:07:02] that's the reason why the principle of
[2:07:05] the mark of the beast structurally
[2:07:07] is the mark in the forehead
[2:07:10] is acknowledging
[2:07:14] the mark in the in the hands is
[2:07:18] association
[2:07:23] one hour with the beast
[2:07:32] praise the lord amen
[2:07:44] that's the reason why as as believers as
[2:07:46] as
[2:07:47] uh as children of god you know we we we
[2:07:50] don't
[2:07:50] we you know as much as we love the word
[2:07:53] of god and we love the mysteries of the
[2:07:55] hour and we love everything we must keep
[2:07:57] our eyes on that word
[2:08:01] keep your eyes on that word because it
[2:08:03] was the very same word
[2:08:04] that satan talked to eve and he just
[2:08:07] twisted it
[2:08:10] dropped a little doubt in it it has to
[2:08:13] line up
[2:08:14] with the scripture all the time are we
[2:08:17] together
[2:08:19] praise the lord
[2:08:24] praise the lord so so one hour with the
[2:08:27] beast
[2:08:30] just like i said the principle
[2:08:33] is authoritate wrong
[2:08:36] wrong authority by affiliation
[2:08:41] so here is saul now he has all of these
[2:08:45] questions in his heart because he know
[2:08:47] by the word of god a
[2:08:49] king must come out of judah he's of the
[2:08:52] trap of benjamin
[2:08:53] he spent night with with with
[2:08:56] uh samuel the prophet he he prophesies
[2:08:59] with the
[2:09:00] he got out there and broke in the spirit
[2:09:02] speaking in tongues prophesying in
[2:09:04] interpretation
[2:09:05] you know and he's enjoying the spirit of
[2:09:07] god
[2:09:09] while doing all of this
[2:09:12] down in his heart he's asking himself
[2:09:16] wow wow is this me
[2:09:19] wow wow
[2:09:25] praise the lord praise the lord
[2:09:35] that's the reason why we must we must be
[2:09:37] very conscious of our heart
[2:09:39] amen we must be very conscious of our
[2:09:43] heart we must
[2:09:44] like like solomon say we must guide our
[2:09:46] heart
[2:09:52] and the only way to guide your heart is
[2:09:54] use the word
[2:09:56] you can use anything different
[2:10:02] so saul was among the prophets
[2:10:08] you also see back in the book of numbers
[2:10:12] you see quran and dayton we have gone
[2:10:16] over that before
[2:10:17] why did they rose against moses
[2:10:21] the reason why they rose up against
[2:10:24] moses because
[2:10:25] they were they were all born of the
[2:10:28] levite tribe
[2:10:30] they were leviticus as much as moses was
[2:10:33] born of the levi tribe
[2:10:36] and the blessings of jacob the
[2:10:38] priesthood
[2:10:40] was supposed to go to levi
[2:10:43] so you are from the levi tribe i'm from
[2:10:46] the levi tribe
[2:10:47] why should you take yourself special
[2:10:50] over us
[2:10:56] the bible says they were gang sailors in
[2:10:58] a sense
[2:10:59] they spread this thing among the people
[2:11:03] we were down there suffering in egypt
[2:11:05] moses he ran away
[2:11:07] came back with a majestic in his hands
[2:11:09] and and and and everything
[2:11:11] you know is is he and his brother aaron
[2:11:13] the other one leading us
[2:11:14] and and and uh uh cora
[2:11:18] was able to to to warm up the people
[2:11:21] wrap the people up in
[2:11:22] in emotion
[2:11:29] i mean he raised the spirit of the
[2:11:30] people up
[2:11:34] moses wants to make himself special
[2:11:36] moses wants to make himself
[2:11:38] so so a a a a a a spirit
[2:11:42] of rebellion
[2:11:46] enter in him he was on the liver trap
[2:11:50] that's right sacrificed the eighth day
[2:11:54] correct
[2:11:58] but he never met the burning bush
[2:12:03] he never met the burning bush he did not
[2:12:05] have a commission
[2:12:08] he followed moses saw the supernatural
[2:12:12] walk through the red sea on the other
[2:12:15] side
[2:12:16] and he's challenging the very thing that
[2:12:19] deliver him
[2:12:25] are we together amen
[2:12:42] yeah praise the lord
[2:12:48] brother branham talked preach about
[2:12:50] anointer once in the end time
[2:12:52] talks about doing god a service without
[2:12:54] his will
[2:12:55] you know all of those are messages for
[2:12:57] us to to study
[2:12:59] you know and and uh review
[2:13:03] these thoughts reveal as the holy spirit
[2:13:06] you know uh will be dealing with your
[2:13:07] heart
[2:13:09] you know uh i mean jesus said uh uh
[2:13:12] you know uh you know many will come to
[2:13:14] me in that day and say lord
[2:13:16] having not done this lord having not
[2:13:17] done that lord he said depart from me
[2:13:19] you workers of iniquity
[2:13:21] i didn't even knew you
[2:13:25] but everything that they did was was was
[2:13:28] things that you could say this is of the
[2:13:30] law
[2:13:40] are we together
[2:13:43] so you see corolla and dayton now
[2:13:46] think about uh uh what is his name
[2:13:50] aaron he was the very
[2:13:53] brother of moses the one that god said
[2:13:56] aaron will be your spook man then later
[2:14:00] on god shall bring
[2:14:01] aaron and his sons into the tabernacle
[2:14:05] into the priesthood you you watch them
[2:14:07] presented as priests
[2:14:09] in the absence of moses the people
[2:14:12] put pressure on aaron
[2:14:18] and he billed him a golden calf
[2:14:24] god called the name of aaron to moses
[2:14:27] your brother aaron would be your prophet
[2:14:32] but when he came on a pleasure
[2:14:38] he turned to idolatry
[2:14:46] and just like i said the the age that we
[2:14:49] are living in the age is on a pressure
[2:14:52] we talk about the tear pool we talk
[2:14:54] about the manifestation of the bride the
[2:14:56] spoken word ministry
[2:14:58] we are under so much pressure
[2:15:01] until the people are building
[2:15:06] images
[2:15:08] they are looking for the superman to to
[2:15:11] lead the bride
[2:15:15] oh this brother has this this you know
[2:15:18] he's the man of the
[2:15:19] the solomon he's the man of the hour
[2:15:23] pleasure the people put pressure we
[2:15:26] don't know if moses is going to come
[2:15:27] back
[2:15:30] this is 40 days since he's gone
[2:15:41] every time moses went to to the chopper
[2:15:45] of of of pharaoh every time he met
[2:15:48] pharaoh
[2:15:49] aaron was right there
[2:15:57] he was the mouthpiece of moses
[2:16:02] he was the one talking on behalf of the
[2:16:05] prophet
[2:16:06] but yet when he came under pressure he
[2:16:09] built
[2:16:10] an image and told the people
[2:16:14] here is a god that had brought you out
[2:16:19] the very man i was standing beside moses
[2:16:22] when he raised his hand and the red sea
[2:16:26] potted is now giving the people
[2:16:30] a golden calf to wash it
[2:16:33] why because he came honor pressure
[2:16:43] praise the lord
[2:16:46] are we together amen
[2:16:51] why is quiet in here
[2:16:55] praise the lord i hope that the holy
[2:16:58] spirit can
[2:16:59] use this quietness and just wave into
[2:17:02] our spirit
[2:17:03] open our eyes deal with our heart
[2:17:07] we talk about one goal god has one goal
[2:17:10] and you know what that goal is to have
[2:17:13] preeminence
[2:17:17] god won't go he wants to have
[2:17:20] preeminence
[2:17:20] thou shalt have no other god before me
[2:17:27] don't stop at the church don't stop at
[2:17:29] the pastor
[2:17:30] you have to meet the living god because
[2:17:33] he
[2:17:34] is a living god and his glory he will
[2:17:37] give to no
[2:17:40] man
[2:17:43] he is a living god
[2:17:46] he's not a system he's not just a
[2:17:49] doctrine
[2:17:51] he's not a core of other he's the god of
[2:17:54] life
[2:17:58] and he still live the same yesterday
[2:18:01] today and forever
[2:18:09] the church comes on a pressure the
[2:18:12] people
[2:18:13] give themselves a golden car they are
[2:18:15] turning to different things
[2:18:18] it's either we build a movement to run
[2:18:21] after
[2:18:22] and we have seen many of them has risen
[2:18:24] and they have just fought and collapsed
[2:18:29] praise the lord anything that man may
[2:18:33] would die a natural death
[2:18:38] it will have some time to live you know
[2:18:41] it will
[2:18:42] it will wrap the people up oh yeah we
[2:18:44] are the bride
[2:18:45] oh yeah we are the rapture people you
[2:18:47] know uh you know i mean
[2:18:48] many of them has raised up
[2:18:54] and now those very same people
[2:18:57] are now turning to idolatry
[2:19:02] they are either fighting against the
[2:19:03] very thing they believe
[2:19:05] oh they are you know they are making
[2:19:08] something different out of it
[2:19:11] trying to look for the messiah
[2:19:14] one hour with the beast just
[2:19:18] one hour with that peace system
[2:19:24] praise the lord see john chapter one
[2:19:27] i realized that i was close here i'm
[2:19:30] trying to to beat around the bush
[2:19:31] because i want to get into something but
[2:19:33] i don't know if i have all the time
[2:19:36] so i don't want to i don't want to get
[2:19:38] in it and then i realize that i don't
[2:19:40] have time and when i look at the time
[2:19:42] i know that i don't have time
[2:19:45] so let's take some john chapter 1
[2:19:49] saint john chapter 1.
[2:19:54] saint john chapter 1
[2:19:57] are we together amen
[2:20:01] you know i was looking at something this
[2:20:03] morning as i was studying
[2:20:05] oh let me let me let me let me say this
[2:20:07] to you i know i went over it
[2:20:09] but you will realize that there were
[2:20:11] seven
[2:20:12] kingdoms or seven nations that god
[2:20:16] used to to to discipline
[2:20:19] israel every time they got into a
[2:20:21] rebellious state
[2:20:22] the first time when they got jealous
[2:20:25] of joseph when jacob's son got jealous
[2:20:30] of joseph's gift
[2:20:31] he led them to egypt
[2:20:35] praise the lord amen
[2:20:39] the second time was uh
[2:20:42] uh the the assyrians
[2:20:47] israel went into captivity under the
[2:20:49] assyrians
[2:20:56] and and and that was word uh uh the
[2:20:59] samaritans
[2:21:00] lost their identification because one
[2:21:03] time
[2:21:03] samira was part of israel but when that
[2:21:07] captivity
[2:21:08] came and with the years that the people
[2:21:10] spin into captivity
[2:21:12] it was a gentile nation that was ruling
[2:21:14] the people
[2:21:15] so their jewish religion was now mixed
[2:21:18] with gentile idol worship
[2:21:24] they brought all of those things in now
[2:21:26] sacrificing to children
[2:21:28] and all of those things they make they
[2:21:30] make a part of it
[2:21:37] and then right after that we realize
[2:21:39] that we see
[2:21:40] where uh uh ahab came on the scene
[2:21:43] got married to jezebel and just dragged
[2:21:46] israel down in a dolly train
[2:21:51] even though god sent elijah the prophet
[2:21:54] build the the the the altar of the lord
[2:21:58] and all of that to restore the house of
[2:22:00] the people but the people were so caught
[2:22:02] under this system
[2:22:03] that even when elijah left on the scene
[2:22:07] they went from one rebellion to another
[2:22:09] rebellion
[2:22:10] and god had to raise up nebuchadnezzar
[2:22:16] so it was egypt they assyrians babylon
[2:22:20] but all of these nations they were
[2:22:24] all under the inspiration of babel
[2:22:32] that's the reason why you see babylon
[2:22:35] keeps sufficing in the bible
[2:22:36] it was it was not but yet it is
[2:22:41] it started back then in genesis 10 as
[2:22:44] barbell
[2:22:49] it came in the middle of the book as
[2:22:50] babylon and for a while it disappeared
[2:22:54] but then it suffers him back in the book
[2:22:56] of revelation as a spiritual kingdom
[2:22:58] mystery babylon
[2:23:06] are we together so then right after
[2:23:10] babylon we realized that god raised up
[2:23:12] the meats and the persians
[2:23:17] the mies and the persians came that was
[2:23:19] word daniel became the friend to darus
[2:23:21] the king
[2:23:24] that knew that daniel was serving the
[2:23:26] the truth and living god when when uh
[2:23:28] when and daniel was placed in the in the
[2:23:30] lion then under the persian that was
[2:23:32] where
[2:23:33] we find esther
[2:23:36] god raising up esther to defend the
[2:23:39] children of israel
[2:23:41] but god took israel or every time they
[2:23:44] were caught in rebellion god raised up
[2:23:46] a nation to span them back
[2:23:51] they would go into captivity they would
[2:23:53] be enslaved to their own
[2:23:55] rebellious spirit
[2:23:59] are we together and then god will send a
[2:24:02] deliverer he'll bring a prophet on the
[2:24:04] scene or he will do something
[2:24:05] deliver the people and then they will go
[2:24:07] back again
[2:24:14] and then after the meeting persian the
[2:24:17] greece came
[2:24:18] and then from there the roman came
[2:24:24] but you realize is that seemed old
[2:24:27] babylon spirit that seemed rebellious
[2:24:31] spirit that started from genesis chapter
[2:24:33] 3
[2:24:34] and became a kingdom in genesis chapter
[2:24:36] 10
[2:24:37] it keeps changing form
[2:24:42] and we are in a spiritual roman kingdom
[2:24:49] that is influenced by the roman church
[2:24:52] around the world
[2:24:56] the kingdom has become a church it's
[2:24:59] called the mother of all church
[2:25:03] catholic the universal church we are the
[2:25:07] first church
[2:25:12] we could take time and just go through
[2:25:14] all of those scripture
[2:25:16] but i i just i want to keep you in the
[2:25:19] in the in the inspiration of the day
[2:25:22] praise the lord are we together
[2:25:29] amen
[2:25:33] oh what a wonderful jesus we serve
[2:25:38] amen now
[2:25:42] these are getting their influence by
[2:25:45] association
[2:25:47] one hour with the beast they have been
[2:25:49] made kings
[2:25:50] with our kingdom but
[2:25:53] the the true church of god
[2:25:59] the born-again church of god the sons
[2:26:02] and daughters of god
[2:26:05] john said over here in first i mean john
[2:26:08] chapter 1
[2:26:11] praise the lord amen
[2:26:15] saint john chapter 1.
[2:26:29] in the beginning was the word
[2:26:33] and that is the original seed god
[2:26:35] original seed is his word
[2:26:38] the word of god is the original seed
[2:26:41] of god amen
[2:26:44] begin with the word of god there is no
[2:26:46] way you can fail
[2:26:55] plan that word that word there is no way
[2:26:58] it will produce
[2:26:59] nothing else but god himself
[2:27:06] praise the lord in the beginning was the
[2:27:08] word
[2:27:09] and the word was with god and the word
[2:27:11] was god the sin was in the beginning
[2:27:14] we talked about that you know the c
[2:27:16] principle begins with the word
[2:27:18] you will you will come out with the word
[2:27:20] all things were made by him without him
[2:27:22] nothing was made
[2:27:24] i was made in him was life and the life
[2:27:28] was the light of
[2:27:29] man and john went on and on praise the
[2:27:32] lord
[2:27:33] verse 9 that was the true light which
[2:27:37] lighted every man that commented in the
[2:27:39] word he
[2:27:40] was in the word and the word was
[2:27:44] made by him and the word
[2:27:47] knew him not praise the lord
[2:27:51] i i i was listening to a testimony of
[2:27:54] of a brother that got converted from
[2:27:58] from from islam to uh to christianity
[2:28:03] this was one of the chapters that really
[2:28:05] hit him he he
[2:28:06] he struggled with jesus being god and
[2:28:09] and
[2:28:09] but then when he went as the law was
[2:28:11] dealing with him when he came closer
[2:28:13] i mean this scripture just he says wow
[2:28:17] so because in the quran the quran said
[2:28:20] jesus
[2:28:21] is the word
[2:28:24] the quran says that jesus is the word
[2:28:29] so for him to see here that is the word
[2:28:32] that created everything
[2:28:34] then he has to believe that jesus
[2:28:36] created everything
[2:28:41] okay that would be for another day that
[2:28:44] was just a parenthesis let's read him
[2:28:46] he came to his own and his own receive
[2:28:49] him that
[2:28:50] but as many as receive him
[2:28:54] he gave to them
[2:28:57] give he power there's another power here
[2:29:00] that is given
[2:29:02] revelation 17 these kings god power one
[2:29:06] hour with the beast but there is another
[2:29:08] group of people here that power is also
[2:29:10] giving to
[2:29:11] [Laughter]
[2:29:14] praise the lord as many as receiving to
[2:29:18] them gave he power to become
[2:29:20] sons and daughters of god even to them
[2:29:24] that believe
[2:29:25] on his name which were born
[2:29:28] not of blood none of the weight of the
[2:29:32] flesh
[2:29:32] none of the way of god of men
[2:29:36] but they were born of god
[2:29:41] praise the lord
[2:29:46] so yeah honor the beast system
[2:29:49] you get power by association
[2:29:53] honor this kingdom you get power by
[2:29:56] birth
[2:30:01] you don't have to become member of the
[2:30:03] church for you to get power
[2:30:05] you get power when you are born again
[2:30:08] the power of the believer comes by birth
[2:30:12] your birth is your authority your birth
[2:30:14] is your position
[2:30:22] praise the lord
[2:30:27] one guess power by association even
[2:30:30] around the even around the message we
[2:30:32] have seen the scene people come
[2:30:34] they sit down they associate they learn
[2:30:36] the quotes they learn the pres
[2:30:37] the principle they become a minister
[2:30:39] nobody i mean nobody can tell anybody
[2:30:41] who is a minister on that
[2:30:44] that one thing you cannot tell a man one
[2:30:45] and more many things
[2:30:52] praise the lord
[2:30:57] but we have to see the principle here
[2:30:59] the principle here
[2:31:01] is that the word is
[2:31:05] what rooted the word is the king
[2:31:11] so if a man cannot subject himself to
[2:31:14] the word
[2:31:15] because we are born by the word the
[2:31:17] incorruptible seed of god
[2:31:21] that's where the believer power comes
[2:31:23] from from his birth
[2:31:24] from his new birth now by
[2:31:28] church association never putting names
[2:31:31] on the book
[2:31:33] but by that birth that comes back the
[2:31:36] word
[2:31:39] that show you your true identity in god
[2:31:43] it takes you beyond nations that take
[2:31:46] you beyond
[2:31:47] kingdoms and family and tribes and take
[2:31:49] you right back to the heart of god
[2:31:51] that you are a child of god
[2:31:57] so we don't have power by association we
[2:32:00] have power by birth
[2:32:03] the believer power comes by birth
[2:32:07] it comes by the new birth that's the
[2:32:10] reason why
[2:32:10] the new birth is not an idea
[2:32:16] the new birth is not a feeling the new
[2:32:19] birth is not just
[2:32:20] a a dry eye confession
[2:32:25] and the new birth is a work that god
[2:32:28] does in ub all of all things have passed
[2:32:31] away
[2:32:32] and everything became new
[2:32:40] praise the lord you see that's the
[2:32:43] reason why
[2:32:44] many christians walk just like saul
[2:32:48] they enjoy the revival they enjoy
[2:32:51] the presence of god but there is a
[2:32:53] haunting question in their heart
[2:32:59] they keep dealing with things that they
[2:33:01] know is not right
[2:33:05] they keep walking in there hoping
[2:33:08] that god will take it away
[2:33:13] but i'll tell you that god is more than
[2:33:15] evil
[2:33:17] praise the lord god is more than able
[2:33:19] you have to meet him just like jacob
[2:33:21] date
[2:33:27] jacob got tired he knew he had the
[2:33:30] birthright
[2:33:31] he knew he had a blessing
[2:33:35] but this spirit of deception could not
[2:33:37] leave him
[2:33:40] he says i got to nail this thing down
[2:33:45] he had to meet god
[2:33:49] you have to meet the angel if you don't
[2:33:52] bless me i will not leave you
[2:34:01] serving god is not it's not by
[2:34:03] affiliation
[2:34:06] all the father has given me will come
[2:34:09] that's what jesus said
[2:34:11] and i will not lose one that's why he
[2:34:14] said
[2:34:17] can we say praise the lord amen what a
[2:34:21] wonderful jesus we serve
[2:34:23] our power the power of the church comes
[2:34:26] by birth
[2:34:28] that's the reason why we must strive to
[2:34:30] get back to the world
[2:34:37] that was the cry in the preview of the
[2:34:40] bride
[2:34:41] stay in line get back to the word
[2:34:49] one hour with the beast
[2:34:54] one hour in the wrong environment
[2:34:58] can influence your life for the worse
[2:35:04] remember i like i said it's not it's not
[2:35:07] a 20 you know system any hour i'm
[2:35:10] talking about i'm talking about
[2:35:12] uh a focus of time
[2:35:18] it never took one hour for eve
[2:35:22] it just took a meaning it never took one
[2:35:25] hour for lot's wife
[2:35:28] it just took a turn on her shoulder
[2:35:31] and she turned to a pillow of swords
[2:35:44] are we together
[2:35:55] just close here i'm tempted to go into
[2:35:57] something as i said but
[2:35:58] it would take it would take uh it would
[2:36:01] it would take us
[2:36:02] more time than we want to spend so let's
[2:36:05] just
[2:36:06] let's just think on these things like
[2:36:08] paul says
[2:36:09] you know we have messages of an
[2:36:12] influence of one man on another
[2:36:16] you know whatever i'm talking about
[2:36:17] isaiah chapter six
[2:36:19] the friendship between uzir and and and
[2:36:22] isaiah the prophet
[2:36:24] you know we we have all of that that
[2:36:26] we've been taught
[2:36:28] you know but you you you have to you
[2:36:30] have to you have to narrate down this
[2:36:32] way
[2:36:33] you know your influence
[2:36:37] can even can either reduce your
[2:36:39] authority
[2:36:41] or it can give you a wrong authority if
[2:36:44] it's a wrong influence
[2:36:52] as many as believe
[2:36:55] give he power
[2:36:58] give he power we know that uh
[2:37:02] uh uh uh about that birth the power
[2:37:05] comes by the birth
[2:37:11] praise the lord and we realize that
[2:37:14] what it is is the thing that brings the
[2:37:17] identification
[2:37:18] that we can look at ourselves and know
[2:37:20] that we we are sons and daughters of god
[2:37:22] we have always been sons and daughters
[2:37:24] of god
[2:37:25] it's that quickening power that brings
[2:37:28] the reality
[2:37:29] it brings the true recognition you wake
[2:37:32] up to the reality oh my goodness
[2:37:35] i've been playing around all of this why
[2:37:42] and people wonder
[2:37:46] while the church is in its condition
[2:37:48] that is in
[2:37:50] the last this church has just become a
[2:37:52] disgrace to christianity
[2:38:02] that uh that uh uh uh uh
[2:38:05] uh uh miracle-seeking uh uh uh preachers
[2:38:08] will have to
[2:38:10] to get into enchantment and get
[2:38:12] themselves into all sorts of
[2:38:14] voodoo things just to perform miracles
[2:38:19] prosperity seeking preachers will have
[2:38:21] to just will just
[2:38:23] become a motivational speaker and
[2:38:26] inspire the people
[2:38:27] god will bless you in all this
[2:38:36] that's the condition of the last day
[2:38:39] church
[2:38:40] has become a disgrace
[2:38:45] all of the mega building and the media
[2:38:47] churches
[2:38:48] that we have they have all become
[2:38:52] cages of unclean birds
[2:38:58] the adulteration and and on clean living
[2:39:00] that
[2:39:01] role in those systems
[2:39:06] people walking with an anointing
[2:39:10] preaching
[2:39:11] and yet they know in their heart
[2:39:15] romans chapter one we were close with
[2:39:17] that musician you can come
[2:39:29] if god is dealing with your heart
[2:39:32] take it as an opportunity
[2:39:35] don't wink your shoulder to god
[2:39:39] and think you can just get by by being a
[2:39:41] church member and showing up
[2:39:43] for service on wednesday night or sunday
[2:39:46] morning
[2:39:48] not if god is dealing with your heart
[2:39:50] like i said it's an opportunity
[2:39:52] he's calling you into partnership
[2:39:57] praise the lord romans chapter one
[2:40:02] [Music]
[2:40:03] let's take the egg
[2:40:12] [Music]
[2:40:28] romans chapter one
[2:40:31] are we together
[2:40:44] [Music]
[2:40:48] oh praise the lord
[2:40:54] praise the lord paul says romans chapter
[2:40:57] 1 verse 16
[2:40:58] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[2:41:00] christ for it is the
[2:41:02] power of god unto salvation to everyone
[2:41:04] that believeth
[2:41:06] to the jews first and also to the
[2:41:08] gentiles for therein is the
[2:41:10] righteousness of god revealed
[2:41:12] from faith to faith as it is written
[2:41:15] that just shall live by faith
[2:41:17] for the wrath of god is revered from
[2:41:20] heaven
[2:41:20] against all ungodliness and
[2:41:23] unrighteousness of man
[2:41:26] who uphold men who uphold the truth
[2:41:31] in righteousness and unrighteousness god
[2:41:33] wrath is revealed against them
[2:41:35] because that which maybe
[2:41:39] know of god is manifest in them
[2:41:42] for god have shown it unto them for the
[2:41:45] invisible things of god
[2:41:47] from the creation of the world are
[2:41:49] clearly seen
[2:41:50] being honest too by the things that are
[2:41:53] made
[2:41:53] even the internal power of god and the
[2:41:56] godhead so that they are with our excuse
[2:41:59] because
[2:42:00] when they knew god they glorified him
[2:42:04] not as god neither were thankful
[2:42:08] but they became vain in their
[2:42:09] imagination and their foolish heart was
[2:42:12] docking professing themselves to be wise
[2:42:15] they were fools they changed the glory
[2:42:18] of the incorruptible god into
[2:42:22] an image made like a corruptable man
[2:42:25] or bird or four-footed beasts all
[2:42:28] creeping things
[2:42:29] wherefore god also gave them over
[2:42:33] to unclaimed thoughts
[2:42:36] uncleanness through their lust the loss
[2:42:39] of their heart
[2:42:40] to dishonor their body now you see
[2:42:42] that's
[2:42:43] that was the situation saul was caught
[2:42:45] in
[2:42:46] the question down in his heart kept
[2:42:48] troubling him
[2:42:50] it kept troubling him so as soon as he
[2:42:52] saw that david was rising to frame
[2:42:55] that unsettled question in his heart now
[2:42:58] turned to
[2:42:59] jealousy and jealousy turned to
[2:43:01] bitterness
[2:43:02] and bent on the stream to a desire to
[2:43:05] kill david
[2:43:09] because he had a wall in his heart
[2:43:13] that was empty even though he had
[2:43:17] inspiration speaking in tongues
[2:43:19] preaching the word of god
[2:43:20] but he had a void in his heart that was
[2:43:23] empty
[2:43:27] and it turned to jealousy it turned to
[2:43:29] bitterness
[2:43:31] it turned to haunting the life of devi
[2:43:35] with a javelin until he did not became a
[2:43:39] shreem of it anymore
[2:43:41] he made david the enemy of the kingdom
[2:43:44] he slowly moved into detectorship
[2:43:48] even when samuel the prophet told him
[2:43:50] the law has rejected you
[2:43:53] because you have rejected the word of
[2:43:54] god
[2:43:56] he knew that god rejected him but he was
[2:43:58] still holding to the throne
[2:43:59] say exercise in power say giving command
[2:44:10] paul says because god has
[2:44:14] made those things known that the
[2:44:16] invisible things of god
[2:44:19] the people has changed the glory of god
[2:44:22] to corruptable man and beast he said
[2:44:25] wherefore god
[2:44:26] give them to unclean
[2:44:30] cleanliness they are lust for them to
[2:44:32] dishonor their bodies
[2:44:34] between themselves the ones that hold
[2:44:37] the truth of god
[2:44:38] in lines they worship and save the
[2:44:41] creature
[2:44:42] more than the creator who is blessed
[2:44:44] forever for this cause
[2:44:46] god gave them over to violent affliction
[2:44:51] for even their women has changed the
[2:44:53] natural use
[2:44:56] into that wish is against nature
[2:45:01] praise the lord and likewise also the
[2:45:04] man
[2:45:04] living the natural use of the woman you
[2:45:07] can see
[2:45:08] you can see the spirit of rebellion
[2:45:12] in this age you can see how the people
[2:45:14] have gone far from god
[2:45:17] because the pornographic
[2:45:21] industry is prospering more than the
[2:45:23] [Music]
[2:45:26] church
[2:45:29] because the people has rejected the
[2:45:32] spirit of god
[2:45:33] so god is turning their heart over until
[2:45:36] a man is becoming like beasts
[2:45:42] they can pierce hair pierced nose
[2:45:44] pierced earpiece
[2:45:46] i mean man is just man is just becoming
[2:45:50] violent and even violent to himself
[2:45:56] it shows how much the holy ghost is
[2:45:59] leaving the generation
[2:46:04] the people are not coming to conviction
[2:46:06] under the word of god
[2:46:08] the word of god is just used for
[2:46:09] entertaining
[2:46:11] they sit down they're not their heads
[2:46:15] even when the holy spirit is present
[2:46:17] dealing with your heart they cannot
[2:46:19] press through
[2:46:19] like jacob did
[2:46:35] for this cause god gave them unto vader
[2:46:38] affliction
[2:46:38] for even the women that change the
[2:46:40] natural use
[2:46:43] change the natural use into that which
[2:46:46] is against nature
[2:46:47] and likewise the man leaving the natural
[2:46:50] use of the woman burning in their lust
[2:46:53] towards
[2:46:53] one another men with men working that
[2:46:56] which
[2:46:57] is unseen and what is happening
[2:47:00] the government has come right behind
[2:47:02] this
[2:47:04] and they say you have to take it
[2:47:07] you have to take it this is their choice
[2:47:10] of life
[2:47:10] you have to take it
[2:47:14] and that's what that's what the system
[2:47:16] is the system will use the government
[2:47:20] to push us into this
[2:47:29] what's in it the suffering code the
[2:47:31] supreme court of the land
[2:47:34] that satisfied a gay right
[2:47:38] the highest court of the land
[2:47:45] you know what is what he's saying he's
[2:47:46] saying that
[2:47:48] we have accepted this these things that
[2:47:50] is coming towards us
[2:47:55] when once this nation stare like an
[2:47:58] innocent lamb
[2:48:02] held religious freedom
[2:48:07] the bible was the book
[2:48:12] and they still remained a book above
[2:48:14] every book but she had kicked the bible
[2:48:16] out of schools
[2:48:17] [Music]
[2:48:22] one hour with the beast
[2:48:25] has changed the nation from a christian
[2:48:28] nation
[2:48:29] to the west adonation
[2:48:35] every every idol comes in and creep
[2:48:38] they will fight against christians
[2:48:44] gave the muslims right
[2:48:49] one hour with the beast
[2:48:54] don't entertain the devil
[2:49:00] brother said if you stop to pick him up
[2:49:03] if you give him the back seat he will
[2:49:04] come to the front
[2:49:06] and when he gets to the front he will
[2:49:07] take over your steering
[2:49:10] and he will drive you where he want to
[2:49:11] carry you
[2:49:15] don't even give him a ride
[2:49:22] oh praise the lord let's just worship
[2:49:26] the lord
[2:49:41] [Music]
