[2:01] but until then we have to wonder about
[2:03] the source of the tongues
[2:05] you can see right now that if you back
[2:07] up a tongue's evidence and don't know
[2:09] what is being said
[2:10] you have to finally come to the place
[2:12] where all tongues have to be of god
[2:15] that would lead us then to believe that
[2:17] the devil cannot speak in tongues
[2:19] that is not so no not for a minute any
[2:22] true missionary on a foreign field knows
[2:24] only too well that devils speak in other
[2:27] tongues the same as i know it by
[2:29] experience
[2:31] pentecostal theologians admit that they
[2:33] have no scripture setting forth that
[2:35] people speak with tongues when baptized
[2:37] by the holy ghost
[2:39] they admit that they infer it from the
[2:40] experiences set forth in the book of
[2:42] acts wherein three out of five times the
[2:45] people spoke with tongues
[2:47] and they also say without any scripture
[2:50] that there are two kinds of tongues
[2:52] one is the tongue you speak in while
[2:54] receiving the holy ghost and it is the
[2:56] evidence
[2:57] while later on if you believe you can
[2:59] receive the gift of tongues whereby you
[3:00] may speak often
[3:02] however they say once having spoken in
[3:05] tongues as the evidence of receiving you
[3:07] may never speak again
[3:09] once more we are anxious to know where
[3:11] this is found in the word
[3:13] if it isn't there then god hath not
[3:15] spoken it and woe unto him who would add
[3:18] to that word
[3:19] but there is something in the word about
[3:21] this very subject that they ignore
[3:23] completely
[3:24] first corinthians 13
[3:27] it mentions tongues of men and angels
[3:30] these would be known and unknown tongues
[3:32] modern pentecostals say that they can
[3:34] receive the holy ghost speaking in
[3:36] unknown or angelic tongues
[3:38] they have the cart before the horse
[3:40] for in acts 2 the people spoke in a
[3:42] perfect dialect which even unbelievers
[3:44] heard and understood
[3:47] now when god is silent we had better be
[3:49] silent
[3:50] but where he has spoken we had better
[3:52] speak to
[3:53] and say what he has already said
[3:56] he told us the evidence or what would
[3:58] happen after being baptized with the
[3:59] holy ghost was that we would have the
[4:02] teacher come and teach all truth
[4:04] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[4:06] not an outside teacher
[4:08] if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[4:10] hear the truth and receive it by
[4:12] revelation if you heard it every moment
[4:14] of the day
[4:15] that was the sign of the indwelling
[4:17] spirit in the days of paul
[4:19] those who were filled with the holy
[4:20] ghost heard the word received it and
[4:23] lived by it
[4:24] those who did not have the spirit heard
[4:26] it only as carnal men put a wrong
[4:28] interpretation on it and went into sin
[4:32] in every age and every age is the age of
[4:34] the holy ghost for the true believer
[4:37] i say in every age the evidence was the
[4:39] same
[4:40] those who had the spirit the teacher
[4:43] heard the word
[4:44] and that spirit in them took the word
[4:46] and taught it revealed it to them
[4:48] and they were of the group that heard
[4:50] the messenger and his message and took
[4:52] it and lived it
[4:54] i know it is a great temptation to refer
[4:56] back to the day of pentecost and also to
[4:59] the day when the holy ghost fell in the
[5:00] house of cornelius and then set those
[5:02] two identical experiences as the
[5:04] evidence of the baptism with the holy
[5:06] ghost
[5:08] but on each occasion the tongues were
[5:10] understood by the listeners
[5:12] this is a far cry from the modern babble
[5:14] of confusion of pentecostal meetings
[5:17] and if this were not enough to persuade
[5:18] us to leave off such reasoning
[5:20] what will we do when we are confronted
[5:22] with the fact that people who have never
[5:24] spoken in tongues have some of the other
[5:26] eight manifestations in their lives such
[5:29] as word of wisdom the discerning of
[5:31] spirits a word of knowledge faith
[5:34] healing and even miracles
[5:36] and this observation is even more
[5:38] interesting in the light that tongues is
[5:39] the least of the nine gifts
[5:41] so when we see people who do not nor
[5:44] ever have spoken in tongues
[5:46] use greater gifts than those who do
[5:48] speak in tongues we must discount such a
[5:50] doctrine even more completely than
[5:52] before
[5:54] so you can see now that we cannot afford
[5:56] to say what the bible has not said
[5:59] when scripture teaches us that the work
[6:01] of the holy spirit and the manifestation
[6:03] of that blessed person is to bring the
[6:05] truth of each age to the true seed of
[6:07] that age
[6:08] then we know that the spirit has to be
[6:10] abiding in the person or he cannot
[6:12] receive the truth for that time amen
[6:16] that is exactly correct
[6:18] and if these ages bring out anything
[6:19] they surely bring and bear out this
[6:21] truth
[6:23] now before we leave this subject i want
[6:25] to make myself very clear on what the
[6:27] baptism with the holy ghost is according
[6:29] to the word
[6:30] it is not according to me and it is not
[6:33] according to you
[6:34] it has to be according to thus saith the
[6:36] lord or we are falsely led
[6:39] amen
[6:41] to begin with you will notice that in my
[6:43] meetings when i have finished preaching
[6:45] an evangelistic service or some teaching
[6:47] message i cast the net and invite a
[6:49] response from the people
[6:51] i ask them to come forward and receive
[6:53] the holy spirit
[6:55] my pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[6:57] say this believe that i am inviting
[6:59] people to come forward to be baptized
[7:00] with the holy ghost because they are
[7:02] already born again
[7:04] so when i invite those who are
[7:05] spirit-filled to come and deal with
[7:07] those who have answered the invitation
[7:09] to receive the spirit
[7:10] these dear ones surge forward and deal
[7:12] with the people in such manner as to
[7:14] encourage them to yield to god and
[7:16] believe to speak in tongues
[7:19] this has caused a great deal of
[7:20] confusion
[7:22] and i want to tell you exactly what i
[7:23] mean
[7:25] i mean for the sinner to come forward
[7:26] and be born again which is to be
[7:29] baptized into the body of christ by the
[7:31] holy ghost which is exactly what took
[7:33] place at pentecost when the church was
[7:35] launched
[7:36] in other words to be born of the spirit
[7:38] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[7:40] ghost
[7:41] it is one in the same now i realize that
[7:45] it is going to be confusing for a moment
[7:47] here as most people know that i was
[7:49] ordained a baptist preacher and i have
[7:51] steadfastly declared that the baptists
[7:53] have missed it for saying you receive
[7:55] the holy ghost when you believe for that
[7:57] is not so
[7:59] you receive him since you believed acts
[8:02] 19 2-6
[8:04] he said unto them have you received the
[8:06] holy ghost since he believed
[8:09] and they said unto him
[8:10] we have not so much as heard whether
[8:12] there be any holy ghost
[8:14] and he said unto them unto what then
[8:17] were ye baptized and they said unto
[8:20] john's baptism
[8:21] then said paul
[8:23] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[8:25] repentance
[8:26] saying unto the people that they should
[8:28] believe on him which should come after
[8:30] him that is on christ jesus
[8:33] when they heard this they were baptized
[8:34] in the name of the lord jesus
[8:37] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[8:39] them the holy ghost came upon them and
[8:41] they spake with tongues and prophesied
[8:44] there it is
[8:46] paul asked
[8:47] have you received since not when you
[8:50] believed
[8:51] and there is a great difference there
[8:52] for it is after we believe that we
[8:54] receive
[8:56] ephesians 1 13
[8:58] is an exact word repeat of what happened
[9:00] in ephesus according to acts 19
[9:02] in whom ye also trusted
[9:05] after that ye heard the word of truth
[9:07] the gospel of your salvation
[9:10] in whom also after that ye believed not
[9:13] when ye believed ye were sealed with
[9:15] that holy spirit of promise
[9:18] now here is my point
[9:20] too many of our modernists and even our
[9:22] fundamentalists so called
[9:25] believe unto salvation at a certain
[9:27] specific time which in many cases is
[9:29] called making a decision
[9:31] and that has been called receiving
[9:33] christ or being born again
[9:35] now to receive christ is to receive his
[9:37] spirit
[9:38] to receive his spirit is to be born
[9:40] again
[9:41] to receive his spirit is to be baptized
[9:43] with the holy ghost
[9:45] amen these folks believe
[9:48] that is wonderful
[9:49] but they stop there
[9:51] you receive the holy ghost after you
[9:53] believe
[9:54] it has always been that way and always
[9:57] will be
[9:58] the very first word of direction to the
[10:00] people was by peter at pentecost and he
[10:02] said
[10:03] repent and be baptized every one of you
[10:05] in the name of jesus christ for the
[10:07] remission of sins and you shall receive
[10:10] the gift of the holy ghost
[10:12] for the promise is unto you and to your
[10:14] children and to all that are afar off
[10:17] even as many as the lord our god shall
[10:19] call
[10:21] these directions came as a direct answer
[10:23] from peter relative to what had actually
[10:25] happened at pentecost
[10:27] what came to pass was that god according
[10:29] to joel was pouring out the promised
[10:31] holy spirit upon all flesh
[10:34] he was not poured out before that time
[10:36] or given before that time this was it
[10:39] but this was to come from now on by
[10:41] repenting being baptized in the name of
[10:44] the lord jesus christ
[10:46] and then god was duty bound to fill the
[10:48] ones who came
[10:50] peter or any of the apostles never said
[10:53] ye must be born again and then filled
[10:55] with the spirit
[10:57] that this is the pattern of experience
[10:59] relative to receiving the holy spirit
[11:01] note carefully the very next time that
[11:03] the spirit fell upon a people
[11:05] acts 8 5-17
[11:08] then philip went down to the city of
[11:10] samaria and preached christ unto them
[11:13] and the people with one accord gave heed
[11:15] unto those things which philip spake
[11:17] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[11:19] did
[11:20] for unclean spirits crying with loud
[11:22] voice came out of many that were
[11:24] possessed with them
[11:26] and many taken with palsies and that
[11:28] were lame were healed
[11:30] and there was great joy in that city but
[11:32] there was a certain man called simon
[11:34] which before time in the same city used
[11:37] sorcery and bewitched the people of
[11:39] samaria giving out that himself was some
[11:41] great one
[11:43] to whom they all gave heed from the
[11:45] least to the greatest saying
[11:47] this man is the great power of god
[11:50] and to him they had regard because that
[11:52] of long time he had bewitched them with
[11:54] sorceries
[11:55] but when they believed philip preaching
[11:57] the things concerning the kingdom of god
[11:59] and the name of jesus christ they were
[12:01] baptized both men and women
[12:04] then simon himself believed also
[12:07] and when he was baptized he continued
[12:09] with philip and wandered beholding the
[12:12] miracles and signs which were done
[12:14] now when the apostles which were at
[12:16] jerusalem heard that samaria had
[12:18] received the word of god they sent unto
[12:20] them peter and john
[12:21] who when they were come down prayed for
[12:23] them that they might receive the holy
[12:25] ghost
[12:26] for as yet he was fallen upon none of
[12:28] them only they were baptized in the name
[12:30] of the lord jesus
[12:32] then laid they their hands on them and
[12:34] they received the holy ghost
[12:37] according to verse 12 they believed the
[12:39] word
[12:40] they were then baptized in the name of
[12:42] the lord jesus
[12:44] but according to verse 16 in spite of
[12:46] all that they had still not received the
[12:49] holy spirit
[12:50] it was only after believing and being
[12:52] baptized correctly but they received the
[12:55] holy ghost
[12:56] that is the exact pattern is set forth
[12:58] by peter in acts 2
[13:00] 38-39
[13:02] another scripture that casts wondrous
[13:04] light on this is found in galatians 3
[13:06] 13-14
[13:09] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[13:11] tree
[13:12] that the blessing of abraham might come
[13:13] on the gentiles through jesus christ
[13:16] but in order that we might receive the
[13:18] promise of the spirit through faith
[13:21] now by no means can it be said that the
[13:23] blessing of abraham is the rebirth and
[13:26] that the promise of the spirit
[13:28] is the baptism with the holy ghost as
[13:30] two separate events
[13:32] for the scripture reads thus jesus died
[13:35] on the cross and by means of that death
[13:37] and resurrection the blessing of abraham
[13:39] came on the gentiles leaving the jews
[13:42] this transpired in order that the spirit
[13:44] might become available to the gentiles
[13:48] to understand what i have just said is
[13:50] to clear up why students have never ever
[13:52] found paul saying at any time
[13:55] be born again and then be spirit filled
[13:58] they have inferred it is there and they
[14:00] have put their own meanings to make it
[14:02] say it but scripture does not say that
[14:06] jesus never said it either
[14:08] look at john 7 37-39
[14:11] and read it now with understanding
[14:14] in the last day that great day of the
[14:17] feast jesus stood and cried saying if
[14:20] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[14:22] drink
[14:23] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[14:25] hath said out of his belly shall flow
[14:28] rivers of living water
[14:30] but this spake he of the spirit
[14:32] which they that believe on him should
[14:34] receive
[14:35] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[14:37] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[14:41] now it says here distinctly and
[14:42] emphatically that the believer upon
[14:44] drinking by coming unto jesus in faith
[14:47] would have rivers of living waters
[14:48] pouring out of him
[14:50] and it places this experience at
[14:52] pentecost
[14:53] now keeping this thought in mind we read
[14:55] john 4 10 and 14
[14:58] if thou knewest the gift of god and who
[15:01] it is that saith to thee give me to
[15:03] drink thou wouldst have asked of him and
[15:05] he would have given thee living water
[15:08] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[15:10] i shall give him shall never thirst but
[15:13] the water that i shall give him shall be
[15:15] in him a well of water springing up into
[15:17] everlasting life
[15:19] this same living water is mentioned but
[15:22] this time it is not called a river it is
[15:24] called an artesian well
[15:26] there is where the people make their
[15:28] mistake
[15:29] because it is called a well and a river
[15:32] they think that in one place it is
[15:33] eternal life given by the spirit and in
[15:36] the next place where it is called a
[15:38] river implying a great dynamism
[15:40] it has to be the spirit now given as an
[15:42] endowment of power
[15:44] not so
[15:45] it is one and the same
[15:47] it is the spirit that gives life and
[15:49] power and that came at pentecost
[15:52] what is it that caused this
[15:54] misunderstanding
[15:56] the answer is
[15:57] experience
[15:59] we have gone by experience and not the
[16:01] word
[16:02] away with experience as your measuring
[16:04] line
[16:05] there is only one plumb line only one
[16:07] rod and that is the word
[16:10] now watch carefully and get this
[16:12] peter said
[16:13] repent and be baptized in the name of
[16:15] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[16:18] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[16:19] holy ghost
[16:21] paul said
[16:22] have you received the holy ghost since
[16:24] he believed
[16:25] this is the whole of our problem right
[16:27] here
[16:28] people repent of their sins they get
[16:30] baptized in water but they don't go on
[16:33] and receive the holy ghost
[16:35] you believe unto receiving the spirit
[16:38] believing on jesus is the step in the
[16:40] right direction which is toward the holy
[16:41] ghost
[16:42] but the people stop there
[16:44] they go as far as water and then stop
[16:47] they believe and then stop
[16:49] the bible does not say that you receive
[16:52] when you believe it is have you received
[16:55] the holy ghost since you believed
[16:57] the exact and literal translation is
[17:00] did ye having previously believed
[17:01] receive the holy ghost the people
[17:04] believe and then stop
[17:06] you don't receive the holy ghost when
[17:08] you believe unto him having repented
[17:10] you go on and receive the holy ghost
[17:13] do you see it
[17:14] that is what is wrong with our
[17:15] fundamentalists
[17:17] they have no power for they stop short
[17:18] of pentecost
[17:20] they are like the children of israel who
[17:22] came out of egypt and stopped short of
[17:24] the promised land
[17:25] now those children of israel left egypt
[17:27] about 2 million strong
[17:29] they all journeyed together all saw the
[17:31] same miracles of god
[17:33] all partook of the same manna and water
[17:35] from the smitten rock
[17:37] all followed the same cloud by day in
[17:39] the pillar of fire by night but only two
[17:42] reached the promised land
[17:44] only two were true or real believers
[17:47] that is correct because the word tells
[17:49] us that the rest died because of
[17:50] unbelief
[17:52] and because of unbelief they could not
[17:54] enter in
[17:55] hebrews 3 19
[17:58] then since that is so and only two
[18:00] entered then the rest were not true
[18:02] believers
[18:03] what made the difference
[18:05] two stayed with the word
[18:08] when the hearts of the ten spies failed
[18:10] at kedesh barnia joshua and caleb did
[18:12] not stagger for they believed the word
[18:14] and said
[18:15] we are more than able to take the land
[18:18] they knew they could because god had
[18:20] said
[18:21] i have given you the land
[18:23] after all those israelites saw of the
[18:25] power and goodness and deliverance of
[18:27] god they did not enter into rest which
[18:29] is a type of the holy ghost
[18:31] so you can see right now that very few
[18:34] will ever believe all the way to
[18:35] receiving the spirit of god
[18:38] all right we have come this far
[18:40] now i want to go further and when i do i
[18:43] know i am going to cause some emotions
[18:45] to rise
[18:46] but that is something i am not
[18:47] responsible for
[18:49] i am responsible to god and his word and
[18:51] the people god has sent me to
[18:54] i have to be faithful in all he gives me
[18:56] to say
[18:58] in john 6 37 and 44 it says
[19:02] all that the father giveth me shall come
[19:04] to me and him that cometh to me i shall
[19:06] in no wise cast out
[19:08] no man can come to me except the father
[19:11] draw him
[19:12] and i will raise him up at the last day
[19:15] john 1 12-13
[19:18] but as many as received him to them gave
[19:20] he the power to become the sons of god
[19:22] even to them that believe on his name
[19:25] which were born not of blood
[19:27] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[19:29] will of man but of god
[19:33] ephesians 1 4 through 5
[19:36] according as he has chosen us in him
[19:38] before the foundation of the world
[19:40] that we should be holy and without blame
[19:42] before him
[19:43] in love having predestinated us onto the
[19:45] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[19:48] himself
[19:49] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:50] will
[19:52] now without getting too involved in the
[19:54] subject of sovereignty of god for that
[19:56] would take a book in itself
[19:58] let me point out here that according to
[20:00] these verses
[20:01] jesus christ is choosing his own bride
[20:04] just the same as men choose their brides
[20:06] today
[20:07] the bride today does not simply decide
[20:09] she is going to take a certain man for a
[20:10] husband
[20:11] no sir
[20:13] it is the groom who decides and chooses
[20:15] a certain woman for his bride
[20:17] john 15 16
[20:20] ye have not chosen me but i have chosen
[20:22] you
[20:24] now according to the word of god the
[20:25] bride was chosen before the foundation
[20:27] of the world
[20:29] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[20:30] in himself
[20:32] ephesians 1 9
[20:34] and in romans 9 11 it says
[20:37] that the purpose of god according to
[20:38] election might stand
[20:40] you can't read it any other way
[20:42] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[20:44] god was to take a bride of his own
[20:47] choosing and that purpose was in himself
[20:50] and being eternal was decreed before the
[20:52] foundation of the world
[20:54] watch carefully now and see this
[20:57] before there was ever a speck of
[20:59] stardust before god was god god is an
[21:02] object of adoration and no one was there
[21:04] to worship him so he was at that time
[21:07] only potentially god
[21:09] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[21:12] the bride was already in his mind yes
[21:14] she was
[21:15] she was existing in his thoughts
[21:18] and what about those thoughts of god
[21:20] they are eternal are they not
[21:22] the eternal thoughts of god
[21:25] let me ask you
[21:26] are the thoughts of god eternal
[21:29] if you can see this you will see many
[21:31] things
[21:32] god is unchangeable in both essence and
[21:34] behavior
[21:35] we have studied that and proven that
[21:37] already
[21:38] god is infinite in his abilities so
[21:40] therefore he as god must be omniscient
[21:43] if he is omniscient then he is not now
[21:45] learning nor is he taking counsel even
[21:47] with himself
[21:49] nor is he at any time adding to his
[21:51] knowledge
[21:52] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[21:54] is not omniscient the best we could say
[21:57] is that sometime he will be
[21:59] but that is not scriptural he is
[22:01] omniscient
[22:03] he has never had a new thought about
[22:04] anything because all his thoughts he has
[22:07] always had and always will have
[22:09] and knows the end from the beginning
[22:11] because he is god
[22:14] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[22:16] they are real
[22:18] they are not simply like a man with a
[22:19] blueprint he has drawn up and which one
[22:22] day will be translated into substance
[22:23] and form but they are already real and
[22:26] eternal and part of god
[22:28] see how this works
[22:30] god always had his thoughts for adam
[22:33] adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[22:36] psalm 139
[22:38] 15-16 will give you a little idea of
[22:41] this
[22:42] my substance was not hid from thee when
[22:45] i was made in secret and curiously
[22:47] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[22:49] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[22:51] being unperfect
[22:53] and in thy book were all my members
[22:55] written which in continuance were
[22:57] fashioned
[22:58] when as yet there were none of them
[23:00] that as i said was not written about
[23:02] adam but it gives you the idea and
[23:05] knowledge that the thought was there in
[23:06] his mind
[23:07] and that thought was eternal and had to
[23:09] be expressed
[23:10] so when adam was formed of the dust of
[23:12] the earth and his spiritual being
[23:14] created by god then adam became god's
[23:17] thought expressed and those eternal
[23:19] thoughts were now manifested
[23:22] down through the centuries we could go
[23:25] we find a moses a jeremiah a john the
[23:28] baptist and each one of these were god's
[23:30] eternal thought expressed in its season
[23:33] then we come to jesus the logos
[23:36] he was the perfect and complete thought
[23:38] expressed and he became known as the
[23:40] word
[23:41] that is what he is and forever will be
[23:45] now it says that he has chosen us in him
[23:49] jesus before the foundation of the world
[23:52] that means that we were right there with
[23:54] him in the mind and thoughts of god
[23:56] before the foundation of the world
[23:58] that gives an eternal quality to the
[24:00] elect you can't get away from that let
[24:04] me inject a thought in here
[24:06] even our natural birth is based upon
[24:08] election
[24:09] the female ovaries produce many many
[24:11] eggs
[24:12] but why is it that at a certain time a
[24:14] certain egg comes down and not another
[24:16] one
[24:17] and then amongst the male sperm for no
[24:19] known reason a certain germ attaches
[24:21] itself to the egg while others that
[24:23] could have just as easily attached
[24:25] themselves or had a better opportunity
[24:27] to do so did not do so and perished
[24:31] there is an intelligence behind all this
[24:33] otherwise what determines whether the
[24:35] baby is a boy or girl blonde or brunette
[24:38] light or dark type of eyes etc
[24:41] with these thoughts in mind think about
[24:43] joshua and caleb
[24:45] did not jesus say in john 6 49
[24:48] your fathers did eat manna in the
[24:50] wilderness and are dead
[24:52] those parents that died were necessary
[24:54] as the forefathers of the people to whom
[24:55] jesus was speaking they perished yet
[24:58] they were in the election of god
[24:59] naturally as joshua and caleb were
[25:01] spiritually
[25:03] but to go on
[25:04] these elect were not only the eternal
[25:06] thoughts of god which were to be
[25:07] expressed in flesh in their due season
[25:10] but these same elect are called by
[25:11] another name
[25:13] romans 4 16
[25:15] therefore it is of faith that it might
[25:17] be by grace to the end the promise might
[25:20] be sure to all the seed
[25:22] not to that only which is of the law but
[25:25] to that also which is of the faith of
[25:27] abraham who is the father of us all
[25:30] romans 9 7-13
[25:33] neither because they are the seed of
[25:34] abraham are they all the children but in
[25:37] isaac shall thy seed be called
[25:39] that is they which are the children of
[25:41] the flesh
[25:42] these are not the children of god but
[25:45] the children of the promise are counted
[25:46] for the seed
[25:48] for this is the word of promise at this
[25:50] time will i come and sarah shall have a
[25:53] son
[25:54] and not only this but when rebecca had
[25:56] also conceived by one even by our father
[25:59] isaac
[26:00] for the children being not yet born
[26:02] neither having done any good or evil
[26:04] that the purpose of god according to
[26:06] election might stand not of works but of
[26:08] him that calleth
[26:10] it was said unto her
[26:12] the elder shall serve the younger
[26:14] as it is written jacob have i loved but
[26:16] esau have i hated
[26:18] galatians 3 16
[26:21] now to abraham and his seed were the
[26:23] promises made
[26:25] he saith not and to seeds as of many but
[26:28] as of one and to thy seed which is
[26:30] christ
[26:31] galatians 3 29
[26:33] and if ye be christ's
[26:35] then are ye abraham's seed and heirs
[26:37] according to the promise
[26:39] according to romans 4 16 we find that
[26:42] god has given a sure promise to all of
[26:44] abraham's seed
[26:46] and paul puts himself and all believers
[26:48] under that designation because he says
[26:51] abraham who is the father of us all
[26:54] then he goes on to not only narrow down
[26:56] his definition but rather to finalize it
[26:59] for in galatians 3 he identified the
[27:01] seed singular with jesus and counted the
[27:05] seed children as children of promise
[27:08] and promise as having to do with
[27:10] election or the choosing of god
[27:12] and that is exactly what we have been
[27:14] saying
[27:15] these who are of the royal seed are the
[27:17] elect of god
[27:19] are the predestinated foreknown of god
[27:22] and were in the mind of god and his
[27:24] thoughts
[27:26] in very plain language the true bride of
[27:28] christ was in the mind of god eternally
[27:30] though not expressed until each came
[27:32] forth in the designated decreed season
[27:35] as each member came forth it became
[27:37] expressed and took its place in the body
[27:41] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[27:43] word seed bride
[27:45] and though she is feminine in
[27:46] designation she is also called the body
[27:48] of christ
[27:50] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[27:52] called that for she was predestinated in
[27:54] him came from the same source was
[27:57] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[27:59] god in a many membered body or as once
[28:02] god was manifested in one member even
[28:04] our lord jesus christ
[28:07] now then here we are coming to a
[28:09] conclusion
[28:10] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[28:14] the sun and in jesus dwelt all the
[28:16] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[28:18] eternal one was the father manifest in
[28:20] flesh and thereby gain the title of son
[28:24] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[28:26] our turn became the many-membered spoken
[28:28] word seed manifest in flesh
[28:31] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[28:33] in flesh are the sons of god
[28:36] even as we are so called
[28:38] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[28:41] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[28:43] for only the elect can be reborn
[28:46] because we were seed is the reason we
[28:48] could be quickened
[28:50] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[28:53] hold this carefully in mind
[28:55] now take the next step
[28:59] [Music]
[30:04] you
