[1:34] him that overcometh will i give to eat
[1:36] of the hidden manna and i will give him
[1:38] a white stone and in this stone a new
[1:41] name written which no man knoweth saving
[1:43] he that receiveth it
[1:45] each message to each age holds out an
[1:48] incentive to the believer encouraging
[1:50] him to be an overcomer and thereby be
[1:52] rewarded of the lord
[1:54] in this age the spirit is promising the
[1:56] hidden manna and a new name written in a
[1:58] white stone
[2:00] now since each of these messages is
[2:02] directed to the angel human messenger a
[2:06] very great responsibility as well as a
[2:07] wonderful privilege is his lot to these
[2:10] men god makes special promises as in the
[2:12] case of the twelve apostles sitting on
[2:14] twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes
[2:16] of israel
[2:18] then remember paul was given a special
[2:20] promise that of presenting the people of
[2:22] the bride in his day to jesus
[2:25] second corinthians 11 2
[2:28] for i am jealous over you with a godly
[2:30] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[2:32] husband
[2:33] that i may present you as a chaste
[2:35] virgin to christ
[2:37] so it will be with every messenger who
[2:38] has been faithful to the word of his
[2:40] hour and his age
[2:42] it will be so in the last day
[2:44] it will be the same special reward that
[2:46] was given to paul
[2:48] i think most of you remember how i said
[2:50] i had always been afraid to die lest i
[2:52] should meet the lord and he should not
[2:54] be pleased with me as i had failed him
[2:55] so many times
[2:57] well i had been thinking of that one
[2:59] morning as i lay in bed and suddenly i
[3:01] was caught up in a most peculiar vision
[3:04] i say it was peculiar for i have had
[3:06] thousands of visions and not once did i
[3:08] seem to leave my body
[3:10] but there i was caught up
[3:12] and i looked back to see my wife and i
[3:14] saw my body lying there beside her
[3:17] then i found myself in the most
[3:18] beautiful place i have ever seen
[3:21] it was a paradise
[3:22] i saw throngs of the most beautiful and
[3:24] happiest people i have ever seen
[3:27] they all looked so young
[3:29] about 18 to 21 years of age there was
[3:32] not a gray hair or a wrinkle or any
[3:34] deformity amongst them the young women
[3:36] all had hair down to their waists and
[3:39] the young men were so handsome and
[3:40] strong
[3:42] oh how they welcomed me
[3:44] they hugged me and called me their
[3:45] darling brother and kept telling me how
[3:47] glad they were to see me
[3:49] as i wondered who all those folks were
[3:51] one beside me said they are your people
[3:55] i was so astonished i asked
[3:58] are all these branhams he said
[4:01] no they are your converts
[4:03] he then pointed to one lady and said
[4:05] see that young lady that you were
[4:07] admiring a moment ago
[4:08] she was 90 years old when you won her to
[4:11] the lord
[4:12] i said
[4:13] oh my and to think this is what i was
[4:15] afraid of
[4:16] the man said
[4:18] we are resting here while waiting for
[4:19] the coming of the lord
[4:21] i replied i want to see him
[4:24] he said
[4:25] you can't see him just yet
[4:27] but he is coming soon
[4:29] and when he does he will come to you
[4:31] first and you will be judged according
[4:32] to the gospel you have preached and we
[4:35] will be your subjects
[4:37] i said
[4:38] do you mean i am responsible for all
[4:40] these
[4:41] he said everyone
[4:43] you were born a leader
[4:45] i asked him
[4:46] will everyone be responsible what about
[4:49] saint paul
[4:51] he answered me
[4:52] he will be responsible for his day
[4:55] well i said
[4:56] i've preached the same gospel that paul
[4:58] preached and the multitude cried
[5:01] we're resting on that
[5:03] yes i can see that god is going to give
[5:05] a special reward to his messengers who
[5:07] have faithfully discharged the
[5:08] responsibility he has placed upon them
[5:11] if they have received the revelation of
[5:13] the word for that age and faithfully
[5:15] preached in their day and lived what
[5:17] they preached they will receive a great
[5:20] reward
[5:22] now with this thought in mind look at
[5:23] the verse again
[5:25] i will give him the hidden manner
[5:27] we all know that the manna was angel
[5:29] food
[5:30] it was what god sent down upon the grass
[5:32] for israel at the time of their
[5:34] wanderings it was perfect food
[5:37] it was amazing how those little pellets
[5:38] of food kept them in perfect health no
[5:41] one got sick
[5:42] it was all they needed
[5:44] when the ark was made they put some of
[5:45] that manna into it
[5:47] then the ark was put behind the veil and
[5:50] only the high priest would dare approach
[5:51] unto it and then he had to have the
[5:53] sacrificial blood
[5:55] the bread from heaven symbolized by
[5:57] manna one day came down from heaven and
[5:59] became life for all who believe on him
[6:02] he said
[6:03] i am the bread of life i am the living
[6:06] bread that came down from heaven if any
[6:08] man shall eat of this bread he shall
[6:10] live forever
[6:12] when he went away he left us his word
[6:15] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[6:17] every word that proceeds out of the
[6:19] mouth of god
[6:21] his word was bread
[6:23] it was the perfect manna which if a man
[6:26] live by he shall never die
[6:28] but right after the death of the fathers
[6:30] no one seemed to know the exact truth
[6:32] and in a short while this manner seemed
[6:34] to have become hidden to the people
[6:37] but in every age god began to give back
[6:39] by revelation that which was hidden
[6:42] until in this last day according to
[6:44] revelation 10 7
[6:46] a prophet will come and reveal all the
[6:48] mysteries and then the lord will come
[6:51] now in each age i say the messengers
[6:54] received hidden truth
[6:56] but they did not receive it for
[6:57] themselves only
[6:59] but it is as it was when the disciples
[7:02] were asked to serve the multitudes
[7:03] loaves and fishes jesus gave them the
[7:06] broken food but they in turn gave it to
[7:08] the people
[7:09] god gives his hidden manna to the
[7:11] overcomer it cannot be otherwise
[7:14] he would not open his treasures to those
[7:16] who spurn what is already revealed
[7:19] what i have been saying about the
[7:20] messenger of each age receiving from god
[7:22] some of the original truth of pentecost
[7:25] is typed out in the old testament where
[7:27] moses was commanded to take up three and
[7:29] one-half pints of manna and place it in
[7:31] a golden vessel behind the veil of the
[7:33] holy of holies
[7:35] there the high priest of every
[7:36] generation could enter with sacrificial
[7:38] blood
[7:40] then he could take a small portion of
[7:41] this manna for it did not corrupt which
[7:44] was part of the original and eat it
[7:47] now in every age the messenger of the
[7:49] lord to that age was given the
[7:50] revelation of god for that specific
[7:52] period
[7:54] once the messenger was enlightened by
[7:55] truth he would bring that truth to the
[7:57] people
[7:58] and they whose ears had been opened by
[8:00] the spirit would hear that truth believe
[8:03] it and live it
[8:05] now then there is also the thought of
[8:07] the future partaking of the hidden manna
[8:09] i think it will be the eternal partaking
[8:11] of the revelation of jesus christ in the
[8:13] eternal ages to come
[8:15] how else could we begin to know the
[8:17] unsearchable riches of his own being
[8:20] all that we have longed to know
[8:22] all our unanswered questions all that
[8:24] will be revealed
[8:25] it will be from christ who is our life
[8:27] that we receive it
[8:29] oh sometimes we think we get to know a
[8:31] little of him and his word down here and
[8:33] it is so good it makes us rejoice
[8:36] but one day when our flesh changes that
[8:38] word and he will become what we had
[8:40] never dreamed possible
[8:42] it also says here that he is going to
[8:44] give the overcomer a white stone and in
[8:46] not on the stone a new name which the
[8:50] owner alone knows
[8:52] now the idea of a new name is a familiar
[8:54] one
[8:54] abram was changed to abraham
[8:57] saraya to sarah jacob to israel simon to
[9:00] peter and saul to paul
[9:03] these names either brought about a
[9:04] change or were given because of a change
[9:06] it was only after abram and sariah had
[9:09] their names changed by the lord but they
[9:11] were made ready to receive the coming
[9:13] son
[9:14] in jacob's case he had to overcome and
[9:17] then he was called a prince
[9:19] in the case of simon and saul when they
[9:21] had received the lord their change came
[9:24] and today each one of us true believers
[9:26] has had a change in name
[9:28] we are christians
[9:30] it is a name common to all of us
[9:32] but one day we will have another change
[9:35] we will of a certainty receive a new
[9:37] name
[9:38] it could well be that name was our true
[9:40] and original name written in the lamb's
[9:42] book of life from the foundation of the
[9:44] world
[9:45] he knows the name but we do not
[9:48] one day at his good pleasure we will
[9:50] know also
[9:52] a white stone
[9:54] how beautiful
[9:55] here is another picture of this saint
[9:57] receiving recompense from the hand of
[9:59] god for his trials upon earth
[10:01] you know after constantine the false
[10:03] church was able to dip its hand in the
[10:05] state treasury and thereby erect
[10:07] beautiful buildings full of lovely
[10:09] statuary
[10:10] these statues made of white marble were
[10:12] actually roman idols renamed as saints
[10:15] the churches and their furnishings were
[10:17] exceptionally beautiful even as one sees
[10:20] today
[10:21] but god was not with them
[10:23] where was god
[10:24] he was with his saints in some little
[10:26] home or in a cave or some wild mountain
[10:29] area where they hid from the false
[10:30] church members
[10:32] they did not have beautiful buildings
[10:34] gowned choirs fine clothes and other
[10:36] worldly attractions
[10:38] but now in this special promise to the
[10:40] true believers of all ages
[10:42] god has declared he will give them
[10:44] rewards of great beauty and eternal
[10:46] duration
[10:47] let the wealthy look down on the poor
[10:50] let them give large sums to the church
[10:52] that it in turn might honor the donor by
[10:54] placing a marble plaque or some statuary
[10:56] in their honor on public display that
[10:58] all may applaud
[11:00] someday the god who sees and knows all
[11:03] will once more commend the widow for
[11:05] giving her all though it be but two
[11:07] might
[11:08] and he himself reward with the treasures
[11:10] of heaven
[11:12] yes hidden manner and a new name in a
[11:13] white stone
[11:15] how good is the lord to us to reward us
[11:17] so wonderfully and we so undeserving
[11:20] oh i want to be ready at all times to do
[11:23] his will and to lay up treasures in
[11:26] heaven chapter 6
[11:29] the thiatian church age
[11:32] revelation 2
[11:33] 18-29
[11:36] and unto the angel of the church in
[11:38] thyatira write
[11:39] these things saith the son of god who
[11:42] hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[11:44] and his feet are like fine brass
[11:47] i know thy works and charity and service
[11:49] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[11:53] and the last to be more than the first
[11:56] notwithstanding i have a few things
[11:58] against thee because thou sufferest that
[12:00] woman jezebel which calleth herself a
[12:02] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[12:04] servants to commit fornication and to
[12:06] eat things sacrificed unto idols and i
[12:10] gave her space to repent of her
[12:11] fornication and she repented not
[12:14] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[12:16] them that commit adultery with her into
[12:18] great tribulation
[12:20] except they repent of their deeds
[12:22] and i will kill her children with death
[12:25] and all the churches shall know that i
[12:27] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[12:29] hearts
[12:30] and i will give unto every one of you
[12:32] according to your works
[12:34] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[12:36] thyatira as many as have not this
[12:38] doctrine and which have not known the
[12:40] depths of satan as they speak
[12:42] i will put upon you none other burden
[12:45] but that which ye have already hold fast
[12:47] till i come
[12:49] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[12:51] works unto the end to him will i give
[12:53] power over the nations
[12:55] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[12:56] iron as the vessels of a potter shall
[12:58] they be broken to shivers even as i
[13:01] received of my father
[13:03] and i will give him the morning star he
[13:06] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[13:08] spirit saith unto the churches
[13:12] thyatira
[13:15] historically the city of thyatira was
[13:17] the least noteworthy of all the seven
[13:19] cities of the revelation
[13:21] it was situated on the confines of
[13:22] missio and ionia
[13:24] it was surrounded by many rivers but
[13:26] they were full of leeches
[13:28] its most commendable feature was that it
[13:30] was well-off financially due to the
[13:32] corporate guilds of potter's tanners
[13:34] weavers dyers road makers etc
[13:37] it was from this city that lydia the
[13:39] seller of purple came
[13:41] she was paul's first european convert
[13:45] now the reason that the spirit chose
[13:47] this city as the one already containing
[13:49] the spiritual elements for the fourth
[13:50] age was because of its religion
[13:53] the major religion of thyatira was the
[13:56] worship of apollo tyram naos
[13:58] which was joined with the emperor
[14:00] worship cult
[14:01] apollo was the sun god and the next in
[14:03] power to his father zeus
[14:05] he was known as the averter of evil
[14:08] he presided over religious law and
[14:10] expiation means of atonement making
[14:12] amends for wrongdoing or guilt
[14:15] plato said of him
[14:17] he explains to men the institution of
[14:18] temples sacrifices and services to
[14:21] deities
[14:22] besides rights connected with death and
[14:24] after life
[14:26] he communicated his knowledge of the
[14:28] future and his father's will to man
[14:31] through the prophets and oracles
[14:33] in thyatira this ritual was conducted by
[14:35] a prophetess who sat on a tripod chair
[14:37] and delivered the messages while
[14:39] entranced
[14:40] the hold of this religion was remarkable
[14:43] its formidable power did not lie
[14:45] exclusively in the realm of mystery but
[14:47] lay in the fact no one could belong to
[14:49] the guilds which offered the people
[14:51] their living unless they belong to the
[14:53] temple worship of apollo
[14:55] anyone who refused to join in the
[14:57] idolatrous feasts and licentious orgies
[15:00] was barred from these first century
[15:01] unions
[15:02] in order to be a part of the social and
[15:04] commercial life one had to be a
[15:06] practicing pagan idolater
[15:09] it is most worthy of note that the very
[15:11] name thyatira means
[15:13] dominating female
[15:15] thus this age is characterized by a
[15:17] dominant force a force that ruthlessly
[15:20] invades all conquers all and
[15:22] despotically controls
[15:24] now a dominating female is the greatest
[15:26] curse in the world
[15:27] the wisest man the world ever saw was
[15:30] solomon and he said
[15:32] i applied my heart to know and to search
[15:34] and to seek out wisdom and the reason of
[15:37] things and to know the wickedness of
[15:39] folly even a foolishness and madness
[15:42] and i find more bitter than death the
[15:44] woman whose heart is snares and nets and
[15:47] her hands as bands
[15:49] who so pleaseth god shall escape from
[15:51] her
[15:52] but the sinner shall be taken by her
[15:55] behold this i have found saith the
[15:56] preacher counting one by one to find out
[15:59] the account which yet my soul seeketh
[16:01] but i find not
[16:03] one man amongst a thousand have i found
[16:06] but a woman among all those have i not
[16:08] found
[16:10] ecclesiastes 7 25-28
[16:14] paul said
[16:15] i suffer not a woman to teach or to
[16:17] usurp authority
[16:19] from the garden of eden onward woman has
[16:22] constantly and successfully tried to
[16:23] take control over the man
[16:25] and right today it is a woman's world
[16:27] with the goddess of america being a
[16:29] naked female
[16:31] as the female idol falling out of the
[16:33] skies remember her arms were iron bars
[16:35] characterized the first or ephesian age
[16:38] so her power has grown until she has
[16:40] gained absolute authority such authority
[16:43] being usurped by her iron disposition
[16:46] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[16:48] disposition she is according to the holy
[16:51] scripture to be submissive to the male
[16:54] that is commanded of her
[16:56] woman who is truly female all female
[16:59] will be of that disposition
[17:01] not a doormat
[17:02] no real male makes a female a doormat
[17:06] but she will want to be under authority
[17:07] and not rule over the mail for he is the
[17:10] head of the house
[17:12] if she breaks that image that god made
[17:14] for her she is perverted
[17:16] any male that lets the woman take
[17:17] authority has also broken that image and
[17:19] he is perverted
[17:21] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[17:23] which pertaineth to a man or cut her
[17:25] hair
[17:26] she is never to wear garments that
[17:27] pertain to a male or cut her hair
[17:30] when she does she is intruding into the
[17:33] male domain taking authority and
[17:34] perverting herself
[17:36] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[17:38] which it is commanded she must not do
[17:41] she shows what spirit she is of
[17:44] being a dominating female is antichrist
[17:46] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[17:48] church are in her though she may deny
[17:50] this ever so vehemently
[17:52] but when it comes to the word
[17:54] let god be true and every man's word a
[17:57] lie
[17:58] amen
[18:00] let us go back to the beginning
[18:02] in the original physical creation as we
[18:04] know it today
[18:06] god made everything in pairs male and
[18:08] female there were two chickens rooster
[18:11] and hen
[18:12] there were two cattle the cow and the
[18:14] bull
[18:15] and right down the line
[18:17] but when it came to man there was only
[18:19] one they were not a pair
[18:21] adam had been made in the image of god
[18:24] he was a son of god
[18:26] as a son of god he could not be tempted
[18:28] and fall
[18:29] that would be impossible
[18:31] so god took a byproduct of man to cause
[18:33] the fall
[18:34] woman never stepped fresh from the hand
[18:36] of god as a true product of god
[18:39] she was produced from man
[18:41] and when god caused her to be brought
[18:43] forth from man she was vastly different
[18:45] from the other females he had created
[18:47] she was able to be seduced
[18:49] no other female in creation can be
[18:51] immoral but the human female may be
[18:54] touched at almost any time
[18:56] and that weakness in her allowed satan
[18:58] to seduce her by way of the serpent and
[19:00] has brought the woman to a very peculiar
[19:02] position before god and his word
[19:05] she is the type of all things vulgar
[19:08] foul and loathsome on the one hand
[19:10] and on the other hand she is the type of
[19:12] all things clean and beautiful and holy
[19:14] as the receptacle of the spirit and
[19:16] blessings of god
[19:18] on the one hand she is called the
[19:21] who is drunk with the wine of her
[19:22] fornications
[19:24] on the other she is called the bride of
[19:25] christ
[19:27] on one hand she is called mystery
[19:29] babylon the abomination before god
[19:32] and on the other hand she is called new
[19:33] jerusalem our mother
[19:36] on the one hand she is so foul and
[19:38] wicked and blue that she is summarily
[19:40] cast into the lake of fire as the only
[19:42] fit place for her
[19:44] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[19:46] heaven sharing the very throne of god as
[19:48] the only place befitting such a
[19:51] and in this dietary and church age she
[19:54] is a dominating female she is mystery
[19:57] babylon she is the great she is
[20:00] jezebel the false prophetess
[20:02] why
[20:03] because the true female is submissive to
[20:05] god
[20:06] christ is her head
[20:08] she has no word but his no thoughts but
[20:10] his no leadership but his
[20:13] but what about this church
[20:15] she has cast out the word destroyed the
[20:17] bibles and worthy essays of the godly
[20:20] she has slain those who would preach the
[20:22] truth
[20:23] she has taken over kings princes and
[20:25] nations controls armies and insists that
[20:28] she is the true body of christ
[20:30] and that her popes are the vicars of
[20:32] christ
[20:33] is entirely seduced by the devil until
[20:35] she in turn has become the seducer of
[20:37] others
[20:38] she is the bride of satan and has
[20:40] produced his bastard child religions
[20:44] all through the dark ages she has
[20:45] dominated for over 900 years she
[20:49] plundered and destroyed
[20:50] she killed the arts destroyed the
[20:52] sciences produced nothing but death
[20:55] until the light of the truth was almost
[20:56] entirely gone and only the barest sliver
[20:59] of light remained
[21:01] the oil and the wine had almost ceased
[21:03] to flow
[21:05] but though she dominated the world
[21:06] kingdoms and demanded that all men find
[21:08] their citizenship in her
[21:10] there was a little group who belonged to
[21:12] god
[21:13] and their citizenship was in heaven and
[21:15] them she could not destroy
[21:17] god kept his little flock
[21:19] they could not be destroyed
[21:21] this church of rome was as heathen and
[21:23] wicked as queen aphalia who tried to
[21:26] destroy all the royal seed and almost
[21:28] succeeded
[21:29] but god preserved one
[21:32] and of him there came more of the
[21:33] faithful
[21:34] so god preserved a little flock in that
[21:36] long dark night and of their truth there
[21:39] finally arose a luther
[21:42] anyone who knows anything at all about
[21:44] the roman catholic church and its form
[21:46] of worship can tell why the city of
[21:48] thyatira was chosen by the spirit to
[21:50] represent the church in the dark ages
[21:53] there it is right before our eyes
[21:57] the age
[21:59] the thyatirian age lasted the longest of
[22:02] them all about 900 years from 606 to
[22:05] 1520
[22:08] the messenger
[22:11] the church had long been split into two
[22:13] groups western and eastern
[22:15] every now and then a reformer would
[22:17] arise in either or both divisions and
[22:19] for a while lead some segment of the
[22:21] church into a deeper relationship with
[22:23] god
[22:24] such a man in the west was francis of
[22:26] assisi
[22:27] truly successful for a time his work was
[22:30] finally put under by the hierarchy of
[22:32] rome
[22:33] peter waldo of lyon
[22:35] a merchant who renounced his secular
[22:36] life became very active in serving the
[22:39] lord and drew many unto him
[22:41] but he was thwarted in his work and
[22:42] excommunicated by the pope
[22:45] neither the western or the eastern
[22:47] groups had within them a man who could
[22:49] possibly be the messenger to this age
[22:50] when examined in the light of scripture
[22:53] however there were two men in the
[22:54] british isles whose ministry in word and
[22:57] deed could stand the test of truth
[23:00] they were saint patrick and saint
[23:02] columba
[23:03] it was to saint columba that the lot of
[23:05] being the messenger
[23:06] fell though the messenger to the
[23:09] thiatarian age was saint columba i want
[23:11] to dwell a little on the life of saint
[23:13] patrick as an example to us and also to
[23:16] give the lie to rome's claim that st
[23:18] patrick was any more one of her than was
[23:20] joan of arc patrick was born to the
[23:23] sister of saint martin in the little
[23:25] town of bonavern on the banks of the
[23:26] river clyde
[23:28] one day while playing on the shoreline
[23:30] with his two sisters
[23:32] pirates approached and kidnapped all
[23:34] three
[23:35] where the sisters went no one knows but
[23:38] patrick his name was sucket
[23:40] was sold to a chieftain in northern
[23:42] ireland his duty was to tend the swine
[23:45] to do this he trained dogs
[23:47] so well trained were his dogs that many
[23:50] people came from far and near to buy
[23:52] them
[23:52] in his loneliness he turned to god and
[23:54] was saved
[23:56] then came the urgent desire to escape
[23:58] and return home to his parents
[24:00] he formed a plan that put his ability as
[24:02] a trainer to great use he taught the
[24:04] dogs to lie on him and cover his body
[24:06] carefully and not move until commanded
[24:09] thus one day when his owner sold several
[24:11] dogs patrick commanded the dogs except
[24:14] the leader of the pack to get into the
[24:16] boat
[24:17] the leader of the pack to which he then
[24:18] gave a secret signal ran off and refused
[24:21] to come aboard
[24:23] while the master and the buyer attempted
[24:24] to get the dog
[24:26] patrick got into the boat and signaled
[24:28] the dogs to cover him
[24:30] then with the whistle he brought the
[24:31] leader of the pack into the boat and on
[24:33] top of him
[24:34] since patrick was nowhere to be seen the
[24:37] buyer put up sale and moved out to sea
[24:40] after making sure that the captain was
[24:42] too far out to turn back patrick gave
[24:44] another signal to the dogs which caused
[24:46] them to riot
[24:48] then he came forth and told the captain
[24:50] that unless he would put him ashore at
[24:52] his home he would command the dogs to
[24:54] keep rioting and he would take over the
[24:56] ship
[24:57] however the captain was a christian and
[24:59] when he heard the boy's story he gladly
[25:01] put him ashore at his home
[25:03] there patrick went to bible school and
[25:05] returned to ireland whereby the word and
[25:08] the power of god in many signs and
[25:09] wonders he won thousands to the lord
[25:13] at no time did he ever go to rome nor at
[25:15] any time was he commissioned by rome the
[25:17] truth of the matter is that when rome
[25:19] finally gained a foothold on the island
[25:21] and when they saw the time was opportune
[25:24] they killed over 100 000 christians who
[25:27] had over the years grown out of the
[25:28] original group that had come to the lord
[25:30] under saint patrick
[25:32] about 60 years after the death of saint
[25:34] patrick columba was born in county
[25:36] donegal
