[20:47] [Music]
[20:51] good morning sent seem like all I'm
[20:55] doing is testified these days but you
[20:58] have to do that because it's a Word of
[21:00] God
[21:02] I just want to testify about something
[21:04] that happened yesterday and also maybe
[21:06] encourage somebody I think many of us
[21:10] know I've done that you know to where
[21:12] you know where I'm just gonna run to the
[21:14] story and then you leave the stove on
[21:16] so yesterday I left I was living the
[21:20] house I was cooking and there's
[21:23] something I do on the side you know
[21:25] there's a little part-time job at doing
[21:26] that but he usually coming on on my
[21:29] phone you know you know if I mean yeah
[21:31] you have order so I can choose to do it
[21:33] or not and one came and it was a pretty
[21:37] good money so I said well I'm gonna pick
[21:39] up this one I'm gonna go and take care
[21:41] of this my older son Jeremiah went to
[21:44] see his friends so you're just the twins
[21:46] with me adilyn and his brother jr. so
[21:50] jr. was taking a shower so I said to
[21:54] Adeline let's go
[21:55] well she said no that we have to wait on
[21:58] my brother because you know he's almost
[22:01] ready I said we know
[22:02] let's go you know just gonna run and
[22:03] when I come back you know he can stay by
[22:05] himself you know there is less weight on
[22:06] him so we're on him you know so we left
[22:09] I thought I'd turn off everything on the
[22:11] stove because I was cooking but I was
[22:14] doing that something was coming my mind
[22:16] I said a better forgot one of them I did
[22:18] not turn rough come to find that it was
[22:21] true I get a call later on you know and
[22:23] the fire department had to come in and
[22:26] bust my door you know because you know
[22:27] apparently those is smoke you know but I
[22:31] didn't know what really went on you know
[22:33] till I got home so when I got a call in
[22:35] all this all along I was just thinking
[22:38] for the worse I say I hope it's not bad
[22:40] I hope he's not bad I hope he's not bad
[22:42] you know and I want to pick up Jeremiah
[22:45] from his friend you know and they know
[22:46] go home and I thank God he was not bad
[22:49] at all he was not bad at all I mean
[22:51] there was no any damage the only thing
[22:53] you can
[22:54] he does you know the smoke you know
[22:56] something burning you know they just
[22:57] have to bust one side of the door you
[23:00] know and it's fixable so but one of the
[23:04] things that you know I want to encourage
[23:06] everybody know we just moved to this new
[23:09] place by the months ago but since I've
[23:11] been the message you know since I was
[23:13] really not
[23:13] I mean the true God I call it you know
[23:15] who's really know God you know
[23:18] everywhere I move you know I always get
[23:20] my pastor to come and bless the house I
[23:22] always dedicate my house you know to the
[23:24] Lord you know so this new place even
[23:26] know we have not been there for a for a
[23:28] month but you known this place was
[23:30] delicate you know - God you know and his
[23:33] servant kami know and pray for this
[23:35] house so I truly believe that if ma one
[23:38] of my son or my daughter stay behind I
[23:40] don't know what will happen because they
[23:41] don't know how to turn off the stove but
[23:43] you know you're just aggressive God you
[23:45] know and the energy of the Lord you know
[23:47] always you know what your place even
[23:49] when you know there and you always you
[23:51] know try to do the right thing you know
[23:52] play as a family pray in the morning I
[23:54] just want to encourage anybody who don't
[23:56] do those things known to always you know
[23:58] make sure when you get a new place you
[23:59] know you're moving to somewhere even
[24:01] know you pray you already dedicate
[24:02] yourself know but get your pastor or
[24:04] somebody know to come you know and pray
[24:06] you know for for you for you for your
[24:08] place because that's what Solomon did
[24:10] you know his temple you dedicate that to
[24:12] to the Lord so that's just what I wanted
[24:15] to share with you because I don't know
[24:16] what will happen you know I mean that
[24:18] other just the grace of God I mean
[24:20] because you know one of them was gonna
[24:21] stay on that was not my plan because I
[24:23] knew I was just gonna go and in combat
[24:27] praise God amen praise the Lord

[49:21] by the weight of announcement I got a
[49:23] text message I think there is an
[49:26] instruction in the fellowship that we
[49:29] wanted to have down in Winnebago with
[49:32] sister and Jackie and sister now I mean

[49:48] so I want to I want to I really want to
[49:54] trust the Lord this morning to be able
[49:57] to do something and let me start like
[50:02] this I think it will help me and let's
[50:07] go to first Kings chapter 2 verse 4
[50:11] first Kings chapter 2 verse 4 and like I
[50:20] said there are three senses that came
[50:22] with the fall and wish of course many of
[50:26] them came also with the fall but it's
[50:30] being curious and anxious and afraid and
[50:34] that's how I feel this morning I'm
[50:36] anxious to bring the message I'm afraid
[50:38] that I may mess up also I pray that the
[50:42] Lord will kind of help us this morning
[50:45] first Cain chapter 2 if I don't have my
[50:51] scripture written wrong but this was
[50:55] David talking to his son Solomon now the
[51:01] days of David drew nigh that he should
[51:05] die and he charged Solomon his son
[51:08] saying I go the way of all the earth be
[51:15] thou strong therefore and show thyself a
[51:19] man used that one time to preach a
[51:22] message but that's not what I want to
[51:24] talk about this morning then he's
[51:28] telling Solomon how he can be a man and
[51:31] keep the trash of the LORD thy God
[51:34] walk in his ways to keep his statutes
[51:37] and his commandment and his judgment and
[51:41] his testimony as it is written in a lot
[51:44] of Moses that thou may prosper in all
[51:48] that out does and were so ever they'll
[51:51] turn of their self now verse 4 that the
[51:55] Lord may continue his word which he
[51:58] speak concerning me this is David saying
[52:00] that God would continue his word Solomon
[52:03] I'm charging you my son do these things
[52:06] that God would continue his word that he
[52:08] spoke concerning me saying if that
[52:12] children take heed to their ways to walk
[52:15] before me in truth with all their heart
[52:20] and with all their soul their shanna
[52:22] filthy he said a man on the throne of
[52:27] Israel praise the Lord
[52:30] first Kings chapter 14 first Kings
[52:38] chapter 14 so David is reminding Solomon
[52:41] year that God has given him a word and
[52:46] and and we will see how their looks here
[52:50] over in in first game
[52:53] chapter 14 verse 8
[53:08] that's reversed and a few verses we want
[53:12] to read and reign the kingdom away from
[53:15] the house of David and give it to Dee
[53:17] and yet there have not been as mine 7
[53:22] David who kept my commandment and will
[53:26] follow me with all his heart to do that
[53:31] only which was right in my eyes
[53:34] God is testifying of David year that he
[53:37] followed God with all of his heart to do
[53:42] that which is right but he always did
[53:45] that which was right know he stumble
[53:51] amen
[53:52] he made mistakes but God is testifying
[53:56] of David's heart I will together
[54:01] now keep that in mind 2nd Kings chapter
[54:04] 23 verse 25 second king came 23 verse 25
[54:18] 23 verse 25 is a speaks year also of
[54:25] Josiah 23 25 if I got my scriptures
[54:33] written right and like unto Him was
[54:38] there no King before him they had turned
[54:41] to the Lord with all his heart and with
[54:46] all his soul and with all his might I
[54:51] calling to all the Lord of Moses neither
[54:56] after him rose there any like him now
[55:01] keep the scripture in mind and think
[55:03] about Solomon when when God visited
[55:08] Solomon like we said Wednesday night the
[55:11] scripture says there was there was no
[55:13] man that God gave the gift of wisdom on
[55:18] to Solomon amen
[55:21] no man before has ever risen to the
[55:25] level of the gift of wisdom are we
[55:32] together now yeah the scripture also
[55:34] testify of a desire being a man of that
[55:42] you know that that turn to the Lord over
[55:47] in the first king where we read about a
[55:51] David the scripture says he followed the
[55:55] Lord with all of his heart the scripture
[55:59] speaks here of Josiah he turned to the
[56:03] Lord with all of his heart out of his
[56:06] mind and and everything that he gave to
[56:09] the Lord let's watch another scripture
[56:11] also here 2nd chronicles chapter 22
[56:15] verse 9
[56:34] second chronicles chapter 22 verse 9 are
[56:45] we together
[56:56] and he sought our hazard and cut him for
[57:02] he was hated in Samara and brought him
[57:05] on to jail and when they have slain him
[57:09] they bury him because he said they he is
[57:15] the son of Joe Scheffer who sought the
[57:20] Lord with all his heart
[57:24] amen Joe Scheffer was the king that went
[57:28] down we a hub concerning the land and he
[57:33] had drew him into the battle and a North
[57:36] dead and the Bible says he was a garlic
[57:38] ink but see the way that the scripture
[57:42] places David followed the Lord with all
[57:45] of his heart
[57:46] Josiah turned unto the Lord with all of
[57:49] his heart
[57:51] Josefa sought the Lord with all of his
[57:55] heart now I don't think that God by
[57:59] inspiration made a mistake when he plays
[58:02] these things in the scripture
[58:05] the Bible speaks of of Hezekiah and he
[58:09] says Hezekiah trusted the Lord with all
[58:14] of his heart praise the Lord
[58:18] well I know definitely I gave you
[58:20] something to think about but I don't
[58:23] want to row my message this morning I
[58:28] definitely gives you something to think
[58:30] about but I don't want to ruin my
[58:31] message this morning but what I want to
[58:33] say there is dead
[58:35] just like we said on Wednesday night
[58:41] brother Branham said praise the Lord and
[58:46] we read over in crisis to Mister of
[58:52] glory bill where he said and that there
[58:56] are all of those prophets since notice
[58:59] now down through the ages he being
[59:01] gradually letting this out slowly
[59:05] unfolding the mystery through the
[59:07] prophets and through the
[59:10] we we can just go on and and expressing
[59:16] himself he expressed himself in Moses
[59:19] look at Moses born in a time of
[59:21] persecution of the children he was born
[59:24] as a deliverer you know and and and he
[59:26] and he went on with all of that and and
[59:31] he said this all those things type him
[59:36] Christ but yet the mystery was here then
[59:42] man the prophets didn't know what they
[59:45] were doing they only knew that they were
[59:51] led by the spirit to do something now
[59:56] holding it back in in the last days for
[1:00:00] the great revelation by expressing it
[1:00:03] now so all of these men all of these
[1:00:07] people that we just read about the Bible
[1:00:09] said they were men of like passion I
[1:00:13] believe many of us sitting here this
[1:00:16] morning has sought the Lord and when we
[1:00:19] are seeking God what about a word of
[1:00:22] Prayer or whatever way we are seeking
[1:00:24] God looking for God water in the word
[1:00:27] you know I believe with all of my heart
[1:00:31] this morning that it is not just
[1:00:33] partially we really want to know this
[1:00:35] God praising all and I believe that in
[1:00:46] some areas of our life we have trusted
[1:00:50] garden and and that's what I want to
[1:00:52] come to this morning and you know I
[1:00:55] would just say by the weight of
[1:00:56] introduction
[1:00:58] you know like brother branham said in
[1:01:00] the message he preached call you know
[1:01:04] God in his own word he says we we are
[1:01:07] coming down to a troubled times troubled
[1:01:11] waters ahead of us there are a lot of
[1:01:13] things that are going to happen as long
[1:01:15] as we stay in this life there are things
[1:01:18] that were happening surprisingly amen
[1:01:20] and
[1:01:21] and I would want to encourage you before
[1:01:23] we get into the word that I believe with
[1:01:27] all of my heart that we are at such a
[1:01:29] place work you know God has given us
[1:01:32] everything we have hurry reformers we
[1:01:36] have had men you know they have lived
[1:01:38] lives of repetition we have had you know
[1:01:42] I mean job in the Bible his testimony is
[1:01:46] a standing we have had Moses we have had
[1:01:49] people that have suffered different
[1:01:50] things we have all of these example that
[1:01:52] I mean God has given us everything and
[1:01:55] the reason why he has given us all of
[1:01:57] these things and people of example is
[1:01:59] for us to learn to trust him praise the
[1:02:04] Lord
[1:02:05] amen and they are things that we my face
[1:02:09] even right from this service or whatever
[1:02:11] it is that it would be hard to explain
[1:02:15] but sometimes God would allow those
[1:02:18] things because you want us to trust him
[1:02:21] praise the Lord
[1:02:23] amen are we ready to trust the Lord are
[1:02:29] we going to trust him with all of our
[1:02:30] heart praise the Lord
[1:02:33] the Bible says Hezekiah trusted the Lord
[1:02:36] with all of his heart and you see in the
[1:02:39] lives of all of this man David father
[1:02:41] the law with all of his heart but yet he
[1:02:43] had problems praise the Lord
[1:02:48] Josiah even their young king he turned I
[1:02:52] like the way the Bible says he turned
[1:02:54] all of his heart his mind his mind
[1:02:58] everything to the Lord
[1:03:00] badda bodda the the the Lord of Moses
[1:03:07] fresh alone but go back and read the
[1:03:12] life of Josiah and see when he came to
[1:03:16] his letter - that things to happen
[1:03:22] praise the Lord
[1:03:28] jellow Shefford he sucked the Lord with
[1:03:33] all of his heart but yet when it came on
[1:03:36] making a decision to go to go with a HAP
[1:03:39] there was there was some level of
[1:03:41] sympathy because after all the land of
[1:03:45] remedy de was was for Israel go back to
[1:03:49] the book of Joshua that was one of the
[1:03:51] city of refuge so Ahab was not wrong to
[1:03:58] want to take God's land back or take the
[1:04:01] land of the children of Israel it's just
[1:04:03] that he was not the right person praise
[1:04:10] the Lord
[1:04:10] but because we are a social place and
[1:04:13] time and you had this thing with people
[1:04:16] I trusted God I trusted God how can this
[1:04:19] happen to me I mean I've been saving the
[1:04:22] Lord out of my life how can this happen
[1:04:24] to me how are we together read this with
[1:04:36] me a man running away from the presence
[1:04:40] of the Lord that's what I want to kind
[1:04:42] of lay mine mine inspiration this
[1:04:46] morning sometime something like I was
[1:04:52] told one time that a lady said back back
[1:05:00] in the her summer Kadesh said the hearse
[1:05:07] run away with her going from church now
[1:05:10] this is going from church this is after
[1:05:14] service she got into her chair and sat
[1:05:19] on her chariot and it just kept running
[1:05:21] I mean the hearse went mad praise the
[1:05:26] Lord
[1:05:28] the hearse run away wave her going from
[1:05:32] church said what did you do
[1:05:37] she said I trusted a lord until the line
[1:05:42] broke well that's the time to trust the
[1:05:48] Lord not until after because many of the
[1:05:53] time while we say we are trusting God is
[1:05:57] because we are holding to something in a
[1:06:02] slide when we don't see that thing
[1:06:03] anymore
[1:06:04] then then where is God where is God amen
[1:06:14] we have something we have maybe a loved
[1:06:17] one maybe we have a job or maybe you
[1:06:22] know what there is a church or you know
[1:06:25] somebody that we are looking up tall
[1:06:27] something we are holding and as long as
[1:06:31] we have that thing to our great we can
[1:06:35] say go on with the trials and and
[1:06:38] troubles but when it caught can you stay
[1:06:44] trust God I mean can you still trust God
[1:06:54] when your health goes bad can you trust
[1:06:57] God when you lost the job can you trust
[1:07:00] God when your marriage get into a mess
[1:07:03] can you trust God I trusted the Lord
[1:07:12] until the lamb broke well that's the
[1:07:15] time to trust the Lord
[1:07:17] after the lamb broke you are trusting in
[1:07:22] the line until it breaks
[1:07:33] how would you get it
[1:07:39] let me read another quote here from the
[1:07:43] church
[1:07:44] each book just I just pray that the logo
[1:07:48] will help me now I knew that you know
[1:07:52] the Lord will be able to bless us who
[1:07:54] have had so much trouble you know just
[1:07:57] being able to find timing and ready
[1:07:59] steady and pray with the different
[1:08:01] things that were happening you know but
[1:08:08] our God is faithful
[1:08:09] amen but BAM says here in the church age
[1:08:13] box listen to this he says have you ever
[1:08:15] noticed how sit on hit toolbox in the
[1:08:18] Bible more than all others amen
[1:08:24] true liberal theologian in pesos
[1:08:28] scientists is always attacking the book
[1:08:31] of Genesis in the book of Revelation in
[1:08:34] Bocca be in both of these books we find
[1:08:36] set on origin his awful ways in his
[1:08:39] destruction that is why he attacked him
[1:08:43] he hate to be a sports and in those book
[1:08:47] he is exposed for exactly what he is
[1:08:53] jesus said about Satan he has no part in
[1:08:59] me and I have no part in him and if that
[1:09:04] was true for Jesus that is also true for
[1:09:07] every child of God he has no part in us
[1:09:13] that does not concern this body amen oh
[1:09:18] yeah because a tutor of this body this
[1:09:23] this belongs to him is of the dust its
[1:09:27] breda between the seven and Eve but when
[1:09:30] Jesus said he had no part in me praise
[1:09:37] the Lord
[1:09:37] because we are live we are in an age
[1:09:40] that had reduced God to material things
[1:09:44] people want to see God when they see
[1:09:47] money or they see frame the seed and see
[1:09:50] that they see well they see material
[1:09:52] things around him that's when he can see
[1:09:55] God are we together
[1:10:07] he has no party meaning I have no part
[1:10:10] in him the devil would like to prove
[1:10:14] their difference but he cannot so he
[1:10:20] does all he can to destroy confidence
[1:10:27] amen and this word confidence means
[1:10:31] trust to destroy trust in the word
[1:10:43] I mean to destroy trust that's all he
[1:10:50] tried to do if he can get to the place
[1:10:56] word he can destroy your trust in what
[1:11:00] gods were saying praise the Lord and to
[1:11:07] know that by the Word of God the
[1:11:09] universe was created so if your trust is
[1:11:12] destroyed in it you will not believe
[1:11:13] nothing there is nothing left for you to
[1:11:16] believe
[1:11:24] so you try to destroy confidence in the
[1:11:29] word but when the when the church
[1:11:33] disbelieves sitting and believe the
[1:11:37] spirit of revelation of the word of God
[1:11:40] the gifts of Hell cannot prevail against
[1:11:43] her now so we can go right back to the
[1:11:47] beginning let's go back to Genesis and I
[1:11:50] will show you where the devil destroyed
[1:11:56] a trust in God's Word for he she said
[1:12:01] God said I were together Genesis chapter
[1:12:06] 3 and the second was more soft I than
[1:12:17] any beast of the field which the Lord
[1:12:18] God had made and he said unto the woman
[1:12:22] yea hath God said ye shall not eat of
[1:12:26] every tree of the garden and the woman
[1:12:29] said unto the 7 we may eat of the fruit
[1:12:34] of the tree of the garden but of the
[1:12:36] fruit of the tree which is in the mists
[1:12:39] of the garden God have said the word of
[1:12:41] God that was God's Word amen
[1:12:49] that was God's Word go have said Genesis
[1:12:57] chapter 2 verse 16 and a Lord God
[1:13:00] commanded man saying of every tree of
[1:13:03] the garden thou may freely eat but of
[1:13:08] the tree of the knowledge good and evil
[1:13:11] thou shalt not eat of it for the day for
[1:13:17] in the day that thou eat the of thou
[1:13:21] shalt surely die they were giving Terry
[1:13:23] nine words to keep amen
[1:13:31] they were given today nine worse when
[1:13:35] sit on pole not there thou shalt not
[1:13:37] daddy became 40 the number of temptation
[1:13:44] so year that was God's Word now Eve is
[1:13:48] repeating what she had heard from the
[1:13:50] world what her pastor to her amen she's
[1:13:56] repeating it the woman said unto the
[1:13:58] serpent we may eat of all the fruit of
[1:14:00] the tree of the garden but of the fruit
[1:14:03] in that the fruit of the tree which is
[1:14:07] in the midst of the garden God hath said
[1:14:09] ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:14:13] touch at least yet dying
[1:14:16] amen and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:14:19] ye shall not surely die that was the
[1:14:27] line are we together amen
[1:14:31] but see what it did for God does know
[1:14:37] that in the day ye did off for God does
[1:14:42] know and what that shows there is there
[1:14:46] but there is something he never told you
[1:14:53] because there was the thing that woke up
[1:14:56] Eve curiosity whoa what is it for God
[1:15:00] does know and that is the thing there
[1:15:06] destroy trust amen when a person feel
[1:15:13] that something is being healed from him
[1:15:16] most of the time in relationship and
[1:15:19] business amen and when I feel that my
[1:15:25] business partner is hiding something
[1:15:27] from me a distraught trust Amen most of
[1:15:36] the time that's the trouble in
[1:15:38] relationship when a person feels that
[1:15:40] this person is hiding something from
[1:15:42] them
[1:15:44] a distraught trust so that was what that
[1:15:47] they will use to destroy Eve trust in
[1:15:51] the world God knows he never told you
[1:15:57] everything there's something that he's
[1:16:00] hiding from you
[1:16:08] but even if he does not tell us why we
[1:16:12] had to go through the sickness or go
[1:16:15] through this can we stay trust him
[1:16:19] can we stay trust him
[1:16:29] because most of the time we have come to
[1:16:32] to such an age where we have in all the
[1:16:36] right and the right to know we have in
[1:16:41] all the right and the right to know
[1:16:49] so we even want to bring God down we
[1:16:53] want we want to lower him down to our
[1:16:56] society standard that God you all mean
[1:16:59] the right to know and because you're not
[1:17:06] letting me know I don't trust you
[1:17:08] anymore why may people back up on God go
[1:17:17] call on God they go dead on God because
[1:17:22] they feel dead they had they have the
[1:17:25] right to know
[1:17:30] ancestors calm the right to Norma
[1:17:33] ancestors DNA the right to know my
[1:17:37] bloodline
[1:17:47] price alone am I sound funny to you but
[1:17:55] it's a serious issue it's a serious
[1:18:00] issue and this is the way with God and
[1:18:06] that's this is the way he approached it
[1:18:08] when God made man the reason why he
[1:18:12] never told Adam everything because he
[1:18:14] trusted him oh yeah the prophet of God
[1:18:21] said he trusts us more than we trust
[1:18:23] ourselves
[1:18:28] praise the Lord so it was to him he his
[1:18:36] trust level is established because his
[1:18:41] confidence his trust the very substance
[1:18:46] of trust is God himself
[1:18:54] praise the Lord Satan tried to destroy
[1:19:00] the confidence and when it's gone is
[1:19:06] gone it's hard
[1:19:15] it's hard when it's gone is hard it's
[1:19:20] hard to wrap your mind around it
[1:19:29] that is the reason why we have in you
[1:19:32] know I mean it's almost like the floor
[1:19:35] of north of Davos cases praise the Lord
[1:19:41] because the verified of people
[1:19:45] establishing the fact to trust God they
[1:19:51] don't want to trust the Creator yet they
[1:19:54] want to trust somebody to spend the rest
[1:19:57] of their life wave amen the Creator that
[1:20:04] may you amazing ancestors of that person
[1:20:07] know their genetics and everything that
[1:20:09] rub down their bloodline we don't want
[1:20:11] to trust him but we want to trust this
[1:20:16] stranger that just appear like I was
[1:20:21] talking about Epsilon I went back and I
[1:20:23] started studying on it a little bit
[1:20:25] because I don't know how I got caught up
[1:20:26] in that Wednesday night so I went back
[1:20:29] and I started reading a little bit on
[1:20:30] that and and and and I realized the
[1:20:36] other you know I was I was honor my
[1:20:38] inspiration and I read the scripture I
[1:20:43] don't even know where I wrote down
[1:20:44] because I wrote a bunch of Scripture
[1:20:45] there on Absalom and the Bible talks
[1:20:47] about it you know a place word you know
[1:20:51] the way he faced his head and I was just
[1:20:53] thinking about it I said he might be
[1:20:55] looking like a smart businessman maybe
[1:20:57] there was coming the one way amen and
[1:21:03] the Bible says that the people love
[1:21:06] absolutely men yeah he was able to win
[1:21:10] the heart of the people praise the Lord
[1:21:16] but that's that's where we are that's
[1:21:21] where the word is that's why we have all
[1:21:24] the trouble we have in the world today
[1:21:30] because we will not trust our maker
[1:21:36] science want to create a sane to let us
[1:21:39] to know we came from somewhere and when
[1:21:45] we cannot rightly establish where we
[1:21:49] came from how can we even trust our very
[1:21:51] existence how can we trust our existence
[1:21:58] how much do you believe that you're not
[1:22:00] dreaming this morning you really believe
[1:22:02] you in church do you believe that you
[1:22:07] sure you believe it it's not a dream
[1:22:13] praise the Lord I think you dreaming
[1:22:18] I really think you dreaming
[1:22:22] maybe you just need to bite yourself how
[1:22:28] can we how can we trust our existence
[1:22:33] how can we trust there will be a
[1:22:35] tomorrow if we try to ignore the fat of
[1:22:43] trusting and believing in the invisible
[1:22:47] God praise the Lord
[1:22:53] the reason why we trust to be here this
[1:22:57] morning because we know he would be here
[1:23:01] amen praise the Lord that's the thing
[1:23:05] that brings us here that's the thing
[1:23:06] that brings us with three hours of sleep
[1:23:10] four hours of sleep tile our busy
[1:23:12] weekend but yet we can drag our ball a
[1:23:15] year because we know that he will be
[1:23:17] here we know that he is a living God
[1:23:20] it's not just a religion we know that
[1:23:26] he's real
[1:23:37] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[1:23:45] that's what Solomon says trust in the
[1:23:50] Lord with all your heart he leaned that
[1:23:56] on to your own understanding praise the
[1:24:02] Lord
[1:24:03] like I said leaning onto an
[1:24:06] understanding it's not wrong when is
[1:24:07] your own understanding and that's why
[1:24:10] you have to check it up amen because
[1:24:16] that word lame also in the Greek means
[1:24:19] to trust when you are leaning on
[1:24:22] something you are trusting on it
[1:24:31] can we trust God can we trust praise the
[1:24:44] Lord
[1:24:45] young people
[1:24:52] can we trust God for a future
[1:25:03] can we trust call for the future when
[1:25:09] people look at in that I mean filled
[1:25:11] your mind with with with all the things
[1:25:14] that Holly will present them you know
[1:25:16] when it when they make their love movie
[1:25:19] they never pull nothing ugly be it's all
[1:25:24] centered around emotions amen
[1:25:28] emotion and that's what is he and that's
[1:25:32] what young people run into when you come
[1:25:36] right out of from the Georges office
[1:25:38] they start costing one another and they
[1:25:43] drive to separate different times
[1:25:55] can we trust God where BAM said this he
[1:25:59] says this he says some time ago there
[1:26:01] was a woman a Christian Science woman
[1:26:05] trusted the Lord for her baby and it
[1:26:10] died in California or across the nation
[1:26:13] within 24 hour time every paper magazine
[1:26:19] I'll be a little bit personal with this
[1:26:22] every paper magazine all you see you see
[1:26:26] what I mean you see what I mean
[1:26:29] divine healing you can trust it see what
[1:26:35] is it that's what it does that baby died
[1:26:39] well they they are always trying to
[1:26:43] point somebody to someone who went a
[1:26:47] little too far and they never think
[1:26:51] about the time that that didn't go for
[1:26:57] enough less than theirs and all saying
[1:27:00] and and I don't mean to I don't mean it
[1:27:04] for an expression of base I mean but
[1:27:09] sauce for the goose is is it's for you
[1:27:12] know all you all folks and all those
[1:27:14] things but what what what what drew my
[1:27:18] mind to this is there even right right
[1:27:23] around this message brother
[1:27:27] but Rachel cops used to be in Oregon his
[1:27:31] son pastored a church there now you say
[1:27:34] he was all all preacher he came from the
[1:27:39] days of the of the revival he hangs out
[1:27:41] with a allele and over rubbers in all
[1:27:44] those different man he was a strong
[1:27:46] believer in divine healing brother
[1:27:50] brother Lonnie said he was not going to
[1:27:52] give his body to chemo he trusted God
[1:27:56] for His healing a man that preached
[1:27:59] healing he pray for the sake and God
[1:28:01] healed people he trusted God for His
[1:28:04] healing and yet he died it pleased the
[1:28:06] Lord to take him by the way of of
[1:28:07] sickness
[1:28:08] and those things were even trouble in
[1:28:12] their family its trembles some of them
[1:28:20] yeah it's tumble some of them some of
[1:28:25] the family members struggle with they're
[1:28:26] not not only damaged I just mentioned
[1:28:31] because those are familiar names and you
[1:28:38] find people some of them they're not
[1:28:41] even saving God they don't respect God's
[1:28:46] Word they don't respect God's laws but
[1:28:49] when there is a little trouble like a
[1:28:50] health situation of a child or something
[1:28:53] it's all God and you know I trust in God
[1:28:55] and I need all the prayers and this that
[1:28:58] and then when it pleased God to take
[1:29:00] what God gave when a please go to take
[1:29:04] what he gave then they get angry I can
[1:29:12] trust this God there is nothing like
[1:29:19] this God praise the Lord
[1:29:32] I think we need to we need God to help
[1:29:35] us he followed the law with all of his
[1:29:43] heart he still had troubles amen but you
[1:29:47] see his trouble never took him away from
[1:29:49] God his trouble brought him more closer
[1:29:51] after he had trouble that was when he
[1:29:54] saw God more because he knew that I'm
[1:29:57] giving go out of my heart how come that
[1:30:00] I find myself in the situation which
[1:30:03] mean I need to give him what I'm not
[1:30:08] giving to him
[1:30:19] Hezekiah trusted the Lord he sought the
[1:30:26] Lord and fist the world and God came
[1:30:28] down giving you 15 years and what he did
[1:30:34] in the early there a few years that God
[1:30:36] gave him he brought the Babylonians and
[1:30:40] exposed them to the treasure of God and
[1:30:42] the Prophet came right there and says
[1:30:44] now said the Lord you have turned Israel
[1:30:47] over to Babylon on their way they would
[1:30:49] go but this would not happen in your
[1:30:54] time praise the Lord
[1:31:01] but what happened it has a tyre back up
[1:31:04] and says how can God do this to me how
[1:31:07] can God do this to my children out of
[1:31:09] those Old Testament prophet whenever
[1:31:12] that comes to that place when they have
[1:31:15] trust God and something goes wrong it
[1:31:17] make them to trust God more it make them
[1:31:19] to get them and repent in a chase a
[1:31:27] bunch of arrogant people around the
[1:31:30] Christian faith they just arrogant just
[1:31:32] proud people that were not even spend a
[1:31:37] day with God they were not even spend
[1:31:41] ten minutes with God let things go
[1:31:43] strong they'll open your mouth and it
[1:31:45] was a blasphemous thing out of their
[1:31:47] lips
[1:32:04] praise the Lord
[1:32:12] you
[1:32:14] trust the Lord with all of your high
[1:32:25] we're just thinking about Joe Scheffer
[1:32:27] when I read that scripture the Bible
[1:32:31] says he sought the Lord and some of us
[1:32:37] we are at that place we are seeking God
[1:32:40] but you know the danger there is there
[1:32:42] for you to limit God because you got a
[1:32:46] King James Bible all because you got a
[1:32:54] summer book in your hands that's Emma
[1:32:58] book or this Bible is just there to make
[1:33:01] God more real to you it's just there to
[1:33:05] have you draw closer to God because God
[1:33:08] want to be more than a book he want to
[1:33:11] be a person he want to be personal he
[1:33:20] don't want to be a history God that we
[1:33:22] can print to and he want to be a present
[1:33:24] tense God that is right here now in
[1:33:27] being can we trust God for our children
[1:33:42] can we trust him for our children our
[1:33:44] loved ones praise the Lord old brother
[1:33:53] Hara bacod
[1:33:54] he says love is blind it receive His
[1:33:56] sight when he gets married
[1:34:04] that's better baked it
[1:34:10] he's in love is blind Lord receive his
[1:34:14] eyes when he gets married
[1:34:18] you see when when when we do things when
[1:34:22] we make choices not trust in God when
[1:34:28] problem comes we don't know how to trust
[1:34:30] him because you never started by
[1:34:33] trusting God
[1:34:36] maybe you were trusting some kind of a
[1:34:39] beauty shining teeth gold teeth when we
[1:34:45] when we need to be trusting God if you
[1:34:53] don't start trusting God you will know
[1:34:56] how to trust him the rest of the way
[1:35:04] praise the Lord
[1:35:09] that's Brad - tell me it's just you know
[1:35:12] it's young brother one is that you want
[1:35:15] to marry the sister and Ike the sister
[1:35:17] do you know the seven seals I said I
[1:35:28] wish I knew I wish I knew that young man
[1:35:35] praise the Lord and I also wish he never
[1:35:38] knew I was a preacher
[1:35:47] but I just I just told young people
[1:35:51] that's his war he does not deserve a
[1:35:53] daughter of God because now he's asking
[1:35:58] about seven seals tomorrow what will he
[1:36:02] be asking about tear poured seventy
[1:36:07] weeks of Daniel it just all up yet
[1:36:11] it just all up here there is no love in
[1:36:16] his heart he's a beast
[1:36:20] foolish beasts a beast I learned how to
[1:36:23] speak English Andrey English and he can
[1:36:26] be able to read but after those things
[1:36:31] are done can we trust God because
[1:36:40] sometimes you can wave all the flags and
[1:36:43] show all the signs where Benham says the
[1:36:46] man keep jumping over it every time God
[1:36:49] throw a roadblock did jump over it they
[1:36:53] have gone to all the Olympics they know
[1:36:55] how to jump but after we get there
[1:37:00] can we stay trust God praise the Lord
[1:37:10] Solomon was remembering what his father
[1:37:13] David told him he was remembering read
[1:37:19] the book of ecclesiastic an improv herb
[1:37:22] read it just just read it think about it
[1:37:26] put yourself in the pages this was a man
[1:37:35] like I said Wednesday night that was one
[1:37:38] of the things of Solomon libera BAM said
[1:37:40] God broke his mystery in all the lives
[1:37:44] of this of the prophets amen and he is
[1:37:48] fulfilling the same in our lives and one
[1:37:55] of the thing that was in Solomon life
[1:37:57] was God's hidden wisdom
[1:38:02] that is the reason why I Solomon could
[1:38:05] not ask for anything different but
[1:38:07] wisdom because that was the mystery that
[1:38:10] was hidden in his life he was not david
[1:38:18] favorite son
[1:38:19] in one sense to say it until God pointed
[1:38:23] it out
[1:38:23] go read first King a second summer
[1:38:32] chapter 13 the Bible says after the ship
[1:38:42] he had a child and the child was sick
[1:38:44] that was the child of adultery
[1:38:46] the child was saying God would take the
[1:38:49] child away David cried and David cried
[1:38:51] and David cried in and in the Lord took
[1:38:53] the child away and the Bible says after
[1:38:56] David hide and not a child by a bail
[1:39:01] Sheba year comes Nitin he steps right
[1:39:05] into the house he entered into the
[1:39:09] hospital whether it was the hospital
[1:39:10] wherever it was but where the child was
[1:39:12] born he stepped there let's read that a
[1:39:14] little bit here and see this beautiful
[1:39:18] picture beautiful picture praise the
[1:39:24] Lord it's a picture is something that
[1:39:32] you know I'd like to say many of us
[1:39:35] message believers will not do we won't
[1:39:38] go to Bathsheba to visit her in a
[1:39:40] hospital
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:49] that's chapter 12 verse 24 and David
[1:39:53] comfortable Sheba his wife and went on
[1:39:55] to harder labor for her and she bare a
[1:39:57] son and called his name Solomon for the
[1:40:01] Lord for the Lord loved him and he sent
[1:40:13] by the hand of nature and the prophet
[1:40:17] God by the hand this is how Devon knew
[1:40:21] that the Lord loved his child because
[1:40:25] God sent net on the Prophet the very man
[1:40:28] that came and condemned David in his in
[1:40:31] his Foley Nathan came stepping through
[1:40:36] the hospital door and said David I knew
[1:40:39] you have a child the Lord just spoke to
[1:40:41] me last night and he sent by the hand of
[1:40:47] nature on the Prophet and called the
[1:40:49] name of the child
[1:40:59] praise the Lord kind of amiss what I'm
[1:41:02] reading verse 25 and he's sent by the
[1:41:08] hand of nets on the prophet and called
[1:41:11] the name of the child Jedediah because
[1:41:14] of the Lord
[1:41:17] you mean that was when David started to
[1:41:22] take a close look that there was
[1:41:26] something about this child
[1:41:30] Amen that you mean Nate on the Prophet
[1:41:37] Oh step right in here right in this live
[1:41:45] was hitting a deep wisdom of God many of
[1:41:52] us will see our life right in the very
[1:41:54] same thing God's wisdom praise the Lord
[1:42:13] yeah we know the story about Solomon he
[1:42:16] built a temple the presence of the Lord
[1:42:18] came down the glory of God came down he
[1:42:22] had a successful reign
[1:42:25] Sasha wisdom that he would not even
[1:42:32] divide the child praise the Lord praise
[1:42:36] the Lord and yet people claim to have
[1:42:39] wisdom and they would use the very word
[1:42:42] of God and the divine family they would
[1:42:44] divide churches Solomon with the wisdom
[1:42:55] he would not divide a child that he will
[1:42:58] even make the woman there was not the
[1:43:01] mother to go away happy
[1:43:03] I mean who was the one that cried and
[1:43:09] said they shouldn't divide the child it
[1:43:12] was the mom praise the Lord I will
[1:43:18] rather have it the even the one that
[1:43:26] never had a child went away happy even
[1:43:31] though she was guilty but she saw the
[1:43:34] wisdom of Solomon but we claim to have
[1:43:42] wisdom and gifts in Revelation we can
[1:43:46] learn of course to cause division
[1:43:50] destroy families destroy homes
[1:43:59] but there was such a wisdom that was
[1:44:02] embedded in there man and you know how
[1:44:05] God will bring out those wisdom go how
[1:44:09] to allow Solomon to go into idolatry he
[1:44:13] had to allow Solomon to be taken away
[1:44:16] praise the Lord he never lost his gift
[1:44:19] because when he came back to God then he
[1:44:23] said I've seen everything under the Sun
[1:44:25] I have seen everything under the Sun and
[1:44:30] he said young people commit your youth
[1:44:33] to the Lord
[1:44:36] commit your youth to the Lord go hard to
[1:44:41] allow him to go into all of those things
[1:44:43] and then when he came back he started
[1:44:49] writing those things repeating the very
[1:44:54] thing that his father David told him my
[1:44:58] son trust in the Lord with all your
[1:45:02] heart praise the Lord
[1:45:09] trust in the Lord with all of your heart
[1:45:13] even if your heart don't want to trust
[1:45:17] the Lord trust the law with your heart
[1:45:20] argue with yourself but what we do we
[1:45:26] give ourself reason why we must not do
[1:45:29] right praise the Lord
[1:45:40] give us some reason and sometimes when
[1:45:45] people get to that place you you read
[1:45:47] the message are leaning out onto your
[1:45:49] own understanding verbatim says I was
[1:45:50] now I'm not encouraging you know
[1:45:54] electric say it's good he says is it
[1:45:57] going to school and degrees it's it's
[1:45:59] good for you know a good job a good
[1:46:02] paying job and different things he says
[1:46:04] but God don't want us to lean to death
[1:46:07] amen because sometimes when people has
[1:46:11] achieved and has achieved I mean it just
[1:46:14] get in their head get in your head they
[1:46:21] become arrogant to become disrespectful
[1:46:24] they are not afraid of God all the
[1:46:29] people of God praise the Lord
[1:46:33] there was this cruel man I mean very
[1:46:37] cruel wicked man somebody just like Noah
[1:46:44] there you know in the in the Bible the
[1:46:47] husband of Abigail a wealthy man but
[1:46:51] foolish until cost him his life this man
[1:47:01] was a very arrogant man I mean wealthy
[1:47:03] man and the only thing he talks about is
[1:47:07] justice wealth and how much he has until
[1:47:13] his wealth make him wicked we get to the
[1:47:19] point where he was even wicked to alter
[1:47:21] I mean it's his children his wife
[1:47:23] everything told his wife when I died you
[1:47:26] bury me with my money
[1:47:30] wrote it in his will I suffer I work for
[1:47:37] it and it was right in the hands of the
[1:47:43] attorney when he died wife the attorney
[1:47:49] came and says yeah he said you should
[1:47:50] bury him with his money she says it's no
[1:47:52] problem that his money he worked for it
[1:47:58] she went to the bank asked him to give
[1:48:05] her a check she wrote every cent he had
[1:48:09] on the cheque and lady in this coffee
[1:48:15] when you get on the other side you cash
[1:48:18] it praise the Lord
[1:48:29] people that came here when they die they
[1:48:32] can hear you know why ever you said to
[1:48:36] them they don't have choice you put them
[1:48:38] in a wooden box they can't choose I just
[1:48:44] love God he made a time where every man
[1:48:48] were yet there was down when you say one
[1:48:51] word they say five when they are lying
[1:48:53] right there you can say anything to them
[1:48:55] they would not say a word they say you
[1:49:03] wicked an arrogant man when you get on
[1:49:07] the other side cash it
[1:49:18] I'm talking about trusting God I'm
[1:49:24] talking about trusting God
[1:49:35] and that's one of the place where many
[1:49:37] of us are struggling praise the Lord
[1:49:46] because we are just like that woman we
[1:49:50] are holding on to something we are
[1:49:55] holding on to something but when he
[1:50:00] breaks can we still trust him praise the
[1:50:08] Lord you see the scripture says trust
[1:50:13] the Lord with all of your heart I mean
[1:50:18] most of the time we trust God through
[1:50:22] somebody I trust the law because I you
[1:50:25] know love of message of my pastor all
[1:50:29] this happening and like bourbon says you
[1:50:32] know right there you are holding on to
[1:50:35] their thing so actually is the thing
[1:50:37] that you are trusting but when that
[1:50:40] thing is no more when that thing is no
[1:50:46] more can we still trust God
[1:51:01] handwriting on the wall damn man today
[1:51:04] the high currently taught he did trusted
[1:51:09] the law for his healing and and he has
[1:51:13] failed to receive healing and then he
[1:51:16] become discouraged and said if I haven't
[1:51:19] got enough faith to be healed maybe I
[1:51:23] haven't got enough faith to be safe he
[1:51:30] said where sometimes we try to reduce
[1:51:32] God for and it's and it's all because
[1:51:42] sometimes we don't give ourself to learn
[1:51:46] we don't give ourselves to learn
[1:51:49] we don't give ourself to understand what
[1:51:54] God has given to us
[1:51:56] that's the salvation of the soul is far
[1:51:59] away different from the healing of the
[1:52:01] body it's two different things
[1:52:06] Amen it's two different things
[1:52:15] praise the Lord
[1:52:22] and Gauss people through the ages have
[1:52:25] have different problems in different
[1:52:27] trouble some have high I mean I mean I'm
[1:52:35] in trouble trouble listen to John Wesley
[1:52:41] when he talks about the trouble he had
[1:52:43] with his wife with all the teaching the
[1:52:50] garlic teaching his mother gave him I
[1:52:54] mean he was so he was so consumed I say
[1:52:57] young man coming up I mean he was so
[1:52:59] caught up with doing doing things for
[1:53:02] the law and and and and wanting to reach
[1:53:04] out to the world and and and you know
[1:53:06] when I mean he was so involved in the
[1:53:08] things of the Lord until he got married
[1:53:10] late in his life well yeah he was there
[1:53:15] was a house of hell but he could trust
[1:53:21] God in it and you know what he said he
[1:53:24] said the sucess of my ministry I
[1:53:27] attributed to my wife because she gave
[1:53:30] me so much trouble I had to be on my
[1:53:32] knees all the time
[1:53:45] she was not just an Aggie one she has
[1:53:48] some muscles she will pull him around
[1:53:53] the house with his head but yet all of
[1:53:59] his trouble would take him down on his
[1:54:01] knees and he would go and seek God he
[1:54:07] would go broken before God crying to get
[1:54:14] himself ready for another revival what
[1:54:20] are some other things that we are
[1:54:21] complaining about what are some of those
[1:54:26] things it reduce go down to material
[1:54:35] things
[1:54:36] praise the Lord this is not really kind
[1:54:44] of a subject to to preach it is just
[1:54:47] something to to think about it is
[1:54:52] something to think about
[1:55:00] are we trusting God are we following the
[1:55:04] Lord with all of our heart does that
[1:55:06] means that we will not have troubles I
[1:55:12] have left everything of the word you
[1:55:15] have you know I've had left all my ways
[1:55:18] in in order of those things and and
[1:55:19] anything about it there is that people
[1:55:23] what do dia is there they come to try
[1:55:26] God and they leave all of those things
[1:55:29] in a closet so when when it does not
[1:55:32] work I can go right back and pick it up
[1:55:38] they will didn't know where they left
[1:55:40] those things they're nowhere to live all
[1:55:45] their filter dressing or the out the
[1:55:47] idea they are Jamison and and they know
[1:55:50] exactly where they left them so I'm just
[1:55:53] coming to try this thing and see if it
[1:55:54] will work you're not trusting God trust
[1:56:05] the Lord for your heart praise the Lord
[1:56:15] it's not an easy thing people it's not a
[1:56:19] thing that you can calculate you can
[1:56:22] pull it on your calendar you can put it
[1:56:26] in time to it
[1:56:34] praise the Lord can you imagine job
[1:56:37] saying even if he slay me I will trust
[1:56:43] him that is a man job never said that
[1:56:49] from the beginning let's follow that I
[1:56:52] close here in a few minutes
[1:56:54] let's follow that he never said that in
[1:56:56] the beginning chapter 2 chapter 3 he
[1:56:59] complained amen he complained but he had
[1:57:06] on he followed a little bit praise the
[1:57:12] Lord and one of the powerful thing that
[1:57:17] is that he never despised God he never
[1:57:20] kicked God he never insulted God he said
[1:57:24] he said he said wise God I don't even
[1:57:27] know why he would bring a man of flesh
[1:57:30] like me into George man with him he's
[1:57:35] not the kind of a person where we can go
[1:57:37] to his house sit down and talk the
[1:57:39] matter in one where joy was feeling
[1:57:43] cheated because he knows all my ways I
[1:57:46] don't know what he's doing but he know
[1:57:47] exactly everything that is happening to
[1:57:49] me when you see over and over job kept
[1:57:55] as rotten God I don't understand it but
[1:57:59] he's a wonderful God I don't know about
[1:58:01] it but he's a mighty God he kept
[1:58:05] assaulting God in a mess of everything
[1:58:07] then it came to a town where he broke he
[1:58:11] got over it
[1:58:13] he says even if he slay me how we trust
[1:58:17] him
[1:58:21] praise the Lord
[1:58:22] and for a matter of fact what job was
[1:58:26] going through it was God's choice for
[1:58:28] him some of the things we are going
[1:58:30] through is our own choice that put us in
[1:58:33] it let's bow our heads musicians you can
