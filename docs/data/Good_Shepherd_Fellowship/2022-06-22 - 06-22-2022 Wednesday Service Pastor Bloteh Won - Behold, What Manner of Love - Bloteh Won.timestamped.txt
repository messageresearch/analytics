[33:21] amen
[33:23] amen
[33:24] amen the lord bless you you can have
[33:26] your seat a little bit here
[33:29] before we get to preaching
[33:32] uh there's a little bit of an echo here
[33:36] uh
[33:37] i love in the door it makes me to sound
[33:40] uh
[33:41] more powerful than i am
[33:47] praise the lord but what can we say
[33:50] about the service on the weekend amen
[33:52] praise the lord let's just give the lord
[33:53] a hand of praise
[33:55] amen
[33:58] praise the lord
[34:01] now you know uh
[34:05] as we as we all know we've been taught
[34:07] uh every birth is a mess
[34:09] but i think this gone weekend birth was
[34:12] was a decent birth amen
[34:15] it was not a mess at all it was a decent
[34:17] birth
[34:18] praise the lord
[34:20] and
[34:21] it's something that i've been looking
[34:23] forward to and uh
[34:26] you know trying it the first time is
[34:27] scary but when you have done it first
[34:30] you are not afraid to do it again amen
[34:33] is one of those things so uh
[34:35] you because you realize that uh
[34:38] uh
[34:39] uh
[34:40] worship
[34:42] is a very is a very important thing
[34:45] yeah you know there are somewhere in the
[34:47] book of jeremiah
[34:49] where the lord told israel you know
[34:52] pretty soon you were here no longer the
[34:54] voice of the bridegroom in need of the
[34:56] voice of the bride
[34:58] and uh and i've always associated there
[35:01] to the spirit of worship being gone away
[35:04] from the church
[35:05] because if you don't have the spirit of
[35:07] worship you can never hear the voice of
[35:08] god you can you can be stuck in the
[35:12] things you think you know
[35:14] you know you can just be stuck in your
[35:16] rituals and your duties and you know all
[35:19] your performance but you know to really
[35:22] be in in fellowship with god you have to
[35:26] worship him
[35:28] praise the lord because he's an object
[35:30] of worship
[35:32] and that's the reason why we were we
[35:34] were made to worship to fellowship with
[35:36] him it's a big part of our fellowship
[35:38] worship so you see when we come and then
[35:42] singing just becomes so dried and the
[35:44] people you know holly can move their
[35:47] hands and and we want to get through the
[35:50] sun service quickly you see the sun
[35:52] leader trying to oh let me just sing the
[35:54] neso and get up from here
[35:56] you know and you know and he just uh
[35:59] let's let's call the pastor quickly
[36:03] then it's then there's a problem
[36:05] right you know then then it's a problem
[36:08] because uh
[36:09] when we take that kind of attitude we
[36:12] grieve the holy spirit
[36:14] you know then you have a preacher that
[36:16] comes behind the pulpit and then he
[36:19] comes and you know uh
[36:21] he's looking for an extra ordinary you
[36:25] know uh revelation and inspiration and
[36:28] and something to pick him up and then
[36:31] now he got to go and create some kind of
[36:33] a thing that would be sensational to the
[36:36] people so it can tickle the people a
[36:38] little bit and all of that and that's
[36:40] why we have all of these things going on
[36:43] because the spirit of worship is going
[36:44] away from the church
[36:47] you know but we want to come and come on
[36:49] an expectation you know
[36:51] where we can sing and we can clap our
[36:53] hands we can feel free to worship the
[36:56] lord and
[36:58] and that's just exactly what we wanted
[37:00] to do
[37:02] last weekend praise the lord amen so we
[37:05] will look forward for the lord to help
[37:06] us as we go along and uh
[37:09] uh
[37:10] you know
[37:12] we will we will be able to stage uh
[37:14] something like that again just a singing
[37:16] night where we can just come and and
[37:19] think and you know just let's just say
[37:21] to the lord
[37:22] praise the lord when we get or to
[37:24] internet there's no preacher there you
[37:26] know there's you know if the preaching
[37:28] is the best part of the service that you
[37:30] you think you love you'll be
[37:31] disappointed when you get on the other
[37:33] side so you better prepare yourself in
[37:36] worship here because it would just be
[37:38] worship there praise the lord so i think
[37:41] uh that was a beautiful thing and uh man
[37:45] what can we say about the choir they
[37:47] pulled out something this weekend let's
[37:50] just clap for ourselves
[37:52] praise the lord
[37:54] amen
[37:57] let's just talk to ourselves
[38:00] praise the lord
[38:04] amen
[38:06] that was wonderful i was wonderful
[38:08] praise the lord and we we look forward
[38:11] to more of that
[38:13] we look forward to more of that in uh
[38:16] trusting to see
[38:18] how the law will
[38:20] will uh
[38:21] you know
[38:23] help us to come from our baby stage to
[38:25] be
[38:26] to be uh
[38:29] teenagers and be to be a mentor group to
[38:31] sing so we thank the lord for that i
[38:33] praise the lord
[38:35] amen and and i think the preacher also
[38:38] did a good job
[38:39] and
[38:40] and we all went home
[38:42] happy enjoying the word of the lord
[38:45] praise the lord
[38:46] amen so
[38:48] let your stand we'll sing one more song
[38:50] and then
[38:51] we uh
[38:56] we will now turn to the preaching of the
[38:58] word

[51:04] be called sons

[52:17] i pray that the lord will
[52:19] will be able to
[52:21] to uh
[52:23] to bless it
[52:24] now so when you when when you know when
[52:26] you think about this i think uh probably
[52:29] last
[52:30] last uh
[52:32] wednesday
[52:33] i commented a little bit on this
[52:35] because i had it on my mind and it just
[52:37] it just can't go away
[52:39] you know
[52:42] it just can't go away
[52:44] i'm kind of looking at the love of god
[52:48] uh in this way
[52:50] you know uh the scripture says for god
[52:53] so loved the word
[52:56] that he gave his only begotten son you
[52:58] know god brother branham says the
[53:00] expression of god's love
[53:03] you know was for him to give you know
[53:05] when and you know
[53:07] uh it's it's not just
[53:09] you know god so loved the word that he
[53:11] gave that he he uh uh or gave moses the
[53:15] ten commandments or he so loved the word
[53:18] that he spoke from heaven for us to hear
[53:20] his voice
[53:21] you know but uh he so loved the word
[53:25] that uh
[53:27] he came down
[53:28] to associate himself with us
[53:31] you know
[53:32] and and and that is the way i want to
[53:34] look at look at the love of god uh uh
[53:38] a little bit
[53:40] i want to look at it in that direction
[53:42] to the sense the other
[53:44] uh
[53:45] an expression of god's love
[53:48] you know when god loves a people
[53:51] he identify himself with them
[53:54] praise the lord
[53:55] he identify himself with them and
[53:58] to be able to look at the love of god
[54:02] uh uh and and measure it out in the way
[54:06] uh in which that uh he's dealing with us
[54:09] in our personal life in a way that he
[54:12] has there with us throughout the ages
[54:14] the way that god has there with men
[54:17] that's what i want to look at
[54:19] there is a a
[54:21] a a little teaching part that uh that i
[54:24] share with you
[54:25] on uh last uh
[54:29] you know last uh last wednesday
[54:32] and it is that part of verse two
[54:35] where the scripture says beloved now we
[54:39] are the sons of god
[54:41] and it does not yet appear
[54:44] what we shall be but we know
[54:48] when he shall appear
[54:50] we shall be like him
[54:52] for
[54:53] we shall see him
[54:55] as he is
[54:57] praise the lord
[54:59] now so when you think about uh uh you
[55:02] know john the revelator you think about
[55:05] uh
[55:06] the experience he had on the island of
[55:09] patmos
[55:10] and the revelation the way
[55:12] you know his experience he had with
[55:14] jesus being john the beloved the one
[55:17] that lied on jesus bosom and you know
[55:20] and the close relationship that he had
[55:23] with jesus why
[55:24] our law was here
[55:26] but then to realize that john also had
[55:30] you know uh
[55:33] he had
[55:34] a more closer relationship with jesus
[55:38] when he was thrown on the island of
[55:39] patmos
[55:41] and uh they lock him out there you know
[55:44] uh uh uh you know and and try to put him
[55:47] into a ball in order and all of that
[55:50] that we know and we know how you know
[55:52] that place was uh uh almost like like a
[55:55] desert place the way the true john but
[55:58] to realize that in such a time he will
[56:02] have
[56:02] a relationship with jesus more than in
[56:07] in jesus athlete
[56:09] ministering
[56:11] praise the lord
[56:12] john will come up to an understanding he
[56:15] will he will he will see the
[56:18] uh
[56:19] uh by by the teaching of the holy spirit
[56:22] he will see things concerning the end
[56:24] and then how god will deal with him and
[56:28] and all of that
[56:30] to realize all of that and then and then
[56:33] coming back you know uh from the island
[56:36] of patmos
[56:37] brother branham in one message said it
[56:40] affected john so much
[56:42] you know it affected him so much
[56:45] that when he looked at the church
[56:48] uh i think he spent some time with the
[56:50] church of ephesus
[56:52] you know and and he he remember what the
[56:54] lord jesus you know told them
[56:58] and compare it with some of the
[57:00] experience that he had on the island of
[57:02] patmos
[57:03] you know
[57:04] he didn't have struggle like even if you
[57:06] read
[57:08] a true uh
[57:10] first john second john and you know his
[57:12] last letter you see how he talked he
[57:15] talked more like a mental person he says
[57:18] uh he says young man you have overcome
[57:20] the word because greater is he that is
[57:22] in you you know than he that is in the
[57:25] world you know because i mean he was he
[57:27] was looking from the place of a vision
[57:31] praise the lord
[57:33] he was looking
[57:35] from the place of a vision
[57:37] you know
[57:38] uh you know if uh
[57:41] uh we we we are walking
[57:44] you know by faith and uh and trusting
[57:47] the lord every day you know but when god
[57:50] gives you a vision of of what he's going
[57:53] to do in your life it brings a sense of
[57:56] rest it brings a sense of of realization
[57:59] so it's a little bit of that i'm i'm
[58:02] trying to find a way you know
[58:05] uh uh just to be able to narrow what is
[58:07] in my mind here down to you tonight
[58:09] so
[58:10] what manner of love that the father have
[58:14] bestowed upon us
[58:17] you know
[58:18] if we think about it
[58:21] as uh
[58:23] this lost this church
[58:26] you know and
[58:28] and you will see that
[58:30] throughout all the ages
[58:33] you know when god
[58:35] expresses his love to his people
[58:38] you know he don't he don't he don't
[58:40] leave them alone
[58:42] amen
[58:44] we
[58:45] we we see there in eating
[58:47] uh you know adam and the father were
[58:50] having perfect fellowship
[58:52] you know it was just a perfect
[58:54] fellowship that he had
[58:56] but yet when adam fell
[59:00] and
[59:01] and out of shame he was hiding himself
[59:04] from god
[59:05] you know it was god that came after adam
[59:10] and saying adam adam where are you
[59:13] okay
[59:14] so you think about it now in the sense
[59:17] of what manner of love
[59:20] think about adam saying this now we're
[59:22] not talking about john now john said his
[59:25] own adam said the same thing what manner
[59:28] of love
[59:30] that the father have bestowed upon me
[59:33] yes
[59:34] praise lord
[59:36] that i should be called the son of god
[59:38] think about the story about of the
[59:40] practical son
[59:42] he came back he says
[59:45] uh you know my father sevens are not
[59:47] even eating this kind of a trash that
[59:49] i'm eating down here i'm going to my
[59:52] father i'm going to tell him i want to
[59:53] be one of your seven
[59:56] and when he gets there the father said
[59:58] forget about it boy you'll get the best
[1:00:00] robe you'll dress this guy up you're
[1:00:02] giving me a bath here i'm not taking
[1:00:03] bath you know for for for some while
[1:00:06] because i can get the smell of him but
[1:00:08] give him a good bath and put the best
[1:00:10] rope on him and everything
[1:00:12] i believe when he sat down to himself he
[1:00:14] says what manner of love
[1:00:19] that the father
[1:00:21] have bestowed upon me right
[1:00:24] praise the lord
[1:00:26] and you see
[1:00:27] when that becomes
[1:00:29] a revelation to you
[1:00:31] when you can sit down
[1:00:34] and and and and draw into yourself
[1:00:39] and start to see
[1:00:40] that is it's a love
[1:00:43] that the father has put upon you
[1:00:46] you know uh when he when he looks down
[1:00:49] on you he looks at you with a loving eye
[1:00:52] now with an angry eye
[1:00:54] you know if you can if you can see that
[1:00:57] so that's what i want to go tonight
[1:01:00] but
[1:01:02] i want to i want to also go in a way to
[1:01:05] say that
[1:01:06] uh just like adam when god
[1:01:10] uh saw his son
[1:01:12] feeling and like brother branham said he
[1:01:14] never sent an angel
[1:01:16] you know
[1:01:17] he uh he he show himself out there to
[1:01:21] adam he appeared to adam
[1:01:24] amen
[1:01:25] and even brought
[1:01:27] a sheepskin
[1:01:31] to dressing to cover his nakedness
[1:01:35] praise the lord
[1:01:36] now so
[1:01:37] is that is is the way in which that god
[1:01:42] reveal himself to adam
[1:01:44] the way that god like like i've always
[1:01:47] tell people you can never serve god
[1:01:50] above the way
[1:01:52] that he has revealed himself to you
[1:01:58] praise the lord
[1:02:00] if you know god through a church
[1:02:02] you will stop at the church
[1:02:06] praise the lord
[1:02:08] if you know god uh as a baptist you will
[1:02:11] just conform to baptist teaching you
[1:02:14] know god as a matter of this that just
[1:02:16] where you will stop
[1:02:17] you will do everything that the matter
[1:02:20] this or the catholic want you to do
[1:02:23] praise the lord
[1:02:26] are we together
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:30] so you see is is that revelation
[1:02:34] is that revelation that's what jesus
[1:02:37] said it's upon that i will build my
[1:02:39] church
[1:02:41] revelation
[1:02:42] yes
[1:02:45] that's what i'm going tonight
[1:02:48] is that revelation
[1:02:51] because like brother branham says the
[1:02:54] word that the word of god can only work
[1:02:56] for you if you see it
[1:03:04] you're here people say oh i see it now
[1:03:09] they've been hearing it
[1:03:11] they've been reading it
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] but something has happened
[1:03:16] oh i see it now
[1:03:20] that's when the word works for you
[1:03:26] praise the lord
[1:03:27] that's when the word works for you
[1:03:32] now so let's get into this little
[1:03:34] teaching part of of tonight uh
[1:03:38] uh hesitation or message whichever way
[1:03:40] we will call it
[1:03:42] and uh so uh uh john here is talking
[1:03:46] about
[1:03:47] now we are sons of god
[1:03:53] it does not yet appear
[1:03:57] what we shall be
[1:04:00] now if you read
[1:04:01] through other
[1:04:03] uh study bibles
[1:04:07] you will see that uh
[1:04:09] the same word appear
[1:04:11] also means reveal
[1:04:14] that word appear also means manifest
[1:04:21] amen the manifestation of the sons of
[1:04:24] god is the appearance of the sons of god
[1:04:28] the sons of god coming to life the sons
[1:04:31] of god stepping out
[1:04:34] the sons of god are revealing themselves
[1:04:38] we've been held back by denominations
[1:04:41] increased
[1:04:43] by the opening of the seals is bringing
[1:04:45] the sons of god out
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:50] the creation is waiting for the
[1:04:52] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:04:55] they have always been here right they've
[1:04:57] been going to school they've been
[1:04:59] learning trade they
[1:05:01] they got married but that's that's
[1:05:03] there's a there's a time something
[1:05:05] happening
[1:05:08] praise the lord amen
[1:05:11] where they can step forward and says i
[1:05:13] know i'm a child of god
[1:05:18] it's not that moment that they became
[1:05:20] child of god
[1:05:21] they were always sons of god
[1:05:24] but something happened
[1:05:27] something happened
[1:05:29] that's what i want for us to share
[1:05:31] a little bit tonight
[1:05:35] now so uh if if you look here
[1:05:39] uh
[1:05:41] one of the uh
[1:05:49] but brian will talk about uh
[1:05:51] the lamsa bible you know he
[1:05:54] you make sudden comment on that
[1:05:56] yeah it says says uh it reads the same
[1:05:59] uh scripture
[1:06:01] see how
[1:06:03] the love of the father is towards us
[1:06:07] for he have called our sons
[1:06:11] and made us
[1:06:14] therefore the world does
[1:06:17] not know us because
[1:06:19] he did not know him
[1:06:22] my beloved now
[1:06:25] we are sons
[1:06:26] of god
[1:06:28] and
[1:06:30] as yet it have not been revealed
[1:06:34] what we shall be
[1:06:38] but we know
[1:06:40] when
[1:06:41] we know that when he shall appear
[1:06:45] we shall see him in his likeness
[1:06:49] for we
[1:06:50] shall see him as he is
[1:06:54] praise the lord
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] and uh uh uh
[1:07:01] another translation used the same thing
[1:07:03] beloved
[1:07:05] we we are now children of god and and
[1:07:08] what we shall be
[1:07:10] has not yet been manifested
[1:07:14] we know that if
[1:07:16] if it is manifested we shall be like him
[1:07:20] for
[1:07:21] we shall see him as he is
[1:07:24] praise the lord
[1:07:26] now so watch and see how this is going
[1:07:29] to happen
[1:07:30] and and god took that same approach in
[1:07:34] every age
[1:07:38] to bring this revelation to his children
[1:07:41] he took that same approach in every age
[1:07:46] praise the lord
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:48] take for example
[1:07:52] trying to create an atmosphere when when
[1:07:54] when when it's wrapped then i know it's
[1:07:56] time for me to preach so you got to help
[1:07:58] me
[1:08:00] when uh
[1:08:03] moses was down in egypt
[1:08:08] he fed a sense of failure
[1:08:10] right
[1:08:11] he went in the desert
[1:08:14] and yeah he met god
[1:08:17] in the burning bulge
[1:08:19] praise the lord
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] now when he came uh back into egypt
[1:08:26] the elders of israel struggled to
[1:08:28] believe him
[1:08:30] yes
[1:08:30] amen they struggled to believe him until
[1:08:34] they started seeing the supernatural
[1:08:39] praise the lord
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:42] well every time when moses and and and
[1:08:45] and aaron goes over to uh to uh
[1:08:49] to meet
[1:08:50] pharaoh
[1:08:51] and then when he says
[1:08:52] uh uh this evening you're going to see
[1:08:54] frogs
[1:08:57] and uh when moses get back
[1:09:00] frogs started going everywhere and it's
[1:09:02] all over the places it's in the
[1:09:04] newspaper is on the newspaper it's under
[1:09:06] the newspaper
[1:09:11] frogs everywhere
[1:09:13] so all of those things started building
[1:09:15] the faith of the people
[1:09:18] that there is something to what he's
[1:09:19] saying
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:23] there is something and when he came to
[1:09:25] the place where
[1:09:26] uh uh uh under the voice of moses there
[1:09:29] were darkness in egypt
[1:09:32] and light and gushing
[1:09:35] what the people started seeing the
[1:09:38] creative power of god
[1:09:40] all that they have heard about elohim
[1:09:43] all they heard about jehovah they are
[1:09:45] fit now
[1:09:47] their feet was gradually being restored
[1:09:50] in the god of their fathers
[1:09:53] by seeing his manifestation through a
[1:09:57] prophet
[1:10:00] are we together amen it was not just on
[1:10:04] a reading story now they were seeing the
[1:10:06] manifestation
[1:10:08] praise the lord so by seeing that
[1:10:10] manifestation they were also seeing the
[1:10:13] revealing of god
[1:10:17] god was making himself materialized to
[1:10:21] his people
[1:10:23] by fulfilling his word
[1:10:26] praise the lord
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:29] now if what moses said
[1:10:32] never happened
[1:10:35] the people were not going to
[1:10:38] obey by having the passover
[1:10:43] because the passover came on a direct
[1:10:46] command
[1:10:48] gather your house together
[1:10:50] kill alam
[1:10:52] for this night you are leaving egypt yes
[1:10:58] you see god build the fit of the people
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:03] from the first plague
[1:11:06] to
[1:11:06] the the plague of death
[1:11:10] when it when they started yearning
[1:11:12] christ coming from everywhere
[1:11:15] whoa
[1:11:16] the next night
[1:11:17] every word
[1:11:19] they started becoming sober
[1:11:23] praise the lord
[1:11:24] even the ones that were so doubtful
[1:11:28] now that was where all the missed
[1:11:30] multitudes started entering because they
[1:11:32] are afraid of death
[1:11:35] praise the lord
[1:11:36] amen they were not believing the word
[1:11:39] for what it is but now they were fearing
[1:11:41] death so they all jumped in there and
[1:11:44] and started you know
[1:11:46] we got to get serious moses said we are
[1:11:48] leaving i thought you said we shouldn't
[1:11:50] believe forget about i said pass up
[1:11:52] let's go
[1:11:56] thank god you didn't die i said pack up
[1:11:58] don't argue here
[1:12:00] but but daddy i thought you said was
[1:12:03] don't make me mad i said get ready let's
[1:12:05] go
[1:12:08] praise the lord
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:10] so you see
[1:12:12] but what what i'm saying is that uh uh
[1:12:16] uh
[1:12:17] god
[1:12:19] started
[1:12:20] revealing himself
[1:12:22] restoring
[1:12:24] the faith of the people
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] remember he says i would come down
[1:12:32] and with mighty hands
[1:12:34] i would bring them out
[1:12:38] praise the lord
[1:12:40] but you see even if he would have come
[1:12:43] and and and have spoken over egypt
[1:12:47] the people
[1:12:49] we're still going to struggle to believe
[1:12:55] he had to come
[1:12:57] by bringing the very same runaway
[1:13:00] prophet
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:04] he had to bring that runner with prophet
[1:13:06] he had to go back to the fair the very
[1:13:08] thing that he ran away from
[1:13:11] confront those very same people that
[1:13:13] said we'll make you ruler in law over us
[1:13:15] yeah
[1:13:17] absolutely
[1:13:18] praise the lord
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:23] that's what was making it hard for one
[1:13:24] mortal to believe in another malta
[1:13:27] because now they knew that he he has run
[1:13:30] away
[1:13:31] sure
[1:13:32] praise the lord
[1:13:33] so every time they will they will argue
[1:13:35] with moses that's what they would bring
[1:13:37] up you killed you killed egypt and you
[1:13:39] ran away you left us here
[1:13:41] right they always go back to his
[1:13:43] weakness and say you killed an egyptian
[1:13:45] and you ran away you left us here
[1:13:47] what do you want to tell us
[1:13:52] are we together
[1:13:55] but
[1:13:57] that was
[1:14:00] the love of god
[1:14:02] the lord that god have
[1:14:05] for
[1:14:06] his people
[1:14:07] the lord that he had for abraham
[1:14:10] that he told abraham after 400 years i'm
[1:14:13] going to come down with a mighty hand
[1:14:16] and i will bring them out
[1:14:18] i will bring them to this very lane
[1:14:22] praise the lord
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:35] hallelujah
[1:14:39] on the road of emails
[1:14:41] those
[1:14:43] gentlemen after the resurrection
[1:14:46] i was i was listening today and
[1:14:47] listening to that today and
[1:14:50] there was a beautiful picture
[1:14:52] that that kind of a play in my mind
[1:14:55] that day
[1:14:57] was one of the most
[1:15:01] beautiful
[1:15:02] day in the sense that
[1:15:05] god
[1:15:07] it shows that god starts working from
[1:15:09] the morning because the resurrection was
[1:15:12] from me in the morning
[1:15:14] it was the very same days he appeared
[1:15:16] unto the ladies to go and tell my
[1:15:18] disciples
[1:15:21] then he met those men in the afternoon
[1:15:24] then in the evening time he has to meet
[1:15:26] every one of them
[1:15:30] it was just it was just so beautiful but
[1:15:32] you think about it
[1:15:34] now those disciples they have put their
[1:15:37] faith in him
[1:15:39] and believing that this is this is the
[1:15:41] guy that would bring us out of uh
[1:15:43] judaism and bring us from under the
[1:15:45] roman rule
[1:15:48] and after jesus
[1:15:51] died
[1:15:52] they were all looking there you have
[1:15:54] done something
[1:15:56] they were looking to see the greatest
[1:15:58] miracle
[1:16:00] they thought that when they nailed him
[1:16:01] on the trade
[1:16:03] on the cross there was there was
[1:16:04] something he was going to do
[1:16:07] their expectation
[1:16:12] they all stood there in their little
[1:16:14] corner and watching honor expectation
[1:16:17] that something was going to happen
[1:16:20] in the last meeting he would do
[1:16:22] something
[1:16:26] but when they saw
[1:16:28] those roman soldiers taking his body
[1:16:30] down
[1:16:33] and joseph one of them asking for the
[1:16:36] body
[1:16:37] yeah and the body was wrapped
[1:16:40] in their mind they were saying really
[1:16:43] really
[1:16:45] asking the question
[1:16:46] have we been deceived
[1:16:48] really
[1:16:51] sure
[1:16:51] right
[1:16:53] is this a dream
[1:16:56] we saw this man opening the blind eyes
[1:17:00] we were just on the road the last time i
[1:17:02] you know when when that widow with a
[1:17:04] woman they were taking the ball to bury
[1:17:06] him
[1:17:07] right
[1:17:10] you see such a disappointment
[1:17:13] that dropped in their spirit
[1:17:17] praise the lord
[1:17:21] amen
[1:17:22] but you see how
[1:17:25] he show his love to them
[1:17:30] how he did it not by giving them visions
[1:17:33] it would have been wonderful sure
[1:17:36] speaking to them in their dreams
[1:17:38] but they will wake up from bed and
[1:17:39] realize that he's dead
[1:17:45] so how
[1:17:51] he proved his love
[1:17:53] by appearing to them
[1:17:59] praise the lord
[1:18:04] and then he asked them what what are you
[1:18:05] guys talking about are you a stranger
[1:18:07] you don't know what have happened he
[1:18:08] says what what happened
[1:18:11] what really happened
[1:18:14] and as they talk they talk and the bible
[1:18:16] says and then he begin to open the
[1:18:18] scripture
[1:18:21] beginning from moses
[1:18:24] he expanded the scripture
[1:18:27] and what was he trying to do
[1:18:30] he was trying to help them to identify
[1:18:33] him
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:38] he was trying to to associate everything
[1:18:41] that have happened
[1:18:44] with the scriptures so they can be able
[1:18:46] to identify him
[1:18:49] not just by his uh uh uh uh you know a
[1:18:54] terrestrial person
[1:18:57] but to be able to identify him by his
[1:19:00] word his promises
[1:19:05] are we together
[1:19:06] and as he talks he says you have a full
[1:19:10] slow slow in harding he talked to them
[1:19:13] he talked and they talk and and and i
[1:19:15] mean they were they were so captured
[1:19:17] that he told him about with us
[1:19:20] for this evening
[1:19:23] praise the lord
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:26] now see what happened
[1:19:28] normally
[1:19:29] in uh uh in in any house not not only
[1:19:32] the jewish house but in any house
[1:19:35] i mean no stranger come to your house
[1:19:37] and then he start breaking bread you
[1:19:38] break the bread and give to him
[1:19:43] praise the lord but he realized that he
[1:19:46] has created an atmosphere that has made
[1:19:50] those men to be attracted to him they
[1:19:52] were not attracted to him by everything
[1:19:55] that he have said
[1:19:58] praise the lord
[1:20:01] you see the the word is the bounding
[1:20:04] power
[1:20:05] the word is the keeping power
[1:20:08] the revelation of the word that's what
[1:20:10] keeps us
[1:20:14] praise the lord
[1:20:16] so as uh
[1:20:18] i mean they were so attracted to him
[1:20:20] they say about what they set the table
[1:20:23] and he took the bread
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:27] and he broke it
[1:20:29] it was not it was not in the physical
[1:20:33] breaking of the brain that the eyes were
[1:20:35] open
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:37] everything that he had said
[1:20:40] has created the atmosphere
[1:20:43] that when he broke the bread
[1:20:46] there was there was a physical witness
[1:20:50] they could see the scars
[1:20:52] on his hands
[1:20:56] praise the lord
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:00] so his appearing
[1:21:02] he revealing himself open their eyes
[1:21:07] and the bible says
[1:21:09] when when they realized it was him he
[1:21:12] disappeared praise the lord
[1:21:16] thank god
[1:21:17] i'll i'm telling you after promise me i
[1:21:20] can i can challenge you when we get on
[1:21:22] the other side and ask them they will
[1:21:24] not tell you to sat down to eat
[1:21:28] no
[1:21:30] if they were so hungry they took the
[1:21:32] broken bread and said let's go
[1:21:34] let's go and tell the other guys we have
[1:21:35] seen the lord
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:40] praise the lord
[1:21:42] what did that do
[1:21:44] it restored their confidence that was
[1:21:47] destroyed
[1:21:49] the confidence that the the
[1:21:51] that the the the saheedra's counsel and
[1:21:54] the romans tried to destroy the
[1:21:57] revealing of the son of man
[1:22:00] the revealing of christ
[1:22:02] restored their confidence
[1:22:06] they were ready to travel
[1:22:09] mars to go and meet the other ones
[1:22:12] that were gathered in jerusalem
[1:22:15] to go and tell tell them
[1:22:17] that we have seen the
[1:22:22] lord praise the lord
[1:22:27] let's look at luke 17 30. that's what i
[1:22:29] want to get to tonight
[1:22:33] luke 17 30 is such a such a promise
[1:22:37] that
[1:22:42] is a scripture
[1:22:47] that hangs around
[1:22:51] what god
[1:22:52] did in our generation
[1:22:56] praise the lord
[1:22:58] now so you have to realize that john
[1:23:02] with with with the experience that he
[1:23:04] had
[1:23:05] you know and for him to say that
[1:23:08] uh you know it it it does not appear
[1:23:11] you know
[1:23:13] what what will be when we see him
[1:23:16] when he shall appear
[1:23:19] we will be like him
[1:23:22] praise the lord
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:25] there's a place where
[1:23:27] our
[1:23:28] our terrestrial body
[1:23:31] will be like his glorified body
[1:23:34] but even before then
[1:23:38] there is something that god did in our
[1:23:41] age
[1:23:42] and not only our age
[1:23:45] do you know what what it was for for
[1:23:48] people like luther
[1:23:50] and and
[1:23:51] and calvin and knox and all of those men
[1:23:54] that were that were under
[1:23:56] the uh uh the catholic ruled
[1:23:59] when the church and the state were so
[1:24:01] strong together
[1:24:05] what made luther to be
[1:24:08] at a place uh uh uh uh
[1:24:11] so empowered
[1:24:13] with the joshua led by faith
[1:24:16] just that little verse that was quick
[1:24:19] into him
[1:24:24] it was the revealing
[1:24:27] it was the appearing
[1:24:29] he saw it
[1:24:31] he saw it
[1:24:33] that we cannot be justified
[1:24:36] by works
[1:24:39] praise the lord
[1:24:40] we cannot be justified by works
[1:24:43] everything that he tried to do
[1:24:48] praise the lord
[1:24:49] you see that's that is the place where i
[1:24:51] i appreciate the portion of uh uh kind
[1:24:54] of balance that brother uh ben was going
[1:24:57] this weekend
[1:25:00] and
[1:25:06] just like john said everyone that had
[1:25:08] this hope
[1:25:11] of being like him
[1:25:13] of seeing him to be like him
[1:25:15] he says everyone that has this hope
[1:25:17] purify themself
[1:25:19] if that hope is in you
[1:25:22] you will strive to live right
[1:25:25] praise the lord
[1:25:27] you will not take what the preacher said
[1:25:28] as a license for you to do anything you
[1:25:30] want to do if that hope is in you to be
[1:25:33] like him you will strive you will do
[1:25:35] everything that you know right to do
[1:25:38] praise the lord
[1:25:40] tonight i was i was going to talk a
[1:25:42] little bit on on on babylon
[1:25:45] because uh there is there is uh a
[1:25:48] scripture that kind of
[1:25:50] blew my mind revelation chapter
[1:25:53] you read revelation chapter 19
[1:25:56] there is there is four times
[1:25:59] where
[1:26:00] hallelujah
[1:26:02] and praise and and worship
[1:26:04] was
[1:26:05] you know was was expressed after
[1:26:09] babylon was destroyed
[1:26:11] after the beast system went down
[1:26:15] we know fault is the norm of deliverance
[1:26:18] praise the lord
[1:26:20] because right from
[1:26:22] the babylon of nero
[1:26:25] that spirit
[1:26:28] has reigned through all ages
[1:26:31] and it has its influence in every
[1:26:34] religion
[1:26:37] praise the lord
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:41] just like after the fall
[1:26:45] what happened it was there was a mix
[1:26:49] there was a hybrid now
[1:26:52] uh
[1:26:53] uh adam the son of god
[1:26:56] in the in the same warm of eve now there
[1:26:59] are two seas
[1:27:01] it's a seed of the adam the son of god
[1:27:05] and there is a seed of the serpent
[1:27:08] because that's why the bible says the
[1:27:11] seed of the woman will bruise the head
[1:27:13] of the seed of the serpent
[1:27:18] so there was there was just like how the
[1:27:21] the fall came by the mixing of blood
[1:27:25] that's the way right after the flood
[1:27:31] there was a mix
[1:27:33] there was a mix of
[1:27:36] the approach to god religion
[1:27:41] and that thing has run all through all
[1:27:44] through the ages
[1:27:47] and even down to our age that we are in
[1:27:50] praise the lord
[1:27:53] amen
[1:27:54] unless god
[1:27:57] set us free he that the son has made
[1:27:59] free
[1:28:01] is free in day
[1:28:02] unless god break us completely loose
[1:28:06] there is there is a tendency
[1:28:08] of of trying to hold to something
[1:28:12] right to prove that you are safe or
[1:28:16] trying to do something
[1:28:19] praise the lord
[1:28:21] and there we need
[1:28:23] the grace of god to always remind us
[1:28:26] and always help us
[1:28:28] now so we know here
[1:28:30] uh luke 17 30. we it's it's a very
[1:28:34] common scripture to us the bible says
[1:28:36] even though shall it be
[1:28:38] in the day when the son of man
[1:28:41] is revealed
[1:28:43] praise the lord
[1:28:44] now so if you look at the revealing of
[1:28:47] the son of man
[1:28:48] praise the lord
[1:28:50] now so what in one sense what john was
[1:28:53] trying to bring to us you have to
[1:28:56] remember now it was jesus in the midst
[1:28:59] of the seven golden candle state
[1:29:02] so it's the revealing of the son of man
[1:29:04] in the midst of the church ages
[1:29:07] that is going to give every age its
[1:29:10] overcoming power
[1:29:13] an age will never overcome until they
[1:29:16] see the revealing of the son of man of
[1:29:19] their day
[1:29:22] when when luther said that joshua lived
[1:29:25] by faith it was the revealing of the son
[1:29:27] of man that he saw
[1:29:29] of his day the world came alive to him
[1:29:33] and it helped him to break loose
[1:29:35] from that roman system
[1:29:40] praise the lord
[1:29:42] and that is the love of god
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:47] that is the love of god that the father
[1:29:51] has bestowed upon us
[1:29:54] praise the lord
[1:29:55] that we can be called sons of god
[1:29:58] god's love
[1:30:03] when he loves you
[1:30:04] he show himself to you
[1:30:09] praise the lord
[1:30:11] and when he loves you he show himself to
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:14] he revealed himself
[1:30:20] he will do things to grab your attention
[1:30:25] that's the love of god
[1:30:32] are we together
[1:30:34] are you grabbing the picture
[1:30:36] of where i'm where i'm trying to go
[1:30:38] tonight
[1:30:39] what matter of love that the father has
[1:30:42] bestowed upon us
[1:30:44] praise the lord
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] what manner of love that the father have
[1:30:53] what bestowed upon us he has placed on
[1:30:56] us
[1:30:57] yes
[1:31:00] so god god's love
[1:31:03] is not is is you know it's it's
[1:31:05] we we become so so sensitive of our
[1:31:09] feelings and our emotion
[1:31:13] but god love is the things that he gave
[1:31:15] to us
[1:31:18] praise the lord
[1:31:20] amen the things that he gave to us
[1:31:24] the things that he showed us the people
[1:31:26] he put in our life
[1:31:35] are we together
[1:31:39] so we know that this this is a promise
[1:31:42] from our lord jesus
[1:31:45] that the son of man will be revealed
[1:31:47] when it gets in the age word uh uh uh uh
[1:31:51] the days is rolling down to the same
[1:31:54] time of sodom and all of that
[1:32:02] we have this promised word the son of
[1:32:04] man
[1:32:05] will be revealed
[1:32:15] but just like

[1:32:46] people
[1:32:47] yes

[1:33:09] combats of those philistines and busting
[1:33:12] their head just just a bone

[1:33:19] that this was god
[1:33:24] this was the same god that opened the
[1:33:25] rest heat yes
[1:33:28] praise the lord
[1:33:33] for something to raise up the gates and
[1:33:35] put it on his shoulder

[1:34:02] the children of god
[1:34:04] praise the lord
[1:34:07] amen
[1:34:11] and then at
[1:34:13] his appearing
[1:34:14] is is his appearing
[1:34:17] that that
[1:34:19] that bring us closer
[1:34:21] that draw us closer
[1:34:23] is every time he manifests himself every
[1:34:26] time he reveals himself he show himself
[1:34:28] in the situation of your life
[1:34:32] absolutely that's the thing that changes
[1:34:35] us
[1:34:37] that's the thing that makes us more like
[1:34:39] him
[1:34:43] praise the
[1:34:44] lord so you see
[1:34:47] being like him is it's not a it's a i
[1:34:50] it's not his physical appearance
[1:34:53] right
[1:34:56] every time we see him in his word
[1:34:59] yes
[1:35:01] every time we see the promise of his
[1:35:03] word being fulfilled
[1:35:06] let me read some few things to you
[1:35:08] tonight
[1:35:09] and then
[1:35:14] we will find a place here to close
[1:35:17] since i can get away from this
[1:35:21] we'll take it another time
[1:35:24] god has a provided way
[1:35:28] now remember
[1:35:30] these two words before i leave you
[1:35:33] brother i'm talking here he says
[1:35:35] the appearing of christ
[1:35:38] and the coming of christ is two
[1:35:40] different things
[1:35:42] christ is now appearing
[1:35:45] in the fullness
[1:35:47] of his power
[1:35:52] he's appearing in the fullness of his
[1:35:56] power
[1:36:00] praise the lord
[1:36:03] that's the reason why i have this
[1:36:05] thought in my mind that that every
[1:36:07] martyr
[1:36:08] has an opportunity to see god
[1:36:11] yes
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:16] praise the lord
[1:36:19] people people experience i mean a
[1:36:22] terrible accident close to death
[1:36:24] movement
[1:36:26] they don't have to be christians or
[1:36:28] believers
[1:36:30] but they can testify it had to be god or
[1:36:32] as i would have died
[1:36:37] praise the lord
[1:36:41] god just appeared on the scene and
[1:36:42] delivered that person
[1:36:45] in the fullness of his power
[1:36:50] that's what we experience when we are
[1:36:52] sick and we get well
[1:36:58] that's what we experience when we are
[1:36:59] down and he comes and lifts us up
[1:37:05] the fullness of his power
[1:37:07] is his appearance
[1:37:10] is he revealing himself to us
[1:37:21] are we together
[1:37:24] christ is now appearing in the fullness
[1:37:26] of his power
[1:37:28] his coming will be afterward
[1:37:31] his appearing before his coming
[1:37:35] god be merciful
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:38] let me take another another thought here
[1:37:41] in in jehovah jairo to realize that as
[1:37:44] uh time is time is upon us tonight but
[1:37:46] let me let me take another thought here
[1:37:48] jehovah 2. now notice
[1:37:52] at this time of the appearing
[1:37:57] now of the revealing
[1:38:00] of the sun now he's talking about
[1:38:03] abraham
[1:38:04] abraham and sarah situation now
[1:38:07] just at a time where the son was going
[1:38:10] to come
[1:38:11] isaac was going to be born
[1:38:16] now notice at this time of the appearing
[1:38:19] now
[1:38:21] of the revealing of the sun
[1:38:23] is going to be revealed when the sun is
[1:38:25] going to be revealed the sun
[1:38:28] they don't really recognize his name
[1:38:31] they know who he is he is elsha their
[1:38:34] almighty elohim
[1:38:36] but now we come down to the time of the
[1:38:39] promised son to be revealed
[1:38:42] so you see the appearing and the
[1:38:45] revealing
[1:38:46] i just use that quote to show you that
[1:38:49] is it's the same it's the same word
[1:38:53] amen
[1:38:55] when he's appearing he's revealing
[1:38:57] himself
[1:39:03] praise the lord
[1:39:07] and then when he make himself known
[1:39:09] when we see him
[1:39:12] he put our confidence in his promise
[1:39:16] yes
[1:39:20] we can trust the word
[1:39:27] we know
[1:39:28] as a promise to the age the revealing of
[1:39:31] the son of man uh we we we know that
[1:39:34] that that scripture that that scripture
[1:39:37] was fulfilled that one man portion of it
[1:39:39] was fulfilled in the ministry of brother
[1:39:41] branham
[1:39:44] praise the lord
[1:39:49] and that is the thing
[1:39:51] that that that put our faith in a
[1:39:54] present tense god because of the things
[1:39:56] that we have we have seen and we have
[1:39:58] heard him doing in our age
[1:40:02] in our day we were not in the meetings
[1:40:05] but yes so see the truthness coming out
[1:40:08] of the word the revelation of the word
[1:40:11] that has come to us
[1:40:14] is the is the effect of the of the
[1:40:16] revelation of the word that changed our
[1:40:19] life
[1:40:24] so we are becoming more like him not in
[1:40:27] physical appearance
[1:40:30] praise the lord
[1:40:31] by the law for his word
[1:40:43] that was the harmony that was between
[1:40:45] the father and the son
[1:40:49] it's the same harmony that is between
[1:40:50] the bride and the groom
[1:40:56] she will do everything that the
[1:40:58] bridegroom have said
[1:41:00] she's not going to argue with the word
[1:41:05] why because she's becoming more like him
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:14] she's becoming more like him
[1:41:18] sometimes we try to to you know the uh
[1:41:22] uh uh
[1:41:23] kind of a picture that and and think
[1:41:25] that
[1:41:26] uh uh is in uh you know the
[1:41:30] uh our physical experience
[1:41:35] no doubt eleazar told
[1:41:38] rebecca everything about isaac
[1:41:40] everything that he could remember all
[1:41:42] the questions that she had in her
[1:41:44] physical life she stay her to know him
[1:41:53] praise the lord
[1:41:58] so the thought year tonight is that
[1:42:02] looking at the love of god
[1:42:05] the love of god
[1:42:07] to an age
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:11] not a love of god just to a person
[1:42:15] okay that way that we that we kind of
[1:42:17] put into our day to day life and things
[1:42:20] that are happening around us but look
[1:42:22] beyond that
[1:42:24] what manner of love that the father have
[1:42:26] bestowed upon us
[1:42:30] amen to bring us to the understanding of
[1:42:32] his word
[1:42:37] delivering us from trinitarian teaching
[1:42:40] and all the lies and deception that is
[1:42:42] out there
[1:42:46] people are more attracted to church than
[1:42:48] attracted to the world
[1:42:50] they can argue about what is in the
[1:42:52] world and still defend their system
[1:42:58] that's true
[1:43:03] what matter of love
[1:43:07] that the father have bestowed upon us
[1:43:12] that we can be called the sons of god
[1:43:20] not because of self-righteousness
[1:43:24] praise the lord
[1:43:25] amen
[1:43:28] we can be called sons of god i can say
[1:43:30] i'm a son of god
[1:43:32] not because of my dues and my dawns
[1:43:35] but because of what god has said in his
[1:43:37] word
[1:43:39] and what he has revealed to me
[1:43:46] what manner of love
[1:43:48] that the father
[1:43:49] has bestowed upon us
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:55] praise the lord
[1:43:58] john
[1:43:59] they see him talk that in in in his uh
[1:44:03] gospel
[1:44:06] he came unto his own
[1:44:09] his own receive him that
[1:44:13] but as many that have received him
[1:44:17] he has given them the power
[1:44:22] praise the lord
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:27] he has quaking them
[1:44:29] right
[1:44:30] to many that have received him
[1:44:34] i mean you can receive your until you
[1:44:36] have identified his person
[1:44:39] you identify that this is not a
[1:44:40] trinitarian god this is one god
[1:44:44] that has manifested himself
[1:44:47] in three offices
[1:44:50] you have seen it
[1:44:53] yes sir
[1:44:55] are we together
[1:44:58] that's the thing that quicken you
[1:45:01] is that revelation
[1:45:03] that's the thing that quaking you the
[1:45:05] thing that quaking you that open your
[1:45:07] eyes
[1:45:09] it's not because you came to the message
[1:45:11] it's because you have seen the word
[1:45:15] coming to the message and seeing the
[1:45:16] word is two different things
[1:45:21] you can come to the message because you
[1:45:23] are attracted by the dress code these
[1:45:25] people they can dress right the people
[1:45:26] they can live right all of those things
[1:45:28] can attract you and yet you can see the
[1:45:30] world
[1:45:39] but when you see the
[1:45:42] word when it's quickened to you
[1:45:45] when he appears to you
[1:45:49] you know that you'll be like him
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:58] because all you desire
[1:46:00] is to walk in the light as he is in the
[1:46:02] light
[1:46:09] praise the
[1:46:10] lord you start to say lord your word is
[1:46:14] a lamb onto my path
[1:46:19] i take one step and i put that line
[1:46:21] before me
[1:46:23] as i walk every day
[1:46:26] because i want to be like him
[1:46:28] to be like jesus
[1:46:31] to be like jesus
[1:46:33] praise the lord
[1:46:35] like i said last week
[1:46:37] you know
[1:46:39] theologians will look at that scripture
[1:46:41] and point it to the coming
[1:46:43] of the lord
[1:46:46] when he appear in the sky we will be
[1:46:48] like him
[1:46:55] praise the lord
[1:46:57] but we're talking about a bride that
[1:46:59] should be like her husband
[1:47:03] absolutely
[1:47:04] amen we're talking about a bride that
[1:47:08] should be like a husband
[1:47:13] she's discovering this guy
[1:47:17] she's getting to know her likes and his
[1:47:19] dislike
[1:47:23] she's stepping into it
[1:47:28] praise the lord
[1:47:31] that's how we be like him
[1:47:35] for we see him as he is
[1:47:42] in the light of his word
[1:47:46] that is the bound in power
[1:47:50] so god did he took that approach in
[1:47:52] every age
[1:47:56] when he showed his love to his people
[1:47:59] his the the the highest expression of
[1:48:02] god's love to you
[1:48:05] is for you to see him
[1:48:09] praise the lord
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:15] it's for you to see him god is not in
[1:48:17] this texting game

[1:48:22] would say you were snapping on the word
[1:48:24] you're just you're just taking you know
[1:48:26] [Laughter]
[1:48:30] it's his highest expression
[1:48:32] that's the reason why he became
[1:48:35] flesh
[1:48:39] that's why he took on a system element
[1:48:43] right
[1:48:45] and he was not even satisfied with the
[1:48:48] assisting element he had to come in the
[1:48:50] form of the holy spirit to dwell in you
[1:48:57] that's how much he warned
[1:48:59] you to know him
[1:49:01] how much he wants to you want you to be
[1:49:04] like him
[1:49:09] just coming in the form of a man born of

[1:49:20] and we can all have a part of him
[1:49:26] you cannot you cannot compare that
[1:49:31] to any material gift you know as as the
[1:49:34] asian day that we we we are in uh people
[1:49:38] measure the love of god to uh to
[1:49:41] substance earthly substance
[1:49:44] the love of god is the person of jesus
[1:49:46] christ
[1:49:49] is the person of jesus christ
[1:49:51] because that is the satisfying portion
[1:49:55] when that thing is revealed to you no
[1:49:57] matter what you're going through
[1:49:59] it holds
[1:50:01] it can keep
[1:50:02] it can strengthen
[1:50:05] amen
[1:50:08] that's the satisfying portion
[1:50:18] what manner of love
[1:50:21] that the father
[1:50:23] have been stood upon us
[1:50:28] that we can be called
[1:50:30] the sons of god
