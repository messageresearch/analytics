go over to ruth chapter 3. i just kind of snapped into this thought just when i was praying it was something that i that i came across and and i was blessed by but i actually wanted to continue on talking about the law of nature that we were talking about uh was that last week or so but i fell for the wings tonight and it would be good for us to just share something that is that is more like a like a prayer worship thing praise the lord ruth chapter 3 amen glory be to god amen rule chapter three let's read from verse one then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee you know paul said in the book of hebrew there is a rest for the people of god amen there is a rest unto the people of god shall i not seek rest for thee that they may be well with thee and now is not boss of our kindred with who's meeting there was behold he he wandered about it tonight in the touching floor wash that self this is what i want for us to notice as we study together now wash that self therefore and anoint thee and put that raymond upon thee and get thee down to the floor but but make net that self known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lattereth down that thou shalt mock the place where he shall lay and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do amen and she said unto her all that thou shared unto me i will do amen can we say that to the lord tonight amen all that they are shared unto me i will do let us pray heavenly father you are the worthy lamb lord dear god praying for the servants tonight lord father we ask for your help lord jesus we father lord gary told you if you you you have a way where you come lord and make each service so special to us so father god we trust you tonight and we will just ask that you put us aside lord all garden and father may the people your children lord be exposed to your presence tonight father in the way that pleases you speak to us of god bring yourself out of the pages of your word reveal yourself to our our our eyes for seeing our my our eyes for understanding lord jesus our help for strength and healing oh god oh father lord we want to know you in all of these ways lord father we bless your name tonight we pray for those lord that are now with us tonight father those that are streaming the service lord father we commit them into your hands lord also that you will bless us all in your presence we love you what an awesome god you are what a wonderful father in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen glory be to god we want to greet you again in the name of the lord jesus and with the sins that traveled to washington we said we had a a good service a good time of fellowship praise the lord we thank the lord for [Music] our brother israel and his family coming from arizona they were the speakers on the weekend and we went to support the the service praise the lord amen we also realized that you also had a good service here we were able to follow the service uh and then and see what was happening home so uh uh praise the lord amen you know i believe that uh uh solomon said this in proverbs chapter 15 proverbs 15 verse 23 he said a man have joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good it is praise the lord a man has joy you know when you when you give when you give an answer to a question and sometimes this kind of answer that gives you joy i'm not a ones okay the other ones were you were not even thinking about the answer and you just said it now if this is not like a quiz this is not like uh you studying the message and we come and question you or you've made it no this is just uh uh uh in in conversation you are you are saying something and the lord just help you to say it the right way and sometimes you are even surprised of yourself wow i didn't believe that i said that you know it is not you you know your intelligence does not reach that level praise the lord amen i catch myself many times like that because i know i'm one of the dumbest man around amen but you know like like the scripture says here a word spoken in due season you know brother brandon christian message called spiritual food in due season and we believe that the message of the hour is spiritual food in due season praise the lord so we believe that the the word that god has given to us in this day is the right word spoken for this day amen is the right word that word is enough to be able to address all our situation to answer all of our questions heal all of our sicknesses give us faith for the rapture praise the lord so we see that the message of the hour is a spoken word in due season and solomon said how good it is amen praise the lord and uh and and tonight i want to take a a little talk i just want to show a little principle there let's take uh something also in a book of ecclesiastic i've spoken on that before let's go to to to uh i think that's chapter five i think that's chapter five and i just want to i just want to use that uh after the book of proverbs ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 1 says keep their fault when thou goeth to the house of god and be more ready to year then to give the sacrifice of force for the considering that that they do evil praise the lord amen keep that fought when they are going to the house of god now you see here uh uh [Music] this this uh uh over in uh in uh in the amplified bible is written like this let me read there for you keep their fault give your mind to what you are doing because if if you read it just like the way that the king james say to us keep that fault you think maybe it is just this quiet walk we have to realize that uh the way we worship the way we think and everything that we are doing is our walk before the lord the way we pray it's our walk it's not only the action of moving your legs but the things that you do in the house of god the way you control your thoughts because there is one person that should have our attention is the lord jesus it's not what the neighbor is doing it's not it's not even what the children are doing we're supposed to be by the grace of god so disciplined that we can be able to live our spiritual attention above every destruction praise the lord keep your foot give your mind to what you are doing when you go as sorry as jacob to secret belter praise the lord is strange never even read this to uh from the amplifier today but i was i was praying and i was i was thinking on that same thing i was just telling the lord i said you met jacob in an unusual place he just stopped by to pray and and and saw a rock and he knelt down on the rock and god came down and met him there praise the lord as jacob on the sacred delta to the house of god for to draw nigh to yield and to obey is better than to give the sacrifice of fool carelessly irreverently too ignorant to know that they are doing evil when people just come to church just to show up or come to church just to gather what to go home and talk about than talking about the word but what we want to talk we want to look at here tonight is that that principle of keeping your fault watching your step mining the things that you do as you go into the house of the lord i want to take a principle here from uh from the book of ruth now see your roof now i mean is talking to her daughter-in-law say with all that you have done for me all the service the kindness that you have shown to me praise the lord shall i now seek rest for thee praise the lord amen now you have to look at we you have to look at uh uh uh you look at the scripture like this you have to actually look at who is speaking here and that's the way that the word of god blesses you because sometimes we get so much into the story we look at naomi we look at roof and it's hard for us to see who actually is speaking we have to realize that these people were under the inspiration of the almighty god amen many times they spoke in the first person and the first person of the scripture is not now me the first person is god praise the lord so if now me said shall i not find not find rest now you think about it in your mind this walmart she just came from enzyme she lost everything so think about it on her inspiration how can she find rest for another person how can she ever make her more comfortable than herself she don't have nothing for herself she just returned back even though this is her homeland so you have to see how god almighty god like brother branham said christ is a mystery of god revealed he said god used those people in the old testament they never even knew that they were on the an inspiration of god she's speaking right here in the place of the first person this is god speaking through her i will find rest for thee praise the lord amen you see that all through the scripture moses wrote the first five books of the bible he wrote about his own death he wrote about his own birth now but when moses was writing and as he narrated the story you realize that he's talking about himself but he put himself in the third person praise the lord i'm here to preach i'm not here to teach english grammar amen praise the lord but it's just for for us to see how you know brother branham says god is in acts there is a there is a beautiful at work that is in the scripture that if you if you get the principle of hate i mean the voice of god can come right out of the bible to your soul let's continue tonight she said my daughter shah ah nah fine rest for them that it may be well with thee praise the lord amen now she's sending her over to boss this was the feast before uh uh uh the bali harvest you know after the barley harvest they have a feast of you know a big face so uh she's sending naomi now down to the feast but there are three principles that i want for us to watch here tonight in finding rest three principle in finding race now remember now naomi is telling ruth shall i not find rest for thee and rest for the believer is the holy ghost amen are we together rest for the believer is the holy ghost that's what paul told us in the book of hebrew amen and yeri said she's going to she's going to show naomi a principal oh when i saw this it was so beautiful it was so beautiful she says you go down there the night of the feast and the threshing flow and this is the three principle she said wash thyself that's the first principle anoint thyself that's the second principle and change that remain for you to have rest yes praise the lord now you can just see how the holy spirit this is redemption this is this is the the biggest redemption story in the bible [Laughter] just like how we spoke about ruth you can look at this and uh you can place it in the three stages of grace you can i mean you can just do whatever you want to do with the scripture and just enjoy it for yourself but just wash this now as we would just study together wash thyself anoint thy self and change your women if you want to have rest if you want to enjoy the blessing of redemption if you really want to to enjoy the blessings of the kingsman redeemer these other things to do and she said all that you have said i will do praise the lord are we together now these three uh uh uh steps or these three principles are very major you see them all over in the scripture we look a few types in the bible and and we read some few things from the prophet tonight if we if a time we allow us but you you will see that uh she's talking about finding rest for now me where she would get to the place where she will be established she will get to the place where she will no longer be a stranger she will she will she will be accepted in the beloved praise the lord she will be accepted in the beloved she will come under the blessing of abraham isaac and jacob i will find rest for thee but you should wash yourself that's the first tank you must wash yourself praise the lord amen well i i think you all know where i'm going with there because that's the purpose of the preaching of the word is the watching of the water by the word of god praise the lord so every time we come to service we come for the bath i don't care what what you use to take bath it's not enough for god he has to use this word to watch you if you want to find rest and that's the reason why many people uh around the christian church cannot find rest because because i mean uh uh they they we we get so comfortable you know uh in in our dress code or whatever you know the way we prepare ourselves and people come to the house of god and and and the their mind is looking elsewhere they are looking for something looking for something uh magical to take place they are looking you know like god would just do something a million dollars will fall in your lap or god would just do something you know their their their their struggling habit would just fly away but god has his principle amen when we come to the house of god that's the first thing that is that should be on our mind i'm going to get a good watch by the water of the world it's a step of grace it's a step of redemption you look there in uh leviticus chapter eight you realize that even when god was going to take aaron and his sons into the priesthood the first thing he asks moses to do you must wash them [Music] you must wash them washing is very important and that's what we don't like we like to come to the house of god and be entertained and you know and and you know and just like that but the purpose of the word the purpose of the preaching of the word is to find something in our life to cleanse us sometimes it's not a physical thing sometimes it's a mental thing sometimes is to take us away from all teachings god wants to watch our mind and take us away from a denominational teaching and bring us to rapturing rapturing faith rapturing expectation shall i not find rest for thee you left your loved ones you left the land of moabite praise the lord it was your own confession your god will be my god your people will be my people and you came down here with everything they have said about you they criticize you i mean they call you all sorts of names but yet instead you went in the field and you glean shall i not find rest for you praise the lord oh i believe that god is surely going to give a rest to his people amen with everything that we have gone through and we are going through praise the lord there is a rest unto the people of god praise the lord if we would just follow god if we would follow god step and we will follow his instruction to rest we will have rest in many areas of our life but the thing about it there is that we create in our mind our own way we think that we can get rest praise the lord we con ourselves and say some and then the first stage of grace is justification and the second stage of grace is sanctification and the test sister of grace is the baptism of the holy ghost i believe the mercy i'm justified i'm not you know i'm i'm not in the word anymore i'm sanctified and and uh i believe i have the holy ghost and all of those things are wonderful they are wonderful but yet if we'll be earnest to ourself we'll realize there are areas in our lives that we need rest there are areas in our life that we can't wait to say oh jesus thank you thank you thank you i'm over with this but there is a rest unto the people of god this is redemption rest praise the lord naomi was sending roof on a risky mission she won her don't let the men to see you she was going on a risky mission she was going to provoke her redemption she was going to provoke her redemption because she was going to the tent of boss well after the feast after they have danced and they ate and they drank and then and the music has gone down and they are all tired and sleepy she was going to snake in the tent and watch to see where boris was lying and she would pick up his blanket at his feet and just uncover his feet in a sense just pick his blanket up and just sit right at his feet praise the lord oh i believe he fed the corners of her feet yes who's that it was a risky mission but that's the way she was going to get rest that's the way she was going to get rest she had to rake something but before she get to that risky part of it uncovering his feet these are the three things that she must do you love the lord tonight praise the lord amen glory be to god let's let's look at something here a little bit i'm coming back to those three things you know that's that's what i do i never finish what i'm preaching i mean i just keep running from one end to but it just it just gave me the opportunity to preach more amen let's look here also in ii samuel chapter 12 glory be to god second samuel chapter 12. amen are we together amen now while you're staying in second simon chapter 12 let me read something here from from brother branham redeemer redemption now is advising us to read the old testament he advised us back there when man done wrong god may have punished him for it when a man done wrong god when the men don't write god blessed him for it so ruth was being advised by naomi the old church now brother branham is holding redemption here typing lord and grace typing the old church and the new church with ruth and now meaning ruth the old church what she must do so when it come time for the great feats right after harvest and that's what is on now the great feast so brother branham is typing what is happening here in another sense he's typing the opening of the word as the great feast the six ages has labor amen now we have come to the great feast where the message of god is revealed praise the lord amen so he said that's what is going on now the great feast and watch what ruth vent she goes down and fix herself all up and make herself look pretty and clean she fix herself all up by watching anointing and changing her garment praise the lord now because that there is something that is hidden in here uh uh i i'll keep that one let me go let me let me deal with the first one first uh watching which is the watching of the world about the word you know and and that's what we do every time the word is preached to us but then after the word is preached we create an atmosphere amen the word is being preached for an atmosphere to be created the preacher is preaching you are seeing it in a scripture you say amen thank you jesus oh lord help me watch me you know father i i suppose this place of my life now when we when we have that kind of attitude like like solomon said there in in in ecclesiastes we are watching our feet how we are moving in the house of god not sitting down and be and being critical and and investigating the world in your mind of course when the preacher is saying something that don't make sense you have to investigate it in your mind but i mean when the word is coming we are creating an atmosphere and and what does that does is that the atmosphere you create by responding to the word in your spirit and receiving that word it draws the holy ghost down then an anointing comes in the service praise the lord after the word being preached sometimes it does not take one hour i mean jesus said he that wash his feet his whole body is clean god just need to touch something in your life and you say amen lord yeah am i it draws the anointing down praise the lord amen you see these things they are not things that you can master with your mind the moment we start putting our mind to it and says okay okay yeah okay there then then i think i gotta take back with two buckets of water before i go to church because i really need to be watched glory be to god praise the lord amen that's when god is going to send an evangelist and tell you how long you're staying in the bathroom praise him glory be to god now so you see it's these things are spiritual amen half of the things and and that that take place in the service when we come in here and we sit down and we prayed and the music is playing and we come and sing and uh uh uh i mean most of the things that typically the majority of the things that take place in the service they are all spiritual praise the lord we labor we labor we pray we sing the musicians try to play right the song leader try to sing right we clap our hands we create an atmosphere i mean sometimes people think it's just emotion you just you know we just sing fast song and we get get a place hot and says oh yeah the service was moving today that just working that that does not have anything to do with it it's the way we order ourselves it's the way we order ourselves in the house of god we have our mind on christ we don't see your brother in church we pray for him we don't see your sister we prayed and said lord i don't know why it's been a while i didn't see this brother lord i committed me to your hands whatever is going on around his life the way we order ourselves and then the word comes praise the lord a word spoken in season the preacher can come pick up anything to talk about that he had placed before god that is that is anointed he has warmed under the under the presence of prayer and the holy spirit god is going to take something from that word either to address something in your life or to edify you praise the lord or maybe the heavenly father might come back and just pet you on the back and says i love what you are doing by something the preacher said no that's that should not give you the attitude to raise your shoulder and feed that now you are spiritual but you can just pray in your heart lord help me help me lord keep me humble so that's the first step to rest that's the first step to rest is to be watched the first step to rest is to be watched we have to be watched of our ideas watch of our attitude our nature needs to be watched our brain needs to be watched praise the lord that's the purpose of the word and you know that's the reason why even jesus uh uh uh there the under the the the commission there in the in acts repent and be baptized and you shall receive what the gift of the holy ghost because right after watching every time god's watch you he's not going to leave you dry he's going to come down and anoint you praise the lord every time he watch you when the lord rebuked you and and and point out something in your life and and and and and you you know he just he just he just trouble your heart and just pull your heart apart and your heart feels so broken you cry before god he always have a way to come back and comfort you he's not a god that just come and just rebuke you and tell you how how uh disappointed he is in you and just leave you hot and dry no you always come around and he comforts you what is the comforter the holy ghost is a comforter so every comfort of god is a sense of anointing you with oil praise the lord so we deal with the watching and the anointing but let's look here in ii samuel now uh before i lost my time here praise the lord now ii samuel chapter 12 here brings us to the story of where david fell with the uh the sheba and and the shiva had a child and and nathan came in and nathan rebuked david and all of that and then we realized that the child was sick the bible says the child was sick unto death which means the child was very sick and david went and then he led himself seven days oh uh uh he laid himself before the lord verse 16 and david therefore besought god for the child and he fasted and went in in lay all night upon the earth verse 18 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died praise the lord amen verse 20 that's what i want to bring us to then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel praise the lord can we say praise the lord glory be to god [Applause] now follow follow the follow the reading a little bit because it surprised everybody after the child died the bible said david woke up from the earth he went he washed himself he anointed himself he changed his clothes he worshipped the lord he came in and and started while david was on a such a birthday he was on a such a burden the burden of his guilt the wrong that he had done he was thinking about uriah's and all of this burden the burden of sin was so much on this man he was just crying to god for mercy praise the lord but somewhere in there somewhere in there let's read a little bit and david arose from the earth he watched himself anoint himself and changed his appearance and came into the house of the lord and worshiped then he came to his own house and when he and when he required that the set bread before him and he did it then said his servant unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou they fast and weep for the child why it was alive but when the child was dead that did arise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for it who can tell whether god will be gracious to me and the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again shall i go to him but he shall he says sorry i shall go to him but he shall not return to me and david comforted the shiva his wife praise the lord glory be to god you can see why david he was so designed and favored with god by god to be able to to display some things from the heart of god a man after god's own heart praise the lord amen you can see why david will find favor before god that true the very same woman bathsheba will come solomon that will represent the king of kings amen a son of god that knows what what kind of a communion that david had with god when he kept his face to the earth the things he said to god the cry that he cried to god and the things that he altered from his heart that he can be able to gather the bible says he changed himself and went right into watching right into rest he worshiped the lord and he went home and asked his wife for food and you know talking to everybody praise the lord i believe during that time david was down there god was watching him from guilt praise the lord because david had to walk as the king of israel he has to combine the ahmed of israel the very friends of uriah's he have to walk in the city he have to he was taking praise the lord but you see this when god has delivered a man from the guilt of his sin praise the lord you don't have to hang your heads down anymore praise the lord you say i saw yes i saw god has forgiven me it's not it's not uh it's not in the language of boss no you can also talk like that and be arrogant when you know in your heart you have not dealt with the problem of guilt that's what we spoke about last wednesday forgiveness god comes and relieves you from guilt so here we see david also growing into that same three step it shows that there is something there's this there's a hidden truth there is there's something hidden in there about redemption and that is a very same step that god take us through he watched us by the water of the world he anoint us and he changed our nature he changed our nature we are still wearing the same old body but he changed us from the inside and that is the only way you will find rest it comes by the changing from the inside you can profess everything you want to profess on the outside but if that nature inside is not changed you will never have rest with yourself also every time i want to do good evil is present oh who shall deliver me from this wretched body there was a wall going on within himself praise the lord now under the lord of redemption if you go back to the book of exeter you you realize that when a woman was captured in wall the bible says there are things that that that she would do that was one of the one of the time in the scripture where the woman would have to cut her head and the reason why she would do that is because it's a sign that she's been taken from all of that hair shape and she's brought on a new hair shape that was the only reason why she would do that because head was a representation of head shape but there was another thing that was also done in there she has to be kept in indoor for a period of time and then she will have to change her remy now that changing of the raymond there are a lot of things that is also attached to that one other thing there is that you have to realize that ruth she was a widow and and the way she was dressing has to show that she was a widow there was a way that that weedos would dress and you can look immediately and say oh my goodness she lost her husband praise the lord but now that she was going to be redeemed she no longer had to be in that widow clause now she was going to provoke a man to redeem her oh my goodness i feel like preaching glory be to god now man she was going to be redeemed romans chapter 7 praise the lord amen glory be to god paul says no in that brethren for i speak to them that know the lord how that the lord have dominion over the man as long as he live it for the woman which heart and husband is bound by the lord to her husband so the the the widow way of dressing was something that still bound her to her old husband even though he was dead but she had to dress that way so she cannot be mistaken as other women also i mean young man would not just run after her she had to she had to preserve that respect for her husband but now she's going to be redeemed praise the lord if ruth will have appeared to the feasts dressed in her widow garmin every man will know that she was another man's wife she's still be willing her husband so she has to change oh god man praise the lord but brandon said look nice she has to clean up and look nice praise the lord it's a risky business to look nice glory be to god are we together you love the lord amen and he says so ruth was being advised by naomi in the old church what she must do so so it come time for the great feasts and that's what we all now the great feast and watch what ruth did she goes down and fakes herself all up ah if she was tying her hair she took that thing off and then threw it away got before the merit and did all of this twist it this way she said i'm going to put a do on my hair tonight that this that these hebrew girls i've never seen glory be to god fix herself all up and make herself look pretty and clean pretty and clean she has to make sure that it don't fail what was she looking for she was looking for rest she was looking for rest she was looking for the holy ghost she had to clean herself of every filthy thought in her mind clean herself up praise the lord i believe that's where the church supposed to be that's where the people ready for a rapture supposed to be when we lie down on our bed do we ask ourselves thank lord is this going to be the night father maybe i might not wake up i might just break up into eternity praise the lord how do we go to bear with our phones in our hands and something on facebook is playing you are snoring away [Music] because the phone got tired watching you pretty and clean and wind boys laid on the floor that night young woman beautiful morally righteous she had to put her confidence in boss without ignoring him she had to put her confidence in boast without ignoring him that's that was what signifies by her lifting his uh his covering at his feet and for her to sit at his feet the man could get angry the man could disgrace you so it was a risky business praise the lord are we together my daughter shall i not find rest for you think about it how god service after service he's trying to find rest for you he's trying to bring you to the place where you can understand this message well you can start looking at the message like it's it's something about lord
