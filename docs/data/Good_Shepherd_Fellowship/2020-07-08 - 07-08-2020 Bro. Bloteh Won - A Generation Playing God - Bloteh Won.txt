service have a prayer burden year and this morning while we were praying having our home devotion and I just I just thought about I was kind of thinking about missionaries I had missionaries on my mind this morning and I was thinking with I mean the airport the worst shutdown let me say that waiting and all the traveling restriction and all of that and because you know the the calling is actually a burden you know so you think about it missionaries that are reaching out to souls in different area and they having this burden on the AHA and and they can now be able to get on the plane and travel overseas and or whether they have to to you know get you a jungle or whether they have to get on the street and they just have that burden on their heart you know because God is not going to port his ball his burden on pause because the world is shot down you know and I was just thinking about that this morning and I said oh my goodness you know so while we were praying I know our just a bit birding and praying for different missionary Lord there's part of all of that I know you are still helping your people in whichever way they can be able to get across you know two souls and and then thinking about even those that are you know testifier and sharing their the gospel they had never come in contact with the message they are only carrying the name of Jesus Christ telling someone that Jesus died for their sin in all of this you know I was just praying for those different ones this morning and then I got a call from idea saying that otomí of a report of some of the missionary brothers in China you know being arrested you know I mean I think China is now cracking down on most of those home churches you know in or there and I think that report also came through clover there because cover their works with many of those believers you know so there are three of them that were arrested in prison I think one is out of prison and there are two that are that are there so we want to just remember those those things in in different things that are in different situation so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and let's just play Libby beer leave it the elastic for birdies tonight brother Andrews also told me that he lost his grandmother back home so we want to pray for their family and all the preparation that we are making back that the grace of God will be able to just comfort them in difficult times whatever burden that is on your heart let's just use this time these few meanings and just take our heart to the throne of grace and and just speak to the Lord and I mean we can just talk to him as our friend as I was Savior as I walked our Lord the lover of our soul [Music] take those burdens to the Lord and leave it there yes leave it there Oh leave it there

turn into the book of Philippians and Philippians chapter 2 so we want to speak from tonight praise the Lord I was I was let's read the scripture and then we will we find Philip in Chapter two let's read from verse one if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself is there at seven one another as we as we serve God look not every man on his own thing but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a seven and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross amen Heavenly Father we approach your word now and in acts the laws you will come and use these few meanings before us and speak to us Lord we are so grateful father God we can be able to come in reference to your word you have given us a hat to believe Lord so to receive so God coming see Austin I speak to us Lord we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you may have your seat I want to talk speak on I thought that I was I was thinking about that I entitled playing God we have to realize there as I had a prophecy God said his glory he will share with no man and and the reason why I came to this thought was on this scripture that we have just read I was reading something as some believers were fellowshiping you know in you know in all of these social media fellowship you know sharing thoughts and sharing coats you know in different thing wish of course they were they were very beautiful beautiful but this is where I thought that that caught my attention on this on the scripture were the Apostle Paul said were been in a form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God I might be maybe is is because of you know my level of understanding or I might be wrong in the way that I perceive the conversation but most of the time this trip sure is it's taught off as if you know Jesus our Lord Jesus you know looking at the phrase here thought it not robbery to be equal with God I think maybe is the word equal that makes many people to think that the Apostle Paul was saying that Jesus never wanted to make himself equal with God but I don't think that's what he was saying you know I don't think that's what he was saying because jesus said I am the father I want so Paul was not saying that Jesus even though he was he was God but he never wanted to be equal with God I think what the Apostle Paul was saying here is that he never taught it robbery he never taught calling himself god or the son of God he was robbing God of anything praise the Lord and because many times people think they're you know this Holy Ghost gospel robbed you know God is not a robbery I think over and over in his word he France at robbers you know and God would not rob any man because you know sometimes the state of robbery is the other the person that you are robbing is better than you a mean even if they don't have nothing but for you to just put them to a place where you have to rob them of what they have is it's a sign that they are better than you but you know God will not rob a man you know of anything and I don't think they're poor men there and but that's there that is what I was hearing in the conversation and so a caught my mind I decided to go back to the scripture that decided to read it meditate upon it and so it was on my mind so I thought about okay I would just speak on there tonight I know I have spoken on on the message taught it now robbery you know thinking it now robbery you know I mean desiring the Holy Ghost you are robbing God brother branham see is just like that the fish in the water you know trying being afraid to drink because if he's like you know the ocean might go dry you know but it's in and we are dwelling in an inexhaustible fountain that can never goes dry so I believe that the Apostle Paul year was saying for us let us let this mind be in you this this mind should beating us just like it was in Christ Jesus and he being in the form of God thought it not robbery you know as children of God you know to believe there we can rob our Father there will be a wrong taught you know we can never rob God everything we have he has given it to us you know and he gave it to us for us to be able to use it for his glory you know so Paul is encouraging us that we should have this mind that was in Christ and the mind I was in Christ is there whatever we Acts of the Father he would give it to us the mind I was in Christ is dead the father want his children to be just like him praise Lord the mind I was in Christ is that he he did nothing except the father revealed to him he want this mind to be in us he want us to grow in a statue where we have come to this place to understand that we are attributes of God we are children sons and daughters of God and we must be able to reflect the nature of God we must be able to live a life that man will see the goodness of God and glorify our Father so let this mind be in you let this mind be in you that you get to the place word you will never think it robbery to be equal to God praise the Lord now but as we look at this together I would want us to to go over to to Genesis chapter 3 I think that's where the problem is because the Bible led us to know that God made man in His image you know and in his likeness he breathed into man and man became a living soul you know so he made us that we must we might look just like him you know I was I was I was plain as all song of the life fountains is the song says speaks of family resemblance you know it says you look just like your daddy you know family resemblance that's that's a beautiful song I think that kind of a wrote down the chorus I think it you know when I enjoy family resemblance you know the father want us to look just like him praise the Lord so when we get over here in Genesis chapter 3 we realize there is there is something there that I you know I can't afford the caught my attention here I know we have talked about it before is what happened over there in the Garden of Eden and we would get into this conversation you know the serpent speaking to the woman you know and a woman answering back to the 7 reading from verse one now the serpent was more subtil anti beasts of the field which the Lord God has made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree wishes in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die you know I was also thinking about Revelation chapter 5 if you go in Revelation chapter 5 and it starts to talk about the book of Redemption they similar words I'd use you know a book that no man was walking you know to look upon no man was water to handle you know to to touch and and in one of you but I'm not going to tonight and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God does know that the vanie thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil now we know they were made in the image of God they were made in the likeness of God so they were the children of God they were they were they were amateur girls that's what we know because Adam could speak you know and he was the one that named the things in the garden and out of there we know that they were but you see there was something that was playing out here and that's what I want to bring our mind to tonight I believe that the enemy by his life he robbed Adam Eve of that garlic in image that he had their innocent mind they had to only do the will of the father because there was something playing out here he says here that for god knows day the damn you either of your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil now we know also over in the Book of Isaiah you know Lucifer desire to ascend his throne above the stars of God to be worshipped as God you know he appalled let us know in the book of Corinthians and he's the god of this evil age but this is what I wanted to bring us tonight let's just read some few things here from brother Branham and making emphasis on on the Philippian scripture verbatim said in a message he saw by himself he says now has God I mean he says now God has made a promise and he he told Abraham what he would do he took his heart he saw by himself no greater so God himself oh there he was in the pillar of fire he was in Christ Jesus all that he was in the pillar of fire he was in Christ in Christ Jesus the Bible said the Bible said that God empty you know what you do when you empty anything God empty into Christ Paul says for it was God in Christ reconciling the world amen just think God empty himself into Christ and Christ taught it not robbery to be equal with God for he was God I mean that's the thing they killed him for breaking the Sabbath day making himself God so just like I said the word equal with God sometimes troll the the explanation of that scripture that even though he was God he never wanted to be equal with God no he never taught it robbery if he says he was God he never thought he was doing anything out of Scripture or out of you know the plan of redemption when he said I and my father I want he never told he was out of the plan of God when he said if you have seen me you have seen the father he never taught a robbery praise the Lord you see and that is the position of the Sun shake even waved the the the story of the prodigal son he talked what the father had given him that's the gift of the father he took that inheritance he went down he wasted ain't you know but he never talked that he robbed his father all he thought was he that that is his father and his father give him what belongs to him he father give him a portion of the inheritance it was not like he felt like a robber yeah he had to go and submit himself over to told to the police or to the council of that day he says that's the thing they killed him for breaking the Sabbath making himself God and he was the lord of the Sabbath he was God in man with Christ God in Christ reconciling the world to himself now and everything that God was he empty in to Christ praise the Lord and and I mean that's that is the place that I was I was thinking about you know because I just think the other it's a beautiful weight I mean a very beautiful way Paul place their scripture over them in the book of Philippians you know Paul like brother branham said Paul was not among the twelve disciples we all know that you know he came in the book of Acts after his experience on the road of Damascus so you see Paul way that's that's a beautiful way he said it even in a book of Philippians Paul way of talking about Christ was net true the effli Ministry of Christ Paul way of talking about Christ you you will see their self there's a scripture year let me find there for you is it's also over in the book of Philippians Paul talking about Christ he never talks from his birth he talks from the resurrection of Jesus Christ you know he comes from the resurrection because it is after the resurrection is the resurrection of Jesus Christ that even make the breath of Jesus Christ most significant if he wouldn't have come out of the grave the the story of his birth was just going to be a myth it was going to be wash away praise the Lord Amen so this was God in Christ reconciling the world God was net I mean Christ was not thinking it that he was robbing God of anything that's the reason why he acts that whatsoever we can accent in his name you know we can go straight to the throne of grace and ask the father brother Branham also said this in the message to Exeter I want to take this as a second coat tonight he says we are in an accident and leaving and turning turning the tips off in a moment all my friends brothers both present and that we hear the tape as your brother a citizen of the kingdom of heaven come out this is an accident now the thing that caught my attention on this code is there in an accident for their accident according to the promise that God gave to Abraham he says I'm going to come down amen he says I'm going to come down and with a mighty hand I will bring them out praise the Lord so when he met Moses there in the burning bush he told Moses for I have heard the crying of my people and I'm coming down and I'm come down to deliver them so you see that the Ministry of Moses for Moses to get out there and call flies into assistant and call flees he never talked he was robbing God and again he was not playing God because that is word my inspiration is tonight playing God there is a difference of a man playing God and a man not taking a robbery to be equal with God because we are in a generation that is playing God I mean a generation that believed that they can define what is good and evil that's what the devil told Eve for God knows that if you do this you will be like God knowing good and evil in a sense saying defining good and evil good and evil is not defined by what we think or how we feel good and evil is defined by the Creator by the Word of God so there is a difference of playing God praise the Lord and and and that is where the the church is that is where the Christian faith is you know when we play church like a like you think about this in it in the 10 commandments what the Bible says do not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain most of the time we have taught from our Sunday school days is that I mean just don't call God name on anything I mean just don't say Jesus without a reason but taking the name of God in vain it's more than that because Paul says let every one that name the name of Christ depart from evil so taking the name of the Lord in vain is the way we are representing him as Christine if we are giving a poor represented representation of Christianity we are taking the name of the Lord in vain praise the Lord if we have the name of the Lord just like brother Branham says if the Egyptian knew they would have taken their stick from Moses it daniil he says that is just how the name of Jesus Christ is in the church and we have the name of Jesus Christ just like the stick the Moses heart that he could stretch the stake and open the Red Sea stretch the stake and call for flies and flee that is a scene where we can call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and and affirm our prayers with that and God has promised to meet her at the very point of our needs so if we are having the name of Jesus Christ just like that stake was in the hands of Moses and then we don't know what to do with it and then we are complaining a meaning and we are doing everything that we are doing we are taking the name of the Lord in vain can you imagine that God gave Moses that Commission right from that experience work heat roll the the stick down it turned to a serpent he pick it up by the tail it turned back to his sake and and with all that he have experienced in the presence of God and he goes down there to the house of Pharaoh and don't even know what to do praise the Lord he goes down there in the house of Pharaoh and he drove his stick down and jeans and jam brews come and throw the stick down and Moses said oh wow I mean he's running away because he have seen an impersonation of what he have done it's almost like all the impersonation that turns to bring intimidation on the believer a son of God a daughter of God must know where they are standing with God because we are not taking on the name of a church we're not taking on the name of our messenger we are taking on the name of Jesus Christ because when when when after the marriage is done the marriage officer pronounced and husband a wife and a woman takes on the name of her husband praise the Lord there's a group of people that think you know they are thinking it's robbery to be called the bride of Jesus Christ amen it's robbery for us to think that we are the people that are going to experience the body change in the rapture so we have two groups here we have one group that is playing God defining good and evil and we have another group of people that is thinking it's not robbery I can ask God for big things because he's my father if I if I seen if I make me sick I can run to the throne of grace and repent like the prodigal son because he's my father now boy I never thought that he robbed his father he never taught a robbery he never taught that he robbed his father he was just disappointed in himself that he never did what he thought he was going to do and because he never taught a robbery that was the reason why he came back home and soft for mercy where Bentham said I mean Jesus said that ever comes to steal kill and to destroy is one that is not of the household that comes to rob a man that is of the household never robbed his parents it so maybe he want to take his his inheritance earlier than he should have it well after all you brought him into the world you are responsible for him or for her are we together and we trained him for them to be able to best represent the parent so I'm looking at this table said I'm telling Eve for God knows that it did you eat this think you can play God you can be able to define [Music] good and evil if it is not the generation that we are living in if it is not the time that we are living in and it's I mean it's so it's so it's so bad that even children of God and in people that's supposed to know the Word of God and and and and what has been given to us in this age instead of taking God's Word praise the Lord Manny this was Naren until I have said something I was talking to to an any video today and he said something that I thought was just so you know well so I told you my sis I mean what you are telling me how can you define that in the Word of God you know trying to counsel these people in some problem is what I think you know we need to have a separation as how how can you put separation in the marriage coveting working you do it this is well [Music] Abraham a lot when I couldn't understand one another D separated that's it brother a brain in love with my husband and wife and that is the attitude of playing God when a man and a woman will net Homer themself to the Word of God and they are just caught up in their minds and think they are what they are thinking in your mind is God is God's because they are thinking about it so it's right it is it the generation I say follow your mind or follow your heart that is playing God you are not taking God's words you are not living according to God's Word you are just following your heart when your heart is desperately wicked and you can even define it that's the issue we are in where as I said a call good for evil and evil for good what actually they are trying to do they are trying to define what is right they are trying to define what is truth if it is not in the Pope the popular media is not truth that is playing God trying to force on us a generation to tell us that well you know this whole gender thing you are playing God and when the devil God Eve to play God he robbed her of that golly to be that the thing of her being and a daughter of God because she was me right from the hands of God just like Adam was there were me in the image of God there were gods so you see the devil comes he rubbed us from our truth image and he gave us a wrong image for us to be playing Church taking the name of the Lord in vain saying we are believe in the world we are going in the rapture and I even living up to it that's the generation that we are in a generation that is trying to that's what we are having all of these voices that is streaming out all of the voices that are streaming out the YouTube movement and all of these voices black by matter all of these things they want to play God praise the Lord I was just looking at something the other day a group of young people went into a church and caused a riot and says the church is not doing nothing for the community so that is the way that they have to make this church hold this church accountable to do something for the community as myself I said how many of them I just taught about our little assembling we drive 30 minutes 20 minutes and everybody drives to come to church and the people right around them they see people driving in that place week in and week out praise the Lord that's the generation that we are living in a generation I want to play God they think there they are the definer of what the society is going to be praise the Lord and we have these are the believers on this side that is so scared so scared to take God at His Word thinking that if they do it is I mean they're going to be robbing God of anything praise the Lord what is the danger of trusting that God is going to do it what is the danger of looking taking God at His Word and believing that the same God that made the Sun - hangs in the heaven the god I said let there be and there was Lord if that's your word I'm hauling to this world when people compromise to be able to bring their desire to pass you are playing God you are playing God because you can wait on God provision so you have to make your own way to be able to provide your needs by breaking God's Word that's how can we have end up with a God of this evil age that's how Satan has been set on the throne of this age as the god of this evil age because he had a bunch of people you know his attributes that are playing out because that's why he want to do he just wanted to play God I was my throne above the stars of God and I will be like God it just playing God defining what is right and what is wrong what is truth and what is lie the age is caught right in there but there is a group of people there is a group of people there is a little branch there is a remnant of people that will not think it robbery there will not think it robbery I mean a son that would think in his mind to rob his father I mean he has been corrupted he he has taken on an evil heart fine a son must be able to go to the Father and if he asks the father his father don't give him what he asked for for that time it's all because the father is not trusting him that he has grown to that level to be able to handle it and that's how Almighty God deals with us we misrepresent the name of Christ we create stomach blood before people you are taking the name of the Lord in vain because when everybody knows you are a believer in everybody knows you are a Christian you it is it is not you I mean we we try to think that we are the one you know that they are persecuting when when Jesus made poured on the road of damasco war he said what are you persecuting me Paul never met him in the flesh but those Christians were bearing the name of Christ so it was the name of Christ that he was coming against and that is the same thing that you and myself are bearing we are bearing the name of Christ that we have to think about that it is not our individual live in our individual choice and any things that we want to do that's what we are in an ambassador is there is a kid 'm that you are representing and you know the embossing even though they are away from home but behave just like when you get there it's just like you are home they try to get I mean they try to put things around so any when you enter the Empire you feel like you are home I got a little bit scary when I was reading that thing and I see believers you know assuming that you know Jesus even though he was gone but he humbled himself he never wanted for them to know that he was gone I don't think that's what the Apostle Paul was saying he was trying to encourage us to get in the same mind the see mind that if we go to God in prayer as a son of God as a daughter of God having the mind and thinking it not robbery it gives us the right to be able to boil it ask the Father because we know we are not robbing God of anything when he gave us the Holy Ghost he does not rob us of anything that is our original nature that's the place we were supposed to be and that's what people are afraid of the new birth because the thing their world is going to make them order is going to make them different they still want to hold on to this sinful nature and sinful life Newberg does not take our sinful nature automatically but it gives us grace to be able to face that devil in the face and since there's a new men are living in this house so that just the two thoughts I wanted to bring to us tonight a generation that is playing God and think they are the one that can be able to define what this nation will be and all of the things they are doing out there throwing their monuments and all of that that I mean is if they are thinking that by doing that they would define what I mean what actually it is they will be able to make a statement that's the devil's gospel that was what he preached to our parents when we are confronted with the truth of God's Word and we think that we have a better way to do it leaving that word you are playing God taking the position of the world you are not thinking a robbery that God I can take your word just like you know the angel told John take the book and eat it the very same book that no man was water to look upon Norman was wanted to touch no man was wanted to read John was told to take the book and eat it because true Redemption Christ has brought us to his worthiness he has brought us to the same place where he is where I am there you will be also that's what he said before we get there physically spiritually he has brought us to that place thinking it not robbery to be equal with God brother Branham says I get back on that a exeter coat again we are in an exodus and leaving and turning the tape off for the moment all my brother my brothers both pressing and i will hear the tape as your brother a citizen of the kingdom of heaven come out this is an accident for all that's left behind will bear the Mac of the beasts come out of Babylon come out of confusion come out of this system and self the Living God this great danger of the coveting that was traveling with Israel in the form of the pillar of fire by night the pillar of cloud by day they had angel of the covenant he says Jesus Christ in the form of God thought it not robbery but become equal with God now he's a pillar of fire in the same form that he was back there breaking the first exit of breaking the second accident and year he is waved at a exeter now what I'm trying why I read this quote is as we are in this Exeter we see darkness all around us the promise that God gave to Abraham was that he will come down and with a mighty him he will bring them out and in the second Exeter he came down again that's why I crashed ought it not robbery to be equal with God and in this day Exeter that same angel of the Covenant has come down so we have the privilege to be able to deal with God directly it is not a lower form of God that is in our mess it's the same God they seem yesterday today and forever that is the reason why we came boiling go to the throne of grace we can boil it ask the father all that god help us to come to the place and know that when we live for our voice we are talking to the creator of heaven and earth we're not talking to someone that would take our prayers to the throne of grace nothing in the robbery to be equal with God because when we get to that place we will fall victim of this generation that is playing God and failure to take God by His Word and staying on his promises living the life of a make believer and I mean in compromising on the promises of God and not being able to trust God not being able to trust God Berta Branham says the greatest thing that is hammering the Church of the Living God hammering the people of God is fear not being able to trust God to know that he promised that I will be with you even in you to the end of the age Moses never taught it robbery when Jesus says said unto this mountain be thou removed for you to do that you also think in that robbery to be equal with God for you to be able to speak to your situation take a burden to God in prayer and say Lord I need you to deal with this the enemy will come and blast our mind with all of our our past life and all of the wrongs that we have done why because he want us to just play play God instead of being sons and daughters of God he want us to find other means to be able to define what is good for us beside the Word of God you know that's the reason why brother Branham says when we are fussing with one another the devil does not have a work to do because he knows these guys are just playing church but when a man or a woman a young brother sisters standing on the Word of God and thinking and now robbery to be equal with God I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I have a right to the father's inheritance let's bow our heads tonight we have to believe that we've been told that the enemy the devil will rather push us across the promised put it to the future or hold us back and say it's not for us in the age and the time and everything that is happening around us just like it was in the first Exeter gone came down and he was Vale in the prophet Moses and because the people the knew of his birth they knew what he did all of those things clouded their minds and it got to the place and said what do you think about yourself Moses you think too much about yourself Moses was not playing God it was God that has raised him to that position as a son of God as a daughter of God he want to bring us to that place where when we speak now boastfully not proud nor we speak Naurang that he promised he would never leave us he would never forsake us [Music] we know our father is in control of everything he rules the universe I mean if uh if a son of God a daughter of God a brother or sister trying to speak of the word of God and hovering guilt in their hearts like the scripture said if our heart condemn us net we have confidence we can speak in the name of God we can stand for the word of God Claude can be able to use our lives he can be able to use our humble Christian life to be a witness but when we are allowing things in our lives trying to play God and and define what we think is good and what would thing is evil we even fight against the Word of God we fight against the Word of God that small stare voice is speaking to our heart but we just get so stuck in our stubbornness because sit on the same you can be gone you can play God every man that have ever tried to play God throughout the ages when the Pharaoh taught that he high everything on a control and he had the Hebrews honor his grape and he was playing God determining when they should go to bed and when did she rise up and when did she eat when God raised up a son he raised up a standard in Egypt Pharaoh confess and he knew there was an Almighty God this generation that is playing God and thinking that they can be able to determine would as a man and would it's a male and what marriage supposed to be in and and everything that they have out there oh there is a little ribbing of people there's a little bride as a little son and daughter of God that is taking instruction from God's Word we are not taking instruction from today's media and social media we are taking our instruction from God's Word we're not playing God neither are we thinking it robbery to be sons and daughters of God that's what we are that's what he have caught us tow that's why he has given us his spirit for us to represent him for us to live out like a son and daughter of God when no one is around and no one is watching be a son of God be a daughter of God if not you will be playing God
