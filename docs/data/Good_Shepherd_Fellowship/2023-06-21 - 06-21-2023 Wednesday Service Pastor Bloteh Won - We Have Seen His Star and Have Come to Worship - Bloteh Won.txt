thank you brother Hillary for leading songs thank you Saints for worshiping praise the Lord singing unto the Lord and we want to continue worshiping the Lord through the preaching of the word now amen so uh let's let's turn to Matthew chapter 2 Matthew chapter 2 foreign Matthew chapter 2 praise the Lord Matthew chapter 2. amen let's read from verse 1. I want to bring Christmas early for you today [Music] amen let's why not have an early Christmas well this is a famous scripture we read around Christmas but it's actually not a Christmas only scripture amen so let's read verse one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his tie in the east and I come to worship Him praise the Lord since we've been talking about worship is so faith for us to go this direction tonight we have seen his time and have come to worship Him I hope that's what you have seen I hope that's what had drawn you here amen not the church we must see his time and and that style will pull you into true worship we have seen his time and I come to worship let's pray tonight Heavenly Father oh dear lord we are so grateful father we are so grateful for a people so grateful Lord therefore this little assembly Lord that uh you have blessed us with and the people that you have also trusted to us oh God dear Lord father without your ability in the leadership of your Holy Spirit we will make Lord gather a mess of this Lord and that's why we need you we need you every hour and leaving this hour right now father that uh uh realizing that God we are not here for the Showmanship we are here for the Lord to be able to bring worship to you through the yearing of your word and the preaching of your word so Lord we we want to be captured in the sense of this Lord I believe Lord father that uh you the holy spirit is dealing with our local assembling trying to bring us to the place of worshiping God is spiriting in truth father Lord God and uh through the different messages Lord father God from all of the brothers Lord Jesus you you seem to be dealing with us in this direction and oh god father it is not something that we can produce of ourself is not something Lord God their father we can manufacture but lord it's something that you have called us to and if we surrounded ourselves you will produce it through us because it is your work so father we pray that God you will bless the word now that we will be going into bless your children that are streaming into the service from home and oh God bless us that are here tonight we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you let me have your seed school to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh who to have a each and every one of you and we can all come together and fellowship tonight around the world praise the Lord before we go into what we want to speak about uh I want to remind you uh July uh the the middle week there of July around the 16th uh 15 16 that entire week is going to be our uh Good Shepherd Fellowship will be getting around 28 years around that weekend since uh the inspiration came on the on the brothers that started this local assembly it will be about 20 80 years and uh I really never felt doing anything about anniversary until uh uh because in my mind I was I was believing that God will will do something Supernatural for us I lie I I I'm learning to believe God for big things amen praise the Lord I'm learning I'm not there yet I'm learning praise the Lord and uh you know uh uh uh Elijah said to Elijah what you asked for it's a hard thing praise the Lord and then sometimes we might ask God for hard things so we were believing that if if you know uh that the law will bless us some days to have a uh little building with little space than base let me now say a better building because this this is a better building amen praise the Lord and if for now is holding every one of us so it's a better building praise the Lord and and so let me now see a better building but a more special place okay a place that would be more special than uh than this place so uh we are believing God for that and I thought uh you know the law was going to bring it our way soon but I think you know uh maybe he want us to to um learn to start appreciating this one more so when we leave it we can miss it amen praise the Lord so uh that was that was some of the reason why we did this renovation you know uh opening the space even though uh uh Kovac came right into that but it was not mainly because of covet the plan was we were thinking to do at 25th anniversary so I felt like uh sensor uh as a pastor we couldn't give you a new building let's just paint it let's make it look new okay take the rooms from back there put a little book there then brother Jordan did all of that uh design for us and uh as it was it was one day I was I was here uh studying I was in the office the office used to be right back there where I brought a belt and uh sister Grace they are sitting there right in their office they praise the Lord that's why the old office used to be and then it just it just it just you know it just hit my mind and I went back there to the cry room I measure the space I said well I think I can put an office here and we can get rid of that and and then I saw the idea to brother Jordan he says well and uh it is said and let it be done praise the Lord put his stem on it and and but that coming week we will we will we want to just have something we want to do it in-house we want to do it in-house and uh just just so we can remain humble we want to do it in-house so it's going to be a house thing even though we will be selling invitation out to few of the brothers uh you know there has there has two with us all of these years where the prayer will be speaking for us that uh that we can and I think uh that Saturday brother Jordan has both right for everyone that can make themselves available I hope you are reading the flyer uh uh that's what they are praying the fall that's why they were handed out to you and uh and and some other things and what is what is also uh amazing with that is that uh uh I'm also coming around 30 years in the ministry and I told you a couple of years ago that when I get 30 years then I will be more serious I'll be more mature for 30 years is the age of maturity in the ministry so I'm getting getting around 30 years praise the Lord so uh I feel good about it because I'm two years older than the church so I feel I feel very good about it praise the Lord so I just I just said there just to remind you and uh so what I would like for us to do while I I don't know maybe at the beginning of the July month or maybe that week I want for us to just uh uh get back to our prayer chain you know where we will have uh people on certain hours of the day praying and for one another praying for the need of this church and uh I just want for us to just commit at this place in the hands of the Lord amen that the Lord will will help us and then he will he will bless us and be with us so tonight just like we have read you know there was there was an amazing thing that took place on Sunday uh experienced the scene when I was down in Anchorage preaching uh I I caught I caught the court in uh and uh and I started becoming sick but it's Saturday night service I mean we had a wonderful service we had I mean the power of God came down so strong one young brother was preaching and uh you know and I could just feel I could feel healing going through my body so during the prayer line there were a lot of people that came out to pray and the pastor asked that we come out to pray and just before that I found myself sweating you know uh and Anchorage was cold around that time that's that's what gave me the call so uh uh and I was going to preach the next morning to close the meeting so I think the Lord came in a special way to heal me and strengthening me for the service in the morning and then he blessed the meeting and I felt the same way on Sunday I mean when I was when I was here asking brother Jordan to come up I mean I was just not myself I was singing with the kids and I spoiled their song because I didn't have voice and I just couldn't stand up too long I was just feeling I don't know what is there but uh uh but while I was in the office and the service was going on listening to the word uh I just I just felt the presence came over me and and since then I've been feeling much better than I said I mean Fair before the service so I thank the Lord for that amen I thank the Lord we have seen his style in the east and I come to worship Him Praise the Lord now so I I want to speak on there tonight and uh the reason is the other uh Jordan pick up from where we were speaking and I think is the leadership of the holy spirit because I I was going to go into there the father seeketh such to worship so uh uh that's that's what I want to go to tonight praise the Lord that's where I want to go to tonight first I would like to before I start uh just just to be able to give you an idea here I would like to to look at this word uh uh in the I took this from out of the the concordance the Bible concordance of the Hebrew concordance the words seek the word sick the father seeketh such to worship praise the Lord now uh I will not be able to pronounce that Hebrew word and uh but the the idea that I want for us to get here is the other just like over in Genesis chapter 3 when men fail the Bible says God came down in the code of the evening and he started to say call out Adam Adam where are you praise the Lord and he was he was because you come down in the evening for Fellowship you come down in the evening for worship and uh and Yaris said that he he came down for worship and Adam was was nowhere to be found I mean Adam has has cut has got himself in another situation and and he was trying to hide himself from the presence of the Lord so here's God coming down in the court of the evening and then he's calling out to Adam he's calling out to Adam he's he was actually calling you know to that to that uh uh uh uh Divine representation that was in Adam he was calling to Adam's Soul Adam here in his body is standing in condemnation Adam in his body he's standing in the field of what he have done but but God calling him not in the sense that God don't know what Adam have done or God don't know where Adam is or The Situation he's in but God was calling him because that's what we are made for praise the Lord that's what we are made We Are Made To Worship the Lord we are made for Fellowship that's what God never wanted to be lonely he decided to express himself so he can have people in every age that's why a prophet will say God will never be without a witness the whole world can go crazy the whole world can go into I idolatry the whole word I mean they can blaspheme God will always have a witness and then he will I always have one Soul he will have one person that will be crying unto God I need more of God praise the Lord amen I want to get back to the house of God I want to get I want to experience what they experience on the day of Pentecost so God will never be without a witness because his purpose of creation yeah his purpose of creation was for Fellowship amen was for Fellowship it was for him to express himself and that we can be able to know him in the way he expressed himself and that is the thing that draws us to God mold and mold and more praise the Lord so I was looking at this and I was kind of for studying this uh uh all through the week so if you look here you will see of Uncertain affirmity to seek literal uh literally or figuratively you will see also in the in the in the in the uh uh the Hebrew sense to worship a means in God and it says here also this this is where it caught my attention uh yeah it says all in a bad sense to plot so you see in every age God plotted against you he plotted against you he decided to trap you I was looking at it also in in the Greek as we go down we'll bring we'll bring more to you in a bad sense to plot against life to go to about desired endeavoring inquiring required to seek after to seek after for means to compare praise the Lord so what what the the sense that I want for us to get here is that God was the first messenger after the fall he was the first messenger Brother Band said when he fell when man fell God never sent an angel to call him back God came down himself praise the Lord and and what he was doing is that you think about this Adam fell and God came down called Adam with with with a bleed with a bleeding skin in his hands yeah praise the Lord or in other mind he's he's condemning and and uh uh I mean he's he's hiding himself but God already make a provision he's coming down with the provision he's not asked he's not coming down and telling Adam you go clean yourself up and come back to church he's coming down with the provision praise the Lord everything that we need to get in the presence of God is provided by God it's not when we stay away to make ourselves right no but as we come into the presence of God he handles things over to us by his spirit praise the Lord so God comes down with the bleeding King and he says Adam Adam where are you and and he has the ablities came before him that's the first thing that Adam saw praise the Lord amen I believe when Adam saw the blood [Music] you know he got nervous he says wow but you see the the blood of that top of that bleeding lamb also identify with the blood that Adam saw where he fell right are we together now so you see then God comes and he take the bleeding skin and then he wrap Adam in that skin so what is so what is he doing in one sense he's comparing Adam whether you like it or not this is the purpose why I created you you can't get away from it amen what are you liking is not your choice of being here tonight in as much as you make all effort to be here it's not your choice is God all through the day since you wake up he starts wavering in the cells of your body in your heart in your mind doing things in in whatever way whether you have to go to work whatever we had to do throughout the day but in some way he make things to work our world our mind was made up I'll be in church tonight praise the Lord so the father seeking such it's not that uh uh uh uh uh he's looking and begging people no in every age the reason why God sent the prophets throughout the ages the reason why he sent the messenger through the Gentile age was to be able to call his children to wash it this message has come to sort us a fine us to bring us to the place of Truth worship that I will bring us to the place of of a worship that is now only limited in church right praise the Lord bring us to the place the consciousness amen that Consciousness that we have we have of God in the things that we do the things that we say are we together so the father has come to compare us praise the Lord guarding himself on his throne he watched over our lives and he set up his time about this time I'm going to get down I will deal with that heart of that man or that woman they might not understand is it God God you know God is now so much concerned about you understanding what he's doing because he know he will bring you there if you try to figure it in your on your own you will never get there he knows that he will bring you there so his problem is not to make you to understand first praise the Lord amen that's what blood Brown said in the message one that she said he says uh uh uh God on the day of Pentecost he said God distributed himself Amen in the form of all of those lies he said to gather himself back to himself yes that's the reason why over the heads of all of those Believers that were in the upper room the Bible says there was a clothing tongue of fire over their head so the great Pillar of Fire break himself into many pieces and everybody that was seeing the Savage had a representation of that over them praise the Lord and I believe that every one of us have a representation of that clothing fire over us tonight whether you like it or not that is the thing that compare you that is the thing that gave you the drive to move on to serve God that is the thing that gave you the desire to pray we have seen his time and have come to worship Him praise the Lord amen now this this uh this the the the the this that the wise man was saying we have seen his thought that that was the prophecy there was a prophecy of villain over enormous 24 verse 17. Balaam prophesied that a star will rise out of Jacob now so tonight what I want to do and uh and trust that the law will help me is that I want for us to First realize and and establish here that that's time that was to rise out of Jacob amen bilam said a star will rise out of Jacob praise the Lord and uh and and and and and the era said that uh uh uh the uh this this wise man you know that came all the way down from Babylon they saw this time praise the Lord but you will see here that uh as you as you said it through the message and few of them we will look at tonight brother Brandon make us to realize that that star out of Jacob was nothing less than the pillow of Fire it was nothing less than the pillar of Fire praise the Lord now you what what what makes it beautiful is that that was the first form of God the first form that the invisible God took what we call the logos was a body of light that was the first form of God and it's very interesting that uh that that God choose to lead us by his first manifestation are we together praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen amen Fellowship by Redemption brother Branham said he says now in the beginning when uh no let's let's leave that one let's get to the maniac of garada I will come back to that that would that would just take me out of out of tough yeah he says look at the stars that led the wise man it comes over every Observatory then everything is and no one's seen it but then it was just giving for them to see look at Paul when he had the vision was knocked off his hearse and and fell off his hearse of whatever when he was on the road of Damascus see is just giving for some to see and some cannot see it that's exactly right so when so so when we all get to Glory when when when the days are over I'm going to make this statement I believe it was all I believe it was all my heart I believe with all of my heart we read in the Bible that it was the pillar of fire that led the children of the the children of Israel from Egypt into the promised land is that right and that pillow of fire was the angel of the Covenant is that right teachers and who was the angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ amen and he is he is the same then yesterday today and forever is that right what does that mean he's still leading the church he is the Angel of the Covenant the Covenant was written with his own blood and he went into the presence of the father packing his own blood is that right he says and now this is the same Holy Spirit now watch now he says the pillow of fire is the Angel of the Covenant amen the angel of the Covenant is our Lord Jesus Christ amen and as he continually he says now this same Holy Spirit you have to you have to think about it in a way Jesus said I will go and the comforter we come so is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ that's what he wants us to understand now this same Holy Spirit and they said George J Lance said it looked like an uh uh an amarylight a burning wafer flipping flame like that I said well around and around like that look like it was going in a cycle of Wheeling around now so what is he talking about he's talking about the the pillow fight that was taken in Houston the 19 1950 pillow fight that came over brother Branham now so what what what is the connection that he's making here he's making us to realize that these are not just different beings this is the same manifestation praise the Lord so when God condescended and took the body of a light called the logos amen and by that Lord God he created all things right amen and then in in the book of collusion he will say he created All Things by Jesus Christ why that was uh uh uh uh uh a pre-figure of Jesus Christ are we together amen so you see that it was the same light it was the same light that created all things and that line came in the form of the pillar of fire to lead his people all through the the the the the the ages amen and they returned back to the church are we together Jesus says I am the light of the word are we together Saint John chapter one let's look there quickly that's the reason why Paul said in Romans no man have sought God no is that light that that is seeking us is that light that is drawing us praise the Lord just like in the natural if you should be passing in the place and you see the reflection of light comes through a hold the moment it grabs your eye the next thing in your mind was there light has a drawing power the light has a drawing power you see that's the reason why the revelation of this word will draw you to the image of Christ if the word is not revealed to you you will play Church in and out of church but the constant revelation of the word will bring you closer all the time because light has a drawing power the Bible says in the beginning was the word Saint John 1 and the Word was with God and the Word was God the scene was in the beginning with God all things were created by Him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the what in him was life and the life was what life was the light of man the life was the light of man that same light from the beginning that created all things praise the Lord that same logos in the time of the church ages I mean in a time of uh uh uh the joining of Israel it became the pillar of Fire it comes upright by night and in the day is covered by Cloud it becomes the pillow of clown it was just the same light it was not two different lights no in the day it's covered by clown it becomes the pillar of cloud in the night the cloud roll back it's bright it's visible the people can see it it was pleased to lead them you just think about it not lie standing right there and they can see it yeah praise the Lord do you know what it was when brother Branham was preaching the church age and that very same Pillar of Fire came down in the building and went to the back of the war of the building and started drawing the church ages on the wall can you imagine that brother Banner would tell the people to look back can you imagine the ceiling that was in the room praise the Lord that feeling ought to be with us every time when we pick up the word there must be a capturing feeling there must be a feeling that capture us praise the Lord oh the devil knows that very well amen so whenever you want to read your Bible on the phone and then that's that's when all the WhatsApp messaging and all the the option or everything stop busting just to play with your mind because he knows that there is a drawing power there is a drawing power and that's the thing that changes you from glory to glory that's the thing that affects our life he must life and that life that life was the light of man his life is our light his life is our light and that light shattered in darkness and darkness cannot comprehend it praise the Lord Darkness cannot comprehend it do you realize how dark this age is is right now hot dog the word is right now that's what I mean I'm talking about now with all the things that is happening around the world Russia rolling atomic bombs to to Belarus and all of things that is happening yeah praise the Lord and all the spirits that are streaming out of hell yeah it's 1956 you see the the lead is is left out of hell you see since demon Spirit are streaming into the world it's so easy for people to have a wrong Spirit and the right spirit it's so easy to pick up a wrong spirit it's everywhere it's everywhere yeah the Holy Ghost must come by at Birth the wrong Spirit don't need to come by the birth amen it can come by an app it can come by something you hear they can come by a music that is playing it's every word demon Spirit streaming out into the Earth the word has never experienced a Time word human life has no value the word has never experienced that it used to be word uh when when you know when when it says someone was hit by the vehicle everybody wants to avoid that place they don't want to see the blood everybody wants to avoid it let it just say something happen you see even the little babies running on the road they are standing over somebody that has just lost their life the world has never experienced that where man take their own life just over nothing just over nothing but why are they doing it it's not their choice they are overtaken by a spirit praise the Lord I try not to not a crowd this uh note up tonight so I won't know uh won't stay too long tonight he says he a formal and a lot of rain the very holy spirit that made the promise the very Christ that died the same Morning Star the same pillow of fire that led the children of Israel the same one that worked through Jesus that he returned back to God and smart Paul blind is a small paw blind ass still the great light that followed the children of Israel on his road to Damascus the same thing is year to night doing through human body just exactly what he done through human body that ate flesh and meat at the day of Sodom and he said so shall it be in a coming of the son of man that is the holy spirit he's here receive him he's yours you are morning Stars don't be drunk out by the things of the word don't be just dispelled by little things that's taking place right above that and receive Christ tonight and be healed every one of you amen and it's all through the message you can study it I mean that uh that that caught my attention some years ago how brother Brandon tied the pillar of fire to the to the star that led the wise man it's the same light praise the Lord is the same light and that light is is in our midst that's what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is the light is the life of God the light every man is the life of God that comes down Enlighten us lighting our body Amen to make us to rise above the desires of the flesh make us to rise above the the trials of the time praise the Lord and I would just I was just read in India to uh getting ready and the thoughts struck my mind the wise thing to do just like the wise man wise man with all with all the the the knowledge and and the wisdom and all the things that is steady yet they follow a star they follow a star a light in the heavens identify over two years over two years and that light LED them right to word the Christ child was born that light LED them right to work God became flesh and I'm telling you if you follow this light if you follow this light that has shine in our day it will lead you to the world being flesh because that's God's desire is not to lead you to a church is to lead you to a place where the word will become flesh and this time is not in another body but in your body praise the Lord wise men follow the wise men of our age did not like to follow they'll know too much but wise men streptural wise man they follow the wise things to do in this Dark Age is to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit the wise thing to do in an age where we just can't put everything right you should follow the start and go and worship sometimes we want to get everything right before we can worship no God is comparing us sometimes he's trapping us into situation sure praise the Lord just like he had Paul and Silas embracing bows and chains he trapped them he imprisoned them praise the Lord for them to bring worship that will break the praise in open it's not our choice it's the father's choice he seeketh such to worship he has sought us he watched our Jain over our Jane for four generations praise the Lord and if he have choose us and if he have caught us there's no way we can get out of here people let's realize we don't have no choice the easy way out is our surrender all that's the easy way out I surrounded all because for a time like this you were born yeah for a time like this that's what Mordecai told Esther for a time like this praise the Lord amen now as we look at this together let's go back to that according Fellowship by Redemption let me take that and then I just close on the thought here now in the beginning when God made the man to worship Him he live God taking care of him fed him made him a perfect fellowship with God man had a perfect Fellowship of God sorry now when I read this there was there was a top that struck my mind and that's what I've I've included in my notes and the thought that struck my mind let's go back to the beginning Broadband says in the beginning when God made the man to worship Him and live God taken care of him praise the Lord that was the thought that struck my mind if many of us can be grateful to the Lord tonight you'll realize that the Lord has been so good to us amen more than sometimes we realize or we get a little uh uh flu bark here and a little headache year and a little tiredness because sometimes we don't rest enough but he keeps us from sicknesses he keep us from sicknesses we might not had a a huge stock in the in the you know in in in the financial Market but he's been able to meet our needs barbam says when God made man to worship him God took care of him God took care of him when he popped those people in the wilderness for 40 years they didn't know her choice they had to follow the leadership God took care of them even though they were not at their best they were arguing they were fussing but God it was his responsibility amen he took them from their jobs he took them from their businesses they were doing in Egypt and he took care of them and I believe that the Lord is taking care of us he's taking care of us it's just that sometimes our wants are more than our needs but the Lord is taking care of us if we will just be grateful laudisha has filled our eyes and fill our mind and and and and and and and and every morning sales comes through the mail the mail is filled with things that are on discount praise the Lord amen a new uh start of shoes you only have two feet how many shoes you wear praise the Lord no I'm not I'm not I'm not blasting anybody okay I'm not blasting anybody I'm I'm just trying to capture us into something here that the Lord has been good to us the Lord is taking care of us he's taking care of us he has called us to worship Him he has called us to represent him in this age praise the Lord if you realize that God is obligated praise the Lord it is only when we try to drag his Blessing in the mark of sin and we try to drag his blessing to our own personality and both in frame that God steps back but if we would try our best to be a Son of God or the daughter of God God will take care of you praise the Lord amen God taking care of him fed him man had a perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve what a perfect picture no harm nothing could harm them no sickness whoever come to them praise the Lord even if the doctor have said something about your blood pressure you know that you feel better than than that blood pressure you feel much better than that blood pressure even if the doctor might say something you know this thing is wrong with you that his diagnosis but sometimes why make you surprise why make you when the doctor said you are surprised because you are not depressed you are now under the banish of sickness you feel better you even suffering really really I get blood pressure really sure God he's a good God he take care of his children if you Worship the Lord he will take care of you they didn't they didn't even know what sickness is was they didn't even know what o h was they didn't even know what being hurt they couldn't be hurt praise the Lord amen we are in a falling body there are things that hurt us things people say things people do hurt us but that's why the Holy Ghost is for it rises us above the heart it comes down and bring you above that hurt because brother Branham says God wants his children to be happy he did not say God want his children to have everything no God wants his children to be happy and we can be happy are being contained we can be happy by knowing that God is with us the shout of the king is in my camp praise the Lord the shout of the king is in amen do you know how many people that are enslaved by a hurt from childhood and they are even ready to carry down her down to the Grave they have gone to counseling and counseling and they can just not get away they are enslaved to that heart he says they were in the presence of the omnipotent power of God which led them which held them in control praise the Lord amen which held them in control and guide them by his spirit there was nothing amen nothing praise the Lord oh how it's easy for us to just go into them into the world of imagination and think about them but what the prophet is trying to make us to realize that same God is here for us today amen that same God is here with us today praise the Lord even as a little group of people in this place to realize that you know that that I mean this is the place that the Lord has provided for us for church and and we come here for service Wednesday night and Sunday and maybe the closest person that live yet is about 20 minutes away from church but the Lord has been good to us praise the Lord he has been good to us amen I came by one day after after work and uh I just drive by like I always do came in what whatever it was uh you know the the door was not lined properly the lock was on the outside and uh and I just said Lord you you're being so good to us he watched over us while we are in church praise the Lord the very day that that young man that young man was shot by that police woman we were right here in church that very day there was a youth meeting right here when when the riot was going on and we did not know about it until everybody got home praise the Lord are we together let me just sweep over a little bit here uh it's 11 minutes after nine I think if I leave you right here I can have something else to preach on but then if I go a little bit I might give you something to think about praise the Lord if I stop right here I may have something to preach on but if I go a little bit I might I might give you something to think about praise the Lord amen the Lord has been good to us you believe that amen so that's that's that's what I want I want to bring to us tonight I wanted to go into a thought you know brother Branham said it is it's something that is common we have heard it over and over the Gentile Age begin with an image worship brother Brandon said it where I Usher out with the same okay I won't go the code is right here before me but what I wanted to to to make you to realize is that uh the prophet talked about how the age the Gentile dispensation on a dying year when when God gave Daniel that that Vision uh interpreting Nebuchadnezzar dream and it was all about the gentai kingdom and and he says the Gentile age was going to be issued in by an image worship amen he says it will go out the same we realize it's around us amen is around us most especially we're uh uh there's a big deity thing going on about uh you know when but thank God we are above that amen I'm not going to blow trumpet on that tonight I want to get us to the place where we can bring worship to God praise the Lord now so but what I want to I want you to realize is that in the time of Daniel in the time of Daniel they were there were there were two things that came on the scene and all of these things was around worship now you have to realize that Daniel as a prophet is a beautiful in a way the Holy Spirit do things just for us to be able to teach us lesson down here hard his trial of the Lion's Den amen I mentioned that on the on uh uh on Sunday how God allowed those Hebrew boys and Hebrew people to go into into Babylon because he wanted to lift his name he wanted to be magnified amen he wanted for the whole of Babylon because Babylon was ruling the word at that time he wanted for the whole of Babylon the Bible says every knee will burn in every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord the Bible says every it means every praise the Lord some may not do it in their lifetime they would do it in the region of the Lost because when they get down there in the region of the laws and realize So Daniel was was was tempted that nobody should worship and the Bible says he will open he opened his curtains he had disciplined himself to lifting up his hands to the Lord three times a day and he was that going to be intimidated by the King's Command praise the Lord now what I want you to wash here is that if we take it in the context of the prophet and the elect now the prophet had to make a stand he had to stand against the religious authority of that day Daniel took a stand and it was done here alone Daniel was not praying alone but when it came to that time it was Daniel alone that went down into the lion's den praise the Lord and when the law will deliver him the king now will also now make an image yeah in the name of a holy man all he did was he just changed the name of the god but if God was still an idol yeah praise the Lord maybe if he changed the name of the God and he can put a message terminology to it he would get the message people to worship it yeah praise the Lord are we together but what also I want you to realize is that when it came to worshiping the image Daniel was not dead Daniel was alive yeah he was not dead he was alive but this time the Bible only speaks of shadra Misha and Abednego did that means that Daniel bow down to the image no but you see the principle the way the Bible will structure things is to re is to make us to realize there is a time where the messenger the leader he will go through his time of trial and tests and if he can stand and create a way that goes over to the elect sure yeah are we together praise the Lord oh I don't believe that that Daniel worshiped that image no even though the image was named back to shelter that was that was the name that the king gave to Daniel and that was what he he named the image and asked everybody should worship it and do you realize that some Jews that were born in the Trap of Levi worship that image Young Jews that were born in in in in in in in in the levitical household but there were few Elitch praise the Lord there were few Elitch do you know how tempting it is to thank chedra is not here with us Daniel is not here praise the Lord I mean yeah we can I mean whatever he's doing that is they are not persecuting we can do the same praise the Lord but the Bible says they were determined to give worship to only one God and God will use that God used what done your debt and it influenced the king to know that there is only one God but it still did not change the hearts of the people praise the Lord chadra Mission and Abednego was put through their trial God will use that so you see it it is now only what the messenger did that God used to vindicate himself in this age God is also using what you and myself would do they stand that we will take at work they said we would take in our neighborhood the same we would take in our dress code praise the Lord sometimes we want to disguise ourselves I mean so we can treat ourselves anyway so people can know that we are Christian God is using the elite of this age to vindicate his word amen so sure there is still a living God that can keep young people from sin they can keep them from this present word they receive a living God that can keep our homes and keep our marriages there is still a living God praise the Lord we might not be able to carry everybody to Sabine okay but you can bring them to your home and let them see the decency that is in the home let us see the harmony that is in the home I said we're going to give you something to think about tonight the Lord bless you the musicians can come the prophet his time and he said in a message of uh the attraction on the mountain he says the prophecy has changed he said the attraction has changed from the prophet to his prophecy and his prophecy this is the people that he have called he have come to call to truth worship we can
