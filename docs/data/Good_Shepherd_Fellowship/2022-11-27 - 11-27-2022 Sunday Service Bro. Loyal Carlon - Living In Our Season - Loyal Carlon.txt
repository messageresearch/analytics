eyes out back there it was just so beautiful to see just that that fresh anointing coming out I appreciate it so much it reminds me just of the the years of worship and praise that we've seen and I just see that that rekindling of a new spirit and I just I love that I love to see that so don't let anyone despise your youth I was 18 when I started here and I'm just I love it I just uh praise the Lord may God give us a double portion and it just keep on going and going and going I know whenever whenever I started leading songs way back and for me my burden was that there would be a place where people could be free to worship and praise whatever was in their heart they could just let it out and I'm just I'm every time I come back here I just feel invigorated with that that's that sense and a lot of places don't have that you feel like you gotta kind of just like hold it in and just praise God from your heart and that's fine but I love to just let it out and praise him we're gonna sing that song that we did last time we were here the choir song Jesus brought me out once I was lost some of you remember the parts if you remember it that's fine we're gonna try it again I don't know if

[Music] the rest of my life go God's way the rest of my life amen praise the Lord maybe we'll sing a few more at the end I I just I would love to take all the song honestly I wish that I wasn't preaching I wish we were just singing today kind of but uh I just appreciated uh Josh's inspiration and it just kind of had to sing a couple myself so praise the Lord amen uh you may be seated for just a moment as we uh changed it or the service here whew you know I was feeling really cold and now I feel really warm to praise the Lord I needed that um bring greetings from brother Aaron McGarry my pastor down in Arizona different ones down there some of us still want Jordan back but he's made it very clear he's not going anywhere he's not coming back to Arizona that's my real reason for coming it's the frost flight Jordan back back no I'm just kidding I will say it is yeah I know it's not gonna happen it is a lot warmer down there so it is weird how you start to get acclimated after a while here I am like in a like a sweater vest and all this stuff yeah no yeah it's it's funny um I mean here we are it's in right now I think it gets down to 45 at night in in Phoenix and you know we're all just bundled up it's really funny how your your mind it's a lot of your mind at that same time like you just you don't feel the cold very often all of a sudden you get here wow it's cold outside so Jordan of course yesterday had to show me up by wearing flip-flops as we uh or sandals as we went out walking around so while I'm wearing like wool socks and stuff like that so praise the Lord well praise the Lord amen um it's good to be back with you all as always um and uh it just feels right at home I just have a very simple thought today we're gonna jump right into it um and just kind of it's World family at the end of the day and that's the that's the thing I do wear glasses now it's weird because you guys are all like slightly blurry I'm waiting for my next prescription to come in and so I'm just gonna wear this and now I really can't see you I can see this though so praise the Lord let's go ahead and stand we'll just jump right in let's go ahead and go to Genesis 12. oh actually before we do that I've actually got two bird burdens here that we need to go ahead and get to um from they gave me back there please pray for my neighbor Joanne this is from Mom it's a very difficult time for her her husband passed away last Sunday thank you and that's our friend oral was very much like an adopted grandparent to many of us and we just wanna it was his desire to go but we're sad for us at the end of the day and then we also uh want to remember uh sister Berea will be flying home tonight from [Music] I can't read this okay from Texas pray for traveling mercies she wanted to greet everyone today God bless you Saints sister Kelly just go to the Lord in prayer dear father I just want to remember these prayer burdens Lord God into your hands for traveling mercies Lord Godfather I'm sure there's many more traveling because of the holiday and everything Lord God father we're just grateful to you Lord that we have the ability to travel Lord God and that you're watching over us Lord we know your word says that you watch over our coming in and are going out father we're just trusting you for those traveling mercies Lord I also want to remember Joanne Lord God always been just a very faithful neighbor to us as a family Lord God and I know that it's it's going to be unusual without oral around Lord God father I just pray Lord that you would bring her comfort in this time lord god father um May it even be just an opportunity for she and Mom to spend more time together Lord God into uh just have that communion and fellowship Lord God fathers I know it's a very difficult process to go through Lord God is well we've gone through it Lord God father and we understand father we just look to you now Lord God we just pray over the reading of your word Lord be with us father get us out of the way Lord God and we're just looking to you with all of our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis 12. of course is a very familiar scripture I didn't send my quotes back there Jordan I apologize I just didn't get time very familiar scripture to us all now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of the great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of Heron uh you may be seated we're going to keep reading down a little bit here and Abram took sarai's wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in uh Heron and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came and we'll just kind of skip down a little bit and Abram verse 9 and Abram's Journey going on still toward the South and there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was Grievous in the land and then let's just read from uh in a class Ecclesiastes 3 just a couple of verses here as well it's everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to sell a time to keep silence and time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer one more time dear father Lord we love you just may uh your intention come forth in the word this morning Lord we love you Lord we appreciate you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so here we see a Abram which again very familiar passage to all of us but I I saw something recently in this that I just never quite saw before and that is that if you look at it here is if you just go you know the Lord said unto Abraham get the out of that country and from thy Kindred from my father's house unto a land that I'll show you and he leaves he does he follows the word of God he does he he does and of course we know there's some different things that he needed to process he brought lot with him he brought his data with him these different things and we know that um you know he he had a partial revelation of what God wanted him to do at the end of the day but he did hear the word of the actual word of the Lord and he did act on what the word of the Lord told him to do and then he immediately goes into a famine immediately I mean it's it's right there in the next passage God has given a promise all these different things and then he goes into you can see here again in uh in verse 9 at Abram Journey going on still toward the South and there was a famine in the land that Amber went down into Egypt and we often talk about the the part where he goes into Egypt but we don't talk so much about the famine about what was driving him uh to go down into Egypt and I'm just going to really quick if you don't mind actually Stephen can you help me for a second I just don't have time to do both at the same time can you make sure my screen doesn't shut off in here just keeps the power saving mode is on or something thank you there's a famine in the land and I just want to talk a little bit today on living in our season we're in a time right now outside it's it's winter time it's very cold outside um everyone's going down south praise the Lord if you want to come with me after this I have business cards no I'm just kidding um I have tracks to hand out for the you know Revival of warm weather that's happening in the south but it's a thing people go down to Egypt down to Phoenix from Minnesota in the winter time because it's it's a time where you know we're not harvesting here and very often you can find the natural typing the spiritual even in even in the very Physical Realm we talk about seasonal affective disorder is a thing people because there isn't enough sunlight out people aren't getting enough vitamin D people get more depressed people tend to gain weight up here like it's a thing we tend to find these Seasons at the at the macro level which is like the global level and then down into the micro level in our lives there's seasons and there are times did you get it sorted out thank you thank you appreciate that so Abraham follows the voice of the Lord and immediately goes into a famine and then he goes down into Egypt runs right into a problem we would think that if he's following the word of the Lord shouldn't good things happen right away shouldn't he immediately walk into some kind of like you know there should be some kind of sign there should be some something really good should happen and I think oftentimes this is the case in our Christian walks we make a turn towards the Lord and something bad happens we meet the Scarecrow on away on the way in a sense we meet the barrier that's trying to keep us from walking in the will of the Lord and of course we know the end of the story we can look over to Romans where we talk about how how at the end of the day that Abraham's Faith faltered not we know that and again we we read those scriptures and we know that that's true from God's point of view Abraham's faith in the end was concrete he didn't waver but I want us to peel back that kind of ecclesiastical like Viewpoint and put ourselves in Abraham's shoes today because just like us Abraham was a man he was a person he actually existed he actually went through you know waking up in the morning with a crick in his neck and he was tired and he I don't know if they had coffee back then but he might have been you know like you never know they had their rituals they had the routines they had the things that they did in order to feel happy in order to feel safe in order to make sure that they had quote unquote money in the bank and their bills were paid they had those those same desires because nothing is new Under the Sun everything that has been is the same today we might have more technology but at the end of the day we're all looking for a roof over our head food in our stomach companionship fellowship with our uh friends family loved ones Etc we're all looking for the same things the desires of man the trinkets may have changed the decorations may have changed but the desires are just the same and so Abraham goes into a famine and just kind of going back into Ecclesiastes here to everything there is a season in a time and purpose under heaven and we'll just kind of go down to uh yeah time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted he leaves and if you look at it he goes into a famine it's not a time to harvest it's not a time maybe not even a time to plant it's a time to Bear through it it's a time to persevere we look at winter time as it's very cold outside it is the time that we've been preparing for winter time the seasons they come every year on a regular cycle spring summer fall winter and we're so distant from that now in our you know quote unquote Modern Age that we tend to just like what see winter a lot of the times as a nuisance unless we really like the snow not me but we tend to see winter it's a lot colder outside and not a lot is happening most people are not like other than the holidays once the holidays are over then you know it's kind of the bearing through its season there aren't things growing outside it's not a season of growth it's a season where you're eating up your stores and if you didn't prepare for the winter you're gonna run out or you may run out and again we don't think about this with with Abraham leaving did he know he was going to go in right into a famine I would wager and again maybe I'm projecting but I want us to put ourselves in his shoes he just heard from God and like us I don't know about you but when I hear from God I'm just like wow this is amazing everything is about to be amazing I don't know why I still tend to think that because it's not the way it works it's it's like wow this is so exciting it's really more like you're about to suffer you are about to suffer big time mister and uh get ready for it and it is it is the Harvest that eventually is going to come that is the blessing but the season that we often go right into is the season of suffering so you want to read uh Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk sorry yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and it's very this this passage is extremely interesting and and we look at this and I I there are many different ways to read this but I want to think of this again in this idea of seasons of there's a time to be walked to be led ingrained pastures there's a time to be led besides Still Waters there's a time where he restores our souls there's a Time where he leads us in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake there's a time when he leads us through the valley of the shadow of death and each of these times and these seasons are for a purpose and for a reason you even look at Abraham as he goes down to Egypt we see that first instance and of course we we major on the lying we see the first instance of him lying but I would wager before that we see the first instance of his fear we see his feet why did he lie because he was afraid he was afraid he still had faith in his soul in a sense of the promise of God because Sarah has to be around obviously in order for the promise to come forward everything else has to come forward and of course we know there's there's a progressive revelation of God sorry I'm cutting out up here a little bit uh the progression of God's uh revealing himself to him but we see this fear and of course we can see as it goes throughout his life he has a fear and in order for God to deal with that fear it has to first come out brother Branham talks about that the first that overcoming the enemy is recognizing him in every one of his tricks and there's I love the passage um the Bible talks about to know the truth and the truth will set you free you ever have a time where you've been dealing with the situation over and over and over whether it's with someone else or in your own life and you just can't figure out what's going on you don't know what's happening and sometimes this can go on for years but there's a moment of of revelation of Eureka where you suddenly realize this is what's happening this is the thing this this is the um we'll use a very easy oh well not an easy example but one we've all experienced lying if someone has lied to you you don't know there's a confu there's a element of confusion that has been entered into this relationship and it's distorted reality you now don't know what reality actually is because of a lie a lie creates a whole new world who talk about brother Branham talks about if we had enough faith we could speak a whole new world and go live in it and that's completely true in a very physical sense but we do that every single day of Our Lives everyone does not just Believers by the words we say and the things we believe we are literally creating our reality we are creating how we perceive the world even science is tapping into this at this point what we say and what we think and what we pay attention to you I think I've talked about this last time but it's called the reticular activating system you can go look it up it's the thing that we continually pay attention to eventually our brain prioritizes it and we no longer see anything else if you drove here today in a white car let's say if you have a Tesla right now Teslas pretty cool whatever some people love them some people hate them but the moment you start thinking man I want a Tesla I think I'm going to get a Tesla you go drive one around you're going to see Teslas everywhere you're going to see them everywhere and what was a novelty you're like wow I think I'll get a Tesla Tesla's are really awesome I'll be the only one at church that has one or whatever you know your you're going to notice they're everywhere and suddenly you'll you won't feel as special at all because they're everywhere because your brain prioritizes it to you similar to your own name if someone says Steve even if they're not talking to you brother Steve your brain automatically perks up like hey I know for me like all the time it happens like obviously my name is a word so if someone's talking in a like I'm in the restaurant I hear the word loyal I'm like who's trying to get my attention it's just weird it's a weird thing your brain can kick it out from a whole crowd of people can pick out your name because your brain calls that to your attention it's a part of your reality it's high priority to you and so um obviously like we're saying if if someone has lied to you it is the knowledge that you have been lied to that starts the process of setting you free you are able to start understanding if I was told this over and over and over again and it wasn't true and I've been living my life in accordance with this reality I first must understand that this isn't true in order to actually continue towards the truth the truth will set you free so I noticed what's really interesting here we're not going to kind of take a little bit of a detour but it's for a reason is we're going to talk a little bit about storytelling and about drama and there's a reason for it and I've got quotes to back it up brother Branham did very similar things so I think I have license to do this in film in books there's a there are principles that make a good story did you know that there are actually a finite number of stories at the end of the day in principle and in concept there are only so many variations of similar stories because at the end of the day Satan can't create and God can't lie and so everything that exists has to relate back to the truth in some way even a lie is just the truth misrepresented and for that reason there are principles and parallels and types that will always Shadow back to reality and it's this idea and again you can see it in the Bible in a lot of Dramas and stories have been written which you can tell have either been copied off the Bible intentionally or they caught onto the pattern of God they caught under the pattern which is it's often called the hero's journey the hero's journey the Ascension of and we use this actually in marketing all the time but the you have a person who has a problem that they can't solve themselves who meets a guide who has a plan that calls them to action so they end in success and avoid failure that is the basic story template now there's some derivatives of that there's a lot of different directions and there's there are inversions of that a person who has a problem who meets a false guide who has a plan that helps them end in failure and avoid success again there are inversions and they're different things but this is the the universal story in a sense and you can you go read any book this will ruin every movie you ever watch from now on there they will always you'll have a character it's the antagonist or the protagonist you'll have obviously a villain which is the problem you have a problem a situation something that they need to solve that they cannot solve themselves and I'm not going to go into like a list of movies and books that you know because that's going to get weird really fast but go think about it you can see this in the Bible even Christ as the hero comes to the Earth and is filled with the Holy Spirit the guide we look at when he gets baptized Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered and so this is this is a continual theme and you can see it again in the story of Abraham Abraham is a person he's a guy 75 years old still living with his dad I think he's got some problems probably still living with his dad you know just you know living off that you know Daddy's income and business that he's running and he's like you know what I think life is good I'm just fine down here things are going great and he needed to suffer a little bit if you think about it he'd been living 75 years and he hadn't he hadn't taken on it in his own identity in a sense he's living under the identity of his father he hasn't gone out and and really learned anything on his own again as far as we know maybe there's something in that 75 years but we can only stick to what's what's written in the book so you have a hero's journey and it's typically broken into three Acts X act 1 act 2 and act three if you've ever seen a play if you've ever seen a movie again this is going to ruin it for you because it's always act one act two and act three if you've got a two hour you movie usually the first 45 minutes to an hour is act one act two the next half an hour the last half an hour is act three and in each of these stages of the story there are very specific purposes that need to take place act one is for character development you you learn who the character is you learn what their problem is typically there's a lot of like missteps there's a lot of learning there's a lot of different things and again we're I'm kind of like avoiding specific movies or stories or books or whatever but you get these very uh you get these caricatures of of the person you get the characteristics and a great story you'll learn who the person is what their problem is within the first five minutes of the story you learn very quickly and you can identify with them a great author is going to write it so that you're not really reading about that person you're reading about yourself you're able to step into that character because again it's dealing with the Human Condition we all are a hero on a journey in a sense we are all a person that has a problem we all have a problem we all got problems and thankfully hopefully all of us by today that are in this church we've already achieved the biggest problem has been solved we're saved the biggest problem has been solved now we're dealing with all of the smaller problems the things that we're dealing in our day-to-day lives and we need that guidance act two typically right around the end of act one is where they'll meet the guide end of act one or middle of act one is where they'll meet the guide and then they'll start working the process to start working the plan they'll fail a bunch of times and then typically around the going into act two they think they've got it all figured out because they've been listening to the plan of the guide right sometimes this is where they kill off the guide this is very common they'll kill off the guide so now the hero has to go on on it on their own they have to go out on their own you even look at with Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane the Holy Spirit left him and he had to go on it on his own had to go on it on his own trusting in who he was as as a man without the Holy Spirit think about that he had to believe the word of God about him the same exact way that each one of us has to believe the word of God about us he goes and this isn't this is how act two Works act two is where you go to hell it's where villainy and evil seems to Triumph every story it's always the same you you all what you feel as if All Is Lost and again you can see the exact same thing in the Bible Jesus the guide has left him he goes to hell he dies this should be a tragedy the book that we that that the Bible I say the book because again I'm alliterating it to a story the book that we're reading should end as a tragedy that should be the end done like that should be the last page in the book and then we're done Tech like that's the way it should be if it's if it's written by by man about a man that's all that should be there but then we have Resurrection we have the restoration we've got the third Act the third Act of the story is where suddenly out of everything going wrong everything goes right everything goes right and We Know It's always darkest before the dawn It's always darkest before the dawn and we look at even with winter and spring it not going to say it's always coldest before the spring but it kind of feels like it your January February March with those cold winds blowing through I know the last winter that I was here was negative 30 for like a week and I got frostbite in my my right knuckle which was really annoying and uh it's cold it seems you think about it if we didn't have the return of the sun eventually everyone in Minnesota would die just saying I'm just kidding eventually it would get cold enough it would get cold enough if the sun just continued if or if the Earth kept tilting away from the sun eventually it would be negative 50 and then negative 100 and then you know eventually it would get cold enough it's the ER it's the season of death is winter three Acts of a story Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters things are going awesome this is great let's just stop there let's all go God's Gonna Lead You In Green Pastures beside the Still Waters I think we can leave now but it doesn't end there he restores my soul that's amazing yes he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death and then it goes into this passage I mean it goes from everything that's amazing into yea the Y walk through the valley of the shadow of death but I'll fear no evil for I know you're with me and that's ultimately the promise that Christ gave us was that we are going to go through hell but he's with us and that's the the place that we can we can hold to steadfastly and then we can even see this that prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies it's overcoming the darkness it's overcoming the hell thou anoint is my head with oil my cup runeth over this is right in the middle of the trial of the darkness of the suffering any the the Ascension the act 3 of this passage is surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it is it what's amazing about this it's that last verse is future tense all the rest of it is present tense the last verse is future tense it is the Hope and the belief of the Redemption of resurrection of the reward of the end of the darkness that is what that verse is talking about and it's all it's referencing as well that again you're with me at the end of the day that's what's important is that you're with me 1964 Shalom sorry I didn't send the quotes over so um now to you adults the scripture is God's Symphony yes Hallelujah only the composer knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is but you'd have to know about the symphony first see it's not just something you see it's the changing the junction of the word of the music it throws sometimes it's going this way for a while a certain beat after a while it changes all around what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it not interested in it it's just a racket it's a fuss but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming Hallelujah I think about this Ariel you'll probably appreciate this and the other musicians here will appreciate when I hear him talking about that to me I hear it's like he's waiting for the beat to drop in a sense it's like you can't hear that that's effectively what he's talking about there's a there's a point in music again typically you'll get it like halfway through the song or right before the course or something like that where you're you're pacing out the Rhythm and if it's like let's say a moderate Pace song but you want to take it up a little bit like I'll fly away or something you go from you know and then it'll like have a reprieve of like like and then it just goes really exciting it's waiting for the beat to drop and this is exactly what brother Brandon was talking about but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming and they don't even have to know the song as a musician you know the beat's about to drop if you've it like you know because the pattern is there you know it doesn't matter if you've heard the song before you know that based on all of your knowledge of all the other music that you've ever heard in your entire life that hey this is about the part where they're probably going to slow the song down and then the beat's gonna drop and it's gonna get really awesome and that's the moment when everyone jumps up and screams or whatever like again not trying to be clinical about it but that is how songs are written that's typically it's again back to this idea of the three acts even songs are written in this idea of the the pr the preposition the initial idea this this journey that you're suddenly coming on like wow this has got kind of a cool song oh man things are getting really bad and dark and intense so I'm like and then all of a sudden you have the glory and the resurrection uh again from Shalom uh at 199. now they had a sheet in their hand but what would they do they were trying to look back to a beat that had all a portion had already been played out they don't know the change of music and so for us we can go back to Abraham and parallel ourselves with Abraham Abraham may have thought again just putting myself in his shoes maybe I wasn't supposed to go this direction you know God did just tell me I'm just supposed to leave my my land and go into a land I'll show you I'm just going to leave go in this direction but now we're going down to Egypt and we're kind of running all over the place he didn't know what season he was in not in the sense of famine but what season he was in in the walk that he was in he didn't know the the pattern of God he was learning and progressing in the pattern and the walk with God and the same thing goes again we can take a lot of these quotes and look at it from a global sense of like the churches don't know the season we they don't know the time or the hour or the age but I like to take it down to local the body or to the individual the season that we are in as individuals not both in our lives as a whole you look at it your early 20s into maybe like mid-20s you're in a springtime of your life everything is about like globally you're any time where everything is just kind of growing and flourishing and seeds are getting planted who you will become is planted before you're 25. there's even studies that indicate that basically about until you're seven most of the stuff that you will become has already been planted in you the ideas and thoughts are already they're actually the documentary about this where they have followed people for the last 50 60 years every seven years and they have followed their lives it's very interesting and of course brother Branham talks about this as well he talks about when we're a child it's that planting season and those seeds are going to come forth and then in our lives you go into you know your 32 say whatever you know I guess time frame 30 40 50 whatever you go into a summertime and then hopefully by mid 50s 60s you're going to a Harvest Time where you're really harvesting and then of course we know you go into a winter from there it's the natural order of our lives but within that we have sub-seasons we'll call it times like generally our life is going in that direction but we're going to go through times and Seasons at a micro scale spring times where God is going to bring us through Seasons where it's time to grow it's time to plant and there are seasons where it's time to harvest and there are seasons when it's time to persevere to just push through and it's important that we know the change of the music in our lives to listen for the Rhythm and beat in the tune of Our Lives we can look at it in our lives sometimes um my pastor brother Aaron he talked about he preached a long series on barriers and boundaries and how it's important to know the difference between barriers and boundaries a boundary is what God places and a barrier is what Satan places a barrier is something that we have to press through barrier is something that's trying to keep us back from the promises of God and how do we know that it's a barrier because we can see the promise of God for us we can see the pattern of God we can see the music in a sense a boundary is where we're walking outside of the will and word of God and God will make will will make it evident to us in our lives eventually if we are our seed or a son of God we are going to run into boundaries where God says this is far enough and you're not going any further and you can push against it and you can fight against it and you can fight through it but God is going to make it as difficult for you as possible and ultimately the the distinction point point between the two of it is running it through the word of God completely the the Bible is an amazing book purely and again purely from a physical sense did you know that it is the first networked book it's an internet of its own accord there's some there there are tens and tens and tens of thousands of cross references into itself like a link like a hyperlink a website has all of these links that references back to other articles within the same website over and over and over and the Bible Acts just the same way you have tens and tens and tens and tens and tens of thousands I've seen some numbers all the way up over a hundred thousand but I don't remember the number right off the top of my head it is a self-contained book that continuously re-references itself over thousands of years which is amazing that's amazing in the uh data world this would be considered a single source of Truth a document that you reference all other documents by in order to validate their truth case in point in America we have the Constitution the Constitution is considered a single source of Truth now they're obviously updating and they add changes to it but everything else any judgments that are made in the country have to pass by the Constitution that has to be taken into consideration it is a single source of Truth and they don't get to just pick one part of it as to run through the whole entire thing there can't be you know a clause somewhere else that invalidates everything else it is continuous and so that brother random even talks about this that you have to be able to follow the thread Through the Bible because it continuously self-references over and over and over again and where we wind up with false doctrines at the end of the day is that people do not carry it through the Bible they don't carry it fully Through the Bible they go out on a limb and so what ends up happening is you have you can think of it like a line that should go back into itself it just goes out into outer darkness in a sense it's not referencing back to the source it just goes out carrying on in Shalom many people asked why they ask sometimes they ask me why why must these things happen why did this happen to me why did I start why did I start and this happened and I had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here and then of course brother Brandon says sometimes I've asked why why when I was just a young Minister first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his and kept trusting he knows every Junction he knows the Rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use the back side of the desert sometimes where God molds righteous men into sages and Prophets see that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the word when they got all kinds of creed and stuff in them let them come to the word and God beats it right out of them molds it right into this into the great Symphony with his word and I want to throw this in here because I think this is important when they get all kinds of Creeds and stuff we tend to make it's very easy to look at that and say oh that's for somebody else that's for someone somewhere else but a Creed is an ideal that's what it is a Creed is an ideal by which we live our lives you could think of um there's a saying what you've all heard which is not correct which is God helps those that help themselves it's not correct that's a Creed that's a Creed in a sense or a Creed could be if something needs doing I'm the one to do it that's a Creed not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing but it becomes a bad thing when it's our absolute and we have to be careful I think that today a lot of the times Satan has moved from the explicit Creed something that's very visible to the implicit Creed something that's internal you can't even see it you might not even know that you have it you can have the Creed of this is the way my culture does things this is the way my church does it this is the way my people and those things are fine and good until they get in the way of the music until they get in the way of the sheet music that God has you on you think of it again like a symphony like an orchestra there are many pieces of sheet music that have been handed out you've got the different you've got the different violins and you've got the cellos and you've got the the horns and you've got the vocals all of these different parts and pieces and each one of them has their own sheet music they're part of the same Symphony they're part of the same Orchestra they're playing the same song but they've got different parts even within the strings they might be in the same subgroup within that Symphony but they've got a different part to play they've got different notes to play and if they're only cheating off of their neighbor's sheet they're going to miss the notes they have to look at their own sheet and see what God wants them to do God wants them to do and we need to be able to do that not to be bound to a Dogma or weak or Creed that we live our lives by there here's a Creed this is actually going to be interesting I'm curious to see how this goes here's a Creed Minnesota nice Minnesota nice like as soon as I get back here it's actually really funny um we were at the this Christmas fair thing that was downtown and I just looked around I was like oh my goodness where are all the Latinos like I literally like that's exactly what my brain is like I'm living Phoenix now in Phoenix the Creed is this the West has not been won there's an attitude of get up before the Sun is up and get going and get on your horse and get going because you gotta fight like that's what it is the attitude is still there and the people you can feel it why because all of the people that successfully that successfully settled that area eventually had kids and eventually it became the culture of the place even brother Branham again talks about this everyone is ready to stick everyone else there there's this fighting like I'm ready to punch you and stab you and like that's just the not that they're act well some places they're actually doing it but that's the attitude it's this this high intensity atmosphere um whereas here in Minnesota it's like oh you can even feel it it's so funny going down to the fair it's just this feeling of like almost like pretentious it's kind of weird it's this this feel like now not living here and coming back it's kind of this pretentious folksy kind of like we're just better than everyone else like it's kind of weird it's this weird kind of like like we're so good everyone else is like I can't believe how how bad everywhere else is like there is this attitude you can feel it in the air it's actually really strange um now not have and I honestly I'm sure everywhere else I go I'm still Minnesotan and I come across the same way like look at how awesome I am I'm so great like not that I mean that but there's an attitude like I've actually had people talk to me about this like like or you know people are bothered by like my just like like my lack of like uh my ability to walk into situations with a smile on my face and I was like I'm here things are going to be great which is again this attitude there's a there's a until you leave you really can't see it but when you come back you can see it same thing and we go to Tennessee Tennessee wonderful place lived there Creed is uh the South will rise again there's this attitude of of and again not everywhere not everywhere but there is a general attitude of if you can't get your hands dirty down in the dirt and in the like there's an anti-education ideal in the sense of if that makes me not be able to put my hands in the dirt then I'm not I don't want any part of it but they respect people that are educated that can still get their hands down into their dirt if you're willing to get out there with with and again I'm generalizing but this is true like I learned if I'm gonna go to Tennessee I need to wear a colored shirt I need to wear jeans to church maybe a pair of cowboy boots and like a Carhartt jacket because that's what everyone wears everywhere you go obviously Africans like you guys love to dress up it's the African look it's this like there's there's this there's this there's this it's a Creed in a sense not saying it's right or wrong it isn't right or wrong it's em it's it's it's a it's an ideal that is uh inert in a sense it doesn't really matter it's great in a cultural sense in a in the cultural hierarchy it makes sense because you need to match the people that you're part of the group the part of the group says we need to all Wear Ties it's not that you need to wear a tire you're going to be a sinner it's more like this is what's considered respectable as a man you wear a tie or you wear a button-up shirt or what like that's that's the image it's actually again going back to the idea of the hero this is what a hero looks like to us in this group we can think of it back in the day you might have a night a night look was the hero of that time there's a million paintings about this or the night may have been uh you know a hunter if we go far enough back hunter-gatherers it's the idea of the hero the person that can go out and make things happen in the city the hero is it's a businessman it's someone with a suit on like there's this ideal if you're in a white collar world it's like this is you're wearing a suit you're wearing a tie like this is a hero if you're in a blue collar world like there's still there's a uniform of like this is a hero and then of course that's going to change regionally and again we said all that to kind of talk about Creeds and we need to be able to break beyond the Creed just because I'm in Minnesota and I wear a patterned shirt which patterned shirts are way more common in Minnesota by the way it's weird in the South they don't wear they wear solid shirts which is why brother Steve is wearing solid shirt because he's from Kentucky [Laughter] it's true there are these there if that becomes the main thing where it's like hey I am a Christian I mean look around I'm one of the group based upon the way that I'm dressing I look pretty good I look fresh like this is this is the way that it is or again even into the internal everyone else is doing here the real danger can be as much as our worship is amazing the Creed can become we have church and if you don't have church you're not a Christian if you can't come through that door and be dancing in the aisle then you're out you don't have the Holy Ghost and we have to be careful to not make that the Creed it's it's the the purpose of it is to worship God is to aim at God in everything that we do the goal is to aim our desires our and our intentions towards God and he he will lead us into what we should be doing whatever that thing is in some places that's going to be you need to show up in a suit and tie and in other places that's going to be you should be in a T-shirt and jeans and flip-flops right Jordan get an amen praise the Lord because that's the right context for that in order to be approachable and in order to embody the spirit of God for that season for that place in the music you need to be sensitive in order to come and approaching in the way that God leads you in the time to play the notes that are on your music you can think about it um if you've been to a symphony very often there's there's a point where you come to a solo whether it can be a vocal or a string that's very common that it's a string sometimes it's like a trumpet but it's usually it's a single instrument you come to a point where all of a sudden it's like the clouds part and one stringed instrument is just playing and that's when everybody cries like I cry absolutely it's just a beautiful you know slow part or the cellos just digging in or maybe it's a trumpet depending on what it is what song it is and if that person playing that instrument was looking at the next person's over music they they would miss it and it was their time to play that part no one else was playing that part just them everyone else stops and they play and we are all that person I'm not the hero of your story you're the hero of your story each one of us have a walk that we have to walk we have a story that we are supposed to play out we have something that we are supposed to do if irrespective of everyone else here it's great that everyone else is here it's really nice like it's nice to see a full building that's amazing and yet our calling is to simply walk with him because at the end of the day poem that I love is that no matter who else is in your bed we all sleep alone we sleep alone with our thoughts and our mind we know we know when our bet our head hits the pillow at night we know we know whether or not we've been acting in accordance with our own conscience we know whether or not we've been really striving whether or not we've been missing the mark 1960 I know we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comfort is just beyond the river it was Abraham after he had seen the ground get Barren and the drought come and lot separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world it was after he had heard the wines and cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained in the land that God gave him and told him to sojourn in and as on that day after he had been tried his patience was at the end you think about that his patience was spent he was done again we we don't 25 years 25 years and throughout this time God had come to him and made continuous intimations of the promise you think about that you think of the excitement of Abraham that here God's made him a promise he goes out goes into a famine goes to Egypt lot separates himself for all we know lot may have been his best friend sure there's a reason why lot came with him he cared for him he cared for his nephew but they had that bond that bond between the two of them I suppose not unlike Levi and myself if Levi's we're going out like I don't want to leave Levi behind that he he went through that process of of lot leaving him he goes on this journey and has these continuous instances of the spirit of God where God comes down again and makes himself known to him again and you think about that he didn't know it was going to be 25 years he didn't know it each time God comes to me thinks this is it they're getting ready it's gonna oh it's tomorrow it's happening right now and then he goes another year and then another year and then another year and it might have been three four five years since God talked to him his patience was at the end I want to dwell on that just a minute like because again we we can go right into because we know and we can finish the quote but as it was on that day that went after the trial was over he spake face to face with Elohim under the oak that day and we know that part but he was at the end 25 years I'm going to jump over to just for a second to David yeah David is anointed king little kid probably not that much older than Levi maybe I don't know maybe a teenager he's he's anointed by God to be king not that long after that he's playing music in Saul's Court things are looking pretty good he kills Goliath everyone's super stoked about it he comes best friends with Jonathan the King's son it looks like it should just work just right and little does he know he is about to go off a cliff and he's going to spend who knows how long how many years and years and years suffering I want to just jump over here really quick go to Psalms and I'm watching the time here we're coming to a uh brother kydra digs close so let's go to Psalms 88. one of many Psalms that say basically the same thing but I think that this is great O Lord God of my salvation I have cried day and night before thee let my prayer come before thee incline thy ear unto my cry for my soul is full of troubles and my life draws nigh unto the grave I am counted with them that go down into the pit I am as a man that hath no strength that one has lit I'm just kind of skipping through this thou has laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou has Afflicted me with all thy waves verse 12 shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness but unto thee have I cried O Lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee Lord why cast this thou off my soul why hidest thou fit thy face from me I am Afflicted and ready to die from my youth up from my youth up you look at this suffering suffering while I suffer the terrors I am distracted which that we're distracted means distraught thy Fierce wrath goeth over me thy Terrors have cut me off they came round about me daily like water they come pass me about together lover and friend hast thou put far from me in mine acquaintance Into Darkness now I haven't gone and sourced all this to see what time this was to say he's writing obviously about Jonathan and Etc but I think we can all get the idea David went through a lot of hard times a lot of hard times wrote a lot of songs about it and just as much as there are a lot of songs rejoicing there are a lot of song songs suffering a lot of songs suffering and he's not shy about it he's not shy about bringing that suffering to God why have you cast me off why is this happening to me and he's bringing that to God and yet we know that David was a man after God's Own Heart he is not professing a profession of unbelief in God he is earnestly contending with God he is wrestling with the angel he is he is holding on to God and asking for the for the third Act he's crying out for the third act when how long how long am I going to stay here in this hell how long is this going to go on and he's crying out for it he's crying out for that Redemption 64. actually no I'm going to grab this from Luke 14. verse 26. If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yea and even his own life also he cannot be my disciple that's a hard statement that's a really hard statement it doesn't just say that he's willing to love me more it's that if he doesn't hate them and again it's a hard statement what this is actually getting at is those that are not willing to surrender to me to fully surrender to go beyond family principles family Creeds family ideals family patterns family problems to follow me and to trust in me they cannot be my disciple if we're not willing to lay aside our our family Creed and are even even down to this runs in my family or this is just the way we do this lore or whatever we have to be able to go beyond that to walk with God to truly walk with God to be able to forsake it and to let go of the things of the past and not carry them forward in our lives we've all got problems we all got things again going back to that season of growing When We're Young when our kids were teenagers and we do stupid things and we're going to do more stupid things but [Laughter] we do stupid things and they haunt us they carry forward with us and we think this is who we are you think again of David I was anointed to be king King I was in the court maybe I messed up maybe I missed the will of God maybe God he's not just saying maybe God's forsaking sake of me he's saying you have forsaken me why have you forsaken me he didn't know that he was eventually going to come back around he didn't actually know for all he knew like he is holding on to that anointing those were brutal times brutal times they're living in caves like this is you know we think about if we go over into the Middle East with with with uh the uh different bands that are out there that are coming in at guerrilla warfare that was David hiding out in the case a guerrilla Warrior that's literally what he is and he didn't know that that wasn't that there was a destiny I read a book recently it's called The Tale of Three Kings it's very good I recommend it you can write it down and it talked about the three different types of kings in the stories of Saul David and Absalom beautiful book you can parallel it out into and I'm just taking a Tanzania I know we need to close Saul is someone who is Anointed by God he is Anointed by God and in a lot of ways he's just like boom you look at it the the contrast couldn't be more different here is a person the people picked gets you know and no one did his King crowned everything starts going great and eventually he gets he's possessed by the need to keep his power and you can parallel this into churches ministers that are put in place and they are afraid to lose that power and you can watch The Tyranny that starts to play out anyone that's a threat in their Kingdom Saul David on the other hand is a person who is the unlikely hero this is a person who's got a lot of profits clearly a lot of problems and if you look at these even anointed when he's very young you can imagine that that may have gone to his head you know all my brothers got passed over and look at me I'm the guy like I'm the stuff look at me I'm in the castle now and I like it's growing great it's going great and God took him through as a leader a season of suffering for years and years and years and years so that when he did attain power he knew how to handle it he knew how to handle that power and it didn't go he didn't go to his head and then you can parallel that into the way David handled Absalom David didn't act like Saul you think about it he could have he could have acted exactly like Saul and he could have held on to that I need to con to maintain power but he didn't he actually in a sense let go and he gave it back into the hands of God he recognized the season he was in he recognized the change in the music and he recognized why things were happening the way it was he got it then Absalom and we'll just grab this really quick before we kind of shift gears Absalom as a king as he desired to be king made himself King he seized power he is what David could have been you think about it David had every right to do what Absalom did he's anointed by God he had people backing him and yet when Saul comes into the cave right we know the story Saul comes into the cave they're hanging out David has the opportunity with his mighty men people that killed lions and hundreds of Philistines by themselves they have the opportunity to get rid of this Tyrant right here and yet David didn't because it was I will not strike down the Lord's anointed and you think about it if if he had struck him down the season may not have been ready the people may not have been ready it may have divided the country God had a time and a season for David to come to that position and even though before it might have looked good it might have been like you know what Saul is eventually going to die Jonathan's going to hand over the throne to David something like that but there would have always been this lingering division in the people there always would have been and then Absalom of course seizes power he he without character has been handed an immense amount of privilege to be a son of a king and it goes to his head and you can see this very often the same way people who grow up in a strong Church they don't know what it's like to suffer they don't get it they don't understand that this didn't happen by itself right that the Blood Sweat and Tears of those that went on before is what made this possible may we be like Solomon and ask God give us wisdom to know how to rule this people and in a sense in the the opportunities that are put in front of us both carnally and spiritually God cares about what we have to deal with in the day today may we pray God give us wisdom to know how to engage with these opportunities may we know how not to not to be stupid to be honest like for lack of a better term I'm just using that term as a very just blunt like to not be Fools With The Grace that's been handed to us you see this as well and again I'm kind of coming into but I just I'm going down this channel just in in the natural sense you look at generations of families where there's a season where they fought and they strove and they Hard Times make hard men and hard men make good times Good Times make weak men and a weak men make hard times that's what happens it's the season and the cycle it's the cycle pay attention to the season and the cycle that you're in that we don't go into a hard time that we could have avoided may we play the sheet of music that's in front of us that we that we can pay attention and be in tune with the spirit and the leading of God again both as a church as a whole and as an individual Proverbs 3 11 my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction there are seasons that we go into of chastening Seasons where it just feels like you're just getting beat over and over and over and over again there are seasons there's a reason for it there is a reason I think that we've had so much churchianity and we know so much we can I mean I just think of it today it's like we can pull up the Bible on our phone and we can listen to the whole message on the phone we have access to all of the knowledge oh like 95 of the knowledge in the world on our phone we have a a tremendous gift and yet what that often creates is understanding but not experienced we know a lot about it we can tell you everything about it it's like people that know batting averages they they can tell you all about the sports player every single detail about it but if you ask them to go out there and really throw a football or hit a ball they couldn't do it we must Shalom God let talking about Paul God let a messenger of the Devil Keep beat down talking about Paul he said then when I'm weak I'm strong amen Growing Pains of Grace God brings us uh quote number 227 and sometimes it takes hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us it takes hard trials to put our theories to the test the things that we have in our heads that were like I got this I really know this I got it down and then we get the trial we get the suffering that forces us to take action and to actually act it out surrendering isn't and again it's wonderful we should sing I surrender all because we're professing it we're professing the surrender but real surrender is when God has you in a headlock down on the ground and if you don't you know you can't get out of it and you gotta give in surrender you gotta tap out that is surrender and may we all in surrender entrusting in Walking with God God help us to do not just think it but to actually be able to take that action and it's the grace of God in those times coming to a close in those times the musicians can go ahead and come in those times of suffering in The Growing Pains of Grace may we hear the shift in the music both going into the suffering and recognizing it's about to get real dark because this is the point in the story where it got real dark and it gets real dark and may we also see that ultimately it's not a tragedy it's not a tragedy even if Eve you look at job again I love the story of Job it's not a tragedy there was a Tipping Point where it all it's the definition of a comedy in story it's actually it's actually kind of funny you think about it from God's point of view he's joking around with the devil from God's point of view it's like this is great it's actually comedy to which in the technical sense of Comedy is any story that ends out well any story that ends with something great happening the Bible in the end is laughter it ends well it ends in our favor [Music] last two just one more quote in a scripture from the world is falling apart we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life is a struggle look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong God help us to reinterpret the struggle as the good thing in our life I don't know about you but when things are going really well you get kind of bored everything is so soft and easy and just we turn into God help us to see the struggle as the adventure of Our Lives as exciting that we know that things are happening again if you're reading a book if you're watching a movie it's not very good unless you unless you have Stakes if you have a reason you have something that you're trying to achieve you have something that you're trying to overcome God help us to see our own lives that way that we may have gone through a season of Darkness or we may be going through a season of Darkness but that's not our end that isn't our end they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy they sowed in the right season and they will reap in the right season praise the Lord amen [Music] let's go ahead and sing that song [Music] the word is alive looking out from his throne it's in G or we can play that we'll go to prayer as they Play the song dear father Lord we just come

let's just clap for the Lord amen God is truly good you know our brother was talking about Creeds you know how we have different Creeds that we follow and things like that and you know not nothing bad about them some be good some be you know but he said when it gets in the way of you serving the lord that's where the problem starts you know in I know we we normally give testimonies in the beginning of service I want and I would like to give this quick testimony pertaining to my birthday being tomorrow you know I have met a family that I've known back yesterday and it had brought back a memory to my mind of it was a while ago on Mother's Day I know my mom remembered this so is my dad but it was a while ago on Mother's Day and you know I wasn't really right with the Lord me or my brother at the time and we used to smoke we used to do stuff like that and it was after service we had hopped on the highway and was driving because my cousin my other cousin me and my brother in the back and we had dropped all the windows because my auntie did not like us smoking her car so we try to cover up the scent so we dropped all the windows my cousin had drove on the highway he looked at his brother he said should we take the highway he's been like no let's just take the back roads he said no wrong take the highway and he hopped right on the highway when he did that he went all he tried to go all the way to the left lane as he was going a car was coming so my brother was in the behind the past behind the driver's seat he said AOE watch out as soon as he said that my cousin had pulled the wheel real hard and when he had did that the car started swerving on the highway he's probably going like 75 80. the car started swirling on the highway you know cars that was beside it started to slow down everything is going really slow and it seemed like he was getting control of the car we ended up from the middle left lane all the way to the right it seemed like he was getting control and all of a sudden he hit the dirt on the side of the road and the car flew in the air car rolled 10 to 15 times on the highway and as it was rolling my cousin the passenger seat flew out the sunroof because we opened the window I looked to my brother and it was just flipping he was just like this big guy is just rolling in his car like I couldn't believe what I was seeing and my window was down nobody's wearing seat belts but the driver and my body was going out in the car out in the car was like something was holding me you know in sometimes that comes back to my heart a lot but it didn't it hit me yesterday because of a family I've seen you know they had came after everything and God is just so good you know because if I would have died in that moment [Music] that that would have been the end and I just want to give cuz if it wasn't for him none of us would be here you know because I just wanted to say thank you [Applause] amen all right so enough of that as we dismiss ourselves though let's sing Amazing Grace I made it you know because we all made it you know we got a professor right amen over the place that's all my heart to be over here I made it over over too many danger foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh over oh [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
