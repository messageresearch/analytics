[42:34] sound to the sense over here. God richly

[42:43] We will be reading um some couple of
[42:46] scriptures. We will read um
[42:51] Hebrews chapter 13.
[42:53] Sorry, Hebrews chapter 11.
[42:57] Um Hebrews 11, 1 Corinthians
[43:02] 15 and Thessalonians chapter 4,
[43:08] Hebrews 11:5,
[43:10] 1 Corinthians 15:51
[43:14] and Thessonia 4.
[43:20] Hebrews 11 read of this wise. By faith
[43:23] Enoch was translated that he should not
[43:27] see dead
[43:28] and was not found
[43:31] because God has translated him
[43:34] before his translation. He had this
[43:38] testimony that he pleased God.
[43:43] 1 Corinthians 15
[43:46] 51
[43:49] Paul is speaking here. He said, "Behold,
[43:53] I show you a mystery.
[43:56] We shall not all sleep for certain, but
[44:00] we shall all be changed
[44:03] in a moment, in a twinkle of an eye."
[44:08] at the last trump for the trump that
[44:10] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[44:14] rise incorruptible
[44:16] and we shall be changed.
[44:19] How many believe that?
[44:22] And Thessalonians chapter
[44:24] 4, look at verse 15.
[44:28] This Paul is once speaking that for we
[44:32] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[44:35] that we which are alive and remain unto
[44:38] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[44:41] them which are asleep.
[44:44] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[44:46] heaven with a shout for the voice of the
[44:49] archangel and with the trump of God and
[44:53] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[44:55] Amen. Then we which are alive remain
[44:58] shall be caught up together with them in
[45:02] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[45:05] and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[45:09] May the Lord bless the word in our heart
[45:10] in Jesus name.
[45:12] So I want to speak briefly tonight may
[45:13] be seated on the rapturing faith for
[45:17] rapture power.
[45:20] Rapturing faith for rapture power.
[45:24] Now Brown
[45:27] was speaking the message the invisible
[45:29] union of the bride and the bridegroom.
[45:33] So and that was his thanksgiving
[45:35] message.
[45:36] Amen.
[45:37] Uh a message that come behind uh
[45:40] marriage divorce. So he said it was his
[45:43] thanksgiving message to the bride god.
[45:47] He say I'm thank I am thankful to God to
[45:50] be living in this time of the closing
[45:54] scene of this world history
[45:56] right
[45:57] I don't know if I would have had a say
[46:01] so before the foundation of the world
[46:03] and God would have laid out the program
[46:07] before me and said to me I want you to
[46:11] preach
[46:13] and now what age do you desire to go to
[46:16] the end to preach to to preach. I will
[46:21] have choose this age.
[46:24] It's risen is for I think this is the
[46:28] golden age.
[46:30] Amen.
[46:31] So the age that we are living is not
[46:34] King Edward time. It's not the stone
[46:37] age.
[46:38] Amen. Not the age whereby people are
[46:40] what we say the analog age. Praise the
[46:43] Lord. Yes.
[46:44] So we have gone beyond that. So we are
[46:47] living in a golden age in a digital age
[46:50] in an astronaut age.
[46:53] Praise God.
[46:54] So you cannot expect the same situation
[46:56] of that time to be the same for today.
[46:59] Yes.
[47:00] Amen.
[47:01] Oh. So what a privileged age we're
[47:03] living in.
[47:04] He said I think this is the golden age.
[47:07] He said, "I said they would have loved
[47:09] to have been here during the time of his
[47:11] visit to the earth, but still I think
[47:15] this right now is greater time."
[47:18] Yes.
[47:19] Did you believe that?
[47:20] Yes. Amen.
[47:21] So, because it's a time that is coming
[47:23] to take the people that he has redeemed
[47:26] is redeemed near the resurrection when
[47:29] all the redeemed will come forth.
[47:31] Amen.
[47:31] Amen.
[47:33] So, what a glorious opportunity we have.
[47:36] Amen. to preach to a dying people
[47:39] a great time and we are so enthused
[47:41] about that.
[47:43] Amen. That we as dying men preaching to
[47:45] dying people.
[47:47] Praise God.
[47:48] Because we know that time is fading
[47:50] away.
[47:51] Amen. And time is blending into
[47:53] eternity.
[47:54] Yes.
[47:54] So he said and we know that the history
[47:56] is closing out.
[47:58] Amen.
[47:59] And the world history will soon be over.
[48:02] Then we are going to step into a new
[48:04] day. Amen. To a great millennium.
[48:08] So while the world is waiting for a
[48:10] funeral service and they're preparing
[48:12] for a funeral service. Amen.
[48:13] Come on now.
[48:14] Praise God.
[48:16] I'm call all these ones you are looking
[48:17] around. You see them in your mo in your
[48:20] school in your business place on your
[48:22] place of work. You call them co-workers
[48:24] and co- call them atomic fathers.
[48:27] Amen. He said just once they seeing that
[48:29] do I just there are people meant for a
[48:31] mass funeral. Amen. It said they will be
[48:34] used as a fertilizer of the earth
[48:37] and then the righteous will walk upon
[48:39] the eyes of the wicked.
[48:41] Amen.
[48:42] So what a golden time. It's a million
[48:44] age we're looking into now. A new day.
[48:46] Amen.
[48:47] The closing of time and the blending in
[48:50] of eternity.
[48:53] So that as one believer, I believe in a
[48:55] millennium. A millennium reign with
[48:57] Christ a thousand years upon the earth.
[49:01] What a glorious time.
[49:03] Amen.
[49:04] So, and that is why we are here tonight.
[49:06] We are on expectation for this time.
[49:08] Amen. So, we believe that there's going
[49:10] to be a rapture of the bride
[49:12] and that is the purpose why we are here.
[49:15] So, we're not here to play church
[49:17] or to form any organization. Amen. Or to
[49:20] make some race. Amen. Rat race. Amen.
[49:23] But we are here because we believe that
[49:25] there's going to be a rapture.
[49:27] Amen.
[49:27] Amen. Amen.
[49:28] Apostle Paul said that in first John
[49:30] chapter 4, he said that the trump of God
[49:32] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[49:35] rise first.
[49:36] Amen.
[49:37] He said at this last trump we shall be
[49:40] changed in a moment.
[49:41] Amen.
[49:42] Just in a twinkle of an eye that this
[49:46] mortal body
[49:47] Amen.
[49:48] shall put on immortality.
[49:51] Are we ready for that? Right.
[49:53] So the prophet so so so we are looking
[49:55] for this great coming event. That's what
[49:58] we are looking for this great coming
[50:00] event. Why the world is looking for a
[50:03] funeral service. I said amen. A mass
[50:06] burial. But we are looking for this
[50:08] coming event for it's a promise and we
[50:11] all know that that Paul in 1 Corinthians
[50:13] chapter 15 said behold I show you a
[50:15] mystery
[50:17] which shall not asleep.
[50:19] Yes.
[50:19] Amen.
[50:20] Amen. In other words, we all here shall
[50:22] not die.
[50:23] That's right.
[50:24] Amen.
[50:24] Amen.
[50:25] Amen.
[50:26] That is not our promise.
[50:28] Amen. Our promise is that we shall be
[50:30] changed.
[50:31] Come on now.
[50:32] Do you believe that?
[50:33] Do you believe that?
[50:35] We are waiting for that.
[50:36] We are watching for that. And we know
[50:38] that one day it shall come to pass like
[50:40] it did to Abraham, it will do it to us
[50:42] also.
[50:43] For we are the seeds of Abraham.
[50:45] Praise the Lord.
[50:46] Hallelujah.
[50:48] So Paul is said that we all shall be
[50:50] changed now. But he did not reveal the
[50:53] mystery of the translation. Paul did not
[50:54] do that. See, but Abraham revealed the
[50:56] mystery of the rapture to us.
[50:58] That's right.
[50:59] Amen. For he said, "Three things happen
[51:01] as the Lord descend out of heaven."
[51:03] Three things happened.
[51:05] He said a shout, the voice of the
[51:07] archangel, and the trump of God. And the
[51:10] Lord does three of them as he's
[51:13] descending.
[51:14] Amen.
[51:15] Oh, glory. Amen.
[51:16] You don't get that.
[51:17] So the rapture is not an accident.
[51:20] Are you getting me?
[51:21] It's not an accident,
[51:22] but it's something that uh involve a
[51:25] process,
[51:26] right?
[51:27] Are you getting me?
[51:28] For in the rapture say three things
[51:29] happen.
[51:30] That's right.
[51:31] A shout.
[51:32] Amen. A voice, a trump has to happen
[51:36] before Jesus appear.
[51:38] Did you see that? Yeah.
[51:39] So Jesus does all three of them as when
[51:42] he's descending.
[51:44] As he's coming down, he let out a shout.
[51:47] Are you getting me?
[51:48] Amen. A shout went up first. Then the
[51:51] second was the voice of the archangel as
[51:53] coming. He's coming down. At the last
[51:55] stage of his coming is the trump of God.
[51:59] Is that right?
[51:59] Praise the Lord.
[52:00] He shout. So what is a shout? It's a
[52:02] message going forth first.
[52:05] That's right. The living bread of life
[52:07] bringing forth the breath.
[52:09] Oh, I say thanks be to God.
[52:12] Thanks be to God.
[52:14] A shout
[52:15] a messenger getting the people ready.
[52:20] Did you see that?
[52:20] Yeah.
[52:21] Amen.
[52:22] Bring forth the bride. Get the bride
[52:24] ready. See? Amen. Then the second is the
[52:27] voice of the resurrection.
[52:29] Amen. The voice of the resurrection.
[52:32] They shout the same voice. Amen.
[52:37] That loud voice in St. John 11:38
[52:42] that call Lazarus from the grave. I love
[52:44] that.
[52:45] Amen.
[52:45] Amen.
[52:46] That raised up Lazarus from the grave.
[52:49] Amen. What does it do? Getting the bride
[52:51] together
[52:52] and then the resurrection of the dead.
[52:54] Amen.
[52:55] Amen.
[52:56] You know when Jesus went down there uh
[52:59] in St. John there when he went to uh to
[53:02] the tomb of his friend Lazarus. Amen.
[53:05] And of course you understand you see
[53:07] when matter met Jesus he said Lord if if
[53:10] you have been here we know that our
[53:13] friend Lazarus won't die.
[53:14] Amen.
[53:14] Amen.
[53:15] Say but even now whatever you ask God to
[53:18] do we do it for you.
[53:20] Say even now.
[53:22] Praise God.
[53:23] Hallelujah.
[53:24] Amen. And Jesus said I am the
[53:27] resurrection
[53:28] and the life. And that is the one you
[53:30] believe in.
[53:31] That's the one you are serving now.
[53:32] That's the one that living in your
[53:34] heart. The one that declared that I am
[53:36] the resurrection and life.
[53:38] Amen. Don't let Lazarus die sh so shall
[53:41] he live again.
[53:43] And it was so hard. It was a paradox to
[53:45] matter to say Lazarus shall live again.
[53:48] I know Lord I know that in the last day
[53:52] Lazarus shall live.
[53:54] Praise God.
[53:55] Amen. He say, "Oh, Mary, amen. Believe
[53:58] without this
[53:59] that he shall live again."
[54:00] Right?
[54:01] So, let us go and visit the tomb.
[54:03] You know, Mary could have been wondering
[54:04] what matter would have been wondering
[54:06] what is going on. I would have get out
[54:07] to the tomb. Praise the Lord.
[54:09] Amen.
[54:09] Amen. And the Bible say and he wept.
[54:12] Amen. People say why didn't we? Amen.
[54:15] said but I said very well it doesn't
[54:17] work well for this guy that didn't even
[54:19] believe and he looked down and said well
[54:22] uh he said please um uh Mary mother
[54:29] take the stone off the tomb
[54:31] yes
[54:31] I want a fellowship
[54:34] I want a a fellowship
[54:36] because Lazarus has been sealed away
[54:38] from fellowship all this for four days
[54:41] and they put the Roman seal and seal up
[54:43] that tomb and close it
[54:46] that no way Lazarus can even come out to
[54:48] fellowship
[54:49] because he have been bound there with
[54:50] grave clothes.
[54:52] Talk about a circumstance that Lazarus
[54:54] have been kept in.
[54:55] Amen.
[54:55] Amen. Amen.
[54:57] An impossible situation for Lazarus to
[54:59] ever be in fellowship. And I think that
[55:01] is the way Satan does to sometimes to
[55:04] God's children to cut them out of
[55:05] fellowship. We seal them up there.
[55:08] Hallelujah. And if you look at the
[55:10] situation, you say it's impossible.
[55:12] But I'm telling you, it is possible.
[55:14] Your son will come back.
[55:16] Your wife will come back. Your husband
[55:18] will come back. I don't care. Whatever
[55:21] the devil has taken from you, I will
[55:24] resto say the Lord.
[55:26] Come on.
[55:29] Praise God.
[55:31] Amen.
[55:32] How can death stand before life
[55:34] and life and death standing face to
[55:36] face?
[55:37] Praise God.
[55:38] Hallelujah.
[55:40] Amen. They take away the stone and Mary
[55:42] said mother say oh lord is stinkketh
[55:45] praise God
[55:47] that defining the circumstance that
[55:49] Lazarus is in say behold is stink
[55:52] sometime that is what the devil does too
[55:54] define the circumstance your husband in
[55:57] is in the circumstance of your wife the
[56:00] circumstance of your family your
[56:02] children amen and put them there amen in
[56:05] a very stinking situation and say behold
[56:08] stink it's not possible for them to be
[56:10] saved. Let me tell you the Bible said my
[56:12] hands are not shortened
[56:14] that I cannot save. My hands are not
[56:16] shortened that I cannot redeem.
[56:19] Hallelujah. You are dealing with the
[56:21] creator of the heavens and earth.
[56:23] Hallelujah.
[56:24] He made a sea. He made a mountain. He
[56:26] made the valley.
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:30] Praise God.
[56:32] Said take that stone off. I want to be
[56:33] in fellowship with him.
[56:35] Lose him. Amen.
[56:37] Praise God. He took away the stone. You
[56:38] can imagine a man that been bound with
[56:40] GL grave cloth and lie lay down on the
[56:43] tomb.
[56:43] Praise God. How can a man tied with
[56:46] grave clothes ever ever take a stand and
[56:47] stand up?
[56:49] Praise the Lord. How can he stand up?

[1:01:23] not the preacher.
[1:01:24] Amen.

[1:01:26] But you the church,
[1:01:28] you will speak the word here and there.
[1:01:31] Amen. And it will flash like lightning.
[1:01:34] And the church is coming out.
[1:01:36] Not a psychology. And not some put on,

[1:01:49] Amen.
[1:01:52] Amen.
[1:01:52] Praise God.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:55] Because God has displayed that before.
[1:01:57] That's right.
[1:01:58] Amen. It It's not It's not a new.
[1:02:00] It's something that he promised to the
[1:02:01] church.
[1:02:02] Jesus promised to the church and we have
[1:02:04] it in the Old Testament. Amen. It has
[1:02:06] been displayed before. Amen.
[1:02:09] You can imagine Elijah. You can imagine
[1:02:12] Elijah walked down before Ahab when he
[1:02:14] were tired of the sins of uh of Israel.
[1:02:18] Amen. And Jezebel has run over the
[1:02:21] country and uh form his Bible school and
[1:02:25] then send gave a scholarship to the
[1:02:27] young men and send them out to eval the
[1:02:30] nation and then they have run out this
[1:02:32] great scholarship and convert Israel
[1:02:34] from from Jehovah into idolatry.
[1:02:38] Do you see that? until Elijah say I'm
[1:02:40] the only one alone said oh they all kill
[1:02:43] all the prophet and God speak to Elijah
[1:02:45] no I have 700 time
[1:02:47] do you this church you can imagine the
[1:02:49] situation will make Elijah to say that
[1:02:52] I'm the only one left
[1:02:53] are you following
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:54] praise God
[1:02:55] the man was so tired of the situation
[1:02:57] and then he walked down before Ahab
[1:02:59] Amen sayhab
[1:03:01] let me tell you said from this day
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] there shall be no due
[1:03:07] yes There shall be no rain
[1:03:10] until I
[1:03:12] call for it
[1:03:13] according to my word.
[1:03:15] Now that was not trust the Lord.
[1:03:17] Amen.
[1:03:18] Because Elijah knew that Joshua has
[1:03:21] displayed this anointing before.
[1:03:23] Are you getting me church?
[1:03:24] Joshua have stood there
[1:03:26] before natural element.
[1:03:28] Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] When the sun was going down
[1:03:30] and Joshua said Belgian let's go for a
[1:03:33] prayer meeting. Let us fast.
[1:03:35] You never said that.
[1:03:36] Amen. Got time for fast and prayer.
[1:03:39] Just stood there. Look at the sun.
[1:03:42] I'm a son of God
[1:03:43] and I speak to you son like son stand
[1:03:47] still
[1:03:48] and moon angel
[1:03:50] and moon and son obey Joshua until
[1:03:53] finish the enemy.
[1:03:54] So if God could answer Joshua's voice,
[1:03:56] what about his own voice?
[1:03:58] Yes.
[1:03:59] Amen.
[1:04:00] Because the Bible said there were never
[1:04:01] a time that God answered the voice of a
[1:04:03] human being than that time of days of
[1:04:05] Joshua. So that otherwise God listen to
[1:04:08] his son.
[1:04:08] Yes.
[1:04:09] Amen.
[1:04:10] Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] Know what Elijah said, the hour has
[1:04:14] come.
[1:04:14] For the father to honor the son.
[1:04:16] Amen.
[1:04:18] So Elijah speak before Ahab.
[1:04:20] You know Ahab never took Elijah serious.
[1:04:24] Cuz if Elijah could have said according
[1:04:26] to the word of the Lord,
[1:04:28] Elijah could have Ahab could have said
[1:04:30] okay. Oh, why do you do that? Why do you
[1:04:32] say that? He could have reacted. But
[1:04:34] because he said according to my word, it
[1:04:37] must have looked at him. You you
[1:04:40] not serious.
[1:04:41] And Elijah took the key of binding
[1:04:46] that Jesus spoke of. Say whatoever you
[1:04:48] as a church
[1:04:50] shall bind on the earth.
[1:04:51] Say I Jesus will bind it in heaven.
[1:04:54] Say whatever you as a church loose on
[1:04:56] the earth,
[1:04:56] I Jesus will lose it in heaven.
[1:04:58] You see authority such authority that
[1:05:01] God has given to the church. Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] But the problem with the church is that
[1:05:06] the church has forgotten the power of
[1:05:08] binding.
[1:05:11] Amen.
[1:05:12] The key that God give to the church to
[1:05:14] bind and to lose.
[1:05:15] The church has forgotten that key. But
[1:05:17] Elijah took the key and he lock up the
[1:05:20] heavens and put the key in his pocket.
[1:05:22] And Elijah walked away.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:25] And Ahab thought it was a joke.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:28] But first year no rain. Second year no
[1:05:32] rain. and no due tell there no rain.
[1:05:35] You know Israel must have gone for
[1:05:37] prayers. They might be sick in the face
[1:05:38] of Jehovah. Lord give us rain. You can
[1:05:41] imagine God looking at Israel. They said
[1:05:44] rain? What happened to the rain? They
[1:05:48] said Lord you have wed the rain. But I
[1:05:51] said I wed rain. I never wed rain. I am
[1:05:54] not the one that locked the rain. The
[1:05:56] key is not with me. Look for Elijah.
[1:05:59] Yeah.
[1:06:00] Look for
[1:06:01] if you want to rain, look for Elijah.
[1:06:04] That is why Ahab was looking for Elijah.
[1:06:08] Do you see that?
[1:06:09] Amen. If they had not heard that Elijah
[1:06:12] hold the key,
[1:06:13] they even look for Elijah.
[1:06:15] Amen. Said let look for Elijah. He was a
[1:06:17] key.
[1:06:18] Amen. If we don't get Elijah, then we in
[1:06:20] trouble.
[1:06:21] Praise God.
[1:06:23] Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] Until Elijah, God spoke to Elijah, show
[1:06:26] yourself. Go and call them for a m camel
[1:06:28] shoulder to prove that yes you hold the
[1:06:31] key. Let's go to Mount camel. Amen.
[1:06:33] Because the bride will also have a
[1:06:36] mazion shoulder.
[1:06:38] Are you getting me church?
[1:06:39] Before we leave for the rapture, there
[1:06:41] will be a mazion shoulder.
[1:06:43] There be shoulder between the bride and
[1:06:45] the world council of churches.
[1:06:47] Amen.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] Praise God. And he went, of course, you
[1:06:52] know the story how he called the fire
[1:06:53] down and and then he bring the fire down
[1:06:56] and consume the sacrifice, restore the
[1:06:58] altar. And then he went and to bring the
[1:07:00] rain. But before the rain could fall, he
[1:07:03] say guide up your lines. Amen.
[1:07:07] Stir up your charots. Charot
[1:07:10] run faster lest the rain be thee not.
[1:07:13] For I hear a sound of a branch of rain.

[1:07:19] and then take off a very high speed.
[1:07:22] Amen. Because the cloud is moving.

[1:15:03] have we achieved? Praise God.
[1:15:05] But have been hitting Abraham all the
[1:15:06] time. Abraham said, "We need of
[1:15:08] patience. Let us wait for they that wait
[1:15:11] upon the Lord
[1:15:12] shall renew their strength.

[1:15:32] the visitation of the angels.
[1:15:36] Mrs. Lord did not receive angelic
[1:15:38] visitation.
[1:15:39] Praise God. But three men came down.
[1:15:42] Amen. And they met Abraham. and and and
[1:15:46] the Elohim was speaking to Abraham and
[1:15:48] said, "Where is your wife Sarah?" Sarah
[1:15:50] was still behind the tent.
[1:15:53] Are you getting me church? Winkle with
[1:15:55] all kind of situation there.
[1:15:57] And then Elohim said,
[1:16:00] "I will visit you." I said, "Your wife
[1:16:01] shall have a son."
[1:16:02] And Sarah had it. My wife, your wife
[1:16:06] shall have a son. Just laugh in his in
[1:16:08] his in her sleeve.

[1:16:45] And Sarah, Amen, jumped out of the tent.
[1:16:49] And came out before Elohim.
[1:16:52] He said, "Ne, I never lie. I know I
[1:16:54] never laugh. I never laugh."
[1:16:56] Praise God. You can imagine Abraham look
[1:16:58] at his wife Sarah and look at Papa
[1:17:01] Elohim. He said, "Who is saying the
[1:17:03] truth?"
[1:17:04] If I said Sarah, but I know this is God,
[1:17:08] right? Hallelujah.
[1:17:09] And God can lie.
[1:17:10] Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] And if I say God, Amen. Sarah will say,
[1:17:15] "Oh, you mean you will esteem the words
[1:17:17] of a stranger, a visitor that you just
[1:17:20] see today,

[1:17:26] of all these years I've stayed with you
[1:17:27] in the marriage, you couldn't believe
[1:17:29] me. You you are taking a vicious word."
[1:17:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:34] Look at say Abraham was in a fix.
[1:17:37] Yes.
[1:17:37] Amen. Who will he stand with?

[1:17:57] He will bypass every unbelief.

[1:18:01] meet your heart desires.
[1:18:04] Amen.
[1:18:04] Praise God.
[1:18:06] Amen. He he he just take it from Abraham
[1:18:09] there. He said
[1:18:12] he said but is there anything too hard
[1:18:13] for the Lord?
[1:18:14] Amen.
[1:18:15] Are you getting me say is there anything
[1:18:16] too hard for the Lord? I will certainly
[1:18:19] return back to you.
[1:18:21] Oh praise God. So if God
[1:18:24] could bypass Sarah's condition and he
[1:18:27] will visit Sarah and give Sarah a body
[1:18:30] change. Amen. That same God will visit
[1:18:32] you. He will bypass all circumstance.
[1:18:35] will bypass all condition. He will come
[1:18:38] to you according to the time of life and
[1:18:41] you shall be changed.
[1:18:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:45] Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] Glory.
[1:18:48] It's a promise.
[1:18:49] Because Abraham and Sarah was a type
[1:18:52] of you and I.
[1:18:54] He knows the day we are facing.
[1:18:56] Abraham said the power of sin is more
[1:18:58] harder to fight in this age than every
[1:19:00] other age. That's right.
[1:19:01] Even than the age of Jesus.
[1:19:03] That's what the prophet said. So but sin
[1:19:05] has come to his maturity and God know
[1:19:08] that Amen. when the enemy come like a
[1:19:09] flood he will rise and stand against
[1:19:12] him.
[1:19:14] Right.
[1:19:14] Amen.
[1:19:15] Amen.
[1:19:16] So he bring that thought pool to the
[1:19:18] prophet himself. You see that how sister
[1:19:21] asked for his sons two sons and and he
[1:19:23] said I give give you two sons and then
[1:19:26] those two boys were saved. Are you
[1:19:28] following church?
[1:19:29] Yes.
[1:19:29] Amen. That was a spoke word salvation.
[1:19:31] displayed that displayed that five
[1:19:32] times. Even spoke word healing for his
[1:19:35] wife.
[1:19:35] Are you getting me? Touch.
[1:19:37] Amen. Before the doctor hand touched my
[1:19:38] wife. Let that that tumor be gone and
[1:19:42] the thing disappear.
[1:19:43] Amen.
[1:19:43] I thought about it. Amen. I said if God
[1:19:46] can do that for the prophet, he can do
[1:19:48] that for us.
[1:19:54] A sister called me one time
[1:19:56] sister.
[1:20:00] He called me and said, "Pastor," I said,
[1:20:02] "What is that?" He said, "There's
[1:20:03] something I've been keeping from you,
[1:20:05] but it has gone off hand." I said, "What
[1:20:07] is that?" He said, "I have a lump
[1:20:09] growing in my breast." So, and I've been
[1:20:12] praying. I don't understand this lump
[1:20:14] developing. So, I have to go to see a
[1:20:16] doctor today. When I went there, the
[1:20:18] doctor said, "Well, it's cancer." you
[1:20:21] have to be operated on said but first
[1:20:24] you we will do a test and so forth and
[1:20:27] check before the operation will commence

[1:20:36] not there said pastor I don't know what
[1:20:38] to do I said yes indeed you don't have
[1:20:41] money I said but do you have Jesus
[1:20:46] do you have Jesus
[1:20:48] if you don't have money do you have
[1:20:49] Jesus
[1:20:49] yes
[1:20:50] he said I have Jesus Jesus. I said fine.
[1:20:52] Jesus will do it without money, without
[1:20:53] price.
[1:20:55] Amen. He will do the operation without
[1:20:56] money, without price.
[1:20:58] He's not going to charge you for
[1:20:59] nothing.
[1:21:00] I said, do you believe in Jesus?
[1:21:02] Amen.
[1:21:02] He said, "Yes, I believe pastor, I
[1:21:04] believe." I said, "Okay, now let us
[1:21:05] pray."
[1:21:06] And we prayed. I committed to God hand.
[1:21:09] Amen. That the same God that take care
[1:21:11] of some murder, that same God will take
[1:21:12] care of her.
[1:21:14] So, and after speaking to her,
[1:21:15] encouraged her like that said, "Okay."
[1:21:17] So uh the day that she was to go and
[1:21:20] collect the result he called me said

[1:21:25] collect the result today and then they
[1:21:27] will booking my give an appointment for
[1:21:29] the operation. I said I said what do I
[1:21:32] do? Do I still go there? I said yes. I
[1:21:34] said go

[1:21:39] We believe what go God can do.
[1:21:40] Yes.
[1:21:41] You said you don't have the money for
[1:21:42] the operation.
[1:21:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:44] But you have Jesus
[1:21:46] who can do it without charging you.
[1:21:48] Then you have to go.

[1:21:51] Amen.

[1:26:20] Come on.
[1:26:21] You understand?
[1:26:22] Amen. He was wounded for transgression.
[1:26:25] He was bruised for iniquity. And the
[1:26:28] chastisement and peace was upon him. And
[1:26:31] by his stripes you were here.

[1:26:48] Oh, in looking away to Jesus was saying,
[1:26:51] I'm going to say something to you that I
[1:26:54] haven't said all along. Is it that is is
[1:26:57] it a thing that we have been looking
[1:26:58] forward to for so long at least for at
[1:27:02] least many years four or five years or
[1:27:05] maybe the thought pool it has been
[1:27:08] vindicated there's a prophet saying that
[1:27:11] and I'm sure you know what it is
[1:27:14] he's telling the church you know what it
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:17] yes
[1:27:18] he said now remember there will never be
[1:27:20] an impestation to that
[1:27:22] that's why I so felt sorry for ministers
[1:27:24] are trying to be like William Brier.
[1:27:26] Come on.
[1:27:27] Amen. They want to practice give like
[1:27:30] the prophet.
[1:27:31] Amen. Want to practice hirement.
[1:27:36] H which is a prophetic ministry of the
[1:27:40] son of man specifically to Elijah.
[1:27:43] Say he gave that that ministry. He
[1:27:45] showed that ministry to the Jews.
[1:27:48] Amen. They received that sign.
[1:27:50] And and the Samaritan received that
[1:27:52] sign. said but this last the gentile
[1:27:54] time amen is giving the gentile as the
[1:27:58] last sign. So if the prophecy is the
[1:28:01] last sign to the gentile where are these
[1:28:04] ministers coming from
[1:28:06] yes
[1:28:08] just b of impersonators
[1:28:09] to cause confusion over amen
[1:28:12] amen it's one man ministry
[1:28:14] that's right
[1:28:15] son of man ministry to fulfill St. Luke
[1:28:17] 17:10
[1:28:18] right
[1:28:19] so Ram said well remember there will
[1:28:22] never be an impersonation to that the
[1:28:24] thoughtful cause it can't be it cannot
[1:28:28] amen I will take that secret to the
[1:28:30] grave
[1:28:32] amen say but now it's in existence
[1:28:35] amen I have I've been one of these amen
[1:28:38] that right at at this time now it just
[1:28:41] happened say it just happened so it
[1:28:44] could be it could identify his presence
[1:28:45] among us the third fold. Amen. See, say,
[1:28:49] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:28:53] until this council of church begin to
[1:28:55] tighten up.
[1:28:57] See the promise.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:00] And when it does, Amen. When it does,
[1:29:03] the Pentecosters can impersonate and so
[1:29:06] forth can imp almost impersonate
[1:29:08] anything that can be done. It's going on
[1:29:10] now. He said but when the time comes
[1:29:13] when the squeeze come down then you will
[1:29:16] see what you have seen temporarily
[1:29:19] it will be manifested in the fullness of
[1:29:21] his power.
[1:29:23] Say see see
[1:29:27] amen.
[1:29:28] Now the prophecy that well he said we
[1:29:30] have to slow down because he was going
[1:29:32] faster
[1:29:33] with that super anointing. You
[1:29:35] understand? And he has told us all what
[1:29:38] it's all about. He has talked about the
[1:29:39] first pool and the second pool
[1:29:41] discernment of the hand and the and of

[1:29:57] That's why he said that we have been
[1:29:59] clothed with the garment of the promised
[1:30:02] one.

[1:30:15] Say, so we've been waiting. The problem
[1:30:16] was going so fast. It's the frequency is
[1:30:18] so high.
[1:30:19] But they have to slow down because the
[1:30:21] bride must catch up.
[1:30:24] You understand?
[1:30:25] Amen. And the bride must put on the
[1:30:28] bride materials.
[1:30:29] The seven seal cometh.
[1:30:31] Amen.
[1:30:32] You get a church. Yes.
[1:30:33] The spread must enter into that to pool

[1:30:43] Hallelujah.
[1:30:44] The bride must get into the mystery of
[1:30:47] the seven seal
[1:30:48] with the mist of the going away.
[1:30:50] So have to wait. Amen. Say just wait
[1:30:53] until the world council of church said
[1:30:56] rise up.
[1:30:57] You understand? And then you see in his
[1:31:00] own word that's why I have to take
[1:31:02] everything the prophet said to be to be
[1:31:05] serious
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:10] how can that man Elijah
[1:31:13] will not say what when that pope e will
[1:31:16] be brought out of United States
[1:31:21] praise the lord and
[1:31:23] can't do that
[1:31:26] cannot do that because America is a
[1:31:30] forceful country
[1:31:31] is the police of the earth. Are you
[1:31:34] getting me s
[1:31:35] is a lamb. But you see when the Bible
[1:31:37] said the lamb have two little horns.

[1:31:41] you have the civil horn
[1:31:44] also have the ecclesic horn
[1:31:46] on that same lamb, not another lamb.
[1:31:49] And that represent United State.
[1:31:52] Are you following church? So those two
[1:31:54] powers, those two those two horns must
[1:31:56] project out
[1:31:58] and the prophet spoke about that it will
[1:32:00] be taken out of America.
[1:32:02] Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] Amen.
[1:32:04] You know, praise God.

[1:32:07] Look, there are things that that that
[1:32:09] the prophet spoke that you know, you
[1:32:11] can't beat it.
[1:32:12] Yeah.
[1:32:13] Right.
[1:32:14] Amen.
[1:32:14] You can't beat it.
[1:32:16] When the prophet said that the the the
[1:32:18] second coming of Christ, the rapture
[1:32:20] will not take place, will not come until
[1:32:22] that the old maps of Europe, Amen, where
[1:32:26] the Roman rules say must come together.
[1:32:29] The east and the west bing wall broken

[1:36:48] Amen. A civil horn.
[1:36:51] Now if you see it, Abraham said, "Watch
[1:36:54] New York."
[1:36:56] You see, there's something about New
[1:36:58] York. You see, watch. We find out that

[1:38:01] Amen. And the religious power of the
[1:38:03] world, the seat is in America, let
[1:38:06] nation, I mean the workers of churches.
[1:38:09] And the prophet told us that the leader
[1:38:11] of this work of churches is the wind.
[1:38:14] Did you say that?
[1:38:15] That's right.
[1:38:16] Amen. And he said is a romalic church.
[1:38:19] He said don't fear the barbon cutting.
[1:38:21] Don't fear the iron cutting but fear the
[1:38:23] popular cutting.
[1:38:25] That's right.
[1:38:25] Say fight romanism. You understand?
[1:38:29] But but you can see what happened to her
[1:38:31] and what happened? Why must it be at
[1:38:34] this time that the pope will pass away
[1:38:37] and then they will bring the new pope
[1:38:39] from the United State.
[1:38:42] Before now there was a debate coming out
[1:38:45] from Rome and saying it's impossible
[1:38:47] that said no no they can't allow pope
[1:38:49] from America. Amen. But of course you
[1:38:52] know before the pope came you see what
[1:38:55] what is put on online how the president
[1:38:58] want to become the pope dress like the
[1:38:59] pope
[1:39:03] and even suggest it say well you know
[1:39:05] the pope can they can make him the pope.
[1:39:09] Yeah. He put a he put on his his 20 20
[1:39:11] handle. He never take it down. Are you
[1:39:14] put a church? You understand? But he has
[1:39:16] sent a message
[1:39:18] to Rome.
[1:39:20] Are you getting me church? He has sent a
[1:39:22] message because America must speak like
[1:39:24] the dragon before the beast.
[1:39:29] Say a message went for Rome and Rome
[1:39:31] have to do his election quickly and pick
[1:39:33] up the pope from America, United States.
[1:39:37] Not just America but United, state of
[1:39:40] America and put him there. Today we see
[1:39:44] the two horns.
[1:39:46] Amen.
[1:39:47] The civil on
[1:39:49] and the classical on
[1:39:51] these two power has now concentrated now
[1:39:55] not in Rome but right in our America the
[1:39:59] two power. Do you think that the pope
[1:40:01] will do anything against United State
[1:40:06] his first citizenship
[1:40:08] that is swore allegiance to you making
[1:40:10] mistake?
[1:40:12] Praise God.
[1:40:13] Now you can see what is doing what is
[1:40:14] going on right now. The power that is in
[1:40:17] the United States right now. So and then
[1:40:19] the pride where are we at?
[1:40:22] Where are we at?
[1:40:23] Are you getting me church?
[1:40:26] Oh praise the Lord.
[1:40:28] Oh, people think that all this u uh what
[1:40:30] do you call uh they call it uh
[1:40:33] presidential
[1:40:37] what what do they call it that he
[1:40:39] normally sign
[1:40:42] executive order
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:47] the s the most executive order
[1:40:50] and not listen to anybody
[1:40:52] not not ruled by constitution
[1:40:54] executive order executive order,
[1:40:57] executive order,
[1:40:58] and it's shaking the nature with what?
[1:41:00] Executive order.
[1:41:03] So, do you think that if let all the
[1:41:04] churches close down, executive order, it
[1:41:07] will not close?
[1:41:11] Praise God.
[1:41:12] Don't America
[1:41:14] pass a budget, the big big bill. Do they
[1:41:18] pass it?
[1:41:18] That's right.
[1:41:20] To fund to fund ICE
[1:41:23] to deport all the immigrant
[1:41:26] Don't they pass a big bill?
[1:41:29] All the big all the big bills and so
[1:41:30] forth. So he said look these things are
[1:41:33] not look is the hand of God
[1:41:36] because the Bible say God rules in the
[1:41:38] affairs of man.
[1:41:40] He controls. Look everything worked out.
[1:41:43] Amen. According to God's own plan.
[1:41:44] There's nothing out of
[1:41:45] Ca.
[1:41:46] There's no mistake about it.
[1:41:48] God is working out something. And the
[1:41:50] bride the church is the power that is
[1:41:53] shaking this hour. A church is right up
[1:41:56] on their feet. There's a power coming up
[1:41:58] in a church.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:02] Amen.
[1:42:04] True.
[1:42:04] He tell the church rise up because
[1:42:06] because
[1:42:07] I have yet the night see. He said that
[1:42:09] well he said we take a hour of crisis.
[1:42:12] Amen. To shake this bride said the great
[1:42:15] portion of faith.
[1:42:16] Amen. Always come at the hour of crisis.
[1:42:19] Amen.
[1:42:20] Amen.
[1:42:20] You understand church? So that is why
[1:42:22] the faith that light do in the bride
[1:42:25] will be sparked up like that like fire
[1:42:29] the dynamic will strike it.
[1:42:31] Hallelujah.
[1:42:31] Oh praise be to God.
[1:42:34] Praise God.
[1:42:36] Hallelujah.
[1:42:37] Abraham said you have never seen power
[1:42:39] yet.
[1:42:40] He said I know it for a fight for a
[1:42:42] fact. It's a power coming into the
[1:42:44] church
[1:42:45] that they will speak the word like that.
[1:42:47] You anoint the people they will speak
[1:42:48] and it will flash like lightning.
[1:42:50] Amen. That is thus said the Lord.
[1:42:53] It cannot fail, brother.
[1:42:55] It cannot fail.
[1:42:56] Oh, Abraham said, "Amen. The what you
[1:42:59] see I manifest temporarily will be
[1:43:01] manifested in the fullness of his
[1:43:03] power."
[1:43:03] Yes.
[1:43:04] And I said, "See, see see." So, and
[1:43:06] everyone knows that for as certainly as
[1:43:09] the first was identified, so the second
[1:43:12] being identified. Uh, amen. And if you
[1:43:15] think real
[1:43:17] closely, you are spiritual. As the Bible
[1:43:20] said, yet to him the heart wisdom, the
[1:43:24] thought is properly identified.
[1:43:26] See, we know where it is. So the thought
[1:43:30] pool is here.
[1:43:33] Did he say that?
[1:43:34] Yes.
[1:43:35] He said, but it's so sacred that I
[1:43:37] mustn't say nothing much about it. say
[1:43:40] as I as they told me in the beginning he
[1:43:42] said this say nothing of it. So you see
[1:43:45] remember that years ago I it will speak
[1:43:49] for itself
[1:43:51] no impersonation.
[1:43:53] Amen.
[1:43:54] The third pole is not mathematics.
[1:43:57] No
[1:43:58] it not say oh bra what is your answer?

[1:44:13] overnight from place to place.
[1:44:16] Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] There will be a change take place.
[1:44:19] Amen.
[1:44:19] All of a sudden you'll be changed in the
[1:44:22] moment in the to
[1:44:24] and you be to travel with a thought like
[1:44:26] a thought.
[1:44:27] It's and then you will see the dead in
[1:44:29] Christ.
[1:44:31] Do you get it, church?
[1:44:32] Right.
[1:44:32] Because the power will shake them that
[1:44:35] engrave. That's right.
[1:44:37] Oh, praise God.
[1:44:39] Oh, it's so sacred. Amen.
[1:44:42] If it will speak for itself. You see,
[1:44:44] I've tried to explain.
[1:44:47] Amen. Others and I made mistake. But
[1:44:49] this will be the thing that to my
[1:44:52] opinion. Amen. I don't say the Lord tell
[1:44:54] me this. He said, but this will be a
[1:44:57] thing that will start the rapturing
[1:44:59] faith.
[1:45:00] Did you get that
[1:45:02] for the going away? the third pole, the
[1:45:05] super anointing, that will be the thing
[1:45:08] that will start the rapturing faith.
[1:45:10] That's right.
[1:45:12] It's tightening.
[1:45:14] And then when that time comes and the
[1:45:17] press come to a place to where you are
[1:45:20] pressed out is that right?
[1:45:22] Yes.
[1:45:23] Now watch what I'm fixing to tell you in
[1:45:25] a few minutes.
[1:45:28] So watch the thought put down. See it
[1:45:31] will be absolutely to the total lost
[1:45:34] but it will be for the bride and the
[1:45:36] church.
[1:45:38] Praise be to God.
[1:45:39] Hallelujah. Then he said here now let me
[1:45:42] say this thing something too. Say this
[1:45:44] is uniting time. See the church is
[1:45:46] uniting nations uniting unit 19th time
[1:45:49] of God and is bride too. And I say this
[1:45:52] with reverence.

[1:46:01] Amen.
[1:46:01] I believe he's sealed in the kingdom of
[1:46:04] God. Do you believe that?
[1:46:06] That the bride has been sealed with a
[1:46:08] seven seal message.
[1:46:09] Amen.

[2:02:12] is contagious.

[2:08:48] bring your children to your hand now. I
[2:08:50] don't care what Peter did, whatever the
[2:08:53] situation, whatever challenge they're
[2:08:55] facing spiritually, physically,
[2:08:58] materially. Father, in the name of
[2:09:00] Jesus, I speak to them now. I speak to
[2:09:04] them now to possess their kids, possess
[2:09:07] their inheritance, take it over. Why is
[2:09:10] a natural thing today, it is yours.

[2:09:37] heart desire. Receive your heart desire.
[2:09:41] Receive your heart desire. I know you
[2:09:43] have been praying. You have been seeking
[2:09:45] the face of God. But today is your day.
[2:09:48] Angels are here to give you your desire
[2:09:50] of your heartful
[2:09:52] for a purpose.

[2:10:32] rapturing faith, rapture power.
[2:10:36] That hands is not your hand. That hand
[2:10:40] represent the hand of our Lord Jesus
[2:10:41] Christ. Those
[2:10:44] hands represent the hands of our Lord
[2:10:47] and there's nothing too hard for God to
[2:10:49] do.

[2:10:55] the circumstance that are burden your
[2:10:56] heart. Abraham said God want you to be
[2:10:59] happy. God doesn't want you to be
[2:11:01] worried. So anything that is worrying
[2:11:04] you, disturbing your mind, that is an
[2:11:06] enemy. So now I'm going to speak to that
[2:11:09] thing right now. The God of Elijah, the
[2:11:13] God of William, that God is here to meet
[2:11:17] your needs and to set the captive free.

[2:11:24] handful for a purpose. He has commanded
[2:11:26] his angels to give you a special
[2:11:29] blessing. As his hands are laid, the
[2:11:33] Bible, and they shall lay hands on the
[2:11:34] sick, shall recover. Shall lay hands
[2:11:37] upon one another. And God will meet you.
[2:11:39] We meet you. We meet you. Oh yes. Oh
[2:11:43] yes. Oh yes.
[2:11:46] Speak that need.
[2:11:49] Speak that need. Speak it out.
[2:11:54] Oh yes.
[2:11:57] That's it.
[2:12:00] He's a God that answers prayer.
[2:12:04] Please softly
[2:12:06] softly.
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:11] Dear Lord Jesus,

[2:12:48] for. Oh God of Elijah. Lord I bring them
[2:12:52] now. This your dear children. I bring
[2:12:54] them to you by faith in the shed blood
[2:12:58] of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who

[2:14:05] their testimony. Yes indeed is a
[2:14:07] miracle. Yes, you are the miracle
[2:14:09] working God. So I pray father God that
[2:14:12] the Holy Spirit will take oh God this
[2:14:15] voice of mine oh Lord and go straight
[2:14:18] right into their heart. I pray an
[2:14:20] anointed faith in them. Lord, I bring
