bless you thank you musicians amen let's take our Bibles let's take our Bibles praise the Lord Saint John chapter 28. Saint John chapter 28 praise the Lord Saint John chapter 28 let's read verse 18. Saint John chapter 28 let's read verse 18. there is Matthew chapter 28 oh my God oh my God you know you're in trouble this morning amen praise the Lord see Matthew chapter 28 . that's the reason why I'm just I'm hearing noise just like in a temple Matthew chapter 28 let's read verse 18 and we read it together we're reading one verse it will have our seat and then we will go into the rest of uh what we want to talk about this morning let's read that one verse together and Jesus came and speak unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth can we read that again all power all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth heavenly father bless your word this morning oh God it's not how many verses we read but Lord Jesus just one honorland verse in your word is enough Lord father God to change our destiny is it not to convey The Sinner Lord God is enough to cast The Devil away father Lord just one word from you o God so Lord we pray that Lord you will bless Lord father this verse that we have read this morning Lord God after your resurrection that was your statement of God all power in heaven and in Earth is given unto men and your Prophet came and taught us Lord you invested our power in the church or all that was in Christ you you pour into the church Lord so God we want to identify ourselves with all power this morning in precious Lord father God lord we know it's giving to us Lord Lord is just the knowledge to use it father the understanding of what it means to the church so we pray this morning that God you will just come and instruct us in your word oh Father this morning oh God we we just want to submit ourselves and bring our spirit in every other Spirit subject to the Holy Ghost this morning and we ask that God you have your way Lord speak to us who God father instruct us so Lord oh god father Lord Jesus you said blessed is he to God that is now offended amen all may offense not be fine in us this morning oh God May there be nothing Lord God that struggle with truth may we your God be able to embrace your word and be like married and say be it unto me according to your word bless us oh Father we thank you we Praise You In Jesus wonderful name we pray amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] daughter sister beveling been doing everything to make sure that her dad is okay so it's good to see him coming in this morning into the church amen and we want to just greet all of our uh saints that are streaming into the service this morning and the Lord bless you you may have your seat as we want to just trust the law for what we want to speak this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I thought I spoke about uh preaching on this subject here the condescending of God and uh I want to take a portion of that of that uh subject even though I have not spoken it I realize that I'm having a bunch of uh Loose Ends of subject that is being a wider I've just I've not been continuing or finishing my thought I know I spoke on the you know the the witch that is leading the last day of church I want to go back to that and then uh some of you uh messages we've been preaching and that we have not really had the time to to uh to finish them up I also want to go back to uh swearing in oats that we spoke about last week looking at the difference between when the person's word and when a person swore with an oath but this morning uh uh as I said I want to take a portion of a subject I've been studying on the condescending of God but uh I want to speak on the bride co-equality restore the bride call equality restore praise the Lord in the message of marriage and divorce brother Branham says the confidence was co-equal when God made man the coveting was co-equal but now after the fall there is another Covenant man when men fall God now made another Covenant now she's no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant Now Eve was no longer on the basis of coal equality with with with Adam and uh Genesis 15 come and God says 3 15 he says your husband will have the root over you and so that is that is what we want to look at this morning the bride called equality restore and what I want to deal with this morning I want to talk the difference between Power Wave and power over there's a difference between Power Wave and power over if I was if I would just jump into the water and you see what I'm going is the other uh uh God don't have power over his people praise the Lord yeah I want to get your wheel spinning this morning God has power with his people uh brother brother Stephen ajaro A couple of months when he was back with us here uh uh one of the evening before he and myself when uh [Music] uh the evening he was here before testifying he he he there with uh Jesus uh uh statement when he was talking there in the gospel and he brought a wonderfully how how Jesus in the three the three gospels there were days Jesus said Matthew chapter 10 I have given you power against power against every unclean spirit and in Mark chapter 6 Jesus said I've given you power over every unclean spirit and uh in in Luke also Jesus used the same statement I've given you power over so if you study the scripture you will realize that God gave us power over God have power over the the creation he's the god of the creation everything that was created he have power over it but when it comes to his people there is something different about it that I want for us to be able to see and so there's a difference between Power Wave and power over that's why we want to we want to we want to study this morning from the word of God and uh but if you if you even look at this this whole thing of power against and power over you'll realize that um all the gospel there with that statement and there with power in a very different way just like I said Matthew chapter 10 Jesus said I've given you power against every unclean spirits in Luke 6 Jesus used the same thing dealing with the same uh uh uh statement he said giving you power over every unclean spirit in sin Luke the same thing when it came to John John Deere with power in a different way in Saint John chapter 1 verse 12 he says as many as believe him he had given them power to become praise the Lord now so he gave us power from things there are uh uh separated from us from things that are that are now part of us he gave us power over those things for things that are part of him he gave them power uh with those things and he he empowered him so uh that's that's what I want for us to look at so here John is saying that as many there receive him uh he have given them power to become sons of God we know the other uh we were we were sons of God but their power can be classified as the quickening power the things that Quicken us to the recognition of who we are you know uh uh you know we we have come to that recognition we have come to that reality so that's why we want to study the the difference between Power Wave and power over under the bride co-equality restored praise the Lord God has restored our co-equality through Christ Jesus amen Romans chapter 8 verse 17 says and and if children then hears hears who hears of God and John hears with Christ there's there's we we are John hears with Christ that's that is that is in their sense that our core equality is restored and uh uh so if so be that we suffer with him we that we may be glorified together for a reckon that the suffering of this present present time are now water to be compared with the glory which shall be revealing us praise the Lord amen now now uh if uh if the the the technicians back there can go to my first quote there on the seminar Church age that's what I'm reading from I want I want you to realize something here the uh as we as we read this unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him amen unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him now what I want you to notice in their statement is that you don't suffer for God you don't suffer for him you suffer with him praise the Lord amen now the uh the the Roman Church was trying to make people to suffer from God what you have to do pennies break bottle and and crawl on it and you can blade and all of that is when when we are practicing self-righteousness then we are suffering for God praise the Lord but you don't suffer for God there is no amount of penitence a man would do will ever be equal to what Jesus went through for you amen you don't suffer for God you suffer with him that's the reason why the apostles you know in the book of Acts when uh when the when the god pitted and John and he took them in and they whipped them because uh they they make the man the gate of beautiful to walk again and and he says were we listening to men or will we listen to God you know the whip them and they send them the Bible says that when rejoicing they weren't rejoicing being glad that they were partakers of his suffering okay they were partakers of his suffering you know so so so God has caught us to partake now if you are partaking with somebody praise the Lord the person is not over you or honor you amen he says he says come let us partake of this meal we are sitting there at the table and I mean your portion might be bigger than my portion it don't make you older than me amen it's just that you get more appetite than me praise the Lord Hallelujah I used to have a young young boy the one young man I was trying to help he was struggling with drugs many years ago back in the Ivory Coast and and uh you know and and I saw time to eat uh you know he will you take the food and then he would take small and leave a big portion for me I said why you do that he said because you're older than me you ordered me so you and myself should not eat the same but in reality he will eat more than I do praise the Lord I think he was doing it in a sense of respect but you see and that's that's what I want to grab your mind to this morning amen praise the Lord you know all of God's children think about this all of God's children what is God's age you know God's age how old is God what is his age have you thought of God's age don't tell me ancient of day God is she's eternity he's an internal God amen and all of God's children are in Taylor praise the Lord amen so I might have my my little daughters there and uh they're you know they receive the Lord Jesus and they are born again into the kingdom you know they are Daughters of God even though I am their father but when it comes to God and his economy we are equal that is the equality restore that's what I want to bring to your mind I'm diving in the water so I hope you get your life jacket on Amen because we are right into it when it comes to God we are equal right God don't deal with you and say say yeah you know you are the father there are certain responsibility that we cannot Overlook right amen amen yeah god holds me response responsible as a steward praise the Lord you see my position there's a difference between uh uh position and Authority praise the Lord have you ever seen the you know this bus that is that is uh you know that is because he's the manager he thinks he owns the company praise the lord it's just your position they could fire you just like they fire me you see so so those are the things that we we want to look at we want to look at we have we have a position in church the scripture places the pastor is the elder of the church amen it does not make him go first born of Good Shepherd praise the Lord the firstborn of God is the logos it's out of that logos every son and daughter of God came out of the pastor that is just his position it don't make him the firstborn it don't make him older than all the people in the church is just a position that must be respected he must respect it as much as the people should respect it are we together are you ready to dive with me in two days praise the Lord so unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him so when we Reign when we come to the place of authority is with him right now that's the reason why you will see why this statement has been an outstanding statement throughout the ages around the message brother Branham says the reason for this is the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering that's right character is a victory and not a gift praise the Lord amen just like people was every you know there was this you know respect must be earned and all of that but but yeah let's stay with this let me not get out of place here character is a victory for you to get character to be to be respected or a character over a habit a character to stand for Christ in this age it's a victory you must overcome something you must be able to fight it's not a gift it's not something that would just be handed down to you amen with our character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic that would have been the title of my sermon this morning but I wanted to keep it in context of what I want to talk about because power apart from character is devilish but Power with character is faith to rule Power Wave character is faith to root let's stop right there see uh Genesis chapter three let's let's go to Genesis chapter three I'll catch myself right here and uh we are talking about the core equality of of the Bride being restored praise the Lord we are living in an age I hear this thing I hear this thing from from from someone most of the time every time he's talking he used this statement he says uh it's a statement that is out there you yeah you hear so much about alpha male you know I'm an alpha male praise the Lord but yet all of these people claiming alpha male you know I all of these people claiming alpha male they are only claiming alpha male because the thing being the man makes them entitled to control a woman they are claiming alpha male because they think being a man you know being a man is almost like when a person think I'm the firstborn you know they think they are because I'm the firstborn so I have the right entitlement that firstborn it just come with a sense of entitlement praise the Lord amen but we will see they are scripturally God don't work like they were the firstborn or last born the way that God worked for God to be able to entrust any of his inheritance to any of his sons or children they must go on a tutor and be trained and they must be able to demonstrate a character they must be able to demonstrate a character so God in the principle of his word will put his children on the tutors you allow them to be tried to be trained and the only reason why he's doing that is because he want them to be able to get the the character because it's your character that protects your gift praise the Lord you find gift to people that don't have character praise the Lord are we together now so in in Genesis 3 15 year we will see the change of the coveting we read here from Irish and divorce the Covenant was co-equal but but now after the fall there is another Covenant now she was no longer ruler with him now so in Genesis 3 here we see uh that um [Music] verse 16 and God speaks to the woman and says unto the woman he says I will greatly multiply that sorrow and that conception in sorrow thou shall bring forth children and that desire shall be told their husband and he shall rule over thee so now the confidence was changed here the woman was placed to a place where the man will rule over the woman but now see this now as we deal with this in the subject he says but Power with character is fit to root praise the Lord now let's take this now and go to Ephesian let's go to the book of Ephesians and see how the Apostle Paul uh positionally place these things in and then we will we will see where we're going now oh praise the Lord amen you pray for the service last night praise the Lord I was counting on your prayers amen now Paul here in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 20 he we read giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father unto God and the father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourself one to another in the fear of the Lord submitting yourself one to another he's he's coming to he's coming to play some things in order but yet the Apostle Paul now is saying mean as a pastor I must submit myself to you and you as a congregation you must submit yourself to me how do we do that praise the Lord I cannot take my position as a pastor it's just a position I must know that I'm accountable to you that is the way that you submit myself I must know that you have a right to ask me any question praise the Lord my position don't give me the right to live in a house and says that nobody can ask me any question right it does not give me the right to preach anything it says well don't I'm going to preach it don't ask me any question hey don't give me that right are we together now so he's he's going to say yeah submit yourself one unto another glory be to God and uh this is uh this is uh you know the the wonderful scripture that we all like it's a wedding scripture you like to hear this during the wedding they are all smiling on their faces when is the wedding time wife submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body are we together now so Paul Paul year is is going to place an order he's going to place uh uh and and other of sequence if I if I would say it like that and you will understand me anyway as I will as I will explain myself here he's going to place Christ as the head of the man and the man as the head of the woman praise the Lord the woman as the head of the home praise the Lord now so you will see here if power with character is fit to rule it will be at the place where the other even though the man that with the change of the Covenant year now the man the uh God is saying that your your desire will be to your husband and he will have the rule over you it's it is not because he's born as a male it's not because he's he's and he's a male that that that uh that that that gives him that right you you have to realize here is that it's a word of God it's something that God is expecting for the man to be able to demonstrate and what is that if we must submit ourselves what onto another what a man must be able to demonstrate to have that thing to work is for him to submit himself to his head which is Christ amen for you to have that to work I mean you can print it as a big import letter and stick it right on the wall you know while the members have the root it does not work that way so you see what I'm saying is something that God placed in his word this is the word of God this is not just uh uh human expression it's not it's not man's mind now if God is changing the Covenant from from a place of code equal and now he's placing a man to the place here where he's going to rule over this woman he is it's not by it's not by the way that his parents brought him up it's not by his acne where neither his National way and all it has to be by the word of God right man are we together now so we see here that character is a victory it's not a gift and a man with our character can reign because power apart from character is satanic and that's why we have the word that the way that we have today remain one man can sit down in Russia and and blow the whole place up because he thinks that you know I'm I'm the one in charge here I give a command even if you don't do it we fire you praise the Lord and and yeah that is that is that is a power without character that is power with our character but Power with character the way it rules is that it includes out of his subjects power with character include out of its subjects you see that's the reason why for God to rule to become Lord over us he has to include us by the new birth praise the Lord he has to include us by the new birth because if we are now born again there is no way the world can root over us we will we will struggle constantly so God has to include us into his nature by the new birth praise the Lord now so we're talking about here the bride called equality restore power weight versus power over I'm giving power over demons I'm not giving power over you I don't have power over you amen I have power with you that's the reason why the Billet cannot persecute and heal it that's the reason why the bride will not rule over a bride are we together so a man with five character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to root and since he want us to share to share he want us to share he that overcome will sit with me in my throne no he not that he that all that come would come he would sit down I'll put my feet over him when you overcome you will sit down under my throne and I will sit on top of you no you will sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and I sat down with the father in his throne when God rules his people he share his power with them he don't enslave us God only slave his children right he empowered them that's the reason why by the law no flesh shall be justified God don't enslave his people he empowers them how we give you power when Holy Ghost shall come he Empower his people we keep locking ourselves as all pitiful sinners that's the reason why we just sit in church and gesture other preacher we can never rejoice in the word when a word is here to empower you you're just staring at me and where is he going praise the Lord I'm not afraid of your faces I'm going to preach anyhow amen [Music] I expect you to rejoice in the word to be glad that God is sharing his power with you and that makes you an overcomer praise the Lord that makes you an overcomer for you to know that God is sharing his power with you he's bringing you into an inclusive read an inclusive ring he's your lord and your God but yet he's getting you involved that's the reason why he could list him say he could get a better idea from Moses he could get a better idea from Moses and Moses says when you when you kill all these people why you expect the Nations to say that we serve the one that enslaved us amen your church denomination have enslaved you your religious ideas have enslaved you but he that the son has set free are there people that are free here have the sun sets you free have the sun sets you free you must be free today praise the Lord you mean you free you can't even clap your hands a chain Bound in your hands and you can't even clap your hands my goodness that devil is so bad he's so wicked he has enslaved our so much now to even rejoice in what God has really given to how we struggle praise the Lord just like Johnny Crow joining Crow being Thai now he's free he can't go anywhere he just around the tree because that's the only Destiny he could go and that's the same thing that you are doing praise the Lord praise the Lord before I forget uh this this coming weekend we have brother Brooks coming you have to realize that we normally have our Thanksgiving we can service before the weekend of Thanksgiving so brother Brooks will be here brother Andrews that was with us on on Wednesday night we had a wonderful service praise the Lord you enjoy the service yeah it was wonderful let's give the Lord a hint of praise amen thank you right God can only bless you if you learn to take an attitude of appreciation amen take an attitude of appreciation and how to appreciate God Just Praise Him clap your hands that's all praise the Lord amen we don't have to beg you to clap your hands we have to teach you how to you take one hand and the other one and you knock it together [Applause] praise the Lord no it's a simple principle of blessing you really want to enjoy God learn to appreciate him learn to appreciate him you want to enjoy the service just forget about all the troubles that the devil is causing for you just learn to appreciate God say Amen to the word clap your hands raise your hand or say thank you Jesus before you realize you'll be in a complete different world praise the Lord so brother brother Isaiah Brooks from Iowa will be here uh I mean it's it's been uh how many years now almost we here myself was talking about this it's almost five years since the last time he was here and he's just three hours away I can't blame him because it's almost the same time I have not been down there too so praise the Lord so uh he's supposed to be traveling to Liberia after the the Thanksgiving to do some special services for brother Elijah so we had to help her arrange his uh his Visa so then I use that as a special special area of to have him come and speak for us so he and his wife should be yelled uh next weekend Saturday I think brother Jordan get a lot of the Flyers out there praise the Lord and we pick those things up I don't know where we put them it looks like we just pick it up we look at it and then just trash it away and then forget that there was service on a weekend praise the Lord so we'll be having service uh Saturday evening Sunday morning with brother Brooks and try to see if I can close this service in a good time if the sinking group can stay over let's let's do a practice if you have the time if you have to go that's fine and let's let's just do a practice so we can be able to sing a song or two on the coming weekend praise the Lord now finish talking this I got to get back into my preaching mode again amen I gotta get back into my preaching wall should we stand for the reading of the word or we have already read the word okay thank you uh praise the Lord I trust the Lord here let me use a very simple principle can you uh Port mine my five kingdoms there are five kingdoms in this word that we lay we have five kingdoms there are five kingdoms you have the kingdom of God you have the human Kingdom you have the animal kingdom you have the plains Kingdom and you have the mineral Kingdom praise the Lord and God has put boundaries between these kingdoms amen God have post boundaries if men are trying to break there to go and become an animal um but God has put boundary the way for him to differentiate us between the animal he gave us soul and animals do not have a soul so God has put boundaries glory be to God he kept the mineral Kingdom Under the Earth praise the Lord he kept the meaning of Kingdom Under the Earth now a principle here that I want to show you uh for us to be able to to appreciate the subject here is the other the minerals kingdom is is under the Earth okay and uh the only way that the plain Kingdom can be able to to uh to share a throne or share a ruling with the mineral Kingdom is that the planes have to extend their roots down into the Earth to be able to draw the mineral up praise the Lord all the the proteins in in all of those uh uh minerals the plants have to stretch their Roots down into the Earth and they have to to gather the the minerals and and and you know and pull them up to their level praise the Lord amen and for the animal kingdom to also benefit from the minerals of the Earth and uh the plant kingdom they have to also go down and eat the grass and eat the plants to be able to bring the mineral Kingdom and the plain Kingdom to the same level so you see there is always a condescending amen the planes have to condescend they have to stretch their Roots down to be able to bring the mineral up to draw the mineral out of the Earth the animals have to go down and eat the grass and eat the trees and eat the leaves and all of that praise the Lord glory be to God and we ourselves we have to condescend to the Animal Kingdom something Have To Die For Something To Live praise the Lord amen I mean I mean you wish everywhere you choose even if you say you are a vegetarian you I mean you you are just jumping over the animal kingdom and going down to the to the to the leaves what are you are a vegetarian or whichever choice you you gotta go down to something to be able to get your vitamins and whatever you want to get but you see it's a law it's a law and God placed their Lobby there is no way you can just stay as a human and a very intelligent human there is no way you can stay as an intelligent human for you to benefit from the minerals that are in the Earth you will have to go down praise the Lord whether they were processing and put it important for you to suck or drink or take as pills and taking my vitamins they have to come from the Earth someone has to reach down and bring it off from the Earth praise the Lord amen now here is man here he's so smart and he thinks that he's powerful he can go to the Gene and build his muscles and build his arms and all of that praise the Lord and with all of his intelligence he don't realize that the vati means that he needs to keep his brain together come from a kingdom that is lower than him to despise thy kingdom is death praise the Lord Amen to despise thy kingdom that lower kingdom is death you see the sense of co-equalness a law that God placed in the Earth to make you as equal with the mineral Kingdom even though his honor the Earth is not visible praise the Lord amen all you see it looks like a grass behind this grass that's growing there take the machine the morning and all of that all you see it as a forest but uh uh it looks like it's a I mean It's a Grind it's just a Green Feed and all of that praise the Lord but when you when you get that stick on your table and you're eating and you cutting it and you lick in your mouth is that grass there are green grass that had just transformed looking red before you praise the Lord it's a law that God placed for you to despise one is to eliminate yourself Hallelujah for the animal kingdom to come up to the human Kingdom it has to die praise the Lord for the human Kingdom to come up to the kingdom of God he has to die and be born again [Applause] he has to die and be born again but I asked you just remain a church member right you become a religious human being in a human Kingdom that have a knowledge of God but can never step up in their reign of righteousness and Holiness because you are not born again you have to die and be born again for you to step up into the kingdom of God Jesus said no man can see the kingdom of God except he is born again just life for the animal kingdom to come up to the human Kingdom it has to die and be watch fry or gray whichever way you do it whichever way you do it but that's the way that the animal kingdom come up the plain Kingdom you gotta wash it you gotta board it you gotta slash it you got to contact whichever way you do it praise the Lord show me your power show me your power show me your muscles amen I'll tell you how much leaves you need to eat so you see this alone of God the way that God almighty God exercised his power is inclusive let's just read it a little bit me trying to close up here before I lose time attitude and who is god well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know the authority I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost born men doesn't realize the authority The Authority that God has permitted in his church I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom whatsoever you bound on Earth what an authority amen what an authority you see sin has affected us so much that when we see these things we always apply them in the negative way that's the reason why this scripture is only used when there is problem in the church I will bound you but he said whatsoever whatsoever you can bound a sickness you can bound a habit you can also also bound your family to stay together yeah that's right whatsoever [Music] there's a bounding power whatsoever you're born on the Earth will be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on Earth will be loose I give you power over serpent sin and over over over over is not part of you whatever you have power over is not part of you if it is part of you you have power away [Music] glory be to God that's the reason why people we read and listen to brother Brandon message with an intellectual mind and most of the time we just read and listen to it to to equip ourselves or make ourselves smarter than the other person but these are the Divine word of God this is the mind of God these are the things that were in the back part of God's mind to free you praise the Lord amen the child must never be afraid of their parents no they might never be afraid I mean a a wife and a husband it must never be even in a natural life that's the way that God that's the way that God set it up if the home right leg comes under the law of God and that home is governed by God praise the Lord oh there must be laughter there must be laughter and uh I mean and and enjoy it and and you know that I mean that that's that's the way that God set it up praise the Lord that's the reason why the people must not have one one one life one they get their Church life and they get their Wally life praise the Lord and we're going to the house of God praise the Lord that's the reason why the Holy Ghost will call you a hypocrite when they behave like yes praise the Lord oh yeah because you must be a Child In God's Presence amen you must be a child and you must express yourself as a child if you have to shout and say Amen say Amen if you have to cry in God's present Cry In God's Presence Hallelujah you must be a child that's that's the present of your father you must be able to express yourself as a child I'm afraid that the church doesn't know the authority we think that our our Authority is one group over another group amen we are the old-timers you are the youngest God don't run his his kingdom like that he don't run his kingdom like that brother Branham says as sinner off the street walk into this building this morning and give his heart to God the prophet of God said he's on the very same right then you'd have been sitting here all of these years and the word of God can never move you that's right praise the Lord mm-hmm the church doesn't know the authority and I'm afraid holy ghost man doesn't realize the authority The Authority that God has permitted to his church I give you the keys whatsoever you bound on the earth is bound whatsoever you lose this loose I give you power over serpents and over all kinds of diseases that's where you must exercise your power you get power deal without anger in you that that way you should exercise your power praise the Lord amen take out the belt and whip that lustful Spirit to go take out the belt say anger come up here glory be to God amen amen when you know that you can lie you ready to talk to a child about lying you lying to me you lying to me praise yourself I mean when you're you you're saying that just be thinking about yourself you lying to me because I'm a liar you are lying to me because I'm alive glory be to God that's why you must exercise to your power power over diseases he has given you power over his flesh the New Birth has given you power over this flesh praise the Lord amen Whenever there is a string shall desire or nature sprinking up thy man in you that man of faith in you must say you are a stranger you don't belong here get out of this house [Applause] brother Brown says exercise your fate Let it Loose let God have his will God will grant it to you exercise your faith take your Authority yeah over the things that don't belong in this house you have the right to kick them out praise the Lord if they were not listening then you can give them a warrant and say I'm going to call the enforcing agent and ain't forcing agent is the Holy Ghost you get that I said God this is not a nature of you [Music] [Applause] the difference between power over Empower with God give you power with him [Music] praise the Lord that's why he told Adam I gave you dominion over the Earth he has power over the Earth but Power with God you know man let me show you the weakness of the church by the grace of God I gave you power all over and clean spirit you have power over unclean Spirit you have power over fearful thoughts praise the Lord you have to exercise that power praise the Lord you have to exercise that power don't make cockroach and rats stop making you afraid you are just filled with so much fear when Cricket starts to make noise then you say it's devil the demons are here you're just full of fear just fill with fear praise the Lord little creature I see you is even running away but yet you are afraid it's even running away because they have seen you but you are more afraid than that creature it's trying to find his way out and you trying to break the house down jump on the table let's cancel everything let me show you the weakness of the church by the grace of God I give you power over unclean spirit you will cast them out not our will not our will Jesus said I've given you power over unclean spirits for you to cast him out praise the Lord amen that was one of the that was one of the the the the trouble if you know the uh uh Ray boss he was one former gospel musician that struggle out of his life with a homosexual thinking in his life he struggled with that and he sang a song and when he testified on that on that song he says he just thought they had a you know with everything that he he learned in this church and was preached told when you have something you should just come to the altar you know people come to the Altar for auto call you know and and all of that you and and that is the thing that that is just that is just a kind of for religious spirit you know people just can't they see people coming to the altar they just come to the author with no determination you know they don't even identify why they're coming to the Altar for praise the Lord and it just come and then as a scene of prayer is saying I received I received Jesus uh the Lord said I'm the Lord Savior and then and then go and sit down back you are not a child that is born yet praise the Lord that's what the father looks for a son that is interested in protecting his inheritance that's what the father looks for you are his inheritance you must take interest in protecting yourself praise the Lord that's why the father take interest in that's what he looks for when he finds a son that has interest in watching over the father inheritance glory be to God so he came and he said he says I will come to the Altar and then I will leave from there but nothing changed is because you are not making effort for it to be changed praise the Lord if you praying against it and it cannot change get another person and I suppose that devil and say I'm tired with this thing I'm tired I'm tired with it that's not me and I don't want it to be me Jesus there in the in in uh Saint John chapter 13. every time we read it every time we read it for communion Jesus says Satan has no part with me he told Peter he says if I don't watch you amen if I don't watch you you don't have no path with me praise the Lord that's the reason why he have power over Satan because Satan don't have no path with him that's the reason why he gave us power over the devil because the devil don't have no path with him but as his children he gave us Power Wave with him praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the difference between a kingdom root and uh uh a democratic roof praise the Lord amen honor a democratic rule you have uh uh uh divided powers so the man is dead he's not uh he's I mean he's dead you don't like him even though he's depressed you're just waiting for that four years six years to reach I'm going to cast my vote will get rid of him but you see honor a kingdom ruled unless he's a weaker King and if he said Wiki King he don't last long but what makes the kingdom rule powerful because it's an inclusive it has to be an inclusive rule that's the reason why Jesus always speak about the kingdom of God God deal with his people now on a democratic rule divided powers in the church no it's honor a kingdom principle honor a kingdom principle is with inclusive he included Us by the new birth he brought us to the right not our servants not our servants oh yeah you use that you know I'm a servant of God that is that is that is just uh uh a title of our service because that's what we must do it's part of our duty to serve one another praise the Lord to save one another a child must never must never feel awkward to be able to save their parents praise the Lord are we together the same thing with her parent now let's just take something here now I realize I just have few minutes I will try to close here wash dish Now with uh with with God dealing with Jacob and see what's happening here Israel in the church now watch he touched his time and Jacob walked different amen I hope that goes way down home when you rise up with God you will walk different praise the Lord you will walk different will not only affect your walk it will affect your mind it will affect your desire it will affect your entire life praise the Lord hear us out with God he walked different on the other side that little river he was a strong great man that backslaughter he knew how to cheat praise the Lord but this one he will not cheat God knew where to get him praise the Lord and I've gone knows where to get you he knows where to get you he knows where to touch you praise the Lord amen he knows where to get you praise the Lord and whether you like it or not if his love is upon you he will touch that spot amen one thing you can do to avoid is to just surround him he was a strong Red Man backslider go away from God running from his brother running from God on the other side of the Brooks he was a leaping Prince the scripture says Thou Are a prince of God for you have power with God look in the scripture that's how God told Jacob you have power with God as a leaping Prince something happened to him God brought him God adopted him he was a stubborn boy trying to have his own way run his own life won't listen to anybody praise the Lord but because God law was upon him God adopted God had to do something special to bring him back in line I said now you have power with God amen praise the Lord now you have power with God perfect strength perfect weakness rather all Jacob hell on all night he sure did hold on a little longer but when he surrounded himself when he got weak and couldn't hold no longer oh God let the church get Let the church get like that the church get to a place where it can hold no longer with the with the natural habilitation but has to give over to God it was then that Jacob become a prince of God the Bible said he become a prince and his name was changed remember he was a great strong man on the other side intellectual powerful but on the other side he was a living Prince weak and worn down but her power before God oh God praise the Lord oh that's the reason why I appreciate one brother but Andrew said on Wednesday night your faith is stronger than your weakness your faith is stronger than your sickness but it's an element that you don't see that's the reason why you don't put emphasis on it emphasis to the one that you see that battle your mind and and bother you all the trouble but you don't put emphasis you don't nourish their faith praise the Lord he has power with God it was then Jacob uh become a prince the Bible says his name was changed he had power before God you may be in an Old Fashioned car from then on in the neighborhood that might be right but I'll tell you you will have power with God I'd rather be like that amen have power with God praise the Lord so you see it even our lord Jesus the god of Heaven and Earth like the prophet of God will say God made Man In His Image and when man fell God how to become man to restore men back it's a principle is a principle it's inclusive power almighty God you think about it he's the Creator May Fail he who have just speak and make man back in his even know what he did he stepped down he took on his robe he became man to bring you back up to God to bring you back up to God that's what makes him powerful because he can do that man in his Fallen nature with his number of days just give him power once and see what he will do just give him power trust him just for one day praise the Lord Hallelujah he stepped down he came down born into a cradle born into a sheep band to identify with whatever state of life that you are born in choose the law of place to be born praise the Lord even though some of us might have been born at home but our home was much decent than the band that he was born in praise the Lord some were born in very beautiful hospitals were taken care of but it was sheeps cows that witnessed his birth they were the first voices he heard when people were looking at your babies oh that's a pretty baby ready all he was hearing was nah nah but it was to empower you it was to empower you praise the Lord that shows how much powerful you are when you can humble yourself you can humble yourself but you never choose to work exclusively praise the Lord you have these people that have this private Christian Life their Christian Life that private is that church I go to work yeah nobody know my life praise the Lord and in a way they think they are powerful they think they are smart you need help you just need help because you don't have it under control that person don't have it under control you are just looking over your shoulder all the time right all power in heaven and Earth came to me all power and all that was given to him on the days of Pentecost he poured down into the church you shall receive the Holy Ghost in power that's why he told them what is the Holy Ghost given for to empower how God's work that's the reason why when God raised up men in the ages he empowered them so much that the people look up to them Moses lifting up his raw before the Red Sea and the Sea backing up people say wow wow Joshua doing the same something picking up the kids of the Philistine on his shoulder why God does that it's not because of the man it's for the people to believe the gift that he sent to lead him it's not the man it's the gift praise the Lord Hallelujah great man that died they will always want the world to benefit from their knowledge men that have died with all the Aesthetics and Secret I never remember yeah I never remember we are buried with all of their knowledge but a simple man that makes a light bulb amen praise the Lord what have he done he have empowered the word now we go into LED and Men I improve it on that wisdom we improving on that knowledge we can clap our hands the light can come on he will never be forgetting that's God's principle he created the whole word and what he did he made a man in His image praise the Lord someone was training someone and I I accident I said are you making a man in your image he got caught in the thought I think thousands of thoughts went through his mind he says I love that I said that's the only way you will be successful that's the only way you will be successful if you can make a man in your image when you are absent nobody miss you because you are being able to empower than that yes sir yes praise the Lord amen that's why we don't have to bring a a ball to a year and say this is our God and our God our God is invisible but he has empowered the church he has empowered the church we don't have to make an idol Our God and bring people to him he has empowered by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can say we have a living God because he have healed the sake he has raised the dead and he's moving among his people he has empowered us we can break on his name we can challenge the devil this morning praise the Lord because God Empower his people praise the Lord that's why he told the disciples a little while I will be with you and you shall see me no more they were all being sorry for Lord where are you going where are you going now you will not be with us you see about the comforter we come the comforter we come and I will never leave you I will never forsake you that's the way that God empowered his people that's how he Empower his people so he gave us power with him power with one another oh yeah we can become a powerful group of people if we can just dedicate our our hearts to the cost of lifting up the name of Jesus just lifting up the name of Jesus if you can dedicate ourselves to that cross we can become a powerful group of people praise the Lord amen that's what an invincible Army is it's a small group of people that are united to the cause your heart is dedicated to see God on the scene God moving among the people praise the Lord hallelujah we don't have to look for secret agents and send them around the community say see why that brother is going see what our sister is doing we believe in the Holy Ghost that the Holy Ghost can expose you from behind this pulpit praise the Lord amen why because we have people who are dedicated to see God moving on the scene and Hallelujah God just need one man or one woman in his hand that's all he needs to make his power be seen yes that's the difference between power we have power with God we have power over demons we have power over sickness God will give you power over your family you must have power with your family yes praise the Lord you need that support system to become a successful leader yes you must have Power Wave it must be an inclusive routing the bride call equal ity has been restored why because he has lifted us up he has opened the mysteries of God he has lose the mind of Jesus Christ to the church that's what she needs to be co-equal with God she don't need a bill uh a cathedral what she leaves is the word may flesh him on her musicians you can come we will continue okay when he reached down his hands for me let's sing there while we pray to you [Music] foreign to be able to pick us up that God will lift us up from our falling state he would take us
