[32:26] uh by the grace of God, uh I believe
[32:29] that the Lord
[32:31] has has blessed us as u as a church and
[32:37] uh if
[32:39] uh if we would just stay with the
[32:43] word, dedicate our own personal
[32:47] life, I believe there is more that the
[32:49] Lord would do in our midst.
[32:52] Amen. We have
[32:54] uh a praying group of
[32:57] people, people that
[33:00] uh are praying uh setting themselves
[33:04] aside,
[33:05] praying for the needs around this church
[33:08] and praying to see more of God.
[33:11] Last week
[33:13] uh
[33:17] uh I received this text from one of the
[33:20] saints of uh of the church
[33:23] here and it just it just set my heart to
[33:27] pray. God bless
[33:31] you. Please, it has been laid on my
[33:33] heart to tell you to pray against
[33:36] uh a tragic
[33:39] loss. Have a peaceful
[33:42] day and uh uh thank
[33:46] you and you know especially when you
[33:50] know
[33:52] uh how God deals with some of the people
[33:56] around you, you don't take those things
[33:58] very lightly. So my heart was really
[34:01] really in prayer uh last
[34:03] week and we just want to thank the Lord
[34:06] for bringing us uh through the different
[34:11] the different uh experiences that we had
[34:14] last week. Uh brother Steve Cassie was
[34:17] not well and few of the saints have not
[34:19] been well. Sister Jenny and just the
[34:21] rest of
[34:23] them and then we've just different
[34:25] things. We just kept our heart praying
[34:28] and trusting the
[34:29] Lord. And
[34:34] uh so I think uh the service on Sunday,
[34:37] most especially the prayer meeting
[34:39] Sunday evening, the communion service
[34:41] was was just really a blessing. I thank
[34:43] the Lord for that.
[34:45] But then uh
[34:48] uh Monday morning
[34:50] [Music]
[34:53] uh sister Jenny receive a call that her
[34:57] mother passed away. Her mother not been
[35:00] well for a while now. So, uh, but, uh,
[35:05] uh, I heard that on on Sunday,
[35:09] uh, that, uh, they had to rush her mom
[35:11] to the hospital. And
[35:14] uh so we want to we want to pray for for
[35:18] all the the girls and the entire
[35:21] Peterson family that the Lord will just
[35:24] strengthen them and uh uh we want to
[35:30] remember them. We have a prayer need
[35:33] here. Uh please keep me in prayer. I
[35:37] will be going to see the doctor on
[35:39] Friday morning to get uh uh an echo
[35:45] cardiogram done so the doctor can get a
[35:48] better look at something they saw on the
[35:51] left side of my heart and that's from
[35:54] Sister Kelly. So we want to bring that
[35:56] knee before the Lord
[35:58] tonight and uh Sister Fatu will also be
[36:02] going in to see the doctor tomorrow. We
[36:05] want to remember her that the Lord will
[36:09] will
[36:11] uh will be with her through the
[36:15] procedure. Uh Shalom says, "Please pray
[36:18] for my mom, my dad, and my sister who
[36:22] have pains in their legs and body that
[36:26] the almighty God will heal them." That's
[36:28] from sister Dawas. And uh we want to
[36:33] remember them too. Sister Joy called in
[36:36] uh uh this evening and ask that we pray
[36:38] for her. She will be serving. Sister
[36:41] Bridget also not feeling well and uh she
[36:44] want us to also keep her in prayer. Uh
[36:49] uh and keep her entire family in prayer
[36:53] as well. Let's just bow our hearts to
[36:55] the Lord and
[36:57] uh we we just first want to bring thanks
[37:00] to to him tonight. We pray together and
[37:04] just appreciate the Lord for his
[37:06] goodness, his mercy, and the way that
[37:09] he's dealing with us. I mean
[37:13] uh sometimes um the Lord would deal with
[37:17] some of the saints in dreams and I mean
[37:19] things they would tell me and you would
[37:22] just see it just happening and I I just
[37:26] believe that the Lord have his hands
[37:28] upon us as a church and just wanting us
[37:32] to draw closer to him as he draw us
[37:35] closer to him. Let's pray together as we
[37:38] give thanks tonight. Heavenly Father, we

[45:21] 9. Daniel chapter 9.
[45:34] couple of weeks back or Wednesdays back,
[45:36] we were talking on uh Messiah the
[45:40] prince and I and I want to uh go back to
[45:44] that line of thought, but we will speak
[45:48] on something different tonight title a
[45:51] little bit different.
[45:59] Daniel chapter
[46:07] 9. Praise the Lord.
[46:16] in the first year of Dyrus, the son of
[46:21] Heseras, of the seed of uh
[46:24] Media, which was made king over the
[46:28] reign of the
[46:30] Cheddians in the first year of his
[46:32] reign.
[46:34] Ad
[46:36] understood by books.
[46:39] I Daniel understood by books. We title
[46:43] what we speaking on tonight understood
[46:46] by books. I Daniel understood by books
[46:49] the number of the year where of the the
[46:53] word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[46:56] prophet that he who accomplished 70
[47:01] years in the desolation of
[47:03] Jerusalem. And I set my
[47:06] face unto the Lord God to seek by
[47:11] prayer and supplication. I set my face
[47:16] unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and
[47:20] supplication and
[47:22] fasting and sight and arches. And I
[47:25] prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my
[47:29] confession, and said, Oh Lord, the the
[47:33] great and dreadful God, keeping the
[47:36] covenant and mercy to them that love him
[47:39] and to them that keep his commandment.
[47:42] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[47:44] seat. I prayed unto the Lord as we
[47:47] continue to read, the Lord my God, and I
[47:50] made my confession. I believe that uh I
[47:53] believe that uh uh I mean uh uh we
[47:57] cannot make prayers unto the Lord
[47:58] without making confession. Amen. No
[48:01] matter how much we prayed, we must be
[48:04] able to to just make our confession.
[48:08] Tell the Lord how we feeling in our
[48:09] heart and the things that we are dealing
[48:11] with and the places where we need his
[48:14] help. Amen. We must make confession unto
[48:17] the Lord.
[48:18] Daniel said, "I made my confession and
[48:22] said, 'Lord, oh Lord, the the the great
[48:26] and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
[48:29] and uh mercy to them that love him and
[48:32] to them that keep his commandment. We
[48:36] have sinned and have committed iniquity
[48:39] and have done wickedly and have rebelled
[48:43] even by departing from thy precept and
[48:47] from and from thy judgment. Now you have
[48:49] to realize here that this was the this
[48:53] was the Daniel that said he would not
[48:55] defile himself with uh the things of the
[48:58] Babylonian. But you see when he comes to
[49:01] prayer he didn't say Lord the people out
[49:03] there have backslided the people out of
[49:06] No. He joined himself to the rest of the
[49:09] group. Amen. He said we have sinned.
[49:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. He didn't say oh
[49:14] Lord all my people they are backsla they
[49:16] are worshiping the image of Nebuchinne.
[49:19] Lord God is just only men and Shedra
[49:21] Mishad and Ben that are standing in this
[49:23] hour. We really need you. No he's
[49:25] standing for the people. Amen. Praise
[49:28] the Lord. He said, "We have sinned. We
[49:30] have committed iniquity. We have done
[49:32] wickedly. We have rebelled even by
[49:35] departing from thy precept and from thy
[49:38] judgment. Neither have we hearkening
[49:40] unto thy servants the prophets. We speak
[49:43] in thy name to our kings and our princes
[49:46] and and our fathers and to all the
[49:49] people of the land. Oh Lord,
[49:52] righteousness belongth unto thee, but
[49:55] unto us confusion of faces. Amen. I just
[50:00] believe that's where we are. Praise the
[50:02] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. I just
[50:05] believe that where we are uh right now
[50:08] as a nation, confusion of faces.
[50:12] uh as are the
[50:14] days of the men of Judah and to the
[50:17] inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all
[50:19] Israel that are that are neared and that
[50:23] are far off through all the countries
[50:27] where thou has driven them because of
[50:30] their trespasses that they have
[50:33] trespassed against thee. Oh Lord, to us
[50:37] belongeth confusion of faces. to our
[50:39] kings, to our princes, to our fathers
[50:41] because we have sinned against thee.
[50:44] Praise the Lord. And we can go on and on
[50:47] and on. But I I just want to take a
[50:49] little talk there from uh uh the verse
[50:51] two in the first uh year of his reign. A
[50:55] Daniel understood by books. And these
[50:59] books that he was talking about were the
[51:01] letters of Jeremiah where Jeremiah wrote
[51:05] concerning these things that uh that
[51:07] Israel was going through. You read over
[51:10] there in uh Jeremiah chapter 29:10. For
[51:14] thus say the
[51:15] Lord that after 70 years be accomplished
[51:19] at Babylon, I will visit you and perform
[51:22] my good works towards you in causing you
[51:24] to return. So Daniel year was looking
[51:28] into Jeremiah prophecy. He was looking
[51:30] because I mean these things were said
[51:32] when he was a young man. He heard it in
[51:34] church. Now year said they are over
[51:36] there in captivity. He's uh he's feeling
[51:40] the burden to go back and read
[51:42] everything that Jeremiah have said.
[51:44] Amen.
[51:46] Now what I want us to see this evening
[51:49] is that when we were talking about uh uh
[51:53] uh Messiah the prince, we were
[51:56] identifying the prince of Persia that
[51:58] was waring against Daniel. And then uh
[52:03] uh uh then also we we identified uh uh
[52:08] trying to handle because Daniel is
[52:10] praying and asking God for understanding
[52:13] and asking God, you know, to to make him
[52:16] to understand the time, you know, how
[52:18] how long are we going to be in
[52:20] captivity? How many years is left in all
[52:23] of these things? He's asking the Lord
[52:25] and and and waiting on God to give him
[52:28] understanding. But here is it said that
[52:30] that that there were demon powers that
[52:33] are called the prince of Pesure, the
[52:36] spirit of the land was trying to hinder
[52:38] Daniel from understanding these things.
[52:42] Praise the Lord. Amen. That's where our
[52:45] our thoughts are tonight for us to be
[52:47] able to understand the walls that are
[52:49] around us. Praise the Lord. Amen. And
[52:52] the things that we are asking the Lord
[52:54] for, the things we are believing for,
[52:56] the things we are looking up to for
[52:58] there, we we have we have an enemy that
[53:01] is waring against us. Praise the Lord.
[53:03] We have an enemy that that that that
[53:05] don't want us to enjoy the joy of our
[53:07] salvation, that don't want us to to to
[53:10] to enjoy the reality of the word. Here
[53:13] is Daniel setting out his heart. And now
[53:16] these powers were hindering him. That's
[53:18] what I want us to see in uh in the
[53:20] thought here tonight. These evil spirits
[53:23] were henrying his request and then God
[53:26] now also sending a backup. Praise the
[53:29] Lord. Amen. Paul said the weapons of our
[53:32] warfare are not canon. Praise the Lord.
[53:36] It's a pouring down of
[53:38] stronghold. It's a pouring down. You
[53:40] have to pull down strong power, strong
[53:43] influence or else I'm telling you,
[53:45] you're not going to enjoy this word. You
[53:48] are not going to enjoy the blessing of
[53:50] salvation. Praise the
[53:52] Lord. Hallelujah.
[53:55] Amen. So, here is him here pouring out
[53:59] his
[53:59] heart, trying to read through the
[54:03] letters of Jeremiah, reading through the
[54:05] prophecy. Lord, give me understanding.
[54:09] And I'm telling you, the times that we
[54:11] are living in is right in this book.
[54:13] Amen. If you want to understand the
[54:16] times, you got to get down in this book
[54:18] on your knees.
[54:21] Praise the Lord. Don't read it like a
[54:25] lecturer. You got to read it praying
[54:28] Lord bless your word to my heart.
[54:32] Amen. Give me
[54:34] understanding. Are we together? That's
[54:37] what we want to look at tonight. So we
[54:40] we just in uh uh title our thought
[54:43] tonight understood by books. Listen to
[54:46] what uh uh brother Brand said. I I
[54:48] picked that up. listen to a tape today.
[54:50] He said, "A man
[54:53] uh the identification of Christ in all
[54:55] ages, a man is
[54:58] known, a man is knows he comes from the
[55:04] beyond. And a
[55:07] dark shallower curtains that hang
[55:12] between him and where he was before he
[55:15] comes here. And he know he must go
[55:20] beyond that
[55:22] curtain. And he is always wanting to
[55:26] know where he comes from, what he is and
[55:30] where he is
[55:33] going. We have millions of
[55:38] volumes that's been wrote as opposed on
[55:42] the
[55:43] subject. But there is only one
[55:48] book. There are 66 volume in it that can
[55:53] tell you where you come from, who you
[55:56] are, where you are going. And that is
[56:00] the Bible. Praise the Lord. Amen. You
[56:04] see uh uh uh uh uh uh many people will
[56:08] think that the Bible is just a history
[56:11] of uh of of the Jews or the history of
[56:14] Babylon, a history of Egypt and and all
[56:17] of those different names that is but but
[56:20] this is the word of God. It's a book of
[56:23] prophecy. Praise the Lord. Because the
[56:26] very times that we are living in right
[56:28] now, the very times we are living in,
[56:31] the things that are happening around the
[56:33] world, the things that are happening
[56:35] right in in the nation where we find
[56:38] ourself are written right in the line of
[56:40] scripture. Are we together?
[56:43] Amen.
[56:45] If you if you
[56:48] remember if you remember
[56:51] uh some time
[56:54] ago, we look at some uh scriptures there
[56:57] over in uh uh Jeremiah or Ezekiel where
[57:02] the Bible talks about the three things
[57:05] that God whiffs the nation with is
[57:08] either farming, swore or
[57:12] pestilence. Amen. These are God three
[57:15] whips that he whipped the nation with.
[57:18] It's either farming, swore, or
[57:20] pestilence. Now, pestilence is
[57:22] sicknesses, diseases, farming, shortage
[57:25] of food, you know, uh drought and all of
[57:27] that, and swore is war. Are we together?
[57:32] Now, if you look in Revelation when the
[57:35] Bible talks about the uh uh uh you know,
[57:38] at the opening of the seals, the the the
[57:40] the the horses that came out and uh uh
[57:44] the
[57:45] white, the red, and the black. Praise
[57:48] the Lord. You'll realize that each one
[57:51] of those were powers and and you know,
[57:54] and they are identified. I'm not
[57:56] dwelling on that. I just want to grab uh
[57:58] using that as a bit to grab your
[58:00] attention tonight. And uh but you will
[58:03] see that the uh all of those things
[58:07] there are three
[58:08] powers there are three
[58:11] powers that were going to that God's
[58:15] people will have dealt with throughout
[58:18] the church
[58:19] ages. And these three powers were going
[58:22] to be political
[58:26] power. Are we together?
[58:30] There were going to be religious
[58:33] power, political
[58:35] power and also economical
[58:40] power. Praise the Lord.
[58:43] Amen. So if you look at uh the the the
[58:48] first horse rather, you will see he had
[58:52] h a bow but no
[58:54] arrow. He was running with a religious
[58:58] spirit.
[59:00] And with that religious spirit, he were
[59:03] killing the people
[59:05] spiritually. It was spiritual
[59:08] death. Are we together? Amen. Now when
[59:13] you look through the next house rather,
[59:16] you will see where uh the Bible says
[59:19] that uh uh uh uh uh uh he will touch he
[59:24] were told not to touch the oil and the
[59:25] wine. you know uh uh uh a ballot for a
[59:29] penny. Are we together? So you will see
[59:33] that right in that time also it became
[59:38] more like uh like a like a a kind of a
[59:41] economical thing that was going
[59:43] on. Are we together now? But when you
[59:47] come to the fourth horse rather, the
[59:50] fourth horse rather had the merging of
[59:53] the three horse rather spirits. So both
[59:57] the political, the religious and the
[59:59] economical came
[1:00:02] together to make the pill
[1:00:05] house. And your time that you are living
[1:00:07] in, you are under the pill house. You're
[1:00:11] not in the time of the white house.
[1:00:13] You're not in the time of the red,
[1:00:14] neither the black. our time. It is these
[1:00:17] three powers that have come
[1:00:20] together. And if you look right now in
[1:00:23] in America or what is happening around
[1:00:25] the world, that's exactly what we are
[1:00:28] dealing
[1:00:29] with.
[1:00:31] Amen. Praise the Lord. We have all these
[1:00:35] uh uh uh uh uh
[1:00:39] uh economical things that are going on
[1:00:42] mixed with
[1:00:43] politics. And then it's also backed
[1:00:47] up by the ecominical church, the uh
[1:00:55] uh
[1:00:57] evangelicals, which is the religious
[1:00:59] branch that is there. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:03] Are we together? So you see we are in
[1:01:06] such a time where all of these things
[1:01:09] that are happening they are not just
[1:01:13] uh uh uh uh happening you know randomly
[1:01:18] that's why I always says prophecy is
[1:01:20] stronger than
[1:01:22] politics praise the lord because the
[1:01:26] beast power the evil power that is
[1:01:29] running in this age is the pure house
[1:01:32] power and when He runs. He runs with
[1:01:36] these three these three power merging
[1:01:40] together. Are we together? Amen. He runs
[1:01:45] with these three powers merging
[1:01:51] together. So that is the time that we
[1:01:53] are in. and and and uh and and you know
[1:01:57] I I I choose to bring this tonight you
[1:01:59] know just to be able to encourage you
[1:02:02] that the uh uh you know the the the the
[1:02:06] news the media you know they will they
[1:02:09] will tell us everything that is
[1:02:10] happening in in Washington everything
[1:02:13] that is happening in Wall Street and and
[1:02:15] you know you I mean you if you feed your
[1:02:17] mind to that you get discouraged you get
[1:02:20] broken but I'm telling you there's
[1:02:22] nothing you can do about it because the
[1:02:23] word of God says
[1:02:27] Praise the Lord. What you can do about
[1:02:30] it is do just like what Daniel
[1:02:35] did. For you to be able for those things
[1:02:38] to ever make sense to you because that's
[1:02:41] what Daniel wanted for the captivity to
[1:02:45] make sense to him. He had to go back to
[1:02:48] the writing of
[1:02:51] Jeremiah. Are we together?
[1:02:55] Amen. Now, watch this. Now, let's let's
[1:02:58] stay in this a little bit. Uh Daniel
[1:03:00] chapter
[1:03:04] nine. Are we
[1:03:06] together now? So he poured his heart out
[1:03:09] here and he
[1:03:26] prayed. Now look uh look here
[1:03:34] uh verse 20. That was where we read from
[1:03:37] the last time. Verse 20, chapter 9. And
[1:03:40] while I was speaking and praying and
[1:03:42] confessing my sin and the sins of my
[1:03:45] people and the sins of my people Israel
[1:03:49] and presenting my supplication before
[1:03:52] the Lord my God for the holy mountains
[1:03:56] of my God. Yeah. While I was speaking in
[1:04:00] prayer, even the man Gabriel womb whom I
[1:04:04] have seen in the vision at the beginning
[1:04:06] being caused to fly sweetly. He touched
[1:04:10] me about the time of the evening
[1:04:13] oblation, the evening sacrifice, the
[1:04:15] evening
[1:04:16] service. Praise the Lord. Amen. I hope
[1:04:20] he will fly and touch you tonight. Amen.
[1:04:24] He flatly and touched me about the time
[1:04:27] of the evening oblation. And he informed
[1:04:30] me and talked with me and said, "Oh
[1:04:33] Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee
[1:04:38] skills and what?
[1:04:41] Understanding for you to understand what
[1:04:44] is going on and how to deal with it.
[1:04:49] I've come to give you skills and
[1:04:51] understanding because you can never uh
[1:04:55] know how to deal with a situation until
[1:04:58] you understand what it's all about.
[1:05:03] Praise the Lord. Until you understand
[1:05:06] what what it's all about, you you will
[1:05:08] never know how to deal with it. Brother
[1:05:10] Brandham says here uh uh uh Gabriel
[1:05:13] instruction. He says here he says and he
[1:05:16] informed me and talked with me and said
[1:05:19] oh Daniel I have not come come forth to
[1:05:22] give thee skills and understanding. What
[1:05:24] if we could have we could have been
[1:05:27] there? How did he find him in
[1:05:32] prayer? He says how where did Gabriel
[1:05:35] find Daniel? Not on YouTube.
[1:05:39] He found Daniel in prayer. Are we
[1:05:42] together?
[1:05:44] Amen.
[1:05:45] Because the situation he was dealing
[1:05:47] with was burdening his
[1:05:53] heart. It's
[1:05:55] concerning. Praise the
[1:05:58] Lord. Maybe uh uh maybe many of us might
[1:06:01] might think that we don't care. I don't
[1:06:04] I'm not doing stocks. You know, I'm not
[1:06:06] I'm not a meer. But I'm telling you,
[1:06:08] even if you have a dam, your dam is
[1:06:10] affected by what is happening.
[1:06:15] If you have a neo is affected by what is
[1:06:17] happening?
[1:06:22] Are we
[1:06:26] together? So it is not it's not a place
[1:06:29] for us to just be h careless in
[1:06:34] attitude. We need to have understanding
[1:06:36] and skills.
[1:06:39] We we need to have skills. How to budget
[1:06:45] ourself. How to budget ourself. What we
[1:06:48] do with our
[1:06:50] money. Praise the
[1:06:55] Lord. All right. You might say, "I don't
[1:06:57] have money." But have the skills. So if
[1:06:58] you have the money, you know what to
[1:07:00] do. Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:07:04] Amen.
[1:07:07] Now, so uh uh you know, he says, "I've
[1:07:09] come down all down here and and and you
[1:07:12] see it's it's it's it's in every time.
[1:07:15] It's in every time." Even when God came
[1:07:18] down and met Moses for the deliverance
[1:07:21] of the Egyptian, he came down to give
[1:07:23] him understanding and skills. What is in
[1:07:26] your hands? That's why he asked Moses,
[1:07:29] "What is in your hands? Throw it down."
[1:07:31] Giving him skills how he will go and
[1:07:33] deal with the Egyptians. We need skills.
[1:07:37] How to live like a son of God in this
[1:07:39] day. How to live like a daughter of God.
[1:07:42] How to live like a Christian. We need
[1:07:44] skills.
[1:07:48] We need understanding and skills.
[1:07:53] And we can only get it.
[1:07:59] Are we together? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:05] Are we together? He says, "I want you to
[1:08:08] notice how Daniel, an alien, yet an
[1:08:12] alien, yet
[1:08:14] uh actually from his people and from his
[1:08:17] church without one church service,
[1:08:21] without any church to go to, without any
[1:08:25] hymn to be
[1:08:27] sank, but what he sank
[1:08:30] himself in the midst of all of this
[1:08:33] still held on to what The prophet said,
[1:08:38] "Praise the Lord. At least we have
[1:08:40] church to come to." Amen. He never had
[1:08:43] church to go to because they were so
[1:08:46] afraid. They never wanted to get in
[1:08:48] trouble with the
[1:08:50] Babylonians. Praise the Lord. Amen. We
[1:08:54] have one to come
[1:08:56] to. Are we together?
[1:09:02] He says no church to go go to, nobody to
[1:09:06] fellowship with. Everybody went to the
[1:09:09] hidden temple because I mean they the
[1:09:12] they the they they want they want to
[1:09:13] they want to hook up with the people and
[1:09:15] get and get opportunity. They want
[1:09:18] business opportunity. So they got to go
[1:09:20] to the Babylonian
[1:09:22] temple. They want they want Babylonian
[1:09:24] jobs. So they got to they got to they
[1:09:26] got to rub shoulder with the
[1:09:28] Babylonians.
[1:09:31] But Daniel said he was not going to
[1:09:33] defile himself. He purposed in his
[1:09:36] heart. Praise the Lord. Believing that
[1:09:39] God can take care of him in difficult
[1:09:41] times. And I believe that God can take
[1:09:44] care of us in difficult times.
[1:09:50] Praise the Lord. Oh, when these things
[1:09:53] starts to tight, that's when you will
[1:09:55] know how much of God is in you. Amen.
[1:09:59] That's right.
[1:10:03] Are we together? No church to go to. No,
[1:10:07] nobody to fellowship with. Nobody h
[1:10:10] Everybody went to healing. Everybody
[1:10:12] worshiped their idols. No Christian
[1:10:14] sung. Nobody believed the same thing he
[1:10:18] did.
[1:10:20] And in 68
[1:10:22] years from a young man of about 12 14
[1:10:28] years old.
[1:10:30] Amen. From a young man of about 12 14 a
[1:10:35] teenager. Praise the Lord. If we not if
[1:10:38] we not start learning to read our Bibles
[1:10:41] as young people and really start
[1:10:43] studying our Bibles, have interest to
[1:10:46] get in touch with this Bible, you will
[1:10:49] just be coming to church going home. You
[1:10:51] are just following.
[1:10:54] Praise the Lord. Are we
[1:10:59] together? For 68
[1:11:01] years from a
[1:11:05] teenager, he gave his heart to the word
[1:11:08] of
[1:11:09] God. He gave his heart to the things of
[1:11:11] God and said, "I will not defy myself."
[1:11:14] He could have he could have become like
[1:11:16] every other
[1:11:18] Babylonian. Pierce his ear, pierce his
[1:11:21] nose. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:24] just just follow the
[1:11:26] crowd. But there was something in the
[1:11:28] heart of that young man. And I hope that
[1:11:31] same thing is in the heart of our young
[1:11:33] people.
[1:11:41] And in 68 years from a young man of
[1:11:43] about 12 or 14 years old when he was
[1:11:46] taken down there, he
[1:11:49] heard truth to God and understood by
[1:11:54] Jeremiah prophets by by by by by
[1:11:57] Jeremiah's prophet that the days were
[1:12:01] almost
[1:12:03] Amen. Which mean he was reading the
[1:12:06] message of his day
[1:12:10] to understand the times that he's living
[1:12:12] in. Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:12:17] And and and and and we are blessed. I
[1:12:20] mean, we are blessed because we have the
[1:12:23] Bibles in every form. If you can't read,
[1:12:26] you can listen.
[1:12:31] You can play it on your
[1:12:35] phone. Are we
[1:12:38] together? He understood the
[1:12:40] times by reading the
[1:12:44] word. Praise the
[1:12:49] Lord. Not by his favorite uh uh news
[1:12:53] channel, whether he love Fox or he love
[1:12:57] CNN. Are we together?
[1:13:01] And in times like this, I mean that's
[1:13:03] where everybody that's where everybody
[1:13:05] mind
[1:13:06] is. We go to check it daily. What did
[1:13:09] they say? What is the news
[1:13:14] saying? Are we together?
[1:13:17] When we know that God word has spoken
[1:13:20] about this time that we are living in
[1:13:22] and to know that uh the the prince of
[1:13:25] the power of the air, the prince of
[1:13:28] loudish h the power of these praise is a
[1:13:33] is is is a threefold combin power. It's
[1:13:37] in the word. That's what the word tells
[1:13:43] us. We are under the writing of the pill
[1:13:46] house. That's I mean that's where we
[1:13:50] are. That's what is I mean uh pray
[1:13:53] praying life is so tough.
[1:14:00] Amen. Because that's what we are
[1:14:03] honored. That's our age. That's our
[1:14:09] time. And we will not understand these
[1:14:11] things because I mean a a prophet
[1:14:13] preached about it how many years ago? We
[1:14:16] will not understand it if we are not in
[1:14:18] the word.
[1:14:24] You can understand your situation by
[1:14:26] being in the word.
[1:14:29] The situation you're dealing with in
[1:14:31] your life is right in the word. The
[1:14:34] situation you're dealing with in your
[1:14:35] home is right in the word.
[1:14:42] Are we together?
[1:14:48] Oh God, if there's ever was a time that
[1:14:50] we ought to
[1:14:52] be setting ourself in order to pray is
[1:14:58] now. Praise the Lord. Amen. This was
[1:15:02] many years ago. He said that about you
[1:15:04] know 30 years ago or how many years ago
[1:15:06] he said that but we can feel it now. If
[1:15:09] you can't feel it, if you can feel it as
[1:15:12] an individual that I really need to
[1:15:15] boost my prayer life, something wrong
[1:15:17] with you.
[1:15:20] You are
[1:15:24] backsliding. You you you just have a
[1:15:26] form of
[1:15:31] godliness. Praise the Lord. Amen. I feel
[1:15:35] I feel it in me that I'm not to the
[1:15:37] place where I supposed to be in my
[1:15:38] prayer life.
[1:15:47] Are we
[1:15:48] together? If there's ever a time where
[1:15:50] we ought to to be setting ourself in
[1:15:53] order to pray is now. Amen.
[1:15:58] For we as his servants receive by the
[1:16:01] letters of the
[1:16:03] prophets by the warning of the Holy
[1:16:06] Spirit that we are in the last days. The
[1:16:10] Holy Spirit speak that in the last days
[1:16:12] men will be highminded
[1:16:15] uh h lovers of pleasure more than the
[1:16:19] lovers of God. Trust breakthrough false
[1:16:21] accusers. Amen. Despise users of the of
[1:16:24] of them that are good. We how how do we
[1:16:26] understand it? How how do we honest?
[1:16:28] Because the word said it. Are we
[1:16:32] together?
[1:16:34] Amen. It's because we see it in the
[1:16:42] word. And I understand that there will
[1:16:44] come scoffers in the last day. You know,
[1:16:47] I was looking at this last night as I
[1:16:49] was reading it and I paused for a while.
[1:16:51] you will realize that scoffers are not
[1:16:54] unbelievers.
[1:16:56] No, scoffers are not unbelievers. Go
[1:16:59] back and repeat it. The B when Peter
[1:17:02] talks about scoffers in the last days,
[1:17:04] he said there will be scoffers in the
[1:17:06] last days. And the scoffers will say we
[1:17:08] have heard about the coming of the Lord.
[1:17:10] They were believers. They heard
[1:17:13] it. But because they never took the word
[1:17:17] serious in their heart, they started to
[1:17:19] scuff the very thing that was preached
[1:17:22] to them, they started to scuff the very
[1:17:24] thing that they
[1:17:29] believe. When David said in Psalm
[1:17:33] 1 to sit in the seat of the
[1:17:36] scul, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:41] You your guest coffers in church, they
[1:17:44] laugh at
[1:17:45] everything. Nothing is serious to
[1:17:48] them. Everything is just funny. They
[1:17:51] just laugh at
[1:17:53] it and and lost the
[1:17:57] importance. Are we together? So we
[1:18:00] understand by the word that there will
[1:18:03] be scoffers in the last day. There will
[1:18:06] be people that will believe this very
[1:18:08] message born in message churches. They
[1:18:10] will come back and scoff the very thing
[1:18:12] they
[1:18:14] believe make fun of it because they know
[1:18:18] they know other
[1:18:21] stories. Are we
[1:18:24] together? And I understand that there
[1:18:26] will be scuffers in the last days. I
[1:18:29] understand that there that there will be
[1:18:32] h nation against nation in the last
[1:18:35] days. I understand that there will be
[1:18:38] title waves. We we having it all over.
[1:18:41] Every word is
[1:18:44] flooding. Praise the Lord. Why it should
[1:18:47] surprise us? The word said it.
[1:18:54] The word said it. That's what we are
[1:18:56] dealing with.
[1:19:07] That angel flies sweetly into the
[1:19:09] presence of Daniel, giving comfort, a
[1:19:12] little touch on his shoulder, say, "I've
[1:19:15] come to give you
[1:19:17] understanding. I just don't want you to
[1:19:19] be a bench warmer. I want you to be in
[1:19:22] this thing that you are believing."
[1:19:24] Amen. I want you to understand the date
[1:19:27] and the time that you are living in
[1:19:29] because I'm telling you, you can never
[1:19:31] be serious until you know how dangerous
[1:19:35] the time that you are living in
[1:19:39] is because that that is the way fallen
[1:19:43] men behave. We need emergency. We need
[1:19:47] something bad to happen. We need a shock
[1:19:50] for us to wake up to the reality of what
[1:19:52] around
[1:19:53] us. Unless something
[1:19:56] happen. That's why brother Bram says
[1:19:58] emergency causes desperation. He said
[1:20:00] it's not supposed to be like that. He
[1:20:02] said but it always happen that way.
[1:20:05] There has to be some kind of an
[1:20:07] emergency before we get
[1:20:09] desperate. We got to get sick and it
[1:20:12] looks like we almost die before say oh
[1:20:14] God have mercy. Lord please help me.
[1:20:15] Before we really want to
[1:20:19] pray, man always
[1:20:26] look. They always look for disorder
[1:20:29] chaos,
[1:20:32] trouble. Praise the
[1:20:36] Lord. At a time where the the Lord is
[1:20:39] giving us grace and we have all of these
[1:20:41] things, we don't make use of the time
[1:20:42] that we have.
[1:20:45] We wait for things to start going bad
[1:20:47] before we we want to get
[1:20:53] desperate. Are we
[1:20:56] together? Daniel said, I understood that
[1:21:00] books. We have in a 66 book volume,
[1:21:03] brother Brandham said, before
[1:21:07] us. One chapter a
[1:21:11] day. He gave you some comfort.
[1:21:18] Praise the Lord. And when God see that
[1:21:21] you set your heart to understand what
[1:21:24] you are reading, the same thing he did
[1:21:25] to Daniel, he will do it to you. Amen.
[1:21:30] You might not see a visible angel coming
[1:21:32] down, but the Holy Ghost will be there
[1:21:34] and he will start peeling off. He will
[1:21:37] start peeling off and you will start
[1:21:39] seeing things in the word that will be
[1:21:42] speaking to your condition.
[1:21:49] Praise the
[1:21:57] Lord. I understand that there will be
[1:21:59] fearful sights like flying saucers in
[1:22:01] the heaven, mysterious sights and
[1:22:03] mankind will be failing for fear. There
[1:22:06] will be uh perplexity of time and and
[1:22:09] and distress among the people. I read
[1:22:12] that that they will all go into
[1:22:15] organization and denomination and have a
[1:22:18] a a confederation in the last day. I
[1:22:20] understand that women will bop their
[1:22:22] heads in the last day. I understand that
[1:22:25] they will wear uh uh short clothes and
[1:22:28] walk in in in high shoes tinkling as
[1:22:31] they go in the last days. I understand
[1:22:34] that morals will be so low and all of
[1:22:38] those things are is right in the word.
[1:22:40] is not brother Brandham making it up.
[1:22:42] It's right in the word. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:54] Are we to Are we
[1:22:56] together? We can
[1:23:04] understand that these three four
[1:23:07] powers. Brother Brandham says when he
[1:23:10] preached the message invasion of
[1:23:13] USA, he told us how is invading
[1:23:16] churches, is invading
[1:23:19] homes. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:23] Amen. It's a three-fold
[1:23:26] power. The Bible say it's called death.
[1:23:30] And what he want to bring is
[1:23:32] death. Praise the Lord. He want to bring
[1:23:36] death. He just warned you to be dragging
[1:23:38] your cuckas around. She that liveth in
[1:23:41] pleasure is dead while she liveth. He
[1:23:44] that liveth in pleasure, the church that
[1:23:45] live in pleasure is dead just to be
[1:23:49] dragging our dead cockas around. But we
[1:23:51] are
[1:23:52] dead. No life really in
[1:24:01] us. Are we together?
[1:24:05] You know what I'm trying to do
[1:24:07] tonight is for for you to be able to
[1:24:10] see your spiritual
[1:24:13] world. It was because Daniel wanted to
[1:24:16] understand these things. That's what
[1:24:18] demon powers was trying to stop
[1:24:21] him. Praise the Lord. Put him to sleep
[1:24:25] if he read to read. If you want to
[1:24:27] listen to tape, he falls to sleep so
[1:24:31] quick. Amen.
[1:24:34] He can be busy. He can be doing
[1:24:36] everything. Pick up the Bible to read.
[1:24:38] He fall asleep. Demon power, demon
[1:24:40] influence trying to stop him from
[1:24:44] understanding the times that he's living
[1:24:46] in. It's serious. It's not a
[1:24:49] joke. You have to recognize that. You
[1:24:52] have to stand up to it.
[1:24:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:01] Just like I said, appreciate a lot of
[1:25:03] lot of our, you know, uh uh uh saints
[1:25:05] some some work at night comes right into
[1:25:08] church Sunday morning, but you also have
[1:25:11] to realize you never came to
[1:25:14] sleep.
[1:25:18] Amen. No, you have to be conscious of
[1:25:24] that. And you know that when when your
[1:25:26] body falls in that place, you will fall
[1:25:28] asleep. You you got to stand up. I mean
[1:25:30] do something or else you will be robbing
[1:25:33] yourself of the blessing of the service.
[1:25:36] You just show
[1:25:37] up. But what did you got from the
[1:25:40] service?
[1:25:49] Are we together?
[1:25:51] because because of of of the of the
[1:25:53] things that uh you know were uh uh uh
[1:25:56] done. He wanted to understand his
[1:25:59] time and that's what his war was all
[1:26:03] about. That's what his war was all
[1:26:06] about. Ephesians chapter 3. Let's close
[1:26:09] somewhere here. I've said this to you

[1:28:02] you. Amen. The birds can do it better
[1:28:05] than you. The trees can do it better
[1:28:06] than you. Amen.
[1:28:11] You love the Lord. Let's Let's look at
[1:28:13] Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:28:17] Amen. Did I say chapter 3, chapter
[1:28:21] 1. Ephesians chapter
[1:28:25] 1. I' I've used this
[1:28:28] before. Ephesians chapter 1. Let's read
[1:28:30] verse three. Blessed be the God and
[1:28:33] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[1:28:36] blessed us with all spiritual blessing
[1:28:38] in heavenly places in Christ. Amen. In
[1:28:44] heavenly places in Christ. So uh uh Paul
[1:28:47] is saying here he has given us the the
[1:28:50] believer's position like brother Brandon
[1:28:52] would call it. He have that's where our
[1:28:54] blessing is. Our blessing your blessing
[1:28:57] is in your position.
[1:29:00] Amen. Just like God could only bless
[1:29:03] Israel as long as they were in their
[1:29:05] position in the promised land. He can
[1:29:08] never bless them out of their position.
[1:29:10] So your blessing is in your
[1:29:13] position. Amen. It says he bless us with
[1:29:17] all spiritual blessing in heavenly
[1:29:20] places. Ephesians chapter
[1:29:24] 6. Find a place here and close for this
[1:29:28] Wednesday night. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:33] Spoke to brother Crosby today. He called
[1:29:36] me from the UK. He sent his greetings
[1:29:38] and uh uh he be traveling with his wife
[1:29:42] for that wedding over in Florida. Uh
[1:29:45] that's that's I think one of the either
[1:29:48] the sister or brother from his church.
[1:29:50] And uh so he sent his greetings. Paul
[1:29:53] says here in Ephesians chapter
[1:29:56] 6 verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be
[1:30:00] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:30:02] his might. Put on the whole armor of God
[1:30:04] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:30:07] wise of the devil. For we rise not
[1:30:10] against flesh and blood, but against
[1:30:13] principalities. Yeah, these are the
[1:30:15] prince of Peshia, the prince of Greece,
[1:30:18] the prince of Laudacia, the prince of uh
[1:30:21] uh uh Brooklyn Center, the prince of uh
[1:30:24] uh whatever we are dealing
[1:30:27] with.
[1:30:29] Amen. Those are ranks of
[1:30:34] powers. Those are ranks of
[1:30:39] demons. For we rise not against flesh
[1:30:42] and blood, but against principality,
[1:30:44] against powers, against rulers of
[1:30:46] darkness of this
[1:30:49] word, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:30:52] high places. If you re if you look at
[1:30:55] that word high places is the same as
[1:30:57] heavenly places.
[1:31:01] So see what Paul is doing at the
[1:31:03] beginning of the book, he tells you of
[1:31:05] where your blessing is. At the end of
[1:31:08] the book, he says your battle is are the
[1:31:13] same. Amen. Praise the Lord. Where word
[1:31:17] where word where word where word where
[1:31:17] word where word where word where word
[1:31:17] where word where word where where the
[1:31:18] Lord will bless you, that's where the
[1:31:20] devil will fight you.
[1:31:27] Are we together?
[1:31:30] He gave us all spiritual blessing in
[1:31:32] heavenly places. That is the believer's
[1:31:34] position. And then when you come to take
[1:31:37] your position now as a son of God, then
[1:31:39] the battle
[1:31:41] starts because the devil knows how
[1:31:44] powerful you are when you are in your
[1:31:46] position.
[1:31:48] Praise the Lord. He just he want you to
[1:31:51] be running all over the place basic for
[1:31:53] every other thing but not your position.
[1:31:57] Amen. Talking everybody business and
[1:32:00] leave your own.
[1:32:04] Are we together?
[1:32:09] He knows that when he can when he can
[1:32:11] keep you distracted, he can keep you out
[1:32:13] of your your position. He knows that I
[1:32:16] mean uh uh uh uh
[1:32:21] uh you know you can you can you can be
[1:32:23] effective down there and and then yet
[1:32:25] you are I mean you are wounded, you are
[1:32:27] cried. You know that your position, I
[1:32:29] mean uh your place, your place of
[1:32:31] blessing, your home, your family, your
[1:32:35] health. You need good health to serve
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] Lord.
[1:32:41] Amen. You need good health to serve the
[1:32:43] Lord. We come here Wednesday night. The
[1:32:45] rest of the time we spend it at home
[1:32:47] with our
[1:32:48] family. So don't come and enjoy, you
[1:32:51] know, the blessings of the Lord here and
[1:32:53] then you can't enjoy at
[1:32:56] home. Are we
[1:33:02] together? So Paul is saying God has
[1:33:05] given you all spiritual blessing but
[1:33:07] he's also trying to tell you that uh
[1:33:10] there is spiritual wars in heavenly
[1:33:14] places.
[1:33:20] Amen. We wrestle not against flesh and
[1:33:22] blood.
[1:33:25] We know no man after the
[1:33:28] flesh. Praise the
[1:33:30] Lord. We know no man after the
[1:33:43] flesh. So I hope you grab where I was
[1:33:46] going to tonight.
[1:33:48] Daniel understood by books. His desire
[1:33:51] to understand the message of his hour
[1:33:54] started his
[1:33:56] battle. His desire to understand really
[1:33:59] what I
[1:34:02] believe and many many many of us many of
[1:34:06] us will
[1:34:07] testify. Just put aside and says I
[1:34:10] really want to read the book of Malachi.
[1:34:13] Start with chapter
[1:34:15] one. Chapter
[1:34:17] two. It does not have many chapter
[1:34:19] though. But you'll realize how the devil
[1:34:23] will fight
[1:34:24] you.
[1:34:27] Amen. I really want to
[1:34:31] pray. Start just start uh uh I mean uh
[1:34:35] uh uh start cleaning your
[1:34:37] lives. Sometimes that's when you have
[1:34:40] the most horrible dreams.
[1:34:43] When you are dedicating yourself, you
[1:34:45] are consecrating
[1:34:51] yourself because your battle is in your
[1:34:55] position. Praise the
[1:34:57] Lord. As long as uh you know the the
[1:35:00] Jebusites and the Amorites could keep
[1:35:02] Israel out of the promised land, you
[1:35:05] know uh they were
[1:35:08] slaves. They were slaves.
[1:35:12] And many of us are slaves to thoughts,
[1:35:15] slave to the media, slave to uh we are
[1:35:19] slave because we are out of our place of
[1:35:24] position. But they had to fight to get
[1:35:26] back there. Musicians, you can come for
[1:35:28] tonight. It's
[1:35:30] 9:00. Let's bow our bow our heads and

[1:38:16] God, that you have guided us here
[1:38:19] tonight by your
[1:38:20] feet and have given us your word
[1:38:23] according to our need, Lord, because you
[1:38:26] have said in your holy word that your
[1:38:27] word would not go out and return to the
[1:38:30] void.
[1:38:31] You know our heart
[1:38:33] desires. You know where our struggles
[1:38:36] are. You know the storms the devil has
[1:38:39] unleashed against us in this
[1:38:41] life. You know what our problems are,
[1:38:46] our headaches and our
[1:38:48] heartaches. And your word has come to
[1:38:50] address whatever it is that we are going
[1:38:53] on. We are so grateful father that you
[1:38:56] have
[1:38:57] spoken. And we are so grateful, Father,
[1:39:00] oh
[1:39:01] God, that you have given
[1:39:05] us a listening ear to hear what the
[1:39:08] spirit has said tonight. Yes. And

[1:39:13] and we praise your holy name and we
[1:39:16] bless you, Father, oh God, that indeed
[1:39:19] we have found favor in your
[1:39:21] sight. Father, it doesn't matter what we
[1:39:24] go through. One thing is sure that we
[1:39:27] have found favor in the sight of the
[1:39:29] almighty God and that we are in your
[1:39:32] hands and that you are with us in the
[1:39:34] midst of the storms that we are not
[1:39:37] alone. Praise be to your holy name. You
[1:39:39] have given your holy angels charge over
[1:39:41] us. Father we are not alone. Those that
[1:39:44] are with us are more than those that
[1:39:46] those that are against us. And father,
[1:39:49] we know when the enemy shall rise
[1:39:51] against
[1:39:54] us like the waves of the sea is just
[1:39:58] going to crush at our
[1:40:00] feet because that is where he belongs.
[1:40:03] He belongs under our feet. We thank you
[1:40:06] for your word tonight.
[1:40:09] And father we pray that you give us the
[1:40:11] skills and the understanding we need to
[1:40:14] navigate father the problems and the
[1:40:16] storms we are going through in this
[1:40:18] present time. Father we pray for
[1:40:21] strength because you have said in your
[1:40:23] holy word that your strength is made
[1:40:25] perfect in our weakness. We pray father
[1:40:27] give us strength. Lord give us strength
[1:40:30] to brave the storms. Give us strength
[1:40:32] for we war not against flesh and blood
[1:40:34] but against principalities and spiritual
[1:40:37] weakness in high places. Father and we
[1:40:40] know that you have equipped us to deal
[1:40:42] with these forces and we are more than
[1:40:44] able father to meet them on their
[1:40:47] grounds and overcome them by grace.
[1:40:49] Thank you Jesus. Let your word take the
[1:40:53] center stage in our lives.
[1:40:56] Father give us more of you. Give us more
[1:40:59] of you. We need more of you in our
[1:41:01] lives. Let your word, Father, oh God,
[1:41:04] anchor in our souls that in the midst of
[1:41:07] the storms, Father, we shall not be
[1:41:10] dragged around. Let your word, Father,
[1:41:12] take the preeminence in our lives, Lord,
[1:41:16] Father, let your word, oh
[1:41:19] God,
[1:41:21] prosper in our
[1:41:24] souls. Bless your word, Father. You have
[1:41:28] given us your word. You didn't look at
[1:41:30] our shortcomings. You didn't look at our
[1:41:32] shortfalls. You didn't look at our
[1:41:34] mistakes. You have given us your word.
[1:41:37] Not the second person, not the third
[1:41:39] person. You gave us your word, your very
[1:41:41] own self. Father, we have the word of
[1:41:44] God in our hands. What do we do with it?
[1:41:47] What we do with it matters the most.
[1:41:50] Give us grace to live by the word that
[1:41:53] thou have given us, Lord. the word that
[1:41:56] has been anointed for us in our day and
[1:41:58] age. Praise be to your holy name
[1:42:01] tonight. You will not let us ever be
[1:42:04] forgetful where you took us from. And
[1:42:07] father, we prayed it
[1:42:09] tonight. Help us to be conscious of your
[1:42:12] Holy Spirit. Help us, Lord. Do not let
[1:42:16] us lose that godly consciousness.
[1:42:19] A lot of the times we go out of our way
[1:42:21] to do things because we think that we
[1:42:24] are just by ourselves. Lord, let us be
[1:42:27] conscious of your presence. So much so
[1:42:30] that we shall not do anything that is
[1:42:32] against your word. Thank you so much,
[1:42:35] Father. We are so grateful. Bless your
[1:42:38] servant, Father, that has labored to
[1:42:41] bring us your word tonight. And we pray
[1:42:43] that you'll replenish the energy that
[1:42:45] has gone out of him tonight. Thank you
[1:42:48] so much and we pray that as we depart
[1:42:51] your presence tonight, Father, you will
[1:42:53] go with every one of us to our various
[1:42:55] homes and give us grace to meditate upon
[1:42:58] these words of life that have come to us
[1:43:00] in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:02] Christ. Father, we pray with
[1:43:04] thanksgiving.
