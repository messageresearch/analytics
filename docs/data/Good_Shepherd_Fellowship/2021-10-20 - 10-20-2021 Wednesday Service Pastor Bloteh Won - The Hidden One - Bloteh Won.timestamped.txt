[51:04] there was some report that came from
[51:05] brother jason

[51:09] the brothers one of the brothers in the
[51:11] church they'll work in the hospital so
[51:13] he was able to visit with brother jason
[51:15] and then this morning brother jesus
[51:17] himself took a selfie of himself and
[51:19] sent it out so we want to thank the lord
[51:21] for that
[51:22] praise the lord
[51:24] amen
[51:26] and we also we believe that as the lord
[51:28] is doing it for our brother he's doing
[51:30] it for many of his children
[51:32] praise the lord
[51:34] amen
[51:37] now now uh the lord bless you you may
[51:39] have your city a little bit
[51:41] uh
[51:43] uh yeah i'm just telling you to sit down
[51:46] so i can have you stand up again
[51:48] so i can just i'm just trying to find a
[51:50] place
[51:55] now you see uh uh what what i wanted to
[51:58] to go over just like i announced on
[52:00] sunday i will i won't be here this
[52:02] coming sunday now i'll be preaching for
[52:04] one of the local denominational churches
[52:06] around you
[52:08] so uh pray for me that the law will
[52:11] will
[52:13] just make us to be a blessing to the
[52:15] people there
[52:16] and uh
[52:20] uh
[52:23] strange enough uh
[52:25] uh
[52:27] i was i was thinking about
[52:29] speaking on some thinking
[52:31] and
[52:40] we spoke a little bit
[52:42] on sunday
[52:44] we were talking about
[52:46] uh
[52:48] read a quote from brother brennan
[52:50] marriage and davos where he talks about
[52:53] you know
[52:57] the church being pregnated with the word
[53:00] let me see this
[53:03] what has happened over the years
[53:06] uh and and and this is not just only
[53:10] things that are that are common to us
[53:13] in the message it has been it has been
[53:15] it has happened
[53:17] you know every revival has had
[53:20] these kind of things
[53:23] when when the word of the lord comes
[53:26] just like it was to the children of
[53:28] israel when god was dealing with them
[53:31] through all of those ordinances
[53:34] and the different things
[53:35] you know of the temple and the
[53:37] sacrifices
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] at that time
[53:43] their level of understanding was this is
[53:47] what the lord wants us to do
[53:49] and and and to them that was all
[53:54] but the mind of god behind all of those
[53:57] ordinances was was big
[54:00] when god was thinking about the lamb he
[54:02] was thinking about the temple he was
[54:04] thinking about you and myself not this
[54:06] physical building
[54:09] praise the lord
[54:10] amen
[54:12] to be able to enjoy the full benefit of
[54:15] the world
[54:16] you must be able to
[54:18] to uh
[54:21] take the word of
[54:22] god apply to yourself
[54:26] and think about
[54:28] god
[54:31] that is not a man
[54:34] god
[54:35] that is merciful
[54:37] god that is gracious
[54:38] the god of correction
[54:40] the god of judgment you think about all
[54:42] of that
[54:43] but it's more in a sense that
[54:46] when god gives his word
[54:48] his mind is to bring us to an expected
[54:51] end
[54:53] amen
[54:54] he want to bring us to a place
[54:57] of fellowship with him he want to bring
[54:59] us to a place of communion he want to
[55:02] bring us to the place where we can
[55:04] experience true
[55:06] relationship as father and children
[55:09] that's god's mind
[55:11] is to bring us to that place
[55:14] it is not just
[55:16] do's and don't
[55:18] it is not just to be able to give us
[55:20] rules and regulations praise the lord
[55:24] now and if we understand it more in a
[55:26] place of a relationship and fellowship
[55:29] with the father the things that he asks
[55:31] us to do we will do them gladly we will
[55:34] not see them as
[55:36] as rules
[55:37] praise the lord
[55:40] now the reason that is that you have to
[55:42] remember when i quoted timothy uh in
[55:46] childbearing
[55:48] paul says a woman will be saved i said
[55:50] that was prophecy praise the lord that
[55:52] was prophecy to the church it was not
[55:56] [Music]
[55:57] about the the
[56:00] the physical woman now you will see
[56:02] there in the scripture i have this
[56:05] scripture also in my note i didn't use
[56:07] that
[56:09] on on sunday
[56:12] i think i did something here tonight too
[56:14] i don't think i've seen my note back
[56:16] there
[56:17] but i don't have much here so
[56:20] uh i will just
[56:23] share the little i have i have one quote
[56:25] to read
[56:26] to you
[56:28] now so uh the bible says god says you
[56:31] know uh in his word there will be no
[56:34] bearing
[56:35] praise the lord
[56:37] he says there will be no barren among
[56:38] your cattles among you know your family
[56:41] your women and all that but you realize
[56:43] that peter comes in the book of peter
[56:45] and said if these things be in you
[56:48] which were the seven virtues he says you
[56:51] will not be boring
[56:53] now so it gives us a mind that when god
[56:56] spoke about barrenness in the beginning
[56:59] it was now more about physical
[57:01] barrenness
[57:04] it was more about his children now being
[57:07] not being barren you know his children
[57:10] have to be fruitful his children has to
[57:13] bring out his nature
[57:14] he has to live his life
[57:18] you see and and that's where all of
[57:20] these different form of teaching legal
[57:22] listening all of these things the gods
[57:24] talk to the lord the gods talk to the
[57:27] physical application and they could not
[57:30] follow the the holy spirit to go through
[57:37] praise the lord
[57:42] amen
[57:43] they couldn't follow the holy spirit to
[57:45] go through
[57:47] and and uh
[57:56] now so
[57:57] uh there were a few things that i i
[58:00] wanted to go over
[58:02] a little bit
[58:03] and just and and and you know
[58:06] and just be able to help help us look at
[58:09] it
[58:10] you know in the light of the world
[58:13] because uh
[58:16] but then while i was thinking about that
[58:19] and just like i said uh you know
[58:22] you remember we talked about the first
[58:26] twins and the second twins what we call
[58:28] the first twins and the second twins in
[58:30] the scripture the first twins was uh uh
[58:34] king and abel
[58:35] amen
[58:37] and the second twins the first twins we
[58:40] said they were two
[58:42] different seed
[58:43] in the same womb
[58:46] praise the lord
[58:48] the second seed was it was the same seed
[58:51] bringing out two different nature
[58:56] are we together
[58:57] amen
[58:58] so you will see that in in
[59:01] in the picture of god jesus
[59:04] taught that in matthew chapter 13 when
[59:07] he said a sower went to saul
[59:09] now so he was bringing us back to
[59:12] genesis to show us that there were two
[59:14] seeds that were sow in the earth and the
[59:17] father said allow them to grow together
[59:20] praise the lord
[59:22] now when it comes to
[59:24] uh uh
[59:25] israel and jacob you will also realize
[59:28] that they were there there were the
[59:31] buffer then came from from from isaac
[59:35] the son of abraham isaac the type of
[59:39] christ
[59:41] but now we realize that the 2c that came
[59:45] out of rebecca
[59:46] they are not as compared to king and
[59:49] abel but what they are compared with is
[59:53] what paul spoke about in romans the war
[59:56] that we have in
[59:58] us we have our flesh warring with our
[1:00:02] spirit
[1:00:07] praise the lord
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] we have we will have that constant
[1:00:13] battle until we leave from here
[1:00:16] you always have mind battles you will
[1:00:18] have negative things coming to your mind
[1:00:20] you will always have you know your body
[1:00:23] not feeling well and and and and
[1:00:25] different emotions going through your
[1:00:27] body you always have a joy of the lord
[1:00:30] in your heart you you always have that
[1:00:32] that next thing it will be a fight
[1:00:38] praise the lord
[1:00:39] now even if you look at king and abel
[1:00:44] where did i put my
[1:00:46] my note
[1:00:47] but let let's go ahead if you look at
[1:00:49] king and abe i know knocking on it you
[1:00:51] look at isa and jacob like we talked
[1:00:53] about this and and and we know that uh
[1:00:57] that's where the breath ride came from
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:00] the birthright
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:03] now but look at this we know
[1:01:05] that the birthright
[1:01:08] is to the firstborn
[1:01:10] but watch this now you will realize how
[1:01:14] many times in the scripture
[1:01:16] the god bypass the first bone
[1:01:23] how many times
[1:01:25] king was the first that came out of the
[1:01:27] womb
[1:01:28] of eve
[1:01:30] but god bypassed him
[1:01:33] amen the blessing went to set that took
[1:01:36] the place of
[1:01:39] abel
[1:01:41] praise the lord
[1:01:42] ishmael was the first that came out of
[1:01:45] abraham
[1:01:47] but the blessing isaac was the promise
[1:01:51] praise the lord
[1:01:52] so now you think about it now what what
[1:01:54] what what can we draw from there
[1:01:57] there is a first birth
[1:01:59] and there is a second birth
[1:02:02] praise the lord
[1:02:04] even though honor the lord is a lord and
[1:02:07] god is not breaking his lord
[1:02:10] no
[1:02:11] but you see in a way that god showed it
[1:02:14] through the scripture it gives us an
[1:02:17] idea that god was aiming at the new
[1:02:20] birth more than the physical birth
[1:02:23] your physical birth is your first bone
[1:02:25] that's the first time you were born
[1:02:26] physically
[1:02:29] your new birth is your second birth
[1:02:34] that's why jacob crossed his hands
[1:02:37] it's a type of cavalry
[1:02:39] christ crossing his hands
[1:02:42] for the blessing to go to the second
[1:02:46] so in god's mind he's more interested in
[1:02:49] your second birth
[1:02:51] than your first birth
[1:02:53] he more interested in you being born by
[1:02:56] him
[1:02:57] than being born by your parents
[1:03:11] so you see
[1:03:14] uh
[1:03:16] all of these things are lying in the
[1:03:17] world
[1:03:19] all of these things
[1:03:22] and uh
[1:03:25] and the devil
[1:03:28] he knows that too
[1:03:31] he knows that because when god said
[1:03:34] the seed of the woman would bruise the
[1:03:36] serpent head he was targeting that seed
[1:03:40] praise the lord
[1:03:44] and then he targeted the seed
[1:03:47] all alone
[1:03:48] thinking that it was it was moses all it
[1:03:51] was uh it was isaac it was uh you know
[1:03:55] i mean it was jacob he targeted the sea
[1:03:57] oil on
[1:03:59] all through the ages
[1:04:05] praise the lord
[1:04:16] until god
[1:04:18] bypass him
[1:04:20] because all the devil knows
[1:04:23] about a life being born on this earth
[1:04:27] was alive to come by sex
[1:04:30] but when god was talking about the seed
[1:04:32] of the woman god was talking that's the
[1:04:35] reason why he clearly said it
[1:04:38] the devil was not listening to claire
[1:04:42] he said the seed of the woman
[1:04:45] if satan would have grabbed that
[1:04:47] revelation he would have not bothered
[1:04:48] isaac he will not bother moses you are
[1:04:50] not about anybody
[1:04:52] because he will know that god himself
[1:04:55] would give a woman a seed
[1:05:02] what am i driving to tonight
[1:05:10] praise the lord
[1:05:13] you know sometimes these things and and
[1:05:15] that is and that's where most of
[1:05:17] the the the people in in the ages i mean
[1:05:20] the god they got they got so troubled
[1:05:23] because some of those things that
[1:05:24] brother branham said
[1:05:26] they never under just just like paul
[1:05:28] imagine paul saying you know let the
[1:05:30] woman be submissive to her husband in
[1:05:32] child bearing she will be saved do you
[1:05:35] know can you imagine how many people

[1:12:22] seed

[1:12:26] we'll know whether you are come
[1:12:29] for such a time like this
[1:12:33] praise the lord
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:40] who know whether god has given us this
[1:12:43] opportunity
[1:12:46] because he won he wanted the people
[1:12:49] to stand for him
[1:12:53] in this hour that we are living in
[1:12:56] praise the lord
[1:12:58] don't despise your experience with god
[1:13:01] don't despise what god is doing in your
[1:13:04] life
[1:13:05] praise the lord
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:08] you might not be on the on the housetop
[1:13:11] and and
[1:13:12] you might not be on the on the
[1:13:14] hallelujah bench
[1:13:16] but yet god
[1:13:18] in
[1:13:20] his all-sufficient way is dealing with
[1:13:22] each and every one of you praise the
[1:13:24] lord
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:29] but i believe that god
[1:13:33] has put us in a situation just like i
[1:13:36] said
[1:13:37] trying to make
[1:13:39] you know
[1:13:40] a saying of mary and joseph
[1:13:43] you know in a time of taxation
[1:13:47] when everybody was busy and everybody
[1:13:49] was quarantined and everything was going
[1:13:51] on
[1:13:52] but in that very hour
[1:13:55] god had a people
[1:13:57] that he was dealing with
[1:13:59] and it was a great move of god
[1:14:02] even though all the world despised it
[1:14:05] the media was carrying
[1:14:08] false news and they were they were
[1:14:10] saying anything they want to say about
[1:14:12] mary and joseph
[1:14:14] but that was the greatest move of god
[1:14:17] almighty god
[1:14:18] was taking on sistine elements
[1:14:23] to come endure with his creation
[1:14:28] the lord
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:34] humans are like that
[1:14:37] it's so easy when people start to talk
[1:14:39] about a setting drink
[1:14:42] we want to taste it we want to see
[1:14:44] everybody talking about this
[1:14:46] you know everybody is you know wearing
[1:14:48] this you know everybody is saying this
[1:14:50] you know we sometimes we are drawn to
[1:14:51] that
[1:14:54] but most of the time that's not how god
[1:14:57] works
[1:14:59] praise the lord the bible says we must
[1:15:01] prove all things
[1:15:03] and hold fast to that which is proven
[1:15:06] to be good
[1:15:08] praise the lord
[1:15:10] but what i want us to look at tonight is
[1:15:13] that we all have read
[1:15:15] the book of esther
[1:15:17] we could go right back to esther chapter
[1:15:20] one i i remember
[1:15:22] many years ago when we were stay
[1:15:24] recording on on cassettes i preached
[1:15:27] preach from the book of esther right in
[1:15:29] the same church
[1:15:30] i preached a message on the elected lady
[1:15:33] and
[1:15:34] uh
[1:15:35] you know
[1:15:36] talks about all of the numbers there and
[1:15:38] all of that but that's not what i want
[1:15:40] to get in tonight
[1:15:42] uh i'm trying to find a place to put my
[1:15:44] fault because i'm having just a few
[1:15:46] things before me
[1:15:48] and uh
[1:15:50] but if if you think about it
[1:15:52] one thing did also is that uh you know
[1:15:55] we we all
[1:15:57] uh know and we learned you know that uh
[1:16:00] you know the name of god is not
[1:16:02] mentioned in the in the in in the book
[1:16:04] of esther
[1:16:07] it is truth when you read our
[1:16:08] translation
[1:16:10] but it is not true when you read the
[1:16:12] hebrew
[1:16:16] it is true when you read the
[1:16:18] the this translation that we have
[1:16:22] you will you will not find g.o.d god or
[1:16:26] lord
[1:16:27] you know uh or yahweh you won't find it
[1:16:31] but in the
[1:16:32] hebrew it is not truth but we will not
[1:16:35] get into that
[1:16:38] one thing that that kind of caught my
[1:16:40] attention which of course that other all
[1:16:43] of those things have you know we have
[1:16:45] preached there we have said that before
[1:16:47] and it's just that you know when you
[1:16:49] when you study it a little bit more you
[1:16:51] kind of foresee that yeah
[1:16:53] uh
[1:16:54] you know
[1:16:55] almighty god has a reason
[1:16:58] i started looking at this
[1:17:00] and i found this uh
[1:17:02] uh the very persian name
[1:17:04] esther you have to remember that esther
[1:17:08] was a persian name given to her
[1:17:11] the same as shadrach meshach and
[1:17:13] abednego
[1:17:15] you know those were babylonian names
[1:17:17] that were given to them
[1:17:19] so esther
[1:17:20] is a persian name
[1:17:23] in the hebrew
[1:17:28] esther means hiding
[1:17:34] it means hating
[1:17:37] that alone will say a whole lot
[1:17:42] because this particular book because of
[1:17:44] the record of
[1:17:46] god not being written in it or lord or
[1:17:49] yahweh nothing
[1:17:51] people have frowned at this book
[1:17:53] even luther doing his reformation asks
[1:17:56] that the book of esther being taken out
[1:17:58] of the bible
[1:18:04] if the frown at it
[1:18:06] you know at uh
[1:18:08] even even the book uh the the books of
[1:18:11] the maccabees
[1:18:12] it has history
[1:18:14] and it talks about how the law delivers
[1:18:17] it talks about the law
[1:18:19] you know and and yara said the book
[1:18:21] esther reading year and and not even the
[1:18:24] lord's name written in it
[1:18:26] if you if you read you'll find about
[1:18:28] luther from that he says you know how
[1:18:30] how can we have a book like this in the
[1:18:33] bible but you can you can understand the
[1:18:36] time that he was living in you can
[1:18:38] understand the grace of the hour that he
[1:18:40] had
[1:18:42] praise the lord
[1:18:43] so all of that
[1:18:45] but yeah i was i was kind of looking
[1:18:47] through that and and studying a little
[1:18:49] bit and i realized yeah the uh uh esther
[1:18:53] we we know that her name her hebrew name
[1:18:56] is adasa
[1:18:58] advanced is now the meaning of esther
[1:19:01] in hebrew she was called adasa that was
[1:19:03] a hebrew giving name
[1:19:06] esther was a persian name that was given
[1:19:08] to her
[1:19:10] and esther means
[1:19:11] hidden
[1:19:14] and that is what uh
[1:19:16] uh esther on on on the other hand
[1:19:20] is indeed the hidden one
[1:19:24] the hidden
[1:19:25] one
[1:19:28] praise the lord
[1:19:31] she hides her real name adessa
[1:19:34] she has her jewish identity
[1:19:38] she lived in the palace as if
[1:19:42] she were a good persian girl
[1:19:45] praise the lord
[1:19:50] but this is what i want to i want to
[1:19:53] to grab our attention tonight if the
[1:19:55] lord will help us
[1:19:58] many many
[1:20:00] years ago
[1:20:02] this thought dropped my mind
[1:20:06] i remember one time i was preaching
[1:20:08] there in d.c for brother mark walsh and
[1:20:10] i was speaking on this
[1:20:12] and he said he said to me after the
[1:20:13] service he said bro how can you preach
[1:20:15] this on wednesday night
[1:20:18] he says how can you preach this on
[1:20:20] wednesday night wednesday night is just
[1:20:22] too short for the message like this
[1:20:24] praise the lord
[1:20:27] brother branham said this in the seventh
[1:20:29] seal
[1:20:30] let me share this with you
[1:20:32] he said
[1:20:36] he said
[1:20:37] now
[1:20:38] we are going to speak here now
[1:20:41] on this seventh chapter
[1:20:46] to kind of breach
[1:20:48] in it
[1:20:50] between the six
[1:20:52] and the seven seals
[1:20:55] praise the lord it might it might go
[1:20:57] over your head tonight but i pray that
[1:21:00] the lord
[1:21:01] don't allow it to go over your heart
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] he says between the sixth and the
[1:21:07] seventh seal he said because
[1:21:10] that's
[1:21:13] that's the only material
[1:21:15] that we have to go on right now now he
[1:21:19] was preaching on the seventh seal
[1:21:22] but
[1:21:23] there was something important for him to
[1:21:25] talk about
[1:21:27] more than the seventh seal
[1:21:29] because the seventh seal what is the
[1:21:32] seventh seal the seventh seal is the end
[1:21:35] of all things
[1:21:37] the seventh seal is the coming of christ
[1:21:42] praise the lord
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:45] but there is something
[1:21:47] important
[1:21:49] that he wanted to talk about
[1:21:52] so that's the reason why he says this he
[1:21:54] says that
[1:21:56] because that's the only material we we
[1:21:58] have to go on right now
[1:22:01] is
[1:22:02] sex between
[1:22:04] the sixth and the seventh seal
[1:22:07] is the calling
[1:22:09] of israel
[1:22:11] now you have to remember that the sixth
[1:22:13] seal
[1:22:14] is the tribulation seal
[1:22:18] the seventh seal
[1:22:20] is
[1:22:22] the coming of the lord
[1:22:24] or the end of all things if everything
[1:22:27] in the coming of the lord praise the
[1:22:29] lord now you see why it's not good to
[1:22:32] preach this on wednesday not because
[1:22:33] there is no time
[1:22:35] i'm just going to have your hair
[1:22:36] spinning praise the lord but i i trust
[1:22:40] that it will not leave your shoulder
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:44] so he says right between the sixth seal
[1:22:47] and the seventh seal
[1:22:49] this is where it would get it would get
[1:22:51] beautiful
[1:22:53] is the calling
[1:22:56] of the jews
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:00] he said now
[1:23:01] this introvert
[1:23:04] between
[1:23:05] the sixth hue
[1:23:07] is
[1:23:08] a calling and sealing of the
[1:23:11] 144 thousand
[1:23:14] jews
[1:23:15] calling the tribulation period after the
[1:23:18] church is gone now there's more we can
[1:23:21] say to that
[1:23:22] but what brings this in what brings this
[1:23:26] to my mind and what makes it important
[1:23:28] now realize now is between the six seal
[1:23:31] the tribulation seal and the seventh
[1:23:34] seal
[1:23:35] which is the coming of the lord we're
[1:23:37] dealing with the book of revelation
[1:23:39] between it is the calling of israel now
[1:23:43] remember
[1:23:44] like whatever last week or last uh two
[1:23:47] weeks we talked about how
[1:23:52] after the the mount
[1:23:54] moriah
[1:23:55] experience after
[1:23:57] abraham was visited by god
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:02] isaac vanished from the text
[1:24:06] only for him to appear in the text
[1:24:10] when rebecca
[1:24:11] was coming
[1:24:14] praise the lord which explained to us
[1:24:17] after revelation chapter 3
[1:24:20] john said come up heaven
[1:24:24] which was the rapture
[1:24:25] so the church was called to come up
[1:24:28] higher and the church did not appear
[1:24:30] again until
[1:24:34] revelation chapter 19
[1:24:36] when john said come and see the lamb's
[1:24:38] wife
[1:24:39] now
[1:24:41] i'm i'm saying this to say to you
[1:24:45] that
[1:24:47] things
[1:24:48] that were brought to us
[1:24:51] by the prophet messenger
[1:24:54] were not were not just flying thoughts
[1:24:59] they were not flying thoughts
[1:25:02] praise the lord
[1:25:06] it was brother branham that taught us
[1:25:08] and said if you cannot find it in the
[1:25:10] bible don't swallow it
[1:25:14] he says every revelation must run
[1:25:16] through the scripture
[1:25:21] praise the lord
[1:25:23] amen
[1:25:24] now the reason why i said this tonight
[1:25:26] is that uh
[1:25:29] uh
[1:25:30] you will realize
[1:25:32] uh i mean this is it it's kind of a
[1:25:35] spring out to me
[1:25:37] and and and and it was it was i mean
[1:25:40] those kind of things can just make you
[1:25:42] you just you just weep you know you just
[1:25:45] you just embrace the word you want to
[1:25:47] you just want to
[1:25:49] put the bible inside you know you can do
[1:25:51] it like that the holy spirit has to
[1:25:53] transform you
[1:25:56] because now watch it now
[1:25:58] because you will realize
[1:26:00] this whole
[1:26:02] story of esther
[1:26:06] that is going to be the calling out of
[1:26:09] the jewels
[1:26:12] because the book of esther
[1:26:15] is written between the sixth chapter
[1:26:19] and the seventh chapter of ezra
[1:26:27] praise the lord amen
[1:26:31] the book of esther is written between
[1:26:33] the sixth chapter and the seventh
[1:26:35] chapter now if you read the sixth
[1:26:37] chapter you will read
[1:26:39] in the book of ezra you will read about
[1:26:42] the king darus
[1:26:44] now you have to remember now that this
[1:26:47] is
[1:26:48] the the the meat and the persian
[1:26:53] so it's two kingdom
[1:26:57] darus was the king of the meats
[1:27:03] praise the lord
[1:27:05] and hassan sirius was the the the king
[1:27:08] of the persian which of course that was
[1:27:11] just a title of their king that was not
[1:27:13] even his name
[1:27:16] just like pharaoh
[1:27:18] just like abimelech those were just
[1:27:20] titles
[1:27:23] are we together
[1:27:25] but
[1:27:27] that was the thing that

[1:36:30] 8 you will realize that exodus chapter
[1:36:33] 17
[1:36:36] israel had just come to that place
[1:36:39] of of a great trial
[1:36:42] where
[1:36:44] the people were murmuring for walter and
[1:36:46] all of that in god give them
[1:36:48] a drink
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:52] and the bible says here
[1:36:56] praise the lord
[1:36:59] are we together
[1:37:07] verse seven he called the name of the
[1:37:09] place masha and marba because of the
[1:37:12] shining of the children of israel and
[1:37:14] because
[1:37:16] they tempted the law saying
[1:37:18] is the is the lord among us or net

[1:37:25] trial
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] the lord have they have just come out of
[1:37:30] a trial and god proved
[1:37:32] himself he came down
[1:37:36] he turned the bitter water into sweet
[1:37:38] now they have water to drink
[1:37:41] praise the lord
[1:37:44] right after the thought it was it was
[1:37:46] victory and and and they are drinking
[1:37:48] from the fountain and they are wasting
[1:37:50] water on their head you know when god
[1:37:52] gave us he bless us then we start to
[1:37:54] waste it you know and and and you know
[1:37:56] and they are enjoying themselves right
[1:37:58] after that
[1:37:59] the bible says the next verse
[1:38:04] praise the lord
[1:38:06] then came amalek
[1:38:08] and fought
[1:38:10] with israel
[1:38:12] now that battle
[1:38:15] was word
[1:38:17] almighty god became jehovah nisi
[1:38:20] where where moses held of his hand
[1:38:24] praise the lord
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:26] where joshua and and the rest of them
[1:38:29] the hair moves his hand why the now
[1:38:34] israel was on the on the agility
[1:38:38] and
[1:38:40] amalek was the first group of people
[1:38:45] that
[1:38:47] went in their way to stop them
[1:38:51] praise the lord
[1:38:54] and you can read through the the verse
[1:38:56] and and uh
[1:39:00] and moses said unto joshua choose us out
[1:39:04] man and go out and fight with i'm alike
[1:39:06] and tomorrow i will
[1:39:08] i will stand on top of the hill with the
[1:39:11] rod of god in my hand and so joshua did
[1:39:14] as moses said unto him and fought with
[1:39:17] armor like moses
[1:39:18] and aaron
[1:39:20] and he went up to the top of the hill
[1:39:22] and it came to pass you know why the
[1:39:24] hell moses hand we know all of that you
[1:39:27] know i'm just trying to bring you to a
[1:39:29] place here
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:32] verse 15 and moses built an altar and
[1:39:36] called the name of the place jehovah
[1:39:38] nisi
[1:39:40] for he said because the lord have sown
[1:39:45] that the lord
[1:39:48] will have wall
[1:39:50] with amalek from generation
[1:39:53] to generation
[1:39:56] praise the lord
[1:39:57] amen
[1:39:59] god now telling ezra
[1:40:01] i will fight with amalek until i
[1:40:05] take them out of the face of the earth
[1:40:10] praise the lord
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:18] this these are not just bible stories
[1:40:22] when god says something in his word he
[1:40:24] mean it
[1:40:29] numbers chapter 24
[1:40:33] verse 20.
[1:40:39] praise the lord
[1:40:46] numbers chapter 24 verse 20
[1:40:49] and when he look on amalek he took up a
[1:40:52] parable and said amalek was the first of
[1:40:56] the nation
[1:40:58] but his little end shall be
[1:41:01] that he perished forever
[1:41:07] praise the lord
[1:41:11] so
[1:41:12] it became a parable in the sense that it
[1:41:15] became a saying
[1:41:17] among the children of israel
[1:41:20] that god says i would take up with
[1:41:22] amalek they were the first nation
[1:41:25] that stood to stop israel
[1:41:28] in their journey for no reason
[1:41:34] for no reason
[1:41:36] when the scripture says the battle is
[1:41:37] the laws you better take your hand from
[1:41:39] in it
[1:41:42] praise the lord
[1:41:44] because if you can fight your battle god
[1:41:46] can fight for you
[1:41:54] deuteronomy chapter 25 verse 17.
[1:42:00] me run through this quickly
[1:42:02] just a few more strips a year and then
[1:42:05] we will
[1:42:06] we will find a place and stop
[1:42:09] i'll leave you right on the edge of the
[1:42:11] cliff
[1:42:12] and you have to hold on until we meet
[1:42:14] again
[1:42:18] praise the lord
[1:42:21] 25
[1:42:22] 17.
[1:42:32] remember what amalek did
[1:42:34] on today by the way
[1:42:39] when you come out
[1:42:42] when you come forth out of egypt how he
[1:42:45] met thee by the way
[1:42:48] and smoth
[1:42:50] the hemo part of thee
[1:42:53] even all that were feeble behind thee
[1:42:57] when thou were faint and weary and
[1:43:01] he feared not god therefore it shall be
[1:43:05] when the lord thy god has given thee
[1:43:07] rest
[1:43:08] from all that their enemies around
[1:43:12] about in the land which the law that god
[1:43:15] gave thee for an inheritance to possess
[1:43:17] it that thou shalt blot out the
[1:43:20] remembrance
[1:43:22] of amalek from under heaven
[1:43:25] thou shall not forget it
[1:43:29] thou shalt not forget it
[1:43:37] praise the lord
[1:43:44] remember jesus said
[1:43:47] all of these little ones
[1:43:52] if you touch them it's better that a
[1:43:53] male stone
[1:43:55] was hanged on your neck
[1:44:01] i'm alex wayne and started touching the
[1:44:03] feeble ones the little ones the older
[1:44:05] people the sick that was in the mess
[1:44:09] started plaguing them hitting them
[1:44:14] that's what happened
[1:44:18] when a brother is going through a
[1:44:20] trouble
[1:44:22] or a struggle
[1:44:24] and then we gossip about them
[1:44:27] we talk about them
[1:44:30] they are god's feeble ones
[1:44:33] you are called to pray for them
[1:44:36] and not to smite them
[1:44:40] not to smart them with bad words
[1:44:43] but pray for them
[1:44:50] god told them
[1:44:52] thou shalt not forget it
[1:44:59] now so all of this where we come to
[1:45:06] word ed saul
[1:45:08] had his problem
[1:45:10] it was on this very thing
[1:45:12] the war against the amalekites
[1:45:15] amalek
[1:45:16] he spared the king
[1:45:20] and the king that he spared
[1:45:26] is the grandfather of
[1:45:29] heaven
[1:45:30] i wanted to hank
[1:45:34] so you see the same amalek
[1:45:37] an israel battle
[1:45:41] ended when the ten suns
[1:45:44] of hermes was hanged
[1:45:48] it brought the end of the amalekites
[1:45:53] the word that god told him in exeter
[1:45:57] he watched over his word
[1:46:10] praise the lord
[1:46:11] so if you can see god in the book of
[1:46:13] esther please see god there
[1:46:16] because he's all over the pages
[1:46:18] praise the lord
[1:46:20] he's all over the pages
[1:46:22] amen
[1:46:25] it's a theological thing which of course
[1:46:27] is truly it's not physically written
[1:46:29] there but by divine revelation we can
[1:46:31] see him through all the pages
[1:46:33] praise the lord
[1:46:37] there are few more scriptures i have
[1:46:39] here but i won't go into them tonight
[1:46:45] musicians can come
[1:46:52] but see the see the divine
[1:46:56] providence
[1:46:58] see the the divine
[1:47:01] stage that god said
[1:47:05] that esther that's why mother kai told
[1:47:07] her
[1:47:14] maybe that god brought you to this time
[1:47:16] for this very reason
[1:47:21] praise the lord
[1:47:22] i don't know what i don't know your
[1:47:24] reason of being in this church
[1:47:27] i don't know your reason you got to find
[1:47:29] your reason
[1:47:31] you got to make your call and your
[1:47:32] election show you got to make sure that
[1:47:34] you're not called by the man
[1:47:37] you're not called by the church make
[1:47:39] sure that your call and your election is
[1:47:41] in god
[1:47:45] we'll call you
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:52] i told you since
[1:47:54] something one time
[1:47:55] i said look
[1:47:56] it's completely different
[1:47:59] in the marriage covenant the right is
[1:48:00] giving to the man to go and choose his
[1:48:02] wife
[1:48:04] but when it comes to this
[1:48:07] gods
[1:48:08] give you the right
[1:48:10] to choose
[1:48:12] who is your pastor
[1:48:14] if he was giving me the right to choose
[1:48:16] who to be in my church
[1:48:18] i look for some of the best people in
[1:48:20] the world
[1:48:22] praise the lord
[1:48:25] when you see the ride is placed in your
[1:48:26] hands
[1:48:29] you have to know your calling you have
[1:48:31] to know why you are here

[1:48:51] [Music]

[1:49:00] i say
[1:49:02] what they know and what they don't know
[1:49:05] about the message of the hour about the
[1:49:07] prophet of god if people are saying
[1:49:10] all sorts of things about christianity
[1:49:13] maybe you are brought
[1:49:18] to this time to this age

[1:49:30] introvert
[1:49:33] this time is called a time where god
[1:49:35] long suffering suffer

[1:49:41] time like that in the days of noah where
[1:49:44] the outdoor was open for seven days it
[1:49:47] was a time of god's long suffering
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:53] that's the time that we are living a
[1:49:55] period
[1:49:57] an introvert a time that is called the
[1:49:59] long suffering of god
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:08] maybe you are brought to this time
[1:50:11] for this very reason
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:15] esther was now placed there because of
[1:50:17] herself
[1:50:19] she was placed there because of others
[1:50:25] praise the lord
[1:50:28] some of us that god has given the grace
[1:50:30] to cross the atlantic ocean be in
[1:50:33] america
