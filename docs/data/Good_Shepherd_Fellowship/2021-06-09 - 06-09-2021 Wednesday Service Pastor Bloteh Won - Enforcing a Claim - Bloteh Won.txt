service into a prayer service amen but we can stay praise him through the preaching of the word when we say amen amen when we say praise the lord when we say hallelujah all the praises goes to the father amen let's take our bibles tonight and uh i can get away from the subject of rest that we've been talking about and because that's just what my body needs rest amen praise the lord brother i believe it was beautiful but just for a prayer service tonight and to kind of obey faith in our heart let's just read isaiah chapter 15 45 isaiah chapter 45 and let's read from verse 9 isaiah chapter 45 and we will take a verse in the book of psalms just uh to to be faith in our heart tonight and uh and then if the lord give us uh another time we will get back on our subject of rest glory be to god amen but it's it's amazing when the people of god pray and then the lord choose to come and have his way it is such a blessing isaiah chapter isaiah chapter 45 is that what i said okay i see why my reading yet is different because i'm not in assay as i 45 let's read from verse [Music] 9. now what what i want to remind you is that keeping as i have 45 honor context god is talking about a gentile king cyrus so you have to keep them in at the back of your mind that's that's the context where he approaching what he's going to say verse 9 woe unto him that strife with his maker let the porsche strive way far with the porsche of the earth shall the clay say unto him that faction it what maketh thou all that works he have no hands woe unto him that said unto his father what be what begeth doubt or told the woman what have thou brought forth thou said the lord the holy one of israel and his maker asked me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the works of my hand command yea me i want you to remember that because i will do it on that a little bit commend yeah amen is god asking us to command him is that not humbling praise the lord that particular verse has been misunderstood in the pentecostal in the character world and uh but let's read on a little bit here verse 12 verse 11 again for thou said the law the holy one of israel the maker the holy one of israel and his maker asked me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the works of my hands command ye me i have made the earth and created man upon it i even mine hands have stretched out the heavens and all their hosts have commended praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seed and psalm chapter 65 i'm i'm coming back to that verse again psalm chapter 65 let's read psalm chapter 65 uh i'm coming back to that verse again we read one verse in psalm chapter 65 praise the lord we'll read one verse in psalm chapter 65 and that will be verse 4. that will be verse 4 blessed is the man whom thou chose it and caused to approach unto day that he may endure in that cult we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of thy holy temple praise the lord i believe that the lord has caused us he has chosen us and he has caused us to approach unto him praise the lord amen listen to what brother branham said when he read that that particular scripture the psalm chapter 65 he said notice he said notice come in the approach of god god has a way of approach you know if you are going to visit a king there's a way you approach a king there's a way to approach well make it more simpler than that the boy did want to approach a young lady to get acquainted with her there's a setting approach you just can't come up there and say hi there like to meet you shake your hands and she isn't very much a lady she will let you know where to get on and off at there's a certain way you want to approach it you want to come up with respect to the lady and so far and there's a way to approach all things praise the lord there's a way to approach all things i want us to underline that and there's a way to approach god praise the lord there's a way to approach all things and there's a way to approach god and if we don't know the approach to god we will never be able to get an audience with god praise the lord if we don't know the approach to god we will never be able to get an audience with god he said in a court you just don't walk up and the judge is on the stand and say hey josh i want to talk to you a little bit will throw you out of the courtroom lock you up for this orderly conduct see there's a way you have to approach the judge praise the lord how much more our maker creator of heaven and earth there is a way to approach god but yet the psalmist said blessed is the man whom thou chose it and cause to approach thee praise the lord he calls us he has given us this privilege for us to approach him to even put his name on our tongue the most unruly part of our body the part that is difficult to team but he have caused us to approach him we get so used to the wednesday night and the sunday morning and the routine of church and sometimes it is just the service and let god never be out of the picture there is one purpose why we are here is because of him we counted the privilege that he have caused us to approach him that he made word in that cult the simon said we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house amen we shall be satisfied with the goodness oh david said i was glad when he said unto me let's go to the house of the lord praise the lord do you feed that way when it's time to come to church you just you feel glad that i'm going in the house of the lord because i know i will be blessed i know god is going to speak to me oh are you thinking i don't know if i want to i want to be there tonight i'm a little bit tired and uh but you have to know that blessed is the man praise the lord in most cases that word man stands for human right okay so blessed is the person that god has given such a privilege to be able to approach him we must count in the blessing praise the lord we must count in the blessing because that's where the blessing starts from you're very taught right what is in your mind coming to the house of the lord that's where the blessing starts from it does the blessing does that comes from the the wonderful dynamic preaching of the word it's just your mind your attitude your approach to the lord now even if the preacher is the most hypocrite god is going to so honor your approach amen that even if he got so crutch in his mind and he says i'm just waiting for that brother let me see him coming through the door i'm going to ring him down but with that sacred attitude in your mind oh almighty god i can't wait to get to the house of the lord thank you jesus praise the lord you come prayed up and your mind is just on god amen that's what he did to billam billam tried his hardest right but everything he comes that came from out of his mouth there shall be a star that will rise up to jacob and he prophesied and he blessed the people of god until the man i hired him was frustrated what is this guy doing that's not what i brought here for bro i brought you here so you can really get on that brother right now brother branham's is the right attitude the right attitude praise the lord amen he says there's an approach to everything and we want to look at tonight an approach to faith you know and approach to faith glory be to god amen we say on sunday god's purpose of creation was to find a place of rest rest was one of the primary thing in god's mind even being the great intent of spirit because he had you and myself as his attributes in him he was not addressed he was not arrest just having us in him we were holding him we were i mean we were sinless in him but yet he did not have rest that's the purpose of the gospel is to bring you rest the purpose of the ministry is to bring you to a place of rest that's the reason why the holy ghost is a type of rest praise the lord there's a rest on to the people of god he never just caught us to give us laws and rules where we can just be working like recruits jumping and just you know in the morning ellie joke in the afternoon electro we're just working our way working our way and working our way no he want to bring us to a place of rest yes and just to know that it's comforting just to know that it's comforting i got to prepare a place for you while he's here there the place of rest it's almost like uh uh uh planning for the vacation we uh i mean we are going to florida we are going to uh uh panama whatever it is you plan a vacation this is you know the date the expectation that creates in you you can't wait to get in because you know after you have left your environment and left everything behind you you know all you're going to do is just just rest right everything that you will be doing whether you go hiking whether you go swimming it will become rest to you because it's out of the normal you will enjoy it even though you now be sleeping from morning to night you'll be out looking at the street or in the morning shopping whatever you'll be doing it will be so relaxing to you that's what heaven is going to be like it's a place of rest amen never forget that god want to bring you to rest amen praise the lord just like how he sees from his work he also wants you to cease from your work and coming to rest so we will we want to look at something here the last time i was talking on the law of nature uh you know i use this uh you know where where brother branham says here he says there's a law to everything and and we use that there is a law giving among everything that's the way he says it there is a law giving among everything but tonight i i just want to go right back to that same context uh that scene as cold there and from restoration of the bride trade and i want to talk a little bit on enforcing the claim enforcing a claim and that's the reason why we read from the book of isaiah chapter 45 let's go back there again like i said the context of the of the chapter is god talking about uh a gentile king that before he was born before he was born god is prophesying about him he's giving a word over to his prophet isaiah to talk about cyrus verse 1 isaiah 45 thus said the lord to his anointed to sorrow whose right hand have i withholding to subdue nations and god is prophesying you know this this would just give us a clear picture word you know uh uh you know god ordained leaders and god is is is giving a word about this man even before he was born right praise the lord and how he will subdue nation and all of that and then in the conversation it's almost like he made us he knows how our thoughts run and he know how people would think about this how can how can isaiah come and be prophesying about a gentile uh you know king and you know in in water view and then so he tried to address it address the conversation there it just looked like like uh you know uh a man writing a story he says uh uh concerning this man that i've prophesied about i mean i'm the maker it's just like the the click and i said to the portal why you choose to do this and why you choose to do that praise the lord and he goes on and he says and and and wrote on to him that said to his father why be gathered this and why they know to the woman why you brought for that and he gets back down here to where we want to look at a little bit thus said the lord god that's verse 11 the holy one of israel and his maker acts me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the works of my hands command yea me like i said this this uh uh uh verse is a very big verse in uh in uh penny costar and uh the karamazov movement all of these prosperity gospel preachers they like to use that because they can use that to ginger the people and say you see you can command god and you know god is saying you should command him you should say thanks to him praise the lord he says i have made the earth and create a man upon it you just wash it you know as i had a beautiful style of writing you just watched god have just said you know he says ask anything concerning the sons of men in the works of my hands command yemen amen he says i have made the earth and create a man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all the horse have commanded praise the lord now in one sense you can think about it this way who they command him before he created everything and if nobody commanded him nobody can command him now praise the lord if nobody commanded him nobody can give him a command now but you see that it's a way that the uh uh uh you know uh the word is rating in and and and if you go back and look at it you will realize i was just looking at that uh uh studying that a little bit this evening when i got here you realize that uh in a way that god said this it's not in the sense of you commanding him is in the sense of you uh accepting what he has done accepting what he has commanded is more in the sense of you trusting him for what he has said amen if i have ordained cyrus to be my seventh if i call him man anointed you better trust what i'm doing praise the lord so we want to look at that and approach this thought of enforcing the claim that brother branham expressed here in in restoration of the bride and i think it's a beautiful way because many times we we we express faith i i i fear i mean faith and and and there is a sometimes there's a substance of fear believing god and hoping that it does not fail we are expressing faith and saying lord i believe you but yeah you are scared oh my goodness i don't really know lord i believe you i believe you you can do it then you come out again say lord i believe you you can do it one should be enough praise the lord if you believe god you must be a lord i believe you praise the lord amen it's almost like brother brahma says planting the seed and going back and digging it up again have half a dramatized and then you cover it up again and you go back and you come and dig it up again i'm believing god lord jesus i'm i'm believing you i know you can do it lord jesus i be i believe nothing is impossible with god nothing fear is honor that fear is on the dead it's almost lord i believe you do it now before it before it failed yeah an element of fear when god says command me he's saying trust me trust me know that my thoughts are right whatever i have ordained whatever i have spoken you see that's the reason why brother branham said fit must have a resting place and the resting place of faith is not what you think it's not how you feel it's not a symptom it's not a situation faith resting place is the blessed word of god praise the lord faith must have a resting place that's what he says amen lord be to god we ain't age like i said people we express faith and we almost like a child going through the graveyard whistling sure to assure himself that he's not afraid when he's afraid we are so afraid praise the lord now let's follow this now brother branham dealing with this as he approached the subject he took the thought from the message that brother neville preached but nivea was preaching the message and bernie expressed the thought of restore he used the word restore and then he was also using the the expression of enforcing the claim and brother brahm says adjust some notes down and i went home and started studying it i realized it was a beautiful thought and then as he started stealing on on this message or starting on the thought of restoration uh enforcing the claim he uh took an example and in in in he kind of started splitting it to us now he he brought it this way and he says it's just like when brother evans lost his car i brought a car was stolen but evans used to be the one that repaired brother branham's car so i mean there was there was uh there was uh uh you know a big uh uh stealing cars you know people were jumping into people kyle it was it was it was big at the time in indiana you know and and uh brother evans left his car and and he and his family they were driving you know uh you know pretty much like two hours or more coming over to to uh you know jeffersonville for the meetings and all of that and and stole the brothers car so brother branham talking this story you know relating here he's he's kind of for relating enforcing the claim because the car has lost you know or the car was stolen now so he's kind of kind of to help us to see how the brother car was restored back to him amen and for the car to be restored back he had to enforce a claim it's almost like what we do with our insurance company sure are we together praise the lord so now he's bringing it here now in the line of faith so we can be able to grab it but then he get he goes right here to the scripture he says so then we had a scripture here yeah because as he talks about it he said when he was told that brother brother evans car was stolen what he did he sent for some brothers praise the lord and and i believe that these were brothers that loved the lord and also men men of faith you know uh uh people that were caught up into the word people that were ready to put their hearts before god and and uh he read it in this message he said it in another message and what he said is that uh when the brothers came together he said well brother evans has lost his car and we must go before the lord for us to pray that the lord will restore our brother's car he said but we have to find a scripture you are enforcing a claim based on a law it's not because someone hits your car definitely the insurance company must pay pay for your vehicle you have to go and find a law are we together because faith must have a resting place a faith is at rest you will not be nervous amen you will not be nervous assistant says lord i can call ten thousand angels right now lord i i just give it to you i believe you can do it that's what brother branham says there is an approach to god there is an approach to everything are we together we are in our world we are looking to the great translation faith praise the lord the great translation faith the changing of our body the changing of our attitude now uh uh a faith is not having its resting place upon the word of god and you are looking at the symptoms in your body if you are basing your faith on how much you feel all the things that are happening around your life for you to believe that god is going to change your body and you're going to get a rapture you are putting faith to the wrong place are we together oh glory to god tonight amen i see you right on the edge of your seat praise the lord now he says so when he gathered the brothers together he says and so then we had a scripture here that jesus said wherever two or more i gather in my name and if they will agree i will be in their midst and if they will agreed as touching any one thing any one second thing in the exit don't doubt they shall have what they ask they shall be given to them now brother branham called the brothers together and he read the scripture he printed him to the promise of god he find a promise god have said now what are you thinking in your mind now what are you making up what god has said because we have to realize there's a law of god in nature beautiful oh my goodness and everything in nature draw their inspiration from the law of god praise the lord even the airplane that fly their inspiration was drawn from the birds and the way that god built the birds you know i was as i i was i was standing there and i was listening to i mean uh something on animal life and and uh uh one of one of the birds was the the wool picker that bird is built in such a way that the brain because you know how the wool picker hits praise the lord is built in a way to be able to absorb the shock when it hitting the the the wood like that right and i mean it's just beautiful sure so there's a law in nature verb talks about it the fish never i mean it never worried about being drunk right and never worry that it's going to get drowned in the water because it trusts its maker it believes the way that it was made praise the lord so brother branham and i read this uh and and talks about finding this scripture and he read the scripture he says he says now there's the law now the one that have to enforce that lord is the holy spirit amen the one that has to enforce that lord is the holy spirit the promise you already find a promise lord you said in your word you know a father would not give his child acceptance when they ask for fish neither a stone when they ask for bread so you will not deny them the eyes for the holy ghost it's a promise in god's word is right before you why leave that promise and start working the holy ghost up what brother branham is saying is that you have found a promise you have identified a promise in god's word it's a law of god all you have to do lord i believe your word because you said it i believe that this is your word amen right praise the lord heaven and earth will pass away but i believe that this promise will not pass away he says then it is the holy spirit that goes to enforcing their lord praise the lord it's almost like seeing the teeth in your house and you call the law enforcement and the police say we are on our way he said okay i'm going to tie that guy down i'm going to arrest him and imprison him in my bathroom until you come praise the lord glory be to god and if you try to do that you might be the one the police might be carrying are you grabbing the concept that's the reason why saints of god children we have to believe this word of god we have to take god at his word not the circumstances around our life god that have spoken his word and have made a promise and have called you to believe and identify that promise he's more than evil to bring it to pass in your life we try to make ourselves the enforcing officer you are not the enforcing officer of god's lord and like i said on sunday that's the thing that is creating a lot of disappointment in in in increasing them because people think that they are the enforcing officer they're going to bring to pass whatever god says they try to force things by rules and false things by regulation you know and and when things are not working out because they have put their hands into into god's business and mess their own life up then it says that there is nothing to the holy ghost it's all because they have put their own interpretation work things out their own way interpret it come this way and bring it this way and then it says where i try everything this thing does not work right you try everything the only thing you did not try is to take your hands off of god's word just believe what god says and trust that god is able to bring it to pass that's the only thing you did not try you try all the churches around you but you did not try taking god at his word people are disappointed they are frustrated brother branham says we will speak things into existence brother branham says the bride revival verb says we will claim our loved ones but yeah he's the very one that is saying the holy ghost is the enforcing power to god's claim are we together it's not by might now by power he said well by my spirit praise the lord some time ago when i mean we were you know working on our our uh instruments and looking for different things uh i've met a met a metal gentleman and he and his friend came somewhere to minneapolis and according to what he told me they took i don't know how many dollars long and bald i mean the best uh equipment i think what they were selling or the equipment they had were thousands and thousands of dollars that it took in loan to buy the equipment disco light and everything because they're coming to make a church and in their mind they have filled their minds now when we can get all of this equipment where is that in the great commission where is it in the great commission now go to the bank and take money buy the bags musical equipment go and rent a place or is that in the great commission i just said well yeah you know it didn't work i mean with five thousand dollars i can give you everything and uh i mean we just we're just selling everything and we i mean my friend gone to colorado and myself uh you know i praise the lord those things my work if you want to have a nightclub you know you want to have a nightclub you want to have a you know a recreation place in my work but not the house of the living god jesus says i will build my church and he is the word it takes the word of god the word is the foundation stone that very same word is going to be the headstone that's what it takes not the building not the equipment right right it has nothing to do with it right it has to be the word church if we don't if we don't strive to stay with this world if we don't pray that god keeps us with this word we are going to disburse like the wind when we leave the word and start chasing different things oh god help us lord to stay with your word glory be to god amen he says and there's the lord he's re he's now speaking about the scripture that he has read he says and there is the lord now the one that's here to enforce that lord is the holy spirit how about people who don't believe in the holy spirit you are rejecting your own peace and mercy you are rejecting your own peace and mercy because you are not allowing the law enforcement to enforce his law in your life you are not allowing the law enforcement to enforce this law in your home you are not allowing the law enforcement to enforce this law in your situation so you are rejecting your peace and mercy when you're supposed to be resting and let the law enforcement enforce the lord of god and bring to pass what god has said you are taking matters into your hands and you are so scared that you will fail and you say lord you know i believe you no you know i'm trusting you lord you know you know right okay if you trust me let go [Applause] you are trusting me let go you know sometimes you preach and you trust the lord to be able to inspire you but i will tell you the truth is sometimes is no measure to the way that god deals with a man on the subject there is no measure you are rejecting your own peace and mercy now he goes ahead and he says just reading this testimony to you he says now we got on our knees about five men but a soft man and many others there about four or five men after reading the law of god praise the lord amen he says and we got on our knees we knelt down and i plead this case before god and then i took the word the promise i talked the word many times we go to praying you have to keep the word on your mind don't be talking to god and be thinking about something thinking when i get up from here that's how i'm going to do that's exactly what i'm going to do and then you get up and you believe that god told you that you just got caught up in your emotion you were just speaking vain words and your mind you were kneeling down before god thinking about how you're going to solve your own problem you're on your knees finding your own solution right and that's the reason why we get so scared sure we can take it off our mind right get so scared now you know i'm trusting you you you know i'm trusting our goal is evil for god is evil he being able ever since people he's been unable god ever since faith in god brings you to a place of rest it brings you to a place of rest do you realize that most of the time when things will happen and god will answer your prayer even if it is right there right there and then there will always be a sudden moment where your mind goes off the problem oh oh thank you jesus you know it's just like brother branham said he says revival comes by flexibility he says that's how revival comes he said that's how child birth comes he said god never gave birth god never moved when the people are nervous when the people are scared to death he said god never moved i mean the preacher can preach the word and the word can be preaching and i mean he can be rebuking saying and he can be calling things out and they're oh my god you're just there and you are just right there and and then and yeah man and he's preaching and teaching whatever he's doing and god is just dealing with you you're just oh god and all god and after the service let's lift our hands and wash it right in that moment of flexibility that's when the holy ghost comes down and take those things that you have identified from your life when you start worshipping him thank you jesus for your word thank you lord for your word because when the music is playing you start being relaxed you are not afraid again oh thank you jesus i love you jesus right there then the holy ghost start dealing with you on those things that he have identified that's the reason why after the preaching of the word we must take some time in just worshiping and just say thank you jesus thank you lord after the reading of your bible you take some time and worship and say thank you jesus thank you for your word are we together he says and we nail down and i play in and i plead this case before god and then i took the word or the promise and send it forth i took the promise and sent it forth i love this the great holy spirit as he talked the word to serve the sermon he says a vision broke praise the lord he says a vision broke to brother branham it's a vision to a person like me or you that don't experience vision which of course is nothing god can still give you vision praise the lord vision was not only limited to brother branham amen but what is vision to the believer vision is the thing when the scripture says faith is a substance vision is the substance so a substance of things hopeful has resident in your heart and you say thank you jesus i know thank you jesus blessed be your name you know that you have let go of it you know you have trusted in his hands praise the lord and there is that substance in your heart the heavenly never passed away but his word his word which is his will will now pass away are we together praise the lord the great holy spirit as i took the word and served a summon he says a vision broke and i saw a man going to walls the bowling green kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving his truck and the holy spirit come upon him and condemn him praise the lord and condemn him and the c.o.d brother somewhere brother brahm talks about this very story he says and the holy spirit there he said the holy spirit condemned he says and the holy spirit brought back to his mind something that he was taught in sunday school right thou shall nasty so you see the word went and took a word that was preached the word took a word thank you jesus amen it proved that god is the believer of his own word enforcing a claim whatever you are believing god for enforcing the claim it's not going on hunger's track right now if you want to fast it must be a feast unto the lord it must be a feast unto the lord lord i command you right now there is an approach to everything very balances if she's a young lady and she knows who she is she will make that young man to respect himself and swallow every unpleasant words from his mouth if you don't approach her the right way because there is an approach to everything we together he says with a yellow shirt on driving the truck and the holy spirit come upon him condemn him and he turned around about halfway i saw him come back and park that car on the setting street over across the river he said i raised up and i told the brethren dos said the lord he said what is it enforcing enforcing restoring claiming the promise of god it's not you're doing it physically you are believing what god have said he said go i believe your word it's your word i believe your word praise the lord in the message talking that's the reason why he says we must present the talking with our prayers what is the talking the word because he said when i see the blood i will pass over you so presenting a promise of god reminding god of his promise that's why he told moses i remember i heard your cried and i remember my promise he said what is it enforcing giving back see that's it that's what it's talking about restore it bring it back to its original owner how are you going to bring him back are you going to get into a physical fight with the devil he says even market the archangel said sit on the lord rebuke me he never brought no railing accusation all because the devil knows how to get you in the word game he knows how to get you he got jesus one time he said it is written it is written he will give your angels charge over you jesus said it is written he said it is written he knows how to get into right the worst game praise the lord are we together he says and if satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of god we have a right this evening he said this morning this evening by the holy spirit to enforce a claim amen amen bring it back how we're enforcing that claim based on god's word praise the lord we can use the psalm that we just read tonight any false acclaim oh my goodness i love that oh praise the lord oh come on yes glad to find this sign quickly we can use that blessed is the man whom thou has choose and you have caused me to approach you lord you have caused me you choose me praise the lord you have caused me to approach you that i'm adwording your cops it's a promise that we have just read you see that's the that's the reason why the reading of the scripture is very important it's very important because this is the original seed from god's mind when that scripture reading is going are you reading your bible are you looking at that word on the board you better be applying yourself to every promise there if the devil is robbing me and he's abusing my mind i said then i said lord you know if it was me myself i don't want to be in your house but what keep bringing me back right what keep bringing me back every time i say you're dealing with my heart so it looks like you have more interest in this than i do have praise the lord i finish i i i find that i find the lord blessed is the man whom down has choose i didn't choose you you choose me and you have caused me to approach you oh glory god oh thank you jesus oh thank you jesus that had cost me to approach you praise the lord you have caused me to approach you so long just as i am i come to you tonight just as i am you know me better than i do i don't have to impress you because i do not surprise you glory be to god enforcing a claim praise the lord looking brother brand ministry whether it was a blind or it was a death that was brought before brother branham he never went into any kind of emotional movement right shake the person's head right no because he was solely basing every word that he would say on the promise of god every word every word he says lord approach this your daughter based on the commission just just the word just a word we envelop everything with our emotion and you know it and everything until god is not in the picture and if you see sometimes when god will move on on our behalf and he would do things and let's get to the place of testifying about that thing that the lord has done we are so much in the picture and we talk about you know i trusted i i was praying day and night i used to believe god i was just reading my bible and it's just you and you and you and you and you it's just you yeah that's the reason why we want quick results because we want to publish that ourself i pray for this thing and god answer my prayer that's why we look for quick results because we want we won't talk about ourselves brother branham says that's the reason why it's so hard for god to trust a man because let him do one thing and then he gets so proud he talked more about himself than he talked about the lord praise the lord enforcing the claim he said if he if he's afflicted you make you sick if the devil we have a right before god to enforce the law of god oh you know the law of god many are the afflictions of the righteous but you deliver them oh by your stripe i'm healed it's written in the law just take the law of god there is a lord of god praise the lord and how will you know the law of god to challenge the devil if you're not reading your bible if your bible is a stranger to you praise the lord i had a friend a friend of mine had a good friend he's the old preacher he says he says he says if he says if you were accused of being a christian he said it would be hard for them to convict you oh my goodness chuck i likes when he says that you know he's when he's doing his bible studies he likes to tell the people that he says we are so we are stranger to to to the word of god and if you were convicted of being a christian it would be hard for them to convict you because there is not enough evidence praise the lord are we together there is a lord of god by his tribe we are here amen bring him back turn him loose you are taking him out the end of death and we clean him bring him back but what are we basing our claim on the lord we are basing our claim on the lord which is the word of god we are basing our claim on the word of god praise the lord he says that's the enforcement back to the natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick woman is sick he says and they are out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim he says is our claim because god give it to us by his tribe we is by his and we praise the lord right in there you can see the one that is benefiting amen the one that has paid the price and the one that received the benefit by his tribe we are healed and it's the same that god so behold i send you elijah hello praise the lord before i send you elijah ruth i mean now me told ruth and says you are better to me than seven sons praise the lord you are better to me than seven sons because if i could have seven sons and lost all of them i mean i would have never been able to restore all that was lost right praise the lord amen god was so thinking about a people in this age that he had to send a prophet i will tell you god's brow is so important to him behold i sent you elijah but how many times that we talk about elijah and we don't talk about the one that elijah was sento it's right there they want that benefit the wonder benefit is the one that elijah was saying tall we benefit that's what that prophet of god would say they gave was not for me was for the people it was because of a people a bride yes a people that god want to bring to rest is because of a people that god wants to bring to rest he want to take us from the struggle of our mind take us from church works and church laws and bring us to rest he had to send a man a prophet that he prayed must trip him of everything so you and myself can have the benefit to know who god is to know what the holy ghost is to be able to experience god not just read a book and talk about jeremiah and talk about isaiah but to be able to experience god in our own lives where we can sit in the backseat praise the lord and see god waving through our lives and see his grace waving through our lives and changing our lives helping us we see habits going away praise the lord things that we struggle with and we struggle with we see them flying away that's why he sent a prophet so you can benefit so you can be able to experience god for god to be personal to you you forcing it clean praise the lord that's the reason why when there is there is an accident or whatever it is the insurance company they got to get their lawyer if they want to have that other company to pay back for your vehicle they got to get a good lawyer they gotta get a man that knows the bulk not the man that's wearing a badge a man that knows the book because he has to be able to flip the pages and find the lord for the claim praise the lord oh glory be to god tonight amen you love the lord tonight he's the one that enforced our claim praise the lord how the churches will put those things in our head you know you have to do you have to know is the word right since we are coming to the place where this word this word is everything to us this word is everything to us it's everything to us just fall in love with the word of god feed on the word of god believe the word of god don't even look at your your symptoms don't look at the things all kind of for struggling in your body just keep confessing god's word by your word i will be healed amen you said i will be changed from glory to glory praise the lord don't make it up read it don't make it up don't make it up because if it is not written it's not going to come to pass we get a bunch of christians that just make up things praise the lord don't make it up read it find it in the lord because you are talking about a claim find it yeah that's where you disarm the enemy all you disarm the opposition because there is a lord [Music] amen you have to pay back well you know this other mankind does not worth anything don't worry whether you walk anything or not there's a law that say you must pay back his car oh you know he's living in the rough neighborhood it had nothing to do with it there's a law that says you hate his car you must pay it back where he was born where he came from does not have anything to do with what the law says oh praise the lord we have an advocate almighty god that knows how to plead our case said devil you shot off your mouth you are a liar praise the lord everything that comes from your mouth is a lie even if you try to cut the scripture you stay lying the devil tries to cause the truth he still lies because he's the father of lies everything that comes from his mouth is a lie that's the reason why i don't believe what the devil is saying to your mind because he's a liar take what god's word has said oh let's just pray leave our hands in praise and just worship him
