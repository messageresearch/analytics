that we are just last week Wednesday our precious brother brother Jordan preached victory in surrendering most of the times we think the surrender is a sign of weakness but there is a sign of strength

the shame and reproach would never be our portion in the name of Jesus father we pray and we thank you so much Oh God they have hadn't answered our prayers tonight in Jesus name Amen shall we be seated you know ami welcome once again and other days I get into a head it's always a good feeling to know that you are in the presence of Goethe it just doesn't have to be on a Sunday morning or on Wednesdays as we are seated tonight at home at wake in the street wherever you find yourself just remember this that you are an ambassador of Christ you are God's own representative don't look across your shoulder to see a brother or a sister or a known face before you behave yourself wherever you find yourself know that the angels of the Lord having come from about you like the story that goes down one man there was a time one man went to steal cassava I I shared that story before it's a rooted crop he was so hungry there was no money he asked his child let's go to the bush they got there and then he has a son look on the left he looked they said about it coming he said no look on the right anybody coming he said no then the father went down he had a cassava stick to approach it and the boy said daddy daddy then he stopped anybody come in he said no what is the problem daddy we looked on the Left we looked on the right but we didn't look up praise be to God don't always forget there is an eye that is always watching 24/7 that I never sleeps that I never blinks that is watching we are not serving God because of men we are serving God out of the love we have for God praise be to God now we are living in the most dangerous times of human history we read about a duck ages and I will see how terrible life was in those days and I tell you that the days in which we are living today are equally very very Jack we are living in a very gross that biggest moment of human history I was having a conversation with my boss the day before yesterday that was Monday and then he was saying that children of today are not like the way we were when we were small I said it's true I said what the youth is dealing with today we never have to deal with it when we wait your age I said we used to play in the Sun we'll go to the bush we cut a steak we'll turn it into a gun and then we are just jumping in the gutters what have you but you dead you are playing with technology you are in the house with a child and the child is not home the child is right next door in the room and I'm thousands of miles away chatting with people they don't know people they may never see in life and that is the community will define themselves in that is the friends they have made and unfortunately they turn to listen to them more then you that have grown with them in the same house I say it wasn't like that with us you have to get up leave your home to go and then pay for a ticket to go and watch a movie to watch a concert what are you but today they sit in the room and technology brings it to them in the house you enter the room there that is probably on the up on the on the first floor maybe the mother is in the basement that urania rooms everybody is at home but everybody's absent we are living in a very dangerous moment don't lose sight of the condition in which we are living if there is any time that we have to seek the face of God and seek the face of God with reverence and with fear it is now do not let prayer and meditation pass you by we took several months talking about Priya's prayer makes you talk to God and of course God talks back when you pray but predominantly prayer makes you talk to God meditation makes God talk to you what is meditation sorry pessoa kind of meditate you can meditate if you know how to worry you will know how to meditate praise be to God worry is just taking a touch and thinking over it thinking over and over you think over it over and over and then you get worried the same way when you take the word of God and you keep it and you think over it over and over and over you are meditating your soul is feeding on the Word of God God through his word is talking to you praise be to God if there is any time we have to seek the face of God and seek the face of God with fear and with reverence it is now praise be to God you know sometimes we play hide and seek with God you hide and God comes and then he seeks you out you hide God comes and he seeks you out and then it becomes like God has become your playmates it's a dangerous thing to do don't do it because it goes to a point why you would hide and he will not come seeking you anymore there is a very very thin line between grace and judgment you don't know when you cross that line of grace into judgment be very careful God is not our playmate be very careful in your walk with God it's grace that has found us and if you have found favor in the sight of God it breaks all earthly protocols praise be to God it's a good thing you get to that place and then you reckon what God has done for you and then you give your life you surrender your all to God sis Kimberly got baptized on Monday when we got it together we're even knew it was going to happen where praise blood change just wanting happened I mean till just happened unexpectedly before we realized she was ready for baptism and praise God where the Jordan got her baptized on Monday probably around this time or a little later and this time how did not your hearts when you feel God is knocking on the door of your heart there is nothing to wait for people would say let me go think about it there is nothing to think about on the day of Pentecost when the believers were speaking in tongues and they propagated and Peter preached to them the Bible says they were pricked at hearts and they asked men and brethren what shall we do to be saved and is there a plenty every one of you and be baptized in name of the Lord Jesus Christ and your sins feble mitad praise be to God they didn't have to go to think to go and think about it when God is talking to you you don't have to go to think just imagine subway in Russia you may have heard those stories how some believers when they had God knocking at the door of their heart it was in winter when they accepted Christ it was a good opportunity to give a very good excuse I will just wait till a spring and the waters are warm so I get baptized they said no we are baptizing now right now our deceased were frozen I mean the rivers were frozen what we call ice fishing today in Minnesota remember Russia is one has one of the coldest places in the world negative 90 the worst I've seen him in Essaouira is probably negative 35 or 40 they went and they broke the ice they broke the ice probably people were passing by looking at them what are these people doing it's so cold are they're too hungry are they looking for fish they didn't know what was going on they broke the ice go to the water the freezing water and I am baptized what would be your excuse on that day that you are living in the state of Minnesota where there are 10,000 lakes praise be to God and you have heard a word about over and over and over and yet would not give your life to Christ why do you stand if you go straight in you don't see what I just take a bend on the right you find one if you don't see one on the right 10 on the left you see another we have no excuse praise beauty God by the grace of God tonight we are going to look at a message the Prophet preached in 1950 and he titled it faith without works is dead and we are going to look at this in the next few minutes praise be to God faith without weights is dead if you contend with me - James James - we are reading from 14 I have 14 to 26 year but I will just read 14 to 18 14 14 to 18 all right I read what do I eat profit my brethren though mlc he have faith and have no way have no works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things what do it it profit No let me take that again let me take sustain again and one of you say unto them depart in peace be you warmed and filled no is standing you give them not those things which they are needful to the body what doing it profit it is so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou hast feet and I have wakes humid I fit with our wakes without thy ways and I will shew thee my faith by my works praise be to God shall we be seated faith without works is dead it's like a body without the spirit the body is lifeless there is no life in it soul is fit without wakes now faith will probably have her a thousand times well let me just increase the tally tonight in other ways are making it a thousand and one the effect is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and the Bible says without faith no one can please God to please God and to be able to walk with God you need faith because we have read about God we have heard about God we have seen a lot of this being spoken of consented God and yet we have never seen him but we believe that the Lord our God is alive that God exists that is what faith does with faith you don't have to see to believe you believe then you see it praise be to God and faith covered by hearing and hearing by the Word of God the only way to have faith is by the Word of God there is no other way around it it has to be by the way of the word we love it when we see miracles signs and wonders Bible a brother said the Americas do not give faith what miracles signs and wonders do is to increase your faith so there ought to be faith to be increased if there is no faith there you will rejoice with what God is doing it will just lift you so high and the same way you are lifted so high there is the same way you are coming to crush why because there is no faith day to sustain what God has done so we love to see science we love to see miracles we don't care whether we see them or not what I would always say normally when we talk of science miracles wonders you know people think of maybe fire falling from the head skies maybe cripples getting strength in their legs and then walking others is how good but you know look at yourself look at yourself and you can see how far God has brought you what God has done in your life what bird took you from that you are America on two feets you are a living miracle a walking miracle a miracle on profits it doesn't matter whether anything else happens just know that you are a miracle on two feet praise be to God so the only way to get faith is by the way that is why we can never overemphasize the importance or they need to make sure that you are glued to the Word of God it is not when you feel like X as a matter of fact there are days now you don't want to come to church but something drives you here in the same way there are those who would even want to read your Bible find time to seek the face of God we ask for faith we ask for faith God is not going to drop it just from the skies there you go to bed one evening you wake up and your friend is right here no as simple as it is just do it make sure that you get in tune with the Word of God praise be to God now the story we just read to just highlight a little about the story now the Bible says if a brother or a sister came to you and they were naked are they were hungry oh brother I have not eaten since morning I am very very hungry I have no food no money to buy food I'm dying can you help me and then you look at the brother you look at a sister and then you told them I mean the Bible says man shall not live by bread alone so it's ok if you are hungry you know praise be to God just go God knows you need food God will provide at the right time and you are in the position to help and yet you wouldn't do it well lace your feet where lies your faith their library is naked and they come looking for help and you can send them away and not attend to their knees when you are in the position to do it where lies your fate and some of the times it is easier for us to do it to one another because we belong to the same fate because we believe the same thing but it becomes difficult when it is our next-door neighbour the person we refer to as the unbeliever we are quick to turn them down we don't even give it a second thought they come you look at them with this thing in your eyes and you know that whatever it is that you are going through you are in opposition to health and then you turn them down why because they are the so-called unbelievers you don't know who a child of God is there is no way you can tell that this is a child of God or this is not a child of God now that they don't come to I mean I don't believe what you believe probably just at that moment in time and sometimes you realize that you are not even doing yourself justice this is a neighbor you probably have lived with them for a year or two years or five years you have never never talked about God to them you have never witnessed to them and then you can tell them you can just turn around and call them unbelievers and then we are quick to turn them now sometimes we behave ourselves when we are around brethren we did them our best treatment but as soon as we get out there we're at work in our community in our household we put on a different clock and we are just like the liar ready to tear people down you know what I'm just telling you this if you ever find me and the so called unbeliever standing side by side and you have to offend any of us offend me offend me because God is going to give me enough grace not to look at you but you look at a spirit behind your action and to know that this is the devil and to deal with the spirit and not you but you know what the unbeliever would look at the unbeliever does not have that grace to see beyond so the unbeliever is looking at you I thought they said they were Christians is that how Christians behave oh no I was shocked I didn't expect him or her to behave this way you know what sometimes we give people room we give people cause to speak evil of the holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the way we behave by the things we do but it is we say we give people cause to speak evil of God and they would not look at you as an individual it come back it turns back to the church it turns back to the body of Christ and before long they are looking at every single member of that church judging them by what you as an individual do you have faith where is the way where other works faith without works is dead praise be to God now when we say we have faith in the Word of God man does not see the faith we have if you are afraid man doesn't see that faith is God who sees the faith what Marcis is the wax by the wax man is able to tell whether you have faith or not we do the wax market man cannot tell but when God looks down he sees that oh there is faith here but what man sees is the work aspect so faith and wets go hand-in-hand and I love the West 18 so much and I'm taking her again verse 18 yeah I must say a man may say thou hast faith and I have works humidified with other works and I will shew thee my faith by my works praise be to God I will show you my faith by my works so remember that way there is faith there are works that follow it and if you claim to have faith and you are not seeing the wax following the faith it's a time to seek the face of God seek the face of God this is not time to play Church we are at a very very very very very end how close we are to going home nobody knows better the days come and go we know that we are closer than we were yesterday this is the time to examine yourself by the Word of God because the Word of God is the standard the standard is no man don't look at any man let your faith be in God praise be to God the Bible says that have the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ they do not have the faith of the Lord Jesus are with a respect of patience in other ways treat all men equal treat all men equal it's just a matter of men that we tend to treat the rich with more respect if somebody just came in here dead with go long robes with a PhD we tend to treat them separately and then we look down upon people that are not fortunate enough to attend those starers do not have the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ with a respect of peasants treat all men equal faith without works is dead praise be to God now what shows that you have faith in God the Bible says by their fruits you shall know them so human beings are required to bear fruit and that is the web part of it let the people see the Word of God in you we are living in an age where the people would not even read the Bible where the people would not even go to church you know about two years ago I went with my wife and children to target the target on central 694 in central yes there is a target on the right-hand side if you are going down this way so I wanted to get some Bibles and then I looked on their bookshelves every way I didn't find Bible so I called one of those one of the guys I said I'm looking for a Bible to buy I said what I said a Bible I said what type of book is that then I said a Bible they say wait I'm coming then he went him called another person and I wonder came together he was telling the guy that this man is looking for a book I don't know what type of book that is then I told you that guy I'm looking for a Bible then I think that was no this was a lady and then she said just go to the book side that is how we have all our books if you don't find it there that means we don't have it here I said Wow in this day and age there are people who do not know what a Bible is so if they don't know what the Bible is that means that I even know what is contained in the Bible I was so shocked I was blown away at the end of the day three people come together and they didn't know what the Bible was they were asking me who was the author oh my goodness so that people are no longer reading ask them up maybe Shakespeare and those funny funny stories out there and I will tell you everything about the book and yet the book of life they don't know what the Bible is this is the time let your light shine before men that they may see your good ways and give the glory to your father which is in heaven we are living in the best moment of human history you don't need too much light to glow there's a little light in your life we'll send that darkness around you packing let your light shine let that light in you shine let the people see God in you but you know the funny thing about all this that even though these people don't know how the Bible is and obviously they don't read the Bible they know who a Christian is it's ironical that if you don't behave yourself well and you do this you shouldn't do they can't come until I thought you said you a Christian so they know a Christian is they'll know what a Christian should do they know how a piece I should behave him or herself this is where the Bible says that we are written and pistils read of all men let the word of God become flesh in you and how does the word of God become flesh in you it's by you taking the word and living by it doing what God wants you to do walking in accordance with the Word of God and then men see the wings for faith with other works is dead let them see the ways that you are living the life that you are not like one of the co-workers they are not like one of the neighbors that your life is different that they cannot touch to it even though they may disagree with you but they can attest to it that there is something peculiar about your life praise be to God so remember and now when it comes to our walk with God as I said when birth speaks all you have to do is believe when you read away all you have to do is believe I remember that God requires of you to demonstrate the faith you have in his word so when you hear a word of God and a word of birthless repent you repent repentance has become one of the most difficulties for Christians in this day and age that when we do something wrong we'll find a good reason why we should not apologize for it we would try to justify that wrong why should it be so difficult for me to go to my brother or my sister and tell them I'm very sorry I didn't mean this it was unintended forgive me why should it be something difficult repentance is a heavenly language God loves it when you hear is weight and you act upon the word let the weights follow your your your your your fate praise be to God let your let the wax follow your feet and as I was saying a short while ago again sometimes is easier when it has to be just a month but again if it is the next-door neighbor oh he's an unbeliever after all I don't owe him any apology you do you do they don't have to belong to your church they don't have to belong to your faith they don't have to believe in what you believe in if you have to repent if you have to talk to somebody make this right with somebody you go ahead and do it pretty good if you are core to baptism to give your life to Christ you don't wait you go ahead and you act upon it if you are called to separate yourself you separate yourself from sin make sure that your life is grafted on the Word of God make sure that you are living in a perfect will of God let the wets follow your face for without the wakes your faith is dead the faith is not going anywhere with God it is the wax that proved that Oh something has happened in this life with other words there is no way of telling praise be to God we walk by faith and not by sight when you look at the five senses God has given us is to help us to contact this earth not to contact God not to contact God that is why we do not serve God based on what we think if you want to serve God based on what you think and I'm also serving God based on what I think just imagine the confusion that we are going to have in this world we don't serve God based on our feelings just imagine the feelings that go through us in a day sometimes you feel you are up and anytime you feel you are down sometimes you feel healthy sometimes you are sick sometimes you don't even know how you feel praise be to God we don't serve God based on our feelings if we have to serve God based on our feelings then there is trouble we don't serve God based on the tears we see because as a matter of fact sometimes you see things that are not even there that is are not existing yet you are seeing them we don't serve God based on at least we here we serve God by faith that is why it doesn't matter the storms we go through we don't look at the size of the storms we always look at the Word of God this reminds me when a child of God came to Kadesh Barnea and Moses selected 12 generals to go as fighter from his line and combat when they went then came back with an evil report now oh we are like grasshoppers before the man this way James there is no way we can take the lines oh and the people just Irish shouting and crying Moses why have you brought us here to come and die here are there no graves in Egypt or why did you bring us here to come and die and God was so so so displeased with them God was so displeased with it does not look at the circumstances freak looks by the word faith apps on the word but praise be to God there are among the twelve there were two Joshua and Caleb who say you know what we are able to take the land let your wet follow what you profess to believe they were standing on the promise that God said he has given them the land and that was sufficient we serve God by faith and when you have faith in the Word of God that faith is going to produce a result that man would look at you and see the works and then tell that indeed you have believed there is no longer you mess up there is something in you something has taken ahold of your life praise be to God faith without works is dead not only the five senses of the body even the five senses of the Spirit we don't use the facets of the spirit to contact God we don't quote a God by our reasoning by our imagination by our memory by our affection by our conscience there is no way you can contact God with the census of your body or the senses of your spirit that is what we are call to serve my face praise be to God and faith you either have it or you don't have it and there is no way you can manufacture faith and sometimes when we talk of fake people think that you ought to have some huge fits is good if you have it there are people that are gifted in faith then when they flap your wings just once you are out of the roof and address don't flap your wings and they'll probably just go maybe 10 feet and or come back and land where they never give up they will flop again then next time maybe 12 feet they come back and alight they don't give up they flip again 15 they come back at the land they keep flapping to the flood again and you're up you're out of the roof that is what feathers faith when faith you can see the Word of God tell you that God through this dog I mean this is a dog but go through this wall you will not ask where is that dog you know ask you will forget there's no dough you will just get there and you jump through because your faith is telling you if God can tell you to go through this war then what it means is that by the time you hit that wall you are out God will not tell you something which has already made he has not made provision for already faith without works is dead I want to take something from this message a quote from the Prophet a little fella passed by I said god bless you my brother you believe he said with all my heart I said go home now and let your faith will make you home so he wasn't feeling fine he was sick pass on by like that here he come back in the line he said but Abraham you told me I was healed I am so jackin I said brother you told me you believed and he said I do I said you are not acting like that I said you are to believe what I told you he said well I do believe it I said well why are you coming back telling me you wasn't healed see how easy it is he said well fella Branham am i heal then I said yes yes sir just as you believe you are did you believe he had my prayer he told me if I'd be sincere when I prayed get the people to believe me that nothing was turned before my prayer you believe that he said yes say I believe it with all my heart I said go on he said okay he started away a few minutes here he comes back through the line said I haven't stopped yet Bela Bela I said well now look I'm not talking about when you stop now you might stop for a week or ten days or three months or four months or two years I say Abraham waited 25 years on his C is that right as scripturally you know it I said you believe what I told you he said well I don't get it brother branham I said brother they angel of God who is declaring that I told you the truth told me this if I could get the people to believe me and be sincere when I pray oh I see it I see what you mean praise be to God I'm already got a healing I'm just waiting for its toe I said that's right all right I'm healed and he went on kept saying praise God he was healed so sometimes this was in the prayer line when you are prideful sometimes we went to see the result but if you believe that you are healed right there and then you I healed and that was what the Prophet was talking about now I just think about Noah when God told Noah to build an ark and I was burning to destroy the earth with flood just think about it around that time the air surface was watered by Springs of water and bird would have made this very easy for Noah if God has said you know what at this point in time maybe the spring is coming maybe it's a gallon of water every hour but I'm going to destroy the edge with probably 100 gallons a minute Noah could have identified himself with that because that was something they saw but God was telling Noah that yours going up in the clouds that the windows of heaven there was going to be rain coming from the skies something that was very difficult to understand because it had never happened before and I believe that was what actually true many people off water coming from this guy's know it is impossible no how can it be and Noah was preaching that God was going to destroy the earth with a flood and God asked him to build an ark and Noah started building sometimes we hear the voice of God and we know what God requires of us and yet will not do it let the weights follow your feet if you believe let the weights follow your fate no wait I had anyhow he may never have understood it he didn't know what God I mean how it was going to happen but he believed God has spoken and he acted on it Noah could have said this ship looks too big it's too big and see where I'm building this ship where is the water you know what I'm going to help God let me get closer to the Atlantic Ocean or get closer to the Pacific all to the Mediterranean Sea and then build a ship along the sea so that in an event the water does not come we can probably push it in there but God does not need your help all God wants you to do is to believe just believe a lid the rest for God praise be to God faith without works is dead and your walk with God does not have to make sense praise be to God it doesn't have to it doesn't have to make sense to anybody it doesn't have to make sense to you that is why you don't have to reason out the Word of God there are things we do not because we understand we do it because we believe is the Word of God sometimes we want to wait till we understand until when it makes sense to us before we do it there is no faith in that there is no faith in that but when you are doing it because it is the Word of God that even though I don't understand even though I don't know what this means but I can find it in the scriptures I believe it is the Word of God and I'm doing it anyhow your walk with God does not have to make sense to anybody it doesn't have to make sense to you let the weights follow your confession let the weights follow your face for without weights our faith in Christ is dead something must identify you with the body of Christ it's not so much about your confession people don't listen to what you are saying no they are looking at the way you are behaving and man one time took his child in his arms and he looked at the boys face and little boy five year old and he told a boy that's turn when you grow what every step you take in life and as I looked at the father and said daddy you were justice because I'm following of your footprints so it is not so much the things you see that people are looking at is the life you are living that they are looking at they are looking every single step not just your neighbors not just your co-workers even your children at home if you say one thing and you do another ten guess what you have sent the wrong signal acts in accordance with your confession whatever you preach whatever you are talking about let them see you doing it because it is the right thing to do praise be to God the musicians can come over faith without works is dead I guess one has to look into yourself tonight a lot of people though that have good ahead of us demonstrated you have faith in Christ some paid a price one time when I was reading the Mateus of Jesus Christ I read about one English man in those days they were killing him and in fact I forgotten his name John something he was set ablaze they didn't kill him before they set him on fire he was a life when they set him on fire he was set ablaze and even in a fire when we were expecting him to be willing and shouting and crying he stood in the midst of the flames raised his hands to heaven and he stood clubs and he praised God in the flames people have died for this why do you stand with Christ tonight why do you stand there is a life that we must live there is a life that follows our confession and if that life is no following your confession it's a time to examine yourself talk to God talk to God where two or three are gathered in his name there he is just talk to God talk to go tonight now God will give you faith enough faith to believe in his word to trust in his promise to do his will to stay on grounds as a Christian and I you will not compromise on his word we don't want the favors of this world no I want to be on the loss despised view I want to be on the side of God not to be friends with this world there is a co-worker that is looking at you there is a neighbor that has his eyes on you your children are looking up to you to see whether you are working according to what you profess to believe examine yourself tonight as we go to the Lord in prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank you so much your God for how far you have brought us tonight we have just got it further to go through this Simone your prophet preached in the 50s titled faith without works is dead we know as
