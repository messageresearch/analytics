[1:09] Charles was a young man of pleasure.
[1:11] Other than her three day, Ella used a
[1:14] long flat hickory stick to stir clothes
[1:16] in the boil. New Albany lay over a 100
[1:19] miles north of Burksville. And being
[1:22] almost due to deliver, Ella dreaded the
[1:24] journey. But to three-year-old Billy,
[1:27] who had never seen beyond his mountain
[1:29] cabin, the trip seemed like an exciting
[1:31] adventure. He was especially impressed
[1:34] by the narrow, flat wooden bridge that
[1:36] crossed the Ohio River between
[1:38] Louisville, Kentucky, and New Albany,
[1:40] Indiana. Another 10 miles north brought
[1:43] them to their new home, the small town
[1:45] of Udica, Indiana.
[1:47] On May 27th, 1912, Ella bore her fourth
[1:51] son, naming him Melvin. That summer,
[1:54] Charles worked for a local farmer. It
[1:56] was man-killing labor. Sometimes he had
[1:59] to trudge behind a horse and plow for 12
[2:02] hours a day, sweating under the
[2:04] scorching sun. More than once he came
[2:07] home with his shirt sunburned into his
[2:09] back, and Ella had to cut the shirt off
[2:11] with scissors. When the corn came up,
[2:14] Charles spent his days with a
[2:15] gooseenecked hoe, chopping creepers from
[2:18] between the rows. At first his hands
[2:20] blistered and bled. Later they formed
[2:22] calluses as hard as leather. He suffered
[2:26] all this for a mere 75 cents a day. That
[2:30] fall, Charles went back to logging. It
[2:32] came to him more naturally than farming.
[2:34] He had grown up in the woods and had
[2:37] started logging at an early age.
[2:39] Although he weighed only 150 lbs,
[2:42] Charles bulged with muscles and was so
[2:44] skillful a logger that he could load a
[2:47] 900-lb log on a wagon all by himself.
[2:50] But as winter drew near, Charles grew
[2:52] uneasy. The six of them were living in a
[2:55] one room shack, no bigger and not as
[2:58] well built as the log cabin they left
[3:00] behind in Kentucky. Logging would force
[3:02] him to be away from his family for weeks
[3:05] at a time. Not wanting his wife to
[3:07] suffer like she had the last winter,
[3:09] Charles started looking for a better
[3:12] situation. Spring came in 1913 before
[3:15] Charles found something permanent. He
[3:18] got a job in Jeffersonville, Indiana,
[3:20] working for Mr. Wayan, a
[3:22] multi-millionaire who owned the Wayan
[3:24] Distilleries and was part owner of a
[3:26] professional baseball team, the
[3:28] Louisville Colonels. Charles was hired
[3:30] as a private chauffeur because he was so
[3:33] good at handling horses. The job didn't
[3:35] pay much in cash, but it offered
[3:37] substantial side benefits, namely a
[3:40] place to live rentree on Mr. Wayan's
[3:42] land. The site included a two- room log
[3:45] cabin, an old barn, a large garden spot,
[3:49] and a small field Charles could plant
[3:51] for his own profit. Also, Mr. Wayan had
[3:54] a dairy nearby, and Charles could take
[3:56] home a bucket of milk every night. No
[3:58] small benefit for a father with four
[4:00] growing boys. Jeffersonville was a town
[4:03] four miles northeast of New Albany on
[4:06] the river road locally called the Utica
[4:08] Pike. Mr. Wayan lived seven miles out of
[4:11] town on a large estate. The cabin
[4:13] Charles moved into sat on a hillside
[4:15] overlooking the Ohio
[4:18] River. Weathered boards covered the
[4:20] structures outside walls and inside mud
[4:23] filled the chinks between the logs. The
[4:25] cabin had a dirt floor, two rooms, and a
[4:28] sleeping loft in the rafters above one
[4:30] of the rooms. The ladder to the loft was
[4:33] made from two saplings. In the middle of
[4:35] the floor of one room, a sawed off stump
[4:38] had been rolled and flat rocks placed on
[4:40] top of the stump. Above this sat a wood
[4:43] stove made from an empty oil drum. For
[4:46] cooking, Ella used a little monkey
[4:48] stove. They even had a coal oil lamp for
[4:51] light. All things considered, it was a
[4:53] big improvement over the one room shanty
[4:56] that had sheltered them in Utica. On the
[4:58] hillside in front of the cabin, an apple
[5:00] tree spread its branches over a small
[5:02] spring. The cool spring water served as
[5:05] a refrigerator through much of the
[5:07] summer, keeping metal cans of milk,
[5:09] buttermilk, and butter from spoiling too
[5:11] soon. Charles couldn't keep cream there.
[5:14] He had too many little Branoms greedy to
[5:17] snitch.
[5:18] The spring supplied the house with water
[5:20] until mid August when it would finally
[5:22] grow dry. Then they would have to pump
[5:24] their water from the well located down
[5:26] by the barn and carry it up the hill to
[5:29] the
[5:30] house. Billy loved the bubbling spring.
[5:33] A gourd dipper hung on a nail pounded
[5:35] into the trunk of the apple tree, but
[5:37] Billy seldom used it. He liked to lie in
[5:40] his belly in the warm grass, put his
[5:43] lips to the water, and suck his stomach
[5:45] full. Then he would fill a jug and take
[5:47] it to his father in the field. Charles
[5:49] always came home from the field famished
[5:51] for supper. Because he didn't have
[5:53] indoor plumbing, he would wash himself
[5:55] behind the cabin, where a bench was
[5:57] built against an apple tree. The bench
[6:00] was just a barn board tacked to the
[6:02] trunk with a board at the other side for
[6:04] a leg and a slanting board underneath to
[6:07] keep the bench sturdy. All four boys
[6:09] would stand in line behind Papa to wash.
[6:12] When Charles rolled up the sleeves of
[6:14] his homemade shirt to lather up, his arm
[6:16] muscles would swell and ripple. Billy
[6:19] watched with pride, thinking, "That's my
[6:21] papa. He's strong. He'll live a hundred
[6:24] years. When I'm an old man, I'll still
[6:27] be watching my papa with big muscles."
[6:30] Charles was only 5' 7 in tall. Billy had
[6:33] inherited his father's dark wavy hair
[6:36] and Irish good looks, but not his
[6:38] powerful build. Instead, Billy was lean
[6:40] and wiry like his mother. Billy's turn
[6:43] to wash came next. He took great care to
[6:46] keep the homemade lie soap out of his
[6:48] eyes. Once had been less than enough. He
[6:51] dried with a towel his mother had made
[6:53] from an empty sack of cornmeal. The
[6:55] towel was coarse and uncomfortable, so
[6:58] Billy dabbed lightly. Above the
[7:01] washbench, a piece from a broken mirror
[7:03] was held to the tree by five bent nails.
[7:06] Billy shinnied up on the bench to see
[7:08] himself so that he could use the tin
[7:09] comb to smooth his unruly
[7:11] locks. Charles had built their dinner
[7:14] table and benches from old barn boards.
[7:16] The benches looked like church pews.
[7:18] Billy always sat next to his father at
[7:21] supper. Bean soup was standard fair
[7:23] along with cornbread, boiled onions, and
[7:26] buttermilk. Ella would bake the
[7:28] cornbread in a pan, then put it on a
[7:30] plate and send the plate around the
[7:31] table so that everyone could break off a
[7:34] piece as it passed. Billy always took a
[7:36] corner because it had lots of crust and
[7:38] he liked dipping crusty cornbread in his
[7:41] soup. On May 14th, 1914, Billy got
[7:45] another brother, Edgar Lee Brham. Over
[7:48] the next few years, Billy's life fell
[7:50] into a comfortable pattern.
[7:53] Every Saturday afternoon, his father
[7:55] borrowed a mule and a covered wagon from
[7:57] Mr. Wayan, loaded up the family, and
[8:00] traveled seven miles into town to buy
[8:02] groceries. The four youngest Brandoms
[8:04] bounced along and back in a pile of
[8:06] straw, but Billy got to ride up front on
[8:09] the buckboard with his father and
[8:10] mother. Billy was always excited about
[8:13] going to the store because he knew
[8:14] exactly what would happen. Charles, who
[8:17] earned $3.50 50 cents a week. Often
[8:20] spent $3 of this at the grocery store.
[8:23] Occasionally he splurged on a sack of
[8:25] brown sugar or salted barrel crackers,
[8:28] but mostly he bought staples like beans,
[8:30] potatoes, and cornmeal, the kind of food
[8:33] that stretched a long way. After Charles
[8:36] paid his bill, Mr. Grover the grosser
[8:38] would give him a sack of peppermint
[8:40] stick candy for his youngsters. Back in
[8:42] the wagon, five pairs of eyes watched
[8:45] anxiously as Papa divided four sticks of
[8:48] candy equally between his five boys.
[8:51] Right away, the four youngest Brandham
[8:52] sucked their peppermint sticks to a
[8:54] sliver. But Billy was shrewd. He sucked
[8:57] on his for a while, then rolled his
[8:59] candy up in a piece of brown paper torn
[9:01] from a grocery bag and tucked it in his
[9:03] pocket. He had use for it later.
[9:07] Saturday night they filled the large
[9:08] cedar washt tub with hot water and took
[9:10] their weekly baths one after another
[9:13] without changing the water. Ella
[9:15] scrubbed Billy hard with li soap,
[9:17] saying, "I want to see you get as clean
[9:19] as a peeled onion. Then she rubbed him
[9:22] dry with a mealcloth towel until it felt
[9:25] like his hide was gone." She knew Billy
[9:27] was not eating a balanced diet, so every
[9:30] week after his bath, she made him
[9:31] swallow a spoonful of castor oil, which
[9:34] she believed would help prevent colds.
[9:36] Billy looked at that big spoon filled
[9:38] with the greasy castor oil and begged,
[9:40] "Oh, mama, please don't make me take it.
[9:43] It makes me so sick. I can't stand it,"
[9:46] she answered. "If it don't make you
[9:48] sick, it won't do you any good." Billy
[9:51] held his nose, took the spoonful in his
[9:53] mouth, tried to swallow, gagged, shook
[9:56] all over, and finally managed to get it
[9:58] down. On Sunday, Ella cooked mulligan
[10:01] stew. Turnips, carrots, cabbage,
[10:04] potatoes, beans, cornmeal, and a chunk
[10:06] of beef. Everything boiled together in
[10:09] one pot. The leftovers fed them for two
[10:11] or three days. Monday, Ella washed
[10:14] clothes outside the cabin in a big iron
[10:16] kettle heated over an open fire. Billy
[10:19] being the eldest had to cut locust limbs
[10:21] for the fire. He was also expected to
[10:24] fill the kettle with water, a difficult
[10:26] chore for a boy his age and size.
[10:29] William, she called. Yes, ma'am. Go to
[10:33] the spring and get a bucket of water.
[10:35] Billy thought of how that heavy cedar
[10:38] bucket strained his shoulder even when
[10:40] it was only half full. He felt in his
[10:43] pocket for that piece of peppermint
[10:45] candy wrapped in paper. Then he found
[10:47] his brother Edward and said, "Humpy."
[10:49] Billy often called his brother Humpy,
[10:51] "I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let
[10:54] you lick on this candy until I count 10.
[10:56] If you'll go and get that bucket of
[10:58] water for me." Edward gladly fetched the
[11:01] water, and Billy rewarded him by holding
[11:03] out the peppermint stick. Billy started
[11:06] counting. 1 2 3. Edward, licking as fast
[11:10] as he could go, complained, "Not so
[11:12] fast. You're counting too fast. Start
[11:14] over." Billy started over and Edward got
[11:17] a few extra licks. Then Billy wrapped up
[11:20] the peppermint stick and put it back in
[11:22] his pocket. There were other chores to
[11:24] do on Monday, but as long as his candy
[11:26] held out, Billy was a young man of
[11:29] leisure. On wash day, Ella used a long,
[11:32] flat hickory stick to stir clothes in
[11:34] the boiling kettle, fishing them out
[11:36] when they were ready. She kept the stick
[11:38] hanging on a nail just inside the cabin
[11:41] door. That hickory paddle served many
[11:43] functions. Ella mashed lumps out of the
[11:46] straw tick mattresses with it, then
[11:48] smoothed out the bedding quilts. Charles
[11:51] also used it as a rod of
[11:53] correction. Sometimes if one of the boys
[11:55] had been bad and was expecting a
[11:57] spanking, the hickory stick would
[11:59] mysteriously disappear. Charles always
[12:02] managed to get by without it, using
[12:04] instead his razor strap made out of an
[12:07] old belt, or else the ram rod from his
[12:09] rifle. All the little Branoms got an
[12:12] education out in the woodshed, running
[12:15] around their father as hard as they
[12:17] could go while he whipped their bottoms
[12:19] red. Charles called this beating the
[12:22] devil out of them. On one occasion,
[12:24] Edward hatched a mischievous plan.
[12:27] Billy, he said, Mama and Papa are hoing
[12:29] in the garden. If you go in and get some
[12:32] sugar, I'll get the crackers and I'll
[12:34] meet you in the barn. It sounded fair
[12:36] enough to Billy. Ella kept the brown
[12:39] sugar in a box in a cabin. She often
[12:41] mixed it with water to make molasses for
[12:43] their breakfast pancakes. Billy slipped
[12:46] into the cabin, dug out a big handful of
[12:48] sugar, and started for the barn. The
[12:51] garden was halfway down the hill between
[12:53] the house and the barn. Charles
[12:55] straightened up from his hoe, wiping his
[12:57] forehead with his red and white
[12:58] checkered handkerchief. He noticed his
[13:01] oldest son walking with his forearm as
[13:03] stiff as if he were hiding something.
[13:06] Charles said, "Where are you going,
[13:08] William?" "I'm going down to the barn."
[13:11] "What have you got in your hand?" Billy
[13:14] thought, "Uh-oh." He tried to be
[13:16] evasive. "Which hand?" Charles said,
[13:18] "Come here." Billy didn't want any more
[13:21] sugar for a long time after
[13:24] that. Late in August of 1916, after a
[13:27] steam powered threshing machine had
[13:29] finished processing the grain crops,
[13:31] Ella stuffed new straw into all her tick
[13:33] mattresses. That night, shortly after
[13:35] the boys were sent to bed in the loft,
[13:37] Billy screamed as if a banshee had
[13:39] touched his cheek. Ella dashed to the
[13:42] ladder and called, "Billy, what on
[13:44] earth's wrong with you?" "Mama, there's
[13:46] something in bed with me. It's just a
[13:49] grasshopper trapped in the new straw.
[13:51] Now, settle down and go to sleep."
[13:54] "Mama, I can't go to sleep with that
[13:56] critter jumping around in there." Ella
[13:58] took the coal oil lamp in hand and
[14:00] climbed up to the loft so Billy could
[14:02] see to open the side of his tick, dig
[14:05] around in the fresh straw, and find the
[14:07] offending grasshopper. He let it go
[14:10] outside by pushing it through a crack
[14:12] where the roof did not butt evenly with
[14:14] the wall. Later, Ella chuckled about the
[14:16] incident when she told it to Charles,
[14:19] but she could not tell her husband about
[14:21] her deep concern for Billy. The boy had
[14:23] been edgy lately, and his food wasn't
[14:25] setting right. More than once in the
[14:27] past month, he had complained of an
[14:29] upset stomach after supper and of
[14:31] burping up stomach acid. Was he nervous
[14:34] because he would soon start school, or
[14:36] was something else bothering him? Could
[14:39] it be connected with his father's
[14:40] drinking? In September, Billy and Edward
[14:43] started school together. Billy was 7 and
[14:46] 1/2 years old. Although he was 11 months
[14:48] older than his brother Edward in size
[14:51] they could have passed for twins. Edward
[14:53] was just a smidgen shorter. Billy had no
[14:56] clothes for school. Through the summer
[14:58] he had gone barefoot and without a
[15:00] shirt, wearing a pair of patched and
[15:02] tattered bib overalls. The family could
[15:04] not afford new clothes, so Ella
[15:07] improvised. She took the coat Charles
[15:09] had worn in their wedding day, cut it
[15:11] up, and sewed together a pair of pants.
[15:14] Charles came home with white socks and a
[15:16] used pair of tennis shoes that barely
[15:18] fit, and that completed Billy's
[15:20] wardrobe. When Ella finished dressing
[15:22] him for his newest adventure, she said,
[15:25] "There, now let's have a look at you."
[15:27] She stood back for perspective. His bare
[15:30] ribs made him look so small and skinny.
[15:32] He looked so backward with his shaggy
[15:34] hair hanging down his neck, his homemade
[15:37] trousers, and his secondhand tennis
[15:39] shoes. Ella smiled and said, "If you
[15:42] don't look like a windy Kuckian, she had
[15:45] done the best she could with what she
[15:46] had." Unfortunately, her oldest son
[15:49] would have to go to school without a
[15:51] shirt. So, on a chilly morning in
[15:53] September of 1916, Billy and Edward
[15:56] trudged down the river road to Udica
[15:58] Pike School, which was a typical rural
[16:01] one- room schoolhouse set among the
[16:03] hills in view of the Ohio River. Mrs.
[16:05] Temple would be his teacher for many
[16:07] years. She taught all eight grades with
[16:10] students ranging in age from 6 to 15. In
[16:13] school, Billy learned more than the
[16:15] three Rs of reading, writing, and
[16:17] arithmetic. Suddenly, his view of the
[16:19] world expanded. As he sat in class, he
[16:22] had time to compare himself with the
[16:24] other children. The differences shouted
[16:26] at him. These were country boys and
[16:28] girls like himself, but most of them
[16:30] wore nice clothes and shoes that fit,
[16:33] and they all wore shirts. For lunch, the
[16:36] other children ate sandwiches and had
[16:38] cookies or cake for dessert. Billy ate
[16:40] beans, and some days he had no lunch at
[16:43] all. He began to realize his family was
[16:46] poor. From the first, Billy was branded
[16:49] as an outsider by the older boys. They
[16:51] called him a corn cracker and teased him
[16:54] because he talked funny with a hillbilly
[16:56] accent typical of the Kentucky Mountain
[16:58] folks. And they laughed at him for
[17:00] looking so ragged. A few weeks after
[17:03] school started, Billy and some other
[17:05] boys his own age decided to spend an
[17:07] afternoon fishing at the ice pond behind
[17:09] the Brham's cabin. They called it the
[17:12] ice pond because Mr. Wayan cut blocks of
[17:14] ice from it every winter, stored the
[17:16] blocks in sawdust, then used them during
[17:19] the summer to keep ice boxes cold in his
[17:21] dairy. Billy was thrilled that these
[17:23] boys included him in their plans. Not
[17:26] only did he love to fish, but he longed
[17:28] to be part of the gang. After school,
[17:31] Billy ran home, eager to get his
[17:33] homemade fishing pole down from the
[17:34] loft. His tennis shoes did not fit well
[17:37] and had caused a painful corn to form on
[17:39] his big toe. That day in school, he had
[17:42] been preoccupied with the corn. Each
[17:44] time he moved his foot, the corn
[17:46] tortured him so much he could not keep
[17:48] his mind on his schoolwork. Now, in his
[17:51] excitement and haste, he easily ignored
[17:53] the pain. He dashed into the cabin and
[17:56] had just placed a foot on the sapling
[17:58] ladder when a powerful hand gripped his
[18:01] shoulder. His father turned him around.
[18:04] Billy, I've got an important job for you
[18:06] to do this afternoon. I want you to pack
[18:09] water up to the stills for me. Billy's
[18:11] heart and limbs petrified. But Papa, I
[18:14] was going to go fishing with my buddies
[18:16] this afternoon. You can go fishing
[18:19] tomorrow. I'm fixing to run off a batch
[18:21] of corn whiskey tonight and I'm behind.
[18:24] I've got to have enough water in the
[18:25] shed to keep those coils cool. You're
[18:28] old enough to work, and I've got to have
[18:30] your help. The buckets are down by the
[18:33] barn, sitting next to the pump. Now get
[18:35] on up and change your clothes. I'll be
[18:37] out back in the shed getting the stills
[18:39] ready. Slowly, Billy started up the
[18:42] ladder, turning his head so his father
[18:45] would not see his tears. And remember,
[18:47] Charles added, "Keep, Mom. Not a word
[18:50] about this to anyone." "Yes, Papa."
[18:53] Although national prohibition would not
[18:55] be voted in until
[18:57] 1919, certain states had anti-licker
[19:00] laws in place as early as
[19:02] 1906. In 1916, Indiana was already a dry
[19:06] state. Charles could not do without his
[19:09] whiskey. Since he did not have enough
[19:11] money to buy it on the black market, he
[19:14] and a neighbor, Mr. Dornbush, fabricated
[19:17] a moonshine still in the shed behind the
[19:19] house to cook up their own homemade
[19:21] brew. After selling their leftovers to
[19:23] thirsty neighbors and pocketing a little
[19:25] extra money, they had decided to build a
[19:28] second still. Tonight they were going to
[19:30] fire up both stills, and everything had
[19:33] to be ready. Billy sat in his straw tick
[19:36] mattress for a long time, feeling the
[19:38] corn on his foot throb with each beat of
[19:40] his heart. Eventually, he roused the
[19:42] strength to change. With great relief,
[19:45] he yanked off his shoes. Slipping out of
[19:48] his school pants, he wiggled into his
[19:50] old bib overhauls. The cloth shoulder
[19:53] straps were missing, and now the
[19:54] overalls were held up by twine with
[19:57] nails for buttons. The nails slipped
[19:59] easily through the button holes in the
[20:01] bib, and when turned sideways, did not
[20:04] come out. Next, he stumped his toe,
[20:07] which meant he took a corn cob and tied
[20:09] it under his painful toe to keep it out
[20:11] of the dirt. Slowly he climbed down the
[20:14] ladder and plotted down the hill to the
[20:16] well by the barn. Two molasses buckets
[20:19] were sitting next to the pump shaft.
[20:21] Billy pumped them full. Each bucket held
[20:24] half a gallon of water, and it was all
[20:26] his seven-year-old muscles could do to
[20:28] lift them by their makeshift twine
[20:31] handles. That afternoon was warm and
[20:33] perfectly calm. Not a breath of air
[20:36] stirred the dry yellow grass. As Billy
[20:38] started at the path, he heard laughter
[20:40] coming from the ice pond not far away.
[20:43] His buddies were already there fishing,
[20:46] joking, having a good time. Billy's
[20:49] disappointment broke loose in a flood of
[20:51] tears. Halfway up the hill next to the
[20:54] garden, Billy sat down to rest under the
[20:56] shade of a large silver popppler tree.
[20:59] Muddy streaks marked his cheeks where
[21:01] the tears had dribbled. he moaned. Isn't
[21:04] it horrible all those boys out there
[21:07] fishing and I have to stay home and pack
[21:10] water? He heard a sound like leaves
[21:12] rustling in the
[21:15] wind. But Billy couldn't feel a breeze.
[21:18] He thought, "What's that?" And he looked
[21:21] around. The leaves, which had just
[21:23] started to turn brown, stood perfectly
[21:25] still. Nowhere could he see even a hint
[21:28] of wind. He continued his sulking. their
[21:31] papas don't do this. Why should I have
[21:34] to pack water to these moonshine stills?
[21:37] He could hear the leaves blowing again.
[21:40] Standing up, he looked up into the
[21:42] branches above him, but he couldn't see
[21:44] anything moving. He squalled out a few
[21:47] more complaints, then picked up his
[21:49] buckets and started up the lane, his
[21:51] stumped toe leaving a peculiar track
[21:53] behind him on the dirt path. He had
[21:56] walked only a short way when he heard
[21:58] that noise
[21:59] again. Louder than before. Billy turned
[22:03] and this time he saw it. A whirlwind
[22:06] stirred in the branches halfway up the
[22:08] tree. That in itself was not peculiar.
[22:11] Whirlwinds were common in the fall. He
[22:13] had often seen them spinning through
[22:15] fields, picking up dried leaves and
[22:17] carrying them along. But those
[22:19] whirlwinds were always traveling
[22:21] somewhere, always moving across the
[22:23] ground. This whirlwind seemed to be
[22:25] caught in one place. Fascinated, Billy
[22:28] watched the green, brown, and yellow
[22:30] leaves rustle and swirl. Suddenly, a
[22:32] voice boomed from the tree, a deep,
[22:35] resonant voice saying, "Don't ever drink
[22:38] or smoke or defile your body in any way.
[22:42] There will be a work for you to do when
[22:43] you get older." Billy heard the words as
[22:46] clearly as if his father was talking,
[22:49] but it was not his father's voice. He
[22:52] had never heard such an awesome voice
[22:54] before. Dropping his buckets, he took
[22:56] off running for the cabin, screaming
[22:58] with all his lungs. Ellis scooped him up
[23:01] in her arms. "Billy, what is it? Did you
[23:05] get snake bit?" She thought that perhaps
[23:07] walking past the garden, her son had
[23:09] stepped on a copperhead, a poisonous
[23:11] snake common in that country. "No,
[23:14] ma'am," he babbled, pointing down the
[23:16] hill towards the garden. "There's a man
[23:18] in that tree down there." Oh, Billy.
[23:21] Billy, come on. Did you stop and go to
[23:24] sleep? No, ma'am. There's a man in that
[23:27] tree, and he told me not to drink or
[23:29] smoke. Ella laughed at this. She hugged
[23:32] her son and kissed his forehead, trying
[23:34] to soothe his nerves. But Billy stayed
[23:36] hysterical and would not calm down. She
[23:40] put him to bed, then hurried to the
[23:41] nearest neighbor who had a telephone and
[23:43] called the doctor. After hearing the
[23:45] story, this doctor said, "The boy's just
[23:48] nervous. He'll get over it. That night,
[23:51] Billy repeated his story at supper.
[23:53] There's a man in that tree, and I heard
[23:56] what he told me. I ain't never going by
[23:59] there again, and he never did. From that
[24:02] day on, whenever he went to the barn, he
[24:04] would bypass the popppler tree, circling
[24:06] around the far side of the
[24:08] garden. Two weeks later, Billy and
[24:11] Edward were up in front of the cabin
[24:12] playing marbles under the apple tree,
[24:14] when suddenly Billy felt something
[24:16] peculiar come over him. a pressure that
[24:19] set his skin tingling as though some
[24:21] type of unseen energy had surrounded
[24:23] him. He looked up. Somehow the Ohio
[24:26] River seemed closer than it had before.
[24:29] As Billy gazed down the river towards
[24:31] Jeffersonville, the wilderness changed
[24:33] in front of his eyes. A bridge formed up
[24:36] off the banks, spanning the river, piece
[24:39] by piece, being built in fast motion. It
[24:43] was not like the low, flat bridges he
[24:45] had crossed when he had moved to
[24:46] Indiana. This bridge looked huge with a
[24:49] vast iron trust arch overhead. Billy had
[24:53] never seen anything like it before.
[24:55] Looking closer, he noticed men working
[24:57] high up on the
[24:59] superructure. Then he saw a span break.
[25:02] Men tumbled off the beam in slow motion.
[25:05] Billy counted them as they fell. He
[25:07] watched 16 men disappear into the murky
[25:10] water below. Dropping his bag of
[25:12] marbles, Billy took off for the house,
[25:14] screaming
[25:15] uncontrollably. Ella did her best to
[25:18] calm him down. When he finally could
[25:20] tell his story, she said, "Billy, you
[25:22] just dreamed it." Billy insisted, "No,
[25:26] Mama, I got this funny feeling, and then
[25:28] I looked up at the river, and I looked
[25:31] right at it. I seen it. Oh, mama, I'm
[25:34] scared." Charles gave his opinion. The
[25:37] boy's just nervous, like the doctor
[25:39] said. But Ella was not so sure. She
[25:42] remembered a day four years earlier when
[25:45] Billy had babbled something about a bird
[25:47] telling him they would live near New
[25:48] Albany. Oddly enough, that had come
[25:51] true. A bridge across the river, 16 men
[25:55] dying. What if someday it happened? Ella
[25:58] wrote the incident down, thinking,
[26:00] "We'll see.
