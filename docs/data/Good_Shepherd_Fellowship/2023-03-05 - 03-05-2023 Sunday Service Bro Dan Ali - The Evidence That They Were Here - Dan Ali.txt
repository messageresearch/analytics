know if you have any visitors in our gates but um just feel at home there are no visitors here this is the house of God Be Free To Worship um that I I overheard with a Lawrence um talking about why is this service is canceled so and I know a lot of you took this on on um on Wednesday and also um I overheard him reading uh the meetings for this weekend so remember Friday 10th 7 30 service starts um Saturday 11 7 30 P.M service starts and again Sunday 12 11 A.M as usual God bless you all yes it's a wonderful time to always gather before the Lord um last Thursday when I went to work I knew I wasn't going to work on Friday so before I closed I printed a message I thought I was going to talk about today so and after printing it um I started going through it and it just don't know me that no this is not a message then I printed two more messages so I had three messages so I knew for sure that I was going to pick one of them then before Sunday before before before Friday morning I knew that I was not going to talk about any of them yeah so I just kept thinking and thinking my wife was on the other side talking and showing me something on the phone and all I was doing is hmm yes yes my attention was far away praise be to God now you'll be wondering how would you know that this is not what you talk about I don't know how to explain it though I don't know how to explain it but you pick something you are very sure that this is what you want to talk about or this is what the Lord is leading to talk about and all of a sudden it's like um it's like your tie is deflated something something just happens so I just Friday I started just thinking and normally I would have everything typed out printed out laid out by praise be to God today I am here with something I have just written back and forth I wouldn't say I don't have any notes I have notes Here praise be to God yeah but I'll be going back and forth if you ask me how is the service going to be today all I will tell is that I don't know praise be to God but one thing I do believe that God knows the needs there is in the house if you have prayed up and you are here to hear from God I assure you that you are going to hear from God there is no doubt it's not coming to preach you a good message no that is not the essence I don't think any Minister will come here and then just to preach you a good message no I don't think that is what it is about whatever the need is in the house it's our prayer this morning that the almighty God will address them I don't know we may be living the one and going after the 99 today oh probably we are living the 99 side and we are going after the one I don't know praise be to God so if you have prayed up and if you are in expectation I Believe by the grace of God you are going to hear from God this morning praise God it's always heartwarming as Lawrence said when Believers come together you know if or nothing at all to know that you are doing well and that you are you are you are you are at your personal Duty praise be to God so once again you are all warmly welcome and I would have us without wasting time it looks like it's going to be a very short service again I don't know praise Beauty God yes I pray God helps us shall we please stand for the reading of the word we are reading from Genesis 1. Genesis 1 26 and 27. Genesis 1 26 and 27. I read and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cuddle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them praise be to God and then let's just go to 2 7. Genesis 2 7. right there and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we please be seated praise God so from the scriptures we have just read God said let us make man in our own image and the image of God God is a spirit so God created man a spirit man after his own likeness now when you read failure the Bible says after God had done with creation everything was good everything was perfect God rested and God found Man Out of the Dust of the Earth and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul why because there was no man on the face of the Earth to till the Earth so God found Man Out of the Dust of the Earth now the spirit man God had created remember brother said that God had several attributes and one of the attributes of God was to be a savior now that Spirit man God created that man couldn't fall he was in the nature of God he couldn't fall I don't care what happens that man couldn't fall so there was absolutely no way God was going to realize that attribute of being a savior so God takes that man and puts him in that flesh it was not your desire to come into this flesh it was not your plan it was not about you you come in flesh had nothing to do with you it had everything to do with God because God wanted to be a savior and without men falling or without anything happening for God to salvage the situation he couldn't be a savior so you coming into this life because the Bible says there is sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was I shaping and I come into this life speaking what lies so every man that was born in this flesh was born into sin so when you come into this life and you are going around and committing crimes here and there jumping through Windows going to the nightclubs commit stealing here and there or as a matter of fact sometimes we just pass by something maybe you don't even pick it that thing will just jump and stick to your hand praise be to God that was how good some of us were why sin had just taken over and it had nothing to do with you it was so because God wanted you to see his glory it was like that little boy that was born blind at Birth the disciples asked the Lord Jesus Christ that is it by his fault I mean the father's fault or the mother's fault that further sin did Mother sin that was why this child was born blind he said no it was not because his father sinned it was not because his mother sinned it was not because they did something wrong but it was so because God wanted them to see his glory and you coming in human flesh coming in human flesh being under born in the bondage of sin committing evil and crimes and sin was because God wanted you to see his glory and as many of us that God has delivered we can testify it to it today we can testify to the glory of God that the Lord our God is a mighty God he is the chain breaker that is those circumstances that is beyond him I don't know about you as I've said timing again I can look behind me and I can tell how far God has brought me praise be to God it was so so man would see the glory of God now man is the most complex living organism that is on his face F surface as the prophet of God said man is a Triune being you have the flesh or the body you have the spirit and you have a soul there are five senses that the body has that governs the body and that only helps you in your natural environment in this physical world you can see you can hear you can smell you can taste and you can feel is just to be able to contact this F surface when you lose this senses you lose your environment just lose one of them and you'll realize that life is no more the same and to the spirit there are also five senses reasoning imagination affection memory and conscience and God has given five cents to the spirit to contact the spirit world now remember that the kingdom of God is not a physical Kingdom it's a spiritual Kingdom but you cannot use the five senses of the spirit to contact God and that is the mistake a lot of us make that we try to contact God using the five senses of our spirit which is wrong there is only one one thing God has given man that God can be contacted and that is faith that is why the Bible says that without faith it is impossible for any man to please God that is why when you are coming to God you must first believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him without faith you can never please God that is the only thing that can that that can get in contact with the Throne of God that when you come before the Throne of God by faith heaven knows that a child of God is taken wherever you are when you cry out God hears your cry it doesn't matter how many people are calling he can this he hears that distinct voice praise be to God and he knows oh I have a sheep that is crying for help praise God so man in the soul of man God knew the hostile environment his children were going to go through so God prepared you in advance in advance it was God's design implementation he didn't have to come back to operate upon you to do something different but everything you needed for this journey God placed it right in here all you need to overcome God has given it to you already it is to you everything you need to overcome God has given it to you if you are doing anything wrong it is a choice you have made there are no excuses if there is anything wrong you are doing you know it is contrary to the word of God you know it is evil you know it is Unbecoming of a child of God it is a choice you have made but everything you need to overcome God has given it to you and that seed of life that seed of life God has placed in you gods that gems seed of life that seed is lying the dormant just waiting for its time of manifestation like any seed take the mango seed for one when you take a mango seed everything the mango needs to be in his lifetime is in that seed praise be to God the height of the tree how big is going to be the shape of the mango fruits how sweet or how big how sour is going to be is all in that in that seed whether when the mango gets ripe is going to be yellow it's going to be violet is going to be red it's all it's all represented in that fruit the aroma is all in there everything the mango needs is right in the seed and everything you need to overcome God knowing what you are going to go through before the foundation of the earth God has placed it in that seed of life it is right in here praise be to God it is not now God is going to do it he has already done it a lot of the times we lack consciousness you never know what you have and you never know who you truly are until that jam seed of life is struck by the word and it begins to live then that Godly consciousness begin to come in then you begin to realize who you truly are you are not the man that is sitting here you are not you we are the Genesis Genesis 1 Genesis 2 7 is a man that is standing here but you are not seeing the murder of Genesis 1 26. and that is the real you that man that couldn't fall praise be to God that man that couldn't fall you are not who you think you are but when that realization begins to come in and you begin to realize who you are and you begin to get conscious of the things of God things begin to change around your life but before then that seed is lying down there dormant all those years you go climbing people's properties in the night all those years you go doing things you shouldn't do that seed is dying there very dormant but as soon as this time of manifestation comes the Bible says when the prophet of God says when the deep colors there is a deep to respond you can be a thousand people sitting down but when you hear the word it stress you you know that something has changed and when that Godly Consciousness begin to strike look when you go out there and you look at the skies all you see is God when you look at the trees all you see is God when you see the bird flying in the air all you see is God you become so conscious of God then when you take a step you know that God is there you don't have to say it to believe it you know for a fact that he is dead like that story about that lady whose father was living with her and uh she wanted to have a party with her lady friends and um she went and told his daddy her Daddy Daddy ah my lady friends are coming here we are going to have a little party but you know you don't want to mess up with those ladies that that he said no no no no I don't want to mess up with them just do your own thing and then he takes his daddy puts him in another room somewhere and then he gives the daddy an atlas why because daddy will get up take his Bible he will read his Bible and that he will just be praising God shouting hallelujah thank you Jesus so now she was going to have a party she didn't want Daddy to mess that party up so she takes that in a different room who's daddy there and she wouldn't give Daddy his Bible gives the daddy an atlas so daddy takes the atlas the friends come they are somewhere in the house a study here yeah he's here is that you know going to this no no no I gave him mom Atlas if he has his Bible then we are in trouble but Daddy has an atlas we are fine so oh smart girl high five praise the Lord and then they just sat down they were having a good time Daddy was upstairs he opened his Atlas a year of open his Atlas Africa open his Atlas Asia just got to a place he just saw the sea and as he was reading the footnotes he says that the sea is bottomless then he is red praise the Lord thank you Jesus and they said what is happening upstairs they say ah I don't know apparently there's something going on they run upstairs get to Daddy Daddy what's going on he said come and see come and see he said Daddy it's an atlas he said yeah but come and see let's see say what about the sea he says say the sea is bottomless yes Daddy what about it he says the Bible says my sis my sins are cut into the sea of forgetfulness and they are still sinking I have believed the Lord 20 years 40 years 60 years my sins are still sinking praise be to God that is how conscious you get when you are sealed in with God every step you take you see nothing but God praise be to God life is no longer about you but about Christ Godly consciousness will take you away from a lot of troubles the reason why we do certain things is because we lack that consciousness the reason why we can sit and do nothing but gossip all day it's because we lack that consciousness the reason why we go out of our place to go to places that children of God should not go is because we lack that Consciousness the reason why we keep Fellowship that we shouldn't be keeping is because we lack that consciousness there was a story about a father there was Hunger and the father didn't have money to buy food there was not even food to buy so the father went to the bush and went and surveyed and he saw somebody's Farm how many people know cassava beautiful for those of who don't know what cassava is it's a root crop that tree can grow up to this height you have to hold a tree to pull it up so he took his son it's amazing what peace and parents can treat their children say come on let's go they say daddy where are we going just follow me take that back put it under your armpit don't let anybody see it and that he was in front with his machete and then they get to the farm daddy said you know what stand here and then say when I say here when I do this watch if you see anybody coming just let me know if I do this let's if there's anybody coming let me know say okay Daddy the boy didn't know what that he was going to do daddy enters the farm and then he still was looking at the boy and then Daddy had a cassava tree daddy daddy and the daddy just jumped look it's not an easy thing to be a tiffo it's not an easy thing it's not an easy thing I remember those days I was born and bred in the barracks oh my goodness oh my that was really bad I was really bad I go in the night and I climb people's properties I go in the day and I survey all the barracks and I know where their right ones are so in the night I come I I know where I'm going I enter people sugarcane Farms anything and sometimes you are typical and then you step on on a stick and it will trigger something and then your heart will almost come into your mouth the father just jumped he thought somebody was coming why is somebody's wrong he said Daddy then he went to the boy what is wrong the boy says Daddy you said I should look here and I should look there but he didn't ask me to look upstairs then Daddy said bad boy bad boy let's go home start a knocking his head your hunger will kill you hunger will kill you the day was ashamed we need children like that that would it would due respect s while the daddy is wrong daddy you are wrong that's why the word of God says we need to arrest like that that will deal respect would put your parents in line we need brothers and sisters that will look at you in the face and tell you this is wrong according to the word of God praise be to God Hello Kitty let's go let's go they never died of hunger anyway but father came back to his senses what we lack is that consciousness sometimes you think your God is sleeping sometimes you think he's traveled sometimes you think you have hidden so much that you can do it and get away with it but it is going to wait for you somewhere if you don't place it under the blood it's going to catch up with you someday you either expose it now or it is going to expose you then sin is a dangerous thing never entertain sin in your life sin is a reproach to any people anything you know is evil stay away from it for the bible say that they that name of the name of the Lord should apart from iniquity do not let it be mentioned among you do not turn the grace of God into this grace if God out of Grace has delivered you you should be thankful enough to live a life of consecration praise be to God sometimes that is just all we need to stay in cause on course that you know I am not alone here because the Bible says so and the word of God is true I will never leave you enough forsake you I would be with you always that you know that God is here God is present praise be to God I had that testimony from sis Christine talking about a bus hit her car sometimes you hear some of these stories and the end is just terrible but whatever you find yourself as an as a child of God God has given his angels charge over you before the situation happens they are there already we are not alone Saints we are not alone we are not alone praise be to God the Lord our God is in our midst never think you are alone never think you can just do anything no you can't just do anything we have a place we are going to the Bible says we already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus we are Heaven bound praise be to God man is a complex creature that is a part of man that is having bound and there is a part of man that is Earthly bound there is a part of man that is of god and there is a part of men that is of the devil this flesh can never be redeemed there is a part of man that is redeemable you are real you and there is a part of man that is irredeemable it can never be redeemed it doesn't matter how much Holy Ghost you are filled with this flesh can never be redeemed don't let the flesh drag you you drag it along that crackers it is drag it and when that comes when that time comes for you to live you are abandon it and go praise be to God what are we talking about today I even forgot to tell my title the title of my message praise be to God the title of my message the evidence that they were here that is the title of my message the evidence that they were here there were two missionaries you know the good thing about Christianity now when God does something in your life you want the world to know about it as a Christian that have tasted of God that knows how awesome your God is how Mighty your God is that you have all the promises of a son you want you want to extend that to others you don't want to be you don't want to be selfish this missionaries went far beyond their country into a hidden Nation to go and preach about the Lord to talk about the Lord and there they both took ill and they died and the the people that had believed the message just bury them and then they built a monument and then they wrote on it this is the evidence that they put their names there this is the evidence that they were here now they took the message and they started propagating the message talking about the antonyms of God they didn't know much by the little they knew they just started you don't have to know too much to be able to share it's just like somebody who says Let Me Wait Till I I become a millionaire before I started sharing even when you become a millionaire you will not share let me wait till I become a billionaire you become a billionaire then you become very stingy yes sharing is just part of Christianity and what happened that took the message they didn't know much the little that they knew they just went around house to house sharing and people started converting and guess what not too long after that people in the city got offense got offended by it and they said no you guys are teaching our children's strange goals you are taking our children from our customs from our traditions and you are teaching them something strange and a startup executing them and they couldn't stand the persecution and they finally had to live and when they were living let's start together and they ask themselves where are we going they said we do not know by the god in whom we have believed we direct us which way to go by faith Again by faith they took a step of faith and for every time you take a step of faith praise be to God if your intentions are good if your motives are right God will never put you to shame and then they went went the people were just laughing don't mind them they will come back they went went months years they never saw them that was just the end nobody knew where they were nobody knew where they went nobody knew how far they went but they were gone they never came back now the younger Generations came and they had the story and life was not good in the village and they said you know what says this once went and they never came back it means that life is better on that side but how do we got to know why they went that was a million dollar question so one day one of these guys went out on a Hunting Expedition and then he saw a stone with coordinates out of curiosity they started following it for weeks and then he saw another Stone then he said oh I have gotten the clue I have gotten the clue because they left behind a clue their people in the village thought he was dead he was moored by an animal they performed this funeral and shortly after that here the man comes where have you been and then he tells them the story he said you know what I am ready to leave this town I am going to look for them and he got some people to come with him and then they moved just following the trail following the trail following the direction following the compass it's just like a compass that when a plane is in the air you don't have to be a the pilot if if I'm a pilot and I'm going to I'm going to Japan I don't have to know what Japan is all I just have to do is plug in the coordinates or put the CD in when I go out there the compass is going to lead me they were just following the compass following the direction and then they got to a place and they saw that oh people have settled here before they could see the Mad houses roofed with touch they had um orange Plantation they had fruits and they could see half I don't know how many people know what they have is it's a place where you bend you bend firewood how many people are with me very good they could see it and evidence that they were there they did not see them but there was an Evidence that they were there so they camped and then they revealed the place and they settled and they started feeding on the fruits they had planted life was good but then the people had a motto that life is good but it's better on the other side so the people after some time said you know what this is the motto that life is good here but it's better on the other side you know what we are going to move and some people said no let's just settle here this place is good and the Elder said no if it was not good for them it's not good for us and they moved on for a very long time they'll go to the second place again they settled life was good but they had to move again tell the god to the Final Destination till they've got to what was supposed to be their final destination they they saw a whole Township a whole Township but there was nobody and there they decided to settle there they decided to settle now when they settled they saw that a cross a huge cross was put up and on the cross they all wrote their names they all wrote their names and this was the message this was the message For the Love of Christ we have moved on leaving behind everything enjoy them but don't let them hold you down do not let them hold you down praise be to God and I want to remind us this morning that in this journey of Life must especially for the young ones that as you go through this journey of life you are going to get to different stages of your life that you get to a place that life is so good remind yourself that even though it is good it's always better on the other side enjoy it as much as you can don't let it hold you down move on with God and as you move on you would realize that you get to another place which is even much better you'll be moving in stages these stages till you get to a place where you realize all your dreams all your dreams have come true that five-star life you are looking for it has come this is where you have to keep reminding yourself that even though it is good here is better on the other side enjoy it as much as you can don't let it hold you down praise be to God keep reminding yourself Who You Are don't let it hold you down to serve God there are a lot of things you would have to leave behind you have to leave them behind we come into this life we test sentences from our our our ancestral lineage from our mother's side from our father's side and then when we go into life we ourselves add some and then you are walking and you can't even walk well because you have a lot of things to drag behind you you have to leave them behind in order to be able to work with God you can't drag them along you can't either the way of God or it's your way it cannot be both your way in the way of God to serve God there are a lot of things you have to leave behind you would have to leave your customs and your Traditions behind you will have to leave your pride behind behind you will have to leave behind everything every iniquity like the Rich Young Ruler who came to the Lord what must I do to be said to have salvation he was very very rich and the Lord Jesus has told him go sell everything you have give it to the poor and come back and follow me a lot of the times it is not something oh that is very easy to do away with a lot of the times is something you cherish something you are really holding on something you esteem and that is what Christ wants that thing that you think you can only you cannot let go it is what is in your way if you can let go of it and let Christ be life will be different preserve God to serve God you have to let go a lot of things you have to learn to forgive you have to learn to let go what sin is it that cannot be forgiven you have to let go seek peace with all men praise be to God so we according to this life no chance not just to pass through we are called not just to pass through oh I'm just passing through there is nothing like that for a child of God oh I came and I'm gone no we are called to leave behind footprints we have to leave behind and evidence that we were here that when you are gone 10 20 30 40 years people will look at that evidence you have left behind and so oh so so and so sister sister and soul brother was here because this is the evidence she left behind like brother one last two Sundays I believe was talking about uh the blind the blind uh musician the lady that was born blind very good she is dead and gone I believe good but she has left behind an Evidence that she was here if not we wouldn't be talking about her she has impacted the world she has changed people's lives she has given people hope there is an Evidence that she was here we never got to see her but we know from the evidence that behind that she was here praise be to God so we are not called just to come and walk through there is no place for people that you who just want to walk through we are called to leave behind footprints praise be to God Moses left behind footprints he left an Evidence we can take it from The Book of Genesis all through if we want to talk about people that have left behind Footprints people that have left an evidence that they were here I don't know one man talking about it two months will not even bring it to an end so we are not going to attempt in any way from a ship to deal with all that but I'll just pick one or two that Moses we all know how he ended up in Pharaoh's house and with all that upbringing with The Prestige the fame the position the pegs he was on the list to becoming the nest in rank as a pharaoh and then with all that he looks through the window and he sees the Church of Israel in the pits just working themselves out with a Taskmaster standing behind them with his long wave and then he looks at them and he tells himself even though it is good here from the story I have heard from Mama because his mother told him you are born to be a deliverer hey he knows about his God that led him to kill that Egyptian and he looks at them even though life is good here even though I am comfortable here even though I am going to be the next Pharaoh but life is better on the other side praise be to God he didn't let that to pin him down he did not allow that to hold him down praise be to God the Lord Jesus Christ himself when he came into this life he left his glory from his glory above he came into a human flesh just pave a way for you and me can you imagine if he had not come who wouldn't be here this morning we wouldn't be talking about him this morning we wouldn't be talking about salvation this morning we will not talk about the Rapture this morning if he had not come to die for our sins he paid the price so we should go scot-free our Lord and our savior Jesus he chose to die it was a choice he made he could have chosen not to he could have chosen not to why would you and me have been today if he had decided I am not going to do it but out of love for you and me so we don't perish he gives all even his very own life he gave it can you imagine death it was not as if he died an easy death it was not an easy death that is not easy death I have seen people in prison remember I was a prison officer for 10 years and I have seen people oh people that were where where were put in prison for life no not life but but but for death okay they were just there awaiting their time of execution and they will be there um what is therefore they knock their chests what is death why one day born one day die what is death wait till you see death face to face and what they used to do which I believe they still do because I've seen it here in America that somebody on a death row before they come and take you and kill you um they would come a day before and then they will come with a chaplain and what have you they will come um they'll pray for you and tell you tomorrow we are coming for you uh anything you want to say what what do you want what do you want any special thing we can do for you any food you ask for to give it to you just that you don't have the appetite to eat foreign alcohols are not allowed but they'll give it to you they can't drink it some will ask for cigarettes but you don't sleep they'll give you Secret and what they do they put a secret in their mouth they will light another one they can't smoke why because they have told them that in 24 hours we are coming for you that night they are not going to sleep sleep will disappear and can you imagine this is somebody that is going to die by the gun before you hear the gas sound you're already dead and yet they are scared just compare that here in America they don't have that but by Electric uh how do they call it um electric chair and a little injection that is what they do here in America and that takes just seconds and you are gone and think about it that the Lord of Glory the almighty God in human flesh that he could just look ahead he was not imagining it but he was seeing the death that he was going to die the most cruel death the most cruel death that you could ever think of death on the cross how they were going to drive their nails in his hands ah I mean come again think about it the Bible says he prayed then he started sweating to the the sweat of his face started dropping like the cross of blood it was not an easy death don't let anybody ever tell you that but he still chose to do it so you and me can go scot-free how we ought to be grateful to the almighty God we ought to be grateful of all the creations of God we ought to be very thankful that he has given us hope of eternal life that when you come to the end of your road you know that you are going to live again the death and hell can never hold you back praise be to God and he died he left behind he left it behind and evidence that he was here a Rugged Cross and an empty tomb he left an evidence that he was here he sent the holy ghosts and evidence that he was here if he had not come and gone the Holy Ghost wouldn't have come and every day he was here healing and evidence that he was here we talk about the Rapture that anytime could be the day and will be out of here in a twinkling of an eye is an evidence that he was here praise be to God and remember that we all have to leave behind footprints the footprints you live the footprints you live it determines where you are going talking about footprints and an evidence that we were here we can talk about the negative side and mercy talk about people and the food peace they have left behind we can mention people talk about the evidence they have left behind but I don't want us to waste our time there this morning I can hold you down to that for the next 30 minutes praise be to God I want us to look on the good side foreign you ask yourself the life you are living today if you look behind you what Footprints have you left behind so far what are the footprints you have left behind so far when you look behind you and you see the footprints you have left behind is this something you'll be proud of because remember there are people that are coming after us and they are walking in those footprints so just imagine somebody just to the foot of the Hill and they look at those footprints will they be happy walking in those footprints will they be proud walking in those footprints what footprints are you leaving behind when God takes you home before the rapture what is going to be the evidence that you were here what is going to be the evidence that you were here oh you just passed through unnoticed remember it is a call to war it's a call to war we are not seeking peace with the devil it's a call to war for the Bible says that we were not against flesh and blood but against principalities against rulers of Darkness of this world against evil spirits we are warning against principalities spiritual wickedness in high places the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they are Mighty to the pulling down of strongholds you are a warrior you are a warrior what are the warriors in the house I think of praise be to God I've seen some hands of God bless you I think of Caleb when Caleb and the other General Swanson spider land and 10 of them brought a Wiki report and Caleb and Joshua brought a very good report Moses made him a promise that the land that your feet have traded on will be given to you as an inheritance and your generation after you and after they took the land several years Joshua was not saying anything to Joshua he said Joshua I am eight years old now I am 85 years old and I am as strong as I am today I am as strong as I was 40 years ago Moses made me a promise that he is going to give me that land I'm taking that here give me that mountain praise be to God the Bible says Joshua blessed him and gave him that mountain and he went in and came out he took that mountain we are here we are here to walk 85 year old man saying that I am as strong today as I was 40 years ago and what are you young men and women doing what are we doing that we can hardly pray we go on our knees and 5-10 minutes we don't even know what to say anymore we have exhausted our prayer topics so self-centered life is just all about us and all we are thinking about is just working money do not let that pin you down enjoy it don't let it hold you down it's good but life is better on the other side praise be to God don't let that hold you down so I remember when we all gather around the throne someday it will be time to tell the story I think probably that was the last song brother Lawrence put up there yeah I remember the last song we sung this morning praise be to God anyway so when we all gather around the throne someday it will be time to tell the story how we overcame praise be to God it will be storytelling time and I see the Prophet Daniel come and he tells his story how that he was casting the Lions then and Elias came and they couldn't eat him up because the glory of God was so much with him they could even get close they say yes to him we read that in the Holy scriptures and we were so encouraged oh you can't imagine how my strength we got from that God bless you and then I see Meshach and I bet they will come they tell you a story how that they refused the King's Command and they were just matched to the very furnace and they didn't fear they entered there and they realized the Lord was with them praise be to God oh yes we read about that we were walking in the footprints God bless you what would be your story what would be your story praise be to God can you imagine what your story would be when everybody begins to tell your story how that God dealt with them and the full Prince they left behind what would be your story on that day leaving behind footprints leaving behind an Evidence that you were here that you were not sitting on the fence that you are in the arena you were fighting that is why the Bible says we should dress in the whole armor of God with the habit of salvation the breastplate of righteousness and your laws get right about with the Gospel of Truth and your feet short in the preparation of the gospel of peace and then you have a shield of faith and a sword the sword of the spirit praise be to God you don't dress like this and then go to bed no as somebody that is at the Forefront fighting we are called to war and when I looked at that scripture I didn't see a shift a shift is a place you put your sword I didn't see a chief the sword was not in a shift their sword was drawn there was no chief we are on the Battlefront if you don't find yourself on the Battlefront you are going to retreat when it gets rough when it gets rough you are going to renounce your faith you must mean business with God until you mean business with God God is never going to mean business with you praise be to God I remember one of the dreams I've had long ago and I sobred a team in the dream and he was so angry came a student looked at me and then he turned and he was going then I called him as a right team you can't just go like that and then he turned and he came back to me and this is what he said and I'm quoting it until you are ready God is not ready praise be to God so until you are ready God is not ready you can't play with the things of God and until you mean peace you are not just a follower you are not sitting on the fence the reason why you have a lot to talk about and a lot to say about others in the arena is because you are on the fence but when you are in the arena with your sojourn hey you have some enemies to contend with you don't even know what is going on on the other side we are called to war and we are going to fight every inch along the way anywhere God calls you that is the end of it there was a brother but a team sent me a message they sent me his listing the other day the brother was just a brother we know very well in Ghana he was just in front Sunday service like I'm standing here just singing before service and he just went and that was the end of it that was the end of it someday we are going to meet him I don't care how how good life is thank God for it enjoy it do not let it hold you down always remind yourself that it is better on the other side what's up Michael praise be to God that's rain I must fight all my prayer is this morning is that give us courage Lord give me courage give me courage where is my mountain I want to take my mountain courage Lord spreading my hands for war time stop oh what is my Mountain I want to take my mountain if I must Reign I must fight give me courage Lord we need courage when Moses died an Elijah to arm Yasha took over go and read Joshua one go telling him be thou courageous be courageous be of good courage we need courage the kingdom of God is not for cowards who was that writer who says cow was die many times before their death who was that writer yes the kingdom of God is not for cowards it's for men of value be prepared to fight you don't know when and where when that time comes draw your sword the amalekites in your life don't have the right to live the double size in your life don't have the right to live draw your sword if you don't put them to death they will put you to death it doesn't matter how big or how small they are those small things you live in your life tomorrow would rope to become the big things don't spare don't spare any evil in your life there is no small evil don't spare don't spare when you draw your sword make sure you take the head of every single one of them have you ever seen a woman killing a snake before here in America I don't even see snakes you probably have to go to the zoo to go and see one but I believe if you kill it they'll take you to court but somewhere where you see them goes but when the woman is killing a snake they will stand there they'll break every single bone in it that is what should be doing to the enemy we are the Church of the Living God the bride of Christ make sure you break every bone in that snake everything you need to make it in this journey let's write in there it lays right in there never take things for granted praise be to God we are seven minutes away I know if I need more time you guys wouldn't mind praise be to God I'm even surprised how far we have come um I just didn't know what was going on praise be to God yes so God is counting on you don't let God down praise be to God God is counting on you seriously don't just pass through there are no spectators in the kingdom of God we are all in to fight so back to the question I was asking a few minutes ago if God should call you today what's going to be in the evidence that you are here would people ever remember that you are here would people ever remember that you were here it doesn't have to be something physical it doesn't have to be something physical if it is fine it doesn't have to be you living by the life you're living the life living by the word of God you become an example to others around you that they look at your life and they take consolation in it they look at your life and they see Christ people look at your life you have become so testy we are the salt of the earth people look at your life you have become so tasty till they want to see who your God is you are leaving behind an Evidence that you were here when you are gone it is something people are going to talk about you when you are gone is people is something that is going to draw people to Christ anything you do for the kingdom of God or for the people of God you are living behind a footprint that you were here you are living an Evidence that you were here it will never go unrewarded when you are standing in the gap for others that is why intercessory prayer is a very very important thing sometimes you don't know what it is our sharing with somebody one day that I was on my way to work probably two months ago and it has snowed the roads were slippery and as I was going it just came on my heart pray for the sister so I started praying I started praying okay and in less than two minutes I slid I made 270 degrees and I was facing this way I was coming from here I ended up facing here there were blue traffic's feeding in the cars here stopped the cars they stopped and I was not moved I was not moved nothing I just found my way back and I continued a prayer now you may think that oh it just happened because no it was the devil that was fighting back because when somebody is under attack and you are in the Gap you are also under attack don't think that you are free no if somebody is fighting a battle and you come in you are also a Target that is why you don't have to go in unprepared go in ready to fight when we go on our knees to pray is we are at War praise be to God and what prayers can do my brother said that prayers they depart the power that is in prayer is more than all the atomic bonso in the world there is power in prayer when you stand in a gap and you are praying even taking time to pray for the service before you come lifting the people on the field into the hands of God it is a footprint who are living behind you are living an evidence that you were here because when you go on your knees even though a brother is not seeing you even though a sister is not seeing you even though your pastor is not seeing you if you know there's nobody looking on you shut the kingdom of this Dark Age they know that the Son of God or a daughter of God is and the day you leave this earth God takes you away the demons know that well something has happened that Tormentor is gone praise be to God if God should call you today if God should call you today what is going to be the evidence that you are here when you give people encouragement you give them hope you lift them up you help them in their struggles you help them in prayer you are living behind a footprint you are living an Evidence when you are gone 10 20 30 40 50 100 years nothing is going to erase it it's an Evidence that you were here praise be to God every sacrifice you make for the kingdom of God is an evidence that you were here musicians you can come the evidence that they were here praise be to God thank you Jesus so you look at your personal life nobody is going to answer that for you you ask yourself what is the evidence if I should go tonight what is the evidence that I was here what are the footprints I'm leaving behind that posterity can look at those footprints and remember that social and so was here praise be to God the evidence that they were here I want us to go to the Lord in prayer the word of God would never go out and return unto him void whatever the word is meant to do white would do it nothing can stop it [Music] I don't know what you're going through this is far away from what I was just going to talk about today as I said from the beginning but God has a reason for everything I don't know how God touched your life I don't know what you're going through what you are dealing with but I believe that we went this way for a good cause I want us to talk to God tonight talk to God this afternoon as for more of his grace in the areas of Our Lives we know we are not doing well in the areas of Our Lives we know we have fallen shorts in the areas of our life that we are not proud of this we are still dealing with that we know are contrary to the word of God I want us to revisit to revisit Our Lives this afternoon and talk
