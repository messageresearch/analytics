[52:46] that clear next Sunday by the grace of
[52:49] God will let you know whether it will be

[1:04:07] is my first scripture reading but we
[1:04:09] have already prayed there so I will just
[1:04:12] make reference to it as I go along but
[1:04:14] let's read in John
[1:04:17] chapter
[1:04:19] 20 when when Jesus taught the disciples
[1:04:22] to pray he says when you pray says our
[1:04:25] father
[1:04:27] amen that was at the beginning of his
[1:04:30] ministry but when he resurrected in
[1:04:33] verse 16 St John chapter 20 in verse
[1:04:38] 16 the Bible
[1:04:42] says Jesus said unto
[1:04:45] Mary Jesus said unto her sorry
[1:04:51] Mary she turned herself and said on to
[1:04:55] him Rabon which is to say
[1:05:00] master Jesus said unto her touch me
[1:05:04] not for I am not yet ascended to the
[1:05:08] father but go to my brethren and said
[1:05:12] unto them I Ascend unto my
[1:05:16] father and your
[1:05:19] father and to my
[1:05:22] God and your God praise praise the

[1:05:30] them our father he ended his ministry by
[1:05:34] telling
[1:05:35] them is still our father it's your
[1:05:39] father it is my father he's your God and
[1:05:43] he's my god let's pray together Heavenly
[1:05:47] Father precious
[1:05:50] Lord the word will know
[1:05:53] nothing about fatherhood
[1:05:57] if you never came from
[1:06:00] eternity if you never condense your self
[1:06:04] to be able to give birth to a
[1:06:07] creation and give birth Lord father God
[1:06:10] and make man we will know nothing about
[1:06:14] fatherhood and precious Lord God in all
[1:06:17] that we know and all that we have
[1:06:21] achieved as father will not come nearly
[1:06:24] close to you
[1:06:26] you you are our father Lord you are the
[1:06:29] one that should be celebrated this day
[1:06:33] you are the one Lord God but precious
[1:06:36] Lord Jesus we also want to thank you
[1:06:39] Lord that you have placed men in our
[1:06:42] lives that we can call fathers we want
[1:06:46] to thank you precious Lord Jesus oh God
[1:06:50] only in eternity will reveal the many
[1:06:53] struggle that goes through
[1:06:56] many times they hold back their tears
[1:06:59] Lord just so father God to be able to
[1:07:03] labor for the family dear God we pray
[1:07:08] and uh we just want to commit ourself in
[1:07:11] your hands Lord father what a great
[1:07:14] responsibility what a great
[1:07:15] responsibility Lord we know father God
[1:07:18] it's not just all
[1:07:21] about how many children we have Lord but
[1:07:25] father with God is a Sac calling it's a
[1:07:28] calling of
[1:07:30] responsibility father we pray this
[1:07:32] morning as we were look in your word we
[1:07:34] just ask that Lord you will help us the
[1:07:37] little portion of god father we will
[1:07:39] take to talk about father who this
[1:07:42] morning we ask that Lord you will bless
[1:07:45] it you will inspire it that it will make
[1:07:47] so much so much sense to us Lord and it
[1:07:50] will draw us closer to you we love you
[1:07:54] we thank you and appreciate you this
[1:07:56] morning Father we are so grateful that
[1:07:59] we can call you papa
[1:08:02] God bless the service now in Jesus name
[1:08:08] amen amen praise the Lord amen the Lord
[1:08:13] bless you you may have your
[1:08:15] seat I learned is uh uh brother Jordan's
[1:08:19] birthday if I get it right and it's also
[1:08:22] his first Father's
[1:08:23] Day so wherever he is he better enjoy
[1:08:30] it he better enjoy
[1:08:33] it that little girl might be cooking
[1:08:35] pancake for him this
[1:08:38] morning praise the
[1:08:40] Lord
[1:08:42] amen amen there there there are some
[1:08:45] beautiful things here that uh caught my
[1:08:48] attention
[1:08:50] yesterday you will realize here when
[1:08:53] Jesus resurrected he he said to Mary
[1:08:57] touch me n that was in the morning that
[1:09:00] was just after he resurrected and went
[1:09:03] to the tomb but then in the evening time
[1:09:07] he told Thomas come and touch
[1:09:10] me said see my head see my side come and
[1:09:14] touch me praise the Lord I was looking
[1:09:18] at that yesterday and I is I mean the
[1:09:20] word of God is just so
[1:09:22] beautiful so beautiful we know when
[1:09:24] Jesus resurrect Ed there was there was
[1:09:27] the time he would have performed his
[1:09:30] priesthood
[1:09:32] ministry as a high priest he needed to
[1:09:34] go in the presence of the shakana glory
[1:09:38] to present the
[1:09:39] sacrifice so that's what he told Mary
[1:09:42] don't touch me because I have not
[1:09:45] extended yet I have not gone behind the
[1:09:47] veil I have not presented the
[1:09:50] sacrifice so he had to go and present
[1:09:53] himself to the father
[1:09:56] it's a great mystery of
[1:09:58] godliness praise the
[1:10:01] Lord he say he's your father and he's
[1:10:04] your
[1:10:05] God you see that's the reason why if you
[1:10:07] don't understand the mystery of
[1:10:09] godliness and you just make Jesus God
[1:10:13] without understanding there you will be
[1:10:16] just as wrong as those that believe in
[1:10:20] Trinity praise the Lord
[1:10:24] amen so so uh uh uh he told Mary don't
[1:10:29] touch me touch me not for I have not yet
[1:10:32] ascended to my father but go tell the
[1:10:34] Brethren and said unto them I send it to
[1:10:37] my father and your father to my God and
[1:10:41] your God and just like I said right
[1:10:46] after he did that in the afternoon time
[1:10:49] he walked with those men on the road of
[1:10:52] EMAs those guys that was walking after
[1:10:54] he came came he walked with them and
[1:10:57] then uh uh uh when he broke the bread
[1:11:00] the eyes were open and then uh in the
[1:11:03] evening time then he met with the
[1:11:06] disciples where he showed Thomas his
[1:11:09] hand and he said he come and touch me
[1:11:11] now so what I was thinking about this I
[1:11:14] thought on U uh a little
[1:11:16] message uh I was looking at the other
[1:11:19] time where uh uh John was told in the
[1:11:22] Book of Revelation chapter 1 write this
[1:11:25] things that I said unto you that's what
[1:11:28] Jesus said unto John the angel said to
[1:11:30] John write these things but when you
[1:11:33] come to Revelation 10:7 he told John do
[1:11:36] not
[1:11:38] write praise the Lord the same one that
[1:11:40] say right is the same one that said do
[1:11:43] not right the same one that said don't
[1:11:45] touch me was the same one that said come
[1:11:49] and touch me praise the Lord and uh uh
[1:11:54] uh because of uh what John was told in
[1:11:59] Revelation 10 many head on to that and
[1:12:03] say the seven tunnel is not revealed how
[1:12:05] can it be revealed if it was not written
[1:12:07] but if you read the rest of the
[1:12:09] scripture you will understand that he
[1:12:12] told John do not write these things but
[1:12:16] in the day of the voice of the seven
[1:12:19] Angel when he shall begin to sound those
[1:12:23] things will be revealed they were not
[1:12:24] supposed to to be written they were
[1:12:26] supposed to be preached yes they were
[1:12:28] supposed to be spoken yes praise the
[1:12:32] Lord
[1:12:34] amen so uh I mean it's very beautiful
[1:12:36] here it's very beautiful you see those
[1:12:39] patterns in the word and uh you enjoy
[1:12:42] this morning I want to talk on if I can
[1:12:44] choose a title for myself will be Papa
[1:12:46] God our father my father your father my
[1:12:51] God your God praise the Lord
[1:12:56] now if you look in the Bible you will
[1:12:58] realize that Jesus uh taught the Lord's
[1:13:01] Prayer two
[1:13:04] times many times uh uh we think that is
[1:13:09] one because it's written in two
[1:13:11] different gospels but when you look at
[1:13:13] the setting you'll realize it was two
[1:13:16] different times that he taught the
[1:13:18] Lord's Prayer one in Matthew chapter 6
[1:13:21] The Bible says that was his Sermon on
[1:13:23] the Mount where he gave the Beatitudes
[1:13:26] and he taught the disciples and said
[1:13:28] when you pray go into your closet and
[1:13:31] say our father praise the Lord amen
[1:13:36] whether it is just you that is praying
[1:13:39] say our father because it is not
[1:13:41] supposed to be prayer is never a selfish
[1:13:44] thing praise the Lord if there is one
[1:13:48] thing that you you should never be
[1:13:49] selfish with is praying and that's the
[1:13:52] reason why it counts more for you to
[1:13:54] pray for others than praying for
[1:13:56] yourself amen because you can never be
[1:13:59] selfish with
[1:14:00] prayer and uh but if you look also in uh
[1:14:05] uh uh St Luke chap
[1:14:07] 11 St Luke chap 11 verse1 the Bible says
[1:14:11] Jesus came out of praying and the
[1:14:14] disciples came to him and said uh uh it
[1:14:19] came to pass that as he was praying in a
[1:14:22] setting place when he sees one of the
[1:14:24] these disciples said unto him
[1:14:27] Lord said unto him Lord teach us to pray
[1:14:30] as John also taught his disciples now
[1:14:33] it's strange enough that when they asked
[1:14:38] him he repeated the same thing he taught
[1:14:42] them praise the Lord it is almost like
[1:14:46] when Jesus says verily
[1:14:49] verily a sense of making
[1:14:53] emphasis a the sense of showing the
[1:14:57] prayer that I taught you before is very
[1:15:01] important if there is any prayer that
[1:15:03] would reach the father it was what I
[1:15:05] taught you
[1:15:07] before praise the
[1:15:09] Lord Jesus knows all the Redemptive name
[1:15:13] of the
[1:15:14] father because they were manifested in
[1:15:17] him he knew that he was the bridge he's
[1:15:20] the Living Water he's the alpha he's the
[1:15:23] Omega he knows all all the titles
[1:15:25] through the scripture because he was the
[1:15:28] very revelation of those
[1:15:31] titles praise the
[1:15:34] Lord but when he taught us to pray he
[1:15:38] never taught us
[1:15:40] titles he taught us
[1:15:44] relationship praise the lord it's true
[1:15:47] that in many of the titles we are also
[1:15:49] related with the Father the rose of
[1:15:52] Sharon he's the one that eases our pains
[1:15:56] praise the Lord and uh and and and we we
[1:15:58] can go through all that but when you
[1:16:02] just look look at this you will realize
[1:16:05] that there is something important about
[1:16:09] this
[1:16:10] prayer Our
[1:16:13] Father praise the Lord our
[1:16:17] father and uh uh
[1:16:22] uh when you look at the Lord's
[1:16:25] prayer and you prayed it not in a in a
[1:16:31] recitation way but you prayed as as
[1:16:34] praying or speaking a prayer to the Lord
[1:16:38] you will realize that you go through 13
[1:16:42] Cycles Our Father which are in heaven
[1:16:46] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:16:49] that will be done you will realize it is
[1:16:52] 13
[1:16:53] Cycles 13 is the number of the
[1:16:56] church you will also realize that when
[1:17:00] you count every word in the Lord's
[1:17:03] Prayer is
[1:17:08] 66 and I'll read something to you it
[1:17:11] will encourage you to mark of the
[1:17:19] beast the the whole word of God
[1:17:25] the whole the whole word of God in every
[1:17:28] bit ties together 66 books wrote by
[1:17:34] numbers of men hundreds of years
[1:17:37] apart and not one contradict the other
[1:17:41] one not a one every one of them perfect
[1:17:48] never was a piece of literature wrote
[1:17:51] like it in all the word amen amen praise
[1:17:56] the
[1:17:58] Lord and I was I was fellowshipping with
[1:18:00] a brother yesterday we were you know we
[1:18:03] were talking and and uh you know he was
[1:18:06] he was uh you know just sharing with me
[1:18:08] and and we just fellowshipping and he
[1:18:10] was just sharing with me in uh you know
[1:18:13] U where where should I start you know uh
[1:18:16] you know I love reading the Bible and
[1:18:19] you know I I get discouraged because you
[1:18:22] know I start reading and then I love L
[1:18:25] strike or I'm not understanding you know
[1:18:28] so I I I share with him something that I
[1:18:32] learned and what is it is that when you
[1:18:35] want to learn a
[1:18:37] language that is not your language the
[1:18:41] way to learn it is not to learn it by
[1:18:45] yourself praise the Lord is to look for
[1:18:48] a community that speaks that
[1:18:51] language praise the Lord and go in that
[1:18:55] community so you start you start
[1:18:58] verbalizing the words you have learned
[1:19:01] and and then also you start picking from
[1:19:04] their action the way they are saying you
[1:19:06] know uh uh uh uh take for example French
[1:19:09] V you know saying come here you know you
[1:19:12] you start picking from their action and
[1:19:14] all of that and as you stay in that
[1:19:16] environment pretty soon you will see
[1:19:18] yourself absorbing the language you will
[1:19:21] start picking up words you will start
[1:19:23] understanding phrases is because of the
[1:19:25] action of the people and all of
[1:19:28] that the word of
[1:19:30] God is called the word of God because
[1:19:33] it's God's
[1:19:36] language you don't go to school to learn
[1:19:40] it if you really want to learn it you
[1:19:43] got to get in the environment of the
[1:19:45] word you got to stay where the word is
[1:19:48] preached where the word is appreciated
[1:19:51] where the word is fellowship around
[1:19:54] praise the Lord and pretty soon you know
[1:19:58] things will be shared and and and things
[1:20:00] you are reading will be said over the
[1:20:01] pulpit your oh wow yeah I think I read
[1:20:05] that you know and just like that you you
[1:20:07] know you that that that that environment
[1:20:10] you will start absorbing the word start
[1:20:13] you start becoming part of it you start
[1:20:14] you start loving it praise the Lord and
[1:20:18] uh and and but that is the thing with
[1:20:20] every language if you want to learn it
[1:20:22] and you just go and practice bunch of
[1:20:25] words you know bunch of words I remember
[1:20:28] a old friend of mine that uh that told
[1:20:30] me his story he was coming to the states
[1:20:33] for for the first time and then he I
[1:20:35] mean he he he just tried to practice all
[1:20:38] the greetings you know all the greetings
[1:20:40] and as soon as he got to the airport
[1:20:42] when you heard people talking yeah he
[1:20:44] said everything just went from my
[1:20:49] head everything the thing I practice
[1:20:52] months and months he said they just wait
[1:20:55] I was just
[1:20:56] lost praise the Lord say I wish I Carri
[1:21:00] my my my little cassette with
[1:21:02] me praise the Lord so you see that's how
[1:21:05] the word is now so we reading this let's
[1:21:08] continue with this now he's saying now
[1:21:10] there is there is never a piece of
[1:21:12] literature that is written like the word
[1:21:14] of God they have been for 2,000 years
[1:21:18] trying to alter The Lord's
[1:21:21] Prayer to put one word to it or take one
[1:21:25] word from it to to make it better you
[1:21:30] just can't do
[1:21:31] it oh it's perfect it is it's the word
[1:21:36] of God so you see the Lord's pray have
[1:21:41] 66 words in it and we have 66 books in
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:47] Bible praise the Lord I don't know what
[1:21:49] you would do with that this morning but
[1:21:52] I would tell you that uh
[1:21:55] The Lord's Prayer never gets
[1:21:59] old amen The Lord's Prayer is good for
[1:22:04] every
[1:22:05] day there is not one thing that you can
[1:22:09] be dven and desire and burden to tell
[1:22:13] the Lord that is not said in the Lord's
[1:22:16] Prayer praise the Lord if you pray the
[1:22:20] Lord's Prayer and now recite it is
[1:22:23] different from reciting yes and praying
[1:22:25] it if you pray the Lord's Prayer there
[1:22:28] is not anything you want to say to God
[1:22:31] that is not in that in that prayer and
[1:22:35] that's the reason why though Jesus
[1:22:38] taught his disciples and yet when they
[1:22:41] ask him again teach us how to pray he
[1:22:43] reminded them when you pray say our
[1:22:47] father who are in heaven praise the Lord
[1:22:51] I mean like I said he could say Jehovah
[1:22:53] Rafa Jehovah shalom from Jehovah you
[1:22:55] know we we we go we go when you know we
[1:22:58] go into all of that we go into all of
[1:23:01] that and uh and sometimes we are just
[1:23:04] exercising our religious knowledge of
[1:23:06] what we know you know how we can
[1:23:09] pronounce it and how we can you know
[1:23:11] articulate ourself before God is that's
[1:23:14] far different from
[1:23:16] praying when you put your heart out to
[1:23:20] God and I believe that was the reason
[1:23:22] why that phrase Papa God meant a whole
[1:23:25] lot to brother
[1:23:27] Brandon because you
[1:23:29] see I challenge you try when you are
[1:23:33] praying say papa
[1:23:36] God it move your heart in a different
[1:23:40] way it makes it so
[1:23:44] real it takes away all your theological
[1:23:48] knowledge it just throw you in the arm
[1:23:50] of the father when you say papa God
[1:23:55] it makes it so
[1:24:07] real praise the Lord there's
[1:24:11] nothing nothing like the Lord's Prayer I
[1:24:14] love the Lord's Prayer I love the Lord's
[1:24:17] Prayer we we try to pray that every day
[1:24:20] in our home
[1:24:33] amen so like I said there's uh uh 13
[1:24:37] Cycles you know uh uh um in 66 words in
[1:24:44] uh in that
[1:24:46] prayer now so we want to look at uh uh
[1:24:51] like I said Papa God as we look at
[1:24:53] fatherhood this morning and uh uh I'm
[1:24:57] stay in the in in the element of what I
[1:25:00] want to why I wanted to preach I just
[1:25:02] got into today uh uh to be able to
[1:25:05] address you on on Father's day but you
[1:25:08] realize that uh uh that was the first
[1:25:13] attribute that was God's first
[1:25:17] attribute for him to be
[1:25:20] God his first attribute was to give
[1:25:23] birth
[1:25:27] because he was the great in of spirit
[1:25:31] one time he failed
[1:25:33] everywhere without beginning Without End
[1:25:37] how will he start
[1:25:38] time to start anything you has to have a
[1:25:43] beginning so for God to
[1:25:46] begin by having a
[1:25:49] beginning he have to give birth to
[1:25:52] himself
[1:25:58] in the way of condensing himself from
[1:26:02] interal to start time because time has a
[1:26:05] beginning it has an end internity does
[1:26:08] not have a beginning it does not have an
[1:26:11] end so when the Bible says in the
[1:26:13] beginning which mean there was a time
[1:26:17] where it
[1:26:19] begins so God first attribute was was
[1:26:24] the attribute of a
[1:26:30] father it was an attribute of of of a
[1:26:34] father he's the father of the
[1:26:37] universe praise the
[1:26:41] Lord he's a father of the
[1:26:45] universe that word father just like
[1:26:48] mother uh uh uh it speaks of one that
[1:26:52] beget
[1:26:54] one that
[1:26:56] begins that was his first
[1:27:00] attribute and uh so fatherhood is is
[1:27:04] very very
[1:27:06] important and just think about it that
[1:27:09] was the reason why it was very important
[1:27:12] to
[1:27:13] Jesus coming to these men that have that
[1:27:16] from from 12 13 years old they were
[1:27:18] taught the Torah they knew the Lord and
[1:27:21] all of that but when he came to them uh
[1:27:25] to to to really give them a Bible uh you
[1:27:29] know a Bible class a teaching how to
[1:27:32] approach God the first thing he would
[1:27:34] tell them is when you come the one you
[1:27:37] are coming to is the one that you begin
[1:27:42] from praise the Lord you are coming to
[1:27:46] your
[1:27:47] beginning you are talking to your
[1:27:50] beginning the one without you wouldn't
[1:27:53] have existed
[1:27:56] you're not talking to a
[1:27:58] foreigner you're not talking to one that
[1:28:00] is so far away that came be rich you are
[1:28:04] talking to the one that holds your
[1:28:07] existence the one from whom you begin
[1:28:10] you are coming back to your
[1:28:17] beginning praise the
[1:28:19] Lord and when you can come back to the
[1:28:21] beginning you can have a new start every
[1:28:25] day every day if you can just come back
[1:28:29] to the
[1:28:31] beginning praise the
[1:28:33] Lord when you say our
[1:28:36] father you are telling yourself I'm
[1:28:38] beginning
[1:28:40] again I'm coming back to my
[1:28:43] beginning if you can come back to your
[1:28:46] beginning you can have a new start every
[1:28:52] day praise the Lord amen
[1:28:57] that was his first attribute it means a
[1:29:00] whole lot to him it means a whole lot
[1:29:04] to God that's the reason why his love
[1:29:09] there is no partiality in his
[1:29:12] love praise the Lord if God gave every
[1:29:18] creature that God gave life this day God
[1:29:22] is equally responsible
[1:29:24] for every one of
[1:29:26] them praise the Lord he's equally
[1:29:31] responsible we being in church this
[1:29:33] morning do not give us a greater portion
[1:29:36] of love than the people that are walking
[1:29:39] on the street no there is no love in his
[1:29:43] I mean no partiality in his
[1:29:49] love praise the Lord because he gave
[1:29:52] them life so he hold himself
[1:29:57] responsible for the ends for the the uh
[1:30:01] every living
[1:30:03] creature that's that's that's that's the
[1:30:06] father
[1:30:10] responsibility that's the attribute of a
[1:30:16] father he ped His blessings upon the
[1:30:19] just and the
[1:30:21] unjust
[1:30:22] equally glory be to God like we always
[1:30:26] say the only thing that make the
[1:30:28] difference you and myself have received
[1:30:30] Grace to appreciate it and we hope that
[1:30:34] they can receive Grace also because I'm
[1:30:37] telling you some of those people can do
[1:30:39] better than we are doing because people
[1:30:42] sit in church and pretty soon we take
[1:30:44] the the the attitude of
[1:30:47] entitlement we Fe that because we go to
[1:30:49] church we pay our offering we pay our
[1:30:51] time so we are entitled God must do this
[1:30:54] for
[1:30:57] me some of those people will do better
[1:31:00] with the grace that we have we must
[1:31:03] appreciate
[1:31:04] it Hallelujah we have received the grace
[1:31:09] to be able to appreciate his love and
[1:31:13] that's the reason why all everything
[1:31:15] that we will do must all come from the
[1:31:19] sense of
[1:31:21] appreciation it must all come from the
[1:31:24] sense of
[1:31:26] appreciation when we lift our hands to
[1:31:29] sink and and we and we dress this and
[1:31:31] and we live right we are doing it
[1:31:34] because we appreciate the love and the
[1:31:37] grace that he has given us for us to be
[1:31:41] able to
[1:31:44] recognize his
[1:31:46] love praise the Lord but it's not the
[1:31:50] same I mean it's it's not different it's
[1:31:53] the same same the same way he love you
[1:31:55] is the same way he love The Sinner in
[1:31:57] the streets he don't love the sin but he
[1:31:59] love The Sinner amen praise the Lord he
[1:32:02] love The
[1:32:04] Sinner our
[1:32:07] father Jesus said when we pray we must
[1:32:11] say our father that's a great
[1:32:15] attribute that's a great attribute like
[1:32:18] I said that that is our beginning that's
[1:32:21] where we came from
[1:32:24] amen that's where we came from and it's
[1:32:28] it's something that we must we must
[1:32:31] honor you see that that attribute is an
[1:32:35] attribute of
[1:32:37] headship because it was the first
[1:32:41] attribute that God that God displayed
[1:32:45] that he manifested to the universe that
[1:32:47] he was going to me that uh so so it is
[1:32:51] it it takes the place of head Airship
[1:32:55] praise the
[1:32:56] Lord it takes the place of headship and
[1:32:59] I'll share some share some things with
[1:33:02] you oh my god some things with you from
[1:33:05] the word this morning
[1:33:07] amen and uh uh and and we will
[1:33:10] appreciate it it shows a place of
[1:33:13] headship and uh let me share one that is
[1:33:16] that is very very come on now Numbers
[1:33:18] Chapter 30 let's go to Numbers Chapter
[1:33:21] 30
[1:33:30] you know as we celebrate Father's dead
[1:33:33] and and you know we send text of uh uh
[1:33:37] you know to all of uh the men that uh uh
[1:33:41] we want to appreciate but this morning
[1:33:44] we just want to take this time to be
[1:33:47] able to appreciate our father that is in
[1:33:50] heaven amen because from him come the
[1:33:52] true sense of father you know fatherhood
[1:33:55] praise the Lord for him come a true
[1:33:58] sense of fatherhood you see that's the
[1:34:00] reason why Paul in the book of Ephesians
[1:34:03] he would give that responsibility to the
[1:34:05] man and says as Christ loved the church
[1:34:08] you know uh uh because the church in
[1:34:11] Christ is in uh uh uh uh uh relationship
[1:34:15] a husband wife relationship Christ is
[1:34:18] the husband the church is the bride and
[1:34:20] uh uh uh so also when it comes to the
[1:34:23] the place of uh you will see there even
[1:34:26] in Ephesian he did the same he says uh
[1:34:28] he say parents you know father provoke
[1:34:31] not your children children you know
[1:34:33] respect your parents because it's the
[1:34:35] first commandment you know with a
[1:34:36] promise but let's look here in Numbers
[1:34:40] Chapter 13 what I want to bring out of
[1:34:42] this is an understanding of headship so
[1:34:45] so we can be able to
[1:34:47] appreciate verse verse one and Moses
[1:34:50] speak unto the heads of the tribe
[1:34:53] concerning
[1:34:54] the children of Israel Moses speak unto
[1:34:57] the head of the tribes concerning the
[1:35:01] children of Israel headship that's what
[1:35:04] I want you to keep on your mind seeing
[1:35:06] this is the thing which the Lord has
[1:35:08] commanded if a man vowed a vowed unto
[1:35:12] the Lord or swear and ought to bound his
[1:35:15] sword with a bound he shall not break
[1:35:18] his word he shall do a calling to all
[1:35:23] their that proceeded out of his mouth a
[1:35:28] man is good as his
[1:35:31] word praise the Lord amen a man is good
[1:35:36] at his word you will see in this
[1:35:39] principle God did not make a provision
[1:35:42] for a man vow to be
[1:35:47] broken why
[1:35:51] because he's the head
[1:35:56] praise the Lord that's that's the
[1:35:58] principle I want I want us to be able to
[1:36:00] appreciate he did not make a provision
[1:36:03] for the man when the man made a vow he
[1:36:06] must keep it because he's as good as his
[1:36:11] word praise the Lord amen let's let's go
[1:36:15] down a little
[1:36:17] bit verse three if a woman also vow a
[1:36:22] vow unto the Lord Lord and bound
[1:36:25] herself uh uh uh by the bound being in
[1:36:30] her father's
[1:36:32] house in her youth why they stay there
[1:36:36] because of
[1:36:39] headship okay so if she if she if she
[1:36:44] commit herself to a vow she still on a
[1:36:47] headship that headship must be respected
[1:36:53] are we together amen watch and see you
[1:36:59] now and her father hear her
[1:37:04] vow and her bound wherewith she have
[1:37:08] bound her soul and her father and her
[1:37:13] father shall hold his peace at her then
[1:37:16] all her vow shall stand and every bound
[1:37:19] wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
[1:37:23] but but if her father this allow her in
[1:37:27] the day that he hears it so which mean
[1:37:31] if if uh if if if she goes out and and
[1:37:34] make a commitment she goes out and
[1:37:37] commit herself to something and take a
[1:37:39] vow to something and her father years it
[1:37:42] I said well I mean uh uh uh you know uh
[1:37:45] that's good she commit herself to that
[1:37:47] you know uh I'll support her I mean it
[1:37:51] it shall
[1:37:52] stand praise the
[1:37:54] Lord but when the fathers years it and
[1:37:57] say NOP
[1:37:59] NOP
[1:38:01] no praise the Lord are we
[1:38:06] together now what is the principle that
[1:38:08] we dealing with
[1:38:10] headship it all comes back to
[1:38:15] fatherhood
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:19] sorry so when the father disallowed
[1:38:23] heard in the days that he ye that he
[1:38:27] Heth
[1:38:28] not any of her vow or of her bound
[1:38:32] wherewith she she have bound her soul
[1:38:35] shall stand the Lord shall forgive her
[1:38:39] because her father this allow
[1:38:44] her so when it comes to the father it
[1:38:48] comes to the man he don't have a way out
[1:38:51] he must stand for his his word word he
[1:38:54] must be as good as his word praise the
[1:38:58] Lord
[1:39:00] amen he must be as good as his word and
[1:39:04] God God will deal with him if he if he
[1:39:06] if he makes a vow and and and try to get
[1:39:08] himself out of faith God with thee now
[1:39:11] with the woman because she's on a
[1:39:15] headship praise the
[1:39:17] Lord her her vow her commitment is
[1:39:21] judged by her father
[1:39:25] praise the Lord now it his year it talks
[1:39:29] about a woman in the house of her father
[1:39:32] when you go down to the next verse it
[1:39:34] will now tells you about a
[1:39:39] wife so what is it dealing with what I'm
[1:39:43] trying to get get us to be able to see
[1:39:46] is that place of headship God has set
[1:39:49] the
[1:39:50] universe in an order with a chain of
[1:39:55] command praise the Lord he set the
[1:39:59] universe with in in in an order just
[1:40:03] like just like the kingdoms like I I've
[1:40:06] shared this with you before there are
[1:40:08] five kingdoms there's the kingdom of God
[1:40:11] the kingdom of men the kingdom of humans
[1:40:14] the animal kingdom the pl Kingdom and
[1:40:17] the Minal
[1:40:18] kingom praise the Lord so there's a
[1:40:22] chain of command for the least to come
[1:40:24] up to the
[1:40:26] highest the the the higher one is the
[1:40:28] one that
[1:40:30] pulled the plain Kingdom goes down to
[1:40:33] the Earth with its root to get the
[1:40:35] mineral the the potassium and all of
[1:40:37] those things that are in the earth the
[1:40:39] roots go into the Earth to draw it
[1:40:43] out praise the Lord for us to benefit we
[1:40:45] don't go and L the dust and and and you
[1:40:47] know to get potassium and get no the
[1:40:50] roots go and suck it out of the Earth
[1:40:54] the animal kingdom comes and eat the
[1:40:58] plants the human kiddom comes and eat
[1:41:01] the
[1:41:02] animal praise the
[1:41:05] Lord then the kingdom of God must also
[1:41:07] eat the
[1:41:09] Hons praise the
[1:41:11] Lord amen the kingdom of God must eat
[1:41:14] the hmer that's why we must be born
[1:41:16] again that's why we must die because uh
[1:41:19] for you to eat anything it has to die
[1:41:21] for God to get the benefit out of you
[1:41:24] you must
[1:41:27] die but God said it like that he said it
[1:41:31] like that or else we will not get the
[1:41:33] nutrients from the earth we go be laking
[1:41:36] dust and breaking rocks and you know and
[1:41:38] all of that and if you go that route you
[1:41:41] end up in the
[1:41:44] hospital amen but if you go the route
[1:41:47] the natural rout that God set by eating
[1:41:49] the
[1:41:50] plants you will get every mineral that
[1:41:53] is in in the
[1:41:56] earth praise the Lord and that is the
[1:42:00] same way God set out the family order
[1:42:02] there a chain of
[1:42:04] command the head of every man is
[1:42:08] Christ the head of the woman is the
[1:42:12] man the head of the home the children is
[1:42:15] the
[1:42:17] woman so you see we cannot get good
[1:42:21] result if we are now submitted to our
[1:42:26] headship it's it's a chain of command
[1:42:29] God is a law of God you cannot get good
[1:42:33] result if you are not honor your
[1:42:36] headship the way God
[1:42:40] required there is no books you can try
[1:42:43] there is no loud you can shout there is
[1:42:45] no amount of money you can sport the
[1:42:47] family way that we give you the result
[1:42:50] of a Godly home
[1:42:53] unless you get under your
[1:42:56] head when a man is under his head cries
[1:43:00] and and and and and the life of Christ
[1:43:02] is reflecting through him you don't need
[1:43:05] to shout you don't need to fast about
[1:43:07] it the Lord that set that command will
[1:43:10] bring the next thing on the line with
[1:43:15] you many of our problem is because we
[1:43:18] want to achieve those things with our
[1:43:20] hands
[1:43:24] we want to faction it in the way that we
[1:43:27] want it to be and that's not the way
[1:43:29] that God designed it so you see here uh
[1:43:33] this is the place of headship it's a law
[1:43:36] of
[1:43:38] God it's a lord of God and brother Steve
[1:43:41] I was thinking about that yesterday and
[1:43:43] it it come back to to the question you
[1:43:45] asked me the other day and I was
[1:43:47] thinking about that uh because it fits
[1:43:50] in right here and God talks about the
[1:43:53] the Widow and he talks about uh uh the
[1:43:56] divorce and the stranger and the
[1:43:59] fatherless see the word fatherless is
[1:44:02] all because of
[1:44:11] hairshipment the man was under the law
[1:44:14] of polygamy so God had to make a
[1:44:16] provision for the woman when she were
[1:44:18] put away
[1:44:23] are you are you getting the picture amen
[1:44:26] praise the
[1:44:27] Lord because uh you know a sister asked
[1:44:30] me that question and I think when I said
[1:44:33] you know God make provision for for
[1:44:35] divorce it looks like God said go and
[1:44:38] div no that's not what I meant I meant
[1:44:40] thatth when the woman was put away God
[1:44:43] made a provision for her because you
[1:44:46] have to realize when Jesus came and took
[1:44:48] that subject he said it was because of
[1:44:51] the hardiness of the the heart which we
[1:44:55] which we would Define in many cases it
[1:44:58] was a form of
[1:45:02] abuse praise the
[1:45:05] Lord amen I think I'm supposed to be
[1:45:08] talking about how great fathers are
[1:45:10] that's what I'm supposed to be talking
[1:45:17] about but that's that's the thing that
[1:45:19] is in that is the thing that is required
[1:45:21] of a father
[1:45:24] that is the place you know so because of
[1:45:28] headship God respects
[1:45:31] that he respects them that was the first
[1:45:35] attribute that was that was manifested
[1:45:38] so so when you when you when you when
[1:45:40] you read in the in the in the scripture
[1:45:43] you know it talks about uh uh uh you
[1:45:46] know the man first you know uh it is it
[1:45:48] is a place of position it's not uh uh uh
[1:45:52] in the place of uh you know the woman
[1:45:54] being second class no is just a place of
[1:45:58] position glory be to God it's a place of
[1:46:02] position because uh like we have uh
[1:46:04] shared with you before from the
[1:46:06] word God plac uh uh the the the mystery
[1:46:10] of redemption and I was thinking about
[1:46:12] this the other day it came out uh you
[1:46:14] know I was just there I wow man this is
[1:46:16] very beautiful and because if you look
[1:46:18] at it is that he put the mystery of
[1:46:21] redemption in a woman because he gave
[1:46:23] the woman the promise the woman had the
[1:46:25] promise of the Redeemer the woman's seed
[1:46:28] shall bruise the head of the
[1:46:30] seing praise the Lord but you see what
[1:46:33] what will God do God will also Raise A
[1:46:37] Man and give him the law of redemption
[1:46:40] even though the woman had the promise of
[1:46:43] redemption she could not redeem it's the
[1:46:45] man that
[1:46:47] redeems now look in the life of Mary and
[1:46:51] Joseph it will give you a clear
[1:46:53] picture Mary was carrying the Redeemer
[1:46:56] in her womm by the voice of an
[1:46:59] Angel praise the Lord amen God knowing
[1:47:03] what he had predestinated for that time
[1:47:06] that that was the season that uh that uh
[1:47:10] uh uh uh he was going to come on the
[1:47:12] earth and bring his great glorious
[1:47:14] promise to pass what he did he allowed
[1:47:18] this man Joseph by history that is
[1:47:21] proven you know that he was a widower
[1:47:25] amen but history is proven that Joseph
[1:47:27] was a widower that's the reason why in
[1:47:29] the Bible they told Jesus these are your
[1:47:31] brothers and sisters they they were
[1:47:33] Joseph children from his former wife
[1:47:35] they were not married
[1:47:37] children praise the Lord so God took a
[1:47:40] man that was a widower a man that that
[1:47:44] has been there a man of
[1:47:46] experience to set him over this young
[1:47:51] virgin that was going to to be so
[1:47:53] innocent why the god did there to
[1:47:56] protect the gift that was coming the Sea
[1:48:01] of redemption was coming to the word
[1:48:04] praise the Lord you think about it if it
[1:48:06] were just a young
[1:48:09] boy with his hair spinning on his
[1:48:12] shoulder he would have told Mary your
[1:48:14] angel thing is just for you you
[1:48:17] alone praise the
[1:48:20] Lord so God has to take a man of
[1:48:24] experience a man that has been
[1:48:27] there even though he did not understand
[1:48:30] it but the Bible says he was not going
[1:48:32] to make a Public Disgrace of marriage he
[1:48:35] was thinking how can I deal with
[1:48:40] this and that attitude pleased God so
[1:48:43] much that God had to send the same angel
[1:48:46] that spoke to Mary that same angel had
[1:48:49] to come to Joseph by a dream and tell
[1:48:51] him said don't P Mary
[1:48:57] away praise the
[1:49:00] Lord man you tell me when Joseph woke up
[1:49:03] that
[1:49:04] morning if he was ever
[1:49:07] Brave he was ready to fight for Mary he
[1:49:10] was ready to defend Mary because now
[1:49:14] he's
[1:49:16] convinced the Bible called him a
[1:49:19] righteous man he never even touched that
[1:49:21] woman because the angel said the thing
[1:49:24] that is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:49:30] Ghost so you see she has the promise the
[1:49:34] man must be there to protect the promise
[1:49:37] why because God put Heavenly treasure in
[1:49:41] eting vessels so he raised men the
[1:49:44] church is fragile the church is very
[1:49:47] fragile praise the Lord everybody we
[1:49:50] come to church we all are believers
[1:49:53] even in Jesus church the son of pedition
[1:49:56] was there the church is very fragile so
[1:49:59] you see God has to raise men with the
[1:50:02] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:04] Ghost men that will spend their time in
[1:50:08] prayer because that's what the gift is
[1:50:10] given for to protect the
[1:50:18] body that's the Myster of redemption
[1:50:21] that's the reason why the woman was not
[1:50:23] made the very same day that the man was
[1:50:25] made because she's a she's a weaker
[1:50:28] vessel like the Bible say she's a tender
[1:50:30] vessel but in that vessel God will P the
[1:50:34] Myster of redemption God will give her
[1:50:36] three sacri
[1:50:38] VT and now it's for the man to
[1:50:41] protect praise the lord it's for the man
[1:50:44] to protect whether she's a daughter
[1:50:46] whether she's a
[1:50:50] wife it's for the man to
[1:50:57] protect glory be to
[1:51:05] God we have a a
[1:51:08] society that
[1:51:10] has defined marriage in all of his
[1:51:12] different
[1:51:13] ways trying to get away from God's
[1:51:17] principle so that's what I'm going I was
[1:51:19] going to show you there there and
[1:51:22] another piece I I I saw that in uh uh in
[1:51:26] the scripture there when
[1:51:29] El when El Isa went to find
[1:51:32] Rebecca there's an
[1:51:34] element that we didn't pay attention to
[1:51:38] there was a
[1:51:42] guy that was in that
[1:51:46] story and that guide was the brother of
[1:51:51] Rebecca
[1:51:55] the Bible says when Rebecca ran home to
[1:51:58] tell her father about this stranger that
[1:52:00] she met the scripture say her brother
[1:52:03] rign to meet
[1:52:04] them
[1:52:06] amen and you find out after everything
[1:52:10] was done and El gave his story why he
[1:52:12] have come in all of that and he have
[1:52:14] found that this woman is the woman to be
[1:52:16] married there was one man that was
[1:52:18] considered her
[1:52:20] brother why
[1:52:24] is the place of
[1:52:26] adoption where a boy has raised to the
[1:52:30] place praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:52:33] why when when young boys are not taking
[1:52:36] position and doing things they're
[1:52:38] supposed to do your sisters cannot be
[1:52:41] protected by
[1:52:42] you they cannot be protected by you
[1:52:45] because they don't see it in you they
[1:52:47] see you like a clown they see you like
[1:52:49] uh they don't they cannot be protected
[1:52:51] by you
[1:52:56] it's a place where the boy Step
[1:52:59] Up praise the lord it's a place of
[1:53:04] adoption his voice is considered because
[1:53:08] he's interested in the inheritance of
[1:53:10] his
[1:53:12] father the Bible said they should ask
[1:53:15] Rebecca's brother the father was there
[1:53:18] he was not
[1:53:21] dead but it's a place of
[1:53:25] adoption oh the Bible is so beautiful
[1:53:28] it's so
[1:53:29] beautiful glory be to God but when when
[1:53:33] boys are just uh you know they are they
[1:53:36] they want to be like girls and you know
[1:53:38] they you know they have uh uh grow their
[1:53:40] head long Pierce their ears and do all
[1:53:42] the funny thing they want to
[1:53:46] do your your sisters will not be able to
[1:53:48] trust
[1:53:50] you she's looking for the boy that can
[1:53:52] can be able to stand up for
[1:53:54] her not a young man you just just
[1:53:57] swallow up into video games and don't
[1:53:59] even know what is happening around the
[1:54:01] house who's going to trust
[1:54:07] you why because that is the place where
[1:54:10] you grow into
[1:54:12] fatherhood the one that come to adoption
[1:54:14] is the one that is interested in the
[1:54:17] inheritance of the family
[1:54:23] and your sisters are also part of your
[1:54:28] inheritance when they can watch you and
[1:54:31] and they can look at you and you you
[1:54:32] look like an
[1:54:34] example then pretty soon they don't want
[1:54:36] to talk to Dad they want to talk to
[1:54:41] you because they know they can talk to
[1:54:43] you they can have a conversation with
[1:54:47] you you will not just support them but
[1:54:50] y'all will be able to talk praise the
[1:54:54] Lord and many times when a girl can be
[1:54:56] able to find a brother like that she
[1:54:59] would take his
[1:55:03] word it's not your size or your degree
[1:55:06] they looking at your character how you
[1:55:08] are composing
[1:55:12] yourself it's a place of
[1:55:16] adoption praise the Lord like I said I I
[1:55:19] mean uh Western culture takes things
[1:55:22] from the Bible and we don't and we don't
[1:55:25] look them
[1:55:28] through where we take our special gwn
[1:55:31] from wedding day and our ring wedding
[1:55:34] day the man giving the woman the ring is
[1:55:36] from adoption ceremony it's completely
[1:55:38] different from the from a wedding
[1:55:41] ceremony in the wedding ceremony the man
[1:55:45] crowns the
[1:55:47] woman that's why that woman was sweeping
[1:55:50] and looking for one of the thing coins
[1:55:51] that fell from from her crown the man
[1:55:54] crowns the woman he takes the veil over
[1:55:56] the woman head he unveil her and then he
[1:55:59] puts his crown on her head with all of
[1:56:02] those all of those things uh uh virtues
[1:56:05] and different things that he put
[1:56:07] there but the Western culture we have
[1:56:10] gravitated to an adoption ceremony it's
[1:56:13] an adoption ceremony where the father
[1:56:15] dressed the son in a special
[1:56:20] garment the the the story of the
[1:56:22] prodical son and take a ring and put it
[1:56:25] on his finger and his name is as good as
[1:56:29] on the check as his father's
[1:56:32] name are we together praise the Lord
[1:56:37] amen now you see Western culture we
[1:56:40] takes
[1:56:41] that for our wedding
[1:56:44] ceremony but then the woman don't want
[1:56:46] to take the man's
[1:56:50] name praise the lord we are adopting
[1:56:52] that we get a gown we get a ring but she
[1:56:56] wanted a man
[1:56:58] name we get the whole thing mess
[1:57:05] up are we
[1:57:09] together that's why I'm supposed to be
[1:57:11] preaching your father's day's
[1:57:18] message Happy Father's day anyway
[1:57:22] at least I told you happy Father's Day
[1:57:24] if I don't say anything about Father's
[1:57:26] Day at least I told you happy Father's
[1:57:28] Day praise the
[1:57:32] Lord you see many times it's a it's an
[1:57:38] attribute that we don't appreciate until
[1:57:41] we don't have them
[1:57:44] anymore praise the
[1:57:47] lord it's an attribute that we don't
[1:57:49] appreciate
[1:57:53] a young man grow up and and you know
[1:57:55] he's seing his muscles and seeing him
[1:57:57] himself and you know his train of beard
[1:57:59] is coming on his chain he keeps hauling
[1:58:02] it keeps hauling it just wait they will
[1:58:03] grow you don't have to ha it you didn't
[1:58:06] haul the first
[1:58:08] one praise the
[1:58:11] Lord and then pretty soon that you you
[1:58:14] think we can exchange words and you know
[1:58:16] we we can we can let them know what is
[1:58:18] on our mind and we can do all of
[1:58:20] that but
[1:58:23] uh that's not what is designed
[1:58:26] for praise the Lord the same
[1:58:30] way is the father that brings the son to
[1:58:33] adoption is also the father that brings
[1:58:37] the daughter to
[1:58:39] Redemption praise the Lord that's why we
[1:58:42] just read there over in Numbers Chapter
[1:58:44] 30 he brings the daughter to Redemption
[1:58:47] what is there I mean he's there he's the
[1:58:49] one that he's supposed to be there to
[1:58:51] protect her to get her ready to turn her
[1:58:53] over to the next
[1:58:57] headship praise the
[1:59:02] Lord and that's the reason why many of
[1:59:04] our home
[1:59:10] struggle because we don't think about
[1:59:12] those
[1:59:13] responsibilities we don't think about
[1:59:15] those things that we supposed to do
[1:59:19] praise the Lord with the responsibility
[1:59:21] that comes with uh with with
[1:59:25] fatherhood and the things that uh that
[1:59:29] we are called to
[1:59:31] do is a place of
[1:59:35] respect and you know I read a quot here
[1:59:38] to you from
[1:59:41] respect but
[1:59:45] uh I was looking at this word one time I
[1:59:49] came across a meaning of the word resp
[1:59:52] ECT it's actually coming came out of a
[1:59:56] Latin
[1:59:57] word from where they get the name
[2:00:05] spectacles spectacles that's what that
[2:00:07] word respect came
[2:00:09] from and
[2:00:12] read is to
[2:00:15] repeat so the word respect means look
[2:00:19] again
[2:00:22] look again look the second
[2:00:25] time maybe you have to look from a
[2:00:28] different
[2:00:30] angle but look
[2:00:34] again oh a person might do something and
[2:00:37] and and you just think that uh you know
[2:00:39] it's it's so horrible how how can you do
[2:00:42] this and just because of that act you
[2:00:45] dress the person with that action that
[2:00:48] they have done
[2:00:52] and you just despise
[2:00:54] them no look again look from another
[2:00:58] angle you know brother talks about those
[2:01:00] couple that went down there in France
[2:01:03] and they were looking at the the
[2:01:05] crucifix they went under the crucifix
[2:01:07] and they were looking at it it was
[2:01:09] looking like a horrible
[2:01:10] picture the man of the gardian told them
[2:01:13] no you are looking wrong come here let
[2:01:15] me show you took them to another angle
[2:01:17] when they look at it they saw Christ on
[2:01:18] the tree
[2:01:22] sometimes it's the way that we are
[2:01:24] looking it's what we are looking at for
[2:01:27] the
[2:01:29] moment and many times the thing for the
[2:01:31] moment do not Define the
[2:01:33] person for you to disrespect them it
[2:01:37] goes either
[2:01:39] way we must respect anybody everybody
[2:01:43] the children must be respected the
[2:01:44] parents must be respected the people on
[2:01:46] the street must be respected Christians
[2:01:49] are people that supposed to hold value
[2:01:51] of respect yes sir because we have the
[2:01:54] grace to look at things from different
[2:01:56] angle to know that we were once
[2:02:04] lost look
[2:02:06] again if not change your
[2:02:10] glasses if you are using one way to look
[2:02:12] at
[2:02:19] things that's what the prophet of God
[2:02:21] would tell us how God demand
[2:02:24] respect there in the book of Isaiah he
[2:02:26] says look unto me all ye ends of the
[2:02:30] Earth there's a verse in the book of
[2:02:33] Isaiah he said look unto
[2:02:38] me it depends how you are
[2:02:44] looking now will read something here in
[2:02:48] from the message respect brother of God
[2:02:50] says here then the man told me the other
[2:02:52] day poor man swept up uh over year in
[2:02:56] the market for a
[2:02:58] living He sweep in the market for a

[2:04:25] than three months from them one of them
[2:04:28] was dead and the two was in an insan
[2:04:33] Institute
[2:04:36] now you know some of these things they
[2:04:38] sound funny to you but uh uh
[2:04:43] uh they they they are very
[2:04:46] serious I have a I have a good good
[2:04:49] friend very good friend
[2:04:52] many years back that should be back
[2:04:54] around uh
[2:04:56] 19
[2:05:00] 1998 a preacher had a
[2:05:03] crusade he just moved to the city where
[2:05:05] we were and he invited
[2:05:08] me because most of the guys there was
[2:05:11] one time a friend came here to visit I
[2:05:13] had him to greet the church and I told
[2:05:15] you how he you know he took care of me
[2:05:17] he was just my friend many of them will
[2:05:20] come you know to sell in our in our
[2:05:23] place so uh uh uh they knew this guy
[2:05:27] because the preacher he was a Nigerian
[2:05:29] so one of the brothers uh that you would
[2:05:31] come to our church told him about me I
[2:05:33] didn't know about me know about him but
[2:05:35] he sent for me so I went to meet him he
[2:05:37] asked me and he says you know i' like
[2:05:39] for you to preach on my crusade I said
[2:05:40] okay
[2:05:42] so I preached that night and
[2:05:47] uh and the Lord really gave us a
[2:05:50] breakthrough we had a good meeting
[2:05:53] and then after them many many of the
[2:05:55] guys the business guys they will come
[2:05:56] they will come to our little Fellowship
[2:05:58] we had a very very little small Church
[2:06:01] very little small church I hope one of
[2:06:03] these days I can be able to De out some
[2:06:05] of the photos and show you made of touch
[2:06:08] and all of that they started coming so
[2:06:11] this this young
[2:06:13] man Jude good friend of mine he started
[2:06:16] coming to church and you know uh uh uh
[2:06:19] he came out of out of uh Catholic faith
[2:06:23] and and you know he was he was one of
[2:06:25] these guys that were that were very you
[2:06:27] know he was he was very rough on all of
[2:06:29] these uh Prosperity preaching and all of
[2:06:32] that so when he came to church and and
[2:06:35] you know realized you know uh uh the
[2:06:37] Lord was helping us to to present the
[2:06:39] word you know he committed himself and
[2:06:41] got baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:06:44] Jesus and then uh he will he will have
[2:06:48] his uh first
[2:06:50] communion and I mean he was a business
[2:06:52] guy you know so I mean he was he was a
[2:06:55] great help to to our little group and a
[2:06:57] great help to me
[2:07:00] so we went and got the wine we got the
[2:07:03] communion ready we did the communion
[2:07:05] that night and he was he was it blew his
[2:07:07] mind you know especially uh feet washing
[2:07:10] and all of that I remember I had a
[2:07:12] Pentecostal friend that came came with a
[2:07:15] pastor that night and uh uh uh uh and
[2:07:19] now this this guy is he's not a message
[2:07:21] preacher started a church somewhere
[2:07:23] there in Liberia so uh I mean that's
[2:07:25] that's the first time they will see you
[2:07:27] because they you know they do things
[2:07:29] that like the way to do back there you
[2:07:30] know they use their wford and their
[2:07:32] grape juice so the pastor wife that
[2:07:34] night she refused to to take the
[2:07:36] communion because she she said no this
[2:07:38] wine I don't drink alcohol you know she
[2:07:40] know all of that and uh uh uh and you
[2:07:44] know we did the communion and all of
[2:07:46] that I could tell you different stories
[2:07:48] all over there but this guy Je
[2:07:52] after after the communion
[2:07:55] service in his mind he thought that oh
[2:07:59] wow we use this wine for communion so he
[2:08:03] went back to the
[2:08:06] supermarket and bought the same exact
[2:08:09] wine and bought even a biger gallon of
[2:08:13] it and took it
[2:08:16] home and uh uh you know and you know he
[2:08:20] started
[2:08:22] every time he's having meal he will
[2:08:23] drink
[2:08:24] wine because in his mind if we can use
[2:08:28] it for communion then I can drink
[2:08:31] it praise the lord it's it sound funny
[2:08:34] to you but it had a ey
[2:08:37] end it had its high end because you
[2:08:40] don't play with the things of
[2:08:42] God if you don't understand ask question
[2:08:46] so one day I came down to his house and
[2:08:49] I was visiting with him you know he
[2:08:50] would Coke and then you will invite me
[2:08:52] with car go in and eat and and when I
[2:08:54] look I saw the so I asked him as as as
[2:08:57] said JW what are you doing he he says
[2:08:59] that's that's the wine what we use for
[2:09:00] the
[2:09:01] communion I just bought this one for my
[2:09:04] house so I told him I I said no I said
[2:09:07] no you know uh the wine for the
[2:09:10] communion does not means that we must
[2:09:12] drink wine if we only do it because
[2:09:15] that's what the scripture says and we do
[2:09:18] it at that time of the communion
[2:09:21] you know and uh and he got into a little
[2:09:24] bit of an
[2:09:25] argument and I realized that okay I
[2:09:28] think something was wrong and and that
[2:09:31] is the way with many many of our young
[2:09:33] people you know they come they sit in
[2:09:36] the service and uh uh uh uh they so
[2:09:39] eager to take communion they want to be
[2:09:41] baptized the moment they come they eat
[2:09:42] the bread they take the wine they
[2:09:44] realize that okay this is the thing I
[2:09:45] wanted then the next time they are not
[2:09:47] coming then they start fooling around
[2:09:55] they get so eager because they want to
[2:09:57] come to communion so that you know they
[2:09:58] go and tell their parent I want to be
[2:10:00] baptized I want to be baptized I want to
[2:10:02] be baptized just so they can come in
[2:10:04] line and take the communion after that
[2:10:06] to them is is it is it the thing I was
[2:10:08] struggling
[2:10:15] for communion is not party
[2:10:20] food it's it's not parul for you to
[2:10:22] think that they are leaving you
[2:10:30] out and this friend of mine Jewel his
[2:10:33] life took a wrong
[2:10:39] turn and he would die very sorry for
[2:10:42] death very sorry for
[2:10:46] death took a wrong turn I mean this guy
[2:10:49] was I mean he was he was was really
[2:10:52] helpful to the church I mean supportive
[2:10:55] and all of that when he got into that
[2:10:58] Rebellion he would come to
[2:11:01] church you know he will Evol me in all
[2:11:04] of that before you realized he started
[2:11:07] running with the wrong crowd and running
[2:11:09] you know picking girls and things that
[2:11:11] he he got himself
[2:11:15] from and I will hear that my friend Jew
[2:11:18] was sick I went to look for him
[2:11:22] I went to look for him the last time I
[2:11:24] saw
[2:11:25] him I almost I
[2:11:28] cried you
[2:11:30] know and then just in a period of time
[2:11:33] his life was
[2:11:49] taken you can dis respect
[2:11:52] God you have got to respect
[2:11:55] God if you don't believe it just keep
[2:12:00] still keep away from it or
[2:12:05] either do that or come reverent and
[2:12:08] respect it don't make fun of people in
[2:12:12] the
[2:12:13] spirit and I see that
[2:12:17] year parents is your
[2:12:20] responsibility to teach your
[2:12:24] children it's your
[2:12:32] responsibility praise the
[2:12:35] Lord if you can cry in church and
[2:12:38] somebody is crying that's not your
[2:12:40] business don't make it your dining room
[2:12:46] talk don't make it your dining room talk
[2:12:52] if you hear somebody praying and you
[2:12:53] don't know what they are saying don't
[2:12:55] make it your ding room it's so
[2:12:59] easy in reverence and disrespect is one
[2:13:03] of the easier way to take an evil
[2:13:09] spirit it's one of the easier way to
[2:13:12] take an evil spirit and it can ruin your
[2:13:14] life forever if God don't be merciful
[2:13:31] oh I could tell you I could tell you
[2:13:35] stories I could tell you
[2:13:38] things that I've
[2:13:40] seen in my little walk with the
[2:13:44] Lord I could share things with you this
[2:13:47] morning that will shake you in your
[2:13:49] bones
[2:13:51] don't make fun of people in the spirit
[2:13:53] don't talk about people that are
[2:13:54] worshiping in the spirit of God let them
[2:13:59] alone leave them
[2:14:02] alone don't say that other person they
[2:14:04] just shouting that other person that's
[2:14:06] not your
[2:14:09] business it's not your
[2:14:18] business we must have the Liberty to
[2:14:20] express
[2:14:21] ourself before our
[2:14:35] father are we together okay I realized
[2:14:39] that I've gone over my time here and uh
[2:14:44] your fatherday meal is waiting for
[2:14:47] you I just read few things here and then
[2:14:49] I close up
[2:14:51] I actually got out of what I wanted to
[2:14:53] preach this morning just to bring this
[2:14:55] father day's thing so I'm not too gear
[2:14:58] up in it that's why you see me all over
[2:15:00] the place but Happy Father's
[2:15:04] Day Israel and the church the father was
[2:15:06] the priest of the house in the old
[2:15:09] Sanctuary the old time the father always
[2:15:13] was the priest and he had to watch over
[2:15:16] his
[2:15:19] household praise the Lord
[2:15:23] he had to watch over his
[2:15:29] household glory be to
[2:15:32] God what a change today the kids wash
[2:15:35] over the Dead In This Modern word but
[2:15:38] the father was to watch over his house
[2:15:40] he killed the lamb he took the house up
[2:15:43] and and and and he put the blood on the
[2:15:45] Lage of the doorpost and that was their
[2:15:49] protection they stay in it that's the
[2:15:51] place of the father he's there to be the
[2:15:57] protector praise the Lord you might have
[2:16:00] more degree than him but God plac him
[2:16:03] there it pleased God for him to be your
[2:16:11] father and that's that's the reason why
[2:16:13] when when God help a child that is able
[2:16:16] to gravitate towards that and and and
[2:16:18] and and and can be there for for the
[2:16:20] parent parents and and and and all of
[2:16:23] that it's it's it's something that is so
[2:16:26] pleasing to the
[2:16:29] father praise the lord it's something
[2:16:32] that is just so pleasing to the
[2:16:47] father I'll take one more year and then
[2:16:49] I'll let you go
[2:16:54] yeah yeah him a man is not measured by
[2:16:57] how much muzzle he
[2:16:59] got whether he get six pack or eight
[2:17:02] packs man in the scripture is not
[2:17:05] measured that way that's just a
[2:17:10] beast I have seen men that weighed 200
[2:17:13] lbs and didn't have an arms of men in
[2:17:15] them they would throw a baby out of a
[2:17:18] mother's arm and ravish her that's not a
[2:17:23] man that is a bro a man is measured by
[2:17:34] character there never was a man like
[2:17:36] Christ
[2:17:37] Jesus never was a character like
[2:17:41] that man is measured by
[2:17:44] character and I said man is not measured
[2:17:48] by his big arms but
[2:17:52] the bags in the knees of his
[2:17:56] pens a man is measured by his praying
[2:18:02] ground the strength of a man is measured
[2:18:06] by his praying
[2:18:08] ground his strength is measured by how
[2:18:11] much time he spent before God and cry to
[2:18:14] God some other things that we want to
[2:18:15] change if we would just spend time
[2:18:19] praying we will have time
[2:18:32] talking but his
[2:18:34] bags of knes in his pains where he's
[2:18:37] been
[2:18:39] praying that's what measured a man
[2:18:42] that's why there was no man like our
[2:18:45] lord
[2:18:46] Jesus right from his youth he heard how
[2:18:49] they call him illegitimate a
[2:18:52] child he saw the rejection God embod in
[2:18:56] that flesh yet he will find a time aside
[2:19:01] and
[2:19:03] prayed was he praying for himself he was
[2:19:06] interceding for the very people that
[2:19:08] were insulting
[2:19:10] him interceding for the very people that
[2:19:13] was rejecting
[2:19:15] him in his final days on the earth in
[2:19:17] the garden of gsan he prayed so hard
[2:19:22] until his sweat was as thick as his
[2:19:26] blood father forgave
[2:19:30] them that's what a man is not a man
[2:19:34] that's ready to vent and ready to to to
[2:19:37] to show blow and all of
[2:19:42] that that's what animus
[2:19:45] does that's not you attacked and they're
[2:19:48] ready to attack you back
[2:19:55] may God help us as we come to the close
[2:19:58] of
[2:19:59] this May the Almighty God help us you
[2:20:02] know the our society the society is
[2:20:05] getting to where it is to its lowest
[2:20:08] point
[2:20:11] because manhood has been
[2:20:14] destroyed praise the
[2:20:16] Lord all of these men that are
[2:20:18] gravitating to become women and all of
[2:20:20] that and and and uh uh uh you see the
[2:20:24] you see the weakness you see uh uh H H
[2:20:27] men that are backing off from their
[2:20:29] responsibility and many and many mothers
[2:20:32] have to have to raise their children to
[2:20:33] become a dad and man in a man in the
[2:20:36] house and all of that that that that is
[2:20:39] the thing that is destroying because the
[2:20:40] structure that God
[2:20:43] set the structure that God said the one
[2:20:46] that's supposed to be the head of the
[2:20:49] society
[2:20:51] the head of the neighborhood you can't
[2:20:53] find
[2:20:56] him he's under the bridge carried away
[2:20:59] in
[2:21:01] drugs he's giving himself over to some
[2:21:04] kind of a sexual
[2:21:05] prostitution just want to be running
[2:21:07] around with women and making children
[2:21:09] all over the
[2:21:12] place now the society is
[2:21:17] vulnerable because just like we read
[2:21:19] here in numbers chapter chapter 30 it
[2:21:22] was the head of the home the head of the
[2:21:26] tribes when Moses would meet they would
[2:21:29] meet with the head of the tribes it was
[2:21:31] it was a man of every tribe a man of
[2:21:33] every home they come there they
[2:21:37] discuss how to be able to defend their
[2:21:42] home praise the
[2:21:47] Lord and that the very same thing that
[2:21:49] is destroying the societ
[2:21:51] is the same thing that is destroying the
[2:21:54] church when the church used to have
[2:21:57] praying men you don't find them
[2:22:00] anymore you don't find them
[2:22:02] anymore we make all the excuses why we
