[0:51] faith moses had to do it elijah had to

[1:56] he cried all the way through the
[1:58] wilderness never junction he cried
[2:00] continually crying to the people elijah
[2:02] was very unpopular in his day because he
[2:06] cried out against that age
[2:09] he certainly was john the baptist is
[2:11] very unpopular in his age he cried out
[2:14] against his age he said to the king the
[2:17] potent tape of the of the land he had
[2:20] married his brother's wife he had to
[2:22] preach on marriage and divorce one
[2:23] morning
[2:24] so he cried against him
[2:26] that it's not lawful for you to have her
[2:29] it costed him his head to be cut off
[2:31] later but he cried out and he stood to
[2:34] his post of duty he never took a ship to
[2:36] tarshish and said well i'll agree with
[2:38] you harry it's all right as long as you
[2:40] think she's a nice woman she's making a
[2:41] nice wife go ahead hold mercy them dish
[2:44] rags
[2:45] yeah yes
[2:46] every little thing
[2:48] well it's nothing to clean dirty plates
[2:50] with but notice
[2:53] john wasn't that way he faced right up
[2:55] to it he said it's not lawful for you to
[2:58] have her yes sir and he stood out
[3:00] against it
[3:01] they never run john didn't they stood in
[3:03] face the facts moses tried to run one
[3:06] time like jonah but god brought him back
[3:08] many of them tried to get away from it
[3:10] they'd start but look if god has called
[3:12] you and you're sure that god's in that
[3:15] message there's nothing going to turn
[3:16] you back
[3:18] it didn't turn jonah
[3:20] no sir
[3:21] amos of old cried out the lion is roared
[3:25] who can but fear
[3:27] and goddess fake who can but prophesy
[3:30] who can but prophesy when you see god
[3:33] speaks and said a certain thing will
[3:34] happen there it is
[3:37] the lion roars everybody's scared
[3:39] yes sir if you ever heard one roar in a
[3:41] jungle you hear these now and around
[3:43] these cages out here them tame lines but
[3:45] you already hear a real wild one roar
[3:47] one time little rocks will fall off the
[3:49] hill
[3:49] 500 yards away i don't see where all
[3:51] that belch comes out of them lungs and
[3:53] he throws his head down throws that fur
[3:55] up i never heard any like a cannon going
[3:58] off when he
[3:59] belches out that big roar in his lungs
[4:01] who couldn't be scared to say if you
[4:02] ever killed by a line it's painless he
[4:04] scares you to death before he gets to
[4:06] you
[4:07] you don't notice it he scares you with
[4:09] that great fiocious roar and here he is
[4:11] only in a split second he said the lion
[4:13] has roared who can but fear and god is
[4:17] spoke
[4:18] who can be prophesied when you see god
[4:21] doing something you say it might not be
[4:23] a prophet jones said i might not be a
[4:24] prophet or the son of a prophet
[4:26] but god has spoke who can but prophesy
[4:29] i might not be a prophet i might not be
[4:31] this out of there when i see god doing
[4:33] anything and i see it you're an award
[4:34] and he promised it who can't hold their
[4:36] peace and keep still turret he's done it
[4:39] neither can we hide behind creeds and
[4:42] all these your fellowships and down to
[4:45] the tarshish we don't want to go and
[4:46] fellowship
[4:47] but many like adam do the same thing try
[4:50] to make a substitute in some way try to
[4:52] find a way out and and make a substitute
[4:54] to face god if they know in the wrong
[4:56] faced up to the truth went on with his
[4:58] wife and did exactly what god told him
[5:00] not to do he went right ahead and did it
[5:02] anyhow then he found himself naked
[5:04] she and he both in the garden of eden
[5:06] their eyes come open they know what was
[5:08] right and wrong man and then he tried to
[5:10] find a substitute to kind of cover
[5:12] himself up with it now that's just about
[5:14] the way we do that an excuse say well
[5:16] i'll tell you if it was here if this or
[5:18] if if that's this thing but you must
[5:21] face up to it it's either right or wrong
[5:24] and if it's right let's stay by if it's
[5:26] wrong get away from it that's all get
[5:28] find out what is right you don't want to
[5:30] wait any longer let's find out now watch
[5:31] truth and what's right and stay with him
[5:34] we know that's true
[5:36] now we find today that our people are so
[5:39] it seems like all the sincerity has gone
[5:42] out of the churches
[5:43] uh
[5:44] and uh we are living in a house there of
[5:46] a precious sister that comes to this
[5:48] church she's probably sitting here
[5:49] tonight and she rinsed it out to her the
[5:52] people and she's just been so sweet to
[5:54] us about that place about letting us
[5:56] have that place and so i'd call her name
[5:59] but she might not want me to do it she's
[6:00] been so sweet to us well we certainly
[6:02] wouldn't want more to expose her but
[6:04] she's been a very very dear woman and in
[6:07] the house there was a television over
[6:09] one side we got a little uh two duplex i
[6:12] got a big fan and a bunch of youngins
[6:14] and we and you you know and they have to
[6:16] have beds and plenty of them and
[6:17] everything piled up on top we had to
[6:19] walk through this and through that to
[6:21] get in and out and then over there they
[6:23] had a television and in this uh a
[6:25] television these kids got to watching on
[6:28] sunday morning
[6:30] some kind of a hymn singing that come on
[6:33] and you know it it would almost make you
[6:36] ashamed that there wasn't a genuine
[6:37] christianity somewhere that you could
[6:39] put your hands on to see what's called
[6:40] christianity
[6:42] why it seems like all the sincerity's
[6:44] gone out of it
[6:45] well they don't they don't seem to why
[6:49] it's just terrible way to stand there
[6:51] and draw their fists and fight one other
[6:53] on there and try to sing hymns and
[6:54] everything like that and pull jokes that
[6:57] hardly you would a sailor would pull and
[7:00] say all kinds of things and kid and go
[7:02] on you know the sacredness
[7:04] of of christianity has seemed to lose
[7:08] its place
[7:09] i go to church and and see the pastor
[7:13] get up there and announce that
[7:15] there's going to be a swimming bee all
[7:17] the women these bathing suits they're
[7:19] all going out there they're going to
[7:20] have a contest these women swimming and
[7:23] they're going to have a a party of some
[7:25] sort and they're going to fry up a lot
[7:27] of a chicken and play bunco and and all
[7:30] these things like that
[7:31] to me that takes the genuine sincerity
[7:34] out of christianity
[7:37] just get by with anything i
[7:40] seen
[7:42] coming
[7:43] up here we find out
[7:45] you know we find more of our sisters
[7:47] wearing shorts up here in this coal
[7:49] country than you find them out there in
[7:51] that hot country
[7:52] okay it's true out there where it's
[7:54] really hot
[7:56] not too many of them it wear them but
[7:58] here were where it's cold they do it see
[8:01] it's they don't realize it's a devil
[8:02] doing that
[8:04] now if it's to be comfortable if it's to
[8:05] help yourself it'd be different
[8:08] be man i think it looks sickly on a man
[8:11] but it but yeah
[8:13] you
[8:14] wouldn't pay attention to a man
[8:16] but the lady her body is sacred and she
[8:20] must keep it that way and um the ceo you
[8:23] can see people today these two spirits
[8:26] and one of them is a holy spirit the
[8:27] other is an unholy spirit
[8:29] and one's governed by and both of them
[8:31] religious
[8:32] uh that's a strange part they're both
[8:35] religious
[8:36] and just like esau and jacob was both
[8:38] religious like cain and abel was both
[8:41] religious like judas and jesus was both
[8:44] religion
[8:45] both religious
[8:46] and we see it today
[8:48] both sides religious
[8:50] see it's the same spirit the people die
[8:53] but the spirit doesn't die it goes right
[8:55] on both religious one of them is
[8:57] possessed with the holy spirit
[8:59] that lives the kind of life that they
[9:01] should live and walk godly and honest
[9:04] they wouldn't beat you out of a penny
[9:05] and they they do everything honest that
[9:07] they could to help you and others or
[9:09] just as nice as they can be and the
[9:11] others we find out it's just vice versa
[9:14] and yet both of them are religious
[9:16] spirits two of them
[9:18] one holy spirit and the other
[9:20] unholy spirit and but if you notice
[9:23] it'll
[9:23] even though claiming religion they'll
[9:25] make fun of you and call you holy roller
[9:27] they do anything they can
[9:29] they're ignoring the the unchanging word
[9:33] of god as though it never had been
[9:35] written thing you can see now look at
[9:37] here if if the baptism i have the holy
[9:41] spirit and stand there that cigar in
[9:43] your hands
[9:44] yes i have the holy spirit i don't think
[9:46] it's wrong to take a little drink i
[9:48] don't think see as you notice i don't
[9:50] think but god thinks difference is he
[9:52] according to his words
[9:54] they and they they just simply as much
[9:56] as spit on it that's exactly right just
[10:00] as much as this little crippled guy that
[10:02] crawled out that time when david was
[10:04] being uh excommunicated from his throne
[10:07] he's going up on the mount of olives
[10:09] going out weeping as he went up looking
[10:11] back and this little fellow crawled out
[10:13] there and spitting on him and that guard
[10:15] said i'll let that dog's head stay on
[10:17] him spit on my king david said let him
[10:19] alone see they spit on him about 800
[10:22] years later they spit on his son jesus
[10:25] christ too and today
[10:28] get on it again as if it wasn't even
[10:30] just i
[10:31] reverend unconcerned just turn up their
[10:34] head and walk away from it laugh in your
[10:36] face why is it they only ship the
[10:38] tarshish after that this call to god you
[10:41] got to crowd against evil cried against
[10:43] sin cry against the things that's wrong
[10:46] now
[10:47] remember
[10:48] it'll be
[10:50] hey you know this time you know i'm two
[10:53] hours difference in tucson's just 10
[10:55] minutes after 7.
[10:58] i'm getting kind of uh kind of out of my
[11:01] place sure huh all right now remember
[11:03] we're going to have to answer for it
[11:05] remember those who spit on christ answer
[11:07] for it when david returned back from his
[11:10] exile when he was a fugitive and when he
[11:12] returned back remember this fellow fell
[11:14] on his face and cried out for mercy he
[11:16] spit on david going out but he was
[11:18] almost ready to bathe his feet with
[11:20] tears and when he returned back and
[11:23] someday those who pierced jesus will see
[11:25] it and those who are piercing him today
[11:27] will see it also
[11:29] someday it'll come back remember
[11:31] revelations 22 he requires us to keep
[11:33] every word that he has written every
[11:36] word
[11:37] now we know his presence are here it's
[11:39] vindicated we're having we're trusting
[11:42] in this coming week they'll continue to
[11:43] be uh vindicated among us the sick will
[11:46] be healed and great things will be
[11:48] taking place we don't want the proper
[11:50] idea we want the truth now we know we
[11:53] won't don't want to we don't want to
[11:55] face up to nothing but what god has said
[11:57] is the truth
[11:58] but be sure that your sins will always
[12:00] find you out if it doesn't here it'll
[12:02] get you to judgment so
[12:03] you're it's going to catch you somewhere
[12:05] now that's your buddy if you are a true
[12:07] christian truly call like jonah was
[12:10] god's already got your fair paid get off
[12:13] of that ship going to tarshish
[12:16] god predestinated you to this life
[12:18] yes sir if you're a true call child of
[12:21] god
[12:23] come to christ come into the fullness of
[12:25] him your waste paid to where it's paid
[12:28] to nineveh
[12:30] dr tarshish you're predestinated your
[12:33] shift is a ship leaving right now on its
[12:36] road so there's only one thing to do is
[12:38] get on it
[12:39] and if you was like god you'll never
[12:41] have no peace like my little nephew a
[12:43] while ago about 10 years now he's one
[12:46] from pillar to post someone he goes to
[12:48] this church this catholic church down
[12:49] here and take this when he calls what
[12:51] some holy father talks about over here
[12:53] and some other over here and some over
[12:54] here what does it all amount to see now
[12:57] he's still hungry and thirsting i said
[12:59] your place is at the altar down there
[13:00] something there's no way of getting out
[13:03] of it when god ever takes out after you
[13:05] you just might as well give up and go on
[13:07] that's all
[13:08] remember god we're like god was in the
[13:11] boat god was in the storm god was in the
[13:13] fish everywhere he turned god was there
[13:16] see god's there and he'll just keep
[13:18] haunting at you so why don't we wait any
[13:20] longer let's just start this revival
[13:22] right
[13:24] right what you're waiting on we believe
[13:26] that the coming of the lord is at hand
[13:28] and he's going to have a bride and it
[13:29] ready
[13:30] we don't want no ships to any tarshish
[13:33] we're going to nineveh
[13:35] we're going to glory
[13:37] amen that's right we're going to work
[13:39] god's going to bless and that's what we
[13:40] want to do lay out in the presence of
[13:43] god damn with our hearts not
[13:45] our hands so much but our hearts before
[13:47] god until he seasoned us through and
[13:49] through like that with a rays of his
[13:52] glory and baked into us his his goodness
[13:55] and ripen that which we have got into
[13:57] reality see or we can show others that
[14:01] jesus christ lived oh my we want to
[14:04] believe that and
[14:05] remember where jonah went
[14:07] god was in the boat
[14:09] god was in the storm god was in the fish
[14:12] he went on being right along with jonah
[14:14] until his perfect will was done
[14:18] that's right and if he's ever after you
[14:20] you might dodge over here and dodge over
[14:22] there but you'll be miserable until you
[14:25] come back and do the thing you started
[14:27] out before you do it the first place see
[14:29] don't go run from the presence of god
[14:32] face up to it if you believe it's the
[14:34] truth then if it is the truth it's worth
[14:36] living for dying for anything else and
[14:39] if he's ever vindicated you that is the
[14:41] truth then we can't run from it no word
[14:44] he'll be right there just the same you
[14:46] can't do that by his provided prophet
[14:49] the one he ordained to go down there and
[14:51] call that message now it looked like he
[14:52] could have sent another prophet
[14:55] but he ordained jonah
[14:59] and even elijah wouldn't have done
[15:02] jeremiah wouldn't have done
[15:04] moses wouldn't have done it was jonah
[15:07] had to go to nineveh that's all there
[15:09] was to it he commissioned him and told
[15:12] him to go in when he says go there jonah
[15:15] go to nineveh nobody else can go do that
[15:18] but jonah
[15:19] and when god tells you something you've
[15:22] got to do
[15:24] nobody else see we just have to face up
[15:26] to it and and go do it we believe that
[15:29] we're living in the hour that when god
[15:31] isn't doing something
[15:33] we believe that we're living among them
[15:35] now
[15:36] i believe tonight i'm preaching to that
[15:38] congregation
[15:40] that it's laying waiting out there just
[15:42] to get right i i really believe that
[15:45] with all my heart i would say it's the
[15:47] same now as it's always been now we
[15:49] believe that the hours come that saint
[15:51] john 14 12 must be fulfilled we we
[15:54] believe that malachi 4 must be fulfilled
[15:57] we believe in luke 17 30 must be
[15:59] fulfilled we believe that all these
[16:01] prophecies that he said would come to
[16:02] pass in this day we believe they must be
[16:05] fulfilled and we believe we're seeing
[16:07] and fulfill right now
[16:10] that's exactly right stop running
[16:13] don't get out of his presence just move
[16:15] up into his presence
[16:16] that's right and i know that's what
[16:18] you're desiring to do because i've seen
[16:20] license out there from texas and
[16:22] louisiana and everywhere that's what
[16:24] we're here for is not to run from his
[16:26] presence but to run into his presence
[16:29] come back get off
[16:31] been a jonah if you've been wondering
[16:33] which way to go or what to do
[16:35] come on get on the ship with us tonight
[16:36] we're going down to tarshish to cry out
[16:39] nineveh to cry out we're letting that
[16:41] tarshish ship go on down if we want to
[16:43] we've got a duty before god that's a
[16:46] message that we're responsible for so in

[16:50] prelude tonight to let you know when i'm

[18:01] from almighty god as i stand here
[18:05] tonight and god knows that's true that
[18:07] right down on this river there's people
[18:09] perhaps sitting here when that angel of
[18:10] the lord come down there and told me
[18:12] what he did right there in 1933 right
[18:14] down this spring street year if you're a
[18:16] stranger here drive right off corner of
[18:18] spring street there where hit the river
[18:19] and there's where it happened
[18:21] that's been in 1933 it's probably been
[18:24] about 32 years ago and oh it's been 30
[18:26] it's been 30 32 years ago
[18:29] 32 years ago and how that he's brought
[18:32] that right down everything and we've
[18:34] went out bringing the message and seen
[18:36] the sick heal the blind and crippled and
[18:39] lame and halt and everything then seen
[18:42] even the dead that we know that's been
[18:44] verified raised up from the dead that
[18:46] people die and raised right back to life
[18:48] again and all these things if a message
[18:50] goes forth or signs and wonders and you
[18:53] still see that same old school of
[18:54] thought that you come up with that
[18:56] didn't come from god god don't just have
[18:58] to do god is trying to get your
[19:00] attention attracted to something and
[19:02] then when jesus went out he started
[19:04] healing the sick and doing great works
[19:05] and things he always jesus did it and
[19:07] moses and jesus done it in the rest of
[19:09] them and when he was sure he did it and
[19:11] he's doing it the same thing today when
[19:12] he sends forth a meeting like that
[19:14] revivals and starts a meeting in the
[19:16] earth and starts moving along with these
[19:19] great signs and wonders and then you see
[19:20] come back that same old school of
[19:22] teaching
[19:23] there's something wrong there somewhere
[19:25] there's something new coming forth when
[19:27] jesus came out after one he is a fine
[19:30] rabbi he could go to any pulpit and
[19:32] preach when he was healing the sick well
[19:34] they like to have him over there but one
[19:35] day when he stood down and said i and my
[19:37] father are one
[19:39] brother he wasn't so popper after that
[19:41] when he said except you eat my flesh and
[19:43] drink my blood you have no life in you
[19:45] but he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[19:46] blood has everlasting life and i'll
[19:48] raise him up for the last day
[19:50] then he wasn't the proper man said this
[19:52] man's a vampire this man's a beelzebub
[19:55] that's where he done them things he
[19:56] could tell fortunes he looked through
[19:58] the their minds and perceived their
[19:59] thoughts he's a fortune teller what was
[20:01] he he was the word of god made manifest
[20:04] for that hour and he was duty bound he
[20:06] said i do always that which is pleasing
[20:09] to my father
[20:10] god help us to do the same thing do that
[20:12] which is pleasing to the father and i
[20:14] hope you all understand if you disagree
[20:16] with me on these messages and things
[20:18] that you'll remember at least have this
[20:20] respect that i have a responsibility and
[20:22] i'm not going to tarsha i'm on the road
[20:25] to nineveh i got to cry out the lord

[21:18] that clear understanding it's there that

[22:06] deepness of sincerity i pray dear god

[22:13] over they'll they'll understand that the
[22:16] question that's so great in their mind
[22:18] tonight will be settled granted lord
[22:21] there's some here who doesn't know your
[22:23] father as savior yet or maybe it's never
[22:26] been filled with the holy spirit may
[22:28] this be that night
[22:30] lord i cannot feel nobody with the holy
[22:33] ghost neither can i save anybody
[22:36] i can only tell them what you said
[22:38] blessed are they that do hunger and
[22:40] thirst for righteousness or they shall
[22:42] be filled now i pray god
[22:45] that you'll create such a hunger in
[22:47] their hearts
[22:48] many lord they've got to be hungry how
[22:50] would they drive these hundreds of miles
[22:52] through ice and everything and over
[22:53] rainy mountains and across deserts
[22:55] they'll come to a little old place
[22:57] sitting here on the corner
[23:00] then i think again you said where the
[23:02] carcasses the eagles will be gathered
[23:05] fetus lord
[23:07] upon thy divine manna
[23:09] give to our souls that what we really
[23:11] need

[23:14] your hands now

[23:18] the mountain the other day up there
[23:20] i pray that he'll saturate every heart
[23:23] in here with his goodness and mercy with
[23:25] understanding
[23:27] we realize father that's what we need is
[23:29] to understand
[23:31] or if we do not know what we're doing
[23:33] then how do we know how to do it but we
[23:36] must have understanding
[23:38] as daniel said he had understanding by
[23:41] the prophet jeremiah's writing
[23:44] father we have understanding
[23:46] by the holy spirit's writing as he will
[23:49] reveal it to us in this hour
[23:53] give to us lord the desires that we have
[23:56] for thee
[23:57] tenderly we ask this father for your
[23:59] glory in the name of jesus christ
