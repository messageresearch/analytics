any any type of surgery or any treatments or anything she loves the lord with all of her heart i hadn't seen her for many years but about four years ago i went up and i saw her one of the things that she told me right away was that she was excited to tell me that she had surrendered her her life to the lord and so when i i actually gave her a call yesterday and and she was saying telling me what was going on and i said well i said joanne i know you believe that god is a healer and you will get your healing one way or another and she's then she said absolutely so she uh she knew exactly what i

easy to bear like our sojourning through this life compared to eternity amen amen so uh hallelujah we'd like to speak on a subject this morning we pray it'd be a blessing to all of you we entitle it uh what house will you build me and uh the subject to get to get to our title uh the subject is the ten virgins friends or foes so we'll be looking into visions and parables uh but from an open book that's now being revealed to you and i in this stain and just to kind of uh warm up our hearts and minds uh to enter into this subject i'd like to read from revelation 6 to begin and verse one and two of course we all know it's uh john's vision of the first seal and it's in two verses but within these two verses those of you that study this message of this hour you realize that in two verses it's contained over 300 years of church history so so that so then we begin to realize there's much detail that isn't said in two verses but can be found elsewhere in the bible because wherever you have whenever you have a bible question then there's a bible answer for it to be found nowhere else if the question comes out of the scriptures the answer will be found there also revelation 6 says and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four be saying come and see so john seen a lamb the lamb opened the seal then john heard a voice he heard a noise as of a thunder so there was a lamb present this opening there was a thunder that sounded and one of the four beasts saying come and see so it wasn't a time of rebuke it wasn't a time of exhortation it was a teaching time yeah so all of these components had to be present in the literal sense when it unfolded when it actually took place not just the vision future but something present happening in the midst on planet earth so the second verse says can i saw and behold a white horse white we usually assume is something good but now we realize through prophecy it can be something bad yeah and he that sat on him had a bow and a prophet said did you notice no arrows no arrows so when this can tie in this anti-christ ride the bold was israel the orthodox church that followed the law of moses that had the many books of torah she had no arrows she could put no one to death as her religion took glory in and a crown was given unto him the crown was pagan rome and that day when the orthodox church of israel united with the pagan crown of warm they went together conquering and conquer and the denominate and the greatest denomination of that date now was able to fulfill its dastardly deed and put to death jesus of nazareth they had no boat to do it they had no power rome had took them all powerful it was against roman law for anyone to be put to death unless they did it so the church of that day the denomination united with the state power and put to death jesus of nazareth the bow and the crown now together they went where conquering and to conquer make no mistake sometimes we thought because it had no arrows that it wasn't doing anything wrong no one's getting hurt folks but church history tells us that the disciples of christ in that day were persecuted unto death church history tells us the 12 apostles all but one died martyrs church history tells us they were the disciples of christ were persecuted they scattered the world over escaping persecution and death and took the gospel with them everywhere they went but when the bow and the crown came together then they went conquering and to conquer and it's repeating again amen once again amen let's bow our heads heavenly father the book is yours you're the author you're the writer and you've written in your word both the parables the visions lord and you've given us the understanding and we pray this morning that you would open the eyes and hearts lord to see your word to see you working in this day that you're in control of all things we thank you now in jesus name amen you may be seated in romans chapter 1 verse 14 and and 15. the apostle paul is speaking here and he says in this chapter and in these verses romans 1 14 and 15 he says i am adapter both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and the unwise so as much as is in me i am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are here in minneapolis this is the parable and as parables go what sounds very literal is always hiding a a deeper meaning for instance the parable of the sower found in matthew 13 i'm sure you've all read it many times and verse 33 it says another parable spoke unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the hole was leavened verse 34 says all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them and it wasn't just in this instance that he was doing this it was it was prophesied it would be the style of the ministry of the son of man at the first coming of christ verse 35 says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the prophet which was isaiah saying i'll open my mouth in parables and i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world what was he bringing this jesus christ to us he was bringing to us a plan of redemption both redemption of the fig tree and a plan of redemption for the bride tree but how would he say it in parables and without a parable he wouldn't speak it sid and the reason for it was that it might be fulfilled that thus saith the lord would be fulfilled i'll open my mouth in parables all other things has been kept secret from the foundation of the world this ministry of jesus christ i'll come and tell you things that only the years of adam have ever heard because i'm back for redemption because i'm back for you yes what about the great commission to the church was it a parable or was it just a literal statement thus saith the lord it's another parable the risen lord jesus said this in matthew 28 beginning at verse 18. and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen but acts 2 is the revelation of this parable acts 2 adds more detail to the parable the great commission becomes more clear another word we use for that clarity is revelation acts 2 and verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost one is the parable the other is the revelation of that parable god hid it in simplicity okay god god hid it in simplicity then revealed it unto babes such as would learn and this style of ministry birthed a new testament church this style of ministry taught men and women to walk by faith and not by sight and now to the ministers i say this morning your adapter both to the wise and to the and i say what house will we build them gentlemen and to the laity i ask the foolish virgin is she your friend or cheerful now the parable turn with me to matthew 25 and verse 1 and it reads like this then shall the kingdom of heaven he likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom they were all the same there was ten they were all virgins there was ten they all took their lamps there was ten and they all went forth for the same purpose to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish now they had a detail of the distinction between them they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their lamps and and while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept now the ten virgins are not the church of laodicea but believers of all denominations and man-made systems that make up the bride of christ the woman of revelations 12 and the remnant of the woman's seed both wise and foolish verse 5 it can be taken literally but remember it's a parable we could use it this morning and and and wait till someone's falling asleep and say there you are there's revel there's matthew 20 five and verse five you're slumbering and sleeping and it might be a way for some evangelists to get your attention maybe but there's a deeper meaning way deeper than just a tired lay member no but it was saints through the ages in a cycle of life being born living and dying from the time of ephesus all the way to laodicea the message of the 10 virgins and the 144 000 prophet says this all the way down through both all died wise and unwise wise and foolish slumbered and slipped see as they went down through now they're not lost but they're just slumbered and slipped in another dimension waiting they didn't they didn't they didn't say they was dead but they're slumbering and sleeping from ephesus to smyrna to bergamos to thy to sardis to philadelphia to laodicea but in matthew 25 and verse 6 it says and at the midnight there was a cry made the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him one cry of the lord himself with three manifestations each one designed to take us closer to take us higher to take us deeper to take us nearer to him it's the voice it's the shout it's the voice of the archangel it's a trump of god another parable that paul spoke adding more detail to the one that jesus said all connecting together all dovetailing so we can see this great picture a picture of redemption a picture of restoration for the fig tree and for the bride-three paul said in first thessalonians 4 and 16 for the lord himself shall defend descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel with a trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first part of this parable of the ten virgins another detail added to the end of the eleventh hour at the midnight cry one cry but three manifestations of the lord himself crying out matthew 20 verse 1 to 16 is of course the 11th hour parable of seven church ages it's the calling and choosing to the mystical body of jesus christ and the rewards the same to all seven measures of this body of christ it's eternal life in this parable of this eleventh hour it says in verse 3 of matthew 20 and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace remember what he likened to unto a man that's a householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers to his vineyard and when he had agreed from the labors for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard the sixth verse says and about the fourth verse and and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went on their way and again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle four times he went out throughout seven church ages together went out as the lion went out as an ox a beast of sacrifice went out as the man went out as the ego four times four stages through seven church ages offering his children eternal life the same reward from the first to the last verse 7 of matthew 25 it says then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps they were so alike in so many ways they were all virgins they all had vessels they all were going out with the same purpose of mind to meet the bridegroom then all close virgins arose trimmed their lamps that means they went to prepare the lamp to light the wick to put the fire to the lamp it was time to light it it was time for the fire of god to be in the house of god to be in his temple you and i and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out remember at the beginning verse three it said they had they took no oil no oil none and the foolish and twice give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out now the lamp had a vessel where the oil was but the top of the lamp was where the wick was and the foolish tendon to wise give us of your oil for every time we try to let light our wick and it begins to burn because we have no oil then the fire of god doesn't stay with us in our testimony in our christian walk but they wanted it but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bride room came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins the foolish saying lord open to us this is when they truly became foolish when the wise were taken when the wise were quick and changed and translated by the power of the holy ghost when a rapturing faith caught them up in the air then they found that they'd been foolish afterward came also the other virgin saying lord open to us but he answered can said verily i say unto you i know you not i know you not and yet did he know them yes he knew them there was a time if you think back in your memory of a man called saul and a prophet called samuel and samuel had to face that man who had been ordained of god to be king of israel and tell him salt how be it that you have become an enemy of god i first read that as a young boy and i said yep he got what he deserved enemy he's probably frying in hell right this moment got what he deserved i thought did he not kill the priest of god have him executed that i said is a real enemy of god but one day i heard a prophet speak and i had to hear it two or three times and he said when saul went to the witch of endor and had samuel summoned up and samuel tell saul saul you're going to die in battle at this time tomorrow you'll be with me in paradise and a prophet with eagle vision he said did you notice he wasn't lost he was saved that man the enemy of god had been saved oh so don't read this bible like a newspaper don't read it like data on your computer sheet oh it takes revelation amen and revelation is free amen like everything else god offers you there is a price but it's not the money in your pocket but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh and they did not for it was the very son of man that was speaking to them these parables it was the very son of man whose presence they stood it was the very son of man that john put his head on his bosom and didn't quite understand who he was in this parable it was he the son of man speaking to them already come and they knew it not for he had hid himself in simplicity but revealing himself to his children to his disciples this son of man ministries effective right up to the rapturing of the wise virgins the bride of jesus christ and all the way to the gathering of a hundred and forty four thousand and the remnant of the woman's seed the foolish virgin you say where does it say that in the bible i'm glad you asked that question matthew 24 then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven then should all then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn israel and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven angels with power and great glory if the cloud of heavens was angels in our day then these clouds will be angels again amen at the end where was the son of man ministry in the voice of many waters go to them that sell and buy the fifo ministry and many helps in the church how shall we buy isaiah 55-1 o everyone that thirsts come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money in what without price how can you buy without money in christ the price for what he's offering you has already been paid but the price you must pay must be repentance sincerity humility dedication wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread he means iphone 12 that's what he's talking about there and your labor for that which satisfy if not another app on the phone that you got to pay for hearken diligently unto me and ye that which is good and let your soul delight in fatness incline your ear come unto me and hear your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david amen another parable that will add details to this 11th hour as it blends into the midnight crime luke 17 and verse 34 and he reads like this i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed one shall be taken the other left now in this day and age when you hear two men in one bed you go oh this is the parable amen written 2 000 years ago to give us insight to a plan of redemption today this morning for you and i what is it and i tell you from that night there shall be two men same gender means they're both the same two men in one bed and though they the same gender and they are the same in the detail the bible gives you yet one shall be taken and the other left why because one was wise and one was foolish though they were the same how were they the same they were believers the ten virgins how were they the same they were believers i tell you two women shall be grinded together they're the same same gender one shall be taken and the other left two women the same gender doing the same things on earth yet one was taken and one was left what was the difference between these two that were the same believers one had the oil one didn't two men shall be in the field once again same gender found in the same place found doing the same things and yet one would be taken and the other left when god descends to rapture a bride he's only coming looking for believers but amongst those believers if you're gonna make it out of this world and be translated and change you've got to have this oil [Music] and yet the foolish virgin you know you couldn't put a finger on their lives the foolish virgin you can't put a finger on their lives in the message the sudden secret going away of the church paragraph 35 you thought it was just my opinion and it is what i believe but he said it too god's a prophet how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins some were wise some were foolish virgin means purity they were all good people every one of them virgin sanctified vessels of god but those who had the oil on their lamps went in and the others was left out they were all virgins every one of every one people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong they everyone believed in the coming of the lord they were ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out don't let that be your case keep oil in your lamp oil is the spirit the holy spirit never let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to christ the cause quickly go to him who has the fountain of oil and buy for yourself a feeling of the holy spirit our nation is gone morally corrupted and ruined our politics are corrupted and gone our leaders oh god what could we do about it you can put a good man in and he comes out a crook there's only one we can bring now that's the lord jesus let's make ready for his coming the foolish virgin they are sheep and they are saved but you said they they missed the rapture attaching away they did but they are sheep and they are saved my opinion but now backed up by a man called william branham the patmos vision 1960 paragraph 25. brother branham are the foolish virgins of matthew 25 counted as the gentile remnant i understand that the foolish virgins were saved but have to go through the great tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could they be the sheep which are divided from the goats in matthew 25 33-34 a prophet says pretty good theologian according to what i i think too that they are the remnant the sleeping virgin is the remnant spoke of in revelations of the woman's seed that keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ you bible readers know that's revelations 12. he says a woman will take a piece of goods lay it down what is what is that what she's cutting her or takes her pattern lays anywhere she desires which way she's going to cut that and then what she has left over is called the remnant but she chooses to cut it from a certain place by her own free thinking but what's left over is called that remnant now if you'll notice there was five foolish and five wise virgins all of them were virgins made out of the same material but by election god chose his bride by election before the foundation of the world put their names on the lamb's book of life slain before the foundational world before the world ever began god in his mind being infinite yes now you could say i'm i'm doing some math in my head brother and there's only three kinds of believers and the way you're talking i'm my math says you're making it four kinds now there are three kinds of believers only only but in this saved church there's two classes of people amen once again i like to say that's my opinion but i also want to say backed up by a friend of mine called william miriam branham may i read it the 10 virgins and the 144 000 paragraph 55 now this remnant was the sleeping virgin that he spurted the water from his mouth to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed what is a remnant you have to get these types together now there is a church which is church natural maybe i can draw it here and make it a little bit plainer so he's got a board behind him a chalkboard and he's going to start riding on it maybe i can draw it here make it a little plainer now brother neville if i take up some of your time you please forgive me brother neville says i don't have any i don't have any brother he said he don't have none to this morning give it all to me so listen close now now there is now remember that there is what the unbeliever he draws a circle on the board and he says and i'll put you b right there unbeliever and that's the sinner then there's another one which is a formal he draws another circle and i'll put fo formal church later he called it unbe the make believer and then there's another one which is the saved church he draws a third circle puts s a the saved church now keep them in mind all the time three kinds of believers he says now in this saved church there's two classes two classes of people in the same church in this church right here right here which was which was typed by christ one of them was a sleeping virgin and the other one had oil in the lamp how many remembers the story we're gonna get to it in just a minute the foolish virgin he places her in the believer's circle the believer of what of the same thing that the raptured church was believing amen it's got to be the message got to be the reveal word gotta be what god brought to us in this day got to be those from an open book glory [Music] so we're coming down to we're seeing this foolish virgin she's a good woman she's a good woman because i say so i'd like to say yes because i say so but i also have to tell you because william branham said so the seventh seal 1963 paragraph 2 25. now when he called them over there the 144 000 they were missing that's right they're not in even numbered in there and joseph and levi is put in place of dan and ephraim now you can look at there right there it is before you see and here's god's promise way back there hundreds and hundreds of years before that brother branham speaking of how this change was going to take place now what happened they were purged during the time of the awful tribulation period if god's going to purge that that virgin that was a good woman but she just failed to get oil in her lamp and he's going to perjure through persecution in there he put some tribes right in there for the same time purges them during the time of the tribulation period because it's a purging it's a judgment and look here here comes up 144 thousand after the purging of israel here comes also the sleeping virgin comes up purge and has white robes on how perfect how beautiful that is all under that sixth seal amen and the sixth seal is not only a time of tribulation the sixth seal is also a time of redemption for a hundred and forty four thousand and the foolish virgin and the six seal of prophet said is a long seal many things happening there too many to share this morning or i'll get off my subject as i've done several times already now the foolish virgin does not take the mark of the beast neither does she suffer torment in hell the fifth dimension of prison house for those who've rejected christ but instead she's on the paradise side of the fifth dimension awaiting a white throne judgment where she's a virgin where she's an eagle where she's the sheep in the parable matthew 25 31 says when the skin of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divide as his sheep from the goats what is it it's the white throne where in the second resurrection every man that was ever born and died will rise up unto this judgment place here the king with his queen the bride of christ judging the nations from this tribunal from this judgment hall it's either eternal life or a lake of fire the human race has been in prison long enough it's judgment time it's time to execute judgment because the kingdom of clardon is christ is coming in amen and when the man of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered to all nations and he shall separate them one from the other as a shepherd divide as his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left for judgment begins first in the house of god amen then shall the king say unto them on his right hand there they are they're brought forth out of paradise the sheep they're brought forth out of that fifth dimension on the paradise side they're sitting in this courtroom in this tribunal with millions and billions of people and they're the first that the judge says looks at him and says you stand to your feet i'm going to read to you what you did on earth your works what you are guilty of i'm going to say it openly for all the billions in this courtroom to hear and he first goes to the sheep the foolish virgin then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come stand up for the reading amen of what you did on earth of what you are guilty of and he said ye blessed of my father amen inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world no doubt some of them sitting there as they stood when he said come maybe a couple of them fainted they dropped on the ground when he said it they still didn't understand the ramifications of what he was saying he said for i wasn't hungry and you gave me meat i was a thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i look at you eyeball to eyeball and you me and i judge you thus for i don't know the intents of your heart but this judge unlike all the judges on the earth the best of judges on planet earth they don't know the heart's intent you might have done a good thing but with the wrong motive we don't know that as men on this earth but god knows if you did something good with the bad motive he knows about everything [Applause] on this day of judgment we can't hide and he says naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison you came to me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord because he started with laodicea lord when saw thee we unhungered and fed i think i was born like 2500 years after you were i don't remember this when saw within hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the in or naked and clothing or when saw with these sick or imprisoned and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you and as much as you've done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me amen the foolish virgin at the white throne judgment justified by faith sanctified by the spirit but no oil and look what they were doing on planet earth in the sincerity of their hearts the foolish virgin who is she virgin or virgin believer or unbeliever believer eagle or crow eagle sheep or goat sheep remnant of the woman's seed or serpent seed remnant of the woman's seat friend or foe this morning she's your friend i assure you let me read you once again her deeds although she misses rapturing faith in a supernatural body change at the white throne judgment the sheep of god are exonerated of all sin for their godly deeds you know that on planet earth they were doing the right thing for the right reasons god said so verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king who looked down from heaven above who watched everything they said who knew the very intents of their hearts then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was in hunger and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when shall we clear a stranger and took the inn or naked and clothing or when saw with these sick were imprisoned and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them barely i say unto me you in as much as you have done to one of the least of my brethren you have done it on to me what a lady what a woman she busied herself on planet earth in the churches and the assemblies that she was in doing all these things for the brethren for the children for the sisters for those in prison for those without food for those that were naked my what a woman she was and she was who the foolish the foolish did this thus saith the lord the foolish lived this way what were the wise doing i know what the y's for doing but i don't know if i have time to tell you you may have to wait another year would you like to know the wise were doing exactly the same thing the wise and the foolish on planet earth are indistinguishable they're believers they're virgin they're eagles one difference that only god can see one had the oil and one didn't but they had begun in this process in this plan of salvation in these three steps of grace both were justified by faith genuine experience both were sanctified by the spirit genuine experience but one of them had received the baptism of the holy ghost which which called them culminated the born again experienced for them and begin them in a journey called the adoption of sons and daughters of god amen and the baptism of the holy ghost is just the earnest of this adoption what follows is more oil in the vessel and that's called the refilling of the spirit a prophet told us one holy ghost baptism many refillings throughout your christian walk it's the way of adoption what is the baptism of the holy ghost it's a friendship restored with a father like adam head [Music] it's a friendship restored with the father like adam had preachers and sometimes those who think they are have used this parable to try to discern who is foolish and who is wise they think because they're preachers they have a license to do so that's right let me tell you this they've wasted their time and they've wasted the time of their people and congregations and completely missed the reason for the parable for the parable is indeed to provoke a very personal question that you must ask yourselves or allow me to ask or let's let my friend ask you the apostle paul a brother once asked me have you ever been to jerusalem he had just come back i said yes he said really how often you've been there a thousand times and i'm actually going back tonight so i know jerusalem well and i've learned i know paul well well he's a friend my friend like you are my friends he's a friend acts 19 and one and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believe and he said unto them and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost like this morning you might say i didn't even know the foolish virgin were in the message because they're called foolish but the definition of foolish as the bible speaks to them you cannot find it in a dictionary whether it's spanish or english or french to the spanish brethren i tell them dictionaries and he said unto them what then were you baptized they said unto john's baptism paul said john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him that is on christ jesus you see they were followers of john they had been baptized unto repentance but they still didn't realize they hadn't yet heard the message preach what the holy ghost is for they hadn't come across that tape but they came across one of the tape boys paul and he said unto them john verily baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that's what the forerunner said then that's what the forerunner said in our day that they should believe on him which would come after him that is jesus christ not a return ministry of the same man but the one who's riding this trail again is the son of man jesus christ in our hearts that they should believe on him that should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized not in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost now they had a revelation now they knew who the man was and they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ who is the father the son and the holy ghost but one was the parable now we have a revelation now we [Applause] and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. just 12. so god took the messenger to an age god took a man a prophet and more than a prophet and instead of going to some big meeting at corinth with the policy he said i have need to go by samaria because sometimes it's not even 12. sometimes it's one little lady lost in sin without hope but inside her heart is a germ seed word of god an attribute that was in god before the foundation of the world you were in his mind while he was on that cross and you're on his heart this morning amen acts 2 and verse 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god had made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ because you were the bow he told ezra with no arrows seeking a way to crucify him then you joined yourself to the crown of rome and together you went conquering and to conquer and yet every bit in the plan of god not out of control everything working exactly according to god's word for redemption for you for restoration amen therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto peter to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if there's someone here this morning who has yet to give their life to jesus who hasn't been baptized in that precious name i say let not your heart be hardened as it was in the day of the provocation but today this morning move out of the foolish realm and walk into the wise and repent and be baptized in jesus name why brother daniel because then he is obligated to give you the holy ghost he'll pour oil in your land he'll give you victory in your christian life he'll give you overcoming power over the lust of the flesh and the lust of the heart and the pride of life so the purpose of this parable is have i received the holy ghost since i believed and how long has it been since i've received the refilling of the blessed holy spirit this morning you could ask yourself is there foolish amongst us wise and foolish prophetically speaking yes in reality god has given us you this morning a space of time for they were truly foolish when a rapture took place but until a rapture takes place if you need a refilling it's available this morning and if you need the holy ghost it's available this morning i want to believe with our brother brought tape that there isn't three kinds of believers within the reach of my voice but there's just two classes of people this morning you received the baptism of the holy ghost maybe many years ago for me it was october the 8th 1974. but this morning i need a refilling of that same baptism what mature believer who's had that experience could just slip up their hand and say refilling lord jesus amen refilling lord jesus now what if you've never received it and you know you need that holy ghost experience would there be someone say brother daniel i don't have it i've not received it i won't ask you to slip up your hand i'll ask you to close your eyes say lord jesus i need the baptism of the holy ghost this morning and i want it and it's easy to ask for because he promised it first corinthians chapter 1 and verse 23 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumbling block unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because to receive him this morning are we feeling for the baptism for the first time is the wisdom of god for you because the foolish foolishness of god is wiser than men even the foolish virgin is wiser than the men of this world and the weakness of god is stronger than men even in their weakness as the foolish they were stronger but you don't have to stay that way this morning there's a fountain in the house of david i'm telling you come drink buy without money without price give your life a willing testimony a sacrifice for he gave his life a sacrifice for you in romans chapter one beginning at verse three concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead paul said i am adapter both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so that old time pastoral saying brother blond when a tired old pastor puts his hands in his hips they get to be about 64 years old and they say i sure need some low maintenance sheep it's funny but it ain't right no we are called to be depthers both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me is i'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are here in minneapolis also amen for i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that could believe this morning for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost what is that baptism of the holy ghost it's a friendship restored with a father as adam had in eden and was in a character development process when they fail you know from where adam fell from way up here great was the fall of that son yes and yet he was not lost though he might have become an enemy of god and god watched him walk out of eden and bloody lambskins from the minute he walked out of his presence god went to work to restore back adam's seed then comes after this baptism of holy ghost and fire then comes to the believer the greatest mind battles you have ever had but you're not alone for now you've got a friend in jesus you've got the author and finisher of your faith and every victory he gives you is a refilling of your vessel a refreshin thank you jesus psalms 23 as the musicians come this morning i'm putting my son jordan to ease he said dad i want you to remember that the batteries in your microphone only last 12 hours i said jordan do you have two of them so now he knows i've called the musicians psalms 23 a psalm of david lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures that's justified he leaves me beside the still waters that's sanctified he restored my soul that's born again he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake your adoption has begun yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil that's the greatest battles you'll ever fight [Music] for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that means you've got a friend in jesus folks now prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies that's the end time message once again in parables and thou anointest my head with oil my cup runeth over that's the parable revealed to our hearts [Music] surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever this is the house god wants you to have [Music] but saints of god what house will you build him [Music] he has said you are the temple of the holy ghost you are the house he wants to dwell in but what house will you build what house will i build him i say this morning together let's build him a house that he'll be pleased to dwell in [Music] in closing i'll read your poem as we all stand to our feet sitting down studying many years ago feeling like i'm hitting a brick wall brother feeling like i just can't get through feeling like there's no inspiration feeling tired feeling weak [Music] you close your bible you put your pencil down you you take the last paper you had and you you crunch it up you look for the wastebasket and just then the holy spirit drops down and he tells me pick up your pen and now right and this is what he told me sunrise the sun said i will seek your face knowing the victory that awaits me when i make you first place fasting and prayer is where i'll wait for you in my prayer closet for your promises come true it's not a busy place where the multitudes abide it's the secret of your pavilion where bride and groom reside i know it's the best way and yet i try it last it was my testimony i know it's the best way and yet i try it last only to be defeated by satan's ugly blast i dedicate myself again to the prayer closet with my friend who listens so attentively to every word i say but when i listen quietly to every word he speaks it gives me all the strength i need to hear him say you're free free from the sickness free from the pain free from the lust free from the shame of past life and years freedom freedom freedom free at last folks in my little prayer closet when i close the door at last as we bow our heads and close our eyes lord jesus this morning i believe with all my heart that to this house of god through this year of 2021 you are bringing freedom you are casting down all fear and you're wanting to replace it with the love of god in their hearts that they might live this clear a year of victory not moved by the things of this world not caught away in the pleasures not made sad by the bad news they hear because they've received the good news of the gospel of which we are not ashamed we ask lord that you would quicken to every heart that you give refillings to those who desire that you would baptize with the holy ghost those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness may there no one leave this building the way they came in but may everyone leave with another measure of oil in their vessels their lie their lambs trimmed and the fire of god burning in their hearts and we'll be sure lord to give you all the honor all the glory and all the praise in that beautiful name of jesus we thank you god bless you church shalom until we meet again [Music] oh my soul yes my cup filled it up and make me let's sing that one more time fill my cup up [Music] yes my build it up and make me the lord bless you you may have your seat for a while friendship with jesus let your saying friendship with jesus fellowship divine we want to just thank the lord for the message amen are you grateful this afternoon that god can speak to you like this of his choice let me say this to you uh uh i was just talking to a brother yesterday and we were fellowshipping and i told him i say among all [Music] the relationship you can have on earth there are stages but yet friendship is the middle relationship you look through the scripture god related to israel our sevens through the old testament they came to the new testament [Music] he says now i call you friends you no longer my seven i call you french and before he resurrected he said you are my brethrens so friendship was right between seven and and and brotherhood it's very important before you get married you have to have a good friendship praise the lord i can never be so successful to you as a pastor if i don't have a good friendship sometimes even in parenting you need to have friendship with your children it's a relationship that you have to you don't look to the next person you have to tell yourself because solomon said he that won't frame must be friendly so you don't tell the other person you got to be friendly you have to put the work in to be friendly it's a very very important relationship and that god will come down to be our friend what a blessing what a blessing as we go into the new year and with the message that was preached to us this morning what house will you build me i just want to encourage you to say our attitude matters [Music] and no matter what attitude you have it shows how much you appreciate [Music] what you have as the message of the hour your attitude to god show how much you appreciate him your attitude to others show how much you appreciate our attitude is very important just like but then you preach we have class people we have condemned people all because of our attitude or because we think we are better than them but when we begin to start learning to appreciate god and what he has done for us it will change your attitude it will change your attitude praise the lord and that's the reason why you realize i say this over and over sometimes you work with people when they really get on the edge and you're angry you know this is well you know i don't care for anybody i just said my god you know and people just take that kind of attitude because they want to be so self-centered you know it's maybe just they feel so lonely on an island and and they think that you know that it shouldn't have any time for for anybody but as as i listened to the message this morning you know just appreciate and and just like we said internal life brother branham said is living for others it's what we do for others that's what matters to god [Music] what we do for others [Music] as we you know think about all of this [Music] and uh the invitation was given for those that uh need the holy ghost [Music] it's an experience praise the lord it's not what is not just what we think it is it's not a talk it's not an idea it's an experience [Music] it's a birth [Music] it's a life [Music]
