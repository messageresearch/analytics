he sent greetings to the church and uh Pastor Martins was traveling back uh today he also called to appreciate his time of visit and he send greetings praise the Lord let's turn to Luke chapter 10 tonight Luke chapter 10 tonight Luke chapter 10 tonight I want to find a way to get back to what I was sharing with you on Sunday but uh we have to pass this way we have to pass this way of Luke chapter 10 praise the Lord Luke chapter 10 let's read from verse 17 Luke chapter 10 we will read from verse 17 and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said Jesus said unto them I beheld Satan as a lightning fall from Heaven amen I be held saw him fall from Heaven behold I give you power to tread on Serpent and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice net don't Rejoice because you have power to over serpent power to cast out evil spirit power Jesus said I have given it to you but that is not it is not where your joy should be praise the Lord amen it's not where your joy should be where should our joy be then not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather re joice because your names are written in heaven amen let's pray together father Lord rejoicing is not what we can do father it is what Lord your word because your word brings gladness to our heart oh Father we pray tonight come bless this word Lord as we we take a little thought here to to be able to share tonight father we just ask that Lord you would come and bless us we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so uh we'll go in a kind of a a a reverse way because I I I will have started with this before we go went into the prayer meeting uh or a little time to pray and then we have come back to our subject but uh uh I want to I'm uh feeling okay I'm feeling a little bit tempted to to to get away from there okay let's uh let's just start here and uh and we will'll be able to find find our way through you on Sunday we were trying to talk about blessed at the feet that bringeth good tidings and we were we were we we were trying to identify uh uh uh the faith that have brought us this good Tiding we call the message of the hour and and the benefit of the message of the hour and we were looking at uh uh Revelation chapter 10 we were looking at uh the the the mighty Angel having his foot on the land and having his foot on the sea and then we took there to Revelation chapter 13 to be able to show us uh uh why uh the mighty angel had his foot on the land man in the seed because uh out of those both places there were a power that was rising in the earth which of course that is the power that is having the influence upon the world today whether you like it or not praise the Lord so we were trying to show that uh uh uh the mighty Angel uh has to come and stomp those power keep them under his feet and uh uh uh release a message to be able to get his people call his people out get them out of here just before uh uh uh that those BS uh you know uh spread their influence all over the word praise the Lord now so uh uh I want to get back to that but let me give you a little picture here let me give you a little picture so you'll be able to see what what what I want to get to tonight in Luke chapter 10 that we have just read and uh uh Luke is giving an account of Jesus giving the commission to the disciples when Luke gave this account now you have to realize that this is the in the the infancy the beginning the birth of the church the beginning our lord Jesus with his disciples and uh and they they they are beginning to to benefit from his ministry he sending out they have gone out and they are they are casting out uh uh evil spirits and uh and and I mean they all came back and they are all excited yeah very excited and uh uh and Jesus is looking at these brothers and he's telling them I beheld Satan you know they are giving testimony how evil spirits you know are subject unto them and Jesus is telling them i' I have beheld you know you you look there in uh uh Isaiah chapter 14 the Bible says oh how are thou Fallen Lucifer so even from the the the the infancy from the beginning of the church from the going forth of our Lord Jesus ministry even the power of Satan start started to fall praise the Lord amen amen even from the going forth of his ministry the power of Satan begin to fall but that's not where we want to get to tonight Jesus Is Telling these disciples and he's saying to them I beheld Satan falling like a lightning he says uh uh uh but what I want to say to you is that don't Rejoice because you know uh uh those Spirits are subject unto you he said behold I have given you power to tread over uh uh serpents and scorpions and and over all the powers of the enemy praise the Lord amen he has given us power over all the powers of the enemy praise the Lord amen and he says nothing shall by any means hurt you if we can just believe that if we can just trust the Lord and uh to know that uh he has given us power over every Power of the E of the enemy every evil evil power every spiritual power every physical power you know he has given us power over he says nothing by any means will hurts you now we're standing in this Rejoice net praise the Lord you know we we uh uh we uh uh in such a time where the uh the the the religious word the church word uh and and is uh desire for power you know we we want to see manifestation you know there that's one of the place that we want for us to go tonight we uh the the church long to see manifestation and and because of the longing for manifestation we have a bunch of uh uh uh um counterfeit we have a bunch of impersonation we have uh a whole whole lot of things that is going on around the church world because people are yearning for power people want to demonstrate the power of God but yet Jesus is telling his disciple and he says uh uh I mean that that is not what you should rejoice in you know uh uh that the spirits are subject to you demons are subject to you that is not what you should rejoice in you know what I want you to rejoice in is that uh your names are written in heaven amen that your names are written in heaven now look at this you think about this now Jesus was saying this he was saying this and uh uh uh even John the the the Beloved he was sitting right among the disciples he was sitting there in Jesus was saying this and you see it's one of these places where sometimes things are said and they just go over our head praise the Lord amen because you see what the way the church will look at it is that they think they will get to heaven before they see their names in the book they are waiting to go to heaven before you know uh uh a book will be open and they will see their name in the book but we we we realize that uh uh uh no this is is it is not so the the the the seals have been taken off the book praise the Lord and when the mysteries in the book are released when the mystery in the book are uh have been called out we hear our names praise the Lord amen so we see here that John is sitting there and uh and Jesus is saying Rejoice n because uh you know uh uh you are casting our spirit so I mean to to them it looking like this is where the excitement is you know to be able to go down there and see someone uh that is sick you pray for them and they are healed somebody that is possessed with evil spirit you pray for them and they are delivered that's where the excitement is it's it's a exting to be able to see that but Jesus is saying no where I want for you to look is uh that your names are in the book that your names are written in the book The Book of the Lamb are we together and John is sitting there John that was on the island of pmos is sitting right in that meeting but when Jesus said that he never grabed it he never got aside it and never grabed his attention because he's looking at something else they are looking at what is happening there the healing of the sick and and the casting out of evil spirit but then after some years John will now find himself on the island of pmos and then he will now be in this Vision where the Lord Jesus Christ would now be revealing to him the things that he's doing in the church and John will find himself right there in in Revelation chapter 5 when the lamb takes the book and the lamb is uh is is uh uh uh uh taking the seals of the book praise the Lord first when the Bible says that no man was wed to take the book and even to look upon it John the scripture said he be to weep praise the Lord amen he started weeping because there was no man wanted to take the book but when he heard the proclamation thatth the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed and he will take the book praise the Lord and loose the seals from off the book and when John looked he saw the lamb and the lamb took the book a bleeding lamb but the Bible says the very same John that was weeping when the lamb took the book praise the Lord and loose the seals of the book The Bible said John said he shouted he rejoiced that all Heaven heard him and all Earth held him but long ago Jesus told him to Rejoice because his name was in the book but it went over his head praise the Lord amen even though he heard it but he couldn't get the excitement to Rejoice because he heard it but he but he at the time he have not seen his name in the book but on the Allen Theos when the lamb took the book and starts to take up the seals from off the book then John saw his name the reality of what Jesus told them in in Matthew chapter 17 struck him this is what he said we should not rejoice in this is the actual thing praise the Lord so see the reverse of the church praise the Lord amen we will talk about the the mighty angel coming down we would talk about God send a message God sent a messenger the people would just stare at you and look at you in your face this is the message of the hour but what will make the Church get excited when you see a manifestation praise the Lord the very thing that Jesus told us not to rejoice in that's why we rejoice in the one he told us to rejoice in we are still skeptical we are sitting back praise the Lord amen amen we are still sitting back you and myself under the message of the hour we are looking right into the book the very same book that John looked in and he saw his name praise the lord we are looking right in that book as we said H the message of the hour but you will see as the church travel there something I want to bring to you tonight and I pray that uh that the Lord will will uh will be able to help us tonight and uh let's read this testimony in uh just once more Lord I'm trying to get away from it but I still feel the need that we should read it so let's just read it tonight and uh uh you will bear with me this this ginine uh we will we try to to read it tonight but bham is giv a testimony in year of uh of a of a family and this family uh if you if you see the book uh uh a prophet visit South Africa it is actually the brother that read that uh that uh that print that book he was in the military and uh uh I think either he was serving in Germany at the time or he was from Germany and uh because when brother brandham was to go to Germany uh you hear on tape how brother brandham says that uh you know he had to go and speak to his Superior officer to get brother Brandon in at the time but he's the one that wrote the book The Prophet visit South Africa so brother Brandon will come in here he was preaching this message in strapo uh Louisiana he says I guess brother Julius has been introduced the man who wrote the book a prophet visit South Africa and he he he called his wife name sister uh uh stealing no doubt is here somewhere I can't place her just right he said yes now I do he see where she's sitting he says uh I remember a few years ago Minneapolis they were uh little bitty fellow now I have to look up to them they are a great big boys and girl and then he you know he talks about the sister and uh uh just just follow me a little bit here he says uh our sister year long ago that's really how that's that that really had my heart willing around a little mother she lost her baby she lost her baby and the Lord seemed fi to take it away and she did call me and wanted they were going to fly me over to Germany the doctor was so kind to wait and let the baby live there the little fellow died suddenly uh sweet little uh plumpy bab girl the uh our sister had lost her mother and she and and and she was uh pretty well broken up this baby certainly had got the best of her now she lost her mom so here say she's expecting to have a baby guil and and know the the baby is born little baby and so it was almost like a comfort to her but yet yet the baby is sick and the baby has died so brother Bram as he goes on here that's that's somewh I want to bring you with this tonight and uh as he talks about this uh this mother the baby certainly had got the best of her and she got on the phone long distance from Germany and wanted to fly over and uh uh she confessed her faith that she believed that the Lord Jesus has sent me for the work in the last day and just a loyal testimony that no one could give and she meant it with all her heart she uh she seen the Lord God do such things as that rais up the dead after they were dead but you see you really he says how what what what a glory that would have been to God in Germany in in everything if I could have done it myself I will have done it but the first thing we must we mustn't go until we know what we are going for so I went out and I prayed and uh I think she stayed on the phone part of the time through the night yes the mother that have lost her baby and she uh believed this man to be a man of God with all the testimony around his ministry and uh uh uh the testimony about uh uh Florence naill and and all of that the boy in Finland and she begged the doctors to keep her baby laying there let me talk to my pastor or let me talk to that servant of God from the United States and they were ready to get brother brandham on a military flight and fly him over to Germany and all of that and brother brandham saying that uh uh uh I mean U uh she belied now what what I want to show you also is there are the this thing has already happened okay what we are reading have already happened they have come down over to the United States they are there in streeto they right in the meeting brother bham is preaching but yet he feel like to commend her for her faith praise the Lord are we together now so he says here uh um she was on the phone all through the night the next day I coming there was nothing again me that said my wife she said the sister called twice H any word from the Lord yet I said not not a think well uh I went out and prayed again I was in a w that night night then CA a little baby have been taken care of and and then just just as I was coming in the Lord Jesus in a vision struck standing in front of me and I heard his voice don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord so I knew then that God for some reason has taken the baby to Glory and it was certainly against his will for me to say anything contrary to death now you think about it now it has already happened they have they have they have buried a baby she's in the service and brother Bram is commenting her faith now there is two things that is playing out here faith and feelings praise the Lord amen she just lost her baby this is a mother maybe she will have named the baby after her mother her mother passed away the baby was some sense of comfort and she have asked ask the doctors keep the baby down there I believe God will give brother Brandon a word we will fly him over to to Gering he will pray for my baby the baby will wake up brother Braham said it will have been a witness to gine and everywhere else are we together amen but the Lord says don't rebuke that that's my hand so I knew then that uh for some reason the Lord had taken the baby to glory and it was certainly against his will the word of the Lord for for me to say anything contrary to it then I thought well that will be a big let down now the Lord have just spoken to him he's now supposed to take the phone and and call the sister praise the Lord amen it's amazing to listen to it it's another thing when you are wearing the shoes are we together he says that's a big let down but one thing I did I minded the Lord I did what he told me don't rebuke it praise the Lord he says I did what God told me to do and he had to some of the courage and tell the sister that's the hand of the Lord praise the Lord amen now think about that now like I said it has already happened now a mother like that in that situation will stay travel from Germany and come to a service to H H in a service of a preacher that you believe and H you were looking up to to save your baby after hearing what happened in the life of floring Nale and what happened in the life in the board there in Finland and and all of the the the other things that God has done through the ministry of brother Bram and now this is your turn praise the Lord but you see I think it was an honorable thing for brother Bram to do because he would just he will let us know now as we as we read down a little bit it was an honorable thing for him to do I mean he was he was appreciating the faith of the sister that you will be sitting in the meeting year tonight what a great faith but you can also think of uh the emotion that was going through her body what he was trying to do what what were brother Braham trying to do to raise her faith above her emotions amen now let's let's read on a little bit here I need to get into what I want to talk about I wanted to do this for the prayer meeting not long ago he says a letter from a minister a German Lutheran n show he said uh uh there's one thing that I can admire about brother Brandon when all the excitement was going on now yeah there was there was an excitement that was going on an expectation everybody was excited praise the Lord amen they were all looking for him to fly over when all the excitement was going on he said he still steady till he got a clearical decision from God then he know what he was doing and that's the only way you can do those things is uh first year from the Lord when he tells if he tells me tonight to go up there and raise out raise out of that Cemetery President Kennedy I will invite the whole world to come and wash it done for I have th said the Lord but how can I say thus said the Lord until the Lord has said thus now learn from this now he says many people get all excited and go on the impression and things like that and what the best of their Mentor can think because we are believing God it's God that we are calling upon God will not let us down yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a good reasoning are we together many people can get all excited and go on the in depression and things like that that's what the best of their Mentor can think that are always truth wait till he tells you and you know it then you have got exactly you don't have to guess about it he's done told you thus said the Lord then he told you and then you can go and say what he says until then you can go and do everything you can do what you can yourself but you can't be sure until God has said so then you are positive praise the Lord are we together I was I was listening to this couple of days and and it just it just uh uh I just stopped the tape and and then I started thinking about it you know Word of Faith you know we we we read about martyr and and Mary when Lazar was dead and brother Brandon was says how they sent for Jesus and uh he never came it was that time you see it's very easy to read those things but uh when we have to wear those shoes and we have to get into those places you know uh uh where you will trust the grace of God to raise your faith above your emotions that you can stay believe God you can still believe his word you can still believe the message of the hour when we are in such time of trouble praise the Lord amen and uh uh then brother bro says this also here in the message God uh uh provided way the devil is not a Healer he says Simon the Sorcerer was bewitching the people not healing the people it was Phillip that done the healing and CA a great Revival to sweep the city Philip by the name of Jesus Christ he cast out devil and caused a great joy and they were streaming and shouting and having a great time and still didn't have the Holy Ghost that Samra Revival the Revival in Samra they had to now send for Peter they were experiencing all of that great revival going on he was casting out Devils he was healing the S but he did not have the Holy Ghost until Peter comes now you see why Jesus told the disciple in the emphasis of the church that don't rejoice in these things it's those are things that brings excitement when we when we have manifestation and we we hear that God you know heal the siake and and I and I pray for this person and God it it it raises faith it causing excitement but he said this is what this is where I want your joy to be that you know not that someone tell you that you know and for you to know is for you to have a revelation that your name is in the book praise the Lord that your name is in the book oh we would we would thank God for the healing of the sick we would thank God for all the the the the manifestation of the word but the thing that Rejoice us is when the word is calling out our names amen it's when the word is revealing things to us are we together let me show you something again now see so Jesus says I will give you power now you you hear this thing is preached around the church you know we have the power and Jesus has giving the church the power this is a power that he says uh I will give you power over scorpions and over serpents and and uh uh uh uh and and and and over every evil power I will give you power praise the Lord and and because of the seek of power and the church want Power the church want to manifest uh uh uh uh uh the gift of Jesus Christ we see all the different things that is happening around the church but let me show you something t tonight why Jesus said you should Rejoice because your name is in the book now Revelation chapter 4 let's go there quickly Revelation chapter 4 Revelation 4:7 revelation 4:7 and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast was like a cough and Ox the third Beast was like the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle now we know that these are the four Beast the four anointing that is around the throne the four anointing that will also be on the uh uh the the the the the church age messenger there the the four anointing that is also on on the five four Ministry so these are the four anointing to gather church are we together amen now let's go to Revelation chapter 6 Revelation chap 6 verse 1 Revelation chap 6 verse1 the Bible says and I saw when the lamb open the seal now that was that was from Revelation chapter 5 uh the seal the book was sealed no man could could could read what was in it no man could touch it but yet Revelation 6 verse1 saying I saw when the lamb opened the seal and I heard as it was the noise of a thunder one of the four beasts one of the four beasts that we read about in Revelation chap chapter 4 one of the four beasts is saying to John come and see so let me let me let me give it a type here the book was sealed the lamb has break the seal of the book he has bro the Seal of the book and now he's calling to John and you we have to realize tonight that we are at type of John amen Jesus is saying Rejoice rejoice in the content of the book are we together amen we are a type of John John is a type of the Bride now the seven Angel is calling to John come and see the lamb has opened the book and the Seven Angel is telling John come and see so now the angel now is beginning to show John the content that is in the book why because it is those Divine mystery truth are we together amen amen I don't want to lose you tonight praise the Lord amen I don't want to lose you [Music] tonight but brother brandham says the messenger of Malachi 4 and revelation 10:7 we do two things are we together I call in to Revelation 7 he's going to reveal the Mysteries you're going to reveal the mystery of God Amen according to Malachi 4 he's supposed to turn our heart back to the faith of the fathers praise the Lord amen so brother brandom said it is those Divine mystery truth the the the the what what uh uh will be revealed by the the seven Angel is those Divine mystery truth that will turn our hearts back back praise the Lord amen that's what we turn it will literally turn our hearts back so when when we begin to see and understand the things that were in the sealed book that's the thing that would turn our heart back it is not us trying to to to to behave like the people on the days of Pentecost and say let's come together in want a c because we want to produce a Pentecostal church or we want to get that we we want the Holy Ghost to come just like it came on the day no no no no no no the thing that would turn our heart back to the faith of the fathers it's not even the working of Miracles and signs praise the Lord so you see Jesus says I will give you power now as he opened the book he opened the seals book and the angel is speaking to John and saying come and see now when these things are revealed to John when John see it that's what makes John an overcomer praise the Lord are we together are you are you grapping the picture amen that's the things that make John an overcomer is is is the revelation of the word is is the things that I that I reveal that were under the seals are we together let's go to Revelation chapter 10 I'm trying to Revelation chapter 10:7 that is that is one of our favorite uh verse that speaks of the ministrat of brother Brandon the ministry that we are honored I want for us to pay attention as we read that as we read there together amen if you read from Revelation chapter 1 I think we took I mean revelation 10:1 we took that uh before John have six conjunctions before he get to verse 7 if you read from Revelation chap 10 verse1 he have six conjunction and in the day of the voice of the seven angel oh let me let me know let me get there just keep Revelation chapter 10:7 up I'm coming that's what I want to read but I just I just want to do this from verse one he says and I saw another Mighty Angel and I saw that's uh that's one conjunction in verse two he said and he had his hands he he had in his hands a little book open verse three and he cried so he has Si conjunctions praise the Lord but when he gets to Revelation chapter he gets to verse 7 he has another conjunction but it's a conjunction that that is either creating an expectation or is creating a contast when he says but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel so it's creating an expect ation he's telling us about this Mighty Angel and and I saw another Mighty Angel and he had in his hands a little book and he cried with a loud voice verse four and when the seven tunel open verse 5 and the angel which I saw verse six and he sore he he has all of these conjunctions but when he get to verse seven he brings another conjunction that create an expectation but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished praise the Lord so when this Angel is sounding he's now sounding the mystery when he starts to sound the Mysteries are already finished praise the Lord amen now watch there now one thing I want for you for us to pay attention to when when when uh when this Angels shall begin to sound the mystery of God one mystery the mystery of God should be finished praise the Lord as he have declared to his servants the prophet now brother Brandon will explain to us in Christ is the mystery of God revealed that it was one mystery with a threefold purpose so in Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's that's that's where he actually explained what Revelation 10:7 is it's just one mystery but it have a three-fold purpose are we together amen okay now so uh uh uh uh there there are few things that he said in that in that light that I also want to bring to your attention here because uh uh you know I'm I'm I'm trying to to what what I'm trying to to do with this as we talk about blessed is the feat that brings us Good Tidings Yeah because sometimes you know uh uh uh uh uh people get excited with uh with uh you know uh um the car that deliver the post uh mail then the the content of the mail people get excited with the one that bring brings the message then the message itself and and and all of that but what what I'm trying to to to to help us uh to get to a little bit here is that uh uh um unless the the Lord help us to be able to see what that seven Angel brought to us when he told us come and see unless he help us to be able to understand what what are we seeing we would we would just be like any other Church you see that's the reason why you find a whole lot of people around the message that just settle for water baptism in Jesus name to them that's the message there are a lot of people around the message that just settle well I believe brother brand well you know I I I I I don't know what the 720 but I believe brother Bram is the messenger praise the Lord when the angel told John to come and see the angel was pointing to the book he was pointing to the thing that was under the seals you read Revelation chapter chapter 6 verse 2 and the second beast called unto John come and see and is seeing those things that gave the church the power that she should have in the last day seeing those things that are under the seals seeing our names in the lamb Book of Life praise the Lord because when you can hear when you can hear your name when you can hear the voice of God and you know that this voice is speaking to me praise the Lord because when someone for example when someone get out there and and and and they are talking to everybody you get interested in the message they are saying because you know they are talking to you praise the Lord amen we know definitely the names H the lamb is not calling our name you know brother ju and brother Steve and brother John it's not the names that he's calling he's he's he's is bringing forth his word and that word is identifying you as a Son of God that word is identifying you as a daughter of God it has quickened something in you that is giving you an interest to listen to the voice of God praise the Lord am you find people around the message all that you know the the they love the dress Cod they love the songs but yet they will be able to take all the opinion above the opinion from the word of God the opinion from the message of the hour praise the Lord are we together I hope you are getting the picture if you don't get it we have another time to get back to it I really wanted for you to see it getting close to my time here tonight listen to what brother brandom says here in the bridge I read few of them tonight he says at the sounding of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages have been pro at will be W up together now listen to this now and when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember the seven Angel is on Earth at the time of this coming Hallelujah okay let me give you a Biblical type John was at the River Jordan and he was telling the people behold the kingdom of God cometh unto you and he was rebuking the people and he was you know uh uh rebuking the soldiers uh he even rebuked Herod from uh uh uh sleeping with his brother's wife and and he was preaching but he told them he says there is one among you who shoes I'm now worthy to lose the lashes of his shoes praise the Lord amen now he was the Forerunner he was the messenger of that time but as he was bringing his message he was also identifying that the Messiah is here are we together he was also identifying that there is one among you whose shoes are now wanted to lose and then when Jesus will come down and John the first time he would see him there was an inner connection and then Jesus will come right down into the water you remember what happened there at J and he will say tell John is behold to fulfill all righteousness and John will baptize Jesus and as Jesus will go out of the river he will says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word praise the Lord are we together amen amen so brother brandham is trying to help us to see that a similar repetition is taking place in our day glory be to God because let let me let me let me get myself here trying to get excited but let me get myself together because you see we can we can look for messages to chase you about all the petty things you know uh you know don't do this you know you shouldn't stay home on Wednesday night you shouldn't I mean all of those things we can find a message and just wind you up and think we can preach these things together to you uh uh but the reality there is that what get a hold of us is what is in the book it's what the lamb has revealed because when John saw his name in The Lamb Book of Life no one could stop him he didn't care whether it was before the throne he didn't care whether there were Angel the Bible says he shouted he rejoiced that is the thing that St the thing for the for a Believer when a Believer knows that uh H H uh the voice of God has called out my name praise the Lord when a Believer gets that Revelation that I am a Son of God a daughter of God predestinated by God I was in the mind of God from the foundation of the word praise the Lord when a Believer get an understanding that I'm in a body that will never be converted this is a Croc of it will struggle it will struggle but down in mean there is a representation for God there is something that is longing more for God then you don't stumble at your flaws you have your Triumph but there is something in you that keep pushing you to serve God that's when you hearing your name from the book we can write all the all the rules of the church put it right on the board when you want to come to this church this is how long your dress should be this is it does not change it does not change what change the individual is when you hear your name amen praise the Lord Lazarus was a de body been there four days praise the Lord and he was in B in B never started now praise the Lord he was in B what changed him from a dead man back to a living man was not them washing his body and no what changed him was the voice of God when Jesus said Lazarus come forth that's what changed him praise the Lord this is a Wednesday night this is a Wednesday night are we together listen to what brother Braham said here in the Rapture message praise the Lord like I said on Sunday we're not making a church we're not making the church we are following the voice than amen that Mighty angel came down with one thought on the land and one foot on the seal on the sea and he had the book in his hands and your representation was in that book amen as he puts his foot on the land and on the seal when he begin to he he begin to reveal the Mysteries that is in the book he begin to call out the names the attributes that were in the book that's the thing that brings you praise the Lord and when that thing brings you all the father has given to me Jesus said will come praise the Lord so when that thing brings you what happened actually is that he he Deliver Us from uh uh the religious power of the Beast system and the power power of the Council of churches he Deliver Us from all the political system of the world the national system that the ESS system in all of those things because he put his foot on those things praise the Lord amen that's why Jesus says I give you power the power is in what he has already done over every enemy is not something that we have to work out nor we have to believe what he have already given to us are we together now let's read this and then we find a place to close here listen to this from the message the Rapture I triy I will try to go around this and see if uh I can be able to to really get it to you because if NAD will start preaching Pentecostal message to you you know Pentecostal message is all about dress code it's all about uh you know trying to make a holy people no it's the word that watches us it's the word that cleanses us is the word that dresses us am praise the Lord the Bible said he has made us priests and Kings unto our God and just like when God would set out the Leviticus priesthood it was a prophet Moses that he told call your brother Aaron and his sons so it's a prophet that called to the priesthood office you don't join it you have to come under the voice of a prophet you see that's the thing that Coran and dayon never understood they were all of the tribe of levite the Leviticus the Levites had a work to do but when it comes to the the the calling to the priesthood office God told Moses call Aaron and his sons so Moses will call them and then when they come there over in The Book of Leviticus the Bible says Moses will wash them before for the congregation praise the Lord so that Prophet word will do the watching that Prophet word will go and dress them for the priesthood office that Prophet word will anoint them for the priesthood office praise the Lord you see that's the reason why in in the present stage of my Ministry brother brandham says he says uh uh uh the crowning of my ministry will be what to dress the bride am okay let's read this then we close he says right here in the Rapture message he says in the seven in the seven Angel message why he was making his Proclamation his ministry and when he begin to sound forth his ministry not when he started out now he take a type here Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and they Afflicted and all great robber he he's he's a prophet and everybody wanted him in his church but when he sat down one thing and said I and my father are one that was different that was different that was different except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you why he's a vampire see that was different now brother brandham is giving us a type here Jesus in his ministry when he was healing the sake everybody wanted him you know uh uh they talk all their sick people to him they even had to break the roof of a house to let a sick man down but then when he sat down and started to teach them the word when he started to teach them the word brother bam said in in the message uh uh leadership he says that was where the ministry of Jesus changed when he started to teach the word he was no longer on a big healing campaign that was where brother Brandon Ministry changed when he started to teach the word the people said oh he was supposed to he was called a prophet to pray for the sake he's not a theologian he he never had anything to do with the word but he did not realize that was the changing of the ministry because asaiah has prophesied and said all of my children will be taught of me that's why God says he's interested in our teaching how we are taught praise the Lord he don't want us to raise ourself by the Shu understanding by the way people do things in church and we think that is the way it's supposed to be no he's interested in our teaching how are we taught are we together okay let's finish this and then we be close here he says and and that was different it said he was he was vampire see that was different he didn't explain it they did already seen the manifestation a Vindication of the word for for his age made real and prove to them that he was the messenger of that age and he didn't have to explain nothing those disciples might not have been able to explain it but they believe it whether they could explain it or not they said rise still and believe it how could would they tell if they were going to eat his flesh or drink his blood why it was impossible for them to do do it but they believe it because they were ordained Jesus said he choose them before the foundation of the word praise the Lord so you see when God when God gave you Grace to hear your name being called when God Gave You Grace and he has shown you that this is the message of the hour this is the word of God for this age praise the Lord when he gave you Grace and he have been able to help you to be able to identify the the uh uh uh uh the seven Angel message just like that lady that we we read about from the beginning she believed that this was a prophet and if she believed that he was a prophet she believed he was a prophet and that Prophet that she believed he was came to came to her and says this is the hand of the Lord if she believe he was a prophet she have to believe it also you see we only want to believe it when it's in our favor we only want to believe it when when we can understanding all that was the thing that got me when I was thinking about that when I was listening to that tape the thing that got me I'm saying to myself that what a faith what a faith she would tell the doctors just leave my baby can you just please leave my baby there let me let me call brother Brandon and they will leave the baby there a dead baby for a couple of days and he will be praying waiting on the Lord and He will come back and says it's the hand of the Lord and we will stay gather ourself together and accept it this is what God want and we say amen and then we move on praise the Lord amen they want to believe in if if if if it is just in their favor we want to believe it when it's in our favor we want to believe it when uh you know we can be able to no this almighty God that we serve his ways are pass funny out the thing that Rejoice our heart is because we have heard our names amen it's not a joining of a church we have heard our names and when we listen to that Prophet voice when we listen to the word of God being preached we are not just carried about Carried Away about all the excitement and all the manifestation praise the Lord for that amen we thank God for those things but what we want to hear is what what that Prophet messenger is saying because it is that word that gives you power in the age that you are living to realize that the spirit that we are risling in this age I mean the the the the internet Spirit the technology and all the demon power brother bar say every age had inherited from it uh uh succeeding age the spirit of the age just to realize that it is the word nothing but the word that gives you power more than a manifestation we want the word praise the Lord amen more than the healing of our body do you do you realize that in this age people would will rather the healing of their body and the condemning of their soul let me say something to you tonight before I close that prophecy over in Isaiah chapter 53 by his tries that we were healed is more than the healing of our body that prophecy is tied to the Redemption it's more than the healing of our body it's not only limited to the healing of our body that's the reason why whether in sickness or in health our soul can still rejoice in the Lord praise the Lord how many people will back on the word of God and then they will fall away from falling serving God because the Bible said by his tribe I'm he and I'm not heal it's only limited to your body for you but for the Son of God or for the daughter of God is more than the healing of our body amen because no matter how many times that God heal us as long as we are in this life we will still have a headache we will still have a stomach ache we will still have a back ache because we are in a falling body but when he heal our soul by redeeming us back to the word and giving you the Holy Ghost amen amen it's onto the day of redemption hallelujah praise the lord it's on to the day of redemption the Lord bless you tonight thank you for bearing with me going through all my Loops tonight but blessed is the feet that has bring us Good Tidings praise the Lord that feet that was one foot on the land and one foot on the sea it didn't bring us an empty book it brought us a book with a message in [Music] it it brought us of a book to teach us how to get closer to God tell us what his nature is praise the Lord it brought us a message that said greater is he that is in you than he that is in this word praise the lord it's not your religious exercise it's that seed of God that is in you and as as that seed feels feel on the word praise the Lord we grow to be like the Lord the Lord bless you let's bow our heads tonight more than ever before Lord I need you and more than ever
