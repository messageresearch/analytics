[4:17] was in the tremendous let's appreciate
[4:20] the law tonight with her hand a praise
[4:23] [Applause]
[4:27] praise the Lord amen I was I thought
[4:34] that after the service like what we have
[4:37] on had on the weekend we would just make
[4:43] the service special to 90 men to
[4:46] appreciate the law for all that he did
[4:48] for us amen
[4:49] so we will have a but then have a
[4:53] testimony we were having to come quickly
[4:55] and then we sing a song we would take
[4:59] another test morning and then we go into
[5:01] a world of prayer before we go into the
[5:04] preaching tonight
[5:18] last Sunday last weekend was a special
[5:22] weekend it was a very wonderful moment
[5:27] there was no doubt that God honored his
[5:33] word for the Bible says for two or three
[5:36] agreed in his name that he is in fact I
[5:40] remember after the service I went to the
[5:42] pastor's office but a Darrell was there
[5:45] I told him I said when we gather in
[5:50] heaven which I look back and wish I
[5:53] remember this day referring to the
[5:56] service
[5:57] little did I know that a devil was
[5:59] planning a counter-attack so that is not
[6:04] new it wasn't the last it wasn't the
[6:08] first and it wouldn't be the last
[6:09] so I went home very early I start my
[6:16] shift 5 a.m. so by 4:00 I'm up I pray I
[6:19] go to wake so I came open my truck and I
[6:24] saw a chief came in opened ransacked
[6:28] everything tender cappers every single
[6:33] thing in the car and from what happened
[6:36] you could see that that was a veteran it
[6:39] was just not a novice I was so taken
[6:43] aback I just stood for a while and then
[6:47] I started singing and you know I just
[6:52] sat in the truck and I drove to wake you
[6:57] know what even baffled me the most most
[7:00] of the times I would leave my wallet in
[7:02] the truck as a matter of fact my wife is
[7:05] most security-conscious than me she
[7:08] would lock the door but it was open and
[7:11] I didn't care so much about my personal
[7:15] the debit cards and my credit cards I
[7:18] didn't care much about it but I have a
[7:21] company credit card with unlimited funds
[7:26] and I was wondering what would have
[7:31] happened you know sometimes I start wake
[7:34] at 3 a.m. and by 2 I'm in the parking
[7:38] lot and I was wondering what would have
[7:41] happen if I had walked in at that time
[7:43] probably the fellow was armed I have
[7:46] seen situations where they will take
[7:49] somebody at gunpoint carry us to the ATM
[7:53] and you would think after taking the
[7:56] money don't let go of you know then they
[7:59] carry you somewhere and is a different
[8:00] story
[8:01] and all that was just playing back but
[8:05] as God would have it that didn't happen
[8:10] but I had a lot of information in the
[8:13] car so my personal information and that
[8:16] of my wife is out there now I had to
[8:20] sign up for how do they call it
[8:22] LifeLock yesterday so taken that was
[8:27] just the end not me there was another
[8:29] showdown my elder son Danny called
[8:33] he bought a car and you needed to
[8:35] notarize some forms so we're going to
[8:38] pick him up now I was in the left lane
[8:41] there was a truck in the right lane a
[8:44] Ford truck e350 those big four buses and
[8:48] I as soon as we started moving I saw
[8:51] that that God between us was narrowing
[8:53] up so I slowed down and I started
[8:56] blowing my horn then he just veered in
[8:58] into my lane and then went to the
[9:01] extreme left and then stopped so I just
[9:06] drove past I didn't say anything then I
[9:09] said why would he do this so we just
[9:12] drove past I came back in the night that
[9:15] was Monday in the night I had two
[9:18] attacks in my dream and you know I'm not
[9:22] used to sharing bad dreams if it is not
[9:26] something that would encourage or uplift
[9:28] you I don't [ __ ] except it is a
[9:32] spiritual dream something that would
[9:34] encourage us then I'm compelled to but
[9:37] attacks something that will make the
[9:40] devil happy our outer are not I don't I
[9:42] don't share those dreams but you know
[9:45] God has been so good that was Monday
[9:48] night Tuesday morning I went to wake and
[9:51] I have never been so distracted on the
[9:53] job like Tuesday there were ten reasons
[9:56] why everything was supposed to go wrong
[9:58] but it didn't happen and at one time it
[10:02] happened I was supposed to put some
[10:05] ingredients in a mix it was lying down I
[10:09] didn't put it in it was one I
[10:11] transferred it to the next page that was
[10:14] when I remembered and you know this is
[10:16] an R&D setting everything we do there
[10:20] you know the plans are just waiting for
[10:22] it
[10:23] and you can't imagine screwing up
[10:25] something like that so I just wanna
[10:28] solve I do and I just prayed because
[10:31] everything that goes downstream if there
[10:33] is a mistake they will see it they do a
[10:37] lot of analysis downstream so they will
[10:38] see it so I just prayed and asked God to
[10:43] send out his angel to carry that
[10:45] ingredient add it inside there and just
[10:48] left it and I was just praying as I
[10:52] stood there and we went through there
[10:55] ran to the end and nothing happened and
[10:58] it's just amazing when I went downstream
[11:02] my colleague that told me that the
[11:04] developers are already taking their
[11:05] samples as I so soon he said yes and I
[11:10] went and I took a sample I tested it
[11:13] there was absolutely nothing wrong with
[11:16] it
[11:17] praise be to God and you know that was
[11:24] yesterday today I was going to work I
[11:27] said what is the next thing that devil
[11:28] is going to do I got wet everything was
[11:31] so fine somebody was supposed to work
[11:34] somewhere and they were went to the MgO
[11:35] they asked me to take over I went there
[11:38] it was a mixed platform now we have
[11:41] super sucks two thousand pounds that
[11:44] there is a hoist you would lift it now
[11:47] when you lived a super shock there are
[11:50] two bucks the outer and the inner so
[11:54] when you loosen the first one then you
[11:58] drag it in with a device then you loosen
[12:02] the one in the inside then the
[12:05] ingredient would come down this was
[12:07] conflab 2,000 pounds and when I was
[12:10] trying to loosen it it was hard to
[12:13] loosen it it's what tired of so I used
[12:15] the knife and then I cut it and then I
[12:18] took the rope off little did I know that
[12:20] I was taking the inner loop the inner
[12:23] loop out I didn't know so I just took
[12:27] the road I cut it and I drew it off and
[12:30] then the bag just came down a little I
[12:32] didn't know that I had taken the rope
[12:35] out
[12:36] and probably maybe from this distance
[12:39] the way better airiness so I just drag
[12:43] it in and as soon as it got to the
[12:46] hopper it just came down over oh so all
[12:52] along the rope was not even there I
[12:54] didn't know but so you know daredevil
[13:00] made a move in every one of the devil's
[13:03] moves but also made a move the Bible
[13:07] says when the devil comes against us
[13:09] like a flood
[13:10] he will the Spirit of God will lift up a
[13:13] standard against him and I saw the hand
[13:17] of God in every one of these it I mean
[13:20] it was just too amazing we are serving a
[13:24] Living God I want to encourage us I
[13:28] don't know what other devil is going to
[13:30] do but the devil would not surprise me
[13:31] in anything
[13:42] praise the Lord
[13:44] that's what you can expect after the
[13:47] good service on the weekend I mean but
[13:51] he can try it or he can let's let's just

[18:41] a man will do more practice on there
[18:46] praise the Lord
[18:47] since the catering has a testimony
[18:50] [Music]
[19:02] I have all my notes on my phone and it's
[19:05] not working
[19:07] so I'm gonna try this I actually have
[19:10] two testimonies one was when like a few
[19:18] months before me and that started coming
[19:22] back to church we had been like wanting
[19:25] to for a long time and just nothing
[19:27] wasn't really working out or we've kept
[19:31] forgetting about it or whatever and then
[19:35] I think it was a Sunday right
[19:38] well we I don't remember if we came the
[19:40] first time was a Sunday every Wednesday
[19:42] anyways it's not matter we came we
[19:44] finally got here and like before we came
[19:49] it just felt like to me that like it was
[19:53] just going to happen like we were just
[19:55] gonna go and it just felt different I
[19:59] guess and we that night brother one was
[20:08] talking about the binding power and I
[20:17] don't know how long he had been talking
[20:19] about it before then but that was the
[20:21] first time I had heard it obviously him
[20:23] talking about it during that time or
[20:25] whatever and just after that service the
[20:34] thought kept coming back to me that that
[20:41] someone had bound me
[20:45] oh and I just was like well how would I
[20:56] know that
[20:57] there's only that way that I could know
[20:59] that so I just kept pushing it away and
[21:03] then um the next time I know it was a
[21:09] Wednesday night brother one invited
[21:13] being a net to watch the service live or
[21:18] whatever and I couldn't make it that
[21:20] time because Josh was out of town and my
[21:22] kids go to sleep at 7:00 so I had to
[21:26] stay home with them obviously so I
[21:29] couldn't make it and so I I was really
[21:32] like I just put them to bed and then I
[21:34] saw his invitation to watch a stream at
[21:37] live or whatever so I joined and then in
[21:42] that service he was
[21:54] he was saying that he had written both
[21:59] my name and in debts and he wanted check
[22:02] and give it to God and I just wanted to
[22:11] share that with you for two reasons just
[22:15] to encourage you that when brother one
[22:22] preaches things he takes it into his own
[22:26] life and applies it in his own life and
[22:32] I wanted you to know that God did that
[22:34] during that time when he was preaching
[22:36] those sermons about the binding power my
[22:46] second testimony is um
[22:51] so back in 2015
[22:54] shortly after I had my first born I was
[23:02] diagnosed with a kaliesha and achalasia
[23:10] is an autoimmune disease as far as they
[23:15] know they don't know a lot about it
[23:16] because it's rare but as far as they
[23:19] know it's a autoimmune disease that
[23:22] attacks the esophagus
[23:32] like the muscle in the lower esophageal
[23:37] sphincter doesn't work properly so it
[23:41] just it's closed all the time and it's
[23:45] hard to get food to pass through into
[23:47] your stomach
[23:48] um and they usually typically the only
[23:52] there's like three options for treatment
[23:59] or whatever but none of them are there's
[24:02] no cure for it and none of them are
[24:04] perfect and there's other things that
[24:05] can go wrong so I decided not to do
[24:07] anything and I right away in the when I
[24:11] was diagnosed I just trusted and
[24:16] believed that everything was going to be
[24:18] for God's glory and I loved I lost sight
[24:26] of that for a long time but it was
[24:30] somewhere there so
[24:43] then I've struggled with my weight at
[24:47] one point I didn't know it I thought I
[24:50] was a hundred and twenty pounds but I
[24:53] was a hundred and ten pounds at one
[24:55] point so I've struggled with all of that
[25:02] eating and everything it's a bit hard
[25:07] but then brother Ezekiel was preaching
[25:10] and he called up a prayer line and he
[25:15] called up ever anyone who was sick and
[25:20] I'm not sure it was I I had my eyes
[25:23] closed but I think I was the first
[25:24] person he prayed for and he just he was
[25:29] speaking in Spanish so I didn't
[25:32] understand what he was saying but then
[25:34] he said receive it and I just felt like
[25:37] I did receive it so ever since then I'm
[25:47] pretty sure I've attained at least five
[25:49] pylons since that service and I still
[25:59] have a lot of the symptoms but I just
[26:02] know that I'm healed
[26:12] just all of the fear and the word is
[26:15] gone
[26:20] [Applause]
[26:26] praise the Lord

[49:33] know that they're too busy there are
[49:34] some basic facts that we already known
[49:37] as the message believer that our God the
[49:41] Lord God Almighty it no ends the ending
[49:45] from the beginning that correction in
[49:48] charge

[51:36] you want to see to be but here you are
[51:39] in this message so I want to tell you
[51:44] the implication of it
[51:46] and that I will type it to our prophet I
[51:49] come so I don't want to see I can break
[51:51] it down praise the Lord
[51:54] like I said you we are already ordained
[51:59] of God from the foundation of the world

[57:42] constraints you is that you it is love
[57:45] that is actually love that constraint to
[57:50] choose to forsake the things of this
[57:52] world to forsake the denomination and to

[58:37] its word it put it in the way that it
[58:41] must continue praise the Lord
[58:45] some quotes here the Lord to call is
[58:56] bright you use these prophets and we do
[59:01] know that we don't sometime as gentle
[59:04] nations we are gentle nations we are not
[59:05] whatever noise from whatever you know
[59:07] what it takes to to to have the prophets
[59:10] like the Jews who knows is to read a
[59:13] turn about movies fine difficulty to
[59:15] defend you got to break away from it
[59:17] because they understand the importance
[59:19] of a prophet so when we change our
[59:22] nation don't know let me let me let me
[59:25] let me let me stress more on all this
[59:28] relation
[59:29] she we are we good the leadership is a
[59:32] as long as we are part of him we can
[59:37] never come off lost there is no way that
[59:41] you can come up lost you surely we get
[59:45] that OD goes it gives you that it's your
[59:49] right if I don't you buy know me you
[59:52] have it usually we have it that's only
[59:56] because there is something dependence it
[59:59] didn't seem a meat-eater see telling you
[1:00:01] that making doctoral tax is dead
[1:00:05] deposited even when you don't even know
[1:00:07] him we are watching a chicken ban ban
[1:00:10] you know and o'clock lobby looking down
[1:00:13] but we are ego look it up by that's in
[1:00:17] your soul by that teacher alone in your
[1:00:20] soul you are a miniature God please get
[1:00:25] a clear me natural go deeper courses
[1:00:28] which means that will have the power we
[1:00:32] have that with the color leap to Messiah
[1:00:35] because we have him in portion so that
[1:00:38] makes it a little easier
[1:00:40] that makes it we are we are then boom of
[1:00:44] the same boom with God we have flesh or
[1:00:47] mr. fresher God praise the Lord
[1:00:50] uh no indication they can never be a
[1:00:54] wave you can be separated from God this
[1:01:01] war that can take you away from God
[1:01:04] absolutely impossible because you have
[1:01:07] answered home what is already in your
[1:01:10] soul is there
[1:01:12] permanent you can get yourself you know
[1:01:17] you can help yourself okay you maybe you
[1:01:21] want to say I will serve God again the
[1:01:26] Lord has a way of disciplining his own
[1:01:31] he has a warp disability soul the Bible
[1:01:34] say him I love a chest highs he
[1:01:39] disciplines his soul he will discipline
[1:01:44] you we praise the Lord
[1:01:47] as if reason you don't seem to are not
[1:01:52] catching it if you know that there is no
[1:01:56] debt for a Christian you will see them
[1:01:58] looking up like that
[1:02:00] what is that separation for that teacher
[1:02:06] to be the post angel so you can never be
[1:02:09] separated from your God it's not
[1:02:12] possible you can never be separated from
[1:02:17] God because you are part and parcel of
[1:02:20] him we have physical debt we have
[1:02:24] somebody don't pass away from us know
[1:02:25] what the Bible said no see we don't know

[1:02:57] that you cannot be stopped with the
[1:02:58] phone go I don't see a way I can't look

[1:03:03] this curse only give me a knife to cut
[1:03:05] my hand away I don't I just don't like
[1:03:07] this and you can't do that your system
