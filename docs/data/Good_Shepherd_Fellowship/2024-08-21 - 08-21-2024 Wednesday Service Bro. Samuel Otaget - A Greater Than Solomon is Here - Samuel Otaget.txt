thank you Lord thank you Lord praise the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen amen you love the Lord yes hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord what can we say about the service on Sunday amen was it a wonderful service amen amen praise the Lord I follow the service I think it was wonderful we pray that the Lord will Deliver Us from every romance and let his resurrection be a reality to us amen praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you and Lord bless you you may have your seat a little bit before we uh change the order of the service here praise the Lord let just take uh uh Luke chapter 1 and I we share something with you and then we call up the preacher for the night brother Samuel our friend from uh Uganda will be will be sharing with us tonight praise the Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah you love the Lord Luke chapter 1 we will read from verse one Luke chapter 1 we will read from verse one on praise the Lord amen for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in other a declaration of those things which are most surely believe among us even as they delivered them unto us which were word I mean which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and minister of the word now so this is luk bringing his own report now you have to remember that Luke was not among the disciples he was not among Jesus disciples uh Luke came uh uh somewhere along the line and uh he's trying to bring his own report now he's trying to tell us that he got his report from from eyewitnesses and people that were Ministers of the word which of course is uh uh you know the disciples and and and and many of you you read the book of Acts you will see how Luke came along and then he started to support Paul in his missionary work so let's go ahead and read a little bit here he says verse two again even as they deliver unto us which from the beginning were ey Witnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to mean also having her perfect understanding of all things from the very first now so Luke was more like an investigator everything he heard he went back and started sessioning it out so you will realize that in Luke gospel there are some information that you will not find in the rest of the other gospel praise the Lord amen because remember he's a physician and a physician is a man that is of details when you sit down with your your your doctor he want details how did this happen when did it happen what you think might have led to this praise the Lord it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to right onto the in order most excellent theop praise the Lord are we together praise the Lord now uh uh I was looking a little bit in the Book of Luke today you you can tell there and uh uh uh share something to with you before the the preacher comes and uh you know uh uh I follow of the service on Sunday and I and uh I really enjoyed the the the presence of the Lord the way you were receiving the word the way the word was preached and I think that it was such a blessing amen and we want to thank the Lord we pray that God continue to help our brother brother ariam and I think uh uh it is our responsibility to be able to encourage one another in the Lord and and uh and you know and and then uh he called me and uh you know taught to come and pick me up from the airport I knew why he did he wanted to know whether I listened to the service and he wanted to know if if uh if there is anything he needs to check with me about so as we drove from the airport we talked on different things and uh I appreciate him for the service and I thought well okay I think I have one on him and I should be able to get on him quickly now so uh uh uh you know uh uh in in the beginning the reading reading uh of the two uh disciples on the road of EMAs the Bible gave us the name of one cus and uh uh uh actually if you look in the message if you do research you will find places where brother brandham used the name he said theopus in he friend there are few places where he said theopus in he friend you know but if you look at the context of what he was saying I think he to say clear pass because unless there was another Theophilus the Theophilus that is recorded here to us was a Roman soldier that became a Believer and theopus Luke wrote this book to be able to present it to theil to convince him that you know this thing about the Lord Jesus is truth so it could not be that Theophilus that was on the road of EMAs because if not Luke will not be writing to Theophilus about Theophilus you see the you see where I'm going okay he will not be writing to Theophilus about Theophilus so both the Book of Luke in the book of Acts which of course is a continuation of Luke report he he he uh wrote there to to tus and you know that's the way that God does he raised up you know men of of great intelligence to be able to reach out to Men of great intelligence you see so if God bless you and put you in a place is for you to reach out to the people that are in that place so Luke had the education he had the background to be able to speak to Men of higher authority and that's what he was trying to do so if you actually look it up you will see brother bam says theopus and his friend there's not a quote where he said theopus and uh cleas no there's not a court so we cannot assume that theophilos was the one walking with clear pass on the road we don't have no authority to do that you know so brother B tells us we must not presum without Authority because the reason why he says that because if you you say something that is not word based the Holy Ghost can back it up you're on your own praise the Lord amen so uh uh we Fellowship a little bit on that because uh I I saw that you know uh and it just come from a place where you know there is that little sense of curiosity in US wanting to know who was this guy who was this other guy that was walking with cleers that is not men praise the Lord you want to know who is that person you want to know who is that person will that feel your curiosity let's make it in the Rapture amen let's make it in the Rapture praise the Lord I'm not going to bring a rabbit out of the heart I'm not a magician I'm a preacher and as a preacher I must tell you the truth if you want to know who is that person let's make it in rapture we will see him there amen amen the Lord bless you tonight let's stand on our feet and we call the preacher of the night amen God is good all the time amen let's sing there tonight while brother Samuel come and bring us a word [Music] God is [Music] [Music] God is good all the time he P the son of PRS in This Heart of Mine our God is good all the time in the back is night his light will shine God is good God is good all the time let's sing that one more time our God is good all the time before the S of PR in this high of Mind our God is good all the time he the th cast night his life will shine God is good God is good all the time let's sing the first verse down oh if you walk through the V and there Shadow All Around to not fear he will guide you and will keep you sa and sound he has promised to never leave you not forsake you and his word is true our God is good come on Brother Sam all the time in the God is all [Music] [Music] dark amen God is good amen all the time God is good amen just maybe you can just be seated for a while as I I greet all of you in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ again amen hallelujah amen amen happy to be with the redeemed of the Lord again amen amen I believe it has been a wonderful time and uh God has given us Grace to be together again amen I believe I was here last year and I don't know how many Peters are here again this evening how many Peters are here you know Peter reminded Jesus what Jesus had preached he preached about casting of the tree and the tree dried and then the following morning Peter reminded Jesus the sumon so I don't know how many remember how many remember what I pr last last time here wow almost nobody is Peter all right otherwise God bless you so much I'm again called brother Samuel or tette I come from Uganda and and uh my family and the church uh they send their greetings amen amen yeah like I said last time I have a big family of nine children five boys and four girls and they all uh love the Lord they Ser the Lord amen amen some of our preachers some singers and in fact my last born plays a bass guitar and he told me to to take for him a guitar buy for him a guitar so you pray for me amen some some are preachers and oh I thank God for that amen so I just would love to say we we we we need much of your prayers like I was talking in the 10th meeting in South Carolina that there is a a revival going on in Uganda many many people are coming to the Lord amen and uh there is a place uh called carja that's a place where by the natives there are still like I don't know we call them primitive or whatever um some time back they just used to walk naked but the gospel has reached there and within two years they have baptized about 600 people amen yeah so uh we need your prayers and many churches are opening and I believe God is doing a great work there amen so uh without wasting time we can just stand up and read the scripture and before we read the scripture we just need to bow down our heads for a word of prayer Our Mighty Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you and appreciate you and give you the glory and honor for the grace the Lord God you have granted un to us first of all our Father God is for your predestination that before there was even the foundation of the world you knew us Lord and that's why in this age you call us that we may be manifested Sons and Daughters of God in this hour and Lord as we are gathered together here in your name father may you come down lord and speak to us and Lord reveal yourself to us father you know the need and the desires of our heart and only father who can grant unto us and oh God raise our faith from glory to glory father you know the needs of your people here and Lord as you speak your word father you'll be meeting their needs for you are the high priest with touched even by the feelings of our infirmities and Lord today we have come with a lot of needs a lot of desires we have presented our prayers and request unto you and we believe that father you are the same yesterday today and forever you are a God who answ our prayers Grant king of glory as we open the word Lord may you take me out of the way use me as a vessel to speak to your people what you have ordained for them to hear today that Lord they may draw more more Clos to you in Jesus Christ name father Lord we pray amen amen amen I want to thank God for pastor uh one I believe he such a wonderful man of God Amen amen yeah to allow me to stand in his pull pit I remember even last time I was he was not around but he trusted me to to speak to you his congregation God bless you and brother BR say that you must love your pastor do you love your pastor amen because he's the one to lead you through according to the prophet um just for a short while I don't know am I seeing the watch I might go over time okay it's already 8:21 so maybe God willing uh let me just [Music] see I just want us to go the book of second chronicles and uh we are reading from chapter 20 and we read verse 20 chapter 20 of 2 Chronicles and verse 20 it says and they Rose early in the morning and went forth into the wildness of teoa and as they went forth Jehosaphat stood stood and said hear me oh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall he be established believe His prophets so shall he Prosper amen and also we want to read the book of Matthew Matthew chap 10 verse 46 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in a in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous reward amen maybe you can even read 42 and whosoever shall give to drink and to one of those this Disciple This little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward and may the Lord bless of his word you can be seated I just want to by the leadership of the Holy Spirit uh to speak on a greater than Solomon is here amen and my inspiration Lord Grant unto me the desire of my heart amen amen Lord grant unto me the desire of my heart and I believe tonight you also have a desire and that's why today we have a prayer meeting and in fact you know I always tell people when many times when you go for prayer meetings people even don't have what to pray about right they just come because it's a prayer meeting but they don't have any desire they don't have any burden they don't have any need but we thank God that uh we have needs and we have desires and every time when there is a prayer meeting like this we should be coming with burdens with needs with requests to present them before the Lorden amen yeah so we believe that every every need and every desire that we have God is more than able yes to provide amen because God keeps his word yes is that right yes and he fulfills all his promises amen amen when God speaks something and when God promises something we believe that his duty bound to fulfill it amen amen that's why he says ask and shall be given knock and they shall open for you seek and it shall find amen so when we come to God we believe that every promise in the Bible amen he must give us amen and by faith we receive them because every promise in the Bible is mine amen amen so we have a right as a children of God to claim for every promise because we are hairs to every promise of God amen amen uh I I love what brother brah says here uh we shall just go quickly in the message God keeps his word amen uh that was pre in 58 03 that was maybe March 28th and paragraph 12 he says here uh there is one thing that we can surely rest upon that is that God keeps everyone of his words he watches over them day and night to perform them and every promise that he made is true and that gives us such a blessed hope when we know that what we read out of the word God the all sufficient one will keep that word not one J or one little one title shall fail what a perfect Assurance as we read where others have taken him at his word and to see that sometimes it looks very crucial it looks like sometimes that it's going to fail but it just don't fail amen sometimes we look at the promise of God like I it's not going to happen as if going to fail but it will not fail amen amen when God promises healing he promises Deliverance he promises Victory all the promises in the Bible are true amen and we receive them by faith amen so all the redempt blessings in Christ Jesus are yours amen amen amen let us read in the Bible and then you find out that every promise in the Bible every Redemptive blessing in the Bible I believe in uh in the message that talken the prophet says if the if the blood of Jesus Christ is in you amen and Christ is living in you you are a child of God and you are a daughter of God and everything that God has is yours you have a right to eat you are you become a hair together with Christ Jesus amen amen but then uh the prophet says but then though those promises are ours we have a right to those promises but there are conditions amen there are condition set in order to get them amen sometimes we might pray we might fast we might do this and the other and all that we can do and we don't get what we are asking for because there are conditions amen says there are conditions to get those promises there are conditions to get those blessings amen until you fulfill those conditions you will not get what God or what you are requesting or what you asking from God amen amen is that right yeah brother says here in the message influence influence preached in 63 uh 11 12 paragraph 10 he says all promise of God are true but they are uncond conditions amen no matter how fundamentally right we are we have got to approach it in the right way now man can be fundamental right and still not receive the blessings of God because it is approached in a wrong way it goes upon conditions wow praise God so we can pray we can f us we can do everything but you must go according to the conditions that God has said amen then you can receive what God wants you to receive amen amen in the message also the world is falling apart I will not read so many many things but I just want to to just get some points here the word is falling apart uh that is preaching [Music] 63 11 15 and the paragraph 143 wow now we find out that God promis to supply all of our needs is that right the needs we have need of in this journey is that right congregation say Amen but remember he only supplies it on condition we have got to meet his condition first if we do not meet his condition he will not meet our condition we have got to do the thing that's right first got to go down to the bottom and build up that's exactly we can't start at the top and come down we have got to go to the bottom and build up go back to the Bottom now he'll meet our condition all of his promises are on condition wow so now then we start wondering oh but I've been praying and praying is that why my prayers have not been answered maybe there are some conditions that God wants you to meet amen amen now like uh the Queen of Sheba I believe all know the story about the Queen of Sheba uh the Bible says can we just read a bit chapter 10 of First Kings uh First Kings chapter 10 she was a queen but there was a desire in her heart amen and there was nobody who could fulfill that desire who could Grant unto her that desire and the Bible says but she had the wisdom of Solomon amen and when she had the wisdom of Solomon she had to travel all the way up to Jerusalem amen amen and when she traveled there she not just go empty-handed amen she had to give to go with something amen and after giving all that which he gave and then perceiving and knowing who Solomon was amen then Solomon granted unto our give her the desire of her heart amen uh First Kings can we go go a little bit First Kings chapter one chapter one uh chap 10 and from verse one and when the queen of she had heard of the F of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that be spice and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from King from the King which he told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built at the meid of his table and the seting of his servants and the attendant of his ministers and the appar and the cup barel and the scent by which he went up up the house of the Lord there was no more room no more SP in her and she said to the king it was a true report that I had in mine own land of why thy acts and of thy wisdom how better believe not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I had amen what the condition was for her to go on all the way to Jerusalem yes that's right amen and see not only hearing but and see amen what God can do through a man reveal the secet of her heart and even know her desire amen amen amen oh let us just jump a bit to to verse 13 no 12 verse 13 and King Solomon gave and the Queen of Sheba all her desire what was her desire she had all the money amen she had all the gold and the silver but there was a desire in her heart amen and today many s when people say oh God bless God people only look at money no we have many desires amen whatsoever she asked beside that which Solomon gave her of his Royal Bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants amen she got a double portion amen amen so she got a double portion the desire of her heart and the Royal Bounty amen amen I would have brother say the message Solomon is here but we shall just because of time now we come to the Widow the widow woman Amen in chapter 17 verse 8-6 we know the story whereby The Bible the the the woman was it was the time of drought of hunger in Israel and the man of God Elijah is the one who said is not going to rain Hallelujah until I call for it right amen and now this Widow was in that time and she was praying and fasting and praying and fasting calling upon the name of the Lord amen amen and then God speaks to his servant Elijah he says come Elijah I have commanded Ed a widow woman to sustain thee amen and you know God could have taken Elijah to any rich man in Israel there were rich men there was a man who kept about 70 7 is it 700 amen but he took her him to a widow woman who had a desire amen right amen and then there was a condition praise God and Elijah goes and meets her and says oh can you give me a drink of water oh okay if a drink of water that one is okay because you know this there is drought but there is some water that I've been keeping God wanting to know her heart amen and when she was willing the man of God says oh no I didn't mean water I meant food God bring for me food and bring it for me cook it for me I eat it then you and your child will cook your later the one says oh no no no no man of God how did she know she was a man of God Amen amen he recognized him as a man of God Amen he said I don't have anything it is only the little meal I'm preparing to cook for me and my son and we die the man of God says no go and cook it for me first and look at this woman she goes and Cooks the only food the only meal hallelujah hallelujah and he bring the man of God and the man of God is eating and the son is looking and is hungry my God hallu amen amen there was a condition amen and then after she fed the man of God the man of God say okay go and cook for yourself and the Bible say say that food sustain them amen for the three and a half years amen that was a des for had to survive to live throughout that a that time with her son is that right and the Bible says that boy one time died amen but then God through the servant his servant he prayed for the child and the child came back to life a double the dou of portion sustain them throughout the year throughout the drought throughout the hunger and then back life a double portion but there was a condition amen what about if that woman could have said no no no I can't give you my food I can't no no no this food is just enough for me only I'm going to cook it for myself and I die could have she been sustained throughout the week could could have that child come back to life so there was a condition and the moment she made the condition all the desire of her heart was granted her amen amen I believe that Brothers amen let us go to the shite woman amen the Bible says I may not read that one but we know it the Bible says there was a shunamite woman amen and then she's she a man of God Amen recognizing the man of God she says to her husband this man who passes here he looks to be a man of and you know sometimes even the church fails to recognize their Pastor as a man of God yeah but this woman recognizes this is a man of God that's why even H the the widow woman recognize Elijah as a man of amen even the queen of she she recognized Solomon as a man of God Amen that's what says whoever receives you has received me as a man of God Amen so the Bible says this woman said to her husband the man who always passes here he looks to be a man of God why don't we build for him something h house and put beddings there and put food there so that whenever he comes amen he he he he rests there he he gets conforted there he he gets something to eat there amen and she did it several times and then God was happy she met the condition is that right right and the Bible says the spirit Came Upon elishah and elishah says come on call that woman because of what she has done she has met the condition amen and when she was called she said you woman according the time of life you are going to embrace a child says no no no man of God don't deceive don't lie don't lie to your maid amen my husband is old isn't that what G said she doesn't have a child even husband is old meaning that this woman had prayed and fasted and prayed for a child but she had not got it yes yes God waiting for her to meet a condition and she said no my husband is old I am also old we can't get that but the Bible says it happened according to the word of the man of God she embraced a child is that right amen now that woman had had been praying and fasting all that time she was a Godly woman according the Bible amen but God was waiting for her to meet a certain condition and that was to receive the man of God Amen and keep him and feed him and then God gives her the desire of her heart amen amen and the Bible tells us that boy one day was working with the father and he started crying oh my head my head my head oh my head and then the the father says okay take him there to lay with lay down there a bit to rest and the boy dies and when the woman had a boy had died he went and L him on the bed of Elijah amen and she said God me let me go to that man I told him I I not desire I not ask him for the child he must and they rod and Elijah said now oh my Deacon you take this Roo and and and lay on the Sun the woman says as thy God liveth hallelujah all thy God leaveth all thy soul leaveth I shall not leave you Hallelujah I shall not leave you Hallelujah I must go with you and when they went Hallelujah they found the boy was dead and Elijah laid on the child is it seven times and the boy came back to life a double double portion amen amen amen giving the child and also raising the child back to life double op portion so there are things that God wants you to receive but there are conditions and you might not know what the condition is amen but when you meet that condition God gives you the desire of your heart amen amen amen wow yes look at uh let us look at Abraham amen God gave him a promise of a son amen and Abraham was waiting for the son and believing for the son and trusting God will fulfill his word amen but for 25 years there is nothing and it's God who promised him amen God told Abraham I am going to give you a son until then the wife said no maybe God was meaning this woman let another woman let me give you another woman but God's word can never fail [Music] God meant who sah now I'm too old how can that promise be fulfilled but God's word can never fail if God said something he's going to prove it he's going to make it to come to pass Hallelujah and here comes god with the two angels walking to fulfill the the promise amen but their conditions amen he just goes as if he's passing away just walking like he's going AB said that man identifying who the man of God that man looks to be a man of God man no no no don't pass by come come and and at least just have a drink of water amen is that right brothers and then Abraham fed them and took milk and they ate a cal and so and then when God was satisfied amen amen I don't know whether maybe was the smell of the Cal and the mil was now coming out where is s your wife oh she's in the T in the time of life Sarah is going to have a child Hallelujah and the Bible says sah say surely this man instead of just eating and going away what is he talking about let him just eat and go I'm not old now I'm 90 years old and I've been waiting for that promise for all that time but because they fulfill the condition hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and Sarah was changed to become a younger girl Abraham was changed to become a younger boy amen and they got Isaac double double portion the change of the body and the receiving of the child oh hallelujah amen oh praise be of the Lord see God has set conditions for us look at this man in the book of Acts chapter 10 let us read that one a bit Acts chapter 10 the Bible says Acts chapter 10 verse one there was a man a certain man in kisia uh called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian band a devote man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much arms to the people and pray to God always he saw in a vision about the nth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying unto him Cornelius and when he had looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine arms are come up for a memorial before God and now send man to Jer and call for one Simon whose son name is Peter he loes with one Simon atana whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do meaning that Cornelius had a desire is that right and he was always praying and praying and praying but one good thing he was also giving the poor amen amen giving the PO that was the condition that God had set before him and the Bible says one day one night I think it was around around 3 an angel came to him us you are giving and your prayers have come before God now send someone to J and call one call Peter amen amen he'll come and tell you and give you the desire of your heart Hallelujah and the Bible says then Peter came and Peter saided preaching and speaking and before even complete the preaching the Holy Ghost came upon these people what was the Cornelius it was salvation hallelujah hallelujah and Before Peter when Peter was still speaking Hallelujah the Holy Ghost fell on and they started speaking tongues Hallelujah until the people were pet say even the Gentiles have received the Holy Ghost like us I believe that was the first time when the Holy Ghost fell on the Gentiles and Peter said now who can stop these people from being baptized who have received the Holy Ghost just like us and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's right the desire amen of Cornelius was met he was given the desire of his heart amen did he get a double por portion did he get double portion yes he received the word and then receed the Holy Spirit praise God amen amen oh praise God Amen then we go to Dockers in the Bible the Bible says Dockers used to to make good things not so amen and when she died what will they say oh God remember the good things this this woman has been doing I believe she was making those things and she was giving them out the church is that right and because of that the Bible says when Peter went there the widows and the people who were around there they were showing Peter you see the good things this woman has been doing Hall alah and when Peter Just prayed for her she came back to life oh amen amen praise God Isaiah chapter 38 when God is it sent sent Isaiah to Hezekiah is that right go and tell King Hezekiah let him prepare his house because surely he's going to die amen oh let us read that one a bit he's going to die and you know the word of God when it has gone forth it must come to pass but prayer can change things prayer can change the mind of God Amen it's only a prayer that can change the mind of God Amen Isaiah 38 he says in those days was ezekiah sick until death and Isaiah the prophet the son of amamos came out to him and said unto him thou says the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live then ezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the Lord and he said Lord remember remember me now oh Lord I beseech Thee I Bes thee how I I have walked before the in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Ezekiel wept when you are in a problem when you are in need when you are sick when you want God to answer your prayers you must tell him God Amen you see I've done this I've done this and I've done this amen and said Lord you see I have worked perfectly in thy way i' I've done that which is good I've done this and that and that Lord remember remember what I've done amen amen and the Bible says then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah saying go and say to ezekiah this th says the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer oh [Music] Hallelujah and behold I will add unto thee thy days 15 years eel just say oh God God God heal me God God heal me is that what he said no see what I've done hallelujah I've walked perfectly before you I've done good things I've done this and the other I've done this and the other oh Lord Oh Lord grant unto me the desire of my heart amen amen so don't just go to go and say oh God give me this God give me that you must show God what you have done how you have walked before him amen amen that's what is that's what ezekiah did he says God look at what I have done amen challenging God praise His name oh I've walked before thee with a perfect heart I've walked before thee I've done good i' oh I've helped your people I've served you Lord oh God add me more years and God changed his mind go and tell him praise God he's going to live more 15 years I believe the people that could have been around could have said is just a man this man is a false prophet the other time he says he's going to die again is coming he's going to live now which one is which but ezekiah had made the conditions praise God ah is my time over just maybe 10 minutes amen amen I just wanted to to give the testimony of sister and then we close amen the prophet was talking about sister hatti he said sister haty was a poor Widow in the church amen and now they were uh talking about the construction of a new church I believe and sister hatti uh gave pledge 20 is it something like $50 then the Deon say no no no sister 30 we know your condition you are too poor now if you give that $50 how are you going to live how are you going to sustain yourself so they told her maybe you you give $20 so when the prophet heard about that he said he wanted to give back sister her money because the condition that she was in was not good but according to him say that the spirit spoke to him and said no don't do that because there is something for her own there on the way amen that giving of that $20 amen amen was the condition that God has set before her and when she did that amen God gave her the desire of her heart maybe let us read that one and then we close my new ministry my new ministry uh preaching 59 my new ministry paragraph 491 are we together uh it says that poor Widow who had just told me that she Tred to give to this church $50 on a pledge to help build a new church and brother Robertson wouldn't take it and only let her give 20 of it and I said to myself when she was speaking I'll give her back the 20 but God said to me in my heart now not my my vision in my heart when Jesus was standing watching a widow woman put in three pennies where where where there were thousand of dollarss laying there what would have you done I said well if I would have been standing there said we don't need it sister we got plenty of money but Jesus never said it he let her go on and do it because he know what was down the road come on Hallelujah he know what was down the road for for her so help me God as my solemn judge God knew that was down the road for her and I run my hand in my pocket to get my pocket book to give her her $20 back and say sister but he said don't do it and then a few minutes when the question is is brought up about Jehovah J she said that is nothing but a truth and it come from a poor widow woman's heart God knowing she would ask the greater thing could be done as long as there is heaven when the stars is gone when there is no more moon no more Earth no more sea them boys shall live on through eternity with the same Jehovah who gave the immortal promise his promise cannot fail oh praise God hallelujah so the giving sister had to give that $20 amen amen that was the condition that God had set before her as poor as she was like the other widow woman who entertained elishah Elijah and fed El that was the only in fact somewhere the prophet says that oh my amen amen she she was the poorest in the church but the condition that God has said before her was to give the $20 amen and when she did that oh Kum there was a promise coming on the way there God was not going to answer and Grant unto her the desire of her heart amen amen oh praise God maybe let me read another one go tell and then we shall close go go tell sorry it will take you long but I believe this is wonderful for me because sometimes you can pray and pray and pray and we don't receive what we are praying God wanting you to meet a certain condition 175 the prophet says here amen and hat maybe not knowing what the woman was saying look how it bypass the rich and the Hy look how it bypass everything and come to a poor little old country woman there and I had $20 in my pocket to give back to the woman that she had pled $50 on the on this new church coming up and I don't say this to embarrass her she couldn't afford 50 cents really to give it but her heart in the message she wanted to brother brother N I believe had accepted to take the the rest of just let her give $20 of it and I had 20 I had two 10 bills in my pocket mea had given me for groceries and I said I'm going to give it back to her today then I thought something spoke to me said Jesus see that we put putting in her three pennies and he never took it back from her he let her go on because he had something greater down the road praise God little or did I know he was speaking to me the same way of a widow woman no husband husband was killed neither did I know that that was the the same one when I said then I'll just keep the $20 you have something else for her I said only thing I know that Jehovah is Jehovah he is able to provide a sacrifice and haty not knowing what she was saying raised up and said that is nothing but the truth brother brother oh my that was the right thing to say that was the right thing to say about that time the power of God struck that place I never felt such anointing when he did I saidy thus says the Lord ask what you will I don't care what it is God has given me the authority to give you your heart desire raen if you ask for a million dollars you can have it ask for that little girl to get up and walk she'll have it as for anything else she said what shall I ask brother I said anything that you wish that say the Lord oh what a feeling she looked around there s her Ed grhe headed daddy that had been brought back from the dead almost there s her Ed mother sickly there sister but she chose just what was right she had two teenage boys just in that age of Reckless her precious husband gone to Glory she was a Christian wait but the boys wasn't Christian she said The Souls of my two boys God bless her heart and I said th says the Lord you have them and here they are baptized into the faith they was telling me the other night even that little bitty boy wishing washing feet in there putting his hands over brother Neville's head amen amen life she she had option of asking for thousands of dollars millions or or maybe uh uh what would call maybe houses whatsoever or vehicles praise God but she asked for Life the sons were not Believers but says I need the salvation of my son that was her desire amen amen amen amen and today we have many desires we need the salvation of our children some of our relatives are not believe Believers even maybe your husband or your wife is not a Believer amen amen those are the greatest desires that God wants us to ask for not not necessarily money amen amen and God grants unto us the desires of our hearts praise be the name of the Lord praise be the name of the Lord amen thank God grants unto us the desires of our hearts but he wants us to meet some conditions I don't know which condition is he'll set before you but he'll want you to meet the condition like sister hearty amen like the San woman like the widow woman very poor but God sends a prophet for her to to feed him amen am amen amen and then she gets a deser of her heart may God bless you and if you have a deser tonight can you raise up your hand hallelujah oh glory to God father you wanted me to speak about this and Lord you are the one who knows the needs and the desires of your people even me Lord I have the same desire I have desires Lord and your people have desires that's why this a Prayer day today they have brought desires to you Lord they have brought needs to you Lord there are people who are sick somewhere there are people

the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you amen amen God bless you praise the lord we love the Lord tonight if we can just put up Psalm chapter 37 verse4 Psalm 37 verse4 I love uh the word tonight amen now you see many times when the preacher preach like this uh people that are used to what is happening out there they think that is a way of setting the scene for you to start giving gifts you know and uh uh Prosperity people might use that but uh I don't think that's what our brother was offer I think you get that right amen there is a condition set and Jesus when he read that scripture in Matthew Jesus said if you recognize a prophet you will give a prophet reward amen so there is a condition that is set and that condition is for you to be able to identify what God is doing in that moment identify what God is doing identify the one that God is using praise the Lord amen and sometimes that that is the thing that slip us because look here the colus was giving arms he was just giving he wasn't he was a nice man praise the Lord but you see Peter has to come this colinus was a gentile Peter was a Jew and colus have to be brought to the knowledge of what was happening at that time time what God was doing at that time for the desire of his heart to be made now the scripture says here sorry they had that of psalm 37:4 we read it this morning and for some reason we had to recite it together as a family Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desire of thine heart Delight yourself because just like the brother said you don't we we you don't know you can't guess the condition that might be set but you have to delight yourself in the Lord delight yourself in God's word praise the lord lord if it's your way I'm I'm you know
