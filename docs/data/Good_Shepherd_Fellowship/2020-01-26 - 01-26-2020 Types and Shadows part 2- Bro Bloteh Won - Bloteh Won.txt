able to kind of fold just it's just it's just an open talk and then we will see how the law will be able to leave from the appraisal Lord and this morning brought Jordan will be doing the little presentation for us on on all the things they're being kind of for working out back there to be able to help us serve you better and and to my surprise the Easter 2020 meeting is already out so this

farmers amen praise the Lord so if the farmers are coming you got to come ready because we're gonna have good service amen and brother Jesse Smith he's a pastor over in Ohio Bride of Christ tabernacled a couple of months back he wrote this book he's a pastor day he have a colorful a teaching ministry he likes because he's a teacher actually at school so he likes he likes digging into history and in trying to bring a very rich varied I mean good resources that could be a help to us he wrote this book called restoring Christian modesty and he sent me a copy and and I shall go through waiting and then find the time to order some so I order 10 copies is $10 and and for our young people we will we will we will be reading this it's photo with history scriptures and and different things that can really be able to see the age that we are living in where all of these naked people coming from and all of these I mean a strange appearance that we you know our modern faction and all of those things it's a very very very very resource resourceful book and I would encourage you to run and get a copy amen if you if you if you want to copy it contact us and then we will be able to give you a copy but like I said young people will be going through this entire book when we start having our fellowship together so I want to make sure that I get few copies order

able to eat but I think the curse is broken amen like like Davey said the snare is broken and we have escaped praise the Lord thank you brother thank you all right I actually just have a brief presentation and a little bit of an announcement here with our website we've been working on seeing how we can kind of streamline things both on the website and for getting announcements out for a couple of things like brother one usually sends out these texts when we were having poor weather either on Sundays or Wednesdays for changes of service we're trying to get away from him having to bear that burden and so what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be pass if you feel you you're a member of this church and you would like to get those updates we're gonna be passing out a contact information page well I won't pass it I'll put it in the back there and at the end of service you can grab one throw it out where it's asking for a first and last name so we know who you are phone number if you'd like to receive a text for changes of service times due to weather or something like that and then an email address just like that flyer you saw brother one had for the Easter services for any special services we're gonna be having if you'd like to get those updates then go ahead and put your email on there as well a couple of things we want to just show real quick on the website we've been making some changes here is we have our sermons obviously and then our livestream has become very active in fact I'll click on it real quick here and you'll see we're live right now so right now this is what's going out it's about a minute or two behind us you give me the mouse to the top of the page with the services and sermon wise we are fairly up-to-date and all of our sermons are coming in and they will be posted you should be Laxus them if for some reason you don't see the most recent service all these are actually being live streamed through YouTube we're using YouTube as our server and you should be able to go to our YouTube page right up here and access them immediately after the services is over these are available they will have the date and title of the service with along with whoever it was that ministered and then these are cert this sermons page is searchable so you can either search it by the topic series or the speaker was that preached the service you could search it by that or of course by the month the year and year here so that is available and we have our calendar down here we're going to try and keep this calendar is up to date as possible so we all know what's going on so as you can see here we went ahead and split up the Sunday service so we have the times both for adult and children's Sunday school and then this start time for the actual service same thing on the midweek service it's here and then we went ahead and you'll see that our communion service with start time is here as well for every first Sunday of the month if that changes we'll make a change either here on the calendar or that's where it will send out the text information if that changes but all this information on the calendar if you wanted to know what what's going on on any one day should be here in advance the same thing with any of our special services coming up they should be here so this is our Easter meetings and then we will be attaching that flyer that brother one showed everybody to these dates so you if you want to share that flyer either electronically or print it out and share it with somebody you should be able to come in to these dates and share it from there does anyone have any questions on the YouTube side we're archived back maybe only I think maybe September or so that's kind of when we powered that up but if you actually have a date of a service that you would like we have an archive not always on video but definitely audio going back for years available that I don't know that we're backed up on the website that far okay correct so we have services archived back through 2018 and then going forward every service will be there yep any other questions all right well if anyone does like I said these slips will be all in the back so if you're wanting to get those updates go ahead and grab one fill it out and turn it in and I'll just turn the service back over over the bend we've removed the comment section so you cannot post comments randomly they'll go public yeah [Applause] good to have you be sitting with us god bless you god bless you praise Lord we want to thank a lot for for that Thank You musicians that will be all for the music who do the rest at the end of the service we want to thank the Lord for for all of those development the brothers being working tirelessly I mean they've been putting every time into a to get this thing up brother Andrews brother Jordan and every one of them back there sister faith I mean every one of them being kind of for working to have this thing going at first when I was approached with this whole thing of the internet I was not too comfortable with it and but then there was a brother that visited with us here and then he was I mean after the service he came to me in an Axman in says he said bruh won't you you people had a website I said well no we've been talking about it but we have met we are not really gone in their direction yet it's a world I think it would be a good thing for you people to do because and we talked about it you know I give him an mine you know a little little of my view of what I was trying to to stay away from and because I know they're they have very negative way that people try to approach these things but then his view was more of an outreach you know it was a more of an outreach anything that we can you can give the side to somebody or send somebody on the YouTube channel and then maybe the Lord will kind of touch the heart or they could enjoy the service or they could learn something from what has been shared so looking at the place for from from the area of an outreach that is that is the basis of why we are doing this also we know there are some of the the Saints that live far and especially this time of the year during the winter it's a little bit tough for them to be able to make it a service with distance some of them make a lot of sacrifices snow rain sound shine here they come but also for those people they can be able to be part of the service be if the weather stop them from coming and we also have a big you know a group of us that stay have now found that perfect schedule for work and they can also be able to make use of the service if they are able to do it you know at that time of the day so that that is one of the thing behind year you know the purpose is net really to help you stay away from church and follow the service in your bed praise the Lord amen so but we want to thank all the brothers and we know they stay a work-in-progress you know a stated work in progress we will appreciate constructive criticism you know you know if you want to criticize those criticize us to be better don't criticize us because you are but you are better praise the Lord and so those reason why we work as time goes by they will bring you more updates and I mean it's of a big help you know we will not we will never forget our friend and brother but Lord it was all behind I was doing this you know many years ago it's just that I just thought how we were not at the right place to start there but we want to thank God and believing that his grace is sufficient and that grace will be able to take us true amen Wednesday night I was speaking a little bit on types in shadow and and and the reason why I was talking on type and shadow is because it's a keystone in the Bible types and shadow is a keystone in the Bible because the things from the Old Testament are reflected in the New Testament and it makes it easy as believers today for us to be able to approach the subject and we can see what God did in the Old Testament down to the New Testament and what he want to do today in our lives so looking at all of the earth another thing that was on my mind that I've been thinking about long was to talk a little bit around the Elijah ministry you know to talk about the Elijah ministry all of those things were kind of a run into our types in shadow and but you know as as we as we have believers you know we we talk about you know Malachi for promise we talk about you know the prophet Elijah but I was I was studying and I will tell you that now a real was net I did I never thought that I had all mind you know my resources together to be able to approach it this morning but something just confirmed it to my heart yesterday and and what actually it was I was here sometime in the evening and like I would do you know once in awhile and you know you think about people and then you try to check on them you try to encourage them there was a young sister that was here then brother Ariel you know encouraged her she started coming to church with us and and she was an international student you know don't go down with her studies and she had moved to Texas so once in a while you know I would kind of talk to her see how she's doing you find a church to go to have you found work you know and and moreover you know she and her fiance they planning to do their wedding he came one time from Canada and visited with us here so I mean they kind of encouraged us if there is any way that we can be able to you know encourage them be there are things that we can be able to talk to them that would be helpful in a sign in a sense of some counsel so I had privilege to talk with her there back in the Congo and you know in order there so I just thought about her loss and that's why I don't know if she's if she has settled down a little bit and after we talk about different things work in church and all of that so accesses well what have you been reading what is your devotion what have you been reading she says well I just been reading over in the book of James I said yeah what is that you can you share a little bit with me so I've been reading about you know how Elijah prayed that there should be no rain you know for three I don't know what it was three and a half years or three years you know she was just trying to and I kind of forgot her off God so I could see her shaking a little bit but I just wanted to start a conversation you know and just encourage her you know pretty soon I will find out whether she was really know whether she was not so and so I actually bought one layer to read there you know what what did you got out of the actress's well you know I what I got out of it was to see that you know sometimes I limit God in my prayer you know I'm afraid to ask for some things you know but to see that a man can ask God you know that there should be no ring and and God who granted then I think you know there was nothing we can ask the Lord you know if it's the right thing so we started talking from one thing to another and I appreciate that and the anything about it there is that there was the scripture that was sitting right before me I was studying about James I was comparing it to two first King I was just looking at the the whole Elisha what actually I was looking at was brother Branham said there was seven Church edges Israel has seven Church edges just like the Gentile has seven Church edges so I was looking at from Solomon to Elisha some of the things that were happening though so some other things we'll go through this morning I would try to run through it and but I was looking at first Kings chapter 17 just put Elijah right before us the very first verse speaks about Elijah the Tishbite a man of Ginley and he comes on the scene and ever even tell us nothing else and it just he comes on the scene he bring a word to a hub he said they will not be rain or Dew you until I cover it praise the Lord now why would God you know why would the scripture give us such an introduction of a man like that what was happening what was happening now as we talk about types and shadow if if the law can be able to help us to be able to set a scene for us to see what was happening in that time then we will be able to appreciate our Elijah ministry praise the Lord amen we will be able to appreciate why we have to you know stay with the message of the hour praise the Lord amen so then after we got through talking I was I wanted to wrap up because I want to do just I didn't want to lose my my talk but I just said to myself well I did not plan for this conversation this just sound like what I'm going to speak about tomorrow so I started preaching to her a little bit as I might be talking on this tomorrow so let me give you a little bit but there is one thing I would say this morning you know all the churches we talked about the double portion of Elijah we want to go in a rapture like Elijah we want to be able to smoke the water split things we want to be able to defy Kings defied Authority but I will tell you this morning right in the book of James the Bible lay out a foundation it laid out something very very important the Bible says Elijah was a man of like passion just like we are he had all of his struggles he half years he had doubts because he was a man of like passion but another thing the scripture says that is very very very very important if you don't hear nothing from me this morning don't let this one pass from you the Bible say he prayed earnestly underline their word earnestly that was the beginning sucess of Elijah's ministry amen there was the beginning sauce that there is two things there now you think about it think about it before we read the scripture this morning you think about it the Bible says he prayed that there should be Noreen now watch the scene now don't miss it Elijah never went to a hub and told a hub there will be no rain until I call for it before he went to pray know he pray and he was convinced he knew where he was standing when he approached that King and said there will be no rain or Dew you until I praise the Lord are we together so the work was already done and the scripture gave us a reason why why he had to do that what we're talking about here we're talking about a drought we're talking about all the rivers will go dry you know all the lakes there will be no water that the farmers will not be successful to plant anything in those three and a half years praise the Lord as we study the subject you will even realize that the drought even started before Elijah came on the scene because he have already prayed he asked God law shut up the heavens before he even came to a hub he have already prayed if you look through the scripture which of course I would bring it out so we can be able to see it in larger came after six months of drought and he's announcing so yeah I'm the responsive that now if you watch the scripture that that is the reason why they have accusing you are the one that is troubling Israel you either want to have done they stink you say no I'm not a one you and your father house how are we together but I want to go back and say if we cannot be earnest there is no word you can go with God if we cannot be earnest earnest with our very self we can play religion we can play message we can play whatever we want to play if that foundation of honesty is not there that's the very ground for rupturing faith praise the Lord he prayed earnestly it's beautiful how the scripture would describe him as a man of like passion he was not an angel he was a man of like passion he was broke he had he was disappointed and there are there things that are happy in his life but there is that is one thing that James gave us but there is another secret that is hidden in the scripture and we want for us to look at are we together less than to our feet and read the Bible first Kings chapter 17 I was doing all of these things and everything laid out anything for the scripture reading I just had a bunch of scriptures that we that we would go through but let's take first Kings chapter 17 and let's introduce this man Elisha the reason why I wanted to talk about this lay the foundation because we will be talking about how God used this spirit of Elijah or the Norton of Elijah through the ages seven times we look at all of their together are we together first Kings chapter 17 verse 1 any larger the Tish birth who was of the inhabitants of Gately say onto a hub as the Lord God of Israel livid this was very very important as the Lord God of Israel liveth the reason why Elijah had to bring their introduction is because bill worship has rised so much to the to a high top that the God of Israel was like a dead God to the Hebrews so Elijah had to emphasize on there as a Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be Dew or rain this years but our calling to man word amen let's pray together father we just want to trust you this morning and be able to bring this to your people father it's not all we can get through this morning but I'm asking you to just annoyed the word be able to take out some thing from the word this morning that will lay on our heart that we will see the seriousness of the time that we are living in and oh god we will see the things that you require of us we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name Amen Allah bless you you may have your seat first came chapter 7 chapter 19 first Kings chapter 19 let's look there first came chapter 19 praise the Lord I want to bring another thing that I want you to underline and keep in your heart just to be able to bring this picture clearly first King chapter 19 verse 9 and 10 9 says and and he came hither onto a cave and large deer that's Elijah and behold the word of the Lord came unto Him and he said unto Him what does thou here Elijah and he said Elijah said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken by coveting thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets now you see these other things that drove Elijah to that condition this is the thing that was consuming him this is the thing to have got ahold of him that make him to go and say God if this is happening shut up the heavens if this is the attitude of the people how can we be enjoying your blessings and we have forsaken you now you see that is the reason why the scripture interpret itself even though chapter 17 brings us on a scene with no history of Elijah we don't know his parents we don't know where he came from we don't know how he grew up but somewhere in a structure God hid the burden that the the the the the thing that was consuming this boy life this male life he watched it all through the ages who go through that and see a little bit but he says right here and have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts I have been very jealous for the children of Israel has for seeking that coveting have been very jealous they have trolled down your autos they have builded altars of barns they have established different things in your heart their desires for popularity money women the desire for laude sure is more than the desire for you they have turned down your altars and they have slain your prophets praise the Lord in this age they are not killing them like Jesse bear who killed neighbor in this age I mean they are just ridiculing the Prophet he says and I even I alone so you can see the condition he's in with everything that he's seen around him he came to believe that it's another one that is having the problem this thing is just becoming a common thing a common way of life I'm I'm the only one having this problem I'm I don't want to see what is happening ah and I alone I would together I'm left and you seek my life to take it away praise the Lord so that's a little history of Elijah some of the things he was dealing with in his day are we together but just that they my notes made it back there okay thank you thank you let's let's take what our separation let's take water the separation let's build a little history you praise the Lord are we together amen are we interested in looking into this praise the Lord what are the separation just speaking of it in three dispensation we could bring it down through the Old Testament and through the seven church ages for the seven struck and so forth now what he's talking about here was when the lamb was slain the high priest would take the hyssop put it in the blood of the Lamb comes to the tabernacle and spring it seven times he's going to Centrify everything in the tabernacle with the blood of the Lamb that was that was sacrificed for the sin of the people he's going to get seven stripes now he's typing there are seven strike with the seven church ages which means that seven church ages will be under the blood are we together through the seven church ages for the seven strap and so far and that's that's another thing the brothers will also be working on they will they will take my notes and put it on the side so if I read something and you want to really be gained you can go there and and be able to find it okay so we don't want to make up our own things we want to make sure we are saying what the word is praise the Lord there are seven different strikes represent the seven Church ages Israel natural and the Gentile Church in spiritual seven church ages so in one sense he's affirming year.there Israel Hadiya seven Church ages that was under the blood and the Gentile Church will have her seven church ages that was also under the blood are we together amen because he's talking he went and talked about the tabernacle the seven golden candlesticks that was in the tabernacle there are seven golden candlesticks representatives and and the seven golden candlesticks or inker with the seven stripes Paul said in a book of Hebrew everything in the tabernacle was sprinker you know the blood had to cover it praise the Lord amen so the blood covered the organs that covered the violin they covered the drum that's the reason why we will not play reggae we would happily nothing contrary to the world because it must all be under the blood are we together Israel natural the Gentile church in spiritual seven Church ages just exactly the same way in Israel had seven church ages right in a bloom of it best come here and married this marry this idolatry and broad and idolaters in and course idolatry in Israel the Christian Church did the same thing out of the Dark Ages come right in and marry right into the same thing and brought idolatry into the church into the Christian Church again why are we not denomination just take another thing here if you were noticed at the beginning when God begins to deal with the Jews and they went through that golden age now this is the reason why I brought in this out of court because Solomon Asch was considered the Golden Age amen it was the age where the gift of discernment was in the midst of the people praise the Lord God a gift among the people that could know the intents of the heart and because of thy gift God brought the people to such a place where there was no war so am I never for the world there was peace with all of its nation in every day so that was the Golden Age but Washington was the thing there that got a little bit interesting year to me was there through their Golden Age and then the darkest age of the Jews the Jewish dealing God had with the Jews was in the reign of Europe so for the Jews they had a golden age before they came to the attackers age for the Gentiles we came from our darkest age to our goal in age why because the Alpha and Omega principle must be kept Golden Age in the beginning Golden Age at the end I went together if you read then through this you see bourbon and bringing out the same thing year he says and if you notice reading those Church edges there he gets right back to it again he said now a few things a God and said now right in that dark age fifteen hundred years there or the time of a half first and the Jews the darkest age they had when Ahab married Jezebel and brought idolatry into Israel and may all the for worship after a half after Jessica Oh God our dog our owner darkest ish was Constantine bringing Papa room and pig and room together amen and then the catholic catholic pagan church took over the catholic christian church and then that was when all the church started going through her toughest time where am i with all of this can somebody tell me praise the Lord now so what I wanted to bring out of year was Israel coming from the up Golden Age to the attack has age and then we came through our time our darkest age and then we are in our golden age amen now so as we as we look at this what I want to do here also is for us to just set a scene here by the grace of God and the structure let us know Moses taught the children of Israel that God Deuteronomy chapter 18 that God was going to raise up a prophet like unto Him and you say yeah yeah him there was the Lord Jesus Christ are we together praise the Lord so Jesus was a prophet like unto Moses and Jesus testify of John the Baptist when they asked John they said were you he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness and when they asked Jesus when was he he said it was that Elijah prays alone so two major prophets of the Old Testament two cornerstones of the Old Testament Moses and Elijah playing out in Jesus and John are we together praise the Lord so but we realize that right after Solomon when his son REE Brahm talked the truth one of these days I would just like to speak on the kings of Israel because if those period of time is a type of our church age period of time we can see the very same thing that were happening there happening right here amen the fall of Israel the reason why the fall the fall of Israel I will bring it to you and let you to realize that the apostasy of Israel was the corrupting of the priesthood when Jay LeBron corrupted the priesthood when he took men that were not qualified to go into the presence of the Lord and he bring them to be to be priests he corrupted the priesthood that was that was you you remember when David went together up and use he had tried to hold the ark because it was shifting God's much him did and we together dad was the beginning and that is the same thing with our Gentile age when when when when cattle is in started setting up seminaries and taking men into six month one year two year whatever time for them to go and learn and bring him man they will not qualify to handle the priesthood praise the Lord and he built three places of worship father son Holy Ghost turned into blood trained and and one in belter one in den and he says Israel this is the God that have brought you out there's no need of going to the temple where the Shekinah glory came down no need of going to Jerusalem nor near burned to Solomon temple he set up these things and he caught the people away from the presence of God he caught the people away from the from the the the the how you call it now the only place of worship there are Dame place of worship they place that God say he will meet men they place that God put his name God the people are from that and just gave them forms and just gave them you know big buildings and celebration and the people don't even know their God they go to church and they don't even know their God they can reference a Holy Father gave him all the respect and disrespect God on the basis of his world it's lying right there it's in the scripture go up order there for a reason and I'm hoping that the grace of God will be able to help us because if you don't help us we will be doing the scene amen we will be doing the same we can talk about history we can talk about you know God sent us a prophet the Prophet spoke scars into existence we believe that we love it but we are also getting into an area were the word is getting in the hands of men and that's supposed to be Henry in the world are we together he corrupted the priesthood so after Solomon it was 58 years 58 years that's between the time of Solomon and GE bro because right after Solomon his son really Braun took the throne and the kingdom splitted and God said because of my seven David's sake and we keep a light in Israel I will always keep a man on the throne of Judah I will together but so then wash it now from from Jerry Brown to Ahab there were seven evil wicked kings and they progress in their wickedness from one form of wickedness to another form of wickedness let's take our Bibles let's go quickly if we still on is because you slow me down first came chapter 12 first King chapter 12 first Kings chapter 2 off let's read from verse 25 quickly then Joe Abram bill shush him in money front and dword there and went out from banks and bill Pannell and and and Joe Brown said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of David if these people go up to sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of these people turn again the turning of the heart that's the elijah ministry he's turning the hearts of the people from God he said if the people constantly go to Jerusalem their heart will be in Jerusalem the heart will be with the God of Israel amen then surely then shall the heart of these people turn again on to their Lord even on to replumb the king of Judah and they shall kill me and go to rib Ramat he do were on to the king to counsel and make two cups of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem a man is too much for you to fast and pray and be crying just come father son Holy Ghost if you can pass the beasts and just go up and down that's enough it's too much it's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem behold that God be all that God o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he said one in belter and the other he put in them and this thing became a scene I mean for the people went to worship before the one even on to Dan he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest just last week we were talking about how God called Moses and say you bring the priests you washed him you are noting he was not even in the priesthood this is just a king I mean this is just and I'm a commander he's a military man and he said now he has bill churches for the people to worship he has given them God and now he has employed people to be priests I'm going to pay you a salary you just do like this convince the people to stay in this house praise the Lord I'm not just making noise praise the Lord young people don't just be satisfied coming to church get in the war see the things that are happening are we together he made priests of the lowest of the people he made priests of the lowest in a sense people that have by repetition of the lowest of the people marish and divorced two or three times I went together and he took those people and brought him right into the priests who I went together which were net of the sons of the Levi wish when addy never had no right to the priesthood amen I'm the reason why I'm saying this it's not to be personal I'm trying to show you the kind of a weight the evil that was done amen don't feel sorry for God because we can't help him are we together I'm just trying to show you the reason why God will bring a man the thing that consumed a larger to see people that don't have repetition smoking in there in a street corner running around with women but yell at the same people that come and make sacrifices goes for the thing that was consuming a larger he said I'm being jealous after the Lord God of Israel I've been just after the churn of Israel they had thrown down the altar no church or the no regard for God no respect it's all about just form formality praise Lord and if God if God has been gracious to be able to to open our eyes so any larger ministration we sit down and a lobbyist seems to creep back in ho young people living in the Asian day that we are in when you see the things that young people are doing you must be jealous for your Lord God you must be jealous for your Lord God now you're happy jealous that's the reason why I'm trying to make this thing so ugly I'm trying for the Holy Ghost to make you to see how ugly it was praise the Lord and don't think that you can you can just walk over the Word of God and get angry and say every Church is church I'm gonna find another church to go to you go there and then you find you'll find your God that you are worshiping like I've always said don't bring your God yet there is one goal we are worshiping yeah people say I just come to worship my god don't bring I hope it is the one that we are worshiping that's how ugly it was amen and Giroux Brahm ordained a feast in the eighth month okay that's how ugly it was that's how ugly this oh I'll wait to talk about amen first screen chapter 15 let's go quickly I have some few other things scriptures I want to read to you here but let's go quickly the time we'll be able to get my first stream chapter 15 verse 26 first Kings chapter 15 verse 26 praise the Lord verse 26 he was the next one the Bible says and now that the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of our king of Judah in hearing over Israel two years and he did evil in the sight of the Lord and walk in the way of his father and in his sin were in he may is racing and what was that sin cutting the people from the place of worship introducing the people to idolatry amen chapter 727 let's read the next verse the Bible talked about about the son of a Hodja or the house of a sacar conspire against him and and he smote him gibbet on which belong it to the Philistine for neither and all Israel lad siege there so he was the one that took over nether and what he went into conspiracy amen that was what he went into and then the next guy came on the scene was chapter 16 verse 8 I just I just want to see right from children seven kings amen and this was in Israel not in Judah because God was preserving Judah for his seventh David's sake amen the people have forsaken the Lord God he had left that the Temple of Solomon so that they have gone on their own as seven kings are we together verse eight and in the twenty and six years of our king of Judea begin Eli the son of Beijing to reign over Israel in tears of two years and right after that came as the first as a second tier the fourth and came the fifth King there's Zimmern in his seven similar captain of half of the chair conspired against him as so you can just see the rising to evil they are conspiring and games itself committing treason I mean you can just see evil just rolling over evil it's just rolling over evil that is a reason why a revelation 18:4 have to come on the scene come out of her my people because there's no way you can save that situation there is no way you can redeem it because it's just evil building on top of evil rolling over evil conspiring against evil killing evil that's the reason why there had to be a revelation 18:4 voice come out of her my people and being that partaker of her sin I will together chapter 25 verse 25 and 26 surah the same chapter over there we give us the net skin amen 25 and 26 we give us the nest king it's beautiful the Word of God is beautiful praise the Lord Amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God Oh may God increase our appetite for the world may God gave us a desire to be able to read his word to be able to love his word to be able to learn from his word verse 25 26 but Umrah rough evil in the eyes of the Lord and did worse than all that will be for him amen he did evil in the sight of the Lord and he did worse then the other five kings that would be for him are we together for he walks in a whale of jail bruh and in his scene worrying he made Israel to sing praise the Lord but drop down to verse 29 it brings a harp on the scene in the taralyn 80 years of us a king of Judah begin 1/2 the son of amram this one that did evil above all Kings let's see what his song we do are we together are we together summer I'm ready to reign over Israel here in over Israel and Samara two years and a half the summer the son of armour did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that way before him amen his father did worse than all that were before him he did above he went overboard are we together that is the reason why we must make use of the grace that has come to us because the Lord of God still lives is the word of God forever God visit the scene the iniquity of the parents so when we come to the Lord Jesus don't play with your new birth young people make sure you are born again make sure you have the Holy Ghost because that new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to destroy that curse don't play Church make sure you meet God make sure you know God praise the Lord and we have people we have many at I can stand with you he went overboard he did above I were together and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in a scene of Jubran you see when seen when we allow sin we allow sin in our life it starts to become our way of life then it does not condemn you anymore you don't feel check on it and then you can just but it is going to produce something worse than what you are in so the Bible says as if it was a lie thing you know that the worship of Jubran going to belter going to down worshiping all of this grow to a half these are little things these are little things I'm the king I mean as if it was a little thing as if it was a lie thing to walk in a sinner Jairam that he took the wife he talked to wife Jezebel he took to wife jezebel the daughter of L by the king of all the Xena nights and when and safe bill and worship him so he crowned it up he took Israel into a worse form of idolatry because what Jubran brought now see what he did he told the people this is your God that brought you out so his groves were representing Jehovah but for a half he took the people across the border and he brought in strange worship praise the Lord amen the church is getting so bored so we have to bring all these you know spiritual worship and all of these things and I mean and we just trying to make things happen we let's do something so we mean and that's just what he did as if it was a light thing he went and married the daughter of a false god worship brought right here into Israel praise the Lord and he read up an altar for bill in hustle bill which he built he came and built a very big mighty church and brought to God and I don't write the praise the Lord and we together now there is another thing in this scripture I don't know where we are with time but there is another thing in this structure that is so beautiful I was thinking about it last night as I was studying amen and and the Bible talks about 1/2 verse 33 and a half may groves and 1/2 did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that would be for him he did more to provoke but now right here the last verse the holy spirit put that verse in to also help us to see the kind of a time that was how the age the time the things that were happening and what did the scriptures say let's read it together the scripture says in in his days which mean in the day of oh yeah amen he'll the the bank might bail Jericho he laid a foundation thereof in a barren his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son so what what what the diverse means why is this verse here an age of defiance this verse reveal that the people have got so much to the level until they were ready to defy God Amen defy God by changing the agendas and changing in all the things that is the age of the spirit of the age how are they deferring God Joshua said in Joshua chapter 6 that Jericho was cursed and it will never be built an enemy that tried to do it he will have used a blot of his songs are we together he will have to use the blood of his sons Joshua chapter 6 verse 26 you can read that so that that is the age now are those were the things that were happening those were the things that were happening in these kings these kings were representing the leaders they were representing the political power they were and the whole thing was just mix praise the Lord if can I be able to find that this morning I'm reading there somewhere were brother branham cry out on it you know he talks about this nation is calm it's a seed things that we are doing amen that's the reason why we must be looking for a heavenly dream than an American dream are we together divine hill in 1954 if you have that with you dear Jose now I was seen at a very it's at a very cursory Jericho it's in the viola Jerusalem on the hill and a man like we read of the Good Samaritan never been talking about Good Samaritan yeah when he was coming down from Jericho gory I mean from Jerusalem going to Jericho he was back sledding coming out of the city of the bless and going down to the city of the curse and that's and that's when he fell among the thieves and God stripped and wounded in line have they're spiritually dead physically alive and and and and then this city was a curse City the world had dropped down once and and Joshua cursed the city and the person that we ever tried to build it again he cursed the city and he cursed the person that will ever try to build it again he said you will lay the foundation in the blood so it's not really that he took his son and and killed his son to build a city no they were devouring God that we would build this city he was a firing God that we were will raise the world of Jericho once again praise the Lord and why trying to do that it caused him the life of his son that is the kind of age see the scene that have been said horrible scene people defying God people going over the border with evil and wickedness in their heart praise the Lord they want to do all of that and then they say the church must be a loving Church you know it's a loving Church we must be able to accept people there is one person that is in control yet that is God amen then right after that our strip sure reading comes on the scene Elijah the Tishbite comes from behind the curtain of such such a darkness open the curtain and he stepped on the scene walking right to Ahab and said no rain not even do you or wash now God don't break his word God don't break his word let's stay together amen because God don't break his word the autonomy chapter 11 now you see we do these things you know just to be able to help you to see young people no matter what people are saying about the messaging I mean any have on the internet and all of the other thing about the Prophet there is a ministry that has been raised in our day if you don't see the condition of your age if you don't know the condition of your health you will not know how much you need a doctor if you don't know the condition of the age you will not know how much you need the message to get us out of here if you don't know your spiritual condition you would not know how much you need the Holy Ghost how would you get a verse 16 you know I was doing this this last night it took my mind way back to 1994 it took my mind way back to 1994 I like I used to like approaching preaching like this but I dropped teaching and started running after Devils I would together let's look at verse 16 they look at verse 16 but I'm trying to bring this just so we can be able to see some things here and when I was doing this I look at this scripture and what came to my mind was a larger reading Moses record and seeing that Moses is saying this very thing and what he says let me let's go back to verse 13 and it shall come to pass if ye if ye shiok him diligently unto my commandment we I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that I will give you the ring I will give you the ring of your length in his due season the first ring in the lettering that down may a gather that comes and I whine and are all and and and I was saying grinds in the field for your cuddles that there are myriad eat and before take heed take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceived and yet turn aside and serve other gods and worship them that was exactly what was happening they had turned and started worshipping other gods and then the Lord wrath be candid against you and he shot the heavens that there be no rain and that the lane year not fruits Elisha perish so who Elisha been looking at what Moses said and said God that is exact of what is happening I praise shut up the heavens this is what you said in your word this is the evil that is happening praise the Lord are we together I will to gather people I mean we are setting the scene that is the reason why it was important for God to bring a man like this on the scene it was important for God to bring a ministry but it did not happen it happened in the closet it happened with a young man reading the Word of God getting jealous for God getting passion on his heart praise the Lord another young man seeing his friend peers in their ears and going and taking funny thing and sticking it on his ear I'm not piercing my ear but I'm I'm guess it was a young man I was burning in his heart zillions for God and you know what he felt like he was alone and sometimes that is the way God have to put you in a situation it had to look like only you for him to really deal with you he don't give you no roommate amen he don't give you some other too lame or what I mean you know he makes you look like your situation is sooner you your own is horrible then he starts dealing with your heart then he's using that to draw you closer a young man that was looking at a situation friends no friends I'm going to stay with the Word of God let them call me whatever they were coming in school I'm going to stay with the Word of God praise the Lord it's not you feeling sorry for yourself but you feeling sorry for them because they don't know better but what the devil would do he use all of those things and put you to the place and now you feeling sorry for yourself when you're supposed to be proud that grace is on your side you're supposed to be proud that grace has preserved your life and young man if if Elijah was not reading the scripture if he was not reading these were the last words of Moses to the children of Israel if you keep my Commandments and we pour down the rain I will bless you well take it to yourself take him to yourself because God is obligated to his word now you take him to yourself if you disrespect the Word of God say I will shut up the heavens my goodness I believe you Elijah woke up from reading that word oh god oh god I didn't know worshipping false gods why are you still blessing us God shut up the heavens let them know that you us take God he woke up with such an assurance in his heart my goodness praising horror a sheepskin around him he never had congregation to escort him to the palace he was walking alone and just like John the Baptist aide to hero he says it is an abomination for you to be living with your brother's wife that was exactly what Elijah did right in the face of a hug you and your father house but I would tell you no ring or deal until I cooperate de Tirana me chapter xxxii let's take another verse there and see how serious this thing is like brother branham will say this is the background of Elijah this is the background of the Elijah ministry amen endlessly brain is the background of the Elijah ministry a zeal for God is the background of the Elijah ministry you can run for the mistress in Rome for all the seven see if you don't have the foundation you will crumble and we to get it praise the Lord these were the last words of Moses just like he said to Joshua take heed don't depart let not my word let not the world depart from out of your mouth so Elijah remember that and what he did he went back he said Moses instructed he instructed Joshua not to depart from the world and we together chapter 32 verse 2 let's read from verse 1 give ears or heaven and I will speak in here or if the words of my mouth my daughterís shall drop as the rain my speech sure distill as the deal I mean as the small rain is upon the tongue tenor hopes in as a shower upon the grass now so this verse shows the spiritual condition so a larger bringing judgment of Israel or saying they don't deserve the blessings of God because when God poured down rain just like we read he sees the former rain and the latter rain that was what Moses said but joy said the same thing in the book of Joel and then the New Testament church took it for a spiritual meaning so yeah God is saying my daughter in my principle that I gave to them to the church to my people it comes in a form of rain that's why we get our principal the formal rain in the latter rain amen the teaching rain he says a my speech it's like the deal and if you dis pass my word then you don't deserve the physical blessing praise the Lord amen a few other things they're tough I would have loved for us to look into and we don't have the time here this morning to look into it for Branham said is and all praise the Lord that's looking away looking away to Jesus this was now originally out of my notes for this morning was something I wanted to look at another time but Joe if he can look back there died just sin death and I just want to read that while we close this morning looking away to Jesus I just want to read there while we close I was subject this morning we pick it up from somewhere that the Lord gave us grace there's coming a time upon this nation to wear this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beasts had before a young man you'll stop making noise okay there's coming a time upon this nation to word this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beasts had before which was taken wrong when it became Papa room there this nation would do there revelation 13 cleanly explain it the lamb came up came up out of the earth there are other beasts came up out of the water thickness and mater to you you know because I was I was there was some things I was looking at and it's telling the lawn and there's just one of the thing I like to talk about as we go along with this I want to talk a little bit about rapture in faith we have heard over and over I was telling talking to brother Dan and talking about a Sunday School a little bit I will hope that pretty we will go into using more more of the tapes on the Sunday school there's a reason why I want to do that you know there's a reason why I want to do that is because we hear this statement rapture in faith is on the tapes the tapes were never goes aging men has always been girls aging amen but the reason did is because it's not that faith is on the tapes no but those things that are on the on the tapes are able to quick in faith that is in you are we together amen they are able to quit him now because we can we can get in all the technology where balances rapture and finish on the tips he never said on the cities amen he never said on the little chip he never said I'm sorry Phyllis is downloading your computer so the thing about it is not a tip is not the medium the thing that brings faith is when your soul is connected to that word when you are listening to the word and God say something and it quick is something to you are we together so I don't I don't I don't I don't want anybody can afford miss understanding me and thing that I'm fighting against tape I'm not fighting against tape either like even the thing for our young people we're going to going into our our I want to do tip questions listen to the tape tell me what you pick up from there because when that thing does not click it will never become interesting to you if that voice does not quicken something in you it will never be and I think it's our responsibility to encourage you whatever we can do to encourage you is our responsibility praise the Lord are we together so he's talking about all of these things and talking about I mean we're actually we are coming down to the things that are happening around us a lot of things happening in the world young people but we want to encourage you this morning want to encourage you bring it down to this he was a man of like passion but there was one thing that was in his heart he was earnest when he went to God in prayer he was earnest about the thing he said because there's I mean there is just I mean he's I mean he's the only person that because all the devil dealing with our life he's guessing but God is not guessing with our life there's nothing that we can hear from him the devil don't know the details of our life because it's placed under the blood so he's guessing he probably that's the reason why he tempt that's what tempting is all about but when it comes to the Creator when it comes to the God of heaven and earth we must be earnest amen we must be earnest and let the jealousy of God let's get so jealous for God like gets so jealous for God that's the thing that put Elijah in that situation praise the Lord musicians you can come this morning while we think on these things while we think on these things that are happening there just so many things here that I just I don't want to just carry you all over the place and then just just lose the emphasis of the holy spirit this morning and just want us to just stay right here but I wanted to for us to see the weight the way the thing that had brought us down to this to the church

his word he plays him right in that time right in the time of I mean he had going to this level of evil in his heart the people are defying God on every side and this one came on the scene and say I
