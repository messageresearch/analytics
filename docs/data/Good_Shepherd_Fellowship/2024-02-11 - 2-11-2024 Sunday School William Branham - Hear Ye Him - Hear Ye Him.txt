[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I just wonder a long time ago it was wrong for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man G the Bible said it's an abomination in the sight of God hallelujah you Methodist I want to fire one at you when John Smith preached his last sermon a sharp one 4 hours so old they packed him to the platform and he said oh I don't know what's going to happen even the daughters of the Methodist Church are wearing rings on their fingers what about now with a bathing suit on stretched out on a beach before a bunch of man that's you Methodist all right you Baptist a little prayer one time now and then and John Smith the founder of the Baptist Church pray until his eyes would swell shut and his wife would have to lead him to the table of the morning to feed him his breakfast shame on you Baptist and you Methodist that don't believe in Divine Healing when John Smith I stood for this Shrine not long ago one day he was riding his horse and it fell and broke its leg and he got off the horse and he took a bottle of AO from his pocket and anointed the harsh and rolled away on it you preached that in the Methodist Church they'll throw you out the door oh you did run well what hindered you standing out long go to a great Presbyterian man who was sitting by my side in some cult in California he said what do you think of that he didn't know me I said it's all right he said you know one time the Presbyterian Church was the Dominic Church on the west coast he said but then in come the Christian Science and just tore it to pieces and now here comes this man's tearing the Christian Science to pieces I said then if you would have given the children the bread of life they wouldn't know went after such stuff as that but hungry children will eat from a garbage can the world's hungry today for the word of the Living God oh you people what you need you pastors is feed your sheep right with the word of the Living God then he kept bringing word oh how your children does this how he must feel imagine you being a teacher and have to go to the very your maker and report on his own child the discipline but now what if the child was a good child what if the child was just about the father's business then how gracious the tutor was he'd come and say oh kind sir your child is at just a chip off the old block he's just like you he's just about your business oh you'll never never find a better businessman for your kingdom here than that child how the father must swell out oh that's my boy oh yes he's my son how that the holy spirit standing in the presence of God and says this man he is a real son he's about your business how do we say we about his business this is his program preach the word I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man to me how that he must feel great and feel happy then you know what happened if that son never did behave itself it never was no more than just an outcast bar that's right now I you know I'm a still a little bit of calvinist but I I believe if you're born to a child of God you could be a disobedient child and you'll Rel lose all your reward and you'll never be no more than just an ordinary Baptist Pentecostal Nazarene or whatever you are but if you'll be up and doing if you'll be obedient and a real child now the Lutheran when you first found out the just shall live by faith you made a Doctrine out of it it's right and you Methodist as soon as John Wesley come along the pillar of fire as it moved they built under it and when John Wesley come along you discovered the new birth or what they call sanctification the second definite work of Grace that was all right so was justification right but as soon as you found out sanctification you draw a little line all your leaders did after the death of Wesley and ASB and so forth and then you made a Doctrine out of it and you draw a border line God just moved the pillar far right out the Pentecostal founded the restoration of the gifts they begin to speak in tongues you made a Doctrine out of it and you put your period down now the holy spirit's moving right on off and leaving you that's right oh brother when you isolate yourself from the rest of the Believers God will move away you've got to love one another this will all men know that you're are my disciples when you have love one for the other when the Methodist and the Baptist and the L Luther and the Pentecostal can stand arm in arm and March forward you'll see one of the mightiest outpourings of the spirit of God that you ever seen the devil don't care as long as we're shooting at one another oh go ahead you just fight kill yourselves but let us unite in one big front watch what happens then watch what goes on now if this boy was a correct boy and he was obedient and he was industrious and he he liked to do the things of father had left for him to do then the tutor come and said oh he's a great boy then on a certain day when the boy become of age which the church ought to have been a long time ago this boy was brought out into a public place and had a ro placed on a beautiful Road and all the roundabout was called in now listen Clos and closing and all the people was gathered in at the front of the gate usually taking place place he went up to the front of the Gate of the city and there he set his boy up on a high place and he put him on a robe and you preachers here I'm talking of the placing of a son you know in the Bible now in Galatians or Ephesians 1:5 for God has predestinated us unto the adoption or the placing of sons by Jesus Christ now he was a son to begin with but now he's so obedient let him be whatever denomination that has nothing to do with it it's obedience to the word obedience to God and then he was placed on this High seat and there was a great celebration and the father adopted his own son that had been in his family all these years had adopted him into his family in other words he had placed him give him his position in the family and then after that the boy's name was just as good on a check as his daddy's was for he was positionally placed now my Pentecostal Brethren Baptist Methodist and Presbyterian whatever you are do you see where we're sharp today do you see we are fussing so much about our denomination about our presage and about our societies God can't do nothing with us we're children but oh May the day hasten when we can be set out before the public and robed in the power of his righteousness that our words our prayers will heal the sick and our preaching will save the lost and the great signs and wonders of the Bible will be restored back to the church again when we break down our little petty Je juvenile differences that's when God will do this notice he was positionally placed and then he become a full-fledged son then his name is good then that's the way with the church if we could get away from our little differences and come to Christ and forget about the outside world or forget about our denominations and so forth and be obedient children and be about the father's business to get Soul SA sa and to do the things of God after a while God will set us to one side and he'll anoint us with the Holy Ghost and then we're positionally placed in his kingdom some has the gifts of wisdom some has knowledge some has Gifts of tongues some preaches the gospel some are prophets and other gifts but now God is moving the gifts in the church I might as well say it as some on my heart see I don't want to hurt you brother I don't want to hurt you sister but the Pentecostal church and you Full Gospel people these gifts you don't know how to control them there are gifts here all right but you're going wild with them put them in their place look the first gift is wisdom what good it go to do you to have knowledge if you don't know have wisdom to know how to control your knowledge what good does it do you to speak with tongues if you don't have Wis is them to know when how and to place it right see what I mean what good does it do to preach Divine Healing when it just goes to pieces you don't know what I've said I met two classes of people in my life and that is the fundamental and the Pentecostal the fundamental positionally knows what they are but they haven't got any faith the word's never took root yet it's never come to life but positionally they know where they are the Pentecostals got the faith but they don't know who they are it's just like a man's got money in a bank don't know how to write a check and the other can write a check and ain't got no money in the bank if you could ever get those together oh God give us either a spiritual fundamental church or a fundamental Pentecostal Church you got lots of faith but you just don't know how to place it it just runs wide that way it brings more reproach and it does good place it in the Bible this is the blueprint not what people want but what God wants line up with his program that's what's the difference that's why we're not going on the way we should be friends now while they were standing there notice that when in the presence of God now in the Old Testament God never did ask man to do anything L he' do it himself when man was sentenced to death to Die the only way God could redeem him has come down in flesh and take his place that's the reason I preached the way I did last night Christ is more than a man he's God he had to come down and be clothed in flesh in order to taste in he couldn't send another individual he wouldn't be just in doing so he had to come himself and he overshadowed the Virgin and created a blood sell it brought forth the Sun and God dwelt in the sun tabernacled here on Earth he was Emmanuel not a prophet but God With Us God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself it's the only way he could test taste sin and death was to be made Marty like man the kinsman redeemer of Ruth that I preached on so much across the as you probably read the sermons oh he had to be a Kinsman to be a redeemer and the only way that God could ever be a redeemer he had become kin folks to us and he become flesh and dwelt Among Us he are kin folks he was a flesh man like I am like you are but God dwelt in him to suffer and feel taste his in five senses like we are he become a redeemer then when was standing there on Mount Transfiguration God was showing to the world what he had asked man to do back there under the adoption or placing of sons Peter got all excited usually men do when they're in the presence of Supernatural usually they can control themselves because they're creatures of the earth and yet they're creatures of Heaven too but that for taste just runs them wild that's what's happened to the Pentecostal Church see that for T you don't know how to control yourself you get all out of reason you don't know how to place those gifts of tongues those interpretations while the preacher is speaking sometimes you raise your up and speak right while the preacher is speaking that's contrary to the Bible and you say oh God gave a message of this it's fresher than the Bible no it's not that your words will fail and everything else will fail but the Bible said if there be any spiritual or profit among you let him acknowledge what I write is the Commandments of God and if an angel from heaven would preach any other gospel in that which has been preached let him be a cursed you see what I mean so if you try to shake hands with pre people to get them into the kingdom of God you're wrong they're bned in the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost they're not baptized Face Forward backward sprinkled forward in one name or the other they are barned of the spirit of God into the kingdom of God Peter was excited he said Lord let's build three Tabernacles we'll build one for Moses and all wants to keep the law Moses represented the law all that wants to keep the law the Commandments and don't eat meat and so forth let them do [Music] [Music] that [Music]
