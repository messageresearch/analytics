[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] behold today cometh that shall burn as
[0:05] an oven
[0:06] and all the proud yay all that do wickly
[0:09] shall
[0:10] be as stubbles now this is not that's
[0:12] malcolm 3 was the first coming now
[0:15] here's the next coming even the dr
[0:17] scofield here i certainly don't agree
[0:19] with him in these footnotes but he's got
[0:21] it lined out here right
[0:22] the commission of john the malachi 3 and
[0:25] the
[0:26] second coming of christ and elijah
[0:29] before hands
[0:32] all the proud shall burn up saith the
[0:34] lord of hosts
[0:35] and it shall leave them neither root
[0:38] nor branch where's the eternal hell in
[0:44] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[0:47] son of righteousness rise
[0:50] with healing campaigns healing in his
[0:53] wings
[0:54] you shall go forth and grow up as calves
[0:56] of the stall
[0:58] and you shall tread down the wicked they
[1:00] shall be ashes
[1:01] under the soles of your feet in that day
[1:03] that i shall do this saith the lord of
[1:05] hosts
[1:06] remember the law of moses my servant
[1:08] which i commanded him in horeb
[1:10] for all israel the statues and judgment
[1:12] here's the coming of elijah behold i
[1:15] will
[1:15] send to you elijah the prophet
[1:18] the last closing scripture of the old
[1:21] testament
[1:24] i'll send to you elijah the prophet
[1:27] before the coming of that great and
[1:29] dreadful day of the lord
[1:31] now that couldn't have been john
[1:34] no see the world wasn't burned up the
[1:37] righteous walked out on the wicked
[1:39] no no before the great and dreadful day
[1:41] of the lord
[1:43] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:44] fathers to the children
[1:46] and the hearts of the children to the
[1:48] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:49] with a curse
[1:51] notice the accuracy of the holy spirit
[1:54] that it would not confuse them two
[1:56] comings of elijah
[1:58] malachi 3 said behold i send my
[2:01] messenger before my face
[2:03] jesus asked about john he said if you
[2:05] can receive it this is who the prophet
[2:07] said i'll say
[2:08] my messenger before my face this is the
[2:10] elias that was to come
[2:12] malachi 3 notice the scripture so
[2:14] accurately gives it watch what this
[2:16] to show the thumb who wants to believe
[2:18] them who wants to see
[2:21] remember jesus stopped in the middle of
[2:22] a scripture
[2:24] because part of it was fulfilled and to
[2:25] rest for his second coming
[2:27] to preach the acceptable year of the
[2:29] lord bind up the brokenhearted and stop
[2:32] not bring judgment to the gentiles until
[2:34] his second coming
[2:36] notice this scripture here parallels
[2:38] that
[2:39] and he elijah shall turn the hearts of
[2:42] the fathers to the children
[2:44] now speaking of malachi 4 and i'll get
[2:46] it mixed from al qaeda 3
[2:49] john elijah who came in the days before
[2:52] the first coming of christ
[2:54] turned the hearts of the old patriarch
[2:57] fathers
[2:58] to the message of the children the new
[3:00] message
[3:01] now watch and the hearts of the children
[3:04] to the fathers
[3:05] in his second coming in the last days he
[3:08] turns back to the apostolic faith again
[3:11] amen see how perfect the scriptures line
[3:13] up
[3:15] that was the end of the old testament
[3:18] the old testament now
[3:21] we see there's light in the evening time
[3:24] what is it
[3:25] it's the top mount treetop
[3:29] as i said this morning we've come up
[3:32] through denominations
[3:33] through not an orange tree like uh spoke
[3:37] of this morning
[3:39] but we've had grapefruit lemons all
[3:42] kinds of other
[3:43] things that wasn't like the beginning at
[3:45] all but after
[3:48] don't miss it here it comes
[3:51] after all the denominations is played
[3:55] out
[3:56] they didn't have any light you begin
[3:58] with there'll be a day that can't be
[4:00] called day or night
[4:03] what are they doing what are they doing
[4:06] what does a a lemon do on an orange tree
[4:09] it takes the original life of the arms
[4:11] that's coming up
[4:12] and perverts it
[4:17] through a lemon that's what the
[4:20] denomination
[4:20] has done to the word of god made the
[4:24] word of god of no effect by their
[4:26] traditions
[4:28] that's thus saith the spirit of the lord
[4:34] they have brought forth lemons
[4:38] grapefruits not oranges but what did the
[4:41] prophet say
[4:43] the same one that said for our text
[4:44] tonight rejoice
[4:46] old daughters of jerusalem shout loud
[4:49] daughters of zion are your kings coming
[4:53] to you
[4:54] meek and lowly setting up on the fall of
[4:56] an ass
[4:58] notice that same prophet said there will
[5:02] come a time of the ripening of the sun
[5:04] set up on the earth
[5:05] to ripen the fruit why couldn't it ripen
[5:08] there's no fruit there to ripen
[5:10] but the life is still traveling on it
[5:13] come up to a grapefruit to be an orange
[5:15] found out it organized it was a
[5:17] grapefruit
[5:18] it went again it come out that time of
[5:21] lemon
[5:22] but on again it turned out to something
[5:24] else and in the last top of the tree
[5:26] it's turned out to a
[5:28] tangelo which is half orange
[5:34] half lemon a mixed breed
[5:37] a perverted thing come on to a
[5:40] perversion
[5:41] living off that same tree the shock
[5:45] almost deceived the elect it looks like
[5:47] an orange but it ain't
[5:50] but it shall be life
[5:53] when she grows beyond organization
[5:56] when she gets out of pass organization
[5:59] it blooms out again
[6:00] she'll put forth oranges like she was
[6:03] when she went into the ground
[6:06] and then it shall be light
[6:10] what's this attraction what's this
[6:13] happening
[6:15] fulfilling god's word
[6:21] there's two witnesses of the old
[6:23] testament that this would happen
[6:25] let's take john 14 12 of the new
[6:29] testament
[6:30] jesus said he that believeth on me the
[6:33] works that i do shall he do also
[6:36] also in luke 17 22 to 30
[6:40] he said as it was in the days of lot
[6:43] for sodom has burned so shall it be at
[6:46] the return
[6:48] of the son of man that day when the son
[6:51] of man is being revealed
[6:56] oh just look at the scriptures
[6:59] the son of man jesus christ the same
[7:03] yesterday
[7:04] forever grow to pass denominations
[7:08] throw it into the top of the tree what
[7:11] did he say in john 14
[7:12] or 15 every bridge
[7:16] that's in me that doesn't bring forth
[7:18] the fruit
[7:19] it'll be cut off and pruned thrown into
[7:22] the fire and burn
[7:25] whatever branch that'll bring forth
[7:27] fruit it'll be
[7:28] purged oh there will be a true former
[7:32] and latter reign
[7:35] in the last days upon that little group
[7:38] that come with him on this little
[7:40] donkey low and humble no doubt or
[7:42] denomination crying
[7:44] hold santa to the king that comes in the
[7:47] name of the lord
[7:52] what's the matter today what's the
[7:54] attraction on the mount
[7:56] not long ago standing this pulpit
[8:00] it was said by the holy spirit the day
[8:03] will come
[8:04] that when they'll drive down a stake in
[8:06] front of your house
[8:08] they'll move your gate thought you'll
[8:11] bypass it
[8:13] not be angry i seen my gate tore up
[8:16] laying out upon the
[8:17] hill sign i seen the hill in front of me
[8:20] all
[8:20] dug up boards and things laying there
[8:23] worse somebody mashed it up
[8:25] he said i looked and there was a little
[8:27] ricky
[8:28] that had got up there and knocked that
[8:30] gate out done this i said why didn't you
[8:32] tell me
[8:33] you got smart with me
[8:37] and i had to hit him and when it did
[8:40] i said i haven't done this since i was
[8:42] in the ring but i just want you to know
[8:44] and i swatted him on and when i knocked
[8:48] him down i picked him up again knocked
[8:49] him down again
[8:50] i picked it up three or four times and
[8:52] kicked him over the hill so then i went
[8:54] over there and i said that ain't right i
[8:55] picked him up and shook his hands i said
[8:57] i'm not angry with you
[8:58] but i just want you to know you can't
[9:01] talk to me like that
[9:03] and then when i turned and come back the
[9:05] holy spirit was standing at the gate
[9:07] said now bypass this when that stakes

[20:04] shall be revealed and there shall rise
[20:07] false prophets and
[20:08] false christ show great signs and
[20:11] monitors insomuch to deceive the elected

[21:05] as puzzled at that supernatural halo

[21:14] that's boring king of the jews what was
[21:16] it

[22:03] much longer than i intended
[22:07] i pray god that something was said or
[22:09] done
[22:10] that will cause people out everywhere
[22:14] to understand and by seeing and
[22:17] understanding they might believe that
[22:19] god the true christ
[22:21] and the words that's being confirmed is
[22:23] a confirmation
[22:25] of his word being perfect and being
[22:27] fulfilled
[22:28] in its season now lord jesus
[22:32] from your own words you said
[22:36] that the world would be in a sodom
[22:37] condition
[22:39] we know that we can look at it and you
[22:41] said in that day
[22:43] as it was in sodom there was three
[22:46] messengers
[22:47] sent to the gentile and hebrew world
[22:52] and one of them which was god himself
[22:55] the son of man
[22:56] revealed himself in a human form and
[22:59] performed a miracle insomuch that told
[23:01] abraham
[23:02] what sarah was doing behind him in the
[23:04] tent
[23:05] you said it would repeat again when the
[23:08] whole gentile world would be in a sodom
[23:10] condition
[23:11] and we're here lord other prophecies
[23:15] confirming the same thing
[23:16] of sending elijah in the last days the
[23:19] spirit of elijah upon the earth
[23:22] to bring the hearts of the fathers or
[23:25] the children back to the fathers
[23:27] now pray god at this hour that you will
[23:30] confirm your word
[23:32] that you are the same yesterday today
[23:36] and forever
[23:40] granted father they are all yours
[23:44] i pray that you'll grant these blessings
[23:46] and confirm what's been said
[23:48] for the glory of god in the name of
[23:50] jesus christ
[23:52] amen
[23:58] just speak a word
[24:01] as a man confirm a word
[24:04] is god
[24:08] to say something is one thing
[24:11] god to do it is another thing
[24:15] god don't need any interpreter he does
[24:18] his own interpretation
[24:20] now we're fixing to have a prayer line
[24:22] to pray for the sacred
[24:24] god willing and we know
[24:29] that there's no one no man no woman
[24:32] no human being no angel
[24:35] that can heal you for god has already
[24:38] did it
[24:39] he made the preparation the only thing
[24:42] you have to do is receive it
[24:44] there's no man no angel no nothing
[24:48] not even god himself can forgive you for
[24:51] your
[24:52] sins it's already done
[24:56] jesus did that the cross but he'll never
[24:59] prosper you
[24:59] anything or profit you anything until
[25:01] you accept it
[25:03] the only thing can be done is orders
[25:06] that's been given by god
[25:08] for believers to lay hands on the sick
[25:11] that's been through the ages they've
[25:12] done that through revivals
[25:14] and they've called it god abraham's seen
[25:17] many signs
[25:19] but there come a time when abraham saw
[25:22] his last sign
[25:23] just before sodom was burned that was
[25:27] god manifesting himself
[25:30] in the form of a man you believe that
[25:34] did jesus say it would repeat now how
[25:38] many in here
[25:40] and out in radio or i don't have
[25:42] telephones across the nation
[25:44] if you're still listening in get ready
[25:46] now
[25:48] for prayer be free
[25:52] you just got these handkerchiefs here
[25:55] now
[25:56] i cannot tell god what to do
[25:59] no far be it from even trying it he's
[26:02] sovereign he does what he wants to
[26:05] i can only obey and i only can say what
[26:08] he says
[26:10] and now they're standing around the
[26:13] walls they're
[26:13] packed in as congested i wonder
[26:17] if we could ask god on these words
[26:20] what is this attraction
[26:24] if god would move among us again there
[26:26] may be strangers here
[26:28] and move among us and show his blessed
[26:31] face among us
[26:32] show his spirits here show that he's the
[26:36] same yesterday today and forever
[26:38] but every one of us after these two
[26:41] strong messages
[26:42] could believe it to be sold could you do
[26:44] it
[26:46] all right instead of calling
[26:50] a prayer line then hot
[26:53] congested standing against wall i look
[26:55] around this way to call them a prayer
[26:56] line you couldn't do it let's stand in
[26:58] there
[26:58] could i call it this way you're sick
[27:00] cots everything else laying you couldn't
[27:02] do it
[27:03] so set where you are
[27:06] and believe god
[27:12] if you do have a prayer card hold it
[27:15] it'll be good
[27:18] we'll get to you if you want to come to
[27:19] a line
[27:21] but you don't have to come to a line
[27:24] that mr shepherd last sunday night never
[27:26] come through no line
[27:28] i don't i don't guess he had a prayer
[27:30] card is mr shepherd here tonight
[27:32] or is he is he here he's in the bank
[27:35] do you have a prayer card mr shepherd
[27:37] you didn't you didn't he's sitting right
[27:39] there again tonight
[27:42] that's a good place to be brother
[27:43] shepard not only have to be there
[27:45] but just have faith but remember
[27:49] a little woman touched his garment
[27:52] and he felt it and he's the same
[27:55] yesterday and forever
[27:57] and the hebrew letter in the new
[27:59] testament
[28:00] said that he's a high priest tonight
[28:03] that can be touched by the feeling of
[28:04] your infirmities
[28:05] you believe that have faith in
[28:09] don't doubt it believe it and it'll come
[28:12] to pass
[28:13] you could have what you what you've
[28:14] asked for if
[28:16] you can believe it but you've got to
[28:18] believe it will you do it
[28:20] well all of you believe it how many will
[28:22] believe it now
[28:24] god bless you i don't know who's who
[28:28] i don't know none of you it's not my
[28:30] business to know
[28:31] any of you it's god's business and all
[28:33] these things
[28:36] but he will do it if you'll believe it
[28:38] will you believe it now
[28:40] now dear god
[28:43] surely we're not a bunch of hybrid
[28:46] christians
[28:47] we shouldn't be somebody has to be
[28:49] petted and babied
[28:51] you don't have that kind lord you have
[28:54] rugged believers
[28:56] the very presence of god sets a man's
[28:59] heart on fire
[29:01] like abraham
[29:04] he believed god you made yourself known
[29:08] to him then you appeared to him and
[29:10] performed a sign
[29:12] and he believed you you turned his body
[29:16] back to a young man and also his wife
[29:18] which his wife was part of his own body
[29:21] then come forth the new child
[29:22] the promised son god you promised
[29:26] that it'd be the same thing in this day
[29:29] i pray that you'll confirm this word
[29:32] and we'll deal right on that one promise
[29:34] there that it will be like it was in
[29:36] sodom
[29:38] just before sodom was burnt and judgment
[29:40] struck sodom the gentile world
[29:43] so judgment is fixed and strength
[29:46] the gentile world and the jews got three
[29:49] and a half more years
[29:50] through the period of tribulation
[29:53] jacob's trouble
[29:55] the continuing of the 70 weeks of daniel
[29:57] but the gentiles
[29:59] are numbered it's time to go
[30:02] and you'll give that sign and you said
[30:04] it would be again
[30:06] granted god there we're in your hands do
[30:09] with us as you see fit
[30:12] in jesus christ's name amen
[30:22] [Music]
[30:49] you
