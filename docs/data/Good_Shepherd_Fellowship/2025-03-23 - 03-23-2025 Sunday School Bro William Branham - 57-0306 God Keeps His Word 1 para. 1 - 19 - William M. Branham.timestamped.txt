[0:01] [Music]
[2:19] Let us bow our heads to Almighty God and
[2:23] offer to him a word of prayer. Shall we
[2:27] pray? Our kind heavenly father, we thank
[2:32] thee tonight for the love of the Lord
[2:35] Jesus and for being with us to this
[2:38] another day.
[2:40] and has by thy grace permitted us to
[2:43] assemble here together
[2:45] tonight. And thou has promised that
[2:48] wherever two or more are gathered in my
[2:50] name, I'll be in their midst. And we
[2:54] know that thou art here because you have
[2:57] promised them. And we pray that you'll
[3:00] bless us tonight, your presence being
[3:03] here. May we all recognize it. And may
[3:06] the Holy Spirit take the word of God and
[3:09] give it to every heart just as we have
[3:11] need. Save sinners, heal the sick and
[3:15] afflicted, call the backsliders back to
[3:18] the home of grace. Grant these blessings
[3:22] we ask in Christ's name. Amen.
[3:39] As the nights grow on and the meeting
[3:42] begins to come towards the last of
[3:45] it of this present
[3:49] meeting, I am trusting to God that many
[3:54] things will be done for his glory.
[3:59] I am horse in my throat. Not from a bad
[4:03] cold, but just too much
[4:06] speaking. This is about four months
[4:09] straight with hardly a night
[4:11] off. So you can imagine what a great
[4:14] terrible strain it is from the frozen
[4:18] regions until the tropical
[4:21] jungles. And there's no let up yet. I've
[4:25] got go from here immediately leaving
[4:28] Monday morning and I've got to be at La
[4:31] Christian at 1:00 Monday after leaving
[4:34] here and then on up into California to
[4:38] open back into Kansas dedicating a
[4:40] church the mayor up into Canada around
[4:43] through Canada and then if the Lord so
[4:47] permit immediately after the Chicago
[4:50] Christian Business Van Convention a
[4:53] complete worldwide tour all the way
[4:57] around.
[4:59] So I need prayer and need it very bad.
[5:04] So you pray for
[5:06] me now
[5:08] tonight as we open this blessed word of
[5:13] God. I just love to read of the word.
[5:16] Don't you like the
[5:21] word faith cometh by hearing? Hearing
[5:24] the word of
[5:26] God. We can rest so assured on God's
[5:30] word because it's eternally right. It's
[5:35] forever the truth.
[5:38] And with the help of the Holy Spirit, I
[5:41] would like to read for a text praying
[5:44] that he will give us the context out of
[5:47] Numbers the 13th chapter and the 30th
[5:51] verse. And Caleb still the people before
[5:56] Moses and said, "Let us go up at once
[6:00] and possess it, for we are able to
[6:04] overcome it.
[6:08] just as a scripture
[6:10] reading. And now I trust that God will
[6:15] help us as we go into this. And now
[6:18] tonight, if it would be so for the next
[6:21] two or three
[6:23] nights, I'd like to teach on the subject
[6:27] this God keeps his word.
[6:33] When I was first
[6:35] converted and was ordained in the
[6:38] Baptist
[6:39] church, I had a good old teacher by the
[6:42] name of Dr. Roy
[6:45] Davis. He was a lawyer before his
[6:49] conversion. And he talked everything
[6:52] from a legal standpoint in the
[6:54] Bible. And when I remember my first
[6:57] sermon I preached, I preached on
[7:01] Samson, a grinding for the enemy. Well,
[7:05] I went over and had my own hands tied to
[7:08] the post and oh, I went through every
[7:11] emotion that I guess that I felt the
[7:14] preacher could go
[7:16] through. And when I noticed old Dr.
[7:19] Davis sitting there with his finger up
[7:21] to his mouth just watching
[7:23] me. And after the service was over, I'd
[7:27] made my altar call. A lot of the old
[7:30] mothers is walking up, patting me on the
[7:33] shoulder. Oh, they said, "Billy, that
[7:35] was
[7:36] wonderful." And Dr. Davis said, "I want
[7:39] to see you in a study." I said, "Yes,
[7:43] sir." He said, "That was just about as
[7:46] ridiculous as I ever heard in my life."
[7:50] Oh, it really took the sales off of
[7:54] me. So I said, "Well, what's the matter,
[7:57] Dr. David?"
[7:59] He said one time when I was practicing
[8:03] law said I went out and I heard a few
[8:05] cases
[8:07] tried and said when I heard the cases I
[8:10] watched the emotions the attorneys went
[8:14] through and said when I tried my first
[8:17] case after I was sworn to the
[8:19] bench. He said, "I took off my coat and
[8:23] it was a lady I was
[8:25] defending and said, I pounded on the
[8:29] desk. I cried. I walked back and forth
[8:33] and said, I thought I had the case
[8:34] whipped. That's all there was to it."
[8:36] and said the old judge sat there and
[8:38] after a while he wrapped on the dim
[8:40] bench and said judge your honor how much
[8:44] more can this ridiculous thing can your
[8:48] court
[8:50] stand well said then I felt I felt like
[8:54] I was just whipped so I walked out
[8:57] defeated said I went out home said well
[9:00] I'll study something else I'll never
[9:02] make a lawyer said after somebody
[9:05] knocked on the door and who was said
[9:07] what said the old
[9:09] attorney and he come down he said
[9:12] Roy I was watching
[9:15] you and he said you know this court said
[9:18] I reason I did that I want you to be a
[9:21] real lawyer said I know it's in you to
[9:24] be a lawyer but this court doesn't make
[9:27] its decisions upon your mental
[9:31] emotions you had a lot of mental emotion
[9:34] but you had no law in
[9:38] defense. And he said, "That's the reason
[9:40] I said
[9:41] that." And I think that's a very good
[9:45] thing. I said, "Dr. Davis, I thank you."
[9:48] He said, "Billy, all of your emotions
[9:52] and going on and tying Samson to the
[9:55] post and with him and putting his eyes
[9:57] out, you didn't get very much scripture.
[10:00] Men are not saved by emotions and all
[10:03] the little sad stories you tell. Man
[10:06] saved by the word of
[10:11] God. That certainly fixed me up. Since
[10:15] then, I've decided this that God doesn't
[10:19] judge us upon our emotions or upon our
[10:22] affiliations with church, but he judges
[10:26] us by his word.
[10:30] Heavens and earth shall pass away, but
[10:33] God's word shall never pass away. Amen.
[10:38] Now, in the day that we're
[10:42] living and the times that we're living
[10:46] in, I think it behooves us to check up
[10:50] with the word of
[10:53] God
[10:55] and see where we're living in the hour
[10:57] we're living.
[11:01] Now, God spoke of this day, and this day
[11:06] is one of the most outstanding
[11:10] days that the world has ever
[11:13] seen. It is one of the greatest times to
[11:16] preach the gospel that the world has
[11:18] ever
[11:19] known. Now, in the Old
[11:23] Testament, there was about three ways of
[11:27] knowing the will of God. Of course, one
[11:31] of them was a written
[11:32] law. The next was by a prophet, the next
[11:37] was by a
[11:38] dreamer. And when a prophet
[11:41] prophesied or dreamer
[11:44] dreamed, they let that speak before the
[11:48] urine
[11:49] thunder. That was the breastplate that
[11:52] was on Aaron's breast. And in there were
[11:56] stones that represented each tribe.
[12:00] And if that prophet was
[12:03] right or that dreamer was right, there
[12:08] come a sacred light over that
[12:11] breastplate and was called urum thunder.
[12:16] And no matter how real it
[12:19] seemed, I want you to get it.
[12:23] No matter how real it
[12:26] seemed, if those lights didn't flash on
[12:30] the urum thundum, God had refused the
[12:33] message.
[12:35] Any Bible scholar knows
[12:37] that the urum thund has been done away
[12:40] with because that priesthood
[12:43] ended. But God's urum thunder today is
[12:46] God's
[12:48] word. The word is his ur thunder. Woe
[12:52] unto him that'll add or take away
[12:55] anything from this
[12:57] book. This is God's eternal truth. And
[13:01] in the day where there's people saying,
[13:04] "Oh, we don't need the Bible. It's been
[13:07] translated 15 times or more, how do we
[13:10] know it's right?" Till the heavens and
[13:12] earth pass away, God's word will never
[13:14] pass away.
[13:16] Every doctrine and everything else of
[13:19] the Bible that we have in the church
[13:21] must be based upon the word of God.
[13:25] Must come from the word. Not just one
[13:29] place, but from Genesis to Revelation,
[13:33] it must say the same
[13:35] thing. Because we cannot base our
[13:38] thoughts upon one little scripture.
[13:42] For the Bible said in the mouth of two
[13:44] or three witnesses, let every word be
[13:47] established. You could take one
[13:49] scripture, fix it around, I can say in
[13:52] the scripture, Judas hung himself. You
[13:55] go do
[13:56] likewise. But that wouldn't be rightly
[13:59] dividing the
[14:00] scripture. See, that was pertaining to
[14:04] Judas and not to
[14:06] you. And now we're starting tonight on
[14:10] two or three nights if the Lord permits
[14:13] on God keeps his
[14:16] word. He's got to keep his word. And in
[14:19] order to be God, he has to stand behind
[14:22] everything he said in his word. And
[14:25] that's exactly where my faith rests is
[14:28] upon the spoken word of God.
[14:32] Now, our text starts off tonight with
[14:35] the covenant people way down in
[14:41] Egypt. Yet, they were in there waiting
[14:45] on the word of
[14:47] God which had been spoken by to Abraham
[14:52] that there his seed would sojourn in
[14:55] this strange land for 400 years.
[15:00] But in such a long
[15:03] wait, the people had got away from the
[15:07] real meaning and wasn't looking for the
[15:10] day to
[15:12] come. And another thing we could say,
[15:15] they wasn't looking for it in the way
[15:18] that it did
[15:20] come. And that's what's the matter with
[15:23] us today.
[15:25] We've got our mind set up on the way
[15:28] God's got to do things just the way we
[15:30] think he's going to do it. And usually
[15:33] we're wrong.
[15:36] God promise he would deliver them. And
[15:40] when a little baby boy was born down
[15:43] there in a poor peasant home, little
[15:48] could they ever think that that was the
[15:50] emancipator of Egypt or of Israel. But
[15:54] it
[15:55] was. And when the time come for them to
[15:59] be
[16:00] delivered, Israel failed to recognize
[16:04] their
[16:06] leader to bring them out. What did it
[16:10] take? It taken 40 years
[16:15] more before God could ever get the
[16:18] church in condition to take it out.
[16:23] Now, I believe
[16:25] this. I could be wrong. I'm just a man
[16:28] as you are. But I believe the coming of
[16:32] the Lord is past due.
[16:37] I believe the reason that God can't come
[16:40] is on the condition of his church. Amen.
[16:44] It's all separated and broke up and
[16:49] everything that could be thought of is
[16:51] mixed into it. It's got to come a time
[16:55] for an oldfashioned shaking down,
[16:58] settling
[16:59] down for the church of
[17:03] God. Now, as we see this day, that was a
[17:08] perfect tight thing of this today. First
[17:12] thing they had, they had the ark, a
[17:17] prophet, an angel, the word, their
[17:21] prophet, their angel, a sacred life that
[17:25] followed them.
[17:27] And as they came out of Egypt after
[17:33] Moses finally God taken 40 years to
[17:36] bring them into condition and they were
[17:39] 40 years
[17:42] past because of their differences and
[17:47] not
[17:48] recognizing. The Bible said that in the
[17:52] days of Noah God was longsuffering.
[17:56] He wasn't willing that any should
[17:59] perish.
[18:01] And he says, "As it was in the days of
[18:03] Noah, so will it be in the coming of the
[18:06] son of man."
[18:09] I believe the coming of the Lord is
[18:12] passed due.
[18:13] Then for he had to wait long in Noah's
[18:18] time. He had to wait long in bringing
[18:21] out Israel. I believe he's waiting
[18:25] long, but I believe his patience is
[18:29] getting thin with us.
[18:33] I just met Brother Hooper a few moments
[18:36] ago. First time I've seen him for a long
[18:39] time. Said, "Brother Brandham, I want
[18:41] just a minute or two with you before you
[18:43] leave
[18:43] Arizona for this may be our last time
[18:47] seeing each other.
[18:50] It seems like there's a great checking
[18:52] up time
[18:55] somewhere. As I think of
[18:58] it now, after 40 years, finally God got
[19:03] them together and they
[19:05] recognized this prophet Moses who went
[19:08] down there with the
[19:10] word and on their road out coming out of
[19:14] Egypt following
[19:17] God. And they they came to a place
[19:19] looked like a halt or a
[19:23] standstill. And after they had done seen
[19:26] the glory of God down in Egypt with
[19:29] signs and wonders that God had did, when
[19:33] they seen the pressing time
[19:36] come, when the Red Sea had them cut off,
[19:39] the deserts had them cut off, and
[19:42] Pharaoh's
[19:43] army just behind
[19:46] them. Oh, what an hour.
[19:51] But God seems to take
[19:53] pleasure in getting his children in such
[19:56] a
[19:58] position. It's strange how God leads his
[20:02] children. As a poet used to say, some
[20:06] through the waters, some through the
[20:09] floods, some through deep trials, but
[20:13] all through the blood.
[20:16] God has the way leading his
[20:19] children. So odd and
[20:23] peculiar. And how strange that newborn
[20:28] baby come up out of this great
[20:32] wilderness of sin and was led right up
[20:36] here and cut
[20:38] off. Why? Seemingly all nature mourned
[20:42] for that.
[20:45] But God's path happened to lead through
[20:47] the Red
[20:48] Sea. And how beautiful to notice just in
[20:53] that crucial
[20:55] hour. Oh, I love God for that. God waits
[21:01] till the very crucial
[21:03] moment. But he can speak and things keep
[21:07] up according to his word.
[21:10] He had promised them to take them to the
[21:14] promised land and he's obligated to his
[21:17] word. That great dark crucial moment.
[21:22] How easy it was for God to figure it
[21:25] out. He just stuck the pillar of fire
[21:29] and moved it over in
[21:31] between the Egyptians coming and it was
[21:36] light to Israel and dark to them.
[21:40] Now that's what it is coming to now my
[21:44] brethren. It's coming a place that those
[21:47] who reject Christ, he's becoming
[21:50] darkness to them. To those who accept
[21:53] it, it's becoming light to them.
[21:57] We are living in that day
[22:00] just before
[22:02] crossing. And did you
[22:05] notice how easy it was for the creator
[22:08] God to send down a strong east wind and
[22:13] justified the Red Sea and take his
[22:15] children across?
[22:18] Oh, the Red Sea got
[22:21] scared and just walled itself up because
[22:26] God's path led to the middle of it.
[22:30] That's the way God does things.
[22:34] If people, these people who was keeping
[22:37] his word, walking in the
[22:40] light, moving
[22:42] on, following God's commands, everything
[22:46] just opened up for them. And if you want
[22:50] things to open up, take God at his word
[22:52] and start moving
[22:55] forward. Now, we understand that they
[22:59] came to a place called Katish Barnea.
[23:03] That was a judgment seat or a testing
[23:07] time for all of
[23:10] Israel. And God
[23:12] always test his children by his
[23:17] word. Did you hear that? God tests his
[23:21] children by his word. If you believe his
[23:25] word, God tests you by the word.
[23:32] Now, if you
[23:35] notice, there come a time to go over and
[23:38] spy out the
[23:40] land. And when they went over to spy out
[23:43] the land, they came back the 12, 10 of
[23:47] them said, "We can't take
[23:49] it. We just can't take it because the
[23:52] cities are all
[23:54] walled and we look like grasshoppers
[23:57] upside of those great giants."
[23:59] But two of them said, "We can take it."
[24:03] That was Caleb and
[24:06] Joshua. And friend, I want you to
[24:10] notice
[24:11] that Caleb and Joshua was looking at one
[24:15] thing and the 10 was looking at
[24:17] something
[24:18] else. The 10 was looking at
[24:21] circumstances and Caleb and Joshua was
[24:24] looking at God's word.
[24:30] They said, "We can take it for we're
[24:34] well able to do it because God said we
[24:39] could do it." And I believe
[24:43] tonight as hard as I have preached and
[24:47] other ministers who sees the
[24:50] vision, I still believe that there's
[24:54] some way that we can break down the
[24:58] middle wall of petition and make
[25:00] churches of God run together as a
[25:04] brotherhood.
[25:05] [Applause]
[25:07] I don't know how it will be done, but
[25:10] God has said that he would have a church
[25:13] without blemish, without spot, without
[25:16] wrinkle, and he's going to have it.
[25:21] I believe
[25:23] it. Then they got them a false prophet.
[25:28] When people won't receive the truth,
[25:31] though it be in the
[25:33] minority, they'll raise them up the
[25:36] false prophet.
[25:39] The Bible said in the last days that
[25:42] false prophets of people would heap for
[25:45] themselves teachers having itching ears
[25:49] and would be turned away from the truth
[25:51] unto fables.
[25:54] Now God has to keep his word.
[25:59] He has to do
[26:02] it. Turned away from truth onto fable.
[26:06] And you notice they went and got another
[26:09] man by the name of
[26:12] Kora. And Kora got all the people
[26:15] together, as many as he could, and
[26:17] pulled them off and segregated them from
[26:20] the rest of them and started himself a
[26:23] little denomination of his own.
[26:26] saying, "There's more prophets besides
[26:29] Moses. There's more holy men. We are all
[26:34] holy man. And each one of us had just as
[26:37] much right to believe this as they had
[26:40] to believe that." But brother, it was a
[26:43] lie to begin with.
[26:46] God has a
[26:48] program and that program is written in
[26:52] his word
[26:54] and his word said we should be one
[26:59] all together
[27:02] not a divided divisions and fusses and
[27:07] stews
[27:09] but we should be one.
[27:12] Christ prayed that we would be one.
[27:16] And he said, "This will all men know you
[27:19] are my disciples when you have love one
[27:24] for the other."
[27:28] How can gifts and signs work in a
[27:31] church? How can God perfect his church
[27:35] when there is so much division among us?
[27:41] How can when one says this and one says
[27:45] that and one says something else and all
[27:50] contrary one to the
[27:53] other. There is one supreme
[27:57] judge. That's God's eternal everlasting
[28:02] word. And God keeps his word.
[28:07] So quicker we can line up with that
[28:09] word, better off we'll be.
[28:14] God keeps his word.
[28:17] [Music]
