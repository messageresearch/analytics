[37:11] that's what home is praise the lord
[37:15] amen amen amen
[37:18] brothers let your stay right after the
[37:20] service for the short meeting and
[37:24] we have just few things that we want to
[37:25] catch up with
[37:27] right after the service now now there
[37:30] were
[37:30] uh there are few brothers that have been
[37:32] helping us
[37:33] in the in the usher to be ushering with
[37:36] everything that we have going on
[37:38] we needed some help for the deacons
[37:42] so we have a brother
[37:45] dan for many of us that know brother dan
[37:50] he's uh he's been around yet as us
[37:55] right from being an usher helping in
[37:59] ministering in different things so
[38:03] i mean whenever we can get the deacons
[38:05] and we need somebody to come in
[38:07] we always try to get a hold of brother
[38:09] dan praise the lord
[38:11] so but then i've been helping to usher
[38:13] we just try to get a few brothers to
[38:15] help him
[38:16] and uh brother uh
[38:20] johnny but johnny uh
[38:23] you know he came to me some time ago a
[38:26] long time ago and said brother juan
[38:28] is there anything i can do is there
[38:30] anything that you want to be done
[38:32] that i can do and uh you know you you
[38:36] have seen brother johnny up here leading
[38:38] sons
[38:39] and uh you know he having his favorite
[38:42] song flat away his hands is
[38:43] up ready to fly praise the lord
[38:47] so he's helping out there
[38:50] also brother brother stephen wolves and
[38:53] then
[38:54] brother joseph they come in do the setup
[38:57] back there
[38:58] and out of there because it was just
[39:01] too much thing for one person to do amen
[39:05] uh but jordan has been multi-taxing so
[39:08] we just needed these extra hands to come
[39:10] in
[39:11] and a few of other things we will talk
[39:14] about
[39:14] when we meet as brothers but
[39:17] we just wanted to mention these brothers
[39:20] to you
[39:20] now let me see this is uh
[39:24] for the need that we are having these
[39:26] brothers are appointed
[39:28] to help us in this area and that is
[39:30] completely different
[39:32] from people that have voted into office
[39:35] because you know every every church
[39:38] has has its bad laws it has its uh
[39:43] rule of ordinance so uh
[39:47] i know pretty soon it's so it's so quick
[39:49] for people to start trying to look in
[39:51] there and see
[39:52] whether there are some qualifications
[39:55] that are made keep your qualification in
[39:57] your pocket for now
[39:58] until this kovac is over amen praise the
[40:02] lord
[40:02] we need the help of these brothers and
[40:04] we're going to make use of them for now
[40:07] so uh uh uh
[40:11] uh you know uh
[40:14] the uh sometimes some of these things we
[40:16] pray that the lord will give us grace
[40:18] that we'll be able to talk about them
[40:20] and and be able to place them you know
[40:22] rightly into their place
[40:24] because most of the time i've seen
[40:26] churches running right into crisis
[40:29] because uh sometimes these things are
[40:31] not understood
[40:32] among the people you know you have
[40:34] people that god
[40:36] has given gifts in ministry to the
[40:38] church but is also different
[40:40] when people are voted into office
[40:44] you know when the church votes certain
[40:46] people into office
[40:47] the church empowered him praise the lord
[40:50] amen that is the reason why
[40:54] when we moved down here to this local
[40:56] assembly even though
[40:57] i was a preacher for as long as being
[40:59] preaching but
[41:01] i was never voted by this church into
[41:03] office
[41:04] even though i force myself to be a
[41:06] deacon
[41:10] praise the lord because you know every
[41:13] time the door will sound back there i
[41:15] want to see who's coming in amen
[41:17] praise the lord i think i could take the
[41:19] heat so i would step back there and talk
[41:22] a little bit and brother john got so
[41:23] used to it that's not he had a door sign
[41:26] he would tell me go back
[41:32] praise the lord amen you know so uh
[41:36] uh uh but uh until until
[41:39] you know it got to the place where the
[41:42] church fell
[41:43] uh you know fell fake that we could save

[49:56] 1.
[50:00] it's in john chapter one we're gonna
[50:07] go right in there and start our reading
[50:09] with saint john chapter 1
[50:12] praise the lord in the beginning was the
[50:15] word
[50:15] and the word was with god and the word
[50:18] was
[50:18] god praise the lord are we together
[50:23] in the beginning was the word the word
[50:25] was with god the word was god i would
[50:27] want to say this
[50:28] before i continue reading this word is
[50:32] not about god
[50:35] this word that we are reading is not
[50:37] about god
[50:39] the word is god
[50:44] praise the lord the word is
[50:47] god
[50:50] i mean we can argue about it and says
[50:53] men were
[50:53] inspired and we can we can i mean we can
[50:56] use our mind to run about it
[50:58] but if you if you look at the details of
[51:01] the word if you look at the acts that is
[51:03] in the word
[51:04] if you look at the accuracy of the word
[51:07] men can never put this book together
[51:15] what you are holding in your hands what
[51:17] you are reading
[51:18] is god that's that's the greatness of
[51:21] our god
[51:22] he can be so humble so
[51:26] simple that we can handle him in our
[51:29] hands
[51:31] just as humble as he was that he could
[51:34] spit in his face
[51:36] that could nail him to a tree
[51:45] praise the lord amen in the beginning
[51:49] was the word
[51:50] and the word was with god and the word
[51:53] was
[51:54] god the same was in the beginning with
[51:57] god
[51:59] all things were made by him
[52:03] and without him was not
[52:06] anything made that was made praise the
[52:09] lord
[52:10] let's drop down a little bit verse 11
[52:13] he came unto his own in his own
[52:18] receive him net
[52:21] but as many as receive him
[52:25] to them give he power to become sons of
[52:28] god
[52:29] even to them that believe on his name
[52:34] amen now there is something that i want
[52:37] for you to
[52:38] to to take note of as many as receive
[52:42] him
[52:43] he gave them power to become sons of god
[52:46] even to them that believe on his name
[52:50] keep that belief on his name in your
[52:52] mind
[52:52] as we stated together this morning which
[52:55] were now born
[52:57] not of blood none of the weight of the
[53:01] flesh
[53:02] none of the word of man but of god amen
[53:06] so these ones that receive him these
[53:09] ones that believe
[53:10] on his name were born of god
[53:15] praise the lord the lord bless you have
[53:17] your seat keep your bible handy
[53:19] let's go to first period chapter three
[53:23] verse first peter chapter one sorry
[53:27] first peter chapter 1
[53:29] verse 23.
[53:49] amen now we are talking about these ones
[53:52] we'll receive him these ones who believe
[53:55] on his name
[53:56] peter describe it here also born of god
[53:59] the ones that are born of god
[54:00] being born again net
[54:04] of corruptible seed
[54:08] but of incorruptible
[54:11] by the word of god
[54:15] which liveth and the barrett
[54:18] forever praise the lord so peter year
[54:23] is letting us know that uh
[54:26] they are ones that are now born of
[54:28] corruptible seed
[54:30] let us say this way the children of god
[54:32] the new birth
[54:34] that we call born again the new birth
[54:38] it is not of corruptable seed is
[54:41] of is it's a seed incorruptible now
[54:44] take note of that word seed because
[54:48] we're going to be talking about plants
[54:49] here a little bit
[54:52] amen now let's take another scripture
[54:55] that would be as chapter 17
[54:59] as chapter 17. let's take a seventeen
[55:02] and we will read there
[55:04] uh 17
[55:10] verse 22
[55:14] at 17 let's read verse 22.
[55:20] this was paul then paused two
[55:23] in the midst of mars held and said yeah
[55:25] men of alton
[55:27] i perceive that in all things
[55:31] they are two superstitions if there is
[55:34] ever a time where the word is
[55:36] caught in that same place is this time
[55:39] amen
[55:42] i mean because of all the superstitions
[55:47] that is happening
[55:48] there's that that is what is all behind
[55:50] all of our
[55:52] uh our our theories most of our theories
[55:56] let me say that way
[55:57] for us i passed by i beheld your
[56:00] devotion
[56:01] and phone an altar with this inscription
[56:04] to the
[56:05] unknown god whom therefore
[56:08] ye ignorantly worshipped him declare
[56:12] unto you god that made
[56:15] the word and all things therein seeing
[56:19] that he is lord of heaven and
[56:22] earth dwarf net in temple made with
[56:26] hands
[56:27] neither is worshiped with man's hands as
[56:30] though he
[56:31] he needed anything seeing he gave it
[56:34] all life and breath and all things
[56:38] and have made of one blood all
[56:42] nations of men fall to dwarf
[56:45] on all the face of the earth and have
[56:49] determined
[56:50] the times before appointed and
[56:54] the bounds of their habitation
[56:57] praise the lord that they should seek
[57:00] the lord
[57:01] if happily they might feel after him
[57:04] and find him dull he be not
[57:07] far from every one of us amen
[57:10] is that not a good thing to know that
[57:12] he's here with us amen
[57:14] he's not found he's just a prayer away
[57:18] amen for in him we live
[57:21] we move and have
[57:25] our being a certain also
[57:28] of your own part have said
[57:32] for we are also
[57:35] his offspring amen
[57:40] that would be one of the words we will
[57:41] be dealing with too as much
[57:44] then as we are the offspring of god
[57:48] we ought not to think that the godhead
[57:52] is like unto gold or silver or stone or
[57:55] gravy by arts and man device
[57:59] a man amen let's stop right there
[58:05] let's stop right there we are his
[58:08] offspring amen
[58:10] praise the lord we are his offspring
[58:14] now this this subject caught my
[58:17] attention
[58:19] uh uh by
[58:22] reading the book of isaiah
[58:26] the book of isaiah had this subject to
[58:30] catch my attention and
[58:32] and and the way that it caught my
[58:36] attention if if if we want to quickly
[58:39] look at isaiah chapter
[58:40] 4 verse 2 i will just cope these
[58:42] scriptures and i will go
[58:43] quickly in that day shall the branch of
[58:46] the lord be beautiful and glorious
[58:49] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[58:52] excellent and calmly for them that
[58:56] are escaped of israel the branch of the
[58:58] lord isaiah used that language the
[59:00] branch of the lord amen
[59:02] and in in uh
[59:06] chapter 11 he used the same word the
[59:08] branch of the lord
[59:09] jeremiah came he started using that very
[59:12] same word the branch of the lord
[59:14] now it kind of cut my my attention
[59:18] most especially from isaiah chapter 11
[59:21] verse 1 the scripture says and there
[59:24] shall come forth
[59:25] a road out of the stem of jesse
[59:29] and a branch shall grow
[59:32] out of his root now so looking
[59:35] at branch looking at a root
[59:39] and all of that it got to my mind
[59:43] that i mean god is the first one that
[59:46] started this whole family tree business
[59:51] amen
[59:56] he's the whole he's the first one that
[59:58] started this whole family tree
[1:00:00] and i believe that is what the apostle
[1:00:03] paul was pointing to when he said
[1:00:05] we are all his offspring of one blood
[1:00:11] of one blood god make all men
[1:00:14] upon the face of the earth
[1:00:20] praise the lord so we want to talk
[1:00:24] about god's family
[1:00:28] tree i say this way god's family tree
[1:00:31] and uh just because
[1:00:34] over and over the scripture uses this
[1:00:37] language the branch of the lord
[1:00:39] uh there as i said the branch of the
[1:00:42] lord will be beautiful
[1:00:43] in john chapter 15 jesus said
[1:00:47] i am the vine and you are the branches
[1:00:54] praise the lord now in the old testament
[1:00:57] they saw him as the branch but when he
[1:01:00] came in the new testament
[1:01:02] he made you the branches and he says
[1:01:06] i am divine
[1:01:11] are we together now so
[1:01:14] over and over we see we see this
[1:01:17] language uh let's
[1:01:18] look in revelation chapter 22
[1:01:22] revelation chapter 22 as the
[1:01:25] as the bible closest
[1:01:43] as the bible closes the last chapter
[1:01:46] almost the last verse the bible says
[1:01:49] verse
[1:01:50] 16.
[1:01:55] the ones the one who this book is all
[1:01:58] about
[1:01:59] because the book of revelation is the
[1:02:01] revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:04] amen the one that this book is all about
[1:02:08] the one that the
[1:02:09] entire bible is all about
[1:02:12] because he is the principal team of the
[1:02:15] bible
[1:02:17] as he closed the bible this is the way
[1:02:19] he close it
[1:02:20] he says i jesus have sent my angel to
[1:02:24] testify
[1:02:26] unto you these things in the churches
[1:02:31] i am the root
[1:02:34] and the offspring of david
[1:02:37] the bride and the morningstar
[1:02:41] in another word to say everything
[1:02:44] of this book sprung out of me
[1:02:50] amen everything of this book
[1:02:55] sprung out of him
[1:02:58] praise the lord amen so you look over
[1:03:02] and over
[1:03:03] you see the uh you know the scripture
[1:03:07] uh uh speaks about that maybe that would
[1:03:10] give you
[1:03:11] some uh home bible studies to do to go
[1:03:14] and look for
[1:03:15] everywhere where the bible talks about
[1:03:16] branches that would be a good
[1:03:18] bible studies for you amen because i'm
[1:03:20] having lists of scriptures here but
[1:03:22] it will take us all of the time to be
[1:03:25] able to go through it
[1:03:26] i want to grab your attention by
[1:03:28] pointing those things out to you
[1:03:31] that uh god
[1:03:37] is the beginning of the family tree
[1:03:42] praise the lord are we together
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:51] i would take uh something from a
[1:03:54] testimony upon the seed
[1:03:56] and uh uh shared with you this morning
[1:04:00] i never believed that any man
[1:04:05] was to be a slave
[1:04:08] god made man a man made slave
[1:04:12] nobody to be a slave
[1:04:15] under the other we
[1:04:18] are all brothers we
[1:04:22] come from one great family tree
[1:04:27] praise the lord we come from one
[1:04:30] great family tree
[1:04:37] adam and eve in a garden of eden
[1:04:40] now spiritually we are born of god
[1:04:46] that changes our character
[1:04:49] we are all from one great family tree
[1:04:53] amen praise the lord
[1:04:58] amen now but what
[1:05:02] what what what made us
[1:05:05] uh different in our
[1:05:08] characters what make us different even
[1:05:10] in our complexion
[1:05:14] paul mentioned that in uh in
[1:05:18] acts chapter 17 if you never pick that
[1:05:21] up while we were reading it
[1:05:22] maybe let's look at that a little bit as
[1:05:25] chapter 17.
[1:05:27] he mentioned that a little bit i mean he
[1:05:29] just he just skipped over it
[1:05:32] but uh
[1:05:37] you know you can you can hide anything
[1:05:40] from the ego eyes amen
[1:05:44] praise the lord because we've been
[1:05:47] taught to read between the lines verse
[1:05:50] 26
[1:05:52] and have made of one blood
[1:05:55] all nations of men fall to the word
[1:06:00] on all the face of the earth water
[1:06:03] europe america and africa
[1:06:05] uh ensure all the face of the earth
[1:06:09] and have determined by times
[1:06:12] before appointed and the bounds
[1:06:17] their habitation amen
[1:06:20] the balance of their habitation looking
[1:06:22] at that word the bounce of their
[1:06:24] habitation
[1:06:25] our complexion can also fit into that
[1:06:28] our heights can fit into that amen some
[1:06:32] are tall some are short amen
[1:06:34] praise the lord but of one blood
[1:06:37] god hath made all men to fill the face
[1:06:41] of the earth
[1:06:42] praise the lord amen but
[1:06:46] more than that we will also
[1:06:50] uh appreciate that uh
[1:06:53] there are other things that contribute
[1:06:57] to us being different some talk quietly
[1:07:00] some loud and uh some are fast some are
[1:07:04] slow
[1:07:05] and uh and and all of these different
[1:07:07] things they are they are things
[1:07:09] that contributed to it and and those are
[1:07:11] some of the things that we want to look
[1:07:13] at
[1:07:13] and you know the reason why this is
[1:07:16] important
[1:07:17] because if you are a child of god if you
[1:07:19] are a son
[1:07:20] or a daughter of god you have to know
[1:07:23] that your birth is by an incorruptible
[1:07:27] seed
[1:07:28] amen is by an incorruptible seed that
[1:07:32] cannot be corrupted
[1:07:36] praise the lord it cannot be corrupted
[1:07:40] oh i feel like speaking in tongues this
[1:07:42] morning
[1:07:43] praise the lord when david said
[1:07:47] when david said in the psalm chapter 16
[1:07:51] when he said
[1:07:53] uh uh your holy one will not see
[1:07:55] corruption
[1:07:57] it was about all of god's
[1:08:00] children it was that it was that
[1:08:03] incorruptible seed it can never be
[1:08:06] corrupted
[1:08:07] sickness cannot corrupt it death cannot
[1:08:10] corrupt it
[1:08:12] amen there is there is
[1:08:15] nothing from from the family bloodline
[1:08:18] that can corrupt that sea
[1:08:20] because it's incorruptible
[1:08:25] are we together and that incorruptible
[1:08:29] seed
[1:08:30] is your true identity
[1:08:35] praise the lord is your true
[1:08:38] identification
[1:08:43] but we've been trapped in this body
[1:08:46] amen we we have been trapped in this

[1:09:32] was building my case i pulled something
[1:09:34] up here about cells the cells of your
[1:09:37] body
[1:09:38] it says cells are the basic building
[1:09:41] blocks
[1:09:43] of all human of all living things
[1:09:47] the basic building blocks
[1:09:50] you see the reason why it's hard for you
[1:09:52] to really know yourself
[1:09:54] building blocks are all keeping you
[1:09:56] behind
[1:09:59] you are behind building blocks
[1:10:03] the human body is composed of trillions
[1:10:08] of cells but the incorruptible seed
[1:10:11] is behind those trillions of cells
[1:10:19] trillions of sales
[1:10:22] when they just put you behind one cell
[1:10:24] you are crying
[1:10:30] trillions of cells
[1:10:34] praise the lord they provide structure
[1:10:38] for the body
[1:10:39] they take in nutrition from food and all
[1:10:43] of that the more you eat
[1:10:44] they take out your cell age
[1:10:48] amen they take all your iron by that is
[1:10:52] keeping you behind
[1:10:58] say i'm building my case this morning
[1:11:00] i'm speaking to this jury
[1:11:04] amen are we together
[1:11:11] so this human body is a prison
[1:11:16] you are walking around with your own
[1:11:18] prison
[1:11:24] are you ready this morning you are
[1:11:27] carrying your
[1:11:28] own prison
[1:11:33] praise the lord you are present in that
[1:11:38] body
[1:11:41] you see that is the reason why notorious
[1:11:43] criminal
[1:11:44] when they place them in prison i mean
[1:11:48] they have lived in prison
[1:11:50] so long they have made
[1:11:53] praise in life their life
[1:11:58] praise the lord they have got so used to
[1:12:01] the atmosphere in prison
[1:12:03] that when they set them free they are
[1:12:06] not able
[1:12:07] to keep up with the with the environment
[1:12:09] of a big world
[1:12:10] they are so used to confinement
[1:12:13] they have to commit crime to go back in
[1:12:16] prison again
[1:12:17] because that's what they are used to
[1:12:24] praise the lord that's what they are
[1:12:25] used to
[1:12:27] and we get so used to this prison house
[1:12:32] that the world comes to set us free
[1:12:36] praise the lord and then sometimes we
[1:12:39] get angry with the preacher what is he
[1:12:40] talking what he knows
[1:12:41] why why do you want to tell me and so
[1:12:44] you is because
[1:12:45] we get so used to this prison house
[1:13:02] are we together praise the lord
[1:13:06] it's not a nice way to start a message
[1:13:08] by calling you prisoners
[1:13:11] but i told you i'm building my case
[1:13:15] glory to god amen
[1:13:19] praise the lord are we together
[1:13:26] so that incorruptible seed
[1:13:32] that incorruptable seed
[1:13:37] has been sowed into this earth
[1:13:41] being sown into this earth this body
[1:13:46] now that was the reason why we play the
[1:13:48] message paradox
[1:13:50] because your life is a paradox
[1:13:54] amen your life is a paradox
[1:14:04] it's incredible
[1:14:08] but it's this truth that's what a
[1:14:11] paradise is
[1:14:12] a paradise is something that is
[1:14:14] incredible
[1:14:17] but yet it's truth
[1:14:23] and that's what your life is
[1:14:26] guess what this new verb that's what
[1:14:29] this holy ghost is all about
[1:14:35] oh i'm a little bit over my head this
[1:14:37] morning
[1:14:38] praise the lord i'm a little bit over my
[1:14:42] head this morning but
[1:14:43] i just i just have to hold myself
[1:14:46] praise the lord i just have to hold
[1:14:49] myself
[1:14:51] amen let's talk about this paradise
[1:14:55] 1963 that was the message you were
[1:14:57] listening to this morning
[1:14:58] he said i believe that every born again
[1:15:00] member
[1:15:01] of the body of christ is a paradox in
[1:15:04] themself
[1:15:08] i mean what makes you a paradise is
[1:15:11] because
[1:15:12] the incorruptible seed of god is in you
[1:15:16] but it's praising in trillions of cells
[1:15:23] is trying to express itself out
[1:15:28] amen you ever heard or read about prison
[1:15:31] breaks
[1:15:33] you ever heard of i read about
[1:15:37] notorious prisoners they have been able
[1:15:39] to
[1:15:40] convince the prison guide
[1:15:44] while they are in prison that's what the
[1:15:46] incorruptible sea is doing to you
[1:15:50] it's convincing yourself
[1:15:53] and slowly yourself is believing that
[1:15:56] see that is
[1:15:56] inside
[1:16:02] it's incredible but
[1:16:06] it's truth
[1:16:10] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:16:15] because something happened to you
[1:16:18] that change your whole being
[1:16:24] and anyone could look at that
[1:16:27] and knows what a paradise
[1:16:30] is is a miracle
[1:16:34] the greatest miracle you will ever have
[1:16:38] is the one that is happening inside of
[1:16:39] you
[1:16:44] that's the greatest miracle you will
[1:16:46] ever have
[1:16:48] is the one that is happening inside of
[1:16:51] you
[1:16:51] amen amen
[1:16:58] praise the lord amen
[1:17:03] have you ever slapped yourself before
[1:17:05] because you felt foolish
[1:17:06] oh i do that all the time
[1:17:13] i do that all the time
[1:17:17] i was listening to to a message one time
[1:17:20] i was
[1:17:20] i was actually driving and i just i felt
[1:17:23] overwhelmed
[1:17:25] because i saw it oh i just
[1:17:29] i just slapped myself in the face say
[1:17:32] wake up
[1:17:33] that's the reality
[1:17:41] praise the lord amen
[1:17:46] this is not just church membership
[1:17:51] this is not becoming part of a group
[1:17:58] no that is the reason why
[1:18:02] i want to talk about the word this
[1:18:04] morning the word of god
[1:18:10] the power that it has
[1:18:13] and what it is
[1:18:18] unless unless that happens you cannot be
[1:18:21] a christian
[1:18:22] unless you know uh uh uh
[1:18:26] there must be a paradise for you to
[1:18:28] become a christian
[1:18:30] something has to change that you cannot
[1:18:32] explain
[1:18:34] it's not because you identify yourself
[1:18:37] with a church
[1:18:39] something have to change that you cannot
[1:18:42] explain
[1:18:43] something happened to you that you
[1:18:46] cannot put in words
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:50] you cannot put in words
[1:18:56] and when you start to talk about it you
[1:18:58] feel the chills
[1:19:00] you cry
[1:19:03] because something happened to you
[1:19:10] because no one can change the spirit of
[1:19:12] a man
[1:19:14] amen and gave him a new birth that was
[1:19:17] the reason why it blown naked dumas mind
[1:19:19] when jesus talked about being born again
[1:19:22] he said what do you mean go back in my
[1:19:24] mother's womb
[1:19:27] because that is the only form of birth
[1:19:29] that we know
[1:19:32] but god have many form of birth
[1:19:37] there is your natural birth there is a
[1:19:40] spiritual birth
[1:19:42] and there is a constant birthing
[1:19:45] [Laughter]
[1:19:47] amen amen
[1:19:52] every time god brings you into a new
[1:19:54] experience
[1:19:55] it's a birth
[1:19:59] for god for you to grow in god you have
[1:20:03] to be born
[1:20:04] born again every day you have to be
[1:20:08] born as you go along the way
[1:20:12] oh this thing is becoming so guilty
[1:20:15] outside of god god alone is the only one
[1:20:19] can do it
[1:20:20] it is a miracle how god can make a man's
[1:20:24] thinking his way his life and everything
[1:20:28] change it from what it was
[1:20:36] how god can make a man a man mind
[1:20:40] poor with that anger i would kill these
[1:20:44] christians
[1:20:47] and god will meet that man on the road
[1:20:49] of damascus
[1:20:51] and affect him change his mind around
[1:20:54] the very thing
[1:20:55] that he wanted to crucify
[1:20:59] he says i will die for this
[1:21:02] wife nothing woman i will die for this
[1:21:06] i took a life for it i will give my life
[1:21:08] for it
[1:21:15] only god
[1:21:20] this is far beyond gut trains
[1:21:24] this is far beyond
[1:21:28] what we think our belief system is is
[1:21:30] far beyond that
[1:21:32] i'm talking about almighty god coming
[1:21:34] down
[1:21:35] and taking anger from your heart
[1:21:41] almighty god coming down and taking lust
[1:21:44] out of you
[1:21:47] taking the desire of sin and and and
[1:21:50] and things that are that are contra
[1:21:52] that's what i'm talking about
[1:21:54] that is the paradox
[1:21:59] only god can do it no church can do it
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:04] praise the lord no church can do it
[1:22:07] no preacher can do it it has to be
[1:22:09] almighty god
[1:22:11] our responsibility is to put you in the
[1:22:14] presence of god
[1:22:15] is to expose you to the word of god
[1:22:18] expose you to the presence of god
[1:22:21] and let that present affect your life
[1:22:24] and
[1:22:24] change your nature
[1:22:28] only god can do it
[1:22:36] how we together
[1:22:42] only god only god can do it
[1:22:48] that's the reason why no matter what you
[1:22:50] are struggling with
[1:22:52] no matter what the devil tried to to
[1:22:54] spit in your face with or push it on you
[1:22:56] and
[1:22:57] and and you have to allow
[1:23:01] your god become greater than your
[1:23:04] problems
[1:23:07] you have to allow your god in your mind
[1:23:09] god i know
[1:23:10] you are greater than this i know you are
[1:23:12] bigger than this
[1:23:19] the only way your problem can wear you
[1:23:21] down is because you have made your
[1:23:23] problem bigger than your god
[1:23:28] that's the only reason why they would
[1:23:29] drag you down that's the only reason why
[1:23:32] it will enslave you
[1:23:35] whether it is sin whether it is habit is
[1:23:37] because you have made that problem
[1:23:39] bigger than god
[1:23:48] are we together
[1:23:53] only god praise the lord
[1:23:59] what are we talking about this morning
[1:24:03] we are talking about the family tree
[1:24:08] why god uses all of this word branch
[1:24:10] stem
[1:24:12] roots offspring
[1:24:15] jesus said ah jesus testified unto you
[1:24:18] by my angels
[1:24:20] i'm the root in the offspring of david
[1:24:23] amen revelation chapter five no man
[1:24:26] could open a book
[1:24:28] the one that was water was the was was
[1:24:30] the root of devin
[1:24:32] why god uses all of these words
[1:24:39] it's because god deal with us
[1:24:43] just like how he deals with the earth
[1:24:47] that's why man was made out of the earth
[1:24:49] he deals with us just like how he did
[1:24:51] with the earth
[1:24:52] amen he deals with us
[1:24:56] everything starts from a seed
[1:25:02] no matter how tall we are and how much
[1:25:04] weight we have
[1:25:07] amen we started from a seed
[1:25:12] that was planted in our mother's womb
[1:25:17] so god always thought god believed in
[1:25:20] the seed principle
[1:25:24] because the principle of seed is
[1:25:27] the ability of that plant is in the seed
[1:25:31] that is the principle of seed
[1:25:37] i mean you see this big drive wall that
[1:25:39] is
[1:25:40] standing right by the side of this
[1:25:41] church it could fall down down and smash
[1:25:44] this whole building in
[1:25:45] but it started from a seed
[1:25:51] praise the lord it started from a seed
[1:25:55] that's the reason why god would tell us
[1:25:58] you are born by the incorruptable seed
[1:26:04] your spiritual birth your new birth the
[1:26:07] thing that god is doing in you
[1:26:08] don't have anything to do with church
[1:26:10] membership they don't have anything to
[1:26:12] do with what kind of
[1:26:13] organization you begin you belong to
[1:26:15] what they have to do with is the seed of
[1:26:18] god
[1:26:19] it's the seed that was planted
[1:26:23] amen that's where it begins
[1:26:27] is the seed god
[1:26:30] believe in sea principle and every tree
[1:26:35] starts with a seed that was put into the
[1:26:38] ground
[1:26:43] are we together amen
[1:26:47] are you here with me this morning glory
[1:26:50] be to god
[1:26:53] glory be to god amen
[1:26:56] let me share something with you
[1:26:58] ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 9 let's
[1:27:01] look at that together
[1:27:06] are we together
[1:27:09] everything starts with a seed
[1:27:19] starts with a seed are we together
[1:27:27] that is the reason why when you want to
[1:27:30] believe god when you when when you want
[1:27:32] to have
[1:27:32] you when you want to want to have faith
[1:27:35] it just it is not
[1:27:36] just in the blues and this is why i
[1:27:39] believe god no
[1:27:40] you got to stop with the sea you got to
[1:27:42] stop planting that seed
[1:27:44] god said it you got to find where god
[1:27:46] said it in his word
[1:27:48] and you can take that promise of god as
[1:27:50] a seed
[1:27:51] and hold it in your heart and say god
[1:27:55] you say
[1:27:55] by your strife i'm healed
[1:27:59] and you put that seed planted in this
[1:28:01] body
[1:28:02] this body will obey your confession
[1:28:08] praise the lord oh man
[1:28:19] let's look at ecclesiastes chapter 7 the
[1:28:22] last verse
[1:28:23] solomon said something there verse 29.
[1:28:29] if this would make sense to you i mean
[1:28:31] when we read this
[1:28:33] then the quote i would read would make
[1:28:35] more sense to you law
[1:28:38] he said this owner have found
[1:28:43] that god have made men
[1:28:46] upright but
[1:28:50] they have sought out many inventions
[1:28:55] amen that god has made man
[1:28:59] upright praise the lord
[1:29:03] now that word upright
[1:29:08] commands
[1:29:11] there are a lot of lot of meanings for
[1:29:13] it equal means
[1:29:15] straight upright correct right
[1:29:18] level pleasing uprightness
[1:29:22] righteousness
[1:29:25] that which is upright
[1:29:28] so because we are made by a holy god
[1:29:33] we can take the concept that god made us
[1:29:37] to be truthful amen
[1:29:40] he made us to live right we can take
[1:29:43] that concept
[1:29:44] and apply it to god made men to be
[1:29:48] upright
[1:29:50] but there is another concept also when
[1:29:52] we deal with family tree
[1:29:54] there is another concept that i want for
[1:29:56] us to look at
[1:29:57] this morning i share that with you some
[1:29:58] time ago but uh
[1:30:00] this will bring it into the picture
[1:30:02] let's look at this on on genesis
[1:30:04] question and answer on genesis and you
[1:30:06] and you will appreciate this
[1:30:08] you see because if you if you think
[1:30:11] about the c
[1:30:12] principle many of the times like i said
[1:30:16] year
[1:30:17] uh uh uh uh i i've always thought about
[1:30:20] it god
[1:30:21] making men out of the dust of the earth
[1:30:23] i've always thought
[1:30:24] that god you know what four men just
[1:30:27] like
[1:30:28] uh you know on a clay just made a clay
[1:30:31] on the ground and and everything like
[1:30:33] that you know
[1:30:35] that's that's the way i've always
[1:30:37] imagined because
[1:30:38] the bible said he made man and then he
[1:30:40] breathed into his
[1:30:41] nostril and man became a living soul so
[1:30:43] you always think about that sippy
[1:30:45] arrasty amen
[1:30:47] you think god was playing cpr
[1:30:54] that's what you would think but follow
[1:30:58] me in here a little bit now with this
[1:31:00] uh you will appreciate it as we back it
[1:31:03] up from the word of god a little bit
[1:31:06] question answered in genesis he formed
[1:31:08] man out of the dust of the earth
[1:31:11] are we together amen
[1:31:14] he formed man out of the dust of the
[1:31:17] earth
[1:31:19] and put this supernatural spirit
[1:31:22] i can see adam standing
[1:31:26] let's let's take this way see him
[1:31:29] standing
[1:31:30] like a tree
[1:31:34] god had made him he was
[1:31:37] dead as he could be
[1:31:40] his toes like the roots
[1:31:44] stick in the ground so if you think
[1:31:48] about the sea
[1:31:50] principle adam was not made flat
[1:31:55] adam was made upright
[1:32:01] if you think about the seed principle
[1:32:04] he was now made flat now you remember
[1:32:07] when
[1:32:08] jesus opened that blind man eyes what
[1:32:11] did he say
[1:32:12] i see men like trees
[1:32:17] that's what he said
[1:32:21] and here he said solomon telling us that
[1:32:23] god made man
[1:32:25] upright
[1:32:29] he made man upright he made man
[1:32:32] to stand
[1:32:35] oh glory be to god i had a little shout
[1:32:38] in faith this morning when i was
[1:32:39] studying
[1:32:40] praise the lord you will realize that
[1:32:43] that in child growth
[1:32:45] when a child is born sweet innocent baby
[1:32:48] they will just wreck that baby all over
[1:32:50] everybody want to grab the baby
[1:32:52] and everything pretty soon they all type
[1:32:56] glory be to god amen
[1:32:59] but there is one stage of the child
[1:33:02] that is that that captured the attention
[1:33:05] the first time the child stands
[1:33:10] the first time a child stands it
[1:33:13] captured the attention
[1:33:14] why because man was made up right
[1:33:22] the first time that baby will stand
[1:33:26] and try to take step
[1:33:29] everyone watch watch
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:40] praise the lord because i just saw you
[1:33:42] standing on the word yours now
[1:33:46] glory to god because
[1:33:49] man was made upright
[1:33:53] i mean look in ephesians chapter 6 what
[1:33:56] paul
[1:33:56] said the three times the apostle paul
[1:33:59] when he was talking about putting on the
[1:34:01] armor of god three times he used the

[1:40:42] which is god himself and when god
[1:40:45] make you your representation in adam
[1:40:50] was for you to stand the reason why
[1:40:53] we are born with our head we came down
[1:40:55] with our hair is because of the fall
[1:40:58] if not every son of god was going to be
[1:41:00] towards we're going to come just like
[1:41:02] adam
[1:41:04] we were going to come to this world
[1:41:06] standing to our feet
[1:41:09] glory be to god amen but jesus went down
[1:41:13] and he lifted us up
[1:41:15] he said stand up my children you were
[1:41:18] made to stand in the beginning
[1:41:21] praise the lord
[1:41:25] my goodness
[1:41:27] [Music]

[1:42:04] some baby
[1:42:06] that that we have to carry you born
[1:42:07] standing on the word of god
[1:42:09] even though you are a baby fair with the
[1:42:11] milk sincere milk of god's word
[1:42:13] but you're born standing on the word of

[1:42:42] died in whatever way and we prayed in
[1:42:45] and lay you there but let me tell you my
[1:42:48] goodness me
[1:42:49] that incorruptable seed
[1:42:52] david said they will not see corruption
[1:42:57] that's why paul said if this effort
[1:42:59] tabernacle be dissolved there is another
[1:43:02] one waiting for us
[1:43:03] because whatever happened if this body
[1:43:06] drop
[1:43:07] you don't see corruption in the
[1:43:08] twinkling of an eye you step into the
[1:43:10] new body

[1:43:27] denominational babies we will be
[1:43:29] standing like sons and daughters of god
[1:43:33] that is the reason why behind the
[1:43:34] curtains there is nothing like a prophet

[1:43:44] brother
[1:43:45] they didn't say our prophet
[1:43:49] there is nothing like pastor dave there
[1:43:51] is nothing like father there is just one
[1:43:53] father
[1:43:53] that's the heavenly father
[1:43:55] [Music]

[1:51:30] it makes you uncomfortable
[1:51:40] i'm thankful to god because i saw it
[1:51:46] i saw there was a seed planted in me
[1:51:51] why am i different why are these things
[1:51:55] happening to me
[1:51:59] from a family that never went to church
[1:52:02] all he knew was just his mother was a
[1:52:04] catholic father never went to church
[1:52:07] he was drinking and i mean always in
[1:52:14] trouble
[1:52:17] and with his transforming power plant at

[1:52:22] and i saw it whose son

[1:52:29] but a son of god
[1:52:33] and that's what i want you to see that
[1:52:36] predestinated seed
[1:52:38] it changed your identity it gives you a
[1:52:42] birth it gives you a name change
[1:52:45] that's the next thing that comes after a
[1:52:47] birth you have to name the child

[1:53:23] upon this word
[1:53:27] sent down his spirit and said here is it
[1:53:30] speak this
[1:53:31] and it happened
[1:53:35] if you don't appreciate what the grace
[1:53:38] of god is doing in your life
[1:53:40] changing your habits judging you drawing
[1:53:43] you close to god
[1:53:44] you think life is just all about all of
[1:53:46] these flashy perishable things
[1:53:50] that is the reason why we don't have
[1:53:51] fullness of joy is because
[1:53:53] we have put joy in perishable things
[1:53:59] we have put joy in perishable things
[1:54:03] it has to be money house cars
[1:54:09] but we still have them and we're not
[1:54:11] happy
[1:54:14] because they are not substance of joy
[1:54:20] i mean they are not substance of jaw
[1:54:25] they are job pacifiers
[1:54:28] you just suck on it a little bit and
[1:54:31] before you realize you want another one
[1:54:42] praise the lord oh my goodness
[1:54:47] glory be to god are we together this
[1:54:50] morning
[1:54:52] oh i believe it i believe it
[1:54:58] oh my i can break on him how he how he
[1:55:01] did do that through the watching
[1:55:03] of the water by the word the water the
[1:55:05] separation
[1:55:06] watch which we could explain it
[1:55:12] true predestinated believers will stay
[1:55:14] with the world because they
[1:55:16] are part of the word no matter what
[1:55:20] happened
[1:55:21] we will stay with the word and let me
[1:55:23] tell you
[1:55:24] that that that incorruptible seed is not
[1:55:26] your choice
[1:55:28] you don't choose it amen
[1:55:32] is the husband man that plant ate that's
[1:55:35] right
[1:55:36] and if he had planted it in you you
[1:55:38] better
[1:55:39] obey to bring fruit or as you will never
[1:55:42] be happy
[1:55:44] god is not going to change his mind
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:47] because you are stubborn
[1:55:52] amen you will just make life more
[1:55:54] uncomfortable for yourself
[1:55:59] until you submit it's not your choice
[1:56:02] believing god is not your choice
[1:56:04] accepting salvation is not your choice
[1:56:08] he was the one that choose you
[1:56:18] are we together
[1:56:24] now let's take another one here then we
[1:56:26] can be able to
[1:56:27] find a place to close here now he says
[1:56:29] and now
[1:56:30] there is many things i'm talking about
[1:56:34] my natural birth there is many things in
[1:56:37] my natural birth
[1:56:39] that i can't break on i tell you i
[1:56:42] ain't got nothing to brag on my mother
[1:56:45] was a sinner
[1:56:46] amen praise the lord to begin with
[1:56:50] my father was a sinner
[1:56:54] it takes an earnest person to come out
[1:56:57] and see this
[1:57:00] every every one of us try to to build
[1:57:03] some kind of a proud image of our family
[1:57:06] you know why we do it it's because we
[1:57:08] loved him
[1:57:09] we identify with them but when it comes
[1:57:12] to truth confronting god's word
[1:57:20] praise the lord when it comes to truth
[1:57:29] they come out of a bunch of uh cut
[1:57:32] throats and gunfighters and
[1:57:34] and most of them die with their boots on
[1:57:37] drunk
[1:57:38] bootleggers and and everything else out
[1:57:41] of kentucky
[1:57:43] my mother have indian i've got nothing
[1:57:46] to break on
[1:57:48] i can break on my family tree
[1:57:54] i can brag on my family tree
[1:57:58] like i say i don't know about yours
[1:58:04] glory be to god amen
[1:58:07] are we together amen
[1:58:14] i will tell you something also it might
[1:58:15] blow your mind
[1:58:22] but jesus of nazareth you see that is
[1:58:25] the reason why
[1:58:27] when john
[1:58:30] introduced jesus when he talks about the
[1:58:33] genealogy of jesus
[1:58:35] he never did like matthew matthew went
[1:58:38] back
[1:58:38] adam he went to david he went all the
[1:58:41] way down and
[1:58:42] abraham he you know much when abraham
[1:58:45] you know were the son of base and said
[1:58:48] he went
[1:58:49] macho went all through those things luke
[1:58:52] did the same thing talking about the
[1:58:53] genealogy of jesus christ
[1:58:56] but when it came to john
[1:59:00] honor that ego anointing
[1:59:04] amen when he talks in the beginning
[1:59:08] talking about the genealogy he traced it
[1:59:11] back to the beginning
[1:59:13] in the beginning was the word listen now
[1:59:17] and that word was with god
[1:59:20] and that word was god
[1:59:24] praise the lord now he's trying to help
[1:59:26] us to understand
[1:59:28] that the word that was god
[1:59:31] condescended and took on flesh
[1:59:38] are we together that word that was with
[1:59:42] god
[1:59:43] the word that is god
[1:59:46] took on flesh came among his own
[1:59:52] now owned it because they were jews his
[1:59:55] own
[1:59:55] hemorrhage his own he created him by the
[1:59:58] word they were all created
[2:00:01] came on his own and his own
[2:00:05] rejected him
[2:00:09] are we together now so you see the thing
[2:00:12] there is that
[2:00:14] the emphasis goes back to the word so
[2:00:17] listen to me
[2:00:18] carefully now because all the all the
[2:00:21] church word
[2:00:23] when they talk about jesus what they
[2:00:25] have in their mind
[2:00:27] is jesus of nazareth
[2:00:31] or in their mind when you talk about
[2:00:33] jesus i want to be like jesus
[2:00:36] the thing about that man in nazareth
[2:00:41] praise the lord but when you and myself
[2:00:43] talk about jesus
[2:00:45] is jesus the word of god for our day
[2:00:52] amen
[2:00:56] that's what god is bringing you to he
[2:00:58] wants you to be the word
[2:01:00] he wants you to be the son of god the
[2:01:02] daughter of god living
[2:01:04] out his word in this day
[2:01:07] no matter how you dress like jesus and
[2:01:09] nazar nobody going to believe you
[2:01:14] amen praise the lord i can't even try
[2:01:18] because i have to bless
[2:01:19] bleach my body
[2:01:24] i either have to grow my hair or wear
[2:01:26] wheat over my head
[2:01:34] so being like jesus is not
[2:01:37] that jesus of nazareth is
[2:01:40] jesus the word in your day
[2:01:45] being the word of god a son of god
[2:01:47] living
[2:01:48] out the word of god
[2:01:54] because the word is the sea
[2:02:02] incorruptible
[2:02:05] are we together
[2:02:08] let me take something here this will be
[2:02:10] my last two
[2:02:12] material that will use and then i will
[2:02:13] let you go
[2:02:15] life is the healer god promised
[2:02:20] he did visit to three
[2:02:23] or four generations the sin
[2:02:26] of the father upon the children
[2:02:30] amen that's what is written over in the
[2:02:33] book of deuteronomy
[2:02:35] in the old testament god did
[2:02:38] promise to visit the sin
[2:02:41] and not not only the sin but also the
[2:02:44] the blessings
[2:02:46] of the father now this is bringing us
[2:02:49] in a context that
[2:02:53] when god start watching over a seed
[2:02:57] he watched over that seed for four
[2:03:00] generations
[2:03:05] when god started watching over that seed
[2:03:10] so god interest in you
[2:03:15] was from the foundation of the world
[2:03:18] amen praise the lord when he start
[2:03:22] started looking on earth to watch out
[2:03:24] for your coming
[2:03:25] it was not in your father it was not in
[2:03:28] your grandfather
[2:03:31] amen beginning from your
[2:03:34] great-grandfather
[2:03:37] god started taking interest in you
[2:03:42] let's read this other one again you were
[2:03:44] watching see you
[2:03:45] hebrew chapter seven the bible said here
[2:03:49] that levi paid tithes when he was
[2:03:53] in the limbs of abraham four
[2:03:56] generations before he come on earth
[2:04:01] abraham isaac jacob
[2:04:05] levi was the fourth generation
[2:04:12] so when when abraham paid tithe
[2:04:15] to mechisity god saw that as an
[2:04:19] act of levi from the lambs of abraham
[2:04:26] that was when god took interest in levi
[2:04:30] for the priesthood amen
[2:04:38] are we together amen
[2:04:42] so he started watching watching out for
[2:04:45] your coming
[2:04:47] full generation
[2:04:50] whether your grandfather was a drunk or
[2:04:52] he was a smoke
[2:04:54] god saying down that bloodline
[2:04:57] it's coming my son
[2:05:00] amen
[2:05:03] whatever will happen to him let him give
[2:05:06] birth to the next generation
[2:05:09] that's not your great your your your uh
[2:05:12] uh uh grandfather was born god said okay
[2:05:14] the great grand can go now
[2:05:16] i'm watching that sea lion
[2:05:20] praise the lord when your father was
[2:05:22] born god said okay the grandfather can
[2:05:24] go now i'm watching that sea lion
[2:05:26] because down that blood strain
[2:05:31] is a vessel
[2:05:36] with a tiny sea like a button
[2:05:41] glory be to god glory be to god
[2:05:48] amen that's the reason why god don't get
[2:05:51] time for your race you don't get time
[2:05:53] for your age
[2:05:54] what he gets time for is that seed
[2:05:58] it's the seed
[2:06:04] are we together that's god's family tree
[2:06:11] all god children are his offspring they
[2:06:13] spring out for him
[2:06:15] and that is the reason why when they
[2:06:17] start to identify themselves
[2:06:20] in their day they can get so mad with
[2:06:22] the system
[2:06:23] they can get so mad with the churches
[2:06:27] they can get mad with all the lies that
[2:06:29] has been around them
[2:06:31] when the son of god or the daughter of
[2:06:33] god really start to identify themselves
[2:06:35] with the word of god they can say why i
[2:06:38] never knew this all of my life
[2:06:42] why
[2:06:45] because that seed is coming to
[2:06:46] manifestation
[2:06:50] so a lot of the things you have as
[2:06:52] habits
[2:06:54] attitudes and all of that they are
[2:06:57] yourself that the thing they are
[2:06:58] praising in you
[2:07:00] those things are not from you
[2:07:04] they are from your great grandfather
[2:07:07] grandfather your father is all of those
[2:07:10] things
[2:07:11] that give you the complexity that you
[2:07:13] have
[2:07:18] i mean it's what gave us the complexity
[2:07:21] we have
[2:07:28] the other they are the things that we
[2:07:30] inherit
[2:07:34] you see that's the reason why the new
[2:07:37] birth is very important broadband was
[2:07:38] talking in that tip this morning
[2:07:40] if you were listening about that boy
[2:07:44] amen he was a german
[2:07:50] can never apologize
[2:07:54] hide his hair high up
[2:07:58] but ram see if he stayed that way
[2:08:02] he can never make a husband to look to
[2:08:04] the wife
[2:08:08] what he needs is the new birth
[2:08:12] amen he call it the the the family
[2:08:15] strain
[2:08:17] the thing that runs down into your
[2:08:19] family that runs down into our family
[2:08:24] praise the lord now so if i mean
[2:08:27] if you if you if you love
[2:08:31] a man or love a
[2:08:35] you woman sometimes you know the people
[2:08:37] talk about this you know soulmate and
[2:08:39] soulmate they don't even really know
[2:08:40] what it is
[2:08:43] praise the lord amen they think so male
[2:08:45] 1 is is just a lustful companion oh
[2:08:50] glory be to god
[2:08:53] if you have been able to identify you
[2:08:56] don't have to be a husband or wife
[2:08:59] he can even be a pastor than a young man
[2:09:03] or a young woman
[2:09:05] identified that that is the seed of god
[2:09:08] no matter
[2:09:09] how they get caught up in india in in
[2:09:12] in in in their praising their carbon
[2:09:14] attitude you know that person have a
[2:09:17] test for god
[2:09:20] their ability to identify that helps you
[2:09:22] to overlook
[2:09:25] all their struggles
[2:09:32] but when a person does not have the
[2:09:34] first regard and respect for god
[2:09:39] that teach you to respect your parents
[2:09:43] then we know that we i mean we have a
[2:09:45] problem here
[2:09:48] you see that's the reason why peter said
[2:09:52] what baptism show us is a good
[2:09:55] conscience
[2:09:56] towards god so that's what we look for
[2:10:00] in the young people
[2:10:01] we don't look i don't want you to to
[2:10:03] come and cut me 20 bible verse
[2:10:05] because you can have the whole chapter
[2:10:07] on your own on your lips
[2:10:08] and you have no good conscience towards
[2:10:10] god no fear of god
[2:10:18] but when our little baby
[2:10:22] start having a conscience towards god
[2:10:29] then they are ready to go down to the
[2:10:30] water
[2:10:36] because even as we receive the holy
[2:10:39] ghost
[2:10:40] we still have the holy ghost in a
[2:10:42] complex body
[2:10:46] praise the lord amen we still have the
[2:10:50] holy ghost
[2:10:51] in praising
[2:10:52] [Laughter]
[2:10:54] glory be to god my goodness
[2:10:57] just like peter he went with the holy
[2:10:59] ghost in praise him
[2:11:01] john went with the holy ghost in prison
[2:11:06] you have your holy ghost in praising and
[2:11:08] your praising is yourself
[2:11:14] it's yourself
[2:11:20] now you see that is the reason why
[2:11:24] you don't play with the word of god
[2:11:25] young people we say this
[2:11:27] we say this we say this and brother
[2:11:32] good friend of mine we will talk all the
[2:11:34] time
[2:11:35] you know you just come here come
[2:11:37] together church and we meet and talk he
[2:11:39] said bro you talk about the word the
[2:11:41] word
[2:11:42] i don't know the word like you i mean
[2:11:45] you you've been you've been reading the
[2:11:46] word
[2:11:47] you always talk about the word you know
[2:11:48] you got to be in the word i come to
[2:11:50] church for you
[2:11:53] to teach me the word i said the word is
[2:11:56] jesus
[2:11:58] the word is what god is doing in your
[2:12:00] life
[2:12:03] amen the word is not just
[2:12:06] ignoring the the first book to the last
[2:12:09] book
[2:12:11] it's not just oh okay uh yeah must be
[2:12:13] born again yeah it's it's in john
[2:12:15] chapter three yes
[2:12:16] sin john chapter three you know no
[2:12:18] that's not the word
[2:12:21] that's not the word the word is a person
[2:12:25] the word is a man the word is
[2:12:28] christ the one to have
[2:12:35] closeness with you
[2:12:39] that's the word in the beginning was the
[2:12:43] word
[2:12:44] it was with god it was god that word
[2:12:47] came down and taken flesh
[2:12:53] that's god's family tree it started as a
[2:12:57] seed
[2:12:58] when god said let us make man
[2:13:02] in our image it was the spoken word seed
[2:13:06] that brought adam and when adam came
[2:13:09] forth he came up upright
[2:13:13] that was brother brahm teaching on
[2:13:14] statue of the peppermint that's what he
[2:13:16] was teaching on
[2:13:17] how we can grow in an image to be a
[2:13:21] living monument for god
[2:13:30] the lord
[2:13:33] don't the lie no backsliding devil you
[2:13:35] know the demons they are backsliders
[2:13:38] amen the ones used to have a good
[2:13:41] estimate backslidden from the promise of
[2:13:43] god so they know how to make you
[2:13:44] backslide
[2:13:48] praise the lord oh my goodness while the
[2:13:51] musicians come
[2:13:56] amen i feel like preaching though
[2:14:02] i feel like preaching though
[2:14:05] glory be to god
[2:14:18] god took his time he's been watching
[2:14:20] over you let's let's finish that
[2:14:22] a quote there on hebrew chapter seven
[2:14:25] the bible said
[2:14:27] that levi paid tithe when he was in the
[2:14:29] limbs of abraham four generations before
[2:14:31] he ever come to earth
[2:14:34] he was paying tithe to make chance today
[2:14:38] and bless him be the name of the lord
[2:14:41] then you that can believe in
[2:14:43] predestination before ordination
[2:14:46] and year four generation before levi
[2:14:49] whoever come
[2:14:50] out of the lands of abraham he paid
[2:14:53] tithe
[2:14:55] to make changes there which we had time
[2:14:58] to
[2:14:59] run this through the scripture you can
[2:15:00] run it through the scripture
[2:15:03] you can run it from genesis to
[2:15:06] revelation
[2:15:09] praise the lord you see that is the
[2:15:12] reason why
[2:15:13] the jews the jews
[2:15:17] that the favorite prayer of a jewish boy
[2:15:20] is the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[2:15:29] because they know that their ancestors
[2:15:33] came forth in the patriarch the 12th
[2:15:36] tribe
[2:15:40] are we together let's continue this he
[2:15:43] says
[2:15:44] if if you take it over
[2:15:48] like in jeremiah 1 4 god said i knew you
[2:15:53] before you were ever formed in your
[2:15:57] mother's womb
[2:15:59] before you were formed in your mother's
[2:16:00] womb i knew you
[2:16:05] when did he know you from the foundation
[2:16:07] of the word he hired you in his mind
[2:16:11] but as that time was coming close for
[2:16:14] you to be manifested
[2:16:16] he started taking interest in watching
[2:16:18] the sea lion
[2:16:20] from your great great grandfather
[2:16:24] that's the reason why nothing could have
[2:16:25] happened to your great grandfather until
[2:16:27] your grandfather was born
[2:16:30] and nothing could have happened to your
[2:16:32] to your grandfather until your father
[2:16:34] was born
[2:16:35] nothing could have happened to your
[2:16:36] father until you were born
[2:16:39] because god was taking interest in you
[2:16:48] before you were found in your mother's
[2:16:49] womb
[2:16:52] i have sanctified you and ordained you
[2:16:55] to be a prophet
[2:16:58] you love the lord this morning all this

[2:17:35] amen it was not your fault
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:39] it was all the cells that was running
[2:17:41] down your body

[2:17:44] why you used to love the things you used
[2:17:46] to love it was not your fault
[2:17:48] you were trapped in this body
[2:17:51] but now that the word of god has come to
[2:17:53] call you forth
