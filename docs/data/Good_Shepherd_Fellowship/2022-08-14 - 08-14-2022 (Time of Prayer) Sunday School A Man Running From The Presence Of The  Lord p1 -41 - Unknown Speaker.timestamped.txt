[12:03] [Music]
[13:20] you're the lord's lambs that he's let me
[13:22] feed
[13:23] and i trust that it'll
[13:26] it'll if he'll let me do that
[13:28] we're going on down the road about this
[13:31] marriage in divorce i wanted to speak on
[13:33] it ever since the time of those seven
[13:35] seals you know the myth all mysteries
[13:37] are supposed to be made known in them
[13:38] opening them seven seals all mysteries
[13:40] of the bible
[13:42] now i'm thinking
[13:43] now getting kind of old i i think i
[13:46] thought a better
[13:47] at least put it on tape whether
[13:49] something happened to me then the church
[13:51] might wonder wonder what he had on his
[13:53] mind what would he say
[13:55] and all those subjects that seems to be
[13:56] so
[13:57] hard i think by the lord's help i'm
[13:59] going to try to bring him to you and
[14:01] then then if something happens if i
[14:03] happen to go before he comes
[14:05] you you'll have it on record then
[14:08] i
[14:09] think we got some new books out i see
[14:11] sister available over a doctor sure or
[14:13] not is he here a sister vail um he's
[14:17] probably in a meeting i don't see him
[14:19] but oh yes way in the bank and um
[14:21] brother vale has wrote a book
[14:25] and it's uh i thought i believe he said
[14:27] today too brother bale is that right you
[14:29] have two here now
[14:30] two books now
[14:32] i don't know i
[14:33] way i understand that
[14:36] each person gets a copy so i if you
[14:39] that's why i understand i may be wrong
[14:40] in that and then the seven church ages
[14:43] has been finished is that right brother
[14:45] veil and on print now and i know you'll
[14:47] want to get them because they answer a
[14:49] lot of questions that's been in your
[14:52] hearts
[14:52] and then after that well we're gonna try
[14:54] to get the seven seals open you know in
[14:57] the book so that each one can read and
[14:59] form if they
[15:01] that they
[15:02] want to
[15:03] can understand and study i think when
[15:05] it's rolled out if it first we took it
[15:08] right off of the tape the way it was
[15:10] written or spoken you know you can
[15:12] preach a sermon
[15:14] it's one thing and then write a book is
[15:16] another see like i'd happen to touch on
[15:19] a subject like i'd say to you you'd
[15:21] understand i'd say now the serpent seed
[15:24] well now the reader of that book if you
[15:25] tuck it off and wonder what is the
[15:27] serpent see
[15:28] and they wouldn't know that happened to
[15:30] go into such a place like princeton or
[15:31] somewhere and they
[15:32] think we were unintelligent people so i
[15:35] got brother vail to kind of help me with
[15:37] this and keep the line of the same
[15:39] thought and give it grammar and
[15:41] i'm sure my remember that it would be a
[15:44] mystery to him sure enough so uh
[15:46] the brother vail is really good on that
[15:49] so he's as uh and then in that
[15:51] i think our precious brother must have
[15:53] picked up a little extra inspiration
[15:56] somehow
[15:57] and he said he was going to write a
[15:58] couple of books of his own off of him
[16:00] like and
[16:01] so he wrote one call i believe a 20th
[16:03] century prophet and another
[16:05] uh
[16:06] ladies see a church i believe or
[16:08] something like that and billy told me
[16:10] that night that i believe several
[16:11] thousand of them arrived today somebody
[16:14] brought them from texas
[16:15] and um
[16:17] so they'll be here and they'll announce
[16:19] it i think whatever they are
[16:21] i think they're sponsored i'm not sure
[16:23] if they are they'll be given away to you
[16:25] see to free
[16:27] and we hope you enjoy it and if you do
[16:29] shake brother bale's hand back there and
[16:31] tell him how much you appreciate i've
[16:33] never read it myself if i'd read them i
[16:34] might change my mind about that so i'll
[16:37] try to read them this week while i got a
[16:39] chance if i can
[16:40] now
[16:42] being wednesday night
[16:43] our meeting officially begins tomorrow
[16:46] night
[16:47] but i i think in being here among you i
[16:49] i just couldn't stay up there at the
[16:51] house and and know that you all were
[16:53] down here i
[16:55] just like you know like some of your kin
[16:56] folks come in you know when you run down
[16:58] to the end of the lane to meet him you
[17:00] know and
[17:01] and uh i thought i'd just run down and
[17:03] welcome you to jeffersonville
[17:05] and um so this last week i was about no
[17:08] i beg your partner about three weeks ago
[17:11] i come home i've been uh out trying to
[17:14] been on some meetings
[17:16] through arizona there and i come back to
[17:17] try to relax and
[17:19] i went on a hunting trip and
[17:21] i got the arizona state record line
[17:24] i run him through 20 miles of timber to
[17:26] get him but then the thinker that i
[17:29] never thought when i was a little boy
[17:31] just to show how these things happen
[17:34] a little place that the lord has given
[17:36] us up there for the months that we're
[17:37] out there in the school for the kids
[17:40] i was a little boy i guess jimmy pools
[17:41] here tonight maybe he's dad's your big
[17:43] gym
[17:45] we went to school together and i
[17:46] remember sitting there as a little
[17:47] ragged kid
[17:49] and
[17:51] shoes
[17:53] tennis shoes on toes out of them
[17:55] borrow a piece of paper from one a
[17:57] pencil from another i used to write
[17:59] poetry and mrs wood sure had me to
[18:01] recite that this afternoon on tape about
[18:03] my old ford you know and it's three it's
[18:06] so good
[18:07] uh she said we ought to send that to mr
[18:09] ford i said there's too much truth
[18:11] about a rattling a front and a grind in
[18:13] a rear and a chinese puzzle for a
[18:14] steering gear but
[18:19] it's uh but i've always said the only
[18:21] thing i had to do is count four tars and
[18:23] shake it enough to get it to start and
[18:24] then get in it i said it was good when
[18:27] i'd start up the hill with it and score
[18:29] pulling real slow saying i think i can i
[18:32] think i can i think i can let's start to
[18:35] decide
[18:36] i thought i could i thought
[18:39] that's the way we pull this hill like uh
[18:42] pilgrim's progress
[18:44] um so we
[18:46] i had a little poem i wrote something
[18:49] like this and said
[18:50] uh i just think i was only about 12
[18:52] years old and standing up there today
[18:54] looking up that canyon and thinking that
[18:56] lion will be sitting right here in this
[18:58] den room looking out the window in a
[19:00] glass window
[19:01] i was thinking of a little poem i went
[19:02] back and picked it up something like
[19:04] this just think how god do you believe
[19:06] god's an all inspiration
[19:08] god has to write a song
[19:10] you believe god's in songs
[19:12] jesus said so he referred back to david
[19:14] don't you know what david said in the
[19:16] psalms you know it's not look at the
[19:18] very crucifixion david sang it and the
[19:21] 22nd psalm my god my god wise thou
[19:24] forsaken me all my bones they stare at
[19:26] me they pierce my hands and my feet you
[19:28] know and that was a song
[19:30] thumbs is a song and in this poetry just
[19:33] watch height come to pass sitting there
[19:34] a little kid with a barred sheet of
[19:36] paper
[19:37] i said i am lonesome oh so lonesome far
[19:40] that far away southwest
[19:42] where the shadows fall the deepest over
[19:43] the mountain crest
[19:45] i can see a lurking coyote all around
[19:47] the purple haze i can hear a lobo
[19:49] hollering down where the longhorns graze
[19:51] and somewhere up a canyon i can hear a
[19:53] lion whine
[19:55] in that far off catalina mountains at
[19:57] the arizona line
[19:59] 40 years later i'm sitting right there
[20:01] at that canyon that line look at me in
[20:02] the face
[20:05] oh god
[20:06] there's a land beyond the river
[20:08] somewhere friends it's just it's got to
[20:10] be there see this there's too much
[20:11] speaking of it all these things are not
[20:14] just myths they are they're real they're
[20:17] realities i'm so glad to be here tonight
[20:21] to be with these people that i'm
[20:22] expecting to live over there forever
[20:25] with
[20:26] or
[20:27] there'll be more sickness or death there
[20:28] are separations and
[20:30] travel will be nothing to a sin now
[20:33] i think
[20:34] no meeting is complete without reading
[20:36] the word and having a little brother
[20:38] neville i just walked up here billy said
[20:40] you want me to speak with that right hey
[20:42] man
[20:45] maybe take a little too much for granted
[20:47] but
[20:48] uh i just felt so good about it
[20:52] so now you that's got songs and things
[20:55] you see brother neville when you go to
[20:57] sing and then just have it up there and
[20:58] have just about a half hour preliminary
[21:00] let's get right into these real deep
[21:02] messages and see what we can see the
[21:04] lord will do and i just trust
[21:06] i i believe we have truth
[21:09] i'm satisfied of that i believe the
[21:11] wheat is absolutely the shucks pulling
[21:13] away from it you know see
[21:16] i may give a little
[21:18] a prelude on that tomorrow night see how
[21:20] the shucks pulling away in the wheat but
[21:22] the wheat has to lay in the presence of
[21:24] the sun to ripen
[21:26] and that's what we're here for friend
[21:28] stay in the presence of the sun
[21:30] to our little group of people here
[21:33] the lift becomes so ripe to christ
[21:36] become bread on his table
[21:38] that's what i wanted to do
[21:40] and now before we approach the word
[21:42] after reciting poems and so forth let's
[21:46] pray again and we're going to take a
[21:47] text
[21:49] dear jesus
[21:51] help us tonight now in these few words
[21:53] as we wait
[21:55] upon thee and we pray that your grace
[21:57] and mercy will be with us lord
[22:00] tender our hearts
[22:02] move back all the shucks the thorns the
[22:04] thistles
[22:05] let the blessed sun shine of god falling
[22:08] upon the word lord and may we have such
[22:10] a great meeting tell there will not be
[22:12] an unsafe person among us all the
[22:15] children will be in the kingdom of god
[22:18] those without the baptism spirit may
[22:20] they receive it father
[22:22] may all the great mysteries that we are
[22:24] supposed to know at this age lord be
[22:27] unveiled to us and we'll see the
[22:29] plainness of god so that we'll know how
[22:31] to behave ourselves and act
[22:34] correct in ourselves and bringing the
[22:36] members of our body into discipline to
[22:39] the word that we might know how to live
[22:41] in this present day at the approaching
[22:43] of the lord jesus
[22:45] did i read thy word tonight lord i
[22:48] might by a partial education be able to
[22:51] read in some of the words and maybe
[22:53] mispronounce others but lord god you
[22:56] alone can pull the context out of there
[22:58] you're the only one that can do it
[23:00] there's no no way for a human being to
[23:03] ever do it it lays in your hands lord so
[23:06] give to us each night them things that's
[23:09] hid in thy word that we might be better
[23:11] christians and live according to the
[23:13] time that we're living in as examples of
[23:16] christianity we asked in the name of the
[23:19] lord jesus amen
