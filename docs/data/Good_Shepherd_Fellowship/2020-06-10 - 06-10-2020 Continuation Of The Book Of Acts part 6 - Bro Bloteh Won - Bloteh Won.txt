uh take our bibles again for the scripture reading thank you sister now i mean we will look around once again write in the book of acts as chapter two it feels like if we don't have the holy ghost we're not going to pass this chapter praise the lord so i'm hoping that the lord will give us a baptism tonight and so we can be able to go go a little bit further praise the lord but when we look in acts chapter 2 tonight or for for the reading of the word i just stand on our feet we will we will actually read sin john it's in john chapter 20 and let's uh read there it's in john chapter 20 then and then we will go back to the book of acts for our regular study from there the book of sin john chapter 20 praise the lord verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shot we just signed shouting with god tonight and i hope you shut all the doors praise the lord when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had when he had so said he show unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glide when they saw the lord then said jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father have sent me even so saying are you and when he has said this he breathed upon them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost whosoever sin yeshua remained was whosoever seen ye remain they are remitted unto them and whosoever seen here retain they are retained let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ father we say breathe upon us tonight lord we need the breath of god father for your word is the air that we breathe especially in such a time of god when we have uh this uh epidemic upon the earth for father and and we all using max to go into different places lord at work and father we want your world to be the air we breathe we want to breathe upon your promises of god father we're just committing ourselves in your hands tonight lord we say father breathe upon us tonight we love you and we appreciate you thank you for undertaking for us today the different things we have to do going to work and taking care of businesses and different things at home we just commit this time into your hands now lord as we sank a few minutes ago we want to be shouting with you speak to us tonight in the way only you can in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you let me have you see amen so we'll go now to ask chapter 2 and pick up with our reading and uh we stopped on verse 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them alterings verse 5 and there were dwelling a jerusalem jews devoted man out of every nation under heaven now when this was noticed abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language that is something that we have to underline that every man uh heard in their own language when those apostles were all speaking in tongues and verse 11 [Music] and verse 7 sorry and they were all amazed and mother saying one to another behold i being that all uh and not all these we speak gather lady he says and uh and how year we every man in our own tongue uh wherein we were born praise the lord so uh we know that the holy spirit fell and a gift of the spirit was birthed among them and uh and speaking in tongues now uh just like i said i try to stay away there you know from from all a lot of the the doctrinal part of this in the sense of uh we know that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost and [Music] but as we look over here in the book of acts and the continuation of uh uh the work of christ in the church it is very important that they have to start this way you know because it has to be christ living in us you know and working out doing the things that he promised to do so the holy ghost is very important so i want to just speak a little bit and and just do a bible studies tonight where we will look through the scripture and uh because we know that this was a promise you know the promise of the father the holy ghost was a promise that was given it was spoken about in george chapter 2 and as i also spoke about it a little yet a little there and with stumbling lips i will speak unto my people so we have all of this lying in in in the promise there that god gave to his people now brother branham someone asked bert branham a question on st john chapter 20. so i want to take that and and start the other with our our subject tonight on question and answer 1964 he was asked this question dear brother branham what is the difference when jesus breathed on his disciples and said receive ye the holy ghost and when they had to go to the upper room to tarry this year believer dear brother or sister was asking this question what is the difference between jesus breathing on the disciples and telling them receive ye the holy ghost that's the word of god and and the difference of them going to the upper room to tarry i love the way he said it he answered the question he says it was a promise he gave them breathe upon them his promise said receive ye the holy ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled he gave them the promise he already spoke to them in john 14 15 16 about the comforter and the holy spirit the spirit of truth that would guide them and lead them that was before his death buried in resurrection and after he resurrected when he appeared unto his disciples he said peace be shalom peace be unto you he said that twice and before he left them the scripture said he breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost but yet they had to tire it they had to wait for the pentecost now because you see even though jesus breathed upon them and said receive you the holy ghost there are a lot of things that are tied in here because there are scriptures that have to be fulfilled and because the holy ghost was also a type of the jubilee he that the son has set free will be freed indeed he has to wait until the 50th day which is pentecost it has to come on the 50th day because the holy ghost is also tied to the promise of the jubilee so brother branham says it was a promise he gave them he breathed upon them his promise said receive ye the holy ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled he says the same thing is when we lay our hands on the sick when we lay our hands to be healed we pray for the sake then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled praise the lord the same thing when the angel said unto mary the holy spirit will overshadow you and you will be found with trying she went on saying be it unto me a calling to your word the promise is given and we go believing for the promise to be fulfilled he says that's the same thing when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled praise the lord so uh there are few things here i want for us to for us to look at in the scripture uh just like we did sunday we were looking at the comforter and looking through the gospel now we will see here that right from matthew chapter 1 verse 18 that was when the angel visited mary an angel said to mary you will be found with child of the holy ghost and you will be found with child of the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy spirit that subject just like the kingdom of god it came really open in the new testament but yet it was something that also had a witness in the old testament when a priest was anointed when the king was anointed uh that anointing was was uh an example of uh allowing the the spirit of god to be able to guide the king or guide the priest into the office that they were placed in so in the old testament we have shadow we have types of the holy spirit but the subject and talking about the holy ghost really came out in the new testament but look over here in mark chapter 12 verse 36 the scripture says we read some few verses and then we'll look at all of this together mark chapter 12. let's just do a little bible studies together now my chapter 12 verse 36 chapter 5 the bible says and jesus answered and said why why he taught in the temple house said the stripe that christ is the son of david for david himself said by the holy ghost now so we realized here the scripture is on a line in here that david under inspiration under inspiration so david by the holy ghost they david said by the holy ghost the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand till i make that enemy that falls to so this verse here gave us an idea that the holy ghost was in the old testament because it was by inspiration now the word inspiration brings us to the place to be able to look at this word that we want to deal with tonight called the breath of god that's what that word means when when paul says every every scripture is given by inspiration job in the book of job says the inspiration of the almighty given wisdom that word inspiration that is used throughout the scripture brother branham says i'll read it to you here he says that that that was the best form of words that the the theologians could find to describe the birth of god the inspiration of the almighty and we know that inspiration is is uh uh that breath of god which is the inspiration is also the pouring out of the holy ghost so david by the holy ghost which of course this is over in the psalm so david by the holy ghost honor inspiration he says my lord said unto my lord let's look a few more verses again luke chapter 1 verse 15 few more verses here before we get on going just want to bring it out that this subject of the holy ghost is not only peculiar to we new testament believers is all there just even before the date of pentecost let's go ahead yet a little bit luke 1 15 praise the lord verse 13 and the angel said unto him fear not zechariah for thy prayer is heard and the wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of god and shall drink needle wine non-stone drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb now you have to realize that this is before pentecost this is before the day of pentecost that's why i want to grab your attention that this is before the day of pentecost when david spoke by the holy ghost it was before the day of pentecost luke chapter 1 verse 41. we will read from verse 39 and married arose in those days and went into the hill country with his into the city of judah and and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost this is also before pentecost brother branham says this was when the first time that the name of the lord jesus was put on on uh mortal tongue the first time to talk about him the baby lived for joy and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost i know a lot of questions might come to your mind brother one is this the baptising of the holy ghost or uh what what is this let's not be his let's travel a little bit verse 67 of the same chapter luke chapter 1 verse 66 we read and all they that heard them lay them up in their heart saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the lord god of israel for he have visited and redeemed his people now we have to realize that this is after zechariah's he was he was he was dumb for some some few days you know the angel told him you know you're not going to speak until this child is born and and and after the child uh uh was born the people were trying to name the child zechariah or name the child uh give the child zechariah's father's name or look for some kind of you know a relative name to give to this child all the men were were deciding now he has to be named after his father and elizabeth said no his name is john the bible says right there the holy spirit came upon zechariah and lose his tongue and he begin to speak and says you know god has visited his people so he was filled with the holy ghost i want us to look at this pattern of being filled with the holy ghost because that was what took place on the date of pentecost but it's more than that praise the lord luke chapter 2 verse 25 and 26 now you will see here that luke he he brought this in his report in his testimony he brought all of this because he's also reporting in the book of acts about this experience of the holy ghost so let's look at that luke chapter 2 verse 25 and 26 and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simon and the same man was just and devote waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he that he should not see death before he have seen the lord's christ so we see zechariah there the holy ghost i mean simon there the holy ghost upon him and the holy ghost revealing to him the holy ghost dealing with him praise the lord luke chapter 3 verse 22. we'll read from verse 21 now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying and heaven was open and the holy ghost descended in a buttockless shape like a dolph upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou are my beloved son indeed i'm well pleased the holy ghost coming in a body leg shape like a dog praise the lord so we see the holy ghost again luke chapter 4 verse 1. and jesus being filled of the holy ghost returned from jerusalem and was led by the spirit into the wilderness praise the lord now this look chapter 1 verse 4 let's look at acts chapter 10 verse 38. we're doing a little bible studies here trying to look at the holy spirit through the gospel year through the scripture because sometimes as chapter 10. verse 38 we read from verse 37 that word i said ye no which was published throughout all judea and and begin from gathering after the baptism which john preach how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him you you see over and over in the message brother branham quoted this scripture talking about jesus being anointed with the holy ghost now because sometimes and many times when we get to our teaching of the godhead and and we're looking at the three offices when it comes to jesus we believe that you know he was the fullness of god bodily and most of the time people struggle in their mind because jesus was the fullness of god we kind of a struggle in our mind i know her brother you know one time faced me with this uh uh scripture says how can you say that jesus received the holy ghost well i'm not saying it now that's what the scripture says luke chapter 3 22 says you know at his baptism he received the holy ghost chapter 4 verse 1 saying it and saint john chapter 1 verse 33 says it asks chapter 10 verse 38 says that and god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost now when you look at that verse you see the three offices play out right in that verse god the father anointed jesus the son with the holy ghost john chapter 7. it's in john chapter seven so john chapter seven let's look at uh verse 39 we've read this before as well verse 37 in in in the last day that great date of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man tears let him come unto me and drink he that believeth me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he speak but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified now so you know you read that but then you go back to all of these examples that we took from the beginning from the birth of jesus told to to the experience of zechariah's and the experience of lit of elizabeth and the experience of simon uh uh in the in in the temple and all of this and then we asked the question but yeah jesus said that the holy ghost was not giving well what was that praise the lord now so what we want to come to here as we we we we want to uh just look at the subject we realized that uh as the scripture speaks in this sense the holy ghost was not given here because jesus was not glorified on the dead of pentecost that was when the very the very first time after uh uh uh uh edem experience after adam and eve walked away from the garden of eden and after our lord jesus and his experience on the on on the river jordan on the date of pentecost was the first time where the spirit of god would come into the human heart now brother branham taught us that under the old testament covenant these men received the holy ghost they were filled they were inspired by the holy ghost but it was just an inspiration it was an anointing that came upon them john received an anointing that made him to speak again after he lost his speech he received that anointing and he said the child name is john he's born to deliver his people simon in the temple the holy ghost came upon him and he prophesied when the name of jesus was mentioned the child in elizabeth lived for joy and she fed an anointing that came upon her that was the holy ghost david on an inspiration when he wrote the psalm he fed an anointing that was the holy ghost said in the message blasphemous name talking about in john chapter 20 he says and when he have said this he breathed on them and said receive yeah the holy ghost church bomb by the birth of god born by the birth of god when this stature has mold itself up there in condition god's breath breathe upon them receive year the holy ghost then you are a son of god you can join anything you want but you are born into the church of the living god praise the lord now let's go back to genesis the first time where the scripture would talks about and god breathed upon man and man became a living soul the breath of god he breathed upon adam he became a living soul and we know under that breath of god adam could name all the animals and god was pleased with aid adam could speak the mountain to this place and bring it on this side and he had that authority as an amateur god upon the earth because he was completely under the breath of god that was just before genesis chapter 3 came in praise the lord now you have to watch this because the breath of god is not a sensation the breath of god is the very word of god his breath is his word like brother branham saying here he says he says yeah i read that again he said unto them breathe on them yeah receive ye the holy ghost church born by the breath of god and this stature you know he just he just preached in the morning on the statute of a perfect man and he's preaching in the evening here so he's continuing with that thought how the perfect man the statue of epiphany how a perfect man comes to be a perfect man is by the breath of god so he says when this statue has molded itself up there in condition god's breathe breathe upon him upon them receive here the holy ghost then you are a son of god you can join anything you want but you are born into the church of the living god born by the breath of god god breathed upon them and said receive here the holy ghost so it was not just a statement it was not just a statement when he breathed upon them receiving the holy ghost you remember when we was talking and brother branham says he says that baptism of the holy ghost is just like a little button it's a seed that god placed in the heart of the sons and the daughters of god we have to remember that by one spirit we are baptized into the body that initial baptising of the holy ghost by one spirit we are baptized into the body you know uh pentecostal and the church system they made these holy ghosts everything else they make it sensation they make it a doctrine and they left out the very sea word of god the scripture said in john chapter 1 that we are born by the incorruptible seed which is the word of god that's the breath of god that's where our birth begins receive ye the holy ghost brother branham also said over in mark of the base and the seed of god he said the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost the mark of the beast is to reject it receive ye the holy ghost how many won the baptism of the holy ghost stand on your feet how many want to be sealed in the kingdom of god by the holy ghost now so you see that is the baptism of the holy ghost it seals uh into the kingdom of god that is our birth that is word that seed of god the breath of god that brings the the the nature of god in the believer in a seed form it might looks like i'm going in a cycle but i'm coming to a place here brother branham should also reaction to an action he says and as christ said in that in that days gone by as he seven we say now receive ye the holy ghost breathe upon them lord the spirit of life may they go down and receive the holy ghost breathe upon them now the spirit of life and may they go and receive the holy ghost it's almost like what paul said in in galatians chapter four because ye are sons because you are a son that's why the holy ghost comes upon you and what makes you a son is that seed of god is that breath of god that is in you the holy ghost comes upon that word problem says he breathed upon them the promise and what is the promise that's the word the word what is the promise it's the seed it's the breath of god and it had to go and wait for an hour for filming no one can call jesus the christ says the scripture except by the holy ghost praise the lord so there is an initial birth of the spirit there is an initial birth that brings the seed of god into the believer and it is that verb that takes you through all the stages it's that birth that makes you to believe the lord jesus christ as your lord and savior you don't believe it by your human uh uh knowledge is that initial birth of the seed of god the birth of the incorruptible seed it takes us through all the stages it takes us through all the the steps of the stature that brother branham talks about but it first starts from a birth just like the natural birth it starts from a seed the spiritual verb starts from a seed and that is the word of god that's the reason why you cannot put no experience above the word of god brother branham says the seed of god he says is the baptism of the holy ghost he says the mark of the beast is to reject it so you cannot believe that you have the holy ghost and you are rejecting the word it all starts from the word when people make the subject you know whether they're speaking in tongues what a it's a bright light that comes through the room whether it's a warm feeling that goes over the body all of that is wonderful but life begins from that seed life begins from that initial seed spoken word seed that is planted down in the heart the breath of god and that breath of god is the inspiration of the almighty look in acts chapter 10 the bible says why peter preached this word the holy ghost fell upon them the holy ghost follow the word why am i saying out of this tonight i'm talking about ignoring the spirit of truth nor in the holy ghost nor in the way that god is dealing with us because even our young people struggle honor this thoughts it all starts every birth starts from a seed and that's the reason why genesis 1 11 every seed will bring forth of its kind that was why brother branham brought out that message spoken word is the original seed the experience is not the seed the the experience just show that the seed was there but the spoken word of god is the original seed jesus said the the the the spirit of truth he will speak of mean he will remind you he will bring you back to the word the holy ghost will always bring you back to the word that's the spirit of truth now we know on the date of pentecost when the holy ghost came there i mean a gift was birthed they spoke in tongues it was not because that they spoke in tongues means that that was just an evidence it was an outward manifestation of a spirit that was birthed in them so that does not mean that everybody that received the holy ghost have to express the same outward manifestation he breathed upon them receive ye the holy ghost that's the breath of god praise the lord i was looking at this thought jesus in st john chapter 3 he's he speaks of the holy spirit to naked demons and said it's just like a wing and i was actually looking at okay let me see if if this is what i was looking at this afternoon i'll just i'll just so the thought that was going through my mind when jesus talks about in in uh genesis i mean john chapter 3 he told nicodemus the spirit you know we just feed it it's like a wing it blows you know it comes from this weight and we just we just get the effect upon us we don't know where it's coming from and where it's going and all of that on the date of pentecost when the holy ghost came down in the upper room it also came in the form of a russian mighty wing it also came in the form of a russian mighty wing i mean they fed a move you know the federal move just like uh uh isaiah in the temple he said the doorposts move when those angels came down you know if we're trying to cover their eyes and their feet and their wings he said the doorpost moved there was there was a movement that took place in the building in in the temple with isaiah i was this afternoon just this evening i was reading some things on on on the effect of wayne [Music] and it's beautiful to think about how god who will type or compare the moving of his spirit you know in that way praise the lord and but yet the new testament church was birthed jesus was going to continue what he did and the disciples saw temporarily like brother branham said what we saw temporarily in his ministry you know he says that in the tear pool we're going to see those things happen what they saw in the three and a half year ministry he was going to continue that work but he needed to have a birth of the spirit to take away their fears he promised them i will be with you even in you to the end of the word you have all of these promises that was given to them the holy ghost comes as an assurance to the believer he breathed on them receive ye the holy ghost that's the breath of god the word of god is the breath of god every time god comes to one age and brings a messenger just like he did to to ezekiel he took ezekiel talking about uh uh the spirit of god and and what the law was going to do you know to the house of israel he took ezekiel down to uh to the to the valley of dry bones he took ezekiel there and he asks ezekiel what is this he says oh this these are all there people dry bones he said ezekiel can these bones live again praise the lord can these bones live again he says oh lord thou know it and what he said to ezekiel prophesied in another sense breathe upon them and when ezekiel prophesied upon the bones you know what happened a wing came in the valley and started moving the bones to their different joints after the prophet ezekiel prophesied upon the bones according to the commandment of the lord there was there's a wing a whale wing that came in the violin and all of those bones starts to take shape it starts to move in a direction for a body to be formed and that is the very same thing that god does to the church every time we sit under the word of god he breathed upon us for us to get strained to stand upon the promises for us to get strained to rebuke the enemy resist the devil and he will flee you cannot do it in your own mind you have to do it because of the word of god you have to do it basis on the word of god it's not how many times you shake your head oh man my head will have fall off my shoulder because when i came to the message as a young man i mean right in that in in those 10 years oh man you're just oh [Laughter] just shaking your head down the street trying to get get the devil from on your mind but we have to use the word we have to use the word when he prophesied upon the bones life came back to them god was just showing the prophet ezekiel how he will restore the house of israel it's not by power not by might but by my spirit said the lord now by power nabha might receive ye the holy ghost he breathed upon him it was important if it was not important jesus wouldn't have done it he spoke to them about the the the the comforter the spirit of truth he taught them that was a teaching time when he was here in in in the body that was a teaching time he taught them when the spirit of truth come this is what it would do it would it would remind you it would teach you it will lead you it will guide you he gave them all of those teaching but after he resurrected it was time for him to impart the believers and that's why we are looking forward i mean having young people that are taking taking the word of god no matter what i mean is going on in your life what the what the enemy is bringing upon you have to get on the promises of god's word you have to fight the devil because the word of god is the sword of god that fights the enemy you got to identify yourself with the promises of god god said it i believe it all because i believe we are going into more troubled waters i mean with everything that is happening around us praise the lord amen if if if they take the police then we will need angers we need the angels of the lord to come now and guide our home and that's i mean that's when we really need them to be visible praise the lord but what it is young people the reason why we are saying this you know that the holy ghost is it's not a myth it's not i mean you you got to take the word you got to feed upon the world you got to meditate upon the world even our young people look the bible talks about about john even though it was he was the forerunner you know to come and present the messiah by the father of the matter that is that the scripture says even in his mother womb he received the holy ghost that just made no excuses for our babies and sometimes uh parents we i mean we just we just uh we we overlook these things and just think that all the they are kids when when they grow up it is our duty our duty right from birth to start teaching them preparing their hearts for them to receive the holy spirit i believe in my mind when when a little child comes to the place where they get conscious of their nakedness because that's what the scripture says baptism show a good conscience towards god when a child is getting to that place where they are conscious parents must start teaching them preparing them since all you know every child that that you know that leaves and and and i mean if they have to die young to go right in the hands of god that's why brother branham said he said jesus died for the sin of the world it covers that but we have to know that the bible says repent and be baptized they that are baptized will be safe that's where it starts from a child being born in the message does not means that they are said they have to be baptized and brother branham says we must expose them that the lord will get them young and let god start dealing with their hearts sometimes the church has just put our minds in a place where we are looking for a kind of a outward uh uh uh manifestation our demonstration and and as a parent you know as a parent sometimes we become so technical on our children that we just see all their flaws and we not even see the little thing that the grace of god is doing in their lives the bible says zechariah he was a just man the scripture speaks about simon in the temple he was a just man even though at that time the holy ghost was not given as a dwelling being in the body it was not dwelling but it was still under the inspiration of the holy ghost in the fact that god was dealing with them an angel came to zechariah's and spoke to him in the temple and told him he would have a child god was dealing with them they would stay on the blood of the old testament still under the blood of bulls and gods but these men have their hearts right and when a man or the woman abort again your heart is right the spirit of god will deal with your heart if your heart is right the spirit of god will deal with your heart and these few days we've been kind of for reading through the book of proverbs praise the lord and i was taking some time to study the book of proverbs as well you know and just because one of the things that will that was uh uh dwelling on my mind thinking about that is that uh that was one of the things that solomon asked the lord give me wisdom so i can know how to go in and come out among your people because your people are such a great people i won't waste them and god bless him with wisdom and honor inspiration a lot of the things that he wrote uh a true uh through the proverbs uh all about uh some of those wisdom that god gave him and this is this is something that i pick up in in chapter four solomon said this and it's so beautiful proverbs 4 verse 20 he said my son attend unto my words incline thy ears unto my saying now you take it now ask the word of god and let them now depart from their eyes keep them in the midst of their heart for they are alive unto those that find them and health to their flesh and he says keep the heart with all diligence the heart is the most treasure thing that a man needs to keep if there is anything that god has made us tear us over is to be able to guide our hearts keep the heart with all diligence for out of eight are the issues of life if a man keep his heart right because we have to know when god deals with us he done this with our mind he deals with our heart when that small stab word speaks to you it speaks to your heart you have to guide your heart when we meditate we we we retreat to our heart as a man think it in his heart so is he that is the most treasured and even when brother branham talks about the holy ghost he talks about the book of arts and and and he talks about the holy ghost and the heart of man being the throne of god he says it's that little place in the heart where blood do not go he says that's the place that god kept to put his spirit in and yes solomon here say my son keep your heart with all diligence with everything that you can protect your heart is the most important thing because when the devil put bitterness down that place you're going to struggle amen all the devil can blast your mind with different things but if he dropped lost in your heart it's a spirit it's going to torment you if he dropped lie in your heart even when you are not supposed to lie you will still find a way to lie it's a spirit he's warring to take his throne in our hearts he wants to take his residence in our heart because he knows that's the powerhouse he knows that's where the control tower is keep your heart with all diligence with all diligence the enemy can blast your mind he can reflect your body he can do whatever he wants to do with if your heart is guarded and your heart is kept before the lord you think about job with souls all upon his body but because he gathered his heart in the lord of god's word right in the midst of all of those pains and boys he could say said i know my redeemer live it strength who comes from the inner of his heart to make him to rejoice in the vision that he was seeing even though his healing has not come but just a vision broke to his eyes he was able to stand up with all the sword and the pains on his body and he says i know my redeemer leave it that's what happened to a believer we can go through different things but the joy of the lord in your heart becomes your strength because out of the heart comes the issue of life they had these with every part of our life every part of our life comes from there and that's where god want to put his spirit that's where that seed of god is planted you know it's it's almost like when brother branham talks about the difference between the presence of god and the blessings of god he says sometimes the things that we feel in the service he said is just the blessings of god it's just his blessing he says but there is something different about his presence and you look through this through the scripture every time a man comes in the presence of god i mean it is sliding just like isaiah he fell straight to his face what is mean moses there took out his sons and god came down i mean he felt dead fell at his feet as a dead man that's the same thing ezekiel said when he enter into the presence of the son of son of man he says i felt a lot at his feet as one that is dead praise the lord young people guide your heart fill your heart your desires don't think about uh i mean [Music] the lord has always he promised us never to leave us never to forsake us amen even before we got here he promised us that he will not leave us he will not forsake us but feel your desire you know just like paul said he said earnestly desired gift fill your desires with spiritual things lord i want the holy ghost lord i want spiritual dreams filled fill your heart with those desires the lord promised to take care of you and and and then i promise you he will keep his word he promised to take care of you he told us in the scripture you see the birds he take care of the birds he said you see the flowers solomon in all of his appearing he cannot be compared when you bring all the flowers together with all the abilities god take cares of his children go to school study your lesson believe that the lord will bring you out he will give you a good career he will give you a good job he will give you a good wife a good husband don't feel you don't let the enemy fill your minds with those things fill your heart i want to be a son of god i want to be able to feed from the message i want to i want to be able to feed from the breath of god guide your heart because out of here comes the issue of life praise the lord as we go talking about the book of arts and and and the beginning of the church we just tried to establish how important the holy ghost how important it was to the early church jesus continuing in his work he just couldn't leave those disciples to go and brother branham says when he sent us he don't allow us to go he go with us when he sent us he go with us that's what we need you know young people we say then we talk about our different experience and we encourage one another and then sometimes we get to worry and we get to thinking and this other sister had this experience and this other brother had this experience and we get into that place of comparing with one another god deeds with his people in different ways all you have to do is just guide your heart keep the desire of god in your heart god i want more of you young people uh all the the the uh the daniel and uh uh little prayer and and hannah and all of these young young children we have you people are not just babies you know how to use the cell phone you must be able to do your memory verse as a young child that's the thing that will as you keep memorizing those verses and saying it it brings the holy spirit because brother brown said every time we talk about him he come closer sometimes we want to leave the responsibility to the sunday school teacher that is our work as parents that is the way we we bring our children we expose him to christ it's almost like jacob taking her little moses and putting him on the river that that's a mother's heart looking at her baby but i'm telling you she did it by the instruction of god's word believing that if after she has done everything she knows how to do she believed that god will do the rest and that's the reason why we must do everything that we know that we're supposed to do hold the children hands and pray with them read the scripture to them preparing their hearts that the seed of god the word of god the breath of god can find a place in their heart we come up with this theological number the age of accountability is 12. so until they get to 12 they are just babies when pharaoh the pharaoh sent those egyptian soldiers down there he never sent them for 13 or 14 years old when harold sent those roman soldiers at the birth of jesus he never sent them for teenagers and that's the reason why the devil has all of these things on the media because he knows if he can spoil the children's mind from a young age if he can spoil your mind from a young age the world will have no effect on them they will just come with you to church come with you to church until when they get to a certain age they say i'm not going today because the world never gets your heart if john the baptist received the holy ghost in his mother womb i believe our young people can receive the holy ghost there is no excuse our young people can receive the holy ghost if parents will get that desire whether we pray fast for their children to get the holy ghost are you looking for one super preacher we don't have him we don't have the one that all is running from their hands we must be able to work that's our inheritance because i'm telling you no matter how you are enjoying the joy of the lord when the enemy starts tempering with your children and you will not even enjoy this holy ghost that you have anymore because you will lay there and just worry and just think that's the heart of a mother let's do us all that we know how to do and leave the rest in the hands of god all of these women that was present in the upper room they had babies there were men there with their wives i don't even want a doubt in my mind if they were not someday that was pregnant but they were all waiting on the promise of the father because this faith would never be sweet can you imagine the scripture says they were hiding they were hiding and that's what happened when people are hiding they live one life before the believers and live another life when in india a different form of life they are looking over their shoulder so nobody can see them people are always hiding because the assurance the assurance christ the hope of glory needs to be birthed in our heart that's what we need as a church we need a church word all i mean all the brothers the mothers and fathers everybody just wanting more of the holy ghost because remember brother branham says that uh uh he says the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost it will be the refilling of the holy ghost so every time god filled his people that out of our balance will flow rivers of water we can never stop praying for more of the holy ghost because i will tell you every time that god takes us into a new experience is a birth a child of god is born many times some people just take the altar confession i was born again but every time that god takes you into a new experience it's a birth sometimes it's messy but you grown and when you become metro he takes you into another even the understanding of his word is at birth it's a birth when the holy spirit starts showing you things in the new testament that goes back to the old testament when he start connecting those things to your heart it's a verb it brings the joy of the lord it brings a consolation it brings strength that's the kind of a church we want where the people their heart is in the world where their heart is in the word it's not only in the emotion of the preacher how he runs down the eye and how he shout but you are listening to the word you are connected to the word the holy ghost is speaking of the very things you've been reading the very things you've been listening to he comes by he brings a preacher i don't know nothing about what you've been listening at all what you've been reading he comes and he speaks those very things to your heart job said he esteemed the word of god more than is necessary needs more than his necessary needs or we can say all laws send your power just now and baptize everyone breathe upon us praise the lord let's buy our heads together they were all in the opal chamber they were always won their call when the holy ghost descended as a promise our lord yes oh lawson power just now oh lord send the power

guide our hearts so father [Music] precious lord because that's where you put the seed of your word that's where you are dealing with us or god that's where the steve small voice speaks to us that's where decision choices are made god our hustler your prophet talks about motives and objectives purpose our desires [Music] yes father we'll bring our house to you tonight lord if the dynamics of this church is going to be the refilling of the holy ghost then we need it we need it every day we need every service we need a new outpouring of your spirit we need a new baptising lord god [Music]
