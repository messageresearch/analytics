[47:52] this morning amen the Lord bless you as
[47:55] we remain standing let's take our
[47:58] Bibles and uh we read and then we allow
[48:02] you to S sit in the comfort of your
[48:05] seats
[48:08] Amen in Luke chapter 10 in Luke chapter
[48:13] 10 it's in Luke chapter 10 we want to do
[48:17] something this morning where we just
[48:20] want to remind
[48:22] ourself
[48:25] uh it's in Luke chapter
[48:28] 10 praise the lord we greet each and
[48:32] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[48:33] Jesus it's good to see the grace of God
[48:36] on your faces amen
[48:39] hallelujah praise the
[48:42] lord it's in Luke chapter 10 Let's uh
[48:45] let's read something about the
[48:47] foundation of the
[48:51] church in Luke chapter 10 we will read
[48:54] from verse 17
[49:01] we will read from verse 17 we went over
[49:04] this before I I'm trusting the Lord to
[49:07] be able to bring it in a different way
[49:08] because that's the only thing we do in
[49:10] preaching the same message in many
[49:11] different
[49:12] ways praise the Lord
[49:15] so Luke chapter 10 verse
[49:20] 17 and the 7th returned again with
[49:24] joy they returned again with joy
[49:27] Joy saying Lord even the Devils were
[49:32] subject unto us through his name now
[49:36] what I want us to realize is this is
[49:38] before the
[49:39] atonement this is before Jesus Paid the
[49:42] price this is before even the Holy Ghost
[49:46] came and here is the devil being subject
[49:49] to the church so even with the Holy
[49:52] Ghost without the Holy Ghost the devil
[49:55] is subject to the church
[49:57] amen without the Holy Ghost the devil is
[50:00] subject to
[50:02] you praise the Lord that's what I want
[50:04] you us to realize this morning The 7even
[50:08] Returned again with Joy saying Lord even
[50:11] the devils are subject unto us through
[50:14] thy
[50:16] name and he said unto them this is
[50:19] Jesus I
[50:22] beheld Satan as
[50:25] Laing fall from
[50:28] Heaven praise the
[50:30] Lord so it's a continuous
[50:33] falling Isaiah Isaiah told us uh you
[50:37] know how he was cast in from cast from
[50:40] heaven so it's a continuous falling and
[50:43] brother bam says that's what the
[50:45] bottomless pit is it has no resting so
[50:48] it's a continuous falling so even at the
[50:52] beginning of the church before the
[50:54] atonement was given before the the
[50:56] promise of the Holy Ghost uh came Satan
[51:00] is
[51:01] falling because there's a group of
[51:03] people here that is taking position with
[51:06] the word of the hour amen there's a
[51:09] group of people here that have
[51:12] identified that Jesus was the Messiah
[51:15] that that was the promised word of the
[51:17] hour so what makes the devil to fall is
[51:21] your position with the
[51:24] word praise the Lord
[51:27] verse 19 we read behold I gave unto you
[51:33] power to tread down serpents and
[51:37] scorpions and over all the power of the
[51:42] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[51:46] hurt
[51:47] you praise the Lord not
[51:52] withstanding in this Rejoice net
[51:56] but the obvious is that's what we
[51:59] rejoice
[52:01] in but Jesus says that's not what we
[52:04] should rejoice in Praise the Lord amen
[52:09] not so much of how the devil is subject
[52:11] to us you know now so much of uh you
[52:15] know uh uh how much we Fe the the holy
[52:19] ghost moving in our vein like an
[52:22] electric now we're standing in this
[52:25] Rejoice net
[52:27] that the spirits are subject unto you
[52:30] but rather
[52:31] Rejoice because your names are written
[52:36] in
[52:38] heaven praise the Lord and in that hour
[52:42] Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I
[52:45] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and
[52:49] Earth that thou has hid these things
[52:53] from the the wise in prudent and have re

[55:25] the year the the weather is changing
[55:28] we're getting into to summer summer is
[55:31] always a busy time praise the Lord and
[55:34] uh so uh we you know we we plan a lot of
[55:38] things uh uh you know to to get across
[55:41] the street greet the neighbors and you
[55:43] know and different things we want to do
[55:46] so but as a church there are few things
[55:48] also we want to go after over over if
[55:51] you realize we've been uh couple of
[55:53] weeks we've been go playing the church
[55:55] all
[55:57] uh
[55:58] uh uh uh both uh the first and uh and
[56:04] and also the the second Church order
[56:06] there and uh uh the reason we're doing
[56:10] it is because uh we just want to remind
[56:12] ourself amen we want to remind ourself
[56:16] and uh uh so there are few things I want
[56:19] to go over before I get into what I want
[56:22] to share with you this morning but it's
[56:25] all part of uh it's all part of the word
[56:28] it's all part of the word because uh
[56:30] just like we have read to you this
[56:32] morning you see that Jesus right from
[56:35] the from the emphasis of the church you
[56:37] know from uh the very beginning of the
[56:40] church before even the uh the church
[56:44] will be set in order or the you know the
[56:47] Holy Ghost will come he's he's trying to
[56:51] positionally place the people what they
[56:52] should pay attention
[56:54] to praise the Lord
[56:56] what they should pay attention to and
[57:00] with with uh uh uh you know uh without
[57:04] there a lot of those things even went
[57:05] over the heads of the disciples but when
[57:08] the Holy Ghost came then the Holy Ghost
[57:10] started to remind them of the things
[57:13] that Jesus said because that's what he
[57:15] said the Holy Ghost would do it would
[57:17] bring to it would bring us to
[57:19] remembrance amen it will bring to
[57:21] remembrance the things that were said so
[57:24] this morning uh just for the little
[57:26] exhortation we want to speak on
[57:28] rejoicing in the
[57:30] truth rejoicing in the truth Rejoice now
[57:34] because uh demons are subject unto you
[57:37] but Rejoice because your name is written
[57:40] in heaven praise the Lord so we want to
[57:44] we want to speak on rejoicing in the
[57:47] truth that's that's actually where our
[57:49] joy is it's in the truth it's in the
[57:52] revealed word it's in the things that
[57:54] God is revealing to us as we are seeing
[57:57] our trueu identity praise the Lord but
[58:01] before we go into that like I said we've
[58:03] been impl the church order I want to go
[58:06] over few things that I think are very
[58:10] necessary for us as a church one of the
[58:13] things there is
[58:15] that that I have seen that is not only
[58:18] with this local assembly is something
[58:20] that is that is becoming you know uh uh
[58:23] uh uh everywhere is becoming in
[58:26] everywhere and uh uh what I've been
[58:29] paying attention to as we we've been
[58:32] playing this uh uh series of the church
[58:34] order is How We Begin our
[58:38] service how the service begin very very
[58:42] important because you remember at the
[58:44] beginning of the year we took a series
[58:47] on in the
[58:48] beginning and we said the beginning of
[58:51] everything is very important how the
[58:54] service begins
[58:56] how are we being instructed to begin the
[59:00] service is very
[59:03] important praise the Lord because no
[59:05] matter what we do we can blast the music
[59:09] we can run around the art if we don't
[59:11] have a good beginning we would just go
[59:15] home so
[59:16] tired amen it would just be all of our
[59:20] flesh in it and we year for one purpose
[59:25] and is to Worship the Lord
[59:27] amen we want to see him coming down in
[59:31] our midst we want to see you know uh uh
[59:35] the the the the effect of his presence
[59:38] we want to see God moving in a special
[59:41] way praise the Lord are we together so
[59:46] uh uh as as as uh went back steing
[59:49] through the the message of the hour I
[59:52] realized that one thing that is
[59:55] beginning to to to be overlooked is uh
[59:58] uh you know brother Brandon said uh uh
[1:00:02] you know when when those doors are open
[1:00:04] he says uh you know if we have the grace
[1:00:07] to to wait until those doors are open
[1:00:10] this morning you will see that he uh
[1:00:13] they were playing the second Church
[1:00:15] order I think the 1963 series and much
[1:00:18] of that brother brandom spent on talking
[1:00:21] about gifts and Ministry he talking
[1:00:24] about different Ministry the people with
[1:00:27] gifts of speaking in tongues prophecy
[1:00:29] and all of that so if you go to that one
[1:00:31] you will see a whole lot of that but
[1:00:33] what I pick up this morning while I was
[1:00:36] in the office listening as
[1:00:38] well he also identify he says those
[1:00:42] things are
[1:00:43] Ministry and and and we have a Ministry
[1:00:47] of opening the
[1:00:49] service and that Ministry is to come and
[1:00:54] uh and
[1:00:57] pray the 30 minutes of the service is
[1:01:01] actually when those doors open and we
[1:01:05] come into the building the truth of the
[1:01:07] matter there is that the service has
[1:01:10] already
[1:01:13] began the people that open the Service
[1:01:16] are the people that come and
[1:01:20] pray they come they s they pray you are
[1:01:25] actually opening the the
[1:01:27] service praise the Lord you will soon
[1:01:30] see where I'm going with this you you
[1:01:32] are actually opening the service and you
[1:01:35] see it's a it's a kind of a Ministry
[1:01:38] that is
[1:01:40] overlooked praise the Lord and sometimes
[1:01:43] it thinks we think that they have so
[1:01:46] much time on their
[1:01:49] hands and they come
[1:01:53] early but that's when the service opens
[1:01:56] because what I have realized and we will
[1:01:59] look through the scripture a little bit
[1:02:01] is that uh this last day church I'm
[1:02:06] talking about the church the last day
[1:02:08] Church brother brand want us to watch
[1:02:10] the last day Spirit the last day church
[1:02:12] has changed the order of
[1:02:15] worship the order of worship in the
[1:02:19] scripture is
[1:02:20] prayer the word before praise
[1:02:29] praise the Lord
[1:02:32] amen why because
[1:02:35] praise is uh is is the people are
[1:02:39] rejoicing in their
[1:02:42] Victory when the soldiers are going to
[1:02:44] war that's why we sang their son God has
[1:02:47] an army and in that Army I am a part
[1:02:50] praise the Lord I hope you are a part
[1:02:52] too amen when the when when when the men
[1:02:56] are about to go to
[1:02:58] war you find that they you know the the
[1:03:03] they are they concentrated they thinking
[1:03:05] you know their minds and it's after the
[1:03:08] battle is over they comes back rejoicing
[1:03:11] you know because they have won the
[1:03:14] victory so that is that is the thing I
[1:03:16] have seen twisted around and most of
[1:03:20] that has come from our church word
[1:03:26] praise the Lord amen most of that has
[1:03:29] come from the church world because uh uh
[1:03:33] you know uh uh uh in the way that things
[1:03:36] have been set up and the way that they
[1:03:38] do it there is that uh you know uh uh we
[1:03:43] we we we play the music We Sing We we
[1:03:45] get the people rejoicing and worshiping
[1:03:48] the Lord you know uh uh and then we
[1:03:50] preach the word and then what happened
[1:03:53] is that uh after
[1:03:56] uh you know uh we prayed so the word you
[1:04:00] know can take effect in our life Lord
[1:04:02] you know uh let the word have that but
[1:04:05] you see the thing that is that you are
[1:04:07] not the planting of the word you the
[1:04:09] planter of the
[1:04:10] word praise the Lord as as as we sit
[1:04:15] under the
[1:04:17] word and the word being preached to
[1:04:20] us it is almost like the natural food
[1:04:24] that we eat
[1:04:26] when we eat that food chew it and send
[1:04:28] it down as it enter into our system God
[1:04:32] has designed our system to be able to
[1:04:36] take the different parts of the food and
[1:04:39] distribute it to our body so there's a
[1:04:43] whole lot that goes on in our stomach
[1:04:45] than in our
[1:04:47] mouth we have to do a good work to break
[1:04:50] it down and chew it but when it gets in
[1:04:53] our stomach God have set an
[1:04:56] other of how the nutrients will be
[1:04:59] pulled out and What needs to go to the
[1:05:02] blood what the liver would you know will
[1:05:04] benefit from and what the different
[1:05:06] cells our of our body would benefit from
[1:05:10] and then what our body don't need God
[1:05:13] also have designed it how to get it out
[1:05:15] of our
[1:05:17] system praise the Lord and that is the
[1:05:20] same way that he deals with his church
[1:05:22] when the word is preached and we receive
[1:05:26] the word he have already designed and
[1:05:29] assigned the Holy Ghost how to be able
[1:05:33] to allow Thy word to deal with
[1:05:37] us praise the Lord amen most of the time
[1:05:41] we think they are the I'm not I'm not
[1:05:43] blasting against this don't don't I'm
[1:05:46] really been praying this weekend Lord
[1:05:49] let the people not misunderstand me
[1:05:51] praise the Lord amen and uh uh uh in as
[1:05:55] much as uh you know uh the the the the
[1:05:59] the the the beauty the joy we want to
[1:06:01] remind ourself when when we take notes
[1:06:04] that's a beautiful thing to do you take
[1:06:07] that into your own meditation you go
[1:06:09] around it but that is not when the Holy
[1:06:11] Ghost is dealing with
[1:06:13] you praise the
[1:06:15] Lord
[1:06:17] amen when we sit under the word uh uh uh
[1:06:21] uh in Mark chapter 5 the Bible says what
[1:06:23] Jesus taught why he taught why the the
[1:06:28] the teaching of the world was going on
[1:06:30] he says the people were
[1:06:37] healed are we
[1:06:39] together so I I get in preaching and
[1:06:42] then get out of what I want what what
[1:06:44] the way I wanted to St so uh the thing
[1:06:47] about it there is that uh uh you know is
[1:06:52] uh we we we want to be grateful you know
[1:06:55] and appreciate you know those that the
[1:06:57] Lord has given the grace that has been
[1:06:59] you know that that are able to come you
[1:07:01] know early and and just sit in their
[1:07:04] seats pray for the service thank the
[1:07:07] Lord for being here you know bringing us
[1:07:09] here pray for those that are on their
[1:07:11] way coming as as uh you know uh uh
[1:07:17] uh as humble and simple that I say is
[1:07:22] very very important for this service
[1:07:26] praise the Lord many times we think is
[1:07:29] when the song leader comes up here
[1:07:32] that's when the service begin
[1:07:35] no one thing you will now find in the
[1:07:37] church order looking both of them you
[1:07:39] find it please bring it to me I'm
[1:07:41] learning also brother Bram never talks
[1:07:43] about opening
[1:07:49] prayer you'll never find it in the
[1:07:51] church
[1:07:52] order why because the T Mees is the
[1:07:56] opening
[1:07:57] prayer you are opening the
[1:08:01] service praise the Lord it is just as
[1:08:05] important when you come walk through
[1:08:08] those doors and and you sit to your seat
[1:08:10] or kneel down whichever position you
[1:08:12] take and commit the service in the hands
[1:08:14] of the Lord it is just as important as
[1:08:18] if a brother says brother Steven or
[1:08:20] brother Hillary please come and open the
[1:08:23] Service the service has already been
[1:08:30] open it has already been
[1:08:33] open praise the Lord now you will see
[1:08:36] that is the reason
[1:08:39] why he says the people comes into the
[1:08:42] Tabernacle 30 minutes you know sit down
[1:08:45] prayed he says read the Bible or you
[1:08:47] know as the Lord will place on your
[1:08:49] heart he says and let the organist
[1:08:51] begins to
[1:08:53] play praise the Lord
[1:08:57] let the organist begin to pray
[1:09:00] play now the church word has given us a
[1:09:04] a a system where you know it's it's
[1:09:07] written down you go in the denomination
[1:09:10] churches you will find other of
[1:09:12] service order of service opening prayer
[1:09:16] first scripture reading second scripture
[1:09:18] reading choir special and that those are
[1:09:21] the order of service
[1:09:26] praise the
[1:09:28] Lord are we
[1:09:32] together so what happened is that uh uh
[1:09:36] uh uh
[1:09:39] because that uh uh ton time that that
[1:09:43] meditation time we call it is is is
[1:09:46] being overlooked so many of the times
[1:09:49] when we come and open the Service in the
[1:09:51] way that we've been doing it you find
[1:09:53] that not only this Tabernacle you find
[1:09:55] it many places around the message praise
[1:09:59] the Lord then a brother we say what you
[1:10:02] know what brother Joel pleas uh we ask
[1:10:04] brother Joel to come and open the
[1:10:05] Service he comes up you know Lord thank
[1:10:07] you for being here we invite your spirit
[1:10:10] Lord you know we rebuke the devil from
[1:10:12] Over the people Lord God and uh we just
[1:10:15] uh you know uh that's
[1:10:19] wonderful but that's what the T me is
[1:10:21] for
[1:10:29] because that is the order of
[1:10:33] worship I will show you something in the
[1:10:36] book of Acts Acts chapter 16 let's look
[1:10:38] there I don't want to get out of track
[1:10:41] this morning but uh uh I want to do my
[1:10:44] best to be able to ask chapter
[1:10:50] 16 we'll ask the preachers to preach but
[1:10:54] uh for now
[1:11:00] we had a good service with brother dicks
[1:11:02] last week amen we had a good service
[1:11:05] just like I said Wednesday night I
[1:11:06] forget to ask him to leave that amen
[1:11:08] thing with
[1:11:11] me praise the
[1:11:14] Lord I forgot to ask him because the way
[1:11:18] he printed it out if he will have left
[1:11:20] it here you would never forget any time
[1:11:22] I lift that thing up you will noce
[1:11:24] Brother D if I do my own it will be an
[1:11:28] impersonation Acts chapter
[1:11:31] 16 let's look at verse
[1:11:35] 16 Acts chapter 16 verse 16 and it came
[1:11:39] to
[1:11:40] pass as we went to
[1:11:44] prayer watch this now as we went to
[1:11:48] prayer a setting Dam it
[1:11:50] possessed with uh a spirit or divination
[1:11:54] met us which brought her master much
[1:11:57] gain by SM saying praise the
[1:12:01] Lord and you know the story what
[1:12:04] happened after that Paul had to cast
[1:12:06] that Spirit out of the Gil amen I did
[1:12:10] that I I used that just to show that uh
[1:12:15] that's what praying
[1:12:16] does
[1:12:18] amen and that's why the service begin
[1:12:22] with their praying because it cleans the
[1:12:26] atmosphere praise the Lord amen it
[1:12:30] prepare the place of worship you know
[1:12:32] push back one of the one of the the the
[1:12:37] uh famous scripture that is used uh uh
[1:12:42] we sang there this morning I bless your
[1:12:44] name Paul and Salas you know uh it's
[1:12:47] it's it's right here this was the act
[1:12:50] that makes them to be
[1:12:52] arrested before they were put in prison
[1:12:55] so if if you just read that I'm I'm just
[1:12:58] trying to go over this before I get into
[1:13:00] the word this morning if you just read
[1:13:02] that and you go down to verse 25 you
[1:13:05] will see something
[1:13:11] also and at midnight Paul and Salah
[1:13:14] prayed and sang praises to the Lord so
[1:13:17] Praises don't come before
[1:13:20] prayer prayer always proceed the word
[1:13:25] word and
[1:13:28] Praises are we
[1:13:31] together and that's the reason why that
[1:13:35] time of the service is very
[1:13:38] important I told the told the the the
[1:13:41] brothers we have a uh officers meeting
[1:13:44] uh now uh officers workers which
[1:13:47] whichever way and uh uh because uh we
[1:13:50] will we try to approach it the the you
[1:13:52] know the clothes the better way that we
[1:13:54] know how to do I'm not going to uh stop
[1:13:57] some service praise the Lord don't don't
[1:13:59] think that we would not have some
[1:14:00] service no you know but uh uh I would
[1:14:04] just I would just want us to be to be
[1:14:07] very conscious of uh uh you know uh
[1:14:11] trying to approach the service the right
[1:14:13] way praise the Lord amen are we together
[1:14:19] because you know what what I've seen is
[1:14:21] that uh uh uh when and when what we have
[1:14:26] as an auth does not happen it looks like
[1:14:31] oh we begin the service and it didn't
[1:14:33] and we didn't
[1:14:37] pray amen We Begin the service and we
[1:14:40] didn't pray why because we have Overlook
[1:14:44] the prayer
[1:14:48] time if you have noticed it on that even
[1:14:51] on Wednesday
[1:14:53] night when we have have a prayer meeting
[1:14:56] what is normally done in the church word
[1:14:59] is that the message is preached on a
[1:15:01] Prayer meeting then the church goes into
[1:15:04] praying I don't approach it like that if
[1:15:07] you notice on Wednesday night we start
[1:15:10] our prayer meeting before I
[1:15:16] preach praise the Lord I remember one
[1:15:19] one time a few years ago one brother
[1:15:21] visited us and and Wednesday night I
[1:15:23] told him we having a prayer meeting you
[1:15:25] know and then uh we will have the prayer
[1:15:27] meeting and then we will call you up to
[1:15:30] preach so uh you know I came and started
[1:15:34] the service that Wednesday night and
[1:15:36] then took a few prayer requests we when
[1:15:38] he came up to preach he preach and
[1:15:41] started preparing us for prayer
[1:15:45] meeting praise the Lord and then when we
[1:15:49] when we finish uh uh when he finished
[1:15:51] preaching I came and closed the service
[1:15:53] now after the service he said I told you
[1:15:55] said you were having prayer meeting I
[1:15:56] said yeah we have prayer
[1:15:59] meeting he said Oh I thought I was going
[1:16:02] to preach before the prayer meeting we
[1:16:03] will have stay here until
[1:16:09] 11:00 are we
[1:16:12] together praise the Lord because you see
[1:16:15] it it's it's it's it's easy if you don't
[1:16:19] pay
[1:16:20] attention we we see those things we
[1:16:23] admire it
[1:16:25] and we think that it's
[1:16:30] effective and pretty soon I mean we we
[1:16:33] we want to we we we you know we want to
[1:16:37] uh uh uh you know uh because most of the
[1:16:40] time people thingss like that you know
[1:16:42] I've heard I've had people appr me says
[1:16:45] well you know we we we really don't have
[1:16:47] prayer
[1:16:49] meeting every time you say we having
[1:16:51] prayer meeting we don't have prayer
[1:16:52] meeting God people don't pray
[1:16:57] you see if we have if we have by God's
[1:17:00] grace have developed uh our
[1:17:04] individual prayer life like brother
[1:17:07] Brandon would say if we are prayed
[1:17:09] up even if we come and spend five
[1:17:12] minutes it will be effective
[1:17:17] yes praise the
[1:17:20] Lord amen because by God's grace you
[1:17:25] have already have your key how to enter
[1:17:28] we will not have to drag you to
[1:17:32] enter what brother Bram talks about
[1:17:34] prayer meeting he says there uh you know
[1:17:38] uh he he he term it as a special
[1:17:44] meeting it maybe when we set a time to
[1:17:47] you know set up a time and and you know
[1:17:49] we just want to pray that yeah that can
[1:17:52] be
[1:17:53] done but when we are bringing you know a
[1:17:56] time of a song service the preaching of
[1:17:59] the word and then there's a you know
[1:18:01] before you realize is that if if you
[1:18:04] actually want to be
[1:18:06] sincere you'll realize that after we go
[1:18:10] through worshiping the Lord the the the
[1:18:12] preacher come and and and and preach the
[1:18:15] word that your body is already
[1:18:22] exhausted praise the Lord
[1:18:27] because many times we think that it is
[1:18:30] those things that we do that make know
[1:18:34] is the work of the Holy
[1:18:39] Spirit to deal with
[1:18:43] us are we together are you understanding
[1:18:47] what I'm going this morning praise the
[1:18:49] Lord
[1:18:52] amen so you see that t minutes he says
[1:18:55] everyone you know comes and wait on
[1:18:57] their Ministry the the musicians must
[1:19:00] wait on their Ministry and they wa to
[1:19:01] wait before the Lord generally you take
[1:19:03] it through the scripture waiting means
[1:19:07] praying they that wait on the Lord shall
[1:19:10] renew their strength it does not means
[1:19:12] sitting down and
[1:19:14] staring waiting in the scripture means
[1:19:16] to pray the way we wait on God is
[1:19:23] praying praise the Lord so the way we
[1:19:26] wait on our ministry is to pray and ask
[1:19:29] the Lord Lord make me the blessing this
[1:19:31] morning as I go up to lead the songs
[1:19:33] make me a blessing as I as I play the
[1:19:35] instrument and and you know and and all
[1:19:37] of that praise the Lord because all of
[1:19:40] those things are Ministry even the
[1:19:43] people that comes and open the door open
[1:19:45] the Service sit here and pray before we
[1:19:49] come in it's a Ministry
[1:19:55] those are the things where brother
[1:19:56] brandham says is the ministry behind the
[1:20:00] curtains he said the success of my
[1:20:02] Ministry is those people behind the
[1:20:08] curtains which of course is the one that
[1:20:10] we don't
[1:20:13] see we see the musician we see the the
[1:20:16] the the pastor preaching we see all of
[1:20:18] those on but the people that are behind
[1:20:21] the curtains the ones that wait on the
[1:20:24] Lord L the ones that you know that that
[1:20:27] intercede and and and and uh uh uh uh
[1:20:30] those that's the engine
[1:20:33] room that's the engine room praise the
[1:20:36] Lord that's the reason why your your car
[1:20:39] hood is
[1:20:41] covered what carry that car is that
[1:20:45] engine the engine is never seen it's
[1:20:48] behind the
[1:20:52] curtains are we together
[1:20:56] praise the Lord are we
[1:21:01] together that's the thing that create
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:05] atmosphere that's the thing that's
[1:21:07] that's the spiritual warfare those are
[1:21:09] the people that comes in and and fight
[1:21:12] the enemy and you know and and and
[1:21:14] rebuke the devil and then we we com in
[1:21:17] and you know and we go right into the
[1:21:19] the the praise and worship the preaching
[1:21:21] of the word and many
[1:21:26] times we don't realize
[1:21:29] that we don't realize even the people
[1:21:32] that do it don't realize that you have a
[1:21:39] Ministry you have a
[1:21:44] Ministry praise the Lord the burden that
[1:21:48] God will place on your heart to come
[1:21:52] early and just pray and just commit the
[1:21:55] service in the Lord sit right in your
[1:21:57] seat take your Bible it's very simple in
[1:22:00] in one
[1:22:01] sense you know you you you try to use
[1:22:04] that as your own time to prepare
[1:22:07] yourself as you are preparing yourself
[1:22:10] you are preparing the
[1:22:11] service if you listen carefully this
[1:22:14] morning he says he says just the same
[1:22:16] thing that the minister would do he must
[1:22:19] wait on the
[1:22:21] Lord praise the Lord that's the same
[1:22:24] thing you do when you come to
[1:22:27] church you wait on the
[1:22:30] Lord praise the Lord no doubt uh uh our
[1:22:34] little assembly is spread about over the
[1:22:36] city amen if if if the lord gave us
[1:22:39] Grace it would be very easy to conquer
[1:22:42] Minneapolis very very easy brother
[1:22:46] Wesley and sister uh Cara are coming
[1:22:48] from
[1:22:49] Briner uh brother Jordan and his wife
[1:22:52] coming from St Cloud brother Steven bir
[1:22:55] and his family somewhere there in
[1:22:57] Wisconsin brother Ben and his family
[1:23:00] brother uh uh desima they com in from
[1:23:02] Rochester I mean we spread about we have
[1:23:05] uh these other young people coming from
[1:23:07] Meo Minnesota is surrounded Minneapolis
[1:23:10] is
[1:23:11] surrounding it will be easy to conquer
[1:23:14] the
[1:23:15] city if we only know what we are called
[1:23:19] to
[1:23:20] do if we only know that where we are
[1:23:24] place is not just a living
[1:23:27] place but we have a
[1:23:31] responsibility praise the Lord do you
[1:23:34] believe that we can conquer this
[1:23:36] [Laughter]
[1:23:40] city so you see that that make it in a
[1:23:44] place that many drives an hour hour plus
[1:23:48] two hours to be able to make it to come
[1:23:50] to the service that's a great sacrifice
[1:23:55] that's a great sacrifice it must never
[1:23:57] be taken
[1:24:02] lightly that in this day and
[1:24:06] age where at every turning corner there
[1:24:09] is a
[1:24:10] church that a person would drive an hour
[1:24:13] an hour plus two
[1:24:15] hours just to come to this Square
[1:24:20] building praise the Lord
[1:24:25] you see and that's the reason why I
[1:24:27] think you know is it's it's it's our
[1:24:30] responsibility to be able to uh you know
[1:24:35] uh uh uh remind ourselves what we are
[1:24:39] called to
[1:24:42] do
[1:24:44] amen the day that we are not in service
[1:24:46] and and uh uh we come here Wednesday
[1:24:49] night Sunday morning unless we have a a
[1:24:51] preacher in town and do it a Saturday
[1:24:53] night s but uh just
[1:24:57] imagine we have prayers going on all
[1:25:00] around the city when you sit in your
[1:25:03] home you are not just having your own
[1:25:07] private
[1:25:09] devotion you are not just you know
[1:25:11] reading your Bible and prayed and say
[1:25:13] Lord you know pray that bless my family
[1:25:16] and all of that and then you say Lord uh
[1:25:18] remember our little church bless the
[1:25:20] brothers and sisters I mean uh I mean I
[1:25:23] mean it's it's it's that's a
[1:25:29] blessing are we
[1:25:32] together are you seeing where I'm going
[1:25:34] this
[1:25:41] morning it's a spiritual responsibility
[1:25:44] it's a Ministry it's a Ministry behind
[1:25:47] the
[1:25:48] curtains amen it's a Ministry behind the
[1:25:51] curtain so we talk we'll talk with the
[1:25:53] brothers you know because I feel that uh
[1:25:57] you know we can we can approach things a
[1:25:59] little bit different in the light of the
[1:26:01] word and then uh uh we can do it better
[1:26:05] praise the
[1:26:06] Lord does that mean we will not call a
[1:26:09] brother to come and pray yes we will do
[1:26:11] and uh what is done in uh uh most of the
[1:26:15] time is that that person should come and
[1:26:17] take up the special
[1:26:19] request maybe saints come in the right
[1:26:22] special request then Deacon should be
[1:26:25] called or one of the brothers should be
[1:26:26] called and say brother Wesley we have
[1:26:28] some special needs here can you take
[1:26:30] that to the Lord in prayer but that's
[1:26:33] not the opening of the
[1:26:35] service the service are already been
[1:26:38] open that's why when we walk through
[1:26:40] those doors we must be
[1:26:42] referenced the space back there I mean
[1:26:45] we must greet one another with a holy
[1:26:47] case that's what the scripture says but
[1:26:49] it's not a place for us to be lecturing
[1:26:51] and yelling and all of that when people
[1:26:53] are in here you know praying and you
[1:26:56] know when uh no there's not a place for
[1:26:58] us to do
[1:27:00] that you know we greet one another that
[1:27:03] yeah it must be done nicely
[1:27:09] quietly are we
[1:27:11] together praise the
[1:27:13] Lord because you see that we come in
[1:27:17] into the house of the Lord uh uh uh am I
[1:27:20] preaching this morning
[1:27:24] a different way that's so I will tell
[1:27:26] you what happened uh you know I'm trying
[1:27:28] to be very slow this morning Wednesday
[1:27:30] night I was I was actually I was very
[1:27:33] word instructed you know when I was
[1:27:36] preaching I was I was I was a little bit
[1:27:40] disturbed uh uh I've been I've been
[1:27:43] having uh you know uh changes in my body
[1:27:47] something was happening to me that I did
[1:27:50] not know what happening until the last
[1:27:52] time I went for my physical
[1:27:54] almost like uh uh like an icid reflex
[1:27:58] but I got an infection in my stomach and
[1:28:01] that's the thing that been battering my
[1:28:03] throat my voice I did not I did not know
[1:28:06] so Wednesday when I was
[1:28:08] preaching uh uh I felt a uh you know
[1:28:13] kind of a sharp pain that went through
[1:28:15] my chest twice I didn't wanted to scare
[1:28:18] you you didn't know nothing about it so
[1:28:20] I I still close to this place I said I
[1:28:23] got to hold on to this poop it if I'm
[1:28:24] about to fall you know and all of that
[1:28:27] so it really bothered me it threw me off
[1:28:30] so uh uh if you if you really observe me
[1:28:33] Wednesday night you will know that uh I
[1:28:35] was repeating myself because I was
[1:28:37] thinking what is happening here what is
[1:28:40] going on here with me twice that
[1:28:42] happened to me so Thursday I was
[1:28:44] supposed to travel for the wedding I
[1:28:46] canceled the trip and I just thought
[1:28:48] that I needed to observe myself a little
[1:28:50] bit went to uh an orent kid and and I
[1:28:54] found that it was that uh uh gas that
[1:28:58] was moving up to my heart my heart is
[1:29:00] okay they told me I could live a little
[1:29:01] bit longer
[1:29:04] so
[1:29:05] [Laughter]
[1:29:07] amen so it was that it was that gas that
[1:29:10] was moving in my in my chest but uh so
[1:29:18] uh you my wife kept asking me are you
[1:29:20] okay I said yeah I'm
[1:29:22] fine I didn't want to scare you people
[1:29:25] so and uh uh but the Lord is good amen
[1:29:29] the Lord is good the Lord is good and we
[1:29:31] thank the Lord for that so I I hope you
[1:29:34] understanding what I'm goinging this
[1:29:35] morning we we you know we have a
[1:29:37] responsibility it's not uh it's not uh
[1:29:40] you know like Jesus said you know uh
[1:29:43] it's not uh uh you know the the the
[1:29:47] shouting that we do and you know we must
[1:29:49] we must Rejoice you know like last
[1:29:51] Sunday we had a blast I just Joy how the
[1:29:55] Holy Spirit had the Liberty amen I mean
[1:29:57] we were rejoicing in the word and that
[1:30:00] is where our rejoicing should be in the
[1:30:03] word you know we must be rejoicing in
[1:30:06] the word so that's that's just a few
[1:30:08] things that I wanted to go over as we go
[1:30:11] as we go on you will you will you will
[1:30:14] realize let's look at Matthew chapter
[1:30:17] 26:3 another scripture in the Bible that
[1:30:19] is very very well overlooked and uh uh
[1:30:27] Matthew Chapter 26:
[1:30:32] 30 I could say this pray close the
[1:30:34] service and go
[1:30:48] home praise the
[1:30:50] Lord amen
[1:30:54] if you look closely this was just after
[1:30:56] the communion the Bible says here and
[1:31:00] when they had sunk a him they went
[1:31:05] out pay attention to
[1:31:09] that the entire service of the communion
[1:31:12] has already gone on Jesus has preached
[1:31:15] he has ministered the communion and then
[1:31:18] Praises came
[1:31:20] after when they have sank him the went
[1:31:26] out praise the
[1:31:29] Lord amen are we
[1:31:39] together so yeah so there they are just
[1:31:42] they are just uh you know all of those
[1:31:44] uh things we want to pay attention to
[1:31:47] you know we want to pay attention to to
[1:31:49] know that uh uh and and you know what
[1:31:51] what I've also realized is that uh
[1:31:55] sometimes it's the people that just come
[1:31:57] in the middle of the service you know
[1:31:59] and then they just feel like the service
[1:32:01] has stayed so long and they never even
[1:32:05] remember that there were people that
[1:32:06] were here before they
[1:32:10] came praise the
[1:32:18] Lord so we we will we will we will
[1:32:22] realize and and and want to appreciate
[1:32:25] you know that God has given us uh an
[1:32:28] order to be able to approach
[1:32:30] him praise the Lord amen we be he had
[1:32:35] given us an order we we want to do the
[1:32:37] best you know that's what the prophet
[1:32:39] told us he said come back to that TP
[1:32:40] play it again you know uh and and remind
[1:32:43] yourself you know as long as we stayed
[1:32:46] in this life we will be we we have been
[1:32:48] taught to be reminded and that's what I
[1:32:51] wanted to do this morning to remind you
[1:32:53] that that uh uh the order of worship
[1:32:56] look through the scripture I have a lot
[1:32:57] of scriptures written down here and uh
[1:33:00] uh has always been you know prayer has
[1:33:04] always been the preparation for the
[1:33:06] people to go into
[1:33:09] war amen and then when the people are
[1:33:12] returning back from war after the word
[1:33:14] has been preached and we been we have
[1:33:16] identified ourself with the word you
[1:33:19] know we have uh we have uh uh uh you
[1:33:21] know uh uh uh Reb nuke the enime you
[1:33:24] know and and then uh we realize we get
[1:33:27] the victory you know I mean we can stay
[1:33:29] 3 hours in
[1:33:31] sink we can take stay you know two hours
[1:33:34] and sing if if we have the time if we
[1:33:37] have the anointing to do but you realize
[1:33:40] that uh uh the church word takes all of
[1:33:44] the time in the music they sing the
[1:33:46] music they dance and and when it comes
[1:33:49] to the
[1:33:51] word it's just 50 minutes
[1:33:56] why because the people are already
[1:34:00] tired they are they are tired and you
[1:34:03] know uh uh uh and then it comes to the
[1:34:06] word you know we just we just uh uh read
[1:34:08] a scripture you know uh uh you know uh
[1:34:11] remind our said a few things and then we
[1:34:13] go
[1:34:17] home I'm saying this because like I said
[1:34:20] it's not only our assembly it's
[1:34:22] something that is beginning to creep in
[1:34:24] a little bit We complain when the word
[1:34:27] is
[1:34:29] preached when that music is going on oh
[1:34:33] man oh man praise the
[1:34:40] lord it's either about how loud our
[1:34:43] music can be or how fast we can sing and
[1:34:46] how we can move our body and all of that
[1:34:49] but sometimes we just need the Stillness
[1:34:52] of the music we just need to
[1:34:55] worship our minds need to concentrate on
[1:34:58] what we are
[1:35:01] singing We need to enter in with
[1:35:05] him praise the
[1:35:07] Lord you need to be singing where you
[1:35:09] can embrace the Lord you feel his
[1:35:12] embrace you feel his
[1:35:16] closeness praise the
[1:35:21] Lord so this morning we want want to

[1:35:47] to me to see that I stay with the word
[1:35:50] I'm looking to you to see that you carry
[1:35:53] it out praise the Lord now so you will
[1:35:57] see John said it in another way over in

[1:36:14] children rejoicing in the
[1:36:18] truth praise the

[1:36:27] that I preach these things I'm looking
[1:36:28] out to you to see that you carry out so
[1:36:31] what happen is that uh uh uh the the

[1:36:40] the people taking victory in the
[1:36:44] word praise the
[1:36:46] lord it's not how you know how much I
[1:36:50] can come and and recul and rebuke you
[1:36:53] and that it's not the thing that makes
[1:36:55] me joy that brings me
[1:36:58] joy I see I I I have joy when when I can
[1:37:03] when I can see
[1:37:05] you taking position in the
[1:37:09] word knowing that there are lot of
[1:37:11] things that you are dealing with but I
[1:37:13] see grace helping
[1:37:21] you praise the Lord are we
[1:37:25] together we continue to read here he
[1:37:27] says
[1:37:29] uh and keep it spiritual now remember
[1:37:32] all the forces all the dark kingdom of
[1:37:35] Satan will turn against you as you begin
[1:37:39] to grow in the
[1:37:42] Lord and that's what we doing as a
[1:37:45] church we are
[1:37:48] growing amen growing in the Lord is not
[1:37:51] about the members it is how much we are
[1:37:55] identifying with this word is how much
[1:37:58] we know that we have an
[1:38:01] inheritance how much we know that uh uh
[1:38:05] uh a word has been given us the message
[1:38:07] of the hour that God is looking for men
[1:38:10] and women that can stand for his
[1:38:13] word and as you begin to
[1:38:16] grow that's when your spiritual battles
[1:38:19] will
[1:38:20] begin amen if you think you don't have
[1:38:24] none you are not growing you are still a
[1:38:25] baby Satan don't play around
[1:38:28] babies he played around
[1:38:31] Sons because he knows that the
[1:38:34] inheritance are for
[1:38:37] Sons inheritance are not given to you
[1:38:39] when you are baby you will eat that
[1:38:41] paper t p in the
[1:38:45] trash praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:38:49] why the father hire a tutor
[1:38:54] when the boy start paying attention to
[1:38:57] his father inheritance the father set
[1:39:00] from far he look at the sons and try to
[1:39:04] see which one have an
[1:39:06] interest in protecting what belongs to
[1:39:09] the
[1:39:11] family praise the Lord and as much as
[1:39:14] the father is looking the devil is also
[1:39:17] looking who having an
[1:39:21] interest and is that very one that he
[1:39:27] attacks praise the Lord amen look at the
[1:39:32] story of the prodal
[1:39:36] son it looks like the younger son or the
[1:39:40] one that went away he was he was he was
[1:39:42] he was ruling and uh you know uh uh uh
[1:39:46] and uh you know he he went and wasted
[1:39:48] the father inheritance that's truth
[1:39:53] praise the
[1:39:56] Lord amen but as you look in the story
[1:39:59] then you look at a closing you will
[1:40:02] realize even the one that have stayed
[1:40:05] home that stayed home you know that he
[1:40:08] tried to do everything to please the
[1:40:10] father he never saw the value of how
[1:40:13] much the father
[1:40:17] have praise the Lord he was more about
[1:40:21] pleasing the father than protect
[1:40:23] protecting The
[1:40:28] Inheritance if you don't if you don't
[1:40:30] see the value of what you have there is
[1:40:34] no way you can fight for
[1:40:37] it if you don't see the value of living
[1:40:41] a decent life there is no way you can
[1:40:43] fight for
[1:40:45] it if you think the people that are out
[1:40:49] there you know undressing thems and with
[1:40:51] every the faction out there are better
[1:40:54] than you that's where you will drift
[1:40:58] to because it's in every one of us to be
[1:41:01] better we desire to be
[1:41:06] better but when if you have the you you
[1:41:09] you have recognized the the the the
[1:41:12] value of what you have that in the day
[1:41:16] and age like this you have have the
[1:41:20] grace to be able to live a v
[1:41:23] life amen that a young woman would take
[1:41:27] to herself and uh not kissing everybody
[1:41:30] in the
[1:41:31] street
[1:41:33] amen if I kisse the body will be the one
[1:41:36] before the altar let my first case be be
[1:41:39] before the
[1:41:41] altar if that is not of value to you you
[1:41:44] will not fight for it you will not fight
[1:41:46] for
[1:41:48] it praise the Lord even though this
[1:41:51] young boy has realized he has wasted
[1:41:54] everything but he remember there is an
[1:41:59] inheritance he remember I'm just you
[1:42:02] know I'm just I'm just wasting my life
[1:42:04] here instead of eating in the in the pig
[1:42:08] patch my father has
[1:42:12] everything the beauty of that story The
[1:42:15] Beauty of what Jesus was the one that
[1:42:18] told that Parable the beauty of that
[1:42:26] why he brought that story to the to the
[1:42:28] the the the the Pharisees if you read
[1:42:31] the setting of The Story Jesus had the
[1:42:33] Pharisees on one side he had the
[1:42:35] publicans which were the Sinners on one
[1:42:40] side praise the
[1:42:42] Lord the beauty of that story that he
[1:42:45] was trying to bring to them is that is
[1:42:48] is uh is uh uh uh there there there an
[1:42:51] inheritance
[1:42:55] that we must
[1:42:58] identify praise the Lord and just during
[1:43:01] the week I was uh uh you know reading
[1:43:04] and and and and uh and and and I taught
[1:43:07] about that story and in my mind I was
[1:43:09] thinking I say it's uh uh uh uh uh it's
[1:43:14] it's one of the story in the Bible where
[1:43:16] you were realize that a setting R the
[1:43:20] Bible says the father asks that he must
[1:43:22] be dress in a set
[1:43:25] rod and it's it's one of the story also
[1:43:28] where you find that the the the the
[1:43:31] there is an exchange of
[1:43:34] rink the father put a rink on his finger
[1:43:39] brother Bram says it was it it signify
[1:43:42] that his name was good on the
[1:43:45] check just like the father's
[1:43:49] name praise the Lord and then I started
[1:43:52] thinking in my mind I says well is that
[1:43:54] where we took our wedding culture
[1:43:58] from because it's in the wedding where a
[1:44:00] certain Rob is bought every every girl
[1:44:03] look for that set
[1:44:06] Rob and then it's it's where ring is
[1:44:09] also
[1:44:10] exchange why because that's what
[1:44:13] marriage
[1:44:16] is marriage is all about Redemption the
[1:44:20] story of the prodical son was all about
[1:44:22] redemp Redemption the father said my son
[1:44:26] was lost now he's found he was dead now
[1:44:31] he's
[1:44:33] alive praise the Lord so when a young
[1:44:36] man takes a woman it's it's an act of
[1:44:40] redemption and is also an act of
[1:44:44] adoption her name is good on the check
[1:44:48] as your
[1:44:51] name praise the Lord
[1:44:55] amen it's an act of
[1:44:59] Redemption where you don't you don't say
[1:45:01] well you know I I I I bought my car
[1:45:04] before I marry you I build my house
[1:45:06] before I marry you whatever you
[1:45:10] have when that person is redeemed to
[1:45:13] that
[1:45:14] position the name is good on the check
[1:45:19] as your
[1:45:21] name are we together praise the
[1:45:25] Lord
[1:45:28] amen this agean Society has given us
[1:45:30] sheer
[1:45:33] property we have lot of people coab
[1:45:35] beting together and they are not really
[1:45:36] under the covant of
[1:45:38] marriage because it's a covenant of
[1:45:41] redemption it's a covenant of
[1:45:45] adoption praise the Lord
[1:45:48] amen are we together what am I talking
[1:45:51] about this morning
[1:45:55] I might not even say what I want to say
[1:45:56] until my time will

[1:46:47] identification they take you is is it's

[1:47:30] grown a little bit
[1:47:32] now praise the
[1:47:34] Lord amen are we together you have to
[1:47:39] know that I mean that that that was that
[1:47:41] was what Samson was was waiting
[1:47:44] for
[1:47:47] amen that's what he was waiting for he
[1:47:49] didn't have an eyes to see but he knew
[1:47:52] that his Covenant was not in his
[1:47:54] eyes praise the Lord his Covenant was
[1:47:58] not in his muscle his Covenant was his
[1:48:01] hair
[1:48:03] shape so he kept touching his
[1:48:06] hair when he started feeding grein of
[1:48:09] hell he said take me to the
[1:48:15] post I'm man I see the forces around me

[1:48:27] Lord amen he says and SED will he will
[1:48:31] he he will come and mourn you cause you
[1:48:33] to dispute with one another if he can
[1:48:35] turn him down just

[1:48:45] immediately what is the benefit of of of
[1:48:48] uh you know fighting against one
[1:48:51] another praise the Lord
[1:48:53] it's not a place of competition
[1:48:58] here let me tell you there's there
[1:49:01] there's a difference there's a
[1:49:02] difference yeah I mean and and and
[1:49:05] that's
[1:49:06] what the communion represent to the
[1:49:10] church when we come to that communion
[1:49:13] and we identified ourself with uh with
[1:49:16] with his body and the blood and then we
[1:49:19] set ourself aside to to wash one another
[1:49:22] another Faith that's what it's all about
[1:49:26] the ministry is all about
[1:49:31] serving you realize that uh uh uh uh uh
[1:49:36] uh the people that don't have the heart
[1:49:40] to self they are always
[1:49:44] controlling it's a spirit of detector sh
[1:49:48] you feel like people must serve you
[1:49:54] Jesus said you call me Lord and Masters
[1:49:58] and I have washed your feet now do the
[1:50:01] same to one
[1:50:04] another so what we are called to do is
[1:50:06] to serve one
[1:50:11] another are we
[1:50:15] together he said turn him down
[1:50:17] immediately you are Brethren and is the
[1:50:20] enemy and we are here to whole extender
[1:50:24] in this evening light that when the word
[1:50:28] is darking and the whole church kingdom
[1:50:32] is going into the Council of
[1:50:37] churches and that's and that is the
[1:50:39] thing that that caught my
[1:50:41] attention most of what we want our our
[1:50:45] our service to be is is is all of the
[1:50:48] things we see on the
[1:50:51] internet praise the Lord you watch all
[1:50:54] of those great worship
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:51:01] leaders you think about how much prayer
[1:51:04] time do they
[1:51:07] have how much prayer time it's not about
[1:51:11] the curliness of the voice it's not the
[1:51:13] hard tone that we can take I've seen
[1:51:16] brothers that cannot even carry a tone
[1:51:18] like brother Brandon would say carry the
[1:51:20] tone in the cup
[1:51:22] they can't carry the tone but they are
[1:51:24] great worship
[1:51:29] leaders because it's all about creating
[1:51:32] an atmosphere it's all about bringing
[1:51:34] the people in and say we are children oh
[1:51:37] let Rejoice the Lord is with us the Lord
[1:51:40] is
[1:51:49] good are we together
[1:51:53] amen maybe I take one more yeah I won't
[1:51:56] be able to get through everything I want
[1:51:58] I wanted through this
[1:52:04] morning in the message brother BR take
[1:52:07] this he
[1:52:11] said when the morning Stars sang
[1:52:13] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:52:17] joob way back before the foundation of
[1:52:20] the word
[1:52:22] how do we know that wasn't the time when
[1:52:27] the lamb was
[1:52:30] slain that's when God in his great
[1:52:34] thinking seeing us shouting and
[1:52:38] rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus
[1:52:42] Christ praise the
[1:52:44] Lord you know because uh so that's
[1:52:47] that's that's what Jesus was trying to
[1:52:50] connect the disciples with
[1:52:53] your shouting and joing rejoicing should
[1:52:56] not be uh uh only in uh H uh your daily
[1:53:00] Victory because at as much as you have
[1:53:03] Victory you will also have
[1:53:07] defeats praise the Lord so are we going
[1:53:10] to be rejoicing one day and now when we
[1:53:13] going through a a little time of trial
[1:53:15] we are s we are no no no no and when you
[1:53:18] identified and you're rejoicing whether
[1:53:21] you are having Victory what you are
[1:53:24] going through trial you know that my
[1:53:26] name is in the
[1:53:28] book that's where our joy
[1:53:32] is because you have got you you you have
[1:53:35] got an Heavenly
[1:53:41] identification so we came right into our
[1:53:44] time with something that we never knew
[1:53:47] we
[1:53:48] had praise the Lord and that's the
[1:53:52] reason why the word have the preeminence
[1:53:55] in the
[1:53:58] service the real time of worshiping is
[1:54:01] when the word is
[1:54:03] preached we must now sit down like
[1:54:07] Spectators we must rejoice in the word
[1:54:10] we must Rejoice that things have been
[1:54:14] said that have call us out things has
[1:54:18] been
[1:54:20] said that has identified what I'm
[1:54:22] dealing
[1:54:23] with I must rejoice in the
[1:54:27] fact that God took time to identify what
[1:54:31] I'm dealing
[1:54:34] with when when he spoke to Judas he
[1:54:37] never said Judas go and betray me he
[1:54:39] said no there's one among you yeah that
[1:54:42] will betray me and let he go and do it
[1:54:45] quickly but when he spoke to Peter he
[1:54:48] said pet he call him by name if God call
[1:54:52] call you by name identifying what you
[1:54:54] are dealing with you better rejoice in
[1:55:01] it praise the Lord he said one year will
[1:55:04] be tring they started asking one another
[1:55:06] is it you
[1:55:07] me oh they did not
[1:55:11] know so Jesus identifying Peter and says
[1:55:15] uh Peter Satan seek to shift you as a we
[1:55:18] but I have prayed for you
[1:55:24] that should be enough for him to start
[1:55:26] rejoicing whoa I just missed a
[1:55:31] bullet praise the Lord I just missed a
[1:55:38] bullet are we
[1:55:41] together and brother bam says here when
[1:55:44] the morning star sang together the sons
[1:55:46] of God shouted for Joy who were those
[1:55:49] sons of God that shouted for Joy Jesus
[1:55:51] told them
[1:55:53] I had Joy with you before the foundation
[1:55:56] of the word so what is he doing he's
[1:55:59] connecting what job said to what we just
[1:56:02] read in St
[1:56:07] luk don't Rejoice because uh you know
[1:56:10] demons are subject unto you it give us
[1:56:13] some sense of Joy amen when we know that
[1:56:17] at least by the grace of God uh I mean
[1:56:20] uh the the the Lord is uh uh is helping
[1:56:22] us to get over some our fleshly
[1:56:26] nature it give us some sense of Joy but
[1:56:29] the thing about it there is that your
[1:56:31] flesh will never come to
[1:56:35] Perfection praise the
[1:56:37] Lord you will have
[1:56:41] battles but when if you can identify
[1:56:44] yourself with the word it's the word
[1:56:46] that brings our rejoicing amen praise
[1:56:49] the Lord is the word that brings our
[1:56:51] rejoicing let me take this one and then
[1:56:53] we close here Mery
[1:56:56] believe I'll take that one and then we
[1:57:00] close praise the Lord thank you for
[1:57:02] bearing with me amen kind of started the
[1:57:05] service in a complete different way but
[1:57:08] uh I can I can feel the connection amen
[1:57:11] I can feel that you are connected with
[1:57:12] what I'm saying brother bam says to take
[1:57:15] God at his
[1:57:16] word is to hear his word accept it and
[1:57:21] start rejoicing with
[1:57:24] it now start performing
[1:57:27] it now start carrying it
[1:57:30] out hear the word accept it and start
[1:57:38] rejoicing are we
[1:57:43] together because every seed will bring
[1:57:46] forth of his kind his world will never
[1:57:50] go out
[1:57:52] and return back to him without
[1:57:54] accomplishing the purpose so if God has
[1:57:57] spoken a promise to you that you can
[1:58:00] take as your own you don't have to see
[1:58:04] the seed producing fruit before you are
[1:58:06] happy that the seed was
[1:58:09] planted praise the Lord talk to brother
[1:58:12] Wesley he will teach you more about
[1:58:14] that about planting
[1:58:17] seed
[1:58:19] Amen brother B says here we could see
[1:58:23] 500 rush to the altar tonight which will
[1:58:27] be a sign then that the Revival is going
[1:58:30] to break we don't we don't have to have
[1:58:33] 500 at the altar we just have to take
[1:58:37] God's word for it and start
[1:58:43] rejoicing praise the Lord amen are we
[1:58:48] together and that is one of the thing
[1:58:51] that the Church
[1:58:53] lives is rejoicing in the
[1:58:58] word it don't have to be the preaching
[1:59:01] of the word like we are doing but I mean
[1:59:04] if you have cultivated the habit of
[1:59:06] rejoicing in the
[1:59:08] word whether you are reading it in your
[1:59:12] home or you are listening to it on H you
[1:59:15] know driving behind the wheel praise the
[1:59:18] Lord sometimes I just feel like parking
[1:59:21] my car running around the c a little
[1:59:24] bit because something have just
[1:59:27] something have just sounded so beautiful
[1:59:29] to
[1:59:32] me praise the
[1:59:39] lord it's not seeing 500 at the altar he
[1:59:42] says
[1:59:46] but if we just have to take God at his
[1:59:49] word and start
[1:59:51] rejoicing see what will happen when you
[1:59:54] learn to
[1:59:56] cultivate rejoicing in the
[2:00:00] word when you read the scripture that
[2:00:03] says the angels of the Lord are incal
[2:00:06] about them you don't have to see the
[2:00:08] Angels before you be
[2:00:12] happy start rejoicing because you are
[2:00:16] protected
[2:00:22] God there is more with us than them that
[2:00:25] are against
[2:00:31] us are we together can we say Amen to
[2:00:35] the word am
[2:00:37] amen take God word for it start
[2:00:41] rejoicing something will happen that
[2:00:44] brings the word to
[2:00:46] Life As We water it with praise you see
[2:00:51] that's why praise comes after the
[2:00:53] preaching of the
[2:00:54] word because a seed has been
[2:00:58] planted We Must Praise we must worship
[2:01:03] Him and when we praise the lord we are
[2:01:06] watering the seed that has been
[2:01:11] planted praise the
[2:01:15] Lord that brings the word to Life As We
[2:01:18] water it with praises what makes the sea
[2:01:21] grow water
[2:01:23] what makes the word of God grow is the
[2:01:26] Praises of God learning to praise
[2:01:30] God praise the Lord let me tell you if
[2:01:34] you don't cultivate a habit to praise
[2:01:37] God you will seek self
[2:01:43] Praises praise the Lord amen you you you
