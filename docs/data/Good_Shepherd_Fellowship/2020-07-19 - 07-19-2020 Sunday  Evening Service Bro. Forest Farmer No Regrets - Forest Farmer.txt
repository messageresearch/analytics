========================================

[Music] [Music] the Lord done some great things and I was just so thankful about it and now uh tomorrow night uh tomorrow is Friday I was thinking tomorrow was Saturday we won't won't forget the businessman's breakfast will be held here I believe at this school and I suppos they sell tickets for them don't they something and they I guess everyone understands just how you get the uh the tickets and so forth for the breakfast we'd be happy if you could come along and see uh feel led to come now uh Billy always tells me said there one thing that you do daddy is wear the people out they're wore out any house they've been sitting there for hours you preach so long and I said well son I'm going to try to make it in Chicago meeting I said I'm going to set my watch at every 20 minutes and I what it alarms I'm going to quit right then and call the prayer and he said uh you might as well not said it because it a go you know it went off two or three times and just alarmed itself down I never did know I'm making so much noise up here I didn't even hear it when it went off and so I I just have to um just I hope I don't bore you you know I don't I don't come here for that I I come and I love him so much and know we've got so much that ought to be done right at this time and I just try to push too much of it in one night you see and not knowing just what time that we're going to be called away and then I think well I don't know what time I'm going to be called away and none of us know that and so we just might as well do what we can while we can do it I've heard my mother I never was had a dance in my life but I heard only a holy dance one time in church I never forget that when we were still a Baptist Church I would always criticized and kind of in my heart I wouldn't say it out loud because I I'd be afraid to do that anything that God does I always kind of thought it kind of strange to see I see him first got acquainted with the Pentecostal people see him dance you know dance around I thought you know that ain't in the Bible what what are they dancing about and then one night I was teaching from a chart on Daniel and Revelations it was New Year's night I was going to uh teach on the chart until midnight wasn't a chart like a Blackboard I was teaching and and uh there was a some Pentecostal people had come from Louisville they had a oh some sisters a sister a pastor at a church over there and she had a they had washboards and Thimbles and and all kinds of little things to make rackets with and and they uh all got it harmonizing some way I don't know what it was and they and she started playing the piano and all these girls up there got to hit with these Thimbles on washboards and things and and they they got this playing that song there's going to be a meeting in the air and the Sweet By and By or something well that little girl that was playing little lady pastored she just turned white all just like a chalk and she just begin to play it in such a way I don't I never see anything play like it in my life and I thought now what's that and then one on the washboard she got to doing the same thing then here two or three got up and a little blond head got to dancing right in the floor I oh man right up and down the floor as hard as she could go just dancing away like that little old girl about 16 18 years old I was just a young fell myself H Now isn't that something right you're in my church how I'll ever live that down see I'm watching her like that and I what do they do that for why they have to do that why could they just played their music and went on and let it alone like that I well that's terrible I got thinking now in the Bible is there such a thing as dancing and I remember that David danced around the ark when he saw the ark coming see he danced before the Lord and the Lord said he's a man after my own heart I thought well now that's he what did he dance for well they had a victory and Mariam when they crossed over the Red Sea Moses sang in the spirit and miam took a tambourine begin to beat it and they went down along the bank all the daughters of Israel dancing in the spirit and I seen that dancing was when they had Victory I thought God thinking well maybe I haven't got Victory enough I got thinking about it you know after a while I got the Pat in my foot and before I knowed I was out there dancing with that girl [Music] out I was marked then I can just see the expression on those people's face yet seeing their Pastor on the floor of this that little girl dancing around here I was right out there too I never was on a dance floor in my life and but I'd had to take it back and say it was on that one but that was a church floor so when we U you know all the devils God he he he copied it after some real thing that God's got that's all just exactly the devil cannot create he's just a perverter of what's been created you see so he cannot create he's not a Creator he's a perverter what is what is unrighteousness is righteousness perverted see it's uh legal for a man to take a wife and and be a a a husband to her and family relationship but the same woman another woman on the same Act condemn him and send his soul away see it's wrong what is it righteousness perverted see and it's the truth is always right what is a lie is the truth perverted see makes a lie so that's where all sin is is righteousness perverted so when I used hear my mother say she used to go to dances the old her and Daddy on them kind of see they had the old Fiddler would come stand on the corner and play the fiddle and them Kentucky people and pop he didn't have any money you know supposed to have a little money to Jingle your pockets and I se him go out the CAG and get some Nails in his pocket you know dance around he and Mama and they'd win prizes I can see her pull a skirt out like this you know and that jig dance you know ride around around one another like that I'd see Pop I thought that's that's bad pop and Nails that's not money you see I know he didn't have any money he had some Nails in his pocket jingling up and down like that and they do that come on till around daylight and some of the people leave home the all the all Kentucky people come over and they have the dances from one house to the other and then they go home of a morning packing their shoes in their hands C their feet was so sore from dancing well if you can do that for the devil then why not stand let's preach all night and praise God and get in the spirit and see sure if that if that's for Eternal separation what about eternal life let's we can appreciate this as much more than we should that of course but San wear us out on this right quick or tell us was was too tired but I tell you he's had an awful time with me G we out on it I remember when I was healed of stomach trouble eat Satan said well you better not eat said because the doctor said if you eat you'd die you had an ulcer stomach and said it just one big bloody ulcer but the Lord said he healed me so I had to take somebody's word so I I took God's word and so oh I'd like to Burnt me up I would just hot water running out of my mouth and so two or three days I was going around holding my stomach like this said how you feeling Mr brandom I said oh I feel fine hamping away like that someone said you lied I did not I was making a confession confess means say the same thing by Stripes I was healed so that's that does it see I was making confession and so Satan said to me said you're bringing reproach I said now look here old God if if you enjoy hearing me testify you stick around but if you don't you might as well get away I'm going to testify anyhow so that's it you just got to let him know what side you're standing on and then make your stand and then stand and that's just the way we got to do always is get where we know that we're right and then got faith in that you can't have faithless you know you're right don't you try to do that to Bluff him now he won't take your bluff see don't Bluff him but when you really believe it you're not bluffing then something's already witnessed to you then you then you're right I don't care you might might not no one never lay hands on you you might not never hear uh anything but just as long as something has confirmed it in your heart that it's God's word and God's will for you that's all is necessary and many times these gifts and things they just encourage I'm watching a Baptist preacher sitting here in front of me tonight if I'm not mistaken is this Mr Dalton sitting here from Somerset Kentucky I thought it was I remember brother Ed Dal oh my bapst right and he um come up and but he believed and come up to the church receive the Holy Ghost went back down and of course all of his neighborhood let him down as usual and so then when the Holy Spirit to come and on the what we're looking for to happen at any time now another gift that's going to be added to the church and uh it's a marvelous thing and we probably you've read read the articles in our uh religious papers about it about the squirrels and so forth and brother Dalton had two children well I think how many about eight children I think nine children nine children and uh teenagers and you know how they are kind of and a poor father and mother how they prayed so hard that God save their children one day at the Tabernacle he had seen the Holy Spirit speak to a woman and tell her just ask what you will right now and God told me to give you he said what must I ask I said you got a crippled sister sitting here has been crippled from birth and there's a man sitting here tonight Banks Woods who's sitting right with me the woman's name is Mrs wri and I said you got an age father and mother you're living on less than $200 a year on that little poor farm over there a widow woman I said there's many things you could ask for sister hadie but I said the very God that told me about those squirrels when I spoke those squirrels are standing right there and did that seven straight times standing right there where you look and see it when it's just impossible for one to be sitting on the wall there just to confirming something and I said he tells me to have you to ask what you will he said you asked it for me to say it she said well what should have say I said ask for whatever you will it'll be given right here if it isn't then I I've told something wrong and she said well said I don't know what to ask brother brandom she said she had two teenage boys and talk about Renegades they were and so just giving her heartaches all the time poor little Widow and mother and so um her husband I'm married she to her husband and they were her husband had gotten killed on a tractor and those boys had just gone wild and she said well the salvation and my two boys I said I give you those two boys in the name of Jesus Christ and both of them fell across her lap come to Christ now brother Banks Woods is somewhere sitting here in this building tonight that was present to see that happen both them boys are find they taking feet washing all the time communing at church and when we're taking feet washing the ones washing the feet we lay our hands over on them and pray that little fellow the other night about 14 years old our pastor brother Neville had his handling on praying the cutest little thing so brother Ed Dalton seen that happen he was praying for his children got outside and he turned back around and the Holy Spirit said speak for Ed's children and I said brother Dalton the Holy Spirit tells me by that same gift that we're looking to be perfectly manifested soon I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and when he got home there his daughter daughter and sons already give their hearts to Christ it's a few miles down in country from me and I think every one of your children is saved and filled with the Holy Spirit ready is that right brother D is there any of them with you one daughter was that the one was saved right away the oldest the next morning the oldest daughter was saved the next morning and every one of his children is now saved how the Holy Spirit When God says anything he keeps his word see now how could I save those children see it it isn't if it's not your own words if it isn't your own thinking then it's it's ever what's inspiring you and if it's God then it's God's word see so that's way on the meetings here at night when you see those things happening that's not me I couldn't do that it's God doing that and if you just believe it then that's all you have to do is just just believe it now well it's almost time to call a prayer line Billy I just take up so much time but you know I want to I want to make a an appointment with all the people around Chicago here and this uh this brother sings here at night brother Melvin how I love to hear that boy sing I I want to hear him sing uh remember me one of these nights before leaving and he's a colored sister that sing at the Christian businessman oh my you you should hear her saying ship AA and um I told my wife she's sitting back there tonight I I told her I hope she gets to hear that lady saying ship a ho and brother Melvin saying remember me when Tears are Falling Down oh uh sure hope we get these and there's a little brother over there at that meeting the other morning he's sitting back here somewhere I shook his here he is he and his wife my talk about singing and when you get over in glory and I I wish always wanted to sing I'd rather sing than preach anytime so I I love singing so well so I always said all the great singers of Earth will be gathered over there singing the stories how they overcome over on a great big Hillside in glory just across the River of Life over on the other side I want to sit and listen at so I want to invite all you Chicago people to meet me over there now and and um and we'll sit down and listen at them saying so we won't have any have to hurry and see if the children's go to get hurt or anything they'll be there with us there will be nothing to hurt or destroy and we'll have plenty of time then and we'll just talk long time just have plenty of time to talk now I've got several scriptures that I want to refer to I got some wrote out here and some pages here and I want to start tonight and read first a scripture found in St Luke 8:50 for a a text and my subject tonight is the theme song they sang just before I come in only believe and uh uh St Luke 8 uh chapter and the 50th verse but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall shall be made whole let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer gracious God who brought again the lord Jesus thy son from the dead and has presented him to us after 2,000 years we see him day after day and night after night in The Invisible body of his working in the visible body of his church bringing to pass his words and as we was speaking the other night you're right on schedule everything's hitting just right God's great time clock's ticking just to the moment then tonight when we see that that last midnight stroke is fixing to strike oh great Jehovah God be merciful to us and as I think tonight here before me holding the purchase of your blood there attention for the next 30 or 40 minutes what must I say oh God these few words that's been prepared would be insufficient Lord without your anointing so I pray that you'll anoint the words tonight of this text and may they find their resting place and provide for us just what we have need of to be prepared for that hour and Jesus does come because God noticed when my eyes open a few moments ago laying here before me is that book of the Christian businessman where our precious brother Tommy Nichols translated from that tape that Vision or whatever it was Lord you let me see across the curtain there oh God I said if I could only go back for a i I'd persuade I'd beg people oh they mustn't miss that Lord there's people here that's divided living with me for me and my children between them and their children I pray God that somehow another something can might be said tonight that that we might have Christ divided among us tonight that he might be the savior of every one of us and the Healer of every one of us and our coming King and that hope leave here in our hearts may we live eternally with him over in that land where there's no sickness I can think of them women how they were once recognize them here as old women 90 years old and there they was beautiful and young and those gray-headed man here on Earth there they was young and in there's youth for eternity God we couldn't afford to miss that Grant Lord tonight that each and every person will take new hold tonight bless the Saints and heal the sick for we commit ourselves with this text in the name of Jesus Christ for thy Glory amen amen Jesus had just been turned down from a great Revival he was always about the father's business I I like that we me myself I have so much time that I'm I think I I foolishly use and uh all of us feel that way and we uh get so wound up till we got to go somewhere and unwind but we have found Jesus always about the father's business I love that and that's the way we should be we should never be idling our time what time we have we must spend it for and and conserve the time redeem it because it is precious every time we get a chance to put in a plug for Jesus do it every time we get to put in a plug for God do it do something for the church and for EMB betterment of people many people that's how we come to know these things is by what somebody's told us and Jesus had left Galilee over in the land that he came from and crossed over the sea feeling LED no doubt to go over to Gia for Revival no doubt but what the father had led him over across the sea to gatera and you we all know the story that there was only one person saved that was a maniac uh in gadera and he was out into the fields and the cemetery he would went wild and they pluck chain on him and the demon power could break the chains and and I've often thought at going around insane institutions and watch a person who's uh been possessed with those evil Powers how strong they are they take a policeman sometime to beat them down remember down in Florida one night a man that wouldn't have weighed over 120 lb whip five policemen just as easy as you'd whip your child and um and then when that evil spirit went off of him while there was nothing harling just as Meek as he could be but it was the evil spirit and I thought if a man possessed with an evil spirit could break chains what could he do if he's completely surrendered to God with the power of God possessing him like that he could straighten every crippled leg and uh do great things if he could just be so Anointed with God's power as the devil could completely uh get a hold of him did you notice that devil was so completely a hold to that man until he he even confessed Jesus said we know who you are the Holy One Of God why cometh to torment us before our time comes see he was so completely surrendered to the devil until the devil could use his tongue and you know I like that I hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings but we can get so completely surr to God that he can use our tongue too to speak in other languages and to preach the gospel to sing the gospel to speak visions that we're looking at and the mysteries of God if we just completely surrender to the power of God that's all and if the devil can get a man under his control and do that what can do God do with one get one under his control so this maniac and you notice when Jesus was crossing the sea the devil know that he was on the road to a great win a great victory for God and he tried to drown him that night caused a storm to come up and but Jesus know that God had sent him because he did only what God led him to do wouldn't that be nice if we had a testimony like that Brethren I do only that which pleases God that be Wonder like Enoch walked with God 500 years and had a testimony that he pleased God he didn't have to die just went up so then uh uh little afternoon stroll he just started walking out and just thought well I've been on Earth long enough I'll just walk on up and just started by faith he thought well I've been here long enough so I'm kind of tired of being around you think of just stroll on up till hit the milky white way and just walk on up knock on the door so that's what he did see by faith he did it the Bible said so see he just got T stand here he said well I'm just going to walk up home God just went on up through the air walking he did that by faith the Bible said he did and so oh I I when I feel death come knocking around my door I I want to have that kind of Faith don't you just say well so long world I'm going to walk away from you now just start walking on just walk right on up and face the moon and stars and strike the milky white way and go on into the Spheres and spheres and out of the Spheres and just go on into Glory that's right and then um we find out that the devil can't destroy God's servant as long as he's in the will of God so he's we see him rise up that night and the devil all so angry and go to try to drown him out there on the sea raised up and he said why are you so fearful you think I'd be doing anything L is in the will of God why you so scared about why are you worried about anyhow yeah why are you all upset that's the same thing he'd say to us tonight brother I imagine why are you so scared about see what's the matter are you afraid to trust me he said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him crossed over the sea oh how beautiful there he got on the other side and this Maniac met him and and when he did he was go to come out to tear him to pieces and then the devil found out that that was little more than a man coming walking up there with those other 12 men and then when he confessed him to be the Son of God and confessed that he is future torment Jesus said hold your peace but come out of him and he delivered that man of those Legions of devils and those Devils went over and they got if they're not embodied they're they're seem to be helpless so they went over and got a bunch of hogs and went out 2,000 Hogs and drowned in the sea and you know what Jesus come over to uh hold a Revival but when those people realize there go to cost them 2,000 Hogs they didn't want the Revival so if it's going to cost them anything they don't want nothing to do with it so that's about the way it is today you know if it's going to cost you a few hours sleep or or something other the people don't want to do nothing with it you know and so they said well they instead of having the Revival they come out the people of the city and said leave our country we never we don't want you over here just get on out we and you know and Jesus looked around to the man was in his right mind and had clothes on and if you know I always thought there I very not start on that I if you see that man he started putting on cloth when he met Jesus and how is it we claim we know him and Tak them off all the time so there's and that's um they say we're crazy for preaching such things as that but I don't know the man that had was naked was one was crazy according to the Bible so when he found Jesus went putting his clothes back on again so so we find out that I've often wondered when I up to heaven I want to find that man and I I want to go over Jesus wouldn't let him follow him he said you go on back and show the people over there what's happened to you and I just wonder what uh what weight his testimony had on hog raising in that country after that I just wondered what what his testimony had what weight it had over there but they didn't want him so I'll say one thing if you don't want him he won't bore you with himself no no he won't push yourself on he never did he knocks you're on the inside you're the one opens the door but he'll knock he'll give you the opportunity so then uh oh they said we don't want you I don't care how many you can deliver and how what who sent you over here if God sent you over about it we just don't want any of that kind of stuff going over here around ours you get her people all confused so you just get back where you belong you said all right I don't back you went and got in the boat it must have been along about 10:00 in the morning our little brother Jas he was a he was a Believer he he actually was a Believer but he was kind of a secret believer and you know we got a whole lot of those out here in these Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian churches they really believe this message of Pentecost they do that they just can't do it on account of their church so jiah said is a secret believer outwardly he had jined himself up with a bunch of unbelievers and so that's why many good man is tonight Jared up with unbelievers and the Bible said do not be unequally yolked together don't yoke yourself up amongst unbelievers come out from amongst the unbelievers and separate yourself sayith God and I will receive you touch not their unclean things and I'll be God to you and you'll be Sons and Daughters unto me so J always like many of today had yoked himself up in an organization that he just simply couldn't wiggle away from because he had a high name perhaps let's call him a a doctor gir see he was a had a great name of doctor maybe behind it he was a priest and he is um is a pastor of a great synagogue but in his heart he'd followed Jesus of Nazareth he'd watched those Miracles he' go home and study and look through the scriptures and say that's just exactly that's think he was standing there that day when Simon come up he went out to hear John preach and he heard about he he him announce Jesus and seen this light come down over him there and settle down up on him and we seen that same light was on him tell that old fisherman why your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas maybe you know his father was a might have been a member of this man's synagogue he said uh I know that man didn't know him and I went home and search that out in the scripture and I found out that that that was the sign of the Messiah and then when I was standing there I I was standing over on the other side of course as the priest and my brethren and listen to see what I could hear saying the Brethren they said what are we going to do when we go back when Philip come up and had Nathaniel and that Jesus stood there and told Nathaniel who he was and where he found him and so forth like that and we seen Nathaniel or he was maybe studying to be a preacher and he said why Rabbi you're the Son of God the king of Israel he said Do you believe because of told you that and maybe he was sitting out there also to hear the woman at the well and and stand at the gate that time when blind Barney mayus is out there crying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me he couldn't have touched him if you go if you ever's that the place in Mark where barus is setting and where Jesus was when he called him oh my all that mob howling saying say tell me you raised the dead we got a graveyard full of them up here come up raise some of them we'll believe you see how could he ever hurt all but is faith touched him like a little zachus that I told of the Christian businessman sitting up in the tree like that said H Rebecca told me that he he know all things and could God spoke through him and he was Messiah so I pull all these limbs around me and and you'll never know I'm sitting up here so when Jesus stopped around the tree and looked up and said zachus come down going home with you so maybe he was there that morning and see that however he believed through the scriptures that that was the Messiah and but yet he couldn't make a confession because the the Ministerial Association uh of gatera had said this if there's anybody ever t one of them revivals that that prophet of Galilee over there holds will excommunicating that hour from the church so well he he had a pastor and he had a big congregation and a nice bunch of people and and he know he loved the Lord but right down in his heart he know there was something else ought to be asked oh zachus I hope you're sitting here tonight and don't get up and go out till this is over see U just set still for a minute and there he was you know out there believing that and come home by the little uh Candlelight and study through the night when he'd go to one of those meetings and listen Maybe disguise himself and put a veil over his face or something so he wouldn't be know as a doctor z uh Dr Jas you know he just wouldn't want to be known amongst the crowd but yet he was sitting there and he watched this and he studied it but yet he couldn't openly publicly confess him because he'd have to give up his Ministerial Association and his fellowship with his Brethren and that's the reason all of them together run Jesus out of gader and put him back over his own country in his own country had been the same thing and uh anybody join themselves with this uh so-called prophet of Galilee while I was had to be excommunicated but you know God's got a way of bringing that real genuine Faith out in us God has peculiar ways of doing it and so um let's say one night uh the little girl had come in and she he had one little daughter about 12 years old and he was getting aged and as the only child he and his wife had one night she came in from skipping the Rope or something around the parish and she came in she said Daddy I am so sick so he felt her little head and he said yes honey you are sick so he said mother I tell you what you put her to bed and we'll go down and get the doctor that's the only sensible thing to do so they went and got the good doctor from the neighborhood and he came up and he failed her and he said yes she's burning with fever so he doctored her for two or three days and U come to find out her fever grew worse oh got in such a place to it got so hot that he was getting the doctor got weed about it so he tried all the herbs and all the remedies that he know to try to help this uh little girl but he he couldn't do no good with it he just couldn't break the fever so then one uh morning about 9:00 while he had come to visit the little girl actually had been up almost all night and all the loving people of the churches gathered in there and all the associate pastors and some of the visiting clergymen and the district pter and all of them was sitting close you know to to to offer prayer and he examined the little girl taking her pulse and oh the fever was raging the little thing was beyond out of her head now so he knew that the end was close he hated to tell the pastor perhaps went to his own church so he called him out to one side and said now D I want to tell you out your so sister won't hear it that baby is dying your only little girl oh doctor surely there's something else you can do no D if if you want to call another doctor and consult the case why it's all right but as far as my uh medical uh understanding deaths on the child right now because she's laying at the point of death and she probably won't last over another hour or two the good doctor was telling all that he know to be the truth and said Doctor would you advise uh me to get some other doctor he said you're welcome but he said I don't know no other doctor we know there was a doctor over across the uh there called Loop Dr Loop but you know he uh he was converted oh don't you Luke's went off on the wrong end see he's following that Galilean Prophet don't oh that brings it back to his mind yes doctor well thank you what do I owe you Doctor oh well uh that's all right you don't have to pay me nothing there a buying man see you go ahead preacher I know you don't make much money so just let it go well thank you very kindly now what's he going to do he walks back from the gate and said I'll go in the house there in the parish and why don't how I go tell my wife that that baby's landing at the point of death and I've kept it a secret from her all the time that I really believed in Jesus being that real Prophet was to come but now how would I ever get it there as a district presor and all the rest of Ministerial Association sitting around in the house there and how can I ever and wonder where he's at so he goes back in the room and begins to wonder and you know and first thing you know he calls his wife in he said dear come in and sit down just a minute he put his hand said I've got something I want to talk to you about first I want to say mother do you remember how that I've set up here at night time these candle lights reading the scriptures yes uh yes d i i i know just how you have set up here and read and I've come in being gone for two or three days at a time telling you was out about the Master's business yes I remember all about it well I've kept this back from you but I want to tell you something you know where I was at well where were you at dear I was handing them meetings of Jesus of Nazareth that Galilean Prophet I was attending in oh she said that's no secret to me I was reading your notes that you took of his sermon you see when I cleaned up the room I found the waste basket land full of them you see I just read them where you've been searching through the scripture sure enough yes well I'll tell you you know what I truly believe that that is the Messiah well she said dear are you just now ready to confess it I believed it all along now he's ready he can tell her now what said you know what said honey the doctor just told me something what a daughter's going to be better no she's dying oh Jan Oh Oh surely not yes yes she she's she's dying but I wonder where Jesus of Nazareth is you know he he left and cross the sea a few days ago and he's gone away and I I wonder where he's at if we could only find him well well we just might as well confess our faith and go out well we walked out before the all the people and said well I've got to announce something the doctor just told me that my baby's dying my only girl 12 years old is dying and uh so e telling all them begin to lament and cry and go on and said now wait that's not our last hope just a moment oh I feel his little face getting red looked at the district Presby and the bishop and all them sitting around you know and what's he going to do but we got another hope and I can hear the bishop raise up and say well you want to consult another doctor well uh no not exactly but I got something then his heart begins to race real fashionable can you say it he stuttered a little bit and I hear his wife say go on tell them tell them tell them well uh uh Brethren I know this may excite you just a little bit but uh yes I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I I believe that he that Galilean Prophet is the Messiah I been well I can see the bishop raised up in the district presbyter and all the dignity and saying watch your eyes my you don't mean you've gone like Luke and the rest of them did yes I believe him I certainly do why why why he had a need God's got a way of putting it on you in such a way he'll make you come out with that Faith just bring her right out anyhow yes sir now I could hear him say um does anybody know where he's at one little fell said yes uh I I was sick the other day and I I went on to see Dr Luke and Luke's with him and he was over and G and they I heard by a courier that they're coming in today they're supposed to land this morning down there at the fishing dock I can see a little uh D going out and get his little priest hat and putting it on putting his coat on start out I hear the district presor stand door look here young man uh you've been one of us for a long time now if you're going to start such as that and mix up our congregation bring such fanaticism as that in our group you know what's going to happen we're going to excommunicate you we're going to take our name right off the boat that's all well I can hear his little heart sinking like that look around his wife and she's standing see what he's going to say and look over and see his little dying daughter he said you just might as well take her off cuz here I go that's right I'm all he had a need rushing he must go right now they said remember if you go you know what's going to happen you know our declaration yes I understand all about it but I've got a dying child here and the very thing is I've hidden my heart all time I've searched the scriptures I've tended his meeting under disguising and I've checked the scriptures and he is the Messiah amen that's it amen that's the way now you're coming to a dra turn right out and tell them what's right confess your faith then you're getting your right on the right path then it it isn't kind of gloomy looking oh uh he said the church said now you remember if you do well what's going to happen but Ji had a need the need and brother if there ever was a time brother that we ought to make our confession that he is the Messiah the Son of God that he is alive that his power is just the same there's a need today today is the hour people are dying people are dying in the churches people are the Pentecostal churches dying it's going so farmal it's getting out away from God if there's any time to step out and say we are dying let's get back to God it's right now because there's a need come back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints right I know there's a lot of fanaticism I'll realize that as I said at the ministerial breakfast the other morning you can't hardly blame pastors but remember every time you see something false a bogus dollar it's just as sure as anything the world it's made off of a real I never was so surprised one time I was going up the road and I seen a a a big bunch of crows or blackbirds they were just having their office squalling time I thought what's the matter with them I walked on up the road and there some of us in trees and some on Telegraph poles and some sitting on fences although what some artha birds there was a a strawberry patch across the the field and the man that owned the patch had went to Florida for a vacation and he he just let those strawberries there wouldn't let no one pick them because he he liked to he kept them there for the birds he just loved to watch The Birds And so while he was gone down in Florida on a vacation watch somebody come over there put a big old scarecrow up in the field and wanted to pick the strawberries and sa not let the birds happen the birds was all excited oh my they were so excited some of them sitting way off in a tree looking all for on them scar curls and just just chirping and chirping and going on some sitting down the telegraph poles and some sitting on the fence poles I thought well now wonder what's the matter and I had the look setting right on the arms of those that old scarecrow said two big healthy Birds just eating as hard as they could eat I thought if that isn't a picture if that isn't something now I thought well what's the matter I walked up a little close and I look there's plenty strawberries I thought what's the matter fellas and that's the way some of them do some of them away go away back here they don't believe in the Holy Ghost or nothing some I come up and say well I believe in a good Sanctified life but I I I I just don't believe in Divine Healing but others will get right down almost to the borderline but they're afraid of the Scarecrow and that's just about where Pentecost has come now you're AF prid of the Scarecrow my brother a scarecrow is a meal ticket amen just get in behind the Scarecrow that's all you have to do if you see all kinds of false isms and things rise up when I said the other night all these isms will soon become WMS so don't worry about them but God's word will be true when when there's no more Heaven and Earth left it'll still be true yes sir there was no condemnation of them sitting there eating strawberries brother they were sitting there big healthy Birds just pecking away as hard as they could cuz they wasn't caring about the Scarecrow they they just eating strawberries just the same so that's what we should do when you see these things that you get everybody's talking so well and the church getting classical and the Big Fellas saying well well we'll just take them into this and that you better be careful brother there's something wrong there somewhere there's something wrong I like to get where somebody's criticized and made fun of and look around and see where well examine it over and see what it's all about yes sir it's a dinner bell just watch right behind it remember the clubs always lays under the good apple tree they don't Club off them little old naughty draw up sour days of Miracles just past there's nothing Club in that just does go on but D had a need and he had a need because his only child was dying and that's the same thing it is tonight now now he didn't have to say now I'll wait now I probably maybe if I wait a little while uh I may go seem like Nicodemus did going to nighttime I slep over sometime at night I tell you uh told my told his wife something like this well now there's such a district preser out there and there such a bishop that's that's all the church and so forth I tell you I'll wait till it gets night and when it gets night I'll slip on my little mask again and I'll slip over to meeting and after it's over I won't let nobody know I slip around behind the building say say prophet of Galilee I believe in you I believe in you you come over here I got a sick daughter no the daughter was dying right then he had to go then it was time for action and it's time for Action Brethren it's not time to argue about whether we should be baptized face forward or backward where we should belong to this church or that church it's time for the Holy Spirit to come into the church and get in action it's later than you think the hour is here it's not time to fuss about Creeds and about doctrines and things like that it's time to get into God's spirit and move on because the atomic bombs are hanging missiles everywhere and spudniks in the skies and everything that Jesus said would take place before the end time has now taking place and the Holy Ghost is here Christ right on time on schedule Hallelujah yes the critics are rising I'm going to say this because it was I asked for to be obain one time and when they did the brother got real put out about it I was set cuz it's on tape and so our brother can hear it if he wants to get this tape is concerning Brother David dupes my precious brother friend I got a letter of criticism from me and uh I didn't want to read it secretary got it and so I I didn't want to read it because I withheld saying his name on a tape but this is tape the tapes are going here's exactly what I said I was preaching on the nearing outcoming of Christ and Brother David is dealing with the Presbyterians Methodist and Baptist and those great men that is his ministry to them God has sent him with the ministry David is a smart Theologian scholar and a wonderful man of God he's been with me in the meetings he stood by my side I love him as only a brother could love another and that is true but what I said about David and the church shall bear me witness I said it seems like that Brother David as spiritual as he is would wake up to the fact to know that he's dealing with the sleeping version and the Pentecostal people are so glad to see the Presbyterians write in a little declaration we got to go back to Divine healers we got to go back to speaking in tongues you've read the peace worthy F we got to go back and having healing Services Billy Graham talking we got to go back to pen call do you realize brother that the very hour that the went to wake the sleeping virgin up when she come to BU or that was when Jesus came I said I wonder if Brother David realizes that you think the Pentecostal Church they had their picture paper they have some Catholic priest standing blessing the Pentecostal businessman's breakfast or something and things like that which that's all right but I wonder if the church really realizes what it is it's a sign when that sleeping virgin come and knocked at the gate that's when she could not get in ver the bride was gone don't you see that's what I said about Brother David he not nothing concerning his work or his man about his uh reputation David's my brother and one of the finest godly man that I know of but I just wondered how that he he didn't pick that up to realize the very minute that outside denominational world begins to receive this message that's exactly the hour he's come when when they went to sleeping virgin realized she didn't have any oil in her lamp and when she come to knock on the door to get it that was exactly when the bride went out when the wise virgin left that's right they didn't get in no and them organizations won't come in they won't have the opportunity to time the message gets around the church will be gone so if they're trying to get in right now how close are we when we see as was in the days of Sodom so shall it be the coming of the son of man the very last message Abraham and his seat after him we see every Everything lays just a time we've got need it's time for action it's not wait till I go way to school and get me a PhD or lld it's get into the gospel right now preach yes get out there now and how's the hour D couldn't wait till tomorrow his child was dying bre we can't wait for a new organization we can't wait for something to gets turn up it's already here we've got to bring Christ on the scene the Pentecostal church is dying amen the assemblies the Oneness the Tess the threeness the the four square all of them they are dying let's leave these things they're all right but don't just quit fussing about that let's bring Christ on the scene that's way your eyes how to get Christ on the scene or his child would die he must hurry real quick he's got to spring into action oh I love that get into action oh if this group right here tonight you Methodist you Baptist you Presbyterian you Pentecostals oness Tess three this and all of you if you spring into action lay beside your traditions and males bring Christ on the scene open up your heart he's here amen his boat just landed h on the scene somebody said yes Faith cometh by hearing say yes he's coming into the dock down there now just down below the Hill from the parish he's coming in down there now but here he goes he grabs his little hat and they don't care what they say say all right J you're going to be sorry one of these days you know you're springing off on the deep end he didn't care deep end or what in he know what his heart told him and there isn't a person in here tonight if you do what your heart told you to do you probably be this altar right there is a preacher peasant if you do what your heart told you to do but what we would confess are wrong it's right will you confess mine I'm ready to join arms and hearts with man to get Christ on the scene that's the main thing the children's dying this little book here holds that Vision in it now I looked over there they I did when I walked up the gate and then asked me if I was a Pentecostal Oneness or a threeness or Fess the only thing it was he just let me come in because I love Christ and had love in my heart that's the thing now Brethren D had to hurry his child was dying God's child's dying the church is dying we've got to do something you might have called it telepathy you might have called it the devil you might don't know what you did call it but way down deep in your heart that if you believed it was a truth brother you better put your ecclesiastical hat in the corner and say something and get moving right the church is dying we need Christ on Time for Action not when I feel like it not when I take the next notion but it had to get people on the scene because the PE uh get Jesus on the scene everything else had failed I want to ask you something is the Pentecostal Church better off tonight because it's broke itself up in about 30 different organizations or when it started in the beginning see just ask that we're constantly getting worse and worse is the women and men in our Pentecostal churches looking more like Saints praying tell me somewhere in the city where they're having prayer meeting all night long day in and out for the sins that's done in the city like they used to do it are we any better we're getting worse oh our buildings are getting more pretty oh we're becoming more up in the ranks with the other churches but who wants to be like them I want to be like Jesus and that's why every man ought to want to be like Christ let's get him on the scene see and we the the the churches are dying so we've got to do something we got to hurry we ain't got we ain't got to wait till uh to the Millennium to do it if we're going to do it we got to do it now or it's going to die something's going to happen here he goes I don't care his little face is red brother every time he made a step he thought him getting better and better all the time just make a start one time see what happens first thing you know he have to look down the side of the hill and what was happening a little woman e know maybe of his own Parish was setting up on top of the hill and he had know it he had talked to her about it and she had said right out openly she said one time maybe something like this TR you know what I believe that that Prophet over there is a man of God well now sister uh I wouldn't how do you how do you feel about course you can't watch you know where she is just a bait from some of the district man or not you know so said uh well said have you ever heard him oh yes occasionally I've heard him well I remember heard him but I've heard of him so Faith cometh by hearing and I tell you what I believe if if you could get somebody to take me across the sea there in a boat somewhere or where he's at if I could only touch him I'd be made well and here she comes poor little spiny pale face she's coming down the bank look at her stagger and holding on to something and there they're all down there saying good morning rer how do you do doctor glad to have you over here and uh Rabbi glad to have back again look at one another you know little dry stand up there you know used to kind of throw off the you know a lot of people believed on him so he had to watch you know what they said so come back after while this little woman he she said would you help me kind sir to get over there to I'd like to speak with him oh don't you listen to that we're just standing out here we're we're fixing the trapping we got a trap set for him this morning we're really go to get him this morning you just watch see where that's reason we call him hello there doctor here hello Rabbi see we got a trap set for him we're going to upset him this morning so this because they say he knows the secrets of the heart we got it all fixed up for him like somebody had for me the other night got failed when the Holy Spirit come down and I don't know where you noticed or not but it sure it was a great stumble to that old boy and then when when the first thing you know come along said walk down she couldn't get to so she got out on her hands and knees got to crawling between their feet like this till she got up and maybe a little dry stand up there watching her and she touched the barter little please little girl come over her face she went back out there and D to standing watching at you a said I seen her and I know her and she moved through there and touched His Garment and now she's gone back out there and she looks like she's pleased she looks like that she told me one time if she could only touch him that's what would happen she'd get well and I know doctors give her up a long time ago since she's started in menopause with that blood issue she's had it there for years and years and so uh poor little thing I felt sorry for her husband sold the horses and everything paid off the doctor bill and she's just no better than she ever was she poor little thing I feel sorry for her Jesus stopped looked around and said uh who touched me and he said well Apostle said Well everybody's touching you why why you say such a thing as that Rabbi or or Lord she he said but I I got weak I I felt something go out of me a virtue went out of me and he looked around to the little woman and told her blood issue had stop I imagine that courage old gir don't you imagine so directly he he come running through and he said Lord my little girl is laying now at the point of death Lord yeah Master oh yes he's all right he's not a fanatic

crazy people at that time right oh Rabbi Master my Lord my little girl is laying at the porn of death if you'll just come and lay your hands on her she she'll get all right she everything will be all

Holy Ghost I'm giving you his word Peter said on the day of Pentecost one of the critics would stand around he said repent everyone of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy GH ghost for the promise isn't to you and to your children well the bishop told me the Pres told me the district man told me the pastor told me

my father all these promises here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he was wounded for our transgression was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity Chast our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed only believe only believe he's coming soon he brought Abraham Justified him Sanctified him filled him with the Holy Ghost placed him as a son showed himself alive but tur his back and talk and tell what Sarah said in the tent then changed his body and Tuck him out give him the son he's done the same thing through the Seed of Abraham all but change the body Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost place the Sun coming Among Us now showing himself alive and waiting for the change of the Body for the Rapture to come to take us up to meeting here it is just on time only believe just keep marching on God's great big time clocks ticking just exactly right oh for the only believe sure so Jesus finally gets to the house there's everybody Hing oh Lord oh Lord why did you do it why did you do it Jesus walks in just as calmly and quiet that quiet and D down give peace the girl's not dead she's only asleep and then the Bible said they laughed at him he said now you know what kind of a prophet he is when we've got her in bombed and he say she's asleep could you imagine and the Bible said they laughed in the scorn making shame laughed in the scorn you know what he did when they laughed at his word he put him out that's exactly what we'll do at the end and you critic that's what'll happen to you one of these days you laugh at his word and laugh at his works you say them people's Holy Rollers is speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit you say they're a bunch of Holy Rollers you're laughing at his word because that's a word made human some of you preachers out there saying this is mental telepathy or the devil or something like that someday you'll have to take that back in his presence he'll put you out of his kingdom f that's right he won't let people laugh at him he'll put them out again he went through the house and put the whole bunch of them out everybody laugh went out the Bible said if you speak one when Jesus stood there that day and and was Discerning the spirits and then a bunch of priests said Why That's be above the fortune teller anybody knows a fortune teller is a devil so he said that's be above the fortune teller calling the work of God going on an unclean Spirit Jesus said I forgive you for that but someday the Holy Ghost will come then you speak one word against it that's all you have to do and you'll never be forgiven and this whing up the other world you be put out also that's how serious it is yes sir never forgiveness of it in this world or neither in the world to come to blasphemer speak or call the Holy Ghost an unclean thing he put them out you see what's happening today the same thing you see where they're going out going out into the world spiritually remember the last plague hit Egypt what was the last plague hit Egypt which is the type of the church going out was death what's the last plagues hit the Pentecostal Church spiritual death She's going right on back like the rest of the world spiritual death but the circumcised with the blood on the door tuck the Homeward March that's exactly where the pillar of fire going before him to lead him away oh I'm so glad tonight I'm so glad tonight to know that there's a circumcision of the heart that God will cut away all the world and all the traditions of man and everything else and we can see Jesus and see him stand there in a pillar of fire going before performing The Works and doing exactly what God Said would do and bring forth a church filled with the Holy Ghost and doing the works that he said I'm so glad tonight that's I'm so I'm the happiest person in this world because of it because that he promised it yeah he put them out because he laughed at the word yeah and he got them all out and then Jesus was alone with what the Brokenhearted and the faithful he brought Peter James and John faith hope and charity put him in the building with him put the rest of them on the outside then Jesus was alone with the Brokenhearted Believers weeping because that they were their little girl was dead laying there the little thing is laid out a carps flowers laying around her put all the unbelievers out away from him like that oh how hard it is unbelief like last night when we sitting here in the meeting that streak of unbelief struck this place it just it was terrible one of these nights I'm just going to reach right down and call them guys out hallelujah it's going to hurt a lot of feelings but it's good I used to do that all time and you know what but I I've restrained from it just because the feeling of the people because if you pluck up the uh the Terriers you get a lot of wheat too see so now it's too close to the end time now so we just go ahead just keep marching but when it IT hinders the people it really hinders the people that can't have faith they can't believe see when such as that is going on and so then when he got everything out everybody but just his F faith hope and charity standing there Peter James and John the faithful ones and the real believing father and mother he walked over to the carbs see he couldn't have done it standing there all them say why look at that a prophet and say she's asleep now I told you told you told you you see how it is that that there's nothing to it it's just a big bunch of emotion workup that's all there is to it Jesus couldn't do a thing about it and he couldn't do a thing about it tonight when he come to his own country not anything many Works he could do because of their unbelief and them carrying on like that neither could he do it then and he cannot do it tonight but if he could just ever get them shut out to a place that he could be with the Believers then he walked over to the carps that was laying there the little girl was dead perhaps and bombed and laying out walk walked over and tuck her by the hand looked out there into the space World y somewhere where her soul had went and said Maiden arise how could death exist in a presence of Life the little girl the wrinkles on her forehead begin her smooth little forehead begin to wrinkle and her eyes come open he tuck her by the hand and raised her up said give her something to eat don't just don't say nothing about it let him alone out there don't tell him nothing just just go ahead let it go oh my all things are possible only what was he he was the word of God flesh and tonight there that same God is same word of God is in your flesh if Christ is in there and he's the same Lord Jesus you could touch His Garment or whatever you wish to if you'll only believe that he's here he'll do the same thing for you do you you believe it let's bow our heads just a moment I'm going to ask the Argan here if they will go to the ARG in just

little bit about my side of it I was having to wear shoes with special braces in them the only way I could walk comfortably was on the outside edges of my feet like this because my ankles would wouldn't support my way wait and they'd roll in the doctors had told Mom and Dad when I got to weigh 100 lb or so I'd have to get around on crutches I had gotten lost and my dad was working with a Pentecost preacher at General Motors and at Willis Springs Illinois Deb was one of those hillbillies that moved up north to get a job [Music] and Pentecost preacher asked my dad he said what kind of music do you like to listen to and dad said well he said I like hillbilly music if it wasn't Lester flat and Earl scrug dad thought it was noise brother Migel you remember that name Mill you just saw it on the board that was our penos pastor's woman preacher wife that was called out just behind dad about me oh she had eczema in the ear it would it would crack open and bleed I I remembered that and and and she would limp sometimes from the arthritis but at any rate I got lost and uh this Minister had Pentecost preacher had asked Dad to come to church with him and for the first time in many years dad said the last time he remembered praying was in World War II tail Gunner on Navy airplane jet plane swung him behind him had him dead to right he said I watched him set down the triggers and he's gun jammed dad said I prayed them he didn't remember praying again till I got lost 3 years old and [Music] 58 he said Lord I showed the brothers I'm not going to do it to all of y'all but I've got a a birthmark tan that looks like two fish swimming side by side my birthday's February 23rd I'm born under the S of Pisces I love water they was digging ditches putting in sewer lines my dad was afraid that knowing how I loved water that I got down in one of them ditches and got drowned he said Lord if you let us find that boy alive I'll go to church with that man about 30 minutes later the police got a call there was a boy playing in the backyard with their kids and nobody knew who he was he fit my description please went by and got him took me home it was me but my daddy kept a promise to God Amen he and Mom were baptized in jesus' name in a little tank in the the back storage room of that church give their heart to the Lord my dad started studying his Bible so he had some questions about women preachers and uh told my dad said there's a man coming to Chicago said he some people calls him a prophet said he uh calls out people tells them what their name is what's wrong with them and said but the Lord has a mighty healing work said maybe you need to take Force to see him so Dad starts studying what a prophet is and he said about the first thing that really struck him was a prophet had only the the word of God and it always had to be right it couldn't be like Jane Dixon right uh or Jean Dixon right 67% of the time then my dad started telling people that he was going to go to that meeting when the man come up brother brandom and uh they said oh Glenn that's mind reading or it's mental telepathy so Dad got to reading up on that and mind reading was a high powerered guessing game they'd say key words see how you reacted to them words and then lead you on and dad said well if that's what it is I'll sit so far away that he I can't see how I respond to any keyword same thing with mental telepathy so we said in the back of an auditorium that holds about 1,500 people brother Scotty could I get you to take this around and maybe the the government wouldn't want us letting everybody handle it but uh you can see in the very back we sit on the next to the back row but right about the middle of the picture there's somebody there sitting with a something turquoise a shirt or blouse whatever it is we were sitting like right behind them and of course you heard what happened brother Bram said I take every spirit in here under my control we had no prayer card but there was none necessary there was none necessary really for that little girl that I told you about earlier because when she came up the prayer of faith had already been said but that night they took the special built shoes off of me I've never had on another pair of special built shoes Lord since then I've wore gym shoes Indian moccasins Street shoes work shoes work boots hunting boots cowboy boots Indian moccasins flip-flops run barefooted praise the Lord swim fins but no more special built shoes praise [Music] God the doctors told Mom and Dad when I got to weigh 100 pounds I'd have to get around on crutches I'd never been on crutches at 62 years old I had to learn how to walk on crutches for about 3 days because I'll let a Honda gowing motorcycle get away from me me [Music] oh so when I tell you that I feel like God's been better to me than he has to anybody and I know we all feel that way but you understand just a little bit if I start crying a little bit singing God uh you've surely been good to me you you understand a little bit now when I was in my sophomore year of high school at Creek Monon just a about a 30 m south of Chicago the track coach wanted me to go out for the 100 yard dash that's a long way from getting around on crutches amen but that's my God Amen he's here tonight he's here tonight brother Scotty I'm expecting him thank you brother God bless you maybe you can turn the lights out for just a [Music] second I I've even got a testimony about this picture the school wasn't supposed to be open but there was a grade school that had a fire so they had the graduating class from the grade school to meet at Steven T mats High School on the Monday morning I I've never heard of a graduation from grade school on Monday when I got there there was a a lady at the front desk that a young boy walked in with a backpack and she said young man do you have a pass to be here and he said no she said then either you get out of here or I'll have you escorted out by the police I thought oh my my granddaughter wanted to go to this Auditorium for her birthday and so we Googled the address and I hadn't been there since but brother Jordan another picture here I'll let you post it out side where we was waiting to get in uh under the foyer but we walked around to the auditorium and I I told my son-in-law I said this is it and I stepped up to the door and I I looked in they they had double wood doors with the narrow uh glass pane they common going into school auditoriums that way nobody gets hit when the doors open and uh uh there was a a black lady standing there at 32 35 years old and she said sir do you have a past to get in I said no ma'am I don't and she said I'm sorry I can't let you in it's by reservation only because it's the grade school from wherever uh that's graduating and I saides ma'am I said but you don't understand I said ' in 1961 they was having a gospel meeting in this Auditorium down there on the platform there was a man of God I was born crippled in my feet I was having to wear shoes with braces on them and the doctor said when I got to weigh 100 PB I wouldn't be able to walk I I said and the man up there we were sitting right back here next to the back row and he called out my dad by name Mr farmer said you're praying for a boy sitting there there's something wrong with his feet do you believe that God model healing I said that night they took off the special belt shoes she said my I said that was a miracle I said yes ma'am it was she said sir if you would just be very quiet and slip in you can go in I said I also have my daughter and my granddaughter here she said your whole family just be quiet praise the Lord that's how we got these pictures my God's good he opens doors if you've ever read the scriptures pertaining to the church ages in the Philadelphian Church age he said I open doors that no man can shut and I shut doors that no man can open I'm a witness of those things one time we was advertising a gospel meeting and I felt led to go a little convenience store a place called Kosh kanong Missouri and when I walked in I thought what a place to post a bill for a gospel meeting had a flashing C's beer sign on the front window by this time the radio station door was locked and I had walked around the side and the side door was open so I walked in and when the front door was locked I handed them a hand bill that they advertised our meeting God opens closed doors so when I got down to this convenience store I was feeling pretty bold and I hollered halfway across the store do you happen to have a bulletin board where I can post a gospel meeting lady says uh yes right over there do you need any thumb TXS I said' no ma'am I've got my own but I thank you went up to the the center uh the convocation center at West Plains I walked in I said can I post these bills they said no we're sorry they don't allow you to post any bills except for an event that takes place at the convocation Center I said okay she said if you want to go around talk to the administration office you can I said okay where are they at she said well it said uh you can drive around well it took me 30 minutes to find a parking spot I said ma'am I'll just walk she said do whatever you want to I walked around the edge of the building and there was a Filipino woman at the parking lot that was struggling trying to get a folding table out of the back of a little white it was either a a a Honda Accord or a Toyota Corolla small car or or a Toyota Camry rather and uh I said ma'am do you need some help with that and she just slumped her sh she said please I went over it wasn't nothing for a 200 pound man if I was a little heavier then than what I am now I I pulled it out I said and she wret out to to get it it weighed about 20 lbs I said ma'am where do you need to take it and she saidwell just follow me through this door she went through the administration [Music] door oh I just love the way that my Lord works I said where do you want it she said just set it down here in the hall I said by the way ma'am I have some gospel uh meeting bills that I was wanting to leave somewhere do you have a place where I can put she said follow me there was three picnic tables she said just spread them out all over this praise the Lord God opens doors amen church we don't need to sell my God short God bless you if you want to stand to your feet second Timothy 4 I I'm sorry I I don't mean to have y'all up and down be read it again just a second you all have all read in the Book of Genesis of how that Abraham and Sarah met Mel chdc right and when he come see it wasn't brother brandom that knew where my daddy was sitting it wasn't brother brandom that knew that I was sitting on the floor in between them because brother brandham when he said a boy sitting next there he pointed down at the ground I was not visible to William brandham but I was visible to the god of William that one that knew was the one that visited Abraham and Sarah and he told them why did Sarah laugh and brother Bram said she just kind of laughed up her sleeve to muffle it you don't muffle the spirit of God you don't make it so quiet because he knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart but he give them a promise that they would have a [Music] son according to the time of life life and as you and I know she had to take a body change I don't believe the King was wanting to chase a 90-year-old snaggle tooth wrinkled face Grandma he had his choice but she'd been changed to a young and beautiful I've got it pictured in my mind about like I'm going to see all of us here brother Scotty in a few days that we ain't going to be 67 years old 66 years old but we're going to be right at the peak Prime of our youth of 1819 21 year old if you want to know what to look for in me don't look for me with a limp from where I stuck a hatchet in my knee don't look for me with a wrinkled up face tell my wife why if you want a picture of me at about 19 years old standing next to oh Honda 350 motorcycle because that's lot a lot more what I'm going to look like but I won't be wearing them [Music] glasses oh no so I know according to the Book of Genesis according to the time of life after she was made a young lady you sisters you you know about it and all the adults do I'm sure but there's a cycle of life and and where the the sisters would would be fertile on the tape spiritual first off we were there when brother brandom preached the message standing in the Gap when brother way Brother Scott had brother way stay in his home he he he can tell you brother Way's side of the testimony I I've never heard that but brother way brother brandham was talking about a complex and brother way turned around and spoke to his wife and said I resent that if you count playing the tape from about the time that brother brandham started talking about a complex and brother Bram said we all get them until sister way hollered out he's dead a registered nurse dropped down next to him tried to take his pulse it was the the the Tabernacle had three rows of seats uh we were sitting in in the middle row uh about where you all are back there the three four rows back and uh of course brother way was up here on the front about where you are sis and uh brother brandham just walked around on this side of the platform he said uh uh everybody just be real reverent be praying and he went down and it got real quiet and you could hear Brother brandham praying just a little bit and after just 45 seconds or so he stood up throw his hand up in the air and said praise the Lord said everybody just give God the praise the Lord restored my brother's Health back of course on the tape that night you can hear brother brandham say that he said his heart beat about three times real fast like Thump Thump Thump and then just went back to beating normal again just another day in the life of a man of God Amen y on July the 18th of 1965 we were again at the Tabernacle and brother Brandon preached a message entitled spiritual food and due season and there was a prayer line in there and by this time there was four of us kids and why mom and dad wanted another child after us I don't know but they did but my mother had had a lot of complications female trouble uh with my my two sisters uh one that lives in Florida and one that is going to Brother David templeton's church at Hendersonville uh North Carolina tonight and uh they want a child the doctor said no said it it it would definitely be lifethreatening but mom got in the prayer line and and just in front of mom in the prayer line there was a lady that when she stepped up to brother brandham brother brandham said uh uh you're real nervous and you're just the right age to be nervous he said uh uh and you've got female trouble he he said and another thing you have a great desire and that is to receive the Holy Ghost he said do you believe that if I lay hands upon you that the Holy Ghost will come and and she said yes he said you believe that she said yes sir and brother Brenham laid hands on her and he said Lord I lay my hands upon this lady in the apostolic fashion and pray that the Holy Ghost will come Grant it Lord we pray and as she turned to go he he said now remember it's yours it's the children's bread and she walked away and my mother stepped up brother brandham said you had a funny feeling when I said female trouble didn't you cuz that's what you had y'all know by now I don't speak real proper English but I know that had his past T yeah yeah according to the time of life Genesis said nine months and 10 days later on April the 28th of 1966 my baby brother was born that's a deacon at brother Jos Bennett's church over in North Carolina that's my God now if you want to stand and turn to Second Timothy chapter 4 we'll read y'all I I I want you to know I I really enjoyed this morning y'all are a lovely congregation and you visitors greet greet brother Syler for me when you get back he lot of fond memories of even to the 10 of us going deer hunting I'll let him tell you a little bit about that game Wen come out but you you know what we're even giv Dominion brother brother ju over game wens the man was going to write some of them boys a ticket because somebody had had shot a deer and and and where the deer was shot was a bow hunting area where they didn't have to wear color but the area that we was walking across to get to there some of them didn't have their color on and and by the grace of God the the game Mor never rode any tickets but I I I I could keep you for days but I'm telling you this it's no problem for me to sing with what little voice I got says my God is real he's real in my so amen second Timothy verse uh CH 4 and verse 7 and 8 and we find Paul speaking here and he said I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith it wasn't just his faith you know this is about like that Ministry wasn't Paul's Ministry it was the ministry and people have faith people have faith in this that or something else brother one was telling us that that when he was just a child how that he had a hernia but his mother had faith in in a a spring or or a well that they had somebody had seen an image of of some uh Catholic saint there and his mother had faith in that got some of that water put it on the hery and the herni has shrunk down because of her faith people have faith in different things and God honors Faith go back and listen to anointed ones at the end time listen to brother bram's own testimony he said even if I was a hypocrite God would have been Duty bound to have honored that woman's faith I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to us but on to all them also that love his appearing may the Lord bless his word and you all as as we've been partakers of that word you can be seated if you want you know Paul had quite a revelation another thought that Paul had we we see him starting out in uh in Romans 8 verse 1 and 2 I believe it is where he says that there is therefore now no condemnation in those that are in Christ Jesus I don't care what your past is I want you to know that God is not worried about your past it's your future that he's concerned amen amen amen amen there is therefore now no condemnation now I have always looked at that only to a certain degree and that is that oh my in Christ Jesus I am free from the When sin has been placed under the blood could I share just another just short thing with you here for just a second a man walked up uh uh uh through the prayer line and uh he had a a Bad Hat it and when he got up to uh uh brother brandham he said brother he said have you uh placed all of your sin under the blood and he said well I had a bad habit he said have you asked the Lord to forgive you he said yes I did he said when did you do it he said while I was standing in the line and brother brandham said will he must have heard your prayer because it was hid from me that quick it doesn't there's no 90day waiting period there's no 7day cooling off period but when it comes before the Throne of God and it's cast into the sea of forgetfulness it works right now [Music] amen amen but you know there's another side to that that I hadn't considered until here just a few weeks ago there is therefore now no [Music] condemnation in those that are in Christ Jesus because when I am in Christ Jesus I have the life of Jesus Christ that motivates me and when the Lord Jesus walked down to the well at Samaria and that woman come up she had condemnation in her she had condemnation all over her she was not allowed to come up at the cool time of day to get water with all of the quote unquote good women but because of her condition she was unclean to them they didn't want to be defiled by this unclean woman so she could not come to get water at the well at the same time of day that they could and so the Lord Jesus comes up to her and says give me a drink of water and he told older said if you knew of the water that I have you'd ask me for a drink she said the Well's deep and you don't have anything to draw with so then he just started talking to her a little bit the same way that the spirit of God was talking to Mr farmer the same way the spirit of God was talking to Mrs Migel and he started telling her what her past was you've had five husbands go get your husband and and bring there I sir I have no husband maybe a little bit bitter right there we don't know the conditions on the marriage and divorce of the first five but the Lord Jesus didn't have any condemnation in him remember he said he didn't come to condemn the world but to save it that's right and when you and I are in Christ there's no condemnation in us for anybody else either that's the reason why it makes no difference who we're witnessing to it makes no difference if they look like a saint or if they look like a ha we still witness to them can I drop in just a minute of a personal testimony here we we were down at St Louis PTO a city uh about 5 hours south of the US border and uh we were waiting on a pastor that was going to uh to show me around there were five churches in this city and they wouldn't fellowship with each other I said I want to visit all five of the pastors so there was one brother that he told me I know all of them I know where we can contact them and and I will take you so he was going to be there at 8:00 in the morning time in Mexico does not exist so at 9:00 the brother still was not there and and I've got this list of stuff that I think needs to be done today and seeing five pastors is the first thing and then I'm wanting to have have a meeting with them all if I can arrange that cuz I wanted to challenge them to good works I said does anybody know where we can meet this brother they said look there's a deacon in his church that has a bakery over here had a a a a stone oven that was gas fired was how they bake their bread and pastries and what have you and they said uh and so the pastor almost always goes by there and tags bases with the the Deacon I I I said well can you take us he said yes only about a mile and a half or so so we jumped in the car and 5 minutes later we're in front of the bakery and and we walked through the doors and so it had a little step down there and we took that first step and and there was a a young lady uh I'm going to say 24 25ish and she was working at a just a a table uh needing bread up and uh she wasn't dressed the the way that we would really think that a a a child of God should be dressed she she had on a a red jogging suit with a white stripe down the the leg and down the sleeves and she turned back over her shoulder and said something to us in Spanish and brother James Miller told me he said she said I welcome you to S Louis and it it gripped my heart I said brother James I need you I said tell her we have not been welcomed by the Chamber of Commerce of St Louis I said to him we have not been welcomed by the Ministerial Association of St Louis but you have welcomed us as missionaries to St Louis I held up my Bible I said my Bible tells me that if you'll give a prophet a drink of water in a prophet's name that you can receive a prophet's reward I said for you we welcoming us it would be my prayer that you could have a missionary's reward for welcoming us she just kind of slumped down on the table like that when I get started sometimes I just don't know when to quit I said sister I don't know what your walk is with the Lord I said I there's many people that I know of that is young people have had something that hurt their feelings that have caused them to walk away from the gospel by now the Deacon behind me over here is quit working I said but I want you to know that if there's a place in your heart that you want to be in the arms of God there's a place in the arms of God that was tailor made for you and nobody else will fit it actually what was going through my mind was brother Brandon said a quote said that when you Embrace a a woman up to you your wife that it makes an imprint on you and nobody else can fit that imprint I'll use that even in witnessing and testifying to people the young lady started crying about that time there's a young man that was working back here now what I didn't know is this is the Deacon's daughter and the Deacon's brother in the back he's tattooed up like a drug lord because that's the realm that he was in he was working with a a drug running gang he had tattoos all up here he had what we call the athletic t-shirt you know just got the the little strips up here in low cut and solid tattoo and he said what about me he said I've got these tattoos from my past life but see there was another testimony my dad was in the Navy every Navy boy winds up with a tattoo Dad wasn't saved he had a vulgar picture of a woman on his forearm that after he got saved he had to wear longsleeve shirts not because we were Apostolic but he had to hide that tattoo that comes to mine I told him I said sir I said my dad had a tattoo that he was ashamed of after he got saved and he went to a tattoo parlor and he told the tattoos he said I want this thing covered up what can you put on there he said what do you want he said do you have an eagle he said I believe I do and he put the template on there and he said I can cover up everything thing except the woman's elbow where she was like that Dad said well what can you do for that he said I'll put a snake in its mouth dad said do it I described the tattoo the same way I did to you as a church what I did not know is that the flag of Mexico is made up because a man had a vision of where they would place the capital of Mexico and it was going to be next to a lake because there was an eagle that was in a bush with a green snake in its mouth the Perfection of God is unlimited right brother I describe that now the Deacon's back here crying this young man's crying I said you you could go to a tattoo artist that could maybe take a flesh colored ink and cover up the tattoos on your body I said but those tattoos won't keep you awake at night I said but we've got things in our past life that's put tattoos on our heart that will keep us awake at night I said but I want you to know that the power of the bleach blood of Jesus Christ is more than able not only to do away with tattoos on our bodies but the tattoos on our heart and the what's in our mind and to take us back to where we're perfectly pure and clean again by the grace of God we were able to lead those two young people to the Lord right there and within three minutes of the time that we got up from praying the pastor walked in through the door that was going to take us to show us around oh don't tell me he's not an ontime God amen but you know what with condemnation in us we can't tell some we can't address somebody that's not dressed exactly the way we think they ought to be dressed as sister but you know what if we'll follow the leadership of the Lord and just say what he says it'll work out fine every time that may mess with your theology but sometimes our theology needs to be messed with amen amen amen the work of an apostle is to go into a place where there is no church or brother Bram said that that Apostle is a Setter in order it's not just a Setter in order of churches it's a Setter in order of spirits and if somebody's let their Spirit get out of line because of a a mishap of infidelity in a church that it just threw them for a loop and that girl as a 17-year-old girl walked away from God and said there's nothing in it if an elder from the church could fall oh let me tell you what don't put your security and being an elder in the church let your security be in the blood of Jesus Christ and the sealing power of the Holy Ghost Paul had a past life Paul's past life most of us wouldn't even went to hear Paul preach could you imagine are you going to go down and and and and and hear uh uh this man Paul preach you mean the one that tortured Uncle Joe is that the one the one that was standing there holding the coats for everybody when when they Stone my brother-in-law Steven and you you want me to go hear him preach past life what I want to talk to you about for just a few minutes tonight is no regrets we've all got things in our past life uh uh brother Brandon made a statement in Revelation chapter 4 1960 he said this is New Year's night Eve and of course everybody's got a vow wrote out and a pledge and and you're going to make for new years's and and and then about Day After Tomorrow they'll all be broke and so you know you turn over a new page every year and then turn back the page the next morning did it again but there's just one thing that that I would like to say and that is that it's about like Apostle Paul said forgetting those things are in the past all my mistakes and all the things that I have done I press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ and that's the only regrets that I have is my erors for the past year of the past part of my life and I only humbly ask him for Grace to press on towards the mark of the high calling I'm sure that's the testimony of uh of all of us we'd all feel that way amen amen amen but Paul he's already give witness that he was on the road to Damascus and he was carrying could you imagine somebody going and getting letters could you imagine hearing one of the brothers here in the church say I just went to Brother Juan and I got some letters so that I can go down and and persecute and stone anybody that baptizes in the titles of father son and Holy Ghost no because that's not what's in brother Juan's heart he's not going to give you any letters to do that he's going to stop you from doing it saying first why don't you just show him some love and the truth and and see what God does Amen because that's what Christ did so Christ through your pastor Christ through you is going to manifest that same Life of Christ that way but but yet that was where Paul was and of course the hierarchy of the church that he was with they wanted to do away with any sect anybody that didn't see things exactly like them you know brother brandham told us he said if you got two men you got two ideas as I have not found anything that Brother Juan and I disagree on but I promise you you let us spend about a a eight or 10 months together day and night we'll find something we disagree on if it's got to be hot sauce we'll find something I use a little bit of hot sauce but I have never baptized a piece of meat in hot sauce we would find something because you got two men you've got two opinions and and I've said it like this you know uh uh opinions are about like eyebrows everybody's got a couple of them and they raise them every once in a while and but most of our opinions would be a whole lot better off if I if we just stay quiet and say Lord you put words in my mouth not my opinion ain't isn't going to help you but the word of God will establish us and raise us up to a higher level than where we've beenk you Lord now Paul he had been going out with these letters to persecute the Saints and and and bore witness of the the stoning of Sten as we said here just a couple minutes ago and and all of these things that he's doing but you know there come a time oh he was he was scholarly he knew the writings of the word of God he did not have a revelation of the word but he did know the word that was a good thing that's one reason why I try to testify I was telling Brother Juan they've got me on a trucker prayer line where these guys are doing a Bible study and and my my son uh told him a little bit of of something that happened and the man that orchestr ated the whole thing he said give me his phone number I want to talk to him so he called me up they had me on one of their preaching deals where I'm preaching over a phone to these guys no matter where they're at the next Thursday night so every morning that I'm available between 9 and 10:00 I'll call in on this number they'll read through of Psalms brother farmer what's your take on this nonetheless the gospel is preached Hall amen Lord and you know what because most of them are Baptist you know where I normally start out well like I heard a Baptist preacher say one time this friend of mine that was ordained in a Baptist Church by Dr Roy Davis I was working for a Rancher and and and I was sitting up there one time with my just crooked across the saddle horn and and the ranger was it had to be a genuine Herford he wasn't looking for the brand but he was looking to see that it was a purebred herper by the blood tag that was in its ear until they have confidence in me I'll continue to address brother brandham as a Baptist preacher to him brother brandom said when you're talking to a for a farmer you talk about raising and corn but there's one of them right now that's got some questions on the church age Messengers that I'm fixing to have to go up into Northern Minnesota and jump in a boat and fish with it you say brother farmer that's a long way to go no I'm dealing with 10,000 worlds I'm dealing with 10,000 worlds with one soul I know people that'll work day and night just trying to make $1 million do that's right that will perish this 10,000 worlds I'm talking about will not perish amen Paul had baggage Paul had some things behind him that he wasn't real proud of but you know after he come face to face with a pillar of fire and I love the way that the prophet of God said that that every every true Minister must come face to face with that Pillar of Fire amen Paul Come face to face with him and he knew that light with a voice coming out of it because because he knew his scriptures I don't care if they're Baptist I don't care if they're Assembly of God if they know their Bible I want a chance to talk to them hello my son-in-law had his uncle to come to a family get together here not too long ago and and his uncle would had been a a he's got a degree from the the Dallas uh Baptist Seminary and also the one down in in Georgia and he said why is it I'm not seeing any life in my in our churches anymore he said why is it there's no respect to the things of God the way that it was 30 and 40 years ago I said if you'll give me a half an hour before you get out of here I think I can help you with that question I went up to his condo then on Sunday morning he wanted to know what time I I I thought Church time would be a good time we have church at 10:00 I said how about 10:00 he said I'll be ready his wife was sitting over across a typical Baptist lady uh sweet nature she was sitting over there doing whatever she was doing across the room and I asked him I said do you have a Thompson Chain Bible he said I don't have it with me but I've got it at home that I study out of I said okay so I I I just turned over in mine over into the reference part of it and it it's number 42 something but it's got a a a an exposition of the seven churches of Asia Minor and it's almost word for word to what the prophet of God taught it has everything except the church age Messengers and he said I've never seen that so I said okay now let's go over here to Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 and I just went down down through it onto the angel of Ephesus I I said now there would be very few people that would have any argument except that that that was uh Paul and he said sure sure I I I I see that okay then I went on into some would say polycarp but we believe that it's irus now polycarp was a student of John the Revelator but irania studied under polycarp but polycarp leaned towards that organized Spirit but irius was militant against it so he said okay he said yes he said I've heard of some of the works of Iran okay going into colba when we got up to St Martin I I said you know some of them would say it was Patrick but we believe that it was Martin there was nothing in St Patrick where there really was a supernal move he did train the dogs to lay on top of him he escaped because of that and he said how did you know that I said well I read a little bit I said but with Martin you know there come a time that a man died and everybody was mourning what what happened was a young man come and and told Martin he said I want to have power with God the way that you have power with God he said if you want to have power with God the way that I have he said you're going to have to learn to live the way that I live he said you stay here and you pray I've got to be gone for a week preaching when I come back I'll show you how I live not tell you but I'll show you that's free amen I don't think we need to tell people how to live I don't think we need to tell people how to pray we need to show them how to pray need to show them how to live Martin come back and the whole place was in an uproar they were mourning because this boy had died and Martin run everybody out and he laid himself on top of this young man exactly the way that Elijah did and the way that our Elijah laid down on top of a boy named Li that had been caught between two train cars and had punctured his lungs and he was bleeding both of them came back to life and the one that Martin laid on top of came back to life and the one that had to come back to life give a testimony that he was in a dark place but was walking towards a light and two angels came up on either side of him and said you can't have this one Martin calls for it Hallelujah he said I've heard that story but we thought it was only heay I said it's written down I've got a copy of it in my briefcase case at home I said now when we come up to the next angel I said there's very few people that would challenge it at all except that Martin Luther started that Reformation out of the Dark Ages and he said right I agree with that I said now if you're really a hard shell Baptist you're probably going to thank John Smith I said but really we believe that it was Wesley John Wesley who was convert when when John Wesley was converted it was a man was reading the writings of Martin Luther when John Wesley give his heart to the Lord that's a good way for a messenger to come in hearing the words of another messenger I said and isn't it remarkable that during that time the scripture says I set before you an open door and that even our immigration policy in the nation of America that was the most responsible for helping to spread the gospel our uh uh immigration policy was called the open door policy when they was letting people come in from all he said my goodness I I've I've never thought of that i' I've never heard anybody say that I said now if we can identify a man that was the angel to those other six Church ages who is the Angel to Leo deia he said that's why you guys follow that Johnny brandham isn't it I said brother William brandham I said yes sir that's exactly right we believe that's exactly who he is a Baptist man telling me that's why you believe what you believe if they if they know their Bible I'm willing to talk to them because I will use their Bible to show them what we believe amen Amen brother brandham did witness of the Bible but the Bible witnessed of the message amen I'm a little bit off track here as you can tell but when Paul Come face to face with that Pillar of Fire when he when that great light struck him down and spoke to him and said Paul it's hard for you to kick against the priest he said Lord who are you him being a Jew and knowing the scriptures the way that he did there was no way that he would address anything except for Jehovah God as Lord and Jehovah spoke out of that same Pillar of Fire that had led the children of Israel out of Egypt and said I'm Jesus whom you persecute that was a 180 for Paul now Paul was ashamed now Paul don't know what to do but Paul starts getting some Holy Ghost leadership to the house of Cornelius yall know the rest of the story right then Paul starts preaching Christ he's back on he has his desert experience I don't know if y'all have ever heard the tape right after uh one of the Mosby Brothers was killed they were test pilots in Planes they they worked on planes and and what have you and uh the one was uh was killed in that plane crash and brother brandham in his prayer it's almost word word what cesil be deil had when Moses was going across the desert in the Ten Commandments he said Lord these these uh deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into Saints you know sometimes we wonder about our desert experiences but we all have a need of them now Paul gets on the back side of the desert and he's having his his desert experience and everything that 30 years of Gia's teaching had drilled into him gets knocked out of him so that he can be a servant of God he he like I was saying this morning he had to die out to Paul he had to die out to Judaism he had to die out to everything that he was living his life for let me tell you something young people you may go to college you may get a degree I I know that those things are necessary to get a good job and what have you but don't ever put your confidence in a degree we've got people right now that that have a uh Associates degrees bachelor's degrees that are flipping hamburgers down here at Burger King many times they're overqualified for any other job don't put your confidence in that I got a scripture that I like to use anytime I'm a I'm calling on brother Scotty to to address kids that are graduating from high school I give them Matthew 6 and33 seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all the other things will be added don't don't go chase it after the new Jaguar car uh uh don't go chasing after uh uh uh this and that and something else seek ye first the kingdom of God then everything don't go chasing after some pretty woman she may have a pretty face but if her spirit is ugly it'll only lead you to a heartache but seek ye first the kingdom of God and watch and see if God will not put a Godly woman into your life amen I'm a witness of it I was born a a at Englewood Memorial Hospital in the city of Chicago grew up just south of Chicago my wife was born at Water bip Michigan we met at a meeting in Hardy Arkansas where she lived God knows how to pull people together my daddy was born and raised just outside of Knoxville Tennessee and while he was in the Navy going to pick up a prisoner at Corbin Kentucky uh uh because a man asked him do you have any extra Christmas cards he said you want some girls's names to write them to and my dad wrote to my UNC to my aunt my mom's sister and on the way to see my aunt while he was picking up a prisoner in Corbin Kentucky he knocks on a door and it was my great grandmother's door and my mother answered the door and dad walked back to the cab and said I'm going to marry that girl God knows how to pull us together if he can pull your pastor out of Liberia right and bring him to the states when he's went through things that nobody 50 years old should ever seen happen by the time that he is 25 if he can pull him out of that can he not pull us out of whatever scars that we've been messed with if he can bring him to a position that God is allowing him to draw us up because remember brother Bram said you pray for your pastor you lift him up that so that he can bring you into a higher realm then you push him on up higher remember the prophet of God talking about looking over into the circus somebody hold me up okay then I get there to where I can look through the knole he said now when it's God that does it it doesn't require that strength but it's a struggle pastoring is a struggle support your pastor amen you you know how to do it you're 25 years down the road you y'all are such a lovely congregation lift him up in prayer Li you you never know what he's battling because he's carrying all of our burdens amen amen Paul got a [Music] revelation of putting behind us the things that are behind us are you hearing me there is no way that a man that was guilty of persecuting Saints putting Christians to death standing there and sanctioning them being court and jury over them and a bunch of willing executioners with rocks in both hands just waiting to carry out the order he's guilty Stony I couldn't sleep like that I'm saying if I had that on my conscience I could not sleep and neither could Paul but he put it under the blood and to repent is to turn from you don't go sideways to it you turn from it and you go away from it but this man could say I have fought a good fight I have finished my course now church I don't really feel like I'm fixing to die on the way home don't don't get nervous about that but list I have kept the faith and henceforth there is laid up for me this isn't a guilty man he didn't say there's laid up for me an electric chair there's not laid up for me condemnation but there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day I'm just going to stop right here and ask a question question have you got something in your past life that's still aggravating you do you know what I normally find people come up through a prayer line and there they say uh somebody did something to me and I I I just I I'm finding it real hard to forgive them and I've seen it Time After Time After Time do you know what the real reason is there's something in their own past life that they can't forgive theirself for and because they can't forgive theirself they have trouble forgiving somebody else I'm going leave y'all probably very early in the morning I'm in I'm an early riser if I wake up at 4:00 and I feel unrested I'll be leaving at 4:00 brother one or five just whenever I wake up but when I leave Brooklyn Center I want no regrets I want no regrets from anything in my past and I want no regrets from anything present I know I've told you this morning and also this afternoon there is nothing that Rivals there's nothing close to the importance of the Seal of the Holy Ghost in your life Paul could not have made that state without the Seal of the Holy Ghost in his life I'm not talking about a baptism I'm not talking about a Sanctified life that those things are wonderful there's people that don't even believe in the Holy Ghost that that it's available to people that still live a Sanctified life there's people that have quit drinking that are atheist there's people that have quit smoking there's people that have quit immoral uh uh living just because I'm not just talking about a Sanctified life but I'm talking about the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us that is Paul said I have no regrets brother brandom on a tape called the prison a prisoner you know sometimes we we think that we know things and we think that we remember things and when I tried to find this quote it was not there and I said I Lord lead me and my wife and I was laying on the bed here last week and I I said pull up uh Paul a prisoner she said when was it I I said well I I said I can tell you the year I I know it's 63 but I I don't know the date and and she said I'm not find it I said oh yes it is I I said wait a second I'll I'll go find it I went and got my hardbound volumes where I knew it was I had it all marked up but I didn't have this quote marked up the reason I couldn't find it is brother brandham did not say regret he said regretting but it's on the tape Paul a prisoner and he said and I I can't see here where Paul was regretting anything and saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he was addressing himself I I believe that Paul as he wrote this letter with that pen and that it was the Holy Spirit causing him to write that amen that maybe even to this night that we might pull out the context of our text to show why Paul did this because it's scriptural and scriptural is eternal I believe that sitting in this dingy old jail that Paul wrote to his colleague here that his brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could express it by seeing what was around him now he was in jail but it wasn't what he was speaking to this the servant of Christ a minister with him he was speaking that he was a PRI prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ cuz Christ is the word and Paul had been a great scholar in his day and he had ambition and he was a he was a man that had been trained with by people a a fellow by the name of Gia which was the great teacher of the day one of the greatest schools that he could have went to uh for instance like we say weaton or Bob Jones or or some Fundamental school that he had been uh taught as a minister of the word and he was well educated and smart and an intelligent boy with a great ambition and maybe someday becoming a priest or a high priest to his people he had an ambition and then to find that this great ambition he had been trading for and for all of his life and maybe from the age of 8 or 10 years old up to about 30 or 35 when he finished college and graduated and had all of his diplomas and everything and stood in good with all the the clergy even to the high priest at Jerusalem he had orders from him personal orders written and trusted uh with this uh great Saul to go down to Damascus and find all those down there that worship God contrary to what he said and to bind them and to put him in jail if necessary he had orders to put them to death if he wanted to see he was he had great ambition and now all that he had been trained for God had took it all out of him see and what his objective was and what his father had spent money for and the Ambitions of his father and mother and all was taken away from him because that God had something else therefore he was a prisoner from his objective that he had in life and he had become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who was the word that road to Damascus changed Paul going down about 11:00 perhaps in the day he was stricken down and he heard a voice a voice saying Saul why persecutest thou me and he looked up and looking up being a Jew and knowed that Pillar of Fire was the Lord that led the children of Israel because he knew what it was remember that Hebrew would have never called anything Lord capital l r d Elohim unless he had been satisfied that that's what it was because he was a trained scholar and and and when he looked up and he saw this light a pillar of fire that led the the people through the Wilderness and and he said Lord Elohim capital L Lord who are you and what a surprise it must have been to this Theologian uh to to say I'm Jesus the very one he was so against oh what a turnaround oh oh it must have been something terrific for this man and all of his Ambitions that he had to find out all at once that he had been persecuting his Ambitions had driven him had drove him to farther away from the main thing that he meant to do and what a what a great shock it must have been for this Apostle when he said I am Jesus the very one he was persecuting why persecutest thou me another little quotation we might drop in here you see as they make fun of the church they're not really making fun of the church they are making fun of Jesus why persecutest thou me how could Paul then with all his intellect believe that this was that this group that he was persecuting was the very God that he claimed to be serving I think that's without going into details I think we're all well trained enough to know what I mean here the same thing is happening today Paul through ignorance was yet intelligent and smart much smarter than those uneducated galileans that he was persecuting that had already in their humility accepted this man as Lord but Paul in his great teachings and his intellectuals could not accept that what a turnaround it must have be to him on his Road and he was stricken blind that what a Turner uh not to carry out his commission but it led him down to a place in a street called straight to the house of one and then come the prophet down there by the name of ananas who saw in a vision saw him coming saw where he was at saw where he was and went in and said brother saw the Lord appeared to you on the road down sent me that I might lay my hands upon you and you receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost they come to the music and just play real softly Softly and Tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home there may not be a CER in the building I hope that there's not but if there is I'm going to tell you tonight just like I told that young lady just like I told a couple men that I had the church to pray for me when I went down after them I said I'm targeting them you may think that's a cruel way of saying it but my daddy taught me this if you aim small you miss small I was going after two souls and by the grace of God both of them came home that [Music] weekend it might be that somebody doesn't need salvation but you're just in that old gray Twilight Zone where you had a taste of the Holy Ghost and you know that it's for you but you know that you're not sealed just talking this week with an elder that he said for years he he said I knew that I'd been changed I knew that I was a different man but I did not have that seal upon my life it happens in churches all over not because we don't have good pastors we've got the best pastors the Lord Jesus told us in Jeremiah I'll give you pastors after my own heart we've got them they feed us the word of God they don't feed us their ideas they don't feed us somebody's Theological Seminary training but they feed us the pure on adulterated word of God thank God [Music] for but the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a personal relationship between you and the king of glory where we totally lay down everything our degrees don't matter anymore our Ambitions of saving up for the new Mustang don't matter anymore I've got got to win the heart of this little girl doesn't matter anymore I've got i' I I've got to look cool for that boy does not matter anymore but the only thing that matters is your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and him alone would there be a one everybody body just close your eyes you're not raising your hands to brother Forest brother Forest can't do one thing for you on the Seal of the Holy Ghost except to lay hands on you and pray and I've already prayed for the church I we pray that the Lord would build a hedge around you all as individuals that if you don't have the Holy Ghost that you'd be shielded from the the the work of the enemy until God can put that solid stamp of approval on you that your word is the same as his word because the bride does nothing except she has thus sayith the Lord for we've got his word for it that's why we can move with the confidence that we move you just want to raise your hand and say oh brother I I I I know I've got something because I'm not the same but but I don't know that I've got that seal but Lord I want no regrets when I leave this building tonight because I know that you were here we were talking about the Lord and wherever that we talk about him he comes that sweetness that we feel here tonight that's him we've been Witnesses of it all day long all weekend long he's here and he's here for you it's not by chance that we come together it's not by chance that I'm 800 miles away from home it's not by chance that some of these brothers have come in distance no it's him he's brought us together and can you not hear him just wooing over you the there the words those are words that the psalmist David under inspiration crying out the words of the Lord Jesus wouldn't bring down years later oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have gathered you together I would have covered you over with my wings the way that a mama chicken would cover up her brute that's what he's doing now even through the brother listen to the music the the the sweetness of the song that that my brother's playing he may not even have that ability of himself although he's talented but there's something coming through the music that it's more than just a Yamaha piano if he's calling out to you oh don't turn him away it's his desire he Longs more for us to have have that seal of God in our life and we are even to ask you for it he wants everyone in this building to step into that adoption you heard the prayer line brother brandham said by faith that we see a healed body and we step into it it's the same way by faith you walk into a sealed adoption that adoption [Music] ceremony says this is my [Music] son this is my daughter and God Bears witness in our life just raise your hands to him say oh Lord I surrender all that's what our raising up of our hands is it's just a sign of a total surrender to him Lord we're not holding nothing back here to this evening Lord you see our hands raised up young people even the children Lord just just Desiring to know that they've got you the seal of approval upon their life Grant it dear Lord father our elders Let It Be Lord You've manifested your spirit through them Lord if there's a one that would just have a question maybe the enemy and battle them over something that they have had in their past oh God help them to see that when it's placed under the blood that you see nothing but the blood you're not looking at us you're not looking at our past life but you're looking at that perfect sacrifice that was the perpetuation of sin it was the total atonement for everything that was in blood oh God let him not miss that granted dear Lord that the enemy would no longer have any kind of a hope in any way at all Lord and that you could have the preeminence when we wake up as they sung that song tonight I I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on Jesus I'm walking and I'm talking I'm singing and I'm shouting with my mind stayed on you Lord let it be oh god father this weekend they start mile 26 let it be more glorious Lord than 25 was we're closer Home than what we was yesterday Lord father there's people here

God even a prophet in a room one time getting ready for service and an old woman trying to dress up like a young woman and a police officer playing a slot machine that was against the law in that state and brother brandham looks over the scene he said oh God why don't you just wipe the thing off the face of the Earth how can you even stand this and the spirit of God says come over here son I got something I want to show you and he said that this circle of blood was just buffeting the Lord Jesus and him carrying this load he said oh God is that the sins of the world just [Music] yours and he come back and apologize to that woman and said ma'am could I sit here for just a second she said I already have company he said I don't mean it in that way said I'm a [Music] minister oh it's sometimes hard for a preacher to get down in apologize it's hard for elders to walk up to a young man and say son I'm sorry I smarted off to you I I answered you too sharp I shouldn't oh it's hard for
