coming over to Jordan and faiths here on Wednesday night and I'd gotten off the freeway and was just turning I'm getting ready to make a left-hand turn onto the McKnight Road which is the main road that comes by their place and I was at the light they were doing some road construction there about a half a block down on the left-hand side and so anyway finally got the green light and I just kind of hesitated it was just kind of surveyed what was going on with the construction and I was getting just starting to roll forward and I heard this car or this engine just winding out as if it was accelerating coming from somewhere I couldn't see it and all of a sudden this car just whizzed by me and they had completely run run the red light probably going about 50 miles an hour and I slammed on my brakes and the Lord kept me him and like I drove over the block a Wednesday now I would have been sitting there Wednesday night if I would have just gone I like normal I would have got crushed so this you know the Bible says in psalm 46:1 god is my refuge and strength a very present help in trouble even when we didn't even have time to pray didn't even know what was going on yet he just keeps us my when we get over to the other side we're going to find out I think we'll find out things that where God just protected us over and over and again Saints so God is good he men amen hallelujah so I'm glad to be here hallelujah yeah homemaker she got inspired a Christian woman and she wrote a poem and she mailed the poem to a Christian friend of hers [Music] and when this Christian woman opened up the letter and read the poem she put it on the piano of her son's and so he could read it when he got home from work so when he got home he saw the letter sitting there on the piano you open it up read the poem and immediately God gave him the inspiration to write the tune that went with the words and of course it's a very familiar song we've sung it a number of times

this time together there more and more this Holy Ghost is becoming real to us the Holy Ghost is leaving the pages of the Bible it's getting on to feeding becoming real to us than ever before praise the Lord this morning I want to talk speak on children of the promise you know Jesus he spoke about children of the Resurrection you know when the Pharisees came to him and I was asking him you know trying to trick him about the you know the woman that was married to this man in in he there he never had a try and then the next brother came for wish of course that promise was fulfilled in a life of tema Judas daughter-in-law and then the next brother came in the next brother came in seven of them a type of the seven church ages and then they asked Jesus Christ and said well in a resurrection if there is a resurrection whose wife would they be you know trying to prove that there will not be a resurrection and Jesus said you do earth not knowing the scripture and the power of God because the power of God is attached to him to the right interpretation of the scripture you know so he said well in the resurrection you know we will be just like angels you know Berta Branham Celie in a beautiful way he says we will have this thought not you but the glance will be taken away you know so and Jesus said there he spoke that you know we are the children of the Resurrection and in last week we were talking about children of the light and so today we want to speak about children of the promise praise the Lord and children of the light children of the Resurrection children of the promise they are all the same and we just reminding ourselves what really we are praise the Lord Amen because our promise is a resurrection our promise is the light of the hour so we are children of the promise who read from Galatians chapter 4 this morning praise the Lord let's read Paul letter to our brothers speaking to that I don't know who was bothering those people for her to stream Adam foolish Galatians I don't know who was bothering me praise Lord you know we have to be politically correct these days when we are speaking so we can talk like Paul well let's read from verse 27 amen for it is written rejoice thou barren the baronet break forth and cry there that traveling near for the desolate have many more children than she which have an husband we know there this is a promise from from a Zion now we brethren as Isaac was the children of the promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what's here at the scripture cast out the bomb man in her son or the bomb woman sorry in her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be here's with the son of the freewoman so then brethren ye are net children of the bondwoman but after free let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we'll be looking a few things from your your Holy Scripture this morning we want to ask the Lord guide you give us author is Lord bless us with your Holy Spirit father may we now say thanks to God just to please our self in our thoughts law but father may we come in summation law to your Holy Spirit things that will be said law that we edify your people and that will bring us a closer in our walk with you father we have a promise Lord as a church of a church that will be translated we come under the promise father of inner to walk with you we want to walk with this promise in our heart and we can do it until father we know the promises that are given to us we commit ourselves in your hands now for yearing and for speaking bless your word in Jesus name we pray Amy praise the Lord Allah bless you can have your seat a mean-ass care thank you for the the songs this morning Amen I rather have Jesus praise the Lord I rather have Jesus you know Jesus said in the scripture he said here he says search the scripture for indium you have eternal life praise the Lord and you will realize that in the bulk of st. John there are many places where Jesus said as it is written in the scripture we read one in st. John chapter 7 and azza as as children of the Scriptures as people you know that is honor the promise of the word I will encourage you whenever you read in your Bible and yes most especially reading over in the New Testament because that's where you will find this in most of the time whenever you come to the place word it is written as it is written in the scripture pause for the wine and maybe you could do a little Bible study and try to go back and see which scripture where is it written in the scripture because there are a lot of places jesus said as it is written in the scripture it's not a direct scripture it's not a direct Scripture but what he's saying is fulfilling something that the prophets have said that's what makes the scripture because the scripture is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit so you see that Jesus is grabbing the touch of the Prophet and that is the same thing that is happening in our day God has sent us a prophet he has given us giving us a message of the hour but we have the Holy Ghost to be able to bring us what the Prophet was saying grabbing the touch of the Prophet so let's look at a little bit there let's go back as in John chapter 7 I read that on Wednesday night I almost got caught in it but I just decided that that would have taken a little bit of my time verse 37 so let's do a little Bible study then we get into our subject that we want to talk about verse 37 in the last name that great day of the feast which was the last feast the feast of the tabernacle Jesus stood and crying If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of water so Jesus is quoting the scripture year as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of water now we go back and look a little bit in the profits and look at some few prophecies back there but I want to grab your attention here to realize that Israel was celebrating there are seven feasts they were in a time of the offense in this last feast which is the great feasts is the feasts of the tabernacle and the feasts of the tabernacle is word the people the babe tanks boots you know they bring out their camp houses and they spread him in you know in in the field and everybody go into their tents remembering that when when they were traveling with God the word intense as they go as they were going through their journey before they got to the promised land so in one sense God was there covering God was the a tabernacle so they are remembering this how God brought their fathers true from Egypt over to the promised land before they got to the promised land to have a land of their own to have a field of their own to have a house of their own during their 40 years joining the wind from one heart to another heart and won't tabernacle to another tabernacle 110 to another 10 so every time they come and they remember their how God was there covering praise the Lord amen how God was there covering now if if we understand that it's easy for us to understand the tenth vision of brother Branham it's not a literal thing the 10 is God is our teint he's our covering he's the one that is keeping us as we are going in our joining the scene where he kept Israel from 110 to another thing he told Israel never dwell in the house you know that's what he told Solomon I've always talked you from one thing to another thing God's messenger through the ages was Luther was his tent after justification Westley became another tent and that God word in after that dispensation the Pentecostal also had a messenger there was a tent praise the Lord I hope I'm not going too fast for you but here is here is where I want us to to also realize here Jesus he looking in a field and he see what Israel is doing now remember now Zechariah the Prophet have said the Lord that you suddenly seek we come to his temple so Jesus their body was another tent that God was dwelling and now he's looking in the field and seeing Israel observing what he's fulfilling because he's the tabernacle he's the one that is tabernacling God and he looks in the field and he seed him and the scripture says a move him there he stream and he crowd but realize what he identified in this cry he says if any man thirsts if any man thirsts that that is the entrance of the Holy Ghost you have to have a terse there must be something that you are thirsting after he look at them in the field observing the Feast of the tabernacle and he cried out if any man thirsts is there a church after the people I fulfill is something that I really in the law that they have been taught about but is there at church is there really a terse if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink amen he that believeth on me as the scripture have said let's look at some few scriptures here as we study these together as I chapter 12 as I have chapter 12 as the scripture have said as the scripture has said as I chapter 12 verse 1 and in that day thou shalt say O Lord I will praise thee though there what angry with mean the anger is turn away and they are comforted me behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my son he also has become my salvation verse 3 therefore with joy Shaya draw water out of the wells of salvation with George ie draw waters out of the well of salvation let's look at another promise as I have 44 there are few of them there I just wanted for us to look at this one let's read from verse one yet now year-old Jacob my seven in Israel whom I have chosen that said the Lord that make it be inform thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o Jacob my seven and their Jerusalem whom I have chosen for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and and flawed upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit so you see he's he's comparing the water here with his spirit wish of course that's what the scripture said when Jesus went back to this prophecy I will pour my spirit upon that I see and my blessing upon down offspring and they shall spring up as I'm on the grass okay so then there is just there is just few of them there in the prophets so Jesus saying this as it is in a structure now you are we have to know that I mean he's he's the fulfillment of the law so when he says as it is in the scripture he's just not making it up as I was telling there last night I came across different different opinions and different things you know that people were saying someone said was Jesus referring to you know a book that was narrating you know if you were refer to anything it has to be in this book amen praise the Lord so we want to we want to look at their but this is the thing that is interesting in their prophecy because he's speaking about the the Holy Spirit is speaking about the promised to come the the online thing in there for you and myself is he that earth there had to be a church Amen there has to be a desire for more of God you know then just church membership for more of God and just claiming to be in the message there has to be a terse for this word to be made flesh in us praise the Lord and a beautiful thing that I saw also during this time of the Feast of the tabernacle and all during this time there are two things that Israel would do there will be a pouring of water you know because that is the thing that you know is part of I call it the ritual that they would do during this feast you know they have to be pouring water every every all through the seven days they have to be what up just pouring out you know just pouring out just pouring out so it was all part of the feasts now you have to think also about the smitten rock you know and it was since Moses you know since he had the rock for water to come out I mean there was water pouring out of the rock you know all the time now so we realized that was what they were they were they were manifesting or they were kind of a playing out during that time so they had it they had a time of the pouring out of water and also the pouring out of wine you know both of them happy together the pouring out of water then important our wine during this time of the feasts so so we see that Jesus was just referring back to the scripture not making of something but he was referring back to the scripture because it's written in the world so we want to look at the children of the promise we have to look at the children of the promise the reason why I came back to this because our promise is the Holy Ghost this promise is on to you and to your children and to many as the Lord our God shaq-casso that's why we would be looking at this morning as we look to get them praise the Lord now let's wash this also it will come out and now as we go alone but as Israel gather together I'll share with you on Wednesday I was talking to a sister and and this is actually what I was talking about trying to compare it what is happening I mean everything that is going on now and with with our walk with the Lord there was three cuts Israel had they oughta cut their was influenced by the natural light it was influenced by the daylight those that were on the auto called the only thing that was giving them light was the daylight it was either the Sun or the moon then Israel also had the inner core the inner call was influenced by candle lights if you come from the altar call and you get in the tent there is no sunlight coming true the only thing that was making light in the inner core was the candlesticks and those candlesticks was light from the offering the fire was taking from the offering to learn the candlesticks and and and one candle will light another candle and it would take the light from there and go to this to the tear one until the seven candles were light but the inner core what was producing light for the inner court was candlestick a type of church influence but when we come to the holiest of holy it was not influenced by natural light it was not influenced by may make a mistake light it was influenced by the Shekinah glory Prelude what was making light behind that curtains was the Shekinah glory the presence of God it was the presence of God that was making light there was no candlestick there was no sunlight I was getting behind a veil it was just the presence of God that was making if the priest would do anything behind there he will have to benefit from the presence of God so we realized that even us as believers God is bringing us true out of the sphere we will be dealing with the body spirit and soul this morning as we talk about this subject of children of the promise praise the Lord so in our walk of justification is is a natural light we are stay under the influence of you know the the sunlight the moonlight we get over to centrifugation as we get closer to God we can be verbatim talks about this in [Music] impersonation of of Christianity he spoke about there as well and we will realize that we get to the place of a candlestick light word church church life influence us you know church life influence us but when we get to that place of the baptism of the Holy Ghost were we are under the influence of the word we have a conviction of what we are doing we are not doing it because the pastor says it or because the message says it we are doing it because God have dared with us we have a personal experience that is real to us then we are to the place worth we are walking in the light and the light is his presence is his presence is his word his word his presence is the same for us walking in the light as he is in the light praise the Lord he is in the light he is the light that is leaving us that is guarding us so we want to look at this thing about the children of the promise now if you go over to Galatians chapter four year I think Paul you know working with these believers he tried to make this subject clear to them that he had to bring Abraham on the scene and he had to talk about Abraham see praise the Lord now we have to realize that the promise was given to Abraham and the scripture says Abraham and his sea poor make emphasis on it that it was near seed with an S it was seed without an S speaking about one when God promised Abraham God promised him by your seed you become the father of many nations so it was one praise the Lord now so we realized Abraham in his journey waiting for the fulfillment of their promise God distracted that's another thing I also wanted to to talk about good that a loyal kind of for remind me yeah let's let's look over the back in the book of Galatians where we just read the structure makes something very very very strong here and I want us to I want us to realize that I don't know I don't want for it to go away from me so let's let's look at their back again the Bible says mmm-hmm pray the Lord okay that is verse verse Teddy 3-0 chapter 4 nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman now dealing with scripture yet as they're caught my mind also just like I told you every time you come across scripture you have to pause because it's something that is in a word but watch this is so beautiful what Syria the scripture cast out the bondwoman now you have to realize that it was not God that told Abraham to cast out the bondwoman it was zero and then when Abraham going to pray God to Abraham yes do what she said it was it was Sarah that brought the argument you have to cast this woman out because she's despising me and when Abraham went to God God told him yeah do what she said so which mean God was pleased with Sarah decision that he makes it a stretcher it became a commandment for God he places in his word he was pleased yeah do what she said okay let's come back praise the Lord Paul said as it is written in Scripture so wish me draw recorded there Sarah that was a good saying it praise the Lord now so Abraham in his joining here keeping this promise remember a Genesis chapter 12 the word of the Lord came unto Abraham for him to separate from his nation his kindred you know in his father house God gave him a promise to become the father of nation nations so here is Abraham in his journey waiting on this promise God telling Abraham I mean Abraham telling his wife what God have said and you know birdbrain I'm kind of foreplay it out the winter shopping the bar things for the baby you know they were happy you know rejoicing they were just on the the light of the Sun and the moon you know a lot of emotion you know in their first state of justification you know we believed the law praise the Lord hallelujah god is good to us you know the sun is shining everywhere amen praise the Lord so the keeping this promise that went on and on five years and six years in and downing and and the promise is not coming now Cyril is the one that came to Abraham and says well and you know I'm not doubting what you were saying wish of course she was doubting you know but I mean I'm getting old and you are getting all in you know and she brought Hagar into the picture now as brother branham deal with this subject and even poor deal with it as we will look at what he was introducing here is dead because of their doubt another woman was brought into the picture let's bring it into a time he came unto his own and his own received him net because Israel did not receive him he turned onto the Gentiles poor in the book of Acts he says that now we turn unto the Gentiles so he had to be with us in a Gentile dispensation before he goes back to Sierra that the promise was given to so because of doubt Ishmael was brought on the scene because of doubt brother Branham said when Eve doubted the word praise the Lord remember now as we keep we want to keep this in in a place word as we talked about the author called Enoch all we talked about Sarah and Mary we want to always keep keep it to ourselves the flesh the spirit and the soul the board is spirit and soul this flesh was produced because of doubt this flesh will always struggle with doubt and fear we will always struggle with doubt and fear as our age change a man born of woman is of a few days and full of trouble amen so every time you have a birthday is fear and doubt you deal with amen praise the Lord what do we go and look in the mirror fear in their time I was what's wrong with my face do you mean I'm getting great feeling they out praise the Lord now so because of doubt because because of fear a little sense of here here there well Abraham are you sure you know okay yes yes hey Goering and an Ishmael was born now according to the scripture he was a widening and this flesh your flesh will be wide you will have to keep it under control Ishmael was a white man your mind will go wide running around all over the place until this promise become real to you brother Branham said rock and roll we get a hold of the young people until they are born again so whether they are born in the message or out of the message until that true of conviction come rock and roll there will not be a fit to rock and roll because of doubt that why man is born are we together praise the Lord we're been said here let's let's just read a little bit and the seed is not had with the shock he said now in Gallatin fall 27 I wish to read these words and then he went on and read the scripture I think that I think I kind of a pudding here because I didn't wanted to forget the scripture so we read that already so let me net okay let's look at Israel in Egypt he said neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they the children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called there is it he says they wish the children of the flesh those are not children of God because the children those are not children of God but the children of the promise accounted for seed the children of the promise promise what what kind of promise that God promised before the foundation of the world so it's a great promise it's not just a natural promise it was something that God had in his mind and what is that promise manifests in his attributes bringing his songs and daughter in every age praise the Lord so we have to realize that what he had in his mind from the foundation of the world he started with Abraham and he was going to bring them in every age so this promise is not just a promise of time it's an antenna promise that's what is tied to the Holy Ghost the promise that he had in his mind he told him that the seed now because you quit doing this and you quit doing that you quit line you quit stealing there's just more as a good citizen we'll do that amen you can call yourself a Christian here until something in here has happened until you are regenerated or something as happen in year he says notice for this is the word of the promise at this time I would come and Cyril shall bear a son just like he said to Israel I would come down with the mighty hands and bring you out at this time according to the time of life I would come down so that promise is God coming down and getting the hood of your body it's God coming down and making himself real to you praise the Lord and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived listening even but our Father Isaac put on your jacket now he said get your helmet ready this would turn you around for the children being not yet born that is either and Jacob neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election I'm letting death soak a little time wake up now just a little one either and Jacob before either child was born for they even knew what was right or wrong and that election of God might stand not of works but of him that calleth well I taught you quit eating meat you get safe you have nothing to do with it amen if you I save God call you before the foundation of the word and save you praise the Lord and he just kicked everything from our hands there is nothing we can hold to and say because I did this praise the Lord and we're having a little a Bible study and prayer meeting yesterday and we were talking around this and and and I said you hear many people that say is the other well if you know if I'm pretty estimated you know if God's northern and predestinated I'm predestiny if God know that I'm elected I'm if I'm an elect a mean Ilic it's true God knows but you don't know praise the Lord God knows but you don't know and that is the reason why when that grace comes to us we have to humble ourself because we don't know praise the Lord for a son of God or for a daughter of God go and never lost his own but what will happen to you down the road is that because he knows and he had a time that he has ordained for you to be saved and because you were careless when grace calm you will live the rest of your life regretting that's what happened to Paul he could I mean he knew that he was forgiven he knew that he was the messenger of the age but every time he thinks about standing there and witnessing Steven being killed verbatim said he he felt like he had taken a life for the gospel so he needed to give his life praise the Lord election and predestination is not a subject you can wrap your mind around it's not a subject you cannot put up your chest and say I'm predestinated and be walking all over the place it's not it's not a him on subject those are things that God did before the foundation of the world before there was time there is no way you can explain it in time the structure only gave was an idea for us to appreciate what God has done for us praise the Lord Amen I don't want to sound like Paul yet to the Church of Galilee and I mean we write in the book of Galatians so if the anointing of gallatin is on us or we can do we just submit to a taming praise the Lord but we have to watch this because I believe there is a reason why you know the Lord has has taught us these things to help us to be able to walk in the days that we are living in praise the Lord Amen so we see here Abraham in Sarah brings Hagar on the scene she was the one that introduced Hagar into the Promised Eve was the one that introduced the flesh into the promise so after the why Hagar brought a white man which is a type of this flesh and and and Sarah had a gentleman which was Isaac the Promised One praise the Lord he was the one that Sarah even-even God right there in Genesis chapter 15 the reason why God took Abraham out that evening to offer a sacrifice and he brought darkness is because Abraham cried to him that morning and said O God that was after Ishmael was born o God I have done all of these things I walk in your word I've been keeping this promise I know I know I know we made a mistake Ishmael came on the scene we have pulled him away he said but can I take Eloisa this boy was born in my house he's been faithful to me can I take him as my son the son of promise God said no the promise I gave to you who come by Sara so God took him out to show him there take your hands from this thing Abraham I'm gonna put a deep sleep on you God I made a promise I swore by myself I would bring it to pass amen praise the Lord so we see here the promise came to pass faithful as it was born went on the mountain with his father praise the Lord prepared the altar father everything is ready were the sacrifice I mean he was just so such a young sighs a boy I mean so anxious to see a sacrifice not knowing that his father was going to tie his hand and feet and put him on the altar he mean but we realized there after everything he grew up and he wanted to Mar it and his father told him what I'm gonna say in early Iza and he was patient he was obedient he I mean everything he was just everything but look at his own age he was born son of the promise he was born a prophet but when he got to their own age he got blinded there was a blindside he got deceived by his own son he could recognize the voice and no other voice is easy I mean the voice is Jacob but when I touched the hinge and God Hey him honor that deception because a promise was given to Rebecca that the order was self the younger trace of Lord now Isaac that is a type of the promise he will come over talk that spirit men pretty soon yes the reason why we cannot hold to God's work based on feelings because you're feeling can lie to you Isaac feelings lied to him I'm feeling like this I'm feeling like this we're not called to feel we call to believe praise the Lord like someone said if you rest on your feeling you will not even get up from bed you don't get it from there when it comes to spiritual things people want to be led by their feelings when you can when you can I rely on your feelings for your natural life why you want to rely on your feeling for spiritual things [Music] when the snow is coming down water you feel good and now you get in your car and you go to work so you see in their room he was received there is or the spirit but when it comes to Mirek when it comes to married which was the three women that were transporting verbatim said they were carriers of the sea you cannot say that because of doubt Ishmael is not a seed of Abraham he's a seed of Abraham he's the son of Abraham but he's not the promise praise the Lord and you can say because Isaac in his little years rely on his feelings and give the blessing to Jacob then either he was named the seed of Abraham he was the son of Abraham now you see God had to keep it away because the promise of that seed was not for natural life it was a promise from the foundation of the world so God had to break the time he had to every bring I mean Isaac to the place where the type would be broken but when it comes to marry one it was not a sexual birth so God just took men from out of the picture he provided the blood cells he provided alive Mira was just a carrier of the seed because they see from the foundation of the world that God promised to his children was not of human you know interference we are just carrier of the sea this Holy Ghost we are talking about we are just carrier of it that's the reason why we have to be chana it has to flow through us we can borrow air we can story for nothing it has to flow through us because we are just carrier we have to carry to our neighbors carrying it to work hula girls want to go to the mall carry it to the mark and be a son of God Amy so marry in my notes I said marry how him they had taught it not robbery to be equal with God he humbled himself he was God but he thought it not robbery to be equal with God he humbled himself even to the death of the cross praise the Lord now we have to realize that when God told Abraham by your seed you be the father of nation what was God doing realized that a judgment has come in the time of Noah God was just reviving the promise that he gave to Eve because he have also said to Eve the seed of the woman speaking of once he will bruise the head of the Sepik so God now was was bringing their promise that he gave to Eve because it was given to the woman now here he's hiding the promise from the devil he's giving the promise to Abraham but after they were watching to come against to destroy their seed he realized that when Ishmael came God was there speaking of their seed so he said well I'm going to put Sarah into a problem get down there put a lustful spirit upon Abimelech because he wanted to to stop God's promise from coming to pass are we together now brother branham over and over he helped us to see how that was a carrier even in when we were not born again I mean there was just something in our natural life now we can look back and say oh I see why this was happening to me I see why I didn't like this because there was a carrier Hagan was a carrier a type of the white man the flesh praise the Lord Sarah was also a carrier she brought a very gentle man humble obedient by the end almost at the end of his journey he realized that we can we can rely on our feelings the promise of God was still yet have to come to pass let's look at these together serious now he'll with the shock again bourbon since the natural seed therefore was only a carrier through Ishmael first Isaac second and then on down to the sea you know he brought it now in plain life you take a seed you go down to the soil to plant that seed you put the seed in the ground Saint John chapter 12 will be fulfilled accept and as he fall in the ground and die they cannot bring full life again praise the Lord a separate seed falls in the ground and die it cannot bring for life so brother branham year is using a plant life just like what Jesus said in John chapter 12 to be able to help us to see how the sea travel how it traveled when God speak his word Hayward possessed the earth and it traveled through time until it comes to manifestation Paul spoke about the rapture and when he spoke about the rapture he said we that are alive he didn't say those that would be alive he never spoke for the rapture spoke about the rapture for our day he spoke about the rapture like it was happening in his day but why was it it was just a seed he was a carrier of that promise that same promise was going to go through and seven church ages when when when John Wesley spoke about the rapture he thought it was happening in his day when Luther spoke about a rapture he thought it was happening in his day but there were all carrier of their promise praise the Lord you see that's the reason why Peter said there will be scoffers in the last day that would says well we've been waiting on the promise they've been saying that the law will come you see you can only say that if you are not a carrier but if you are a carrier you will be expecting him in your day in your time you will not be putting the promise of for the future talks about Ishmael Isaac and on down to the seed he says now year the three stages of the sea show us a true picture that I want you to notice with me this morning showing this picture showing these stages that the sea goes through you put a seed to the ground the moment it comes up with a leaf you don't say look at my toe so you said look at my corn the corn is growing you look at a little plane and in the back of your mind you can see the result and that is the same with God when God gives a promise and a had believed God's promise in his mind he can see the end result he don't care what are the goal come and eat some of the leaves in his mind he can see the end result he might you all know this little plane is just try me at all I need to put water dirt oh my corn is just struggling even though it is struggling but in the back of your mind you are seeing an end result that's why you keep calling it calm praise the Lord and that is the same way that God these wave the believer children of the promise when we accept the Lord Jesus honor our confession of faith that's when that little button is placed in there and we become a carrier of it that's when the little button is Quicken in us Jesus said I mean John testified and said he came unto his own his own receiving now but as many that I've receiving he has given him power what is that power the quickening power the word quickens as soon as you you believe their Lord Jesus as your Lord and Savior and confess him that I think quicken in your heart it's not it's not what age church tradition has put us in different ages and I believe all of those things has helped to trap our children you see a young child confessing Jesus you know and and and and believe in the Lord Jesus church church tradition tell us no they are not ready to be baptized here there has to be 12 years Oh or they have to be 16 years oh and all of that and we keep them in that place they allow the enemy that the devil took to spoil your mind then when we when we baptize them we want the church to change them overnight just like how a farmer will be watching to see their little plan coming after out of the earth that is the same where as parents we watch to see their faith their see faith coming out of the child praise the Lord and I would say if they are confessing Jesus at a young age put them under the protection of the word because they can cut the Bible verse they can talk about Jesus but if they are not baptized we are not identify with the body carrier they become a carrier of their seed and that word protects them until the guests to the place of conviction even even Jesus show it in his ministry what do you say the hardest son of man am all the Jeremiah or James and all Isaiah and they talk about he says okay let's forget it argument let's bring it home what is your confession everybody looking at one another and suddenly an inspiration struck feeding he says something that he can't eat that he in his mind he could not put together rightly and sometimes that's that's what happened with the young faith in the life of a child you see a child making a confession that's good what is that it's an inspiration that is quickening that word Indian oh I tell you church tradition had just had just messes up because people mind is so stuck in that that is hard for them to submit to what the Holy Spirit is doing in their day and their time and that's what brother Branham was showing in the seed is not hair with the shock that little plane that comes up is a carrier of the seed the seed is in the life of that plane but it's not a sea for it to be for it to be eating it's not out of place yet where we can put it on the table and eat it's not at a place where we can make bread out of it but if we ever have a fruit from that plane is in their little life it's a carrier praise the Lord and this shows that I mean through our trials and true our failures and everything that's been going on if we estate hauling to Christ we are say confessing him we are said believe in that word is because we are a carrier of their seed praise the Lord verbatim continuing he says now you notice when the sea goes into the ground is the original sea when it comes forth a brings forth and life but what does the light do out of the seed of the wheat it doesn't produce some stock of the wheat right then or some green writing it's a life of the weed but is in a carrier stage when the sea comes up is the very same life it's very same green that you put but it just coming up in a caring stage I know just like I said before you know when you plant the seed the earth holds the sea but when the sea comes to life it holds the earth when you plant the seed you cover it with the earth the earth holds it and that's the same when God put his seed in this earth the earth hose it but when the word and the blessings of God starts to shine upon the seed and a revelation starts to come out and a consciousness of God starts to spring out what is that little plant is doing is trying to possess the earth stretching out and trying to bring their F to subjection it's stretching roots because it's called too possessive if he stays in there F and don't come out it's dead but when it comes out there are little tiny plants you are looking at is having some Dominion yet it has been able to overcome to come from out of the dirt and the mud a little tiny plan you are looking at it's having dominion it's going back to an Eden position children of the promise children of the promise where BAM said he says if it was a natural seed that God was speaking out after Sarah died Abraham Mary caterer and he had seven more children so it was not a natural seed but he was a carrier of their promise on the times in shadow children of the promise this promise is on to you and to your children and to many as the Lord our God shall call praise the Lord trying to look a few things here what a wonderful Lord Jesus we self amen this is our day this is the time work God is looking for for his word to come from from out of us that word coming out of the pages getting on two feet praise the Lord and just like we said yeah it's not at a place where we're trying to work ourself true to to manufacture something know is at a place word we want to submit to the word we want to be just like Mary be it unto me according to your word that all she has to do she J had to believe that if your word have said this for this age if it is the promise they later fulfill in me praise the Lord and even she herself didn't even know you know how it was going to bring a lot of rejection to her amen and she was going true she was going to go through a lot of things where Burnham said yeah in a message life let's take this I I was reading this and I just thought that I mean this one who might help some of our young people he said for instance for a psychology part it said notice just a moment the psychic view he says here is a picture of Christ and here is an electric fan it depends on which one I look at see if if mine emotion is moving this way all my emotion is moving that way if a look are there and longed for death and desire for death my emotion is said to was the fan but if I look this way at the picture of Christ he says my emotion and my desire is is said that way that's the reason Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart C is where your emotion is set where your thought is praised Lord where your thought is if you're taught is thinking on the promise promises of God then your emotion is set that way now and and and and and what what happened is that that would create an expectation an expectation is a bearing ground for the promises of God you can only get from God as you expect so that is the picture that he is painting out here if if your tops is towards the promises of God you might not see it manifesting in your body but you are thinking about it your thought is to wash them and because your tourists or was there is creating an expectation look if we will live a daily life of expectation we will have daily miracles in our life expecting to show up in our homes expecting God to show up you know what you will you will see miracles just living because if that is the way your mind is channel you will see him expectation is the bearing ground for his promises it's where your tot is and then we can rejoice on because that we are the children of the promise he says we can rejoice in the fact of just thinking on his promises of just meditating on his promises of just taking a promise of his word on our mind he's the Lord God their supplier order all of our knees Lord is your is your promise and you said in your word if a man cannot provide for his house he's more more than a knee feeder Lord I'm your house I know you are not any feeder so I know you will provide taking God by his promise because we are the children of the promise on their great antenna Church of God who has Christ's own promise it can fail that's right the word thinks that we are crazy oh this is life to see a young lady who went to an psychiatry she's 35 years old never smoked never drink in her life a very fine girl for people like Christine her father father's a doctor and she gave her life to Christ at an early stage and and what did she do she goes out and she finally get to a place to to a college where she was teaching and and and as a psychiatry there he sat down and talked to her and he said you mean that you you have never never been kissed by the boy she said now one time him in all of my life you mean you have never had a little drink and and being in a party never said girl you don't know what you are missing now so this the brother branham is saying what what is happening here he's trying to redirect her mind from on what she has been taught because when her mind is redirected is going to create a desire for what he's talking about so he's talking about keeping your mind on the promise keeping your mind on Christ are we together like I said this is for our young people so young people listen to me now he says now him being is psychiatry he he swung the girl mind until now she has become so evil and so bad till she don't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoke to her in her presence and even her father and her mother can't even see her no more and she and she lost her mind and this next week we will go to the Institute I mean he's he's talking about a real case here but he's trying to show us how how Gail came to where she is because with the testimony there's now she's in an insane institution that is the effect even of the internet on the minds of the young people that's the voices that are coming through those trains it's because there she turned her touch from Christ until what that cycle was and moving her mind and and that's what we are here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world on to the things of God which is in tenor so what are we moving your mind talk don't look at the feelings of your flesh don't look at that I mean the whiteness of your flesh don't look at the feelings of the emotion that go through you or your body hold to the promise of God hold to the seed because the seed is predestinated for your soul it's not a seed for your body your body will struggle your spirit your mind will all struggle but that promise of God's Word in your heart we constantly give you desire for God that's what we're trying to redirect your mind to this morning as he said moving your mind you're thinking from the things of the word on to the things of God which is in Tanner he said in death he said and that's what preaching is for is to provoke the thinking talk to a higher a better into a place where Christ is until you become converted so we we are redirecting you by the spirit not trying to or something down your throat well if we can just get ourselves to thinking on the promise of the Holy Ghost if they receive the Holy Ghost and on the dance of Pentecost if they received the Holy Ghost in Colinas house if this Holy Ghost is real then I can receive it too and that expectation will surely bear the promise in your life he says he says then your mind reaches for those things which are which are above but it is now but in this other place the girl they are thinking she might she might take person at any time show ly become so miserable that type of life until they killed himself why because she had got to that place and it's a dark place you know when I was talking about the acnes that can be felt there was something there happy and I mean it was it was almost something open to me and I got quiet a little bit but I needed to to process that so I never spoke about it but we have time we will talk about it and what kind of for open to mean was we talk about Egypt and a darkness that can be fed and we talk about you know religious darkness but what was actually on my mind that kind of for opened to me that morning was I mean the darkness that many are going true that darkness in their spirit rain I went together so you see that's what that's what the Holy Ghost is doing all this why you know all this why if you are not a carrier of the seed we have to know that it's what is keeping us if you are not a carrier of the seed you have no desire for God Berta Branham says the deep call it too deep if you are having a desire for God there is a God somewhere to fill that desire that's what the promise was he the hunger and test after righteousness they shall be filled all you have to do is just test we just have to go back and see what you're testing after what are you desiring after what are you testing what are you longing in you how what are you expecting children of the promise verbum says you talk about you know a silent God how can God be how there can be a God and the whole world is just going and he can do nothing about it he said they said the same thing about the Jews he said but I didn't know that I see had to fall in the ground and die before it can bring forth a new life and sometimes that's the reason why God allowed us to go through trials praise the Lord we spoke a little bit about that yesterday somebody acts about prior you know taking from the lost pride and says the scripture says lead us not into temptation Jesus said we should pray and say lead us not into temptation amen but it's also said deliver us from evil so the temptation is not a problem why because we are here to be tempted you gotta take you got to put that on your mind you got to write that in your vehicle as you get in your vehicle and close the door a bad pass my - you're funny to be tempted so as you drive down the road you know that you going right into temptation and what I did therefore to be to be able to bring the God that is in you to be able to bring that attribute of God for you to trust him for you to trust him if you fail for you to repent if you feel weaker for you to get back and get more strength so we will not be kept from temptation because that's why we are here the Holy Ghost does not come and just close the door to you I'm telling you like yourself in the room like you like the window for you to not see nobody in that dark room you will still be tempted oh my goodness he's going to blast your mind you better get out quickly and start looking at the sunshine because I mean he will blast your mind I'll tell you that Lake knocking your head against the wall because that is the very good ground for Satan to carry the present crazy is isolation are we together okay let's find a place to close here brother branham said in the message conference he says when we get to a place till we think we are the owner one that God can use we better call a conference praise the Lord we better call the conference we need help that's what it means we need help if we ever get to the place where we think we are better than someone else then we need help because you have to always always tell yourself you are a carrier of that sea you are coming to the place every day to get to that place were the Greenwood comma and brother Branham says we will be bread on the master's table he want to bring us to that place where he can sit there my spirit flow freely and if we become bread on the master's table I mean people would just eat us up so if people can eat you up and you can save nothing then you are bread on the master's table you know what you know that the gingerbread story amen if they want to eat you of you start running then you have to know there is a little bit of human nature day are we together when we get to a place till we think we are the only one that God can use we better call a conference God sent Jesus his son to die for every member of the body of Christ for Methodists for Baptists for Presbyterians for Lutheran's for for for Catholics whatever they maybe they are all the children of the promise why he said that because all of those those system one time they were a carrier of the sea in the abyss position they were a carrier of the sea amen until they got stuck to their tradition and left the word he says how they going to hear the message if we cool off what are what are we going to do then we are putting a bar example before then no time for cooling off it's time for a warming up praise the Lord amen let's tear up our conscious let's remember the good things that God has done in our life amen let's remember places where he has given us grace for us to be able to testify to a sinner let's warm up there's no time to cool off praise the Lord and we can have a warming up till we have a conference and all-time revival that would bring us back to all revival fires that will attract attention when sinners are born into the kingdom of God when men begin to see you elfin woman and elfin man and sinner repenting I believe that's what this Holy Ghost is giving for a desire in your life as a son of God to see and not a sinner say oh i'm desiring in my heart that when we get back to the church even a bee we have to wash up your bird bærum says new building always make people statue it has the tendency of making us to feel like we are better than other people it's a spirit that goes with a new house praise the Lord so you gotta wash that spirit we don't want it around you amen we want a new place to be a place where we can have the desire to go out and be witnesses try to get one soul on your account praise the Lord that should be our desire Lord let this thing flow through me that it will affect the life of somebody that will make someone tested for Jesus Christ then it will make me a witness there's no time to cool off we have to warm ourself up if God use you before he can use you again were scared when sinners are born into the killing of God when men began to seal Elfen women and healthy men and sinners repenting and changing the alive gory fault making restitution weeping braking pressure shields the church need a good case of all time garland law of brotherly love we need a conference hold a conference aiming let us pray every promise in the ball is mine every chapter every verse every lie I am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is my Oh every promise in the book is mine [Music] every chapter every verse every lie I'm trusting his love Eva Oh every promise in the ball is Oh every prom is every promise in the ball is mine every chapter every verse every lie yeah I am trusting in his lovely [Music] every promise in the ball is mine with our heads bad this afternoon can you think about a promise can you think about the promise oh it's hard for me to know what you're thinking about it's hard for me to know what promise is on your mind can you think about a promise can you get a hold of a promise in your mind this morning just one promise get a hold of a promise he says thinking on that promise will create an expectation [Music] they say a promise for healing you see a promise for revival is here promise for the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say a promise now all of God's promises I hear an amen all of his promise is tied to one they are all captured together so no matter what you desire in this morning while no matter what promise you have on your mind we are all at the same place this morning we're balances don't be afraid to ask God for big things he's there inexhaustible fountain no matter how many times we come back keep your promise on your mind this morning all he said I try when I ask for bread will be giving a stone now a fish you will not be giving a second he said how much more when we ask God for his spirit children of the promise children of the promise now see the scripture even though there are many promises but I tie it all in one promise and that promise goes back to the promised seed because when that seed that I won't see that is poor food in the ground when it comes up it brings for many more seeds children of the resurrection children of the light a children of the promise we have a promise we have a promise we've been called to
