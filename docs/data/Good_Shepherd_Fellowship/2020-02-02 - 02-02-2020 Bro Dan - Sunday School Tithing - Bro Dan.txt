========================================

we can always count on your grace your grace found us your grace brought us out your grace has brought us this far your grace has never let us down and your grace would lead us home for by grace are we saved not of works lest any man should boast wait thank you dear Lord Jesus that we can count ourselves in because of what grace has done for us not because of our good works good works we have none good works we have nothing to show for it but we can talk of what grace has done for us well thank you for being a part of your kingdom that we are churin of the Most High God carved in the image of God and we are here to demonstrate the power and authority of God in our lives we don't care what happens the purpose of God for our lives would never be defeated many other storms that are raging against us from different angles in different magnitudes give us grace not to look at the size of the stones or the strength of the storms that we shall always lift our heads or beyond the stones to behold your face knowing that the storms know your voice and your voice they will obey we thank you Jesus for being our God we are so grateful that our lives are hidden in you in the father and we fear no full Presbyterian Holy Name this morning we worship the father we bless you we glorify the old God for everything you've done for us our Lord and our master Jesus we thank you for as many as have guided already we are trusting you father for those only away bring them in let not the enemy take advantage of them in any way and we prayed yellow Jesus come and be enthroned in our life this morning father once again we are going to look at Titan may you come and minister to us through this topic Lord speak to us in one way or the other we're just thinking we bless you that we can always count on you in Jesus name Amen praise God all right so just for everything let's take Malachi 3:10 again bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith say of the Lord of Hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it praise be to God remember the prophet of God says does say the Lord feels not praise be to God if there is anything we can put our lives on as that saith the Lord because there is no way it would ever feel God would always bring his way to pass I don't care what happens the Word of God would never be defeated so last week we had a very interesting conversation here I loved every part of it and we are going to continue right from where we stopped last week but before then let me just take a step back when Jesus was tempted by the Pharisees about paying tribute which is tax money to Caesar they asked him whether it was lawful to pay tribute to Caesar and he asked them back why do you tempt me and he asked who has the tribute money and then one brought out a coin then he asked whose portrait or whose picture is on the tribute money and they said Caesar and he said give unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar and unto God that which belongs to God so paying tribute money or pay entire taxes are lawful he didn't say it wasn't lawful they are a lawful duty that we have to do very good maybe considering how much they take is another topic we can talk about we can argue babies too much praise be to God so now the point we got to well you know we had brother-sister share you know I it was so wonderful I just loved it so and before we left I said that those who pay their tithes which is one tenth of their earnings from the our gross was right and again I said that those who pay 1/10 object eyes from their net were also right I know that would generate a stone under every circumstance praise the Lord yes so let's see I am NOT an authority on anything as a matter of fact I don't teach something because I know it I just have the bedding and then I just go out and I get to study I mean read a lot of things here and a so it's ok to disagree praise be to God I've always trusted in God and I believe he's always been very faithful so now before you take your salary or your earnings Uncle Sam would have taken his part already and then the part that comes to you is the net so let's assume that you are making $10,000 a month out of that $10,000 let's again assume that you are required or you were required to pay 90% no wait a minute you are required to pay hundred percent of your earnings to God are tights let's zoom it away that is not the case but let's just assume that God was requiring us to pay hundred percent of our Amos to him as tight so if I am making ten thousand dollars as gross what it means is that I have to pay homage to God ten thousand but look at this scenario that before the ten thousand gets to me Uncle Sam would have taken their taxes out and probably am i end of it maybe seven thousand now God was requiring me to pay a hundred percent and my gross is ten thousand dollars and I'm trusting to take this ten thousand dollars to God but the state federal government have taken their taxes out and I'm left with seven thousand dollars do you think that there was any way we could ever meet that obligation was there any way we could ever meet that obligation because part of your salary has been taken away and you can't you are left with seven thousand the seven thousand is now 70 percent of your income 30 percent has been taken away so you'll be carrying what 70% to God I am not saying this to say that those who are paying 10% of your gross wrong not at all it is right it is the right thing to do if you are doing it keep doing it hold fast to it I am bringing a different dynamic to this so and I say again that those who pay 10% or beyond that are also right but I said last week that there is a caveat there is there is there is a condition so which brings us down to our net now because you can never get a hold of 100 percent of what you make they would have taken your 401k contribution they would have taken your Social Security contribution they would have taken our federal their taxes road rail whatever they take all that out and you are left with Savini so you calculate 10% based on the $7000 as your hundred percent income so you realize that the person who is paying 10 percent of your gross is paying more than you now at the end of the year if you opinion based on your net when you file your income tax and you get your income tax returns you are supposed to tie on the returns because that part of your income was not tied by the one who paid the undergrowth and not obligated to do so now you can also draw from your foreign key remember also that normally don't take your 401k deductions before they even tax so remember that that contribution did not attract tights so when you are making we draw us from your 401k you all got packs or amp you you all got paste on that money if you got to go on pension you are enjoying your 401k you are enjoying your Social Security remember that you never pay tight on that money you all got tight on that money this is why I said there is a condition or there is a caveat praise be to God so but it becomes wrong when you are tying on your net and then you fell for your income tax and then you pocket all the money you draw from your 401k you pocket all the money you are driving from your pension fund your social security fund you pocket all the money remember that you never paid tithes on that part of your earnings that was taken away so you all got that money if you do that you have stolen from God now having said that having said that let me just read this that no man can out give God when it comes to taiidan there is nothing like a half it too much money you can't give God too much praise be to God you can say oh I've given God more than necessary so what I want to say is that it is perfectly okay to pay your tithe from your gross and so paid money to God still peptides from your Social Security from your 401k from your hard luck quality tax refunds is perfectly okay are you obligated I don't think so but nothing stops you from doing it cheering oh God run of God are led by the Spirit of God I don't want us to come to a situation to say that oh is grieving in stone that when you do this no nothing stops you praise be to God now in the message I mean in questions and answers 1964 brother brother said I could stand here till the morning telling you just what happened when I seen that and what condition I was in I just but just as lawyer as I ever could I paid tithes and when I took my own money from the church here or from from campaigns I took more and give a tenth then I'd give it out to ministers and give the rest of it ministries then when I couldn't do that then that then I did I kept 10% and give God 90% praise be to God instead of him keeping the 90 and giving God 10 pirata captain he gave God Nene that's why I'm saying that when it comes to our work with God you can't say I have given too much to God so what I'm saying here this morning that it is okay to pay your tithe from your gross and still continue to pay tithe on money you have already tied on nothing stops you because praise be to God you can't out give God praise be to God now before I go to the next phase are there any questions yes okay okay all right okay all right that's right that's right the continued part beautiful beautiful so that's a very good very good point thing so remember you can never pay more than necessary if the prophet of God could pay 90% and just keep ten just think about it praise be to God thanks for the contribution yes okay that is nice now we can I will take you from both angles because whatever money you make it is not out of your own sweat is God giving you that money some of us go to school we get very good jobs we are making very good and it's very good income and we think is our education we think is our smartness we think is because we are doing Auto overtime so it's our strength now what I want to say when you look at it there are people that have more education than you and yet they are not blessed with a sort of income you are blessed with dollar side there are people who even make more money than you yes there are money is of no use to them but yours is there are people that are 10 times stronger than you that do a lot of overtime then you would ever imagine yet they are not blessed with the money you have so think about it any money you make don't think is your strength don't think issue education no is the blessings of God for you so is God giving you that money praise be to God so based on that our said God is giving you 90 percent but at the end of it all he doesn't just give it a 90 percent just guess what happens all the hundred percent comes to you and you are supposed to take ten percent of it and send it back to God and I wonder why sometimes it gets so so difficult it's just like me going to the supermarket buying a box of candy for my little boy and then I give it to him and I asked him just for maybe one or two and he says no you can't have it that is what we sometimes do yes so um this is the way I would answer it I don't know if that answers your question praise be to God yes amen amen yes that is something we'll be going into but since you brought it up let me just talk a little about it anytime you are supposed to give your tights out don't say next time because that tight you will never pay it you were not so is something I'll be going into so I wouldn't go into it very much at this point I remember sure let me just go ahead one time I was supposed to pay tithe and actually I took the money out and I kept it and I was double minded I don't want to go into the background of the story and I parked my truck came down I passed a car in front of me I was looking at at a car I entered my truck I started it and I just reversed into the car and right away I knew there isn't so the Sun didn't go down on that day I went I swallowed my pride and i went and give that tide out so there are a lot of things some of these things will be going into but your contribution I think brought this out yes that's a very good question that's a very good question very tricky hmm okay that's good thank you yes so when you get a gift should you tight I would say yes because library Joran just asked the money their anus we make is a gift from God it is and we tried out of it now there are some gifts you can tie it on let's say I am hungry and then you bring me a bowl of food and Pam soup I [Music] can't hide on that but if you give me hundred dollars sometimes we overlook a lot of things somebody gives you maybe $20 and look at it Oh title of two dollars I mean just forget it it's important it's very very important it may be very very small yes it is very insignificant right how do I give two dollars to God but do it it is not what you think or how you feel so if you give me hundred dollars it's a good thing to take one-tenth of it and give to God somebody can also give you a gift that is not in cash but in kind maybe you give me a car I don't have to pay ties on that car in my opinion I don't have to but then if I decide to sell that car that money I take from the sale of it has not become a gift or an any or everybody to me I all got tied from it and I have to pay so there is a very thin line but as I said a while ago children of God are led by the Spirit of God so if his cash take that out if it's a gift and kind depend on what it is if it's maybe ten bucks of corn you give me even though it's not in cash I'm taking one bag out and sending it we're supposed to be it is a bag I can divide that into ten it is a car how do I divide it maybe somebody will say okay let me wait and find a Blue Book value of the car and then pay a tenth of it to God I don't know I'm not very sure how that goes but then if I decide to sell that car then it's a different scenario altogether that becomes a revenue to me it has become an income to me I have to calculate one half of it and give it to God wonderful questions you okay okay yes I would not die on the loan because alone is not an income it is not a gift is something I am going to pay back probably with interest so I wouldn't type on loan now if I'm Gary scholarship serve the scholarships I don't think they even put money in your hand they just have to finance your education good that's right now if my parents are sending me money to go to school is that money meant to pay my fees to buy books are as money that is just meant after all these expenses have been taken care of is their money they are giving me just for my pocket that is something we have to also know yes so again there's a very very thin line but specifically dealing with loans is something you pay back so I wouldn't tie on loan very good now if it is a grant you don't pay back grunts right now again it depends on what you are using a grant for if actually you have to use it for your fees or you are buying books with it that is a different scenario but if you have your fees have been taken care of and the grant is coming to you as pocket money again I would think differently about it yes yeah I didn't see these questions coming yes as Vera to pay goes money first and be in that hole then then than to use the the money of God to get out of that hole because you're a teen you've gotten out of that hole they are going to sink deeper so my advice is that pay you're tight and order mortgage if you have to pay late fee go ahead and do it but make sure never use is against something we are going to talk about here never use the tight to cushion you up for your bills it's not a good way to go praise be to God our time is up wonderful time I'm beginning to enjoy this on disco god bless you saints wonderful shall we just say a word of Prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus we are so very much
