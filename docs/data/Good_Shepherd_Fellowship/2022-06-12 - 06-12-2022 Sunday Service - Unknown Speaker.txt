privilege to be here and we have few prayer requests this morning the lord bless you you may have your seat while we take this and now before we change the order of the service here praise the lord we also want to thank the lord for bringing all the students out of school all the different ones that have to graduate and the academic students i mean when you when you think about all the things that are happening with all the gun shooting and different things that are happening you know you you never feel the gravity of it when you're looking at it on the social media or on the news until you have to be involved and we pray that the law will keep us safe but there is one thing that is that is becoming common which of course our term to think is is a last day spirit that is that is uh that is getting hold of uh of us we term to be going into what paul said in uh ii timothy chapter 3 verse 2 where people men will be very unthankful you know uh if we don't learn to thank god for the little things in our lives we will never thank him for the great things praise the lord you always be thinking and and looking for something great to happen you know some kind of a testimony to have but he's the lord that promised to watch over our going out and i was coming in i was rising up and i was sitting down and and it's is is because you know sometimes we do these things all the time you know we don't have to to hold walls and you know whole crutches to get up we just get up so we just think that is uh you know it's part of the food that we eat or the strength that we have you know but i mean to see we have had just this year grocery shopping in buffalo shooting and a couple of schools and and i mean just just horrible all the road rage and and and things that are happening you know wow let's let's teach our heart to be thankful you know let's teach our heart to be thankful and uh learning to be thankful i mean we will come through an entire school year and even parents you know will not bring uh note of praise and praise report to thank the lord uh and and if we don't do that we we are not teaching our children to do that you know the last time i said it you know uh people turn to think that you know i should bring your prayer requests or your note of praise as a surprise no praise the lord if you expect me to do it it's not you giving thanks you think that because i know about it i should come and thank god for you you should be the one giving thanks you should be the one thanking god you have had another birthday thanking god you had the end of a school year thanking god you had a graduation thanking god you are sick and you go well you should be the one doing it [Music] praise the lord when the person is now thankful they also show a level of your prayer life a short level of your prayer life it's in a sense that your prayer life is all about asking god for things you are so compared with you know either you are asking you are seeking god and and and condemned about something or you want god to do something desperately for you but our first approach to god is worship it's thanksgiving [Music] there should be nothing that should be uh so small to thank god for so this morning we want to be thankful we want to we want to thank the lord for giving us another privilege to be in the house of the lord we have a few prayer needs here we want to remember that [Music] mia is asking i think it's a prayer request my health so she want us to remember her in prayer and uh brother stephen bird asked that we pray for him he had to travel out of state so we just want to pray that god will grant him joining mercy praise the lord and gabriel warren asked a prayer request here for his mom that is experiencing kidney stone and in the very bad

can also pick up you know these things comes up and then we uh he would normally print a bunch of copies they sit right there and then people come through the doors go out and ask at what time which day they say i mean it sounds funny but it's hurtful because you don't know the hours that go behind this and the expenses that go behind it minnesota is not a place that a preacher can drive through when we bring preachers in we got to fly them in praise the lord we don't have preachers driving true like other states have the privilege of that and then we were playing for meetings and people oh i

that with a little prayer meeting from beginning so if you love to come we'll be glad to have you as well and then the the following weekend our friend brad diller will be in to preach for us on sunday so i wish of course we will have service that wednesday before that weekend but we will let you know praise the lord amen i think so far that's all we have for announcement and before we change the order of the service i would i would like to give privilege to brother ariel's dad uh to come in and just [Music] you know express some few things on his heart to us this morning and this is not his first time being with us he had come come a couple of times now with his wife and we are blessed to have been with us for a couple of weeks praise the lord and it's always good visiting and fellowshipping with him so they might be traveling sometime in the week so i just thought that it would be good to to have him come say the word a tool come on brother emmanuel god bless you you have to be interpreter to your dad god bless you all you have a wonderful small church because of the spirit that is here at this church experiment i have experimented before and i have the chance to experiment again [Music] [Music] to particularly thank you all mercier particularly to thank the pastor particularly [Music] and also to contribute in the success of my trip [Music] i came for the wedding of my son and just before the wedding could happen and there have been people that have been praying uh for for a long time uh and there's some people that have been dealing with different difficulties months right before the wedding and the day of the wedding say [Music] it is the conclusion of all the effort that been done before even the day of the wedding and we tend to forget those people that were praying [Music] and it is the occasion for me to thank you all [Music] even for those who have taken time to cook the food and to prepare all the things [Music] and people that have been just encouraging you through a small word basket why is he fighting the christian equation waiting [Music] it is through a christian wedding is to a christian couple and that that actually bring forth christian of tomorrow [Music] and it is those chris christian of the of tomorrow that would defend christ and if we don't pay attention to death and the strength of the power of the demon will stand and will cover the christians the true christians responsibilities that's why young people have a responsibility critic it is them that a christian of tomorrow si fasil and if they easily discourage get discouraged [Music] and what will be the church the christian church of tomorrow [Music] [Music] and for the success of the wedding of my son [Music] and the couple knows exactly that it wasn't easy [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the devil has a tactic to show you that nothing everything is impossible it comes with the power of impossibility or it's something that is not able to happen if you look at that image of impossibility and you can't even fall [Music] and the thing that is keeping you standing straight standing for it is faith [Music] i thank you all for all of that yeah [Music] a and the responsibility of the or the role of the pastor in the situation that is happening today [Music] and brother speaks it speaks of the difficulties that will happen in the end and it also talks about it in second timothy chapter four responsibility and of the responsibility of young people they will face those difficult times those challenging times hello timothy and timothy was just a young man he he don't set responsibility why are they giving responsibility to this young timothy [Music] and also it confirms it with giving brandon a image of the end time and when you come out of that vision read second timothy chapter four and you you would understand that this difficult and challenging time and there is some gift that it gives to the church to fight this this difficult time and the pastor will say that the pastor is a the word says the pastor is the gift that he gives unto the church [Music] and above all the gifts that the gift of wisdom is the gift that above all gifts and the gift of wisdom [Music] you have to discern to the holy spirit what is the need of the church is the need of this church puerto rico it can be totally different than the needs of another church in the civil person it doesn't just mean to comes here don't need this you know to give courts and to to blame others no no no idea there's more than that it's the wisdom that will lead and we lead the whole thing why am i saying this was and i just wanted to encourage you to support your pastor once again [Applause] [Music] shepherd [Music] i believe that you have a good pastor [Applause] [Music] i'm not going to go back with my wife my school knows i won't do a program different but because we have different programs i will go first and my wife will follow later merci

continue please support [Music] may god bless you praise the lord praise the lord amen well god bless you uh uh devil penis papa wanna appreciate i think i could do a better translation than ariel was doing but uh praise the lord i thought to do it but i felt like i will i will be nervous because i just want to keep my mind my channel of touch so that's what i asked him to do but next time i might dream praise the lord let's just stand on our feet our brother wanted to be able to express himself to the church so he acts in there and we granted him that privilege amen praise the lord amen [Music] with my hands lifted up my mouth full of praise i will bless you lord [Music] i will bless thee oh lord wave a heart of faith [Music] i will bless thee oh lord i will bless thee oh lord yes

you for speaking and lord father the congregation for hearing this morning come lord and break the bread of life to us of god father you are the internal bread of life that i was so long for this morning speak to us this morning in a way that only you can in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen the lord bless you thank you musicians praise the lord uh let's take our bibles let's go to the book of revelation revelation chapter 21 revelation chapter 21. now i was i'm i was going to i'm going to uh uh where i said dedicate this uh message that i want to speak this morning to the young people if you remember i told you i was going to bring something for you in the morn of june and i was trying to find the best time to do it and i realized that with our few meetings coming up we will be busy and [Music] with our visiting preachers and we might not have the time so i would just i would just want to use this time to start and then stir the water get you thinking and then the next time we meet we will go uh uh into details praise the lord but uh i will i will i will trust the law to to be able to uh uh having to help us go in in a certain direction and then i'll we will see if we'll find our forte now uh i was here studying yesterday and uh a good friend of mine came around and and then we're talking from one thing to another he said so brother one i'm here for us to pray and uh he didn't know how much that did well to me because uh you know you keep your heart before the lord you are steady you have some something on your mind but yet you're waiting for the lord to kind of confirm it and then while we were praying and i just heard the brother prophesying exactly what was on my heart so that was just a confirmation amen i just trusted the lord revelation chapter 21 let's read about uh the new heaven and the new earth let's read about the new heaven and the new earth praise the lord amen there is no parting in the scripture for the today's dating game there is no biblical pattern in the bible for what the word called the dating game and there is a there is a biblical instruction how to go about finding the wife how to go about trusting girl for the husband and i want to use this to be able to go in that direction so let's read revelation chapter 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth will pass away and there was no more seed and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride a dog for her husband praise the lord john is seeing the new jerusalem the new holy city coming down out of heaven as a bride prepared for her husband praise the lord and verse 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself amen god himself praise the lord not a trinity in god but god himself the person of god himself shall be with them and be their god praise the lord hallelujah are we together the lord bless you you may have your seat just keep your bible open and then if you drop pot down a little bit we can we can go ahead and read but we want to stay in in the context of what we want to study this morning if you drop down to verse 9. if you drop down to verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels we have which had the seven vowel four of the seven large last plague and talk with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife amen first when john saw this vision he testified that he saw a new heaven and a new earth the first heaven the first earth will pass away and then he saw a holy city he saw a city and when he saw the city it was as a bride a door for her husband are we together then here he's also saying that this angel said come and i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit okay i know that i did something that i should not have done i don't think you have my notes back there i'm not sure of that if you had it it would be supernaturally given to you praise the lord okay i just sent it back and so he said and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and a high mountain to show me the great city praise the lord the holy jerusalem discerning out of heaven from god praise the lord amen now we see here that john saw a city and the city was as a bride and then now in verse 9 he's told that come and see the bride and then he's shown a city praise the lord i want for us to grab that because if you do not sink in you won't get the picture hallelujah i saw a holy city new jerusalem coming from god out of heaven as a bride prepared for her husband i saw the city coming out as a bride prepared for her husband and a great voice said unto me behold the tabernacle of god is with men praise the lord and in verse 9 the angel says come i will show you the bride the lamb's wife and then he carried me away in a sp in in the spirit to a great in a high mountain and show me the great city i will show you the bride the lamb's wife he carried me and then he showed me a great city on a hill on a high mountain he showed me a great city the new jerusalem discerning out of heaven from god having the glory of god praise the lord why because the great city is having the glory of god because the great city is the bride and the bride is the glory of her husband that's why paul taught in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 7 that the woman is the glory of the man are we together amen now uh uh for us to understand this for us to understand this uh we will look [Music] in the message choosing of a bride brother branham said this he said now we yes see plainly the spiritual plane of god planning for his future home with his future bride comes into view now praise the lord amen now so what is happening here is that we know that the the the new jerusalem that revelation chapter 21 is is is talking about the future home you go and read the message future home that's exactly the scripture brother branham is reading but yeah in in in presenting the future home he's also talking about his future bride are we together so in in one sense god thinking about a future home had his bride in mind praise the lord thinking about his future home he had his bride in mind and i would say this uh as i begin this uh uh you know you we we we listening to brother branham message and we thank god that he had given us the the grace you know to be able to to uh uh believe and accept brother branham ministry as the fulfillment of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 you know when and in luke 17 10 it and and all of those scriptures that we we saw being fulfilled in the administrator brother branham and uh uh i know i mean there there are many that are that are that are not yet dead they have not sinked into them but you see what uh what uh uh i i feel and believe that uh uh many of us are slowly coming into turn because uh even with god when you are first saved you don't understand everything you know slowly the law brings you into debt because a lot of brother branham messages that he preached and almost all his messages he preached was a prophecy praise the lord when he preached invisible union he read the scripture did in romans chapter 7 he says this is a prophecy of the church and you know so it's a prophecy but you see just like god for god to be able to help us to understand his plan of redemption he had to play it out throughout all the ages amen he had to use the prophets and joseph and all of these men to play it out for us to really understand so brother branham in bringing these messages he will take the example of a natural man and his wife praise the lord but you see that the problem there is that we did not understand the prophecy we started taking the the the the the natural illustration of the prophet to start you know to start making it an issue where uh uh uh we start making it like a law in order in a sense like we uh uh brother branham year is going to talk about see him talking here in in choosing of a bride he says now we see plainly a spiritual plan of god planning his future home for with his future bride comes into view and and pretty soon he's going to drum from that thought and verb i'm going to say when a man chooses to say why it shows what is in him praise the lord amen and it's so easy now for you to take your mind from on christ they have choose you amen for you now to start putting your mind on you start looking over all that man his wife and and this man and his wife and then you stop bringing yourself you have to know that the devil also is an evangelist and if you don't fix your mind right he's going to pick up that call and he's going to nail you down and say see your marriage and see your life and and see you it shows that you were this and see that other couple back there and if he can just get your mind off of christ [Music] praise the lord you know and and and and i mean and we all did it you know we we we preaching and we never even considered that quote that it was uh you know it was a spiritual plan we just went straight there and start hammering all these uh you know that you see that the kind of a wife you married it tells the character that it's in you yes you don't have the holy ghost in there praise the lord amen it's also not ruling the father it is an instruction praise the lord because our ethnic marriages is a reflection that's that's the purpose of marriage is to reflect the union of christ and his bride and until we have got there are we together amen now so brother branham says this i'm trying to go this way so when i get down to to to talk to to uh my friends will be able to understand ourselves better amen now he sees this up this uh we see the a spiritual plan of god planning his future home with his future bride comes into view praise the lord he goes ahead and he says she the bride that a man who choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what in him praise the lord amen and uh we can we can look at ourselves through this word but we also have to look at the the the the plane of redemption amen the plan of redemption so if you bring it home to yourself and you say the kind of a woman that man in heaven have choose reflect his character and we know that his character has been played out true has been playing how true out of the scripture because god is identified by his characteristics are we together amen now so in one sense it's easily to bring us to the place word when we see the kind of for life that we are reflecting or the kind of for life that we are producing then we ask ourselves what are we reflecting because the moon do not have a light of itself is just a reflection of the sun [Music] praise the lord you see that's the reason why when paul when when he taught in the book of efficient when he started to teach marriage he kept in mind you know uh you know the the the head of the man is christ uh the man is the head of the woman you know he kept those things intact he was trying to make the church to understand you know that this thing is all about reflection praise the lord so brother brahms says she the bride that the man who choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him she's going to help him make his future home she's going to help him do you see help mate she's going to help him make his future home that's the reason why the image of god is never complete it has to be male and female 1 praise the lord it has to be male and female she is going to help him to make his future home praise the lord verbum goes ahead again he says here he's looking for her character the character of christ now just a moment now that's it he choose a bride to reflect his character to which the modern church of today certainly miss his program here a million miles praise the lord now we we we will go we will get back to this i will get back to this i'm a little bit ahead ahead of myself because uh i'm nervous but uh we will get to this now let me go back again to the to the reading john saw a holy city coming down out of heaven and as a bride and then he was told come and see the bride and then he's seen the city now jesus said in matthew chapter 5 verse 14 you are like a candle that cannot be had amen is that what he said he says you are excited on the hill he says you are a city on a hill praise the lord and now sees the bride here also she's taking a representation of the new jerusalem come and see the bride the lamb's wife he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and show me a great city come and see the bride and he's showing me a great city why because you are excited on a hill and the thing about a city is that uh as cited is a place of exposure a city is a place of exposure essere is a place of great influence praise the lord amen a city is a place of great influence i'm from new york wow look at the yankees you know it's a place uh when you call the name of a city there's a certain image that goes into people's mind amen praise the lord you come from a little town you come to the setting you realize that things are done differently and sometimes people don't grow to catch up that life they try to force themselves into that life and then they get everything out of place praise the lord if you are sitting on a hill and and then when it comes to this place of the lamb's wife the the bride is is out of place word one thing there that is that i've always believed marriage is never a secret thing if you are not ready to approach it publicly don't go into it if you if you are not ready if you want to be hiding behind cars hiding behind houses don't even attempt it you will mess your life up and you will destroy the life of somebody else it's a city on the hill that's the reason why the dating game can never work because pretty soon you are not exposed to be running around with plenty of people and then you can no longer be trusted because what happened it did not work here what happened it did not work and what happened it did not work here everybody see what you are doing it's a city on the hill i never meant for it to be quiet but if it's quiet it's okay now you will see the comparison that in revelation chapter 17 you see also a great hold that is also on seven hills that's right praise the lord that's the reason why her life of hold on cannot be cannot be held because yara says she's not in contact with all of the kings of the earth and she's on a hell so drinking the blood of the sins all of those things are exposed right from the beginning god's approach to marriage has always been a public thing praise the lord it's not a one-man adventure thing it has always been a public thing set it on a hill keep that in the back of your mind it's a place of exposure praise the lord are we together now let's take a scripture here over in the book of hosea praise the lord now young people what i want you to do i want you to write down all your questions if i'm creating questions in your mind write them down on this subject on on whatever subject you are thinking about let's uh let's read hosea chapter 2 let's read from verse 19. there's a love story that is playing out here in the book of aussie and for some reason i'm feeling so tested my mouth is so dry that my tongue is sticking to the roof of my mouth praise the lord there's a there's there's a there's a lot of story that is playing out here where god is showing his love to israel that even though they have gone away from him he's using his prophet to show how they have gone into warden you know and and and all of that and and yet he's his you know his love has he he had never lost his love for them and and he's he's going to ask his prophet to do some some things but there is something here that uh that also speak to us as as a as a gentile people let's read from verse 19 the word of the lord and i will be trophy unto me forever amen that word has to do with engagement i mean it has to do with uh the betrayal that is that is uh you know uh and i will be trophy unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercy praise the lord now one thing you can think from yet is that uh god is just is he's he's kind of for uh expressing you know uh uh his inner feelings to his people amen he says uh my my the way i'm going to attach myself to you is in righteousness just like we saw in in in the life of joseph mary's hussman you know the bible used that word that he was a just man which means he never misbehaved himself around mary he never created any kind of a questionable touch and and that and i think that character that he had please god that god could visit him with the same injured i spoke to mary and that's that's why the uh you know that's what we we we we try to encourage the foundation that you lay down when you're going about you know uh desiring or thinking about uh a wife also the foundation the way you go about it is going to play out it's going to play out throughout your relationship so it's very very important praise the lord amen so god is saying yeah i will be trophy unto me in righteousness in judgment not the judgment of of condemning or or justifying that that word judgment also has the sense of uh discipline it has a sense of discipline now you have to know it is god that is telling his people how he will approach them so he's not saying i'm going to joshua i'm going to judge myself amen approach to you praise the lord in loving kindness and in mercy i will even be trophy unto me in faithfulness and thou shall know the lord [Music] and and and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear say the lord i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and the earth shall hear the cone and the wine and the oil amen and they shall hear jezreel listen to this now and i will saw her that's the prophecy now i was so hurt unto me in the earth i was saw her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that ha not mercy and i will say to them which were not my people now this is a scripture that is always attached to the gentiles so god in one sense is saying i will saw the bride in the earth that's the reason why she would come from every nation i was so hot in the earth praise the lord amen so you see this bride that is seen here in revelation chapter 21 is a harvest bride that was so in genesis in genesis a c chapter a seed bride was sold amen amen so when she come out in the harvest you cannot tell the difference between the bride and the new city i saw a city oh a bride come and see the bride oh they said it because she has come to such a place of harvest praise the lord when she was sown in genesis she went through different types and shadow praise the lord raha was a type of the bride she was a gentile woman tamar was a type of the bride she was a gentile woman praise the lord amen but that was just the bride in seafoam god sold his bride in the earth praise the lord and now we're seeing the bride in in in in in a harvest form we're seeing the bride in in full maturity and and in in in in the form of manifestation that you don't have to get to heaven to know what heaven will be just look at the bride look at her life she has come to such a maturity that just look at her life praise the lord people from different backgrounds from different nations they can all come together and you see just the sweetness and the fellowship among them no gossip and fusses in all of that amen praise the lord i saw the city coming out as a bride oh this is the bride the lion's wife come let me show you her in the city wow amen so the lord says i will saw her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that have not obtained mercy and i would say to them which were not my people they are my people and they shall say they are my god praise the lord thou are my god hallelujah amen so we see here that uh you know uh that that that there is there is there's a there's a seaform you know there's a sea form god is talking about having his bride but he's saying i'm going to saw her you know and what is the seed what is the seed that we should solve for marriage it's a word is the word is that love books and love movies if you saw those seeds for marriage you're going to reap a mess crop a harsh wheat the seed that must be sold must be the word the principle of the word lord i don't even want to think about marriage until i know i have the holy ghost are young people sowing those seeds no are we together it looks like i took you by surprise but it's okay i feel more safe when i come that way amen but also said this in a message who do you say this is he said this he says now notice the woman here represent the future denominational church called the bride now he's talking about the foolish virgin and and and and the great harlot the woman here represent the future denomination church called the bride it's all come up in genesis is a seed you start in genesis you will get your picture straight amen if you start in genesis you will get your picture straight why because that's where the seed was sown praise the lord amen so here we see that uh uh abraham's saying a a a spiritual plan of god planning he's planning his future home with his future bride amen he's planning his future home he's thinking about a home but you see he's not only thinking about uh just at home he's thinking about his bride thinking about his you know uh uh uh his future bride but there is one thing also that is important you know as you look at the spiritual uh uh approach of even almighty god god is going to get this bride he's going to get this bride majoring on his own character are you are you understanding me the kind of a man he want to be the way he want to show his attribute praise the lord so he's not thinking about a bride and saying uh what kind of a woman she will be i want her to be like this i want no he's thinking about him producing the character of the bride because she's going to be a reflection so he's primarily working on himself he's now writing less of character to expect but he's working on himself are we together i mean that's that's why we can trust him we have not come into uh just a membership we have come into a relationship praise the lord everything that almighty god promised for his bride for his church he has the power to produce it that's why we can come and rely on on our abilities or on our knowledge of what we can do and how much we can practice religion but we can trust god in his word praise the lord everything that he expects for his his bride to have five for ministry he have a holy ghost that can produce that nice spiritual gift he has a holy ghost that can produce that praise the lord so you see there is there is a whole thing there for a young man to prepare himself you have to work on yourself amen like somebody said he says every time you know the young people talk about i want a golf hairy man i want a golf hearing woman and he never says i want to be a golf hairy man the one they'd never say i want to be a god-fearing woman praise the lord are we together you know uh uh just like the dating game don't work the martian game don't work also amen we don't promise we don't practice marshmaking amen we don't promise uh practice matchmaking and as we get as we get down a little bit you will there are some things that we will appreciate here but uh uh i mean we need to we need to train ourselves and train our children praise the lord not to pick up the things of the word amen because there's such an influence there when you start hearing out of those little tear and talking about this person have crushed on me and this having crushed on this other person you better break that crutches it's not funny you better break down crutches you better break down crutches praise the lord because if you don't know how to tie your shoestring you don't need to be talking about those things those things must not be the language or conversation of little children but they pick those things from the word they pick it from school okay now with all the facebook and and youtube they pick those things up and sometimes you see parents there they're trying to you know make those things to faith praise the lord god i did not call you to be a marshmaker let's let's go a little bit over to proverbs 23 proverbs 23 praise the lord this year is becoming a little bit busy for me then i taught really than that plan for it to be but it looks like it's taking me by surprise there are a lot of responsibilities that are coming more than we thought of so we would just continue to trust the lord and and uh you know do as as as as he will now there's a beautiful scripture here that uh solomon will lay out and he will talks here uh for uh uh proverb 23 let's read from verse 15 my son if on high be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine ye my rain shall rejoice when the lips speak right things praise the lord it's always a blessing when a parent is sitting somewhere and hear the child saying something you know that is either saying something of the bible or saying something scriptural or just saying something that is that is decent there is just something that rejoices the parent's heart praise the lord let not the heart envy sinners but be that in the fear of the lord all the days long for surely there is an end and an expectation shall not be cut off praise the lord yea thou my son and be wise and guide that heart in the way praise the lord now this this very statement that solomon is using here in in a proverb that he calls god my heart in the way and in sons of solomon he used that very statement when he says don't wake up my love i might i might i get through everything today but i will find time because i really want to lay this thing down and uh so you can see uh uh and know how we intend to approach this subject from from here amen i know people have a uh you know a different way of approach and that's that's good for them now so uh yeah he says my son be wise and guide the heart you know in the way you you know uh being that among wine brothers among writers eaters of flesh for the drunkards and the grunters shall come to poverty and draws in their shell clothed clothed a man with rag yaking unto thy father that beget thee and despise not that mother when she is old now the reason why i'm bringing this uh this verse is to show the the place of parents the place of parents when it comes to guiding your heart praise the lord amen there is a very important place of parents you can unto your father that beget deed and despise not the mother when she is old by the truth and sell in net also wisdom and instruction in understanding the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that be gathered a wise child shall have joy in him their father and their mother shall be glad and she that bear thee shall rejoice praise the lord my son gave gave me the heart and let the eyes observe my ways now this goal in the place of the parents and children relationship praise the lord it goes in the place of the parent and the children relationship okay now their paul says parents provoke not your children children obey your parents there is a children obey your parents and there is a parent provoked not your children you can just hold to one the bible says children obey your parents but are you provoking the child praise the lord amen you could be provoking the child if you are not bringing them to understanding you are just subjecting them to obedience if you are not bringing them to understanding trying to explain why but i'm your father so i'm telling you you shut up oh man are we together my son gave me the heart thine heart and let an eyes observe my ways you know brother branham talks about that story of the dad that was you know coming from the drunken party then staggering all over the place and his little son jumping in his full step as he's going back and forth and he turned around and says what are you doing he says i'm walking in your footsteps [Music] praise the lord you don't you don't want to guide your hearts if they will not walk in your ways now see the next verse that will follow that for a world is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pain right after that verse the father is adding asking to god the heart of the child and saying walk in my ways the reason why uh uh the the place of the parents is very important praise the lord amen very very important uh know how much time i have okay a few more minutes and uh so we will see here i've not i've not even uh cracked a bit of what i want to look into here but it's i feel like it's going well amen i feel like it's going well because the the the major thing we want to look at here is the other uh we we got to look at our place and just like we said wednesday night he has blessed us with all spiritual blessing word in heavenly places amen in heavenly places in christ jesus a city on the hill a life of exposure that everybody might see your good work and glorify your father in heaven praise the lord christian life is a life of exposure amen it's a life of exposure you can light a candle and put it under the busher you might burn the whole house down are we together now i have to i have to just run a little bit but before i go to i have to i have to dwell on this a little bit the place of the parents very important very very important like an old old preacher says he says a child a child must be fully wrapped if a child is successfully wrapped in in in their parents it will be easy for them to fully be giving over to another to be fully wrapped in in the hands of a stranger now so we know that uh it's a place that is that is very important you know uh a place a relationship that uh i mean we we we have to bring our self-talk we have to that parent and children relationship has to be there because it creates a whole lot of trust a whole lot of a trust that they can even share their inner emotions with you praise the lord and that's the reason why the apostle paul won do not provoke him because what provoking does is that a quenches it quenches a shut them off that they can only tell you what you see but what you don't see they cannot tell you are we together okay i will quickly flip up here because i know my time is i'm getting out of time what i'm i'm glad i'm able to go like this is it kind of a little bit reduced my emotion so i'm not uh it's it's one of the things where you get to uh you know uh uh studying and you get yourself in caught up in the midst of uh uh a lot of thoughts and then you keep let's look at first tested learning let's look at first test to learning i read i preached from this couple of months back if you go back and look at the archives of simon you realize that we spoke on this and what we were talking about actually we were talking about possessing our vessel we're talking about possessing our vessel we were bringing it down to the place of possessing this vessel amen praise the lord and but we will look at this in uh in a different way we know there are a lot of idioms there are a lot of uh uh uh parables that are that are that are hidden in the scripture praise the lord there are a lot of parables that are hidden in the scripture you know uh the the truth about the macho that is the other uh uh you know many many of us i would even say myself i didn't had a you know uh i never had a very good bible message teaching you know as i was as i was growing up uh in the message you know so uh uh but over the years they are setting things that grab your attention and and you and you ask yourself is there anything in the world that addresses this praise the lord and and when that comes to your mind definitely god is going to show you it if you just keep your heart before before him and and seek he's going to show you it definitely he's going to show you that there are things that you know that is lying in the world praise the lord hallelujah and so let's let's go let's go over to uh first tester learning as i said well i was talking about idioms and solomon was one of the person that was good in uh either using an idiom or using a parable but he talks in a way for the wise to be able to grab one of them that he said year he says that would be in proverbs chapter 9 he says a foolish woman is glamorous she is simple that word simple is not talking about simplicity it's talking about being naive and knoweth nothing for she said it at the door of her house on the seat in a high place of the city there you go again she had a place of influence but this time is not a good influence she said to that place and she called all passengers all strangers who go right on their way praise the lord and i will tell you i will tell you that facebook has put us to this place it has put us to a high place where all of these young people you know it's not it's not really in the place of testimony but yeah i mean they just want to just make friends with anybody praise the lord amen amen you have to guide yourself you have to guide yourself praise the lord as soon as the person stand up with uh you know with pillow fire picture then they are brothers that pillow fire picture not supposed to be hanging over them it's supposed to be in their heart [Music] you have to make but you have to make sure it's in their heart to call passengers who go right on their way who saw the simple let him turn and in hitter and ask for him that want that understanding she said unto him stolen water the sweet and the bread eaten in secret is pleasant when maori is supposed to be a public thing she's trying to make it a secret thing praise the lord but here is the principle that that solomon is trying to lay out but he knows meant that the dead are there and that her gates are the depths of hell in the sense that when you are called to those kind of for secret feasts then you are digging your grave you are your grave because if it is not okay for you to do it in public it's not okay for you to do it in secret first to learn in chapter four now this is a scripture we will try to look at in a different way that will i will i will launch it today and then the next time we will get on this we will we will go a little bit further i will just launch it today and take a few thoughts here from the prophet of god and then we will continue he says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and in honor praise the lord not in the loss of concretencies even as the gentiles wish no not god praise the lord amen every one of you should possess his vessel now we're going to look at it in a direct sense here uh the first time we talk about it we we talk about it in a general sense of every one of us possessing our vessel possessing this body bringing it on a suggestion to the word and that's what we should do but when we look at it in in the way of marriage then it becomes the responsibility of the man what is saying you should be able to approach it incentification and honor because marriage is honorable now if you look in the scripture you will see that this word vessel has been used also for the woman when it comes to the new testament the scripture says she is a weaker vessel so that is the trench i'm going that's that's where i'm taking this thought because you will see brother brandon referring to that as well so if if it says his vessel so the man possessing his vessel but you must do it incentification don't do it in lust you have to keep it clean possess your vessel incentification and in honor you want to do it as an honorable man you want to bring honor to your parents you want to honor the girl parents are we together praise the lord hallelujah peter will use this year here he says and likewise here husband word he says dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as onto a weaker vessel praise the lord so with that in mind we we we look at this scripture here because you see there was one thing that was a the apostle paul had to deal with in the gentile church because these people has come from an unbelieving lives praise the lord he had a problem in a corinthian church with a man living with his mother his mother's father wife you know his stepmother and all of that coming coming down to truth with that form of life there must be a place where the lord you have to die to your first word of life in one sense the apostle paul is saying you cannot move on with christ carrying all these things with you praise the lord it's not just identifying and saying you know i'm i'm a believer i'm a christian i don't worship mohammed i don't worship idols anymore no no no there is one thing that the christian faith the bible christian faith brings to us is the new birth that's the reason why christianity is not a religion as people will make it because it starts with a birth amen it starts with a birth now so you see the the the uh uh paul is is using this approach now he's using this approach more more especially especially when you look at if you go back and study and you look at the context of what he's saying here in in testimony it having a lot to do with marriage because as he goes along he says that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter which of course is taking advantage of another man because we're in the message okay because we're in the message while we're in the message you should understand i'm not a baptist so what are we together question and answered on genesis brother branham says he says yeah no not on genesis question and answer lord having a shadow all the things of shadows and time when god made the heaven and the earth he made the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun is gone see a beautiful type of christ and the church the church is the moon to give light to the word why the sun is gone amen see what i mean a lesser light amen and then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife as christ and his church is husband and wife the wife being the weaker vessel only gave a smaller light in the absence of her husband which of course that light is just a reflection amen that life is just a reflection praise the lord and the church can only make manifestation of the holy ghost remember the moon cannot give any light of her own and when you see the moonlight it's only the moonlight is a reflection of the sunlight and and christ accented up is that right and shining his light on the church to reflect his light and power to the word in the in his absence praise the lord see what i mean praise the lord amen another another taught here jehovah jared he says i can imagine it was a sunday afternoon when he spoke to him maybe on monday morning how he's going to do poor little isaac he look at him talking about abraham isaac i know when god told abraham to go sacrifice isaac oh he loved him but i can look at that i got to think of obeying obeying of god so he couldn't tell sarah cause you know the ladies are the weaker vessel so you s so you sometimes you have to watch amen i can't tell sarah cause she wouldn't understand sarah never was too strong anyhow in fact because she liked she disbelieved the promise by giving hey god to abraham but abraham held her because the man and the woman are one the woman who met be safe in the old testament only by the man because it was it was second session so the marriage covered and brings the woman under the covenant of second season and she had to to be joined to her husband in order to receive it but in this last day god poured out his spirit and the women are circumcised in their heart just like the man praise the lord now there is one thing here because brother branham goes over using this this illustration that abraham couldn't tell isaac but you are you also have to watch the context when it came to uh divine instruction don't say brother branham says uh abraham couldn't tear aside because she was a weaker vessel so i will not tell my wife everything when it comes to a divine instruction praise the lord amen and i i feel i'm on a divine instruction you know i'm i don't i don't tell my wife things that has to do with people's lives i don't do it because i'm under a divine instruction i try to separate my family life from ministry so don't just don't just run in there man it's that and start building the defense praise the lord you're going to use the savings praise the lord okay let's move on here praise the lord amen verbum says here he says you women i was hollering at you he says now i'm going to take up for you a little meaning see the woman is a weaker vessel i know there can be a bad man before there's been a bad woman but man who knows that man who knows that you are a son of god and take advantage of a woman's shame on you he says no matter what she does she is a weaker vessel and you know that if you don't know that means you're not reading your bible if she goes out acting on little like take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister you are a son of god don't do them evil things look at joseph he is an example now in uh that's why you will see in the songs of solomon solomon will use this word my sister my spouse okay he will use this word my sister my spouse because she was your sister before she became your spouse praise the lord amen should we stop praise the lord i think it's one of the days i can preach for three hours huh amen praise the lord uh-huh i would take one more yet and then we'll find a place to rock this and then we will find another time because there's just a whole lot of things i want to go into the time will not permit me so i don't want to i don't get into something else and i don't finish it i don't want to i know i i'm i'm very good of keeping you in suspense but i choose i choose not to wear one today praise the lord [Music] but you have to also keep in mind you have to keep in mind we are under a word we are under a word that has been prophesied just like the bride was so in the earth that's how the the the the voice of god in this age has gone out and the word is a seed praise the lord amen and and and and they have gone out to get a bride you see god saw the promise of the bride in the earth that it does not have to come by a family line amen you don't have to come by the family line it does not have to come by a travel line you know but it's it's a blessing when uh when when we have our loved ones uh you know that that receive the word and you know and receive the lord and walking in truth it's a blessing praise the lord but you see this a soul is so soul in the earth word that i mean that the bride is is popping up from everywhere god it says uh it's it's you know what it's it's reaching out and bringing the people bringing the people out of tradition you have to remember we have to remember the purpose is to be a reflection a man can see your good works and glorify your father that is in heaven the bride has to be a reflection that's the purpose of this message she is at a place of influence the bride is at a place of influence praise the lord verbally preached the message of influence and he always takes it from the place where uh uh uh the the angels came in the temple with isaiah as i have been under the influence of yuzia but when yuzia died praise the lord god changed the effect of influence on isaiah and it's amazing when you look into the scripture read the first read the first uh uh uh five chapter of isaiah you will see that his prophecy was just about the center of jerusalem he was just dwelling with his people but after he came under the influence of those angels he broke into vision chapter 7 and saying the virgin shall conceive so the the the angels influenced him until his ministry was lifted from the earth and isaiah could prophesize about a millennium and he could prophesy even about the days that we are living in seven women would take a hold of one man the acceptable year isaiah he was lifted or because he have now come on the angelic influence that angel took a court of fire from the throne of god and put it on his lips praise the lord amen and now we in our day seven angels this bride is under the influence of seven angels praise the lord how will people produce rapture in faith and get to a talking life if you start having problems with the seven angels how are you going to produce you just stuck in a denominational life you would just hold one coat and make a doctrine around it the reason of those seven angels was to bring us higher was to was to influence this bride to start looking at the new jerusalem because she's a reflection of that city to inspire this bride to be a representation of jesus christ praise the lord amen just like that policeman in the welsh revival says you're looking for the worst survivor is right here this bride must be able to say i'm the new jerusalem not only with a confession but with a life to back it up that was the purpose of those seven angels to lift us up praise the lord god knew the kind of a depressing spirit that would come in this age amen never in a time that never in a time of of of any revival people have had a uh uh uh uh close to death experience people have had other experience but what are the purpose the purpose of the vessel beyond the curtains of time was to tell there's a land beyond the river and the mystery that it holds is that there is no dull moment in the life of a believer that's the mystery it holds that when we die we jump in another body and we can be looking our our dead body down people crying knocking yourself on the ground you are in a brand new body there is no dumb woman that's the mystery that it holds because you have to remember brother branham was he said i've always been afraid to be a spirit i never wanted to be a floating spirit so god decided to give birth an experience because paul says something in the book of in the book of timothy he says immortality has always been there that's what the baptism of the holy ghost brings to the believers it brings the experience of immortality you have immortality in this body that's the reason why you can die this body drop down you drop you drop in another one amen that fear of death that has haunted the church it's no more praise the lord so why do i care live or die i praise the lord [Music] amen that is the effect the influence that the opening of the seals brought to us glory be to god oh my god hallelujah what a people not just saying that well i'm in the message amen there is something that god is doing with this bride amen brother branham says the talking was the highlight of his ministry amen he said it was the highlight of his ministry you know why because the opening of the seals once again the revealing of those mystery once again the human soul the human soul will experience the literal life of god it's not just a feeling amen not just not just a feeling or a sensation or a belief he want to bring us to the place where in our soul because that's that's the thing that was taken there in eden life was there but that life of god the life of god once more to struck the human soul how many times did the injured of the law to the prophet if you would be sincere is a message of sincerity a message of sincerity pure pure the cleanness of life amen not just making excuse when i mean whenever i mean if if we are wrong we know that we're born in this in this body you know if god don't help us we'll die defeated why hold to the old nature and struggle with uh uh uh you know all habits and and and personality when there is a heaven fall waiting for you to experience a brand new experience in your life overcoming power praise the lord amen that is there for you to overcome lost and overcome evil thoughts and and overcome filthy desires and overcome whatever you you want to think about it's there it's there is it's at your disposal praise the lord if you take it as your own and confess it god will make your body to obey your confession praise the lord you know that's i mean just like paul said in in corinthians he says he says he says converts gift it's not a wrong thing for you to convert gift if you say lord i want to see vision it's not a wrong thing praise the lord amen lord i want to i want to see vision it's not a wrong thing all you have to do just clean your life for vision just live a life of expectation lord i want to see vision then start living a clean life law i want to experience healing in my body [Music] then start living a life of confession positive thoughts you got to fight against the demon of fear and doubt it's not wrong to desire those things praise the lord the reason is because there are things that we don't want to give up amen we want to hold one thing in our hands and think that we can enjoy the joy of the lord no the devil will always use that thing that you are holding to condemn you you always use that thing to condemn you say lord i want to i want to i want i want to experience this thing to talk about praying in the spirit i want to pray until i get lost stop by five minutes every day give five minutes the next day maybe the law may carry you to 10 minutes and 15 minutes before you realize you'll be praying you don't know where you are [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's not wrong to desire those things but you have to be willing you got to discipline yourself you got to discipline yourself praise the lord amen let me tell you something something that kind of that shocked me it shocked me because i didn't pay attention to it but i was reading and and when i even went to make research i don't know if i put in my notes i think in the next one [Music] one of the greatest redemption story in the bible that talks about the god the story of ruth amen and boaz praise the lord beautiful story beautiful story do you realize just last night last night just before i went to bed i was thinking about that again it came back to my mind and i said let me just let me just make a search on it you know really just make a search on it you can even you can even search it out on google google will tell you it will bring a reference from uh from the hebrew uh uh tamar who tells you that boas was 80 years old when he married ruth praise the lord and there is no wrecker that boaz ever did got married before ruth praise the lord and ruth she was uh i think she was in her 40s when she gave birth amen when she gave birth to obed and the bible says the women of the city said you have a son that is more than seven sons but there is something that is beautiful in the scripture there is something that is beautiful in the scripture right after boaz played the role of a king's man amen and he kicked off his shoes and we know everything about that and all of that you realize the bible did not make mention of him praise the lord amen because just for that story of redemption god kept his life when he restored all of the things that naomi lost and got married to ruth she had a child he went to be with the lord praise the lord you see so you don't have to misbehave and publicize yourself and do things just because you you think that i'm getting old and you know i got no you got to trust in this world you got to believe in the god of heaven and earth that ordained your life you think about it think about it it's not that boris was a struggling man he was a prince he had what it takes he was a kind of a man where every woman wanted but he knew there was a purpose on his life praise the lord and see ruth your god will be my god your people will be my people where you go i will go where you die with that when rue was making that statement she had not heard about boaz she was not thinking that baboa she was not thinking that she would be a type of the bride of christ but god placed that burden on her that even when her sister went back she looked back even as she was attempting to go but because god hired for the purpose to play out the greatest redemption story [Music] naomi said go go go praise the lord i believe she went she told her mother and father i'm going with naomi what are you going to do stay here praise the lord but to understand understand the mystery of redemption talking about our case man there is no place in the bible that played that out praise the lord and ruth and boss praise the lord amen and god knew that child bearing was something that would plain heart in the abrahamic coveting so even being more than 40 years close to 50 years the law still made her own filter because he wanted to place her in the promise of abraham the lord bless you less by our hearts oh how i pray that god will wave upon the hearts of the young people i know young people struggle with things they have a lot of things in their mind plants and purples and all of that how god will just give us a pentecost give us a baptism some young people that comes on a rejection and think i'm not good i'm not enough and you know all my life is ever going to bathe and all of that i mean if you just if you just just fall in love with jesus just say god i want to love you i i just i want i want that inner experience it doesn't mean that you there are things you will keep fighting you will keep struggling the devil will want to blast your mind with lustful desires and filthy desires you don't have to go out there and and and get yourself all messed up in the world [Music] the thing that is important in this let me say this to you young people you got to protect your emotion don't give your emotion to a boy or give your emotion to a girl until you know [Music] because the moment you let that out you're not going to sleep again nothing will nothing will look correct for you to do you will not have the drive for anything [Music] so [Music] anything anything and i can't do anything for me my god can't do anything oh anything [Laughter] anything [Music] god can never fail he can do anything oh my god [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh my god anything anything anything i can [Music] oh my god [Music] yes god can do anything oh anything anything my god [Music] oh let's just pray together now let's just thank the lord together heavenly father lord we just want to thank you we want to
