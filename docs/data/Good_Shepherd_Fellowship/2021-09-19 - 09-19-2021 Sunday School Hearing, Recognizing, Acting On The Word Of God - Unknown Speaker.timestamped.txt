[0:59] church spiritual
[1:01] church carnal
[1:04] ahab was a borderline believer
[1:07] he had prophets
[1:09] they wasn't infidels they wasn't idlers
[1:12] they were israelite prophets
[1:15] but they were all taught and fed and
[1:18] clothed by ahab the king
[1:20] it become like a place where they had
[1:22] all the political backing up
[1:26] jehoshaphat came in coming down
[1:30] made an alliance which is wrong
[1:32] he should never hook up with unbelievers
[1:37] we should never by no means ever put our
[1:41] names on books and churches that does
[1:43] not believe the full gospel
[1:46] never you'll get in trouble
[1:49] and they got
[1:51] in trouble
[1:52] and this righteous man said
[1:55] should not we consult the lord first and
[1:58] find out whether we should go to ramos
[2:01] gilead now look how perfect this setup
[2:03] look
[2:05] we own ramos gilead it's our property
[2:09] and the syrians have stuck it from the
[2:11] living god
[2:13] shall we not go up and possess this land
[2:15] and he made the speech so pretty
[2:18] and so legal
[2:20] and so righteous unto jehoshaphat
[2:22] hellfire yes
[2:24] the dame man can stand in the pulpit
[2:28] with such intellectual and speech making
[2:32] and education
[2:34] until they can explain
[2:36] the power of the holy spirit awaiting
[2:39] the bible
[2:41] they can explain divine healing away
[2:44] they can explain speaking in tongues and
[2:47] interpretations
[2:48] they can explain the baptism of the holy
[2:51] ghost to another day
[2:53] but a man that's elected of god
[2:56] of man my sheep know my voice
[3:02] you've got that election of god upon you
[3:05] it'll never stumble on you
[3:07] hallelujah
[3:09] jehoshaphat said the righteous king said
[3:11] isn't there a prophet that we could
[3:14] consult the lord ahab is going on
[3:16] without it
[3:17] that's the way the church carnal's doing
[3:19] today
[3:20] all they got seminaries full of
[3:22] preachers
[3:24] great men great professors
[3:26] intellectual smart witty oh my
[3:30] god far beyond
[3:32] the
[3:33] the widths
[3:34] of the church
[3:36] natura church spiritual
[3:38] in the days of noah
[3:40] in them days look at the church natural
[3:44] what were these scientists
[3:47] builders
[3:48] smart man
[3:51] but the elected
[3:53] enoch and noah were shepherds and
[3:56] farmers
[3:57] humble
[3:59] not educated not smart
[4:02] but know their god something in them
[4:04] moving
[4:05] calling we'll get to that after a bit
[4:08] now
[4:09] so jehoshaphat said isn't there a
[4:12] prophet oh of course the carnal has been
[4:15] certainly we have i've got a seminary
[4:18] down here full of them
[4:19] brought up 400
[4:21] now these are not infidels
[4:24] they are
[4:26] jehovah god worshipers
[4:30] come up
[4:31] and they said let us have a little while
[4:33] and we'll prophesy
[4:35] and so we all got together and they've
[4:37] come back with the word of the lord and
[4:38] it said thus saith the lord israelite
[4:41] prophets
[4:43] thus saith the lord
[4:46] warn up the lord is with you and you'll
[4:48] take ramoff gilead because it really
[4:51] belongs to israel
[4:53] and one of the head man made him two
[4:55] great big horns out of iron as
[4:58] representatives and he went to pushing
[5:01] he said with this you will push
[5:04] israel or push uh the syrians come out
[5:07] of ramos gilead
[5:09] but
[5:10] jehoshaphat
[5:12] something in him
[5:16] oh i hope that god gets this to your
[5:18] heart
[5:19] it's nothing you can educate yourself to
[5:22] there's nothing you can read yourself
[5:24] into
[5:25] it's what god violation does for you
[5:29] not him that run under him that's just
[5:31] god that showed mercy
[5:34] jehoshaphat said they are fine dressed
[5:37] man
[5:38] no doubt he said something like this
[5:40] they are intelligent in the smartest man
[5:42] i've ever heard
[5:44] they're educated to the moment
[5:46] their standards won a card
[5:48] they have a great unity among them
[5:51] and they are smart and they have a lot
[5:54] of truth to them
[5:56] all era has truth
[5:58] the biggest lie was ever told had 95
[6:01] truth in it
[6:02] the lie that satan told eve
[6:06] oh it's a lot of truth in what they're
[6:08] saying
[6:09] but isn't there one more
[6:13] well what do you think that man said
[6:16] when we've got 400 here are the smartest
[6:23] the best
[6:25] they're not out here in the wilderness
[6:26] running around half naked and uh
[6:28] sheepskin wrapped around them or
[6:29] something they're a man that i have fed
[6:32] i've educated
[6:33] they're not men that don't know their
[6:34] abcs they're scholars
[6:38] they know the things
[6:39] they stay day and night reading the
[6:41] scrolls and prophecies
[6:43] they know what's right
[6:45] i have them ready and they're standing
[6:46] here with
[6:47] what a card
[6:49] 400 of them saying what up the lord's
[6:51] with you
[6:53] but if i could read jehoshaphat's mind a
[6:55] few minutes there's just something that
[6:57] doesn't register he's saying
[6:59] there's just something that doesn't seem
[7:01] right
[7:03] isn't there just one more somewhere
[7:07] oh he said yes there is one more but he
[7:10] doesn't belong to the organization
[7:12] he is a different sort of a fellow
[7:15] he's just a renegade
[7:17] he's like jacob
[7:19] but we might ask him
[7:22] they say he's a prophet
[7:24] but i doubt it
[7:26] because he's always
[7:28] cursing me saying this that or the other
[7:31] or he never prophesized good about me
[7:34] how could he
[7:37] so they said let's go get him he's the
[7:39] son of england so they went and got him
[7:41] and somebody met him on the road said
[7:43] now you say the same thing they say you
[7:45] must agree with the association
[7:47] if you don't
[7:49] one to you
[7:51] he said i'll say just what god puts in
[7:55] my mouth to say and nothing else
[7:59] then
[8:00] after he got up there and they gave him
[8:02] a night
[8:03] he said go on up but i've seen israel
[8:06] scatter like sheep have an o shepherd
[8:09] and they have said did not tell you
[8:12] now there's 400 against one
[8:16] 400 trained smart educated intellectual
[8:20] man
[8:21] against one little ignoramus
[8:24] as we'd call him
[8:26] micah
[8:28] one man
[8:29] but yet that one man had the word of the
[8:32] lord that made the difference
[8:36] every one of them was false it proved
[8:38] out paul
[8:39] why was micah so different
[8:41] did he have to be poor to be different
[8:43] no
[8:45] the what made micah different he stayed
[8:47] with the word
[8:49] the word of god's what he stayed with
[8:53] now it's promised that in these days god
[8:55] will pour out his spirit
[8:57] it's promised that by daniel that the
[8:59] people in the days when the stone hits
[9:00] the image in the foot the people that
[9:02] know their god shall do exploits
[9:06] prophecy after prophecy
[9:08] and all the seminaries the world can't
[9:11] take it out god's going to do it anyhow
[9:14] and people go to follow it
[9:17] see the carnal
[9:19] and the
[9:21] natural church and the supernatural
[9:23] church
[9:25] you see the word makes the difference
[9:27] that's what jacob thought
[9:28] and no matter what i know i can never be
[9:31] blessed
[9:32] unless i get a hold of that birthright
[9:35] that birthright is what i'm going to
[9:37] have to get a hold of
[9:39] and
[9:40] but esau
[9:41] hated it
[9:43] and his children does the same thing yet
[9:45] to this day
[9:46] i hate it it's always been
[9:49] whenever there is a revival
[9:52] it always produces twins
[9:57] that's a rude remark but it's true
[10:01] when there was a birth
[10:03] out of from isaac and rebecca it
[10:05] produced twins
[10:07] when the world was created it produced
[10:09] twins two trees
[10:11] and when uh cain and abel were born it
[10:14] produced two
[10:16] when uh ishmael and isaac was born it
[10:18] produced two
[10:20] and when esau and jacob was born it
[10:22] produced two
[10:24] one of them natural
[10:27] one of them of the earth
[10:30] the other supernatural
[10:32] one looked at the natural intellectual
[10:34] the other walked by the spirit
[10:37] it's always been that way
[10:40] when the lutheran church came forth
[10:43] let's take pentecost first look at the
[10:46] pentecostal birth it brought forth a
[10:49] great powerful revival and swept the
[10:51] known world
[10:52] pentecost
[10:54] it wasn't long after pentecost even paul
[10:57] said
[10:58] that there would be man rise up among
[11:00] them with perverse things
[11:02] i am would turn the people away from god
[11:05] and that's just exactly what they done
[11:09] it produces two
[11:12] when the lutheran church was born martin
[11:15] luther brought forth a spiritual revival
[11:18] wasn't very long so here come he saw
[11:21] right behind him
[11:23] and organized it down
[11:25] and it produced two
[11:28] then after that come the methodist john
[11:30] wesley
[11:31] a spiritual revival
[11:33] and after that come the organization
[11:36] organized it down it had produced two
[11:39] and after that come pentecost
[11:42] a revival
[11:43] and now they've organized it
[11:45] and now they settle down the
[11:47] organization and it produces two
[11:50] but that spiritual seed of the living
[11:52] god though it has to be a
[11:54] sojourner
[11:56] though it has to be a rambler
[12:00] it always causes separation
[12:04] esau didn't last very long with jacob as
[12:07] soon as jacob obtained the birthright
[12:18] i don't care what church you belong to
[12:20] if it's carnal
[12:22] and associates that you run with
[12:25] the people you play cards with in your
[12:27] uh literature societies and so forth
[12:30] when you obtain the birthright that
[12:33] something is down in your heart that's
[12:35] hunger for god when you receive that it
[12:38] calls for separation
[12:40] come out from a mammal
[12:45] separation
[12:48] the church settles down
[12:50] see it cannot go on
[12:52] esau is a very good type of the carnal
[12:56] believer today
[12:57] never able to overcome the world
[13:00] he don't overcome the things of the
[13:01] world
[13:02] they still like their crowsing they're
[13:05] dancing they're
[13:06] manicure makeups and the women on their
[13:08] faces and and uh
[13:11] cutting their hair and and wearing
[13:13] little old short clothes and and man
[13:15] likes to go out to the pool rooms and
[13:17] and smoke cigarettes and tell little
[13:19] dirty jokes and still belong to the
[13:22] church
[13:24] they're never able to overcome those
[13:27] things
[13:29] neither could esau
[13:31] but yet to be religious he had to settle
[13:33] down to an intellectual
[13:35] conception
[13:37] that's the same thing the church does
[13:38] today we'll become an organization we'll
[13:41] put ourselves together we'll make a clan
[13:44] or click
[13:45] or something like that that's the way
[13:48] the church moves today the spiritual and
[13:50] the carnal
[13:52] still the same it hasn't changed and
[13:54] never will change
[13:56] god's
[13:57] holiness
[13:59] god being god projects that himself
[14:03] if there was not a sinner there would
[14:05] never he had never been a savior
[14:07] but he was the savior at the beginning
[14:11] so there was nothing lost
[14:13] and his own attributes as being a savior
[14:16] projected a sinner
[14:18] there had to be something to be saved
[14:22] before there could be anything saved
[14:23] there had to be something lost
[14:27] and his righteousness and his holiness
[14:29] if there had never been uh a sick person
[14:33] he would have never been a healer
[14:35] but from the beginning and about the
[14:37] beginnings
[14:39] he was before the beginning
[14:42] he was a healer
[14:44] so there was nothing sick
[14:47] so it projected a sick person that he
[14:50] might heal him
[14:51] to make him a healer
[14:55] out of that same holy reality that comes
[14:58] salvation come curses
[15:01] out of the same mother and father that
[15:03] projected
[15:04] jacob projected esau
[15:06] see
[15:07] it's god he can't change his plans
[15:10] they have to go just the same all nature
[15:12] will cope right into it
[15:14] it has to amen
[15:16] you get what i mean
[15:18] it moves it right in there has to be
[15:20] somebody lost to be saved
[15:22] and if it wouldn't been his him being a
[15:25] savior made that
[15:27] the deep calls to the deep amen like the
[15:30] little boy i always speak of eating
[15:32] erasers off the pencils and the pedal
[15:34] off the bicycle he needed sulfur
[15:37] and as long as there was something in
[15:38] there to crave for sulfur there had to
[15:40] be a sulfur somewhere first made
[15:43] there had to be a sulfur before he had
[15:45] the crave
[15:48] and it the sulfur projected him
[15:51] and then he went back to the sulfur
[15:54] that's the way god is a savior and there
[15:57] had to be something lost for him to say
[16:00] to make him a savior
[16:02] that's all it's doing is playing up god
[16:05] everything all is in him not in a
[16:07] preacher not in a church not in an
[16:09] organization but in god
[16:11] that the election might stand perfect
[16:14] it's in him
[16:15] yeah the lutheran
[16:17] and then um
[16:18] uh
[16:19] we see another separation
[16:22] that was abraham and lot
[16:24] they were brethren
[16:26] but lot was a carnal thinker
[16:29] he was always out for some big thing
[16:33] something with a lot of tinsel on it
[16:36] just like a monkey as i'd say always
[16:38] reaching for bright pain
[16:40] that spirit hasn't left people today
[16:43] they'll reach for they go to the city
[16:45] and they wouldn't come to a little shack
[16:46] like this no no see they want the
[16:49] biggest church there is in the city the
[16:51] most intellectual pastor where the best
[16:53] dressed people goes where the mayor goes
[16:55] to the city it's still that east all
[16:59] spirit
[17:04] really had the birthrights to begin with
[17:06] call themselves a church but they lose
[17:08] it
[17:10] because they despise it
[17:13] you can't get them people to get out on
[17:15] their knees and cry and beg out to god
[17:16] and go out and have healing service and
[17:18] stand the persecution of the world
[17:19] receive the holy ghost and they they
[17:21] won't do that
[17:23] they despise it
[17:25] they call it a bunch of holy rollers
[17:28] just what the bible said they would do
[17:30] amen they do it because that's their
[17:32] nature
[17:35] it's the nature like the crow and the
[17:37] dove
[17:38] the two natures
[17:40] they crave it because that is what they
[17:42] are they never will never see the other
[17:44] because they're not born to see that
[17:47] and the other you couldn't keep him away
[17:48] from it because it's the election of god
[17:51] he's born to be a spiritual man or a
[17:53] spiritual woman
[17:54] something in him calls for
[17:56] oh i hope this gets down to a place to
[17:59] where we can you can see what i i mean
[18:02] by
[18:03] capping it off now
[18:04] now abraham remember as long as they
[18:08] were associated together
[18:10] the church natural and the church
[18:11] spiritual they never did get the
[18:14] blessing
[18:17] jacob was never blessed until he
[18:19] separated himself from esau
[18:22] and abraham was never blessed until he
[18:24] separated himself from lot
[18:28] had his own little prayer meetings in
[18:29] his church down there
[18:31] taught his sons and daughters and them
[18:33] but he lived such a life and when they
[18:34] went talking about the end of the time
[18:36] they laughed at him
[18:38] same thing today you talk about divine
[18:39] healing and the power of god and so
[18:41] forth they lie
[18:44] it's the same spirit
[18:46] that's the two great spirits religiously
[18:49] he's got the world in grip
[18:51] the believer in the unbeliever the
[18:53] believer and the make-believer
[18:56] the one impersonating the other one
[18:58] now when abraham separated himself
[19:01] did you notice jesus in his speaking of
[19:04] the coming second coming he said as it
[19:06] was in the days of noah they'd be eating
[19:08] drinking marrying and giving in marriage
[19:10] but when he spoke of the days of lot he
[19:12] never said nothing about it
[19:14] as the days of love that's for
[19:16] revelation
[19:17] watch what happened in the days of love
[19:19] there was lot down there in sodom well
[19:22] settled down intellectually become the
[19:23] one the big man of the city the judge
[19:26] said in the gates and judged the people
[19:28] his wife flung to all the societies
[19:30] there was of the city and his daughters
[19:31] and all them married amongst a celebrity
[19:34] intellectual highly educated smart witty
[19:37] and abraham lived in a tent under an oak
[19:39] tree
[19:41] but one day they both got a visitation
[19:45] and there was an intellectual preacher
[19:47] went out and preached and called him out
[19:50] look at the look at the message come out
[19:52] he said a lot
[19:55] and he had never been called out if it
[19:57] hadn't been for the mercy of abraham
[19:59] i said can i find 50 man will you spirit
[20:03] can i find 30 man can i if i find 10
[20:06] that's as far as he'd go and he couldn't
[20:08] even find 10 among them
[20:10] no wonders it wasn't the days of noah
[20:13] remember noah wasn't the type of the
[20:16] church
[20:17] enoch was they didn't go through the
[20:19] tribulation but was translated
[20:22] before the tribulation set in
[20:24] enoch went home he didn't go through the
[20:26] tribulation noah carried through
[20:29] now
[20:30] watch closely now as we move up into
[20:33] this watch what kind of a sign that
[20:37] abraham's and his family got they got
[20:40] the supernatural
[20:42] abraham how do you know he was abraham
[20:44] or is your wife sarah how do you know he
[20:46] was married or had a wife sarah
[20:49] she's in the tent now a man sitting
[20:50] there eating meat drinking milk and
[20:52] eating cornbread
[20:54] where is your wife sarah
[20:57] how did he know that thing how did he
[20:59] know it think of it you call you
[21:02] spiritual people let this get into you
[21:05] how did he know that when he acted like
[21:07] a stranger dust on his clothes
[21:09] and when abraham said she's in the tent
[21:11] behind you
[21:13] and he said i'm going to the ah ah
[21:15] personal pronoun i this man
[21:18] god making himself known in flesh
[21:23] god abraham calling elohim
[21:27] ah
[21:28] i'm going to visit you
[21:32] i'm going to keep my promise
[21:36] and according to the time of life i'm
[21:38] going to visit you you're going to have
[21:40] this boy
[21:41] but i spoke to you about
[21:43] abraham 100

[21:47] and sarah way back in the tent before
[21:49] the little tints the main tent sitting
[21:51] in the back behind the flaps she's
[21:54] listening she heard it and down in her
[21:56] heart she smiled said me an old woman of
[21:59] a hundred years old and my lord her
[22:02] husband
[22:04] my lord and old
[22:06] and think that we'd have pleasure
[22:07] together again as young married people
[22:09] oh how could it be and she kind of
[22:11] smiled he had his back turned to the
[22:14] tent he said why did she laugh
[22:17] oh brother
[22:19] am i there you are
[22:21] look at the church carnal getting the
[22:23] gospel preached to him a modern billy
[22:25] graham and them down there preaching the
[22:26] gospel come out of it
[22:29] but did they come no
[22:32] very very very few watch the group of
[22:34] abraham that called out
[22:37] i noticed and he gave him this sign
[22:40] and he believed him
[22:42] and he vanished before him
[22:44] and went away
[22:46] oh how it has always been the separation
[22:48] they're called out
[22:50] now these two spirits to hurry up with
[22:52] you hurry up now to get to my spot to
[22:55] where i want you to see
[22:57] these two groups has
[22:59] associated close together all down to
[23:04] the ages since the very beginning of
[23:06] time the church natural the church
[23:09] spiritual
[23:10] they've been through the old testament
[23:12] it's through the new testament and
[23:13] they're down yet today
[23:15] now about 2 000 years ago
[23:18] it came to a head
[23:20] and it headed up into man
[23:22] one of them jesus christ the other judas
[23:25] is carrick
[23:26] now jesus associated the coming of his
[23:30] second coming that these two spirits
[23:32] should be a lot different than what
[23:34] there was back there now here's where i
[23:37] want you to put on your
[23:39] your glory garments
[23:42] these two spirits are going to be
[23:43] different because satan come and lived
[23:46] in a man that was a church member judas
[23:48] is karen
[23:49] lived in the carnal church and was a
[23:51] friend to the church all the time
[23:53] but he come in and tr and deceived or
[23:57] thought he was deceiving his brother
[24:00] he come in and pertained to be one of
[24:03] them tasted the good things of god moved
[24:06] right along in the spirit seeming to be
[24:09] went out and preached the gospel and
[24:10] cast out devils but down in him all the
[24:14] time he was judas to begin with
[24:16] the bible said he was born the son of
[24:20] perdition
[24:22] now remember there's church carnal
[24:23] background the esau
[24:25] the pharisees and sadducees
[24:28] but watch this guy who thanks himself
[24:30] just to
[24:31] he'll go along with the message for a
[24:32] while
[24:34] but he just don't want to put his hands
[24:35] too much on him
[24:37] see them spirits jesus said it'll be so
[24:40] close to the real thing it'll deceive
[24:42] the very elected elected if you'll
[24:45] notice it
[24:47] if it was possible but it ain't possible
[24:52] it'll deceive now watch not just the
[24:54] carnal church
[24:56] the one out there the regular routine
[24:58] carnal church the esau group we got now
[25:00] the juditarian group
[25:03] which is far
[25:04] more trenches
[25:06] far more trenches
[25:09] coming right up into the very hands
[25:12] of the blessing
[25:13] just like in hebrews 6 and 10
[25:16] i said heaven once uh made partakers and
[25:20] has tasted the powers of the world to
[25:22] come and have done all these things and
[25:24] then if they have received the knowledge
[25:26] of the truth and then if they willfully
[25:28] turn away
[25:30] willfully
[25:31] what is that counting the blood of the
[25:33] covenant wherewith they were sanctified
[25:34] an unholy thing let me give you an
[25:36] illustration
[25:38] here it is
[25:39] here's a man he's a good fellow nice boy
[25:41] he's called he feels in his heart he
[25:44] wants to be a minister all right he
[25:46] accepts jesus personal savior he's a
[25:49] nice boy nobody can say nothing against
[25:50] him after a while the subject of
[25:53] sanctification the man lusts when he
[25:54] looks at women
[25:56] it's in him see and then the next thing
[25:58] maybe he's a smoked and he wants to
[25:59] smoke maybe he wants to gamble maybe he
[26:02] wants to do some bad things he knows you
[26:04] ought to do that so he says oh god apply
[26:06] the blood of jesus to me and sanctify me
[26:09] and he gets sanctified he can shout
[26:11] praise the lord do some things too go
[26:14] out and do things
[26:15] remember jesus said that type would be
[26:17] there that day many will come and say
[26:19] lord have not i prophesied preached
[26:22] have not i cast out devils in your name
[26:24] jesus said i didn't even know you work
[26:25] of iniquity
[26:28] there they are
[26:29] watch this now we're coming to
[26:31] making the 100th millions of
[26:34] hair
[26:36] right down to the sharp age of the
[26:38] gospel
[26:39] sharper than a two-aged sword cutting
[26:42] even to the sound of the bone and a
[26:43] discerner
[26:45] hallelujah
[26:47] god let it go through
[26:49] a deserter of the thoughts of the mind
[26:52] amen
[26:54] that's the gospel
[26:56] the power of god the word of god made
[26:58] manifest is the gospel
[27:00] you say the bible said that's that's the
[27:02] word of god well the word made manifest
[27:04] is the gospel the gospel came to us not
[27:06] through word only but through power and
[27:08] demonstrations of the holy ghost
[27:12] to demonstrate the power make the gospel
[27:14] live
[27:16] when i went to india archbishop uh of
[27:20] the methodist church come out to mr
[27:21] branham we don't know anything about a
[27:22] missionary we know more about the bible
[27:24] you all ever will know said we was a
[27:26] church and settled here 2 000 years
[27:28] before he was a nation that's right
[27:30] but said we hear that god has visited
[27:33] you
[27:34] and brought a gift that can make this
[27:36] bible live
[27:38] that that's what we're interested in
[27:41] oh my god
[27:43] see that man was a son not a grandson as
[27:46] david said
[27:48] we want to know
[27:50] is it true
[27:52] i said certainly it is true
[27:54] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[27:56] and forever
[27:57] now
[27:58] noticing
[28:00] the church natural
[28:01] persecuting the church spiritual
[28:04] now we find out then that judas
[28:08] pretending to be a brother
[28:11] a brother
[28:12] and that headed up
[28:14] and finally come to a climax i watch
[28:16] this young preacher he comes to a place
[28:18] he says lord i've been looking upon
[28:21] women i want to do that
[28:22] i've been you know kind of
[28:24] doing the things of the world i
[28:26] shouldn't do that i've been spending my
[28:28] money on horse races i shouldn't do that
[28:30] i've been going every night to picture
[28:32] shows i shouldn't do that i enjoy even
[28:35] vulgarity pictures and things like that
[28:37] i got pinups in my room i shouldn't do
[28:39] that that's things the world sanctify me
[28:42] lord and the lord said all right i'll do
[28:44] that he applies the blood of jesus
[28:46] christ and sanctifies him then when he
[28:48] does that one night he passes by and he
[28:50] hears something he goes over and listens
[28:53] he hears of the baptism of the holy
[28:55] ghost the filling of the spirit
[29:00] then
[29:01] he looks over into it
[29:03] oh my isn't that wonderful but say that
[29:07] would ruin my ministry if i preach that
[29:10] that would make mommy run me away from
[29:12] home
[29:13] they'd turn me out of my church if i
[29:15] ever went into that
[29:16] oh i better leave away from that but let
[29:18] me look to it that's that's the truth
[29:20] the bible says well like a certain
[29:22] famous minister worldwide knowing was
[29:25] found recently by a man that was with me
[29:27] in puerto rico on his knees speaking in
[29:30] tongues
[29:31] in london england a powerful man one of
[29:34] the greatest evangelists in the world
[29:36] today
[29:37] and this man his brother being with me
[29:38] here a spirit-filled man run to him and
[29:41] said oh
[29:43] brother
[29:44] that's it
[29:46] he said i know it i know it but look let
[29:48] me tell you something he said preach it
[29:49] now
[29:50] preach it this is the hour with your
[29:52] influence you can shake the world he
[29:54] said no i can't preach it
[29:57] see
[29:58] the church would turn me down i couldn't
[30:00] preach that
[30:01] i couldn't do it
[30:03] whole brother
[30:06] have res once been sanctified
[30:10] and has come up
[30:11] to receive the knowledge of the truth
[30:14] look into it see this right
[30:16] and turn away
[30:18] seeing that they crucify to themselves
[30:21] the son of god
[30:22] and put him into an open shame
[30:24] ashamed of the gospel
[30:27] paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[30:28] of jesus christ for it is the power
[30:32] am i a god in the
[30:35] power of god
[30:37] working among his church but they said i
[30:39] couldn't do that this man said they'd
[30:41] make me pentecostal didn't make me he
[30:43] said
[30:44] my my reputation to be ruined
[30:47] oh brother i ain't got no reputation i'm
[30:49] thinking about his
[30:51] his reputation that's the one
[30:54] but see how close they can come to it
[30:56] you know and count the blood of the
[30:58] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[30:59] with a thing that sanctified him and
[31:02] took him out of the world and try to put
[31:04] him over in here and then he looks upon
[31:06] it and has a knowledge of it to turn
[31:08] away from it
[31:10] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[31:12] sin
[31:14] said the bible but a fearful
[31:17] looking for the judgment and a fiery
[31:19] indignation should shout which shall
[31:21] desire the adversary
[31:23] revenges his mind saith the lord he
[31:25] despised moses lord died without mercy
[31:28] under two or three witnesses how much
[31:30] more
[31:31] punishment and sore punishment though
[31:33] worthy a minister
[31:35] who has trod the blood of jesus christ
[31:37] under his feet after receiving the
[31:39] knowledge of the truth and counted an
[31:41] unholy thing
[31:44] see where we're at jesus said be careful
[31:47] see how judas was he was right with them
[31:51] he was the esau made greater
[31:54] for this age
[31:56] he was the deceiver the impersonator
[31:59] made greater for this age
[32:02] here he come right up to again a brother
[32:04] of jesus a pretended brother
[32:11] but in his heart
[32:13] he was with the old carnal church all
[32:15] the time because that's where he sold
[32:17] jesus to
[32:18] he sold jesus his birthrights
[32:22] just as much as esau did for a mess of
[32:25] pottage
[32:27] [Music]
[32:49] you
