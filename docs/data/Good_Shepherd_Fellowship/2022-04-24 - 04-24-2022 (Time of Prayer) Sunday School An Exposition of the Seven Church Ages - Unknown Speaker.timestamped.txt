[0:07] so
[0:14] [Music]
[1:30] so
[1:34] [Music]
[2:18] and it stands fast
[2:20] he does it and it is done forever
[2:22] none can take from what he says or add
[2:24] to it
[2:27] amen
[2:30] aren't you glad that you serve that kind
[2:32] of a god
[2:33] you can know exactly
[2:48] it means that whatever he said to the
[2:50] first age and to the second and to all
[2:53] ages about his own true church and about
[2:55] the false vine is exactly right and it
[2:57] won't change
[2:59] it means that what he started out with
[3:01] in genesis he will finish in revelation
[3:04] he has two for he is the amen so let it
[3:07] be
[3:09] now we can see again why the devil hates
[3:10] the books of genesis and revelation
[3:13] he hates the truth
[3:14] he knows the truth will prevail
[3:17] he knows what his end will be
[3:19] how he fights that
[3:21] but we are on the winning side
[3:23] we i mean the believers of his word only
[3:26] are on the amen side
[3:29] these things saith the faithful and true
[3:31] witness
[3:32] now i want to show you what i find in
[3:34] the thought of faithful
[3:36] you know you often talk about a great
[3:38] unchanging god whose word does not
[3:40] change
[3:41] and when we speak of him after that man
[3:43] are we all going to get a view of him
[3:44] that
[3:47] it is as though god made the whole
[3:49] universe and all the laws that pertain
[3:51] to it and then stood back and became a
[3:53] great impersonal god
[3:55] it is as though god made a way of
[3:57] salvation for lost mankind that way
[4:00] being the cross
[4:01] and then when the death of christ has
[4:03] atoned for our sins and his resurrection
[4:05] gave us an open door to him god just
[4:08] folded his arms and stood back
[4:10] it is as if we majored in believing in a
[4:12] great creator who having created lost
[4:14] personal interest in his creation
[4:17] now i say that is how too many people
[4:19] are apt to think
[4:20] but that is wrong thinking
[4:22] for god is governing in the affairs of
[4:24] men right now
[4:26] he is both creator and sustainer
[4:29] colossians 1
[4:30] 16-17
[4:32] for by him were all things created that
[4:35] are in heaven and that are in earth
[4:37] visible and invisible whether they be
[4:39] thrones or dominions or principalities
[4:42] or powers
[4:43] all things were created by him and for
[4:45] him
[4:46] and he is before all things and by him
[4:49] all things consist
[4:51] he is a sovereign god
[4:53] by his own counsel he purposed the plan
[4:55] of the salvation of his own elect which
[4:57] he foreknew
[4:59] the son died upon the cross to establish
[5:01] the means of salvation and the holy
[5:03] spirit carefully executes the will of
[5:05] the father
[5:06] he is working all things at this moment
[5:08] according to the purpose of his own will
[5:11] he is right in the midst of it all
[5:13] he is in the midst of his church
[5:15] this great creator savior god is
[5:18] faithfully working amongst his own right
[5:20] now as the great shepherd of the sheep
[5:22] his very existence is for his own he
[5:25] loves them and cares for them his eye is
[5:27] ever upon them
[5:29] when the word says that your lives are
[5:31] hid with christ in god it means exactly
[5:34] what it says
[5:35] oh i am so glad that my god abides
[5:37] faithful
[5:38] he is true to himself he won't lie
[5:41] he is true to the word he will back it
[5:43] up he is true to us he will lose none of
[5:46] us but raise us up in the last day
[5:49] i am glad that i am resting in his
[5:51] faithfulness
[5:53] philippians 1 6
[5:55] being confident of this very thing that
[5:58] he which hath begun a good work in you
[6:00] will perform it until the day of jesus
[6:02] christ
[6:04] he is the true witness
[6:06] now this word true is the same word we
[6:09] saw back there in revelation 3 7.
[6:11] you recall that it does not mean true as
[6:14] in contrast with false
[6:16] it has a richer deeper meaning by far
[6:19] it expresses perfect realization in
[6:21] contrast to partial realization
[6:24] now back in the philadelphian age the
[6:26] coming of the lord was drawing nigh
[6:28] what great love that age manifested for
[6:30] him
[6:31] it reminds me of those beautiful words
[6:33] of first peter 1 8
[6:35] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[6:38] though now ye see him not yet believing
[6:41] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[6:43] full of glory
[6:44] with them we rejoice also
[6:47] we haven't seen him but we have felt him
[6:50] we know him now as much as our limiting
[6:52] senses can let us
[6:53] but one day it will be face to face
[6:56] that is for this age
[6:58] he is coming at the end of this age
[7:01] partial realization will be made perfect
[7:03] realization completed realization
[7:06] hallelujah
[7:07] we have been looking through a glass
[7:09] darkly but soon it will be face to face
[7:11] we have been going from glory to glory
[7:14] but soon it will be right in the glory
[7:16] and in his glory we'll shine
[7:19] we shall be like him wondrously like him
[7:21] jesus our savior divine
[7:24] isn't that wonderful
[7:26] we are complete in him
[7:28] that is true
[7:29] he would not lie to us about that
[7:31] but one day we will be change any atoms
[7:34] we will put on immortality
[7:37] we will be all swallowed up in life
[7:39] then we will realize realization
[7:44] he is the faithful and true witness
[7:46] now we think of that word witness
[7:49] well that word is the one we get the
[7:50] word martyr from
[7:52] the bible speaks of stephen and antipas
[7:54] and others as martyrs they were martyrs
[7:57] but they were also witnesses
[7:59] jesus was a faithful martyr the holy
[8:02] ghost is the witness to that
[8:04] the spirit bears record of that
[8:06] the world hated jesus it killed him
[8:09] but god loved him and he went to the
[8:11] father
[8:12] the proof that he went to the father is
[8:14] that the holy ghost came
[8:16] if jesus had not been received of the
[8:18] father the spirit would not have come
[8:20] read it in john 16 7-11
[8:24] nevertheless i tell you the truth it is
[8:27] expedient for you that i go away
[8:29] for if i go not away the comforter will
[8:31] not come unto you
[8:33] but if i depart i will send him unto you
[8:36] and when he is come he will reprove the
[8:38] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[8:40] judgment
[8:41] of sin because they believe not on me
[8:44] of righteousness because i go to my
[8:46] father
[8:47] and ye see me no more
[8:49] of judgment because the prince of this
[8:51] world is judged
[8:53] the presence of the holy spirit in this
[8:55] world instead of jesus being here proves
[8:58] that jesus was righteous and went to the
[9:00] father
[9:01] but also said in john 14 18
[9:04] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[9:07] come to you
[9:08] he sent the comforter he was the
[9:11] comforter he came back in spirit upon
[9:14] the true church
[9:15] he is the faithful and true witness in
[9:17] the midst of the church
[9:19] but one day he is going to come back in
[9:21] flesh again
[9:22] he will prove then who is the only wise
[9:25] potentate it is he jesus christ the lord
[9:28] of glory
[9:30] faithful and true witness creator and
[9:32] sustainer perfect realization the amen
[9:35] of god
[9:36] oh how i love him how i adore him jesus
[9:39] the son of god
[9:42] i want to close my thoughts on this part
[9:43] of this salutation with these words of
[9:45] second corinthians 1 18-22
[9:49] but as god is true our word toward you
[9:52] was not yea and nay
[9:54] for the son of god jesus christ who was
[9:56] preached among you by us even by me and
[9:59] silvanus and timotheus
[10:01] was not yay and nay but in him was yea
[10:05] for all the promises of god in him are
[10:07] ye
[10:08] and in him amen unto the glory of god by
[10:10] us
[10:12] now he which establisheth us with you in
[10:14] christ and hath anointed us is god
[10:17] who have also sealed us and given us the
[10:19] earnest of the spirit in our hearts
[10:22] the beginning of the creation of god
[10:25] that is who the lord jesus says he is
[10:28] but those words don't mean exactly as
[10:30] they sound to us
[10:32] just taking them the way they sound has
[10:34] made some people in fact multitudes of
[10:36] people get the idea that jesus was the
[10:38] first creation of god making him lower
[10:41] than godhead
[10:42] then this first creation created all the
[10:44] rest of the universe and whatsoever it
[10:46] contains
[10:47] but that is not right
[10:49] you know that doesn't line up with the
[10:51] rest of the bible
[10:52] the words are
[10:54] he is the beginner or author of the
[10:56] creation of god
[10:58] now we know for a surety that jesus is
[11:00] god very god
[11:02] he is the creator
[11:03] john 1 3
[11:06] all things were made by him and without
[11:08] him was not anything made that was made
[11:11] he is the one of whom it is said genesis
[11:13] 1 1
[11:14] in the beginning god created the heaven
[11:16] and the earth
[11:18] also it says in exodus 20 11
[11:21] for in six days the lord made heaven and
[11:23] earth the sea and all that in them is
[11:26] and rest of the seventh day
[11:29] see there is no doubt that he is the
[11:31] creator
[11:32] he was the creator of a finished
[11:34] physical creation
[11:36] surely we can see what these words mean
[11:38] now
[11:39] to have any other interpretation would
[11:41] mean that god created god
[11:43] how could god be created when he himself
[11:45] is the creator
[11:47] but now he is standing in the midst of
[11:49] the church
[11:50] as he stands there revealing who he is
[11:52] in this last age he calls himself the
[11:55] author of the creation of god
[11:57] this is another creation
[11:59] this has to do with the church
[12:02] this is a special designation of himself
[12:04] he is the creator of that church
[12:07] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[12:09] bride
[12:10] as the spirit of god he came down and
[12:12] created in the virgin mary the cells
[12:15] from which his body was born
[12:17] i want to repeat that
[12:18] he created the very cells in the womb of
[12:21] mary for that body
[12:23] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[12:24] simply give life to a human ovum
[12:26] supplied by mary
[12:28] that would have been simple mankind
[12:30] producing a body
[12:31] that would not have produced the last
[12:33] adam
[12:34] of him it was said
[12:36] blow a body has thou father prepared for
[12:39] me
[12:40] god not mary provided that body
[12:43] mary was the human incubator and she
[12:45] carried that holy child and brought him
[12:46] to birth
[12:47] it was a god man
[12:49] he was the son of god
[12:51] he was of the new creation
[12:54] man and god met and joined he was the
[12:56] first of this new race he is the head of
[12:59] this new race
[13:00] colossians 1 18
[13:03] and he is the head of the body the
[13:05] church who is the beginning the
[13:07] firstborn from the dead that in all
[13:09] things he might have the preeminence
[13:11] second corinthians 5 17
[13:15] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[13:17] a new creation
[13:18] old things have passed away behold all
[13:21] things are become new
[13:24] there you can see that though man was of
[13:25] the old order or creation
[13:28] now in union with christ he has become
[13:30] the new creation of god
[13:33] ephesians 2
[13:34] 10
[13:35] for we are his workmanship created in
[13:37] union with christ jesus unto good works
[13:41] ephesians 4 24
[13:43] and that ye put on the new man which
[13:46] after god is created in righteousness
[13:47] and true holiness
[13:49] this new creation is not the old
[13:51] creation made over or it could not be
[13:53] called a new creation
[13:55] this is exactly what it says it is
[13:58] new creation
[13:59] it is another creation distinct from the
[14:01] old one
[14:03] no longer is he dealing by ways of the
[14:05] flesh that was how he dealt with israel
[14:08] he chose abraham and of abraham's issue
[14:10] through the godly isaac line
[14:13] but now out of every kindred tribe and
[14:15] nation he has purposed a new creation
[14:18] he is the first of that creation
[14:20] he was god created in the form of man
[14:23] now by his spirit he is creating many
[14:25] sons unto himself
[14:27] god the creator creating himself a part
[14:29] of his creation
[14:31] this is the true revelation of god
[14:34] this was his purpose
[14:35] this purpose took form through election
[14:38] that is why he could look right down to
[14:39] the last age when all would be over and
[14:42] see himself still in the midst of the
[14:44] church as author of this new creation of
[14:46] god
[14:48] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[14:50] by his own decree he elected the members
[14:52] of this new creation
[14:54] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[14:56] children according to the good pleasure
[14:58] of his will
[14:59] by his omniscience and omnipotence he
[15:02] brought it to pass
[15:03] how else could he know that he would be
[15:05] standing in the midst of the church
[15:07] receiving glory from his brethren if he
[15:09] did not make sure
[15:11] all things he knew
[15:12] and all things he worked out according
[15:15] to what he knew in order that his
[15:16] purpose and good pleasure be brought to
[15:18] pass
[15:19] ephesians 2 11
[15:22] in whom also we have obtained an
[15:24] inheritance being predestinated
[15:26] according to the purpose of him who
[15:28] worketh all things after the council of
[15:30] his own will
[15:32] hallelujah aren't you glad that you
[15:34] belong to him
[15:37] the message to the laodicean age
[15:40] revelation 3 15-19
[15:44] i know thy works that thou art neither
[15:46] cold nor hot
[15:48] i would thou art cold or hot so then
[15:50] because thou art luke warm and neither
[15:52] cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my
[15:55] mouth
[15:56] because thou sayest i am rich and
[15:58] increased with goods and have need of
[16:00] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[16:02] wretched and miserable and poor and
[16:04] blind and naked
[16:06] i counter thee to buy of me gold tried
[16:09] in the fire
[16:10] that thou mayest be rich and white
[16:12] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[16:15] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[16:16] not appear and anoint thine eyes what
[16:19] eyes have that thou mayest see as many
[16:22] as i love i rebuke and chasten be
[16:25] zealous therefore and repent
[16:28] as we have read this together i am sure
[16:30] that you have noticed that the spirit
[16:32] has not said one kind thing about this
[16:34] age
[16:35] he makes two indictments and pronounces
[16:37] his sentence upon them
[16:39] 1
[16:40] revelation 3
[16:42] 15 and 16
[16:44] i know thy works that thou art neither
[16:47] cold nor hot
[16:48] i would that thou art cold or hot
[16:51] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[16:53] neither cold nor hot i will spew the out
[16:55] of my mouth
[16:58] we are going to look at this carefully
[17:00] it says that this laodicean church age
[17:02] group is lukewarm
[17:04] this lukewarmness demands a penalty from
[17:06] god
[17:07] the penalty is that they will be spewed
[17:09] out of his mouth
[17:11] here is where we don't want to go astray
[17:12] as a lot of folks do
[17:15] they very unwisely say that god can spew
[17:17] you out of his mouth and that proves
[17:19] that there is no such thing as any truth
[17:21] to the doctrine of the perseverance of
[17:23] the saints
[17:24] i want to correct your thinking right
[17:26] now
[17:27] this verse is not given to an individual
[17:30] it is given to the church
[17:32] he is talking to the church
[17:35] furthermore if you will just keep the
[17:36] word in mind you will recall that
[17:39] nowhere does it say that we are in the
[17:41] mouth of god
[17:42] we are engraved on his palms we are
[17:44] carried in his bosom
[17:46] way back in the unknown ages before time
[17:48] we were in his mind
[17:50] we are in his sheepfold and in his
[17:52] pastures but never in his mouth
[17:55] but what is in the mouth of the lord
[17:57] the word is in his mouth matthew 4 4
[18:02] but he answered and said
[18:04] it is written man shall not live by
[18:06] bread alone but by every word that
[18:08] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[18:11] the word is supposed to be in our mouths
[18:13] too now we know that the church is his
[18:16] body it is here taking his place
[18:19] what will be in the mouth of the church
[18:21] the word
[18:22] first peter 4 11
[18:25] if any man speak let him speak as the
[18:27] oracle's word of god
[18:29] second peter 1 21
[18:32] for the prophecy came not in old time by
[18:35] the will of man but holy man of god
[18:37] spake as they were moved by the holy
[18:39] ghost
[18:41] then what is wrong with these people of
[18:42] the last day
[18:44] they have gotten away from the word
[18:46] they are no longer fervent about it they
[18:49] are lukewarm about it
[18:50] i am going to prove that right now
[18:53] the baptists have their creeds and
[18:55] dogmas based on the word and you can't
[18:57] shake them
[18:58] they say the apostolic days of miracles
[19:00] are over and there is no baptism with
[19:02] the holy ghost subsequent to believing
[19:05] the methodists say based on the word
[19:08] there is no water baptism sprinkling is
[19:11] not baptism and that sanctification is a
[19:13] baptism with the holy ghost
[19:16] the church of christ majors in
[19:17] regenerational baptism and in all too
[19:19] many cases they go down dry sinners and
[19:22] come up wet ones
[19:24] yet they claim their doctrine is word
[19:26] based
[19:27] go right down the line and come to the
[19:29] pentecostals
[19:30] do they have the word
[19:32] give them the word test and see
[19:35] they will sell out the word sensation
[19:37] just about every time
[19:39] if you can produce a manifestation like
[19:41] oil and blood and tongues and other
[19:43] signs whether in the word or not
[19:45] or whether properly interpreted from the
[19:47] word the majority will fall for it
[19:50] but what has happened to the word
[19:53] the word has been put aside so god says
[19:56] i am going against you all
[19:58] i will spew you out of my mouth
[20:01] this is the end
[20:02] for seven out of seven ages i have seen
[20:04] nothing but men esteeming their own word
[20:06] above mind
[20:08] so at the end of this age i am spewing
[20:10] you out of my mouth it is all over i am
[20:13] going to speak all right
[20:15] yes i am here in the midst of the church
[20:17] the amen of god faithful and true will
[20:19] reveal himself and it will be by my
[20:22] prophet
[20:23] oh yes that is so
[20:25] revelation 10 7
[20:27] and in the days of the voice of the
[20:29] seventh messenger when he shall begin to
[20:31] sound the mystery of god should be
[20:33] finished
[20:34] as he has declared to his servants the
[20:36] prophets
[20:37] there it is
[20:39] he is sending a vindicated prophet
[20:41] he is sending a prophet after almost 2
[20:44] 000 years
[20:45] he is sending someone who is so far from
[20:47] organization
[20:48] education and the world of religion that
[20:51] is john the baptist and elijah of old he
[20:54] will hear only from god and he will have
[20:56] thus saith the lord and speak for god
[20:59] he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it
[21:02] is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn the
[21:06] hearts of the children back to the
[21:08] fathers
[21:09] he will bring back the elect of the last
[21:11] day and they will hear a vindicated
[21:13] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[21:15] with paul
[21:16] he will restore the truth as they had it
[21:19] and those elect with him in that day
[21:21] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[21:23] lord and be his body and be his voice
[21:26] and perform his works
[21:28] hallelujah do you see it
[21:31] a momentary consideration of church
[21:33] history will prove how accurate this
[21:35] thought is
[21:37] in the dark ages the word was almost
[21:39] entirely lost to the people
[21:41] but god sent luther with the word the
[21:44] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[21:47] but they organized and again the pure
[21:49] word was lost for organization tends
[21:51] toward dogma and creeds and not simple
[21:53] word
[21:55] they could no longer speak for god then
[21:58] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[22:00] with the word in his day
[22:02] the people who took his revelation from
[22:04] god became the living epistles read and
[22:06] known of all men for their generation
[22:09] when the methodists failed
[22:11] god raised up others and so it has gone
[22:14] on through the years
[22:15] until in this last day
[22:17] there is again another people in the
[22:19] land who under their messenger will be
[22:20] the final voice to the final age
[22:24] yes sir
[22:25] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[22:27] of god
[22:29] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[22:31] turning on her
[22:33] he will confound her through the prophet
[22:35] and the bride for the voice of god will
[22:37] be in her
[22:39] yes it is for it says in the last
[22:40] chapter of revelation verse 17
[22:43] the spirit and the bride say come
[22:46] once more the world will hear direct
[22:48] from god as at pentecost
[22:50] but of course that word bride will be
[22:52] repudiated as in the first age
[22:55] now he has cried out to this last age
[22:58] you have the word
[22:59] you have more bibles than ever
[23:01] but you are not doing anything about the
[23:03] word except dividing and hacking it into
[23:05] pieces
[23:06] taking what you want and leaving out
[23:08] what you don't want
[23:10] you are not interested in living it but
[23:12] debating it
[23:13] i would sooner you were cold or hot if
[23:16] you were cold and rejected it i could
[23:17] stand that
[23:19] if you would get white hot to know its
[23:20] truth and live it i would praise you for
[23:22] that
[23:23] but when you simply take my word and
[23:25] don't honor it i in return must refuse
[23:28] to honor you
[23:29] i will spew you out for you nauseate me
[23:33] now anybody knows that it is lukewarm
[23:35] water that makes you sick at the stomach
[23:38] if you need any medic lukewarm water is
[23:40] about the best thing to drink
[23:43] a lukewarm church has made god sick and
[23:45] he has declared he will spew it out
[23:47] reminds us how he felt just before the
[23:49] flood doesn't it
[23:51] oh would to god the church were cold or
[23:53] hot
[23:54] best of all she should be fervent hot
[23:57] but she is not
[23:58] sentence has been passed
[24:00] she is no longer god's voice to the
[24:02] world she will maintain that she is but
[24:04] god says not
[24:07] oh god still has a voice for the people
[24:09] of the world even as he has given a
[24:11] voice to the bride
[24:13] that voice is in the bride as we have
[24:14] said and we will talk more about that
[24:16] later
[24:18] 2
[24:19] revelation 3 17-18
[24:23] because thou sayest i am rich and
[24:25] increased with goods and have need of
[24:27] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[24:29] wretched and miserable and poor and
[24:31] blind and naked
[24:33] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[24:36] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[24:39] white raiment that thou mayest be
[24:40] clothed
[24:41] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[24:43] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[24:46] eyes have that thou mayest see
[24:49] now look at the first phrase of this
[24:51] verse
[24:52] because thou sayest
[24:54] see they were speaking
[24:56] they were talking as the mouthpiece of
[24:57] god
[24:59] this proves exactly what i said verses
[25:01] 16 through 17 meant
[25:04] but though they say it that does not
[25:05] make it right
[25:07] the catholic church says she speaks for
[25:09] god saying she is the assured voice of
[25:11] the lord
[25:13] how any people can be so spiritually
[25:15] wicked is more than i know
[25:17] but they produce according to the seed
[25:18] which is in them
[25:20] and we know where that seed came from
[25:22] don't we
[25:24] the laodicean church is saying
[25:26] i am rich and increased with goods and
[25:28] have need of nothing
[25:30] that was her self estimate
[25:32] she looked at herself and that is what
[25:33] she saw
[25:35] she said i am rich
[25:37] which means that she is wealthy in the
[25:39] things of this world
[25:40] she is boasting in the face of james 2
[25:43] 5-7
[25:44] hearken my beloved brethren hath not god
[25:47] chosen the poor of this world rich in
[25:49] faith and heirs of the kingdom which he
[25:51] hath promised to them that love him
[25:54] but ye have despised the poor
[25:56] do not rich men oppress you and draw you
[25:58] before the judgment seats
[26:00] do they not blaspheme that worthy name
[26:02] by the which ye are called
[26:05] now i do not suggest that a rich person
[26:07] cannot be spiritual
[26:09] but we all know that the word says very
[26:11] few are
[26:12] it is the poor that predominate in the
[26:14] body of the true church
[26:16] now then if the church becomes full of
[26:18] wealth
[26:19] we know only one thing
[26:21] ichabod has been written over her
[26:22] portals you can't deny that for that is
[26:25] the word
[26:27] talk about wealth in the church
[26:30] why there never has been such a show of
[26:32] wealth
[26:33] the beautiful sanctuaries are multiplied
[26:35] in number as never before
[26:37] the various groups buy with each other
[26:38] to see who can build the biggest and the
[26:40] loveliest
[26:42] and they build education centers worth
[26:44] unestimated millions and those buildings
[26:46] are used only an hour or two a week
[26:49] now that would not be such a terrible
[26:51] thing but they expect this little time
[26:53] spent by the children in the education
[26:55] plant to take the place of the hours of
[26:57] training supposed to be given in the
[26:59] home
[27:00] money has poured into the church until
[27:02] different denominations own stocks and
[27:04] bonds factories oil wells and insurance
[27:07] companies
[27:08] they have poured money into welfare and
[27:10] retirement funds
[27:12] now this sounds good
[27:13] but it has become a snare to the
[27:15] ministers for if they decide to leave
[27:17] their group for more light or the love
[27:19] of god their pensions are lost to them
[27:22] most can't stand this and stay with
[27:24] their pressure groups
[27:26] now don't forget that this is the last
[27:28] age
[27:29] we know that this is the last age
[27:31] because israel has gone back to
[27:32] palestine
[27:34] if we believe that he really is coming
[27:36] then there must be something wrong with
[27:38] those who are building so vastly
[27:40] it makes one think that these people
[27:42] plan on staying here forever or that the
[27:44] coming of jesus is hundreds of years old
[27:48] do you know that religion today is known
[27:50] as big business
[27:52] it is an absolute fact that they are
[27:53] placing business managers in the
[27:55] churches to take care of finances
[27:57] is this what god desires
[27:59] did not his word teach us in the book of
[28:01] acts
[28:02] that seven men full of the holy ghost
[28:04] and faith serve the lord in business
[28:06] matters
[28:07] you can surely see why god said
[28:10] you say you are wealthy
[28:12] i never said so
[28:14] there are radio programs television
[28:17] programs and numerous church endeavors
[28:19] that are costing millions and millions
[28:20] of dollars
[28:22] wealth pours and pours into the church
[28:24] the membership increases along with the
[28:26] money yet the work is not being done as
[28:28] it was done when there was no money but
[28:31] men rested solely on the ability given
[28:33] them by the holy ghost
[28:35] there are paid preachers paid assistance
[28:38] paid ministers of music and education
[28:40] paid choirs paid custodians programs and
[28:43] entertainment
[28:45] all costing great sums
[28:47] but for all that the power is decreasing
[28:50] yes the church is rich but the power is
[28:52] not there
[28:53] god moves by his spirit not by the
[28:55] amount of money or talent in the church
[28:59] now i want to show you how diabolical
[29:01] this urge for money has become
[29:03] the churches have gone all out to get a
[29:05] membership especially of the wealthy
[29:08] everywhere there is the cry to make
[29:10] religion so attractive and appealing
[29:12] that the rich and cultured and all who
[29:14] have worldly prestige will come in and
[29:16] be active in the church
[29:18] can't they understand that if wealth is
[29:20] the criterion of spirituality then the
[29:22] world already has god has all of god and
[29:25] the church has nothing
[29:28] thou sayest i am increased with goods
[29:31] this literally means i have spiritual
[29:33] riches
[29:34] this sounds like the millennium with
[29:36] streets of gold and the presence of god
[29:38] but i wonder if this is so
[29:41] is the church truly rich in the
[29:42] spiritual things of god
[29:45] let us examine this 20th century
[29:46] laodicean boast in the light of the word
[29:50] if the church were truly spiritually
[29:52] rich its influence would be felt upon
[29:54] community life
[29:56] but exactly what kind of lives are these
[29:58] so-called spiritual and influential men
[30:00] of the community living
[30:02] out in suburbia out in the better class
[30:05] districts there are bounds wife swapping
[30:07] prostitution and bands of children
[30:10] crashing parties exacting a terrible
[30:12] toll in property damage
[30:14] immorality has reached an all-time high
[30:17] in promiscuous sex acts narcotic
[30:19] addiction
[30:20] gambling stealing and all kinds of evil
[30:24] and the church goes on claiming how fine
[30:26] is this generation how full are the
[30:28] churches and how responsive are even the
[30:30] natives on the mission fields
[30:33] the church has turned the people over to
[30:35] the doctors especially the psychiatrists
[30:38] how it can prayed about being rich
[30:40] spiritually is more than i know
[30:42] it isn't true
[30:43] they are bankrupt and don't know it
[30:46] take a good look around you
[30:48] examine the people as they walk by
[30:50] in the multitudes you see
[30:52] can you pick out those that have the
[30:53] appearance of christians
[30:55] watch how they dress
[30:57] watch how they act hear what they say
[30:59] see where they go
[31:01] surely there ought to be some real
[31:02] evidence of the new birth amongst all
[31:04] those we see go by
[31:06] but few there be
[31:08] yet today the fundamental churches are
[31:10] telling us they have millions saved and
[31:12] even spirit-filled
[31:14] spirit-filled
[31:15] can you call women spirit-filled who go
[31:17] around with frizzy bobbed hair shorts
[31:20] and slacks halters and briefs all
[31:22] painted up like jezebel
[31:24] if these are adorned in modest apparel
[31:26] as becometh christian women i would hate
[31:28] to think what it would be like if i had
[31:30] to witness a display of immodesty
[31:32] now i know that the women don't set the
[31:34] styles hollywood does that
[31:37] but listen ladies they still sell yard
[31:39] goods and sewing machines
[31:41] you don't have to buy what's in the
[31:43] stores and then use that as an excuse
[31:45] this is a deadly serious matter that i
[31:47] am going into
[31:49] have you not read in scripture that when
[31:51] a man looks on a woman and lusts after
[31:53] her in his heart he has already
[31:55] committed adultery with her in his heart
[31:58] and suppose you dressed in such a way as
[31:59] to cause that
[32:01] that makes you his partner in sin even
[32:04] though you would be absolutely unaware
[32:05] of it being a true virgin with no such
[32:07] desires
[32:09] yet god holds you accountable and you
[32:11] will be judged
[32:14] now i know you ladies don't like this
[32:15] kind of preaching
[32:17] but sister you are dead wrong in what
[32:19] you are doing
[32:20] the bible forbids you to cut your hair
[32:22] god gave it for a covering
[32:24] he gave a command for you to wear it
[32:26] long it is your glory
[32:28] when you cut your hair you signify that
[32:30] you left the headship of your husband
[32:33] like eve you walked out and went on your
[32:35] own
[32:36] you got to vote you took man's jobs you
[32:39] left off being females
[32:41] you ought to repent and come back to god
[32:44] and if all this wasn't bad enough a
[32:46] whole lot of you took the idea that you
[32:48] could invade the pulpits and the church
[32:50] offices that god reserved for men and
[32:52] for men only
[32:53] oh i touched a sore spot then didn't i
[32:56] well show me one place in the bible that
[32:59] god ever ordained any woman to preach or
[33:01] take authority over a man
[33:03] and i will apologize for what i have
[33:05] said
[33:06] you can't find that i am wrong
[33:08] i am right for i stand with the word and
[33:11] in the word
[33:12] if you were spiritually rich you would
[33:14] know that is true
[33:16] there is nothing true but the word
[33:18] paul said
[33:20] i suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[33:22] usurp authority over the man
[33:24] you can't possibly take a place amongst
[33:26] the five-fold ministry of ephesians four
[33:29] and not take authority over men
[33:32] sister you had better listen to that
[33:33] word
[33:34] it was not the spirit of god manifesting
[33:36] in a spirit-filled life that told you to
[33:38] preach because the spirit and the word
[33:40] are one
[33:42] they say the same thing
[33:44] somebody made a mistake
[33:46] somebody was fooled
[33:48] wake up before it is too late
[33:50] satan fooled eve your mother he is
[33:52] fooling the daughters now
[33:54] may god help you
[33:57] i have need of nothing
[33:59] now when anybody says
[34:01] i have need of nothing
[34:03] he could very well be saying i have
[34:05] everything
[34:06] or he could be saying
[34:08] i don't want any more as i am full now
[34:11] you can express this any way you want
[34:13] and it all adds up to the fact that the
[34:15] church is complacent
[34:17] she is satisfied with what she has
[34:19] she either figures she has it all or has
[34:21] enough
[34:22] and that is exactly what we find today
[34:26] what denomination is not claiming that
[34:28] it has the revelation and the power and
[34:30] the truth
[34:31] listen to the baptists and they have it
[34:33] all
[34:34] listen to the methodists and they have
[34:36] it all
[34:37] listen to the church of christ and
[34:38] everyone is wrong but them
[34:40] hear what the pentecostals say and they
[34:42] have the fullness of the fullness
[34:45] now they know i am telling the truth
[34:47] about them for not one of their manuals
[34:49] say any different
[34:50] they wrote it all out just so nice and
[34:52] put their names to it and finished it
[34:54] all up
[34:55] god just doesn't have any more
[34:58] and there are those who just don't want
[34:59] anymore
[35:01] they do not believe in healing and would
[35:02] not want it although it is in the word
[35:05] there are those who would not take the
[35:07] holy spirit if god opened the heavens
[35:08] and showed them a sign
[35:11] now they are all saying and trying to
[35:13] prove that they have it all or they have
[35:15] enough
[35:16] yet is that the truth
[35:18] compare this 20th century church to the
[35:20] first century church
[35:22] go ahead do that
[35:24] where is the power where is the love
[35:27] where is the purified church that
[35:29] withstood sin and walked with faith
[35:31] toward jesus
[35:32] where is the unity
[35:34] you can't find it
[35:36] if this church has all it needs
[35:38] why were they crying out for more of god
[35:40] in the book of acts as though they
[35:41] didn't have it all
[35:43] and yet they had far more than they have
[35:45] today
[35:48] god's diagnosis
[35:51] now what god saw wasn't
[35:55] [Music]
[36:34] you
