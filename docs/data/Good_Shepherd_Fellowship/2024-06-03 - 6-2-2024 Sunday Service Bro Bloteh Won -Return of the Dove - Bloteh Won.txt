name we pray amen amen amen amen thank you thank you for bearing with us this morning the Lord bless you let's turn to the scripture uh Genesis chapter 8 on the wings of a snow white D amen I could have name uh tied to my suon like that this morning but I want to speak on the return of the dove amen I want to speak on the return of the dove because I believe the dove have returned praise the Lord Genesis chapter 8 let's read Genesis chapter 8 and God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattles that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over the earth and the water as s The Fountains also of the deep and uh the windows of Heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained and the water returned from off the Earth continuously and after the end of the 15 days the water were bited and the Ark rested in the seventh month on the 17th day of the month upon the mountains of Herrera and the water decreased continuously until the 10th month in the 10th month on the first day of the month were were the tops of the mountain seing and it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the Ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and forth until the waters were dry up from off the Earth which mean the Raven was not seen also he sent forth a do from came to see if the water were AED from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the sword of her feet and she returned onto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the Earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pull her in unto him into the AR the Lord bless you have your seat we continue to read and he stay yet another seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the Ark and the Dove came in to him in the evening and Lord in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so Noah knew that the water were B of I mean B from off the Earth and he stay yet another seventh day and sent forth the DF which return not again unto him anymore and it came to pass in the 600 and first year in the first month the first day of the month the water would dry up from of the earth and Noah remove the cover of the Ark and lo and behold the face of the ground was dry and in the second month on the seven and 20th day of the month was the earth dry praise the Lord St John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 s John chapter 1 s John chapter 1 let's read from verse 29 in John chapter 1 let's read from verse 29 and next day John SE Jesus coming unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore um I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit Discerning from heaven like a d and it and it upon Him amen praise the Lord and John B record saying I saw the Spirit Discerning from heaven like a do and it bought upon Him Praise the Lord amen when Noah do went out the first time the Bible say it found no resting place so it came back praise the Lord he sent it out again he got an olive leaf he brought it to no to Noah to the ark praise the Lord and when it went out again it never returned praise the Lord why because there was no resting place until this time there was no resting place until this time when John said Behold the Lamb of God hallah that takes away the sin of the word then the do found a resting place and he came down and rested on him so the dove has [Laughter] returned praise the Lord let's bow our heads in pray I finish preaching can you believe that will you believe that praise the Lord you have already pulled everything out of me I don't know I'm just going to be standing up here you got to be praying for me because I don't know how I jump ahead of myself and I you know I let I let the cat out of the bed you love the Lord this morning I sure I sure you do amen sure you do we we just thank the Lord for for giving us privilege to be together this morning I want to share some few things with you before we get into what uh we want to talk about this morning the return of the dove amen I want to talk about the return of the dove so when you look actually look into uh uh you look in uh uh what am I saying the Genesis chapter 8 there are few things I want us to look at before we go into our subject this morning uh praise the Lord trying to look at my now so when you look into Genesis chapter 8 if we just want to drop back there there there there are there are there are few things that is lying there that is very profitable for us and uh uh you will see that uh uh it is not just an event but it holds prophecy amen Genesis chapter 8 holds prophecy because when you look at the events in Genesis chapter 8 I thought I had all of mine you realize there at the rain a rain 40 days and that's that's what we know 40 days and night not just rain The Fountains of the deep also gives out their water you know the Bible stated there the water Prevail over the Earth for 150 50 days and uh uh they were in the ACT uh for 300 and uh uh 77 days 5 months floating 7 and a half months on the Mountain uh I'm just trying to run through some of my my notes here as I was uh uh there was only one AR praise the Lord there was only one Ark that could get to safety praise the Lord there is no doubt there are many they try to build their Ark amen I I I I will first say sister Carrie you give us the copy of that song okay he give us the copy of that song We Will would like to sing it amen praise the Lord uh uh I mean uh uh it will be easy for us to sing I'm a new creation I'm a fool for Christ that should be easy amen praise the Lord I'm a fool for Christ because I'm a new creation amen so uh when it's used open that's how we read the Bible so there was only one AR and there was one door to that Ark praise the Lord one of the mysterious thing thatth we notice in the ACT there was no birth there was no death praise the Lord so there was a kind of a supernatural presence that were keeping all of those wi Beast together no fces let me mention that also there was no fces lion was not eating gold nothing praise the Lord and no matter what you believe no matter what you believe and how much you are convinced of what you believe all argument ended when the doors were shut you knew you were right or you were wrong right no matter what you believe how strong you head to your conviction when the doors were closed all argument ended praise the lord we can argue now because the door is not closed there were three groups of people there were doors that were removed proud to the flaw Enoch he was removed from the earth before the flaw there were those that were preserved through the the flood and those that perish in the flood praise the Lord there were those that were removed before the floor those that were preserved in the Flor and those that perish and uh uh now so when you look here what what what actually that make me to be going in all of this thing is somewhere I want to bring you here in uh uh Genesis chapter 8 please excuse me as I take this quote from on me and what I wanted to bring us to here is uh uh this place where the Bible talks about the arc verse four the AR rested in the seventh month on the 7th day of the month that is very prophetic there's a reason why there's a reason why you will realize that in the Bible not every even is recorded like this event is recorded year amen if the Bible record the event the AR rested on the seventh month the you know uh uh on the 17th day of the month it it is God's way it's just like when Jesus said verily verily I say unto you amen it means pay attention that's what he's saying praise the lord and there are a lot of ways in the Bible God call us to pay attention in the book of uh a Psalm David would say s okay pause pay attention and uh uh there's another place also you will find that in the book of proverb and you will also find it in the Book of Amos the Bible which says there are six things the Lord hit yet seven is an Abomination praise the Lord the reason why that that is just uh it's a way of him trying to get our attention praise the Lord amen in the Book of Amos for for for for four AB for three iniquity we I judge the B for four so right here the Bible is trying to grab our attention and what is interesting about this is that uh uh it will set us into what we want to talk about this morning Israel had two canders there were two candar C that the Jewish people have one of their calandar was the Civil calendar and the Civil calandar was the cander that ran from Genesis amen because you have to realize in exodor God told them this will become the beginning of months for you when when the when the lamb was slain in the month of ABBA that is the religious calendar so you see it it did not do away with the Civil calendar if it did God would not recall this even because the seven the seventh month the the the 17 day of the month will not immediately turn to the month of ABBA are we together praise the Lord it will n immediately so there is a civil calendar and there is a religious calendar on the religious calendar the first month of the year is the month of arba when the Passover was was killed amen they remember their exitor they remember coming out of Egypt but for other events civil events going back to the time of the Covenant of Abraham they had to remember that also so they keep all of that under the saor calendar so there were two calandar praise the Lord amen so uh uh if uh if the if the if the the uh the tech my people there will put up my my little slide that I sent them this will help us to see you praise the Lord so uh teaching is the first calendar is is is the first month of the first calendar is the first month of the Civil calendar amen okay I knew I was using this I didn't bring my M that's fine so you see the months are the same but there is a different Arrangement here the different Arrangement shows the two Canda like I said the saver and the religious are we together amen so the seventh month that is record the year I call in to Noah report will turn out to be the first first month of the new calendar thank you God bless you praise the Lord okay okay thank you so it would turn out to be the first month of the new calendar yeah and you uh there was something I was supposed to give you also that will have made this whole thing easy for us and I they didn't send it that's fine that's fine praise the Lord are we together now so I calling to to uh uh Genesis account here the ACT rested on the seventh month which becomes the month of the old calendar amen and on the seventh day the the the 17th day of uh that seven month which is the month of ABBA now what is hidden in here is that you have to realize that according to what Moses told them the the lamb has to be observed OB erve there was a time where the lamb was taken and the lamb has to be observed before it was crucified are we together so if you look at in the prophetic calendar which is the religious calendar that have to do with the the the crucification of the lamb and and which of course it tpes the Passover you will realize that the crucification took place uh uh the 14th day of Nissan amen it took place on the 14th day of Nissan and if the crucification took place on the 14th day of Nissan Jesus resurrected how many days after three so it turned out to be 17 so Noah AR rested in the very same calculation to the death burier and resurrection of Jesus Christ are you see in the picture so you see uh uh uh it was it's almost like God's new beginning is our new beginning because our new beginning is on the resurrection praise the Lord so that the date is not just put here just to fill him it's put here because it's prophetic are you seeing the picture and uh uh uh there there's a whole lot I could I could bring here but it will throw me off completely but and and so that's that's that just one of the major thing I wanted for us to see here even though we we want to talk about the the the return of the dove now you will see you can take this entire chapter here with every everything that we have we have shown you uh how the the the the Resurrection comes right in here the very day the ACT rested and you you have to realize uh that uh the whole thing about God's work and everything he's doing is all about bringing us to rest are we together the resurrection is all about rest the Christian faith is all about rest that's all the gospel that's the hope of the Gospel is to give us rest in this life to prepare us for an internal rest are we together so you can you we can take this whole thing and place it right in St John chapter 3 I could throw it in St John chapter 3 this morning looking at the time and uh but it's it's it's just going to throw throw us right into into uh uh another another thing but just like I said we read a little bit of St John chapter 3 on uh on Wednesday night let's let's go to St John chapter 3 let me let's let's just see here I'm trying to get you to a place this morning before I preach amen trying to get us to a place this morning by the grace of God It's Already Done praise the lord we are walking in a finished work there is nothing that God is expecting of us than to believe his word and walk in it praise the Lord he's not expecting our works there is nothing we can do to add to what he has already done is a finished work the grace that we need is to believe what is done and step in it praise the lord it's it's like that man that built the bridge there the Australia bridge if I'm right and uh uh uh you know then he buildt the bridge you know in s wide you know across uh and and uh you know he brought everybody he says you know I I you know I believe that uh we can carry the Wheel bar and he told the Wheel bar on top of it he says I can drive a car on it he says uh uh he says everybody look at him he drove across and then he came back everybody clapped their hand W he says now we will get inside let's go across it's easy for us to stand a fire and say oh in the days of Noah I would get in the ark if I were in the days of Danel We Will We Will stum Nebuchadnezzar this is your day this is your day that's just all it is if you believe that the breach is done get in the car if you believe the work of the man that have constructed the bridge he's not telling you go I will stand in you he has gone he came back he said come sit down beside me that this is what all this is about it's not about you standing on an ey Lane it's not about your personal faith your personal work no this is about what he have done if we believe it let's identify ourself with faith let's step into it St John chapter 3 praise the Lord I'll surely tell you this morning I'm not responsible for this somebody might have prayed last night somebody came on expectation this morning so I'm not responsible for this St John chapter three we commented a little bit on that on Wednesday night and then God came in a special way man I was sitting down right there and I was just saying oh wow he's a god of Monday he's a god of Tuesday he's a god of Wednesday night I mean to have a prayer line on the Wednesday night service man there was such a presence in this place praise the Lord amen and praise the Lord and you know uh we just thank the Lord for that praise the Lord and uh we we have this very familiar uh a chapter year and uh there's there's one of the place in Jesus entire Ministry where he preached Doctrine Jesus never preached Doctrine when he were out to the to the the publicans and the Sinners he did not preach Doctrine he just told him about the love of God praise the Lord the first time and ever time he would preach Doctrine is to talk to a clergy he was talking to a teacher of the Lord We Don't Preach Doctrine when we go in the streets we must tell people about the love of Jesus praise the Lord so the first time Jesus will preach Doctrine in John chapter 3 verse three he will says verily verily I said unto you pay attention be Focus except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God th word Born Again mess the mind of Nicodemus when he hear that his mind was so messed up he said he say what do you mean I should go back in my mother's womb praise the Lord and and and and that's what the church has done all Through the Ages each group has interpreted being born again how to go back and be identified with their system we have catechism class that came from the Catholic and every church denomination form their own baptism class and and Confirmation class and uh uh h a fifth disciple class and uh uh uh uh uh there with the with the Baptist you know I was on the Baptist Mission they do they do the Royal ambassadors you know uh special class so you can be born again to bring you through it's just going back to all the womm of systems because because the way that the church honors them born again is that you have to conform to the church system you got to learn the address code you got to learn the way to talk and and all of that then you are born again Jesus said said to him I'm talking about entering mother's womb he said except a man being born of the water than the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God I have to hurry up with this and uh uh that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit he says Marvel not that I said unto you you must be born again hallelujah amen so like like we said on uh on Wednesday night Jesus Nicodemus said verse 9 how can these things be and Jesus said thou a master of Israel and knoweth not these things verily I said unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness if I have told you eely things and you believe now how shall how shall you believe if I tell you Heavenly things no man have ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven now so Jesus is explaining what the new birth is the whole thing about the New Birth is right there in that verse 13 praise the Lord amen that's that's what the new birth is the new birth makes you uh uh uh uh Angelic Association the new birth makes you a doer creature amen it makes you a doer creature the church interprets the new birth in a sense where we with things that uh you know uh uh uh is going to strip us of all of our Earthly you know uh uh uh character no the new birth comes and only destroy the desire of sin it kills the desire of sin but there you have your you have your your your your him tendency the new birth was stripping us of everything our children will not resemble us so those traits go so that's what Jesus said year that's what it means you know uh uh uh uh the son of man uh uh which is in heaven why he stay on Earth that's why we can say we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now see where now St John chapter 3 goes back in tie with Genesis chapter 8 the next verse G Jesus will say to Nicodemus as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness praise the Lord the ark rested upon the mountain so it was lifted up as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up praise the Lord amen thou will also blow the mind of nicod demons because from the time that Moses did that in the wilderness Israel really never understood what it meant they never knew what it was for when Moses built a Brazen Serpent and put the serpent on the pole and told the people that if they look at the serpent you know they would be healed from the snake bite they really did not understand what it was praise the Lord so all through their Journey Israel has impersonated to have a Brazen serpent you see when we don't understand why G why God God gave us something we make an idol out of it praise the Lord and when we don't understand why God gave us something why God will use certain thing if we don't understand it we will make an idol out of Faith the only reason why God gave them that it was a prophecy of what would happen on Calvary praise the Lord the only reason why God gave them that is because that was the same thing he did when MOS when Noah and his people came to the end of the flood he raised the ark upon the mountain are we together amen so you will see down Through the Ages Israel actually make an idol out of the Brazen serpent until the time of Hezekiah Hezekiah had to burn it because the people now make adul they were going there and offering sacrifice to the to to the Brazen serpent every time they would they would make uh you know brass and build another Serpent and go and offer they make an idol out of it when it was just what God gave them for that season to be able to point them to a reality praise the Lord amen God gave Pentecost speaking in tongues on the date of Pentecost they make an idol out of faith if you don't speak in tongue you don't have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord hallelujah God sent us a prophet to bring us the the reveal word we want to make an idol out of him no he it was just a purpose it was a vehicle to lead us somewhere glory be to God you will see why it was important that God never never never h uh uh h h h uh the the the angel M has to come and even pick up the body of Moses because of what he meant to Israel they will have worshiped his body if Moses had appointed grave they will have make an idol out of it praise the Lord the desire that God put in man to worship if a man don't find the truth God he will worship this iron why because there is something in him to worship if he don't meet the trueu God he will worship His Shoes if he don't meet the true God he will worship whatever he can worship because it's in him to worship are we together the the do has returned let's get back to our subject let's get back to our subject this uh this morning I hope not to keep you long but uh uh this this thought came to meaning and it was uh really bless my heart I was listening to the church and this condition and uh uh then it really blessed me to realize that the do is sent to condition the people without the church the the without the do the church is in the bad condition amen you understand that as we go along this morning praise the Lord hallelujah but just like we read and I said uh uh uh we we we we we see that the at the of the flood God sent uh Noah sent out a raven and and it's you know it's never testified what happened to it it just went and it went all all over the place and and uh you know we've been taught and I've heard different you know uh uh uh the dove couldn't do that because the dove don't have what it takes to be able to digest you know uh uh dead food they don't have it amen The Raven can so the Raven was having the Revival you know picking the picking the eyes of all of those people that were mocking Noah amen you know picking their eyes from on the ground and don't mean to make it ugly to you but that's exactly what it is hallelujah glory be to God and uh uh uh but the dove was sent out and it's it's an important thing to remember as we want to emphasize this morning because it found no resting place praise the Lord amen because it find no resting place so a return praise the Lord the return of the do is always a sign of rest amen the return of the doth is always a sign of rest glory be to God so the dove returned returned to to to Noah and and then they went out again they brought an olive leave a sign you know that uh that that the land has been dried and and and then suddenly the do went away praise the Lord and the scripture gave us no account of of what happened but you see God don't keep us in the dark praise the Lord he don't keep us in the de that's that is the thing that we have to understand about the the pattern of God's word if you keep rest and Dove together you will see it all through the scripture you'll realize that the dove just did not you know it did not just vanish you realize that the love had a significance it was placed there for the type are we together now so uh uh uh the dove went and then we know all through the Old Testament you know the dove was used for the sacrifice of of the poor people were told to bring lamb for sacrifice but if a person was was of you know a low status uh middle class or below middle class and and uh uh they offer tood dos for sacrifice so that was used all over now this will also give us a picture you go there in Luke Chapter 2 you will see that Jesus on the day that he will be dedicated because of the the the the humble way that God came Among Us Mary and Joseph could not even afford a lamb they are coming to to to dedicate their son this will be the king of the word of God the universe god of the universe but yet they could not afford a lamb they had to bring two tood dos praise the Lord amen now uh uh uh what I mean uh you you you can look at it both ways he never needed a lamb because he was the lamb the lamb needed a do so he had to bring Dove praise the Lord amen so all through the scripture you see God but if you just keep setting things in context then you grab the picture of what God is doing praise the Lord Jesus will be dedicated as a baby and now not much will be said about him until the time of the Passover when he will come at age 12 and testified I must be about my father's business not much will be said about him again until one day John on the River Jordan glory be to God hallelujah John on the River Jordan that uh H H John he was he was on the on the the the the spirit of Elijah oh I just love how the Bible is beautiful he was under the spirit because the Bible says he will be born under the power and the spirit of Elijah glory be to God and you have to realize that one day Elijah stood by that very SE River Jordan where John was standing and he smacked the river and a parted in two praise the Lord and he went across the river and he took his flight amen he claimed up Jacob L and went right up into heaven and then when Elijah was coming back he came right back to that same River Jordan River Jordan have a significance to the exitor you have to remember in in in in in in in in in in the Book of Joshua when uh when when when when when uh uh Joshua brought the people down to the river Jordan he did the same thing that Elijah did he might have he he have not said it openly to say where is the god of of Moses but he instructed the priest to go right into the into the middle of uh of of the Jordan and the Bible says when the priest got right there the water parted he experienced the same thing of the Red Sea but Moses what he would do I mean Joshua what he would do he would tell the priests uh that they should take H H uh 12 Stones and they should build an altar in the middle of Jordan they should put those 12 Stones together and build an altar praise the Lord Hallelujah and uh uh when they get across Jordan they should build another altar of 12 Stones so there were two set of 12 Stones are we together now the one outside of the river could be destroyed but the one inside of the river for you to destroy it you got to part the water are we together amen you see that's the same thing that Jeremiah did when he bought the land he had to take one of the deal and put it in an effting vessel bury the Earth and and and keep it there then he had another deal the one he had could be destroyed but the one that was in the earth that's where we take our Cornerstone putting Cornerstone on your land because you could lost your deal but when you have a Cornerstone that is planted is stand as a testimony so the rocks in the middle of the river could never be destroyed you had to part the water are we together glory be to God so so you you you can you can you can see why when Elijah came on my camel he had to rebuild the altar of 12 Stones why because the altar that was built in the time of Joshua of 12 Stones on the land was destroyed so Elijah being the prophet of restoration he had to build rebuild the 12 Stones and it was on that 12 Stones that God sent down fire and consumed the sacrifice praise the Lord that was one testimony but before he leave he got to take El as to see the other testimony of the 12 Stones that was in the middle of Jordan that's the significance of why he parted the river because it's an Evidence that's what the Holy Ghost is all about that's what the return of the do is all about because this gospel is not a historical gospel for us to just tell you about Jesus of Nazareth and and and and blind BOS and and and and and the man at the bed this is a present tense gospel praise the lord we can point to you in the word and show you everything our lord Jesus said in the word but we can also tell you that he is the same yesterday today and forever that the very La that we are reading of in this Bible I believe we without doubt this morning that he's right here in this building praise the Lord so John is standing right by that same River Jordan but this time he's not going to point the people to a stone in the river he's going to point the people to the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word praise the Lord Hallelujah couple of weeks ago we talk about the kind of a high life that John had her parents were old Zacharias and Elizabeth they were old and you have to believe realize that because they believe the message of their day for Zacharias at the birth of John to step had to testify to those people that an angel met me in in the in the in the in the temple while I was blowing incense and the angel said I'm Gabriel it's easy for them to connect his testimony to to Mery testimony he said wow he's part of the CT that's the same thing mared is saying an angel met him met her praise the Lord so Zacharias lost his job he lost his jaw why because now he has believed in a CT he's now saying the same thing that mered is saying she met an angel and young John will grow in a house as a little boy where he will see that all his father has labor for he's now kicked out of the system he's evil spoken up as a little child his dad will die because zachar was already old and John and his mother and just a little group of people will be there to witness his father funeral praise the Lord religion can be Wicked religion can be Wicked praise the Lord amen if you don't get Jesus Christ and you just only hold to religion it can be Wicked praise the Lord when religious people decide to hold to their beliefs you will never believe that these are the same people you sat in church with these are the same people that said they believe the message praise the Lord because of that rejection young John will find his way to the Wilderness at a young age praise the Lord at a young age he will find himself to the Wilderness the Bible says he's eating on on on on on white grapes because his parents died why he was still small and because of all the rejection that the church has shown him that's the reason why he couldn't go he he was he was the first born of Zacharias if the system was nice to him he would have been in the high priest's house praise the Lord that's what that's what David did David took uh mhib because he was a son of Jonathan David knew that this boy he must be treated with royalty praise the Lord he was supposed to be in cai's house growing under the system because he he's he's he's in the langage of a priest but the very system that his father Ser all of life turn against him why because they will not believe what God was doing in their day they will not believe the visitation of an Angel they would rather hold to their system and their dogma and this little innocent boy will suffer all of this rejection and he will find himself in the wilderness fing for himself and God will use that tough upbringing God will use that's why when John came out of the Wilderness he cared for nobody he could stand right in the face of Hera and tell him you don't have to take your brother's wife he was ready to die he didn't care for anybody he turned to the religious system he blasted them praise the Lord sometimes God has to use tough toughness to bring out the man of the age when God has to work for the man sometime he used toughness praise the Lord John was a Fearless preacher the Roman soldiers come and they stand and say they ask him question he says you people are just robbing the people you are just taking money from people he did not he was Fearless with the spirit of Elijah on him glory be to God but John will tell us that while he was in the wilderness he had a vision and the Lord spoke to him and said the one that you will see the spirit Discerning on in the form of a do that is the one that you have come to prepare the way for John came on the uh on the Jordan and preached many days he blasted the soldiers he blasted the governor he blasted the priests they came and asked him who are you are you Elijah he said I'm a voice of one crying in the wilderness preparing the word of the Lord glory be to God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah and this service Jesus will come walking right to John and their spirit will connect and John will have an in a feeling and and and and an Administration going in his heart that this is the one he will keep his eyes close on Jesus and he will walk right to him he says suffer it to be so praise the Lord he told John suffer it to be so and John will baptize him and as Jesus will go out of the river Jordan John will be keeping his eyes on him and he will break into a vision praise the Lord the same thing he saw in the wilderness he will see the spirit of God descending as a DF praise the Lord the do that was used in Shadow and type all through the Old Testament is now returning to dwell in a person praise the lord we will not need a t do anym for sacrifice because the do has embraced the lamb Heaven and Earth has Embrace when the do came on the Lamb of God when when John saw that when he saw the vision he cried out Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sin of the word he was trying to say all the Old Testament prophecy is wrapped up in this man everything that was done in Shadows and tipes the Wasing of hands the Wasing of feet is all wrapped up in this man this is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word praise the Lord Hallelujah for the first time in just a short period of time John will feel fulfill never went to school never enjoy his childhood but for the first time and a short period of time to realize that what he saw in the wilderness in the vision is fulfilling in his eyes you don't know the gratification that he brings to a preacher when the word is preached and he's seeing that word being fulfilled in the life of the people praise the Lord for the short period of time the only time in his life he will stand on the river Jo a joy mixed with sness when he think about all the things he has suffered and to realize that it was for this very moment praise the Lord amen that's that's that's the thing that's going to make Heaven sweet because when we think about all the things that we have gone through and realize that it is for this this moment it is for our Heavenly reward praise the Lord you realize that there is no way you can put the two on scale even the things we are going through must be that looks like they are unbearable but Paul called them your light Affliction that's how he called it he said they are all light Affliction because if you put the glory that awaits you is going to our away this one it's going to our way everything that you are going through but that was the first time that John would feel so fulfilled in his life oh it's a sweet feeling it's a sweet feeling praise the lord it's a sweet feeling when you when you uh uh uh when you just you just uh uh you do something and you just realized that you had just fulfilled a scripture praise the Lord such a sweet feeling a warm feeling that comes on you and he just told there the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word praise the Lord that the Bible said even some of his disciple went after Jesus it did not even bother him to him I have done my work few days after John will be arrested can you imagine that he were arrested and put in prison and he's thinking in his mind I have just introduced the mesiah said go and ask him is he really the one this man has only known sorrow in his life after when he thought that he was fulfilled let me tell you something people we have to be real we have to be real and Truth to ourself all these uh uh uh uh uh lies and and and deception that have gone with uh with the preaching of the Gospel have just have just uh deceived people they have just confused people praise the Lord amen that's what I said last week you know as we we we enjoy our brother you know as you preach uh uh walking in a supernatural you know and I mean uh you know visiting preacher comes to preach you just you allow them to have the Liberty but sometimes some things we take it we take it overboard praise the Lord he read a scripture there in in the in in the book of Hebrew talking about choosing choosing by faith when we make choices praise the Lord nobody go and choose a wife or choose a husband because the think that I'm going to choose because I want to divorce nobody go to do that praise the Lord and those are things that we we we must not we must not we must not play with we must not take a light way because you don't know what people are going through praise the Lord yes a man whose gift has has been able to keep over 12,000 people together now he's gone who knows what's going to happen to that church who knows what is going to happen it is because whatever happened in the end that we will now Define that his ministry was not good when life has put us in some better places we think that everybody should be like us that's not truth the whole world is not your backyard praise the Lord couple of months back I read a scripture to you where God in his word in his word that's what he said in the Book of Leviticus he make provision for the widows for the strangers God even make provision for the divorce it's right in the word here why because he knew that his children would go through those things he knew that people would go through that and when people go through that some will come out better praise the Lord some will come out better so sometimes we have to look at the reality of the word and don't take our life concept as the definition of the Gospel what is the gospel what actually it is the gospel the gospel is not Doctrine it's not a manner of our life what is the gospel the death burier and Resurrection anything less than that is just information it's just information the gospel must be able to bring the raising Christ real to you it must make you to experience the raising Christ that's what the gospel is about that's why Paul say I Don't Preach with enticing words of men wisdom because they are all information we can give you bunch of information put Co it's just information of what God done in this age and you can have all of those information and never have the effect of the Gospel the gospel is to make the raising Christ real to you that you can be able to get a hold of him when you are in the time of trial when you are in your dark places you can get a hold of him that's what the gospel is all about oh may God help us may God help us to bring Jesus real to the people and start giving them bunch of information the information is only good when they have meet the one you are talking about or else you were confused him that's what was happening to Nicodemus here he was confused born again at my age go back to my mother's womb too much information Jesus are we together glory be to God there are some real things in life if Jesus Ted If Jesus Ted praise the Lord some of us that are sitting here our body will be will in the coffing if Jesus started some of our young people will get married if Jesus started so we must take the fantasy all the funny funny thinking that we think in our mind it starts to look alive life as real as it is praise the Lord we've been told we not in a picnic we are on the battlefield we must fight for what is right what is right you must fight for it this age has produced bunch of lazy Christians praise the Lord Jehovah jarra the Lord will provide God put a lamb on the mountain you think it was easy for for Abraham you think it was easy for him to be told to kill his only son the son of the promise we escape out of that we just want the lamb to appear in our situation praise the Lord yes a young woman being a young woman being a teenage girl as every teenage girl will love to hang with their friends and everything they would do and Jeff will go and made a promise to the Lord Lord if you give me this this battle the first thing that come out of my house I will give it to you he was not even thinking that the only thing he has there was a young Lord and when he claim up the hill it was the first thing that came out of his house praise the Lord that's a real life even a father has promised to sacrifice his only daughter to give her to God because God has given him the victory you see that's how life is nothing is real until it's our time praise the Lord everything that people going through is easy it's only our own is difficult are we together may God be merciful may God give us Grace what are we talking about the return of the D let me close here if I if you can allow me to close amen if you just stop carrying me all over the place I will close praise the Lord the dove returned the dove that that that that that left the ark it went through Abraham as a type of an offering it went through Isaac it went through the patriarch as a type of an as of of an offering but now the man that fulfills everything of the Old Testament yet the do returning and John says I see the spirit of God Discerning on him like a do Hallelujah but John identified him as the Lamb of God so the Heavenly nature and the Earthly nature met Heaven and Earth Embrace because God the do will only come on a ling nature like I said keep in mind the context is rest rest and we will only have rest with God if God can be able to get us like sheep of his pasture amen the Bible says we are sheep of his pasture and when he can get us to the place where we can have a ling nature to be able to follow the instruction of the word no matter how how it is we have to believe that when God thought about it and he said it nothing is better than what God have said praise the Lord nothing is better than what God have said we can never find solution to our problem until we take God's word are we together the do lay the lamb praise the Lord that's why when when BL Baus cried and says Lord have mercy on me thou son of David he was able to get his side because the do was leading the line there was a man that was the the the the pool of beesa for 38 years and there were many others that were there but the do LED the lamb only to that one man praise the Lord and he said pick up your bag and walk glory be to God the dove was leading the lamb three and a half years are we together are you ready glory be to God what on caval read our our our our Lord was crucified and the Bible says he gave up the ghost the door flew away just to come back on the date of Pentecost praise the Lord the do came back on the DAT of Pentecost like clothing Tong and it it fell 120 men that were afraid these guys they were afraid of the sedran council they were afraid of the Roman government because it had been published in the newspaper that they stole the body of Jesus they were afraid but when the Dove came in the upper room praise the Lord hallu Peter put a soap and he could stand upon it and say men and brethren we are not afraid am amen why because the Dove came back on the day of Pentecost but watch what is going to happen Through the Ages hallelujah amen just like how it was in the ark of Noah in the ark of Noah there was lion in the ark of Noah there was an ox in the ark of Noah there was a man called Noah praise the Lord but every one of them were honor the leadership of the dwarf they were all led by the dove so when the Dove came on Pentecost the church begin at Ephesus so for the first three Church ages the DF was leading the lion why because it was the Lion's anointing on the first three Church ages are we together amen can you see why Revelation chapter 5 when the Proclamation was made who is wory to take the book What did the what what did the the other say one like the lion of the tribe of Judah amen and when Jones turned around to look at the lion he saw what he saw a larm why because why it was a lion anointing but it has a lme nature a do will not Le a lion until the lion has a do a lme [Laughter] nature that's the reason why we can come from different parts of the word come from different family come from different background Hallelujah we don't all have to look the same we don't have to dress the same all we need is the nature of the Lamb when you get a lamb in nature you can humble yourself to the word the D is going to lead you the do L the lion in The First three Church ages the fourth Church Ages was the ox the do LED those Believers to be crucify in the time of the persecution the dove LED them to give the for the gospel praise the Lord the Roman they were put uh h h h uh uh just like you have your Olympics and you have your big Stadium they will bring those Lions out and yet these poor people praise the Lord amen I have one one one uh testimony C I always play sometime in the morning and uh uh when I when I'm when I'm praying and thinking about persecuted Believers this this uh this woman she was arrested with her little baby went to prison and then uh uh they told her to deny Christ if not she and her baby would be persecuted kept in prison without food and stuff now as a mother she was thinking about her little little one and she said you know she went back to the prison garden and uh you know she she turned on her confession so when he walk out of the prison the little girl said to her mother I love that every time I listened to her in the morning she said Mama Jesus will not be happy with you she said but I did it for you she said she said but Jesus then will not be happy with us because we have just denied him praise the Lord she said Mama I promise if we go back to prais him I'm not going to cry praise the Lord so her mother went back to the praising God and said I only deny Jesus because of my baby praise the Lord but she promised me she's not going to cry so I take my Jesus back praise the Lord hallelujah why it was the do that was leading the ARX in a time of persecution it was the do leading the AR and all of those people now let me tell you if someone should BGE on us and uh and ask who all want to die for Jesus no doubt I believe in my heart this morning no doubt there are many hands that will go up praise the Lord amen you see because in a public place like this we seems to have courage because we see one another praise the Lord but you see we are not in a time I I I just I've been studying on uh uh listening and and studying on uh uh uh what What's my thought okay let me go ahead because I'm coming to get myself all makes up here now so you will realize that uh uh we were we were all you know we we we get that kind of a support but you see our our persecution the lion that have been turned on us in this day social media praise the Lord our war and our attack it's not to go in the lion them to be eating it's the destruction of our mind praise the Lord amen Satan realized there we are in the age where the great intelligence of God has come down and if he can mess the minds of the people off praise the Lord if he can just mess our mind up with all the things that is going on out there and everything that uh uh uh uh the word is is throwing on us and and uh praise the Lord if he can just get us to that place you know get us to a place of complex get us to the place of you know all the I mean the the the competition the the filthiness and everything that the internet is feeling oh my God praise the Lord amen everything that is out there that's where our battle is amen that's where our great fight is that's where our fight is so we we have our Arena our Arena arena is not public like it used to be in the time of the Romans in the time of the Dark Age your Arena could be right in your bedroom where the enemy start waging thoughts on your mind are you going to stand for the word or are you going to give into your thoughts and give into your desires praise the Lord Paul says the devil Like a Rolling lion but he's now running out in the physical praise the Lord he's creeping into our homes with all sorts of uncensor things in pretty much we realize we just we just have a form abusing the minds of our young young people and old people and and and and and and even marriage people feed your minds on all of those things it can destroy your spirit amen it create dislike in you for for your spouse that's the word that we are getting whether you like it or not this a present word this a a visual reality word that we are living in that's where we are getting to it's giving you hands free praise the Lord amen but just like it was in that day the lion L the ox or the dove led the ox amen and the dove can only lead an ox when the ox have a lamb nature in it praise the Lord so all of those people in the Dark Ages they were under the ox anointing the ox is the beding bearer the ox is the animal of sacrifice so they were under the anointing to give themsel but they couldn't do it unless the lamb nature was in them praise the Lord that's the fourth Church Age The Fifth and the sixth was the man's anointing the lamb led the man it led Luther out of Catholicism it led John West out of methodism the Lamb was leading the man the lamb gave us Great Men of the ages Char pin and and and I mean great men with great biblical intellect Andrew dos and and and and jokes and all of these men I mean you you read you read their writing you say whoa this guy they were taing into something praise the Lord that was the age that was one of the ages where great Christian literature was written under the man's anointing all the things we have written today they are all Prosperity Gospel all motivational speakers but I'm telling you men that will Trace you in their writing they will take you from Genesis to Revelation they were not only give you ideas they give you scriptures that's the reason why before the seals were open brother Brandon went back and he was steuding those men's boooks people that spent countless hours with Lantern reading the scripture interesting to know what did the Bible says this God help me give me understanding we don't have energy for that now we don't have energy just to come through one chapter we get so tired I can't understand it you because you are not focused that's right your mind is all over the place if you can't read it put the audio Bible on play it play it Again Play it Again praise the Lord you know what will be happening that that that plane of the scripture will be fighting evil spirit for you it will be rebuking evil spirit before you realize your mind will be he concentrated oh I didn't know this was in the Bible why because Deliverance has come to you the do LED the man anointing but the do only LED them because they had a lamb nature glory be to God I have a bunch of things I could read to you this morning but you see I'm not that classic message preacher amen no I'm a man that preach under inspiration so just bear with me on the wings of a snow white do brother B will now let us know how the do will lead the eagle go instead it you'll find it there just let me preach and forget about convincing you amen that's why he talks about the do will lead the eagle that I will tell you that bothered me many years ago because in my mind I'm thinking the egole Flies where the dove can never fly how is the dove going to lead the eagle how I mean it it troubled me I'm saying to myself what is he saying the do Le the eagle but you see he's preaching on dispensation yes sir he's telling us how the anointing of the age is not a benefit to you until you get a lme nature you can get the Revelation it will just be a head knowledge the thing that makes the Revelation to live is the Lamb nature praise the Lord and that is the the church and its condition amen the church and its condition is that the church has got a bunch of people 10 million how many people there in the church we have all a different nature we want to come in with all our different backgrounds and different ideas and different arguments and and and all of that and and everybody want them to be address no that's not how God works you see when he got all of those animals in the ark he had to create an atmosphere and suppress their nature amen or else the lion will have turned on the goat the lion will have started eating the lamb he had to create an atmosphere and suppress their nature lion will look at the lamb and just laugh just like Eden he got to bring Eden back in the ark and that's what the gospel is to do it gather us and bring the spirit of Christ in our midst where we lost our identity we lost our personality all we want to be like Jesus praise the Lord the do has returned he talks about the dove that was used in the time of War Sir when they were tied a message to the do and they would fly and go and deliver pretty soon the enemy realized that it looks like this do is carrying something they started shooting everything at the do praise the Lord but that do deliver his message and I can tell you with everything that has been shooting at this message the dove has delivered this message praise the Lord they can throw everything against the message of the hour but the message has reached home praise the Lord the message has been delivered why because the dove has returned praise the Lord amen the dove has returned we don't have no right to hold to our personalities we don't have no right to come to church and go back home better we don't have no right praise the Lord the Bible says don't even let the sun go down on your anger why because the dove has returned amen if we place it in the hands
