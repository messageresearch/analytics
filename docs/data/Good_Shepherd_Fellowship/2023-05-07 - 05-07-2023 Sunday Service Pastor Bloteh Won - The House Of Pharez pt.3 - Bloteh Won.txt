okay I'm supposed to turn you on like this praise the Lord I'm supposed to okay beautiful you see smart amen we have to learn to be organized we praise the Lord I pray the Lord Make Me organize I'm very disorganized in my thoughts when I come to to these things but it's good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord and uh let's take our Bibles and then I will have you to sit down I know I have to do a little little review here because I'm trying to close up this subject we've been talking about the house of fears now this will be about a test service so let's take Romans chapter 7 Romans chapter 7 will be our our verse this morning and we know a couple of the Saints are out of system now I'm in trouble we keep her in prayer and uh and then a few of the other ones is the quiche as a husband in his prayer requests Romans chapter 7 let's let's read from Verse 18 Romans chapter 7 reading from Verse 18 and then I will have you to sit down and then I would take my time and uh and and starts to uh give you a background where we came from this talk and then try to run it up yeah read it from Verse 18 Romans chapter 7 reading from verse 18. I want every one of us to read that first phrase that that part A of Romans chapter 7 verse 18. can we read it together for I know that in me that is in my flesh do I live no good faith can we read that again for I know that in me that is in my flesh do I live no good things the Lord bless you for to will is present with me but how to perform that wish is good I found that for the good that I would do not but the evil which I will net that I do now if I do that I will not it is no more I that do it but sin that do all live in me I find then a lord that when I would do good evil is present with me for a delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another Lord in my members warring against the Lord of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member all wretched men that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I find God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with my mind I myself serve the Lord of God but with the flesh the Lord of sin let's pray together father we will humble our hearts to the truthness of your word and we need your grace Lord to come and help us Lord help us as we open the unsatchable riches of your truth please speak to our hearts Lord as we will just want to take this thought father and and uh and and kind of for round it up Lord bring it to a place of Father God and then just give your children a sense of direction father not just to read bunch of codes or to read father Lord bunch of scriptures but father God to be able to pick up what the spirit is saying to the church we commit ourselves in your hands now bless us Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you the Lord bless you you came you can have your seed so as you see there is is the house of pharaohs that's that is part three uh that is part three of their taught born of the seed incorruptible so we would we would we were taking uh two laws which of course those uh uh we will call them Lord of nature or Lord of our first birth and uh and the first law that we were thinking sorry I'll take up mine I used to have one mama you know back in church with us uh uh back 1994 95 you know she always said she said brother Wong why do you wear the coat if you will always take it off then why do you wear it says son why were you why are you wearing the code if you always take it off now so the the purpose of this of this subject that we have taken now for about three Sundays is to is to bring us to the place for us to be able to appreciate God's love his grace and his Mercy to us praise the Lord hallelujah you know even before I start this subject I know I was I'm I'm a little bit ahead of myself here and that's how I get everything spoiled but let's let's read this let's read this uh first uh code of mine did I have this one yeah and uh Iman meditation this entire week I was I was listening to 1800 preacher and uh and he says something that caught my mind and now I was I you know I was just meditating upon that so I went back and and I decided to to play this message of humble thyself and uh and brother Brandon says yeah now I believe this is truth I believe this is truth with all my heart if there was anything different that I thought was better as certainly first goal I won't ask anybody to go anywhere that ah don't go first to find out whether it is right or not I wouldn't ask any person to take a step in God that are having already made and know that it is truth praise the Lord so he's he's he's speaking on the message this was just few comments he was making brother Olivia was the one that actually preached our service that night but then he's he's taking this talk to be able to show ourselves a form of of leadership a form and and I'm reading that and in my mind I'm looking for uh how is he teaching humbleness in this how is he teaching humbled herself in this and you know Jesus in teaching the the you know one of his last message he preached to the to his church was that evening of communion he took a basin and all of these you know uh guys were looking at him talking a towel he tied around himself and he started watching the affid he came to Peter Peter said no not me you're not going to wash my feet I'm supposed to be the one doing this and Jesus said okay I'll pass by you you don't have no party man I'll do the next person he said well then just wash my whole body now because you know I need to be claimed Jesus said you don't understand what I'm doing and uh and and he he watched the disciples feet and he says you call me your lord and your master and and I've washed your feet and I want you to do the same one to another praise the Lord so Jesus in his way of life he have always learned to teach by example that is one of the most powerful way to teach it's more powerful than explaining it's more powerful than uh uh you know making the people to watch a video or making the people the one of the powerful way to to teach or to lead is by example praise the Lord and for the man or a woman to to be an example in their sense we have to you have to you have to step out of your comfort zone praise the Lord you have to step out of your comfort zone and and as I was thinking about that you know I was just thinking about what we call mystery you know people look at the creation like brother Hillary read the heavens declare the glory of God we wouldn't have known any of that of saying any of the things in the heavens until the self-existing god how to condescend he had to step out of being self-existing he had to step out of being the great internal spirit and he have to condesate humble himself praise the Lord now you see that is the reason why signs will never be able to find God praise the Lord because the one that made the universe never made a universe and stand aside to break praise the Lord when God made the universe he actually identified himself with his creation everything came out of him God did not made something that he had to go and get it from someone he brought it out of him praise the Lord and that is the same thing with the mystery of redemption Paul Paul the great Apostle says great is the mystery of God now when we hear this great is the mystery of God our mind goes to you know God Jesus Is God you know there is no three person those are just curing what is the mystery that Paul said is great God became man that's the mystery God humble himself that is the mystery the mystery is not in the theory all you know and you are explaining is just the curing but the actual mystery was the creator of Heaven and Earth became lower than angel he took the form of a man I like the way he said it in Philippines God never thought that he were robbing himself he never taught a robbery to become man praise the Lord are we together so brother Branham I said I didn't want him to do this but I started brother Brandon now is taking this and he's saying I believe that this is the truth he's actually referring to the message of the owl he says I believe that this is the truth with all of my heart if there was anything out that I taught better I settled it I won't go any word I won't ask anybody to go anywhere that I don't go first to find out whether it is right or not I wouldn't ask any person to make a step in God praise the Lord what is it was the reason of preaching water baptism in Jesus name if you are not baptized in Jesus name praise the Lord amen in God they are having already made in truth and and know that is the truth first it must be the word of the Lord then I must step and see if it is right and then if it is right I can say come come on up this way C is making a way praise the Lord Hallelujah then he says oh sorry man well he says now I think any Minister now you we can look at this from the place of ministry but you can take it from a Ministry and you can bring it to any form of leadership whether in your home whether I work any form of leadership I think any Minister ought to do that or to go first himself he's supposed to be a leader a leader of people not speaking something that he wouldn't put his hand on himself we should go and be leaders to the people praise the Lord amen now for us for me to achieve this I must humble myself praise the Lord it's hard to see it if you don't look in a constructive way praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together now so he there with the place of the leader he's saying if you will ever be a blessing to the people don't just preach mistreating preacher you know uh all of those things you must be a leader by example praise the Lord amen amen if you want to pray to preach on on faith you must also be rising in faith you must be living by faith you want to pray uh uh lead the people into an atmosphere of prayer you must be a prayer Warrior yourself amen praise the Lord and and whatever it is then he goes ahead and and then uh he brings another thing into this whole thing of humbling yourself so just just follow me and see how beautiful it is he said someone was Solomon I believe it was my brother back there telling me in the story today about a man a minister and uh one of his congregation he had to walk walk and walk he said pastor show the Lord the Lord is with you he said I can pack the log across my back when I go across say sure the Lord is with you and he went and he done it praise the Lord and he said I can park a law and then uh and and we we borrow a cross at the same time sure Pastor the Lord is with you your faith can do anything he said I can put you in a wheelbarrow and and park the Lord he said now wait a minute and praise the Lord amen amen amen now we have to we have to see this it can be a beautiful story we can read it and then we can just miss the point we can just miss what the Lord wants to teach us here yeah I better ban a few paragraphs above he had just finished instructing the ministry how to be a leader by example you cannot lead the people until you are above it's not only what you are preaching but it is also uh uh uh uh the life that the people are seeing the the Consecration and all of that then he comes also now to the people and turn the story around he says now this ministers were saying well you know I can walk across the Lord and I won't fall the people say well you can do it praise the Lord he says well I can even carry a wheel Baron across the Lord he said praise the Lord shout you can do it then he says what I can put you in a wheelbarrow and go across the Lord gases well with the meaning I'm not sure of that praise the Lord now you see what is happening here is the other uh uh is is is is is it is just like uh you see it's it's this God that is on the stand you know that has all the skill of playing the game but he's not on the field he's not wearing the Jazzy he can stay on this on the stand he can criticize you know why are you supposed to throw the ball that way man enough man that's if if I was to coach I got that guy out of the field but he's not wearing the Jazzy now so what brother Branham is trying to bring us here to the place to understand is the other uh uh uh you know you we you can stand a fight and you you can say Amen to the word you can you can say I think that was a good salmon you know and and uh really I really enjoyed the message today you know and and it was wonderful but uh for God it's it's not enough praise the Lord amen it's not just this is not just a theater where we have you to come and sit and we just here to play some comedy or make you laugh or or play your favorite joke or make your favorite statement this is a place where God have God alive for a man in his hands that he have trusted your life to the ministry praise the Lord amen so it is it is me taking you across the Lord I can force you to get in a wheelbarrow I won't force you if you believe that I can do it then step in praise the Lord amen if you believe that I can do it then stepping and with your confidence in my notability to get across the Lord and with me because I have gone there and come back praise the Lord we can make it across together are we together when you think about it and you think that brother Brandon will preach now the sales and the opening of the seals he will preach the message God is simplicity God hate and reveal in simplicity that's where the secret of God is is in humbleness that's word The Secret Of God is that's where the power of God is that's where the riches of his grace is is when we can humble our word of the Lord are we together praise the Lord now so this subject that we've been dealing with yeah uh uh is uh it's a subject that that I took and uh to be able to appreciate uh seeing how the Old Testament being the shadow of good things to come but he also held prophecies I mean they are just Rich prophecies in it and what we've been dealing with uh these two Services we've been taking these two laws they are they had to do with uh with with us as humans we every one of us honor these two laws just like Paul said in Romans chapter 8 you have to remember that the apostates in Romans chapter 8 that we have just read the Apostle Paul says I know Romans chapter 7 sorry sorry I'm sorry Romans chapter seven I have in chapter eight open before me and he says for I know that in me that is my flesh no good thing praise the Lord Paul never said in me there is no good thing praise the Lord that's not what he said I hope that's not what you read Paul never said in me there is no good thing I hope that's not what you read I hope that's not the mind that you are going out of here with Paul said in me that is my flesh there is no good thing he says in me that is to say this flesh of mine but you are not just your flesh you are more than just a flesh you have a soul praise the Lord so a poor how the mindset that you were completely condemned and nothing good can come from out of you he will not be precise to say Amy that is to say My Flesh he will have said Amy there is no good thing that is not what he said he said he mean that is to say My Flesh praise the Lord I hope that was what you read amen so Paul saying that man he's he's giving us an idea that there is a treasure here somewhere there is goodness praise the Lord amen amen you know the Bible says when God started creating everything he ended his creation by saying this was good when he made man he says it was very good praise the Lord every man that God May Under the Sun every man it's man with some goodness in foreign I've always believed that when Jesus says I will make you Fishers of Men is for you to go and fish out the good that is a man praise the Lord because many men are living with good potentials but they don't know they have it because they are just so dominated with uh with an evil or bringing and they are consumed with the elements of their flesh their anger and and on and they are lost in their drunkenness that they don't even see the good that is in them praise the Lord that's what the gospel net is for the gospel net is sent out to be able to fish in you the goodness God after all you are not just so bad glory be to God Amen after all you are not just so bad because I can see that Grace on your face you say man your smile can tell me that you are not just so bad praise the Lord amen and that's what I I was trusting the grace of God for us to do for us to be able to go out and fish together where we can go and travel and being able to see how the grace of God can be able to to bring us to the place and realize the hidden treasure just like Paul says he says he has fought Heavenly treasure in acting vessels praise the Lord now if we are Sons and Daughters of God which we are by the grace of God and we know that God from the foundation of the word he predestinated us and we know that there is a predestinated sea that was placed in our soul then no matter how much evil our flesh is consumed in us down in our soul there is something good praise the Lord some good in you God by his grace would he have brought Grace and and the message of Salvation across your path so that's what I want us to be able to stand it that's where my mind is because throughout the ages people you know uh uh uh struggle you know uh the the Holiness movement you know uh uh the the the you know when when God started during the time of the Reformation when when when Luther and the rest of them came out preaching that Josh Chalet by faith you know they were just standing on Thy word against the Catholic system praise the Lord but the grace to be able to rise above the the the the the desire of of of of habits in their life what's not there Ludo was preaching that George shall lay by faith he will stay on his pipe nothing in him was condemning him to smoke a pipe but you will see it and realize that that was the grace of God in that hour amen that was the knowledge of God but then when John Wesley came out and started preaching a message of sanctification the church had to move in a higher walk with God praise the Lord Hallelujah and then when the uh uh the the the the the the the Pentecostal Revival came in and the gates will break upon the people and uh uh God has moved the church to a life of sanctification where he can now start dealing with the people but you see what happened here is that the people started majoring on the Mana and they talk speaking in tongues as a as an Evidence of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Hallelujah now then or down through the the church ages there is there is all of these geological conflict word people says as as long as I mean you have you have you have given your heart some says you know uh uh uh we are saved by faith our confession in the Lord Jesus Christ you confess the you know that Jesus is your lord like Paul says there in Romans and he accepted in his heart you know that's that's what man can do and they stop right there praise the Lord amen hallelujah as long as he has they have confessed the Lord Jesus as their savior you know uh uh it does not bother them what what any kind of a life delay then uh uh uh another group holds to the father that I know you cannot be living in sin you know and God cleanse your life and all of that and and as a church move on in in all of those places many people came to the place and say so well you know as when if you have the Holy Ghost you are born again you know the spirit of God come upon you the nature of sin sees completely praise the Lord and you have many men even preachers they have thrown their Bible down because the law of the Lord they tried to win soul for Christ and all of that but they are never understood these two law that Paul says that war in the human body they have never understood praise the Lord they have never been able to understand it because it looks like Lord you you promise when you give me the Holy Ghost they're fired of the Holy Ghost will come down and they get excited for the Y to receive the holy boy the child the speaking don't whatever it is man after a little while to realize that the temperature power is still around praise the Lord Lord that's why I received the Holy Ghost what are these thoughts keeps coming back to my mind Lord I thought I receive the Holy Ghost who am I having these desires they have never understood the two Lords that wall in our members praise the Lord are we together and there is not and there is if there is like Paul says here I want to call the Apostle Paul very well for I know that amen that is to say My Flesh dwelleth no good things if there is nothing good that dwelling in my flesh then there is nothing of My Flesh that God wants heard me praise the Lord now there is nothing of My Flesh and there is nothing good that dwelleth in my flesh there is nothing of My Flesh what God wants is that thing that comes out of my soul yes amen are we together and then so I thought that the house of pharaohs who be what will give us a picture and we know that that prophecy came out of Ruth chapter four when Ruth gave birth to Obed who became the father of Jesse and Jesse became the father of David when she gave birth the heavens of Ezra said unto us let your house be like the house of pharaohs and we've realized that right on the deer in Luke Chapter I mean Ruth chapter four the last few verses came the generation of pharaohs and it broke 10th Generation and and he end on David so we took that as a type honor the Lord of God that says no bastard child we enter the congregation of the Lord until after 10th Generation praise the Lord amen which of course the act of Judah and tema that the Bible recalled Judah slept with his own daughter-in-law that was an abominable Act praise the Lord and then by the word of God there is there is there is uh that child was was supposed to be an adulterous and a bastard child but it was not only pharaohs that was born there was also Sarah that was born and according to the picture in Genesis chapter 38 zero was the one that came out first and the male wife put a record around his hand and said this is the first and we identified that as our first birth praise the Lord amen but then when he placed his hand back and then suddenly surprisingly to the male one Pharaoh's breakfast how did he do it how how did this try came out praise the Lord are we together so he was named pharah's main breaks forth it means overcome are we together and they'll represent our second birth praise the Lord because our our challenge every one of us here in this building no one high on the calendar when they were going to give their life to Christ who placed it on the calendar who had it on the calendar that this year this month I will give my life to cry I will start serving God praise the Lord amen amen when God met you it was a breakfast praise the Lord it was something it was something that that rerouted all your plans so the second birth dominate the first book is surprised the first birth are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord now so we we we we see there that uh out of the house of pharaohs came came the the the king of Israel David immense after God's Own Heart and Jesus said he that overcome will sit with me where in my true so without overcoming sea that is in you will become the king of your life praise the Lord thou overcoming seed that is in you that birth that came by The Incorruptible seat is born to sit on the throne of your heart it's a king seed it's a royal seed that must sit and govern your life are we together how do we get there that's why we want to travel this morning a little bit praise the Lord thank you I don't want to take brother Steve's time but Brandon will bring bring a picture here in the future home now when he preached future home he he he he he taught future home to to bring out a picture where uh uh uh he tied the the Earth God dealing with the Earth creation the picture of creation and Redemption that the same with God there with the Earth is the same way he's dealing with his children praise the Lord because we will inherit the earth glory be to God do you believe that we will inherit the earth Hallelujah do you believe that we will inherit the earth do you believe that heaven will be here on Earth [Music] praise the Lord you believe that heaven will be here on Earth that the righteous will walk on the arches of the wicked glory be to God hallelujah amen that's another subject I've just started for you foreign for you glory be to God [Music] Hallelujah the Saints under the altar they are crying how long how long and that brother Ben says Beyond revenge in the blood of the brothers that they are crying how long for they are all the things they are crying for he says they are crying because uh man was never made to be in that state that was not a feminist State that's a temporary state praise the lord we were never made to be spirit and we will never be spirit praise the Lord we were made to be humans we were not made to be angels so an invisible dwelling is not it's not your place praise the Lord so don't be here and you want to be invisible we will ever be visible right that's what I said it's another subject so right around here it's going to take us through he's going to take us through uh how God there with the Earth the first baptism or water Noah's day Jesus the blood the fire that will come and consume the Earth he's taking us through all of that we will not will not go through all of that I just have few quotes where I want to grab your attention so we can get right back to our subject that we were not we would not get lost now you have to realize now we're talking about the house of pharaohs we are talking about our predestination we are talking about uh uh uh uh uh and and also zero we we talk about Zara last last uh Sunday we saw how you know uh uh when Akon stole the Babylonian government when he stole the babylona Garment and Joshua called him out by the Holy Spirit the Bible make us to know that he came from from Judah he came his grandfather was Zera now so four generations we we counted it last week and the Bible said that God will visit the iniquity of the fathers to the fourth and the fifth generation so that iniquity that Jacob did was visited in Zera no that iniquity that brought for Zera was visited in Aiken so what the Bible set out for us to see is that econ his whole entire household was burned praise the Lord because that is what the the that is what the Holy Spirit does when when the Holy Ghost comes these were the curse and these were the curse that run down from our Parish the curse that was running down from Zara was there with in akan are we together so when the Holy Ghost deal with the curse it do not burn you it burned the nature of sea but your body Remains the Same amen your body Remains the Same these were the nature of seeing your body Remains the Same and when your body Remains the Same it do not change what Paul says here it's not now that because you have received the Holy Ghost you will come and change your scripture and say in my flesh dwell a good thing no in your flesh dwelling no good thing even though the nature of sin is dealt with amen but your body Remains the Same have I lost you somewhere are we together now you see now is the Sea of pharaohs is that Incorruptible scene now which is the word of God that starts to Spring out and all it can do is to bring your body on a suggestion amen is to come celebrate your body on a suggestion and so constantly remind you that in your flesh there is no good thing don't rely on your flesh don't rely on your ability continue humbling yourself to the word of God until you receive your body change praise the Lord [Music] amen brought around tell us of a story of a young girl that gave her life to God and the prophet of God says he went there pray for that gift and and and and and the demon left her like a bat throw out of her and as she thought she was saying and she was safe and she want to testify to people that she was safe and she found herself in the same Club where she used to go and dance she wanted to leave people to Christ but when she get there before she realized she was on the floor dancing why because in your flesh there is no good thing praise the Lord so it is not how close you get to sin without sining the prophet of God says it's how far you can see it and stay away from it praise the Lord is how far you can see it and stay away from it because in your flesh there is what oh don't say in a sorrowful way say it like you mean it say it like you believe it if you don't believe it don't say it but if you believe it then say it like you believe it in your flesh there is not what no no good thing about your religious people have popped they have made a disgrace of the grace of God why because they were trusting in their flesh or I was at the meeting of our honor the spirit Our God baptized with the Holy Ghost that is in your soul you have nothing to do with his flesh you put it in the wrong atmosphere it will live a wrong life will have the rest of your life to me now so brother will take us here let's go before we lost time here when I get excited I lose my mind says your future whom he says you can repent now I will warn you to take your time follow me now just like I said if you believe me get in a wheelbarrow amen amen praise the Lord amen I would take my time to get you across the Lord you can't repent for what Adam done you believe there amen and what Adam did what was that what what did that brought unbelief amen amen amen what Adam did brought unbelief what Adam they brought the curse of unbelief praise the Lord amen it is just like that that man that said to Jesus he said Lord I believe have mine unbelief oh let's respond like Christian people don't be looking at me as if to say you are not in a word what are you afraid of praise the Lord amen he said Lord I believe my help mind unbelief why because unbelief is what produce your flesh is what produced this King this flesh the cells in this body that's the reason why evil thoughts lost our mind all the time that's why you get sick that's why you get hungry why because unbelief is this is the product of unbelief this is the product of unbelief praise the Lord that's the reason why a prophet will pray for the person in the prayer line on a vision he will say they are healed but why unbelievers keep giving them a symptom to come back in the prayer line on a vision you are healed by the word of God by his strength you are healed amen praise the Lord your flesh don't believe that it's your faith that lost from your soul that holds to Thy Word until healing is manifested in your body are we together so he says you can repent for what Adam have done you never done it I don't did you just get forgiveness for what you have done this is a very profound statement this is a very profound statement for you to think that you will eradicate get rid of unbelief you will never think and even thought again you will never struggle with a habit in your life it's a lie from the Devil that's never preach it the prophet of God never preach it praise the Lord that is the reason why Canada land do not represent Heaven Cana land is a constant fight the land of Canaan they fought constantly and when we come into our promise we have to fight constantly we have to fight every devil from our ground I have to possess this body keep Everlasting Spirit every live tongue every evil imagination you have to fight them constantly he says you just get forgiving for what you have done they're all nature I want us to read that together they are all nature I think let's close the service I mean I I don't know what's what's happening what I I are you here or your mind is somewhere else praise the Lord [Music] am I making you afraid am I preaching error if you think I'm preaching ever correct me by the word you just get forgiveness for what you have done let's read that together they're all nature is still there they're all nature brother Branham said it's still there you are forgiving but the old nature is still there praise the Lord amen amen you are forgiving God have forgiven you but the old nature is still there brother Brian says let's let's take this board just a minute our black boy I don't know we don't have a black boy here so I asked a brother to do this for me brother he really did that for me now so we will come back to this picture but then he says the brother Brown Drew illustration on on the Blackboard now he says yeah now here's the human heart is now I'm going away from being an artist I agree with you brother Brandon I'm not too yes and here is a human heart so he gave us two hearts that's that's the picture we try to to give you here so two hearts we gave you praise the Lord he says now this one over here has a snake in it that's sin that's uh that's this one year this one it is this one that has a snake in it and he says it represents sin are we together he says yeah he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is the Holy Ghost year he has his life so this one has a dove in it which represents the Holy Ghost praise the Lord are we together amen well this one year the one that has uh uh uh the serpent in it he says [Music] this one it has a serpent and he said it has malice it has hatred it has Envy that's what causing it is this fellow he says what is happening here is that this fellow is the one that is producing malice hatred and envy okay and whatever you can think about whatever you are struggling with temple whatever lie talk whatever you can think about this is the god that is constantly he's he's responsible for that praise the Lord he says well this one over here has love joy and long-suffering and that's what does it down here so he make us to see that this guy here has lost long-suffering and joy and because of his presence that represents the Holy Ghost that's what is is uh is producing this and God has given you Grace to go through your trials you know uh you are holding on you are trusting God you say love the Lord you stay have joy in the presence of God there is something that is creating that thing in your heart are we together praise the Lord amen and uh am I making you tired [Music] I'm making you sleepy no okay somebody will go ahead he says now when you ask or you are forgiving of your sin you have only done this taking that away praise the Lord amen but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the all root of evil it's filthy notice the end you repent and you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that he forgive you of your sins praise the Lord amen but the thing that make you do it the thing that make you do it this guy is still there amen amen so if it is still there what happened there is the other uh uh he will constantly create the same old desire praise the Lord then he says the second secondly comes sanctification is set your mind in order it sets your mind in order for holiness which means living a clean life it sets your mind it sets your spirit it gives you a desire to start hitting wrong things praise the Lord amen you feel bad when you think talks that you should not think or or or or feeling you you just feedback taking the word sanification is a compound Greek word which means cleans and set aside for service then the nest comes the Baptist in the fire and the Holy Ghost that God my door in US the fire of God cleans our heart from sin praise the Lord and both the Holy Ghost Inside praise the Lord so what is happening here now is that the fire comes and burned this guy praise the Lord amen amen and brings this God within praise the Lord the fire don't burn your heart it burns the serpent praise the Lord amen it's almost like instead of chapter 3 when Moses saw the Bush on fire what attract Moses was not just the fire it was because the leaves were not burning that was that was that was what Drew him now in his curiousness while the tree on fire by the bush is not burning and that's the same thing there is that same fire that was in the burning bush that comes into you it burns this thing out praise the Lord amen why you are still alive you are not burned yet amen it burns this thing out and then the dwarf Wishes the Holy Ghost flies in are we together now there is something here uh there is there is there is to for us to be able to understand I know many of you has you know uh you you are familiar with with this but where I want to bring us to here now is for you for us to see and appreciate what is happening because of these two laws that Paul has identified yet just like I said when you receive the Holy Ghost in you does not means that now there is good thing in your no there is no good thing in your flesh what happened here is that when the Holy Ghost comes in Burnout that what happened is that the nature of sin leaves the place of authority and a guest to the place of influence right they stay there to influence you praise the Lord but it is not it is not having Authority residents he stayed there to tempt you to whisper to you to make you doubt but what is dwelling in your heart greater is he that is in you the he that is in the world to praise the Lord so you see when the Holy Ghost comes and burns that desire what is happening it becomes the house of Akon the sin of our parents that have come down four generations the Holy Ghost comes and burn it okay amen why so the house of pharaohs or the seed of pharaohs the overcoming sea can be able to Spring forth are we together amen are you seeing the picture praise the Lord that's the reason why you cannot labor Carefree careless Christian Life no you have to be on your God because uh uh uh the enemy the devil your adversary is moving around like a Rollie lion seeking for who to do that nature leads from the place of authority it no longer have dominion over your life but it moves to the place of influence praise the Lord amen it will stay harbored around your mind to bring nasty thoughts to you it can remind you of your past and when you do her in the past what happened it starts to give you feeling of the past it's in a place of influence and just want to get your attention praise the Lord amen if you can give your attention and just get you to dwell in the past and in all the ugliness of the past then what does it create condemnation in your heart then you have condemnation in your heart you cannot have faith anymore to stay on the promised world praise the Lord now if you don't understand this what happened there is that you say God that's why I had the Holy Ghost this is the thing that will make the church to believe that you can lose the Holy Ghost you can have the Holy Ghost you can lose the holy God you can never lose the Holy Ghost because the prophet of God says it burns the desire of sin he says if you still have the desire you need to go to the altar praise the Lord amen having a desire and being tempted is to do amen praise the Lord amen young people just being in church don't burn that guy out you need an experience just being in church does not burn that guy out you need a birth amen you need to experience the fire of God consuming your life don't just hold on to your church membership no say God I need you amen I need that nature of sin to be burned praise the Lord Hallelujah you know brother Brown says you know you can you can I mean people can deceive themselves that they have the Holy Ghost when really they know down there that's that secondly stay there the desire of of of of of the things of the word are we together now so brother Brown will take this let me let me see if I can do this here quickly then he goes here he takes he takes this this story of this Indian man praise the Lord you know while I was telling this subject I was looking for I was looking for where to base a certain testimony and I couldn't I really couldn't find uh I was trying to find a direct direct code Brandon and uh uh so then I I bumped into the the Indian chief you know Broadband I talked about his model being his mother is uh uh you know an Indian so right from small he had a desire to go Western and all that and and then at the opening of the sea there's a there's a vision that came with better band was dressed like an alien chief and and there's there's a whole lot we can go into there but uh so I was looking into all of that so I just got this one to to just add to our thoughts here we are about closing so bear band says like the Indian was one time that got safe how are you getting along Chief say well since I got saved there's two dogs in me and said one white dog and one black and one black and a white dog wants me to do right and the black dog wants me to do wrong praise the lord we all have failed the same amen the Indian is saying it's too dark the other person well we normally say my other heart say my one heart say I shouldn't do it my other heart see my other heart was telling me to do it so it's the same thing that the Indian chief is talking about say they are fighting all the time he said how do you get along which one way in Chief he says it depends on which one Chief is the most amen praise the lord well that's it if you are going to listen to reason you will always have this this fellow conquering but if you will listen to the certain sound God's word working in your heart you will conquer the other one praise the Lord so he's bringing us right back again to Romans chapter 7. Paul is identifying there in our members lie these two laws one is the lord of the flesh it's a place of influence you get it in the wrong atmosphere you will feel the wrong spirit praise the Lord amen remember Brown will take this or the uh story this also about an Indian he says about three years ago I was hunting on uh I was on a hunting trip and I had an eating Gap I owned I hunt really fast it's just that's just me but then he's saying him by Nature you see one of them pressure Builder he's identifying his nature I was hunting with the Indian and I jumped off the Earth and there was an egg of the mountain and I started around the bed the whole Indian was about 10 years older than me here was just buffing coming be behind me and I I said come Chief come said too fast too fast the chief is telling brother Brown you're going too fast praise the Lord amen you're going too fast maybe he had his piping he was just taking this down this man has been on this on that mountain he has lived his life he will not be a god until he knows the path praise the Lord you're on a hunting trip he's uh he's anxious he wants to get his skill is saying too fast I thought oh well said come on instead praise the Lord is that my last okay that's what happened when you uh when you are so I did not send all my notes over I was trying to be face in and I left a big bunch of it out amen praise the Lord I really write it for you he said too fast I slowed down the next year he said two facts I got down to walk too fast oh mine I said chief the heck is up there he said him stay there he was born there praise the Lord so he will stay there praise the Lord amen he said preacher home too fast scare all the games away he says do like Indian walk them once look them nine take one step and look around you nine times praise the Lord amen amen but man here is preaching letting all the pressure he's talking about how we put ourselves under pressure we allow pressure to build in our minds and pressure for for unnecessary things and we get ourselves so much Under Pressure until we become so nervous whatever you're looking for in this world was here before you got here just like that air was on the mountain but he's the Indians said he was born there that's where he lived you don't have no other place to go so slow down praise the Lord amen whatever you know that is that is that is that is trying to overtake us and putting you under pressure you have to realize it was here before you got here and because we get so much honor pressure we don't realize when we have thrown ourselves into a wrong atmosphere the negative things of the word and negative things are of the media and all of those things we allow them to put so much pressure on us and brother Branham identified those pressure as demon powers that is upon the Earth praise the Lord all you are is child of God you are a daughter of God you are a son of God the grace of God have come to you the Lord is dealing with your life but you have to realize he still have a place of influence all he needs to do is to get you in the wrong atmospheres praise the Lord he had to get you in the wrong atmosphere he will make you to disbelieve the day you give your life to God all of these people preachers that preach this message and women that live holy life girls that walk to the altar as a virgin the man that the military was the first man that gave them their case but now they're turning their back on the very thing that gave them virtue and Grace why because they got themselves into the wrong atmosphere instead of reading the word of God and saying the atmosphere they are feeding from everything that comes off the internet they are feeding all the fourth dimension it's right here brother Brian said it's right here it's writing this wrong he stay in a place of influence the brother of God will teach us when he preached the message influence I don't have no other code to to flash on the stream so I've I didn't send all my calls you know I was doing that last night I was so excited I said Thank God I've got this PowerPoint thing down praise the Lord I've got this PowerPoint thing down you know before I come out of the office uh sometimes I don't I don't finish what what I'm standing I'm praying I'm waiting on the Lord and sometimes when the sunsary leaders say let's let's call for the preacher sometimes come on my mind I have a code I put it there sometimes I'm coming right through that door when I've just sent my notes to this people back then they've been doing some excellent work amen praise the Lord we are singing songs and you're saying well let's greet this brother let's greet they are very busy down there trying to put everything into a slight position we'll see a lot of the things that go behind the scene praise the Lord that's the reason why the things that you don't like in church do something about it don't complain because there are a lot of things that you enjoy you don't know how they do come the ones you don't like do something about it don't just complain amen amen praise the Lord amen so you see all of this whole house of pharaohs and and you know going around with all of the scripture I was it was not just to be uh you know uh show ourselves smart was was to bring you to a place of understanding praise the Lord thereby the sin of Genesis chapter 3 we all are born on a bastard birth we are all condemned to that because that was an illegitimate birth from our father that's what produced this flesh that's the reason why in this flesh there are no good thing but for God to get you here today it took many years of God dealing with your great-grandparents for him to get you here in church today it took many years of God dealing with your great-great-grandparents the man I know the seals that you know or know the Bible like you know but it has some quality that make them to keep themselves and give birth to the Next Generation because you were coming on the scene and the Next Generation gave birth to the Next Generation because God hired you in his mind live as a Son of God for this day and this age and he was watching over the sea he would need somebody to stand in loudish against the lies of the devil he would need a young woman that can prove that I can keep myself by the word of God he will need a young man I can rise above social pressure still live a decent Christian life amen that it will not just end on shedra Mission and Abednego but we will still have a shadra mission in a belly go in our day [Music] that's the reason why we use the mistake of your parents [Music] and make excuses don't blame your parents for your own failures Grace have come to you make use of what is in your hands keep yourself from the wrong atmosphere yeah that's the place we were coming to young people that's where we were coming to with this whole house of Paris that's what John says young men you have overcome the world because greater is he that is in you and what is that great I think the sea incorruptible which is the word the word praise the Lord brother Brandon said you have to realize it was not you that came predestinated [Music] it is not you he said it is the word it is because God promised to have a bride in this age that word was what found you praise the Lord because if you don't if you don't realize that it's the word and you just think people says well if I'm predestined if I'm predestinated I'm predestinated it's not you that came predestinating it is the word verbum said which is the seed is that seed and because it's predestinated to overcome is going to consume you it will draw you in praise the Lord you can be stubborn as a rock you see a seed on an Iraq what does it do it goes all around and then it comes around the Rock praise the Lord you can be stubborn as a rock your stubbornness will only keep regret for yourself because the day that God will get hold of you you will regret why you have to live the life that you know this is your house of pharaohs praise the Lord this is your time to come forth as a son of God as a daughter of God praise the Lord I remember there is good maybe every man that God made if you would just be patient with your husband you will get the good out of him if you just be patient with your wife you will get the good out of him if he would just be patient with your children you will get the good try to fetch the good try to fetch the good out because it's in this flesh it's in this flesh amen and nothing good is going to come out of it this can come pray but Johnny I really enjoyed this thing he was fancy I really enjoyed it probably to be honest you love the Lord this afternoon it's 10 minutes after one o'clock then just by our
