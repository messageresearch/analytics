Christ and uh you may have your seat for a while before we change the order of the service here we have uh uh few announcement and uh prayer request [Music] uh [Music] um well the uh a day of worship with our brother Christen uh uh Cuma from the UK that will be on Saturday uh March 2nd that will be the first Saturday of March and uh uh it's brother there from the UK there a friend to brother area he was uh coming over to visit with him so the plan to use their Saturday night for uh a time of fellowship and praise so uh they are setting up a day of worship that would be the first Saturday in March and uh uh I think they're having some flyers to give out but brother Jordan told me the Flyers will be ready on Wednesday night so beginning Wednesday night next week they will give you Flyers of reminder so uh uh let's uh let just come together and just have a time of worship and uh which of course I think uh definitely we need as uh as as individuals in our lives we need also as a church and uh uh you know uh in I think is there over in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah warned the people that uh there will be a time where the voice of the bridegroom and and the voice of the Bride deceased from being heard in uh in the city and when he said that he was actually referring to a time of judgment that Israel will be going through but if you really look at that in deep sense is that when when when worship goes away from the people is uh is is is is a sign of of jman you know uh uh uh we we worship worship is it's a sign of Victory it's a sign of Victory and uh so uh let's make use of that uh uh Saturday night the time of Fellowship uh with praise and we have our regular service on Sunday morning but uh uh invite as as many as you can and uh if we have more visitors than we can

this morning thank you uh uh for keeping us in your prayers uh try to break out of the cord and and uh feeling much better than I did during the week so uh uh we we just want to take a thought here this morning I I I remember that I promised I was going to to uh do uh uh something lat uh like I said uh uh a tribute to uh uh a tribute to uh fenny Crosby tomorrow will be uh the day that uh she flew like a do that gift left the word praise the Lord so uh uh uh as we will share with you here fenny Crosby uh she was born uh um in 1820 and she passed in 1915 and uh and but the gift in her life she gave us um 8,000 is recorded but more than 8,000 hyms and and poay that she wrote what a gift what a what a life but you see as as I was uh last year when I was doing it because uh uh February 12th fell on Sunday so I really wanted to do it on Sunday but then again I think that was when we had brother Crosby from uh uh from the UK preaching for us so I I really couldn't do it so I just read few you know few uh uh quotes that brother Brandon mentioned about her and then uh so uh uh thinking that I would I would still be able to do I really wanted to do it you know I went through a lot of different Cults and different things that she said went through through her her life story and all of that but then uh I got another twist to the whole thing uh I fed on u a book of uh a Jewish American doctor that was born blind and and when I when I read his book it changed my life it it affected me in a way and then I thought no uh this thing I I I wanted to do on fny crossby it it will not be fed I think I I need to find a way but when I read his book actually he was born in Chicago uh uh the the first born blind doctor many Doctor practice blind but this one was born blind and he became a medical doctor and uh uh we will we will we will will mention a little bit about him but I I'll tell you a little bit where how I got to where I got uh to to be able to bring this little talk to you today and uh uh when when I was when I was reading through his book it was a book that I found in the TR store I went over in Savers I was just strolling in Savers uh and then uh I saw the book on the Shelf the blind doctor I said wow let me see what it is I just took it blind doctor you know uh I I just took it and and that was his biography that was that was written and I telling you when I wrote that book I when I read that book I read the book I I every evening when I come home and I and I get into bed I would take the book and I would read I read it with laughter I read it with tears I read it with with uh it was just such a blessing to me it was such a blessing to me I I I'm not be able to tell you everything about it but it it just so when I came to while reading the book then I thought about uh uh what Paul said in Romans and and when he said that uh blindness happened in part to Israel so when he says blindness happening part he was talking about uh uh Israel spiritual blindness then you know I I I also thought about uh uh St John chapter 9 if you if you remember you remember there was the time that I preached on St John chapter 9 it was right around that time I was reading that book because there in St John chapter 9 Jesus said this man it was nothing because that what his father did or his mother did that made him to be born blind he was born blind that God should be glorify so so the book was actually inspiring me and and and and I started looking at blindness not uh not uh uh uh like uh like an impediment I was not looking at blindness anymore you know like a disability I was looking at blind as a gift and that's what fenny crossby would tell you she would tell you that her blindness was a gift that she could have never written those ssongs if she were seeing the things that you are seeing and being distracted praise the Lord at at a place in her life she said if if God will desire to give her her sight she will refuse it uh Dr Jacob said the same thing with all of the things that he could achieve I mean he was a medical doctor highly respected and uh uh uh uh uh he Sav uh even the the US uh uh uh uh uh uh military you know uh uh at the time uh of one uh one of the overseas W and and uh you know there was the outbreak of uh Clorox and all of that I mean uh and and and and so forth so this morning we are taking a little break here so I'm not I'm not doing this uh uh uh directly to uh uh fny Crosby as I as I would like to do but I I bring a message out of it but I'll take three characters that I want to uh uh uh talk about before we get into our message that will be fenny Crosby and there's another lady called the Helen killer Helen killer also she was born blind and deaf but she got a teacher that taught her from small sign language that that's that's one of the uh the American very powerful home movie you watch with your kids how their teacher was determined for killer to be able to to read and write and uh uh which of course she was able to rein write went to school got out with a bachelor's of art degree and she became an advocate a lecturer praise the Lord so this morning we want to speak on uh I I entitled my message the mystery blindness imp part I wanted to call it this mystery I've been I was thinking uh I say the mystery of blindness no it would not be it would not sound right because I'm I'm taking something that Paul spoke about that Paul identify as a mster and in in in uh uh uh uh sh w this when brother Brandon was listing all the Mysteries that were to be revealed this mystery was the second mystery the mystery of Israel blindness praise the Lord now but this morning we're not talking about the mystery of Israel blindness I'm not going to go into the mystery of Israel blindness but I'm I'm I'm I'm using that as as a title I will talk a little bit about Israel blindness but I'm not dwelling on that what I want to to to talk about is that the mystery blindness impart praise the Lord amen because as as we as will realize as we look here and see it is that there is there is a there's a group of people that experience blindness in part and there's a group of people that experienced blindness in hold praise the Lord now because I think when Paul said blindness imp part happened to Israel he was he was identifying a period of time where they went blind amen and after they went blind they got their sight so it's it's a part it's a partial blindness or a part in their life a part in their history but also if there is a blindness in part there is also a blindness in whole praise the Lord that is what I want for us to also be be conscious of as we go into this so if if uh as we will trust the Lord to uh to help us this morning let's let's stand to our feet we'll do uh a pretty long reading this morning or maybe we can read uh Romans chapter 11 then you take your seat then I'll do the long reading since since I'm the one that's supposed to stand up the longest so let's let's read Romans 11 I will have love for us to read Genesis and get to Romans but let's read Romans 11 and then you can take the comfort of your seat standing up long is part of my my my job Dy praise the Lord Romans chapter 11 verse 25 Romans 11 verse 25 Romans 11:25 for our who not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery now that's what I wanted to use this mystery blindness imp part this mystery I think I would change it for I will not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery least ye should be wise in your own concept that blindness impact is happened to Israel until till the fullness of the Gentile become In Praise the Lord the Lord bless you you can have your seat while we turn to Genesis 48 Genesis 48 we'll pretty much read the entire chapter uh Genesis 48 we'll read read the entire chapter are we together praise the Lord and it came to pass after these things th th one told Joseph Behold thy father is sake and he took with him his two sons maned and ephra and one told Jacob and said behold thy son Joseph cometh unto the and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon his bed and Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me in L in the land of Canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee in I will make thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession and now thy two sons ephran and man which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt are mine as Ruben and Simeon they shall be mine right there Jacob was adopting the two sons of Joseph now so you see because of that Israel never run out of a 12 tribe praise the Lord amen if uh if if uh uh uh if you come to the Tabernacle where the Levites uh uh the Levites were were were separated to the Lord and uh the sons of uh of Joseph were counted in the tribes of Israel to keep them as 12 if you are counting the tribe by the sons of Jacob then Joseph is counted in as a tribe praise the Lord amen that's the reason why in most in most history after Genesis you don't hear the Trap of Joseph but you hear the Trap of Ephron and Manet why because the Levites were taken by God so Joseph was not counted as a tribe but his two sons were counted so Israel never lost a 12 tribe why because Jacob is adopting the sons of Joseph praise the Lord they will be unto me as Ruben and Simeon and Ruben and Simeon came from Leah if you if you follow the songs there the issue which thou Beed after them shall be D it ISS uh if you have any songs later they will be yours and i' all I've always believed that you have your first child here for your parents then you can have start having yours that that just me no amen and I issue which thou be geted after them shall be dine and shall be called after thy name after the name of their brethren in their inheritance praise the Lord and then he went over he went over the entire history here telling telling Joseph you know uh uh uh as for me when I came to Pam Rachel Died By Me In the Land of Canan in the way when yet there was uh but a little way to come unto ephra I bury her there in the word of ephra the same is bethem and Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said who are these and Joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom God have given me in this place and he said bring them I prayed thee unto me and I will bless them now the eyes of Israel were deemed for age so that he could not see blindness in part praise the Lord that's that is something that I want for us to to realize here Paul is is uh is is making us to see something that he called a mist and and and a mist is uh is is is is is God's own secret something that God did to be able to hide his purpose praise the Lord something that God allowed and just like when we were talking about the the patriarch mothers there was something that we found of them Sarah was barring Rebecca was Barren Rachel was Barren God that told Moses there would be no baroness but yet he had baroness in the mother of the patriarch and we know it was for a purpose and here is the same thing also now we seeing that God God gave Israel blindness in part Isaac was blind Jacob here is experiencing blindness also so there is something about this that God is hiding his Divine Purpose he's putting his Divine Purpose in this as much as it looks like something that is scary to us all wow how will God promise Abraham to be a father of nation and then his wife is Barren why would God do that except he had a reason are you grapping the picture he has a reason so the Bible says here now the eyes of Israel were D verse 10 for a so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and Israel said unto Jacob I I have not taught to see thee to see thy face and L God have showed me also thy seed and Joseph brought them out from uh between his knees and and and bowed himself on onto on onto the and and bow himself with his face to the Earth BL you take time and Joseph took them both Ephron in his right hand towards Israel left hand and Manish it in his left hand towards Israel right hand and brought them near unto him and Israel stretched out his hand now what what I want us to grab here what I want us to grab here is that Paul said blindness happened to isra in part as he's talking about Israel in our mind we can think about the nation praise the Lord but what I want you to for us to First thing about is the man Israel which is Jacob because Paul what Paul is referring to as a mystery is what took place right here what took place right here here the secret of Israel Redemption praise the Lord amen he's talking about the nation Israel but before they came to be the nation Israel it was one man that rise up with God it was a man that met God on the backside of the desert and he h on to God and said you have to bless me praise the Lord amen and the angel said your name will no no more be called Jacob but you will be called Israel are we together so you see a mystery a mystery does not just fly from in the air it's not something that is pick up the prophets of old when when they were talk about a mystery is something that is hidden in the word that's the reason why brother Bram said you know the the the the the the mistress that will be revealed it cannot be something that is that is extra from what is in the word it has to be in the word so when Mo when when when Paul was saying I don't want you to be ignorant of this mystery what he's seeing that make Israel to reject their Messiah from that make Israel to be blind the nation Israel to be blind to say we have no no King but Caesar they deny their own King they said crucify him what made them to do that was hidden in the life of Israel right here what made them to do that was the same thing that make Israel to cross his hands are you seeing the picture so when he says blindness happen in part I don't want you to be ignorant of this that blindness happened in part until the time of the Gentiles will come in when you look back into the life of our father Jacob uh H H uh uh blindness happening part you think about it Joseph bringing his sons to his father he said them in in his mind this is the first B this is the second B I've said them right here no this is the first Bor because he will go to my daddy's right hand this is the second Bor he will go to my daddy left left hand you know he plac it in order he brought the boys right there and Jacob turned his hands around praise the Lord and even in the scripture he cried and said father no it's not that way you you're supposed to do it this way he said no God is the one that turned my hands praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the picture so what Paul was referring to was what took place in the life of Israel and because it happened in the life of the man Israel the nation Israel will also experience it praise the Lord are we together and we could take types and and and just like we did uh uh when we were looking at uh uh the mystery of of baroness like I would call it why would God allowed baroness to be seen in the picture of mother it's the same reason we come to a scripture here that will that will help us to be able to look at that together so we want to talk about uh uh uh this mystery blindness impart this mystery blindness imp part so just like I said before we go uh uh uh any further let's just go through the life of these of these uh different individuals that uh they have inspired us to come to this thought Let's uh let's look at the life of uh fenny Crosby that will be our our second quote that's that's the second slide no yep praise the Lord Brother Braham spoke about her we are all familiar with that praise the Lord I sure thought I came up came out with my app pointers okay and uh uh a tremendous life she said yet it seems intended by the Blessed Providence of God that I should be blind all my life and I thank him for the dispensation if perfect eff sight were offer me tomorrow I will not accept it I might not have sunk hymns to praise to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me praise the Lord and that is not only it with one that is blind what we have to realize that the Bible says we are made for his purpose praise the lord we are made for his purpose Isaiah chapter 53 the Bible says it pleased God that he should be bruised he should be rejected a pleased God praise the Lord and when a person can come to the place and realize that whatever state that God has placed them in is it's not that you are just accepting it because you feel defeated no you are accepting it because you understand you understand that you are called to this right you are not accepting it because yeah everybody is becoming well yeah my own I'm just no that surrounder right you are surrounding to the situation you are not happy nobody that surrounder in war is happy right they are not happy they are captured by by uh by their enemies and they are just giving in that's not what we are talking about but when a person has has come to a place of understanding realizing in a way that God is leading them and God is dealing them that this is the place that God has set them to be and God have placed them in this position to be a blessing praise the Lord are we together she was born blind as as her life story would tell sometime in her life she was able to find love and she got married sometime in her life she had a child but then she lost her child praise the Lord that was when she wrote the song save in the arm of Jesus save in his tender embrace praise the Lord a tremendous life when she came out of there she gave herself to more dedication it it is it is enough at a place where she could be frustrated and says uh uh uh you know uh uh the only person that could tell me and everything around me you took them away from me but she did not question her maker she contining to praise God she Contin to write she find comfort and strength in inspiring others praise the Lord she even went over to the US Congress to to advocate for blind schools and uh uh for blind children to go to school pray praise the Lord Brother Brandon will say this about her sorry I try to force that that cope there because I was trying to make my notes a little bit uh uh smaller instead of just adding a lot of he says then and then when when Fanny crossed be one day when they when they come to to her with their big bagging she was P to and they come to her and said we will give so much if you will just give your talent over to uh making Sons for the the the entertainment word she flatly refused praise the Lord amen she will not do it she said if if there's anything there I have it belongs to Christ and so they The Men Who were talking to her said then I suppose that you are expecting to go to a world where there is everlasting life and so forth and said so what do you expect this Christ to be what what are they thinking they are thinking that you need an eyes to seek Christ so they are trying now to make mockery out of her you are sinking for the Christ that will not give you your sight praise the Lord and I've always said this you know uh uh uh if you make if you if you if you make your problem that you are dealing with bigger than God you're going to worship that problem and you can only serve God how much you know him you can never serve God above the way you know him neither below the way you know him right the way you will serve God and be dedicated to God is how much you know him but I can say there is more of God to know praise the Lord there is more of God God beyond our knowledge to know he's the he's the god that want time fill every space praise the Lord and I believe he's here this morning so they are speaking to this woman and saying I'm supposed you are you are expecting to go to a world where there is everlasting life say yes what so what do you expect this Christ to be said he will be a man and said then if you if you are the same over there as you are yet said uh you did never see him said you are blind she said oh I will know him anyhow so they they said how will you ever know him if you are I stay blind over there as you never have sight in this life and on the other side if you have no sight there how will you know him you you see the thing there is that the it's not it's not like Comfort they are trying to bring to her uh uh uh in one sense they are trying to Mark her because of her stand they are trying to scoff at her not only scoffing at her but scoffing that what you are believing is not truth amen because it's more like what you are believing is not even producing the result that you should have praise the Lord and then and all of these things have have have breeded out our our our uh how you call it now it had breathed out our prosperity gospel because uh it's all based on the fact that if it is God that created the the the universe and God that own everything so we should own the whole word the word should be shining on Us Praise the Lord but that's not the principle that God choose to work are we together we're living in such an age that has reduced God to material things Our God Is Bigger Than That amen our our our our purpose that we are called is for him to be reflected in Us Praise the Lord for him to be reflected in us that man will see his good work in us and glorify Our Father in heaven so they are saying all of these things to her and uh as as as he goes on here they laugh at her and she turned and started through the house when uh she had made her decision no sir nothing of the this word all my talent is given to Christ she started back across the house and raised up her hand and she said I will I shall know him I shall know him and redeem by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him praise the Lord if I don't see him with my eyes by the prints of the nails in his hands I will identify him praise the Lord Amen brother Bram said is in those great CW crucial moving the stram is put upon us that God Moves In Praise the Lord when it looks like everything is against you praise the Lord everything is against you and you are not goinging by everything you are still standing for Christ praise the Lord he say he's not going to pass us through a a tube and bring us on the other side and say You have overcome we have something to overcome it's in those crucial moment the strength is upon us that he moves in when we make the decision for him that's between life and death there little sharp edge sometime at the last moment when you think you are not going to get well and somebody making fun of you still hold to your testimony it is the time that God moves in amen am we are in uh h h a culture that is all about pleasing people pleasing people now so this is uh this is uh uh fny Crosby let's take uh Helen killer just like I said this little little girl was born blind and also born deaf and uh uh uh and her dad got her a lady that came in and this lady was determined that she would help killer to be able to to to gravitate towards the the the sound language and she will communicate with her as she will as she will teach her the sound language and teach her you know the sign for different things she would say those words to her praise the Lord and she became a great American Author a political artivist lecturer she was the first blind deaf person to earn a bachelor uh Bachelor of art degree praise the Lord a remarkable Altar and she left us with these few I took few of her quotes that she left us w she said the best and most beautiful things in this word cannot be seen or touched they must be felt with their heart the beautiful thing the best and beautiful things in this world they cannot be touched they must be filled with a heart she said alone we can do so little together we can do so much life is either a daring Adventure or nothing at all praise the Lord you must be brave to do what you want to do amen you must be brave to stand for what is right sir sometimes you might have nobody there to encourage you you that's the reason why it must become a revelation to you timism is the faith that leads to achievement nothing can be done without hope and confidence keep your face in the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow if you keep your face in the sunshine I was reading uh h a book uh of uh of uh guy that wrote on Helen Kell in one of his book and when he first met her he he wrote this thing he said that uh they met in Jerusalem she went down to visit the Tomb of Jesus and he was there at the very same time as a young preacher and then uh she was coming out of the Tomb when he just got there so he heard somebody talking and then uh uh uh and and and he was so fond of reading her books and then when she came out of the Tomb he said she lifted her hands just when she came out and she said there is no Darkness here praise the Lord amen a blind woman she can see she can tell Darkness from light but coming from from the Tomb of Jesus she said there is no Darkness here praise the Lord amen and that's what our faith reveals there is no darkness in Christ that's what John said if we if we say we walk in the light and we are in darkness he said we deceive ourself there is no darkness in Christ so she was not speaking from what she could see with her eyes she was speaking from what she could feel with her heart there is no Darkness here and I'll testify of my friend the blind doctor Jacob parents had children and they had succession of blind children so when Jacob was born just like you see his eyes he was born with his eyes open so his mother was so convinced that Jacob could see because his eyes was open and it was just moving back and forth so she was so convinced that the child could see until Jacob started crying and and and and and then also when he was born he was born a very active Child full of action laughing and he was just just active so he he he he started moving very early so when he started crying and then he started bumping into things his mother got so afraid she got so afraid that her worst night may have fall upon her again she has a blind child she said no no no she cried no they had to take him to the doctor then the doctor will confirm that Jacob was born blind she was so tall but he was such a sunshine because you couldn't stop him he he he bump into this he knows that he can't go there he com here and he was just all over the place he was just so fast and that's how uh uh one of the robber they were a Jewish Family one of the robber would come and talk to Jacob father his next brother to him was also blind so the the the Rober would would tell Jacob father that look you can you you can say here and and just feel so sorry for your children or else you can send them off which of course that is something that Jacob mother would not agree to but he was telling Jacob father you can send them off there's a blind School somewhere they can go and learn in all of that the dad struggle with it for my boys they can already see send them away we're going to take care of them you know he worried about dad but then finally he decided so they had to plan this thing against the mother that will pack things for the boys and take them away on the train right on the train Jacob was all over the place bumping into people you know uh uh uh you know at the time he was walking you know and and uh and he had he had a a a a a kind of a photographic memory I mean you can you can set you can you can set Jacob down and when you are reading he just he just suck it in I mean he suck it in that he can repeat to you word by word exactly what you said a gift was born a gift was born into the word the first blind medical doctor he does his diagnosis by listening to to the patient he put his ears on your stomach or on your heart and he will tell you exactly and that's not now one now one the diagnostic have ever fail he was so gifted that he could tell people by by their smell you walk in the room you come through that door he call you by name a gift was born in a word he was so gifted but how for him to get to the medical school because in that time there was no provision for people with disability right nobody believed that he could do it this young boy he went there was there was a lady that you that used to come around to sell to sell match I'm telling you more story than what I'm preaching it's it's it's how much I was gravitated to this book so just bear with me I will get into my message bear with me there there there's a young woman that that would come around to sell matches so she would come and and Supply uh uh they had a little store and so he found it from the lady how where do you get this and the lady told him he got he got on the on on on a cart went down to the city center in in in Chicago to talk to this man and and the man says boy St fooling yourself how how can you sell my matress you can't see he said just try me the man when I pay no attention to him he went back the next day and and you know he kept begging the man just try me and the man would try him the man just count count it as a loss so the man is a loss this one I giv to this one is a loss praise the Lord to his to his amazed man Jacob did the sale returned the money back got another goods and he did that until he opened a shop for himself to support his ambition to be a doctor he told his parents I will be a medical doctor he opened a shop where he started supplying the next thing he would do is that uh because of of of his selling skills everybody knew him now as the blind businessman downtown Chicago this is not a a fairy tale story it's something that took place 5 hours away from here downtown Chicago it's not a fair tale story he went and bought H H that's when the the T Riders just came out he got to a t uh uh riding uh uh company and you know uh he he proposed a business plan to them and then he became a Salan from them he started traveling from states to States introducing that t brother to all of the states until well you know he made a a big business for that company are we together amen now so as as you know as time will go back the challenge was how will he get to medical school how will he get to Med Medical School somebody introduced him to one doctor in Chicago that was practicing but he he he's not he was now blind so he was not born blind but he went blind so Jacob went to this doctor the doctor told Jacob your case is different I was not born blind but you were born blind son you can't do this you got to think about something else praise the Lord let's let's just read uh uh Jacob cot here I I need to preach I need to preach you want a book I can borrow it to you Jacob said Vision does not depend on eyes the true vision is insight and that is seen with the mind and the Heart praise the Lord the first blind physician to practice medic to practice medicine independently he had his own Clinic he was not working on people people were working on him he had his own Clinic look it's God that have cut our life path when the prophet said show me a man and show me the woman that will put God first in their life I will show you a person that will prosper it's God that have cut our life path there is no shortcut to success and you can never make yourself what God did not make you no matter how hard you try the first blind physician to practice medicine independently is remembered not only for his medical achievement but also for his inspiring views one notable CT attribute to him is it is not enough to tell me that I cannot achieve my dreams because I am blind if the the moment if you can give Jacob a reason why he can do it explain it but if you tell him because you are blind you bring out that that uh righteous indignation in him and he will prove you wrong he started the first American blind Boy Scout God go and search it out Google gave us 100 of free information go and search it out there is nothing that you can't want you you want you fine some are there true some are there false it is not enough to tell me that I cannot achieve my dream because I'm blind you must also tell me that if I were not blind then I could achieve my dreams so what is he saying is it because I'm blind I can't do it if I was not blind will I just do it will it just happen automatically without me having a dream without me having something to inspire me to do it if I were not blind it's not the eyes that do it it's the drive that is inside it's the conviction that is inside praise the Lord men of all they set up alone independently to bring the gospel those men travel on he back they went to different places see how the disciples went around the world carrying the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Hidden countries brother brand with his poor life and poor education could stand in the in in in in the midst of Theologian when the word has rised to such a level and there were men on the field that that that were part of writing the lamb Bible and all of that but he stood with his conviction praise the Lord he knew an angel met him yeah he was not making up stories he was not looking for people sympathy he was turning by his conviction he said tell me if you tell me that I can't do it because I'm blind can you tell me that I can do it because I have a sight and then you must tell me why why will make the difference this quote reflects his determination and the challenges he overcame emphasizing their Disability should not determine one ability to pursue and Achieve dreams are we together are you ready for preaching okay I fin with all my storytelling now amen I finish with all my storytelling let me get into into business this morning Hallelujah amen when you look over there in in in in Exodus 4:1 uh the Lord says this uh uh uh to Moses Exodus 4:1 let me take the few minutes that is before us here then and uh and DEP into this word verse 10 Moses said unto the Lord oh Lord I am not eloquent neither hether told nonsense thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who have made man mouth all who maketh the dumb or the death or the seen or the blind have not I the Lord what does that speaks of what does that speaks of there's no child that is born with a with a disability that is that is that is by mistake right praise the Lord God is saying I allow it I have a purpose I have a purpose I have a purpose if if the person that I gave it to can just give it back to me I will use it for the reason why I allow it praise the Lord but what the devil do is that he use that very thing and create a complex in our life and then we are depressed by that right because because we want to be like others and not appreciating who we are praise the Lord what we have what is given to us as if to say we can make ourself any better than what we are who make the Blind and just like like I said Jesus said there in St John chapter 9 is neither this man neither his parents don't blame his grandparents he was born blind for this very moment that God will be glorified yes praise the Lord see how much that God is looking for our inability to bring his strength amen perfect strength and perfect weakness brother Brandon says and that is the thing that we should know that's the thing that we should learn to be able to give to God our inabilities yes when we says I am weak but thou are strong it's not it's not just a music we must be be able to identify those areas where we are weak Lord I need you in this area not using it for an excuse but everybody not talk about yourself forget about everybody forget about everybody talk about yourself identify your need identify your your weaknesses identify the area where God can step in praise the Lord who make the blind who make the deaf Are we together are you beginning to see the picture amen this mystery blindness happen in part no matter how how how sharp your eyesight is it's limited amen no matter how sharp your eyesight Is 2020 what what whatever the the perfect number is is still Limited at a set end it will not be able to see and when it cannot see to from the limit Beyond you are blind yes you are blind to whatever is happening there right are we together that's what that's why the Apostle Paul called it a mystery that's why he called it a mystery why because he has been able to identify a Divine Purpose a Divine Purpose when Israel was promised a king through the linage of David for the Everlasting Ru of David why would they miss their their their their Messiah why why would they miss their King but there is a Divine Purpose because there are all there are other seeds of God there are other people that God has in his economy that he must bring them through praise the Lord so blindness happen in part blindness happen in part think about things that happen in our life that later on you come to realize you think about it you know uh uh I mean uh uh uh uh for people that were in Catholic church and in other denomination Church you grow up and then now you come to the message say she said oh wow why I never knew this blindness happen part praise the Lord God have a purpose why he allow you in in in that and not only denomination other things that we go through in our life and then you come to the reality that W yeah I I wish I knew better why God allow it why God allow it praise the Lord he has a purpose he has a Divine Purpose that is the thing that is behind a mystery the thing that is that that that is about a mystery is not just about a knowledge it's it's it's the Divine Purpose of God that is hid behind that scene why would Jacob cross his hands Joseph said standing he tou why why would he cross his hands praise the Lord because he knew his his father is blind he tried to make it easy for him he brought one son on this side one boy on this side identify them right but yes he crossed his hands why will he do it there is a Divine Purpose that was behind it praise the Lord that the cross will bring us in are we together Hallelujah now so brother Brandon will say this uh uh uh if we if we go back to our slide yeah I know I'm carrying these young people back and forth but that's okay they become smarter that way praise the Lord let's get back to our slide now brother Brandon would say this in God has a provided lamb he said you know blindness is a horrible thing and that's the way that is from the way that we will see it from from the heo perspective when I see the man blind my heart goes out to him but yet I know of a blindness that's worse praise the Lord amen and all of a blindness that's wor spiritual blindness how God made man to visualize him and they can do it God breaks himself in his creation for us to be able to see him praise the Lord but man has reduced him to creas and Dogma that you have to go to a certain church to meet God you have to believe a certain thing to meet God when God Paul says the invisible thing declare when God have he has spread himself in even in the leaves around us he has made himself so visible that we can be able to to to see him we don't need to get to a church to talk to him you can talk to him at the back of your we walk down the street and talk to him but man has reduced it down you got to get down there and do father son Holy Ghost you got to go through a certain Creed and Dogma to be able to get to this go that is so easily to be rich God says I make the death I make the blind but when God does it he does it in part but when man does it he give you a blindness in hold he make your mind blind your soul blind your heart blind that even your eyes is blind you can see read the scripture and you will never even be able to see when man makes you blind you have a blindness in hold when you get blind by creas and blind by culture and blind by just your superstitial belief you darken your heart right that even if they show you the word of God black and white you will still read across it you are reading it through your Creeds and Dogma why because it have darkened your heart when God gave blindness he gave it in part praise the Lord I had a time one time to be with one one one uh blind guide you know very nice guy here uh we used to fellowship with him in all of that and we we have this small I don't know how you call it alligator pepper very very small and and and and and there's a bu that used to fly uh uh during the reny season and uh uh you know uh people will capture it by the light you know and and and fix it you know well so I had this friend of mine he says look I I'll tell you let's you will see how how much this guy is blessed I'm going to put all of these short alligator pepper and mix it in this box because it's a box that we used to eat and mix it in this box they got and he will pick all the box and leave the alligator peer and give it back to you praise the Lord I had a privilege to work with uh with uh s language I did a little bit of sign language I wish I did a whole lot of it and then I had this this friend I would go to their school and I mean uh it it will always amaze me because as I as I would talk to the lady just before I finish saying what I want to say she has written my answer she just look at my legs she can hear but this little graduat from the University of of Liberia she just look at my lips when God give a person what would seem like a disability to men it's a gift it's a gift Society bring us and abuse us that we don't see those things as gift I had a bunch of list of uh of of people that that that that are physically imper I just choose that I was not going to go down that list or else we will not get up from here but I I I want to bring this for us to be able to see it that whatever condition that God put us in whatever part of the word that he make us that we were born it was not a curse praise the Lord because he put his seed all over the Earth there are people that are serving this very same God preaching this very same message that we are preaching they are in the jungle somewhere they don't have this access of building and drums and and and and guitar and and and piano but they come together with the Jo of the Lord in their heart they sing they praise God they feel the presence of God yes sir why because they have accepted what God has given to them that's all of the curse that the technology age has brought brought to us you look on YouTube you want to be like those people it's only that few minute of their life you are seen right that moment that they dress for that's why you are see you want to be like that it's just one minute why you want to be somebody like that is just one minute and you have your whole life that you have lived to become what you are why can't we appreciate it and it's just causing depression and and plaguing the minds of of of the society committing suicide and all of that praise the Lord there is fny Crosby realizing her purpose realizing the purpose that she was born oh yeah it's truth it's truth I don't think that it was so easy for her growing up you have to go through that trial time you go through that time of comparison and year and de and all of that but that you you have to come to a place of realization your parents are not the F praise the Lord there's a creator that design us are we together I know where're blind that is worse spiritual blindness how God made a man to visualize him and they can't do it praise the Lord amen Jesus said over there in Matthew chapter 6 I just Dr drop uh manot notes I was upsate last night and not trying to take much of this time and and he said that just just stay just stay on the on the PowerPoint there young people just stay on the PowerPoint I'm trying to close this thing up here I took most most of the time into stories this morning praise the Lord but what what is what is inspiring my heart and blessing me of this thing is a life that have been able to see their purpose praise the Lord she found her purpose she celebrated around the word pass me now to Gentle Savior she found her purpose praise the Lord every time we sing any one of those 8 8 800s or thousand hes a air through eternity a echo through eternity we need to find our purpose for the one that have made us why are we here praise the Lord Jesus told the disciples down here in Matthew chapter 6 let me just read that like I said don't turn away from this I have one more Cote and then I'll close this thing up praise the Lord he says uh verse 21 Matthew 6:21 for word your treasure is there your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye if therefore that I be single that whole body will be full of light but if th eye be evil thy whole body will be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee is darken how great how great how great is that Darkness praise the Lord how great is that Darkness how great that we get so negative we get so bitter we get so bitter even the things that we try to do to bring ourself Joy still don't bring us joy the one people try to do to bring you Joy don't bring you Joy Jesus says what a Darkness he says you are coming from a very dark place you are coming from a dark place let's read it in the message Rapture this I have that in the quote uh in my scripture there we'll drop back to death brother brand will says this here Revelation 3 there you are back to the black the the blindness again trumping over the things of God as if they didn't mean nothing to them scoffing and making fun of it that's what the Bible says he's identifying Lisha Church age an age that claim to be rich F of goods the Bible says she's miserable she's blind she's naked she's tramping over over the grace of God making fun of the things of God Church have just become an association right praise the lord we are not doing nothing for God in the body we are not doing nothing for God out of the body right it's just an association no sense of responsibility denomination Catholic Church Church gave us a a a a a system that tells you that the church is responsible for you so most of the people I have an aunt AED you know uh uh uh my my dad only living sister there I love her to death every time she call me you know and she ask me please help me I need to pay my deal to my church you know because uh all she's thinking about is for the church to bury her that's what denomination has given to us that the church is responsible for you it's a lie you are responsible for this body if you are part of this body you are responsible for it you are responsible for his growth for it spirituality when Church become just an association so when I die I can get somebody to bury me brother Braham says I'm thinking about how to come out of the Grave it's not to go in there but what is the spirit of the age it have created such such such a blindness for the people such a blindness brother Braham says until they are tramping over the things of God it don't mean nothing to them they can scarf and make fun of services let a person Come and sing special they they make fun but they can never sing speci yeah but they know all the songs in in the back of their head why it's from a dark place you are not seeing spiritually why because brother brandham said in the four seals you can go and you you can go and check it up he says the B body of Jesus when he ascended in heaven is sit in heaven as a memorial the only body that Jesus have is this one on earth praise the Lord you see the Catholic Church make us to look to that one it's just a memorial it's just a memorial that and that's the reason why he said Paul what are you persecuting me Paul says who are th Lord he says I'm Jesus he was persecuting the church he was laughing scoffing at the church praise the Lord and when he did that what happened to him he got blind God struck him blind and that's what happened when people are making mockery of the church mockery of the message of the hour you are just falling in a spiritual blindness that's all praise the Lord and then pretty soon in you gets so dark it gets so dark that no nobody can make you happy nobody can ever preach for it to make sense to you because you know everything inside you get so dark right spiritual Darkness yes sir if God blind you is just imp part don't worry he will open your eyes if he put you in a situation it's just imp part don't worry he will change your situation yes sir but when you allow yourself you allow your Creed you allow the Society to Blind you it make you so dark it make you so bitter with a you get angry at the government angry at the school angry at uh a church angry at everything angry with yourself for what you are just coming from a dark place yes sir you are just coming from a dark place Paul says 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse4 if our gospel be hate it is hate to them that the God of this evil age has blind it praise the Lord yes sir we don't have a room to carry you to initiation to believe this message right if God don't open your eyes is because something has blinded you your church system has blinded you that's right he say if our gospel be ha is ha to them that the God of this evil age has blinded are we together Ephesians chapter 4:8 let's try to close this thinging I hope you see where I'm coming from try to try to make this a tribute but but it it it became more more of just a tribute to me Ephesians chapter 4 you you can turn there kids you you get this thing off that that's the last quote I have to read Ephesians chapter 4:8 let's see what the Apostle Paul says here while we try to close this thing verse 17 he says this I said therefore and testified Ephesians 4:17 in the Lord that ye hence for walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darking being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of your heart you see what what what the blindness of the heart does that's the reason why fenny Crosby could be happy to be blind in her eyes and her heart is not blind the blindness of the heart it make your understanding darken praise the Lord it takes you away from God yes it's carrying you right down to the region of the L amen it filled your mind with vanity and it keep you in your ignorance praise the Lord it keep you in your ignorance that's why the blindness of the heart doors Peter will also say this we read this and then now you know when he talk talks about I I I I I read this yesterday if you can put that up for me 2 Peter 18 yesterday I I talk about this I say I says how how how P how beautiful you remember when he when he talks about the statute of the perfect man he said if these things be in you amen for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful it says a a a heal you from uh uh uh uh the the the mist of baroness okay that you will not be baring n on fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ verse 9 but he that lath these things is blind praise the Lord and when you are blind you are Also spiritually barren praise the Lord that's the mystery of our life the only one you can go to for answers is the one that you to be here praise the Lord is the one that have you to be here is the only one that you can go to we say it we talk it over God purpose is never defeated amen his purpose for our life can never be defeated that's what a prophet said that's what he taught us and he said it's only the things that serve God's purpose has a resurrection so anything in our life or that we are dealing with that looks like a mystery if it's a mystery ask God for answer yes sir and what to ask God is what's your purpose Lord what's your purpose praise the Lord what's your purpose what what is the purpose why why why you allow this they will always tell you that most accident happened on the street because of our blind spot amen most accident is either the person is not seeing that you are in their blind spot or the person is in your blind spot and you are not seeing it right glory be to God now as I feel like preaching my time is out amen it's now that I really feel like preaching my time is out I don't have time but thank you for bearing with me amen I just wanted to bring you to this place I have this whole uh uh fenny Crosby thing being on my mind and uh uh uh uh and then last night I look up I was looking for uh uh uh a day a word the word blind or the word uh physically imper it blind day uh and I find it that the celebrating in October the second Thursday they called it the worst sight day you know because now to use the word blind is not politically correct so it's the word side day is where we celebrate people that are physically imper praise the Lord but what a blessing what a blessing if God didn't not allowed us to see certain things or identify certain things at a certain time in our life life that was just blindness in part says oh why why didn't I know this now that you know it do something about it why should you for about the time that you did not know it now that you know it do something about it that's exactly what Jacob was talking about what different it would have made what different it will have made are we together the mystery blindness happen in part Paul goes down and he talks about the Redemption the Redemption of Israel which of course I will bring another piece to you that I saw there in in the life in the dreams of of Joseph I'll bring that peace to you later on and we will Fellowship around it I've taken much of your time this morning thank you for for for you know bearing with me this morning but that's what I want us to say what that's what I want if God allowed us uh if he allow illness in our life he want to prove himself as a Healer praise the Lord so if we have to go through a medical treatment or whatever we look to him for our healing it does not Rob God of healing he's the only healer that that we have are we together if anything come up mysterious for a Believer there is a Divine Purpose behind it there's a Divine Purpose behind it and for you to find the word of God is to be able to understand that Divine Purpose why did the Lord allowed this praise the Lord sir take the matter into your hand you take yourself into a Darkness yes you will get bitter you get angry you get ugly musicians you can come think about where fny crossby mind was when she sang the song pass me not oh gentle savior think about what you you try to imagine in your mind what was she thinking about when she sang that song Pass Me Now Gentle Savior hear my humble cry what was going through her mind we sing the song When We Are when we are dealing with our own trials pass me that why on others that are calling do not pass me by I believe she had an inspiration on her mind I believe there was something on her mind I believe there was something something that she was needing from the Lord I was trying to get the song but she wrote a song after she got safe the beautiful thing about it that she has she had this gift and she was writing songs and she was singing at Crusade and she was never safe [Music] I think it was after one Revival when she wrote the ssong must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the word Go free no there is a cross for everyone there is a cross for [Music] me if we can just get into the chamber with the Lord and let he start making his purpose known to us and start trying to help us to understand you will realize how much trouble he has saved you from maybe keeping you in a certain state or things that you were going through you [Music] realize that maybe your own choice might might have cost your life why he had to bring you through a certain family let's just sing that verse together now oh say say [Applause] yes savior oh yeah my humble cry

cist why on all th I call all not pass what a musician softly play now let's bow our heart together I believe each and every one of us here right now right this very moment there's a place in our life that we can see we can see [Music] why it does not mean that there is no answer to that but but for now we cannot understand why why am I in this condition why is this happening to me why is this around my life we we can understand it we are blind to to it we are blind to the to to the solution we are blind in part there's a blindness in part but every blindness in part is for a purpose every blindness in part there is a mystery there is something that God is working on there is something he he he has brought us to this place he has brought us to this place Jacob that's the reason why he reminded Joseph he told his son Joseph there was a time I came to that place when I met the angel of the Lord he could not understand why all of these things happening to him he he needed to meet the angel for the mystery to be unfold brother brandham came to that place he could not understand it until an angel came down and said I'm from the presence of almighty God to tell you about your
