be our portion today in the name of Jesus Christ anything contrary to your will in our life we neutralize at this moment let it be so father in Jesus mighty name we have prayed amen praise the Lord amen God bless you Saints and before you SE let's quickly read the Bible the book of Exodus 23 Exodus chapter 23 from verse 20 Exodus 23 from verse 20 I'll start reading behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the word and to bring thee in the place which I have prepared thew of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the etit and the parasites and the Canaanites and the evites and the jebusites and I will cut them off may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his holy word you can please be seated you are welcome to the house of the Lord this morning Bible told us that Believers will come to church but you know the devil will not want us to do that but we have more victory over Satan than you can ever imagine Satan is a defeated enemy he just trying to show us that is around but he can't do more than what God has allowed him to do and brethren we have power to cast him out and it will be so Hallelujah um I bring greetings from Lagos Nigeria from the pastor and from my family my wife and children that they all doing fine I hope you accept my greetings am Hallelujah I'm certainly happy to be in your midst this morning um I don't feel like a stranger I feel like at home Hallelujah and I know we are not strangers but we are fellow Pilgrim our destination is the same and by the special grace of God we will arrive Hallelujah because our God when he redeems he does it in two parts when he brings you out he must take you in there is no halfway job with our Lord and so a child of God can never be lost regardless of the storm no devil can pluck you out of the hand of God Amen so we are bound to arrive I want to encourage you to continue on the journey regardless of the storm and trials and Temptation they are meant to strengthen you in your journey hallelujah look at the tree when the storm rages shakes left and right what does it do it gains root downward and that's what he's doing for you don't try to strengthen you they give you the grace so have more trust in the Lord because our relationship with God Is A Love Affair and trust is very essential for love to progress so you must learn to trust God and you must learn to obey may the Lord help us so this morning we won't take too much of our time so many businesses when I don't believe too much words matter even a little word from my God will make all the difference so if it is just one or two I pray to do what he has to do Hallelujah this morning we are looking at the topic the angel of the Covenant the angel of the Covenant Hallelujah so I have a little quote here that I want to read Christ is the mystery of God revealed is only one Christ is the mystery of God revealed I'm reading um paragraph 629 Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 6-9 okay I will read it here to save our time it says Glory that angel of Covenant the one who was with Moses in the wilderness that one who come to Paul on the road to Damascus that same one permitted his picture to be taken with us the same one that was in the picture in the live magazine the one the other day the same word by the same God through the same channels by the same way by the same promise wherever two or three are gathered in my name I am there in their midst there he is here then he is here the angels of God are encamped about those who fear he hangs only to his word no man can respect that word without fearing God see then here he is in air this morning with us as we worship him in the spirit so Brethren the angel of Covenant we want to talk about this morning is here with us hallelujah so we are not talking about something in history but we are talking about the present thanks God soeren if you can just get a touch of him you will get your miracle today am Hallelujah you know Covenant was first mentioned in the Bible I think Genesis chapter 6 when God was talking to Noah you know after God has created man you know Bible told us that God repented him for doing that because the thought of man was continually evil you know and what happened what caused that because there was a mixed marriage you know that was the origin of the trouble you know children of God on one side Children Of Satan on the other side but you see when Daughters of men began to become so beautiful like we have it today you know the mo the most beautiful woman in 1960s I mean it's not even as good as somebody ordinary folk working on the street because Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and we are seeing it exactly today Hallelujah and that tells us that our covenant becomes renewed and Alive even at this time because Bible said where sin abound grace even abound much more Hallelujah so there is no way for the enemy to overcome all the angles have been covered by God you just find yourself in the world Hallelujah so he promised Noah that God told Noah you and and his family you are going to be saved because you found favor in my sight and then from Noah another man these are things that God does on his own that's why Bible told us salvation from Earth to glory is from God so if you are saved today it is God's hand it's not because you sought God Bible told us all have seen and fall short of the glory of God but when you find favor in God God will make make sure you are saved Hallelujah and that's why you are here seated today because God made sure of that another man Abraham Genesis 15 God called him he's just an ordinary person you know he did nothing exceptional just living like everybody lived in those days and then God singled him out Hallelujah why how did God do that the prophet told us that God call is by election amen so Those whom God has predestinated he has also elected amen and once he has elected them he will predestinate them to Eternal salvation the work has already been finished from the beginning Hallelujah that's why I'm telling you that the enemy cannot alter God's plan everything the enemy does is to make God's plan to come to real it amen oh you might look at it like oh this is very discouraging oh why is it happening but let me assure you it makes you closer to the God when he did that for job his intention was to make job to curse God and die but after the trials what happened to job he got more Revelation he knew that his redeemer live it Hallelujah he also knew that death is not his end because he knew that there'll be a resurrection and there'll be a Rapture and after that God doubled his wor amen so even though the enemy thought he was making a progress he never did it was only God that made progress in the life of Job and that's what will happen in your lives those challenges they will make you closer to God they will give you better Revelation they will give you more understanding and then you can even get more from God without faith it is impossible to please God and how do you know you have faith by those trials and Temptation amen so Abraham was just an idol worshiper and God called him get the out of your Kindred and go to a land that I will show you and Bible told us Abraham he obeyed he didn't even know where God was taking him to you know there was no Des destination if he was using Google Map he couldn't use it then because for you to use that map you must specify destination God is more than Google Map Hallelujah you must trust him some of us we trust those Maps but we afraid to trust God we should trust God hallelujah when it says you are healed believe you are he when you says by my stripes you are heal say Amen to it Hallelujah because it is so he told us if anybody is sick let him come for the elders the prayer of faith will heal the sick and if there have been any sin they shall even be forgiven once we have done what God's CA us to do let's leave it to God because if we finish the work amen he gave Abraham a promise and a covenant that is going to give him a land and his children there will be so many and Bible said at that moment he even have none that was nothing and he has been married for some time maybe about 50 years at that time but yet nothing but God said I'm going to give you your seed will be as innumerable as the stars of the sky and Abraham believed God and Bible said it was acced to him for righteousness as a result of that Covenant he told him your children they will sourn in a foreign land 400 years then after that I will bring them out with a mighty hand even though Abraham will have gone on his own yet God is ever faithful to his Covenant if God has given you a promise Brethren be assured God will keep it regardless of what you do Hallelujah and then on down when he came to time where we are read God realized the time is here and then God Called Moses we know the C of the call of Moses I believe Exodus 3 after God called him he moved into action and then he did all the 10 plages and all those miracles signs and wonders until those children they were able to come out of that foreign land but upon all those you know miracles signs you know and wonders because I mean because of the veil of Flesh we are always you know allowing this flesh to come in between us and our relationship with God don't forget when God created man there was no flesh there before you know Genesis God created man the sixth day and there was no man to till the ground it was in Genesis I think 2:7 that God created the physical man that we are see today and that physical man we call him the small boy because in the creation of things it was created last but you see he's always trying to become the boss you know and if you allow a baby to be your boss it will mislead you that's why we don't succumb to the power of Flesh Hallelujah we have to put it under subjection because he will not let don't see God the flesh is not your friend the prophet told us that the enemy of William Braham is William Braham and the same applies to all of us as long as we ELD to the flesh we cannot be in the spirit so it is honors on us to put the flesh constantly under subjection we must direct the small boy Hallelujah if you let the small boy direct you it will misdirect dtive because he's just young he doesn't know much Bible told us he only caral it belongs to the dust and that's why we know that the flesh will not go in Rapture when that moment come if you life you will be changed that's the promise we are given Hallelujah nobody is taking this body across the sky because it doesn't belong there it belongs here hey amen so Brethren when you know it belongs here and your journey is eternal you have Revelation you know how to treat it praise the Lord and so we are talking quickly about how God he called the children of Israel out of that Egypt and then they allowed the veil of Flesh to always come between them and their relationship with God you know when Moses the first experience they were theing of course it was a terrible situation you know they got to the brink of the rest sea there was no way to go looking back the enemy was coming left and right desert yes it could be very traumatic for anybody but God has always been with them Hallelujah no wonder Phillip I believe no no it was Steven in act seven he was when he was preaching he said who has received the Commandment of God by the disposition of angels and have not kept it you know because it was like God came down physically to this people to show them his way but what did they do majority of them only two enter the promised land are we together Joshua and Caleb every other person at that time they perished only their young ones made it there because of lack of faith amen and without faith it is impossible to please God all the blessings we have been enumerating and the ones we are going to talk about you can only obtain them through the hand of Faith that's the way God arranged it and that is the only way it will be amen so we saw they went through that and then it got to a time God said I will no longer go with you because if I go with you I'm going to destroy you because they constantly lusting after worldly things you know despite all the Miracles all the signs all the Wonders everything God has done even to their enemies still at the slightest opportunity let's go back to Egypt oh we are missing the onions and the garlics and the cucumber and the rest of them you know they don't want the glory of God just for those temporary things all because they are yielding to the flesh they cannot look beyond their sight Hallelujah and then in where we have read God now said what Moses cist said God you cannot leave us without you we have nothing so God said okay what I will do I will send my angel before you because physically my presence you know one time they told Moses it's not only you that know God we want to see God himself let God talk to us you I think I have a quote I hope time will tell me will allow me the prophet said God has always used the agency of man God don't use mechanical device maybe we should read it God in his people 1 15227 God in his people paragraph 23 can I read them no okay okay there he said God doesn't fall upon denominations God doesn't fall upon Mechanical Devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one m to believe another are we together very difficult do you believe that they couldn't believe Moses and God gave him two signs to prove to the people that he was sent from God for their Deliverance you believe that well isn't it the same yesterday today and forever do you believe the angel that talked to him in the in the burning bush is the Angel of the Covenant was that right all right is the same yesterday today and forever he's here now and he does the same things today that he did then yes and he still performs wonders and signs he is a miraculous God if you are trusting God for a miracle now God is here to do that you have to believe amen and he always works in a miraculous ways with signs and wonders so those things are not gone they are present believe God for yours he Pro and he promised them in these last days and we are living in the last days we got a right to expect them now so if you're in expectation you are right it will be met that's right to bring his people together so God has always used the agency of man not mechanical device to talk to people he only anoint man men upon men and he say he gave gift unto men some Apostles and the rest of them you know them so that they can do what they can speak for God those times those say we want to hear God directly it's not only Moses we are all holy and okay God said no problem prepare yourself three days this mountain God is going to come down let nobody touch it so they say we are ready we are all children of God Hallelujah of course we are all God's children but God places us positionally we have we are like the body every the leg cannot do the work of the hand I'm telling you if you try that you become something else you become a stranger man that people will run from but let's put things in their position and everything will work right so they said God speak to all of us God said okay I will do it and then in three days they were ready and before God could come down maybe God was just shining his shoe or something and then the old mountain was Smoky everywhere was thundering and then said they run we don't want to hear God again Hallelujah let Moses speak is enough and God said from that moment I'll do that Hallelujah so when you see a Vindicated man of God which you already got today he has the signs he has the Wonders he has a Vindication everything's in line with the one what will a Believer do we believe and then we will do what we see the glory of God hallelujah and so from that where we God now said now I'm going to send an angel before you we can read that when you get home he promised them many things I will cut off your enemies your children they will not cast their young you know so many promises but there is a condition you know you must stay in the land and that is in the word of God God told them if you obey my voice that's what God is still saying today we cannot say we are believers the prophet said if you say you believe and you don't do the word of God then you are not a Believer we must believe and act that is the meaning of being a Believer you know our lives the word of God that we are reing reading living by every day must reflect in our Liv lives so that when people see us they will glorify our Heavenly Father in Heaven Hallelujah and so all these things started the has always them represented by Pillar of Fire in the night and pillar of cloud in the day you know they are seeing those two signs today like the prophet said we have them photographed because we in the Third Exodus I believe we all know that and those things that happen then they will happen today we have James and jambers we will have K and the rest of them but yeah we still going to have Moses that will be Joshua that will be Caleb so it depends on the camp you belong and that will give you the blessings of the hour because Brethren the blessings are promised you know it's not we are serving God yes not because of what we can get but because we love him but there is something to get to praise the Lord when people ask him Master where we have left all what shall be our gain you know when that Rich Young Ruler when Christ loved him oh you have done everything saying he has kept the love from his Youth and all that and God say only one thing left all that you have said give to the poor and follow me because Christ knew that the wealth was his God and if you want to serve God you only serve him alone nothing must be between you and the Savior Hallelujah you must not put anything ahead of God because if you do that thing becomes your God and we see this man he cannot leave that mmon you know so he left sorrowfully and Peter said we we have left off some people think oh Peter he was a poor man you know Bible told us Peter was ignorant but Peter he didn't tell us Peter was poor because one time when we went to Jerusalem we saw where Peter lived you know and they told us it was in capam or somewhere where rich people live because the houses were built with some white stone and all that and that's why Peter could tell Christ who we have left all and Christ didn't say what did you leave are you not a poor man Christ agreed with him that he left and Christ say whoever have left all mother father whatever you have left you will get them in a 100 F here so there's a blessings here you know all the blessings we are talking about healing Miracles provision we don't need them in heaven it is here we need them so I encourage you increase your faith you need them here so that you don't live an underprivileged lives these things are available if it to are not so Christ will have told us but he said ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find because I'm here with you that's right Hallelujah he never left at any point in time the prophet even said sometimes when you grip the Holy Ghost is not far gone he just there because it's assigned to you it's for you Hallelujah Brethren let's exercise our faith praise the Lord you know when the Devil Comes Around The Devil is is a loser already let me assure you that he is a loser he has no the only role is here to play is to chase us to our Salvation everything he does makes us love God more Hallelujah so he's a frustrated fellow but he cannot be saved so we have no business with him he is an eternal enemy there is no compromise Hallelujah because some people maybe brother call them Universalist they believe that Satan will be saved and Satan can never be saved he can never repent if the sin is started in heaven will consume him eventually that's the way it is there's no solution because we have seen his end already and that's not going to change so for us we must keep matching on we should not give a thought to him don't let sympathize with him is an enemy Hallelujah so this our Brethren that we're talking about you know so at that time they decided oh God don't speak to us again use that man or any other man and then God promised them his Angel it will go with them and then we saw what the angel did with them you know through the Wilderness even though they didn't make their request know correctly sometimes when they wanted meat all they have to do is ask but what were they doing they were murmuring grumbling crying until Moses himself got fed up you know Moses went back to God and said oh God why did you hate me so much and you put all the burdens of these people like two million upon only me he said am I de father he said God kill me now go said what is the problem said they wanted meat what are I we going to provide meat for all of them and going Say by tomorrow tell them ah I'm going to give them meat God is still in the business of provision he is the same yesterday today and forever he said I will not just provide for tomorrow I'm going to provide for one month and M went back to go and said it appears you don't know what you are saying we have at least 600 foot men here what are we going to get meat for them and God told Moses who do you think we are talking to sometimes you don't know the God we are praying to oh we use our little imagination to make provisions and solutions God is way above that let me tell you he makes way where there are no ways he resolves issue there has been a testimony I think it happened in Ghana if I can recall a baby was born with um maybe without one limb the scan showed it and then Brethren prayed and this by the time the baby they went for the scan again the everything was perfect the baby we saw the the scan we saw when the baby was born and then the baby grew God is still in that business if you can believe then you will see the glory of God hallelujah and Moses told God this is practically not possible why are we going to make false promise to them we are no politicians God said go and tell them I'm going to do it do you think my hands are shut and God Did It by the next day Bible said qus as high as this on the ground Miles and Miles they head until they see you know you can eat meat until when you see meat you run they got to that stage because God no there's nothing possible before him and he promis us don't forget he's always in the midst of his people that's why we must keep our skates clean because the God is the only God if we want God to move in our lives in our homes we must create the atmosphere Hallelujah because God doesn't Force he has given all the instructions it is own us on us to obey them and when we obey them we will see the good of the land that's how he promised it and then through the period after he got them through to the promised land we saw that that angel of Covenant was still with them fighting battles for them we saw when they they wanted to cross I mean the the Jericho wall you know at that time that wall also can run a breast on it there was no way to bring that thing down but with God nothing shall be impossible the prophet heav with you if only you can believe Hallelujah and God gave the winning formula and we saw that Jero was fa and so every battle over time because God was keeping his Covenant that he made to their father Abraham even when Abraham was no longer there how much more what is making to you today Hallelujah and we saw let me read the seed shall not be here with the shock paragraph 32 Christ is that angel today he said like in the beginning God God dwelt alone because he was the Eternal one see wasn't even God in the the beginning God is an object of worship and the logos as we call it and the word that went out of God that anyone knows that that was the angel of the Lord or the word of the Lord that followed the Israelites through the Wilderness and the angel of the Covenant the logos that went out of God and then that logos was made flesh and dwelt Among Us us now we are in we are in St John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and now as he gave his life for us then his Spirit come back upon us Jesus said at that day you know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me see it's God all along God manifesting himself working himself through different ages so those three of Father Son and Holy Spirit same God working in three attributes and we today are one the church itself an attribute of God's thinking before the foundation of the world to have a church so those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning and that was his thought his thought is his attribute today after so many times then we got to the second Exodus that was a religion Christ leading the church out of a religion initially the first Exodus a nation out of another nation and Christ it was the fullness of godhead body so at that time you can't see pill of fire or anything because everything was Christ he told them before Abraham was I am they say who are you you are not even 50 years have you seen our Father Abraham said before even Abraham I am and you know what he told Moses when Moses said what is your name he said I am that I am Hallelujah and when Jesus answered he didn't say I was he said before then I am is always the I am the everpresent water from The Rock he is never is gone even in that situation is there present with you Hallelujah so Christ became the angel of Covenant in the New Testament and we saw the things he did Hallelujah there was no trouble that came in contact with Christ that wasn't soed he raised the dead right four days dead Lazarus you know magos and everything but that couldn't stand in the way of God I don't know your circumstance this morning or afternoon but they can't stand in the way of God the Devil May kind of magnify them to you but it can't stand before God hallelujah you just have to look through and believe that this my situation is not above my God after all don't see how big your problem is but see how big your God is and our god is so big if you don't know look at the Solar System look at the universe look at those Micky way androm media they are massive anything you see there they are millions of years away so when you see a St there probably you are seen 70 million years ago and that's God and see nothing before God that's how big our God is so how big can this your problem be that can be bigger than God it's not possible you just have to exercise the faith amen if you look at there was a time in Ezekiel what happened there God took Ezekiel to a valley and in that Valley the is full of dry bones bones that are completely dry you don't even know who died that the bone turned to that one it was a completely hopeless situation but God told ask Ezekiel can this bones rise Ezekiel I don't know because this is beyond imagination how can dry bones rise God said they will rise prophesy to them prophecy is the word of the Lord which you are even hearing today Hallelujah and he prophesy and Bible said there was a noise a shaking coming together s flesh upon flesh and then he said God said again the work is not done prophesy that the breath from the four corners of the earth coming to them and that happened and they became a mighty Army Hallelujah I don't think your situation can be that bad so whatever your situation this morning I'm here to announce to you that God is ready to solve it Hallelujah you just have to hold on you know the prophet told us in the sermon beting of God he said when you have done everything you should do like job did he sacrificed for the children made sure everything was correct yet the devil struck he said that time hold on that is the time to be certain of God because God is just waiting he has already solved the problem but he's just waiting Brethren don't give up hold on oh don't say oh this God is not my God is your god he knows your name he knows the number of your house and he has not forgotten you you are going to testify you are going to glorify his name Brethren hold on to Christ Hallelujah that's why because he wants to do more than we can even imagine amen but we limit God the prophet told us that God's great blessing is like a big store sometimes they in the next floor all you have to do is to reach to that ladder of Faith anything you that's why I say ask it didn't say ask money or ask good ask anything until your joy be full so you can keep asking God wants to be bothered don't say it's only me Let It Be only you ask him pray to him God this morning I need your leadership is not tired in the evening pray to him I need so so he's not tired the prophet said God wants to be bothered so bother him with your prayer bother him with your request bother him with your needs Hallelujah we should not suffer in silence when we have a god that has so much when we get to heaven we don't need them there are other things there do you remember I told the story of a man that was on a flight somebody purchased the ticket for him the way that want help me with my ticket you know he didn't know the value of what the ticket entails so he was seated you know and then when the time for uh refreshment came oh or drinks do you need need water coffee tea juice whatever said no no no food time came lunch this and I said no no no no I'm fine after a while time for the refreshment to land they came again meat Pine bread sausage you want I'm I'm fine next thing the pilot announced prepare to land passing your seat belt everything we are landing so as his colleague in the besid said my friend you are so rich that one was surprised what do you mean he say how are you able to pay for all those food that one was shocked your ticket covers it your ticket covers everything Brethren it is covered by my stripes you are here forgiveness of sin is covered provision is covered don't say oh my sin is too much it's not too much you say come though your sin be r as Crimson they shall be white as snow though they be red like a Scarlet I will make them whiter than wool all you have to do is to come Hallelujah everything is covered you are is not extra don't think you are the worst sinner even if you are Christ is waiting for you that's why he died otherwise Bible says scarcely with the righteous man we somebody die for a righteous man but Christ died for all of us because we cannot help ourselves Brethren God plan you that way so let's do it that way Hallelujah don't do it another way another way is not God's way let's come God's way that's the provided way Hallelujah Brethren Christ he came he became the captain of our Salvation you know everything we ever need the prophet told does once you have the Holy Ghost in you which Christ he told us that John 14 I'm going but I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm going to send the spirit of Truth unto you which is the holy spirit so all that Christ was he became Holy Spirit and if that is in you today you got all you ever need said all you ever need just like when you see a child from the womb everything that child needs all you need to do is a mother to eat correct food right the baby will grow they don't need to do surgery to attach the hand another surgery to attach the leg no everything the child will ever become is already in the child Hallelujah and when the baby is even born the growth is all there just provide the right atmosphere Brethren let the Holy Ghost be in you everything will be provided Hallelujah the only ghost is not just for Spiritual progress it is for all progress everything you need even the salvation of your family bring it under it Hallelujah look our check is an open check no spending limit I think they call it black card you can spend any amount no limitation let's spend it don't let's suffer in silence don't let's live under privileged lives God is able to do even beyond your widest imagination because Covenant is here I'm ready is in you Hallelujah he moved you know from beginning when he was not even God you know because God is an object of worship then he came he became a Loos and then on down Through the Ages he was showing himself in different Manner and then Christ came he said body has now prepared for me and then the same Christ say all power is given to me oh Hallelujah and what did he do to you and me Mark 17 say oh Mark 16:17 say now you have been given power cast out devils in sicknesses do what you want to do you have because once you adopted oh Hallelujah you know the story of adoption not English adoption now but the Eastern adoption we are in a child born in a home going through tooth Ag and once the child become matured and recommended by the tutor then he can do what the father can do he can act on behalf of the father it happened to Christ and we are little Christ on Mount Transfiguration he went there and a voice spoke this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him Hallelujah we should hear you today so that when you speak it's like God speaking that Breen that's the Journey of our life journey to become adopted because when you are born you've got to grow we cannot stay as an infant forever there must be growth and when growth occur we must become adopted then we get to the age of the spoken word which we are around now you know when God will do a short squeak work so that you can say oh there's dry land here you need rain I give you rain and you keep going and the rain will fall that's where we are going breing adoption where we can speak and God will perform Hallelujah Breen we need to prepare ourselves we need to get ready we need to keep our SK clean keep our home clean be ready have faith because God is ready to move amen that's why these words are coming and don't forget he said they'll be falling away first that's why you see some of those things you are saying do not be troubled let not your heart be troubled oh you see is there God oh is that God in this message God has not gone anywhere he's always in his word and he promis to be with you always am don't deviate all those things we are going to see them people will fall out you can say he's been there for 30 years it doesn't matter how long was Judas there for his apostleship was no less than that of Peter and yet he has his purpose oh may the Lord help us that our purpose should be to the glory of God because God it can never lose and if Christ is in you you can never lose the prophet said Christians don't lose head or ta you can't lose if the devil come disturb you God will take you he can't have you because the title did it cannot it's just an occupier you know there's something called owner occupier in building then there's also tenants there are SCS right they just take over you know but they don't have any title that's Satan for you it's just rush everybody because of the nature he Rush it's always rushing but first come it's not always the owner because the owner knows himself there's no rush when your time come God will show himself to you no matter how long gone you are when you hear that voice you will return hallelujah oh praise the Lord don't forget that eagle that was found in The Bard you know he was behaving like chicken but I couldn't do it well because from the beginning it wasn't a chicken and so I I know the mama chicken will be wondering what kind of strange stuff is this but anyway mother's instinct he has to take care of him but one day the real mother was flying oh Hallelujah and that was the day you came to Christ you have always been elected but your realiz ization came when you had that voice a when that small iglet had the voice all the other chicken R for cover but he was still there saying this look familiar oh Hallelujah that's why when you heard this message everybody say oh it's a CT it's he said no no no but this thing makes sense it's right there in the Bible I mean because he familiar to you because it's coming from your home Hallelujah just like as I am here now if somebody speaks yba anywhere I can hear there's no way I be I would kind of long to what what am I hearing and that's the way that igler was when she had it even though the others are running away but this things seems so normal Hallelujah and that boy said jump off said no I've never jump off my life that's many what all many of us say oh I've never tried it before but you are in him the pr say we are his attribute it seems you have never tried it before but you are part of the system Just Launch out you will realize it's normal Hallelujah having faith in God is normal receiving Miracles is noral signs and wonders Bible said to follow us we are not seeking for signs and wonders oh they are doing miracle there that's not our business we are following the world then the signs will follow us they must that's what the word says and that one day he tried it the mother said just a little flap you will be up there Brethren a little fith oh breath a prayer of faith when you face those storing situation they are not to destroy you that's not the purpose you are the bride of Christ and no man will allow his bride to suffer it doesn't happen of course that could be abnormal situation but not with God hallelujah he told us we his bride even the bride will not go through tribulation all those trials and stuff just to make you better to put you in a position to receive more blessings from God what is God doing with those blessings what is he doing with the Holy Ghost it's for you and me so it's God to put you in shape to receive them Hallelujah that's why all these things happen because God have these things in store you know it's not for storage it's for our use let's stretch the hand of Faith Breen oh don't say oh my needs are small ask God oh they are too big ask God because he's there to answer them Hallelujah and then we saw what Christ did all through his own time you know we said all problem that came to Christ they got solved Hallelujah they go when they reached Christ that was the end regardless of how complex or unimaginable they were and he told us he has given us the same power Hallelujah and we saw Men Who are filled with the Holy Ghost they exercise that power that was the time Peter I think and John they went to the temple and there was a there a known he has always been there and Bible say looked at them expecting something you know that's his man wasn't expecting Miracle because probably he has given up or he has not seen somebody healed before but said oh look on us silver and gold we don't have but we got something brethren we have something oh you have more than gold in your hand you just don't know oh may the Lord help us give us Revelation to know who you are you know the prophet told us I think in the exposition of the seven churches he said if the Church of God can know which she is and that she's ordained to do the Greater Works he say she will become an inv vincible Army Hallelujah this morning know yourself Hallelujah and then look on US silver and gold we don't have but such as we have we will give you in the name of Jesus rise up and walk and Bible said they helped him up and then he was limping and jumping because Christ already in them that angel of Covenant tabernacled in them and they were doing even prison couldn't hold them are we together nothing can stop somebody who has Christ in himself oh you can say but there are so many sicknesses in the world if we are that powerful why can't we heal them you must have faith to receive that is the principle of receiving it's not just even though sometimes your faith can be enough to extend to somebody else but God said Let It Be unto you according to your faith that's the principle so this morning or afternoon increase your faith so that you can receive more from this angel of Covenant because he's here with us he even told us where two or three are gathered in his name right there in their mid it will be not just to record our actions but to perform the Miracles is known by if God can give the word it can also give the healing if God gives you salvation it can give you a life partner if he gives you a life partner he can give you fruit of the womb it can give you good job he told us that if any man does not work he should not eat all you have to do is to remind him his promise I'm ready to walk give me the right one and he in that business Hallelujah I don't I don't want to run beyond my note I have a testimony here you know what I would just say the prophet told us that to show that the angel of Covenant was with us he talked about a man whose son caught a disease you know and then everything is pointing to death including the cardiogram and everything and so the brother said oh if the prophet can just come and pray I believe God will do something this afternoon what do you believe do you believe that if you can ask God anything this afternoon God will do it then it will be so amen and so the prophet go there you know the situation was scary the child was sorry everything the the reading was going down and going down and then they prayed the prophet prayed that's all a simple word of prayer and in faith and then the parent were jubilating God has done it God has done it you know that's the expression of Faith you know the prophet told us that what people see is a work work is the faith expressed but what God sees is the faith so if people are seeing work God is seeing faith is the two side of the same coin you are going to show your work to demonstrate that you have faith yes this couple they were already thanking God God you have he him Hallelujah and they were happy and the nurse nurse asked to call them Papa Mama sit down it appears you don't have the full understanding of what is happening and she explained to them that once the cogram get to so so so level is as good as dead they say oh thank you we appreciate this is your training that's what you are trained to read but we we are trained to look with the eyes of Faith Hallelujah prophet testified that that child was ill and he has even gotten married so I don't know how terrible your situation be or somebody you know maybe sick or anything they shall be healed Hallelujah you can stand in the gap for them they don't even have to be here I have a testimony to there was a time one of our uncle he lives in the US here they sent us a message he C he wanted to go to the toilet or the bathroom then he collapsed on the way it was bleeding everything they don't even know what to do the first call they made to us he said this is situation pray Brethren that person is still alive today since serving the lord we prayed in the morning when the day broke they took him to the hospital by the in short before the noon of that day was back in his house doing what he has to do because God such prayer distance is not a barrier all you need is Faith Hallelujah we are talking about the angel of Covenant that was with them in the wilderness who became Christ and the Holy Ghost in you today Hallelujah and we are saying what he did then he can do even today and there is no limitation the only limitation that can exist is your lack of faith and that's why my only thing I'm doing this afternoon is to encourage you to have faith in God because the devil don't forget we must not be oblivious of all his actions because he understand that he's on his last run we in the last stage so he's bringing in all his weapons every possible weapon are now in use but the Bible told us that we should be careful because Christ has overcome the world he told us we are more than conqueror through him that loved us so regardless of whatever weapon the enemy is deploying is just wasting his time we are going from Victory onto Victory Hallelujah from anointing to anointing from promotion to promotion oh why the prophet said why is so hard for people to live a Christian life because they are trying to do it themselves you know they are looking at all the problems oh this look onto the author and finisher of your faith he is the one that promis and is the one that will perform that's right Hallelujah Brethren the angel of Covenant is in you today he in you and with that in you you can face all opposition hallelujah hallelujah the prophet told us of an experience a man you know he was always carrying the Bible but he can't even from so somebody told him why do you always carry this Bible you don't even know how to read he said well there are two things first I want people to know that I believe every word of the Bible including the Holy Bible written in the front secondly I want people to know the side I am on Hallelujah let them know I'm a Christian you know Bible said let your your moderations be known to all men for the Lord is at turn so the man said okay if we can
