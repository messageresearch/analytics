[40:45] rest of the year for me to be able to
[40:47] finish it praise the Lord First Timothy
[40:50] chapter 3 let's read from verse 14.
[40:53] let's read this uh conscious word of the
[40:56] Apostle Paul these things right are on
[41:00] today
[41:01] hoping to come onto the Short Lane

[41:11] altered to behave thyself
[41:13] in the house of God
[41:15] which is the Church of the Living God
[41:18] the house of God is the Church of the
[41:21] Living God
[41:22] is the pillow
[41:24] and ground of Truth
[41:28] and with our controversy greed is the
[41:30] mystery of godliness God was manifested

[42:39] one thing I learned is they are there
[42:41] you learn to thank God for the things
[42:43] that he has done then there is more for
[42:46] him to do amen praise the Lord if we're
[42:49] always waiting for what is done to thank
[42:52] the Lord then we we linger our
[42:55] expectation but if we keep praising him
[42:57] for what he has done and uh and uh it is
[43:02] it is a conscious art to know that
[43:04] he's he's working amen he's doing he's
[43:08] he's doing things presently so the Lord
[43:10] bless you you may have your seat and uh
[43:14] so tonight I would just I would just
[43:16] take my time I'm I'm I know uh we we
[43:20] gotta get we gotta get out of the crazy
[43:23] amen we got to make our Prison Break
[43:26] amen we got to make our prison break we
[43:29] were talking about uh uh uh you know
[43:33] getting our ourselves out of this
[43:35] praising the Rapture is going to be our
[43:37] greatest Prison Break amen
[43:40] but until we can go to that I believe
[43:42] that the Lord there with us this weekend
[43:44] greatly with his word praise the Lord I
[43:48] mean we were so capture under the Holy
[43:49] Spirit when the service and I was
[43:51] looking at a time I said oh mine it felt
[43:54] like it was just it was just 30 minutes
[43:56] amen praise the Lord
[43:59] I was reading something during the week
[44:00] I can't remember the name of the person
[44:03] he says uh uh he says no matter how long
[44:07] you preach as long as it's fair as it is
[44:10] fair like 20 minutes he said that is an
[44:13] effective preaching
[44:16] no matter how long you preach praise the
[44:19] Lord you could preach 20 minutes and it
[44:21] feels like four hours
[44:23] amen but if you can hold the people for
[44:27] two three hours and it just feel like 30
[44:29] minutes then which means that is an
[44:32] effective preaching the Holy Spirit was
[44:35] dealing with the preacher and the Holy
[44:37] Ghost was also dealing with the people
[44:39] praise the Lord
[44:40] amen
[44:43] you know what program says uh you know
[44:49] a successful preaching should be about
[44:52] uh uh 45 minutes he says uh
[44:59] uh 20 million ceremonies almost like an
[45:02] eight hours labor you know well so
[45:07] all of that but we thank the Lord amen
[45:10] so tonight uh we read about that
[45:14] policies the Church of the Living God he
[45:18] says which uh the house of God which is
[45:21] the Church of the Living God the pillow
[45:23] in the ground of Truth now they're
[45:26] they're pillow and ground of Truth uh
[45:30] something came to my mind I was I was
[45:33] uh
[45:35] meditating Monday morning
[45:37] and reading the scriptures and just and
[45:40] just looking at some of the few things
[45:42] uh uh from my notes in and something
[45:45] came up to me uh
[45:48] uh and then it drew my mind into where I
[45:52] want to go tonight
[45:54] and then uh so I sent I I sent a
[45:57] WhatsApp message to brother because he
[46:00] left her left the house so I dropped it
[46:02] to the airport about four a.m in the
[46:04] morning
[46:04] and then uh so little on I sent him a
[46:08] text message when he told me that he
[46:10] arriving and I shared that with him and
[46:13] there was something from
[46:18] first king
[46:20] about the Tabernacle uh there were two
[46:23] pillows now you can see the pillow of
[46:26] Truth the pillow and ground of Truth so
[46:28] you see where my mind went to pillow
[46:30] because I was looking at those two
[46:32] pillows in the Tabernacle that was that
[46:35] was named after two individuals Jacob
[46:38] and the other person was Boaz they were
[46:41] on the porch of of Solomon Temple
[46:44] they were now holding the building they
[46:46] were just there for faction
[46:50] but yet they gave them two names
[46:53] and uh not only for faction I would also
[46:56] believe that they were there by Divine
[47:00] uh inspiration praise the Lord
[47:04] so that's I I want us to look at that
[47:07] and go and the reason why is because of
[47:10] uh brother Daly spoke to us on Sunday on
[47:14] the Council of the Lord and uh the
[47:18] counsel of the Lord I was I was looking
[47:21] at that from the Greek it means a deep
[47:26] extreme poverty
[47:28] and deep things of God the Deep things
[47:31] of God things hidden amen especially
[47:36] Divine counsel to make deep
[47:39] now so the the counsel of God
[47:43] you know is is uh is is more than just
[47:49] being counseled by a Godly Man it means
[47:52] the full truth of God it means the
[47:55] entirety
[47:57] of of the thoughts of God for our age
[48:01] for our day praise the Lord amen that's
[48:04] the reason why we are taught to run it
[48:06] through from Genesis to Revelation and
[48:09] uh uh and it should be able to come out
[48:12] through the message of the hour
[48:14] uh as as an as an instruction of God
[48:18] so uh
[48:21] uh and then these these two pillows
[48:26] uh
[48:28] let me do something tonight I sent I
[48:31] sent too much information back there for
[48:34] the Wednesday night
[48:37] I send too much information back there
[48:39] for the Wednesday night
[48:42] but uh
[48:44] if I can
[48:55] if I can get into my now
[48:59] Tabernacle pictures Temple pictures
[49:04] oh thank you Jesus
[49:08] thank you Jesus if I can get into my
[49:10] temple pictures
[49:12] and uh
[49:15] if you just caught the light off for us
[49:17] thank you
[49:21] okay
[49:22] since I'm that this is not my my style
[49:25] so you can see that I don't have no uh
[49:28] laser light here but this is the Old
[49:31] Testament Tabernacle this is uh the
[49:34] Tabernacle that Moses built okay thank
[49:36] you
[49:38] thank you sir
[49:40] okay
[49:41] this is the Tabernacle that Moses built
[49:44] uh Genesis Exodus 25 this is how it will
[49:48] look you have in the author of sacrifice
[49:51] the lava for watching and then here is
[49:55] the Tabernacle and uh
[50:01] and there is the Tabernacle
[50:04] and then if we just if we can just move
[50:06] to another picture
[50:09] okay so I wrote this down here because a
[50:12] lot of it is there in Leviticus and when
[50:14] I was when I got captured to to the
[50:16] thought I went to to be able to get some
[50:19] images just to to to to be able to
[50:22] capture our mind but the Tabernacle is
[50:25] one of the subject in the Bible that
[50:28] that God took a lot of time in the Book
[50:31] of Leviticus there are a lot of details
[50:35] he gives the measurement
[50:38] okay he gives the measurement now you
[50:41] will see that God taking the time just
[50:45] like the act of Noah Bill he just didn't
[50:48] tell Noah Bill and Ark he give Noah the
[50:52] detail right
[50:54] the measurement for every piece
[50:58] praise the Lord amen and I call into
[51:01] measurement the Tabernacle and the Ark
[51:03] of Noah was the same length according to
[51:06] to measurement now
[51:09] God took a lot of time you know the the
[51:12] structure the furniture the preschool
[51:15] the offering you know everything about
[51:18] the Tabernacle now the reason why he did
[51:22] that is because there are a lot of
[51:25] things from the mind now just imagine
[51:28] now he's telling Moses build this
[51:30] Tabernacle I call him to the vision
[51:34] praise the Lord I call into the vision
[51:36] of the party now Moses saw the pattern
[51:40] but Moses never had the details
[51:43] so God has to come down and give him the
[51:46] details give him the measurement you
[51:49] read The Book of Leviticus you will see
[51:50] cubic and uh you know God just give him
[51:54] every measurement of the Tabernacle so
[51:57] there's there's a reason there's a
[51:59] reason because this Tabernacle is going
[52:02] to go to the temple and and then the
[52:05] temple is going to come to our body as a
[52:09] Dwelling Place of the Living God is
[52:11] going to go to the four square City and
[52:14] is going to go to the millennial Temple
[52:16] and then to the four square City and all
[52:18] of that so uh there's there's one of the
[52:21] reason let's move to our our next
[52:23] picture
[52:25] thank you so uh uh it's kind of a spread
[52:30] out in a little bit it kind of for
[52:32] spread out uh
[52:34] uh the the menorah year is uh the the
[52:38] seven lamps
[52:40] here is the seven line here is the the
[52:43] table or shop red and the golden Altar
[52:46] and then back here the holiest of holy
[52:50] is where the Ark of the Covenant is uh
[52:54] and then we will move to the next one
[52:57] praise the Lord thank you now so there
[53:00] were three three major things that we
[53:03] made now if you look in the book where
[53:06] Paul was talking about uh uh uh him
[53:10] being the master builder
[53:12] okay you realize that Paul
[53:15] named six things he talked If any man
[53:19] bear with gold silver or precious stones
[53:21] then he came to hell and he he and he
[53:25] named uh three other efflict things that
[53:29] can be destroyed by fire he said every
[53:32] man work will be travel fired so Paul
[53:34] took three precious stones of the Old
[53:38] Testament Tabernacle and then he took
[53:40] three other things that were not
[53:42] precious stones that will be destroyed
[53:44] by fire just to be able to make his
[53:46] picture but these were the three uh uh
[53:50] uh pressure
[53:51] uh melters that were used in the
[53:55] Tabernacle now we know that browse
[53:57] represents judgment because it can
[54:00] handle fire and the beautiful thing
[54:02] about it did is that this bride was
[54:07] everything that was on the outside of
[54:10] the Tabernacle
[54:13] everything on the outside of the
[54:15] Tabernacle was Bryce
[54:16] praise the Lord I'm beginning to enjoy
[54:19] every time you see me take up my coat
[54:21] I'm beginning to enjoy
[54:22] amen the Lord has come to my help
[54:27] so the price it was on the outside of
[54:30] the Tabernacle
[54:32] the inside of the Tabernacle was all
[54:35] gold
[54:37] praise the Lord
[54:39] which is deity
[54:42] favor
[54:45] if you really Leviticus
[54:47] every saver was
[54:51] was uh
[54:54] how can I call it
[54:58] everything that was sitting
[55:00] sat in silver
[55:04] everything that was sitting the the legs
[55:08] of the tables were in silver
[55:12] praise the Lord everything that was
[55:15] sitting sat in several yeah
[55:21] praise the Lord so savior represent
[55:24] blood Redemption
[55:26] okay it represents Redemption
[55:29] you know so uh uh God designed it their
[55:33] way you know that will be sitting even
[55:36] even uh the the Old Testament the
[55:39] Redemption money was in silver 30
[55:42] shakers and as it seemed 30 pieces that
[55:45] Jesus was betrayed for
[55:48] so in Leviticus that was the Redemption
[55:50] money what that money was used for you
[55:53] have to remember that the the first bone
[55:55] Belongs to the Lord
[55:58] amen God claimed all the firstborn after
[56:01] all the firstborn in Egypt were killed
[56:04] all the firstborn Belongs to the Lord
[56:06] now so what if uh if uh if uh if uh a
[56:12] family has a firstborn it belongs to the
[56:14] Lord now if they are first born will
[56:17] come now you have to realize that God
[56:19] traded the Levites for the firstborn
[56:23] because it was on it was not all the
[56:25] first born that was serving in the
[56:27] Tabernacle it was only the Levites right
[56:30] praise the Lord so then the the first
[56:34] born will now redeem you had to come up
[56:37] with a uh 30 pieces of of of of uh save
[56:41] a coin to redeem your firstborn so you
[56:43] you gave them money you gave your first
[56:45] bomb back so that was the Redemption
[56:47] money
[56:48] now where am I going with this let's go
[56:54] now so uh the price was on the outside
[56:58] uh gold was on the inside everything in
[57:03] the Tabernacle was made of gold
[57:05] praise the Lord
[57:07] amen the outside was made of brides it
[57:11] can it can handle the Judgment of God
[57:13] our body you know there is no temptation
[57:17] that comes upon us that we cannot bear
[57:21] that's what the scripture says amen
[57:23] because we are made of brides we can
[57:27] handle the body can handle sickness can
[57:29] handle you know and all of that but
[57:31] inside pressure stones and uh made out
[57:35] of gold and then uh Savor was was also
[57:42] representing Redemption everything was
[57:45] sitting in silver Redemption is a thing
[57:50] that is driving the plan of God
[57:54] Redemption that is the thing that is
[57:57] driving the plan of God Redemption
[57:59] Redemption should be influencing
[58:01] everything we are doing not judgment
[58:05] amen not judgment
[58:09] Redemption blood
[58:11] should be influencing all our decisions
[58:15] I'm going somewhere with you tonight
[58:18] now so uh the next picture that will be
[58:21] that will be the last one here I know I
[58:23] won't get through everything now this is
[58:25] the Temple of Solomon not the Tabernacle
[58:29] the first picture we saw was the
[58:31] tabernacle this is the Temple of Solomon
[58:34] it had little changes they kept the the
[58:39] the the format of the Tabernacle the the
[58:42] Holiness of holy the Ark of the Covenant
[58:44] was stayed here the holy Place
[58:47] uh was uh was still the same and this is
[58:52] the auto call but here in the outer core
[58:55] they put something there which was the
[58:58] porch the porch of of uh of Solomon
[59:04] praise the Lord the push of the Temple
[59:07] of Solomon let me call it the Posh of
[59:09] the Temple of Solomon now Solomon pulls
[59:11] but the temple porch amen then on the
[59:14] porch of uh of the of the temple they
[59:18] had these two pillows
[59:20] they had these two pillows now you have
[59:23] to realize Paul says to the New
[59:26] Testament Church
[59:28] that uh the church is the pillow
[59:33] in the ground of Truth
[59:37] praise the Lord
[59:38] amen
[59:41] I can I can dwell on that and keep us
[59:43] the whole night but I just want to I
[59:46] want to go this is just an introduction
[59:48] we'll come back to it
[59:50] so we are here here uh they have the two
[59:53] pillow one was named ah after Jacob and
[59:58] the other one was named after Boaz
[1:00:01] am I dwell on that tonight
[1:00:04] and uh yeah you get a molten seed they
[1:00:08] have the uh the lavash here and uh which
[1:00:13] of course also later on it was is being
[1:00:16] caught by the Jews the Holocaust altar
[1:00:19] and then outside year there was another
[1:00:23] thing that was also uh added to Solomon
[1:00:28] Temple to the temple that was now part
[1:00:30] of the Tabernacle this was a place of
[1:00:34] personal storage
[1:00:36] for the priests
[1:00:38] that was where they were keeping the uh
[1:00:42] their things will come to death because
[1:00:45] just like I said the temple
[1:00:48] the Tabernacle to the temple
[1:00:52] to the dwelling place of God our body
[1:00:55] they all have their representation
[1:00:59] praise the Lord
[1:01:01] so it is it is almost like God was
[1:01:04] aiming to dwell in US
[1:01:07] but then he started to give us a picture
[1:01:09] how he would prepared
[1:01:12] to come and do it in US
[1:01:15] so the Tabernacle uh the Tabernacle was
[1:01:19] was the curtains in the Tabernacle was
[1:01:22] made out of skin
[1:01:24] the Badgers came you know the different
[1:01:27] skin was the curtains and different
[1:01:29] things you know and then uh uh
[1:01:33] you know well
[1:01:36] follow up and move to an exhale put it
[1:01:38] down down the the the the
[1:01:42] Temple was different they couldn't move
[1:01:44] the temple it was built
[1:01:46] it was now built it was now strong it
[1:01:50] was now established
[1:01:53] now so this is the thing that caught
[1:01:56] caught my mind yeah these two pillows
[1:02:00] here because one is uh Jacob which means
[1:02:05] Council
[1:02:07] but but dealer was talking on the
[1:02:10] Council of God that's what caught my
[1:02:11] mind that's what brings us to where we
[1:02:13] are tonight it's called establish in
[1:02:16] Council
[1:02:18] and Boaz is strength
[1:02:23] so God established the Tabernacle in
[1:02:27] Council and strength
[1:02:31] praise the Lord
[1:02:33] so the Tabernacle year is is established
[1:02:37] in all that's that's the reason why Paul
[1:02:40] in the New Testament can say is that the
[1:02:42] Church of the Living God is the Pillar
[1:02:45] of Truth
[1:02:46] the pillow and the ground of Truth
[1:02:51] not only what we believe but what we
[1:02:54] live
[1:02:55] and what we speak
[1:02:57] the scripture say lie now one unto
[1:02:59] another let your year be yeared and your
[1:03:02] name
[1:03:03] because the Church of the Living God the
[1:03:07] pillow of the the pillow and the ground
[1:03:09] of Truth so one of that
[1:03:14] a pillow that was standing there was
[1:03:17] representing the counsel of God and the
[1:03:19] other one was representing the strength
[1:03:21] of God
[1:03:23] praise the Lord
[1:03:25] and uh so
[1:03:28] uh
[1:03:31] now when you when you come to think
[1:03:34] about that you come to think about their
[1:03:36] life like like I said to you I'm trying
[1:03:39] to to share with you uh
[1:03:44] some of the things I wrote from the from
[1:03:46] the services on it is bringing me to a
[1:03:48] place because as I was looking at uh
[1:03:53] as I was looking at these two pillows uh
[1:03:57] uh being established in Council and
[1:04:00] strength
[1:04:01] it brought my mind to something uh
[1:04:06] Isaiah chapter 11 let's read Isaiah
[1:04:09] chapter 11.
[1:04:13] let's read Isaiah chapter 11.
[1:04:19] how how could I forget about this
[1:04:22] and uh I think you realize that uh the
[1:04:26] the fans are not blowing tonight
[1:04:29] praise the Lord
[1:04:31] the angel of the Lord that Hank around
[1:04:33] this building
[1:04:35] help to repair the air condition
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:39] ER
[1:04:44] and we want to thank the Lord for that
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:47] praise the Lord
[1:04:50] a brand new one was going to cost us
[1:04:52] close to 20 000 or Plus
[1:04:55] and for all the works that was going to
[1:04:57] be done so uh
[1:05:01] I think the Lord want us to be to be
[1:05:03] prepared before we
[1:05:06] we get there but we hope that the Lord
[1:05:08] will be able to work it amen
[1:05:10] and uh brother Jordan sent someone over
[1:05:13] to come and look at the zoning system
[1:05:15] and all of that and and after he
[1:05:18] realized everything is working and
[1:05:19] founding and he was leaving he says well
[1:05:21] can I just check your acid and see what
[1:05:24] is going on and I said yeah you you go
[1:05:26] ahead praise the Lord
[1:05:30] and uh you know I just I just I was just
[1:05:35] I was I was sitting back there uh
[1:05:37] standing a little bit
[1:05:39] yesterday then I just said Lord if you
[1:05:42] can just figure this thing out and and
[1:05:44] save us that money
[1:05:46] praise the Lord and then he came back he
[1:05:48] says I think I know what's happening
[1:05:50] and uh and he was able to work on it and
[1:05:53] all of that so
[1:05:55] we hope that it would just hold up
[1:05:57] praise the Lord
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:01] so we want to thank the Lord for that
[1:06:05] I want to thank the Lord for that
[1:06:12] did I lost my top
[1:06:15] Isaiah chapter 11.
[1:06:20] Isaiah chapter 11.
[1:06:28] now let's read from verse 1.
[1:06:32] Isaiah chapter 11.
[1:06:37] and there shall come forth a roll out of
[1:06:41] the steam of Jesse and a branch shall
[1:06:44] grow out of his root Jesus was called
[1:06:48] the root and The Offspring of David
[1:06:51] so that's what is coming from amen
[1:06:55] verse 2.
[1:06:58] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[1:07:01] upon him
[1:07:03] the spirit of wisdom
[1:07:06] and understanding
[1:07:08] the spirit of counsel and might now so
[1:07:13] studying on the Council of the law that
[1:07:15] was preached to us on the on Sunday that
[1:07:18] structure caught my mind
[1:07:20] as I was reading through it that uh yes
[1:07:25] the prophecy of Jesus Christ and he was
[1:07:27] going to come with the spirit of wisdom
[1:07:30] and the spirit of understanding the
[1:07:33] spirit of counsel the spirit of Might

[1:08:13] attention the spirit of Might
[1:08:17] praise the Lord amen
[1:08:21] now where it got my attention is that
[1:08:23] you remember we were talking about the
[1:08:26] word of God Shepherd in a two-edges
[1:08:28] swore and and we we showed through the
[1:08:31] scripture and the message brother
[1:08:33] Branham says that little compartment
[1:08:34] where there is where blood do not uh
[1:08:37] temper with there in the heart he says
[1:08:39] that's where the sold words of men and
[1:08:42] that's where the word of God goes now
[1:08:44] the scripture says Lord the Lord thy God
[1:08:47] with all of your height
[1:08:49] all of your height your heart not height
[1:08:54] praise the Lord

[1:09:19] yeah praise the Lord now as I was
[1:09:22] looking at that it will it will shock
[1:09:24] you to know that there's a difference
[1:09:26] between strength and energy
[1:09:31] right sure
[1:09:33] praise the Lord
[1:09:36] yeah the Bible says he's coming with the
[1:09:38] spirit of Might
[1:09:43] he's the Almighty
[1:09:45] he's releasing himself to you as might
[1:09:51] when the Bible talks about he that
[1:09:54] endureth that's where that word from
[1:09:58] is a strength of God that makes you to
[1:10:01] endure
[1:10:02] that makes you to bear
[1:10:04] the body is weak
[1:10:08] but the spirit is what willing

[1:10:45] mind of Christ
[1:10:48] that's not the mind of Christ
[1:10:52] that should not be the attitude of the
[1:10:54] believer

[1:13:32] us above that
[1:13:34] praise the Lord
[1:13:37] amen I'm just I'm just sharing my my
[1:13:39] notes with you I've not even started
[1:13:42] preaching tonight amen
[1:13:44] first Samuel chapter 15 let's read that
[1:13:48] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:13:51] verse 29 I hope I got the right uh uh
[1:13:57] scripture for that
[1:14:01] but the Bible says God was called the
[1:14:04] strength of Israel
[1:14:06] he was their strength
[1:14:09] praise the Lord
[1:14:12] Jesus told Paul my strength is made
[1:14:15] perfect in your weakness
[1:14:21] he was the strength of Israel
[1:14:25] first Samuel chapter 15 verse 29.
[1:14:30] and also the strength of Israel will not
[1:14:33] lie nor repent for he
[1:14:36] is not a man the strength of Israel is
[1:14:39] not a man the strength of Israel is not
[1:14:43] human strength
[1:14:46] are we together
[1:14:49] the same God that is the strength of
[1:14:51] Israel he is our strength
[1:14:55] that's what we can say I'm strong
[1:14:59] praise the Lord
[1:15:01] amen
[1:15:02] now realize it's not it's not uh you
[1:15:05] know all of these uh uh uh energy to run
[1:15:09] from here to to your house to Nino
[1:15:12] it is it is that inner strength
[1:15:16] praise the lord we sing the song
[1:15:18] something keeps holding me
[1:15:22] in John chapter 3 verse 16
[1:15:27] the the same thing is used is called the
[1:15:30] the strength of Israel but it means the
[1:15:32] stronghold
[1:15:36] their strength means their stronghold
[1:15:42] so the scripture says Lord the Lord thy
[1:15:45] God with all of your strength
[1:15:48] foreign
[1:15:52] praise the lord lord the Lord your God
[1:15:54] with all of your strength
[1:15:56] with all of your heart all of your soul
[1:15:59] all of your mind
[1:16:02] and uh and all of your strength so we
[1:16:05] realize here that uh
[1:16:11] uh
[1:16:14] my friend is made perfect weakness we
[1:16:17] deal with that uh
[1:16:21] Moses said that in Deuteronomy 6 5 love
[1:16:25] the Lord with all of uh the Lord God
[1:16:27] Israel is one and you have to love him
[1:16:30] with your heart your soul your mind and
[1:16:33] your strength
[1:16:35] praise the Lord
[1:16:37] over the Edison might in the New
[1:16:40] Testament it says strength
[1:16:42] now so uh
[1:16:49] as we look at that I'm trying to run
[1:16:51] through
[1:16:52] through my notes Here quickly now
[1:16:58] praise the Lord are we together
[1:17:01] are we together
[1:17:03] are you with me tonight have I lost you
[1:17:07] no no okay
[1:17:08] so Revelation chapter 1 verse 4.
[1:17:21] Revelation chapter 1 verse 4.
[1:17:25] because they have
[1:17:27] a few minutes I can I can start up here
[1:17:30] Revelation chapter 1 verse 4.
[1:17:36] in Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 chapter
[1:17:38] 3 verse 1 chapter 4 verse 5 and chapter
[1:17:42] 5 verse 6. the scripture talks about the
[1:17:46] seventh spirit
[1:17:48] which are Before the Throne
[1:17:53] amen it talks about the seventh spirit
[1:17:59] Revelation chapter 1 verse four let's
[1:18:01] read that
[1:18:03] together
[1:18:05] John to the seventh Church Ages which
[1:18:08] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[1:18:12] from him which is and which was and
[1:18:15] wishes to come and from the seventh
[1:18:18] Spirit which are before his throne
[1:18:22] amen Revelation chapter 3 1
[1:18:26] if we can go through there too
[1:18:35] and we can go through that and unto the
[1:18:37] angel of the church or scientists right
[1:18:39] these things say he that have the
[1:18:42] seventh spirit of God
[1:18:44] Jesus introducing himself to this church
[1:18:46] age as he that have the seventh spirit
[1:18:49] of God and their seventh ties I know
[1:18:52] that work that they are
[1:18:55] had a name that they are living and they
[1:18:58] are dead but we are looking at the
[1:19:01] seventh spirit and you go in the other
[1:19:03] verses four verse 5 5 Verse 6 you will
[1:19:05] see there are seven Spirit what is the
[1:19:08] seventh spirit
[1:19:10] that's why we want to look at a little
[1:19:12] bit brother Branham talks about it
[1:19:15] but uh I want us
[1:19:18] to uh
[1:19:21] to just look look here
[1:19:23] look closely together tonight praise the
[1:19:26] Lord you love the Lord but I'm in the
[1:19:28] seventh Church ages he says now the
[1:19:32] seven spirits that are before God
[1:19:36] these seven Spirit was represented as
[1:19:40] the seventh Spirit there will be sent
[1:19:44] forth
[1:19:45] for the seven Church ages
[1:19:48] amen seven spirits before God
[1:19:53] we could pick up from the Old Testament
[1:19:56] and pick it out there if we just had
[1:20:01] time now he referenced us to the Old
[1:20:03] Testament he never had time to do it but
[1:20:05] it is you and myself responsibility to
[1:20:08] go and do it
[1:20:10] he said we can pick it up from the Old
[1:20:12] Testament the prophet of God will not
[1:20:14] make that statement if it was not in
[1:20:16] that's right
[1:20:19] praise the Lord
[1:20:22] now I don't know if I found it or not
[1:20:25] but the scripture that we read in in
[1:20:27] Isaiah chapter 11
[1:20:29] that speaks about the spirit of wisdom
[1:20:33] the spirit of knowledge
[1:20:35] you know the spirit of understanding the
[1:20:37] spirit of wisdom the spirit of counsel
[1:20:40] the spirit and if if you if you read
[1:20:43] from verse 1 to verse 5 you can be able
[1:20:46] to fit a seven Spirit right in there
[1:20:50] that that that that is just to give you
[1:20:53] a clue you go and look for it
[1:20:55] are we together
[1:20:57] now but he says we could pick it up from
[1:21:00] the Old Testament
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] if we just had time now in in Hebrew uh
[1:21:10] uh Siri Hebrew Exposition uh he says
[1:21:13] here Forerunner
[1:21:15] has gone before us
[1:21:18] the Forerunner is gone
[1:21:22] has for US enter even Jesus made a high
[1:21:26] priest
[1:21:27] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[1:21:30] this great Forerunner has gone before us
[1:21:34] making a way
[1:21:36] he's become from a spirit now see what
[1:21:40] brother Branham is going to do now he
[1:21:41] become from a spirit from the great
[1:21:44] invisible spirit
[1:21:46] amen he's going now to make himself
[1:21:50] tangible
[1:21:52] he's coming from the great invisible
[1:21:55] spirit this Forerunner he went ahead of
[1:21:58] us
[1:21:59] the Bible says his work are finished
[1:22:02] from the foundation of the word he went
[1:22:04] ahead of us he is our Forerunner
[1:22:09] that's the reason why he's not learning
[1:22:11] anything new he's not planning anything
[1:22:13] new he's now his works are finished
[1:22:18] his owner working on our confession
[1:22:21] if we can believe it and say it back to
[1:22:24] him he made it come to pass
[1:22:27] are we together
[1:22:29] so he says here he uh uh
[1:22:35] this great Forerunner has gone before us
[1:22:37] making a way he's become from a spirit a
[1:22:41] great Fountain of the rainbow of God who
[1:22:45] has no beginning no end
[1:22:48] he was forever God this ray of light
[1:22:53] went forth
[1:22:56] it was a red of love
[1:22:59] that's the main one red he called one of
[1:23:02] the colors there in the rainbow the next
[1:23:05] color follow which is blue
[1:23:08] truthness red means represent love blue
[1:23:12] represent truth mess
[1:23:14] follow after there was other colors told
[1:23:19] their seven perfect colors which is the
[1:23:24] seventh spirit of God
[1:23:26] now so he's taking the seven
[1:23:29] perfect colors
[1:23:32] representing it as the seventh spirit of
[1:23:35] God so what what brother Branham is
[1:23:37] trying to do here that brother Jordan if
[1:23:39] you would just poke that man picture up
[1:23:41] of the rainbow
[1:23:49] now this is uh
[1:23:51] all of these Google pictures they are
[1:23:53] not clear
[1:23:54] but that's fine
[1:23:56] it gave us an idea it's only to give us
[1:23:58] an idea amen now so what he's what
[1:24:01] brother Branham is saying this is the
[1:24:03] perfect Fountain of God
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:06] this is the perfect Fountain this is the
[1:24:08] great internal spirit
[1:24:10] all of these colors came out of this
[1:24:13] white
[1:24:16] amen it came out of this pureness this
[1:24:19] is this is the pureness of God
[1:24:22] but when it comes through the diamond
[1:24:27] it breaks out into seven so the seventh
[1:24:31] spirit is not seven different spirit is
[1:24:34] one spirit
[1:24:36] coming true
[1:24:39] amen
[1:24:40] with different characteristics
[1:24:45] are we together
[1:24:47] are you having an idea
[1:24:49] so it's not it's not a seven Spirit you
[1:24:52] you you you you you see it like seven
[1:24:55] Spirit Before the Throne of God
[1:24:57] it looks like uh uh uh uh uh it's it's
[1:25:01] nothing like the Trinity that's that's
[1:25:03] not what we are we are looking at here
[1:25:06] we are looking at one invisible Spirit
[1:25:10] One internal spirit of God
[1:25:14] now so this picture is up let's stay up
[1:25:18] let me read this and and and you try try
[1:25:21] to see what I'm reading through that
[1:25:22] picture if it would make sense to you
[1:25:24] amen he says next follow uh uh after
[1:25:28] that other colors of the seven perfect
[1:25:32] colors so these are the seven perfect
[1:25:33] colors no let's stay up these are the
[1:25:36] seven perfect colors
[1:25:38] don't don't put the coat up just just
[1:25:40] leave this picture up let's see if we
[1:25:42] can we can be able to see the code in
[1:25:44] that picture
[1:25:45] the seven perfect colors
[1:25:48] which is the seventh spirit of God
[1:25:54] so these Seven Perfect Color coming from
[1:25:57] this pure light of God
[1:26:00] amen so which are the seven Spirit
[1:26:03] meaning that the spirit of God
[1:26:07] the great internal Spirit when he broke
[1:26:10] into time
[1:26:12] it was Christ in David it was Christ in
[1:26:15] Joseph it was Christ in in all the the
[1:26:20] the the the the Old Testament character
[1:26:22] it all comes from this pure fountain
[1:26:27] but it breaks out to be able to do
[1:26:29] different work in different
[1:26:31] dispensations
[1:26:35] praise the Lord even before we get to a
[1:26:38] seven Church ages
[1:26:43] are we together
[1:26:47] that's that's that's the picture that I
[1:26:49] want for us to understand why because uh
[1:26:52] before there was a seven Church ages God
[1:26:56] allowed the seven perfect colors to be
[1:26:59] seen in the rainbow
[1:27:02] praise the Lord
[1:27:04] before there was a seven Church ages God
[1:27:09] allowed Jacob to have an inspiration to
[1:27:13] give Joseph a coat of many colors
[1:27:23] it was just God releasing a little of
[1:27:26] himself what he was going to do
[1:27:30] at the end of time
[1:27:33] it's now with the opening of the world
[1:27:36] we can look back and say oh wow
[1:27:39] that's what a man
[1:27:42] that shows that you see that uh Jacob
[1:27:46] put Joseph on a covenant
[1:27:50] make him a cult
[1:27:52] out of inspiration
[1:27:54] he wore the court
[1:27:57] and to God meet his brothers he never
[1:28:00] left the court back
[1:28:01] he wore the court yes sir he was under
[1:28:04] that Covenant
[1:28:06] to their eyes it was the father that he
[1:28:09] just spawned in this boy but in the eyes
[1:28:12] of God God was keeping him on a covenant
[1:28:17] yes
[1:28:19] praise the Lord are we together
[1:28:27] amen you love the Lord tonight
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:35] just experiencing some dryness in my
[1:28:38] throat it's okay
[1:28:40] I have three bottles of water down yes
[1:28:45] you love the Lord tonight
[1:28:48] so let's let's just read this quote
[1:28:49] let's let's read this quote keep looking
[1:28:51] at that picture
[1:28:53] foreign
[1:28:54] Perfect Color which are the seventh
[1:28:56] spirit of God that went from the great
[1:28:59] fountain
[1:29:01] and that great Diamond that Jesus spoke
[1:29:05] of
[1:29:07] that great diamond
[1:29:12] that chapter reflect these colors
[1:29:15] God was God was made flesh endured Among
[1:29:22] Us so Robert Brown yet is trying to say
[1:29:25] is that this great internal spirit
[1:29:29] coming through this diamond is is is is
[1:29:33] is is God condescending himself
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:39] is God condescending himself he's coming
[1:29:43] down
[1:29:44] and uh and and and and he's he's he's
[1:29:46] living in
[1:29:49] eternity in the in the pureness the pure
[1:29:52] Fountain of God he's coming through time
[1:29:57] are we together
[1:30:05] God was made flesh endured among us that
[1:30:09] he might reflect his goodness and mercy
[1:30:13] Among Us by gifts and signs and wonders
[1:30:20] they are all right in these seven colors
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:28] the love of God the mercy of God the
[1:30:31] nine spiritual gifts are right to you
[1:30:36] are we together
[1:30:38] praise the Lord so you see that just how
[1:30:40] God works
[1:30:43] that's how the Mighty God works
[1:30:50] that whole big rainbow
[1:30:54] have become a teal funny
[1:30:58] made in the image like man now he's now
[1:31:03] he's calling
[1:31:05] Jesus the great big rainbow
[1:31:10] praise the Lord
[1:31:12] in Revelation the Bible says the rainbow
[1:31:16] was around the throne so it was complete
[1:31:21] in Noah's time it was just a ball it was
[1:31:24] not complete
[1:31:27] in Genesis it was just a bull it was
[1:31:30] just half
[1:31:31] in Revelation it was a complete story
[1:31:39] are we together
[1:31:42] amen
[1:31:43] the half has not been told yet
[1:31:46] it is just half that you are seeing half
[1:31:49] of the story
[1:31:51] that's what you are seeing there's
[1:31:53] another half that wait for us beyond the
[1:31:55] river
[1:31:59] now so he's calling Jesus
[1:32:03] the whole big rainbow have become a tear
[1:32:06] funny Made In the Flesh
[1:32:08] so all these seven colors was right in
[1:32:12] this white
[1:32:16] as long as it was eternity it was just
[1:32:19] going to be white pure
[1:32:22] but when he manifested himself in time
[1:32:26] then he breaks himself into seven colors
[1:32:33] are we together
[1:32:35] all the seven Redemptive memes is right
[1:32:38] here
[1:32:43] praise the Lord

[1:32:51] now he says here the many flesh yet he
[1:32:54] wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet
[1:32:58] he was a tear funny Moses said I didn't
[1:33:01] like to see you God hid him in a rock
[1:33:05] and when he passed by he turned
[1:33:08] turned his back Moses said it looks like
[1:33:12] the back of a man
[1:33:14] that's what come to pass one day down
[1:33:18] there when Abraham was sitting in a tent
[1:33:21] we would get to that tonight Abraham
[1:33:24] when Abraham was sitting in the tent God
[1:33:27] came up to him in a body of Flesh
[1:33:31] so in every dispensation he was breaking
[1:33:34] himself into one of this manifestations
[1:33:40] praise the Lord so we can take seven
[1:33:43] colors from here and put seven spirits
[1:33:46] we can take seven spirits from here and
[1:33:49] go to Zechariah and put seven eyes the
[1:33:52] seven out of God that go tour and forth
[1:33:55] through the Earth
[1:33:57] we can take seven hours from here and

[1:34:18] amen I wanted to come out of my head so
[1:34:20] you can see it
[1:34:23] praise the Lord
[1:34:25] amen so the seventh spirit that is
[1:34:28] Before the Throne of God
[1:34:31] is not it's not it's not the spirit of
[1:34:35] The Messengers
[1:34:37] you know I've heard people preach that
[1:34:40] you know the spirit of the seven
[1:34:42] Messengers when all the another is the
[1:34:44] spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:34:51] are we together
[1:34:55] is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:35:01] okay I can take few more minutes here
[1:35:03] and and then uh we'll find another time
[1:35:06] to
[1:35:07] to be able to wrap this up they're in
[1:35:10] the same uh Hebrew Exposition that seven
[1:35:13] part two and in there we find that uh
[1:35:17] yeah you can you can take our our seven
[1:35:20] seven colors away
[1:35:25] praise the Lord
[1:35:27] are we together
[1:35:29] you love the Lord tonight
[1:35:31] amen are you seeing the picture
[1:35:35] praise the Lord
[1:35:38] because the the Bible says that the
[1:35:42] spirit of strength the spirit of Might
[1:35:46] will come we come upon us
[1:35:53] that's what we need
[1:35:56] to wait on the Promises of God
[1:35:59] see all of those men they had to wait
[1:36:01] Abraham 25 years he was not doing it by
[1:36:04] himself
[1:36:09] job going through try your embarks all
[1:36:13] over his body he was not doing it by
[1:36:15] himself God put a spirit of strength on
[1:36:18] him
[1:36:22] for you to go through loudisha age God
[1:36:25] will have to anoint you
[1:36:27] with an enduring power
[1:36:29] there is no way you can fake it
[1:36:32] right you can fake it
[1:36:35] amen there is no emotion that you can
[1:36:38] express
[1:36:40] let the trial come let us let the
[1:36:42] squeeze come you you hear all of those
[1:36:44] things
[1:36:46] right
[1:36:49] God has to get a hold of you
[1:36:54] amen all you can say Lord give Lord
[1:36:57] anoint me with the spirit of it all
[1:36:59] comes it's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy
[1:37:01] Ghost
[1:37:03] it's the Holy Ghost let us not get wide
[1:37:06] in our mind and start to imagine
[1:37:07] different things we're talking about the
[1:37:09] same thing
[1:37:10] is the Holy Ghost
[1:37:16] are we together
[1:37:20] because you you you you you now begin to
[1:37:24] appreciate
[1:37:25] why the whole counsel of God was given
[1:37:28] to the church
[1:37:30] because the whole counsel of God is the
[1:37:33] strength of Israel
[1:37:36] he's the strength of Israel
[1:37:41] we will now be uphold we will not have
[1:37:43] that strength if we will take part of
[1:37:45] the word and leave part of the word
[1:37:49] the scripture says they overcame
[1:37:53] the blood of the Lamb
[1:37:55] which is the word of God the bleeding
[1:37:57] word
[1:37:59] and their testimony of that same word
[1:38:05] are you getting the picture
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:10] are you getting the picture that's what
[1:38:12] I want I want us to see tonight as as
[1:38:14] long as the Holy Ghost make you to see
[1:38:16] the picture the preacher don't have any
[1:38:18] work to do amen
[1:38:19] that's when he put the preacher at the
[1:38:21] side and then he starts dealing with you
[1:38:24] Hebrew chapter 7 here and in there we
[1:38:28] find out that he had
[1:38:30] seven varieties of spirit is that right
[1:38:33] the Bible said in in Revelation that the
[1:38:36] seven spirits Before the Throne of God
[1:38:41] the seven manifold the seven spirits
[1:38:46] we find out there's seven colors
[1:38:50] there's seven Church ages
[1:38:53] seven is complete and God
[1:38:57] was complete in seven spirit and those
[1:39:00] seven spirits were perfect you see
[1:39:02] that's the reason why I said you can
[1:39:04] take the rainbow and just pull seven
[1:39:06] Church agents
[1:39:08] you can take the ring ball and just pull
[1:39:10] seven Church edges seven messenger
[1:39:14] coming out from God
[1:39:18] are we together
[1:39:24] sometimes people take these things and
[1:39:26] run it and then they just they just run
[1:39:29] it all over the place and can't carry
[1:39:30] the complete picture that's what I'm
[1:39:32] saying out of that trying to repeat
[1:39:33] myself
[1:39:36] the first was the colored red perfect
[1:39:39] love Redemption
[1:39:42] and how if we had time to give those
[1:39:45] colors ensure that each one of those
[1:39:48] colors represented God's purity
[1:39:53] each one of those color came from the
[1:39:56] white
[1:39:57] it represent God's purity
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:03] each of those Messengers to their age he
[1:40:06] was they were God meant for the age
[1:40:09] in their age that was the fullness of
[1:40:12] God for their age
[1:40:19] are we together
[1:40:33] it was It was kind of for bad for your
[1:40:35] mind I mean there's something running
[1:40:36] through my mind but let me stay with
[1:40:38] this I'm running out of time amen
[1:40:40] let me just stay with this
[1:40:42] but I won't hold yourself together
[1:40:46] the spirit of the Prophet is subject to
[1:40:48] the prophet
[1:40:50] and if we have time and those colors
[1:40:53] show that each one of those color
[1:40:56] represented God's Purity amen those
[1:40:58] colors these seven natural colors those
[1:41:02] colors represent the purity of God those
[1:41:05] callers represent the motive the
[1:41:09] attitude
[1:41:12] you see he's bringing all of that all
[1:41:14] he's he's bringing it for us to realize
[1:41:17] that it was it was God's attributes
[1:41:24] praise the Lord it was something from
[1:41:27] the father
[1:41:31] they represented seventh Church ages
[1:41:33] seven stars seven angels
[1:41:43] the Bible says the seven Idols of the
[1:41:46] Lord that is running to and forth
[1:41:48] throughout the Earth
[1:41:54] I remember one time uh uh one young
[1:41:57] brother asked me this is he says brother
[1:41:58] one God is one but why the Bible say you
[1:42:01] have seven spirits
[1:42:04] praise the Lord
[1:42:07] it's I mean this this is just enough to
[1:42:10] be able to to understand go ahead
[1:42:16] that is not three pressing on the throne
[1:42:18] it's not three personalities of God but
[1:42:21] it's one God manifesting in three
[1:42:23] offices
[1:42:27] the same God that could break himself in
[1:42:31] the upper room
[1:42:32] and and in in in in in in in a form of
[1:42:36] fire and then he could he could light
[1:42:38] over the head of 120 percent
[1:42:42] praise the Lord
[1:42:44] amen
[1:42:47] another one that 120 person did not
[1:42:50] finish God in the house of kolena he
[1:42:52] broke himself again
[1:42:54] to all that were in the house of Colina
[1:42:56] that received the Holy Ghost
[1:42:59] they never talk all of God the ones that
[1:43:02] believe and were baptized he broke
[1:43:04] himself again
[1:43:05] praise the Lord as he filled the house
[1:43:08] they never finished God there was this
[1:43:11] promise is unto you to your children and
[1:43:14] to many as the Lord Our God shall cause
[1:43:17] every time God calls call Wong he breaks
[1:43:20] himself upon them
[1:43:22] praise the Lord
[1:43:23] amen
[1:43:26] that's the reason why the Bible says
[1:43:28] Jesus never taught it rubbery
[1:43:32] he never robbed God if God breaks
[1:43:35] himself into all into all the Believers
[1:43:38] that have God you didn't Rob him of
[1:43:40] anything right
[1:43:44] praise the Lord
[1:43:46] is because you have a portion and he
[1:43:49] still is the fullness
[1:43:52] praise the Lord
[1:43:54] Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight
[1:44:00] you love the Lord tonight

[1:44:41] a hand of praise
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:51] he's a mighty God
[1:44:53] okay
[1:44:54] he's a mighty God
[1:45:00] and all of those things we have with us
[1:45:05] praise the Lord
[1:45:07] he comes with all of those things we can
[1:45:10] read on and on and on I want to keep I
[1:45:12] want to keep this for the the next part
[1:45:15] of the service
[1:45:17] as I just try to to wrap up year
[1:45:21] for tonight
[1:45:24] you know when you you you you just you
[1:45:27] look at all of these things and you know
[1:45:30] a a kind of grabbed your mind
[1:45:34] do you know that seven times
[1:45:37] in the New Testament
[1:45:39] the Bible says you are the temple of God
[1:45:46] seven times the Apostle Paul
[1:45:49] now so what God gave
[1:45:52] to Moses
[1:45:54] as a vision
[1:45:57] God revealed to Moses as a vision
[1:46:03] praise the Lord
[1:46:06] Solomon got it as an inspiration
[1:46:14] he got it as an inspiration according to
[1:46:16] the scripture David David you you
[1:46:19] remember David was the one that was
[1:46:21] having a desire to build the Lord a
[1:46:23] house
[1:46:24] so David paid for everything
[1:46:28] he paid for everything
[1:46:30] Solomon only followed the instruction
[1:46:33] and the inspiration of his father but
[1:46:36] David paid for everything
[1:46:40] everything that did that Solomon God was
[1:46:43] all from the benefit of the relationship
[1:46:45] that David had with all of the kings
[1:46:48] around him
[1:46:51] are we together that's why Solomon had a
[1:46:54] golden age he did not have to fight for
[1:46:55] nothing
[1:46:56] the work was already done
[1:46:59] and that is the same with you and myself
[1:47:01] the work is already done everything is
[1:47:04] painful
[1:47:06] praise the Lord everything is paid for
[1:47:09] we just need to bring the materials
[1:47:11] together
[1:47:12] follow the instruction follow the
[1:47:15] blueprint and put things in their place
[1:47:18] and then we enjoy the blessings of the
[1:47:21] lord we enjoy the presence of God
[1:47:24] are we together
[1:47:28] you love the Lord tonight
[1:47:33] I think I can
[1:47:35] I can close with that if
[1:47:37] if
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:46] you love the Lord
[1:47:53] okay
[1:48:07] okay I know I know what's what's going
[1:48:09] on
[1:48:11] I thought I was lost a little bit but
[1:48:14] I think I know what's going on
[1:48:18] but a one
[1:48:22] okay so let's just do this let's just do
[1:48:26] this together tonight
[1:48:29] and uh and and bring this meeting to a
[1:48:31] close
[1:48:32] uh get you out of year by nine Teddy
[1:48:36] like I said seven times
[1:48:39] seven times the scripture declared ye
[1:48:42] are the temple of God
[1:48:45] so like I said uh uh Moses got the
[1:48:50] Divine Moses got the Oracle he got the
[1:48:53] counsel of God for the Tabernacle
[1:48:57] amen he got the counsel of God for the
[1:49:00] Tabernacle everything that Solomon by
[1:49:04] inspiration added to the temple it did
[1:49:07] not contradict the original pattern
[1:49:10] right yeah
[1:49:13] you can say while the Tabernacle was
[1:49:16] this and Solomon why did he put her uh
[1:49:20] uh uh those two pillows it was not in
[1:49:23] the original Tabernacle you have to
[1:49:25] realize that God
[1:49:28] a revelation like the prophet talk about
[1:49:30] progressive revelation
[1:49:33] he said I'll not change one of my
[1:49:37] Doctrine
[1:49:41] the Holy Ghost progress
[1:49:44] as the same way he deal with us just
[1:49:47] like we grow naturally we grow
[1:49:49] spiritually in better understanding
[1:49:56] are we together
[1:49:58] so when Solomon honor inspiration when
[1:50:01] he put the two pillows
[1:50:04] and that's the reason why he had the
[1:50:07] inspiration to name them
[1:50:09] he's trying to he's trying to say when
[1:50:12] you come to the top to to the temple
[1:50:14] when you approach the temple you see
[1:50:16] Jacob and Boaz what you understand that
[1:50:20] this Temple is established in the
[1:50:23] council and the strength of the Lord
[1:50:26] that's all he was saying that the
[1:50:28] statement he was making it is not
[1:50:30] contrary to what Moses did
[1:50:35] he was just making a boss statement that
[1:50:38] this this Temple you are saying it is
[1:50:42] established in the council
[1:50:45] and the strength of the Lord
[1:50:47] Paul says the house of God the Church of
[1:50:51] the Living God is the pillow and ground
[1:50:54] of Truth
[1:50:55] it does just the same thing
[1:50:59] it's not rocket science
[1:51:01] it's the same thing it's inspiration of
[1:51:04] the Almighty
[1:51:07] are we together first Corinthians
[1:51:09] chapter three
[1:51:12] First Corinthians chapter three
[1:51:14] reading for verse nine let's read
[1:51:15] together
[1:51:17] all the scripture that will come on the
[1:51:18] board that's that's that's how we're in
[1:51:20] the service tonight amen let's just read
[1:51:22] it together read it claim it possess it
[1:51:24] amen as a word of God don't be afraid of
[1:51:27] reading it read it
[1:51:31] for we are laborers together with God ye
[1:51:36] are God
[1:51:39] s that's right next verse
[1:51:42] I called him
[1:51:44] Chris which is giving unto me
[1:51:47] as a wise Master building I have laid
[1:51:51] the foundation and another building
[1:51:55] there on and let every man take heed how
[1:51:59] he build
[1:52:02] a little bit and we have gone over there
[1:52:04] before you have to make sure not not you
[1:52:07] don't do things to impress God make sure
[1:52:10] it's according tool the counsel of God
[1:52:13] if you will get God involved make sure
[1:52:16] you are bringing it back to the word
[1:52:21] not to your feelings not to your mind
[1:52:23] not known not to your culture it must
[1:52:25] come back toward the word
[1:52:28] the foundation has already been laid
[1:52:33] are we together next verse
[1:52:38] for all the foundation can no man lay
[1:52:40] that is laid which is
[1:52:44] that's the foundation is already laid
[1:52:47] Yeah
[1:52:50] it must come back the next verse
[1:52:53] now if any man build a palm-based
[1:52:57] foundation gold silver precious stone
[1:53:01] wool Health now let's stop there now you
[1:53:05] see so uh you we we can take precious
[1:53:09] stones in a place of Bryce
[1:53:12] amen
[1:53:14] because when we were when we were
[1:53:15] looking at the Tabernacle we saw the
[1:53:18] three elements that was made it was gold
[1:53:20] silver and Bryce
[1:53:27] is God that gave gold is is God that
[1:53:29] gives sivir is God that gave precious
[1:53:32] stones

[1:53:35] now the other three wood comes from the
[1:53:40] tree that God made when you cut it down
[1:53:41] is dead
[1:53:43] that way you get wood from
[1:53:45] so the other three the amendment
[1:53:50] three are gone given
[1:53:53] and the other three are man-made
[1:53:56] that's what Paul wants us to pay
[1:53:59] attention to
[1:54:01] If any man there upon this Foundation

[1:55:02] the next word If any man Works shall be
[1:55:06] burned he shall suffer
[1:55:09] but he's
[1:55:10] shall be saved yet so
[1:55:14] yes so as by fire
[1:55:17] Paul says some work out of strife
[1:55:20] he said it there also in the scripture
[1:55:22] some work out of strife some work out of
[1:55:24] impression some work out a competition
[1:55:26] some work out of you know whatever it is
