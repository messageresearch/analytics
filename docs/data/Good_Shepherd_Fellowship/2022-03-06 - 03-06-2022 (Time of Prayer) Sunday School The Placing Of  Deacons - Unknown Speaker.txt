TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] our little church here is sovereign it doesn't have any uh denomination or anything to send its deacons it elects its own deacons it elects its pastor it elects its trustees it elects everything that comes in and out of the church no one person has to say so over anything it's the church and the church or those who come and support the church with their presence with their tithe and offerings are always the ones that has legal say-so in the placing of such and i want to thank the uh past board of deacons uh say it from here for all the church if any of those brethren are here which was brother cox brother fleeman and brother higginbottom and brother diesman they have give us a good service give the lord in this tabernacle and ever so often according to the bylaws of the church every year the deacons are trustees automatically fill their time and if they want to come back all right if they do not want to come back then they can place them in their places as this board had resigned then the other night i called the trustee board which there is a new board of trustees i noticed brother luther mcdowell here tonight we're glad to see him in which was formerly on the trustee board i went down this week to find out is it check and to having a photostatic copy made which will be presented to the church also that the trustees of the church now is brother william morgan brother mike [Music] egan and brother banks woods and brother roy roberson and they're all of this city except brother robertson it lives between the two cities lord has seen fit in those men and they have been a honorable man and they have now received the duty as trustees of this church and then while this meeting was going on and was told by the assistant pastor that we collecting of a new board of deacons that these had served their time out and and resigned then it was to select some more deacons now the church the way this is done is the board can a appoint deacon man that they have associated with and found to be honorable and just man the office of a deacon is a very great office and a great honor to the lord to be a deacon in the church and so in the meeting the other night certain man was called out to me and when meeting with the pastor the following this last friday which was agreed by this man that these were honorable and just men one young man that they had found was not exactly qualified not because he wasn't the right type of man one that was suggested by one of the honorable men of our trustee board but as the pastor and i came together and i asked the age of the young man he was in his early 20s honorable just and a real man but find out that he was a single man the bible requires the deacon to be a married man he must be the husband of one wife and then another man which was a very honorable man very qualified for the job and would made a loyal man as a brother suggested him than after investigating the case that the brother had just recently come into this faith his wife doesn't believe in it then that disqualified the man is the office because he must have all his family in subjection they must be also in the faith because it would be a conflict and we're building now and we wish to place this church and as the general overseer of the church i must see that it's kept scripturally everything right on the word and so therefore then it has been found favorable with the board and the pastor and the overseer to select in this group of people here some man who we think to be honorable and just man we can only bring them and it's then they are appointed by the church by their own vote and then these men shall serve if they feel that they will accept this office then they will come for a short time to see if they feel that maybe that god has called them it is later if they feel that they are disqualified and they have a right in the next few weeks to resign the office that someone else could be appointed in their place however at the beginning of the revival if if god willing i want to hold here in this tabernacle as soon as i get some rest then i then i we will ordain these deacons by laying on hands deacons and treasure in this church but first they must be appointed and and see how they like it and how the congregation likes it benefits of then if it's all right on both sides then we make these men ordained deacons just like trustees are elected the same way it's the sovereignty and the law of the church by the word of god therefore that it just can't say that i think this man would be a right man that isn't it brother neville thinks this man be a right man or the trustee board think this man to be a right man it has to be by the church no one does anything within himself here it's the boat of the church it's a sovereign church the old set of bylaws was destroyed in the 1937 flood we have recopied those and will be hung on the wall here soon the duties of trustees deacons treasures and so forth pastors associates and so forth by the grace of god it has been said to me and a 100 percent vote to the board of this church that they have found that brother holland hickerson to be a just honorable man and in line in this position to receive the the great honor of being deacon of this said tabernacle also we have found and by the vote of the board that brother collins also has been found an honorable and just man being a minister himself therefore we would ask him to come and to be a deacon of the church and not only a deacon but an associate to brother neville and perhaps to a sunday school class or to take the place of brother neville or whatever has been called on here to be an associate to brother neville that's brother collins and also the church has found in favor that brother tony zabal an honorable and just man and he's been favored before the trustee board and the pastors to ask him to receive the office of deacon and this said tabernacle and it's also been asked and found an honorable man among us not he's not being the only honorable man now but just has been selected by the board of brother um taylor from henryville or memphis i believe it is memphis indiana who's been with us for some time acting as usher and whatever could be that the church has found favor with him are the board and pastors that he would accept the the great office as being the deacon of this said tabernacle and it's also been asked that brother mike egan's son-in-law brother [Music] brother bob harmon has been selected by the board and by the pastors to accept the office as treasurer of this said tabernacle which is an honorable job and it requires justice and honor and doing this i thank my brother that calling you from here that that it would be a great honor to you and not only that but something to do at this time i will have brother neville or associate to read the requirements of the deacon brother neville if you'll read it from the word of god first timothy 3 eight through [Music] of this eight through twelve likewise must the deacons be grave not double tongue not given to much wine and greedy of filthy luker holding the mystery of the faith and a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slander sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus amen i would at this time ask these brethren who has been called if they would just walk forward here to the platform just a moment as we bow our heads just a moment for prayer i won't then and the church knows what this is that this is electing your deacon board and your treasure lord jesus it is this sober godly thinking that we come to thee now we come in respects of thy most holy word we come believing that let every man's word be wrong but god's be true and we are grateful to thee for this church which jesus has purchased with his own precious blood and has given us this building to worship in and as the overseers of this great flock which the holy ghost has ordained us to be we are trying now to present to this congregation our loyal righteous bunch of man that we believe to be spirit filled and ready for the office as it is once said concerning the deacon board go look out yourself among you man of good reports and with the holy spirit that they might serve in this manner to take care of the widows and orphans to the spirit the money and to care for the welfare of the church later in years we have just read the writing of that great inspired sainted paul who sets forth the declaration of the scriptures are the requirements of such positions god honored these men and now it is the choice lord as the sovereign church as the body of the lord jesus that they do the electing and direct this potion of the service in a special [Music] in that righteous and holy name of jesus now with our heads bowed not only our heads but our hearts and every member of this church that comes here regularly and supports it with your tithe and offerings which is considered a member of this church while the pastor and i alone looks the associate pastor brother neville and i look on i would ask if this church finds brother taylor to be a just man and eligible by the best of your thinking to be deacon over this group of people you will signify the same by raising your hand all right now if there is any country would you raise your hand thank you does any of this members of this church here find and all do you find brother holland hickerson to be a just and honorable man and a man that's found in your sight worthy to become the deacon of this church would you signify by raising your right hand if it is contrary then raise your hand does this congregation find brother collins to be the same a righteous and honorable man and worthy of the job of being beacon of this church would you raise your hand all right contrary would you raise your hands does this congregation find brother tony's able to be an honorable man and worthy of this office of being deacon over this flock in this said church would you raise your right hand contrary would you raise your hand does this congregation feel that brother harned is a just and righteous man who has been with us for some time to be the treasure secretary treasurer of this church to handle its finances and to pay its bills if so raise your right hand is there any contrary raise your right hand i wish to say to the the brethren who are standing at this present time at the foot of this cross that this church with 100 percent no contrary at all finds you all worthy in the sight of god for this office that god has called you now you said let these first be tried and see if they desire this office within a few weeks god willing i will return back to lay hands upon this group of men to make them the official trust of the deacons of this church and treasure let us bow our heads just a moment lord we are happy tonight that there is man still living on the earth that can walk godly before the world so godly that a tabernacle with strict rules as this one has can vote five man into position as their leaders without one vote contrary we are happy for them and we feel that you were with us in making these decisions the board and we pastors god bless these men and may they serve this office with all their hearts knowing that it is purchasing to them a great degree in heaven someday when the books of heaven shall be closed may the vote of the celestial beings and the great book of heaven be opened may their names be 100 before god and the savior and all the heavenly hosts to be the same in his kingdom bless them lord and may they serve this office well in jesus name we thank you for them amen i just want to shake your hands brother harness brothers table and brother collins brother hickerson and brother taylor so happy to know that we have fellowship all this time with such honorable man god bless you now and we will see you right away as soon as i give them the rest to get back and see how you like your office all right by the vote i think was 100 no contrary at all oh aren't you glad that you're associating with people today who can live before god godly and live before this present world in that condition it is a wonderful thing i'm so glad to know tonight that i have the privilege of of having these man and this church to be my friends i'm so glad that god let me associate myself with his church all over the world oh they are despised and rejected and talked about as i said this morning in my message maybe just mud daubers the way the world looks at him has a bunch of fanatics but god looks at him as his children i'm so happy for that they might not be able to tell you how many miles it is to the moon they might not be able to tell you all the solar system and how it operates but there's one thing they do know they know the hour they were born again i'm so glad for them and as a little parable that i learned and i'm going to associate it tonight with my two little girls to kind of make it come home to us to make it real to us that you would understand the meaning of it one morning raising up out of bed i've got two little girls one of them is rebecca and one of them is sarah and they're daddy's little girls i've got a little boy joseph i was coming from chattanooga out of a meeting one night [Music] while i was there in this last campaign and i was in the car going along with my older son billy his wife and me was in the car and the girls as we were rolling along nobody had said nothing for several city blocks and i'd cut pretty hard on the people that night about the way they were doing nobody had said anything and little joseph come over and grab me by the shoulder he said daddy you sure didn't preach tonight and this morning as i was leaving and going up to 8th and 10th street the our pen intense brother nobody had said a thing the wife and the two girls a little joseph tucked a hold of my shoulder again he said hey i sure liked that preaching this morning he said i said well i've got one fan that's my son into our little scene up one morning sitting in the room little becky come running out and say she straddled my leg and put her arm around me and she's daddy's little girl and she was hugging me and little sarah jumped out of bed with her little pajamas and would say come running next she's a little brown-eyed one little becky would say oh sarah there's no need of you coming because i've got all of daddy myself that is all mine and little sarah her little lips dropped down their little brown eyes colored up emotion like this and stuck out the other knee and she come and straddled it becky's got longer legs so they would reach the floor little cell was starting so i put both arms around sarah little several of sword becky and said becky you may have all of daddy but daddy's got all of me and i think that's so it is sure we might not know all of the theology and all the great greek words this group of people might not know but there's one thing sure i believe jesus has got all of us amen all right brother [Music] you
