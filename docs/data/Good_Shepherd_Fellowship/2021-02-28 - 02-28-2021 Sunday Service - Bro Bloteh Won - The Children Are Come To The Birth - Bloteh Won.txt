wife sarah said she's in the tent behind you a hundred years old said i'm going to visit you i call in to the promise i give you at the time of life the other 28 days you have been looking for 25

thank god for visiting us i call into the time of life praise the lord we know that there is a lot of controversy uh concerning the the mysterious cloud and because it's a controversy that's the reason why i blew it a big and put it back there praise the lord and then so uh but we want to thank god for visiting us praise the lord let the critics say all that they want to say but we believe that god has visited us according to the time of life amen we believe that god has visited us a calling to the time of life amen a sister wrote this song some time ago and uh she dedicated it to the bride of jesus christ i don't know if i can do justice to it amen you know if i go flat then i'm going to stop amen praise the lord she was a virgin bride to be and one night as she lay quietly the spirit of the lord overshadowed her and said you conceive a child and sin cannot be fine and she said beat it on to me i call into thy world and she kept these things and upon the bed leave with a low heart she be leaving god we say something new that's boring to stand in the [Music] i believe it can be and she kept these things and pondered them [Music] something new is going [Music] we [Music] and if a world [Music] let's stand to our feet i have to practice more [Music] thank you musicians that will be all for the music praise the lord praise the lord let's take our bibles and go back to isaiah chapter 37 we started on wednesday night on this subject so let's go back to isaiah chapter 37 praise the lord if the word was formed and married i believe it can be born in you and me amen what an inspiration what an inspiration praise the lord isaiah chapter 37 we read from verse one to three there were few uh uh all the verses we look at it there they know uh a little bit to god and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard that he heard what a rakshika has said all the words of rafael the syrian general speaking to the people on top of the wall everything that he has said when hezekiah heard it he rent his clothes that was a way that's a jewish way of language is to rent their clothes amen he rent his clothes and and cover himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord praise the lord amen verse 3 and they said unto him doubt sir uh hezekiah this you know he went to the house of the lord and then he sent alaikum that was over the house of the lord shepnard and and the others he sent them to go and meet isaiah why he hezekiah went directly to the house of the lord to go and spread the letter before god he sent these people to go and meet isaiah the prophet and and this is what he said to isaiah and and verse 3 and they said unto him god said hezekiah this day is a day of trouble praise the lord a day of rebuke a deal of trouble uh because the assyrians is threatening them a day of rebuke because it is it is the sin of the people that put them in that situation amen and a day of blaspheming because uh rashika is is insulting god praise the lord we will talk about that a little bit here a dead of trouble a day of rebuke and of blaspheming for the children i come to the birth and there is now strength to bring forth let's pray heavenly father almighty god please lord come and help your feeble servant lord and help your people this day father god lord we stand in your presence you are the creator of heaven and earth lord father you know what truth is because you are the very fountain you are the substance of truth almighty god as we stand and i believe many believers around the world oh god some are scary to death lord to even try to bring the mysterious cloud into mind because of all the things that have been publicized and that brother branham too were lied then brother brandon was not there and all of that but almighty god you are the supreme judge oh father and we will leave that to you but this morning father with faith in our heart to believe that you have visited us in this day the same that you did to our father abraham lord you have discerned our needs lord god and father you promised to visit us according to the time of life oh god and here we are father lord god all of these years for how many and for how many years lord you have caught us you have preserved our lives you have been dealing with us so god some has walked with you for 40 years some of god father lord they have walked with you for many years lost some 20 some god father 10 years some lord no matter what it is so god is the same word or father is the same conception lord god almighty god and here we are father lord we have come to the birth we have come to a day lord god where we are we are challenging just like ravshika spoke to the people on the wall law of father god so we have all sorts of things on the walls of the internet concerning this message concerning the messenger of father god concerning lord god man o lord father that has walked lord god father and failed lord and different things lord there is just a lot of things to god that is intimidating the minds of your people father lord god but lord we want to lord just commit ourselves into your hands lord father god lord we pray that you will just come and help us lord god this morning as we come to encourage the fate of your children lord father oh god that we can only put our faith in the word we can put our faith in the in the present god lord father the same yesterday today and forever oh dear lord we just pray father god we believe this morning lord if that word was forming mary that word can be born in us lord god all precious love so we ask this morning just come on god and speak to us and be with us of god in a way that it will please you father we just love you and we appreciate you will god in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you and you can have your seat i'm going to be like hezekiah i would just rain my clothes praise the lord i won't use sock i mean actress i can use some snow and just put it over my head glory be to god amen uh this morning just i just had a had a wonderful time with the lord jesus you know i just just had a wonderful time with the lord jesus it was it was just so wonderful and uh and the lord kind of woke me up this morning i can't say i woke up because i would not want to get from one of those covers but uh and then i just went down and and had a time of praying with the lord and and then i was listening to to uh to uh a sister testifying about azusa street oh my goodness it just inspired me this morning oh my goodness me it just inspired me and especially when you know she was testifying about william simmer and he was a prayer warrior he was he was really looking for the revival and a lot of story behind it but what inspired me was that asking god for the revival he would pray almost two three hours a day you know two three hours a day waiting on the lord and after he received the baptism of the holy ghost he would pray about seven eight hours a day i said man that is a that is at this job we go to work for eight hours william simmons will spend eight hours on his knee crying to god i said my goodness i just said lord i'm just ashamed of myself amen praise the lord and i mean i just i just had a good time i just had a good time in and i want to thank god for that praise the lord i want to thank god for that and and i just hope we have a good time in the lord this morning amen and then i was i was uh listening to another uh lady in uh from from australia very elderly that sat on a smith wigglesworth you know and she actually got converted on the smith weak as well because she was from the church of the brethren and it was a kind of a strong legalistic church you know and i mean she was so branded and i mean she was talking about you know being a teenage girl how you know i mean the church of the brethren was a set it was you know it kind of said people that uh you know uh uh you know that would just hold to a certain kind of belief in in all that so uh at a young age you know the the uh the jews the husbands you know and all of that they bring some you know boys in the room she was with her three sisters and uh you know a funny funny garlic woman you know very funny girl woman and she said that uh you know and and brought these boys and you know in the parents is telling them or these are going to be your husband when you grew up she said i just said in my heart okay you went boy let's get there and then you will see but the thing about it there is that she was so intimidated under that movement and as a young girl she ran away from home because i mean it was so threatening you couldn't do anything here i mean just illegalize the spirit if you ever live on a one you know what i'm talking about a kind of a legalistic spirit you know and and i mean you cannot associate with family members if you are not part of that setting you know and all of that praise the lord i remember uh years ago i was talking with a brother you know and he was saying how you know they won't go to to uh family members uh uh wedding you know and uh but every time that comes you know that we invite them to their wedding and the preacher will preach and and it will be conveyed you know and we were just talking a little bit and i told him i said i said that's not fair brother you know you expect these family members to come to your wedding and you will not go to their wedding i mean i mean uh if you have christ in you you should not be afraid to go to their wedding you know i mean christ went to hell hell didn't change him you know and all of that but i mean this that's that's the kind of a thing i don't know what i'm all in today these are just my own personal things i should just keep to myself you know but uh uh uh the beautiful thing there was to see how the lord there with this woman you know and when she went away she just she didn't want to have anything to do with the name of jesus nothing with church you know and that's what happened when a person has been abused by the system you know she didn't want to have anything to do with it and she was trying to get a wedding and at the time uh smith wiggleswood was in town you know having a tent meeting and and the lady invited her and she said she said she would not want to do anything now watch this she went into her into the room she was in a in a something like it would be like uh uh how can we call it now uh like a shelter and uh and it was upstairs she said and the devil spoke to her mind you go on the balcony and through your throw yourself down and this will be the end of it you will not have to think about your parents you will not have to be intimidated with church you would i mean because life is just miserable and she said she went to the balcony put her legs over the balcony and she said a hand on her shoulder just pull her back and when she looked back she couldn't see anybody she went to her room sat on the bed and she said like a hand on her shoulder just push her to her knees and then she said god if you are real do something amen you know she was just so tall inside praise the lord i mean the godly woman that i've witnessed the supernatural praise the lord you know and what i'm saying this is is to tell you that god is real you know just just coming to church is not all to it it's not all to it we are dealing with a living god amen this is not a denomination this is not just uh uh uh uh get a membership and find a place in church the god we are preaching about he's real he deals with heart he changed lives he deliver people so she said three times the law spoke to her to go to the attend meeting and the first time she would now listen the second time and and she said the voice became so real and so audible so she sneaked into the meeting she did not want to for the woman that invited her to see her so when she got there the place was so crowded there was a line and people were waiting to get in she says but what i wonder what i came to do here i mean this place is so crowded there is no seat for me so she went by the building trying to sneak you know didn't want for anybody to see her and she said uh you know it was it was a kind of a taint meeting and it just put plows down and make you know framed window and all of that and looks like one of the man uh laid against the freeman and he fell down you know it's all the way to the front and and she said she says well it fell down and it looks like something said uh uh a mullet you're jumping so she said she drove me and found a road right to the front and in a few minutes but uh smith wigal wolf came to the pulpit oh my goodness that was a revivalist that's another story we will not get into that again amen and and there the law started dealing with her heart i mean the lord started dealing with her heart she saw a living god you know she saw the living god that even gave her grace to forgive her mother went back and struggled to reconcile with her mother but that's that's just another story but uh i said that i give you that as uh as an appetizer let's get to the meal now amen praise the lord let's get to the meal so we want to talk about the children i come to the birth the children are come to the birth and there is no strength to bring forth praise the lord the children are come to the birth and there is no strength to bring forth now you know a couple of weeks back we were talking about the age of shame and we were talking about how god did with shame and how he showed through the book of saint john the word it's taught is the word introduced himself in the beginning of saint john and in the fourth chapter he did with shame and in the eighth chapter he did with another woman uh uh cutting that doctrine and then i said in the 16th chapter which is the next uh uh uh the 12th chapter is uh the woman with the albastro bass and in the 14 16 chapter is is another woman but this woman is a spiritual woman which is the church praise the lord are we together amen so let's let's go to saint john chapter 16. this actually will bring us to the place and uh and where we're drawing our inspiration from is from the message birth pain jesus said that in john chapter 16 verse 20 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the word shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall turn into joy amen a woman when she is in travel of sorrow because her hour is come praise the lord for hour is come the children are come to the birth her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember no more the language for joy that a man is born into the world now so jesus talking about the church here he's talking about the comforter he's talking about the holy ghost but he also preparing the church that this would not just be an experience that would come and make you emotional amen i felt something over my body this would be something that would come and possess your being this will be something that you will be conceived praise the lord he's talking about the holy ghost he's talking about the comforter this there should be something that would come and that's what happened when a woman is conceived the conception changed her appetite it changed the way she walk it affects her you know sometimes it makes her to look fat when she's not fat amen it just changed her body it's because of the child that she's carrying and that's the same thing the word does when that word drops into your spiritual womb by faith it affects the way you walk it affects the way you talk it affects the way you dress [Music] if the woman was wearing size 20 when the child starts to grow she got to get something bigger she got to wear something decent she can't wear those tight clothes anymore and when the world is possessed in your being you cannot dress like the world you cannot act like the word you cannot talk like the word the word in your spiritual world affect the way you live the children i come to the birth jesus said a woman when she's in travail have sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as the child is as soon as she's delivered of the child she remember no more the anguish for joy that a manchin you know jesus was very precise not she rejoiced because the child is born but in many times pointing that we will be conceived with the word because the word is a manchin amen the word is god in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and and and you now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy and no man take it away from you and then he goes on in you know and they show the church praise the lord amen he goes on and then he assure the church are we together praise the lord amen birth pain brandon says i believe that jesus year was speaking of as he said you will have sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned into joy speaking to his disciples here ignoring that the birth of christianity he's moving them from judaism over to christianity is now by putting your name on the book the birth of christianity amen knowing that the birth of christianity was coming into existence a new move was going to to begin something new he was going to do praise the lord the birth of christianity was coming into existence and now the all has to die in order that the new is born to have anything that gives birth has to have pain of distress any form of birth any form of birth is associated with pains of distress because uh genesis 3 15 that's what god said to eve and he also applied to the spiritual church and and that is on the the promise of redemption because god was giving the woman the promise of redemption your seed shall bruise the head of the serpent but in pains and in sorrow you will bring forth that's what he said so every form of birth is associated with pains that's why when god takes us through trials there is no trial that is pleasant to the eyes amen there is no trial that is that is that is pleasing and and we go through distress we ask why me lord we say so why what is this happening in all of that but god take you through that time of distress because he want to birth you on the other side with an experience every form of birth a breath of understanding a birth of faith a birth of spiritual strength it comes with distress praise the lord to have anything that gave birth has to have pain of distress and this certainly was going to go through the pain of distress and anguish to get from the law to grace now jesus was saying this to them another comforter would come i'll give you another comforter the spirit of truth least in your mind did they ever imagine that they were going to be whipped for the gospel amen they were going to undress them they were going to imprison them but this is the birth pains that come with with with producing christ to your age it does not come on roses it does not come on you know just church member we just come we you know we play music we sing and then we and then we go home praise the lord i if you ever try to do that because your natural birth your natural nature is a sticky nature you will see the things of the world just jumping on you they would just jump and stick because your natural nature is a sicky nature praise the lord pretty soon you you dress like the word you you act like the word you play warling music you i mean you use cursed language and all of that and then you just keep your membership as a church the thing that that separate us from the things of the world is when we go down this path of pain this path of distress praise the lord when we go down this path of pain and distress at least they didn't know and they certainly was going to go through pains of distress and anguish to get from the lord to grace that's the same thing to get from a denominational church member to a bribe member it's not just by believing brother branham as a prophet it's not just by believing water baptism god got to take you through a personal squeeze and squeeze all of those denominational ideas out of your mind people come from you know worshipping mary as the mother of god it's so easy for a prophet oh yeah he's god yeah you worship him the same when god squeeze that out of your life you don't worship the man you worship the god that uses the man from law to grace he says normally natural birth types the spiritual all things of the natural is a type of the spiritual and we find out if we look out there on the ground and see the trees the earth growing struggling for life when the sea goes into the ground it has to die it rots it down its struggle to come through the dirt and come out as a beautiful flower and come out as a plant every form of life has to go through birth pains praise the lord we want a terrible life to speak things into existence but we don't want birth pains to be completely separated from the world no we don't want it the kind of things we want to speak into existing is mercedes bmw connor pervert your mind and we find out the tree growing is struggling for life that goes to show that there's a tree something that that doesn't daughter because is crying out for something praise the lord amen oh my god now we find that rain which brings forth the fruit upon the earth is born as the part said in the fee of thunder and reggae jacker sky when the rain is about to pull out it goes through its birth pains with thunder then like the blasting all over the place but it's it's it's it's it's rain that is about to come after that yeah so when when when you hear the lightning you know cracking in the heavens the cloud is going through birth pains they want to bring full life to the earth amen they want to water the earth so so we can have vegetables to eat so crops can grow are we together the little distilled drop of rain that's been that that's been left lifted from the seed in the end and this still from the sword it will not be born it takes the lightning the thunder blast the red rugged fearful things to bring forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring for birth it takes dying and as the clouds die the rain is born because rain is a part of that cloud praise the lord one has to cease for the other to exist praise the lord now so you think about it the children have come to the birth how are we going to bring forth this man child how are we going to bring for christ to our age to our generation praise the lord are you willing to bear the reproach of christ amen are you willing for people to think funny about you and say well this the guy he was cute he was a cute dude but we don't know what's wrong with him these days i didn't say he's going to church yeah just wait a few minutes you will see you'll be back we want to hold our wallet identity and then suddenly we take it off and we hold a christian identity it don't work in this birth it don't work in this life praise the lord let's take another one jesus said consider the lady how it told in spain but yet i said unto you that solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these for solomon's glory and his arraignment were all artificial praise the lord but the lady in his beauty is life that's making his beauty as as his struggle alone life is making its beauty it don't buy its beauty and put it on it that beauty that life is making is called character life is making its beauty it's different from the beauty of where you just go oh i like this it looks beautiful oh i like this it looks beautiful and you take it and put it in you know when they no life is making its beauty as a struggle as a struggle and learn feel rise up try it again life is making its beauty amen amen praise the lord it's life that is making this beauty now some artificial smell on a paint on lady he said consider it how it grow it talls has to bring itself up this little pound lady look where it comes through dirt and and and mock and mod and mother waters and dead waters it presses his way through all of that laughter criticisms it presses his way through all of that let's focus are we together we want to bring for life i want to be a service it's not looking for people to save it you want to be a service for you to be a service and people will benefit out of your life you have to press through you have to purpose in your heart like down your dead you have to keep your mind focused praise the lord on that now sit there and you want for people to beg you and you want for people to have i mean uh uh you know please and uh you know uh yeah no you gotta press true you gotta fight true are we together amen praise the lord amen a process is way through all of that this little game of life working itself from the bottom of the pound where the frogs and things are then it brings itself up through all of that praise the lord i mean that's all of the things our young people has to deal with such an age it is now your choice to be here but you have to realize that there is a god in heaven if god allowed your parents to give birth to you in this kind of a difficult time he has a purpose for your life praise the lord amen bridget helped our sister beside you there he has a purpose for your life and all things you know then bring life itself through all of that but cannot get in the presence of the sun is born the little sea bursts open into life it cannot do that until it gets true all of that process is pressing this way through they want to be exposed to the sunlight amen to be able to draw energy from the original praise the lord do you know that it's proving stricturally and by nature everything that declares the glory of god is always washing david says the heavens declared the glory of god and every idolatry washington found something in the heavens to worship they won't worship the god that created the heavens but they will worship the sun they will worship the moon why are they worshipping it because it's declaring the glory of a being is declaring the glory of a person when paul walked out there in the book of acts and he declared the glory of god what did they say the gods has come and it starts to worship him and paul said no don't worship me when that when when jonah came through his triumph and he get there on the sea show it was god that kept him it was god that preserving it was god that provided the fish but the people decided to worship him why because he was declaring the glory of god praise the lord i don't want to get into that let's let's stay with our our taught here are we together you love the lord praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord what a wonderful wonderful father we we serve praise the lord amen thank you jesus thank you lord but this little lady is pressing through the mind she's getting through all the fanaticism and she's getting through all the failed in the world and the felt on the internet and she's pressing through to be able to get in contact with the sun amen she want to get in contact with the sun that's the only time she knows that she can be able to bring forth the life she can be able to bring for the purpose of the one that placed her in that situation are we together amen a press truth and little she burst open onto life he cannot do that until it goes through all the process it's got to come through that that's what makes it it's because that the sun itself is what drawing it i got caught up in that word the sun itself is what drawing it is powerful you remember jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw oh man what is he trying to do he's trying to make you call equal that is that is the conflict in every age the messenger comes he live for christ to the people and christ draw him as a code equal because it is not of god to trample over his subjects nor because when god made man in the beginning both the male and the female they were co-equal amen they were core equal so the perfect sense of leadership is to be able to draw closer that's what god does to his people he draw us closer he don't enslave us by laws and rules nor because the only way we can be able to reflect his glory by by drawing us closer to him praise the lord amen now you've seen it and and then and then people will would just would just get the whole picture of mixer why because this power that is drawing you is a spirit it's a supernatural being they only see you they don't see the one that you are called equal to [Applause] if you want to reflect christ it's a secret live him up beyond your trials lift him up in your struggle don't complain god don't listen to complain god listen to praise he listened to worship you don't listen to complain drawing power amen glory be to god this is a bright message glory be to god amen amen that is the beauty it's it's the building even even in relationships is the beauty that is the beauty the man is the head of christ so for that man to be able to take his rightful place he submit himself to the word and what the word does it draw him up to a leadership praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why they're in in ephesians paul says uh let the woman be submissive now it does not means a man dominating over the woman because peter on the other side he says submit yourself one to another so it shows a core equation that is that that is the best way now let me let me let me just show it to you so you can be able to see it in a most physical way you see this projector here is place here for it to project on this wall praise the lord amen and just the way brother jordan faced the lands because there's a there's a place on this wall he wants to aim he don't want the letter spraying over a year he don't want to let he he he focus it so there is there is a there is an equal measurement now if he brings this law the letter will show law so the the the length or the projecting line whatever it is how to how to be in the equal measurement that's what reflection is that's what reflection there is no way the church can reflect christ until he lift us up for us to be core equal that's the only way you can be able to reflect you have to lift the person up you have to lift your wife up to be able for her to be able to reflect you you have to lift the weak ones up praise the lord amen now the the preacher that is so spiritual over the people and the people don't know the word you can never reflect christ that way that's why you have to put the people in the word not controlling and detecting ideas what am i saying what am i preaching where am i glory be to god the children have come to the birth you have to remember now the scripture never says the mother it says the children oh yeah it's not the mother that has come to the birth is the children that have come to the birth praise the lord we were getting to death let's continue to enjoy the prophet continue to enjoy the word praise the lord i have one responsibility and and that's that's the way i feel in my heart praise the lord if you don't feel like that i mean as a church you can you can you can you can vote me now my responsibility is to live this word is to put this word in every way before you because this word is your identity amen it is this word your identity this is the word that he's conforming us to so whichever way i can wave it before you i must wave this word one brother told me friend told me he says this is brother when you preach all the time the word the word the word the word i mean we need to know what we need to do i don't have nothing to give you the word that's right praise the lord let's just go ahead amen you know and and uh it's not to be it's not to be different it's not to be you know but uh i i pray that the holy spirit will be able to help each and every one of us amen be able to help each and every one of us brother branham had three pools in his ministry praise the lord there was a first port which was uh all on a healing and the three pool all goes with the healing ministry because it's the son of son of rochester's malachi chapter 4 with healing in his wings but he had three pulls the first pull was the vibration on his on his hands but it was more healing is sick it was a direct healing mistake now the second pull was healing the sick but in the higher level discernment the temple is healing the sick by the word praise the lord this healing by the word goes down to your soul the healing by discernment goes to your spirit the healing by laying on of hands is only for the body amen praise the lord so our bae our age we're not going to despise laying on of hands no praise the lord the word is the discerner of the talks and the intents of your heart but there is a word that has been giving us that this bride must be dressed in praise lord it teaches us how to dress how to live amen the prophet god says how how to raise up our family it's it's not a bulk you know why we can tend to the pages less let's look on page 54 it's written there let's see what what is written on 54 okay just like a main you know it's something where we are constantly in the world and we have been pregnant about the word the word is now influencing our life is is changing us that's the purpose of the message it's worth a word having the preeminence that's what he said in crisis the mystery of god revealed that is the test step of that great mystery amen was for christ to have the preeminence in christ is the word of the written word and the spoken word having the preeminence over the people i mean the holy spirit has to help us okay let's go back to this the children are come to the birth let's let's look at this a little bit amen praise the lord amen where where are you and when it gets full fully above their dead water they let it get followed above the dead water and the mouth and so forth then it's so happy it's so happy they have got to the place where say what you want to say amen you coming too late you should have said all of this thing before the world possess my being praise the lord amen now how can you tell the pregnant woman she already pregnant and said no you're not pregnant amen you know you must not yeah let me get back to you let me just forget about this amen amen praise the lord and when and when it if it gets folded above all of the the dead water and the mud and so forth then it's so happy it just it just give its life out freely if you never get in this word you will never produce christ if you just take it as the message is true you know god sent us a prophet i was baptized in jesus name you will never be able to bring forth christ the way to bring for christ is to get in this word praise the lord you must pray and die before god and this word like just like our brother job he esteemed the word above his necessary needs he felt like i need the word i need the word what the word says about this what the word says about this because you know it's your life people hangs around for as long as they can hang around just take an identity if this world is in you you can't get away from it you cannot get away from it where can i go and hide from the lord make your bed in hell it will find you there since 1963 we came into the time of life we take we came into the time of life and the time of life is the pregnation seizing the bride was feeding on the word she was eating the little bulk and the word was forming christ in her spiritual war praise the lord amen amen brother bram says that's the reason why god gave adam a bride it's for her to produce adam and that's the same reason why god gave christ a bride jesus said after she has proved give birth to the main child then joy comes that's the only way you can find joy in this message is after you have given birth to the man christ you might not have money in your bank account you might not have what the world is rejoicing in the boat to get on the lake a private jet to fly in and and the the latest 2022 cars that come up you might not have that but when you have gave birth to christ that's the greatest thing the people can have all of that fly their private jet come home and they are in sorrow praise the lord get in the heavens and fly all over and enjoy the beautiful oh look at the mountain oh wow and then when it come down to earth and come and meet us here they get on your cell phone their hands just like this oh what can i do oh hmm i'm almost getting out of time here praise the lord okay let me see what i can do i think that's a beautiful type of a christian life when something is drawing you out of the word until one day you are born right into its presence by the holy spirit how beautiful if you tried to help it you would kill it praise the lord if you try to help it you're going to kill it like a little chicken when it's been born you know if if you notice one of the little fellow right on top of his little beak or any bird that's born from an egg it's it's it's maturing this whole egg shell the all inner part of the egg has to rot away and it has to take this little bit a little bit instead instead stretching stretching and start stripping the air from the inside little big eyes is all clothed by this oh jesus thank you you are my lord and savior thank you father lord thank you for your grace every day thank you lord jesus help me out of this let's keep stripping because i want to be born he wants to be born he wants to break forth he wants to come forward he want to get out of that praising they want to spread his wings they want to experience the joy of the lord glory to god hallelujah you want to spread his wings the children i come to the birth and there is no strength you see that little cheek will not have strength to break forth it won't have strength to move his little head if the mama was not feeding it that's why the mama has to get on the prenatal uh uh uh medication and take the right vitamins and eat the right kind of a food because when it comes to birth that child needs strength to come forth if you're just feeling on denominational doctrines and just feeling on uh what about this in jesus name and if you're not feeding on the word you will never have yes strength it's the children that has come to the breath glory be to god are we together and if you notice that little fella right on the top of his little beak is mentoring the old eggshell the inner part of the egg has to rot and when he has to take his little beacons and strip back and forth until it breaks the shell out we call it peeping its way out in kentucky amen brother steve that is for you praise the lord they they they have never found a better way amen it's god's provided way it's god's provider way it's not the mama from outside that is breaking the egg is the baby from inside that is breaking his way out the mother just keep it in the right atmosphere she keeps it in a warm atmosphere she has to eat the right food but it's a little baby that is saying jesus is lord jesus is my lord and savior there is only one god and his name is jesus christ that little baby keeps keeps holding on to his truth and pressing forth using this little big it's little knowledge of the world has become so real now what papa say or what mama say what is real to me as a child of god it's not our church can't do this my pastors say no no no it's what god makes real to you i love you jesus praise the lord if mama says you don't love jesus i still love jesus if papa said he don't love jesus i still love jesus the children have come to the birth and there's no strain to bring forth we have never found a better way why is god's provided way you tried to help them you will kill them take the share off of him he will die praise the lord you try to help them pet them you know you have to you got to do like this you know you and try to pet them and and just make them to feel comfortable as church members you're going to kill them yeah you try to make yourself the best pastor and get all the praises amen drive around the twin cities and yeah oh yeah i'll come and help you brother yeah you try to do that you would kill them because they would not see christ [Music] i will pass that our pastor our pastor and then when god just wrote a little flaw of your life the same people that said hosanna or the same that said crucify him that's right amen and that's the way the christian has to do and i'm somebody just shaking your hands and taking you in you have got to lay there till you die and rot and are born into the kingdom of god is god's provider way you don't go in by the bulk or the shaking of hand or joining the church pump uh pull down you just simply have to get away from the old shell pull yourself away from their own shell that is the way to have christ that is the way for god to make himself real to you glory be to god are we together oh my we have not even started yet church i'm just trying to get your attention we are not even starting going to be to god you ate breakfast this morning you got a good breakfast amen i've not even going halfway here you start sleeping praise the lord i know it's not fair for me to be draining water before you die at that time when you are yelling for food glory be to god amen you know that was the thing that was the secret of the hebrew mothers in the book of accident the secret of the hebrew mothers was they fear themselves they prepared a child to get ready to come forth praise the lord amen they said the hebrew mothers are not like the egyptian women why because they the they prepare the child that when is that time the child will just come forth praise the lord the bible says that the the there was something they call uh uh that deliverance stooled amen there was something to call the deliverance tool now you even remember in in in the life of rachel she was weak praise the lord she was rich but what did the ma what did the male wife told her you're going to have a son because when the male wife tested the child the middleware kneel even though rachel was weak but this baby is ready to break forth praise the lord i mean the church can be filling the church can lose revival but the son and god of god that is feeling on the word is ready to break far i want more of god i can just settle down for a i got it for dead church and and uh i mean and we just go back you know better brown was on color rather than better brown was a wonderful story but i want that god a willing random in my life i want the god of elijah [Applause] [Music] where is the god of elijah even though rachel's body was weak but benjamin was ready to come forth and there was nothing to stop him there was nothing to stop him oh praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we have glory be to god what a wonderful jesus we serve praise the lord the children have come to the birth that was the message that hezekiah sent to the prophet isaiah why he went and took the letter arapshika to the temple of the lord and the bible say his prayer before the altar amen he said three things have come upon us trouble the assailants is threatening us walliness is threatening the church praise the lord with all the things all the things people going back and looking into icon and he won a story down there is the one that they want a paper on this for them to be able to believe the supernatural you want a code document to believe the supernatural then that's not faith no that's not faith if you need a code document to believe the supernatural then that's not faith are we together trouble has come upon us and it's a rebuke we are also dealing with rebuke you think about it if those all generals like brother branham call them he says all those old generals had to die if those all generous was putting emphasis on the world and putting emphasis on this christ on this church breaking for christ they were all building empires for themselves i want to have the biggest church in town i want to have the biggest church in the city running uh uh uh political deals and and crooked deals and running their own firms and their own businesses make using the message to make themselves rich that's why we have come to this place if the hearing ministry did not stop with brother branham if every service the blind eyes were seen the was walking we will rise up and question what god has done in this day all the miracles is in the past the churches dried up right praise the lord but god is that god and he's still moving among his people [Applause] the children not the mothers the children has come to the birth this young generation there is no strain to bring forth because they have limited our power to church membership you have to be in church don't go to that church if you are a member of the church you got to stay right here just making or church members what is christ what is the living word when we will see our young children reading your bibles finding time to pray in the afternoon getting away from all of your uh computer games and and finding time to pray they don't have to wait for devotion family devotion but there is a god staring in their heart because they have seen god in their homes as long as they can follow us to church they have the holy ghost but when they get to the place of their experience and i don't know what's wrong with that child he was born in the message we read him in the message it's your failure the children have come to the birth and there is no strength we don't even have anything to focus our mind on no expectation people come to church and just sleep no expectation for god to be real the children come to the breath there is no strain we just want for the time to reach and we pick up our bags and we walk out our service today oh yeah good good good service instead of building expectations lord i need you lord i need you father speak to me we sit in church and run our afternoon plan when i leave from here around here i gotta get that thing done and i'm gonna go here and go there and go there hallelujah amen in your mind all over the place you thank god speak to me lord you know the things in my life deal with me [Music] [Applause] hey children i come to the birth and there is no strength there is no strength to bring forth no strength to bring forth that's how we walk out of here the message is gone from our minds we can't even remember the scripture that was read in church there is no way to even go back and read over your notes because you don't need a note to write anymore i can just go back to youtube and play the service the age of technology has made the people lazy they don't read google google what is this what is this word google how do you spell come on google did 19 person fall from the breach obeying that breach in jeffersonville google was not even in existence and then you asking google to tell you something that came by the vision the first thing you should finally ask google who is god when google gave you the right answer then you trust google if google don't know god don't never trust google it might show you that it might give you the present address for your house address the children that come to the breath there is no strength there is no
