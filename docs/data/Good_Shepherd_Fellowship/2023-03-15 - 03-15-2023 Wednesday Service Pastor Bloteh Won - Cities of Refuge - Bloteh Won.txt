you are sitting Proverbs chapter 18 let's read verse 10 Proverbs chapter 18 let's read verse 10. Proverbs chapter 18 we will read verse 10. the name of the Lord is a strong tower one now we read it together the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run it into it and is safe Lord I blessing to your word tonight as we just want to Fellowship around this thought in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord praise the Lord and once again we want to greet her parents and her aunt malinder and her mama we want to say you are welcome back to Minneapolis hope you had a good flight praise the Lord I think the good Lord saw you were coming so he brought us on Sunshine so you can be afraid we hope that he will keep the weather Warm until you go back praise the Lord amen it would not want to be good for you it will also be good for us praise the Lord amen but what can we say about the services on on last weekend I think they were they were wonderful amen praise the Lord they were wonderful I feel like we should just read Psalm chapter 23. amen so well but we want to thank the Lord Brother Crosby spoke with him today he got back home safe and he wanted to send his love to the church and say he enjoyed the service enjoy the fellowship with the Believers on the weekend and he he was glad to to to be able to come out we're looking forward to come back again praise the Lord amen now now there is uh uh you know I was I was uh you know you think about uh uh the meetings you watch to see how the law was dealing with us dealing with every one of us and uh so I was looking at this at this scripture actually I had on my mind to talk on something tonight but I thought that well okay and I will leave it since it's uh Wednesday night we would just uh speak on something around the City of Refuge and take the various cities and their names and and look at them through the scripture as we as we go on tonight praise the Lord just to be able to encourage you but let's look in uh Revelation chapter 21 let's look in Revelation chapter 21 before we go that way I've used this uh uh uh I've used this uh verse before Revelation chapter 21. Revelation chapter 21 verse 7. Revelation 21 verse 7. he that overcome it shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son praise the Lord amen now that that word son is not only to the male it go back to the beginning you know uh it speaks of of of a place of position mobile being just a meal verse 8 says verse 7 again he that overcome it shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful if I want to read any other thing again that's what I want to put in my mind but the fearful their unbelieving and the Abominable the murderers the warmongers the sorcerers and you and you name you see all of that as uh as the Apostle John uh is listing down here uh shall have their part in the lake wishburner will fire you in Brimstone which is the second death now you think about uh uh the ones that uh you know that would be that would be cast off now the Bible here is placing the Overcomer at the place of where God is telling the Overcomer you will inherit everything praise the Lord now most of the time we look at inheriting everything as humans our mind is is uh you know uh first capture by our our physical senses so we think about having the Earth and having everything but it's it's I mean uh the land the houses and you know and all of that but uh it is it is actually in a place that when we come down to this place you will realize that this Overcomer is actually inheriting everything that God has everything that God Ace praise the Lord because like the scripture says he will inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son so it is almost like brother Branham saying taking a teaspoon and dipping it down into the ocean amen and it's almost as uh God creating Man In His Image so when God brought for ah I mean Adam out of him Adam actually had all things praise the Lord he was a possessor of all things that's the reason why he could be able to manifest the thoughts of the father he could name things and the father had no problem with faith he could do because he was possessed of all things not only physical thing but the very nature of God then the scripture will come down to the next verse and says but the fearful and their own believing praise the Lord now we we think about them that will be cast in the Lake of Fire you know it's it's easy for us to take the people on drugs and the ones that are drunk and the ones that are uh uh are living wrong can uh you know our mind goes to that but uh we are seeing something here that we face all the time being fearful praise the Lord and also year year is also giving us an idea that uh uh fear was attached to men when he fell from uh from from from Grace when he fell in the Garden of Eden he pick up that spirit of fear praise the Lord and yeah God is now restoring his son giving his sons back everything and then he's casting their fearful nature in the Lake of Fire praise the Lord amen so he that is fearful and uh we don't we don't think about it that way but uh we have to we have to come to the place to realize that we don't have nothing to be afraid of praise the Lord We There is not anything that we have to be afraid of praise the lord we are serving the god that is more than able praise the Lord so uh if we are inheriting all things tonight we must realize that and we are inheriting everything by the word you know the restoration of the word that has restore our soul back to God is giving us everything and that also is is is literally dealing with the spirit of fear the word is dealing with the spirit of fear it's not it's not how how much you Brave yourself up is the word that we cast out the spirit of fear for he have not given us a spirit of fear but he have given us a sign mine praise the Lord so uh just thinking about that uh that's not where I was going going tonight like I said I wanted to talk about the city The Refuge if I have a I have I have a map on the City of Refuge if they can put that up for me tonight being that is is uh is is Wednesday and we we want to recover from the services on the weekend praise the Lord I taught that uh I would just bring something just to kind of encourage you tonight praise the Lord amen now we will go we will go to the scripture and we will try to look at that no I should have a map on a day I don't know if the image came through okay the image never came true okay that's the image I wanted uh-huh yeah that's that's what happened when I do a very poor job praise the Lord I'm going to try one more time I'm going to try one more time I hope this time it works now we know brother Branham took this scripture in the message letting off the pressure and uh he used that scripture in preaching that message and then in the in the message letting of the pressure vertebrand kind of for referred to the City of Refuge how God made a provision for his people but there are a few things that are that are that are attached to that to that City that are wanted for us to do cities sorry that I wanted for us to be able to look at tonight Israel were giving 48 cities you know they were they were going to inhabit 48 cities as they go into the promised land and and and God is telling them to take six of those cities for those to be Cities of Refuge praise the Lord so uh why the uh if our sisters would be able to give us the image why they work on it okay okay we will go back and forth uh with that praise the Lord now one thing uh uh I would want for us to to realize is that uh uh these cities are placed uh in in a kind of a position where it should be very easy for the one that is needing help to be able to run to any one of these cities so wherever you are it should be very easy for you to get into one of these City and as I was as I was studying on the City of Refuge there were a few things that I realized is that uh there were laws that were put in place that those City Gates were never locked you can have access anytime praise the Lord and and the roles and the bridges that lead to the city have to be repaired all the time because you need to have access to it praise the Lord amen and they have provisions they have Provisions in the city all the time there was food enough food enough water praise the Lord so as as the as the the children of Israel do their farming you know when uh as they they would take up the attire from their crops and and all of that and then uh some of what they give as uh as as an offering or the over plus goes to these cities because the need to have food all the time praise the Lord amen foreign so let's look in let's look in our Bibles tonight glory be to God Numbers Chapter 35. I pray to be able to do a good job here for you tonight praise the Lord Numbers chapter 35 Let's uh we will read reading from verse one and the Lord speak unto Moses in a plane of more by Jolly near Jericho saying command the children of Israel that they gave unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to do it in and yes I gave also unto the lever suburbs for the city round about them and the cities shall they have to do it in and the suburb of them shall be for the akatos and for their Ghouls and for all the abyss and the suburbs of the city which year shall give unto the Levites cherish from the wall of the city and outwall a thousand kilbit around praise the Lord and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side 2000 Cubit and on the South Side 2000 Cubit on the West Side 2000 Cubit on the North 2000 cubic and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the suburb of the Cities and among the cities which yes I gave unto the Levites there shall be six Cities of Refuge which year shall appoint for the man's Slayer praise the Lord that he may flee haterton and to to them ye shall add 40 and two cities now so we realize that the Levites were not giving uh uh inheritance praise the Lord amen so there were two in some sense kind of was quite in these cities and but yet God was kind of for making provision for his people I want you to be able to grab this picture in your mind knowing that uh uh the people coming out of Egypt and uh uh and and seeing the miracle of opening the rare seed and everything that God did for them you know uh turning the beta water mirrored into water for them to drink providing food and all of that but yet the heart of the people was not converted praise the Lord amen almighty God seen uh how much uh uh sin has affected the heart of man he's making here a provision it is he's not he's not absent money that these people will have a time where somebody will get angry or somebody will make mistake or somebody would do something that is uh you know uh that they will need help so he's making provision for them praise the Lord amen noun is is the kind of a picture that brother Branham was said before there was sin there was a savior praise the Lord amen that is the beautiful thing about the the Old Testament in a way where it parks that types and shadows so here is God Moses that when you when you get over to this place you need to have these cities of Refuge praise the Lord so the man that had made a mistake we have a place to run for shelter he knows our weaknesses God knows that we will make mistake praise the Lord he's making provision for us to come to him when we make mistakes praise the Lord he know what we are made out of he knows our strength he knows our weaknesses we cannot impress God are we together praise the Lord you know because uh tonight I was actually uh that there is there is one of the Cities there let me not get ahead of myself but you know it's it's some of the things that we preachers enjoy doing getting ahead of ourselves amen if it's for some reason it makes our brain to work better that way foreign you know I I decided to switch over to the city of The Refuge I were actually stay in this couple of days ago I decided to switch to this because I was actually going to speak on something tonight but what caught my mind was that if you remember the story of where Joe Shafer Ahab sent for Jerry Sheffer for them to go and get a lane one of these land that they were going to get we will see it in the reading as we go along one of them were actually one of those cities amen Raymond Gill it was a City of Refuge so Ahab was uh he was he was his his desire of having the city was a wealthy one because there was a city that belongs to Israel now that kind of a drifted my mind to this because I was actually looking at some things that we were going to talk about from the message enticing spirit there are two words that Paul used Paul used enticing spirit and he also used seducing spirit but wherever Paul you seduce in spirit he tied that to demon powers he tied it to uh being said used by demon power you know he he ties there and when Paul used enticing Spirit like he used in First Corinthians chapter 2 that's where my reading will have come from he said that talks about interesting spirit in that way he says uh uh uh you know when I came to you I never came to you with uh in touch and spirit of man wisdom praise the Lord now brother Branham in uh uh the message enticing Spirit I'm kind of for drifting a little bit but it's good that's where my heart was for tonight so uh uh you cannot take a preacher away from his message so that's exactly what is happening so brother Brennan in the message enticing Spirit what he was trying to help us to see was the other uh he talks about just the same way uh demon powers are responsible for the sickness that that is in our body it says every sickness is from the fourth dimension every sickness is a fourth dimension sickness then he's making also also realize that is the same way things that make people to drift away from the word of God is also demon powers are responsible for that praise the Lord amen and the same way demon powers will affect people's body and bring diseases upon them and and he says that is the same way demon powers will also affect people's body now but what I was it will affect uh the the human Spirit you know to be able to drift them away from the word of God but what I was looking at tonight it was it was actually tremendous to see that uh brother brand name he says that every disease is from the fourth dimension now when brother Branham is talking about uh enticing spirit he read his scripture about no man can go to war unless he count the cost but then when he gets into the message he goes directly to the scripture where Ahab sent for jehoshapher and he dwells on that and he's using that particular scripture to make us to see how enticing Spirit works praise the Lord it is Ahab that is taking a structural position he's taking a scripture from the Bible he's calling another Son of God and saying see this is a promise the Bible says there will be there will be uh uh we will let our hands on the sake and the sake will be healed the Bible said the gift supposed to be in the church he's he's pointing out a promise praise the Lord but how to go about and fulfill that promise the Bible gave us promises and the Bible also instructs us how those promises will come to pass are we together now so as The Story Goes On in the Bible the Bible make us succeed there wide Ahab was thinking about getting this slang he has already consulted With His prophets praise the Lord we'll come back to the City of Refuge you have already considered consulted With His prophets he sent for Joe Shepherd and uh Joe Sheffer wanted to be sure that uh you know well yeah I can see it I can see it that this land belonged to us this is a promise that belongs to the church well can we pray about it praise the Lord he said while I you know I have I have all of these men of God here that uh I've talked to them and every one of them told told me you know it's in the word you know well let's go for it praise the Lord are we together and he says is there now one more oh yeah there is one that will never speak any good thing about me praise the Lord instead did not convince our Jehoshaphat in a way but what brother Branham is bringing out I will I will say that and then go back to what I want to talk about here is that uh with all of this decision that are happening in all of these prophets agreeing together there is something happening in the Unseen praise the Lord Mikhail had a vision and uh and and and the law show him a vision because Ahab had a prophecy hanging over him that the dogs is going to lick his blood now here is it lying spirits now so what brother Branham is showing in interesting Spirit just like how uh uh diseases in the body is influenced from the fourth dimension enticing spirit that leads men away from the promise of God even though they claim to be preaching the Bible they claim to be preaching the message the interesting spirit is also influenced from The Fifth Dimension because those lying Spirit came from The Fifth Dimension and it anointed those men it made every one of them to agree they said the same thing praise the Lord they all say the same thing and you know we give you a lot of things to think about when you when you get down is that studying and looking at that subjective it just makes you to look at a whole lot of things but uh as the Lord will be our help we will we will have time to look into it praise the Lord oh I'm I'm sure I was trying to put some things together I didn't get everything that I needed for tonight so I just thought that I will I will go this way but that's what brought this to my mind because Raymond Gallery is also part of uh the six Cities of Refuge praise the Lord and and you know then and uh uh yeah and there are a lot of other things that brother Branham talks about that we will be able to look into but let's let's stick with this thought tonight so I won't keep you long or else I will end up preaching two messages tonight I only have time for one now so we see here that God now gnawing the need of his people he sees uh he's making provision for them and he's making provision where his people can be able to help now you have to realize that Israel as the journey they never had no police station praise the Lord there was no police station if a man was caught doing evil and the Lord Justified his Stone to death there was no praising praise the Lord amen there was no praising you read over there in the book of Deuteronomy the Bible says if a man is caught doing something the the witness that saw him will be the first to Stone him why because if he's little proving that is wrong the witness also will be stoned to death you say you saw him you believe it it happened yeah okay you take the stone you'll be the first one to trade right praise the Lord there was no praising there was no police station they're there with it there and done praise the Lord amen now you can see why God is giving them this provision amen because they are still under the nature of sin honor the blood of bulls and God a man can tell lies and say I saw him doing it because I want them to kill these guys here I saw him doing it so God gnawing the nature of his people that's that's what I want to bring out tonight he knows our nature every one of us sitting here tonight he knows Where We Are in location toward the City of Refuge if he will place us on the map just like that map was on he knows our position spiritually where we are and how much we need to run to the city of The Refuge praise the Lord he knows the nature of his people he's making provision for them Hallelujah praise the Lord so there were three cities on the east side and there were three cities on the west praise the Lord you look at the City of Refuge it's it's tonight it's a Wednesday night you will see that uh [Music] you have this seated kiddish we could look through the different uh uh Bible verses on them but it would take us a whole lot as you you go through it but that that City carriage uh it's not that's not Kadesh bennel no this is a different kiddish praise the Lord but uh by the way if you look in the Book of Judges that was the city where uh Barack came out of so that was completely different from where the children of Israel you know uh uh turned down the promise where they saw the Giants and all of that that is completely different but this word means righteousness amen it means righteousness when you look at it in the Hebrew so God in their making provision for his people we know the Bible says they are the uh uh if a man was throwing an ax trying to cut wood in the head of the ash came out and hit another man and he died uh let his start running straight to the city The Refuge praise the Lord he gets to the city and he go to meet the high priest he missed the ever and he tell his story praise the Lord when you go to the center of Refuge nobody speaks for you you speak for yourself are we together amen I want us to keep in our mind that Jesus is our City of Refuge the name of the Lord is a mighty tower that the righteous run into praise the Lord amen we can share with people I'm dealing with this pray for me brother I'm struggling with this pray for me but you see the uh the father love it when you come and tell him your story praise the Lord when you come and say it to him just as a happen praise the Lord are we together why because he is our righteousness he is our righteousness you will see that the the Redemptive name play out in here as well and because he is our righteousness there is uh when you get into the City of Refuge we we you are Justified you tell your mother to uh uh to the high priest and uh you are receiving and and I mean you are you are protected as long as you are in the City of Refuge you can never be accused the second time praise the Lord amen you cannot go to the city of The Refuge and say Sir uh well well he he was the one that came in my space if he wouldn't have come in my no no I did it I'm guilty just as I am without no plea praise the Lord you don't make your own plea the high priest makes your play just like Christ makes our place you see this city also the next one is uh uh which means it means a shoulder it gets to the place of uh just like brother Branham says the shepherd carries the Sheep it's a city where Abraham started from back in Genesis chapter 12 you you read that but that is is so it has a place of uh uh a sense of a Shepherd that carries the Sheep which lay has been broken praise the Lord are we together so when we run into the the the cellar of Refuge we realize that because there is a shepherd and we need to be carried amen we can defend ourselves praise the Lord Abram was another City Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 8 the city is mentioned in you will see that this uh City uh Hebron it has a sense of meaning of Fellowship it means Fellowship we enter into fellowship with him praise the Lord when we go into the City of Refuge we enter into Fellowship with him praise the Lord the reason there is because when we go and tell our story when we go and confess our thought the high priest there is no reason for you to feel guilty amen the sense of feeling guilty is because you it means that you intentionally did it the reason why you can feel no guilt because you never did it in the first place or it was by mistake sure praise the Lord and you see when a person is dealing with guilt it's hard to enter into Fellowship praise the Lord so you see the center of Refuge uh uh hard and atmosphere that when we come into it we have to have confidence you have to have confidence that when you step your fault into that City the adventure of blood can do nothing to you you don't have to be looking over your shoulders you have to believe in the protection that it has given to you praise the Lord amen and that is the place where the believer should be we should believe that this Holy Ghost has everything in it amen we must believe that everything we need for our joining has been given to us you see that's the that's that's some of uh uh the the the problem the the the the the the Hebrew heart coming out of Egypt their problem was they could not believe there there was something better than the city they came out of amen going in the desert meeting the Red Sea we didn't have to deal with sea we have swimming pools praise the Lord every time the the meter challenge their mind goes back to Egypt they try to think of they make you know they they compare what Egypt was with what their trial is that I would have been better been back in Egypt praise the Lord if we don't believe that what God has given us in this hour as the message of the hour that we can find all our questions the answer to all of our questions if we if we can't come to that place to believe that there is not an additional word coming God has already given us everything we need for the body change praise the Lord you see that's the thing that gives you the desire to such the message that's the thing that gives you that desire to look for your answers in the scripture because you believe that everything is here you don't have to look elsewhere the man that runs into the City of Refuge you can you can stop thinking about your bank account outside you will not go back there because if you step outside the adventure of blood is going to get you so you have to believe that every provision that is made in this city is enough praise the Lord it makes you to go get into Fellowship you believe uh you have confidence that as long as the high priest is alive amen you imagine after after you you tell your story and the time of sacrifice arrive in the high priest brings you alarm and say son for the wrong that you have done this line is going to be slave for you praise the Lord how you appreciate it because here is it now you are in the City of Refuge you you you are a refugee here you don't you don't you don't have a farm you can bring a lamp Now alarm is provided for you praise the Lord you first have to be grateful that I have a lamb amen and the the the the the the confidence that it brings their eyes the priest takes you there and you lay your hand upon the lamb and you confess your fault the confidence that it gives you that the wrong that you have done has been placed under the blood of that bleeding lamb praise the Lord we have to remember that the worshiper was never on the examination amen the worshiper was never on the examination so he sees here that uh cadage speaks of righteousness he is our righteousness we can never be accused the second time speaks of a Shepherd he's the one that carried us praise the Lord he's he was the one that makes the provision there and then uh Hebron speaks of Fellowship and we have entered into fellowship with him praise the Lord bezel it speaks of Fortress he is our Fortress and in him we are safe praise the Lord he is our Fortress Raymond Raymond Gila speaks pretty much of the same it speaks of a height the word there means a height and uh and and yeah in the scripture that is associated with it goes directly back over to the book of Kings where he speaks of the city that Ahab wanted to go and redeem praise the Lord now brother Branham make us to realize Christ is revealed in his own word you talk about the Seven Seals you talk about the first horse rather you talk about uh uh the second horse rather you talk about the the the anointings of the living creatures and all of that he make us to realize that all of those things are there activities that happens around the seals but in Christ uh revealed in his own world brother Branham says what is the seal he said the seal is Christ the Lord amen the seal is Christ so you see this right from God's mind knowing the things that we would deal with there's there is there is a scripture over in the book of Deuteronomy let's read that chapter 5. uh I will I will soon close to you let's read verse 28 and verse 29. just for this uh prayer time chapter 5 verse 28. and the Lord year the voice of your words Moses now telling them when God spoke on the mountain and it was sounding like tundles and likely you have to remember now that's where Israel made their filter mistake in in Exodus chapter 19 word it says all that the laws here we would do now Moses is addressing them these are the last words of Moses he says and the Lord heard the voice of your words when ye speak unto me and the law said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of these people wish they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken oh that there were such and hot in them praise the Lord that they who fear me now God is referencing to what their mouth said but he's looking at their heart they were saying all that the laws have said we would do and their heart will stay in Egypt all that there was such an heart in them that they will fear me and keep all my commandment always that it might be well with them and with their children forever he said I I hear I hear their word I I heard you know then and they spoke well they spoke seriously but they not they didn't know how the heart for what their mouth was saying praise the Lord our God is not an idol we did not make the god that we are worshiping he made us and he knows us better than we know ourself praise the Lord he know us better young people then we know ourselves he knows our struggle he knows our doubts he knows our fear praise the Lord let's tell him he already knows how can you hide something from someone that already knows let's tell him let's deal with God from the heart because he's not impressed only by the words he's looking at our heart he's looking at the heart that is behind your word the heart that is behind your appearance the heart that is behind your desires your your strength and all of that he's looking at the heart are we together all that all that there was such a heart in them if they really had the heart for the things that they were saying all that the Lord says we will do and in no time they were about to Stone Moses because we are tired with this with this manner with his fleshing and we want to get back to Egypt praise the Lord so my thought tonight of bringing they saw a subject of the City of Refuge is not to go into mystery or go into anything tonight is to just help us to see that he's not very far from our need in whatsoever area that we lead God he's not far that's what the city was placed in those positions that when the people had a need there will be a city for them to rush into God is not far from our need his hands are not too heavy his ears and that block that he can hear most of the time the problem with the church is the heart is the heart of the people we allow prayer to sit in our heart unforgiveness to sit in our heart jealousies and all of those things to sit in our heart then we cannot go on with God you know we we just have this form of appearance but as soon as something happened that something happened between uh a brother and a sister or the sister and says the heart comes out the things that we say you can't even believe that my goodness that's my thought tonight he is not far from our need he is not far from our need even if it is sickness in our body he's not far from it praise the Lord if there is mind battles that we're going through he's not far from it praise the Lord he's a present help of trouble no matter what we are dealing with brother Branham will always point us back look at your motives and your objectives it goes back to your heart all that there was such a heart in there see see see the mind of God that he was not giving things to these people to punish them let me give them commandment let me see how much they love me no he was looking at their heart musicians you can come let's uh foreign oh that there was such a hard in them we pray tonight he is our our prayers we thank he listened to our Psalms we preach the word tonight he hears the things that we are talking about you see sometimes and even even being at being a minister you will see that uh sometimes that's that's the thing that drives the the preacher is the burden that he has on his heart the way he's feeling in his heart that the need the thing that he really want to bring to the people he goes all around the block and he's saying this and he's quoting this he's putting up another code it is just from his heart [Music] that just go to the Lord in prayer tonight this is a prayer meeting night let's put our hearts before the Lord [Music] even if you don't alter a word to the Lord tonight Lord my heart is father please come inside [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] won't you come inside your lord [Music] my heart is open please father tonight thank you God come inside [Applause] [Music] ever to you about thank you Jesus yes Lord I surrounded all tonight father I true why every door [Music] won't you come inside your lord I need you more and more water music play Softly all if there was such a heart in US [Music] with all the law that the father have shown to us all his grace all his Mercy thank you if there was such a heart in US for us to really receive what God has given to us for us to really cherish it that's the reason why the scripture said we must guide our hearts the heart is the most treasured part [Music] the more treasured part of our being your heart is even better than your bank account if we can keep our heart from every root of bitterness if we can keep our heart before the Lord in truth that there is no ill feelings in our heart realizing that the Lord is so night the Bible says Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your Wrath foreign [Music] the Lord is just a whispered away just a whisper oh if there was such a heart in us tonight I'm telling you if there was such a heart in us tonight if God can just find the heart that he needs and not a Pentecost would break here tonight if there was such a heart in US sometimes people say I need more of God it's something completely different they are Desiring their mouth is saying one thing their heart is Desiring of faith see all of these many worms that over the years they say I'm standing for this message I'm believing this message this message is my life but the heart was not there the heart was not ending oh Father by the god oh God if there was such a heart in US the man says I love you with all of my heart at the bear of the word in the forsake all others and live with you the rest of my life and we take those vows and right after the wedding you see people contrary to their vows and they are despising one another is because the heart was not there or if there was such a heart in us tonight and there was such a heart in us for the Lord tonight we have put God in them in a secondary place in our lives all the things are taking the primary place or if there was such a heart if we have such a heart to believe to believe that God [Music] is our provider if there was such a heart in us to put God first such a heart in us that he will have the preeminence the first place in our life but no matter what our challenge no matter what our our battle is no matter where our Struggle No matter whatever the devil is trying to use the Lord is just a whispered away it's just for you to call his name Jesus thank you the distance of the center of Refuge from a manslaughter was just to call his name Jesus let's play change my heart to God we just want to send that to the Lord let just worship Him let's sing our prayers to the Lord

Jesus is the name of the Lord Jesus is the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] name of the Lord my football [Music] the name of the Lord as strong power yeah the righteous from here [Music] dream about the glory to the name of the Lord reaching the name [Music] of the Lord [Music] glory to the name of the Lord the Lord [Music] brother Branham said just like how that raw was in the hands of Moses he says that's how the name of Jesus is to the church praise the Lord he says that's how the name of Jesus is to the church and uh he said if the Egyptian knew they would have just taken that role from Moses praise the Lord and when the name of Jesus is taken from the church that is that is very powerful that's very powerful trying to keep myself from preaching tonight but it's very powerful it's very very powerful you realize that is is right in the Ten Commandments the using of the Lord near me vain that's very powerful that's that's what has taken the power from the church because the name of the Lord is using vain the people are saying it and their heart is not in obedience to the world but let the Lord may the Lord be our help that's not the bride portion praise the Lord God has called us in this age and it's with the bride that Jesus is going to have the preeminence so he will have a people that will live up his name and he said if he be lifted up praise the Lord you will make all men to know amen so uh that's that's that that's the bride position but we can see why the church is in the condition it is because the name of the Lord is out of the church even though that we might be called this we might be called that but the name of the Lord is out of the church amen let's put him in this right place let's put him in his right place and uh the power will come back to the church the prophet of God said it will not be on our human effort you know he says it will surely be the grace of God back to the church and God is Desiring to move him on his people more than we are Desiring to see God move God is Desiring to heal his people his power to be seen we don't have to manufacture it we just have to line up with the word remember the brass Revival is lining up with the word the Lord bless you I will see you on Sunday pray for me I will pray for you blessed be the name of the Lord blessed [Music]
