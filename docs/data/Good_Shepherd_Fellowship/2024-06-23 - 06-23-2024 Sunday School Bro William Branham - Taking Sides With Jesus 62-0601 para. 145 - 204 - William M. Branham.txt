TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] in [Music] people tried them Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians and all tried to cast The Shadow on Jesus but them True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and seen no fault in it at all same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see Jesus and that's all they they they're predestinated eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and stay there we used to write sing a little song brother Roy uh roon we used to sing a little song Here guest time you come here I take the way with the Lord's despise few I started in with Jesus and I'm going through I'd rather walk with Jesus Jesus alone and have for my pillow like Jacob a stone well you've heard the little song that's right I'd rather take the way of the discard take the way of the despised take the way of the talked about and walk with Jesus see no fault in it at all don't see another Fell's eror just keep on going that's all now that's way they did to Jesus they didn't they didn't and you must teach your people pastors to do the same if somebody comes along and says uh you know uh your church they was so and so they yes sir they maybe a dozen of them sitting there then but how about that one it's it's it's all right sitting there see you're you're you're you just can't see the woods for the trees that's all that's it right back again see now and so they tried they was not willing to admit that he was doing the work of God so they were trying to so discard and get the people not to believe but them people who believe him stayed right with him they took Sid you know I thought you're a couple of people I got wrote down here the blind man would not be changed by them that man he just give his sign we know the story and um he gave them a very stinging question besides now they come up there and Jesus walked by he was a man that was despised and hated the Bible said he would be rejected uh there be no beauty of him we should desire him and all we like sheep have gone astray is a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and how all the Bible said what he would be he'd be despised and rejected and we see that man now those who believe the word they know that the very things that Jesus was doing and the things was of his life they knew who he was so they couldn't put nothing BL on him because they couldn't see it amen and you know love is blind anyhow that thing love covers up a multitude of sin you know perfect love cast out fear and sin all Discord love does now this blind man was sitting there and Jesus and his disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave them a little lesson here when they seen this poor blind man they thought well now surely there a sin behind that somewhere when we see something happen to a man we always say well he sin he got out of the will of the Lord somewhere brother CHR hit the post he got out of the way of the Lord somewhere in somebody's idea when the gun blow up on me well is out of the will of the Lord Brother Neville hit the car is out of the will of the Lord that's not exactly right no sir it isn't God permits those things Jesus turned around and taught him a lesson they said his father must have Sinn or or did his mother sin or did he sin Jesus said neither of them sin but that the works of God might be made manifest amen see God lets things happen just to for the works of God to be made manifest amen now and so he said told the man and give him his sight and when he's waiting and here come the Pharisees up when that was rumored around here was the man as blind set now they're begging and here he could see and that's rumored around among him and oh my that stirred up something and here they come up there and they see that the blind man could see and first they went wanted to find some way to put a fear upon all the people because they had already said if anybody goes after this new doctrine and this new Prophet called Jesus of Nazareth immediately they'll be handed their paper and fellowship from the church they cannot go to synagogue no longer if you associate with him 10 one of his meetings or anything you can't go no more so they want to make a display out of it because they hated him they wasn't thinking of that poor blind man but they wanted to make a big display to make the people keep away from him they said they wanted to ask his father and mother so they went and got the father and mother they said is this your son he said yes sir was he born blind yes sir and uh what means does he see and the father and mother was afraid the Bible said because they know they'd be put out of the synagogue if they admitted it it was you see there he was taken down they said now we know this is our son all probably a few thousand people stand there but if he could if them stinking Pharisees could have only put a blight on his name right there done something to scare the people they' run him out of there for that meeting see amen all of his influence have been lost so they said uh a bunch of them come up there at their Priestly garments on and they said uh speak for him they said we know this is our son we know he was born blind but now how he sees I don't know you ask him he's of age see all right so they went over and got him said who give you your sight how do he heal him he said uh one called Jesus of Nazareth give me my sight and they said give praise to God said well we know this man's a sinner said uh and I said whence is he he said I don't know he just come by and heal me that's all I know about I know one thing I do know I couldn't tell you about him being a sinner or not I don't know I've just met the man today but if if he could give me my my sight I know this one thing that where I was once blind I could now see I'm sure of that for I was blind a half hour ago and now I got just as good a sign as any you fell so I know I can see oh what a stinger that put on them so they thought well he said well I said you all want to be his disciples too that's good that's good solid testimony that that that's good that's good backgrounds that that that's really good witnessing what I think said to you all here's a lay member a blind man standing on the street after meeting Jesus now asking the disciple asking the Pharisees if they want to be his disciples the Bishops headman you want to be his disciples also they said nay you're his disciple we're Moses disciple looking way back down through history you know we're Moses disciples this man we don't know nothing about him we don't know where he come from or we haven't got a rule of any of our schools he ever come up he never come and ask us about these things see we don't know nothing about it you people out there you're realiz that man's not ordained that man's a souser or something he's BBA you're being Bewitched why he doesn't have any Authority we haven't give it to him yet see we don't even know whence this man comes from this old boy standing there could see said now this is a marvelous thing see he's about to get the people be down these Pharisees while make them afraid see but he had done tough signes with Jesus am see so he said uh this is a marvelous thing let me break it down some of the words he might have said now you fellas around here has been running all the religious end of this for hundreds of years and uh you speak of a coming Messiah and something is going to take place just in the shadows of time when the deliverers coming to see us and you tell us that when he comes that that what all he's going to do and here you the spiritual leaders the high priest and priest of this community standing here together before these people trying to Blacken his name trying to say something evil against him and the man come and open my blinded eye I was born blind here's my father and mother giving witness that I was born blind been sitting right here among you for all these years born blind and that has never happened since the world began amen and you're a man can come and perform a miracle that hasn't been done since the world began and you the spiritual leaders and don't know nothing about it am I say this is a harvest thing he took sides with Jesus see he was permitted to be blind so the works of God could be manifested see because he come on the side of the Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he put a stinger to him you know what they did they said now we know you were born in sin try to te just and shoved him out of the church knocked him out pushed him out throw him out but as soon as he was sold out did you notice Jesus found him again amen amen Lord Jesus found him again so don't worry if they throw you out he'll find you again amen all right and he said to him does thou believe on the Son of God he said Lord who is he he didn't even know but the only thing that he know that where he was blind he could then see am I know this one thing brother they might call this fanaticism and whatever they want to but wh and I was once the sinner I've come into Grace now something has happened to me see this one thing I I now know by trusting his word by believing him I've been kicked out of every organization under the face of Heaven there's none of them that will receive me anymore you know that some of their man will out here a good man will accept but every organization is thumbs down on me that's right but he's found me you'll find me somewhere that's that's right come along like that and um so it'll be all right because we want to take sides with Jesus and the only way you take sides with Jesus is taking sides on what he said believe in his word so let's take sides with him the blind man gave him a real testimony all right we find again that they tried to blight his name just for a little bit and um I've got to skip over some things here so um one time there's a Pharisee I preached on it here some time ago and called it washing Jesus feet I believe you all heard me preach on that here when a Pharisee asked Jesus to come down to his house a big old stiff starch Pharisee and asked him to come and you know I gave it a little drama how The Courier come and found him and he come on down yet he know he was hated yet he went any and when they got him in there they never washed his feet and let him sit down there stinking and everything else in the T of the road and there he sat there and a little woman come in they thought oh my the Lord is good to us because look this just brings our big party they brought him Mar just to make fun out of him they brought him Mar just to have some fun from him and now they thought the Lord was working right with them because that this ill Fame prostitute woman come over and was crying in his feet with their tears and WIP him with his hair and old Pharisee and all the rest of priests stand on the corner that brother everything the Lord said it up just exactly for us here we can put a smear on his name right now he calls himself a prophet and the people thinks that he's a prophet and they call him the Galilean prophet and he even claims to be the Messiah and we know Messiah will be a prophet and Y is sitting back there you see where we brought him look at there boy we got him fixed right now there he is sitting back there stoop down like a whipped out puppy or something back there and some prostitute of his own class would come around and wash his feet like that and now he don't even know if he's a prophet he'll know what kind of a woman that was now boys we'll drink on this one said because look there see anything to blight his name anything to ruin the confidence of the people not knowing that they were possessed of the devil to do that they were working in harmony with the devil trying to blacken the name of the son of God how did they do this Brethren because they never searched the scriptures amen Jesus said search you the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me am oh what a Ministry he had yes sir if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me see but you hear this Pharisees said we got him now oh look here there's probably 1500 people here this Feast now look at him sitting over there there he sits with a prostitute and oh my what a horrible thing that was in that day and there he was with an ill- Fame woman slipped in like look like he slipped in he got by the foot wash flunky and everything else and S there and said here she was over there washing his feet now if he was a prophet you see brother that man's no Prophet if he was a prophet then he' know what manner of woman that was washing his feet and Jesus just sat and watched her never moved her foot till she got on if you're going to do something for Jesus Jesus set and watch you do it sometimes he let you go ahead till you get finished then the reward comes maybe you run the whole race of Life working for him but don't worry there's a reward at the end if you just take your away with his side you might not not see one person he'll that you pray for just keep on praying for him I've often said if I prayed for 500 tonight all 500 dead in the morning tomorrow night I'll be preaching Divine Healing and praying for the sick amen don't have one thing to do with it see he'll let you come right down through defeats and everything else till he come right down to the end of the road and finish your work like he let that woman she wanted to do him a service so he just held his feet out there and let let her wash him or if he said don't do that she' have jumped and run but he let her do the service and after she got through finished the Serv service that she was going to do then he looked up to that hypocrite standing back there was trying to cast the Blackness on his name said Simon I've got something to say to you not to her but to you you standing back there in your heart that's the reason you brought me down here you had no fellowship with me didn't I know it but you brought me down here and you sent me back here to make fun fun of me let you never give me no water to wash my feet you never give me nothing to soothe me me sitting here burning and hurting you never give me no oil for my face you ashamed to kiss me welcome or shake my hand you ashamed before your company he ashamed to do it this woman since she's come in she's did nothing but rubbed my feet and bathe them with the very tears of her eyes wiped him with the towel of her own hair then I'll just show you where I'm a prophet or not I like that now I want to speak to you just a minute your sins which are many are all forgiven [Music] you did they blind his name they thought they had it they thought they had stopped it they thought they'd fix him so his Revival could never be in that Community they thought they' ru his influence but it just taken one person that loved him to turn the whole situation how do you know that you're not that person for your community or somebody that you'll meet take sides with him do him a service do something for him you know what I mean Brethren take your side with Jesus Take it make him your choice do service for regardless of whether anybody else or you're ever repaid or anything don't make any difference wait till the work's over how would you like for him to say even though you had prayed for sick and they didn't get well though you prayed to get to speak with tongues you didn't do it you prayed to prophesy you didn't do it but yet the only thing you do is tell the story of Jesus in your church or in your community at your work you couldn't even do one thing didn't lead one person that woman didn't lead one to Christ but she done a service for him amen what difference does it make at the end of the road if he'll say and I say unto you all your sins oh there not one prayer was answered for you but you come on the basis of my word amen you come because you believe me and you did me a service and I say that the many sins that you have done is all forgiven you that would be good enough for me amen yes sir all right they want to say the days of Miracles are passed and and so forth let them go ahead and say it but let us do the service for the Lord they hated him because they were jealous of him that's the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they're doing now they fing just in just destroy the influence of the message before the people then they've got the thing whipped that's right amen because why did they try to do it because he was against all their Creeds of and all their Church doctrines and everything that they believed in and called all their all their faiths and so forth he was against it all and they hated him because he didn't barge in with them amen now if he' to come in said okay Ephesus marvelous man of my father I am Messiah come here K Ephesus do you see that water there you remember down in in Egypt uh Moses a great prophet turned it into um into blood you remember that CIS oh young fell I'm very well acquainted with that story all right cesis I'm going to turn the water now from water to blood to show you that I am that Prophet that Moses spoke of there it is cesis what do you think about it what do you think about cus being a Pharisee what do you think about the Pharisees oh I think there're a marvelous race of people oh you all keep the traditions of the fathers just exactly right you know you could be the Messiah no he wouldn't have been amen that would have been a very Mark that he wasn't amen when you see somebody come say come here and I'll show you what I'll do and come here I'll do this and do that you remember right now there's something Shady about it to start with Jesus said I'll do nothing till the father shows me first yes he was against them he taught against him he condemned their Sabbath keeping he condemned the way they dressed he condemned all the ways of their life amen all their Traditions all their pot washing and K washing and hand washing and everything else he condemned it every bit you know dressings he said you wear broad garments and desire the high seats and and make long prayers and the W of our winess home said you receive more damnation well remember I'm doctor so I don't care who you are oh man he really put on they did why because they didn't believe him he was the word see he was trying to break up that legalistic Bunch amen and if he's here on Earth today try to do the same thing amen some people say well now wait a minute we keep the Sabbath every we do this and uh you know we keep all this and we keep that and every why every Good Friday while when fast time comes on 40 days before Easter we always observe lent I give up smoking for 40 days I give up drinking for 40 days before during time of Lent oh tradition of the fathers legalist if you love God you you don't smoke in the first place you love God you I I wrote in the back of my little bible first one I ever had I said don't ask me foolish questions make this up in your mind if you love the Lord with all your heart you don't smoke drink or or don't smoke Che or drink any shine and that still stands good today I don't do it because I think he condemns me for doing it I would quit it because it's a dirty thing and isn't BEC coming to a minister amen right I wouldn't say many times I go to houses and there are women standing out there and I go to the house knock on the door and a sister come the door just come in brother Brandon if her husband's not there unless it's a case of sickness and somebody with me I don't go and then call me to a hospital or to a room say brother BR come over here I'm sister so and so from so and so I'm here at the hotel I I I brought my mother along she's sick I take my wife if I don't take some other brother see I I don't I don't think I think it'd be all right for me to go in there but why does somebody see me go in there see why don't somebody see me do it see then the first thing you know they' say he went in there where that woman was he's chasing after women that see that would be a a thing I should do see you shouldn't never do anything like that CU you put a stumbling in somebody else's way see I don't believe that I would do anything wrong in there it wouldn't I wouldn't trust God to go in there no matter what the thing was I'd trust God but yet you see and and and I love the Lord well enough till I wouldn't do it see it's a love you have you you're not do it because it's a duty to do it you do it because you love the Lord you don't have to do it but you do it anyhow now Paul said to me all things are lawful but not all are expedient see Paul could do lots of things that maybe that he know the Lord understood him and trusted him but it wasn't expedient for him to do it so that's a way these legalists trying to say 40 days before Easter we always starting to fast and they eat just as much as they ever do maybe they say well I don't like beans so I'll give up beans for Lent I've heard them say that I don't like pork so I'll just give up pork you know I'm going to quit drinking for Lent one woman told me said you know what I give up for Lent this year brother R I said no I said candy said I I never really care too much for it anyhow see there you are now they call that fasting see legalism they say well I got to you know I I I stagger a church a long time because I tell you I kept Sunday school for a full year because my teacher said if they give a Bible to the one that didn't miss a a [Music] [Music]
