[1:35] so
[1:38] [Music]
[2:18] eye of cephas was ever exhibited it was
[2:21] now
[2:22] there were lutherans hussites swingly's
[2:24] party etc
[2:26] such fragmentation of the body was
[2:27] deplorable they were living a name but
[2:30] were dead certainly they were dead they
[2:33] died the minute they organized
[2:35] the great groups organized and tied
[2:37] themselves in matrimony to the state
[2:39] that did it they were finished
[2:42] here were those lutherans who had
[2:43] criticized the roman church
[2:45] they knew the unrighteousness of
[2:47] political and spiritual unions yet
[2:49] luther as when peter was over balanced
[2:52] by the judaizers went right ahead and
[2:54] made the state instead of god the
[2:56] defender of the faith
[2:58] this is the first denomination of repute
[3:00] that came out of the harlot
[3:02] but when luther died it was not long
[3:04] until it had a hierarchy like the one it
[3:06] had fought
[3:07] this move of god by the time the second
[3:10] generation came along was right back
[3:12] under the wing of her mother
[3:14] she had gone back and did not even know
[3:15] it
[3:16] they had taken on their own name above
[3:18] his name
[3:19] they were living their own name too
[3:22] and all the denominations are doing that
[3:24] very thing today
[3:26] they are living their own name and not
[3:27] the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:30] that is easily seen for every church is
[3:32] known by the way it worships but none
[3:34] are known by the power of god
[3:36] there is your test
[3:38] and i want you to notice right here that
[3:40] this era did not have the signs and
[3:42] wonders amongst them
[3:44] they gave up the power of god for the
[3:46] power of the state
[3:47] they clung to their own name
[3:49] they made their names great
[3:52] it was that old spirit of getting
[3:53] everyone into its fold
[3:55] today the baptists want the methodists
[3:57] to come over to the baptists
[3:59] the methodists are out to proselytize
[4:01] the presbyterians
[4:03] and the pentecostals want them all
[4:05] each claims to offer the most and to
[4:07] hold out the greatest hopes
[4:09] a sort of door to heaven or at least the
[4:11] way to a more abundant entrance
[4:13] how tragic it all is
[4:16] this denominational spirit has made all
[4:18] the denominations write their manuals
[4:20] and teach their creeds
[4:22] set up their offices and church
[4:23] governments and then each claims that
[4:25] she and she alone truly speaks for god
[4:28] as she is the best qualified
[4:30] now if that isn't exactly what the pope
[4:32] and the roman church are doing
[4:34] they are right back there with their
[4:36] mother the harlot and don't know it
[4:39] in closing our comments on this verse
[4:42] thou hast to name that thou livest and
[4:44] are dead
[4:45] i cannot impress upon you too strongly
[4:47] that this age though it brought the
[4:49] reformation was most sternly rebuked by
[4:52] god instead of being praised because it
[4:55] sewed the seed of denomination that
[4:57] organized right back to the harlot
[4:59] after god had opened a door of escape
[5:02] when the move away from the catholic
[5:04] church took place it was not truly
[5:06] spiritual as a whole but more political
[5:09] most of the people took up with
[5:11] protestantism because as i have stated
[5:13] they hated the roman system of political
[5:15] and financial bondage
[5:17] thus instead of this being a great
[5:19] spiritual move with all the earmarks of
[5:21] holy spirit influence as when god used
[5:24] purely spiritual means to accomplish his
[5:26] ends at pentecost
[5:27] it was indeed a work wherein the wrath
[5:30] of man praised god
[5:32] and the results paralleled the history
[5:34] of israel when she left egypt and
[5:36] wandered in the desert not making it to
[5:38] canaan land
[5:40] however much was accomplished in that
[5:42] where the yoke of rome was even partly
[5:44] broken men could now receive the word of
[5:46] god and yield to the influence of the
[5:49] spirit without such great fear as
[5:51] formerly this opened the door to the
[5:53] great missionary age that followed
[5:55] the jezebel of thyatira was in no mood
[5:58] to give up her hold upon the people and
[6:00] thus we see her daughter athelia raise
[6:02] her head in the sardisian age with the
[6:04] hopes that she would be able to strangle
[6:06] the true seed by her schemes of
[6:08] organization
[6:10] the warning
[6:12] revelation 3 2
[6:15] be watchful and strengthen the things
[6:17] which remain that are ready to die for i
[6:19] have not found thy works perfect before
[6:21] god
[6:23] i wish it could be said that the
[6:24] sardisian age was a restoration instead
[6:26] of a reformation
[6:28] i cannot say that
[6:30] the word does not call it a restoration
[6:32] but certainly calls it a reformation
[6:34] had it been a restoration that age would
[6:36] have been another pentecostal age
[6:38] but it was not
[6:40] the best that could be said of it was
[6:42] strengthen that which remains that is
[6:45] ready to die
[6:47] there was something missing
[6:48] my yes there certainly was
[6:51] this age had justification but it had
[6:53] missed sanctification and the baptism
[6:55] with the holy ghost
[6:57] that is what god's original plan was
[7:00] that is what they had at pentecost
[7:02] they were justified they were sanctified
[7:05] and were filled with the holy ghost
[7:07] why listen to me the reason for being
[7:10] justified and sanctified is to the end
[7:12] that you might be baptized with the holy
[7:14] ghost
[7:15] that is the reason that there is a
[7:17] church
[7:18] it is the temple of god filled with god
[7:20] even the holy ghost
[7:22] the same spirit that was in jesus while
[7:24] he was here on earth causing him to do
[7:26] the mighty works which he did came back
[7:28] upon the church at pentecost so that
[7:31] they did the works that he did
[7:33] this age did not have those works
[7:35] oh they had the written word but not the
[7:38] revealed word
[7:39] this was the reformation period
[7:42] but fear not little flock god said
[7:45] i will restore
[7:46] and this reform was going to be the
[7:48] start of it
[7:49] he was going to according to his promise
[7:52] take the church back from the depth of
[7:54] satan in the dark ages to the depth of
[7:56] god that they had at pentecost
[7:58] and in the first few years of the
[7:59] existence of the church
[8:02] now be careful and get this
[8:05] it says in the second verse that i read
[8:08] for i have not found thy works perfect
[8:10] before god do you know what the meaning
[8:13] of not perfect really is
[8:15] it is unfulfilled
[8:17] this age was an unfulfilled age
[8:20] it was just the start of getting back
[8:23] that is why i said the bible called it
[8:25] reformation
[8:26] not restoration
[8:28] it had started out in the doctrine of
[8:30] justification which meant salvation was
[8:32] all of god
[8:34] oh how luther preached the sovereignty
[8:36] of god and election
[8:37] he knew it was all of grace he separated
[8:40] the church from rule by ecclesiastical
[8:42] hierarchy
[8:44] he tore down the idols he cast out the
[8:46] confessions to the priests he denounced
[8:49] the pope
[8:50] it was wonderfully good as he started
[8:52] but god had said fifteen hundred years
[8:54] before
[8:55] luther you are going to start things but
[8:57] your age will see it all unfulfilled i
[9:00] am leaving that to later
[9:02] hallelujah our god raineth
[9:04] he knows the end from the beginning
[9:07] yes luther was his messenger
[9:09] it didn't look like it as we examine the
[9:11] flaws
[9:12] but there was a man called jonah he had
[9:15] flaws in his life too
[9:17] he was a prophet though you and i might
[9:18] not want to say so on the basis of how
[9:20] he acted but god knows them that are his
[9:24] and he has his way just as he did with
[9:26] jonah
[9:27] he had his way with luther in that age
[9:29] and he will have his way until the
[9:31] consummation
[9:33] now this was an unfulfilled age it was
[9:36] an age of reformation
[9:37] but that is how god wanted it
[9:40] i want to illustrate that to you the way
[9:42] i did to a very wonderful lutheran
[9:44] brother who was a president of a very
[9:45] fine seminary out west
[9:48] i had been invited to his place to have
[9:50] dinner with him and to speak to him
[9:52] concerning the holy spirit
[9:54] he was puzzled about many things and he
[9:56] said to me
[9:57] what have we lutherans got
[9:59] i said
[10:00] well you have christ
[10:02] he said
[10:03] we want the holy ghost do you think
[10:05] we've got it
[10:06] i said
[10:08] potentially you are believing unto it
[10:10] he said what do you mean potentially we
[10:13] are hungry for god
[10:15] we read a book on pentecost and the
[10:17] gifts of the spirit
[10:18] so some of us flew out to california to
[10:20] see the author
[10:22] when we got there he told us that though
[10:23] he had written the book he did not have
[10:25] the gifts
[10:26] now when we saw the operation of gifts
[10:28] in your ministry we wanted to talk to
[10:30] you
[10:31] for you must know something about them
[10:34] now this brothers seminary is out in the
[10:36] country and surrounded by many acres of
[10:38] farmland on which the students can work
[10:41] and thereby pay their way through
[10:42] college
[10:43] he also has factories that go along with
[10:45] the farm to give added employment
[10:48] so using his fields to illustrate my
[10:50] case i said
[10:51] once there was a man who went forth on
[10:53] his own ground to plant a field of corn
[10:56] he pulled up the stumps cleared off the
[10:58] rocks plowed and disked it and then
[11:00] planted his corn
[11:02] each morning he looked out across the
[11:04] field
[11:05] but one morning instead of barren ground
[11:07] he saw myriads of little blades coming
[11:09] up he said
[11:10] praise god for my field of corn
[11:13] i then asked him
[11:14] did the man have corn
[11:16] he said
[11:18] well in one way he did
[11:20] i said
[11:21] potentially yes
[11:23] and that was you lutherans in the
[11:24] reformation putting forth your blade see
[11:27] the corn began to grow
[11:29] after it had rotted in the ground during
[11:31] the dark ages
[11:33] after several joints there were fine
[11:34] large stalks and one day a tassel of
[11:37] silk appeared
[11:38] that tassel of silk looked down at the
[11:40] blades and said you old formal lutherans
[11:43] haven't anything
[11:44] look at us we're the breeders the great
[11:46] missionaries
[11:48] our day is the missionary era
[11:50] that tassel age was the wesleyan age
[11:53] they were the greatest missionaries and
[11:54] even excelled us in our age
[11:56] what did that age do
[11:58] it scattered like pollen in the breeze
[12:01] now what is the next step
[12:04] logically we think that is the actual
[12:06] forming and harvesting of the grain the
[12:08] completed cycle
[12:09] but not so
[12:11] there is another stage
[12:13] that stage is when the husk or chaff is
[12:15] formed to cover the seed
[12:17] and that is exactly what happened in
[12:18] this spiritual cycle
[12:20] at the turn of the 20th century in the
[12:22] start of the laodicean age there was
[12:24] widespread belief that the holy ghost
[12:26] was falling exactly as he did at
[12:28] pentecost
[12:29] people were talking in tongues and
[12:31] claiming to be baptized with the holy
[12:33] ghost with the evidence of speaking in
[12:35] tongues
[12:36] but i have walked in the grain fields
[12:38] many times and there in late summer i
[12:40] have plucked the heads of wheat and
[12:42] rubbed them in my hand to get some grain
[12:44] when to my surprise there wasn't any
[12:47] corn of wheat in that chaff
[12:49] though indeed it surely looked as if
[12:50] wheat were there
[12:52] this is a perfect picture of the
[12:54] so-called pentecostal move
[12:56] and that this is a proven fact is found
[12:58] in that these people organized on a
[13:01] doctrine
[13:02] and bound themselves right back as did
[13:04] the organization ahead of them proving
[13:06] that instead of being the real seed they
[13:09] were the chaff for protecting cover for
[13:11] the wheat seed which should come
[13:13] this chaff stage was the danger period
[13:15] that jesus spoke of in matthew 24 24
[13:19] deceiving the very elect if it were
[13:20] possible
[13:22] o man felt that this husk the so-called
[13:25] pentecostal age was the true seed but it
[13:27] proved to be just the carrier to carry
[13:29] the life over into the age in which the
[13:31] true restoration comes and the wheat
[13:33] bride is manifested in the power spoken
[13:35] of by ezekiel 47 2-5
[13:40] then brought he me out of the way of the
[13:42] gate northward and led me about the way
[13:44] without unto the utter gate by the way
[13:47] that looketh eastward
[13:48] and behold there ran out waters on the
[13:51] right side
[13:52] and when the man that had the line in
[13:54] his hand went forth eastward he measured
[13:56] a thousand cubits
[13:58] and he brought me through the waters the
[14:00] waters were to the ankles again he
[14:02] measured a thousand and brought me
[14:04] through the waters the waters were to
[14:06] the knees
[14:07] again he measured a thousand and brought
[14:09] me through
[14:10] the waters were to the loins
[14:12] afterward he measured a thousand and it
[14:15] was a river that i could not pass over
[14:17] for the waters were risen waters to swim
[14:20] in a river that could not be passed over
[14:24] and the way that it was done was by
[14:26] god's perfect will and programming
[14:28] the lutherans had the holy ghost
[14:30] potentially under justification the
[14:32] methodists had it potentially under
[14:34] sanctification and today it is brought
[14:36] back a restoration
[14:38] the holy ghost is here
[14:40] be watchful and strengthen the things
[14:42] which remain that are ready to die
[14:45] now the ideas expressed in the two words
[14:47] watchful and strengthened are these
[14:50] to watch contains not only the idea of
[14:52] being awake but to be alert
[14:55] to be otherwise insinuates danger and
[14:57] loss
[14:58] to strengthen means more than just to
[15:00] give strength it means to fix and
[15:02] establish for permanency
[15:04] these two commands refer to what is left
[15:06] of the truth which itself is ready or
[15:09] about to die
[15:10] this expression of the spirit comes
[15:12] before me as an illustration
[15:15] a group of slaves in total bondage
[15:17] physically and morally have risen up and
[15:19] escape from their captors
[15:21] indeed that is what sardis means the
[15:23] escaped ones
[15:25] they are pursued and their great and
[15:26] glorious gains are all but lost
[15:29] they have not been retaken but about all
[15:31] that can be said is that they have
[15:33] escaped
[15:34] not clean escaped as some were according
[15:36] to the word
[15:37] they had lost much of their liberties
[15:40] now the lord says
[15:41] you are potentially back in captivity
[15:44] see that you don't go back
[15:46] to keep from going back become alert and
[15:48] remain ever watchful concerning the
[15:50] things of your captivity or you will
[15:52] lose all
[15:53] strengthen yourself now and what you
[15:55] have left in such a manner as to
[15:57] permanently establish what you have and
[15:59] thus ensure against future loss
[16:02] this will be your opportunity to fulfill
[16:04] what you have not fulfilled
[16:06] but did they go on no sir
[16:09] they did not heed the voice of the
[16:11] spirit and another age went into
[16:12] captivity and so god raised up others
[16:15] who would carry out his will
[16:17] god bypassed the lutheran denomination
[16:19] as he has all others and they will never
[16:22] come back
[16:23] god had to go on and in a new age bring
[16:26] further truth and a little more
[16:27] restoration
[16:29] judgment
[16:31] revelation 3 3
[16:34] remember therefore how thou has received
[16:36] and heard and hold fast and repent
[16:39] if therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[16:42] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[16:45] not know the hour i will come upon thee
[16:48] i want to read another translation
[16:50] west of this verse
[16:53] be remembering therefore in what way you
[16:55] have received the truth as a permanent
[16:57] deposit and what way you heard it and be
[17:00] safeguarding it and have a change of
[17:02] mind at once
[17:04] it is very evident from this verse that
[17:06] god had given them truth as a permanent
[17:08] deposit
[17:09] it was received and is irrevocably
[17:11] theirs
[17:12] it now remains to be seen what they will
[17:14] do with it whether they will regard it
[17:16] or not
[17:17] and that is true
[17:19] they have been given the basic truth of
[17:21] the whole gospel the just shall live by
[17:24] faith salvation is of the lord
[17:26] they had heard the truth of the bible
[17:28] which cast down the doctrines of rome
[17:30] and said at not all papal authority
[17:34] they knew the truth that the church does
[17:35] not save they understood the lord's
[17:38] supper
[17:39] they had light on water baptism
[17:41] they put out the images
[17:43] truth
[17:44] why there never was an age with any more
[17:46] men and so much light to shed
[17:48] they had enough illumination to
[17:49] completely overhaul the old system or
[17:51] start out fresh and let god lead them
[17:54] lying upon line and precept upon precept
[17:57] they received the truth
[17:59] they wanted it and heard it
[18:01] but the question was how did they hear
[18:03] it
[18:04] did they hear it to build upon or was it
[18:06] with the same attitude that many greeks
[18:08] had
[18:09] something to discuss and theorize over
[18:11] evidently the rich word of truth was
[18:14] being heard in an academic manner rather
[18:16] than for practical outworking
[18:18] for god was demanding a change of mind
[18:20] concerning it
[18:22] if this is the word of god which indeed
[18:24] it is then it must be obeyed
[18:27] failure to obey would bring judgment
[18:30] when the guards of the sacred temple
[18:31] were found sleeping they were beaten and
[18:33] their garments burned
[18:34] what shall the lord do to those who in
[18:36] this age have relaxed their guard
[18:39] i will come on thee as a thief ancient
[18:42] sardis was constantly harassed by
[18:44] bandits that swooped down from the hills
[18:46] and pillaged the people
[18:48] thus they knew only too well what the
[18:49] spirit was saying and that the coming of
[18:51] the lord is as a thief
[18:53] vigilance and preparation alone will
[18:55] suffice to be ready for his coming
[18:58] now we know that this is a message for
[19:00] the false find for the coming of the
[19:02] lord will be as it was in the days of
[19:04] noah
[19:05] the eight saved were well aware of the
[19:07] impending flood
[19:08] and being aware were prepared and saved
[19:11] but the world of the ungodly was swept
[19:14] away
[19:15] though they daily were in contact with
[19:17] the righteous and heard the truth they
[19:19] turned it aside until it was too late
[19:22] those completely carnal people in that
[19:23] ancient period type out today the
[19:25] nominal christians whose lives are full
[19:28] of earthly things and take pleasure in
[19:30] them to such an extent that they have no
[19:32] desire for the spiritual and are not at
[19:35] all aware of nor readied for his
[19:37] appearing
[19:39] the eulogy
[19:41] revelation 3 4
[19:44] thou has a few names even in sardis
[19:46] which have not defiled their garments
[19:49] and they shall walk with me in white for
[19:51] they are worthy
[19:53] of course the word names means people
[19:56] as it says in acts 1 15 concerning those
[19:59] in the upper room
[20:01] the number of names together were about
[20:02] 120
[20:04] but to me it goes far beyond just
[20:06] signifying people
[20:08] it brings out that truth that is set
[20:10] forth in every age which was spoken to
[20:12] us by our lord with great emphasis
[20:14] it is this
[20:16] the church system of these ages is made
[20:17] up of two vines true and false
[20:21] god in his own sovereign purpose has put
[20:23] them all together calling them the
[20:24] church
[20:26] see in this age how he has rebuked them
[20:28] saying
[20:29] unto the church which is
[20:31] not churches are in sardis but lumping
[20:34] them together
[20:35] the church which is
[20:37] i know thy works
[20:39] you are dead
[20:40] your works are unfulfilled
[20:43] and then he goes on
[20:45] thou
[20:45] this church in sardis
[20:47] has to few people in you that are right
[20:50] and not wrong like the majority
[20:52] these walk in clean garments and they
[20:54] are worthy of me
[20:56] now these people that were the true
[20:57] saints of god were walking all pleasing
[21:00] unto the lord their garments were clean
[21:03] you see in those days the garments would
[21:05] sweep along on the road and pick up dirt
[21:07] and defilement
[21:09] these were watching how they walked so
[21:11] that they were not corrupted by the
[21:12] world
[21:14] they were in the spirit and walking in
[21:15] the spirit they were holy and without
[21:18] blame before him
[21:20] thus they were fulfilling their purpose
[21:21] for that is what ephesians 1 4 says is
[21:25] the purpose of god for us
[21:27] that we should be holy and without blame
[21:29] before him
[21:31] now from this verse which shows the
[21:33] elect of god to be a few names
[21:35] you can see clearly what we have been
[21:37] teaching about this age
[21:39] it was chaotic it was unfulfilled it was
[21:42] split scores of ways and god rebuked it
[21:45] almost in its entirety
[21:47] it was weak and sickly and ready to die
[21:50] it was not the glorious era that
[21:52] carnal-minded protestant historians have
[21:54] tried to make it
[21:56] one quick look at that tree saw it was
[21:58] cankered and blighted denuded of leaf
[22:00] and barren of fruit except for some
[22:02] deformed and wormy fruit that was fast
[22:04] dropping to the ground
[22:06] but hold a moment look closer
[22:09] there at the top in the light of the sun
[22:11] were some first fruits a few names
[22:15] perfect in him for they were born of him
[22:17] filled with him and walking with him by
[22:19] his word
[22:21] thank god for those few
[22:24] and they shall walk with me
[22:27] that is what god says he will bestow
[22:29] upon them for this upright walk that is
[22:31] part of their inheritance that he has
[22:33] reserved for them
[22:34] if they were willing to walk with him
[22:36] through the toils and snares of life and
[22:38] be an honor to him he was going to
[22:40] reward them
[22:42] he is not forgetful of our labor of love
[22:44] god will always recompense us for our
[22:46] efforts to please him
[22:49] yes they had walked through the world
[22:50] and had not partaken of it
[22:52] they had not let the world systems
[22:54] overcome them
[22:56] from the illustrious names of that age
[22:58] had yielded to the blandishment of the
[22:59] state and chosen political mindedness
[23:02] rather than spiritual mindedness and
[23:04] were on their way back into the world
[23:07] these few stood for the word of god and
[23:09] thereby honored the lord
[23:11] now he would honor them in return
[23:14] for they shall walk with him in white
[23:16] they had identified themselves with him
[23:18] on earth and now he would identify
[23:20] himself with them in the new jerusalem
[23:23] and how marvelous will be that
[23:24] identification
[23:26] it makes me rejoice and yet it makes me
[23:28] weep to think of his condescension for
[23:31] you will note that he is not dressed in
[23:33] another color different from the saints
[23:35] as earthly leaders would so do
[23:37] no they are like him he is like them
[23:41] they are like him even as john said for
[23:44] they see him as he is
[23:47] for they are worthy do you realize who
[23:51] is saying this
[23:52] it is jesus the worthy one himself
[23:56] this is the only one who is accounted
[23:58] worthy to take the book out of the hand
[24:00] of him who sits upon the throne
[24:02] and now this worthy one is saying to his
[24:05] saints
[24:06] you are worthy
[24:08] here is this one the only one qualified
[24:10] to judge and indeed all judgment is
[24:12] committed unto him
[24:14] and he says
[24:15] you are worthy
[24:17] these words are as astounding as are the
[24:19] words in romans 8 33 be
[24:22] god says i am righteous
[24:25] way translation
[24:27] there in the white light of god's
[24:28] righteousness hear the sweet voice of
[24:30] jesus as he says
[24:32] these are mine
[24:33] they are righteous they are worthy
[24:36] they shall walk with me in white
[24:40] the promise to the overcome
[24:50] [Music]
[25:19] you
