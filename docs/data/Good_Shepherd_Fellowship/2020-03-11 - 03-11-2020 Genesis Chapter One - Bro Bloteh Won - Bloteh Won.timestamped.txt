[29:30] go to see butter Sam and his family back
[29:34] there praise the Lord we are so grateful
[29:37] to be girls children Genesis chapter 1
[29:41] tonight let's read in the beginning God
[29:45] created the heaven and the earth Saint
[29:49] John chapter 1 Saint John chapter 1
[30:04] see John chapter one
[30:13] praise the Lord st. John chapter 1 let's
[30:18] take verse 1 as well in the beginning
[30:21] was the word and the Word was with God
[30:25] and the Word was God
[30:30] let's pray together father we approached
[30:34] your internal Word because I've just
[30:37] declared unto us Lord that a word is God
[30:41] and Father you are antenna come and
[30:44] speak to us tonight Lord God I pray you
[30:47] will the Holy Spirit will move upon the
[30:51] inspiration on our house tonight law to

[30:55] strengthen each and every one of us in
[30:57] Jesus name we pray amen
[31:00] praise the Lord Allah bless you we have
[31:03] a lot of scriptures who have we'll be
[31:04] running through tonight so have your
[31:07] Bible Hindi maybe the people our system
[31:11] back then will be able to help us to
[31:13] project some of those scriptures I
[31:15] [Music]
[31:18] realized I was speaking I don't know
[31:20] were there you know word the the
[31:28] inspiration came from on Sunday morning
[31:30] I really never thought that we would
[31:33] have had a service for prayer lining but
[31:37] I think it was necessary for us to
[31:40] rededicate ourselves over and over to
[31:44] the Lord amen and it was such a blessing
[31:48] on Sunday what I was speaking I realized
[31:53] make mention on on on Genesis chapter
[31:57] one never had a time to go into eight I
[32:00] don't know if if you know it went over
[32:03] your head or if you if you cut it and
[32:06] then it almost looks like it was it was
[32:11] a kind of a scary thing to say so I
[32:13] decided I'll go go over what I said when
[32:16] I was trying to differentiate between
[32:18] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and Genesis
[32:21] chapter 1 verse 2 praise the Lord
[32:24] so I want to take that tonight
[32:26] acts that the law would just be able to
[32:29] bring his blessing the Pony praise the
[32:32] Lord
[32:32] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we just read
[32:37] that the scripture says in the beginning
[32:39] God created the heaven and the earth
[32:43] praise the Lord we want to thank the
[32:46] Lord for His manifold blessings and all
[32:50] the things that His grace is doing upon
[32:52] our life we we are so grateful praise
[32:55] the Lord amen
[32:57] but as we look at this subject tonight
[33:01] what actually I was trying to to speak
[33:04] on and for us to be able to see here is
[33:09] there
[33:10] Genesis chapter 1 if you remember this
[33:13] story Becky I don't know if you have my
[33:16] notes there but if you remember the
[33:19] story from spoken word is the original
[33:22] Sieber Branham share 1962 he said my
[33:25] daughter back there Rebecca was saying
[33:29] daddy in school we proved that that
[33:33] there are millions and millions of years
[33:37] this word is all then isn't that
[33:43] contradictory to the Bible he said no
[33:48] sir I said it isn't the different
[33:54] studies of rocks information and you
[33:58] know in other things and so forth there
[34:01] is dropping of millions of years and God
[34:05] said he made heaven and the earth in one
[34:11] 24-hour doesn't that miss prove or
[34:16] disprove the Bible
[34:17] I said no if you will notice telling
[34:22] Moses about the Bible which mean God
[34:26] revealing to Moses what happened in the
[34:29] beginning because we know that Moses is
[34:32] the one that wrote it telling Moses
[34:34] about the Bible he said in the beginning
[34:38] God created the heaven
[34:40] in the earth period are we together amen
[34:46] God created the heaven and the earth
[34:50] period how long it took that's none of
[34:57] our business then he goes ahead and
[35:01] began to bring in his time of potencies
[35:07] in the earth but in the beginning might
[35:11] have been hundreds of billions of
[35:14] trillions of years all of time but God
[35:19] created the heaven and the earth period
[35:23] praise the Lord
[35:25] and then if you if you were also studied
[35:30] you will realize there are all the great
[35:34] scholars of the Bible when they did
[35:37] reference to that beginning and what the
[35:43] reference to is a lot of the scriptures
[35:45] that we will be looking at tonight
[35:47] because you said a lot of things that
[35:52] brother Branham said and sometimes we
[35:57] ask as people you know believing the
[36:00] message it looks like you know he said
[36:04] it is just an astral revelation and
[36:06] there is just no place to put it in the
[36:08] scripture praise the Lord
[36:11] now you remember when when Vittel LaDuke
[36:21] prophesied over brother Branham after
[36:24] preaching what brother Branham preached
[36:26] he said brother Branham what you preach
[36:29] could be placed at the back of the last
[36:32] chapter of the book of Revelation to be
[36:34] the 2012 enemies no it's not supposed to
[36:37] be so because it's written in the word
[36:40] and no man you are or no man shoes Oh
[36:43] track amen he says even those things
[36:46] that are revealed in the
[36:49] in the seals he says they cannot be
[36:52] anything out of the Bible there has to
[36:55] be right in the scripture praise the
[36:58] Lord Amen so we want to look a few of
[37:02] those things tonight if the Lord gives
[37:04] us Grace and one of the place that we
[37:08] will we will try to hold on till tonight
[37:11] is you will see over and over as we look
[37:15] in the scripture you will see this word
[37:17] coming up that is called the foundation
[37:20] of the word praise the Lord and what is
[37:28] the foundation what is the foundation
[37:34] the foundation is the beginning so every
[37:40] word where the scripture said before the
[37:43] foundation of the word is right in
[37:45] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 anything that
[37:49] happened at the foundation of the world
[37:52] is phone right in Genesis when the land
[37:56] wrote your name on the last book of life
[37:58] from the foundation of the word is in
[38:01] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 are we
[38:07] together praise the Lord
[38:11] that is the reason why the scripture
[38:13] does not contradict itself that is the
[38:15] reason why the scripture does not
[38:17] confuse us because God knew exactly what
[38:23] he was saying the foundation of anything
[38:29] is the beginning so when the scripture
[38:34] says in the beginning God created having
[38:39] a lot of death year and some few codes
[38:43] that we will also have to look at
[38:45] tonight and I was looking at one year
[38:49] Berta Branham says he would in 1964 he
[38:52] says God take a picture of you when they
[38:55] God did there
[38:56] Genesis chapter 1 first one if what he
[38:59] said is structured
[39:01] they have to be in the Bible
[39:13] are we together he says God take a
[39:17] picture of you or now no matter how old
[39:20] or wrinkled how this figure whatever it
[39:24] will be that will win right on down true
[39:28] and that body may be destroyed this
[39:32] figure burned it of Alliance whatever it
[39:36] is but it was made up it was made above
[39:41] of gases cysteine element of the earth
[39:46] that was calcium he called all of those
[39:50] elements like cosmic light and sofa now
[39:54] no matter the whole earth is filled with
[39:56] death but now this picture is the me
[40:02] think amen
[40:04] then in the resurrection those gases in
[40:07] Isaacson and teens comes right back
[40:10] again and then he plays he developed the
[40:12] picture again now so we will see few of
[40:16] those things here like I said I'm just
[40:19] trying to to speed up a little bit let
[40:23] me let me start there in in the
[40:27] structure as we want to go quickly
[40:31] tonight if the lord help us am chapter
[40:34] [Music]
[40:37] 18 verse 15 praise the Lord
[40:48] then actually it's a sign of David you
[40:54] realize that David said they're back in
[40:58] in second samuel chapter 22 verse 8 sam
[41:05] chapter 18 verse 15 there's a reason why
[41:09] i'm i want us to look at all of these
[41:11] things he says year then the chiness of
[41:16] the water was seen and the foundation of
[41:19] the world was discovered there
[41:21] Adar rebuke all Lord had ad the blast of
[41:27] the birth of the nostris Amen praise the
[41:32] Lord
[41:32] but we know like like the scripture said
[41:36] or we being taught by the Prophet the
[41:38] oldest book in the Bible is the book of
[41:41] Job and job chapter 38 we see right
[41:45] there in the scripture where God was
[41:47] axing job where were you
[41:49] you know when the sons of God shouted
[41:51] for joy amen from the foundation of the
[41:57] world praise the Lord so all of these
[42:03] things all of these things you know
[42:06] where I will go through the scriptures I
[42:08] mean I'm having a lot of them listed
[42:10] down here that we can we can all run
[42:13] through and see here Matthew chapter 13
[42:16] verse 35 Jesus said there were secrets
[42:19] that were hate since the foundation of
[42:21] the world Matthew chapter 25 verse 34 he
[42:25] says fear not little flawed is your
[42:27] father good will to give you the kingdom
[42:29] that was prepared for you from the
[42:31] foundation of the world when they all of
[42:34] these things happen Genesis chapter 1
[42:36] verse 1
[42:42] praise the Lord amen
[42:51] Luke chapter 11 verse 15 you know what
[42:54] Jesus even talks about how the you know
[42:59] the prophets how men would die for this
[43:02] gospel they shared their blood so if you
[43:04] write that in his mind he was looking
[43:07] down through time I were together in
[43:13] Fisher in chapter 1 verse 4 we were
[43:15] choosing in him from the foundation of
[43:17] the world
[43:17] right there Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[43:27] Hebrews 11 no hebrews chapter 4 verse 3
[43:30] the scripture says his works were
[43:33] finished from the foundation of the
[43:35] world God created the heaven and the
[43:41] earth are we together amen now there are
[43:50] other scriptures also that speaks about
[43:54] a time that we cannot place after the
[44:00] Garden of Eden where can we place that
[44:05] let's look a few of the few of those
[44:08] tonight we read a one on Sunday there
[44:12] was war in heaven when did that took
[44:15] place as Isle chapter 14 verse 12 we
[44:22] know that that is all connected with
[44:24] Revelation chapter 12 speaking about the
[44:27] reward in heaven when Satan Lucifer grew
[44:31] proud and he wanted to to ascend himself
[44:34] above the stars of God how Jairus Isaiah
[44:38] the prophet speaking about that you know
[44:40] hundreds of years
[44:45] what can we place there amen
[44:50] that did not happen after adenine affair
[44:54] there have been before adenine affair
[44:59] praise the Lord
[45:01] let me read something to you here if
[45:22] mm-hm
[45:26] praise the Lord okay
[45:56] he loved the law tonight okay what does
[46:07] it takes to make a crease in life
[46:14] let's take before there was a beginning
[46:17] of the world now the lady comfort from
[46:21] the earth so did you if they'd be so
[46:25] then we will hear our bodies were on the
[46:30] earth before there was any life here we
[46:34] are made of 16 different elements of the
[46:38] earth all of these elements chasm and
[46:41] cosmic light and so forth held together
[46:44] by atom system element and then if their
[46:48] wish which scientifically is sold our
[46:52] body were lying spread out on this earth
[46:57] before there was any type of life on the
[47:01] earth praise the Lord he says yet he
[47:06] said and as the volcanic he says that
[47:11] bursted in formed the material of the
[47:15] earth and so far see is just a a burning
[47:21] brimstone as it was set on possession as
[47:26] he walked up and down there are fairy
[47:31] brain stones of the earth and then when
[47:35] God cool it off and set it over a year
[47:39] in his great mind he has something in
[47:44] his mind that he was going to do
[47:48] praise the Lord in the beginning was the
[47:52] word the Word was with God and the Word
[47:55] was God
[47:56] now a word is a thought express God had
[48:01] in his mind what he had in his mind what
[48:07] to do but when he expressed it
[48:10] it had to come into existence to become
[48:14] a reality because it was God's word
[48:18] Express praise Lord that they on cavalry
[48:24] he also says he he says the very rock
[48:27] that he wants walk up and down on the
[48:31] earth burning brimstone Lucifer was the
[48:37] son of the morning and he walked on the
[48:41] earth when it was a burning volcano
[48:47] those same rocks that her cool off when
[48:53] Jesus they had a cavalry bridge fall out
[48:56] of the earth praise the Lord
[48:59] now with with with this thought in what
[49:06] Berber enemy seen here and we go back to
[49:09] what as I said in in the book of Isaiah
[49:14] how are they are falling or Lucifer son
[49:17] of the morning
[49:19] praise the Lord amen we realized that a
[49:26] job chapter 1 when when the Bible says
[49:30] when the sons of God presented himself
[49:32] and and yeah he comes in Sicily where
[49:35] they are from Lucifer he sees up and
[49:37] down through our other earth back and
[49:40] forth and what of you now so what what
[49:43] I'm trying to bring forth to us tonight
[49:46] is to be able to see that just like
[49:50] brother Branham said God give this this
[49:53] whole Genesis chapter one story that we
[49:57] have he gave it to Moses in a form of a
[50:00] vision I mean and like I said on solid
[50:06] visions are so fast just like dreams
[50:12] because it's a ram is it is the realm of
[50:16] the subconscious praise the Lord Amen
[50:21] it's something that you know
[50:24] that that is able to play out out of
[50:27] your life in just two minutes
[50:30] or two seconds like birdbrain m-series
[50:33] and you can just dream or you can just
[50:37] see a vision of what is going to happen
[50:39] and just in that short space of time so
[50:49] that is the same way between two verses
[50:54] in the Bible it can hold hundreds of
[50:57] years praise the Lord
[51:03] between just two phrases in the Bible it
[51:06] can hold thousands of years right in
[51:09] between them that's what Burt Branham
[51:14] says God says in the beginning God
[51:18] created the heaven and the earth period
[51:21] it might have talked hundreds and
[51:24] hundreds and hundreds of years I will
[51:27] together praise the Lord
[51:31] amen the scripture also says the
[51:40] Revelation chapter 3 let's look at this
[51:42] also as we deal with these with this
[51:45] beginning year
[51:55] Revelation chapter 3 when the scripture
[51:59] addresses our age in verse 14 unto the
[52:03] Angel of the Church of Loudy to write
[52:05] these things said they amen
[52:08] they're faithful and the truth witness
[52:10] the beginning of the creation of God it
[52:15] was right back to Genesis chapter 1 it
[52:20] was a it was a very same thing that John
[52:23] referred to because he's the one that
[52:25] there had this experience on the island
[52:28] of Patmos he's the one coming out of
[52:31] there he's referring to the very same
[52:33] thing in us in John chapter 1 verse 1 in
[52:36] the beginning was the word the Word was
[52:40] with God the Word was God sometimes we
[52:48] can run it on our lives in the beginning
[52:50] was the word the Word was with God and
[52:51] the Word was God but in a way that John
[52:54] is expressing what he's saying in a way
[52:58] that he's expressing what is being
[53:00] revealed to him praise the Lord in the
[53:09] beginning was the word praise the Lord
[53:14] and the Word was with God and the Word
[53:20] was God
[53:21] let us let's take something your brother
[53:23] branham said he said question-and-answer
[53:25] on Genesis he said now God gave himself
[53:31] birth or he gave birth to himself if we
[53:35] want to we want to kind of speak it in
[53:38] the way that you we can understand it
[53:40] God gave himself birth to this son which
[53:46] was before there was even an atom in the
[53:51] beginning was the word the Word was with
[53:53] God he says seed
[53:56] jesus said glorify me father with the
[54:01] glory that are hard before the
[54:03] foundation of the world back
[54:08] in Genesis chapter 1 amen see we're back
[54:13] yonder now in st. John 1 he said in the
[54:19] beginning now so brother Branham is here
[54:21] what is he doing he's trying to
[54:23] interpret the scripture in the beginning
[54:25] was the word what happened there that
[54:28] was the beginning of the creation of God
[54:31] and what is the beginning of the
[54:33] creation of God God gave birth to
[54:34] himself and all of that took place in
[54:41] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we have not
[54:45] got to verse 2 yet praise the Lord the
[54:51] lamb wrote your name on the lamb book of
[54:54] life Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 Satan has
[54:59] not come to the scene yet when he comes
[55:01] to the scene that's where there is
[55:02] darkness and in water all over the earth
[55:05] then there's a sign of judgment but
[55:07] there was things that were happening
[55:08] right at that time that he don't know
[55:10] nothing about oh how we can trust this
[55:18] all book man how we can trust this Bible
[55:21] and we can just fall in love with it are
[55:30] we together he says now Genesis chapter
[55:34] 1 you know he's he's taking that breath
[55:37] of God he's bringing everything together
[55:39] now let me drop down a little bit here
[55:41] this is Wednesday night he says now
[55:44] notice me now when this was first formed
[55:50] now watch the little hallow that is that
[55:54] that light that logos he says now I can
[55:58] see it move out to this earth and get
[56:04] over on top of it and begin to move it
[56:08] over close to the Sun now Paul in a book
[56:13] of collusion which says everything was
[56:16] created by him and who was this him this
[56:21] logos
[56:22] the hollow of life that the the form
[56:25] that the bane that came out of God
[56:27] because God is the great intent of
[56:30] spirit praise the Lord
[56:34] are we together I knew as soon as you
[56:41] see it you enjoy it because it's
[56:45] speaking about you it belongs to you he
[56:49] says and when it begins to melt and the
[56:53] great galaxies and then he talks about
[56:55] all of the earth then he drops down here
[56:58] he says then now we get in Genesis 1 we
[57:09] get to the Bible now out of our picture
[57:13] at the Bible Genesis 1 the Word was with
[57:19] our form and Val praise the Lord
[57:25] so actually actually if we were to write
[57:30] about time in the end and in the
[57:34] beginning of time our Bible must
[57:37] actually start from Genesis chapter 1
[57:39] verse 2 praise the Lord because what God
[57:52] expresses here what what what what he
[57:55] pour out like like even better Branham
[57:57] says he says even when the scripture
[57:59] said in the beginning God he says he was
[58:02] not even God at that time he was great
[58:07] Elohim well he became God because he had
[58:13] been to worship Him so when did that
[58:17] happen
[58:17] all right there in Genesis it all pop
[58:20] right there in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[58:27] praise the Lord
[58:37] Jesus s secret here from the foundation
[58:40] of the world even over in in the Old
[58:47] Testament jeremiah spoke about it as i
[58:51] spoke about it you know they all pointed
[58:54] to a time like he said as i said he
[58:58] spread the heavens like a curtain he
[59:06] spread the heavens like a curtain and
[59:08] all of these things
[59:14] Paul says he choose us in him before the
[59:22] foundation of the world
[59:25] amen
[59:32] Peter said in first Peter chapter 1
[59:34] verse 20 that he for ordained us at the
[59:42] foundation of the world
[59:45] praise the Lord John said in the book of
[59:49] Revelation that names were written on
[59:52] the lamb book of life from the
[59:55] foundation of the world
[59:59] praise the Lord amen
[1:00:05] you know what I know face and I was I
[1:00:08] was here there this afternoon
[1:00:11] studying a little bathing and just
[1:00:13] praying and just letting me do something
[1:00:19] and it's kind of a struck me praise the
[1:00:22] Lord you know how interruption when you
[1:00:28] are talking and you are you you have
[1:00:30] been interrupted it's not a good thing
[1:00:34] for him and it confuses us praise the
[1:00:40] Lord but God works in the interruption
[1:00:49] praise the Lord
[1:00:51] sometimes he brings out the most
[1:00:54] beautiful picture you remember the woman
[1:00:58] with the blood issue he was interrupted
[1:01:00] he said would touch me praise the Lord
[1:01:05] he was preaching one time having a great
[1:01:08] revival and pretty soon he saw hearing
[1:01:11] the zing they started breaking the
[1:01:13] singing and everything but watch now
[1:01:18] what Jesus was speaking was never
[1:01:22] recorded but the interruption was
[1:01:26] recorded you never give us the same oh
[1:01:31] he was pretty crazy
[1:01:43] Amen now Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 comes
[1:01:48] out and god yes I mean Moses just
[1:01:52] related I mean it happened so fast
[1:01:54] with what are the things that will
[1:01:56] happen he just wrote in the beginning
[1:01:57] God created heaven and earth all the
[1:02:00] things that happen he's just put it into
[1:02:03] that phrase but see the rest of the
[1:02:10] account was the interruption the efforts
[1:02:16] with our form darkness was upon the deep
[1:02:19] the water covered the earth praise the
[1:02:26] Lord Amen then you see them in science
[1:02:31] and main in your mind they are rustling
[1:02:34] all over their to show a big bang that
[1:02:36] exploded to show audibly
[1:02:38] I mean they had just caught up they
[1:02:40] confused interruption will always
[1:02:42] confuse me God is not confused
[1:02:44] I mean he's not confused you think about
[1:02:52] young Mary she was about 18 years I mean
[1:02:55] just a young girl I mean she she kept
[1:02:57] her mind pure care for life pure and and
[1:03:00] just at a time of her wedding it was
[1:03:03] interrupted God created an interruption
[1:03:10] and in the whole Judea went crazy
[1:03:15] I mean a newspaper were exploring it all
[1:03:17] this this this woman says she saw an
[1:03:19] angel I mean they were just trying to
[1:03:21] make a story out of it he called
[1:03:24] yourself my goodness we just love the
[1:03:30] Lord that's why the scripture says
[1:03:32] everything worked together for good to
[1:03:35] them that love the Lord because God is
[1:03:37] not confused by the interruption the
[1:03:40] things that seems like your life being
[1:03:42] interrupted or things is happening and
[1:03:44] you don't understand God is not confused
[1:03:46] by there
[1:03:53] praise Lord you know you look at these
[1:03:57] things and yeah I mean used you you
[1:04:01] studied in and I mean you look into the
[1:04:03] word it just kind of a blow your mind I
[1:04:07] was looking at this to see all the
[1:04:11] things that God did right back there I
[1:04:16] mean and like where banister question
[1:04:20] and answer in Genesis
[1:04:21] he says every every son of God every
[1:04:26] child of God was represented in that
[1:04:30] birth of the logos that is the reason
[1:04:36] why on a date of Pentecost God displayed
[1:04:39] it by putting light on all of them that
[1:04:43] was in the upper room - sure that they
[1:04:46] all had a representation in that great
[1:04:49] ball of light that was moving in the
[1:04:52] beginning I would to get him and see the
[1:05:02] way he said it here
[1:05:03] he said when that boy was moving he said
[1:05:12] it was just like a try playing I the
[1:05:20] first tool of the Father
[1:05:25] and you and myself was represented a
[1:05:31] Amen yes that's the reason why that's
[1:05:35] where we find our joy and our strength
[1:05:39] when when I mean when that truth
[1:05:42] connection comes between you and the
[1:05:45] Father
[1:05:46] you can play religion you can play
[1:05:49] church you will really not be able to -
[1:05:52] I mean to enjoy it but when that truth
[1:05:56] experiencing that true relationship
[1:05:59] whether is through trials or
[1:06:01] difficulties you can still find joy
[1:06:07] because there was there isn't
[1:06:09] representation
[1:06:10] cha playing at the first step of the
[1:06:14] Father you were represented in there I
[1:06:16] was representing every son and daughter
[1:06:19] of God was representing there amen
[1:06:25] brother Branham says and he took your
[1:06:28] picture when you were at your best
[1:06:33] that's what everything that is happening
[1:06:35] down yet it does not bother him because
[1:06:40] he took your picture when you were at
[1:06:42] your best and Jesus comes back and says
[1:06:49] don't touch one of those little ones
[1:06:51] because they are angel behold the face
[1:06:55] of the Father
[1:07:03] praise the Lord Amen now you see that
[1:07:08] God placed those things in his word not
[1:07:11] just to excite us amen
[1:07:16] he placed those things in his in in in
[1:07:19] the word and here evade them to us as we
[1:07:24] as we go along in our relationship with
[1:07:26] him so we can be able to give more trust
[1:07:30] that he have it in control praise the
[1:07:37] Lord
[1:07:37] he's not just leaving us or letting us
[1:07:41] to do anything we want to do and we just
[1:07:44] go in now you know but but he's in
[1:07:46] control
[1:07:51] praise the Lord
[1:07:52] he's in control that's a reason why bird
[1:07:56] branch is under the seal one of the one
[1:07:58] of the mystery that was revealed was
[1:08:00] internal security what is that internal
[1:08:05] security Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 those
[1:08:07] thing he did before the curse came he
[1:08:14] put your name on the lamb book of life
[1:08:16] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:08:18] of the world the Father good will to
[1:08:23] give you the kingdom before the
[1:08:25] foundation all of those things were done
[1:08:30] for your security that's the reason why
[1:08:34] he says all the father has given me will
[1:08:36] come now 1 are we lost not one I would
[1:08:45] lost so just like Moses giving us this
[1:08:52] account just imagine all of those things
[1:08:55] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:08:57] the world John talked about it and and
[1:08:59] and and and
[1:09:02] Paul talked about he chose us from the
[1:09:05] foundation I mean all of those things
[1:09:07] that I spread out there in the scripture
[1:09:10] I mean a Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 37 as
[1:09:14] ayah 51 verse 13 all of these scriptures
[1:09:17] speaks about the foundation of the world
[1:09:20] but yet Moses put it in those few words
[1:09:23] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:09:27] and he deaf praise the Lord he put he he
[1:09:40] locked all of those things just aimed
[1:09:43] their sentence in the beginning God
[1:09:47] created the heaven in the earth and God
[1:09:54] revealed a little year to Paul and he
[1:09:57] revealed a little year to Zacharias he
[1:09:59] revealed a little year and a prophet
[1:10:02] comes on the scene he revealed a little
[1:10:04] to him and says God took a picture of
[1:10:06] you it's not just a scene it's in the
[1:10:13] scripture
[1:10:20] I would together
[1:10:26] because you see the thing about it there
[1:10:31] is there that's reverberation chapter 12
[1:10:38] I write I wrote all of these scriptures
[1:10:41] here having a whole page of scriptures
[1:10:43] down here we should go through it I mean
[1:10:47] it would be good to go through them but
[1:10:50] let's let just let just rear evolution
[1:10:54] chapter tour
[1:11:08] we are just in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[1:11:11] we have not even gone verse 2 year
[1:11:17] praise the Lord Amen do you know we can
[1:11:22] just take that one verse and go right
[1:11:26] into the rapture with it just Genesis
[1:11:31] chapter 1 verse 1 if you just are loving
[1:11:34] that verse and just as seeing God in
[1:11:36] that verse seeing your redemption in
[1:11:38] that verse
[1:11:39] seeing your predestination in that word
[1:11:41] that's all you need to make the rapture
[1:11:44] you don't need to know the whole Bible
[1:11:55] praise the Lord
[1:11:57] the scripture says here Revelation
[1:12:00] chapter 12 the Bible talks about this
[1:12:06] reading from verse 70 from if I'm right
[1:12:10] reading from verse you read there from
[1:12:14] verse 1 it goes along verse 4 comes and
[1:12:17] he says his tail the tail of this dragon
[1:12:20] drew the tail parts of the stars of
[1:12:23] heaven and and and they cast them to the
[1:12:27] earth amen and the dragon stood before
[1:12:30] the woman now you just think about that
[1:12:33] the time he drew the tear apart of the
[1:12:35] skies where was that
[1:12:36] you take us right back over again to as
[1:12:39] I up to 12 were he deceived the angels I
[1:12:45] mean he deceived the angels just like we
[1:12:48] were talking about Jam welfare that was
[1:12:51] where James begin because what is James
[1:12:54] demons what are demons fallen angels
[1:12:59] they never kept their first estate and
[1:13:03] when did that happen right between
[1:13:06] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in Genesis
[1:13:09] chapter 1 verse 2 right in between they
[1:13:19] praise the Lord
[1:13:20] are we together he drew the third part
[1:13:29] of the stars of heaven verse 7 and there
[1:13:33] was war in heaven Michael and his angels
[1:13:36] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[1:13:38] fought with his angel and prevalent Ned
[1:13:41] neither was there neither was their
[1:13:45] place found any more in heaven as I
[1:13:48] bring it out they were cast to the earth
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:53] and what did the scripture says this
[1:13:55] these are the people that troubled the
[1:13:57] earth how did the trouble the earth in
[1:14:00] the form of sickness diseases
[1:14:03] coronavirus praise the Lord amen
[1:14:11] they are just spirits that are rolling
[1:14:13] over they are just rolling over amen
[1:14:21] from Ages you even look through the
[1:14:25] scripture even during the time of our
[1:14:27] Lord Jesus you find out that every time
[1:14:31] he prayer when he council to a demon he
[1:14:35] casts it off amen
[1:14:39] he casts it off if the same old demon
[1:14:43] that tempted I mean Adam in the Garden
[1:14:46] of the of Eden is the same old devil the
[1:14:49] attempt at something is the same one
[1:14:51] that entered David I mean the just
[1:14:53] rolling over from one edge to another
[1:14:55] and as they go down through the edges
[1:14:58] they become more dangerous and more
[1:15:00] deadly and more evil until on earth the
[1:15:08] pale house they took the name of death
[1:15:13] that's the reason why our age is the
[1:15:17] most evil age but Branham says how can I
[1:15:21] overcome he says every age every
[1:15:25] succeeding age receive the benefit
[1:15:29] and also receive the curse of the age
[1:15:33] before are we together praise the Lord
[1:15:43] that is the reason why young people
[1:15:45] let's give our heart to the Lord amen we
[1:15:51] mind that like the prophets said the
[1:15:54] days of the revival is over you will not
[1:15:57] have like it used to be praise the Lord
[1:16:02] but let God get a hold of your heart
[1:16:04] your body might go through terrible
[1:16:07] things your mind might go through
[1:16:10] terrible things as if you are even
[1:16:12] losing your mind almost like you want to
[1:16:14] explore but if God get a hold of your
[1:16:16] heart that's what matter let God get a
[1:16:27] hold of your heart amen praise the Lord
[1:16:34] thank God get a hold of your heart this
[1:16:36] there is there was something year I
[1:16:38] wanted to look at the scripture says and
[1:16:41] a Great Dragon was cast out there all
[1:16:43] seven that's how he represented himself
[1:16:45] in Genesis chapter 3 called the devil
[1:16:49] and sit on that deceiver the whole world
[1:16:51] he was cast out into the earth in his
[1:16:54] angels demons were cast out with him and
[1:16:59] I heard a loud voice saying in heaven
[1:17:03] now is salvation why why the subject of
[1:17:08] salvation comes after this what does it
[1:17:16] comes because a deceiver is released to
[1:17:19] the earth and God attributes that were
[1:17:25] represented in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[1:17:28] will be affected by this deceiver that's
[1:17:33] the reason why we need salvation that's
[1:17:35] why we need healing before he was cast
[1:17:39] to the earth we never need a salvation
[1:17:41] there was not a need of healing
[1:17:43] there was not a need of deliverance well
[1:17:45] now he's cast to the earth now in
[1:17:50] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[1:17:53] of our God and the power of his Christ
[1:17:56] for the queue for the accuser of the
[1:17:59] bridges is cast and that's why we need
[1:18:04] preachers that's why we need prayer
[1:18:07] warriors because the accuser that the
[1:18:09] bridges is cast him that's why we need
[1:18:13] worshippers amen praise the Lord but
[1:18:20] something I was getting to year with
[1:18:22] with all of this noise that I'm making
[1:18:25] therefore rejoice verse 12
[1:18:28] yay havin a needed word hearing world on
[1:18:31] to the inhabitants of the earth and of
[1:18:34] the sea for the devil come down unto you
[1:18:38] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:18:40] that he had but a short time you think
[1:18:45] it's now that he knew he had a short
[1:18:48] time praise the Lord
[1:18:54] every age he thought it was the end
[1:19:00] praise the Lord
[1:19:02] every age he talked it was the end when
[1:19:07] you when you just think about this play
[1:19:09] play a question and answer on Genesis
[1:19:12] just just meditate and see how but
[1:19:16] Brenham just bring out those things you
[1:19:19] know just just meditate on how he play
[1:19:23] out the beginning of time and into time
[1:19:28] praise the Lord
[1:19:30] just meditate on it it's very beautiful
[1:19:33] it's very very beautiful because you
[1:19:38] have to know for this grid Elohim great
[1:19:42] internal spirit to be worship he created
[1:19:46] angels praise the Lord
[1:19:51] when you look over there in Isaiah
[1:19:54] chapter 12 I believe in my heart the
[1:19:58] thing that really really made the devil
[1:20:03] man when he said let us make man in our
[1:20:10] image because he knows that God was
[1:20:15] making something in his image that will
[1:20:17] be higher than him praise the Lord if
[1:20:25] God was making something of himself
[1:20:29] there was nothing or our true creation
[1:20:31] God never made that statement he never
[1:20:35] made a son in his image the son had a
[1:20:38] representation of God but it was never
[1:20:40] made in the image of God not the moon or
[1:20:43] the Stars nothing he created but when it
[1:20:46] came to you when God was about to
[1:20:49] express you praise the Lord that is the
[1:20:56] reason why did the devil can get ahold
[1:20:58] of you he can make the worst use out of
[1:21:02] you praise the Lord he hid to even think
[1:21:08] about you and that's the reason why when
[1:21:17] you have the opportunity don't spare him
[1:21:20] please amen don't spare him if God gave
[1:21:24] you grace to praise step on his feet
[1:21:27] bring all the curses down on him
[1:21:30] praise the Lord when you just gain that
[1:21:36] strength to say what is right
[1:21:39] make sure you said amen praise the Lord
[1:21:48] just tell him how foolish he is housed a
[1:21:51] liar yes you are a deceiver you are a
[1:21:55] bluff
[1:22:07] automatic off yourself
[1:22:09] I can't even go into what I want to say
[1:22:12] tonight praise the Lord because you know
[1:22:17] he has a short time let me let me give
[1:22:21] you another comparison of this and what
[1:22:26] Brian said in the message where he had
[1:22:32] he had a business meeting in church and
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:40] message is floating floating my minds
[1:22:42] now he says okay he said every scene
[1:22:51] that went down I will tell you is it
[1:22:56] just coming to my mind the name of the
[1:22:58] message he said all of the things he
[1:23:00] support you read the Bible when Paul
[1:23:04] talks about the rapture he never talks
[1:23:08] about the rapture for your day he talks
[1:23:12] about the rapture for his day he said we
[1:23:15] die a living he didn't said those that
[1:23:17] would be living in those days no he said
[1:23:20] we'd a living amen because they are
[1:23:26] taught and would have happened in their
[1:23:28] time I mean Jesus even said it he says
[1:23:34] these things that you are seeing he said
[1:23:36] there were prophets of all that long to
[1:23:41] see them in their day praise the Lord
[1:23:46] I mean they thought it was going to
[1:23:50] happy in their day all of those same
[1:23:54] thing and sisters that gave himself to
[1:23:57] be burned to the stake in all of that
[1:23:59] they were looking to see the rapture in
[1:24:03] their day now this will help you to
[1:24:08] understand
[1:24:10] the scripture says that he was just
[1:24:12] giving a short time he was not thinking
[1:24:15] that it would have stayed this long when
[1:24:18] he Adam library Balaam who says when
[1:24:21] when it was said that the seed of the
[1:24:24] woman will bruise the head of the
[1:24:25] serpent he said he thought Abraham was a
[1:24:28] sea he went after Abraham when Isaac
[1:24:30] came he taught eyes it was the seed he
[1:24:33] went to destroy Isaac he said he thought
[1:24:36] Joseph was the seed he why he was trying
[1:24:39] to do that because he had a short time
[1:24:43] he thought if I can do it now I'm going
[1:24:46] to destroy it now if I can get ahold of
[1:24:49] the children of God in this age and time
[1:24:52] and just rip them out of the earth I'm
[1:24:54] going to do it and they're on the other
[1:24:58] side with God's children they're not
[1:25:01] putting it in the future they are
[1:25:03] looking for a manifestation in their
[1:25:06] time that they are living the bible says
[1:25:10] abraham he walk around looking for a
[1:25:14] city whose maker and builder he was not
[1:25:17] even allah he's all yet it would come
[1:25:20] where in the future no no no no everyday
[1:25:22] he was living he was living on the
[1:25:24] anticipation but brennan said they die
[1:25:29] with the hope in their heart and it's
[1:25:32] the same thing that would bring them up
[1:25:33] because they die on earth at expectation
[1:25:37] and you will resurrect honor the same
[1:25:48] praise the Lord
[1:25:49] oh that's the reason why you can't say
[1:25:52] well if I you know if I grow because
[1:25:54] saved a lot that I if I get merit or if
[1:25:56] I get it but you know if I get my joy
[1:25:58] and organize myself the Old Testament
[1:26:00] seems we're not doing that praise the
[1:26:05] Lord
[1:26:13] Paul says we they are living amen
[1:26:19] he talks about the rapture as if it was
[1:26:22] for him he said they that are gone
[1:26:27] before or they are waiting for us he
[1:26:30] were not talking about you
[1:26:31] he were talking about his he and the
[1:26:33] officiant church he was talking about
[1:26:35] that time praise the Lord oh my god
[1:26:52] quick in that desperation in our heart
[1:26:55] praise the Lord Amen that when we wake
[1:27:00] up in the morning we can say Lord is
[1:27:01] this going to be the day is this going
[1:27:04] to be the rapture in day praise the Lord
[1:27:07] I'm going to work Lord it is going to be
[1:27:09] a rapture in day amen
[1:27:12] praise the Lord so if you face a trial
[1:27:16] every day you're not going to postpone
[1:27:18] it
[1:27:18] I mean you're going to deal with that
[1:27:20] devil amen
[1:27:24] because the devil in his mind this could
[1:27:27] be his last day he want to perform the
[1:27:29] best wickedness the best way he can
[1:27:33] frustrate you he want to do it
[1:27:43] musicians he can come for tonight praise
[1:27:56] the Lord you just think about it tonight
[1:28:04] since why we bowed our heads you think
[1:28:11] about it before this body was ever drawn
[1:28:15] out of the dust of the earth before
[1:28:20] there was ever time
[1:28:26] where Branham says everything concerning
[1:28:29] our journey and everything that is
