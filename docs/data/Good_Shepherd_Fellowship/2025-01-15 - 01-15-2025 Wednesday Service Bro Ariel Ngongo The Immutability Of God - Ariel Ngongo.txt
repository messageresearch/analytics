uh uh you know U sister Elizabeth wanted to know what what a s of degreed is you know and then we were just talking so I was trying to explain to her is a Psalm of Ascension the the the psalm is is trying to get out of something he's trying to look to the Lord or he's trying to reach out of himself he's you know it's a s of Ascension so we were just talking about that and and uh really having a good time of uh devotion and fellowship with the family and earlier before before we started praying she went down to to get one one of redeemed uh uh pulled over ready so as she uh as we got to pray and uh I was I just I just got up you know we we meet in a little a little space between our room and we sit on on the floor together uh and then read uh so I just woke up and I turned in the room to go and get myself ready quickly and uh uh and then she was she was about getting from the stairs now she was sitting on the it's a I think it's a four staircase to to our room so she was sitting on the tear one as soon as she woke up she was trying to get up and her knees just went like this so she went just sliding down the stairs those three staircase there and she hit her head on the floor redeem was sitting uh little redeem was sitting right on the stairs there with her so then I hear the children stream you know so I've just entered the room so I turned back and then I saw her on the floor so I told the girls go in your room and then I went uh I went down to her and uh I help her to sit and then remove her legs just have her legs to straighten out and I I spoke to her a little bit but just when she fell when I when I got over her I just I just he her saying Lord is this my time that's what I heard her saying you know and then from right there she when she said Lord is this my time and then she started she just start she just enter into some kind of a praise I mean for the first time never seen my mother-in-law Lord like that you know she started thanking God and just started praising God you know thank you you've been so good to me you know uh uh and she she just started praising the Lord she just started worshiping so I I straightened her legs and how her to sit back to the wall but her entire upper body was not moving she didn't have no movement in the upper body and also her legs were not moving she so she told me I'm not feeling my legs so I said okay just sit there like that and then I said let's pray so she and myself said we pray and then uh I put her I put her her hands around my shoulder and then I took her from the back uh grab her with her legs and I I pick her up I managed to do that so I pick her up straight into our room and uh uh we we we had now put our bed up here like I told you we stay moving so our mattress was on the floor so I lay her on the bed just so her legs would be straight you know so while she were laying on the bed I put a pillow you know on her head and right I heard I heard a prayer calling her mother you know and and her mom says tell tell Papa to call call the uh the ambulance so then I did you know I I called and and they came but she was she was very alight you know she was not crying she was not she was not in pains it's just that she was not feeling no movement in her in her feet and even her hands and uh so we they took her to the hospital and uh uh the kids went to school and then uh you know I got my wife and we went over to to the hospital to see her then uh we rush her to the emergency and after the while the doctors came the nurse that was treating her you know well I mean she will answer any question they will ask her I mean she was very Alik answer every question and uh they couldn't feed there was no fever you know there was no pain to say this place is aching me so only beside the bum she had on her face so the nurse wanted for her to stand up and see if they would do a little walk back and forth with her and then they were going to send her home so when uh uh my wife and the nurse tried to have her to stand she's I mean they had her on her feet but there was just no balance she did not have no balance so she couldn't stand and uh so the nurse said said no no no no let's put her back on the bed I would tell the you know the doctor that she's now moving and then they sent her for the CD scan she went for the CD scan it came out good and so they were they were actually concerned what is causing the problem so they wanted to check for the if she had any kind of a bleeding in her head and so they did an MRI now they were trying to look at her head you know the brain area and all of that but the mrii pick up a picture at the back of her neck and then uh the M show she didn't have no bleeding but then the the doctor was able to see that there was a a dislocated dicks in the back of her neck that was lying on her spine but the picture was not very clear so he ordered a second MRI and then uh that MRI fully re revealed that she had three dicks lying on her spine and then one of them one of them broke and he was actually surprised he said it's a miracle that she's not paralyzed you know so they order an immediate surgery uh because if she would not do the surgery she would not she would not be able to use use her legs or her arms anymore so they ordered an immediate surgery so we we decided that yeah she should do the surgery and uh they thought they would have done it yesterday but uh finally the surgery was done today and uh and the doctor say she's the surgery went fine and she's even moving her hand so we want to thank the Lord for that amen we want to thank the Lord for that I I think there a miracle that's a miracle in itself amen there a miracle in itself that is a miracle in itself so we thank the Lord we thank the Lord uh uh uh We've [Music] uh so that's that's the report on the the prayer need that we send you and uh uh I was in the midst of that because just uh uh on the weekend I got a got a uh a text report of one of my brother in Long Island uh if you remember a couple of years back when my older brother uh R re was here we gave you a prayer request of one of our brothers that was that was in uh in the hospital needing the liver transplant as the Lord would bless him he had the liver transplant everything went well but suddenly this weekend he took an infection he took an infection and uh so we were

forth with Grandma Bear situation uh sister Elizabeth situation and then and also my brother but the Lord is faithful the Lord is faithful you know at the time we want to see him two years ago we really thought that was when he was ging because when we went to the hospital he was not responding he was he was on un conscious we really thought that he was going but the Lord allowed him to have this surgery which of course came as a miracle for him you know he he did not know the donor the donor only heard about his situation no uh uh the donor relative heard about his situation and decided that they should give their relative labor to him and it came as a perfect match you know so it was really a miracle for us but it pleased the Lord that he will spend a little time with his wife and

come over my friend amen amen praise the Lord In The House of the even amen for hisy that we can be counted among the living amen there are many that are not alive but his grace has kept us amen which means that we have to be in our point of Duty amen no matter what we have to serve the Lord amen because we're now serving the god of of History He Is Alive Tonight how many of us believe it amen uh I would just invite you to open the word with me uh I'll read uh in the book of Hebrew chapter 138 Hebrew 138 Hebrews 138 uh it's a short reading very familiar scripture it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever you may be seated and uh we're just going to have a word of prayer Heavenly Father we stand before you tonight with reverence in our heart because we know that you are already here father Lord we believe in our heart that you are the one who made the promise and none of your promises will fail that's why we are here tonight oh God Believing on what you have promised that whatever we will ask in your name it shall be given unto us father we just give ourself into your hands father now Lord there is no merit in US Lord you know our mistakes you know our ups and down you know our lackings you know our Uprising our down falling Lord we just ask oh God may you just come and take control over the service from the beginning to the end father take the men out of the way Lord you know there's nothing in me father but I Rely myself fully on you Lord use this vessel use this body Lord God that it can be of a blessing to your people in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you God bless you you know there's no greater gift than somebody to tell you God bless you you know sometime if somebody gives you the money you would rather get the money than the blessing but this blessing is great than the money amen so we just read there in Hebrew 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever today if you notice I'll be very calm and I'm not going to do a lot of movement by God's grace I just want to take a few verses here and maybe a few quote that I will read so that it can be of a blessing to you tonight I want to speak on the imitability of God the imitability in other word the unchangeableness of God God does not change amen if there's one thing I want you to know tonight that God does not change yes in the Book of Malachi chapter 3 if the sister came projected for us I didn't set up my power points because everything will be done here no preparation whatsoever but I trust in God you know there's no ability in men there's ability God is able to use the vessel so so that whatever you have in your heart just ask the Lord you know he's here tonight he's able to touch you he's able to answer your prayer amen he's do is able to do great things in our midst how many of us believe that now the Bible says in Malachi CH 3 Verse 6 the Bible says for I am the Lord and I change not amen how many of us believe it it says therefore ye son of Jacob are not consumed so God there's no ability in God to change is not planning something or thinking to change his mind so when God says something it will stand the trials of time so now brother in a scripture here I want to read and that will be really what I want really to sit on upon is in the book of Hebrews chapter 6 Hebrews chapter 6 verse1 17 Hebrews chapter 6:1 17 and I want you to pay attention on this ver verse very closely here this chapter we will read here the Bible says wherein God willing more abundantly in other word God is Desiring more abundantly to share unto the HS of the promise are we together amen so God want to show his desire is to show unto the heads of Salvation is not to everybody but to A specific group of people are you with me so God is willing more abundantly to show unto the heads of the promise the imitability of his counsel are you are are we together so God himself is Desiring to show to a specific group of people how he is unchanging in his purpose or is in Cel is that right that's right so it continues per say confirm it by an oath thereby two imitable things in which it was impossible for God to lie are we together it says that we might have a strong consolation so these heads of Salvation must have a strong consolation that God does not change so s when we opening our Bible when we reading a scripture we have to have the confidence that the god that we serving does not change so Saint we cannot serve a God that changes idea no no no are we together right and then let me tell you tonight we're not serving that God can say one thing after tomorrow he changes his mind he cannot do it amen you see where we we Face we we basing our faith on WE basing our faith on the infallibility of God's word is that are we together yeah that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to laid hold upon the Hope set before us are we together there's one thing that the prophet says here in the message uh the unchange unchangeable God he says there are many things and practical practically all thing changes time changes people changes weather changes Nation changes are we together God is the unch he does not change he is the same all the time are we together in another in in the church exposition of the church age in the Ephesian Church age brother bham says the KE given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is the a most scriptural one it says in fact it might be the Keystone of the Bible are we together but say says it must be the kick Stone of the Bible it says it is the Revelation that God never changes amen he calls it the keystones of the Bible that God cannot change it says it is the Revelation that God never changed and his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen amen amen these are powerful things Saints so we must be able to know what we believe it's not just the fact and say okay I'm coming to a next service I have this issue I have this problem but I must be able to believe that the god that I'm serving amen that the god that I'm praying to is unchanging in his ways right amen that's right oh my amen I I want to take it slow because these are very important last time we spoke about Memorial prayer MH so when we are praying we must know who we are praying to amen it's not just any type of God what would be the difference between a man that is worshiping the son and you that may not know who you serving there's no difference if you don't know who you serving is closely to a person who probably worshiped the son he does not even know what what he's worshiping because whatever is worshiping there's nothing in it but you knowing who you worshiping gives you the power give you the element to get something out of that you see God is not just an imagination no it's not just a thought it's a person amen that's right amen you know something that is invisible does not mean that it does not exist because all things were made by the invisible everything that you see here it was made by the invis so the invisible world is stronger than this what we see here amen amen you understand what I'm saying as we are sitting here there are spirits that are traveling around this building you may not see it it doesn't mean that they're not there that's right it doesn't mean that they don't exist they are here amen so the same as the evil spirit are traveling around the wom the same God also is traveling Among Us that's right that's right are we together because Saints let me tell you something the same way you should know your de the Devil exist you must also know your God exist because you cannot say oh I believe that God exists and you don't believe that there's an enemy called Satan you must be able to believe that oh there's a devil somewhere and that devil is against me he against my family it's against my children is against my church is against whoever I love so if Satan is against them I must go to a power that is greater than Satan am amen and that's the reveal word am amen that's right are we together because remember now we just read that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if he had done anything in the past he will do it today the same exact way if you come the provided way that the first person went through you have the same Faith as a person you will receive the same results that's right there's not a different the result if you came you you come the same provided way you receive the same result because God does not change if he gave to my brother here he more than able to give to my sister over there if they come the same provided way they expecting to receive the same thing are we together amen and brother calls it the Keystone of the B is a revelation that God never changes are we together brother bam says something in go awake Jesus he says his first decision is his only decision Oh Glory to God are we together it says his first decision his his only decision because he infinite amen are we together amen and to be infinite that's perfect times perfect plus perfect can I repeat it again he says his first decision is the only decision because is infinite and to be infinite that's perfect time perfect plus perfect and perfect is in infinite he knew all things from the beginning right he never had to take a word back so Saints let me just stop a little bit here if I have the ability to see the end I pronounce the word here I cannot change it because I know what would happen at the end so when God speaks is infinite means he sees already the End Amen so when God speaks he says I am the Lord that Health thee amen he already saw the sickness that will come probably 400 years amen amen 4,000 years in the future amen so when he giv the promise he knows that there's going to be people that will come after amen that's right praise the Lord they will claim that blessing am and they will receive the healing that scripture has been lay in the Bible for years and years and every man and woman that came the provided way received something out of it am amen you understand what I'm saying so if it happened then is able to do it now amen amen Oh Glory to God he continues it says he never had to take a word back he never had to improve because his first decision is the only decision can can ever be be made he does not learn more do you understand what I'm saying he does not learn more get smarter as we claim we do but he was perfect to begin with Amen Let Let me just break this a little bit you know during the pandemic there's a lot of things that have changed how many have been affected by it you see many people got sick maybe their health got really in a bad shape right after that and many of us change this is a fact you may not see it but in your life something change maybe people have more fear now than then because of the pandemic because we change because of the environment politics change people change but there's one person that does not change and that's the person I need to trust fully amen amen glory oh my goodness amen now we see the word here imitability of his counil in other word the counil of God is his purpose you know it can be considered as his purpose or his word because everything is before even the beginning it was a thought are we together before we hear what it says the word it was a thought first so God it was Elohim living by himself in he he has he had attributes he had thoughts so he had everything already in his mind but now in order for you to know him he might Express his thought or let me just stop a little bit here if I'm thinking about something you met me for the first time you would not know who I am is that correct right the only time you will know me is when I open my mouth and say something you would say oh this brother has an accent this person maybe is from this country or whatever right based on what came out of my mouth so God was not known when he was yet to talk when everything was in his thought or when he was alone but he had desire to express himself he wanted to get everything that was in his mind out are we together so when God speak the word the word is the thought Express right are we together that's what brother says the word word is the thought that has been expressed so when the word comes out he gives the description of who the person is are we together because you will never know God unless he spoke that's why even when he gave the Commandment he was not just do and don't he was expressing his desire right that's right that's why brother brother one has been preaching about the you know has been talking about it God want to be known the only way he you would know that he doesn't like this he likes this is when I express myself are we together and that God never change now it says God want to show and reveal it says he calls it the Keystone of the Bible it's the Revelation that God never changed and that his way are unchanging as he is now what is a revelation a revelation is the unveiling you know to reveal yourself is to unveil yourself to uncover yourself is that correct no something that is once uh before I go further sister can you give me uh this Deuteronomy chapter 20 29 verse 29 and as I'm speaking I think there's there's something that is there that is very important now the unveiling the uncovering the revealing of what was previously hidden yeah so once that element it is is the thought of God is hidden it's a secret you don't know about it so when God does not express himself it's just a thought and you don't know it God only has is sitting by himself as self-existent one with all his thought together are we together so s you give me Deuteronomy chapter okay good it's God is watch this what the Bible say here it says the secret things right let let's read it together right right the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and unto our children forever that we may do all the word of this law are we together right so if a secret it is in the mind of God it do doesn't belong to us because we don't know about it but once it revealed is thought it belongs to you and your family that's right are we together so as long as God has everything in his mind that's him he belongs to him I don't know about it because if God does not want me to do something he kept it in his mind I would not know the only time I have to follow to take heed of it is when he speaks when he reveals it amen amen now the following chapter in uh Deuteronomy chapter 30 it's not part of my notes right so we can't go Deuteronomy chapter 30 uh 30 verse 11 there is something that is beautiful there uh Deuteronomy chapter 30 I never walked this way before so I trust that the Lord will be able to help us are we together you love the Lord amen it says for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it is is it what far off we are we together yeah the next the following verse it is not in heaven you see now whatever was a secret is no longer in heaven okay that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it down unto us that we may hear it and do it let's continue again neither it it is beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it watch what it says but the word is very nice unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou may do it right amen that's right you see now the word the thoughts of God his purpose is no longer in heaven his thought has been expressed so for you to receive something you must get in contact with his purpose because he has been revealed it belongs to you and your family amen thank you Lord amen amen is God a Healer tonight oh so the fact that you know it is no longer his thought he belongs to you right oh glory to God are we together so why are you not healed because brother preach the message why it says why is the uh I can't remember exactly what it said um I think it's in the book uh you know why the my children are not here why the you know uh he was asking the question why but if God Is A Healer is thought has been expressed but why are we not healed why are we not delivered amen why are we not changing amen amen does it mean that God Chang his mind no no is not a man to change Oh Glory to God are we together let let's let's look at Isaiah Isaiah 53 let me let me just go there for for for few minutes Isaiah chapter 535 I'm checking my time now it says here but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripe we were healed are we together right now in the healing the word healing there's a full package there it's not just the healing of your body that's right he never say here it's the healing of your body alone that's right because a man has three parts the man a human being has a soul a spirit and a body body right because it's the same exact same thing as the Tabernacle the Tabernacle had three parts the AR called The Holy place and the holies of holies it was just you know Moses built the Tabernacle in the pattern of what he saw in heaven but actually he was talking about a man because God does not live in in a temple made of men hands the hands of men is made out of when God takes a body a human being that's God's Temple having those three parts that's right amen so this healing here is the healing of your body is the healing of your soul it's the healing of your spirit all of it is a full package under the promise that's right amen that's right amen sometime it's easy to say Lord I need the healing of my body what about your [Applause] soul which is more important than your body amen amen amen amen because there is a world Beyond this flesh that's why Saint we need to give more amen amen to what is inside more than what we can have here amen the soul the salvation of the Soul by the feeling of the BM of the Holy Ghost that's right because that's where God lives God does not live in this thing in this thing this is a 16 element coming from dust sometime we focus more God if you heal me in my body some what about the soul God can heal you though because he gave a promise he will heal your body because that's his reputation on the line if you believe you receive it amen amen but if you can't receive for the the the the healing of your body what about your soul I will drop in few minutes here in our spirit because we need the healing of the spirit amen right how many of us need the healing of the spirit amen amen amen you know our spirit is sometime people don't talk about the healing of the spirit more more often but Saint what about the hurt of our life you know maybe we went through something when we were young our spirit has been affected by it right maybe by our imagination Maybe by a certain picture that you saw it trouble your entire entire youth it it changed the pattern of your life that's right maybe a word that somebody said he affected you what about memories what what about affection all of these things has been affected by some even the way we react you see somebody say hey God bless you you get mad it's not your fault there is something that is in your spirit that is not right amen amen amen your reaction does not just come randomly like this it's affected somewhere that's right amen so the only way you can get real healing you need to yield yourself fully to God Saints let me tell you something we need to be humble before the Lord thank you Lord there are things that we may not see but it's dwelling inside of our life our spirit has been affected but we all need that healing it might be anxiety it might be fear it might be complexes oh my goodness you see I'm going off my notes now yeah okay it can be things in our own spirit that God is Desiring to heal because he is unchanging right he did it in the past he can also do for you Church come on we need to wake up there are promises that belongs to us amen oh my in your body might be cancer it might be high blood pressure or sugar diabetes whatever you want to call it that demon it is but God still God huh amen Oh Glory to God it says for after 1 Corinthians chapter 1:21 it says for after death in the wisdom of of God the World by wisdom knew not God he pleased God but the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe salvation is coming from the Greek Soo that's right it means healing so there salvation people think like oh it's just for the soul no it's the healing of the Soul amen the man was born under he was born in sin his soul was already corrupted Ed but God says no that's the place that I want to dwell in that's right amen you know when when when uh oh my goodness time is flying you know when when when uh Solomon was building the Temple second Chronicle it says God want to dwell in the thick oh let's let's read it in the thickest Darkness God want to dwell in even in your body brother say God is Desiring to dwell in the heart of the worst prostitute in town amen are we together Sint that's the desire of God he want to dwell even if you look at this no this is a mess but God is looking and say no I want that person that's right I want to take over the body of that person even if they are T even if they are d situation but I want Towell in and God is fighting his way through he want to get into the soul of a man amen amen but he wants a heart that would believe him amen because he is unchanging prise amen that's right are we together amen God is unchanging amen now he want to reveal he's Desiring he says I want my people please my people I want you to know I want to show you that I don't change we just right God want to show you that I don't change if you trust me I will do something for you amen s we're going through a lot the people of God are dealing with look at what is going on around just in one prayer meeting look at the list of prayer requests you know why the devil is so Furious because he knows that his time is short so now if it's the end of time what am I going to do I will will fight my way to and just D everything that I would just make try to make them uncomfortable because it's time to go home Saints let me tell you something it's time to go home Saints amen amen amen he want to show to the heads of Salvation the head of the promise the imitability of his word Romans chapter uh chapter 9 verse 6 let me just pull up a little bit here to know who are the heir of the promise so we'll read a lot of scriptures here real quick here who are the heir of the promise Romans chapter 9:6 it says not as though the word of God has taken no effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel we coming from Abraham right and then Abraham because Abraham gave birth to Isaac is that right but Isaac was the son after the Flesh and we're about to read it uh not as though the word of God has taken n effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are Seed of Abraham are we together right are they all children but Isaac shall be uh that seed uh be called is that right that is they which are the children of what the flesh these are not the children of God are we to is that the Bible right but the children of the promise accounted for the seed not Isaac but the the children of the promise not the children after the flesh are we together right now in the book of galatian chapter 3 uh I think galatian chapter 3: 16 you see you remember the scripture we just read right because it says but the children of the promise accounted for what the seed is that right galatian 3: 2028 it says there is neither Jew no let let me read 3:16 now to Abraham and his seed with the promise promises made is that right he said not to seeds right since there is in plural is that right as of many but as one to th seed which is Christ am amen so the children of the promise must come through Christ amen not through Isaac we are sitting here because we coming the way of the promise praise the lord we not come because we're not Jew here right is there any Jew in our meet here but the way we are called children of Abraham is through Christ amen it was referring to Christ Oh Glory to God Amen are we together now it says there is neither Jew no Greek there there is neither bound no free there is neither male nor female for We Are All One in Christ Jesus amen right yes verse 29 now watch this very carefully if ye be right if ye be crisis right then are ye Abram what seed and a according to what promise not according to the flesh according to the promise are we together and brother bam says this I like this the church choosing law for Grace preached in 61 15 it says but as it was with Israel natural so it is with Israel spiritual we are Israelites because we are the Seed of Abraham the Israelite is not thou which of the flesh but thou which is of the spirit we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are heads with Abraham according to the promise are we together are we together it says Abram was not a Jew Abram was a gentile out of the land of the CES and the City of or he was absolutely a gentile that's a prophet oh my goodness so now it says that you must come through the promise to Christ but how to be partakers how to be heads of the promise through Christ by one baptism amen amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost AM amen you want to find the scripture I think I think it's first uh Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we'll read it very quickly here and we'll close I know time is now our friend 1 Corinthians chapter 12 oh 2 Corinthians chapter 12 my my my I do you love the Lord amen I think it's 2 Corinthians chapter 12 Second Corinthian chapter 12 oh my I can't I can't find it oh perfect wow that's the one I was looking for it says by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body and that body is the body of Jesus Christ right whether we be jew or Gentile whether ye be bound or free and have been made to drink into what one spirit so for the body is not one member by many is a many member body that's right so in order to be crisis you must be born into that body am and to be born into that body is not the natural birth like this it's the new birth amen amen amen so the new birth gives you access to be a of the promise amen amen so if you are born again amen that promise Bel so God want to show unto you theability of his word amen wow the the room got a little quiet amen but this belongs to you even the baptism of the Holy Ghost is yours yes praise the lord it's not just for you alone but for your children too amen amen amen are we we serving a living God s we serving a living God that promise is not just for you alone God is thinking even about your children even your grandchildren God is thinking about them amen amen do you know that one decision that you can make tonight can affect them how many of us know it one single decision that you can make tonight would affect his children they can't see how the Holy Ghost has changed you they say God I want to be like Dad I want to be like Mom change me too and they St going on their knees asking for the Holy Ghost is because they've seen an example amen that same Jesus does not change is here tonight amen if you could heal your heart and say God I know that you are changing in your way amen amen you cannot promise something in the word and then it change your mind tomorrow God is able to give to you am Saint we come in every single night sometime we come in to worship and pray God has a purpose for your life amen God is Desiring the Holy Ghost is not just any man he wants you to receive it there's nobody who has more desire for you to receive the Holy Ghost In God sometimes say God I've been praying for so long you're not giving me he knows he's the one who care more about you receiving it than yourself he want you to receive it and the key was given to Peter the the day of Pentecost he said what must we do to be saved the simple thing it says repent it says repent be baptized every single one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a promise unto you and your children that's right how many of us believe it thank you Jesus I'm about to close we have desire in our heart we have things that we are asking asking the Lord tonight how many of us have a desire deeply in our heart maybe is a healing that you have or you need look at what the prophet says here Christ is revealing his own word he says it says it says they say how was the Bible people say I was writing with a man not long ago he said think of it is on this Earth the way we are and the only the uh we only know or can only say that we are saved by some Jew Fable called the Bible right this man that was with brother bam I said sir I don't know how you say that but I don't believe it's a Jews Fable I said he said well you pray do you pray to uh uh uh what do you pray to I ask for so and so and so certain things and I didn't get it watch what the prophet says I said you pray wrong he says I pray you know I ask this this and I never receive anything but the says you pray wrong he says you should never pray to change God's mind sometime when we pray oh God I'm dealing with change this situation God's plan is already made he already oh my goodness you should pray and say God I need your will in my life amen as a son and a daughter of God you need to ask more of his will than what you think amen amen what the prophet says continue he says you pray wrong you should never pray to change God's mind we should pray to change our mind God's mind don't need any changing God's mind do not need any change it does not but we are the one that need a change amen amen I need a change in my life amen you may not see it but deep inside I need a change MH amen sometime it doesn't mean if I stand here then I'm the perfect guy no no I need a change you know brother Lafont read a quote last time he says it's not the change of the ministry it's the change of the person amen amen because if you change it will change your ministry as well amen people will not just see how much you can preach people will see a change life amen it's not not just a go Church going people can see you in church but what will impact them the most is a change life amen amen how many of us believe that if you have a need in your heart you can just lift your hand and say lord it's me I need help God is unchanging he had promise he has given us plenty of the promise prises in the Bible it's there for you to take it to believe it to take hold of it and that will bring that change yes shall we pray Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord unworthy that we are father Lord we love you we appreciate you Lord you are worthy to be praise tonight father on this Wednesday night Lord God you've called us to hear a portion of your word father you have spoken unto us Lord to know that you are unchanging in your ways father you have given us plenty of your promises they're laying there in the Bible but sometime we're so distracted to access it Lord but Lord our prayer tonight oh God may you open our eyes may you open our desires oh god father so that we can run to it and possess everything that belongs to us Lord many of your children oh God are seeking the body sick in the spirit oh God even their soul father but Lord only you can heal father Lord God we pray tonight may you come in the power of your Resurrection Lord may you change things around oh god father in the life of your children Lord God May that promise oh God these promises that are lay in the Bible does not just stay in the page of the Bible God but come out of History father come out of the page of the Bible Lord and have effect in the life of your children father we ask these things oh God may you just bless oh God your people bless your servant oh God bless bless the church we give everything to you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen may God wish you bless you Saints God bless [Applause] you on the same God we want to thank the Lord tonight and U thank the Lord for helping our brother and know uh for him to switch over from playing to preaching but we just appreciate the Lord as a wonderful exhortation you know when we talk about Divine Healing the only thing that receive Divine Healing is your soul because if if you get sick in the body and we pray for you and you get sick again the it was a healing because the healing of the sword is feminine when a person receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's feminine you don't receive the Holy Ghost and then you lose it and then you receive it again so what actually experience Divine Healing and it's true Isaiah chapter 53:5 you know uh uh by his tribe you are healed actually in the Greek it speaks of more than the healing of the body that's truth it's speaks of every form of healing Jesus died for every form of healing every form of [Music] healing but for the healing of the Soul it happens once and that's when the a Son of God or a daughter of God received the baptism of the Holy Ghost even within our spirit you see the spirit man uh that's what Paul says we are Washed by the Water of the word because the spirit needs constant cleansing one of the one of the proof there is that you can forget there is no way you can do anything to forget and that is in your spirit so but the spirit need cleansing when we are cleansed by the word even though we remember but it don't affect us like when we go through the art so it's that form of healing that we get in our spirit every time we are cleansed by the word every time the the water of the word wash us that's the reason why you can leave a habit and go back to [Music] it that's in the spirit real you can you can you can get the flu and and and you take medication or you be prayed for you you get healed and then you get sick again so we goes through that cycle we experience healing in and out but that Divine Healing when it when it when it speaks about Divine Healing and you see that's the reason why brother Brandon identified those things in his ministry that it was now all about the healing of the body that came under his first first pH of ministry called the first P that was for the healing of the body the second P was for the healing of the spirit that's the reason why he went back and and just like brother ER said I can still remember a few days ago it even came to my mind I was thinking on that I can remember as a child I think I was I was maybe about four years old or so if I if if if I'm right in my mind four or five but I was very little I I went to buy I went to buy a donut and I was running in excitement back home didn't know just just like a child running this and a dog charged you know ran to me I mean if a a a that thing frighten me until till now in my in my mind I still re memory and that thing affected my spirit we had dogs home and uh and and I love dogs but I mean like somebody that we just that that is really into dogs I'm I'm not that way you see and and and by the grace of God you know you hear those things brother B and pick them on tape you know you were you were you were affected when you were small and and right from then on you know I I prayed over it you know many times and and you know I'm I'm not I'm not uh uh in that state of fear because brother Bram says that's what the dog send if a dog charge after you he send fear when he back at you because he send fear in you and it's a way for the dog to defend itself because he send fear in you he thinks you're going to attack it so it starts to back at you you know and uh but there are a lot of things lot of things there are a lot of things even even when you deal with children when you yell at children you yell at a child that the child stutter that can affect that child's spirit that it could create a battle for them the rest of their life [Music] when a child has a has a habit and you and you labor them it can affect their Spirit their spirit is very tender and all through they are up growing they will struggle you know they they will never they will never come to the place to appreciate themselves they will always think that uh you know they need people to tell them that they are nice or they are pretty you know uh and all of that people that always seek for people to raise them and all you know uh uh sometimes you know as as as a little person there might be called names or things said to them you know so so we all and that's what the word brings to us when the word of God is preached it brings healing in this area when Peter preach they receive the holy ghost that was healing to kenas and his household and that's the reason why that Divine Healing that baptism of the Holy Ghost is more than anything because the prophet of God said you you know well you can have that and you even lose your mind you lose your mind you're not in the right mental state it do not affect your soul [Music] let's sing that chorus tonight if we can if we'll do justice to a the same God remember [Music] that who wonders remember remember okay let's let's see if they'll
