[39:33] and we thank you for the many ways that
[39:36] you are touching our lives this we ask
[39:39] tonight in Jesus name Amen amen
[39:45] first Kings chapter 17 on Sunday we
[39:49] started the life of Elijah the
[39:52] importance of the ministry of Elijah I
[39:56] just take for skin chapter 17
[40:10] first Kings chapter 17 praise the Lord
[40:28] first Kings chapter 17 we read from
[40:31] verse 1 again and Elijah the Tishbite
[40:34] who was of the inhabitants of gatling
[40:37] said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel
[40:40] even before whom I stand there shall not
[40:46] be deal not rain this years but I call
[40:51] him to my word and the word of the Lord
[40:55] came unto him saying get thee hence and
[40:59] turn thee is wall and hide ourselves by
[41:04] the Brooks chariot that is before Jordan
[41:11] and it shall be that thou shall drink of
[41:16] the broth and I will commend the Raven
[41:18] to feel be there
[41:21] amen let's pray father we just want to
[41:25] ask your blessings tonight again we love
[41:27] you and we appreciate you Father Lord
[41:29] come and take us Lord Jesus the young
[41:32] law father glad I will touch tonight we
[41:36] want to actually for inspiration we also
[41:38] want to ask you for the ability to hear
[41:40] from you tonight in Jesus name we pray
[41:43] amen
[41:44] Allah bless you may have your sips and
[41:48] it will be in the house of the Lord and
[41:49] I praise the Lord amen
[42:02] praise the Lord
[42:08] start talking about the importance of
[42:11] the larger ministry and there were a few
[42:14] things I said Winston Amy's on Sunday
[42:16] morning I want to go over there just so
[42:19] we can be right in line with the
[42:22] scripture a little bit in and one of
[42:25] those things was you know just like when
[42:27] we read the scripture just now and I was
[42:30] looking at there today and I thought
[42:33] about it as is so you know here is
[42:36] Elijah the prophet year with with this
[42:40] great advance from now and Israel in
[42:44] seeing the way a happened Jesse bear I
[42:48] mean is they are taking the people on a
[42:50] dia grape and he bring the message to a
[42:53] hub and the scripture says and then the
[42:56] law told him to go and hide himself get
[43:03] away and go by the Brooks sheriff and
[43:12] and he would drink of the Brooks and God
[43:17] is going to feed him with raving a
[43:19] commander raving to feed him and I was
[43:22] just thinking about it because if you
[43:24] look in a book of you look in the Book
[43:28] of Leviticus the ravings were one of
[43:32] their own clean verse so that's a kind
[43:38] of a paradox that take place under the
[43:41] Elijah Ministry and the Lord used Raven
[43:45] year one of the thing that is major on a
[43:48] larger ministry is the other it comes
[43:50] and it declared judgment and mercy it
[43:55] brings judgment and mercy to the people
[43:58] and honor judgment it brings a fami no
[44:04] rain no deal that's funny
[44:08] Elijah ministry Brody on Elijah ministry
[44:13] that was
[44:13] also a family honor Elijah ministry God
[44:17] is using Ravens unclean birds to feed
[44:21] the Prophet on Elijah ministry God is
[44:24] going to use lepers unclean humans to
[44:28] also feed the people because it's the
[44:30] lepers that went into the city and call
[44:34] the people to a revival praise the Lord
[44:38] so there's a paradox here on the John
[44:41] the Baptist there was also a family
[44:43] because for hundred years the people
[44:45] never had a prophet so there was a
[44:47] spiritual famine that was that was that
[44:49] was also on the land and then year God
[44:51] also will be using people like Matthew
[44:55] and and all these disciples that were
[44:58] not laying to the Levitical priests who
[45:00] to be disciples of of the master so
[45:03] there is there is a paradox that is
[45:05] taking place under the elijah ministry
[45:07] that we have to look at very closely as
[45:09] we go along
[45:11] praise the Lord but I want to go back to
[45:14] the three and a half years quickly
[45:16] before they're slipping because
[45:20] sometimes you I mean you see some things
[45:22] and you reflect on it and then you you
[45:27] try to go back to the scripture to make
[45:29] sure that you are saying what you are
[45:31] saying right Elijah said here in verse
[45:34] one first king he came on to a hub as
[45:40] the Lord God of Israel ever before whom
[45:44] I stand there shall not be do all rain
[45:49] this years now he did not put how many
[45:54] years to me right here he said this
[45:58] years amen now we will fight we were
[46:04] realize that it was our Lord Jesus the
[46:09] actually put time to it see Luke chapter
[46:13] 4 let's go quickly to us in Luke chapter
[46:16] 4
[46:32] see Luke chapter 4 verse 25 see Luke
[46:38] chapter 4 verse 25 I gotta make sure
[46:40] that I mean look and then I go look
[46:43] should I mean strong it falling it look
[46:47] make sure that I'm in verse 25 is that
[46:50] reading something different verse 24 and
[46:53] Jesus said verily I say unto you lo
[46:56] prophetess is accepted in his own
[46:59] country but I tell you of a truth many
[47:03] widows were in Israel in the day of
[47:07] Elias when the heavens were shot for
[47:11] three years and six months when great
[47:16] famine was true out all the lame amen
[47:21] our Lord Jesus bought time to it
[47:25] three years in six months he brought
[47:27] their out they Apostle James I can say
[47:31] like their that he opposed to James
[47:33] because he sat down under the Lord Jesus
[47:35] so he took it from Jesus
[47:38] and in James chapter 5 verse 7 he also
[47:42] put time to it
[47:44] amen but there is something that is over
[47:50] also in in chapter 18 of first King
[47:59] there is something that is in chapter 18
[48:02] of first King let's go back there
[48:18] praise the Lord
[48:25] in first Kings chapter 18 verse 1 and it
[48:30] came to pass after many days that the
[48:34] word of the Lord came to Elijah in the
[48:37] third year saying go show thyself on to
[48:44] a hub and I will send rain upon the
[48:48] earth amen
[48:53] so here the scripture is establishing
[48:57] that Elijah came in the Tyrian and there
[49:05] should be at the end of the tail year
[49:08] because it was three and a half years so
[49:10] he came at the end of the tail year to
[49:13] now remove the curse from on the land
[49:16] praise the Lord
[49:18] now you will see the reason why I said
[49:21] this six months can only rightly be fed
[49:25] into the time Elijah met God before he
[49:30] came to speak to a hub because he ever
[49:36] said year in in the in the 18th chapter
[49:39] he's coming in the tail year to remove
[49:43] the curse then what are we going to do
[49:45] with the six months because Jesus said
[49:49] it was three years and six months do you
[49:57] see what I'm going with this praise the
[50:00] Lord because the Word of God cannot be
[50:03] broken scripture can contradict itself
[50:07] and we can only be grateful that God has
[50:12] given us a prophet to help us rightly
[50:16] place these words amen
[50:19] so that is that is one of the things
[50:21] that I will want for us too for us to
[50:23] first establish before we go over as we
[50:27] want to travel year because I remember I
[50:30] said that on on Sunday morning and I
[50:34] just went farther with faith and never
[50:37] came back to death
[50:38] so as we see here Elijah brings the
[50:41] world we look at the Kings and and and
[50:44] when I went home I was also also
[50:46] steadying on the kings of Judah we will
[50:49] look at there too because there were
[50:52] there were cases that were right in
[50:54] between the kings of Israel and Judah
[50:56] and we will find time to look into the
[50:59] schemes as well but we will see here
[51:01] there he pronounced this word and he
[51:04] said to the a hawk there will be no rain
[51:08] or Dew you know do or rain now we have
[51:12] to understand there you go in a book of
[51:15] of joy Jared is talking about what the
[51:20] locusts have eaten the Palmer won't the
[51:22] kinda wound the caterpillar jaw is
[51:25] dealing with Israel I call him to the
[51:30] the ax farming seizing praise the law we
[51:35] have to realize that the Israel the land
[51:38] that is given to them that where they
[51:40] are now is a dessaline the Prophet did
[51:45] prophesied that the desert was going to
[51:47] blossom and his blue so many men because
[51:50] God said it and God had to back up his
[51:52] world praise the Lord
[51:54] but it's a desert lane and because of
[51:57] that Israel how this what we hear as the
[52:01] the the the letter rain and the former
[52:04] rain is is more the Prophet brought it
[52:07] to us more in a spiritual application
[52:11] but for Israel a farming season they had
[52:17] the the earlier ring that came and then
[52:20] the letter rain also now if we ever go
[52:24] without one of this rain they were there
[52:28] they were also blessed with the deal I
[52:34] mean they were also blessed with the
[52:38] deal so for Elijah to come on the scene
[52:41] and and and said there will be no rain
[52:46] there will be no deal or
[52:49] that you have to know how serious this
[52:53] situation was praise the Lord
[52:57] now the reason why are all so that we
[53:01] can we can take the the spiritual
[53:04] application of the former rain and the
[53:07] latter rain we read a scripture on
[53:09] Sunday also in in the tournament chapter
[53:13] Terry to where God said my mind you know
[53:16] my word would go out like the rain you
[53:20] know and my speech would be on to you
[53:22] like the deal praise the Lord
[53:27] so if you take that that also we help us
[53:30] to understand why joy the prophet in the
[53:35] prophets all through the scripture how
[53:38] to they can they can look at Israel
[53:43] situation they can look at the the
[53:47] unnatural situation and be able to tell
[53:50] how the spiritual situation is going to
[53:53] be let me bring it to you this way
[53:57] Pharaoh had a dream I mean and in his
[54:03] dream that he had
[54:05] he saw lain counts and he saw fat cows
[54:12] praise the Lord and then he comes now
[54:16] and call his wise man no matter who
[54:19] found the answer to it praise the Lord
[54:23] now when Joseph was caught on the scene
[54:27] and the law would give Joe say the
[54:31] interpretation of that dream praise the
[54:35] Lord
[54:36] I mean he sought link house and he saw
[54:41] fat cows but when God would give Joseph
[54:45] the interpretation of the dream it could
[54:48] just rightly fade because Israel that
[54:52] was the word that God did with them
[54:56] praise the Lord also and
[55:06] you will realize that I'm trying to see
[55:22] if I can be able to nail this down for
[55:25] you in a way there are when David none
[55:32] of the people I'm trying to to catch you
[55:35] into this
[55:36] when David num other people and the law
[55:38] came to David that night and told him
[55:42] the evil that he have done there were
[55:45] three things that was placed before
[55:46] David one of them was pestilence
[55:52] amen another one was famine and the Terr
[56:00] one was swor now if you go and you read
[56:08] Jeremiah and you read all of those
[56:10] prophets you will see that was those
[56:13] were the the three signs of judgment now
[56:22] Davis said ah Lord you deal with me
[56:27] don't put me in the hands of the enemy
[56:29] wish of course I don't want saw I don't
[56:32] want war sois will always represent war
[56:36] it was always saw pestilence or farming
[56:41] how are we together I'm trying to get a
[56:50] scripture here quickly that I can be
[56:52] able to - sorry Lynn if my mind you know
[57:00] where we have gone this way
[57:02] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[57:06] you know you don't need a pray and ask
[57:08] the Lord to take you beyond your notes
[57:13] so when he start taking you beyond your
[57:15] nose thing you don't have nothing to say
[57:18] amen praise the Lord
[57:24] I'm trying to find good Ezekiel chapter
[57:28] 7 verse 15 let's look at this this one
[57:32] verse would be able to put our our our
[57:35] thing into context here Ezekiel chapter
[57:39] 7 verse 14 7 I mean 15 the swore is
[57:44] without the pestilence and the farming
[57:48] within he that is in the field shall die
[57:53] with the swarm he dead is in the city
[57:57] famine and pestilence shall devote him
[58:00] now so this word the three types of
[58:05] judgment three signs of judgment so it
[58:08] was either s war with me war or it was
[58:13] farming which means no food or
[58:15] pestilence sickness if you look right
[58:20] down I mean all the way down from
[58:22] Abraham whenever God who deal with his
[58:26] people it will always be one of these
[58:28] three praise the Lord Amen so you will
[58:34] see that the the rain and ado had very
[58:39] serious significance to Israel are we
[58:45] together until when when when when
[58:53] Joseph or when Jacob was blessing his
[59:00] sons
[59:10] you realize that the deal was was was
[59:16] always port the autonomy chapter 33
[59:22] verse 13 and Joseph said blessed be the
[59:25] Lord blessed of the Lord be his lane for
[59:31] the precious things of heaven for the
[59:34] deal and for the depth their cash
[59:37] beneath and Genesis 27 38 so what what
[59:43] I'm trying to bring here is that do you
[59:45] had a great significance in so much that
[59:49] God who compared the deal with the
[59:52] speeches that comes from his mouth I
[59:56] mean he says the rain would be like my
[1:00:00] doctrine and the deal will be like the
[1:00:04] speeches that comes from a mouth so
[1:00:10] Elijah the prophet coming on the same
[1:00:12] and telling the people that would be
[1:00:15] there will be nor do you and no rain
[1:00:18] until I cover it up I get some
[1:00:20] scriptures laying out here joint chapter
[1:00:24] 2 verse 23
[1:00:27] Jeremiah 3 verse 3 chapter 5 verse 24
[1:00:32] you will see how all of those things
[1:00:34] played in the deal and rain they were
[1:00:36] very significant to Israel until when
[1:00:42] Jacob blessed his son he that was Isaac
[1:00:51] that was Isaac that blessing came from
[1:00:53] Isaac that's in genesis chapter 27 and
[1:01:03] Isaac his father answered and said unto
[1:01:05] him behold that that dwelling shall be
[1:01:08] the fatness of the earth and the dew of
[1:01:12] heaven
[1:01:16] from above so deal was a sense of
[1:01:23] blessing amen if it did not have the
[1:01:28] rain Lord don't take the deal amen
[1:01:33] if we don't have no rain Lord please
[1:01:36] don't take the deal because if there is
[1:01:42] no rain if there is no deal then it's
[1:01:45] death in the lane and that is the same
[1:01:49] thing in the church if there is no rain
[1:01:51] and if there is no deal is spiritual
[1:01:54] drought death in the pot like Elijah was
[1:01:58] saying so these things were very
[1:02:01] significant and that is the reason why a
[1:02:04] large your heart to come on the scene so
[1:02:08] you as who as we following the important
[1:02:11] of the Elijah ministry we have to see
[1:02:12] how is going to play out in the other
[1:02:16] it's going to play out the same way in
[1:02:19] Elijah is going to play out the same
[1:02:21] where in John the Baptist is you play
[1:02:24] out the same way in a larger promise on
[1:02:26] a Malachi form and even the same way
[1:02:31] honor the Elijah of Revelation chapter
[1:02:34] 11 pray so long because if we can if the
[1:02:41] Lord can be able to help us to see and
[1:02:44] understand the importance of the Elijah
[1:02:47] ministry we will know the time that we
[1:02:50] are living in and we will be grateful
[1:02:52] for the ministry that God has given to
[1:02:55] us praise the Lord yea the Lord takes
[1:03:01] him also down straining up three years
[1:03:07] there will be no rain no deal and God is
[1:03:12] taking him by a Brooks
[1:03:14] not even by a river praise the Lord
[1:03:21] God takes him by
[1:03:23] a little bro and God command the reading
[1:03:28] he didn't send offs he didn't say me go
[1:03:33] he sent the ribbing to feel his profit
[1:03:40] are we together guarding himself he's a
[1:03:46] law by himself
[1:03:49] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[1:03:52] why I was a last Wednesday we were
[1:03:55] speaking a little bit on the types in
[1:03:56] the shadow because Jesus said the
[1:04:00] scripture cannot be broken
[1:04:04] amen and the times and the shadow also
[1:04:08] cannot be broken because they are all
[1:04:10] part of the scripture that's what God
[1:04:12] used to be able to play out his word for
[1:04:14] us to better understand what his grace
[1:04:17] is doing praise the Lord
[1:04:22] amen while I was driving coming to you
[1:04:27] just about honor the light I was
[1:04:29] thinking about a code and I go in the
[1:04:34] office I did really did not find the
[1:04:35] time to be I mean to be able to bring it
[1:04:38] out but brother Branham said this and
[1:04:40] any applies to this Elisha bring the
[1:04:44] word there will be no deal there will be
[1:04:47] no rain until I call for it and then God
[1:04:53] tells him and says get the hints get out
[1:04:57] of the way God takes the light of Israel
[1:05:03] away he takes the Prophet away remember
[1:05:07] never BAM says Elisha was Jezebel pastor
[1:05:12] so in another sense because of the
[1:05:15] rebellion of the people because the
[1:05:19] people would not follow the Word of God
[1:05:21] what God would do he would take the
[1:05:24] garlic man of the scene and that's the
[1:05:27] reason why I was thinking about that
[1:05:28] scripture - not that co2 not because
[1:05:30] brother Branham say it applies to the
[1:05:33] church in as much as it applies
[1:05:37] to the home praise Lord amen verbatim
[1:05:46] says if if there is a church there is
[1:05:49] that is praying for the revival and I
[1:05:52] mean the people one a desire in the
[1:05:56] heart to get closer to God I've seen
[1:05:58] these things happening before and I mean
[1:06:00] the people are testing for God if the
[1:06:03] man that God placed there if he would
[1:06:06] not stand by the word if he would not
[1:06:08] seek the face of God and get under the
[1:06:10] burdens of these people God would take
[1:06:12] him off the scene amen and it's also in
[1:06:20] the reverse because exactly what was
[1:06:22] happening here Israel has gone away from
[1:06:25] the world
[1:06:26] Why should there be a prophet that would
[1:06:29] come and tell them does say the law when
[1:06:31] they were all going over to the to the
[1:06:33] temple of bill God will have to take his
[1:06:40] candlestick away praise the Lord brother
[1:06:46] Branham says if God give us a garlic a
[1:06:49] godly father or a Garland husband that
[1:06:53] was staying for the word and want to
[1:06:54] rule his family by the word he says if
[1:06:57] the home when our line of God would take
[1:06:59] the man away strip Jura principle the
[1:07:07] same thing wafer wafer with a godly
[1:07:11] pastor to a rebellious Church
[1:07:20] and you look on the efficient Church age
[1:07:22] he used that when he says I come and
[1:07:26] take your candlestick praise the Lord
[1:07:31] I bring out the coat and I'll read it to
[1:07:33] you directly so you see here so that
[1:07:37] that is exactly what was happening years
[1:07:39] Israel has gone away from the Lord so
[1:07:42] and God knows how to deal with these
[1:07:45] things he knows how to take care of
[1:07:46] these things all we have to do is to
[1:07:51] love the Lord praise the Lord amen if a
[1:07:57] man is not lining up with the word just
[1:08:00] love the Lord God knows how to deal with
[1:08:05] that if it is God's man he knows how to
[1:08:08] bring him on his knees he knows how to
[1:08:11] straighten him up
[1:08:13] but if we try to take a political round
[1:08:16] and see less riot and less you know
[1:08:18] let's rebelled because he's rebelling
[1:08:20] that is not God's principle are we
[1:08:28] together so that just drop of my mind
[1:08:32] while I was driving to church tonight I
[1:08:34] didn't have the time to really bring out
[1:08:36] the coat to you but I said so I will
[1:08:38] find it for you now so we see here that
[1:08:40] God took him right down there also told
[1:08:44] this Brooks it kind of awestruck my mind
[1:08:46] as well it's Josh Minh three years then
[1:08:51] God would take him down to a broke that
[1:08:55] would drive in six months no but there
[1:08:58] was also a widow that would take care of
[1:09:00] the Prophet praise the Lord Amen but you
[1:09:07] know sometimes that's the way God does
[1:09:11] praise the Lord
[1:09:14] look at his type
[1:09:16] what Bram says when when he went down
[1:09:20] that to the widow he says this must
[1:09:22] seems cruel for him to tell the widow
[1:09:26] fits mean a cake first
[1:09:29] after she have told him that this was
[1:09:32] the last one
[1:09:35] amen that this was the last one but in a
[1:09:43] way she obeyed the voice of the Prophet
[1:09:45] she went to make the cake and give it to
[1:09:49] the prophet and he larger prophesied
[1:09:53] that the bank is not going to to dry up
[1:09:58] the oil without finish and and God's
[1:10:02] Osteen at her now brother branham said
[1:10:04] it happened this way that it was not
[1:10:07] like Elijah said it and I mean her whole
[1:10:10] band just fell with with food all over
[1:10:14] but they were just enough every time she
[1:10:17] went to that day praise the Lord
[1:10:23] and that is the same way we're taking
[1:10:26] the Prophet down to a Brooks because if
[1:10:30] it's a big body of water and a river it
[1:10:33] shows a great revival praise the Lord
[1:10:37] and that's how the human mind is
[1:10:39] sometimes you find you know everybody
[1:10:42] talks about a revival that is happening
[1:10:45] in and I came soaring and then pretty
[1:10:47] soon everybody want to go and run to
[1:10:49] that revival but you have to realize
[1:10:51] that there were people down that I
[1:10:53] prayed and still of the revival and
[1:10:56] sometimes when we get there then we made
[1:10:59] them the water muddy praise the Lord
[1:11:05] sometimes God just wanted to have you
[1:11:09] down to a little country church where
[1:11:15] there was no piano there is no data
[1:11:18] there is no instrument just a little
[1:11:20] country church that is enough for you to
[1:11:24] get the Word of God every time sometimes
[1:11:28] that's what it takes to be able to more
[1:11:31] you praise the Lord
[1:11:47] I know that's what it takes to be able
[1:11:50] to mold me
[1:11:51] I mean sometimes he just he just want to
[1:11:58] put you to that place that would just
[1:12:01] have you trust him every time because
[1:12:08] when he said when when it's abroad and
[1:12:11] and it's going to dry up you have to be
[1:12:14] expecting a miracle to get water from
[1:12:17] there tomorrow when it's a river there
[1:12:21] is no expectation for miracle his river
[1:12:23] is running and that was the same thing
[1:12:28] he did down in the widow house where
[1:12:31] Branham says it was not just like the
[1:12:33] bag just grew and it was fallen off
[1:12:36] it was the same bag but the prophecy it
[1:12:39] will never go dry she had enough every
[1:12:44] time she went back to that empty side
[1:12:48] praise the Lord
[1:12:53] are we together and that's the way the
[1:12:58] Lord want us he want us to trust him
[1:13:02] that's what I said if it is not rain
[1:13:04] Lord don't take the deal praise the Lord
[1:13:09] amen I'll tell you a funny story I used
[1:13:16] to like the deal that time of the year
[1:13:22] we used to walk to school and then one
[1:13:27] particular reason why I used to like the
[1:13:29] deal just before I get to school I kick
[1:13:32] the bushes my shoes get wet I just wept
[1:13:35] it is shining
[1:13:38] I always used that to clean my shoes
[1:13:51] what is such a refreshing feeling to get
[1:13:55] honor the early morning you praise the
[1:14:00] Lord
[1:14:00] some what I experiences I could tell you
[1:14:02] but let's go ahead to night him in
[1:14:04] almost losing my time tonight praise the
[1:14:07] Lord
[1:14:08] so we see these things you know God
[1:14:12] breaking Sartre
[1:14:14] I mean such a great ministry on the
[1:14:17] scene challenging what is happening in
[1:14:24] that day the politics of the day I mean
[1:14:27] the bow worship and everything that is
[1:14:30] going on he's challenging it and
[1:14:34] remember a larger till now until he meet
[1:14:40] God in the mountain he's believing I'm
[1:14:43] alone I and I alone he don't know
[1:14:49] nothing about all of these believers
[1:14:51] that are scattered all over the world
[1:14:53] and crying to go for for rupturing
[1:14:55] failing and praying to God for the
[1:14:57] revival and I mean it
[1:14:59] they won the wars that they are really
[1:15:01] in the profit message to become real in
[1:15:03] their life he don't know about them you
[1:15:05] wanna know about himself he says I and I
[1:15:08] alone
[1:15:13] praise the Lord
[1:15:16] he's out there challenging a hub glory
[1:15:23] be to God and go out o him get to the
[1:15:27] Browse get off the scene you have spoken
[1:15:30] my word just get off the scene praise
[1:15:33] the Lord
[1:15:34] and Elijah goes off the scene he goes
[1:15:37] down there and we see he visited the
[1:15:41] widow's house after the Brooks driving
[1:15:45] and God told him to move foul he didn't
[1:15:47] even know were words the next place is
[1:15:50] going to survive from and you
[1:15:51] just think about it even larger if he's
[1:15:53] if he's applying this just like we read
[1:15:57] Deuteronomy chapter 11 if he is looking
[1:16:00] into Moses writing and talking about
[1:16:05] shutting up the heavens and that
[1:16:09] there'll be no deal and then here said
[1:16:13] that God is sending a raven to feed him
[1:16:18] when the very same prophet Moses say no
[1:16:23] those are unclean animals you think
[1:16:27] about it you think about it now just at
[1:16:30] the very time when God is about to break
[1:16:35] the revive or the blessing of Pentecost
[1:16:38] to the Gentiles God spread a table
[1:16:42] before Peter in a vision and say eat is
[1:16:49] it no law no III being taught all of
[1:16:56] these things are unclean things he says
[1:17:02] all of these things I don't clean things
[1:17:04] I've never eaten a none of them he goes
[1:17:09] back to sleep
[1:17:10] the vision comes back upon his head God
[1:17:13] tells him eat I were together just at
[1:17:22] the junction and what was happening here
[1:17:24] was the I mean the disposition was about
[1:17:28] to turn around the blessing of Abraham
[1:17:32] was about to pour upon these these
[1:17:35] strangers people that have been
[1:17:38] strangers they were only use they were
[1:17:44] brought in a little bit here a little
[1:17:46] bit there one came in called a rehab
[1:17:51] because a Hebrew general choose to marry
[1:17:56] her another one came in called a roof
[1:18:00] but this was the time word the fullness
[1:18:03] of the
[1:18:04] blessing was about to turn over to these
[1:18:07] people and God is using their vision to
[1:18:12] be able to convince this preacher praise
[1:18:18] the Lord Amen now you can just see
[1:18:22] sometimes why God have to use different
[1:18:27] ways to speak to us because he knew how
[1:18:29] we are made he know how stubborn we are
[1:18:32] the evening that we read it in the
[1:18:34] scripture we will say Amen to it but
[1:18:38] there would just be something behind it
[1:18:40] that we now want to let it go so he
[1:18:45] gotta use some kind of a different way
[1:18:47] to be able to bring us back to that
[1:18:49] scripture and said this is the thing I
[1:18:51] want you to obey because I'm telling you
[1:18:58] there is no way that Peter was ready if
[1:19:02] God who has spoken to him directly and
[1:19:05] said Peter go to the house of Colinas
[1:19:09] even the name Colinas would stumble him
[1:19:15] praise the Lord
[1:19:17] what was the one that pray for Paul and
[1:19:21] I mass go how to speak to him in a dream
[1:19:26] because the name of Paul was a terror
[1:19:32] praise the Lord
[1:19:34] so God put all of these this medium in
[1:19:37] the body he put he put gifts in the body
[1:19:40] he put different that a different way he
[1:19:43] designed us to be able to speak to
[1:19:45] Albert Branham called the channel of
[1:19:47] communication your China of
[1:19:51] communication might not be mine praise
[1:19:55] the Lord the danger there is that every
[1:19:59] channel that God will speak to you and
[1:20:02] deal with your heart must come in
[1:20:04] subjection to the word of God
[1:20:10] praise the Lord
[1:20:11] oh yeah sometimes you find people they
[1:20:14] are so gifted I mean they can dream told
[1:20:18] the description of colors and shape and
[1:20:21] everything I mean so perfect and well
[1:20:25] you have to realize that gift and
[1:20:28] calling without repentance so this
[1:20:31] channel that God have to deal with you
[1:20:35] was giving to you from birth it was
[1:20:40] given to you from birth you never got it
[1:20:42] when you got saved I mean when he
[1:20:46] designed you and put everything there
[1:20:49] that that is needed for your body
[1:20:51] together he had a particular China India
[1:20:57] that is the reason why even in your
[1:20:59] natural life you look at things
[1:21:01] different they are things that that
[1:21:04] speaks to you there - speak to me praise
[1:21:11] the Lord
[1:21:13] some people just natural things the
[1:21:16] looks odd and they see God in it so
[1:21:19] quickly and it can even see that there
[1:21:25] is nothing like Trinity Trinity is
[1:21:27] giving him difficult for them to see it
[1:21:29] but it can look a natural thing and you
[1:21:32] see God in it so quickly and we can see
[1:21:34] God in the scripture praise the Lord
[1:21:39] Amen so you think about it
[1:21:46] Elijah if he was really in the message
[1:21:51] of Moses he was reading the message he
[1:21:54] was feeding the message and God is
[1:21:57] telling him send a raven to feed him
[1:22:06] praise the Lord I believe there was some
[1:22:13] conflicts might have gone in his mind
[1:22:16] Maxie said Lord I'm not really in your
[1:22:18] will are you the one speaking to me I
[1:22:21] thought you said in your word that these
[1:22:24] were unclean animals praise the Lord
[1:22:31] but you see by every junction of time
[1:22:36] and every junction of time when God is
[1:22:43] about to turn dispensation over when
[1:22:49] he's about to turn Nations over he come
[1:22:54] around in a very light of his word and
[1:22:58] sometimes things were happy and it looks
[1:23:01] like it's contrary to God's Word Peter
[1:23:07] I'd you know law I'm not going to do it
[1:23:12] he goes to sleep he dream about the same
[1:23:16] thing he said no Lord I'm not going to
[1:23:18] do it I mean he fight himself out of his
[1:23:22] sleep he wake of it oh yeah thank God my
[1:23:28] goodness me he had just received the
[1:23:32] Holy Ghost he just came from in the
[1:23:37] upper room and he's struggling on a
[1:23:44] portion of the word god it's a god is
[1:23:48] interpreting that word God is about to
[1:23:50] make that word flesh in him because you
[1:23:53] see it's so easy for us to believe the
[1:23:55] word when it's on the book but for this
[1:23:59] word to take flesh in us many times
[1:24:03] that's where the struggle is because I
[1:24:06] mean we are so attached to our nature we
[1:24:09] are so attached to the special where we
[1:24:11] are made in a special way we can do
[1:24:13] things when the word is about to take
[1:24:15] flesh that is the reason why it had to
[1:24:18] be better in Jaws
[1:24:20] stomach sweet in his mouth when he's
[1:24:23] reading it when when they get down and
[1:24:26] start to materialize through his body
[1:24:28] and you see sometimes when we get to our
[1:24:30] weak points and we get to our failure
[1:24:33] it's not a failure to God to God he's
[1:24:38] breaking you apart so the word can be
[1:24:42] materialized in your body praise the
[1:24:49] Lord
[1:24:50] and sometimes it's it's so hard
[1:24:55] look at John he was the one that said
[1:25:00] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:25:03] the sin of the word amen he said it
[1:25:07] right there on River Jordan all of these
[1:25:09] disciples we're around him and now he's
[1:25:12] telling one of those men go and ask him
[1:25:14] is he really the Messiah praise the Lord
[1:25:22] well it's so easy for you to stand right
[1:25:25] there I said oh I don't know what's
[1:25:27] happening to this god I can't believe in
[1:25:29] man when he said at first it was so
[1:25:32] inspiring but now he
[1:25:36] it looks like he's changing his salmon
[1:25:38] it was the change of dispensation
[1:25:43] every time when dispensation is about to
[1:25:46] change when there is a major even that
[1:25:50] is about to happen this day the
[1:25:54] scripture is fulfilled better Blenheim
[1:25:57] did not plan it but he was willing to
[1:25:59] talk on birth pains and because birth
[1:26:01] pains was all about judgment and birth
[1:26:04] pains is fulfilling the second part of
[1:26:06] isaiah sister 1 gonna make a profit
[1:26:09] couldn't even find his scripture praise
[1:26:14] the Lord
[1:26:15] so sometimes when things are not just
[1:26:17] happening right don't think that God is
[1:26:22] lost
[1:26:24] god don't get lost in your confusion no
[1:26:28] he don't get lost in your confusion he's
[1:26:30] right there he's looking at you he know
[1:26:34] that you are confused but he's not
[1:26:36] confused because he know exactly what is
[1:26:39] happening praise the Lord
[1:26:44] Elijah I'm sending Raven to feel you
[1:26:47] Elijah norm there is no rain there is no
[1:26:51] dude there is no food for the matter of
[1:26:56] fact it has already deployed a man to
[1:26:59] arrest him and lock him up so he know he
[1:27:03] can go to the supermarket so now he has
[1:27:08] to eat from this unclean bird oh my
[1:27:12] goodness he's battling in his mind but
[1:27:17] yet he's obeying God's Word because you
[1:27:20] know God has spoken to him
[1:27:23] Peter come out of that dream those men
[1:27:28] came to his house not the door he's
[1:27:32] going to this Gentiles he's going with
[1:27:35] them all in his mind he's thinking in
[1:27:38] his mind these people urgent idea
[1:27:40] unclean they are not in the economy of
[1:27:42] God but he's following them yet because
[1:27:48] there was an anointing that is
[1:27:49] controlling him praise the Lord
[1:27:54] sometimes our body like the scripture
[1:27:57] says sons of God are led by the Spirit
[1:28:00] of God but you see when the Spirit of
[1:28:03] God comes on a believer it just does not
[1:28:05] take over your reasoning the Spirit of
[1:28:09] God don't make you stupid you got to
[1:28:11] keep your common sense
[1:28:13] keep your common sense
[1:28:16] praise the Lord amen
[1:28:19] it comes to anoint you to lead you in
[1:28:22] the path of God's Word you don't take
[1:28:24] out your senses you don't take out your
[1:28:26] emotion praise the Lord Amen because we
[1:28:32] hear people make those kind of I mean
[1:28:35] selling excuse
[1:28:37] I was late but I didn't know what
[1:28:39] happened you just left your senses back
[1:28:43] praise the Lord
[1:28:46] so he's going under the leadership of
[1:28:51] the Holy Spirit but he's having battle
[1:28:54] in his mind I don't know if you have
[1:28:55] ever been there before you know that
[1:28:59] everything you are doing is that calling
[1:29:01] to the Word of God but yet it's still
[1:29:04] not making sense to you you know why
[1:29:08] because God is working on the sixth
[1:29:11] sense and you are just on five because
[1:29:17] when fate comes down when that anointing
[1:29:20] comes down is the channel of the sixth
[1:29:22] sense and if you don't come up higher
[1:29:25] you will be all of that anointing and
[1:29:27] here you stinking fuse and he gets to
[1:29:32] the house he don't see no rabbi there he
[1:29:34] don't see no no no no Jewish Jews there
[1:29:38] he seems so so Gentiles
[1:29:39] oh my goodness okay he's so nervous it's
[1:29:48] good to be here praise the Lord because
[1:29:54] you don't know where to start from what
[1:29:56] I should say God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:29:58] Jacob all and we just can write it so
[1:30:02] levels if this is the way I'm going to
[1:30:09] go I come in my soul body and spirit in
[1:30:11] the hills maybe these people would just
[1:30:18] praise the Lord
[1:30:21] but the scripture says as he began to
[1:30:25] speak
[1:30:28] the Holy Spirit fear and the very same
[1:30:33] atmosphere that was in the upper room
[1:30:37] was created there
[1:30:41] Imperius Wow
[1:30:44] God is no respecter of persons
[1:30:50] praise the Lord
[1:30:52] so it's now we that control the word is
[1:30:55] the word that control it details our
[1:31:01] actions praise the Lord the Bible says
[1:31:07] as he begin well what was he's talking
[1:31:11] about he was talking about his vision
[1:31:14] that's all he was talking about he did
[1:31:17] not had a message he didn't know what to
[1:31:19] say to these Gentiles because he's all
[1:31:25] trouble in his mind well so you see when
[1:31:29] sometimes when God is about to bring his
[1:31:32] word to pass to fulfill his word he take
[1:31:34] an act situation praise the Lord in God
[1:31:42] or being the word for you in a manner of
[1:31:51] this believer just saying they born will
[1:31:53] be struggling energy they're going to do
[1:31:56] you know whatever they're going to do
[1:31:59] God is going to meet you right in that
[1:32:02] situation and when grace comes on the
[1:32:04] scene you will be so embarrassed of
[1:32:07] yourself
[1:32:09] praise the Lord you will be so
[1:32:14] embarrassed of yourself because one
[1:32:15] thing we have to know when he
[1:32:18] predestinated us it was now when we
[1:32:21] first start coming to church it was a
[1:32:24] work that was done from the foundation
[1:32:26] of the world
[1:32:28] when he wrote our names on a live walk
[1:32:31] of life it was a work that was done
[1:32:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:38] that's the reason why we can limit gone
[1:32:40] to time we can limit God to the
[1:32:44] situation around our life we have to see
[1:32:47] that God is bigger and greater then no
[1:32:50] matter what we are going through and we
[1:32:54] also have to believe that he have
[1:32:58] everything under control
[1:33:01] praise the Lord even though it looks
[1:33:05] like a chaos but God have it under
[1:33:09] control if we can just trust him praise
[1:33:14] the Lord
[1:33:15] if we can just trust him you remember
[1:33:18] the last time we talked about trust and
[1:33:22] better banham talks about that lady I
[1:33:24] say I trusted the Lord until the last
[1:33:29] card but then I said no you were holding
[1:33:32] on to something you should have trusted
[1:33:35] him when there was nothing to hold on to
[1:33:40] praise the Lord you have to trust him
[1:33:43] when nothing makes sense don't trust God
[1:33:48] with your five senses you have to trust
[1:33:50] God when nothing makes sense three years
[1:33:55] no rain no deal then God sent him down
[1:33:58] to abroad and God took an unclean animal
[1:34:03] to come and feed him when nothing makes
[1:34:05] sense you have to trust God and I'm
[1:34:12] telling you we are just getting in deep
[1:34:17] waters and like the prophet of God said
[1:34:20] a lot of strange things that would come
[1:34:22] around that will not make sense to you
[1:34:28] strange things will come around a
[1:34:30] strange report now we have the Internet
[1:34:32] you can put it out there there are
[1:34:33] things that will come that will make no
[1:34:35] sense to you but that's when God you
[1:34:38] want to bring that six thing
