[42:01] speaking this morning and looking at uh
[42:07] place of worship
[42:11] finding ourselves standing uh
[42:16] between those two mountains you have to
[42:19] realize that we're trying to to make a
[42:22] type of them so we can understand the
[42:25] date and time that we are in and and
[42:28] where am I where my emphasis was this
[42:33] morning is uh
[42:36] to realize that
[42:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[42:41] and forever amen praise the Lord he's
[42:44] the same yesterday today and forever and
[42:48] uh
[42:49] located in the scripture to realize that
[42:53] God
[42:55] told the children of Israel through the
[42:58] prophet that brought them out of the
[42:59] land of Egypt and yeah he's he's making
[43:02] them to know that uh even even the
[43:06] Passover that was that was given to them
[43:09] this is a shadow you know uh in
[43:12] remembrance of the Lord bringing them
[43:14] out
[43:16] out of the land of Egypt
[43:19] you know that the scripture is very
[43:22] beautiful the scripture is uh is is is I
[43:27] mean it's very bright it's very large in
[43:29] in uh in a lot of the things that you
[43:32] look at there was something that that
[43:35] came out to me while we were while we
[43:38] were ministering there for for better
[43:40] Flint I I preach on the on on the
[43:43] message that I spoke here
[43:45] the house of fears that's that was what
[43:48] I spoke on but there was something there
[43:51] that uh
[43:53] that came out
[43:55] because one of the brothers there uh
[43:59] [Music]
[44:03] Brett Andrews uh she looked down from
[44:06] Tucson there he he was he was one of the
[44:11] speakers too so he he spoke on
[44:13] Revelation chapter 5.
[44:16] so he was he was dealing with Revelation
[44:18] chapter 5 and talking about the lamb you
[44:21] know when and who is wanted to to take
[44:24] the book The Lion of the Trap of Judah
[44:27] has prevailed
[44:29] and and why he was speaking on that you
[44:32] know I mean a beautiful beautiful
[44:36] message she preached
[44:38] and then uh
[44:41] the next the next morning I was going to
[44:43] speak to complete what I was talking
[44:46] about because I did the first part of
[44:48] Faith the house of pharaohs and I was
[44:50] going to take the second son because we
[44:52] we used they have to type our first
[44:54] birth and our second birth
[44:56] and uh but what came out to me uh uh
[45:03] here is John in Revelation chapter 5
[45:07] speaking about who is wanted to take the
[45:10] book and to lose the seals and the Bible
[45:12] says there was no man that was wanted to
[45:15] take the book and to lose their seals
[45:18] thereof and uh and John wept the
[45:22] scripture says he wept because no man
[45:25] was walking but yet an angel proclaimed
[45:29] with a loud voice that uh
[45:33] the lion of the Trap of Judah has
[45:36] prevailed
[45:38] praise the Lord now when you go back
[45:41] over to uh to uh uh the birth of
[45:45] pharaohs over there in Genesis chapter
[45:49] 38 that word bridge when when when uh
[45:54] when pharaohs was born you have to
[45:56] remember his brother zero put his hand
[45:58] out first and he put the ribbon around
[46:00] his hand and then when he put his hands
[46:03] back then pharaohs came forth
[46:11] how have that bridge for you know the
[46:14] bridge is upon thee and because of that
[46:17] his name was called pharaohs that word
[46:20] bridge is the same as prevail
[46:23] right
[46:25] praise the Lord amen so if you look at
[46:29] Revelation chapter 5
[46:32] and I mean it's so beautiful there are
[46:34] just a lot of things that was that was
[46:35] kind of us streaming out of there to me
[46:38] but if you look at Revelation chapter 5
[46:40] and you take it back over here it said
[46:43] on a vision prophecy the Bible says the
[46:46] Lamb of God was sleeved from the
[46:49] foundation of the word
[46:50] which is in the back part of God's mind
[46:54] which means god taught about that
[46:56] praise the Lord and Yara said he's going
[46:59] to play it out yet in that in the life
[47:02] of Judah you have to know because they
[47:04] were speaking of of the kingship
[47:09] Judah was giving the uh uh uh uh the the
[47:14] the the breath right he was giving the
[47:16] breath right the scepter was supposed to
[47:18] come from the house of Judah and and and
[47:21] and and all of that and yerry said that
[47:24] down in his lineage what what looks like
[47:28] uh uh a a horrible act Judah out of his
[47:33] lust out of his lust that he would not
[47:36] even recognize that this is his daughter
[47:39] a lord
[47:40] look at the grace of God out of his lust
[47:45] that he will not even recognize that
[47:47] this is his daughter-in-law
[47:50] but yet out of that
[47:54] out of that
[47:55] the lion of the Trap of Judah will
[47:58] prevail
[48:02] praise the Lord
[48:06] what looks like a horrible art
[48:10] and even when the Mata was brought into
[48:12] the public
[48:15] Judah and in his self-righteousness
[48:20] it will say you bring Tema here with
[48:22] stone heart to to death
[48:25] because she has played the halot
[48:29] in his self-righteousness
[48:33] and then after they will be known that
[48:36] the man that has this breastless the man
[48:39] who has the staff is the man that I have
[48:42] deceived for
[48:44] and Judah will say she's more righteous
[48:47] than I
[48:50] praise the Lord
[48:52] I believe he started to look at the
[48:55] grace of God the the righteousness of
[48:58] God
[48:59] God will display his righteousness in
[49:03] such an act like that
[49:07] praise the Lord
[49:08] you see how how we need to trust God
[49:14] we need to trust God we need to take him
[49:16] for for who he is more than what we are
[49:20] doing
[49:21] more than what we can do more than what
[49:23] we can live out we must take God for who
[49:27] he is he is a righteous God
[49:33] praise the Lord
[49:39] I mean it's so beautiful when you just
[49:41] think out you think about it
[49:44] amen
[49:45] you just think about it God in that same
[49:49] lineage
[49:55] David will want to build
[49:57] a temple and God will say no to your son
[50:00] Solomon will build it
[50:03] praise the Lord
[50:05] and yet to see that
[50:08] Solomon will be the song that will come
[50:11] the second Psalm that would come out of
[50:15] David
[50:17] horrible art of killing your eyes
[50:22] but yet
[50:24] is bring out God righteousness
[50:28] praise the Lord
[50:30] saints of God unless we we saw learning
[50:34] to yield ourselves and and and and and
[50:37] embrace God's word and embrace God
[50:40] promises then relying on our
[50:43] self-righteousness
[50:45] amen
[50:46] and and and and and and
[50:48] don't give Rome to the anime uh uh
[50:52] blasting our mind and condemning us but
[50:55] look into the promises amen with a
[50:58] desire that God will be able to bring
[51:00] forth out of us what his word has
[51:03] promised amen praise the Lord I mean the
[51:06] righteousness of God is just it's just
[51:08] from sea to Sea amen from one page from
[51:11] Genesis all the way to Revelation is
[51:13] just all over the place that God will
[51:17] bring his word but yeah in that in uh
[51:19] our scripture we just read that God is
[51:22] now telling Israel that uh there's a
[51:26] place that he's going to put his name
[51:29] there's a place he will put his name
[51:32] and that is the place he's going to meet
[51:35] man
[51:37] that's a place of worship
[51:41] praise the Lord
[51:44] just like I said God knowing uh uh the
[51:47] nature of the people he made provision
[51:51] for
[51:52] for uh
[51:56] for their mistakes
[51:58] in a place where he gave them a City of
[52:01] Refuge
[52:03] if they were going to experience the
[52:06] adventure of blood if a man makes
[52:09] mistake and then a king's man will will
[52:13] avenge
[52:15] the wrong of another man he has a City
[52:18] of Refuge to run into
[52:21] God knowing
[52:22] that they will make those mistakes
[52:26] he knows that they are Nature has not
[52:30] changed no matter how much uh uh God has
[52:33] there with a man and a man has done all
[52:36] these ordinances of God
[52:39] him
[52:40] that little place of uh uh uh you know
[52:45] forgiveness and putting the wrong honor
[52:47] the blood has now fully come for them
[52:50] yet
[52:51] amen
[52:53] he made that provision that whenever
[52:56] they were made a mistake there was a
[52:58] setting and the city the the sick City
[53:01] of Refuge they were put in such a place
[53:03] that they were not difficult to to
[53:06] assess
[53:11] their
[53:12] makeup he made their provision
[53:16] and he has done the same for us amen our
[53:19] City of Refuge it's just a whispered of
[53:22] prayer amen
[53:23] take the name of Jesus call upon the
[53:25] name of Jesus Amen his name is a strong
[53:28] tower that the righteous run into and
[53:31] they are safe
[53:32] glory be to God
[53:34] Hallelujah
[53:37] but you see even when God gave them
[53:39] their provision to realize that he
[53:43] played out so well that both they're
[53:46] seated and refuge and the adventure of
[53:48] blood
[53:49] was found in one man
[53:53] just as Jesus represented the City of
[53:57] Refuge
[53:58] he also represents the adventure of the
[54:01] blood
[54:04] praise the Lord
[54:05] because you have to realize that the
[54:08] adventure of blood has to be the nearest
[54:11] Kingsman
[54:15] it is only the nearest case man
[54:18] there can Revenge
[54:21] the wrong that was done to another man
[54:24] so just like how uh uh Boaz was the
[54:29] nearest case man that could that could
[54:32] redeem a roof
[54:36] praise the Lord
[54:38] that was also how this adventure of
[54:41] blood is play are many people will look
[54:43] at the adventure of blood to be the
[54:45] devil but known
[54:48] it has to be the nearest Kingsman
[54:52] praise the Lord
[54:54] so you see a God in his Mercy kind of
[54:57] foreplay it out in a place where he
[55:00] provided Mercy for us if we would run
[55:03] unto him
[55:04] now refusing his Mercy then we now get
[55:09] condemned
[55:10] if we refuse God's mercy we get in the
[55:13] hands of the adventure of the blood
[55:15] then God will avenge that wrong upon us
[55:22] praise the Lord
[55:25] that's where he played the ball that's
[55:27] the reason why the lion of the Trap have
[55:29] prevailed but when John looked behind he
[55:32] saw what alarm
[55:42] a lion has prevailed
[55:45] to take the book
[55:47] and you have to realize that a lion is a
[55:50] George
[55:53] but alarm
[55:56] is the city of our refuge
[55:59] so to refuse God's Mercy is to expose
[56:02] ourselves to the adventure of blood
[56:05] and God is going to Revenge that so just
[56:07] like how he made a provision for them to
[56:11] be able today wave their wrongs their
[56:15] Arrow run to the city of The Refuge also
[56:17] yeah God is making a provision for the
[56:20] people there's a place
[56:23] word he says that he will take a worship
[56:28] from the people where they will have to
[56:30] come and and and uh and uh fulfill this
[56:34] ordinance that he has given them
[56:36] reminding them how I brought you out and
[56:39] you know all that you have to do there
[56:42] is a provider place a choosing place
[56:44] where God has placed his name and that
[56:47] is the place that he will meet man
[56:51] praise the Lord honor a shadow the place
[56:55] that God will meet man and and and and
[56:58] even that his worship will be accepted
[57:02] if this is play out so well that uh you
[57:06] realize you go back in in the scripture
[57:08] and you look at it you will see that
[57:10] this place of worship was laid out for
[57:13] many purpose
[57:16] even even the ties that were brought in
[57:19] on onto the Lord have to be brought into
[57:23] the chosen Place God will accept uh uh
[57:27] uh uh the 10th from the from the people
[57:30] when it's brought to this place of
[57:32] worship he will not just take it from
[57:33] them anywhere it has to be brought to
[57:36] the place of worship
[57:42] praise the Lord
[57:44] amen
[57:45] and I saw God is is uh you know is is
[57:49] making a provision here for his people
[57:51] and all of these things is speaking
[57:53] about uh uh uh uh it's all represented
[57:57] in Jesus Christ we know that is the
[58:00] place that God has put his name
[58:02] that is the place that he's going to
[58:04] meet man
[58:06] amen
[58:07] not not in the not in the building you
[58:10] know not in the system
[58:12] but God choose to meet us in Christ
[58:16] Jesus
[58:18] our reconciliation is in Christ Jesus
[58:23] praise the Lord
[58:25] because right there in Saint John
[58:27] chapter 4 you have to realize Jesus made
[58:30] a statement there uh we didn't pick that
[58:33] up this morning but he told the woman
[58:35] salvation is of the Jews
[58:39] amen
[58:40] neither God is going to take worship
[58:43] from this place neither God is going to
[58:45] take worship from this other place but
[58:47] he says salvation is of the Jews and
[58:50] your worship what year know that
[58:53] right
[58:58] why because uh right in there the
[59:01] ordinance that God gave Moses everything
[59:04] that he was going to fulfill in Christ
[59:06] they are all in touch and Shadow
[59:09] everything that is in the Lord
[59:11] everything about the Tabernacle
[59:15] praise the Lord everything about the
[59:17] Tabernacle even the tables in the
[59:20] Tabernacle the the uh their feet was set
[59:23] in in in a silver plate speaking about
[59:26] uh Redemption
[59:30] the way that Tabernacle was designed and
[59:33] everything in the tablet everything was
[59:35] pointing to Christ
[59:37] every ordinance that God gave his people
[59:41] they were all appointed to Christ
[59:46] the Lord
[59:51] so God
[59:53] has prepared this place
[59:56] and that is the place where he will meet
[59:59] man
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:03] that's the place where he will meet men
[1:00:06] for Fellowship
[1:00:08] you have to we have to realize that when
[1:00:12] man broke fellowship with God in the
[1:00:14] Garden of Eden it was God making a
[1:00:17] provision it was God coming down and
[1:00:20] trying to reconcile men back into
[1:00:22] Fellowship
[1:00:25] by slaying the lime and calling Adam
[1:00:28] Adam where are you
[1:00:31] praise the Lord
[1:00:35] like we said it's now that God never
[1:00:38] knew where Adam was but Adam never knew
[1:00:40] where he was
[1:00:43] because he was hiding himself the place
[1:00:46] that used to be of glad tidings for him
[1:00:49] to go now he's hiding himself
[1:00:52] and making excuses that woman that you
[1:00:54] have given me
[1:00:56] he says now I know what I'm making I
[1:00:58] can't count for who told you you were
[1:01:00] naked
[1:01:01] that's what God Said Amen
[1:01:04] now so we see all of that God making
[1:01:07] Provisions what we're trying to bring to
[1:01:09] to to us tonight is to realize that we
[1:01:14] have a great provision before us
[1:01:17] you know even as we come to to a
[1:01:20] convenient service tonight the communion
[1:01:23] do not make us uh uh you know righteous
[1:01:27] or better than the rest of the other
[1:01:29] believers
[1:01:30] but what we are coming to it is that
[1:01:33] it's a promise that we are identifying
[1:01:35] our self-wave
[1:01:36] amen there's a promise of God that we
[1:01:40] are identifying our self-wave
[1:01:43] Jesus has given us an Holiness we must
[1:01:45] come together
[1:01:47] and when we come to such a time like
[1:01:49] this we must remember one another
[1:01:52] amen it's a time where we can come and
[1:01:56] realize that everything that God had
[1:01:59] promised the provision that he had made
[1:02:02] our security our protection our blessing
[1:02:05] he placed everything in Christ
[1:02:12] so we come looking to him tonight he's
[1:02:14] the Lamb of God
[1:02:16] realizing that the worshiper is now on
[1:02:19] an examination is our land that is under
[1:02:21] examination
[1:02:29] that's what I'm trying to draw our mind
[1:02:31] to Everything Is Right In Christ
[1:02:37] thank you
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:40] it's in Christ
[1:02:45] even our rapture
[1:02:48] is in him
[1:02:51] praise the Lord
[1:02:54] Everything Is Right In Christ
[1:02:58] and we have to believe in that finished
[1:03:00] work
[1:03:01] the Bible says his work was finished
[1:03:04] from the foundation of the word
[1:03:12] are we together
[1:03:15] you know it's almost like when you look
[1:03:18] at the the the the city of The Refuge
[1:03:21] and and the adventure of blood you look
[1:03:24] at the the the scapegoat
[1:03:28] Moses was supposed to take two girls
[1:03:34] and one was supposed to they were they
[1:03:37] were supposed to lay their hands on one
[1:03:39] make all their confession and allow that
[1:03:41] to go
[1:03:43] they go either with a mess
[1:03:45] praise the Lord and another one as they
[1:03:49] made their confession on they were going
[1:03:50] to take that one and sacrifice that
[1:03:56] and the goal that was going to be
[1:03:58] sacrificed and the one that was left
[1:04:00] loose to go before them represent Christ
[1:04:08] so God takes all of these promises
[1:04:12] and place it in himself
[1:04:17] he is our place of worship
[1:04:21] praise the Lord
[1:04:25] and here is the one that they the the
[1:04:27] entire Old Testament was pointing to him
[1:04:29] every promise in the Old Testament was
[1:04:32] pointing to him and every C years now
[1:04:34] among his people
[1:04:37] he will despise and all of these people
[1:04:40] are now cut to their their tradition
[1:04:44] when he speaks of the Tabernacle
[1:04:46] destroyed this temple in three days they
[1:04:48] say oh wow you are blaspheming against
[1:04:50] the temple
[1:04:51] the people get so trapped into their
[1:04:54] tradition
[1:04:56] right well you see the the the the the
[1:04:59] message of the hour the son of man
[1:05:01] Ministry came to call them into true
[1:05:04] worship call them out of those
[1:05:06] traditions
[1:05:09] praise the Lord
[1:05:10] we are called to the person of Jesus
[1:05:13] Christ that's our Focus
[1:05:25] the hour has come and now it is
[1:05:28] what the truth worshipers
[1:05:31] who worship the father
[1:05:34] in spirit
[1:05:37] and in truth
[1:05:40] praise the Lord
[1:05:43] he's calling us
[1:05:45] to a higher form of worship
[1:05:49] where the word will be made flesh it's
[1:05:51] all about you know the expression of
[1:05:54] God's word
[1:05:56] May the light of the world where where
[1:05:58] we are set on the hill
[1:06:00] being assault world
[1:06:02] we can we can make men thirsty for God
[1:06:06] being a representation of God in the
[1:06:09] things that we do is all about
[1:06:10] glorifying Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] it's not about a Doctrine it's not about
[1:06:15] a Creed
[1:06:20] because if Christ is out of the picture
[1:06:24] we miss the whole thing
[1:06:29] praise the Lord
[1:06:31] Hallelujah if he's out of the picture we
[1:06:35] miss the whole thing
[1:06:40] the Apostle Paul was his whatsoever we
[1:06:42] do
[1:06:43] in words and these
[1:06:46] the way in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] for there is no other name given among
[1:06:51] men whereby we can be safe
[1:06:54] praise the Lord
[1:06:58] that's the reason why it was very very
[1:07:00] important
[1:07:03] that Damascus role experience
[1:07:06] knowing that this man will be the
[1:07:08] prophet to the Gentile
[1:07:11] when God appeared to him in the form of
[1:07:13] the pillar of Fire
[1:07:17] you have to say I'm Jesus
[1:07:20] whom that persecuted
[1:07:23] praise the Lord
[1:07:25] that was one took part out the backside
[1:07:28] of the desert
[1:07:29] because he wanted to reconcile this
[1:07:32] great Pillar of Fire this light
[1:07:34] this is the same light that led our
[1:07:36] fathers
[1:07:41] the pillar of Fire by day
[1:07:45] that the the Jehovah of the Old
[1:07:47] Testament
[1:07:48] was Jesus of the new
[1:07:52] praise the Lord
[1:07:53] that was the Revelation that consumed
[1:07:56] Paul
[1:07:57] when he understood
[1:08:00] that the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:08:05] was Jesus Christ
[1:08:08] that was why he cried that was that was
[1:08:10] why he was yelling he wished that his
[1:08:13] brethridge would understand it
[1:08:15] he wished that the Jews would see it
[1:08:21] he said I was not disobedient to the
[1:08:23] heavenly vision
[1:08:26] he understood
[1:08:29] that God robbed all his promises
[1:08:32] into a body
[1:08:35] a body would die prepare me
[1:08:39] it's not just like a second person where
[1:08:42] you get three additional person second
[1:08:45] tip no no no it was almighty God
[1:08:49] taking a body of Flesh
[1:08:54] to be able to fulfill his word
[1:08:59] praise the Lord it was almighty God
[1:09:02] coming and stepping into our shoes
[1:09:08] that was worthy taking off of shoes
[1:09:12] was playing out in Redemption everything
[1:09:14] is in Christ
[1:09:21] a burnt offering he is our peace
[1:09:23] offering
[1:09:25] all the offering and sacrifices
[1:09:28] Everything Is Right In Christ
[1:09:34] praise the Lord
[1:09:40] and when he came and do what among his
[1:09:42] disciples
[1:09:44] he was trying to bring this thing to
[1:09:46] them they were all caught up in this
[1:09:49] mindset of Jews against Romans they were
[1:09:52] also fighting their generation conflict
[1:09:54] in their mind
[1:09:55] and thinking that this is the god that
[1:09:57] will bring us from out of Roman root
[1:10:01] when actually
[1:10:02] his mission was to turn their heart back
[1:10:04] to the fathers
[1:10:07] praise the Lord
[1:10:13] he said you call me Lord and Master
[1:10:17] it is truth that's what I am
[1:10:20] well if I've been your Lord and Master
[1:10:25] I can
[1:10:27] wash your feet
[1:10:28] then do the same one unto another
[1:10:32] praise the Lord
[1:10:34] I pray that God
[1:10:36] will help us Church
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:40] he will help us to be able to see the
[1:10:43] reality you know over the years it was
[1:10:46] just being a daughter in war
[1:10:48] you know that that we thought this this
[1:10:51] Doctrine I mean we are quoting from the
[1:10:53] same Bible quoting from the same message
[1:10:55] but yet we went we went ahead of
[1:10:57] scattered with Doctrine and all of that
[1:10:59] and you know and trying to prove what is
[1:11:01] writing and and and and and the reality
[1:11:04] what was the reality
[1:11:07] was for God to be manifested for the
[1:11:10] Sons and Daughters of God to be
[1:11:12] manifested
[1:11:13] and all the doctrine Wars just put the
[1:11:15] people into fear
[1:11:18] we cannot reach out and take the
[1:11:20] promises of God we were only listening
[1:11:22] what did he say
[1:11:25] he quoted that quote right
[1:11:28] it just bounded the church in fear
[1:11:37] when almighty God wants us to experience
[1:11:40] his presence
[1:11:43] the presence of God the supernatural
[1:11:45] among the people
[1:11:50] where Sons and Daughters of God taking
[1:11:52] God by his word
[1:11:55] defying the enemy in their home
[1:11:58] defying the enemy in their marriages
[1:12:00] India in their young life
[1:12:04] praise the Lord
[1:12:05] why can we read about a little psalmia
[1:12:08] that we can read about David the
[1:12:09] shepherd boy and that same God cannot
[1:12:12] keep our young people
[1:12:17] praise the Lord why he should be only be
[1:12:19] good for the Old Testament
[1:12:21] yeah
[1:12:23] and Joseph can go down to Egypt
[1:12:27] as a teenage boy the time for him to
[1:12:30] enjoy his teenage life he's gone away
[1:12:33] thousands of miles away
[1:12:36] and yet God kept him
[1:12:38] even in the House of Fear in a protocol
[1:12:41] he will not defy himself
[1:12:44] Spotify he will not Define himself
[1:12:48] that same God can keep our young people
[1:12:58] this is all about making God real
[1:13:00] because he's a real God
[1:13:03] he never stopped in 1963
[1:13:07] he's not a god of 1965. he's the same
[1:13:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:14] he's not a historical God about only
[1:13:16] jury that we can just read these things
[1:13:18] in the Bible
[1:13:19] God want to Spring out of the
[1:13:22] lives become real in our home
[1:13:28] that our young people will not be
[1:13:30] ashamed to say that I'm a Child of God
[1:13:32] I'm a Christian I know where I stand
[1:13:40] and then
[1:13:49] praise the Lord
[1:13:57] while the Lord bless you tonight
[1:14:00] this is not a preaching service so we
[1:14:02] will not make one out of faith
[1:14:05] but we just try to encourage ourselves
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:11] that we are serving an awesome God
[1:14:15] praise the Lord
[1:14:16] and I tell you there's a New Testament
[1:14:18] Church that is rising up
[1:14:20] never before you find young people
[1:14:22] around the message
[1:14:24] that are beginning to break into the
[1:14:27] reality of God
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:35] they are breaking into the reality of
[1:14:37] God
[1:14:39] the word is becoming alive today the
[1:14:41] word is coming alive
[1:14:53] and he can do the same for us
[1:14:56] praise the Lord
[1:14:58] he can do the same for us

[1:16:44] religious
[1:16:46] he knows how to reflect to plague us
[1:16:48] with fears
[1:16:58] we have to believe in the work that God
[1:17:01] has done in our life
[1:17:07] brought us so far
[1:17:10] he has brought us so far
[1:17:12] that the devil
[1:17:15] will now want to stop blacking us and

[1:18:12] their life and God is able
[1:18:15] most of the time is our fear that is
[1:18:18] hindering us
[1:18:20] appearance in the promise of God because
