[17:55] san luca chapter four
[17:58] we know one of the big scenes the
[18:01] scripture set set up with jesus uh uh
[18:04] you know been in the wilderness
[18:06] uh where he fasted for 40 days and he's
[18:09] been tempted by the devil and he left
[18:11] from there and he went straight into
[18:14] the the the synagogues and now and that
[18:18] part of the scripture is very very very
[18:21] uh uh
[18:22] uh very very interesting to us very very
[18:26] important to us because we saw jesus
[18:29] right there
[18:30] going to
[18:32] uh identify his ministry
[18:35] by opening the scripture finding the a
[18:38] place in the bible and identifying his
[18:41] ministry and telling the congregation
[18:44] that this day
[18:45] this scripture is fulfilled
[18:47] in
[18:48] your ears
[18:50] so i will read from verse 20
[18:54] and he closed the book and gave it again
[18:58] to the minister and sat down
[19:04] and the eyes
[19:06] of all them that were in the synagogues
[19:09] were fasting on him
[19:12] and he began to say it unto them
[19:15] this day
[19:16] is this scripture fulfilled
[19:19] in your ears
[19:22] and all beg him witness and wander at
[19:25] the gracious word which proceeded out of
[19:29] his mouth
[19:31] and they said is not this
[19:34] joseph's
[19:36] son and he said unto them
[19:40] yahweh surely said unto me
[19:43] this proverb
[19:45] physician healed that self
[19:48] whatsoever
[19:51] we have heard done in companion
[19:54] do also here in that country
[19:58] and he said now this is where i want for
[20:00] us to study a little bit tonight i want
[20:03] to pick up from where we left on sunday
[20:06] but i just want to go in a little
[20:09] direction to encourage you tonight
[20:12] and he said
[20:13] verily i say unto you
[20:16] no prophet
[20:19] is accepted in his own country
[20:23] but i tell you the truth
[20:26] many widows
[20:29] were in israel
[20:31] in the day of elias
[20:36] when the heavens was shot
[20:39] up three years and six months
[20:43] when great farming was
[20:45] throughout all the land but unto none of
[20:49] them was elias sent self
[20:52] their
[20:54] seraphtide
[20:56] as cited in freedom
[20:58] onto a woman that was a widow
[21:02] and many
[21:05] lepers was in israel in the time of
[21:09] elizabeth
[21:11] the prophet and none of them
[21:14] was clean said neman
[21:17] the syrian
[21:19] and all day in the synagogues when the
[21:23] hair distance
[21:25] were filled
[21:27] with raft
[21:29] and rose up
[21:30] and trust him
[21:33] out
[21:33] of the city
[21:36] and led him on to
[21:38] unto the blood of the hell where on
[21:42] praise the lord
[21:54] their city was built
[21:57] that they might cast him down
[21:59] hello
[22:01] but he passed through the midst of them
[22:05] went his way
[22:08] dear lord jesus
[22:09] bless this portion of the word
[22:12] i pray that you will bring something out
[22:14] of it tonight
[22:16] that we will be instructed in
[22:17] righteousness something that will
[22:19] encourage our heart
[22:21] father that will not just only become be
[22:24] a hair knowledge lord but it will be a
[22:26] revelation in our heart to give us
[22:29] strength
[22:31] to be able to walk with you
[22:33] in such an evil age in such a doubtful
[22:36] age
[22:37] in such a gloomy day lord
[22:40] we need it father
[22:42] bless us together now
[22:44] in jesus name we pray
[22:46] amen the lord bless you you may have
[22:48] your seat i'll take a little bible
[22:50] studies here
[22:52] before i get into
[22:54] now there's there's one thing that
[22:56] caught my attention
[22:57] uh sunday while we were we were uh
[23:02] uh studying together
[23:04] and uh
[23:07] it really did not caught my attention
[23:09] when i was studying personally but when
[23:11] i was preaching then then it caught my
[23:12] attention
[23:19] praise the lord
[23:21] and and the thing that caught my
[23:23] attention
[23:24] uh
[23:25] uh
[23:32] was this uh
[23:34] we read
[23:36] on sunday from the message bombing gila
[23:39] and brother branham said this
[23:41] it caught my attention while i was
[23:43] preaching
[23:45] and he said
[23:50] the one thing we have to move up to now
[23:54] is a suffering faith
[23:56] to what
[23:58] to what we have had
[24:02] you cannot have that faith until you
[24:05] know perfectly
[24:07] what you are doing
[24:09] and just like i said it's not just only
[24:12] when you want to pray for somebody or
[24:14] you want to ask god for something
[24:17] is knowing what we are doing in
[24:20] in in our life amen in every aspect of
[24:23] our life
[24:24] we must we must know what we are doing
[24:27] and and he says here he says uh when you
[24:31] understand
[24:35] uh
[24:36] you walk just you just say well i'm
[24:39] going home
[24:40] i'm going out and i start my car
[24:43] that's all
[24:46] out of faith tomorrow i will meet you at
[24:49] a setting place that's all
[24:52] out of faith because
[24:54] you have done it so much
[24:58] it is a regular routine
[25:02] with you now that that was that was what
[25:05] caught my attention
[25:07] how god
[25:08] is in our regular routine
[25:12] praise the lord you know as as i'm going
[25:15] to read a few courses tonight on regular
[25:18] routine
[25:19] as you know as as christians as as
[25:21] believers
[25:22] you know uh uh
[25:25] uh down through the church
[25:27] ages you know uh many many have taught
[25:31] that uh
[25:33] uh you know there is there is one form
[25:34] of life for church and there is one form
[25:37] of life when we are out in the world and
[25:40] out and about you know and
[25:42] and
[25:43] you know uh subconsciously people gear
[25:47] into that without ignoring
[25:50] praise the lord the gear right into that
[25:52] let me read something to you as i would
[25:54] just as i'm just trying to
[25:57] to move forward here tonight uh uh verb
[26:00] says in a message jesus on the authority
[26:03] of the word he says now i have prayed
[26:05] for thousands of people
[26:07] just as a routine of praying for people
[26:13] but yet i don't know what's going to
[26:15] happen until he showed me
[26:17] he showed me what's going to happen then
[26:20] i have thou said the lord then the lord
[26:22] has brought the word
[26:25] inc in confirmation
[26:28] then i know now but uh what what i what
[26:32] caught my mind here as i was thinking
[26:34] about this he said i have prayed for
[26:36] thousands of people just as a
[26:39] a routine of praying for people
[26:41] now uh uh uh and and you find out that
[26:46] uh
[26:47] you know uh uh uh and even as you're
[26:49] listening on the tip and and you see
[26:52] that brother brandon people comes in the
[26:53] prayer line you know he he either hold
[26:56] them by their shoulder on their
[26:57] shoulders and he just pray for them
[27:00] but you'll realize that sometimes people
[27:04] try to to get it you know you know and
[27:07] and they try to look for that that
[27:09] spiritual voice you know
[27:12] uh
[27:12] [Music]
[27:13] lord jesus
[27:16] a father you know and and i mean
[27:23] i mean sometimes you do this you just
[27:25] grieve the holy spirit
[27:27] but it's thousands of people i've just
[27:29] prayed a regular regular routine of
[27:31] praying for people
[27:33] just a regular way that i would pray
[27:36] there is not a there is not a special
[27:38] way to pray while blessing my food

[27:59] scripture i said two will be on the
[28:01] field

[28:08] two will be in bed those are just the
[28:11] regular things of life
[28:14] that we do
[28:17] praise the lord so you see that that
[28:21] mentality of where people think you know
[28:24] oh it's church time i had to i have to
[28:26] put on my church clothes and and then
[28:28] they put on their church spirit and put
[28:30] on their church attitude it has robbed
[28:32] the church over and over
[28:36] of its power
[28:38] you think about it if if the church
[28:41] through the ages has just been living on
[28:44] the expectation every meaning of our
[28:46] life
[28:48] living honor expectation
[28:53] where we will be in faith
[29:04] he's in the regular routine
[29:07] of our life that's not just a few things
[29:09] i want to share to you tonight that's
[29:10] what caught my mind brother bam says he
[29:13] says here he says down he says no i
[29:16] don't know of all things he says look at
[29:19] john
[29:21] when he saw the vision out
[29:24] on the outside of patmos
[29:26] and so forth see what i mean he fell
[29:29] down before the angel
[29:31] feet
[29:32] and probably that was a routine of the
[29:35] day
[29:37] his daily routine
[29:40] praise the lord
[29:42] amen when the angel appeared to manoa
[29:45] and his wife they were now wearing suit
[29:47] they were not wearing their sunday
[29:49] clothes

[30:10] scripture i'm just i'm just trying to
[30:12] grab your spirit tonight
[30:19] whatever he said unto you do it
[30:21] sometimes
[30:23] it might seems like if you see something
[30:26] different
[30:27] we got a regular routine he says he says
[30:30] christianity has
[30:32] we just have to stay right in their
[30:36] routine
[30:38] amen
[30:41] all
[30:42] we are not christians
[30:46] this is that thing of
[30:49] putting on you know our
[30:52] our our religious clothes i mean that's
[30:54] that's where the word pharisees came
[30:57] from
[30:58] you know when brother brahman says
[30:59] pharisees mean atos that's that's what
[31:02] it came from
[31:07] and god don't want us to be actors
[31:10] he wants us to be lifeless stones
[31:13] amen he want us to be living money man
[31:24] he's in our daily routine
[31:28] he's in our daily routine
[31:35] oh if the law can just
[31:37] can just drop us into this
[31:41] because he said i will never leave you
[31:46] i will never forsake you
[31:50] amen
[31:53] i will always be with you
[32:10] now he says this one also in the message
[32:12] ikea let me let me take this and then i
[32:15] will go into what i want to share with
[32:17] you tonight
[32:23] a few days ago when when
[32:26] it looks like that maybe
[32:30] he wouldn't arrive
[32:32] just right and things
[32:35] look like
[32:36] was all against us the opposition is
[32:40] usually
[32:43] just dark as before day you know
[32:47] that's the regular routine of human
[32:53] that's the regular routine of human
[32:58] so
[32:59] when things are getting worse
[33:01] we can expect that it will get better
[33:04] because it's the regular routine
[33:07] of humans
[33:09] god have always walked that way
[33:11] [Music]
[33:15] but you see when things are getting
[33:17] worse then we get frustrated
[33:21] then we are overwhelmed with our
[33:23] frustration
[33:27] praise the lord when it is just the time
[33:30] that he is about to step on the scene
[33:32] [Laughter]
[33:34] praise the lord
[33:37] that is the regular routine of humans
[33:50] praise the lord
[33:52] amen
[33:53] just like brother branham says uh uh uh
[33:56] uh seed of this trip and said he says we
[33:58] must we must live our life
[34:01] our everyday life we must we must be
[34:03] people that are in are that that are
[34:06] honor you know a desperation
[34:09] talking about applying the talking he
[34:11] says but but when do we wait
[34:14] to get desperate when there is an
[34:16] emergency situation
[34:19] he says that's what we wait for what
[34:21] make us to do that way it's our falling
[34:24] nature
[34:26] our fallen nature has has has uh has uh
[34:29] oriented us in a way that we wait for
[34:33] things to become you know uh uh in in in
[34:36] in honor of a kind of an emergency
[34:38] situation then we get desperate then we
[34:40] want to make things to happen when we
[34:42] when we're supposed to be living an
[34:45] everyday life
[34:47] of desperation
[34:48] their everyday life on our expectation
[34:56] praise the lord
[34:58] taking sides with jesus brother branham
[35:00] said he said
[35:03] he says those old testament scenes
[35:06] he said those old testament saints they
[35:08] will come up in the resurrection he said
[35:10] because every one of them
[35:13] when paul was preaching about the
[35:15] rapture
[35:16] paul never said
[35:19] they're in the future
[35:23] no he said they're without us
[35:29] so they all
[35:30] preach about the rapture as if it would
[35:33] happen in their time
[35:36] they were looking for that to happen
[35:39] so they died with that expectation
[35:42] so brother brahms says they are going to
[35:45] rise up with the sin anticipation
[35:49] because they went down with it
[35:52] that's why we bring the old testament
[35:54] things out all all the sins of the ages
[35:59] the sins of all the ages because they
[36:02] thought just imagine those people that
[36:05] were burned at the stake in order that
[36:06] they thought that it was in their time
[36:09] that was the thing that gave them faith
[36:11] for them to be able to hold to the word
[36:16] honor the condition
[36:17] that they were living
[36:22] praise the lord
[36:24] amen
[36:29] so god shows up
[36:32] in our
[36:33] daily routine
[36:36] amen
[36:37] when he wanted to meet the woman at the
[36:39] way
[36:41] he never went for the best moment of her
[36:44] life
[36:48] he waited for the moment where she just
[36:50] sneaked out
[36:52] that was her routine she watched the
[36:54] time realizing that i have to get down
[36:56] and get my my water quickly because i
[36:58] can mingle out with those women and you
[37:00] know i don't want anybody talking about
[37:02] me or asking me questions and all of
[37:04] that
[37:06] and that was just the best time that he
[37:08] needed to meet her
[37:16] praise the lord that's just the best
[37:18] time he want to use us in in the grocery
[37:21] store
[37:24] he want to use you i mean a pushing
[37:26] cotton and talking to somebody in in the
[37:28] mechanics store or wherever it is
[37:31] though those are the places where
[37:35] the lord
[37:36] loved to be he just he just don't like
[37:38] these four walls called church he likes
[37:40] outside he created outside
[37:50] praise the lord
[37:52] that kind of forgot my mind
[37:54] but
[37:59] that caught my mind it had me thinking
[38:02] since wednesday i've been thinking about
[38:04] it so i had to say something about it
[38:08] it's been ministering to me how
[38:10] god shows up
[38:12] in our routine
[38:15] praise the lord
[38:16] even you just you just take you just you
[38:19] just
[38:20] take a
[38:22] a good inventory of your life you
[38:24] realize that
[38:26] he shows up
[38:28] in your routine
[38:29] praise the lord
[38:31] sometimes it's just when you are just
[38:33] there
[38:34] washing dishes
[38:36] that something just strikes you
[38:39] he just shows up
[38:44] praise the lord
[38:51] sometimes some of the silly things you
[38:52] do
[38:54] he just shows up something just
[38:57] just speaks to your mind and you sit
[38:59] right there fighting your nails
[39:08] he's a peculiar god
[39:11] let's get to the word tonight amen i
[39:13] just i have five minutes to preach to
[39:15] you so
[39:16] let's let's get to the word tonight
[39:19] now
[39:19] there is there is something here that is
[39:21] that is interesting
[39:23] there is something here that is
[39:24] interesting i was going to i was going
[39:26] to go over from the book of daniel
[39:28] tonight and what i wanted to
[39:31] to to pick up was uh the the
[39:33] the the nebuchadnezzar image
[39:36] uh
[39:37] which of course uh
[39:39] god gave
[39:41] the king nebuchadnezzar that dream
[39:44] to be able to show to him what would
[39:47] represent the gentile kingdom
[39:51] and
[39:54] we know this is the kingdom of of
[39:57] of uh
[39:58] uh babylon and we know it is is the
[40:01] medes and and the persian we know also
[40:05] is is the kingdom of the greeks
[40:08] and we also know uh he end up in the leg
[40:11] which is the roman
[40:12] kingdom
[40:13] praise the lord
[40:15] and by bible prophecy
[40:18] by the word of the lord
[40:19] by the word of the lord
[40:22] that is
[40:24] what in god's mind that he calls
[40:27] superpower
[40:30] russia america germany and all of these
[40:32] people
[40:33] god don't consider them superpower the
[40:36] united nations called them super power
[40:39] in god's mind
[40:41] the superpower
[40:43] for the gentile kingdom
[40:45] are these are these nations
[40:50] are we together
[40:54] okay
[40:55] so
[40:56] we realized that uh
[40:59] right now
[41:01] you you will see you will see the uh uh
[41:06] during the time of daniel
[41:09] when uh uh
[41:10] dania had that time that you know
[41:12] waiting on the lord
[41:14] and and for the lord to be able to
[41:17] to to tell him what will happen to
[41:19] jerusalem and all of that 70 weeks and
[41:22] all that
[41:24] the angel told daniel from the moment
[41:26] that you prayed your prayer was received
[41:29] by the prince of pressure
[41:31] because at the time
[41:33] they will honor the persia kingdom
[41:38] amen
[41:39] at the time they were under
[41:43] uh uh the the pressure kingdom because
[41:46] it is just at the time what darus
[41:48] took over after the handwriting came on
[41:51] the wall and and beltachez broke his
[41:54] legs and you know and all of that so
[41:57] uh uh the the scripture is is
[42:00] identifying to us that uh
[42:03] that was the kingdom they were under and
[42:06] there was a power there was a
[42:09] a force of thy kingdom there there's the
[42:12] spirit behind it now you see paul
[42:16] paul uh uh identified the same thing
[42:19] let's look in the book of ephesians
[42:21] quickly i'm coming back i'm coming back
[42:23] to uh
[42:25] uh uh this uh
[42:27] seen luke chapter four
[42:31] but this is what i was going to talk on
[42:32] tonight
[42:34] just want to
[42:38] so you go there to ephesians chapter 1
[42:43] praise the lord
[42:58] praise the lord
[43:00] now now it's it's not ephesians chapter
[43:02] one it's ephesians chapter two
[43:04] verse
[43:05] two
[43:06] one and two
[43:08] and you have heat quaking
[43:11] we were dead in trespass and sins
[43:14] where in time past
[43:17] ye walk a calling to the cause of this
[43:19] word
[43:21] i call into the praise of the power
[43:26] of the earth
[43:27] the spirit
[43:30] that now worketh in the children of
[43:33] disobedience so until we are born again
[43:38] when we are birthed to this word we come
[43:40] right honor
[43:43] the prince of the power of the egg i
[43:45] don't care how pretty that baby is
[43:49] i don't care what godly home that child
[43:51] is
[43:52] we come right under the influence of the
[43:55] praise of the power of the earth the
[43:58] spirit
[43:59] the dwelling in the children of
[44:01] disobedience
[44:03] praise the lord
[44:05] amen
[44:07] that's what brother branham explained he
[44:08] says because of the serpent seed of what
[44:12] took place in the garden of eden our our
[44:15] spirit we we are born uh
[44:18] both our spirit and our body is born in
[44:21] sin shipley in iniquity so we come honor
[44:24] thy influence being predestinated it is
[44:28] only our soul that is that is kept from
[44:31] the influence of the enemy
[44:36] praise the lord
[44:38] that's the reason why brother brahm said
[44:40] he says when i was 12 years old i was
[44:42] going to give my heart to the lord he
[44:43] said but a spirit hover over me
[44:48] [Music]
[44:51] and that is with every one of us
[44:55] until we come to uh uh an understanding
[45:00] until we come to a a new birth
[45:07] praise the lord
[45:09] that's the reason why no no matter how
[45:11] ah
[45:12] all the effort we make and then we we we
[45:15] we teach the children and you know and
[45:17] and we we we give them the you know the
[45:20] the word of the lord we instruct them in
[45:22] righteousness but because this is
[45:24] something that influence our spirit
[45:29] they always have the tendency to bring
[45:32] and we all
[45:34] struggle with that
[45:36] praise the lord
[45:45] now so just like this this this is with
[45:48] the individual
[45:50] this is with the individual that is the
[45:52] same thing also now with the nation verb
[45:56] says every family have a spirit every
[45:59] tribe have a spirit every nation has a
[46:01] spirit amen
[46:04] but now we're talking about this this
[46:06] age right there from from the gentile
[46:09] kingdom
[46:11] praise the lord
[46:13] amen so so we see here
[46:16] that uh
[46:18] uh
[46:19] god
[46:20] showed to daniel
[46:22] the interpretation of the of of the
[46:24] dream
[46:26] and what actually was until the rock
[46:30] that is cut out of the mountain without
[46:32] a hand which is the revelation of jesus
[46:35] christ that would come in this last day
[46:38] that we struck that image at the feet
[46:40] until that revelation come this these
[46:44] are the super power that will that will
[46:46] control the gentile nation
[46:50] and now we honor that last power which
[46:53] is the roman power
[46:55] amen
[46:57] praise the lord
[46:59] a gentile kingdom that has messed with
[47:01] religion uh clay missed with iron
[47:04] so we see here that uh so just like how
[47:09] the prince of persia in the time of
[47:12] pressure war against daniel and
[47:15] and and and all god's believing children
[47:19] what against their prayers
[47:22] praise the lord
[47:24] not only their prayers you just think
[47:27] about in in such a time like there when
[47:29] you have all of those jewish are turning
[47:32] their back on god falling down and
[47:34] worshipping the the the image of
[47:37] nebuchadnezzar what was happening there
[47:39] was such a pressure on them
[47:42] yes
[47:44] the pressure of the age that's what
[47:46] better brain talks about this last day
[47:48] spirit
[47:57] praise the lord
[47:59] so
[48:00] now what where i was where i was going
[48:03] with this is that because on sunday we
[48:06] were talking about the super race and
[48:08] then we start talking about super faith
[48:10] and we start talking about the super
[48:12] grace that have come unto us so just
[48:15] like how the devil have a superpower
[48:19] to be able to influence the people of
[48:21] this age
[48:23] that's the same way god
[48:26] that is rich in mercy
[48:28] has also provided a release a super
[48:32] grace
[48:33] for his people in this age
[48:36] to be able to rise above all the
[48:39] deception and the lies of the devil
[48:46] praise the lord
[48:49] amen
[48:51] so i mean uh
[48:53] uh
[48:54] we can be grateful to the lord
[48:57] we can be grateful to the lord i wanted
[48:59] to use the time
[49:01] to to go
[49:02] over
[49:03] some of the things that i spoke about on
[49:05] sunday
[49:06] and and just and just
[49:08] show them to you in the scripture and
[49:10] also in the message time will not allow
[49:12] us tonight but let's get back in
[49:15] luke chapter 4 and so i can be able to
[49:18] show something something to you tonight
[49:20] and
[49:22] trust that the lord will bless it the
[49:23] bible says and jesus he closed the book
[49:26] and he gave it to the minister he sat
[49:28] down all the eyes of the people were on
[49:30] him
[49:31] and he declared this and said this day
[49:34] this scripture
[49:36] is fulfilled in your ears
[49:38] the bible says debate him witness
[49:41] and the wonder are the gracious words
[49:45] which proceed out of his mouth and he
[49:48] said
[49:49] is not this joseph's son
[49:52] praise the lord
[49:54] praise the lord jesus said he said unto
[49:56] them pretty soon you will say this to me
[49:59] physician heal that self
[50:01] because you sh you're going to say what
[50:03] has been done in company let us also be
[50:05] done here but a prophet is without honor
[50:08] in his own home
[50:09] now
[50:10] jesus now think about this now think
[50:14] about this it will make you to to
[50:16] understand and appreciate
[50:19] why the bible says that and all there
[50:23] that were in the synagogues when they
[50:24] heard these things they were filled with
[50:27] raft
[50:29] now just just imagine now
[50:31] they are all in the synagogues this this
[50:33] is this is the suburb day this is
[50:35] worship day and this stranger when they
[50:38] were not allow a man
[50:42] to go up there because because this is
[50:44] the temple this this is a temple that is
[50:47] in type of the tabernacle
[50:49] it only have to be the priest the the
[50:52] other one that had a ride to to to be
[50:55] able to handle the book
[50:59] praise the lord
[51:00] now so but yeren said a stranger
[51:04] walks into
[51:06] the tabernacle he was straight there
[51:10] and everybody looking at him
[51:12] they don't i mean uh
[51:14] uh and and he went and he took the book
[51:17] opened the straw
[51:19] and he read they're all looking at him
[51:22] i mean uh they never got angry they i
[51:24] mean i mean where where were the ushers
[51:27] where were the deacons where were the
[51:28] men that was supposed to protect the the
[51:31] the synagogues of people intruding into
[51:34] it
[51:35] but god had the spirit of all men under
[51:39] control
[51:41] amen almighty god was in charge
[51:47] praise the lord
[51:49] even if they hated him they loved him at
[51:51] that time
[51:53] praise the lord
[51:54] now so he went and then and then after
[51:58] reading the scripture identifying
[52:00] his ministry
[52:02] that this day this scripture is
[52:04] fulfilled
[52:05] in your eyes you are soon going to say
[52:07] you know what physician healed herself
[52:10] verily i say unto you no prophet is
[52:12] accepted in his own country
[52:15] i tell you the truth
[52:18] many widows were in israel he's talking
[52:22] to
[52:23] to to the people of god he's talking to
[52:25] to to israel he's talking to the jews
[52:28] that's what i want to say he's talking
[52:30] to the jews at that time many widow went
[52:32] in israel in the time of elijah now he's
[52:35] taking both elijah ministry and elijah
[52:39] ministry
[52:41] now watch this now because it will be it
[52:44] will be a blessing it would be of
[52:47] something that would edify us
[52:49] he's taking the two major
[52:52] ministry and we know that that ministry
[52:55] has have succession with the spirit of
[52:57] elijah moving on to elijah and coming
[53:00] upon john the baptist and he's also
[53:02] prophesied in this day amen and it has
[53:05] to go back again for the 144 thousand
[53:10] praise the lord
[53:11] so he says many widow
[53:14] was in the day
[53:15] of
[53:16] elijah
[53:18] when god shut the heavens
[53:21] three years and six months and they all
[53:24] know the story
[53:25] they all know it
[53:28] but the comparison that jesus is doing
[53:32] right in the cylinders
[53:34] on a jewish puppet
[53:37] the emphasis that he making
[53:40] is on a gentile
[53:46] on the jewish pulpit
[53:50] before all the robbers
[53:53] before the high priest he takes the word
[53:56] he's standing where they consider to be
[53:58] the holy place
[54:01] and the emphasis that he's going to make
[54:08] is to talk about a gentile
[54:13] the widow was a gentile
[54:15] nehemiah was a gentile
[54:21] amen
[54:23] the lord
[54:24] you're seeing the picture
[54:27] amen
[54:40] praise the lord
[54:45] [Music]
[54:52] but jesus have just
[54:54] have just read isaiah prophecy
[54:57] where the spirit of the lord god is is
[54:59] upon me he have anointed me
[55:02] to to preach the good tidings you know
[55:05] onto the poll and to heal the sick the
[55:07] broken heart and all that he just read
[55:09] that
[55:10] took the first part
[55:11] the acceptable
[55:14] year of the lord
[55:16] use that to identify his ministry
[55:19] this day
[55:20] this scripture is fulfilled
[55:24] in your ears
[55:26] praise the lord
[55:28] the bible says they all marvel
[55:32] are the wonderful words
[55:34] that have come from out of his mouth
[55:40] and then he starts to tell them
[55:46] on a larger ministry
[55:53] when ahab
[55:55] and jezebel
[55:56] and with all their prophets have brought
[55:59] israel to idolatry
[56:01] praise the lord even though elijah
[56:06] symbolically
[56:08] he restored the altar of the lord for
[56:10] the stones there
[56:12] and right before the eyes of the people
[56:14] god sent fire from heaven
[56:16] praise the lord
[56:18] and elijah said lord god let this be
[56:21] what would turn the heart of the people
[56:23] back
[56:28] but the heart of the people did not turn
[56:30] back immediately
[56:34] they saw the miracle they saw the first
[56:36] pool
[56:41] praise the lord
[56:42] and right after there the jezebel sought
[56:45] to kill him
[56:46] and he went the law of fear him we re
[56:48] felt him by ravens
[56:51] and now the lord sent him into the city
[56:55] to a gentile woman
[57:01] praise the lord
[57:06] to a gentile woman
[57:08] now so you see
[57:09] the
[57:10] other uh
[57:13] even though he had to pass that way
[57:16] what was playing out here this almost is
[57:19] is the book of ruth that was playing out
[57:22] amen
[57:25] for god to be able to get a gentile
[57:27] bride they had to take a jewish woman
[57:29] that would step out of her lane
[57:32] lost her son and he would come back with
[57:34] uh with with the gentile woman
[57:37] praise the lord
[57:38] so we know that uh i could use that to
[57:42] just kind of talk a little bit on on the
[57:44] coming of the lord but that's not where
[57:46] i'm going going to tonight
[57:48] is just to be able
[57:50] to to see that uh
[57:53] that's the reason why the second portion
[57:56] of that scripture of isaiah
[58:00] it had to be tied together
[58:03] it had to be fulfilled in the time of
[58:06] the gentiles
[58:09] because he was just passing through
[58:13] he just had to pass that way
[58:16] he had to be born
[58:18] just like i said god in his peculiar way
[58:23] he raised israel as a peculiar treasure
[58:28] so he would travel through the blood
[58:30] strain
[58:31] and become flesh he has already become
[58:34] flesh there was nothing for him to do
[58:36] but just passed that way and now the the
[58:40] the purpose now was was was to go and
[58:43] get a gentile bride
[58:47] praise the lord that's the reason why
[58:49] there is no way they could have received
[58:51] him there is no way they could have
[58:53] identified him that he was the messiah
[58:56] because what god raised israel up for us
[58:59] a treasure
[59:00] was just to use the bloodline
[59:04] for him god to become flesh
[59:07] and that has already been achieved
[59:09] through the virgin birth
[59:12] so the next treasure now
[59:15] was to get
[59:17] an eve
[59:19] was to get a woman in his image
[59:23] because the image of god in the
[59:25] beginning was male and female
[59:28] amen
[59:31] praise the lord so here's jesus here
[59:34] in the temple identifying his ministry
[59:40] can you see how easy
[59:42] it could have been
[59:44] with everybody mothering out his work
[59:46] wow
[59:47] is that not just a song how how eloquent
[59:50] we don't even know what school he went
[59:52] to my goodness he speaks the whole place
[59:54] is quiet
[59:56] it will have been so convincing
[1:00:00] for them to rally around him
[1:00:03] but just at the time where they were
[1:00:05] settling down
[1:00:12] then he preached another message
[1:00:14] [Laughter]
[1:00:16] just at a time where they were trying to
[1:00:18] be comfortable
[1:00:28] he was to pass that way
[1:00:31] he was just to pass that way
[1:00:34] but the reason why he passed that way
[1:00:38] was to get a gentile bride
[1:00:42] that's what he had on his mind
[1:00:44] so even at the identifying of his
[1:00:47] ministry
[1:00:49] he did not fail to declare unto them
[1:00:55] trying to tell them that look
[1:00:57] just like how it was
[1:00:59] honored the first elijah ministry
[1:01:04] it was a gentile
[1:01:06] that that that supported that ministry
[1:01:08] the second elijah ministry god used a
[1:01:11] gentile uh uh
[1:01:14] captain neymar
[1:01:23] are we together
[1:01:26] and you see in the picture
[1:01:34] he's identifying his
[1:01:36] ministry that this scripture
[1:01:40] is fulfilled
[1:01:42] but yet there is a purpose
[1:01:46] there is a purpose
[1:01:50] that's very peculiar
[1:01:55] and right there
[1:01:57] he'll be talking about
[1:02:01] gentile and that was the thing that got
[1:02:04] them angry
[1:02:06] because to the jews it was an
[1:02:07] abomination
[1:02:10] to even mention the name of a gentile in
[1:02:12] the synagogues
[1:02:20] praise the lord
[1:02:21] but you see jesus intention was not to
[1:02:24] make them angry
[1:02:25] jesus intention was to declare unto them
[1:02:29] what his mission was
[1:02:40] were there not many lepers
[1:02:42] in israel
[1:02:45] oh yeah there were many lepers
[1:02:48] don't you remember the story when elisha
[1:02:51] prophesied that tomorrow
[1:02:53] by this time
[1:02:55] a flower will be sold for this
[1:03:00] how did that prophecy came to pass it
[1:03:02] was leprous
[1:03:04] was it not the lepers that went to syria
[1:03:07] to the syrians and said we would if we
[1:03:09] would die let's go and die
[1:03:11] because they were farming in the land
[1:03:13] they were lepers
[1:03:17] praise the lord
[1:03:20] they were the one that went over to
[1:03:22] syrian and as they were getting over to
[1:03:24] to the syrian place god
[1:03:26] created a noise in the heavens that
[1:03:30] sounded like cherubs
[1:03:33] and those syrians got on their hearses
[1:03:35] and everybody ran from the time those
[1:03:37] lepers came they eat enough they went on
[1:03:39] a hill of of samara and start shouting
[1:03:41] to the people you don't die there is
[1:03:43] food here you'll come
[1:03:45] because they couldn't go in town
[1:03:49] so there were many lepers
[1:03:52] [Laughter]
[1:03:57] oh praise the lord
[1:03:59] god is a peculiar god
[1:04:01] his ways
[1:04:02] are past finding out
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:07] there were one of those uh uh uh uh how
[1:04:10] what is his name being hidden or
[1:04:11] something like that that that challenge
[1:04:14] elijah and said i don't know how this
[1:04:16] would even come to pass the bible say he
[1:04:18] taught it in his mind
[1:04:20] and the prophet take up his thought and
[1:04:22] say because you have thought like that
[1:04:24] you will see it
[1:04:25] but you won't taste it
[1:04:36] praise the lord
[1:04:38] now this is to show a close right here
[1:04:41] or pick up some time ago i mean sometime
[1:04:43] after
[1:04:45] if the lord uh
[1:04:47] continued to bless the thought
[1:04:49] this is to show how
[1:04:51] how much that god invested
[1:04:56] in having a bride
[1:04:58] how much
[1:04:59] investment he made how much preparation
[1:05:03] he made for us to to be in this
[1:05:06] age praise the lord
[1:05:10] just like uh
[1:05:13] paul said he says there are not many
[1:05:15] nobles among us
[1:05:18] there are not many
[1:05:21] smart guys among us yeah not many we
[1:05:24] haven't few but not many
[1:05:26] you know
[1:05:29] we don't have a
[1:05:31] lot of the guys on wall street among us
[1:05:35] and
[1:05:37] and sometimes
[1:05:40] with the people that god has given grace
[1:05:45] to
[1:05:45] be able to identify see the message of
[1:05:48] their day
[1:05:50] we have the tendency
[1:05:52] of looking ourselves looking at
[1:05:53] ourselves as as nobodies
[1:05:57] you know and and pretty soon we start
[1:05:59] comparing ourselves to one another our
[1:06:01] educational status
[1:06:03] uh how much we are paid how much paid
[1:06:05] this one is making how much pay that one
[1:06:07] is making how much money they want how
[1:06:09] what house this won't buy and and we and
[1:06:12] and we bring everything down
[1:06:16] to such
[1:06:17] a pitiful state
[1:06:20] when god
[1:06:22] invested in all of this
[1:06:27] praise the lord
[1:06:29] to get us here
[1:06:35] now see what the scripture says you
[1:06:37] think about it
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:40] the bible says
[1:06:41] when he when he made that statement that
[1:06:45] got so angry
[1:06:49] praise the lord
[1:06:50] they grabbed him
[1:06:52] he was taking him to the hill
[1:06:54] everybody mama that trust in life let's
[1:06:57] just finish with him
[1:07:01] they carry him up they went after they
[1:07:03] wanted to push him down so he can just
[1:07:05] roll down and just break every bones in
[1:07:07] his body
[1:07:09] and he got right there then he stopped
[1:07:11] some kind of a conversation came out
[1:07:12] they started talking and he just walked
[1:07:14] right among him
[1:07:19] just like when syrian ahmed came to look
[1:07:21] for elijah he said why are you looking
[1:07:23] for elijah
[1:07:27] you yeah go right down and go behind the
[1:07:29] hill pass down there you will see him
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:40] but it was just because
[1:07:44] he hired you on his mind amen
[1:07:52] just because
[1:07:55] he hides you on his mind
[1:08:00] he taught about a loud issue age
[1:08:04] age that would be one of the worst age
[1:08:07] the age that will that will actually
[1:08:09] once again see sodom and gomorrah it
[1:08:11] will not just be a story but it will be
[1:08:13] a life among the people age that will
[1:08:16] see the worst of every worse
[1:08:25] and just like there was a widow in the
[1:08:27] day of elijah
[1:08:29] there's a bride in this age
[1:08:32] that is going to rally around the
[1:08:34] message of elijah
[1:08:36] just like meme a nema that's uh the
[1:08:40] syrian captain was able to experience
[1:08:42] the bible says he experienced his body
[1:08:46] became like a baby
[1:08:48] when he did what the prophet told him to
[1:08:50] do he experienced the change of his body
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:00] with all of his proud dip yourself in
[1:09:03] the water seven times
[1:09:06] he went the first time he came i look at
[1:09:08] him said he complained
[1:09:10] this message just making me old
[1:09:17] when i was there in syria i used to be
[1:09:19] in the word i had curse in my head
[1:09:24] this message just making me old
[1:09:27] hey seven says
[1:09:28] go the second time
[1:09:35] when he did what the prophet told him to
[1:09:38] do
[1:09:41] the bible says his leprose was cleansed
[1:09:45] and his body became as a baby
[1:09:48] to tell you that there is enough power
[1:09:51] in this world
[1:09:52] to change
[1:09:54] the atoms of your body
[1:09:58] whether it is health wise
[1:10:00] whether it is habit
[1:10:03] whether it is in the bloodstream there
[1:10:06] is enough power in this world
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:21] the reason is that
[1:10:23] we're putting less value on the word
[1:10:26] and trying to look for it to come from
[1:10:29] somewhere else
[1:10:42] god bless you tonight musicians you can
[1:10:45] come
[1:10:48] this is a prayer meeting tonight
[1:10:51] with a few ones
[1:10:53] that were now well we pray for them
[1:10:55] we are believing that god will move on
[1:10:57] their behalf
[1:10:59] and we just wanted to bring a little
[1:11:01] hesitation to you
[1:11:03] and uh so let's just buy our house
[1:11:05] tonight
[1:11:06] and as we as we just
[1:11:13] change my heart to lord
[1:11:15] make it ever true

[1:11:56] of this word that has come to us in this
[1:11:59] last day
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:06] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:12:11] when the prophet of god says
[1:12:13] everything that you need for your
[1:12:15] journey
[1:12:17] god has placed it in the word
[1:12:20] can you believe god's word
[1:12:24] can you take god's word
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:34] the widow just took the word of elijah
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:38] she says i have this is the last that i
[1:12:40] have for me and my son
[1:12:43] she took the word of that prophet
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:50] the economy was bad
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:54] there was no job because there was
[1:12:56] farming in the land
[1:13:00] but she took the word of the prophet
[1:13:03] she took the word of another mortal man
[1:13:08] that told her bake me a cake
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] make for me first
[1:13:20] she took the word
[1:13:22] of a prophet
[1:13:24] over the knees of her of her own son
[1:13:33] brother brahm says in a natural mind it
[1:13:36] would be very cruel
[1:13:38] for elijah to go to the house of a widow
[1:13:41] there were many people there were many
[1:13:43] there many
[1:13:44] widows somehow stacks of food in the
[1:13:47] house
[1:13:48] but yet god sent her to the one that had
[1:13:52] only her last take
[1:14:00] she took the word of a man that she had
[1:14:02] never seen before
[1:14:15] are we just hiding ourselves under the
[1:14:17] message trying to look for cover trying
[1:14:20] to look for the place of comfort
[1:14:23] oh can we take this word and apply it to
[1:14:25] our life apply applied to our nature to
[1:14:28] believe that there is enough power in
[1:14:30] this world to change our habits and and
[1:14:33] change our lifestyle take the cruelness
[1:14:36] out of our heart the bitterness
[1:14:39] there is enough power in this world
[1:14:46] to blast every evil thought from our
[1:14:48] mind and every filthy thought and filthy
[1:14:51] desire there is enough power in the
[1:14:53] world
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:00] are we going to take god's word above
[1:15:02] our fears
[1:15:05] that we know she had a reason to be
[1:15:07] afraid

[1:19:26] jewish people
[1:19:28] that they abandoned their god and they
[1:19:30] became so fearful
[1:19:32] they became so oh god and so much
[1:19:35] pressure that they could worship an idol
[1:19:37] when you know that it's written in the
[1:19:39] word of the lord you must never bow down
[1:19:41] before an idol
[1:19:43] lord we have that same last day pressure
[1:19:46] that is pressuring people
[1:19:49] to look at the thoughts of a prophet
[1:19:52] look at the front of a man
[1:19:54] that was not ashamed to admit his fault
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:20:00] such a pressure lord yeah
[1:20:05] that we we quick to give into our fear
[1:20:10] we are quick to give into our fear
[1:20:14] and sometimes we are so terrified
