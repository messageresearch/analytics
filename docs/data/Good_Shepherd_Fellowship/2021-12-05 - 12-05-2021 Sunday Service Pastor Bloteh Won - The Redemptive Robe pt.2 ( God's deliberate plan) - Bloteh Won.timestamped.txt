[45:28] just to hide behind that cement
[45:30] and say everything that i want to say
[45:32] [Music]
[45:36] praise the lord
[45:38] the strange thing there is that i was
[45:39] just reading
[45:40] my first email that i got from him
[45:43] 2007.
[45:46] that was the first time
[45:48] he wrote me when i was back in africa
[45:51] i was reading that
[45:54] this morning and uh
[45:57] [Music]
[46:03] uh
[46:05] praise the lord
[46:07] but before i forget
[46:10] we will have
[46:13] community service
[46:15] the sunday after christmas that would be
[46:17] the last sunday of the year
[46:19] just because we will not be able to do
[46:21] with the teddy first night and i don't
[46:23] want to crowd the night up for whatever
[46:25] we might have going on so
[46:28] [Music]
[46:30] we should be the sunday after christmas
[46:32] we will definitely have communion
[46:36] and
[46:38] [Music]
[46:40] so let me
[46:42] uh send that out
[46:44] before i forget you
[46:47] but it's uh it's it's kind of a good
[46:50] it's good to
[46:53] to serve the lord jesus in the time that
[46:56] we are living in
[46:57] with everything that is that the word is
[46:59] happening that is happening around the
[47:01] world
[47:02] and uh
[47:04] the different
[47:06] faces and variants of kovic that is
[47:09] coming you know i was just
[47:12] just talking that all the time you know
[47:13] it was just just like it was in egypt
[47:16] there was one plague after another
[47:19] praise the lord
[47:20] you know brother brandon 1956 he said we
[47:23] were we were we were hitting troubling
[47:25] waters
[47:26] you know and and and there were things
[47:28] that was going to hit the earth
[47:31] uh uh you know
[47:33] [Music]
[47:34] the doctors will now find keto
[47:37] and we realized that these things are
[47:40] unfolding in the time that we are living
[47:43] but what a privileged people we are
[47:46] to have been told by a prophet
[47:49] praise the lord that's the privilege
[47:51] that we have that's the benefit that we
[47:53] have
[47:54] you know when when when you are warned
[47:57] then you know uh it it erase the fear
[48:01] it takes away the fear you don't have to
[48:03] be afraid
[48:04] because you have already been told that
[48:07] this will happen and you've been told
[48:09] how to prepare yourself you know just
[48:12] like jesus warning his disciple he that
[48:14] is on the hill let him not come down on
[48:17] the housetop don't come down in the
[48:19] field you just stayed there because
[48:21] there were horrible things that was
[48:22] going to be for jerusalem at that time
[48:25] you know so uh
[48:29] you know like the nigerians who said no
[48:31] shaking we are right here no shaking
[48:34] come what may
[48:36] praise the lord the church of the living
[48:38] god is moving on
[48:40] amen and our direction is upward to the
[48:44] rapture
[48:45] amen
[48:46] that's our direction so
[48:48] we just
[48:49] i want to comfort ourselves we want to
[48:52] encourage ourselves
[48:54] you know we want to get away from
[48:57] you know all
[48:58] those childish things
[49:00] we want to now instead
[49:03] looking into the face of the one that we
[49:06] love
[49:07] we want to start beholding his face
[49:10] we want to start expressing our hearts
[49:12] to him amen not just talking from our
[49:16] lips but expressing our hearts the inner
[49:19] of our hearts
[49:21] praise the lord
[49:23] and all of those things
[49:25] you know i was just i was just looking
[49:27] at something this morning you remember
[49:30] before we left uh
[49:32] or just before
[49:34] uh
[49:35] we had a kind of a change
[49:38] around the church
[49:41] in the sense of
[49:44] home going to brother scouting all of
[49:46] that
[49:47] we were talking a little bit on the
[49:48] subject of of of teaching
[49:51] and uh
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] and i realized
[49:55] you know like brother branham said
[49:59] he said that uh
[50:01] the church was promised
[50:04] the letter rain and the former rain
[50:06] [Music]
[50:08] and one of those rain was scoring the
[50:11] the latter rain was the sowing rain
[50:14] and the former rain was the harvest rain
[50:18] praise the lord
[50:19] and the leather rain in another sense
[50:23] it was the calling rain
[50:25] [Music]
[50:27] amen
[50:29] praise the lord
[50:30] and uh or the former rain was the
[50:32] calling rain sorry i'm getting both of
[50:34] the mix of year and and the letter rain
[50:37] is the teaching rain
[50:40] and i feel in my heart that
[50:42] [Music]
[50:46] if there is ever the time that the
[50:48] church
[50:49] need to be taught is this time
[50:52] i was just reading that this morning
[50:54] or last night uh uh brother branham says
[50:57] he says that's a problem with
[50:58] pentecostal people he says uh
[51:01] uh we have not been taught
[51:04] you know we have all of this information
[51:06] that we call the message yes
[51:08] praise the lord
[51:10] but the reason why we're not rightly
[51:12] using it is because we have not been
[51:14] taught
[51:16] you know and i think
[51:18] that's that's one of the that's one of
[51:20] the things that the holy ghost is kind
[51:23] of for measuring on even in our
[51:25] individual lives
[51:27] he's majoring on
[51:29] getting us to be taught
[51:31] in the way that he's dealing with us
[51:34] personally
[51:35] on the church getting us to be taught of
[51:38] what he want to achieve
[51:40] in the body
[51:42] praise the lord
[51:43] and and and as soon as we understand
[51:46] that there will be no need for a right
[51:48] race there would be no need of comparing
[51:51] one with another there will be no need
[51:54] of all of these things that we have been
[51:56] seeing and happening so we pray that the
[51:59] lord will help us amen
[52:02] we pray that the lord will help us
[52:05] amen
[52:08] praise the lord

[59:56] we were learning the song on sun on
[59:58] wednesday night so
[1:00:00] please remind me on wednesday so we can
[1:00:03] we can make another practice again
[1:00:05] before
[1:00:06] we forget and it become a history
[1:00:11] let's go to ask chapter 2 this morning
[1:00:13] i wanna i wanna go back to what i spoke
[1:00:16] on wednesday night
[1:00:17] uh the redemption rob
[1:00:19] but this morning i i wanna
[1:00:24] i wanna
[1:00:26] entitle a redemption god's deliberate
[1:00:29] plan
[1:00:31] redemption it was a deliberate plan
[1:00:38] but let's read as chapter 2 this morning
[1:00:44] praise the lord
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:49] it's good to see each and every one of
[1:00:51] you good to see you jonathan
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:59] what
[1:01:00] a wonderful jesus we serve
[1:01:04] praise the lord
[1:01:06] what a wonderful jesus yourself
[1:01:19] let's ask chapter 2.
[1:01:27] let's uh let's read from verse 22.
[1:01:30] i want to read this
[1:01:32] repeated message brother branham said he
[1:01:34] was standing on a soapbox when he
[1:01:36] preached
[1:01:38] you know brother brandon he added i
[1:01:40] don't know where he took all of those
[1:01:41] things from he said peter just got
[1:01:43] himself a soapbox and stand on there
[1:01:46] begin to say yeah man of ezra
[1:01:49] hear these words
[1:01:52] jesus of nazareth a man a proof of god
[1:01:56] among you
[1:01:58] by miracles
[1:01:59] and wonders and sign
[1:02:02] which god did by him in the midst of you
[1:02:06] as ye yourself also
[1:02:09] known
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] nicodemus testified to that he said we
[1:02:13] know
[1:02:14] that no man can do this
[1:02:17] except god be with him so peter is
[1:02:19] saying that you people knew that you
[1:02:22] knew that you discussed it in your
[1:02:23] counsel
[1:02:25] that he was a man sent from god
[1:02:28] well verse 23 he said him
[1:02:31] being delivered
[1:02:33] by the determined
[1:02:35] counsel and full knowledge
[1:02:38] of god
[1:02:40] so peter is making us to understand
[1:02:44] that jesus was actually placed in the
[1:02:46] hands of the sahendra council
[1:02:49] by god determined counsel
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:57] let's follow the reading there now
[1:03:00] he said don't boss
[1:03:02] to think that you got a hold of him no
[1:03:05] him being delivered
[1:03:08] by the determined counsel
[1:03:11] and full knowledge of god
[1:03:15] yeah have taken
[1:03:18] and by wicked hands
[1:03:20] have crucified
[1:03:22] and slain
[1:03:24] so in one sense
[1:03:28] he's saying god by god determined
[1:03:30] counsel
[1:03:32] he delivered him
[1:03:34] and then you by wicked hands
[1:03:37] you took him
[1:03:43] oh praise the lord
[1:03:46] whom god have raised up having
[1:03:50] lose the uh
[1:03:52] the pains of death because
[1:03:55] it was now possible
[1:03:58] right that he should be in holding of
[1:04:00] faith for david speaking concerning him
[1:04:07] i foresaw the lord always before my face
[1:04:11] for he is on my right hand
[1:04:14] that i should not be moved
[1:04:17] therefore
[1:04:19] did my heart rejoice and my tongue
[1:04:22] was glide
[1:04:24] moreover
[1:04:26] also my flesh
[1:04:27] shall rest him hope because thou will
[1:04:30] not leave
[1:04:31] my sword in hell
[1:04:33] neither will thou suffer that holy one
[1:04:36] to see corruption
[1:04:38] now as we as we spoke on this before
[1:04:42] just to just to bring you back to that
[1:04:44] and uh for us to realize here that david
[1:04:47] year was speaking
[1:04:50] in the first person
[1:04:54] you see the entire mystery of the
[1:04:56] godhead
[1:04:57] is the mystery of the first person
[1:05:00] that is revealed in the second
[1:05:03] and the day
[1:05:06] so if we don't understand the mystery of
[1:05:08] the first person there is no way you
[1:05:10] will understand the godhead
[1:05:13] because there are many places in the
[1:05:14] bible where the prophets of all
[1:05:17] spoke
[1:05:18] in the first person
[1:05:22] so david year is speaking in the first
[1:05:25] person i saw my lord always before my
[1:05:27] face
[1:05:29] and i shall not be moved
[1:05:31] my heart shall rejoice my tongue shall
[1:05:33] be glad my flesh shall rest in hope
[1:05:36] for he will not leave
[1:05:38] my soul in hell
[1:05:44] david was speaking as he was speaking of
[1:05:47] himself
[1:05:48] but actually it was christ in david
[1:05:51] let's buy our house together
[1:05:53] we'll talk a little bit on there before
[1:05:54] we get into our thoughts this morning
[1:05:56] heavenly father
[1:05:57] in the name of the lord jesus we want to
[1:05:59] ask your blessings
[1:06:01] upon your word thank you for the spirit
[1:06:04] of worship
[1:06:05] as we continue to ask that you pour such
[1:06:08] a spirit in our midst lord father
[1:06:10] because we know
[1:06:12] it prepares the hearts it prepares the
[1:06:14] minds of the people it takes away stress
[1:06:17] and worry lordy give us an entrance into
[1:06:20] your presence so lord i pray that father
[1:06:23] in the name of jesus christ this morning
[1:06:26] if there is one that have not
[1:06:28] breakthrough this morning lord to be
[1:06:31] fully surrounded and on the expectation
[1:06:34] to receive from you only you can pull us
[1:06:37] through we ask the lord you get ahold of
[1:06:39] us this morning father may there be
[1:06:41] nothing oh god father to create a
[1:06:44] hindrance or distraction lord we want to
[1:06:47] receive from you take your word break it
[1:06:50] to our hearts this morning speak to us
[1:06:52] in a way our soul
[1:06:54] will understand
[1:06:56] and our heart will rejoice
[1:06:58] bless us now in jesus name we pray amen
[1:07:01] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:07:03] seat and while you you take your sita uh
[1:07:07] we will
[1:07:08] we will look at uh
[1:07:11] uh
[1:07:12] we will look at
[1:07:14] some few uh
[1:07:17] chapters in the bible
[1:07:19] and let's look at psalm chapter 16
[1:07:23] psalm chapter 16.
[1:07:28] because i've been i've been kind of a
[1:07:30] dwelling on this mystery of the first
[1:07:32] person
[1:07:34] and uh
[1:07:37] because
[1:07:38] there are many things that have that
[1:07:40] have
[1:07:40] created you know uh
[1:07:43] uh
[1:07:44] doctrines
[1:07:45] that should not create doctrines
[1:07:48] you know uh brother brahms says i'll
[1:07:50] rather straight again it created a
[1:07:52] return ministry doctrine but it should
[1:07:54] not if you understand the mystery of the
[1:07:57] first person you will not you will not
[1:07:59] uh you know you will not be expecting
[1:08:01] brother branham you'll be expecting the
[1:08:02] holy spirit that rolled through that
[1:08:04] ministry to come back again and ride on
[1:08:07] his bride he was just only speaking in
[1:08:09] the first person not meaning him william
[1:08:11] branham but speaking just like david
[1:08:13] spoke let's look a few of that in and uh
[1:08:17] and and just trust that lord hepa psalm
[1:08:20] chapter 16 verse 10.
[1:08:31] david
[1:08:39] said they
[1:08:41] they are enclosed
[1:08:44] in their own thoughts with their mouth
[1:08:46] they speak proudly
[1:08:49] they have now come
[1:08:51] oh i'm reading something different
[1:08:55] oh yeah
[1:08:58] supposed to be reading 16
[1:09:00] reading in 17.
[1:09:03] i think that's what we just read
[1:09:09] verse 8.
[1:09:12] i have set the lord always before me
[1:09:15] because he is at my right hand this is
[1:09:18] david talking
[1:09:21] many years before peter will pick that
[1:09:24] in the book of arts
[1:09:26] and say when david spoke he was speaking
[1:09:29] that was the spirit of christ
[1:09:33] but those that were standing around
[1:09:35] david in david's church
[1:09:37] will think that david was talking about
[1:09:39] himself
[1:09:46] praise the lord they would think that
[1:09:48] david was talking about himself that's
[1:09:51] that's the whole thing about the godhead
[1:09:54] that's what make the godhead so
[1:09:55] complicated uh uh like like uh like uh
[1:09:59] paul would say great is the mystery of
[1:10:01] godliness
[1:10:03] it's so complicated to the complicated
[1:10:06] mind to the people that want to
[1:10:08] overthink it
[1:10:10] amen
[1:10:14] are we together
[1:10:18] therefore my heart is gliding and and my
[1:10:22] glory rejoice
[1:10:24] my flesh shall rest in hope for that i
[1:10:26] will not leave my soul in hell anybody's
[1:10:29] anybody around david you know there was
[1:10:32] nobody there that heard him saying this
[1:10:35] that would think that it was christ they
[1:10:36] did not know about it
[1:10:42] what a privileged people we are
[1:10:45] america
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:49] psalm chapter 89
[1:10:52] the same thing over here in psalm
[1:10:53] chapter 17 you read you just hear a
[1:10:55] bunch of uh
[1:10:59] voices of
[1:11:12] psalm chapter 89 let's let's take
[1:11:15] let's take uh
[1:11:17] uh
[1:11:21] and then i will show you something again
[1:11:23] psalm chapter 89 verse 27
[1:11:27] david cried out here all the psalmist
[1:11:28] said let me let me say that
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:41] also i will make him my firstborn
[1:11:45] higher than the kings of the earth
[1:11:49] praise the lord
[1:11:50] you go over image in john chapter 3 you
[1:11:53] will see where that psalm is fulfilled
[1:11:56] you know
[1:11:58] in st john chapter 3
[1:12:01] that's that's where the fulfillment of
[1:12:03] that is but look at one of the the most
[1:12:06] common one that might help us here for
[1:12:08] us to go this is not actually what i'm
[1:12:10] preaching on i just got caught in it
[1:12:12] because of that we read in that's
[1:12:14] chapter two but look at first samuel
[1:12:16] chapter 10
[1:12:18] look out for samuel
[1:12:20] chapter 10
[1:12:23] first samuel chapter 10
[1:12:26] praise the lord first time in chapter 10
[1:12:28] verse 8
[1:12:34] i think
[1:12:40] the
[1:12:44] the technicians back there can help us
[1:12:46] faster than i can get to it
[1:12:48] but
[1:12:49] chapter 10 verse 8 is that what i said
[1:12:52] yes i said
[1:13:01] david said and thou shalt go down
[1:13:04] no this was samuel
[1:13:06] talking to saul
[1:13:09] and thou shalt go down before me to give
[1:13:11] god and behold i will come down on today
[1:13:15] to offer burnt offering and to sacrifice
[1:13:18] sacrifices of peace offering
[1:13:20] seven days shall doubt harry till i come
[1:13:24] today
[1:13:25] and show them
[1:13:26] what
[1:13:27] thou
[1:13:28] shalt do
[1:13:31] samir is giving saul an instruction
[1:13:35] but look at chapter 13
[1:13:39] look at chapter 13.
[1:13:44] let's look at chapter 13.
[1:13:49] chapter 13 verse 13.
[1:13:53] you know the story samuel gives i
[1:13:56] saw this instruction saw god there he
[1:13:59] started doing his own thing
[1:14:02] and then when samuel came verse 13 the
[1:14:04] bible says and samuel said unto saul
[1:14:08] thou has done foolishly
[1:14:11] thou
[1:14:11] have not kept the commandments of the
[1:14:14] lord thy god
[1:14:16] now saul could have a serious argument
[1:14:20] with samuel
[1:14:22] and said when you told me down there you
[1:14:23] never said the law said
[1:14:29] praise the lord
[1:14:31] when you told me back there to come you
[1:14:34] never said the lord said you said i
[1:14:36] should do this thing like like you
[1:14:38] command me
[1:14:40] but here
[1:14:41] samuel is saying
[1:14:43] you did foolishly because you never heed
[1:14:45] it to the commandments of the lord so
[1:14:47] what was happening when samuel was
[1:14:50] instructing saul
[1:14:54] he was speaking in the first person
[1:15:01] and saul just took it casually like okay
[1:15:03] okay i'm just listening to you
[1:15:07] he said you have not kept the
[1:15:09] commandments of the law thy god which he
[1:15:12] have commanded
[1:15:13] thee
[1:15:15] for now
[1:15:17] will the lord have established that
[1:15:20] kingdom
[1:15:21] upon israel forever
[1:15:23] what saul talk
[1:15:26] simple and common
[1:15:30] rip the kingdom from honor him
[1:15:35] why because he never honest to the
[1:15:37] mystery of the first person
[1:15:43] that's what people are going into
[1:15:45] idolatry that's why people are stumbling
[1:15:47] and say brother branham said this
[1:15:49] because they never understood the
[1:15:50] mystery of the first person
[1:15:55] this ministry was now william branham
[1:15:57] ministry it was the ministry of their
[1:15:59] son of man
[1:16:01] that was revealed in this generation
[1:16:12] let me read something to you
[1:16:20] and uh
[1:16:24] i got my i want to talk about redemption
[1:16:26] a little bit here
[1:16:28] but let me read something to you brother
[1:16:29] graham says peffect i i don't have it
[1:16:32] down there though as sister fate it's
[1:16:34] not part of my notes i'm reading from
[1:16:36] from another notes
[1:16:38] i'm reading from a little bit of
[1:16:40] something i preached last week while i
[1:16:42] was away
[1:16:43] he says the great physician this is from
[1:16:45] perfect faith who is here these sons
[1:16:48] shall follow them that believe if
[1:16:51] they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:16:53] shall recover and if you say to this
[1:16:56] mountain be they are removed and don't
[1:16:58] doubt in your heart he says whatever you
[1:17:00] ask
[1:17:03] and don't doubt in your heart but can
[1:17:05] believe that he can create score he says
[1:17:09] who has no way at all of or nothing
[1:17:14] there to believe way
[1:17:16] it's my faith
[1:17:18] that goes and does that my faith
[1:17:22] in what
[1:17:24] he challenged me to ask
[1:17:27] you know
[1:17:29] now brother branham comes down here he's
[1:17:31] he's building the fate of the people he
[1:17:33] says
[1:17:34] he says i'm your brother
[1:17:37] standing as your brother
[1:17:41] an intercessor
[1:17:43] trying my best
[1:17:45] to hold you before god
[1:17:48] i'm standing here right before the white
[1:17:51] throne now
[1:17:55] he's in
[1:17:56] jeffersonville and he says i'm standing
[1:17:59] here
[1:18:00] right before the white truth now
[1:18:10] praise the lord
[1:18:11] do you see how a statement like that can
[1:18:14] make people to go wide
[1:18:16] oh my goodness he was before the white
[1:18:19] room judgment
[1:18:22] if you understand the mystery of the
[1:18:24] first person or you understand
[1:18:26] representation
[1:18:29] by predestination or by condemnation
[1:18:33] you will know that
[1:18:34] god just like the wave sheep that he
[1:18:37] weighed before the congregation thou
[1:18:39] won't she represent the rest of the
[1:18:41] field
[1:18:42] the rest of the crop that is in the
[1:18:44] field
[1:18:45] praise the lord god has always worked
[1:18:48] with representation brother branham says
[1:18:50] he says i'm i'm your brother
[1:18:53] i'm uh
[1:18:54] standing as your brother and an
[1:18:56] intercessor trying my best to hold the
[1:18:58] people before god i'm standing right
[1:19:00] before the white throne now
[1:19:03] pointing my finger at that bloody
[1:19:06] sacrifice did
[1:19:07] and speaking through his name
[1:19:10] that it is done
[1:19:13] praise the lord
[1:19:22] so it's impressive he said another one
[1:19:24] talking about the same
[1:19:26] ministry of intercession
[1:19:30] he says
[1:19:31] there's
[1:19:33] there will be a lot of a lot of
[1:19:35] impersonation
[1:19:36] he said here come the lamb
[1:19:38] that was slain
[1:19:40] come back to make intercession watch him
[1:19:44] there will be a lot of impersonation a
[1:19:46] lot of everything else but there was
[1:19:48] really somebody was going to be saved
[1:19:52] the church was predestinated without
[1:19:54] spot or wrinkle she's going to be there
[1:19:57] and the lamb died the lamb died for that
[1:20:00] purpose that's what i'm going to do on
[1:20:02] this morning and then when
[1:20:05] when
[1:20:07] the last name
[1:20:09] on the book
[1:20:11] was redeemed listen to this now when the
[1:20:14] last name on the book was redeemed he
[1:20:17] said the lamb came forth and took the
[1:20:20] book
[1:20:22] i'm the one that did it
[1:20:29] praise the lord
[1:20:31] oh my goodness he's the lamb
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:38] he said i'm the one that did it
[1:20:41] oh my goodness he's the lamb
[1:20:44] tracey's birth
[1:20:49] go and get his birth certificate
[1:20:51] he was not virgin born
[1:20:58] so what is that ministry doing
[1:21:01] speaking
[1:21:02] in the first person
[1:21:08] that's all he was doing
[1:21:10] he was not making himself god
[1:21:12] he was not making himself the lamb
[1:21:16] he was only speaking
[1:21:18] in the first person
[1:21:25] are we together
[1:21:34] now so this morning we want to talk let
[1:21:36] me go to my subject because it looks
[1:21:38] like i'm
[1:21:39] i'm getting on the trail yet amen
[1:21:46] and i see all you message people just
[1:21:49] just looking at me
[1:21:53] praise the lord
[1:21:54] thank god there's a door here i can get
[1:21:56] out
[1:22:05] amen not this winter cold money though
[1:22:13] well uh
[1:22:14] wednesday night we were talking on the
[1:22:16] redemptive rock where we
[1:22:18] we we talked the subject from uh
[1:22:21] uh
[1:22:22] first timothy chapter two adam was not
[1:22:25] deceived
[1:22:27] so that's why we were talking on
[1:22:28] wednesday night and brother branham
[1:22:30] called that the redemptive rob so uh
[1:22:33] we we treated that called their position
[1:22:37] of the believer in christ but let's read
[1:22:39] uh
[1:22:41] our first
[1:22:44] first timothy
[1:22:45] chapter
[1:22:47] two like we did wednesday night
[1:22:50] and uh
[1:22:52] first two minute chapter two
[1:22:58] you see people
[1:23:00] what i'm trying to do when i when i kind
[1:23:02] of throw some of these things out
[1:23:04] is the other
[1:23:06] you know uh
[1:23:07] sometimes people say well we don't
[1:23:09] really know his position my position is
[1:23:11] in christ
[1:23:12] in a way
[1:23:17] and uh
[1:23:28] you know while uh esther and all of
[1:23:30] those all of those virgin girls that
[1:23:33] were going to be wife to the king
[1:23:37] there in the time of esther
[1:23:39] there was a reason why each one of them
[1:23:41] was giving chamberlains to take care of
[1:23:43] them
[1:23:45] is because
[1:23:47] there there's a certain time to go
[1:23:48] before the king there's a setting close
[1:23:50] to where there is a certain way to walk
[1:23:53] uh uh i mean now because
[1:23:55] uh the king wanted a bride and and they
[1:23:58] were virgins so i mean they could just
[1:24:00] come in and and do and no they were
[1:24:03] giving chamberlain so they could be
[1:24:05] taught
[1:24:07] praise the lord
[1:24:08] they could be taught
[1:24:10] how to walk before the king
[1:24:13] how to dress and and the things to do
[1:24:15] they could be taught a little bit of
[1:24:16] royalty
[1:24:18] and i believe that's what the holy
[1:24:20] spirit is doing for us
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] praise the lord
[1:24:24] he's uh
[1:24:26] he's he's trying to teach us royalty
[1:24:29] how to approach this holy god
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:37] and i saw we we read here the first time
[1:24:40] to chapter 2
[1:24:42] for adam
[1:24:45] was first formed
[1:24:46] than eve
[1:24:50] and adam was not deceived
[1:24:52] but the woman being deceived was in the
[1:24:54] transgression
[1:24:56] praise the lord
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:02] now we know adam was first formed in eve
[1:25:06] you realize that this
[1:25:08] talks about genesis 2 7 and not genesis
[1:25:12] 1 26
[1:25:13] because it's in genesis 2 7 that man was
[1:25:16] formed
[1:25:17] from the dust of the earth
[1:25:20] so what paul was dealing with here is
[1:25:23] chronological order
[1:25:26] are we together
[1:25:29] paul was dealing with chronological
[1:25:31] order paul was not dealing with uh
[1:25:34] rulership
[1:25:36] and leadership
[1:25:39] no
[1:25:40] he was dealing with
[1:25:42] the order that god brought
[1:25:45] eve adam and eve
[1:25:50] because we all know in genesis 1 26 both
[1:25:53] of them was represented
[1:25:59] are we together
[1:26:04] and adam was not deceived by the woman
[1:26:07] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:26:10] now so we read here the uh on wednesday
[1:26:13] night position
[1:26:14] in uh
[1:26:17] of the believer in christ
[1:26:19] let me check
[1:26:20] something here
[1:26:24] okay
[1:26:29] i'm only checking to make sure that i
[1:26:31] throw my notes back there adam adam
[1:26:34] he says adam sinned it and and and
[1:26:36] condemned and was driving
[1:26:38] you know from the garden of eden
[1:26:41] see the redemptive robe over him show
[1:26:44] that
[1:26:44] well
[1:26:45] what i said
[1:26:47] that adam seen willfully
[1:26:51] praise the lord
[1:26:53] amen and then wednesday night we read
[1:26:56] also from
[1:26:57] hebrew he that sin wayfalling
[1:27:04] he that sin wayfully that's why hebrews
[1:27:07] said that's what paul said
[1:27:12] after knowing the knowledge of the truth
[1:27:14] there remained no more sacrifice
[1:27:17] and brother branham is saying adam
[1:27:19] seemed wavefully
[1:27:22] but eve was deceived
[1:27:26] so which one of them deserve the mercy
[1:27:28] of god
[1:27:31] it's the one that was deceived
[1:27:35] when it comes to justice
[1:27:38] the man that did it willfully must be
[1:27:41] condemned
[1:27:50] are we together
[1:27:54] adam seemed wavefully see
[1:27:57] eve was actually deceived but adam was
[1:28:01] not deceived
[1:28:03] he deliberately
[1:28:07] he deliberately
[1:28:10] so this morning i want to show i want to
[1:28:12] speak on redemption god deliberate plan
[1:28:17] redemption was a deliberate plan of god
[1:28:21] [Laughter]
[1:28:24] god
[1:28:25] was deliberate
[1:28:28] in putting you in the family that he
[1:28:30] puts you in
[1:28:31] he was deliberate in bringing you at the
[1:28:34] time that he brought you
[1:28:36] praise the lord
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:39] what do you want your name to be jones
[1:28:41] or what
[1:28:42] god was deliberate
[1:28:45] very deliberate to give you your height
[1:28:49] he was so much deliberate
[1:28:52] that he count the number of hair on your
[1:28:54] head
[1:28:56] praise the lord
[1:28:57] if mine is more than yours is because he
[1:28:59] gave me the big head
[1:29:02] and he had to fill it up
[1:29:05] glory to god thank you jesus
[1:29:09] i love you
[1:29:10] for the big head
[1:29:15] he was deliberate
[1:29:17] praise the lord he was very deliberate
[1:29:21] when he thought of what gender to make
[1:29:23] you he was deliberate
[1:29:26] that's the reason why he did not ask
[1:29:29] your contribution
[1:29:31] he did not seek counsel from anybody
[1:29:34] because he was very deliberate
[1:29:42] his determined counsel
[1:29:45] that's the way the apostle peter said
[1:29:48] by his determined counsel
[1:29:51] he brought us coronavirus
[1:29:58] he allowed coronavirus by his determined
[1:30:01] council
[1:30:07] redemption
[1:30:09] is god's deliberate plan
[1:30:16] praise the lord
[1:30:17] are you ready for me this morning
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:23] are you ready
[1:30:24] adam was now deceived he deliberately
[1:30:27] sinned
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:31] deliberately ignoring what he was doing
[1:30:36] because of his wife
[1:30:40] he took position with his wife
[1:30:46] praise the lord
[1:30:51] he was deliberate he took position with
[1:30:55] his wife
[1:30:57] my goodness
[1:31:00] my my my mind
[1:31:04] praise the lord
[1:31:06] are we together
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:09] he says then
[1:31:10] they went before god and both of them
[1:31:12] were condemned and jesus
[1:31:14] not ignorant of what was
[1:31:18] he not not ignorant
[1:31:20] of what he was doing
[1:31:22] came down and took his place with the
[1:31:26] sinner the church
[1:31:28] that he might redeem the church back to
[1:31:31] himself
[1:31:35] praise the lord
[1:31:36] that he might redeem the church
[1:31:40] he was not ignorant of what he was doing
[1:31:42] so it's it's it's pretty much that
[1:31:45] what god allowed in the life of adam was
[1:31:50] just a type it was to give us a preview
[1:31:53] of what the second adam would do
[1:32:00] are we together
[1:32:12] oh thank god for for a prophet
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:17] that can be able to help us and bring
[1:32:19] bring these things because i mean uh uh
[1:32:22] we read it right there in the bible the
[1:32:24] bible says eve was deceived
[1:32:26] but yeah we get so mad with her
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:32] and people would preach messages and and
[1:32:34] and and talk about eve and talk about
[1:32:37] woman and you know they were just
[1:32:39] use their statement she was deceived she
[1:32:42] quit to be deceiving and just knock her
[1:32:44] down to the ground
[1:32:48] praise the lord
[1:32:50] and not realizing that when we do that
[1:32:53] we're not even leaving any hope for
[1:32:55] ourselves
[1:32:56] because we are in the representation of
[1:32:58] eve
[1:32:59] you being a man you are not adam when it
[1:33:01] comes to this
[1:33:15] just like the preacher that says
[1:33:17] no illegitimate children will go to
[1:33:19] heaven
[1:33:20] i wonder how i would make it
[1:33:25] he said he wonder how he would make it
[1:33:28] because he's born illegitimate
[1:33:30] if you don't believe you'll go to heaven
[1:33:32] why are you preaching
[1:33:42] can be more righteous than the lord of
[1:33:44] god
[1:33:46] no
[1:33:48] you can be are we together
[1:33:51] he says but adam did sin but he did it
[1:33:54] with his eyes while open
[1:33:58] intimidating that adam was not
[1:34:01] the adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:34:04] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:34:07] see eve actually taught
[1:34:10] she was right she actually thought
[1:34:13] she was she was arguing with the serpent
[1:34:17] god i mean when the serpent told her the
[1:34:19] first thing she refused no god said we
[1:34:21] should know
[1:34:25] he only got into that channel of
[1:34:27] reasoning with her
[1:34:31] amen
[1:34:32] and make her to oh wow i never saw it
[1:34:35] like that
[1:34:38] no but he could not do it to adam
[1:34:42] praise the lord amen
[1:34:45] are we together
[1:34:47] now so
[1:34:49] he says here
[1:34:51] she actually thought she was right but
[1:34:53] sit on deceive her
[1:34:55] but he didn't deceive adam he knew it
[1:34:58] was wrong but because of the love for
[1:35:02] his wife
[1:35:03] praise the lord
[1:35:05] can't you see yourself in that
[1:35:08] for god so love the word can't you see
[1:35:11] it
[1:35:23] and christ represented himself with his
[1:35:25] church
[1:35:27] full of sin and was condemned
[1:35:30] and his soul went to hell
[1:35:33] that's right
[1:35:35] and god raised him up on the third day
[1:35:37] you believe that
[1:35:39] it wasn't that he
[1:35:42] he
[1:35:45] it wasn't dead
[1:35:47] he didn't sin he did
[1:35:49] god wouldn't have sent him
[1:35:53] to help heal he had to send him
[1:35:56] to hell condemned because he took our
[1:36:00] sins
[1:36:03] and christ did
[1:36:04] not righteous he died as sinner
[1:36:08] see christ never seen himself but he
[1:36:11] took our sin upon him
[1:36:14] praise the lord
[1:36:16] and we and we spoke a little bit about
[1:36:18] the
[1:36:19] the
[1:36:21] the scapegoat the two goats amen
[1:36:26] are we together
[1:36:28] praise the lord
[1:36:30] so as as we look at this
[1:36:32] we realize the other
[1:36:36] god
[1:36:39] play our redemption
[1:36:42] praise the lord
[1:36:44] he played our redemption right from the
[1:36:46] beginning
[1:36:47] even in the first chapter
[1:36:52] of the bible
[1:36:53] redemption is played out all through the
[1:36:56] scripture
[1:36:57] god was sounding out
[1:37:00] this plan of redemption because we have
[1:37:02] to realize
[1:37:04] that was god's major purpose of time
[1:37:10] the reason why the internal god
[1:37:14] the self-existent god
[1:37:17] will leave that state of being
[1:37:20] self-existent internal spirit
[1:37:23] to create something was all because he
[1:37:27] had
[1:37:28] a plan in his mind that's why brother
[1:37:31] branham called his one goal
[1:37:35] praise the lord
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:49] you know when i read crisis the mystery
[1:37:51] of god revealed many years back
[1:37:55] it's uh it's funny sometimes the way
[1:37:57] your mind runs on things and whether is
[1:38:00] the law that help you to understand
[1:38:02] things like that or whether you know it
[1:38:05] is the way you are but now one of the
[1:38:07] reason that is because you know i i used
[1:38:09] to love soccer and as they do
[1:38:12] and uh uh
[1:38:15] so reading crisis the mystery of god
[1:38:17] reveal and yerin brother branham talking
[1:38:20] about
[1:38:20] uh god having one goal
[1:38:24] all that runs to my mind is that when
[1:38:26] you play in the soccer game
[1:38:28] and you defeat the opponent one goal oh
[1:38:32] my goodness nothing hurts
[1:38:35] then winning one god
[1:38:39] you know because it's a game that is so
[1:38:41] tight yes
[1:38:43] but for you to just scroll one goal and
[1:38:45] it can redeem oh my goodness
[1:38:48] i mean that's all you surround to my
[1:38:50] mind you know as a young man reading the
[1:38:52] the message so i had in the back of my
[1:38:55] mind that we had one god against the
[1:38:57] enemy that he would never be able to
[1:38:59] redeem
[1:39:00] and we would come on the other side as
[1:39:02] the winning team
[1:39:04] but that was god's one god god's one
[1:39:07] purpose
[1:39:09] it was an internal purpose
[1:39:13] that plan of redemption
[1:39:16] the reason why there is a creation is
[1:39:19] because of redemption
[1:39:23] that's that's all god wanted to achieve
[1:39:27] because redemption allowed god to
[1:39:30] manifest his attributes
[1:39:33] that's the reason why it was called the
[1:39:35] seven redemptive names
[1:39:38] redemption is it's all it's all that i
[1:39:40] mean that's that's that's the whole
[1:39:42] story
[1:39:43] that's that's a story about salvation
[1:39:47] that's the reason why a five-fold
[1:39:48] ministry was giving
[1:39:51] when jesus says i would build my church
[1:39:53] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:39:55] against it it was not because of having
[1:39:58] meager church the plan was because of
[1:40:01] the plan of redemption
[1:40:04] that's god's one goal god's one purpose
[1:40:10] that's the reason why
[1:40:12] as children of god we we must get there
[1:40:15] at the back of our mind when we're
[1:40:17] dealing with ourselves and we are
[1:40:19] dealing with others
[1:40:21] don't deal with them because oh i'm
[1:40:23] angry at them
[1:40:26] redemption must be the thing that is
[1:40:28] driving us
[1:40:38] that's god's only purpose
[1:40:40] for time
[1:40:43] the only reason why what the great
[1:40:45] internal spirit will condescend
[1:40:48] condition break
[1:40:51] down
[1:40:52] to become an element
[1:40:56] it's all because of redemption
[1:41:01] praise the lord
[1:41:05] and god was deliberate
[1:41:10] with that plan he was deliberate
[1:41:14] he was deliberate in making known his
[1:41:17] attributes
[1:41:20] and one of the way he could do it was
[1:41:23] to be able to form his own enemy
[1:41:29] praise the lord
[1:41:31] and in our side the bible says
[1:41:34] lucifer was made perfect
[1:41:40] god made him perfection that's what
[1:41:42] that's that's the way the bible says he
[1:41:44] was made imperfection so he he god made
[1:41:48] a perfect enemy the only one that could
[1:41:51] that could be able to bring
[1:41:54] out his attribute you see that's that's
[1:41:56] what happened when a person is
[1:41:59] determined
[1:42:01] when a man or a woman is determined that
[1:42:04] i will do this
[1:42:08] you don't become determined and allow
[1:42:10] people to to facilitate you with what
[1:42:13] you need
[1:42:15] you're just bragging
[1:42:17] when you say i would do it
[1:42:19] just see i would do it and you're not
[1:42:21] doing anything about it
[1:42:23] you are just bragging when the person is
[1:42:26] determined you get to work
[1:42:29] i would do it you start bringing things
[1:42:30] together i said i would do this thing
[1:42:32] you start bringing things together then
[1:42:34] you are determined
[1:42:39] if you're just telling us i will do it
[1:42:41] and we can't see anything we know you're
[1:42:43] just bluffing
[1:42:45] it's just it just it's just uh uh some
[1:42:49] fancy word but god was determined
[1:42:52] and because he was determined
[1:42:55] he left his internal glory
[1:42:59] he left the state of being self-existent
[1:43:02] he broke himself down
[1:43:05] and condescended
[1:43:08] to become the logos he reduced himself
[1:43:12] to become tangible
[1:43:16] and then he created his own adversary
[1:43:21] i will make you so perfect that you will
[1:43:23] not miss one's part of your job
[1:43:28] you see that's the reason why we are not
[1:43:29] creating perfection our perfection is
[1:43:32] not to do everything right
[1:43:35] our perfection comes back to the world
[1:43:37] but satan's perfection he was made that
[1:43:40] way he will he's perfect in lying
[1:43:43] perfect in deceiving that
[1:43:45] he's perfect
[1:43:47] in everything that is evil
[1:43:52] because god is a perfect god he had to
[1:43:55] make a perfect enemy
[1:43:57] [Laughter]
[1:43:59] that's a determined god
[1:44:02] praise the lord
[1:44:03] well you see he never makes satan in a
[1:44:06] way
[1:44:07] when
[1:44:08] satan would try and says no
[1:44:11] i'm tired
[1:44:13] i'm tired no i'm tired
[1:44:16] no
[1:44:18] you know he put an element in the devil
[1:44:21] that the devil is never tired
[1:44:23] let's stay the whole day let rebuke him
[1:44:26] let's breathe
[1:44:27] as now you step outside he's waiting for
[1:44:29] you
[1:44:31] that one element he gave the devil he's
[1:44:34] never tired
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:43] oh my goodness
[1:44:45] automatic god we self praise the lord
[1:44:49] but of adam says greatness is not seen
[1:44:52] in outward appearance
[1:44:55] he said when you see great men
[1:44:58] are the man that brings himself down to
[1:45:00] your level
[1:45:04] praise the lord
[1:45:07] i was reading
[1:45:09] a story offer
[1:45:11] of a veteran that fought
[1:45:13] in one of the wars
[1:45:18] he was one of the survivors
[1:45:21] fell down from the parachute
[1:45:23] the god captured and all of that
[1:45:27] and then
[1:45:29] after he got released and came back
[1:45:32] lost all his body
[1:45:35] he went to the academy
[1:45:37] i think it was the navy academy
[1:45:40] and he applied as a civilian
[1:45:42] to be a journalist
[1:45:46] and he was a journey to cleaning the
[1:45:47] bathroom and cleaning every word
[1:45:50] but
[1:45:52] uh
[1:45:54] i think he did it to kind of for
[1:45:57] you know uh
[1:45:58] ease his mind
[1:46:01] to stay get the feeling of the military
[1:46:05] but every time the the the
[1:46:07] the young soldiers will want to talk to
[1:46:09] him he would just greet them
[1:46:11] he would not want to get in conversation
[1:46:13] with him
[1:46:14] so there were some boys that decided to
[1:46:16] say well we need to check on this guy
[1:46:19] so one of the boys went
[1:46:21] and made some research
[1:46:26] just by his name
[1:46:28] and find out that this was a veteran
[1:46:32] this was a man that survived a war
[1:46:38] that don't need to be a janitor
[1:46:42] he need to be honored why are we having
[1:46:45] him as a janitor when we are all young
[1:46:48] soldiers just running around we have
[1:46:49] never faced any battle this man survived
[1:46:52] a war he survived prison
[1:47:00] so they got their group together they
[1:47:02] make
[1:47:03] they make a plea and something like that
[1:47:05] that was during the time of reagan
[1:47:08] so i think it was uh either a veteran
[1:47:11] day amphorce is the one of those ones
[1:47:13] and uh uh
[1:47:15] and and president reagan decided to
[1:47:18] celebrate it on that camp
[1:47:21] to honor this man
[1:47:24] that have worked there for many years
[1:47:27] and all of these young people
[1:47:30] they will come from the bathroom and you
[1:47:32] know master place of wastewater hey come
[1:47:34] and clean it
[1:47:44] he was honored that day he was decorated
[1:47:51] and can you imagine how many of those
[1:47:53] boys thought
[1:47:54] if they if they ever they spoke to him
[1:47:56] rudely
[1:48:01] what might have gone through their mind
[1:48:03] oh my god
[1:48:05] wow
[1:48:07] greatness is not in appearance
[1:48:16] greatness is in character
[1:48:26] that the creator of heaven and earth
[1:48:32] come down
[1:48:35] can't be seen
[1:48:39] praise the lord
[1:48:41] create a universe
[1:48:47] and step out of it
[1:48:52] and allow us to choose
[1:48:55] what we want to do
[1:48:59] he stepped out of faith
[1:49:02] and people says where is god if there is
[1:49:04] a god why all of these things are
[1:49:05] happening
[1:49:08] if he can t if he can create it which
[1:49:10] means he have it under control
[1:49:16] praise the lord
[1:49:17] he have it honor control
[1:49:20] he have a spare path for everything that
[1:49:23] he have created
[1:49:27] praise the lord
[1:49:32] and we can make choices
[1:49:34] and we can do what we want to do
[1:49:36] it's my life i can do whatever i want to
[1:49:38] do with faith
[1:49:43] and the creator will just sit there
[1:49:47] and look at you
[1:49:51] paul says they are worshiping the
[1:49:54] creatures
[1:49:56] than the creator
[1:49:58] praise the lord i've been studying the
[1:50:00] book of romans a little bit we've been
[1:50:01] reading the home but i've been
[1:50:02] personally studying it and i realize
[1:50:06] when i look into some of the account
[1:50:08] the book of romans is one of
[1:50:14] scala says one of the unique piece of
[1:50:18] literature
[1:50:20] the book of romans
[1:50:23] romans chapter 1 will tell you about the
[1:50:26] unconverted man called the pagan
[1:50:29] every unconverted man is pigging
[1:50:32] whether you were born in a message
[1:50:35] or you're born out of the message
[1:50:37] until you are converted
[1:50:39] you are a pagan
[1:50:42] praise the lord
[1:50:46] romans the way paul
[1:50:48] treated the book of romans
[1:50:51] man as i was studying through us is my
[1:50:54] goodness
[1:50:55] what a treasure
[1:50:59] then romans chapter 2
[1:51:01] bring us
[1:51:02] the moral man
[1:51:07] praise the lord
[1:51:09] and many times around the message we go
[1:51:11] through these stages
[1:51:13] we get saved
[1:51:15] and then we become more a people
[1:51:18] we get good morals that don't have
[1:51:20] nothing to do with salvation
[1:51:25] we just learn the dress code
[1:51:30] we learn the message called how to greet
[1:51:33] how much feet to stand away from a
[1:51:35] brother or from a sister
[1:51:41] praise the lord
[1:51:44] then romans chapter 3 talks about the
[1:51:46] religious man
[1:51:49] he's not saved yet
[1:51:54] he was a pagan
[1:51:56] he just moved to good morals he don't
[1:51:58] cost any more
[1:52:01] praise the lord
[1:52:04] and now he move over to being religious
[1:52:07] that's where that's when he's dangerous
[1:52:10] because he can go on the airstream
[1:52:12] anybody that don't believe that he cut
[1:52:14] them off
[1:52:15] you go into hell
[1:52:19] this message is not for everybody
[1:52:22] this message
[1:52:24] this message is hot
[1:52:27] it's hard and you save
[1:52:32] he's just a religious guy
[1:52:37] what am i preaching this morning people
[1:52:41] praise the lord
[1:52:42] where did i slept last night
[1:52:47] glory be to god
[1:52:50] i woke up this morning at five o'clock i
[1:52:52] thought it was 6 00 am
[1:52:55] and then it took me almost 30 minutes
[1:52:57] for me to realize that it's not 6 am so
[1:53:00] you can see where i woke up this morning
[1:53:05] oh praise the lord
[1:53:07] we are talking about god determine
[1:53:09] counsel
[1:53:12] young people if we don't understand
[1:53:14] these things we'll make a shipwreck of
[1:53:16] ourselves
[1:53:21] that's why many have packed their bibles
[1:53:24] and they're selling their message book
[1:53:25] on amazon
[1:53:29] because they have made a shipwreck of
[1:53:31] themself
[1:53:40] let's get back to subject here
[1:53:45] this plan of redemption
[1:53:49] you know what socrates said
[1:53:52] socrates one of the
[1:53:55] the greek wise men that live many
[1:53:57] centuries before christ
[1:53:59] he said
[1:54:03] he said
[1:54:06] i think to believe
[1:54:09] that deity
[1:54:10] can forgive
[1:54:12] but i don't know how
[1:54:17] his struggle is
[1:54:19] how can a holy god
[1:54:24] reconcile a sinful man
[1:54:27] how
[1:54:30] he was one of the wisest man in his
[1:54:33] generation
[1:54:34] but yet he could not see redemption
[1:54:38] because redemption comes by revelation
[1:54:41] god has to reveal it to you
[1:54:46] he says i think to believe
[1:54:49] deity can forgive but i don't know how
[1:54:56] praise the lord
[1:55:00] that was the thing that struck
[1:55:03] luther
[1:55:07] habakkuk 2 4
[1:55:10] that's where the prophet said the just
[1:55:12] shall live
[1:55:14] by faith
[1:55:17] praise the lord
[1:55:19] one of luther frank gave him that verse
[1:55:23] before he went to rome
[1:55:26] the first time
[1:55:28] praise the lord
[1:55:29] amen
[1:55:30] when he went to rome his first time
[1:55:35] you have to remember that
[1:55:37] he wanted to be become a lawyer
[1:55:41] because his his father had a shoe making
[1:55:43] shop
[1:55:45] and
[1:55:47] he never wanted to end up like his
[1:55:49] father
[1:55:51] so he went into steady
[1:55:54] but he had a friend that died
[1:55:58] and that troubled him
[1:56:01] of word
[1:56:03] when he spent eternity
[1:56:08] and because of that he he he changed
[1:56:10] course
[1:56:11] and he went to become a monk
[1:56:14] those were the people that dedicated
[1:56:16] himself
[1:56:17] those days to catholicism
[1:56:21] to get closer to god
[1:56:23] they walk they crawl on breaking
[1:56:26] a breaking bottles
[1:56:32] because the church taught them that you
[1:56:34] got to afflict yourself
[1:56:38] jesus suffer you got to suffer more than
[1:56:40] him
[1:56:44] and he did all of that but there was a
[1:56:47] constant struggle in him he realized
[1:56:49] that he could never never attain
[1:56:54] to the righteousness of god
[1:57:01] he tie ropes in his room he hang himself
[1:57:04] up
[1:57:04] for many nights
[1:57:07] hang himself up in the night until in
[1:57:08] the morning he just hang
[1:57:10] like that
[1:57:13] when he tired he get down he realized he
[1:57:16] have not even gone closer to the
[1:57:17] righteousness yet
[1:57:20] praise the lord
[1:57:25] then he decided to travel to rome
[1:57:29] he wanted to go and meet
[1:57:31] the the the the catholic
[1:57:36] hop and see how things are done there
[1:57:38] maybe when i get closer to the pope
[1:57:42] i might get holy
[1:57:46] but when he got closer that's when he
[1:57:48] saw
[1:57:50] his biggest disappointment in the church
[1:57:53] he saw the abuse
[1:58:01] the way young women that were that were
[1:58:03] kept to be uh
[1:58:05] uh a symbol of marriage in in in uh
[1:58:08] chastity and all of that the abuse that
[1:58:11] was happening he just couldn't stand it
[1:58:15] on his way back then he remember
[1:58:17] habakkuk two 2-4
[1:58:20] the just
[1:58:21] shall leave by faith
[1:58:26] praise the lord
[1:58:29] the scripture
[1:58:30] started ringing in his ears just like
[1:58:32] isaiah said this way this is the way
[1:58:36] walk here in it
[1:58:38] you will not turn to the right you will
[1:58:39] not turn to the left but you will hear
[1:58:42] that this is the way
[1:58:45] and it was echoing in his head and he
[1:58:48] got back home and started reading the
[1:58:50] bible
[1:58:54] so the book of romans was was one of
[1:58:57] luther's favorite book
[1:59:00] because there where he honors to the
[1:59:02] righteousness of god
[1:59:06] the righteousness of god
[1:59:11] that has been attributed to
[1:59:14] us praise the lord
[1:59:20] especially when the scripture says
[1:59:23] no man seek after god
[1:59:27] amen
[1:59:28] if no man seek after god
[1:59:31] then everything is god's own initiative
[1:59:37] he fined us
[1:59:40] he called us
[1:59:41] because he predestinated us
[1:59:46] and he cleans us
[1:59:50] and he lives his life through us
[1:59:59] are we together
[2:00:02] so
[2:00:02] that's god's determined
[2:00:05] oh god deliberate plan his his
[2:00:07] determined counsel
[2:00:09] god was so determined that he makes he
[2:00:12] make his own adventure and and make him
[2:00:15] so perfect
[2:00:16] he was determined
[2:00:19] that he that he predestinated us
[2:00:22] praise the lord
[2:00:24] and in doing that
[2:00:28] he set out the time that we will come
[2:00:32] praise the lord
[2:00:34] oh church what what a comfort
[2:00:39] what a counsel
[2:00:41] let's look at the scripture yamato looks
[2:00:43] in luke chapter four
[2:00:46] see luke chapter four
[2:00:54] adam was not deceived
[2:00:57] the next time you read that scripture
[2:01:00] you will not think about yourself
[2:01:04] because sometimes
[2:01:06] some of us brothers we used to settle
[2:01:08] that asset you know in the house that's
[2:01:11] why the bible say adam was not deceived
[2:01:18] using that scripture you're kicking
[2:01:20] yourself out of grace because you are
[2:01:22] not adam
[2:01:30] see luke chapter four let's take
[2:01:33] males in luke chapter 4 comes out here
[2:01:37] right after this great notable statement
[2:01:41] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:01:44] in your ears jesus has just made that
[2:01:48] statement verse 22
[2:01:50] and all bear him witness and wonder are
[2:01:54] the gracious words that proceed out of
[2:01:56] his mouth
[2:01:58] and they said
[2:02:00] it's not this joseph's son
[2:02:03] and he
[2:02:04] and he said unto them yeah will surely
[2:02:07] say unto me this perfect physician
[2:02:10] heal their self
[2:02:15] whatsoever
[2:02:16] we have heard on in companion do also
[2:02:20] here in this country
[2:02:22] in that country and he said verily i
[2:02:25] said unto you no prophet is acceptable
[2:02:28] it's accepted in his own
[2:02:30] country are we together
[2:02:34] now listen to this now
[2:02:36] but i tell you
[2:02:38] of a truth many widows were in israel
[2:02:43] in the days of elias
[2:02:49] when the heavens were shot for three
[2:02:52] years and six months
[2:02:55] when great farming
[2:02:57] was throughout all the land
[2:03:00] he said many widows
[2:03:02] but
[2:03:03] but onto none of them was elias sin
[2:03:06] served
[2:03:08] the
[2:03:09] the the
[2:03:11] seraphtide
[2:03:15] a city of sedum onto a woman
[2:03:18] that was a widow
[2:03:21] and many lepros
[2:03:23] were in the were in israel in the time
[2:03:26] of elisha the prophet and none of them
[2:03:31] was claiming seth nema the syrian
[2:03:35] and all they in the synagogues
[2:03:40] when they heard these things were filled
[2:03:42] with wrath
[2:03:44] and rose up
[2:03:46] and trust him out of the city
[2:03:49] praise the lord
[2:03:50] now when he took the book
[2:03:54] and read
[2:03:57] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[2:03:59] for he have anointed me
[2:04:02] praise the lord
[2:04:04] the bible says the eyes of of of them
[2:04:07] all in the synagogues were fasting on
[2:04:09] him
[2:04:10] and he said this day this scripture is
[2:04:13] fulfilled
[2:04:17] but then jesus continued
[2:04:21] and he brought this thing about the time
[2:04:24] of elijah and the time
[2:04:27] of elisha
[2:04:30] now do you realize
[2:04:32] or do you realize
[2:04:37] wha what actually got them angry
[2:04:40] few minutes ago they were so captured
[2:04:47] that he walked right into their
[2:04:48] cylinders stuck the pulpit
[2:04:51] open the straw
[2:04:59] now realize now
[2:05:01] when jesus spoke about the time of
[2:05:03] elijah
[2:05:05] which is dear prophet
[2:05:08] what kind of a woman did he associate
[2:05:11] a gentile woman
[2:05:15] when he talked about elisha
[2:05:17] which was also a prophet of israel
[2:05:20] who did he associate a gentile king
[2:05:25] now so what troubled then
[2:05:28] the subject
[2:05:30] of
[2:05:31] election
[2:05:37] so all that jesus was talking about was
[2:05:40] the plan of redemption
[2:05:43] there were many widows
[2:05:45] only one election
[2:05:48] there were many lepers only one election
[2:05:56] are we together
[2:05:59] now because there is a bunch of
[2:06:02] religious people
[2:06:04] that believe that they are the seed of
[2:06:06] abraham they are the people of god
[2:06:12] we are in the message
[2:06:14] and here jesus in their own church
[2:06:20] is telling them that
[2:06:22] this plan of redemption is bigger than
[2:06:24] you
[2:06:29] this plane of redemption god's plan of
[2:06:31] redemption is older than you is from the
[2:06:34] foundation of the world
[2:06:36] from the back part of god's mind
[2:06:40] don't interpret it to your own
[2:06:41] convenience
[2:06:45] praise the lord
[2:06:46] don't interpret it to your own
[2:06:48] convenience
[2:06:50] because we have that way of
[2:06:52] interpretation that's the reason why one
[2:06:55] time we are elect and another time we
[2:06:56] are not elect
[2:07:02] this is a determined council
[2:07:05] this is a deliberate plan of god
[2:07:08] if he has to break your legs to get you
[2:07:11] in
[2:07:12] he's determined and he will do it
[2:07:19] if he has to stick you on a sick bed
[2:07:24] and get iv all around you
[2:07:28] for you to get your heart right
[2:07:31] god is deliberate
[2:07:33] he will do it
[2:07:37] this is a determined council
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:42] that's the reason why ananiah said paul
[2:07:44] sword is hard to kick against the praise
[2:07:48] the approach is a very sharp object
[2:07:52] you can kick against the nail can you
[2:07:54] see a nail and kick it you know what
[2:07:56] will happen
[2:08:01] this is a determined council people
[2:08:07] young people god they not made a mistake
[2:08:16] to pass you through the parents that you
[2:08:18] came through
[2:08:20] and to have this message laying on your
[2:08:23] laps
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:25] praise the lord
[2:08:28] it will either make heaven comes easy
[2:08:32] for you
[2:08:33] thank
[2:08:34] you thank you
[2:08:37] oh i will take you to hell and bring you
[2:08:39] back
[2:08:41] praise the lord
[2:08:43] this is a determined counsel
[2:08:45] god is deliberate
[2:08:54] he's deliberate in what he's doing
[2:09:00] to have you sitting down here this
[2:09:02] morning he meant it
[2:09:04] he taught about it
[2:09:07] praise the lord
[2:09:13] but my wisdom called me yesterday we're
[2:09:15] talking he says yeah i'm coming over
[2:09:17] brother i'm tired of sitting down here i
[2:09:19] said well okay
[2:09:22] i'm just tired sitting down here i need
[2:09:24] to come out a little bit
[2:09:28] when god is determined
[2:09:30] he's determined god had his mind made up
[2:09:35] you you are the one that now is thinking
[2:09:36] i have my mind made up his mind being
[2:09:38] made a long time
[2:09:40] you just made up your mind
[2:09:43] praise the lord i have my mind made up
[2:09:47] and i won't turn back
[2:09:51] his own being made a long time
[2:09:53] he don't know where back is
[2:09:55] that's right yes
[2:09:57] praise the lord
[2:09:58] the god that don't sleep
[2:10:01] and don't slumber
[2:10:03] he knows what he's doing
[2:10:06] and he mean it
[2:10:08] praise the lord he mean it
[2:10:10] glory be to god
[2:10:12] if he promised to give you the holy
[2:10:14] ghost he mean it
[2:10:16] hallelujah and he's going to do anything
[2:10:20] everything
[2:10:21] whether you say amen or not god is going
[2:10:24] to do everything to get that holy ghost
[2:10:26] down in you
[2:10:30] and give you peace
[2:10:32] and then see what you would do with him
[2:10:37] praise the lord
[2:10:40] he's determined
[2:10:42] that's what redemption is all about
[2:10:45] it's a deliberate thing of god
[2:10:48] it took god from his self-existent state
[2:10:53] this is not a church matter it's not a
[2:10:55] doctrine matter it's something that god
[2:10:57] is attached to
[2:11:01] he said i would get a church without
[2:11:03] spot or wrinkle
[2:11:05] praise the lord
[2:11:06] amen
[2:11:08] and he mean it
[2:11:11] god mean it
[2:11:13] so don't look at your church and judge
[2:11:15] the bride don't look at your personal
[2:11:17] life and george the bride the god that
[2:11:19] had promised that god have said it
[2:11:23] is more than able to produce a church
[2:11:27] if you are not up to it god is up to it
[2:11:37] some of you young people you think
[2:11:38] you're smart
[2:11:42] but no matter what
[2:11:43] move fast there is always an eye that
[2:11:46] sees it
[2:11:50] praise the lord that's something that
[2:11:53] god placed in nature
[2:11:54] no matter what moves fast there will
[2:11:57] always be something that will see it

[2:13:24] beginning

[2:13:27] and and when
[2:13:29] we are

[2:14:09] that first little sweetheart there
[2:14:12] in the garden of eden i see adam there
[2:14:16] when he put his arm around
[2:14:19] his little sweetheart to walk out with
[2:14:22] her
[2:14:23] for god i condemned him
[2:14:26] and he started out with his arm around
[2:14:30] around his darling adam was not deceived
[2:14:34] he didn't have
[2:14:36] to walk out but he walked out because he
[2:14:40] loved his wife
[2:14:42] when you read for god so loved the word
[2:14:46] adam never had a choice
[2:14:49] amen
[2:14:50] he didn't have a choice
[2:14:53] there was no choice in his mind he never
[2:14:55] had another option
[2:14:57] i said well if you don't make your life
[2:14:59] right
[2:15:00] i'll kick you out
[2:15:04] to him that was just the thing to do
[2:15:11] he came home
[2:15:12] eve all
[2:15:14] crying all
[2:15:17] crying and weeping
[2:15:19] he just came home embraced her and she
[2:15:22] telling me everything
[2:15:26] there was no time to say
[2:15:28] what was that who was that
[2:15:32] for god
[2:15:35] why we were yet sinners
[2:15:38] why we were yes sinners
[2:15:41] wicked in our hearts
[2:15:44] evil
[2:15:49] christ died for us
[2:15:57] put his redemptive wrath on us
[2:16:00] while we were yet sinners
[2:16:06] praise the lord
[2:16:10] preaching away from home i started that
[2:16:12] subject you never had time to get back
[2:16:13] to it but i've been thinking about it
[2:16:15] lately i was preaching on the abuse
[2:16:19] and trying to show
[2:16:20] that
[2:16:22] the reason why we have all the complex
[2:16:24] and things that we deal with
[2:16:26] is because our first birth was on abuse
[2:16:32] they abuse
[2:16:34] between
[2:16:35] the serpent and eve
[2:16:39] we all fall under that right
[2:16:43] that's why we deal with all of the
[2:16:44] things that we deal with
[2:16:48] praise the lord
[2:16:53] is because our natural birth
[2:16:56] is an abuse you see that's the reason
[2:16:58] why the new birth is not a suggestion
[2:17:01] jesus said must
[2:17:03] you must
[2:17:05] be born again
[2:17:08] that's the only way
[2:17:11] for you to be free from this abuse
[2:17:15] amen and the tendency of people that are
[2:17:18] abused
[2:17:19] thinking that they are protecting
[2:17:22] they always turn to abuse others
[2:17:27] i don't want to go ahead of myself
[2:17:30] we'll have time to look into it
[2:17:33] if the lord allowed us to
[2:17:39] praise the lord
[2:17:43] then we will appreciate
[2:17:46] the ministry of malachi 4
[2:17:49] praise the lord
[2:17:51] it will not only be a message of
[2:17:53] doctrine and calls in order for us
[2:17:56] god really sent us a prophet
[2:17:59] to deliver us from religious abuse
[2:18:02] from every form
[2:18:04] of abuse
[2:18:07] that's what the holy ghost is for
[2:18:09] hallelujah
[2:18:18] that's what the holy ghost
[2:18:20] is giving
[2:18:22] for praise the lord
[2:18:28] thank you lord
[2:18:31] when you identify things
[2:18:35] why things are happening
[2:18:37] it's easy
[2:18:39] to bring you some level of grace
[2:18:45] because some people get so mad with
[2:18:47] themselves why this thing keep happening
[2:18:48] to me my life oh god just kill me
[2:18:54] but it's not your fault
[2:18:58] you were just abused
[2:19:09] you are just reacting
[2:19:11] to an abuse
[2:19:16] now think about a child living in a home
[2:19:19] maybe the parent the father never beats
[2:19:22] their child but they see how
[2:19:25] much abuse their mother is taking
[2:19:28] it affects the child
[2:19:32] praise the lord the child can be in
[2:19:34] class and the teacher is talking to
[2:19:37] another hey you stop sleeping they just
[2:19:40] kept fighting
[2:19:42] why because that's all the witness at
[2:19:44] home
[2:19:48] child is abused emotionally
[2:19:57] and that's
[2:19:59] what our first birth
[2:20:01] produce
[2:20:04] david said in sin did my mother conceive
[2:20:07] me
[2:20:10] come into the word
[2:20:12] speaking lies
[2:20:17] because of the abuse
[2:20:19] that's the first thing we turn to we we
[2:20:21] turn to lie
[2:20:23] because we are afraid
[2:20:31] don't look at your natural home and
[2:20:33] natural family and natural things that
[2:20:34] you have gone to retracing this back to
[2:20:37] the beginning
[2:20:39] that's what took place in eating
[2:20:42] he deceive her
[2:20:44] and abuse her
[2:20:50] and then in genesis
[2:20:52] he becomes the accuser
[2:20:54] he's the abuser and the accuser
[2:21:03] praise the lord
[2:21:07] that's why we cannot break in our
[2:21:08] natural family
[2:21:12] as much as we love our family name and
[2:21:15] we must respect our parents but you
[2:21:17] cannot break in that line you have to
[2:21:20] come back to the new birth
[2:21:24] if there is anything we must glory in
[2:21:26] is the birth
[2:21:29] that comes by the sea incorruptible
[2:21:39] praise the lord
[2:21:40] can you imagine
[2:21:43] on a thanksgiving meeting preaching on
[2:21:45] the abuse
[2:21:48] after the service i started thinking
[2:21:50] what have i done
[2:21:53] i mean i'm supposed to be talking about
[2:21:55] giving thanks to god
[2:22:00] you know that one of the sisters told me
[2:22:03] say sir
[2:22:05] when i say we'll be talking on the abuse
[2:22:07] her daughter said what abuse
[2:22:10] my goodness
[2:22:13] why the church service tonight
[2:22:19] but all i was trying to tell the church
[2:22:21] is that
[2:22:23] if there is one thing we can be thankful
[2:22:25] for
[2:22:28] is that malachi 4 said behold i send
[2:22:30] elijah the prophet
[2:22:32] before the great and the dreadful dying
[2:22:35] we can be thankful that god sent us a
[2:22:37] prophet
[2:22:39] praise the lord
[2:22:40] amen
[2:22:41] if not
[2:22:43] we will have all been in different
[2:22:44] systems
[2:22:46] different churches doing horrible things
[2:22:49] and thinking that we are serving god
[2:22:53] will be doing horrible things
[2:22:56] and thinking
[2:22:57] that we are serving god
[2:23:06] we trust the lord let me just read this
[2:23:08] down and find a place to close here a
[2:23:10] far past my time
[2:23:14] let's think closely 4 000 years later
[2:23:16] yandere
[2:23:18] in the center of jerusalem let's change
[2:23:20] the saying and look
[2:23:22] reading from job here he says come down
[2:23:24] the street
[2:23:26] jerusalem
[2:23:27] bumpy bumpy bomb
[2:23:29] out of the gate of damascus jan the
[2:23:32] ghost
[2:23:33] towards gogota a little fellow
[2:23:37] with a crown
[2:23:39] on his little brown on his head
[2:23:41] and a cross over his shoulder
[2:23:44] look all over his back
[2:23:48] this little red spot
[2:23:50] what are they
[2:23:52] look back yonder where adam was
[2:23:56] leaving
[2:23:58] with his sweetheart growing under
[2:24:00] condemnation
[2:24:02] with a sh with a shadow of redemption
[2:24:06] somewhere because there was
[2:24:08] blood running
[2:24:10] over them somewhere
[2:24:12] there was a shadow
[2:24:14] he knew it and i heard something goes
[2:24:18] brother branham clapped he says what is
[2:24:19] that
[2:24:21] is that all bloody
[2:24:23] ships came beating
[2:24:26] up and down his legs
[2:24:28] god wrapped him in a bloody sheep's king
[2:24:33] praise the lord
[2:24:34] that's the reason why the bleeding word
[2:24:36] is our covering
[2:24:38] the bleeding word is the word for our
[2:24:41] day not an imaginary cavalry
[2:24:45] but when we walk in the light as he is
[2:24:48] in the light then the blood cleans us
[2:24:52] so the blood of god to every age is the
[2:24:54] light of god the message of the hour
[2:25:02] praise the lord
[2:25:06] how do we overcome walk in the light
[2:25:09] just walk
[2:25:13] is it difficult to walk
[2:25:16] the reason why you think it's difficult
[2:25:17] is because you want you you're trying to
[2:25:19] make stuff walk
[2:25:21] that's right
[2:25:25] this is what i'm saying pick up your
[2:25:27] legs
[2:25:29] no i'm doing i'm doing it too fancy
[2:25:33] walk
[2:25:35] am i making star
[2:25:37] no just walk
[2:25:39] just walk
[2:25:50] just walk walk in the light
[2:25:55] but we make it too complicated
[2:26:03] so i use my left foot before the right
[2:26:06] just walk
[2:26:09] just go
[2:26:16] walk in the light
[2:26:19] and more will unfold
[2:26:24] we want to understand before we start no
[2:26:26] just walk
[2:26:27] just walk
[2:26:29] just walk
[2:26:32] and more we unfold
[2:26:37] and you start finding that
[2:26:40] you have overburdened yourself
[2:26:54] what a god we self
[2:26:57] what a mighty god we sell
[2:27:00] just like we said on wednesday night
[2:27:02] that's the reason why paul
[2:27:04] in the boca for romans chapter five
[2:27:08] that was what we close with wednesday
[2:27:10] night let's just read there and we can
[2:27:12] close this up tonight
[2:27:14] amen
[2:27:16] hallelujah
[2:27:19] praise the lord
[2:27:28] in romans chapter 5 i was just listening
[2:27:30] to brother branham speaking on the same
[2:27:31] thing this morning condemnation by
[2:27:33] representation that was exactly what
[2:27:35] brother branham was talking about
[2:27:38] he says one man for one man's sin
[2:27:41] one man
[2:27:42] and an employee in in
[2:27:46] romans chapter 5 when he takes the
[2:27:49] subject
[2:27:52] verse 12 he says wherefore asked by one
[2:27:55] man sin
[2:27:57] enter into the word and death now he
[2:28:00] didn't say one woman
[2:28:01] paul never accused eve here he said one
[2:28:04] man
[2:28:08] why because it was the man that did it
[2:28:10] deliberately
[2:28:13] he never took an issue with the woman
[2:28:16] because she was deceived
[2:28:21] [Laughter]
[2:28:25] oh my
[2:28:26] the legalistic brothers are going to
[2:28:28] just blow my head off
[2:28:30] but that's fine
[2:28:32] i will just go before you amen
[2:28:34] i mean they're just going to blow me off
[2:28:36] what is god is preaching my goodness me
[2:28:38] brother branham says the woman she's out
[2:28:40] she's the weaker vessel the woman is the
[2:28:42] bad product of the woman
[2:28:44] my goodness
[2:28:47] when they don't realize that
[2:28:49] they also are honored that group
[2:28:54] that's why our
[2:28:56] invisible union brother branham said
[2:28:58] when paul preached the book of romans he
[2:29:00] said paul preached on a prophecy
[2:29:03] he was prophesying
[2:29:05] he was now very fascinated about a
[2:29:07] literal woman and the literal man he was
[2:29:09] preaching on a prophecy because he's the
[2:29:11] prophet
[2:29:19] praise the
[2:29:20] lord you see after the reformation
[2:29:24] that's when when martin luther stepped
[2:29:27] out and started to preach
[2:29:29] the church starts to break in the grace
[2:29:31] of god the people started to feel the
[2:29:35] fresh breath of aid
[2:29:37] oh my goodness the kind of things that
[2:29:40] the catholic church put on the people
[2:29:41] you got to pay money for this you seen
[2:29:44] you got to pay money i mean people were
[2:29:46] selling their farms starving their
[2:29:48] children
[2:29:50] just for indulgence
[2:29:53] and when he came out with that message
[2:29:55] the joshua led by faith
[2:29:58] the church started to breathe
[2:30:01] people cannot even find food in their
[2:30:03] house to eat
[2:30:06] you see that's the reason why different
[2:30:09] movement movement also followed that
[2:30:11] because there were a bunch of people
[2:30:12] that just drummed on the wagon preacher
[2:30:14] brother preaching they never even got
[2:30:16] the revelation we have in amish people
[2:30:19] we get a lot of their sins we get
[2:30:20] jehovah witness every one of them came
[2:30:23] out of that
[2:30:30] when a man does not understand the grace
[2:30:33] of god
[2:30:34] you will either become a legalist
[2:30:37] or you will make a disgrace out of grace
[2:30:50] you will either become a legalist
[2:30:53] jesus says
[2:30:55] they stop themselves from entering they
[2:30:57] stop everybody else
[2:31:02] but the prophet god said
[2:31:04] if i cannot walk like enoch
[2:31:06] i won't stand in the way
[2:31:08] of any man that has enough faith
[2:31:13] what a contract
[2:31:15] yes
[2:31:23] this message is this message is high now
[2:31:26] this message it's hard
[2:31:29] what is that
[2:31:31] that you make it hard
[2:31:39] oh this they can't believe it no they
[2:31:42] can be my family can believe this
[2:31:43] message
[2:31:45] because you're not living it right
[2:31:48] yes because you are not living a right
[2:31:55] you are not becoming sweet
[2:32:02] you need to enter romans chapter 4
[2:32:06] and then go to romans chapter 5.
[2:32:08] you just been walking from one to three
[2:32:13] a pagan that had just had good morals
[2:32:17] and now he's religious very dangerous
[2:32:21] he can put bumps on himself and blow a
[2:32:23] whole plane off
[2:32:26] praise the lord that's what people been
[2:32:28] doing
[2:32:29] they put religious bomb on themselves
[2:32:31] and blow their whole family to hell
[2:32:33] misrepresent the word misrepresent the
[2:32:35] message

[2:33:16] intention for your life
