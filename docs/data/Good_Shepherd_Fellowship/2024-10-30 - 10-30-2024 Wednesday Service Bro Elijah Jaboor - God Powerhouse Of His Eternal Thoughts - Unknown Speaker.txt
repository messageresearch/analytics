want to come back and bring thanks to the Lord praise the lord we want to come and bring [Music] amen praise the Lord before we uh uh go to that tonight I would just want to read um a few things uh just a quote or two before we pray from the message Faith Africa trip report brother Brandon talks about uh uh he says if the blessing placed on you hold still sometimes it's a day before he can get to you Daniel Prayed one time and the angel didn't get to him for 21 days is that right I have seen the time where women and men will wait for weeks and the the first thing you know all at once it happens the angel passing through the neighborhood I've been thinking about that and just realizing everything that is happening in our neighborhood and everything that we want to happen in our neighborhood I believe the Angels Take pass in the neighborhood amen and you see the angel just don't pass in the neighborhood there are people that attract the Angel that's right praise the Lord the angel came because Daniel was praying praise the Lord but Ram talks about the the two women that went to the meeting and came back from the meeting believing that God will heal them and because of their faith the angel passed in that neighborhood so that's what I believe that uh the angel is is attracted to a people the angeled is attracted to a believing group of people a people that take God at his word people that are holding to God's promise the Bible says the angels of the Lord are Inc come about them that fear Him Praise the Lord so uh uh I want us to prayed in just with the the few things we've been sharing with you that is happening in our in our city in our neighborhood we want to bring that to the Lord that uh uh he will be so attracted to to us to the word that is preached to the atmosphere that is created that the angel of the Lord will come and pass in our neighborhood brother baham says you want the angel to visit your house there is an attitude that you have to take amen you want the angel to visit your your life there is an attitude and an atmosphere you have to create that's what attract the angel you know the angels are attracted to the word praise the Lord and uh so he says uh I have seen where women and men who wait for weeks and the first thing you know all I wants it happened the angel passing through the neighborhood he knows where it's at amen he knows where we are he knows that we are gathered yet tonight amen praise the Lord and that's and that is the kind of a expectation I want us to to uh uh create in our heart and and uh that uh whether you are at home whether you at church or you are at work you have to know that uh you have in you what it takes to attract the angel praise the Lord amen he knows where is at whatsoever you B on Earth I will bur in heaven what you lose on Earth I will lose in heaven is is that right that's his sovereignty amen the next quote here he says the church better be examining themsel by the word of God our Purity our loyalty our devotion now that's one of the thing also that that that attract my attention you know well it is our devotion you know that God looks to he's attracted to our devotion you know uh I mean it's it's not just our our morning prayer and evening prayer but our daily devotion you know the way we are devoted at the word not only at church even at work you know the way we represent the word in uh the manner of conversation we get ourself in getting away from all the gossip the way we represent the word by the way we dress with the way we represent the word by the things that we do it says uh we better be examined ourself uh uh the church better be examined themselves by the word our Purity our loyalty our devotion we have become uh tolers T bearers uh cigar smoker bik batches painted up Jesse be everything in the calendar that the rest of the word does the Christian church is associated with those things today till you can hardly tell the one from the other it's time we took an inventory amen is getting late praise the Lord and I know uh uh uh it's a big part of the church world today and uh we want to thank God that God has given us an instruction how to dress ourself how to behave ourself praise the Lord so we want to thank the Lord today tonight the next one I will read and if the and if the Christian church today will only think in their heart that God that uh think in your heart the god of Heaven deserve our best of everything that you have the best of your time all your devotion and everything you are you owe it to God praise the Lord let's just bow our heads tonight we want to go to the Lord in prayer there's uh one prayer need tonight that's from sister doas and uh please join me in prayer for a friend who will be going to jail for an accident uh that he got into for an accident that he got into that the good Lord will take control of his case also please pray for my mom okay s do has asking for prayer for sister Nessy and also for the friend that have had an having an accident case and and uh uh a j sentence but we want to bring those things to the Lord tonight but before we take up those needs I just want for us to come before the Lord with Thanksgiving for giving us another opportunity to come in the house of the Lord tonight we just want to thank the Lord and and uh and we just want once again want to place ourself before him and and ask to Lord to to just uh continue to deal with our hearts continue to deal with our life we want to pray again uh uh that uh the angel of the Lord will pass through our neighborhood since I believe that we can create such an atmosphere and uh uh with with all the ches I mean the cares around the city of Minneapolis is overwhelming the police the police are overwhelmed but I believe because of the presence of a group of people that is praying a group of people that is uh dedicating and concentrating himself to the Lord and uh we believe that God can can visit our neighborhood not only to stop the chaos but he can also visit our neighborhood and speak to to people in their homes and and and and and bring conviction to their home and and and and pick them up from your bed and uh uh uh uh God that's that's the kind of a God that we are we are serving I believe they they are the I still believe there is an IL one or two that is stay in the setting I believe there are people that are that that that wanting a reality of God people that are so tired with church denomination they really want God they don't know where to find him I believe when the angel visit our neighborhood he can give people addresses and so I just I just want us to pray tonight and again let's just uh commit our assembly in the hands of the Lord let's pray that uh for all our our preaching

thee and whatsoever I commanded thee thou shall speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee said the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touch my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth I have this day set thee over the nation over the kingdom to root up to pull down to destroy and to throw down to build to PL May Lord a blessing

Scot and and also brother Steve C and brothers be a great help support the work we building our church back there it was a great support Hallelujah I can't forget about that amen and I believe God bless them for it bless the family for the support towards God's work back home amen many of you that don't know when the work started there it was a great support to our church back there and I want to always appreciate the effort and I pray that God will bless his Saints the family and the children God will not forget the labor of love hallelujah amen so I just want to speak in this message and I pray that God will help the church and I want to preach on God's Powerhouse of his internal thought amen and just reading portion of God's word to God Powerhouse of his internal thought in our looking at the word Powerhouse Hallelujah and Powerhouse which means if you almost when being a plant of electricity Hallelujah it will be a big hydro plant it's almost like a power house when you build this plant it release power energy and go Force Amen to cause Electrify everywhere and a Powerhouse is almost like what a forceful or a a a great strength of energy Hallelujah ljah amen and now and now God also is giving the PowerHouse of his internal thought and jeremi that God could tell Jeremiah before I formed the in your B so it's a sign that in this life if God your parents how do they come together maybe they were in different states or different region how do they come together before they they come together husband and wife up they meet before you come Hallelujah IM is a great God that organiz everything because you don't know God tell your parents that bring you but he said before I form you Hallelujah so you know that if God said before I form before before you are form in the in the mother womb he said I formed before I form you in the belly before I created I bring your father and your mother together I knew you Hallelujah he said I knew you before I bring together I knew you and I know who you are and I know your name Hallelujah and said I knew you he said he said knew the and before you ever come forth out of that womb there many still birth there many children he said lost many things but he said before you come forth I predestinated you I form you and I new you and I sanctify you I bring you here for a purpose huah thank you Lord hallelujah and that is what God is telling you today that you are you are you are here for a purpose it mean that you are not here by chance so you must always know that it's a purpose and when God bringing you up when you bring Jeremiah there Hallelujah and hey ordain you as a prophet to the nation so God orain every one of us for a peculiar purpose amen he said but Jeremiah was complaining he was trying to say God oh you know I am a child I but God say don't say you a child and you my weaknesses my situation go say don't look at your situations don't look at your circumstances in life don't look at your condition look at me Hallelujah because I call you I you I put you together Hallelujah and I mov you so don't complain don't be perplexed don't be confused Hallelujah don't be distressed Hallelujah because it's God work and it's God in it all it's not you that go Jeremiah only yourself he said ah because he he told Moses when Moses the St I canot go say who created D to speak who do this I God have done it so God don't look at your impediment God look at what his word says about you that's right Hallelujah so what God look what go what God Sayes about you is what you look at because God say he build you he moved you and when God build you he build you as a Powerhouse that a great strength that go say I I ordain you and I predestinated you of a great strength to C the influence Hallelujah to get much energy that your life is a testimony hallelujah amen so you can see that God saying said he said be not afraid of their faces he said for I will deliver thee say the Lord don't be afraid of no situation don't let fear get hold of you because fear is a tet so don't be afraid of any circumstances only believe God and know you are made for a purpose hallelujah oh yes sir and God put for his word and touch him and church is God that touches our life amen amen God touches us God touches our life God touch our home God touch our family and when God be for us who shall be against us hallelujah so it's a power it's an anointing it's an atmosphere that God have touched you Hallelujah he have touched your life Soto you church that is God said never be negative always be positive because the anointing that touch that coming this age that have touched your life that have changed situation in your heart hallelujah amen so you see church and God say I set thee over the Nations over the kingdom you got to to root up Hallelujah to pull down right to destroy to throw down to build and to plant that's right and God call us for a purpose Hallelujah sometimes we have to pull down sometime to uproot Hallelujah some sometimes it's not easy that God not seven in the church Hallelujah and sometime you see the is preaching he's not preaching again you because it's an anointing he cannot help it Hallelujah and sometime you had to pull down so to up root Hallelujah and and church to build if you want to build any building you must pull everything down all the old thing might cast it away Hallelujah you if you to cultivate a land you you might pull the storms you might PL the ground you have to build a place where you can plant the great crops God say set you so hallelujah what amen as a Powerhouse as a source of strength as a source of Life as a source of influence as a source of anointing Hallelujah and that Powerhouse he Shar you it was in his internal thought hallelujah oh yes sir you see a church and that's it before the finish the word of God for you that is why we saw in First Peter 2 vers verse 9 the Bible said but ye are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood you are a holy nation and you are a p people amen you are P Hallelujah that you should show forth the praise of him who are called you out of Darkness into this is what Marvelous Light because he call you Ando to inspire you so you always know in your life because know you by what as a Powerhouse of his internal thought and knowing that you are in a generation what is very filthy a very perverted but God AB build you yes hallelujah hallelujah that say you a royal priesthood you are a chosen generation Hallelujah and he call you out of darkness in into a marvelous light and light break every Darkness light cast every negative influences when the light shine all Darkness scattered away and you are the light hallelujah oh yes sir amen so he say wish in P time in pass

Hallelujah and paragraph what 125 he said before there was a word before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was a light before there was anything when it was when it was still God God and His thought the intal thought of God chooses you Hallelujah when God existed there was nothing but he said the inal thought of God chooses You by predestination by for knowledge to know that you will be on the earth to know there will be sin but intent of God chooses you God that is what church we are in a Bible the in God chooses you and know you'll be on earth Hallelujah and someone said then why was that sin if it had never been seen his Ang who has never have been a to project to be a savior amen yeah there to be a sinner so he could be a savior there had to be a sick man so he could be a heer there are it had to be that way Hallelujah go saw it and for it that devil isn't even in the rest oh yes sir I love that church the devil is not even in a rest
