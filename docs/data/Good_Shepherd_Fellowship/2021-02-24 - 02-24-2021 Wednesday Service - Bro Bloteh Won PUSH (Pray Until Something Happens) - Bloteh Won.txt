also streaming online we agree to you in jesus name amen let's take isaiah i 37 let's just read the first three verses and then we can have you see and we might just make some few commentary some quotes of the prophet and then we can find a place to pray tonight and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he ran his claws and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord and he said alaikum who was over the household and shep nathan's tribe and the others of the priests covered with cycles unto isaiah the prophet the son of hemos and this and this said unto him thus said hezekiah this day is the date of trouble and of rebuke and of blood's fame that's the three things that we will see in uh in the message that rafshikkha brought but let's just read and then we can have a seat this date is the date of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children i come to the birth and there is now strength to bring forth let us pray heavenly father lord jesus father we want to approach you tonight lord and using your word as a talking your prophet taught us lord we must present the talking because you will hear our voice through the word through the blood through the bleeding word so god we use these verses tonight we can say of ourselves lord here we are we have come to the birth and we need strength from you to bring forth bless the service tonight in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you can have your seed so we would just uh make few comment here like i said i think you will see sometimes that uh i coming and just we go right into praying and then have the brothers coming or if i would have to preach and then we pray tonight i decided that we'll just talk a little bit set a stage here and then we can go into praying tonight the children i come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth what what an inspiration what what uh uh what a parable now remember them this was hezekiah and he became king after ayab and uh he was the one that destroyed all the all the the idols and the different things that they have built and uh but before we go into this let's let's just go back a little bit you will see in chapter 36 at first i thought i was going to ask our sisters in the sound room to play the entire chapter for us but you can go home and read it it would take uh it would take up our praying time now so uh what happened here is that uh uh uh the assyrians the king of asira uh senator on to the king of israel now when he came there are few things that are very you know very uh important year when he came he started to speak in the hebrew language you know he started to speak in the hebrew language now you have to you have to watch the same year israel had three captivities their first was in egypt their second captivity was in uh assyria was in assyria now now uh doing the air captivity in assyria that was were the mistress of of uh the jews and and the gentiles makes that produce the samaritans that's where the samaritans lost their identity and they became almost a separate people uh from from the children of israel so uh uh during that time the israel the the israelites learned the the assyrian language and the assyrians also learned the hebrew language now so uh this commanding general came to represent his king and then let's read a little bit chapter 36 now they came to pass in the 14th year of king hezekiah that cena sheriff the king of uh of assyria came up against all the defense city of judah and took them and the king of assyria sent ravshika from lashes to jerusalem on to king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduct of the upper pole in the highway of the fall of field then came forth unto him elect him hit higher son which was over the house and shepna the strife and joao assaf son the recorder and said unto them say now say you now to hezekiah said the great king of assyria what confidence is this wherein that trusted let's underline there because this whole battle is going to be where your trust is he's uh he's going to he's challenging where their trust is and and i think uh that is where we are as believers amen where your trust is and then he go on and he talks a little bit there verse 7 but if they say to me we trust in the lord our god it is not he whose high places and whose author hezekiah has taken away now what happened here is that because ahab has built all these idols places in down in belton and all of these places he has built over the over the reign of ahab the the nations around uh israel have come to understand that this was a way of washing so hezekiah coming down and breaking down those strands rashika is saying this that if you are trusting in god hezekiah has breakdown his shrine the high places and he never did anything how can you trust in a god that would not do something when a man has come and distraught uh things that were built in his name so what happened here the church has misrepresented god until the people of the world are thinking that this is the true way of worship because israel has gone out of there now so he said if you are trusting in god is it not the god whose uh high places that hezekiah had destroyed what have you done about it how can you trust in the god like that right who are you trusting are we together amen now so he goes ahead now let's drop down to verse 10. so i'll skip a little bit and i'm and am i not come up without the lord against this land to destroy the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy then said i like him and shapna and draw on to rashika speak i pray thee onto that seven in the syrian language for we understand it and speak now to us in the jews language in the years of the people that are on the wall now you know as i was as i was meditating upon this it is not that rashika didn't know what he was doing he purposely spoke in the jewish language to intimidate the people he was speaking and speaking very loud so the people around can hear it and everybody can go to their home and it can become the subject of the night you hear what happened you hear what what went on today and somebody said you heard you heard you heard and what i was thinking about that today i said i i i i tried to to bring bring it into into perspective of what we are dealing with in our age the devil has allowed people to put things on the internet about the message about brother branham and [Music] and it's it's a language of intimidation if you don't have the kind of revelation that uh uh we will talk about yet a little bit but that that is certain tactics when goliath came to challenge israel yes he never had a meeting with saul that's right he waited when the town was fought and he stood and yelled and got everybody attention and said look let us not share blood you'll choose one man to come and meet me if he beat me you're rude us if i beat him we rule you people but the reason why he was talking this was to plan fear in the hearts of the people all those that listened to that children parents if your father now cannot correct his child why why why you want to whip me for goliath somebody should do it okay let's get back to what we've been talking about but it's a message of intimidation it's a message of intimidation and i believe that's what the devil is doing you know people you know bomb into this uh website and listening to things and listening to people so it's what i've been following the message 40 years this is the reason why i left the message you know and and because of this and because of this and then with your young faith you sit there and say well this man been following this thing for 40 years i just believe the message for five years or 10 years you know what is the need and what happened there is that as long as you have listened to that the devil going to buck you all those that are listening to this message from rashika never slept right they never slept husband and wife started packing their things why because as uh assyria was a superpower at that time they have they have come against all the defense city that's what the scriptures say egypt all the major cities that was around them he said you can't even depend on egypt ask them what we did to them that's right praise the lord so families started packing their lord where they would go they don't know about let's pack because what we have heard trouble is in the camp the children has come to the birth and there is no strength praise the lord now so you you can you go home and read the rest of the the the chapter you will get a full picture here but uh uh as you look into this like i said the challenge here was in whom do you trust you know uh rashika was trying to tell them you can't trust in egypt because we have whipped him you can trust in god because hezekiah has destroyed all his place of worship now those days the nations the power of a nation was determined by the god itself amen praise the lord amen to show that uh uh i mean you were a a nation was was powerful you know uh uh uh even even the even though even the nations that were worshiping the idols believed that it was the the gods that was giving them the power praise the lord that's the reason why the philistines in the book of first king when he hear the israel shouting and rejoicing they said it's because god is in the account praise the lord now so as we look at this tonight uh i want i want to dwell on this i'll speak on this but i just want to to just use this to kind of prepare us for praying tonight the children have come to the birth and there is no strength to bring forth now when when when that time reaches you know where life is about to bring forth and the woman is about to give birth there is one language that is common it's a universal language all around the world one thing they will say to the mother is that she should push so i want to use push tonight for the prayer meeting if we will be able to give birth we must push amen amen if we will be able to give birth we must poach and push is pray until something happen pray until something happened if the church will be able to bring forth life in the church will be able to stand as the church of the living god we must pray we must get in the in in in a praying spirit in the praying hobby now i read something here from brother branham in a few minutes and i think let me just read there that we help that's from the message blind by timos 1957 he said you know there is something about getting along to yourself many people never prayed until they come to church many people think that's the only place to pray is the church but the bible said for men to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and then when we get by ourself we are we will usually pray different than when we would if we pray it in church praise the lord because as as as human you always have that sense of the next person around you you know you are praying to god but you're thinking that the next person is listening to you it's always dead so because of that you never get your best time of praying when you are in church and that's the reason why brother branham never encouraged long prayer in church we usually pray different when we when we rule uh than what we would live if we prayed in church is the secret prayer that jesus spoke of saying enter in enter ye into a secret closet and close the door and when you have you have did so pray to your father who sits in secret and he that serious in secret shall reward thee openly and when and when we are praying like that there there seems to to be something to the prayer that take all the hypocrisy out of faith when you are praying in your closet you know it's you alone you know the door is short you can be able to cry you can be able to to to pour your heart before god and say to god what you want to say praise the lord many times when we in the congregation you know i mean you you pray you're pouring your heart out i mean you really want to express yourself but sometimes you end up speaking in tongues you know i mean you just gotta speak in tongues you gotta pray in tongues sometimes but when you are in your closet and the door is shut i mean you can say those things to god amen you can tell him the things that you are dealing with you can be able to say he says it takes all the hypocrisy out of out of it it seems like that we get in a better connection with god to get along and there's been many times in my life as perhaps in your life that you just have to get along once in a while with jesus i've took my card and drove down the road and just studying after after i got on the highway where it is freed and got off somewhere some country road until i will become so filled with his mercy and his goodness do i just stop the car and held the wheel and whipped like a baby oh i'd identify with that amen praise the lord glory be to god but what we want to talk about tonight is uh prayed until some until something happened so i'm going to take a few calls brother brandon talk about pray don't tell and uh just to be able to encourage us tonight and then uh if the laws uh allow us we talk on on the on the subject when we when we get there but that's that's what happened you know when we get to that time of birth and uh and and the mother cannot be able to bring forth uh the midwives who says push praise the lord amen and uh and i want to be in the place of the midwife tonight just like the place of a woman i want to bring photo and tell you let's push let's pray until things happen in our lives praise the lord amen amen led by the spirit brother branham says did you ever get down and prayed until it comes to a place that you feel like you are walking on clouds prayed until have you ever got down you prayed until and to get to that to that until i mean the devil will not just allow you to get there he won't allow you to get to that place where you will break true you know he will flock your mind with uh i mean things that you forgot to do and things that you have to do and things that you will do and and i mean he would just be bringing all of the things to things that you forgot and you would just keep flooding your mind but you have to keep praying until right now that's the only way we're going to bring for this child we got to pray until that's when you are getting light the bible said in hebrew 11 or chapter 12 seeing that we are compassed about with uh compass about by such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight empty up and the scene that does so easily beside us that we might run with patient the race that is set before us looking to the altar and finisher of our faith the lord jesus so you see when we come to this uh wednesday service i mean we are here till nine o'clock 9 30 we should be out and and heading home to rest and get ready i mean we we can stay the whole night you know and and and uh uh and try to work you up and get in in in the spirit when we have that 10 minutes of time to pray you got to put your heart to it if you will be able to get anything from out of there you got to put your heart into it praise the lord unless we set up the night for praying since it's all night prayer meeting then we know we can pray and pray and pray an hour and two hours and three hours but when we come to this time it's time where we take we take the prayer burdens that are set before us and and we unite our faith and we just we just jump into it together praise the lord but you see these things are difficult to achieve if we don't have our individual prayer life we don't have our individual prayer life if we're not spending time to pray and you come wednesday night it would just look like what kind of a prayer meeting is that that is what it is to you because people that have a that have a prayer life they are already connected let's buy our heads and pray that they are connected the fire is packed and they are gone gave them five minutes to pray they're able to get in their spirit and get that thing done if you don't have a prayer life your mind will just be running all over the place and all floating around and there's no time for that we have a man child christ to bring forth praise the lord are we together amen let's take one again why christ speak brother brandon we're talking about the tabernacle he says one thing that a tabernacle needs update at the church at the tabernacle is a rededication and a refilling of the holy ghost everyone to get down to the altar and pray until they get a renewing of the holy ghost the whole church be filled with the power of god that's what the church needs that's what he promised will be the dynamics of this church it's a refilling of the holy ghost praise the lord i mean people want to to you know we have i mean we we can talk about the mysteries and we can talk about you know uh everything that the scripture says everything that the message says i mean uh they will not they will not have a great deal to our life if we are not on speaking terms with god praise the lord amen you know what it is when you're not on speaking terms with somebody i mean you see them you just you says hi they say hiding and you keep thinking what next should i say when you are on speaking terms with somebody you don't think what mess to say you have the liberty to say anything oh i like your shoes what are you being up to you just break out it's just flowing because you are in speaking terms praise the lord personal experiences is prayed until a personal a personal experience burned down into the hema heart and burned out all the darkness and gave a new vision amen we want to pray until something happened and we can go on and on and on uh yeah conference with god or conference 1960 he says we need the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get-together called together ministers break down their their middle water petition church member get a church member that's all forget the differences between the denominations of churches church members ministers whole to the homes of the altar this hole to the horns of the altar has been mine mine my slogging and when i talk with the brothers he says brother one how are you i'm holding to the hands of the altar so actually when i was studying and i saw brother branham say this i just felt so good in my heart praise the lord hold to the hands of the altar we've won a call and prayed until the fire of god begin to fall praise the lord when we come to that place of the birth i i've talked about that when i'm talking on the subject just uh i just want to encourage you tonight and use these uh cults and prepared ourselves to pray tonight but i mean the the male wife the surgeon the doctor all of them that are there they are there as a support team they're there to encourage you a lot of the work will be done by the mother praise the lord amen and and i think uh that's what uh we need to do that's what we we we try to encourage ourselves to do is now to uh kind of establish a new order or whatever but i just felt in my heart especially with everything that we've been dealing with since the past year with this uh uh you know kovac i think and the many families that we know that uh believers as well as relatives as well as friends that have been dealing with this i believe in in in a time of sadness in a time of sorrow and and when we have all of these things the best way to keep balance is to have a time of prayer when we get to the place where we don't understand we don't we don't have answers for all of our questions the best thing to do is to pray is to pray and when you can just just break through and get into that atmosphere praise the lord what a comfort what a strength it brings musicians you can come for tonight we will do the preaching when the time to preach comes that's one thing you have to you learn with believers you know how to pull from a preacher so if you don't want to preach your message don't get talking because pretty soon they can stop pulling you into your inspiration so i don't want to preach tonight i just want for us to find a time to pray amen whatever time that is given to us let's pray until something happened believing that something will happen there is one other portion of the scripture that i want to read tonight is this verse 14 of chapter 37 the bible says year when hezekiah received the letter verse 14 and hezekiah received a letter from the hands of the messenger and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and he spread the letter before god praise the lord oh i believe that those are some of those are some of the all-time ways the old-time christians they will take their bills and spread it before the lord they will take the doctor paper is spread it before the lord amen [Music] if they have a court case they will take it and just spread it before the lord and say you are the judge i bring this matter to you hezekiah took that took the letter open the envelope rip it he was he didn't care to read what it is just look over it [Music] but he knew that if he put it before god [Music] and sometimes it's the thing that we learn to do sometimes when you just don't have words to say just write it down write god a letter he can read [Music] or the prophet god never knew how to pray he just wrote a few piece of letter lord i don't know you but if you are here i stick this note right here those things are not just done casually they are done with burden there was there was heaviness on his heart heaviness on his heart there is a need the children have come to the birth and there is no strength so he took the letter went to the house of god [Music] and he lay before the altar [Music] whatever you have on your heart tonight you have on your mind whatever is a need in your life physically spiritually health wise naturally we can we can lay our word into the lord leave it there your burning to the lord and leave leave it there if you trust and never doubt [Music] our goal came oh let's sing that one more time yeah just leave it there [Music] and leave it [Music] what a musician's plan you can find your place to pray tonight let's go to the lord and pray let's just thank him tonight let's thank him because
