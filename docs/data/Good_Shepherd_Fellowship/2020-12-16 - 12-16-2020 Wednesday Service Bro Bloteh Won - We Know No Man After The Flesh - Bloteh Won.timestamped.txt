[29:07] in such a time like this praise the lord
[29:10] amen amen
[29:14] and
[29:17] i had a
[29:25] i don't know if i would make this work
[29:26] tonight but
[29:28] uh the lord bless you musicians you can
[29:30] take your seat
[29:32] and then uh we will we will see if we
[29:35] can
[29:36] trust the law to be able to look into
[29:38] the word of the lord
[29:39] but before we we we get into the
[29:42] scripture we want to read tonight in
[29:44] and as i said
[29:48] over in isaiah chapter 40
[29:51] i want us to just uh
[29:55] turn there tonight
[29:59] i will have actually taught to make this
[30:02] a message to speak speak on
[30:06] but uh i will just
[30:09] uh
[30:13] take few verses from there just to be
[30:16] able to encourage us and then we
[30:17] we stand for the reading of the word and
[30:20] then we go into what we want to look at
[30:21] tonight if the lord will just uh
[30:24] be able to help us
[30:32] praise the lord okay you're already
[30:35] standing so
[30:36] then we will use this for the reading of
[30:38] the scripture then
[30:40] isaiah chapter 40 let's read verse one
[30:47] comfort ye comfort ye my people
[30:50] say your god speak here comfortably
[30:54] to jerusalem and cried unto her
[30:58] that her welfare is accomplished
[31:01] and her iniquity is pardoned for she
[31:04] have received of the lord
[31:06] of the lord's hand double for all her
[31:09] sins
[31:11] the voice of him that cried in the
[31:14] wilderness prepared here
[31:15] the word of the lord make straight
[31:19] in the desert a high wing for our god
[31:23] the lord bless you you can have your
[31:24] seed praise the lord
[31:28] this is uh uh very familiar scripture
[31:33] that we that we know and uh
[31:38] as as we have uh
[31:41] said you know well
[31:45] as young people we just did the message
[31:47] you get
[31:48] that we have to read and fellowship
[31:50] around we
[31:51] it's in reading through uh saint john
[31:54] chapter 14
[31:55] in 15 and 16 it speaks a lot about the
[31:58] comforter praise the lord
[32:00] amen and there that's tied in with the
[32:03] spirit of truth
[32:04] god is the one that brings truth comfort
[32:07] a strange year that god is is bringing
[32:10] uh comfort to jerusalem and
[32:14] in a way that is completely different
[32:16] from the way that
[32:17] that man would bring comfort amen
[32:20] and and in a way that sometimes we we
[32:23] try to
[32:25] comfort ourselves or come for one
[32:27] another
[32:28] uh it's a way that sometimes we
[32:32] we try to uh uh
[32:35] either uh you know sympathize for
[32:39] the situation that the person might be
[32:41] in
[32:42] god here is bringing a comfort to
[32:45] jerusalem
[32:46] in a very different way by sending them
[32:49] a voice of one crying in the wilderness
[32:52] praise the lord but this is actually now
[32:54] where my thought is
[32:56] on on this chapter my thought
[32:59] is actually
[33:02] to the last few verses of isaiah chapter
[33:06] 40
[33:06] 14. and i just want to do
[33:10] uh uh a little a little thing here i
[33:13] wish i had a
[33:14] hearty uh uh kind of
[33:17] uh drone out in the picture yeah so
[33:21] so you it can be able to grab your mind
[33:23] but you will realize
[33:24] as god is talking to israel this waiting
[33:27] sin
[33:28] and announcing a forerunner that we come
[33:31] before the the messiah before our lord
[33:35] jesus
[33:35] we know that john the baptist ministry
[33:38] fit right in there so he was supposed to
[33:40] be a comforter to the people
[33:42] in a way that god was going to comfort
[33:45] jerusalem every valley
[33:47] will be exalted in every mountains you
[33:50] know
[33:50] and and and like brother branham says
[33:52] the people might have been looking at
[33:54] the the physical valley and mountains
[33:57] but you know
[33:57] uh uh uh
[34:01] john the baptist was going to bring a
[34:03] message you know that we condemn the
[34:05] corrupt
[34:06] leaders of that day and the people that
[34:08] have exalted himself with proud and
[34:11] and herald and herodotus and all the
[34:13] things that they were doing
[34:15] he would bring a message that would
[34:16] speak to them and you can read down and
[34:18] read the entire chapter
[34:20] but as he closes the chapter he closed
[34:23] it with a very beautiful
[34:25] beautiful writing that caught my
[34:27] attention and i want to speak on that a
[34:29] little bit
[34:30] then we go into our subject for tonight
[34:33] he says here
[34:40] as we get down to the last few verses
[34:43] in the chapter
[34:47] verse 27 why sarah there oh jacob
[34:50] and speaketh o israel my
[34:54] my weight is here from the lord and my
[34:56] judgment is passed over
[34:58] from my god praise the lord
[35:01] have thou not known have that not heard
[35:05] that the everlasting god the lord the
[35:08] creator
[35:09] of the ends of the earth fainted
[35:12] net i want you to underline that were
[35:15] fainted in your mind
[35:17] neither is wearing also on the line
[35:21] the word wear it in your mind there is
[35:23] no searching
[35:25] of his understanding amen the lord
[35:29] the everlasting god the creator of the
[35:32] ends
[35:33] of the earth he faint ned and he is not
[35:36] weary
[35:37] he gave a power to the faint
[35:40] and to them that have no might
[35:43] he increases strength
[35:47] even the youth shall faint and be wary
[35:52] and a young man shall all
[35:55] shall utterly fall but they
[35:58] that wait upon the lord shall renew
[36:01] their strength
[36:03] they shall mount up with wings as
[36:06] eagle eagles they shall run
[36:10] and not be wary they shall
[36:13] walk and not faint amen
[36:16] praise the lord amen
[36:20] praise the lord
[36:24] i got a christmas gift here a big prank
[36:27] bible so i'm just enjoying myself
[36:30] amen now now uh what what i want us to
[36:34] look at
[36:34] here you you we have to realize
[36:37] that as i one time he says
[36:41] you know this is the way walking in it
[36:43] don't turn to the right
[36:44] if you want to turn to the left
[36:48] as i have such a style of writing if you
[36:51] go back in
[36:52] and read the history of azai a little
[36:55] bit you have to know that this was a man
[36:57] that was framed to the king yuzir you
[37:00] know they were they were all friends so
[37:02] it kind of
[37:03] show us a little bit that alzheimer uh
[37:06] uh he had he has some privilege and
[37:10] uh and he gave him to the place where
[37:13] he he was he was inspired the kind of a
[37:17] grace and gift that he had it made him
[37:20] to write in such a way that
[37:22] i mean when you read his writing it's
[37:25] almost like
[37:26] just like reading a psalm he had
[37:29] he had a special way of writing but i
[37:31] want for us to look a few things here
[37:33] that he lay out
[37:34] in this reading that we have just read
[37:37] he talks
[37:38] about the way of a man when a man
[37:42] is born on a child is born
[37:45] that child with it in the hands
[37:49] of the mother and after the while
[37:53] the child starts to walk
[37:56] and after the wide the child starts
[38:00] to run and after the white the child
[38:03] stands
[38:04] to fly praise the lord
[38:08] these are different stages and as i was
[38:11] reading this and
[38:12] and studying it i could not help but
[38:15] look
[38:15] at the four anointing that have gathered
[38:18] the church
[38:19] you know you can t take the waiting
[38:21] anointing axe
[38:22] the ox bearer you know the ox he's the
[38:25] burden bearer he's there he knows how to
[38:27] bed
[38:28] and that's that's uh uh uh and and and
[38:32] uh uh the the anointing of the man he
[38:35] walks
[38:35] in a walk with god and uh
[38:38] uh the anointing of a lion he runs
[38:42] you know no one can run faster than the
[38:44] lion when he gets out there to get his
[38:47] prey
[38:47] and the anointing of the ego he flies
[38:51] praise the lord so right in this little
[38:54] little thing that isaiah is speaking
[38:56] here to israel
[38:58] after telling them about the
[39:01] account of comfort that would come to
[39:04] them
[39:04] he's he's he's he's speaking to them uh
[39:07] have you not known this god the one that
[39:10] you have
[39:11] to deal with it's not a god that you
[39:15] have made by your hands
[39:18] it's a god that has made you
[39:22] praise the lord amen and this
[39:25] god he do not faint
[39:29] he do not worry
[39:33] praise the lord the one that we have to
[39:35] deal with
[39:37] that's the kind of god and there is no
[39:39] searching
[39:40] you know of his understanding
[39:44] the more we read his word
[39:48] the more we get to know about him
[39:51] praise the lord and the more we get to
[39:54] love him
[39:55] praise the lord and so you see
[39:58] here and and and there is a way
[40:03] that you can also apply this as you look
[40:06] at it
[40:07] uh in my little sketch here
[40:10] i have uh like like
[40:14] like he says here he says but they that
[40:17] wait upon the lord
[40:19] shall renew their strength they shall
[40:21] man up
[40:22] with wings as an ego the eagles fly
[40:26] amen they shall run
[40:29] and that be wary you know
[40:33] a man's that run
[40:36] if you run and then just run by yourself
[40:40] and
[40:40] run and run and run you will get weary
[40:43] amen you will lose strength and pretty
[40:45] soon you go
[40:48] praise the lord hallelujah
[40:52] and i mean you can go for walk
[40:57] and uh uh and you know walk and walk
[41:00] shut the mice and you know
[41:02] and then you also faint i mean you get
[41:04] you get tired
[41:06] so that but there is something that is
[41:08] hidden here
[41:11] and uh the bible talk about
[41:14] inner that walk with god and he was
[41:17] not the bible also speaks about elijah
[41:21] you remember when elijah told
[41:25] ahab run because i can hear
[41:28] the sound of the abundance of rain
[41:32] and the bible says there was the cloud
[41:34] was moving
[41:35] in the heavens in the form of a man's
[41:37] hand
[41:38] and then uh and and they have got on his
[41:41] character
[41:42] and and and he starts to run
[41:46] and he and uh but elijah didn't have a
[41:48] child but yet elijah could run more
[41:50] faster than they have
[41:52] praise the lord amen
[41:56] and uh one of these days you know we
[42:00] sing the song i fly
[42:02] away to glory amen
[42:05] that's our promise so we see all of
[42:07] these steps
[42:08] of life i want you to follow me
[42:12] here kind of for speaking in in in a
[42:15] kind of a
[42:16] proverb way to you tonight all of these
[42:18] stages of life
[42:20] let me take another example brother
[42:23] branham says emergency causes
[42:25] desperation
[42:27] he says if there was an emergency that
[42:29] should come here tonight we will get
[42:31] desperate and there are things that you
[42:33] will know
[42:33] you will you will see or realize of
[42:36] yourself that you never knew amen
[42:38] and how fast you can run how you know
[42:41] how quick you can jump in
[42:43] and all of those things and and and all
[42:46] of those things i
[42:47] aim the ability of men
[42:50] praise the lord amen to walk
[42:54] to run in one of these days
[42:57] to fly amen
[43:00] man uh learning all of these things and
[43:03] you know and things
[43:04] that is there but
[43:07] there is a secret year
[43:11] and you think about all the men that
[43:14] give their lives
[43:16] and and and religion that also teaches
[43:19] men
[43:20] to to give their lives uh
[43:23] for some kind of a reward amen
[43:28] and if if if we
[43:31] ever get to the place where our faith
[43:35] is put to the test whether we would die
[43:38] for the lord
[43:40] or denied our faith i believe that by
[43:43] god's grace
[43:44] we would die for the word amen praise
[43:46] the lord
[43:47] i believe that we have that hope in our
[43:50] heart
[43:51] you know so we can do all of these
[43:52] things
[43:54] but there is one secret year that is
[43:57] bringing to us
[43:59] the secret is
[44:03] they that wait on the lord
[44:09] praise the lord
[44:12] christian faith many christians have
[44:14] done
[44:15] work for christ and the people will wear
[44:18] their t-shirt and they will walk
[44:20] the walk mass and walk mass
[44:23] and then it can do a run for jesus
[44:27] and it will all run one of the things
[44:31] that challenge our faith is to wait
[44:39] praise the lord if we should pro plan to
[44:42] do a work for christ we always show
[44:44] up and we'll be ready we get our water
[44:47] bottle and
[44:48] everything
[44:51] but they that wait on the lord
[45:00] they that wait on the lord and you see
[45:03] the way that isaiah
[45:05] wrote this thing he put the secret
[45:11] of not being weary in weight
[45:15] he put the secret of not fainting
[45:19] in weight he put the
[45:23] secret of being able to fly
[45:26] in wait
[45:31] they that wait on the lord
[45:36] and if you can wait on god you will run
[45:38] and you will get weary
[45:44] if you can wait on god you will walk
[45:48] and one of these days you will throw in
[45:49] the towel
[45:57] praise the lord well is that just my own
[46:01] personal devotion i'm sharing with you
[46:04] it's uh it was it was a kind of a unique
[46:06] way to be able to look at
[46:08] what the prophet was writing is
[46:11] it really caught my attention it really
[46:14] really caught my attention and there
[46:16] with me in a different way
[46:17] and i hope it do the same to you praise
[46:20] the lord
[46:21] amen amen
[46:24] they that wait on the lord
[46:28] shall renew their strength teach us to
[46:31] wait
[46:33] amen teach us to wait
[46:37] may god teach us to wait
[46:43] may god teach us to wait i have to
[46:46] remember bill blam says god is not in a
[46:48] hurry
[46:51] he's not in a hurry if you
[46:54] if you don't have that grace to just
[46:57] wait on god and i mean we want things to
[47:02] happen you know we want the rapture to
[47:04] come we want
[47:05] god to fulfill things in our life
[47:08] but the secret is in waiting
[47:12] praise the lord may he teach us to wait
[47:16] amen wait wait for the lord
[47:19] in prayer with for the lord and sons

[49:33] passed away
[49:34] behold all things are
[49:38] become new amen
[49:42] now so we will take that and and and
[49:45] brother branham speaks here in the
[49:48] message uh
[49:50] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[49:53] says
[49:54] the the new birth
[49:58] it's a revelation god has revealed to
[50:01] you this great mystery
[50:06] and and that's a new birth
[50:10] now what you are going to do
[50:13] when you get all that group together
[50:17] where the revelation is specifically in
[50:20] harmony
[50:21] and god expressing it through his word
[50:24] by the same action the same thing
[50:28] that he did making the word manifest oh
[50:31] if the church only knew its position
[50:36] praise the lord that's what he said in
[50:39] the revelation
[50:40] revelation series if the church knew
[50:43] her position amen
[50:46] he says if the church only knew his
[50:48] position
[50:50] it will one day then the rapture
[50:53] will go when it knows
[50:57] what it is what the church
[51:00] is what is the church what is this
[51:03] church that's been redeemed
[51:05] by the blood of the lamb
[51:08] it's not the name tags that we call
[51:10] ourself
[51:12] this church is the bride of jesus christ
[51:16] amen this church is the lamb's wife
[51:22] this church is the one that is flesh
[51:25] of his flesh amen
[51:29] just like when god gave adam his wife
[51:36] was flesh of his flesh and born of his
[51:39] bone
[51:39] spirit of his spirit that's what the
[51:43] church is
[51:44] now if the church only knows its
[51:47] position
[51:48] it will warn day now you have to
[51:51] remember now this is christ it's the
[51:53] mystery of god reveal
[51:56] what is the position of the church to
[51:59] christ
[52:00] what is her place is to give him the
[52:04] preeminence
[52:09] amen is to give him the preeminence
[52:20] it will one day
[52:24] then the rapture will go
[52:27] when it knows what it is praise the lord
[52:34] amen you just think about
[52:37] esther in the kingdom
[52:41] praise the lord
[52:44] all that mother kind
[52:49] was trying to do is to help esther
[52:53] know her position
[52:56] praise the lord now you have to realize
[53:00] that
[53:00] she was a jewish girl that got married
[53:04] to this gentile king there is a way
[53:07] of word uh uh it's it's easy
[53:10] for her to feel a little bit uh
[53:14] you know um uh inferior for how to feel
[53:19] you know a kind of a complex
[53:22] praise the lord
[53:26] uncle molokai encourager and
[53:30] and you know uh for her to go down
[53:33] there and and become one of those
[53:36] virgins
[53:37] to become a bride and and
[53:41] yes the king has married her
[53:45] and she's in the kingdom but they will
[53:48] just
[53:49] stay this place word she feels like uh
[53:54] i mean she's uh just like a stranger
[53:58] and all of these things going through
[53:59] her mind
[54:02] mother cat is encouraging her trying to
[54:05] help her
[54:06] to realize for her to find her place
[54:10] for her to be able to know who she is
[54:16] as long as she would have stayed in a
[54:19] kind of a mindset
[54:20] that she had at a time where the jews
[54:24] were
[54:24] were on a persecution like mordecai said
[54:27] you have to remember
[54:29] you're also a jew maybe god has raised
[54:32] you up for this
[54:33] hour praise the lord
[54:37] amen and i believe that's the reason why
[54:40] god has raised this bride up is for this
[54:43] hour that we are living in
[54:47] praise the lord it's for this hour where
[54:50] we pass the thought of just being church
[54:52] member
[54:53] where we are just identified with a
[54:55] church or identified with the message
[54:59] we are to the place word there will be a
[55:01] bride that will be a people because only
[55:03] the bride
[55:05] can give christ the preeminence
[55:09] amen and like brother branham says here
[55:12] it comes by that new birth he says the
[55:15] new birth is
[55:16] a revelation it has to be a revelation
[55:22] in a a a a wife to catch that revelation
[55:26] that
[55:26] um you know even though he's from a
[55:28] different family i'm from a different
[55:30] family
[55:30] the the the the blessing the the
[55:33] covenant of
[55:34] marriage has made us
[55:37] flesh off his flesh praise the lord
[55:43] are you are you understanding me amen
[55:47] that's why he's he's he's telling us the
[55:50] new birth
[55:51] is a revelation it brings us to a
[55:54] revelation
[55:55] that we are not church members
[55:58] amen no we are not church members
[56:01] we are sons and daughters of god
[56:05] we're not just trying this thing to see
[56:07] if it will work out
[56:08] it has to be a birth it has to be
[56:12] a change of nature it has to be an
[56:15] experience that make us to desire christ
[56:20] praise the lord we're not trying it to
[56:23] say well let me try to see if i will
[56:25] if it will work
[56:28] it's a revelation
[56:33] that make us to know he's my father
[56:38] praise the lord
[56:43] i came from god
[56:47] i appreciate my earthly parents but i
[56:50] realize
[56:51] by this new birth and constant desire
[56:58] to be like him
[57:02] are we together the new birth is a
[57:05] revelation
[57:06] god has revealed to you this great
[57:09] mystery
[57:10] it's not just on it knowing that jesus
[57:13] is god ignoring
[57:14] that you know about what a baptism
[57:16] ignoring no
[57:18] it's the mystery that makes you to also
[57:20] realize
[57:22] you are part of him
[57:26] amen you are part of him
[57:35] are we together praise the lord
[57:41] and then he goes ahead a little bit
[57:42] christ is the mystery of god we continue
[57:44] to hear
[57:45] he says did you know this paul
[57:49] never knew jesus physically
[57:52] amen paul never knew him the only way
[57:57] that paul knew him was by
[58:00] a revelation by a vision
[58:06] is that right paul
[58:09] only knew jesus by a revelation
[58:15] he saw the vision amen
[58:19] the light met him on the road of
[58:20] damascus he saw the vision he said lord
[58:23] whoa he never knew jesus
[58:28] at the age of paul he was living the
[58:30] very same time that jesus was earth
[58:32] on earth but he never met him physically
[58:36] praise the lord but being a student of
[58:39] the word
[58:41] being taught
[58:45] in the jewish religion he knew what the
[58:48] pillar of fire that led
[58:49] the children of israel he knew that
[58:52] light
[58:54] praise the lord and when when when the
[58:58] light strucks him
[58:59] he says what our lord
[59:03] amen he knew that it was the same light
[59:06] that met
[59:06] moses at the back side of the desert
[59:10] but now strange to him he heard
[59:14] i'm jesus whoa
[59:19] praise the lord strange he heard
[59:22] i'm jesus whom you are persecuting
[59:27] because it's hard to kick against the
[59:29] praise
[59:31] are we together now so
[59:34] we realized he had like brother barnum
[59:36] said he never knew jesus
[59:37] physically he knew jesus only
[59:41] by a revelation he come down he says
[59:45] peter has seen him in the flesh peter
[59:47] has seen jesus in the flesh
[59:50] but he didn't know him by flesh
[59:57] amen because jesus says so flesh
[1:00:01] and blood they didn't reveal it to you
[1:00:05] when he asked them who do men think that
[1:00:08] i
[1:00:08] the son of man am praise the lord
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:18] peter said there i cried son of the
[1:00:22] living god
[1:00:24] and jesus said simon flesh and blood
[1:00:26] never relay this to you
[1:00:29] it was a revelation
[1:00:32] praise the lord now you think about this
[1:00:35] now
[1:00:37] paul knew jesus by
[1:00:41] a revelation a vision he saw the light
[1:00:45] and jesus i'm jesus whom the hour
[1:00:48] persecuting
[1:00:48] now that is the same thing that the new
[1:00:51] birth does to you
[1:00:52] and myself amen
[1:00:56] the new birth introduced jesus the same
[1:00:59] way that paul
[1:01:01] met jesus the same way that peter met
[1:01:04] jesus
[1:01:05] the new birth brings that introduction
[1:01:08] to you and myself
[1:01:11] it makes it personal
[1:01:14] some said that thou james some said that
[1:01:17] you are jeremiah he says
[1:01:19] what do you say what is your own
[1:01:21] personal experience and the place was
[1:01:24] quiet
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:32] praise the lord paul says here
[1:01:38] in corinthians henceforth we know no man
[1:01:43] after the flesh praise the lord
[1:01:47] now you see that is the problem there
[1:01:50] are the the people
[1:01:51] that are having problems with the
[1:01:53] message that is the problem
[1:01:56] because if you know brother branham by
[1:01:58] the flesh or you know
[1:01:59] the messenger of this age
[1:02:03] just by everything that is uh uh from
[1:02:06] his kentucky birth
[1:02:07] and everything that is said on tabin and
[1:02:09] and and the life that he leave
[1:02:11] and really never got a revelation
[1:02:16] amen praise the lord because who
[1:02:20] is the messenger of the exeter
[1:02:23] who is the messenger of
[1:02:27] the exeter praise the lord
[1:02:31] something just struck my mind just now
[1:02:34] praise the lord
[1:02:36] amen but jordan if you can just help me
[1:02:39] put that picture
[1:02:40] of brother branham in the pillow of fire
[1:02:45] if you can just help me and put that
[1:02:46] there
[1:02:48] put it up
[1:02:51] praise the lord
[1:02:58] are we together

[1:03:28] if you can put that picture up for me
[1:03:31] and i just send
[1:03:32] uh i just sent a call
[1:03:35] back there i want to use that tonight

[1:03:40] would go in that direction but
[1:03:42] i just i just throw something up there
[1:03:45] if you just want to put that picture up
[1:03:46] we just
[1:03:47] have a few minutes here
[1:03:51] henceforth we know no man after the
[1:03:56] flesh
[1:04:01] praise the lord now so we see here
[1:04:07] that he said the new birth is christ
[1:04:11] it's a revelation
[1:04:12] god has revealed to you this great
[1:04:14] mystery
[1:04:16] praise the lord
[1:04:20] amen now now
[1:04:24] this is a familiar picture that we all
[1:04:26] we all know about
[1:04:28] uh uh we have seen we know
[1:04:31] we know the the the story behind it
[1:04:34] but uh uh uh if you can then just throw
[1:04:38] that quote that i had
[1:04:41] i just sent to you back there
[1:04:44] brother branham said this
[1:04:47] this he says but this picture
[1:04:52] here not because dear christian
[1:04:58] that aha is not
[1:05:02] me i just happen to be standing there
[1:05:09] that was all
[1:05:12] but this is the picture of
[1:05:15] a supernatural being
[1:05:19] and to my opinion if you notice
[1:05:22] it is the pillow of fire now what i
[1:05:25] would
[1:05:25] say to this is that
[1:05:29] we have made the picture more of brother
[1:05:34] branham
[1:05:36] when he's saying our justinity
[1:05:41] the picture is not of brother branham
[1:05:46] are we are we are we together we have
[1:05:48] made the picture
[1:05:50] more of brother brennan and less
[1:05:53] of what actually god was doing now you
[1:05:56] have to remember
[1:05:58] that uh brother branham was not
[1:06:01] he never even wanted to go up that night
[1:06:05] he said he was sitting in the crowd
[1:06:08] when when brother boswell told him to go
[1:06:11] up he said no he never wanted to go up
[1:06:13] to go and face mr best
[1:06:17] praise the lord mr best was tearing down
[1:06:20] divine healing
[1:06:23] he was tearing the testimony of divine
[1:06:26] healing
[1:06:29] are we together amen
[1:06:33] so when brother brennan went up that's
[1:06:36] that's why we talked
[1:06:37] about god vindicating his word
[1:06:41] god don't vindicate a man god vinnicate
[1:06:44] his word
[1:06:49] what was the question that was asked
[1:06:52] about the redemptive blessing
[1:06:57] all the redemptive in the old testament
[1:07:02] is it attributed to jesus christ
[1:07:06] so god in honor vindicating his word
[1:07:10] divine healing that he is the same god
[1:07:14] that saved
[1:07:15] the same god that healed amen
[1:07:18] amen praise the lord
[1:07:22] are we together
[1:07:25] because henceforth we know no
[1:07:28] man after the flesh
[1:07:36] are we together praise the lord
[1:07:41] because if a man stands on
[1:07:44] god's word if he preaches
[1:07:47] god's word now greta branham will say
[1:07:51] after all of his message
[1:07:52] if what i have preached to you is the
[1:07:54] truth
[1:07:56] he said god would come and vindicate it
[1:08:03] now god would come and vindicate me
[1:08:06] god will come and vindicate his word
[1:08:12] because we don't have to do with man we
[1:08:15] have to do with word
[1:08:17] the word of god which is the original
[1:08:20] seed
[1:08:21] spoken word is the original seed
[1:08:25] suddenly we were talking about the sea
[1:08:27] principle
[1:08:29] amen after
[1:08:33] the the the uh the serpent came
[1:08:36] and makes a seed
[1:08:39] and then god dared in in genesis says
[1:08:43] the end of all flesh has come
[1:08:46] god was spotting the end to dealing with
[1:08:50] flesh
[1:08:52] he went back to start dealing with the
[1:08:54] seed that was the promise he gave to
[1:08:56] abraham
[1:08:57] your seed shall possess the gifts of the
[1:09:00] enemy
[1:09:03] praise the lord amen
[1:09:06] that's the reason why jacob
[1:09:10] we know that he was a supplanter he he
[1:09:13] tricks he tell lies
[1:09:14] but there was something in him that was
[1:09:17] desiring the breath right
[1:09:20] and that was the thing that god had
[1:09:21] respect told
[1:09:24] god never had respect to his ethnic
[1:09:27] nature
[1:09:29] amen that was cheating and lying it was
[1:09:33] that thing that was giving him the
[1:09:34] desire
[1:09:36] to want the breath right
[1:09:41] praise the lord because god was dealing
[1:09:44] with the seed
[1:09:49] that was what he told the woman the seed
[1:09:51] of the woman will possess the gifts of
[1:09:54] the enemy
[1:09:55] thank you brother jordy thank you for
[1:09:58] for helping me bearing with me yeah
[1:10:01] putting that uh praise the lord
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:07] and and that that that is just not even
[1:10:09] the only quote that brother brandon
[1:10:10] mentioned
[1:10:11] that on on talking about that light
[1:10:16] are we together now so you can see
[1:10:20] the same way that god out there in
[1:10:23] in corinthian paul said after jesus
[1:10:25] resurrected
[1:10:26] he revealed himself to 500 at the same
[1:10:29] time he says and this one saw him he
[1:10:31] says well i was the least
[1:10:32] i saw him too but paul never saw him
[1:10:37] in a physical body paul saw him
[1:10:40] by revelation
[1:10:44] god giving him an understanding
[1:10:48] praise the lord that the jehovah of the
[1:10:50] old testament
[1:10:51] is the jesus of the new testament
[1:10:55] are we together
[1:11:00] god giving him an understanding a
[1:11:03] revelation
[1:11:07] and that's the same thing that the new
[1:11:10] birth
[1:11:12] give to you and myself it gives us a
[1:11:16] revelation
[1:11:19] to be able to identify the god that has
[1:11:22] caught
[1:11:22] us and also to know our place
[1:11:27] to the one that has caught us he didn't
[1:11:30] just call us to be church members
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:38] no
[1:11:40] if you call us to be church member yeah
[1:11:42] well it's good we can go around looking
[1:11:44] for the best church and looking for the
[1:11:45] good church and all of that but he
[1:11:47] called you to be a son
[1:11:49] or a daughter of god wherever you find
[1:11:52] yourself
[1:11:56] are we together
[1:12:00] henceforth we know no man after the
[1:12:03] flesh
[1:12:05] now i'm gonna i'm gonna just draw my
[1:12:07] hair right here
[1:12:08] because i took my time on this day that
[1:12:11] wait upon the lord
[1:12:13] amen so we realize here
[1:12:18] the first covenant
[1:12:22] when god
[1:12:26] was dealing with abraham there i mean uh
[1:12:29] uh adam did in the in the
[1:12:32] in the garden of eden
[1:12:37] it was it was god was dealing with him
[1:12:41] in the flesh
[1:12:42] and he fell and god had to become
[1:12:45] man god had to take flesh now
[1:12:49] you watch now the scripture make us to
[1:12:51] know
[1:12:53] that uh the word
[1:12:56] was made flesh amen
[1:13:01] that was jesus the word was
[1:13:04] made flesh
[1:13:07] but you have to see this time how the
[1:13:09] word was made flesh
[1:13:16] god going back to the seed
[1:13:20] now he have to bring our lord jesus
[1:13:25] without uh uh
[1:13:29] no human sensation
[1:13:34] praise the lord amen now the word
[1:13:38] becoming flesh this time now what i want
[1:13:42] you to keep
[1:13:42] in your in in your mind is the we just
[1:13:46] been talking about the different
[1:13:48] bodies amen
[1:13:53] and when we are taught that we will
[1:13:55] never be angers
[1:13:58] praise the lord we will always be human
[1:14:01] because we were we were made to inhabit
[1:14:04] the earth
[1:14:08] praise the lord so when the word
[1:14:12] become flesh it was the word become
[1:14:16] flesh to take
[1:14:17] us back to our original state
[1:14:24] praise the lord because god put in an
[1:14:27] end to all flesh is the curse
[1:14:31] upon this the the flesh desire
[1:14:39] and that's where we are called
[1:14:42] to be able to bring this body
[1:14:45] in submission to the world
[1:14:49] because the word is our husband
[1:14:52] that's where the preeminence is where
[1:14:55] you make the world first
[1:14:57] over your desire your fleshly desire
[1:15:02] because your desire will be to your
[1:15:04] husband
[1:15:05] and the word is your hustle
[1:15:09] so your ability your your work now
[1:15:12] as a wife as a church
[1:15:15] is to bring yourself
[1:15:19] in submissive to the word of god
[1:15:24] they that wait upon the lord
[1:15:29] amen praise the lord
[1:15:34] that's where the mystery is
[1:15:39] oh we want to speak and the sun must
[1:15:42] stand still
[1:15:43] we want to we we we want to bring the
[1:15:45] power back in the church
[1:15:47] but where is it it's in submission
[1:15:55] is in submission
[1:15:59] that was the revelation that was that
[1:16:01] jesus was
[1:16:02] embodying god of heaven himself
[1:16:05] subjected himself
[1:16:09] to his own lord
[1:16:13] amen the creator of heaven of heaven and
[1:16:17] earth
[1:16:17] he subjected himself
[1:16:22] to be able to redeem you and myself he
[1:16:25] has to come
[1:16:26] by the weight of the womb
[1:16:29] amen he had to taste the form
[1:16:33] of every he comes through that sea lion
[1:16:36] god himself producing the blood and and
[1:16:39] and exhale he came through that line he
[1:16:42] subjected himself
[1:16:46] that's the only way we can get anywhere
[1:16:48] with god
[1:16:50] is to submit ourselves to the world
[1:16:53] that's what christian life is constantly
[1:16:56] submitting yourself to the world
[1:16:57] not lifting your head up and thinking
[1:16:59] you are better than anybody and all
[1:17:01] these people they are going to hell
[1:17:03] and and no no no no it's every day you
[1:17:06] live in submission
[1:17:07] to the word of god
[1:17:13] we bring our thoughts in submission we
[1:17:16] bring our desire in submission
[1:17:18] we don't allow this everything and
[1:17:20] material things to pull us
[1:17:22] and drag us because that's what we are
[1:17:27] think about it the creator of heaven and
[1:17:30] earth he
[1:17:30] subjected himself to his own lord
[1:17:35] he never even had a house
[1:17:41] where the night meets him he said foxes
[1:17:44] have hoard
[1:17:45] the birds have net but the son of man
[1:17:49] don't have a place to lay his head he
[1:17:52] had to borrow
[1:17:53] a stable to be born
[1:17:56] what was god showing us
[1:18:03] borrowing a grave to be buried
[1:18:07] how to borrow the boat to preach
[1:18:13] what was he showing us but yet he had
[1:18:16] ten thousand cattles on the hill
[1:18:24] praise the lord
[1:18:27] and you know what this age
[1:18:32] is our age
[1:18:35] praise the lord and one of
[1:18:38] the devil in this age is material things
[1:18:45] it's material things praise the lord
[1:18:50] and that's the reason why the false
[1:18:52] church
[1:18:53] has grabbed the people on the prosperity
[1:18:56] gospel
[1:18:57] that you can prove your christianity by
[1:18:59] the car you are driving
[1:19:01] or the house you are living in
[1:19:05] amen when the god of heaven and earth
[1:19:08] says
[1:19:09] you are my little bride but man i'm
[1:19:12] talking about
[1:19:14] that ranger over in chicago coming to
[1:19:17] look for the bride
[1:19:21] when he came down to look for the bride
[1:19:24] he went down and saw the party and
[1:19:26] everything he left the people in the
[1:19:28] feast
[1:19:29] and he came walking in the pool
[1:19:32] neighborhood and saw the little
[1:19:36] little seven girl she was a
[1:19:39] seventh girl she was a
[1:19:42] seventh girl that's what the holy ghost
[1:19:45] would make you to be
[1:19:47] it will make you to be jehovah seven
[1:19:51] saw a seven girl
[1:19:55] wasting some ditch water outside
[1:19:58] praise the lord she says wow
[1:20:02] she don't look like them even though she
[1:20:05] never had
[1:20:06] the best dress on she never had no shoes
[1:20:10] on her feet
[1:20:12] praise the lord but he was captured to
[1:20:15] her character
[1:20:17] and the only character he saw in her
[1:20:19] that he loved
[1:20:21] is that she was a seven because our god
[1:20:24] is a seven
[1:20:28] praise the lord
[1:20:37] it's only the bride that we give
[1:20:41] christ the preeminence not my will
[1:20:46] but die be done
[1:20:50] though you slay me yet i will trust you
[1:20:56] amen praise the lord
[1:21:02] under the bride will give christ the
[1:21:05] preeminence
[1:21:06] because that is the revelation that the
[1:21:09] woman
[1:21:10] captured to submit
[1:21:14] herself her strength
[1:21:17] is in submission
[1:21:22] the strength of the church
[1:21:25] is in how much we submit to the world
[1:21:30] how much we submit to the word not
[1:21:33] argue with the word amen now fuss with
[1:21:37] the word
[1:21:38] the strength of the church that's the
[1:21:41] thing that will change
[1:21:42] our body is how much we submit to the
[1:21:45] word
[1:21:49] they that wait upon the lord he shall
[1:21:52] renew their strength
[1:21:54] that's the thing that is hard to do to
[1:21:56] wait
[1:21:58] you just tell somebody wait for me i'm
[1:22:01] coming
[1:22:02] how long you'll be here
[1:22:05] oh yeah you said you were coming ever
[1:22:06] since what are you doing
[1:22:14] it's just so hard it's hard for us to
[1:22:17] just stand still
[1:22:20] it's hard for us to just sit just sit
[1:22:23] and read the bible sit and listen to a
[1:22:26] message
[1:22:31] just sit and get into
[1:22:35] the spirit of the word that's the thing
[1:22:38] that is hard to do
[1:22:41] we can go with the music
[1:22:44] we can go with the singing and the
[1:22:46] dancing but to just sit and say lord
[1:22:48] feel me
[1:22:50] say god speak to me our mind
[1:22:54] you know why you're going everywhere
[1:22:56] thinking about days thinking about
[1:22:58] things that we're not supposed to think
[1:22:59] about the devil throwing thoughts our
[1:23:01] mind
[1:23:01] just to just say it and say god speak to
[1:23:04] me
[1:23:05] lord speak to me speak to me address
[1:23:09] something in my life
[1:23:13] give me the holy ghost
[1:23:16] while the preacher is preaching
[1:23:20] be with me just just to be there
[1:23:34] henceforth we know no man about the
[1:23:36] flesh
[1:23:38] we don't charge azealia's brother
[1:23:42] by the flesh no
[1:23:45] we look at the sea amen
[1:23:49] we look at the seed
[1:23:52] because spoken word is the original seed
[1:23:56] brother branham said one thing here i
[1:23:58] read from spoken word is the original
[1:24:00] see a close
[1:24:01] tonight he says
[1:24:05] how was christ the seed of abraham
[1:24:11] amen how was he the seed of abraham
[1:24:14] he says not in so much his body
[1:24:22] not in not in his body why because
[1:24:25] abraham was born by athlete parents
[1:24:29] he was born by sex so
[1:24:32] how was christ the seed of abraham not
[1:24:35] by the flesh
[1:24:39] amen but by his faith
[1:24:43] by the sea faith
[1:24:50] how was he the son of david not by the
[1:24:56] flesh
[1:25:00] i see where i'm going tonight
[1:25:03] not by the flesh
[1:25:09] and that's the reason why john says we
[1:25:11] are born again
[1:25:13] by the incorruptable seed
[1:25:16] by the incorruptible seed
[1:25:22] spoken word is the original seed brother
[1:25:24] branham said
[1:25:26] he said oh my god
[1:25:30] he said you can't be a seed and
[1:25:33] disagree with the word
[1:25:38] no because your birth comes by that word
[1:25:46] it comes by that seed
[1:25:49] when we talk about being born again not
[1:25:51] being identified with a church
[1:25:54] is not in our dress code it's the inside
[1:25:58] of the inside our desire
[1:26:04] the things we are desiring to be more
[1:26:07] like him
[1:26:09] let's buy our heads together tonight
[1:26:34] did i wait upon the lord let you sing
[1:26:37] there
[1:26:37] and then we pray together

[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:42] you see the mistake that we made on
[1:31:45] waiting on god
[1:31:47] you have to realize that god is not in
[1:31:49] time
[1:31:50] he's in tanner so you cannot put a time
[1:31:54] to god promise
[1:31:55] you can say well i've been waiting on
[1:31:57] god for five years i've been waiting on
[1:31:59] golf
[1:32:00] you can't god is internal
[1:32:03] until he until god does it
[1:32:07] you have to wait
[1:32:12] most of us we put god on our time
[1:32:16] instead of being on god's time when you
[1:32:18] get on god's time
[1:32:19] you are rolling through eternity
[1:32:34] the secret to wait on god is to submit
[1:32:38] to his word
[1:32:40] is to say be it unto me i call into your
[1:32:42] word
[1:32:44] and so say not my will but let your will
[1:32:46] be done
[1:32:50] it's not to be looking through the
[1:32:51] windows or looking over your shoulder or
[1:32:54] looking on the colander and looking at
[1:32:55] your watch
[1:32:57] god is not on your time
[1:33:00] he's now on an effort time
[1:33:08] the secret to wait for god is to submit
[1:33:12] to his word
[1:33:13] and say lord change me and say lord deal
[1:33:16] with me
[1:33:18] and say lord just be with me and give me
[1:33:20] strength
[1:33:24] o they thou wake
[1:33:28] upon the lord
[1:33:32] shall renew
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:48] oh
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:34:03] inna could not faint in a work with god
[1:34:06] he could not faint
