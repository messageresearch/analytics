========================================

[Music] many people do that same thing they thinking that he's with them now I want to place this little light to you to show you how infallible the word of God is we all here this afternoon who are Christians believe that Jesus Christ was God's word manifested we believe he was virgin born he was a Tabernacle in which almighty God tabernacled in here on Earth not just a prophet not just an ordinary man but God himself manifested in the form of a man he was Emmanuel God With Us we believe that with all of our heart and now notice when Martha or Mary rather and Joseph thinking Jesus was with them they were just perceiving he was with them thinking it just must be all right he's bound to be with us but they were sadly mistaken he wasn't so many good people's like that today they think they see the hour approaching they know something's fixing to happen What do they do they go join Church thinking he's with them they shake hands with the preacher thinking that's all they had to do he's with them confirmed or baptized a certain way way that's all they have to do thinking Jesus is with them brother sister just like Mary and Joseph of old real sincere people yet they are mistaken your life proves whether Jesus is with you or not your life shows where he's occupied here or where he still in his Heavens or on whatever you are the works that I do shall you do also how could you have Christ in you and then the very spirit in you deny his word take up a Creed instead it can't do it he would defeat himself by his own word amen just because somebody put a wrong interpretation to it you got a Bible you can read like anybody else be sincere David said put him always before your face know that when we're meeting this New Year we're meeting it in the power of the resurrection of Christ he's always before me I shall not be moved notice how infallible the word is Mary and Joseph now of you my dear Catholic friends that said Mary was the mother of God Mary wasn't even the mother of Jesus let alone Be Mother of God how could she be amen not one time did he ever address her as mother that's right not at all that's right they come to him one time and said your mother and brothers wait outside he looked on his congregation said who is my mother who is my brother looked to his disciples said the ones that does the will of my father that's same as my mother on the cross when he was dying he also spoke the same thing he said to John John he this man son behold your mother not mother behold th son woman woman behold your son amen not she was no mother of God she was just a barred wom that God used no more than any other woman that God take an ocean to use he might use your the womb of your heart to declare his son if if you just let him do it see not no mother of God it had to be a sensation even be a seed of Mary it wasn't even a seed from Mary it was the whole thing was God the Creator if the first Adam back there was created without father and mother the second Adam was the same man anything less than that wouldn't put equal with him the same God created a body that he himself dwelt in how we find look how look if Mary was the mother of God how she slipped up there she said thy father and I have sought thee with tears denying the Virgin birth thy father Joseph and I have sought thee what's that 12 year old boy 12year old child saying don't you know that I must be about my father's business debating with them denominations up there not if he was with about Joseph business he' been down the carpenter shop Joseph wasn't his father God was his father don't you know ought to be about my father's business up there 12 years old with them learned priest not a day in school but yet they were astonished at the wisdom look at the he was the word when he was born he was the word he's still the word notice the word will not take counterfeit she said thy father and I have sought thee with tears said don't you know that I must be about my father's business rebuked his own mother while he was a word there would be a question in somebody's mind if Mary here who once said the Holy Ghost overshadowed and brought forth the son and then here calling Joseph the Father the word's infallible amen it can't fail you know not that I ought to be about my father's business and he was about the father's business not not Joseph business making doors and and Carpenter things he was about his father's business straightening out the religious politics he had in that day know you not that I must be about my father's business yes you're many people today and a lot of These Fine churches are going into that counselor church not going in they're already there amen they're perceiving it that's just exactly the thing to do friendly nice why can't we all come together while they've been trying all for years to make all Methodist Baptist and all Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals just Tred to make all of them Pentecostals you can't do that but a counsel is the answer for you that's the answer what the Bible says they will do yes and that's just exactly what they've done friendly churches yes sir a get together fine let's have Fellowship Bible said how can two walk together L they be agreed some of them deny the Virgin birth 80% of the Protestant churches deny the Virgin birth amen and they deny the baptism of the Holy Ghost they deny the signs of his coming the resurrection power they denied he's the same yesterday and forever how can you when God put all this chaos in the world because a woman one day doubted one little phase of his word Satan told her the truth all the one thing but that was the thing that caused all the trouble now all this heartache and sadnesses you had to look at because one little phase of it was doubt you think one little phase of Doubt will ever take us in that's the reason Jesus is coming for a Chase virgin pure fill with the Holy Ghost hallelu not of the world but oh the power of God oh how wonderful to know that there is a possibility to get into this group how do you do it you'll never do it by joining an organization you'll do when you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the mystical body of Jesus Christ raised with him in Resurrection free from death and sin that's the only way Darkness great denominations a great group of men gets together and set their ideas about it that throws you right back into a Twist like it was at the beginning no hopes at all in that case you're simply gone and all of the seem to be so uh stirred up about this brandly churches think that God will be with them run the millenniums go to start when the council all gets together up there and all the economical moves and so forth and they join in what are they doing making an image into the Beast a power that we all the undenominational and so forth that won't join him with them will be shut out I just watch and see if that happens I've got it wrote down here the very day we the Lord let me see that 1933 and here it is just exactly where it where it said just coming the same way how the pope would leave Rome and so forth now they are good people but mistaken Joseph and Mary was fine people but real mistaken but what was it God used a 12year old boy to show that that word has to stay pure exactly what it was what it sent the first place he was virgin born and that's what he was thinking he was with them when they joined the churches and ser for but it wasn't now but to the elected now that's a Darkness I can stay on that for another hour but to the elected precious and called saints of God I say to you this coming year Shalom God's peace the our is here if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I'd say now right now amen this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom all the real Church of the Living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the Gospel being Vindicated among them Rise and Shine for the lights come to you the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day why he had the word manifested and the gospel the Bible words for this day is the light of the day amen what a glorious time that we're living now good morning peace darkness is gathered what's it gathering for to show the light Isaiah 16:1 Rise and Shine for the light has come to you that's the reason I say shalom the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who got before the foundation world called out and ordain to that the rest of will never see it never know nothing about it the Bible said so Jesus said no man will come to me except my father draws him first and all the father has given me will come amen that's there stood Judas light shining up here but back in his heart was dark seed when The Showdown come the darkness showed here was little old woman all blacked out up here in front but down here was a predestinated seed and when the light come it scattered the darkness and showed forth amen we know messiah's coming in when he does he'll show us these things Jesus said I am he but Judas doubted it yet supposed be walking in the light see the light up here doesn't matter it's the light down here that counts the light up here A Walk in fellowship and everything else but when the real power of God comes in it can't come back to this dead seed it'll reflect off in the denomination but when it's back down here a genuine predestinated seed when that light comes down here shows all the darkness away from you and put you in fellowship with Christ he was the one who gave you the life before the foundation of the world otherwise you'll never see it but God said now to you predestinated seed Shalom amen God's peace rested up you because we're near the end now we're right down near the end we're going to talk about that group for a while Shalom God's light has come the word light is Vindicated again so that you can see the manifestations of the promise of God God for this day search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they testify of the day that we're living in what is the light of the day what did the Bible promise for this day see what hour it is no wonder had Jesus rebuked him for not believing John he was the light because the prophet said he would come and there he was the manifested light they didn't see it they didn't understand it they thought it was the Messiah and they thought something else and this and other they fail to see it Jesus come on two lights can't shine the same time there can't be a church light and God's light shine at the same time it's got to be God's light puts out the church light that's exactly what's taking place today God separating churchism from his life of the promised word of this hour that we're living in that's the truth pray you might not want to believe that but you just wait and find out if it's so or not don't wait you better get in right now while there is a chance to get in the word is light when it's Vindicated until the word a promised for the day is a Vindicated then it is not light it cannot be if God said let there be light no sun come into existence there's no sign of light but when God said let there be light and there was light when God promised the messiah messiah come and his word was fulfilled and he was the light of the hour when he promised Noah and he promised the others and all there was a light of the hour and there's a light of the hour today that's Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection his word that's promised for this day The Works that I do shall you also greater than this will you do for I go to the father Greater Works amen greater things than he did you believe it I believe it it seems humbled it seems like it goes over the top of people's head look when he was here on Earth how could you do Greater Works I've translated that many times more but the same thing greater he said in St John 14:12 Greater Works than this shall you do did you notice when he went to make water into wine he took water first the already created substance and turn it into wine when he fed 5,000 people he took a fish that once swam in the water broke it handed out and multiplied creation he took bread that was once sweet baked into bread broke it hung it out to the handed out to the people and it returned back again multiplied creation but in the last days why there is no sign of creation he speaks it into creation anyhow show if you the same God that was in the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he's God greater things than this will you do for I go to my father the word's infallible it has to be manifested it has to be fulfilled greater than this shall you do not multiplying by speaking out into cre creation notice at the word now when he promised what where we at then what day are we living in what is the hour the manifesting of the word of God like it is in all hours you got the message on the seven Church ages watch exactly how each one of those beasts that went out and the beasts that followed him watch exactly if it didn't hit down to the reformers age and every age just exactly the way it was supposed to be exactly what the word said and so will the Holy Spirit manifested they just exactly what the Bible said it would be we see the shadowing in the heavens and on Earth and all the things and the counsels and things getting ready and we see in the midst of all of that the Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ promised for this day manifesting itself we're living in a wonderful time Shalom to you who have word down in your heart chose before the foundation of the world to hear the word for this day you don't it's a bad year for you ahead if you are it's a great world for you ahead or a great day great year coming now New Year not to turn a new page a lot of people try to turn a new page on New Year turn it back the next day like a little story I was reading the other morning a woman hollered into her husband who' got up early and went out and got the morning paper and was reading the morning paper he said she said is there anything new in the news he said no just the same thing only different people that's about the way it is today same thing we got a new organization same old doctoring this ped around somebody got a little phase of it going this way that way this is a new day hallelujah amen this is a day that we should rise and shine in the power of Jesus Christ gross Darkness settling up on the earth there should be a new day for us yes indeed doing it just the way he does it but turn to his word and see the Promise that's promised for this day and you don't know where you're living in daylight or not changing the calendar doesn't change the time it only changes the calendar now closely listen do as David did put your future in his hand how what am I know what to do brother bham put your future in his hand no matter what comes or goes trust him he is the word now know David said his time is in my hand trust in him all the time always trust in him he knew who help the future David did that's reason you could say this there's only one holds the future that's God so you hold the future let him hold you all right some people says but brother bandom I have tried and I have tried but wait a minute patience is virtue patience is Holy Spirit virtue you they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength you saying how can I wait any longer just keep on waiting when you've done all you can do to stand then stand just stand how am I going to do it stand he said it's a truth and it's a truth he said it'll happen how I don't know but it'll happen he said so he promised it if he promised it it's going to happen that's all it can't wait waste so I just remember God took thousands of years to fulfill his promise of a coming savior 4,000 years God took to fulfill that promise but he know from the beginning just when it was going to happen he knew no one else did he just said it would happen and when it happened the people was in such a delusion till they didn't know how to accept it if that same thing hasn't repeated again it always does never fails both sides what did he do during these years he showed types of him coming he showed it in Joseph if you'd look at Joseph's life hated of his brothers loved of his father why because he was spiritual because he saw Visions the rest of them didn't see Visions they were Patriarchs but they didn't see Visions interpret dreams but they were jealous of him and he was sold almost for 30 pieces of silver raised up out of the ditch where he's supposed to be killed set at the right hand of pharaoh and when he left the throne the trumpet sounded bow the knee Joseph his coming just exactly what Jesus was done set at the right hand of God and when he leaves the throne the trumpets will sound and every knee shall bow and confess to Jesus Christ the son of God exactly he showed it in types of David when he's up on a rejected King looking over Jerusalem weeping how often I've heard you as a hen would Brew but you would not down to the age he showed it in types knowing that someday the last type would be fulfilled and the full manifestation of his promised Messiah would be there and when the full promise come though he typed it amen day after day year after year he typed it and when it come to the reality they didn't believe it am he's done the same thing typed it and showed it in the church ages and everything to the hour that we're living and people are in grow Darkness amen seem like they just can't comprehend it such a sad thing no more than see the young man out here fine big fine bill fell with his hair what C up like the women do and leg of Tarts on and a big long sweater hanging down purple shoes on masculine oh my what a horrible thing to call a man amen amen glory to God what a thing to call a man that's right see some woman supposed to be Danish and loving come out with a pair of men's trousers on her cigarette in her mouth and bobbed hair what a thing to call a woman Jesus called Mary woman should be call that just a female notice and they hour why sometimes people who claim and think they're sincere but a gross Darkness has got them in this the Bible said it would be like that read Isaiah six and find out if the women wasn't to do that way in the last days just exactly if what the Bible said they would be it's the word of God Jeremiah and different ones spoke of this hour that we're now living because they seen the end from the beginning so we see these things and gross Darkness upon the people yes it took God thousands of years thr showing types and everything and finally they did not know him when he come though he was portrayed and Joseph and David and Elijah all down through there he was portrayed with them and yet we can't understand why they didn't see it and there it was right in the scripture out of Bethlehem of Judea he would be born they find that in the scriptures how is to be born a virgin a virgin shall conceive and bear a child they call his name Emanuel why they kill him for because he made himself God Amen and he was God sure they made he said he make himself God equal with God saying I'm a Son of God well he was I said he should be called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father wonderful that's what he was why didn't he understand that no wonder he said you to search the scriptures they said we're moses' disciples said if you was moses' disciples you'd know me Moses wrote of me and they didn't know it and the hours upon the people again when they'll go to their Creeds and things instead of the lovely Jesus that's right these great big things come up and bring them right into more Darkness more Darkness God declaring it in his word by signs and wonders in the heavens and the showing forthtelling things that happens just exactly to the hour and to the minute what did take place in that they continually walk right on the same way looks like they just can't help it good people yes sir doing the same thing now as they did then we are creatures of time God is creatures of Eternity God is a creature of Eternity he never did begin he never will end so why not just commit yourself to him look up and shine with the joy of the light of God's word that's shining today why can't people see that friends listen I'm your brother I love you wouldn't it be easy for me just to in tolerate when and go ahead and say oh well I compromise on this ion I'm not made out of that no sir when it's a word it's a word God help us to stand for that thing which is true yes sir it would be fine sure you get more pats on the bank but what I will I do stand there that day them bony fingers point my face and say you know better but you fail to tell us oh I'll be like Paul I'm not shun to declare to you the whole counsel of God know Let it go where it may be that's truth God knows it and he backs it up and says it's the truth turn to what the brother bam you You' be foolish to do such a thing turn to Christ and he is the word turn to Christ get away from Creeds get back in their I don't care you might started your Creed 500 years ago that you just that don't mean one thing to God them Sadducees and Pharisees started along before you did and were condemned call you try to place your evidence of the Holy Spirit upon different actions I believe in the manifestations of the Holy Spirit what does it do the Pentecostal says speaking in tongues is initial evidence of the Holy Ghost I've seen witches and wizards speak in tongues I've see them speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull and prophesy and deny there was such a thing as God I've been in a witch C where they lay a pencil on the table and make it jump up and down and write in unknown tongues and interpret it right that don't have a thing to it yet I believe God speaks in unknown tongues to his people let you put so much stress on that why should there be an interpreter why should have to be a message to the church and you other people you say the fruits of the spirit that's how we know love joy that's how we got the evidence it is that a Christian Science has got you all beat they exercise that more than all you Pentecostals methodists and Baptists put together watch what happened let me show you the fruits of the spirit and see if you can go to that anymore let's take Jesus God forgive me for these words I'm going to say I'm going to turn against him for a minute to show you take this cancel of Mind here this counsil of man here this afternoon I say Sir there's a young fellow around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth have nothing to do with him who was the first what does our bible teach us God Is Love who was the first with with you when you were born your kind old priest that's right who come to you when you was in need didn't have no money and loaned you some money your kind old priest exactly who put his hand on your shoulder and on mother's shoulder when you're about to separate and praise you back to God your kind old priest who else that tck sides with you when you and your neighbor was in fussing and brought you back together in Fellowship your kind old priest right who is it is the last words is going to say over you today who is it they let you lay there and rock but your kind old priest comes and blesses you and sends the word of God along with you your kind old priest what about this guy called Jesus of Nazareth then see what school did he come from your kind old priest had to sacrifice all of his life his grandfather was a priest his great great great great great grandfather was a priest he put his whole time in the organization he's trained to the word he knows what he's talking about now we're talking about fruits of the spirit kind love joy peace understanding longsuffering patience see fruit of the spirit what about this Jesus where did he come from we haven't got a word that he ever come out of any school all he do try to tear it up the schools that we built not much fruit of the spirit there is it what did you do up there where that poor Merchants down there in businessman that had to they they don't raise sheep so they they set a little pen out there so the man could bring in a sheep that poor businessman he wants to offer a sheep because it's God requirement he brings in the the Sheep to sell to the businessman so he can offer for his soul what this Jesus of Nazareth done kicked over his tables Tu some leather and plaid together beat them priest out and call your kind old priest a snake in the grass a hypocrite now you call that fruit of the spirit certainly not then where is your fruit of the spirit Landing up at no more you think of compassions and him going went through a multitude of people there multitudes lame blind crippled Afflicted withered halt lame never heal any of full of compassion people in a carnal mind will never know it seminaries don't teach it it's a revelation certainly fruit of the spirit drops off there doesn't then priest had 10 times the fruit of the spirit how would you know what's right the manifestation of the spoken word of God being made of the hour certainly there is what the evidence of the holy spirit is believing the word of God what it's manifested he was the word manifested and some of them denied it laughed at it made fun of it and called him a a fortune teller some evil spirit there's evidence speaking tongues there's evidence of the fruits the only evidence there is is when man believe the written word when it's Vindicated walk in the light of it Jesus was the light of the hour because he was the promised word of the hour and tried to tell him so but they were too too much in darkness to understand it so is it today now now creatures of time we are commit your ways to him and he will bring the future outright because we just see him as he is in the word You' seen him vindicate the word promised of the day you see in the signs and the moon you see it in the churches remember you said in the church what do that have to do with the church just a moment the moon represents the church Jerusalem is the oldest known Church city in the world melz had come from that City king of Salem king of Peace king of Jerusalem that's right the oldest city in the world and that was a moon like where the law was established and here come this wave of Gentile Darkness coming over it he said that the Turks had trod Down the Walls of Jerusalem till the Gentile dispensation was up here she is we're living right into it she's going right back this as certain as my name's William Brown L we can see it she shattered foreshadowed forto calling the elect out they drope right on in darkness the rest of them as it go along all right now we see his word Vindicated we believe so if he Vindicated the word of the day what it is what I care about what the year brings what do I care about next year what do I care whether I live today or die today every word that he promised will be Vindicated everyone if he's able to do it today after promise of 2,000 years ago if it's 100,000 years today Jesus will return to the Earth an invisible body for a church a redeem the bride and take her out of here regardless of what comes goes Fashions and go on and PE people can wait on in total darkness and believe anything they want to believe but Jesus Christ will return again I trust the future to him then Lord God I don't know what tomorrow holds but I know you hold tomorrow his word is just like a [Music]
