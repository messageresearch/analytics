house of the Lord amen praise the Lord and the week was a little bit busy for us most especially coming to the weekend and but we want to thank the law for bringing us through the weekend Amen sister terrorists who have left the hospital yesterday but there was a little bit of a concern so she she had to stay back to see the doctor this morning so probably maybe this evening or tomorrow she'll be out of the hospital but the baby is doing well amen the concern was more with the mother than the baby so we thank the Lord for that in a way praise the Lord amen on Friday morning we were just about praying in the housing and sister teach call and she got a call from the doctor and so kind to prepare herself for the possibly surgery that day so we got a little bit anxious you know that's why we're always kicking you get answers and then you get a little bit nervous and all of that so we got answers in and we started you know doing everything and calling around and and I've not left for work that morning so I called him and told him I'll be coming in late in an order there so and we spoke to her a little bit we prayed and but then he had to do one evaluation of everything the labor and all of that and it was still I think maybe 2 3 p.m. when I call her an access she called if she heard back from the doctor and and she said no then I said well you call because you have now eating since this morning and you have taken medication so call them and find out what's going on if you can be able to snack on something or drink water whatever it is and then she called and then then it turned out to be that there was someone on on the list before her that had to go into soldering so but then I told her you know justjust in the morning when I was talking to her I said well you know you know God is the healer you know and as the doctors are doing the evaluation god we have to make sure that it is his proper match so and God always give his children the best so if there was now for her there was not the best take it like that and stay with it take your mind from every word and just stay with me that God always gave his children the best so but it was a kind of you know a cannibal one of those days let me say like that it was one of those days but we thank the Lord that she's she's doing where she was to go for a procedure this morning so my wife took her in and brother Stephen would meet read them there and then she'll come from there to church so we just pray that the grace of God will continue to strengthen our sister amen and we all want to be positive we all want to prepare ourselves amen you know I was thinking that just like I said on Wednesday night to have a tense giving service and there were just so many things and we have to be thankful for amen and there was one of the things that I thought we would have celebrated Thanksgiving weekend you know because the the thing about it there is that sister quiches she's the situation and and we have to deal with the situation amen so we are all in it together amen and that is the reason why we bring you all of this reporting and that is the reason why you know we ask for your prayers and and we ask you to you know create an atmosphere of faith and just just believing that like Paul said when one of the bodies suffer the whole entire body suffer amen and I wonder if he wanted the body rejoice the whole entire body rejoice so we are suffering for now but we know we will rejoice amen and and I thought about it that evening I said well you know because brother Branham says science has break into doors laboratory so what if the doctor I calling her you know it's an earthly sign that heaven is already ready amen maybe he could bypass the doctors amen so and that's why we we are on an expectation for I don't know how you feel but I just feel so good to see the things that God is doing amen around our life even around there they're assembling and the only thing I can invite you I can invite you to enjoy the moment praise the Lord amen you might not have you know these services or these atmospheres and I appreciate the song the sisters sang you know and just the different things that God is doing you know around the Assembly enjoy the moment don't sit back and be the spectator as you miss something important you know so let's let's be part of it let's enjoy it together and so we are very grateful and we will continue to pray for our sister and pray for all of our loved ones but a scared and then update on brother David okay okay maybe I think he's just getting rest but we can believe that he's doing better okay praise the Lord he won't trust alone for that also so just like we announcer on the I think is their worst mine date here the weekend before Thanksgiving we will have our brother brother there war with us since he couldn't campaigns give him weekend we're having that weekend and it was supposed to be a Friday night Saturday evening and Sunday morning service but he will be preaching in West counseling for brother for better job he asked over on Thursday so he called me and just asked to to get a rest and preach for us on Saturday night Sunday morning and Sunday evening since the entire Thanksgiving week we want to just create appetite and prepare for whatever meal you will have there will not be service in a week until the weekend so we will have Saturday evening Sunday morning and Sunday service I mean sunny evening service praise the Lord amen and this is the first Sunday of November and we want to wish you a blessed month as we you wanting down to the end of the year and I announced Wednesday night yeah we're gonna have a little prayer meeting out because there were just a lot of things that were on my mind and that's what I want to approach I want to approach the service this morning in in a way of you know I just doing a review taking an inventory of ourself and you know and as we as we just look at all of the things that the Lord has been doing for us and what he's doing and everything that His grace has been taking us true praise the Lord so that's what we want to do and like I've always said to to to the assemblée year especially when it comes to too convenient it's only it's our communion sunday like we normally do but communion is now only for Sunday in the scripture you know they went from house to house breaking bread but there is there are just some elements that are very important and those elements is there you go back to the book of Exodus and even poor brother how beautifully in the end in in the New Testament he says wait one for another I mean so it is it's a it's a family thing you know so it's net it's not a thing word because if if we don't take time it's very easy to create classes in church you know a special class of people in all of that that is that is now what we we are all for you it's a family thing is something that we we pray for everybody we encourage everybody and then when we having things going on and different folks around you know we we want to keep those things dear to our heart praise the law and you know so we will trust the law this morning and we might come back for the for a prayer service this evening and just just to see how the Lord will be able to lead us but they're just some of those few things on my mind and we have you know we have done different things around the assembly we have used the communion to stand for for some situation in church and stands for different ones as we had in that way as we identified ourselves to that portion of the word so let's just you know what kind of a trust the Lord like I said we can be in very very busy and I need your prayers and just pray that Allah would give a string we want to greet brother Joseph ma shooter that's sister cousin husband he came in and praise the Lord so we have in one more down and many more to go amen we have to get brother Aaron's wife in and and the ones that are preparing to get married we got to buy new suits and all of their so we have one down and there are many more to go amen I'm not going to go into the details amen I would just leave it as that what brother Joseph you are welcome it's good to have you in our our little fellowship and we pray that the Lord bless you and your wife as you said to them Amy praise the Lord [Music] just like I always do come to the end of the service before I remember there was one more thing I needed to say I can't think about it so let's just stand on our feet Amin you mean last night I was just I'm just flooring on my heart and kind of thinking about what I had on my heart too to speak on and I was I've been studying a little bit around the message on on demonology and and and most of the time Sisyphean let's let's sing their song okay we will sing that that's on that I sent back there just now maybe we sing that at the end of the series let's sing unto the Lord be the glory I just thank the law for the great things that he did for us through the week with sister terrorists and sister and sister cage and you know you know there our God is a great God amen his ways I great and mighty let just praise him a little bit on to the Lord be the glory and great thanks II passed on to the Lord [Music] all unto the Lord or me Oh [Applause] [Music] angry [Music] he has not yes uncle [Music] oh great sacred [Music] yeah great yeah [Music] Oh [Music] I stopped yeah oh my god [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] my god [Music] and [Music] praise the Lord I look to the Lord doing great thing this morning amen I look to God doing great things this morning Alleluia the Lord bless you thank you musicians that would be all for the music less than an hour fee like I said I've been being kind of looking a little bit into the subject of a demonology I'm not going to we are going to talking about demonology I never said there was somebody I know that I can bring their subject better for us and if I can get that person through that would be beautiful you know brother but Moses is a man that that I respect and he has he has there with the subject of demonology now only geologically but he has been in an area where in his walk with the Lord and also in some of the areas that he have worked when he has physically there with demons amen yeah you need to listen to brother Moses testimony a post I put make the hair on your back if you don't have one if we grow that thing you make the hair on your back to stand up amen praise the Lord I hope the other one of these days we can have our brother to share with us some of those things Luke chapter 10 Luke chapter 10 but what I want to do this morning is the other I want to live with you and you remember a couple of weeks ago we spoke on the message called the bounding power amen the power that God has given to us as his children to be able to keep out what is not good for the body and to be able to keep in what is good for the body amen I want to I wanted I want to see if the Lord will help us to be able to travel down that a little bit see Luke chapter 10 the scripture says and we do read after these things the Lord appointed all those 70 also and send them two by two before his face into every city in place whether he himself who come amen therefore say heed unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest praise the Lord let's drop down a little bit to verse 17 and the 70 returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name Amen can we just say they're together Lord even the devil and subject unto us through their name let's see their together Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall be Shaba enemies hurts you now we're standing in this rejoice net don't rejoice in power amen in this resource net that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven can them make you rejoice hearing their does that make you feel good this morning amen then like your face you know tell your face there she put some smile on your face like brother there was saying and in there our Jesus rejoice in spirit and said a time be old Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou have had these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them unto babies even so father for so is same blood in that side let's pray together and I knew I had this prayer requests of mine had brazuca a little son to meeting fell from the stairs I think that was Friday evening anyhow to rush him to the hospital I think he might fracture his back and his neck or in cash and took him to the hospital and he called him cause some brothers and thinking brother farmer pray for them there at the hospital and the law came on the scene and they were able to leave the hospital that night so I think to me tis is recovering and go read you a healing process so we just want to remember them as well Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we prayed O God thanking you this morning far the law that we can stand as your children and rejoice because you know our names father we can stand Lord God not just with a mental conception but we can feed it in our lives we believe it because we can see it Oh God you know our down setting you know our uprising of God Father we have come to believe for Lord God that that that there is nothing of our life that is hidden from you and we are so grateful father that we can come to such a realization so Lord this morning we want to commit ourselves in your hands Lord and ask that God you would come and just meet us at the very point of our needs come and give us grace Oh God coming help us this morning oh dear Lord we will love you we appreciate you Lord just like we sank Oh God on to you be the glory for the great things that you are doing father Oh God and we just ask the Lord you would take complete control as we take every spirit under your control for your glory for the few time that we will spend around your word come out of the pages law and meet us at a very point for our knees in Jesus name we pray amen amen Allah bless you you may have your seat amen I would take my time this morning and I take much of your time in a way that the Holy Spirit will lead the service then we will see what will trust the law for later but as I was thinking on this I was I was I was thinking in my mind how I tied to what I want to talk about because I don't want you see many of the times when you start talking around the subject of demonology it's so easy for people to sometimes for us to bring our personalities into it and think maybe the preacher is calling you you know the demon possessed or or maybe you have a demon or something like that but the truth about it there is that there are some things that we have to we have to realize and what the grace of God is trying to bring the stone is for us to be able to know the difference between our our flesh praise the Lord and wish of course they are flesh we have to crucify the flesh that's what the scripture taught us to do amen and also to be able to know when we are influenced influenced being influenced by a wrong spirit from from from you know from the time I gave my heart to the law with my own personal struggles and some of them I share with you I have always learned to believe that every wrong influence is from a wrong spirit amen every wrong influence is from a wrong spirit every wrong thought is from a wrong spirit praise the Lord amen now if you look through the scripture you will realize that there is there is there are similarities in the way the word spirit birth that we breathe and the wind that blows amen actually in the Greek there is one word that is used to describe the three of them because of the similarity in st. John chapter 3 Jesus talks about the spirit and he says it's just like the wind blows amen and the thing about it there is that we don't see the wing when it blows I don't see you know my breath as I breathe but how do I know that I'm breathing because I'm standing I'm living I'm walking how do we know that the wayne is blurring because we can see the trees shifting the ellipse and sometimes when I get robbed we can see the effect of the way then we said it's a strongly but we don't see we don't see the way I like the way the brother said it before he says if you can be able to get a balloon and you're able to open the balloon to the way and pretty soon you will contain the Wayne in a shape are we together and that is the same way with spirits and influence of spirits we don't see them but we can know from our actions and the actions of people praise the Lord amen we can know from our actions and the actions of people and what and what we want to do to trust the Lord this morning if I would take this if I would take a title out of this I will say Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name amen we want to take I would want to take that this this morning and you know I want to take that this morning because what I'm hoping and trusting that the law will help us to see here is that we have been given power by our new birth Jesus settings in John chapter one as many that are receiving has been given power amen and there are power that we have been given as sons and daughters of God is to be able to keep out the influence of the evil one praise the Lord there is something in the scripture if you if you if you study the scripture then look up suit in a message we will get there you will realize that the Bible require us to crucify the flesh which is the own nature amen they can be crucified they can die and that's what Jesus went to the cross to be crucified is because of the old man is because of the of the of the sin of the past the sin of the future the sin of Adam the you know the the falling rate so the old man can be crucified and but there is one thing also in the scripture you will realize is that evil spirits or demons whatever way we want to call them cannot be crucified I mean scripture already you look through the scripture you will realize they are honored to be cast out praise the Lord amen they had to be cast out and guess what come back praise the Lord every time you cast an out they come back God designed it that way to keep us in check praise the Lord I know that you know the the caramel shake age that we are living in you know people have brought a lot of lot of things in you know and and they will throw fire on spirits and all of that we know is the the lake of hell is reserved for those things praise the Lord and and and and because of that we you know the the Church of the Living God the bride of Jesus Christ that is getting ready for a rapture we are coming to such an age and time where we are becoming slothful amen we are getting lazy amen and and and and because of that there a lot of wrong influence hanging on our shoulder press alone there are a lot of wrong influence hanging on our shoulder there are a lot of things that we are allowing that is robbing us of our iter attain that is robbing us of our position as sons and daughters of God are we together and that's the thing that I want for us to look at remember Jesus here in the scripture if you look at this and take this Luke chapter 10 over 2 sin John chapter 6 those were the very same 70 that Jesus acts that forsook him you know after the Mater - you went away this were the 70 men that he turned to and said will you also go praise the Lord Judas Iscariot was among these 70 are we to get him but now what I want you to see here is dead jesus said in verse 18 and he said our Lord Jesus said I beheld amen you come into me and rejoicing I beheld I saw him falling I'll be he'll sit on as a lightning fall from heaven praise the Lord are we together amen and you also look in the scripture there are some few things that we want to kind of bring here you'll realize that the the purpose of the gospel over and over in Luke chapter at Wharf 26 he speaks up speaks about that and in Matthew 28 Jesus also you know taught his disciple the purpose of the gospel is to cast out devils Jesus in sin is in John chapter 17 when he prayed he said father keep these ones that you have given me amen not out of this world but keep them in the truth so we live in this world but yet we have bound rates we have borders they are setting territory we cannot venture on we must not go there praise the Lord and and in all of those things you know put us to the place were sometimes we you have to know that this old devil is the accuser of the Brethren amen sometimes you will accuse you of what you have done you might accuse you of what somebody has have done and in any way that he can bring an accusation he would definitely bring it so we want to keep him off our territory praise the Lord hallelujah that is the reason why we are not in a picnic we are on a battlefield praise the Lord are we together amen so you will see that I'm kind of for doing the best I can in myself not to not to kind of bring this to accuse God's children because just like we said what a Wednesday night of last week we read in in the scripture of them from brother Branham there sit on don't hasn't have no part with God's children amen for the matter of fact he does not have a representation in you he does not have a representation in you you are a seal of God you are a son and a daughter of God and because he does not have a representation in you that is the reason why he appeals to your flesh this is the only guy that he can appease though we are the trusting that the law will be able to help us this morning and you know when and kind of a bring this in a way that you know that one that would kind of for strengthen us amen a few things as as notes here that I want to refer to this I found this this familiar saying over and over a few places were heard Brennan said this and I want us to to to just be able to look at it close he talks about the Queen of Sheba amen he says a little woman wave a little bunch of men marching alone with her why the sons of Ishmael were out there the robbers of the desert she was leaning with Gordon and she had to think about there but if in her heart she was hungry to find out whether that gift was real or net God made a way for her amen and God will make a way for every man or woman that was hungry and testing for righteousness sake he's a way maker amen he will open the door and he will make a way praise the Lord Amen last week we looked through the scripture we saw men that sought God with Auto be a hot one that turned all of his heart to the Lord and and and and and you know that trusted the Lord with all of his heart you know it's not only that those men of those days but we also have men and women God's children in this age that is trusting God with all of their heart praise the Lord and God would make a way don't be scared there's something going to happen it won't happen amen go ahead be determined to press in and see the kingdom of God praise the Lord amen now most of the time you would see that in the scripture the Bible says the kingdom of God is a hen now when we talk about the kingdom of God is obvious that most of the time we are think about heaven but when the scripture talks about the kiddin of God like when John the Baptist came he said repent for the kingdom of God is Sahin amen actually what they were talking about is the power of God and more men to set men free from the influence of the devil so heavenly begin here before we get there heaven begins in our hearts heaven can heaven be comes in our line even before we get there where bærum says one of these there you a final you're not going anywhere it's just a dimension amen and even Jesus himself when he came he says the kingdom of God is a hand it's right here you can step into it this morning praise the Lord every time that God will deliver the man from a habit or delivered a woman from a habit every time that God will draw a wall of his creature closer to them every time that God will allow you to experience His grace and His mercy that is the kingdom of God unto you here wanting to go to a kingdom some work and we are starting the kiddin right here we are stepping into the kiddo we are enjoying the moment of what God is doing I invite you enjoy it don't sit down like a spectator get into it because it is real heaven is real and hell is also real amen don't be scared that something is going to happen it won't happen go anyhow be determined to press in to see the kingdom of God Jesus told Nicodemus except you be born again you will not see the kingdom of God I mean if you tell you all look there the kingdom of God is the end run here the kingdom of God is there it's in this great man is in this great doctrine Jesus it don't go anywhere because the key to missing you praise the Lord he better start enjoying that kingdom that is in you amen a kingdom of peace righteousness joy and full of the Holy Ghost you better start enjoying that kiddin if now you just get a myth in your mind that one day you would go to hell you better start right here amen praise the Lord it's just like David he was king but yet he was a fugitive running away from Saul and Holly in the mountains but you know when David sat with his men and the people that were around him they always had a kingdom atmosphere even though they were running but if they camp at night they knew that David was their king if they had any they had an opportunity somebody takes their heart they are running around the fire they are having a killer moment they know that he's coming to power the know that he's getting on the throne they are now waiting to enjoy it then they're enjoying it right now and we know our King is coming to power we're not waiting to rejoice that we will rejoice right now that's why we must keep every evil influence out anything I want to stop us from rejoicing now I want to rob us of the joy that we should have praise the Lord amen oh my that's the thing that makes us you know when when the son of God or the daughter of God are going through trials or something you know that's there's a joy that's a kingdom joy inside that's why we can rejoice in our tires amen we'll be to God oh I just been trusting the Lord how to bring this this morning in annoying and you know because sometimes you could you could you could bring a message in trying to help the people yet you overburden them amen you overburden them because they really don't see where you are going so it looks like you have just come to accuse them that everybody has an evil spirit praise the Lord or be to God amen be determined to press in to see the kiddin of God that was how the Queen of Sheba was and she went on till she come she come to the gates of the polish and now notice she she never come just to hear one night amen she only din the camera and set up her tent and was going to still till she was convinced amen we will set about five minutes and draw our conception now this is what I wanted to look at it a little bit the devil will set on your shoulder it's it's a it's the same we have there you know the ole devil will come on your shoulder and just whisper in your ears you know in order that it's it's not just the same it's a reality I mean it's a reality I said I said as a son of God or as a daughter of God that is born by the Spirit of God with the new birth the resep there is there is there is a new life that is in the inside amen but this flesh is not born again praise the Lord and I want to tell you this morning that God knows that that's why he can bear with your failure and I want to tell you this morning that the devil knows that that's the reason why he can always appeal to your flesh because he knows your flesh is not born again and I want to tell you also that you need to know that so you can know what is going on amen so you can know and understand what is going on praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we self he's a faithful God in his ways our past funny now praise the Lord he loved the Lord this morning amen you know if our our age of information technology age that's that's what the age age is the age of information and and in this age of information it's wonderful it's one of the terrible age that we are living in amen you have to realize that in this age of information God has also brought us the greatest information amen the opening of the seals is the greatest information they reveal the mind of God thanks before the foundation of the world jesus told his disciples in in in in Matthew chapter 13 that there were secrets that were held from the foundation of the world amen when God started showing Daniel bada that the ghent I kid iam he taught down your seal those things sealed it up for it is keep for the end time amen so God has brought us the greatest information while we have all these church denomination we all save one God but there were many Church there are many church denomination wine there is an information because there was there there is there is a devil that has been run in parallel amen with the move of God amen and every time God move here Oh more faster and he gets the people confused point them to a man point them to a system and and and they mess what God is doing and they come around our system and any Naima by the a denomination and God has brought us out of those information praise the Lord amen and we are grateful for that praise the Lord we are grateful for that to know that in this age and time God is now building another denomination for they will all feel they will all crumble but God is building a people for a rapture amen we must be grateful that we have that information praise the Lord amen so within this age of information and there is that is one of the things in this age that there has weakened faith can you just think about it think about it when Jesus said when the Son of Man comes shall he find faith being the god of glory that knows the dispensation of the ages amen and he knew in this dispensation what we would be dealing with praise the Lord with lot of the informations out there it's hard for people to believe because you tell them something the first thing to go on Google the Google search amen you have you have you have a medical examination medical reports there you have I mean you just have all the reporting you get you just think about it just like how God has given people grace in this age that would take their time and face a Bible up and face uh just just the other day I was looking looking at a memory verse up amen because you're you got to keep your mind straight I've been trying to keep my mind straight and praise the Lord so I was looking at different memory verse up and I was just seeing what a beautiful work that people have taken their time to do and that's the same way people on the contrary has sat down there they have been information on everybody you just put up you just put a name or just put something out there you know it gives you ten different or twenty thirty different information on that information age and where there is a lot of information you know what happen people whisper have you heard have you heard have you heard oh that's why we have this devil just whispering on our shoulder saying you know do you know this and do you know that and pretty soon we want to take our cell phone and check for a amen but what is it all about it's all about influence it's all about influence let me show you another example even on on your search geared on your phone or on your computer it's built in a way to know how your mind runs I mean because of the constant thing you search for the moment you go to search it fills in the gap for you because it knows what is on your mind and knows what you feel in your mind with so Arella to give to you for you to eat and so now you put few words it just filled in a gap praise the Lord and because there is there is a there is some influence behind it sometimes it stepped a little more Father and give you something yes oh I really didn't know this one oh that old devil praise the Lord Amen my goodness that's the age that we are living in why because because there is a struggle for influence I mean and you think about it the Bible said in the book of Jude when Moses their prophet of God died there were spirits that were rather lean over his body praise the Lord amen oh my god the Holy Ghost is rustling over your enemy praise the Lord he's he's he's doing everything he's coming true true gives his coming true true songs is coming true that the simplest way he can because he want to get influence over your spirit may praise the Lord in the devil is rustling fighting over your body he has all the things out there to ap2 this body praise the Lord the truth there is theater as a as a son of God as a daughter of God he want to create frustration discouragement praise the Lord and something that was just something that would just put you in a life of wondering something that will rob you from the kingdom privilege that you have you want to put you in that condition I'm telling you a lot of people sitting in church they Sunday morning around the word that are not happy amen they are not happy to be there the STD praise the Lord loving people loving people they love God but I mean with all of the other influence out there I mean it has robbed them of everything but yet they feed that's the best place to be and I agree with them that is the best place to be praise the Lord just like when their the the the the earth was with our forum and darkness was upon the earth oh my god he mean that is that is the one of the beautiful picture in the Bible if God can just help us in that revelation of creation can be filled down in our heart and that was the first coveting that God made with the earth even though the earth was in a roll condition praise the Lord he identified himself with faith and brought and eating out of it praise the Lord him aim and then the prophet of God would come on the scene and tell us in question and answer on Genesis that Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 was a period of time different from Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 because in verse 1 the Bible says God created the heaven in the earth amen that was a time and verse 2 says then the airforce with our form and bound and people get confused but then what did God created a man he took a perfect picture in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and he was ready to bring the air back to that perfect picture and that's the same thing that he did for you and for me praise the Lord amen oh my so God is not he's not intimidated and you see and then just the different things you know that that God's children struggle with the different influences that are out there you know that the devil tried to use to rob our life I can I can go into all of those things you know habits the people struggle with you know and but IIIi want you to preach with me this morning I want you to be right there and remember we are confessed this morning the Lord even the devil are subject unto us in thy name Amen praise the Lord it's a true saying the devil is subject unto us so we want to bring all those influence on our freedom in praise the Lord no matter what we are dealing with you have to know that thing is subject unto you amen you just have to take possession of it you don't have to allow it to control your life you have to keep it out cast it away keep it out no matter what it is don't make excuse amen don't make excuses on get into the excuse game don't blame somebody get into your fight fight your fight and take your ground praise the Lord and somebody would mean this morning somebody know what I'm talking about amen praise the Lord that's there's no time for excuse here let's get into the fight that's why you were born for amen praise the Lord every time a son of God is born into the kingdom oh I forget this morning they said that's a young man that is it's going to be baptized amen and and every time a son of God is born into the kingdom the kingdom of God is a hand praise the Lord every time the grace of God goes out there and snatch a young woman from the word or snatch a young man from the world the kingdom of God is a hand because that's where the battle starts a man praise the Lord so your very life is the kingdom of God I hand when you step out in the morning Jesse just imagine in your mind you stepping out the devil is saying the kingdom of God has come because a son of the kingdom has stepped out a daughter of the kingdom have stepped out whatever we can do to her arise them horizon let's do it they know you know what the devil do he goes out there and start giving people attitude you speak to them to push their mouths up he gives them attitude just just to bug you amen then he throws it back on you you see they don't like you to see that you have to know the whole heaven is behind you praise the Lord in heaven is watching to see what would you do you representing heaven on earth you know go back in and read a little bit Stella when brother Branham talks about the maniac the manner of gathering he dramatized that so nicely you have to remember this prophet of God live his life in vision and he talks about this man being a nice man I'm gonna bring it like to you this wing it might have just been that he had a bad day amen and he went out and and I mean he just had a bad day at work I may be trying to get a work or maybe his farm never turned out well whatever he was doing it just there were it was just about that there was just so much on his mind praise the Lord and then he's thinking about a wife and children home that would be disappointed and him not being a father to provide a men that ever comes and he brings all of those things to your mind then he's trying to do his best praise the Lord believing in the God of Abraham and as he goes alone as he goes along uh you know he see an opportunity maybe to strike a deal let me try it and see maybe I could be fortunate in this you know what that prophet of God said just bought the first lie he told sit on step in there diamond there being a horizon him all through the day making him to thing in his mind that he's now he's not man enough and and and and nothing is working for him he had to do something he decide to step out of the coveting of Abraham and do something that he was not supposed to do praise the Lord let me say like this to you every child of God that is born of the Spirit of God they knows when they are doing wrong I mean if the Spirit of God is in you it tells you when you are doing wrong now where the person comes to be possessed it's when the note that they are doing wrong amen and they want to justify is that spirit taking possession you have the right to do it and nobody can tell you anything different then a spirit or a habit is taking residence because it used to bother you now it don't bother you anymore you can just lied and get by with faith in now and you know while you do you don't you don't you don't shiver you don't ask yourself what am i doing this but if you're asking yourself why are you doing this then you are staying in the fight and I will tell you you fight harder amen now remember Jesus told his disciple don't rejoice because even the Devils are subject unto you rejoice because your name is written so even if you don't feel that they are subject to you rejoice your name is written your name is written in the book of the victors it in the bulk of the overcomers so just by knowing that your name is in the book of the overcomers if you can take the attitude of rejoicing as an overcomer sooner you will start behaving as an overcomer and you will start fight and overcome up and you will become an overcomer praise the Lord well your name is in the book of the overcomers and you are so saddened and you just feel so defeated praise the Lord just hoping that God would bring you out by the skin of your teeth just hoping amen that another day will not break because I can't take this anymore you have to wait for the day to break to be able to step out and fight praise the Lord just by knowing that your name is in the book of the overcomers it should make you happy it should encourage you and say I can do it praise the Lord I can be able to step out there praise the Lord I can break myself away from this habit no matter what it is no matter what it is praise the Lord Amen glory be to God hallelujah amen you know the devil he like notice Amen and that's what I was trying to evolve this morning because this service is not about him praise the Lord Amen so I was just just saying Lord you know you come to talking about this thing and sometimes you you you are just it's almost like let me expose these demos let me call them by names and we got about talking about all of these things and at the end of the service sometime the devil is so glorified oh they really talk about me today you know and then he summer all of those demons hey you videogame come here you got to create more games you know they were talking about you today in the service and you different things you know what you know the reason why I say there I believe there are beautiful games especially when when you know children are learning how to overcome obstacles and different things I believe they are beautiful games but there's a there's a Christian research that came out they attributed were many young teens Christian things sometimes that goes into you know they get caught up into ugly habits is because the same party that is that is that is that is the same programming part in that is that is that created most of the video games like horror games and killing games in order death is the same platform all of these so unclean pornography sites are created on it's the same one what is happening here is that this is the way they create a create a relationship it creates a closeness it makes it real when it gets into all of these fouling games amen and because as violent is evil praise the Lord so that evil spirit is ready to carry you to the next level because it's not to destroy the images is to destroy you I mean is to destroy you is to is to affect you those are just images are we together I told you I said I was not going to praise the devil so let's get into what we are talking about this morning a man let's let's look at something here also Brad Brown said this then Jesus came he said just remember because Jesus comes every devil in hell we try to keep you away from him praise the Lord now take it like this Jesus through the new birth has come in your life he has make you conscious that you are a son of God and you a daughter of God and you can see God's grace and mercy upon your life because Jesus comes every devil we're trying to keep you and that's what he does you see demons add to matters amen they are there to meet you that's what demons are and one of the purpose is to keep you from getting to Christ whatever he can do - he does not have a problem if he can keep you in the church amen he don't have a problem if he can keep you around the message his problem is that as long as he can keep you from Christ as long as he can keep you from the truth revelation of who you are praise the Lord now with God dealing with your life and the different things that happen and you says oh my god thank God for His grace thank God and I mean you see God dealing with your heart a truth experience coming in your heart and you realize that this is the grace of God for me all law help me in everything he realized that you have had a bird something has happened to you he realized that he could not keep you from there so what he tried to do next he tried to keep you from being effective in your relationship with God if your relationship can just be a shadow true church member ship he tried to keep you from being effective he tried to keep you from taking your position as a son of God as a daughter of God taking the promises of God as your own praise the Lord taking the promises of God as your own when you read God's promise in this word you take it as your own just remember Jesus because Jesus come every devil in hell we try to keep you away from him amen that's right you might hear the message but the devil will sit right on your shoulder and says don't you listen don't you listen don't you listen amen he will stay right on your shoulder and try to throw everything at you so you cannot be able to focus amen throw everything at you well you can just sit right in the church and then you play me for tomorrow I got to do this I got to do this you body is here your spirit is gone and those are some other things that you have to fight praise the Lord amen sometimes you are alone in and you are just dating and you're thinking about God's goodness and mercy and and it just come on your heart to praise and and and and and and to just pray and write in that very same time toss just float on your mind I mean you think about yesterday you think about today you think about tomorrow that I'm not even come and then you think about this person you think about that person it's just it's just so hard to keep your mind why is that praise the Lord and sometimes it gets so frustrating it gets so discouraging though I've been there a lot of the time I was even there last night praise the Lord sometimes I get to those places my wife is so sorry for me I mean I was just I was just fighting the true last night and I was lying right on my steady table I don't know she taught I pass out or what you mean she came calling me trying to find out what was happening to me I say oh my goodness lord help me I'm trying to get true here okay I'm praying nothing is happening to me but that's that's what it is that's what it is we all go through there try to do it just try to focus on Christ some of the unnecessary thing I mean that's when even the devil want to do you favor he tried to remind you the thing you forgot and you say oh I remember that's how you try to do your favor do you know what that thing you were looking for you put it in the closet then he try to do your favor but that's the killing of God we must fight amen he come and sit on our shoulder you know that's what I was thinking about last night you know trying to trying to just just bring this thing out real that is not juris it's not just a slogan it's a reality and with this with it praise the Lord and they're bound in power sometimes he comes you know if he if you can't talks about you then he starts to talks about somebody else you know praise the Lord and all of these different things that we deal with and and and and that's those are the things that we must keep out because the purpose of those things is to torment you amen is to tomat Uist it's to trouble you praise the Lord but we still believe in a God that can deliver Amen or believe in a God that can deliver I can go on and on and there are some of the few things that I could share with you this morning but just like I said I'd like us to just take an inventory of ourselves this morning amen and look at some of the few things that you've been dealing with in your walk like I said before we are fighting the same enemy it's just that you might be on the east gate and I'm on the West Gate amen maybe you're on the love side and I'm on the south but we all fighting the same old devil praise the Lord and it's our duty to keep him off of our territory praise the Lord we have to tell him you can come across the bloodline sittin there was a line that is draw you can't come across the line keep him on the other side that's the Christian life the Christian life is to keep the devil out whatever you have to do to keep him out keeping out let's bow our heads and how together this morning remember in Seema chapter one musicians you can come in see mark chapter 1 the Bible talks to him at chapter 1 verse 23 Jesus went into the synagogue and the scripture speaks about a man that was possessed with an evil spirit praise the Lord and because the church has failed many times when we have people that come in with you know funny you know coming with familiar spirits or you know different things we so easily freaked out pretty soon we want to get the person out of church because we don't want to be disrupted but you realize that Jesus never pulled the man out of the church Jesus pulled the spirit out of the man and when he did that you know what the scripture says the Pharisees the preachers of those days they said what a new doctrine what a new doctrine that even evil spirit obeyed his voice now what I'm doing this morning or this afternoon like I said as we labor together it's not a make every one of us seen us where we have to come to repent and be baptized this morning if you want to be definitely we can baptize you this morning and but our sons and daughters of God I want us to just get to the place of being earnest with ourselves this morning and your seed some of the wrong influence that has been around our territory we fight against it by yet it comes back because what the devil want to do is that he want to make that thing for you to believe that is your nature he want to accept you want you to accept it in your life and as a son of God as a daughter of God I'm telling you this morning you don't have to live with that [Music] unless you want to come to the altar to be pray with but I want us to just just stay in your place and take your ground this morning stand upon the word this morning
