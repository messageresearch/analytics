[0:16] of a blood sacrifice blood had to pay
[0:20] the price and it's forever been the
[0:24] same there has never been any other way
[0:27] or anything else that ever took its
[0:30] place it was blood the only way that God
[0:34] receives his children back is by this
[0:38] Blood substitute no other price can be
[0:41] paid nothing else will do God's first
[0:44] decision is always perfect and its
[0:46] Eternal and we know that that's true
[0:48] because God can't lie and he cannot take
[0:50] his word
[0:52] back since that time has been God's only
[0:55] way and only place of fellowship with
[0:58] man now the subject was now the word
[1:02] death means
[1:04] separation when we die this way it does
[1:07] not mean our physical death does not
[1:09] mean that we are dead Jesus said he that
[1:12] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:14] shall he live whosoever liveth and
[1:17] believeth on me shall never die now that
[1:21] death speaking of there is separation
[1:24] from the presence of God but the
[1:27] physical death that we have to go
[1:28] through here yet it is not death we're
[1:31] still in the presence of God we move
[1:33] from this place to a closer place with
[1:36] him in his presence it isn't the death
[1:38] that we call death what we call it here
[1:41] remember he said to the the girl that
[1:44] was died gas's daughter she is not dead
[1:48] but sleepeth and they laughed him to
[1:50] scarn he knowing that she was dead
[1:53] that's their terms she was dead but
[1:56] Jesus said she sleepeth and he went and
[2:00] wakened her and she came back to life
[2:04] now from Adam until now man has tried to
[2:09] make his own substitute he's tried his
[2:13] best to do something a little better
[2:16] than what God did it then and that's
[2:18] just natural in man man is always trying
[2:22] to to better something to make it a
[2:27] different way he wants to inject his own
[2:30] ideas into the plan of God and that's
[2:33] why we stand tonight separated uh the
[2:37] Christian people of the world by
[2:40] barriers by denominational barriers we
[2:44] it does this because that man has
[2:46] injected his own idea into God's plan
[2:50] from Adam until now as I've said it's
[2:53] been that way Adam
[2:56] expressed man's thinking in the Garden
[2:59] of Eden when he made himself a fig Leaf
[3:02] apron to face God it's something that he
[3:05] did himself and from fig leaves he's
[3:09] tried education Towers cities Idols
[3:14] civilization denomination but it ever
[3:17] Remains the Same God only accepts his
[3:21] subject under the
[3:23] blood that's
[3:24] all education has totally failed more
[3:29] educ we get farther we get from each
[3:31] other denomination has totally fail we
[3:35] draw lines and barriers in each one
[3:38] trying to get that denomination higher
[3:39] than the other and it breaks Fellowship
[3:42] civilization has merely brought about
[3:44] confusion cities towers and whatever
[3:47] more has all failed and God's plan Still
[3:52] Remains the Same under the
[3:56] blood this Blood must be a displayed
[3:59] blood
[4:00] in the garden back in the time rather of
[4:04] Israel when Israel had to kill the lamb
[4:08] and a place of blood upon the L and on
[4:10] the
[4:11] doorpost god required that and that
[4:15] token must be there no matter what other
[4:20] position them man might have showed that
[4:23] they were circumcised Israelites they
[4:26] might have confessed that we believe
[4:28] every word that Jehovah said
[4:30] but that didn't expel it they had to
[4:34] display that token the blood must be
[4:37] shown amen that's the way it is tonight
[4:40] I believe that every Christian has to
[4:43] display the blood of Jesus Christ is
[4:45] cleans them from the things of the
[4:48] world
[4:49] regardless now in that time the token
[4:54] must be on the door it must be there
[4:57] regardless of how Rel religious the
[5:00] house was how religious the people how
[5:03] well they had brought up their children
[5:06] how fine they tended Church how well
[5:09] they displayed all the things that God
[5:11] has said it's still at that last hour
[5:14] where it showed between death and life
[5:17] the blood had to be displayed and the
[5:20] blood showed that a innocent substitute
[5:24] had been taken in the place of the
[5:27] worshipper and the chemistry of the
[5:30] blood the red blood itself was a sign on
[5:33] the door that this house was safe under
[5:37] the blood now that was a type now in
[5:42] these last days we're coming back again
[5:46] to the hour of God delivering his church
[5:50] I I believe
[5:51] it amen and it's certain as that blood
[5:56] had to stand for a memorial so does the
[6:00] token had to be is required
[6:03] today for now they could not take the
[6:07] chemistry of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[6:09] and placed upon ever heart's door but
[6:13] you see that time an animal died which
[6:16] was a lamb and to show that the animal
[6:19] was dead the blood was on the door so
[6:22] the life that was in the animal could
[6:24] not come upon the worshipper because the
[6:26] animal doesn't have a soul so the life
[6:29] that was in the animal could not come
[6:31] upon the worshipper but today when the
[6:34] blood of God's own son was shed at
[6:37] Calvary for our pardoning and
[6:40] release the life that was in that blood
[6:44] was God himself and the Holy Spirit
[6:47] returns upon his church upon his
[6:49] believer and it's a token in these last
[6:52] days he'll pass
[6:55] over the man or the woman that's
[6:58] accepted the death of Jesus Christ as
[7:01] their substitute and the Holy Spirit
[7:04] Bears record you might say I've accepted
[7:07] it and you still live in the world you
[7:09] still live like the world then there's
[7:11] no evidence that that life was for you
[7:15] until that evidence of the Holy Spirit
[7:19] has struck into your life there's God's
[7:21] requirement that every man or woman must
[7:24] have that evidence as a token in this
[7:26] last day when I see the blood Jesus said
[7:31] verily verily I send you except the man
[7:34] be borned again of the water and spirit
[7:36] he will in nowise enter into the kingdom
[7:40] therefore it's been God's program all
[7:43] the time blood it was blood in the Old
[7:46] Testament it was blood in the New
[7:48] Testament in the Old Testament was the
[7:50] chemistry which was a type of the life
[7:52] that is to come it showed that there was
[7:55] a substitute taken but the worshipper
[7:57] went out with the same guilty conscience
[7:59] that he had when he come in and offered
[8:01] his lamb but this way when the
[8:04] worshipper once purged from sin has no
[8:07] more conscience of it the thing is dead
[8:11] passed away and you changed from Death
[8:13] unto life and you're alive again in
[8:15] Christ Jesus with eternal life the Holy
[8:18] Spirit resting within you bringing forth
[8:21] the life of Jesus Christ again where the
[8:23] Bible said in Hebrews 13:8 he's the same
[8:26] yesterday today and forever God is
[8:28] waiting the hour to see his church come
[8:30] to that position regardless of
[8:32] denomination regardless of creed color
[8:35] or whatever it may be that his entire
[8:37] church would come to the place that
[8:39] they're displaying the token of the
[8:41] death of Jesus Christ for a little while
[8:44] he said in the world seems me no more
[8:46] yet ye shall see me because I live you
[8:48] live also I'll be with you even in you
[8:51] to the end of the world Jesus Christ the
[8:54] same yesterday today and
[8:57] forever I get among Christians sometime
[8:59] who claim to be SED man of women of God
[9:03] they're ashamed of a testimony they're
[9:05] ashamed to say Amen they're as shamed to
[9:07] sing the songs of Zion they're ashamed
[9:10] everywhere I like to get among people
[9:12] who's not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[9:14] Christ though it seems like heresy but
[9:17] yet they're not ashamed something has
[9:19] happened and it means more than life to
[9:22] them it is life it's life eternal
[9:25] because they have accepted God's
[9:27] substitute
[9:29] I like this kind of singing when I was
[9:32] back there praying for some of the
[9:33] people a few moments ago that had been
[9:35] brought in and it's not being a prayer
[9:37] service just to speak I was in there and
[9:39] I can hear the songs the Clapping of
[9:42] their hands and we wonder and some of
[9:45] them even uh seen them run up and down
[9:48] the floor what they call dancing in the
[9:50] spirit at first time I was a Critic of
[9:52] that when I seen the Pentecostal people
[9:55] dancing in the spirit and I thought what
[9:57] is this it must be a bunch of nonsense
[10:00] then I got to reading the Bible and I
[10:03] found out that when dancing in the
[10:06] spirit the devil cop it it and put him
[10:07] out here with rock and roll and stuff
[10:09] but the real genuine Dance come from God
[10:13] exactly and always a dance was Victory
[10:17] when David slew Goliath and this little
[10:21] runny looking boy come dragging ahead of
[10:23] this chant into the city the people met
[10:25] him dancing they had the victory when
[10:29] Moses crossed the Red Sea by the power
[10:31] of God and took the children of Israel
[10:33] on the other side miam picked up a
[10:36] tambourine and all the daughters of
[10:37] Israel and up and down the bank they
[10:39] went beating a tambourine and dancing in
[10:42] the spirit if that isn't an oldfashioned
[10:44] Pentecostal meeting I never seen one in
[10:46] my life the trouble was with me I didn't
[10:49] have enough Victory but when you finally
[10:52] get that Victory and the token of the
[10:54] blood of Jesus Christ comes upon you I
[10:57] remember David the Great s psalmist of
[11:00] the Bible when he had done something
[11:03] that this great thing he was given
[11:05] Saul's daughter and she was kind of a
[11:09] self self style so-called believer and
[11:13] the Ark had been away from God for a
[11:16] long time the visible presence of God
[11:18] the pillar of fire hanging over this Ark
[11:21] the Philistines that come in and tuck it
[11:23] out under Saul's Reign and one day when
[11:27] David seen the ark coming back to the
[11:30] house of God David run out before the
[11:33] ark and he danced before the Lord oh
[11:36] singing the Praises of God and Saul's
[11:38] daughter seemed to be very much
[11:40] embarrassed at that man's action her
[11:42] husband her young handsome husband cut
[11:45] up and misbehave himself in her presence
[11:48] the King's Daughter and David said so
[11:51] much if you don't like that watch this a
[11:53] little while and around and around and
[11:56] around the ark he went again dancing in
[11:58] the spirit and she was embarrassed and
[12:02] God cursed that woman with a
[12:05] curse oh the victory through the blood
[12:08] of Jesus Christ The Token of the
[12:10] resurrection of Christ his life lives
[12:13] within his church there's no other way
[12:15] of Fellowship under but under that blood
[12:19] our denominations will separate us and
[12:21] one say that's nonsense and one say this
[12:23] that or the other Pentecost was our
[12:25] pattern no one will have to say but what
[12:28] or can say but what that the church was
[12:30] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and
[12:33] the same spirit that come upon them on
[12:36] that day every time without fail in the
[12:39] Bible when the Holy Ghost came upon the
[12:41] people they acted the same
[12:44] way let me say this that in the Heathen
[12:47] lands where I've had the place of the
[12:49] privilege of traveling and seeing
[12:52] blanket natives of the islands and in
[12:55] the hotten tots and see them stand there
[12:58] where he have to speak through an
[13:00] interpreter never heard the name of
[13:02] Jesus Christ in their life but tell them
[13:04] a story and ask them to raise up their
[13:07] hands and receive God they do the same
[13:09] thing you do right here when you receive
[13:11] the holy ghost shows it it's a universal
[13:14] thing it's a power of almighty God the
[13:17] display of his token upon his children
[13:19] whether they're red black white or
[13:20] whatever they might be it's the only
[13:22] place that Fellowship is given Nimrod
[13:25] built a tower and Nebuchadnezzar a city
[13:28] and so forth they go on down through
[13:30] scientists and everything but ever Still
[13:33] Remains that it was the blood that God
[13:37] made his decision that it would be a
[13:39] innocent substitute would have to take
[13:41] the guilty man's place for pardon and it
[13:44] Remains the same thing tonight and never
[13:46] has changed it job lived by it job the
[13:50] oldest book in the
[13:52] Bible though everything happened to that
[13:55] man yet he stood firm because he know he
[13:59] had met Jehovah's requirement he know it
[14:02] was right Abraham the same way many of
[14:06] them Israel met only there was only one
[14:08] place that Israel could have Fellowship
[14:11] that was under the shed blood man ought
[14:14] ever H to Worship in Jerusalem until
[14:17] there was a sacrifice there was no
[14:19] worship and the sacrifice was blood
[14:24] today the day is yet as fully educated
[14:29] as the the nation seems to be and as
[14:33] high cultured as they seem to be and all
[14:37] of our scientific research to split an
[14:39] atom and whatever it takes place to
[14:43] shoot a rocket to the moon or send up a
[14:45] a satellite or whatever it might be all
[14:48] of our scientific research all of our
[14:50] denominations all of our education all
[14:52] of our schools it's only got us further
[14:55] from God than it was at the beginning
[14:58] what it takes is a surrendered heart to
[15:00] the power of almighty God by his will
[15:03] and the Holy Spirit will come as a token
[15:06] upon that person these signs shall
[15:09] follow them that believe it ever Remains
[15:12] the Same Christ said so go ye into all
[15:16] the world preach the gospel to Every
[15:18] Creature he that believeth and is
[15:20] baptized shall be saved he that
[15:22] believeth not shall be damned and these
[15:24] signs shall follow them that believe
[15:28] it's a manifestation of the holy spirit
[15:31] that God has accepted the worshipper for
[15:34] the spirit and life that was in Christ
[15:37] comes upon the worshipper could you
[15:39] imagine a Jew in the old days under the
[15:43] shed blood here he comes down the road
[15:46] it's the day of the atonement he's going
[15:48] to make a sacrifice he has a fine fat
[15:52] bulock that's Jehovah's requirement or
[15:56] maybe we say he has a a lamb a fine fat
[16:00] lamb it's going to be looked over by the
[16:02] priest to see if there's a blemish upon
[16:05] it and then he goes to the place of
[16:07] worship he realizes he's a sinner he's
[16:10] did that which was wrong now he lays his
[16:13] hands upon this Sacrifice by laying his
[16:16] hands upon the sacrifice he identifies
[16:19] himself with his
[16:21] sacrifice and then when his throat is
[16:24] cut or its life is taken his hands laid
[16:28] up on him
[16:29] and his life is taken and he feels the
[16:32] pains as that animal is dying and the
[16:34] blood squirting out upon his hands he
[16:37] realizes that that animal is taking his
[16:41] place and there he goes back justify
[16:45] because he's done exactly what Jehovah
[16:48] required him to do and that's the same
[16:50] thing it is with Christians today it
[16:53] isn't signing a card that you'll come to
[16:55] Sunday school so many days or so many
[16:58] Sundays in the year it isn't taking a
[17:00] pledge that you won't drink no more for
[17:02] 6 months it isn't that it's laying your
[17:06] hands upon God's provided sacrifice his
[17:10] pardon the head of Jesus Christ and
[17:13] feeling the Terrors of the flesh at
[17:16] Calvary and then identifying yourself
[17:19] with him in baptism that as he died and
[17:22] rose again so are you buried in his name
[17:26] to rise to
