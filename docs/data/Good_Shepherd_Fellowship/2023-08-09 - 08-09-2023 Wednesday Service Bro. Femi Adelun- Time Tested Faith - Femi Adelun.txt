first may we receive them Lord even your word that will come Lord maybe you speak into our hearts of God we are our opinions our ideas can do nobody any good but a word from you will make a lot of difference father may your world touch us tonight lift our burden meet us at the points of our needs so that we can go back home rejoicing and glorifying your name thank you because you have done it in the name of Jesus Christ your friend amen praise the Lord um why are we still why we're still standing rest on our Bibles quickly so that we can sit once and for all Mark 11 22. it's a short verse Mark chapter 11 verse 22. I believe you you can know it of Art Mark 11 chapter 22. is on the screen I'll start reading I already did a verse and Jesus answering says unto them our face in God May amen may the Lord our blessings to renew this holy word you can please be seated now God bless you and welcome to the house of the Lord amen there is no better place to be than in the very presence of our Lord Jesus because we know by experience that in the presence of God there is fullness of joy our desires are met weakness are turned to strength ah Allelujah I believe that will be your portion tonight amen God bless you um hopefully maybe on Sunday we have more time for greeting but I bring greeting from my family my wife and children and the church and the pastor the our pastor called me today and said I should greet you in particular I believe you know him amen God bless you so this evening we are looking at a salmon title time-tested face time tested face I believe it to go with the prayers we have offered amen Jesus told us that nobody can receive anything of God except by faith we can only please God by face and faith is simple amen let me give you a little dramatization assuming maybe I'm starving maybe in the afternoon and then and then maybe you met me on the way I said what's wrong with you brother femi and I said look I'm so tired I'm hungry I need to eat something maybe you ask me what will solve my problem and I said maybe a loaf of bread and then you gave me maybe 50 cents assuming that's the price for a bread a loaf of bread you know at that time I don't have the bread but because I have the purchasing power for bread I will be as satisfied as ever and that's what it's called fits the evidence of things not sin hallelujah it's not as if the thing is already in your pocket but you believe that it's already there there is no more and iota of doubt amen so Brethren faith is simple it's the faith you need to sit on that chair if you don't have faith in that chair you won't sit you will ask the Deacon to replace it for you but because you know that this child will not fall you down you have faith in it God asked us to have faith in him it's a basic requirement for a Christian walk with Christ Hallelujah where we want to talk about time tested fit tonight there have been people over the ages who have expressed their faith and then events have shown that these people have faith in God and we have the testimonies there are examples for us today so that we can rely on them so that our own faith in God can also be sharpened amen and we saw in April 11 god mentioned Enoch he said Enoch walk with God and it was not because God took him amen I think he was the first person that went in rapture Hallelujah and he did so by faith Hallelujah no wonder I suffered mentioned today that if we don't have enough Faith to heal a simple headache add the way I fit for rapturing face but Brethren if you are beautiful the Rapture the faith must be there amen maybe one day he left the home I said wife children I'm going to work I will be back but because he has lived a life that so please God the prophet said he eat the King's Highway amen one of these days Christ will come calling for us and that's how we know our home the Tana home is waiting for each and every one of us Christ promised us are going to prepare a place for you so that where I am you can also be there he said if it were not so he will have told us and so we know that Christ doesn't lie we have faith in him so Brethren I have a mansion over there I know you do too let's try by that amen no matter what we Face here is nothing to be compared with what will awaits us amen so Enoch one of those days he eat the king's iron and Bible said it was no more not because he died but he went with Christ and yet it is impossible to please God without faith so if Enoch was one of the people who had a time-tested face amen if we go back again where we have read we read Mark 11 22. Jesus admonished the disciples after An Occurrence the Bible told us that Jesus came to a fig tree then he went to it thinking that I can get some fruit but because the season of that fig wasn't yet he had no fruit but Christ said no man eat of you forever and they left and then tomorrow when they were coming the next morning Peter Observer and said Master look at the Fig Tree it has gone dried to the roots Christ only told them simple our faith in God and tonight I want you to have faith in God the prayers you have offered you didn't offer it unto man you did not do it as a religious exercise you did it because you knew God will answer you and I pray that God will back that Faith amen Hallelujah right from the beginning we have somebody like Abraham is a father of faith we all know that that Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness Genesis chapter 12 told us that Abraham was an ordinary Idol worshiper like every other person in all and then they found Grace on the side of God and then God just come to him Abraham get out of your Kindred get out of your country get out of your family and then go to a land that I will show you I had known that many of us have had that call leave your denomination live your way of life follow God Brethren God will meet you at the points of your knees he met Abraham at the point of his need he promised him and he promises are still coming to Parsippany today time tested faith amen Abraham believed God he went into a country he didn't say go to the U.S go to Europe no just go to a place that I will show you and Abraham believed God he left took his father took Lord and all that he had and his wife and then left for that land we are talking about time-tested faith and after a while Genesis 22 God confirmed to him that this man he actually believed me when he asked him take that son that have given me after 25 years of waiting God gave him Isaac and then when is it was about 12 years God called him said Abraham take your only son even Isaac and go and sacrifice him in one of the mountains and Bible told us that Abraham did not even check check it it was just it was completely obedient to the word of God that is what faith can bring Hallelujah when you trust the Creator there is no mountain before you that we stand amen and Abraham when God told him he didn't check it just do as he was told and went to in the journey even the son Isaac asked my father he said here I am we have the fire we have the wood we have everything but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham in faith responded the Lord himself will provide for himself a lamp Hallelujah and that was an example because when God saw in the Book of Genesis 3 after the fall when man fell God killed the lamb to make a clothing for them and he made the promises that without the shedding of blood there have been no remission of sin and he came around to tell us Romans 3 23 that for all I've seen and come short of the glory of God so no man's blood were able to redeem the other and so God like he did for Isaac he provided for himself a lamp which is our Lord Jesus Christ you know everything is in tight that's why um when Moses when God told Moses go to the Rock these people need water just speak to the Rock you know but Moses because of the pressure of the people you know it's not easy to lead people it's not the fault of Moses Bible said Moses is the meekest man among men but yet they made him angry and so when he got before the rock instead of speaking Bible said he struck it twice and then because it was a prophet of God God had to back him up Hallelujah I want you to see something there especially Who You Are if a child of God the prophet said if a son or daughter of God puts the word of God in this or Hamas is as good as your manipulation speaking Hallelujah God will back you up when you are inside this world amen and so Moses because he was a prophet of God God had to respond by giving them water but God call him aside why do you think it was so serious even Moses besought god many times God let me see this land not saying no you won't because the scripture must not be broken Christ can only be smitten once but Moses did it twice so God don't take his word for nothing Hallelujah and if we can have that Revelation if we can stand upon the word of God I believe we will see miracles Hallelujah and so we are talking about Abraham he told the son the Lord himself will provide the lamb for his own sacrifice and I say follow the father and when he was about to sacrifice the boy God said stop there now I can see that you have faith in me Hallelujah we are talking time tested faith and God provided for himself and then the child was spared and God wasn't satisfied he called again the second time Genesis 22 he said Abraham because you have not denied me your only son because of that I will be an enemy to your enemy I will bless you and I will multiply you and your seed shall possess the Gate of their enemies brother we are Abraham's seed not according to flesh but we are royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah and we must possess the good of our enemies amen we are not a loser but we are winner by Design that's why if we look at Ephesians chapter 6 you can only see weapons in our front there is no weapon at the back because we don't turn our back to the enemies because we are more than conqueror through him that loved us Brethren let's have faith in the word of God Hallelujah we are talking time tested first and I've shown to you that faith is very simple just apply that's why in Egypt when they were to come out there was that final Passover what did God tell them kill a lamb apply the blood with isoplif by Abraham said ESOP is like faith a very common leaf for even the worldly people they apply Faith you know they have visions and they pursue it because they believe it will work Hallelujah you believe your service with God will work amen if God makes a promise it's not too hard for God to bring it to pass amen so Brethren let's have faith in God faith will do anything let me read a small quote for you time tested Faith paragraph I'm 17. you say anything faith has no bounds no limitation we see look at some examples of people who have applied for it he said now Faith we do just anything that you have in need of being done are we together whether spiritual whether it's physical whether it's for yourself or somebody else but around say faith will do anything if you will put it to work but most churches today that's as far as they teach just accept Jesus by faith and that settles it that's like a man that was eating a slice of watermelon he said that was good but there's more of it somewhere we can get more from God more than just salvation amen it's not just the death of the Cross it's not just for salvation it is for everything that we ever need throughout our life's journey amen oftentimes we should change ourselves but may the Lord open our eyes Hallelujah and then when a man accepts Christ as his personal savior then all the good things then all the good things that God has promised is laying right at his fingertips all he has to do is just to believe amen now don't go at it in a place where you are just oh I wonder if it will work just the same as you know you are going to get a drink of water or you are going to rise up and work if I want to get a water down there I will have to go work there and take it amen say you are going to rise up and walk across the floor that's just how it is simple to be about it well a man the Lord promised it that settles it amen just go on about it that's the real genuine faith if the Lord promises it that's it if we can find it in his word he said I will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory that settles it Hallelujah let's continue there have been people who have applied faith one of them is David I'm not talking about David as a king but David as a young boy who was a Shepherd boy you know perhaps forgotten by the rest of the family member but then your situation is irrelevant all you have to do is to connect yourself to Calvary and the situation will turn around amen oh don't say oh my family I'm the smallest it doesn't matter that's the same no matter how short the person is he can also see the sky no matter who you are you can connect with God amen and so this David was by there taking care of the Sheep and then we're about to say anytime the devil will call your hand it will challenge you but if you know where you are standing it will lose and so this David one day a beer many of us we have seen documentary of what a bear looked like it's not a small animal and then the bear came after one of the Lambs took it and then they will realize I'm the shepherd there that is my position I don't know what where God has placed you but he told us that whenever the soul of your fish are tread upon that he has given you Hallelujah Don't Be Afraid at work if God has put you there nobody can shift you you stand your ground and serve God's purpose Hallelujah and we saw that then we realized who he was and then that day I started to make a mess of his position as a shepherd and he went after the beer despite the size and everything he took back the lamb and then when the beer challenge he said I killed him Hallelujah and then the devil wasn't done he realized man I've got to take this boy down but you see nobody can take you down because if God put you there the devil cannot remove you let's believe that Hallelujah and then he sent a lion of course you know what a lion is it's more Fierce than the beer and more dangerous he came after one of the Lambs and David rely on the past testimony that God that delivered me from the beer of course he will do the same Hallelujah Brethren God that give you salvation he will give you healing it will give you your last need and it will take you home when the time comes Hallelujah don't think that we were just Christian we don't know what will happen what will happen we know Rapture will take place and will be part of it Hallelujah and so the lion came to and then we went after it delivered the lamb and killed the lion the devil wasn't done to realize something about this boy I've got to deal with him brother I know devil can deal with you because you are age about by the pillar of Fire hallelujah oh you say how do I know that go and read the book of Job is spelled out there that even as you are going everywhere you are going you don't know that you are protected that's why some of us we are afraid for what we should not be afraid of let's apply faith amen and then one day is that sent him go to your brothers at the one front check their welfare give them what they need I have some provision and then he went fortunately for Goliath it was at that time it was making his noise how who is that your God send somebody let him fight me whoever wins shall be this champion and all that and all that and David had it I said what who is this uncircumcisability that's defined in the army of the Living God and people say shut up everybody around for cover David couldn't understand why they're running because those people don't know who they are Hallelujah oftentimes Children of the Kingdom recognize who they are may God open our eyes give us more Revelation and understand of who we truly are amen and then it wasn't satisfied they now told him this is what the man has been saying he said what shall be given to the man that kill him I want to know his brother's side they say oh baby you have started all they said he left them he doesn't have time for Frozen don't have time for that we Face our business because we know what we are talking about Hallelujah we are convinced and that's why we are concerned and then I moved to somebody that said I can do this job and they took him to the king time tested faith it wasn't David the king at that time it was just David the shepherd boy but the same Faith he had in God saw him through Hallelujah and then when he got to the king ah the King said oh I'm excited that we have a patriotic citizens you want to fight Goliath very good and then lecture them this guy he has been a Warrior from his youth in short it can't even carry his own Shield he has a special assistant for shoot carrying and everything and everything just to discourage this brother but David knew where he was standing amen he had an experience that nobody can take away from him break them with God who have experience and you cannot have that being just a church member you've got to find time with God a bad desert experience now you can say from this day I know the Lord is for me amen and then the king told him all the stories and he said well the king I've listened to you you need to listen to me because I have something to say hallelujah what is your testimony Hallelujah pray until something happened because something has got to happen he said if you ask Matthew 7 7 you shall be given if you knock the door shall be open so why are the doors not getting opened let's do so in fact because God can never lie amen he said King listen to me one time I was a Shepherd boy and then a beer they can say you mean a cat no a beer came after one of the Lambs I took the lamb and I kid you killed what they think it became becoming more interested saying that's not enough that's not all another time a lion came you killed a lion Hallelujah then the king knew that this boy has a testimony but the king wasn't satisfied is that okay you know I just need to protect you and now I want to give him coat of mail this coat of mail did not help the king the King was running but I now want to offer help Brethren let's be careful you know Hallelujah a Special Assistant you have some friend and so forth know where you get your advices from those advice is not even helping them how can they help you only the world can help you Hallelujah he said oh you need to put this on you know because that guy went through the arrow and all that they was okay put it on and Bible said I couldn't move that's what those ideas will do to you Hallelujah when they are contrary to the world you cannot move because you are World bound anything contract you will not move because I don't say a word for them you are not them he said you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood peculiar people your ways are different Hallelujah they are God may allow them but yours did not amen let's understand the differences and so I said King I have no problem this Lead Me what I have proven let me apply Goliath went down at the first strike amen Hallelujah oftentimes when we watch those films themselves you try this he didn't it's just one what the first strike Goliath went down because it wasn't that stone it was a god behind the stone Hallelujah it is not you it's a promise Christ said the ones that I speak to you their spirit and their life those words are alive they created the world we are living in now amen let Brandon let's believe God and so we saw David he conquered Goliath just with the belief that God that did this for me yesterday he will do it again today because Bible said Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever if God has done something for you in the past by them believing for today amen also we have another one Elijah we know if you Prophet Elijah they teach by Bible did not tell us any family history of Elijah he just said one of the inhabitants of tissue and then God spoke to him after he has prophesied you know he told Ahab look there won't be rain or due until I go for it and there I thought he was a joker in one of those crazy people they just talk anyhow but Elijah was certain of God he knew what he was talking about then after a while he had to knew that that man we need to look for him and Bible told us according to Obadiah that the search for Elijah everywhere and they get a confirmation oath that Elijah is not in the place but it was right there because it was protected Hallelujah we are in this world but we are not of the world sometimes they say are you still here I'm still there Hallelujah so Elijah now God told him after the dying of Brook charity God said go to zarifas I have prepared for you a widow woman you know you wonder how does God do things at times during famine it doesn't make logical sense but that's what God says and then it must be true sometimes it doesn't sound reasonable but brother and let's believe God amen okay so ignore I believe God and he went to zarifies and the Bible said when he got to the gate he saw the Widow and he said uh excuse me can you get me a cup of water and then the woman being a Christian because you know they've got to be of the same material if she wasn't a Christian when Elijah said give me a cup of what I say me an American woman obey you he will not work but there are the same material so when he told her she stood up saying okay while she was going here let's just say oh in addition bake me a cake he said as the Lord your God leave us I don't have anything the one I have me and my son that's what I'm preparing so that we can eat and die we are talking about time they said faith himself would be confused that what God what did God tell me what am I hearing but we are talking time they said face Faith doesn't look at the circumstance you only lean upon the word there has been a word to him that God here when you say this woman she will sustain you that's don't say the Lord the circumstance is irrelevant and I told her well go and do what you say but first big mind first for those fear the lord Hallelujah the Bible of me shall not waste not the crews of where dry unto the Lord God sent rain amen because Elijah believe what God told him so if this woman will sustain him then whatever she have must not finish it just follows brother and let's have faith in God amen and then also a man coming this same Elijah when he invited Arab and all the people and then I know the prophet of baby I believe 400 and they did all their stuff from morning till evening and they couldn't call any fire down because they don't have God the Bible said at the time of evening sacrifice even though we are calling god of fire but power down and they did it first and second and third time and then Elijah looked unto God he said God tonight these people know that this thing I have done is according to your word before I could finish fire came down amen if we are acting according to the word of God Brethren I believe God will respond Hallelujah let's move quickly also we have three Hebrew children all of us who know the story one time according to the prophet I am the prophecy of Jeremiah said they will go to captivity another 70 years after that God will bring them back these four boys they were among the people that were taken Daniel and Shadrach so they were there young boys like everyone some young people here today you know it doesn't mean that because you are young you should blame with the word because you are different Hallelujah we are a different people our ways are different and once you have made the call to follow Christ you must do so in totality amen it must be clear-cut Hallelujah so when they go out there they found favor and the King selected them among this special favorites to be fed with the king's meat and wine and then Daniel and the other three said no they went to the king's Chamberlain or the eunuch and say look um we can't hit this according to the promise of God to us and his word we don't take this kind of stuff and the the guy said what's wrong with you the king abortioned a portion for you if I didn't do that the king might kill me he said okay to avoid you being killed give us 10 days give us pause and water and check what happened if we are not okay then give us that but we know our God will do something time tested faith and Bible told us that after 10 days they look fatter fresher and better than the others feeding on the other things Hallelujah and as if that is not enough you know one success leads to another challenge amen they often say during World of success is more work because this one is to try us to try so that the best of us can come out that's why we are here really you know we are element of Eternity just look into time we go back to Eternity but why that is going on God is putting characters in US amen so then the King again had a dream and then when he woke up he couldn't remember the dream yet the dream was troubling him you know he couldn't remember and yet the thing is a burden to him so you call all the astrologers the magician all of them so all of you time has come you have been eating the king's meal come and do your work the second yes we are ready he said I had a dream last night and I need the interpretation okay no problem tell us a dream kings are forgotten huh the king said tell me now tell me the dream if you do then I will know you know the interpretation they told the king looking what you are asking for nobody asks for it in short only the gods whose dwelling is not with men they can do that they can't say you're alive it made another go and kill them if there is no solution so the weather go to Daniel and then the other three they call themselves they say oh King God they dream in this interpretation and order so the other three all of them they prayed I think Daniel chapter 2 they pray God make a way for us show us what this is about so that your name can be glorified you know all these things therefore the glory of God not for any personal Glory you know we are not here for self-glory God owns all the glory our blessings is our portion and that's what we always get amen so they prayed and then God showed them the dream show Daniel and the interpretation so they came to the king's guide and said oh God has done something so when they brought down there before the king he said King live forever this is your dream say you saw a big image massive having the head of God you know chest and arm of silver belly and thigh of brass and then leg iron feet iron mixed with Clay they can say yeah that's what I saw and he told the Kings the interpretation you are the head of God we know we are in the Roman Kingdom you know Babylonia Greek I mean Gulf Pasha and then Greek and then Roman you know I told the king this what you saw and the King was so happy you know what the king said Bible said the king worshiped him I know Kings don't bow but in the case of Daniel the king worship we did not just worship he said they should make oblations to him like they make a sacrifice for that why do you think you did that because the magician told him Only the Gods can do that so inside Daniel as a god and he worshiped him and today Christ said he are gods Hallelujah brother you need to be bold to say I'm a saint just say I am a saint I don't live in sin I'm only goes through possession bring I mean confession bring possession amen the prophet said if you say you are a saint you live like a saint they say you'll become a saint Hallelujah so whatever you confess so you are right so let's confess positive all the time and so when the king believed that Daniel he was a god do you know what he did next Bible told us he made an image a great image of God the prophet told that was the image of Daniel that's why Daniel was not in the picture because he doesn't have to buy for his image but the three other brothers are in trouble say one Victory lead to another challenge amen Don't Be Afraid as they come God will lift you above them each of those trials they are for promotion that's why Try has come ask the students every time they do an exam they get promotion Hallelujah they are only learning from God's way so when you face trance and Temptation know that there is a victory ahead there is a promotion ahead you have to sow higher as an ego may the Lord help us and so the king said and everybody wants to hear the music sound just bow for this great image for that is now your God and the King cannot understand why anybody cannot bow for it last of all his own friends I saw the message got to the king that oh some of these people three of them they refuse to Bow Brethren are they the only Jews in in that Babylon there are many others but who are the people standing for God Hallelujah sometimes they will say you're the only Christian well I'm not I don't know whether I'm the only one but where I am I've got to stand for Christ amen and so they can't come for them look my friends I you know I spoke timely with him he said I had but it's not a big deal are you ready to do it you know because instruction was anybody who don't do it they should be thrown into the fire no question but when they got to the king because they are who they are you know they are Governors and I say oh well I'm good are you ready there's a king who will not be careful to answer you in this matter we will not bow it doesn't matter if we are Governor or whoever's image you put there we will not bow we know that our god it will Deliver Us Hallelujah but even if he did not deliver us we will not bow oh Hallelujah those guys they were convinced and they were concerned there is no shaking they know where they are standing should be little wind air and their children Shake us you know those wings they are going to come they are to root us further you know have you noticed those trees when they Shake left and right front and back they gain more root that's what they are for Hallelujah and so the King was Furious say what are we talking about you guys are slaves and then you want to tell me what to do we can say the Bible said God the strongest man in Babylon to do what to bind them so that the hope of getting free is gone but now with God hallelujah Bible told us With God all things are possible amen even with you tonight hallelujah oh you said what are you talking about I'm standing by the word amen and the King said bind them throw them into fire and crucify her several times more let me see the god that we delivered him he also challenged God and God had him Hallelujah when the enemies are calling your hand God is hearing them Brethren breathe a prayer to God be the one to God In Prayer and they will respond and then he throw them there Bible even told us that those men who threw them into fire they died by reason of the flame then after a while the King was expecting that I mean the furnace will have finished the work then he looked and he said please come counselors everyone how many people there and the second three you say look I'm seeing four loose Hallelujah they were loose they are not even bound anymore what did the fire do to them about Brethren when You Face challenges you overcome it gives you more confidence it gives you more courage you strengthen your wings you can fly higher amen time-tested face is like the appearance of the son of God how did you know how Son of God looked like you know you've got but I used to say something if God need to use a donkey to talk so that the way we open the donkey we talk Allelujah he did this for my balam anything that needs to move they will move when wrestling was blocking the road of the student he moved don't think anything too impossible Hallelujah and there's nothing too big for God to do for you Bible told us if he did not spear his only begotten son he put him on that cross so that you can be saved how much more will he freely give you all things Hallelujah and we are ready here tonight that all things we need we will get them by faith bless increase our faith Hallelujah and so the king look the appearance of the fort was like the Son of God he said servant of the Living God come out they came out what happened he made a decree nobody in this land should serve any other God except the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego time tested face Hallelujah you know in the passive Viara someone preached by the prophet he said all people in this world who have done something great he said they have had faith even physical things requires faith spiritual faith is inevitable let's put that our faith into action then we will see the results Daniel on the other hand it was he had his own too the devil won't leave him alone look my dad he used to say because he grew from the village he said he had you know all those Hunters we have hunters that are going to the forest to hunt games and so forth they used to have Hunter's bag you know they kill all these small animals he said if they are put an animal in the bag will they chase the animal again because it's already in the bag you are not in the back that's why the devil will not leave you alone praise the Lord but you can't be in the bag so you must be ready for him all the time but we lose Hallelujah if brahmanas don't know if you come a thousand times he will go back empty-handed because we are not afraid to the Satan amen we are more than conqueror that's what the world said ah my time is up can you give me like 15 minutes or something please thank you God bless you so it was he was there in his own side serving is God then they try to find their skills trying to find fault they can't find anything you know the law of the land can't touch Christians because so you're already living by Ayah law hallelujah what do they want to say it's just part of your life once your Holy Ghost is except when they now want to go against the world so for Daniel why is he wrong they cannot find then what did they do they made the decision we cannot find the spot they said by the love is God yeah you know that's what we are going to squeeze too when they look look there's nothing to say then they'll now go and do something contrary to the world but the prophet told us we should not be afraid that will be a short quick walk you will see spoken word in manifestation Hallelujah Brandon we don't need to work it when the time comes it will come to action you just being shaped amen that's what they say oh this is Daniel King you know you are such a wonderful King oh nobody like you you know once they start pressing like that be checking your back because there's something up he said oh King yeah nobody like you oh looking silky okay they say we have drafted a decree because you are so nice King scientists nobody prayed to any other God except for you you are such a nice King you have been meeting all our needs answering our request the king well okay he didn't look through you know he didn't see the end of it so he signed sillies and then they say God don't touch them Hallelujah the God cannot catch his own son his son they are always with him Hallelujah and so they now started watching the set watch Daniel's house they know nobody this is the man of course Daniel doesn't do show off Christians we don't do show off we just live our life Daniel he prayed the number of times open the window face the temple that's what he used to do and then they reported to the King King live forever did you not say nobody should pray to any other God except you say yes I did and there's someone down here he's doing that you see one of the slips and the Bible said the king sought to deliver Daniel from Monday to evening they said no King the love medicine doesn't change with God he must go to the Lions then oh Hallelujah when the devil is at work one thing I know is only working for God oh he said what do you mean brother femi God is his creator allow him Brethren don't let's give too much power to Satan he doesn't have it Hallelujah we are the one that Empower him make him think that he's strong he's not in short Jesus said cast him out that's all don't be I mean putrified and harassed or down because of him you speak against him in the name of the Lord hallelujah but I say God bigger than the king who is still in the Play Hallelujah and then they say you must go into that place that's the law second no problem then they went joyful they can't say we are going to deliver you because I have labored sometimes they try to help you but vain is the help of man did not Bible tell us what to him that make flesh is trust let's put that trust in God all the time it cannot fail Hallelujah and then they throw him there waiting next morning the King was the first person there Daniel as your God delivered me King live forever Hallelujah time tested faith God will help us another time let me just read the quote um time tester Faith paragraph 25. just I want just God to reveal what we have said to our hearts so
