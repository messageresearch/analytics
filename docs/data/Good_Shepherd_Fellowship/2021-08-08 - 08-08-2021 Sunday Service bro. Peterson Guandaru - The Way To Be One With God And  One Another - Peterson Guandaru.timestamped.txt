[13:33] all right let's go ahead and see we have
[13:35] a testimony this morning
[13:37] brother johnny you are welcome
[13:42] [Music]
[13:49] good morning scent
[13:53] i don't know where to begin if you like
[13:55] me no it's overdue
[13:58] many times you know when i ask god to do
[14:00] something for me i tell him if you do it
[14:02] i will testify in your name but then i
[14:04] don't do it
[14:07] and then another one will come i do the
[14:10] same thing
[14:11] but i don't testify
[14:13] so today you know i'm gonna testify
[14:15] maybe just two things you know because
[14:18] there's so many things he has done in my
[14:19] life you know
[14:21] that
[14:22] tamil not allowed me not to start naming
[14:24] them
[14:25] but a month ago
[14:27] we went to kentucky to
[14:29] to go visit family as i was coming back
[14:32] with my three kids
[14:33] on our way back it started raining very
[14:35] hard and it was very hard for me to sing
[14:39] so i said oh father god
[14:41] it's kind of hard for me to to drive you
[14:42] know with this rain coming hard like
[14:45] this
[14:46] can you please stop it so that way no
[14:49] i'll be able to to to to drive clearly
[14:54] literally i know after maybe just five
[14:56] minutes stop running and i was amazed
[14:58] it's like i was shocked but this that's
[15:00] how we are we ask something and then
[15:02] when you come to pass he's like oh is
[15:04] that simple
[15:07] so it stopped raining
[15:10] till we got to
[15:11] minneapolis and then it started running
[15:13] a little bit and needed to say that you
[15:15] know
[15:15] we got home safe so thank god for that
[15:18] um
[15:21] the other thing
[15:23] for about a year i was working a third
[15:25] shift at my job you know so i had to
[15:28] leave my three kids by themselves or not
[15:30] and you can only imagine living you know
[15:32] your children are home by themselves you
[15:34] know during the night and i pray to god
[15:37] and i say god you have to change the
[15:38] situation
[15:39] and the thing sent each one of us you
[15:41] have to find a verse in the bible to
[15:44] identify yourself that you can erase on
[15:47] if you don't have it please do so you
[15:49] have to remind god
[15:51] what he's saying his word he say you
[15:53] will not forsake us or leave us the just
[15:55] will not suffer because of the injuries
[15:56] and so forth and so forth you will not
[15:58] put more on us than you can bear so
[16:00] every time when i pray you know i will
[16:01] always remind him of those things
[16:04] and by the grace of god he is able to
[16:07] change that situation
[16:08] now you know i have a better schedule
[16:12] so i thank god for that
[16:14] the other thing
[16:15] i was having depending on my elbow my
[16:17] right head bone for a while you know
[16:20] and i even went to my doctor to shoot
[16:22] some steroids but the pain was still
[16:23] going on and then last sunday when i
[16:26] came you know
[16:27] um
[16:28] bro the one you know pray
[16:30] and after that you know the pain went
[16:32] away till this day you know i don't have
[16:34] that pain anymore and
[16:38] i thank god for that um
[16:41] like i said you know there's so many
[16:42] things not to
[16:44] to thank god you know that time and if i
[16:46] stay here and it's going to take the
[16:47] whole service even my conversion um
[16:50] 10 years ago you know when uh
[16:53] i got to know the message it was through
[16:55] somebody else god used somebody else for
[16:56] me to come to the message and even
[16:58] when my pastor you know which later on
[17:01] overcome my pastor when he came to my
[17:02] house i was drinking beer and to to
[17:05] believe the message in united states is
[17:07] very hard because you know
[17:09] the world you know things of the world
[17:11] is so just i mean it's i mean
[17:12] the devil you know you put these things
[17:14] you know i mean when you're in you know
[17:15] you think this is it
[17:17] you know so
[17:19] anyway that's a testament for another
[17:20] day you know but
[17:22] for me to be here you know to stand here
[17:24] you know after
[17:26] almost 12 years not drinking no smoking
[17:29] it's just a grace of god so everything
[17:31] about me not just a testimony i mean i
[17:33] never knew the message
[17:37] i never knew the message in my life i
[17:39] just had to pass her pastor karen in
[17:41] kentucky and this and personal one and
[17:43] even me staying here you know i always
[17:45] want to go back to kentucky because
[17:47] that's a home for me that's where i live
[17:48] since 1991 so
[17:51] even to move here
[17:53] we had to go to counseling with my wife
[17:55] to convince me and of course you know
[17:57] the ladies away i mean you have to give
[17:58] your wife a chance you know my wife
[18:00] wanted to move here because her family
[18:02] is here
[18:03] and so i went and told my pastor i said
[18:05] i don't want to move i i can't do that
[18:07] and then you say well jenny this is a
[18:09] marriage you have to go your wife wants
[18:10] to go you know so the whole time you
[18:12] know it's always been a struggle but
[18:14] when i meet somebody you know every
[18:16] there's two things i tell them one of
[18:17] the things that is holding me here you
[18:18] know believe it or not is this small
[18:21] church and also my job i say no i have a
[18:24] good job you know and i love my church
[18:26] but when it was time for us to move here
[18:28] because i thought i was living
[18:29] everything that i thought was good and i
[18:31] had a big house i had a small small
[18:33] business so everything was going good
[18:34] for me you know i didn't see the need
[18:36] you know to come here you know and start
[18:38] over
[18:39] but i can honestly say that you know
[18:41] i've seen the hands of god in my life
[18:43] and the life of my children so sometimes
[18:45] you know the things that you hold on to
[18:47] you know are not the things that really
[18:49] matter and just to finish you know i had
[18:51] to meet
[18:52] her meet uh pastor one was probably
[18:55] about four years ago
[18:56] i was coming to
[18:57] [Music]
[18:58] to minnesota for a vacation me and my
[19:00] wife and the children so i told my
[19:02] pastor well i'm going to minnesota now
[19:04] and uh i want to be able not to go to
[19:07] to service on sunday do you know any
[19:09] minister over there so he said yeah i
[19:11] know one you know and he gave me the
[19:13] name of pastor one and when i called him
[19:15] he did not hesitate he came and met us
[19:17] and we fellowship and from that time on
[19:20] you know we became good friends so when
[19:22] it was time to move here it was very
[19:23] easy for me now because i already became
[19:26] friend with person one so
[19:28] i'm very grateful to all of you for your
[19:30] prayer
[19:32] um
[19:32] [Music]
[19:34] it's been very hard i mean you know it's
[19:35] been very hard i think you know some of
[19:37] you guys know that you know maybe about
[19:39] a month ago i was not coming to church
[19:41] it was a struggle you know i'm gonna
[19:44] leave you with this
[19:46] right now a lot of people are talking
[19:47] about the mental illness that thing is
[19:50] real i suffer from depression because of
[19:52] my situation my separation with my work
[19:54] and during that time you know when it
[19:56] comes sunday i did not want to come to
[19:58] church and of course the devil made it
[20:00] easy not just to watch on land so that
[20:02] was my excuse when if i don't go i can
[20:03] watch it online i can stream it but you
[20:06] know
[20:07] when you're streaming a service it's not
[20:08] the same than being in church
[20:11] because you know when
[20:13] when it came sunday i mean it was hard
[20:15] for me to get out of bed even going to
[20:17] ger i mean to working on is just because
[20:19] you know
[20:20] i got to if i don't work i don't eat i
[20:22] can pay my bills but if there was a way
[20:25] for me to make a living
[20:26] without going to work i mean during that
[20:28] time you know i was just staying home i
[20:30] mean it hit me very bad i mean i just
[20:32] wanted to lay down you know and things
[20:34] like that you know so
[20:36] when you see somebody in church you
[20:38] don't know what they're going through
[20:40] you don't know their situation or when
[20:42] you see somebody not coming to church
[20:44] you don't know you know
[20:45] what you're battling
[20:47] but mental illness is real
[20:50] mental illness is real
[20:52] i know you know there's a lot of things
[20:53] not we don't talk about in church but
[20:56] depression is real
[20:58] may god bless you richly
[21:04] put your hands together for jesus
[21:07] oh yes
[21:10] um brother ariel i think we'll kind of
[21:13] skip here a little bit because of time
[21:16] we have a lot of special i think we'll
[21:17] have to skip that time is fast paint
[21:20] so um let's go to song um 369 i'll fly
[21:24] away then we'll invite the pastor to
[21:26] come over
[21:27] amen
[21:31] the offering box is right at the back if
[21:33] you have your offering you can please go
[21:34] ahead and do so
[21:36] while the service goes on
[21:44] let's go ahead and start please
[22:08] when this life is over

[32:28] through the weekend

[32:32] lay my nephew to rest yesterday but the
[32:34] week was pretty busy
[32:36] pretty busy and
[32:37] working with
[32:38] all the families there and trying to

[32:45] the lord was gracious sin
[32:47] and
[32:48] i mean what a time what a time that we
[32:51] are living in
[32:52] and i don't believe that we are the only
[32:55] group of people
[32:57] that
[32:58] are ever going through time like this
[33:01] i believe that
[33:04] people in time past
[33:06] have experienced this most especially
[33:09] during the the times of past uh
[33:12] uh
[33:14] you know uh
[33:16] epidemic that have come upon the world
[33:18] like the black death and different
[33:19] things
[33:20] you know i mean some of those things
[33:23] whip out the whole
[33:24] family
[33:25] you know
[33:28] genocides in other countries
[33:30] whip out you know and and sometimes you
[33:33] know you just go from one
[33:35] one death to another it just looks like
[33:39] a kind of a
[33:40] dark cloud you know we just we just got
[33:43] out of the
[33:44] the
[33:46] funeral yesterday then and uh
[33:50] [Music]
[33:53] my wife went home to get some rest and
[33:56] and right in there the uh a lady that
[33:58] was close to her like a grandmother that
[34:01] she was caring for
[34:03] uh took her last birth so it's almost
[34:06] like we just went from one to another
[34:09] but you know the lord is gracious amen
[34:11] the lord is gracious uh
[34:14] he
[34:14] he
[34:15] he
[34:17] predestinated us for this hour this is
[34:20] our time
[34:22] and
[34:23] and i believe that we're not going to
[34:25] feel him
[34:26] praise the lord
[34:29] the prophet daniel saw this time
[34:32] and he said the people that know their
[34:34] god
[34:35] will do explode amen
[34:37] in the midst of everything
[34:39] we will do explode and it's not much in
[34:43] uh our ability of what we can do but
[34:46] it's just acknowledging him amen
[34:49] and
[34:50] giving all our praise to him giving all
[34:53] our weaknesses to him giving all our
[34:56] failures to him knowing that he promised
[34:59] he will never leave us
[35:01] he will never forsake us
[35:03] we can rest the show on there
[35:05] praise the lord
[35:07] amen
[35:09] you you just think about it you know
[35:11] i i saw brother brother
[35:14] peterson looking through the
[35:16] the fastest board of matches there in
[35:18] the office
[35:19] and you know and some of those things
[35:20] were just running through my mind what
[35:22] other people went through standing for
[35:24] the name of jesus christ
[35:25] you know i mean it's it's a it's a it's
[35:28] a pretty much
[35:30] delusion teaching or a false teaching
[35:34] for you to believe there when you become
[35:36] christian it's just going to be rosy for
[35:38] you i mean there are devils in hell that
[35:40] hate the name of jesus and hits you to
[35:43] identify with thy name
[35:45] praise the lord
[35:47] but our god is faithful praise the lord
[35:49] amen amen once again we greet you in the
[35:53] name of the lord jesus and uh
[35:56] [Music]
[35:58] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[35:59] this morning
[36:00] we have our friend uh brother
[36:04] pastor peterson
[36:06] gandaroo from
[36:08] nairobi kenya
[36:10] that is i just stopped by to see you
[36:12] this week and what a perfect time he
[36:13] came
[36:14] you know uh when my whole week was just
[36:17] so booked up with with different things
[36:20] and
[36:22] but uh
[36:24] i think it was a good service we had on
[36:26] wednesday night
[36:27] you know when when when a pastor tends
[36:29] to an evangelist then you know it's
[36:31] serious
[36:33] praise the lord but i believe that the
[36:35] holy ghost was mindful of us
[36:38] amen and i will tell you why
[36:41] i will tell you why i mean there were
[36:42] things that that uh
[36:45] brother peterson spoke on wednesday
[36:47] night
[36:48] i was sitting in my office at work
[36:51] and i was just going through some few
[36:53] scriptures
[36:54] and i wrote setting things down because
[36:57] of a situation
[36:59] and
[37:00] i just praying about it and said lord
[37:03] you know if that's what you want me to
[37:05] do i'm committing in your hands
[37:07] you know
[37:08] there were a few things that came to my
[37:10] knowledge and i thought that well i
[37:12] would need to address these things in
[37:13] church
[37:17] but you know what you don't want to do
[37:20] is that
[37:22] i've said that over and over here you
[37:24] never want to bring your anger
[37:26] behind the pulpit
[37:28] you know because
[37:30] god will only back his word
[37:32] god will not stand with your frustration
[37:35] or your anger
[37:36] and you could be under the wrong spirit
[37:38] saying the right thing
[37:40] you know and even though it is the right
[37:42] thing god will not back it because the
[37:44] spirit is wrong
[37:48] praise the lord so you have to get
[37:50] yourself right
[37:52] praise the lord
[37:54] so you know i had to get myself right
[37:57] because i was mad
[37:59] and i have to pray lord
[38:02] take it out of me take it out of me
[38:05] it's a spirit
[38:07] and i have to deal with it
[38:09] but i don't have to carry my anger to
[38:12] the pulpit
[38:13] so i can promise you i'm not angry
[38:16] amen
[38:17] i can promise you i'm not angry
[38:20] amen
[38:22] so uh but i mean there was a lot of
[38:24] wonderful things he said and and we we
[38:27] just appreciate the spirit of the lord
[38:29] coming i mean just after we came out of
[38:31] communion service and and he would come
[38:34] with their scripture from the book of
[38:36] you know corinthians taking the living
[38:38] out of the church you know getting after
[38:40] the foxes that support the vine you know
[38:42] what a beautiful way you know the
[38:45] presentation was it's not it's not
[38:48] it's not dealing with sin
[38:50] you know you go in the bulk of uh of of
[38:54] john
[38:55] uh let's let's turn that again first
[38:57] john
[38:58] first john let's turn there i'm not
[39:01] preaching here so don't stand up i'm
[39:03] just only greeting you
[39:05] the preacher will come
[39:07] we have a need here
[39:09] we will go into prayer right now
[39:12] for the knee that is before us
[39:14] but i just want to show you how
[39:16] important it was for the holy spirit to
[39:18] speak to us on wednesday night the way
[39:20] he did
[39:24] praise the lord we're looking into first
[39:25] john
[39:29] [Music]
[39:37] we're looking into first john first john
[39:39] chapter 1
[39:41] verse 8 that was how we close the
[39:43] service on wednesday night but i just
[39:44] want to show you something here
[39:52] first john chapter 1 verse 8 if we say
[39:54] that we have
[39:56] no sin we deceive ourself and the truth
[39:59] is not in us
[40:01] if we confess our sins
[40:04] now john is using
[40:08] two words
[40:10] speaking about two different things
[40:15] our sins
[40:16] are
[40:17] the mistakes
[40:19] our misbehaviors
[40:21] but if we say we have no sin
[40:26] which goes back to unbelief
[40:28] [Music]
[40:31] okay
[40:32] sin goes back and and you will see that
[40:34] beautifully in in the episode of first
[40:37] john ii john and ted john if you study
[40:40] it you will see how he went back and
[40:42] forth using those two words saints
[40:45] that speaks of our mistakes
[40:48] you know and sin that speaks of unbelief
[40:54] praise the lord so you see
[40:56] god
[40:58] deliver us from our sin which is our own
[41:02] belief
[41:04] but in the body of imperfection
[41:07] we think the things that we must not
[41:09] think we say the things that we must not
[41:11] say
[41:12] praise the lord
[41:16] and in that way we rob arms with the
[41:18] word
[41:20] that is the reason why we confess our
[41:24] sins
[41:28] are we together
[41:30] now so uh uh
[41:32] when he read
[41:34] that quote from the adoption series
[41:37] this is where the church
[41:39] is feeling
[41:41] on that walk
[41:44] and here john is saying when we walk in
[41:46] the light as he is in the light brother
[41:50] branham said the church is feeling on
[41:52] that walk our daily walk before god
[41:58] it's where we feel because it's so easy
[42:01] for us not to realize
[42:04] how we rub arms with the word
[42:10] so we we fell on that walk and he and he
[42:14] took this phrase and says
[42:17] our
[42:18] misbehaviors
[42:20] of
[42:20] unconfessions now before then i i i talk
[42:25] that as misbehaviors in the things that
[42:28] we do
[42:29] but the misbehavior is actually not
[42:32] confessing you're wrong
[42:34] even jesus when he taught the lord's
[42:38] prayer he says when you pray say father
[42:40] forgive us
[42:42] of our sins
[42:46] our trespasses
[42:47] now so to a believer that is born again
[42:51] and saved
[42:52] filled with the holy ghost it will be a
[42:55] misbehavior on your part if you believe
[42:58] that you don't have no wrongs
[43:00] [Music]
[43:06] it will bring the church to a complete
[43:08] failure
[43:09] because there is nothing in the word of
[43:12] god of sinless perfection
[43:16] no
[43:18] so every time we go to god
[43:21] we must say father
[43:24] forgive me of my trespasses
[43:26] failing to do that it will be a
[43:28] misbehavior
[43:30] because why you are not making use of
[43:33] the atonement that is speaking before
[43:36] the father
[43:38] if we don't have no mistake then we'd
[43:40] only want to be before the father
[43:43] [Music]
[43:49] praise the lord
[43:55] in a way that we miss josh thinks
[43:57] [Music]
[43:58] we hear things
[44:00] and we just random judgment without
[44:03] investigating it
[44:06] [Music]
[44:09] praise the lord
[44:10] now
[44:11] this is where i thought that god was
[44:13] very gracious to bring us their talk
[44:15] because in in alongside with that quote
[44:18] brother branham said
[44:20] that we could bring one before the
[44:22] church
[44:24] and pray for them
[44:27] and god will refuse
[44:29] to honor our prayer
[44:31] because we have this misbehavior
[44:35] of of uh uh uh
[44:39] you know seth rogers
[44:42] attitude
[44:46] so this morning we have a case that we
[44:48] will bring before the church for prayer
[44:51] and before we do that i want us to just
[44:55] go to the lord in prayer this morning
[44:58] and
[44:59] let's go to the lord in prayer
[45:01] while we bring this case before the
[45:03] church
[45:05] sister
[45:07] sister wilma says the kish will have to
[45:08] go back
[45:09] to see the doctor
[45:12] we know how
[45:16] the lord was gracious to us to
[45:18] to
[45:20] be able to grant our sister
[45:23] uh a level
[45:25] uh uh
[45:27] replacement liver surgery
[45:29] and uh
[45:32] she has to go back in
[45:34] to visit with her doctor
[45:36] and
[45:38] she will have to go back they will have
[45:40] to go and check
[45:41] on the liver
[45:43] it might be about a six hour surgery
[45:47] and
[45:47] [Music]
[45:50] so
[45:52] we want to bring her before the law this
[45:54] morning
[45:56] let's just buy our hearts before our
[45:58] sister come up
[46:00] let's take our house to the throne of
[46:02] grace this morning
[46:07] [Music]
[46:22] you all being mindful
[46:24] of his children y'all being mindful of
[46:28] us
[46:29] knowing that we will have a case to
[46:31] bring before the lord
[46:35] [Music]

[46:38] such mean of god let's play that first
[46:40] before we play only believe
[46:42] because i just want for every one of us
[46:44] to go in prayer this morning

[1:04:47] blessed
[1:04:50] extraordinarily blessed i thought you
[1:04:51] were
[1:04:53] like me and telling me come and see
[1:04:59] i answered back and told her
[1:05:03] my experience tells me that
[1:05:05] there is only one preacher
[1:05:09] and that preacher is the holy ghost
[1:05:14] and
[1:05:16] that preacher is preaching everywhere
[1:05:20] and he's walking everywhere
[1:05:24] so we can't have one spot where we have
[1:05:26] to go
[1:05:28] to fight god
[1:05:30] uh
[1:05:32] all other just to get blessed
[1:05:35] god is working with people his people
[1:05:39] i realized that when i came here on
[1:05:41] wednesday
[1:05:44] i felt the praises of god down there in
[1:05:46] new jersey
[1:05:47] in a
[1:05:48] church and when i came here after
[1:05:52] a short while
[1:05:53] i just felt the same presence
[1:05:56] and i felt the same god around here
[1:06:00] we have come to know through this
[1:06:02] message that is god working
[1:06:04] in his bride amen and wherever his bride
[1:06:07] is god is there working
[1:06:10] we all need different vessels that he
[1:06:12] uses
[1:06:14] to accomplish his work
[1:06:16] so we thank god so much
[1:06:18] for his goodness and for his mercy
[1:06:21] president of our lord
[1:06:24] all right this morning
[1:06:26] i have our two scriptures to read
[1:06:31] let us read from the book of genesis
[1:06:33] chapter one
[1:06:57] verse 36 and verse 27
[1:07:03] and god said let us make man in our
[1:07:05] image
[1:07:08] after our likeness
[1:07:11] i hope everything's okay
[1:07:13] can you hear me
[1:07:18] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:07:20] of the sea
[1:07:22] over the fall of the air
[1:07:24] and over the cattle and over all the
[1:07:26] earth
[1:07:27] and over every creeping thing that
[1:07:29] creepeth upon the earth
[1:07:33] so god created man in his own image
[1:07:38] in the image of god created he him
[1:07:41] male and female
[1:07:43] created he them
[1:07:47] our next reading is come from the book
[1:07:49] of john chapter 17.
[1:07:56] and verse 11
[1:08:01] and now i am no more in the world but
[1:08:03] these are in the world
[1:08:05] and i come to thee holy father keep
[1:08:07] through their own name those whom thou
[1:08:11] has given me
[1:08:13] that they may be one
[1:08:16] as we are
[1:08:19] verse 21
[1:08:21] that they all may be one
[1:08:24] as our father are in me
[1:08:28] and i in thee
[1:08:30] they also may be one in us that the
[1:08:33] world may believe
[1:08:35] that thou has sent me
[1:08:38] in the glory
[1:08:40] the glory which thou gives me i have
[1:08:44] given them
[1:08:45] that they may be one
[1:08:49] even as we are
[1:08:51] one
[1:08:59] the lord giving me grace
[1:09:03] i'll
[1:09:05] talk about
[1:09:08] another
[1:09:09] title my preaching this morning
[1:09:12] as the way to be one with god
[1:09:17] and with one another
[1:09:22] may the lord bless this one as we pray
[1:09:25] precious every father confess our
[1:09:27] inability
[1:09:29] and that's why god will come to you for
[1:09:31] strength and ability
[1:09:33] we pray that you speak to us
[1:09:37] and father
[1:09:39] i pray that you help me to include
[1:09:40] myself
[1:09:42] that you can take over the lord
[1:09:45] and speak to the people
[1:09:48] that are gathered here this morning
[1:09:50] i pray that you reveal yourself to them
[1:09:52] lord
[1:09:53] every statement that i may say father
[1:09:55] may be of value
[1:09:57] in their hearts and that you may reveal
[1:10:00] and give them the understanding you
[1:10:02] comment ourselves in your hands father
[1:10:04] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:08] may be seated
[1:10:16] okay
[1:10:38] uh
[1:10:52] the way to be one with god
[1:10:56] and with one another
[1:11:08] the union
[1:11:10] between ourselves at god
[1:11:15] is typed in marriage
[1:11:18] where there is supposed to be oneness
[1:11:20] between husband and wife
[1:11:24] therefore the african marriage union is
[1:11:26] a type of the heavenly
[1:11:28] marriage and union
[1:11:33] i'm reading some quotes
[1:11:38] now marriage is one sense a type is a
[1:11:41] type
[1:11:42] the ma the earth after a marriage is a
[1:11:44] type of the heavenly marriage
[1:11:46] now let's go over it just for a few
[1:11:48] moments to rehearse it
[1:11:50] a moment
[1:11:52] the first thing they all is there must
[1:11:55] be a decision made
[1:11:58] the first thing takes in natural
[1:12:00] marriage is a decision
[1:12:02] has to be made
[1:12:05] the young lady has to make her decision
[1:12:07] whether she wants this young man
[1:12:10] and the young man whether he wants the
[1:12:12] young woman
[1:12:13] there has to be a decision made and you
[1:12:16] have to make it yes
[1:12:19] she must be the only woman in the world
[1:12:22] that you love
[1:12:24] and he must be the only man if it isn't
[1:12:27] then you made a wrong decision
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] marriage is an individual decision
[1:12:39] you have to decide yourself
[1:12:43] to be married by this man
[1:12:46] to marry this girl
[1:12:50] i know it may not have a lot of meaning
[1:12:52] what i'm saying
[1:12:54] but it has a lot of meaning in our
[1:12:56] communities in africa
[1:13:00] in africa there are many communities and
[1:13:02] traditions
[1:13:04] that it is your father and mother that
[1:13:06] choose for you
[1:13:08] whom you are going to marry
[1:13:13] and i have witnessed
[1:13:15] just
[1:13:16] a young man goes home in the over the
[1:13:18] wicked
[1:13:19] the judge's young man not married
[1:13:22] and he comes back
[1:13:23] on on monday with a wife
[1:13:28] and you ask him what happened he says
[1:13:30] when i reached home i found my mother
[1:13:32] and my father had already organized
[1:13:34] for my bride and i just got ready at
[1:13:37] home so
[1:13:39] i just
[1:13:40] picked the lady now she's my wife
[1:13:45] of course we don't accept as such
[1:13:48] uh we know what the bible says yes but
[1:13:50] i'm showing you how it is
[1:13:52] what that all means it must be your
[1:13:54] decision yes
[1:13:56] there are some extreme cases
[1:14:01] i have one in mind in the certain
[1:14:03] community
[1:14:04] i was doing some evaluation in certain
[1:14:06] parts of our country
[1:14:08] actually is a remote area
[1:14:10] and in that area when a young man wants
[1:14:12] to marry
[1:14:14] you don't go to talk to the girl
[1:14:17] you have no business with a girl
[1:14:19] at that at that juncture
[1:14:21] all you need to go is go and talk with
[1:14:23] the father
[1:14:26] and you discuss with your father
[1:14:30] and you negotiate the dory
[1:14:33] five cows 20 cows
[1:14:35] normally it's very expensive about 20
[1:14:37] cows
[1:14:39] and then you go around and look for the
[1:14:41] cows
[1:14:42] all this time you have not talked to the
[1:14:44] girl
[1:14:45] you only identified the girl and you
[1:14:48] laughed you liked the girl
[1:14:50] let me not use the word love but you
[1:14:52] just liked
[1:14:55] and then
[1:14:57] you pay the cows
[1:14:59] and then the father says okay now that
[1:15:01] is settled you can go and look for the
[1:15:04] gavel overseas
[1:15:05] if you fight high in the river drawing
[1:15:07] some water
[1:15:09] well if you find her coming from the
[1:15:10] market
[1:15:12] you just take her and then
[1:15:15] you go hunting for the girl and you you
[1:15:17] get some young energetic men
[1:15:20] just to help you
[1:15:21] carry the girl you get the girl whenever
[1:15:23] she's you don't even talk you just carry
[1:15:25] her on your shoulder and
[1:15:26] holler into your house
[1:15:29] and he becomes your wife
[1:15:31] therefore when we are preaching this
[1:15:33] the prophecy the decision must be yours
[1:15:39] if he's a young man if he's a young man
[1:15:42] it's not your mother is heading for you
[1:15:44] it's not your community standing for you
[1:15:46] it's not the pastor even siding for you
[1:15:52] oh when people come to me i want to
[1:15:53] marry a certain guy pastor what do you
[1:15:55] think
[1:15:56] i tell them no it's up to you
[1:15:59] it's up to you
[1:16:01] i can't tell you to marry her or not to
[1:16:03] marry her it's up to you
[1:16:04] is your decision
[1:16:06] it got to be positioned
[1:16:08] because
[1:16:10] if i tell you mariha and then when you
[1:16:13] get home she becomes
[1:16:15] troublesome to you you come to blame me
[1:16:21] so it's up to you
[1:16:23] if you want to take a tiger and put it
[1:16:25] in your house and the tiger turns
[1:16:27] against you
[1:16:28] is up to you have you made that choice
[1:16:32] if you want to put a lie on a male lion
[1:16:35] in your house
[1:16:36] sister it's up to you you know a male
[1:16:38] lion does not hunt
[1:16:41] and when the female gets
[1:16:44] catches uh
[1:16:45] a prayer
[1:16:47] is that
[1:16:48] the la the male lion is first first one
[1:16:50] to eat
[1:16:52] no female wheat until the middle lion is
[1:16:55] satisfied
[1:16:56] if that's the kind of thing that you
[1:16:58] want to do is up to you that decision
[1:17:02] praise the name of the lord
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:05] and that's the way it is
[1:17:07] by making the decision for christ
[1:17:10] the first thing you have to do is make
[1:17:12] up your
[1:17:13] mind whether you are going to serve god
[1:17:16] and take him as your savior yes
[1:17:20] this is a decision you have to make
[1:17:24] not your mother
[1:17:25] not your father
[1:17:29] a young man a young woman you come to an
[1:17:32] age where you have to make a decision
[1:17:34] about christ
[1:17:36] it's not a family religion
[1:17:40] here some some of the effects of the
[1:17:43] young people and the young young people
[1:17:45] say oh
[1:17:46] when people ask why don't you wear
[1:17:48] trousers
[1:17:49] he said no i call according to a church
[1:17:51] we don't wear
[1:17:54] he's not according to a church it must
[1:17:56] be your decision and you must be able to
[1:17:59] defend your decision because it's yours
[1:18:02] whatever teaching whatever doctrine
[1:18:04] whatever behavior
[1:18:05] you must be personally answerable
[1:18:09] because you made a decision about their
[1:18:11] faith
[1:18:14] it's not the church
[1:18:18] it's you
[1:18:21] you hear the word of god it's preached
[1:18:23] to you you make a decision
[1:18:25] amen amen
[1:18:27] no so you have to make up to make your
[1:18:29] decision serve god or take him as your
[1:18:31] savior or you're not going to do it
[1:18:34] the reason why it must be your decision
[1:18:36] is because in your faith
[1:18:38] you will be persecuted
[1:18:42] you will suffer
[1:18:45] so if it is not your own decision
[1:18:48] you will be defeated you'll not be able
[1:18:49] to fight for it yes
[1:18:51] something that is your choice you'll be
[1:18:53] able to defend and fight for your choice
[1:18:55] that's right so it has been your choice
[1:18:59] amen we find that it's very common with
[1:19:01] the
[1:19:02] children of believers they grow in the
[1:19:04] faith they grow in the church
[1:19:06] from the time they were just small there
[1:19:08] was god bless you god bless you so god
[1:19:10] bless you became something that is like
[1:19:11] a tradition you see
[1:19:13] like the order of things
[1:19:15] oh god bless you god bless you
[1:19:18] and finally sometimes you find that you
[1:19:20] have reached the age of maybe nine years
[1:19:22] or ten years and then the mother asks
[1:19:24] you oh you know now you have reached the
[1:19:26] age of ten years of contability can you
[1:19:28] be baptized
[1:19:30] yes you can be how can you be baptized
[1:19:32] it's not decision
[1:19:33] it's not the age it's not reaching to
[1:19:35] the edge is he reaching to the decision
[1:19:38] to follow christ amen
[1:19:41] now
[1:19:42] so whether you're going to serve god and
[1:19:44] take him as your savior or you are not
[1:19:46] going to do it are you going to serve
[1:19:48] the world
[1:19:49] are you going to serve christ you have
[1:19:51] to make up your might there has to be a
[1:19:53] decision made when you make up your
[1:19:55] might that you are either going to serve
[1:19:58] god or mama then you take your choice
[1:20:00] but the decision has to be made
[1:20:06] praise the name of the lord
[1:20:08] i do believe that i'm sitting in front
[1:20:11] of people that at one time in their life
[1:20:13] they made a decision to first serve god
[1:20:16] they made a decision to follow the
[1:20:18] message
[1:20:20] praise the name of the lord
[1:20:22] now ascension must be made and then
[1:20:24] after the decision is made
[1:20:26] that you are then comes the engagement
[1:20:29] that is the marriage now
[1:20:31] that you find that at the altar
[1:20:34] you find that at the altar get to the
[1:20:36] altar
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:39] at the altar
[1:20:41] you pledge your engagement to that
[1:20:44] girl to that boy
[1:20:48] you have got to make an engagement
[1:20:49] before the union can be
[1:20:52] and that's the way it is with christ
[1:20:54] church it has to be an engagement with
[1:20:56] christ
[1:20:58] a pledge
[1:21:00] an engagement
[1:21:02] i love affair
[1:21:06] amen amen with christ
[1:21:09] is a pledge
[1:21:12] i pledge to serve him i pledge to work
[1:21:14] with him i pledge to walk by his wife
[1:21:18] i pledge to live for him
[1:21:21] you are engaged to christ and that one
[1:21:23] now becomes a love affair
[1:21:26] between you and christ
[1:21:28] when you say you love god you love
[1:21:30] christ is a love affair
[1:21:32] that has taken place in your life
[1:21:34] and then the next thing is promise made
[1:21:36] there has to be promises made to one
[1:21:38] another
[1:21:39] like that you make
[1:21:40] promise so that if you marry me i
[1:21:44] promise that i'll be loyal and true
[1:21:47] i'll look upon no other woman
[1:21:50] or i look upon no other man
[1:21:52] and i'll do all that as a duty as a wife
[1:21:55] we have children it will do
[1:21:58] to do all as a duty as a mother
[1:22:01] i'll be a housekeeper
[1:22:03] all these promises
[1:22:06] has got to be made
[1:22:08] or should be
[1:22:10] in the correct wedding
[1:22:13] i encourage the young people
[1:22:15] who are preparing to get marriage
[1:22:18] to have a lot of conversation
[1:22:20] and discussion
[1:22:23] you don't just walk into a marriage
[1:22:25] without any
[1:22:27] promises
[1:22:30] you got to know one another
[1:22:32] you go to understand
[1:22:34] what one believes
[1:22:36] about the family there's one one young
[1:22:39] man and one guy who walked into my
[1:22:41] office
[1:22:42] in the church and told me okay we want
[1:22:44] to get married
[1:22:46] i ask them how much how
[1:22:49] for how long have you known each other
[1:22:53] they told me one month
[1:22:57] i told them wake up and go
[1:22:59] never come to this office of mine
[1:23:02] until about three four months
[1:23:06] how do you just speak just a stranger
[1:23:09] in rushing to the off to the
[1:23:12] office of the pastor and you start
[1:23:13] talking about marriage
[1:23:16] you don't know that man you are you are
[1:23:18] marrying a stranger you got to know each
[1:23:20] other you go to discuss you got to to
[1:23:22] engage one another and talk
[1:23:25] i tell them talk about money issue
[1:23:28] because in marriage you fight their
[1:23:29] money becomes a problem
[1:23:31] so discuss the principles of your
[1:23:34] of your finances
[1:23:38] talk about it
[1:23:40] talk about how many children you are
[1:23:41] going to have
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] you go to before you get into that
[1:23:46] engagement discuss about it
[1:23:49] there are some men that want their wives
[1:23:52] to have 20 children
[1:23:56] 15
[1:23:58] and they have a scripture
[1:24:00] replenish the earth
[1:24:05] but brother madam said you're not the
[1:24:06] only one that is going to feel the world
[1:24:08] give also the chance for the other
[1:24:10] people
[1:24:11] all to fear their part it's not you
[1:24:12] alone
[1:24:15] so you can't discuss that because it
[1:24:17] brings problems in marriage let's try to
[1:24:19] bring problems
[1:24:22] yeah
[1:24:25] like you know like in our community my
[1:24:27] community
[1:24:29] you so we name our
[1:24:30] children according to our to a narrative
[1:24:33] for example if i get a first born
[1:24:36] son is named after my father
[1:24:38] if i get a daughter he's named after my
[1:24:40] mother
[1:24:42] the second bone he was a boy is named
[1:24:44] after
[1:24:45] the father of
[1:24:47] or my wife
[1:24:48] if he is a girl is named after
[1:24:50] like that like that like that therefore
[1:24:53] even if i got 20 children their names
[1:24:56] are already there
[1:24:59] and my and my relatives
[1:25:01] put pressure
[1:25:03] they say you must be a one after me
[1:25:07] how can you stop there before you have
[1:25:10] given back to one after me
[1:25:12] so if you're not careful you can get on
[1:25:15] bearing
[1:25:16] and you're bearing for other people they
[1:25:18] don't look after those children you're
[1:25:20] the one who look after them
[1:25:24] so
[1:25:26] these are discussions you discuss
[1:25:29] you have to know how to go about those
[1:25:31] areas
[1:25:32] promises
[1:25:34] i'll do this
[1:25:36] yeah i'll stay at home and look up the
[1:25:38] children do you agree to do that
[1:25:41] yeah
[1:25:42] or you just want to work in the office
[1:25:44] you've got to agree on those things
[1:25:46] so that these things don't bring
[1:25:47] problems later
[1:25:49] so there has to be an uh a promises
[1:25:53] now and that is very important the issue
[1:25:55] of promises is very important
[1:25:58] amen
[1:26:00] and that's the same thing when you come
[1:26:02] to christ lord if you receive me in your
[1:26:05] kingdom i promise yeah you are i love
[1:26:08] you i'll be true to you i'll serve you

[1:26:13] that
[1:26:14] i'll serve you day and night
[1:26:16] i'll fast
[1:26:18] i'll pray
[1:26:19] we forget
[1:26:20] that i'll be going to church
[1:26:24] and then you forget that
[1:26:26] and then you start live streaming at
[1:26:27] home sitting at home live streaming
[1:26:32] you don't belong to any church you don't
[1:26:33] go to any church
[1:26:40] let me talk like i'm talking to my
[1:26:41] church
[1:26:42] you don't just sit at home and have
[1:26:44] the tips on sunday
[1:26:46] soccer to have
[1:26:48] tips but church is church
[1:26:52] time for church is church you must have
[1:26:54] a pastor
[1:26:56] you must have the people that you
[1:26:58] fellowship with
[1:27:00] you worship with
[1:27:02] you make promises but you don't keep
[1:27:03] them
[1:27:07] as soon as we forget that i'll serve you
[1:27:10] dare night our first our prayer below to
[1:27:12] you i'll bring my thai things into the
[1:27:16] storehouse i'll pray many times a day
[1:27:19] i'll do anything
[1:27:21] and i pledge
[1:27:23] all my love to you
[1:27:25] that's what you should do
[1:27:28] that is exactly right
[1:27:30] you promised
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:34] and it should come from your heart
[1:27:40] the promise should come from
[1:27:42] your heart
[1:27:47] i'm emphasizing that
[1:27:49] i'm stopping so they can soak in you the
[1:27:51] promise
[1:27:53] must come from your heart
[1:27:58] if you promise your husband that and not
[1:28:01] from your heart
[1:28:05] yep in other words you don't mean it
[1:28:08] if you are absolutely not living
[1:28:10] correctly with him you are
[1:28:12] you are absolutely not living correctly
[1:28:15] with him
[1:28:17] is kind of a criticalized affair
[1:28:20] it's a very serious thing you make the
[1:28:22] promise but you don't keep it you don't
[1:28:23] need to keep it
[1:28:26] why would somebody just make a promise
[1:28:28] just want to fasten you know to make the
[1:28:30] marriage very fast very fast
[1:28:34] it's because
[1:28:38] maybe your purpose of marriage
[1:28:40] you just want to get married
[1:28:46] yeah
[1:28:47] so when you promise you do those things
[1:28:51] you don't mean it
[1:28:56] because if your girl maybe what you want
[1:28:59] when you say
[1:29:00] when you tell the man i love you
[1:29:04] you actually don't mean it what you mean
[1:29:07] i love your money
[1:29:10] that's what you are saying
[1:29:13] all right
[1:29:14] and i love your money because your money
[1:29:16] can finance my my the taste of my
[1:29:19] lifestyle
[1:29:21] the kind of lifestyle that i want to
[1:29:22] live so you don't mean it
[1:29:26] you're not faithful in your statement
[1:29:32] and on the other hand the man is talking
[1:29:34] about oh i'll do this i'll do this i'll
[1:29:36] do this you are this you allah i love
[1:29:37] you so much i love you this what what
[1:29:39] what
[1:29:40] some of them i say oh i love you so much
[1:29:43] when i think about you i cannot even eat
[1:29:45] and if you look what he ate last night
[1:29:53] you don't mean it
[1:30:03] if you promise your house by that and
[1:30:05] not from your heart you mean it you are
[1:30:07] absolutely not living correctly with him
[1:30:10] it's a kind of crucial fear now look
[1:30:11] here if you haven't got teeth
[1:30:14] this is the example
[1:30:16] the example of
[1:30:17] that condition where you give the
[1:30:19] promise
[1:30:21] and keep that in mind about christ
[1:30:25] and you don't actually mean it
[1:30:28] it's like this
[1:30:30] if you haven't got teeth
[1:30:32] and you use false teeth now
[1:30:34] that's all right
[1:30:36] it is substituting for the teeth that
[1:30:38] you once had but actually those teeth
[1:30:40] are not connected with you
[1:30:44] it's not part of you
[1:30:47] if you had an arm amputated
[1:30:49] and you put a force arm on
[1:30:51] well that arm is actually not connected
[1:30:53] with you
[1:30:54] it's just stuck on you
[1:30:57] it's not connected with you
[1:30:59] that kind of a marriage
[1:31:01] that kind of relationship
[1:31:04] is like the relationship between
[1:31:06] teeth the natural teeth
[1:31:08] and the first teeth
[1:31:11] they are not connected
[1:31:14] they have no relationship
[1:31:18] well
[1:31:20] both of those teeth are in the same
[1:31:22] mouth
[1:31:24] they show
[1:31:26] they sell food together
[1:31:29] but they are not connected
[1:31:32] you will be leaving the same house
[1:31:35] you may be walking out together in the
[1:31:38] morning as you go to work and drive in
[1:31:40] the same car
[1:31:42] but if the promise you made to one
[1:31:43] another was not correct
[1:31:46] you never meant it
[1:31:47] actually you are not connected
[1:31:51] coming out of the same door living in
[1:31:53] the same room does not connect you
[1:31:56] the thing that connects you is that
[1:31:58] sincere honest promise to one another
[1:32:08] if i take very cold water
[1:32:11] in my mouth
[1:32:12] ice water
[1:32:15] the natural teeth will complain
[1:32:20] the first teeth will say
[1:32:22] what are you talking about
[1:32:24] what's wrong because they cannot
[1:32:26] participate in the pain
[1:32:29] and the feelings
[1:32:33] that's the kind of marriages sometimes
[1:32:34] you have because you are not connected
[1:32:37] you cannot share the joy you cannot
[1:32:40] share
[1:32:41] the disappointments of one another
[1:32:44] you cannot share the feelings of one
[1:32:46] another you cannot grieve together
[1:32:52] because you are not connected
[1:32:56] you wonder why are these two people so
[1:32:59] different because they don't have the
[1:33:01] feeling of one another because they were
[1:33:02] never collected in the beginning
[1:33:07] if i have a la force
[1:33:09] hand
[1:33:16] and
[1:33:17] on the other hand i had an accident the
[1:33:19] other hand was broken
[1:33:21] his heart has no feelings
[1:33:24] just can get connected there's a
[1:33:25] fellowship
[1:33:27] with the other bloodless of their body
[1:33:31] it's not condemned there's nothing
[1:33:32] there's no union
[1:33:34] remember i'm talking about
[1:33:36] the way to be one with god
[1:33:38] and with one another the connection
[1:33:45] praise the name of the lord
[1:33:47] now
[1:33:49] so
[1:33:50] there are people that are in that
[1:33:52] marriage condition that they are not
[1:33:54] actually connected
[1:33:56] they are not united
[1:33:58] because everything that unites is that
[1:34:00] genuine and honest promise to one
[1:34:03] another
[1:34:04] and the prophet said even if a girl and
[1:34:06] a young girl and a young boy
[1:34:09] got to that level of that kind of a
[1:34:10] commitment honest anxiety to one another
[1:34:13] that is marriage
[1:34:17] that's the one that brings the union
[1:34:22] now and the prophet makes some certain
[1:34:24] hear that
[1:34:25] and when we take our pledge to christ if
[1:34:27] we don't become part of him like a woman
[1:34:29] ought to become part of a man and a man
[1:34:31] part of the woman then we are artificial
[1:34:34] christians
[1:34:36] this morning i'm talking about
[1:34:37] artificial christians
[1:34:39] you have never made a pledge to christ
[1:34:41] you have never entered into a love
[1:34:43] affair with him because you have never
[1:34:46] been honest with him
[1:34:48] and have a moment of yourself between
[1:34:51] you and christ
[1:34:53] excluding anybody else including your
[1:34:55] parents including anybody else you
[1:34:57] arrive for your husband but it's you and
[1:34:59] christ and you are establishing a person
[1:35:02] no
[1:35:02] pledge to him
[1:35:04] to serve him and pray for him
[1:35:07] not anybody pushing you to come to
[1:35:08] church
[1:35:10] when you have come to your personal
[1:35:12] pledge to christ and you have a love
[1:35:13] affair to christ there is nobody that's
[1:35:15] going to push you to come to church
[1:35:18] no
[1:35:19] nobody is going to push you to pray
[1:35:21] nobody is going to to follow you up to
[1:35:23] feel like to live for what
[1:35:25] you will leave the world whether there
[1:35:27] is anybody around you or nobody around
[1:35:29] you you are obligated to jesus christ
[1:35:33] and to the relationship that you already
[1:35:35] have established with christ
[1:35:41] this is what we need to have
[1:35:43] this is what we have to be sure and it
[1:35:46] is there with us
[1:35:48] with every one of us
[1:35:52] here sometimes you wonder whether we
[1:35:53] really are in that level
[1:35:57] you fight when the husband stops coming
[1:35:58] to church
[1:36:00] the wife also stops
[1:36:03] and goes out of the church for six
[1:36:04] months
[1:36:05] when the man comes back to church the
[1:36:07] wife also troops back in the church do
[1:36:11] you have your own study
[1:36:14] do you move by the impulse of your
[1:36:16] husband do you have your own personal
[1:36:19] start with christ
[1:36:24] when your husband backs right you also
[1:36:25] backslide
[1:36:30] there has to be a personal relationship
[1:36:39] and when we take our pledge to class if
[1:36:41] we don't become part of him like a woman
[1:36:42] ought to become part of a man and a man
[1:36:44] part of the woman then we are artificial
[1:36:46] christians
[1:36:50] the description of that condition is
[1:36:51] artificial you're not real you're just
[1:36:54] like a false truth
[1:36:57] with christ
[1:37:00] you are just like a false truth with
[1:37:02] christ
[1:37:04] you are in church you are praying
[1:37:07] you are singing but you are artificial
[1:37:10] christian
[1:37:22] we are not here you are really not
[1:37:24] married to that woman
[1:37:25] that's the polish if it is like that
[1:37:27] that's not marriage
[1:37:30] we are not here you are really not
[1:37:32] married to that woman you might be loyal
[1:37:35] if you don't love your husband
[1:37:37] and him 60 or 70 years old
[1:37:40] and you don't love him as good as you
[1:37:42] did at the beginning
[1:37:44] then you are really just raising his
[1:37:46] children
[1:37:48] there is something that is in our
[1:37:50] country that is called
[1:37:52] calm with tea
[1:37:54] i don't know whether you know anything
[1:37:55] like that
[1:37:59] have you ever heard of it
[1:38:01] calm we stay
[1:38:03] arrangement
[1:38:05] what it is is that a
[1:38:06] a man just takes a woman
[1:38:09] and they start living together
[1:38:12] they have not
[1:38:14] commit they are not committed to each
[1:38:16] other
[1:38:19] you ask her is this your husband you say
[1:38:21] no we just live together is this your
[1:38:23] wife no we just live together it's an
[1:38:25] arrangement to stay together
[1:38:28] and they get children in those
[1:38:30] circumstances they have children
[1:38:33] and then there's a certain point
[1:38:35] they may
[1:38:36] they may part everyone goes his own way
[1:38:39] there was no marriage
[1:38:42] they are not committed to each other
[1:38:45] in the government listener was trying to
[1:38:47] pass around and saying
[1:38:49] if you have that calm we stay
[1:38:53] situation
[1:38:55] and you continue like that for a certain
[1:38:57] number of years
[1:38:58] the government will consider you are
[1:39:00] married
[1:39:04] of course to me that is wrong because
[1:39:06] marriage is not stinging together for
[1:39:09] wrong people
[1:39:11] it's a commitment that you make to each
[1:39:13] other that's what makes her a marriage
[1:39:17] many people have that
[1:39:20] and the sad thing is that the people who
[1:39:22] may think they are married but because
[1:39:24] there was any no genuine
[1:39:27] commitment to each other
[1:39:29] they are leaving that state and the
[1:39:30] brabham says what what is what is that
[1:39:32] now
[1:39:35] he says this
[1:39:37] 17 years and you don't love him as good
[1:39:39] as he did at the beginning then you are
[1:39:41] really just erasing his
[1:39:44] children
[1:39:47] you are not in a condition of marriage
[1:39:49] just amazing student
[1:39:53] that's the way the churches are too
[1:39:55] to uh too many today we are just taking
[1:39:58] the name of christian church
[1:40:00] pretending to be the bride
[1:40:02] when it is artificially
[1:40:04] we are not connected with christ in any
[1:40:06] way
[1:40:09] we are like an
[1:40:10] artificial truth
[1:40:13] artificial arm artificial eye see
[1:40:16] is something that is artificial
[1:40:18] if you are just putting it on
[1:40:21] where you can put on christianity you
[1:40:23] have got to be connected with it
[1:40:27] so this morning i'm saying we've got to
[1:40:28] be connected with christ we've got to be
[1:40:31] connected with god
[1:40:34] marriage is a connection is a union
[1:40:39] and they must get into that condition
[1:40:42] now
[1:40:45] let me come to this now
[1:41:00] what is the way to be connected
[1:41:07] how do we get connected
[1:41:09] with god
[1:41:12] because that's what type
[1:41:14] we've got to come to the review the
[1:41:16] connection
[1:41:17] between
[1:41:18] us as individuals to christ
[1:41:42] now
[1:41:42] the first man and the first woman in the
[1:41:45] garden of eden
[1:41:48] was in perfect harmony with god
[1:41:53] so much that god could come down at any
[1:41:55] time he desired
[1:41:58] and talk left to ear with adam and eve
[1:42:03] now that is perfect
[1:42:06] oneness
[1:42:10] god and his creation
[1:42:12] god speaking left to ear with adam and
[1:42:14] eve and they were so perfect in harmony
[1:42:16] with god
[1:42:18] till they are one with god
[1:42:20] god and his family
[1:42:23] was one
[1:42:26] we are fighting
[1:42:28] the connection here we are filing the
[1:42:31] oneness
[1:42:32] that was there between god and his past
[1:42:34] family
[1:42:37] god
[1:42:39] would come down at any time he desired
[1:42:44] and note
[1:42:46] god coming down
[1:42:48] to his people is a sign
[1:42:52] of
[1:42:53] oneness
[1:42:55] his presence in the church
[1:42:58] he is a sign of the oneness
[1:43:02] between christ and his church
[1:43:05] and this is what demonstrated his
[1:43:07] oneness with his family because he was
[1:43:08] frequent frequent in the
[1:43:12] in the ministry coming down to talk to
[1:43:14] them
[1:43:16] and also god talked to them live to ear
[1:43:20] with him
[1:43:23] god and his family
[1:43:24] they were one
[1:43:27] when god comes and speaks to our church
[1:43:28] here when god comes and he presses here
[1:43:33] is a union that is there between
[1:43:35] there is a relationship between us and
[1:43:38] christ
[1:43:39] by showing his presence
[1:43:41] and god talking to us
[1:43:45] remember when there was a disconnection
[1:43:47] between saul and god
[1:43:50] god never spoke to saul
[1:43:52] neither by dream
[1:43:54] nor by uri muthumi
[1:43:56] no in any manner the communication was
[1:43:59] totally cut off
[1:44:02] because they were not they were
[1:44:03] disconnected
[1:44:05] so what is connected with god
[1:44:08] when the church is disconnected with god
[1:44:10] god never speaks
[1:44:12] god never deals with our church
[1:44:15] and so
[1:44:16] we see when god was coming down every
[1:44:19] time and talking with them and
[1:44:21] conversing with them speaking to them
[1:44:23] left to ear
[1:44:26] it was the connection that was there
[1:44:28] between god and his family
[1:44:30] and
[1:44:31] saying that that was a perfect union
[1:44:35] with his family
[1:44:37] now and i do believe that
[1:44:41] god
[1:44:42] purpose today
[1:44:46] is to have
[1:44:48] the same kind of a union
[1:44:51] with his church
[1:44:53] because god still has a family
[1:44:56] do you believe that
[1:44:58] and in the same way that he wanted to
[1:45:01] have a such a kind of a union with his
[1:45:04] family
[1:45:05] in the beginning
[1:45:06] that is the same thing that god has in
[1:45:09] mind today
[1:45:12] to be in union
[1:45:14] with his family
[1:45:17] now i i normally ask this question
[1:45:21] why is god not talking to us
[1:45:23] in such a manner of course god speaks to
[1:45:25] us with his word
[1:45:28] correct but god was coming personally
[1:45:31] there and appearing before them
[1:45:34] god has ever appeared to his people
[1:45:37] frequently like he did in the church of
[1:45:39] islam as they were moving from egypt to
[1:45:41] the promised land with a pillar of fire
[1:45:43] and all that
[1:45:44] showing how the union he earned with his
[1:45:47] people
[1:45:49] now
[1:45:50] uh if god is not speaking to us
[1:45:53] frequently as he did and in the same
[1:45:56] manner that he did in the beginning is
[1:45:58] not because that god has stopped
[1:46:01] to love that kind of union
[1:46:05] it is either because
[1:46:09] there is something that is separating us
[1:46:11] from him
[1:46:16] otherwise that is the perfect will of
[1:46:18] god
[1:46:19] that he may have that kind of a union
[1:46:22] with his church
[1:46:23] so we shall see as you go on
[1:46:27] now
[1:46:28] okay this is a kind of union we see the
[1:46:30] heart god was coming down there
[1:46:32] frequently talking to them conversing
[1:46:34] with them talking to adam and eve left
[1:46:37] to ear all that union was there and
[1:46:39] that's a demonstration of the kind of
[1:46:41] union that god had with his first family
[1:46:45] now
[1:46:46] why do they have that kind of a union
[1:46:53] the reason was because
[1:47:00] another let me read this that's god's
[1:47:02] purpose
[1:47:03] god's purpose is for
[1:47:05] him to however the same kind of a union
[1:47:08] with his family
[1:47:11] praise him otherwise if god has a family
[1:47:13] today which i believe he has is that
[1:47:15] right
[1:47:16] that is a same purpose he has for that
[1:47:18] family
[1:47:20] to be not perfect union with that
[1:47:22] particular family
[1:47:24] and his purpose as a father supreme was
[1:47:26] to be one with his family athletic
[1:47:28] family adam and eve
[1:47:31] and they're only that they could be one
[1:47:33] with a family
[1:47:36] what was a principle what was abiding
[1:47:39] thing that was there that brought this
[1:47:41] union
[1:47:44] and the only way that they could be one
[1:47:46] with a family or with god
[1:47:49] was because
[1:47:51] god's nature
[1:47:53] was in them
[1:47:58] praise the name of god
[1:48:00] if there is a family of god somewhere
[1:48:02] and it's not having any union
[1:48:05] with god and not having that close union
[1:48:09] is because
[1:48:11] the church
[1:48:13] has gotten another nature
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:17] but the thing that made god
[1:48:20] and his first family to be so united is
[1:48:22] because
[1:48:24] in the beginning genesis chapter 1 26
[1:48:28] god created them
[1:48:30] in his image
[1:48:33] so they shared a portion of god's nature
[1:48:37] and because of that nature
[1:48:39] that is a factor that made them to be
[1:48:41] united
[1:48:43] nature
[1:48:46] praise the name of the lord yes brother
[1:48:48] preached this message called the lamb of
[1:48:50] the deaf he said when the dove came down
[1:48:52] which was the holy spirit
[1:48:54] and it could never settle on any other
[1:48:57] animal
[1:48:58] except the lamp
[1:49:00] why did it sit on the lamp because
[1:49:02] the holy spirit or the dove and the lamp
[1:49:05] they share the nature
[1:49:08] and that's the only way that thou that
[1:49:10] that now death could come into the lamp
[1:49:12] the lamp could not come into a dog
[1:49:15] could not come into a into a roof
[1:49:18] because there was a contrary nature
[1:49:23] therefore if there is going to be a
[1:49:24] union between god and ourselves
[1:49:28] something must come and impart in us
[1:49:31] god's nature
[1:49:34] just like the first family
[1:49:37] that nature
[1:49:39] must be put in us
[1:49:41] and by that nature
[1:49:43] we share the same nature with god
[1:49:46] then it brings a union
[1:49:50] may the name of the lord be glorified
[1:49:54] that's what made them
[1:49:56] to have
[1:49:58] that oneness
[1:50:00] god put in them
[1:50:02] during the creation
[1:50:04] he put his nature
[1:50:06] in them
[1:50:08] hallelujah
[1:50:13] and if you notice how that if was united
[1:50:15] with adam
[1:50:16] she become part of him
[1:50:19] come back to tomorrow again
[1:50:21] adam and eve were one
[1:50:24] is that right what made them want
[1:50:26] what made them united because they had
[1:50:29] the union
[1:50:30] it was because when god created adam he
[1:50:33] created adam
[1:50:35] and eve
[1:50:36] as one as one spirit
[1:50:40] so originally they were one
[1:50:42] spirit
[1:50:43] and then god came down and put that
[1:50:46] both of them
[1:50:48] enough in the body of flesh they were
[1:50:50] still together in what body of flesh
[1:50:52] until god came again now separated them
[1:50:56] and even in separating them
[1:50:58] eve had the flesh
[1:51:01] of adam and the bone of adam they shared
[1:51:04] with the bones under
[1:51:06] and the flesh
[1:51:08] so they were
[1:51:09] one
[1:51:11] there was not union because they shared
[1:51:13] the same nature they shared the same
[1:51:15] material
[1:51:17] and we always know that that's a type of
[1:51:18] christ if there ever going to be a union
[1:51:21] between christ and his church
[1:51:23] christ and his church must share the
[1:51:25] material that makes each other
[1:51:28] we must have his spirit we must have his
[1:51:30] word
[1:51:31] we must have his truth we must have
[1:51:33] everything that was in christ
[1:51:35] must be in the bride to bring that
[1:51:38] common
[1:51:39] union
[1:51:43] praise the name of the lord
[1:51:45] i was reading a quote have i've got the
[1:51:47] quotes here but i'm not going to read
[1:51:49] them and what was saying
[1:51:51] uh the love of christ
[1:51:54] makes us one
[1:51:57] if we have the love of god i have the
[1:51:59] love of god
[1:52:00] truly that makes us one
[1:52:04] okay
[1:52:05] and i was applying also that one that is
[1:52:07] agape love but in philly love also
[1:52:11] when a husband and a wife loves each
[1:52:13] other truly
[1:52:15] when
[1:52:16] when a young man and a young woman love
[1:52:18] each other truly
[1:52:21] that makes them one
[1:52:24] i don't believe there should be any
[1:52:26] other circumstance to bring two people
[1:52:29] into marriage
[1:52:31] except laugh
[1:52:35] if it is not under the circumstances of
[1:52:37] love for each other
[1:52:39] that
[1:52:41] marriage should not work
[1:52:45] in marriage there are many challenges
[1:52:50] one of the challenges is that you keep
[1:52:52] on offending each other
[1:52:57] and the only way you can ever continue
[1:52:59] living together
[1:53:01] is in the circumstance of love
[1:53:04] because if you love the person
[1:53:06] you'll bear the person
[1:53:09] love covers a multitude of mistakes
[1:53:13] his only love that can be able to
[1:53:15] flourish in this in those circumstances
[1:53:19] if you did not love that girl if you
[1:53:21] don't love that boy
[1:53:24] maybe you love this money
[1:53:27] maybe you loved her legs
[1:53:29] you married the legs and you took legs
[1:53:31] to your house
[1:53:34] or you took some good hair
[1:53:38] that will not be sustainable at one
[1:53:40] point
[1:53:41] it will not work
[1:53:42] in the circumstances where
[1:53:45] he or she offends you that comes as it
[1:53:47] doesn't do what you like
[1:53:49] it is not going to
[1:53:50] to survive
[1:53:52] but in the circumstance of love
[1:53:55] may the name of all be glorified
[1:53:58] love makes people one
[1:54:00] when there is love whether you are old
[1:54:02] whether you are young
[1:54:04] you still remain loving each other
[1:54:08] love does not fade away
[1:54:11] love is not
[1:54:13] consumed by age
[1:54:16] no
[1:54:17] the more older
[1:54:18] you are living together in a state of
[1:54:21] love the more united you are
[1:54:24] and the more love you have
[1:54:28] but if you looked at wealth
[1:54:30] this man is wealthy
[1:54:34] you forget that the bible says that
[1:54:36] wealth has got wings
[1:54:40] one day it will flap his wings and then
[1:54:42] do what
[1:54:43] fly
[1:54:45] away
[1:54:46] and then marriage has nothing to lean on
[1:54:50] it was hanging on money
[1:54:56] it is a really little challenge
[1:54:58] money
[1:55:03] i find here in america there are a lot
[1:55:05] of jobs
[1:55:07] i see things that i've never seen in my
[1:55:09] country
[1:55:10] we are hiring
[1:55:12] you'll never see that
[1:55:18] recently
[1:55:19] there was an interview for
[1:55:21] they wanted two teachers in a certain
[1:55:23] school
[1:55:25] and the people who turned up qualified
[1:55:28] for that position to teach
[1:55:30] were four 400 people
[1:55:33] and they were picking only
[1:55:34] two
[1:55:39] another place in the in in ghana i was
[1:55:41] seeing it in a in a
[1:55:43] internet
[1:55:44] they wanted some
[1:55:47] some so recruiting some soldiers
[1:55:50] the line was stretched the whole street
[1:55:53] then turns to the next then turn to the
[1:55:55] next
[1:55:56] even those at the behind even they don't
[1:55:58] see what is happening is about three or
[1:56:01] four kilometers away
[1:56:05] is that an unemployment
[1:56:07] you may lose your job
[1:56:08] and getting another one becomes very
[1:56:10] difficult
[1:56:11] maybe the only person who has a job now
[1:56:13] is a wife
[1:56:16] if you need anything your wife
[1:56:20] your wife
[1:56:23] there is a temptation of her reaching
[1:56:24] someone saying
[1:56:26] why don't you be like other men
[1:56:29] go out and look for something
[1:56:33] it's a difficult situation
[1:56:36] so love works there
[1:56:42] a challenge
[1:56:48] love love unites
[1:56:53] now
[1:56:54] let's is something here also here
[1:57:01] now listen so we got to know what unites
[1:57:04] us what unites us with christ what
[1:57:06] brings us together with christ what
[1:57:08] brings that oneness
[1:57:10] we have seen that also love
[1:57:12] love brings
[1:57:14] oneness in the people yes right
[1:57:17] now now don't you see
[1:57:21] on the day of pentecost
[1:57:23] we find the holy spirit the pillar of
[1:57:25] fire
[1:57:26] separating itself and setting upon each
[1:57:29] member of the church
[1:57:32] god putting himself together
[1:57:35] then with that group of people together
[1:57:37] what does it do
[1:57:40] brings back the unified body yes
[1:57:44] of the lord jesus
[1:57:47] when god defied himself a portion of god
[1:57:50] entered in one person the other person
[1:57:52] of god entered another person on the day
[1:57:54] of pentacles because that is exactly
[1:57:56] what took place
[1:57:59] now
[1:58:00] the prophet is telling us now when that
[1:58:02] happened
[1:58:04] that fact of a portion of god coming
[1:58:06] into every one of those people
[1:58:10] unified those people
[1:58:13] first it unified them with god
[1:58:20] blessed be them alone
[1:58:22] they were joined together
[1:58:25] with god
[1:58:27] there was a heavenly wedlock
[1:58:30] between them and god
[1:58:36] join in heavenly wedlock to the eternal
[1:58:39] god
[1:58:41] that fact of god sharing himself in the
[1:58:44] in them at the broader heavenly wedlock
[1:58:47] to the eternal god part of him
[1:58:49] part of god
[1:58:52] oh president god look at the first union
[1:58:55] how did it come
[1:58:57] god created people he created adam and
[1:59:00] eve in the same image in the same
[1:59:02] likeness
[1:59:03] they shared the nature the
[1:59:06] apportion of god was with them
[1:59:08] and now on the day of pentecost god
[1:59:10] comes again
[1:59:12] and a portion of yourself which is the
[1:59:14] holy spirit came upon each one of them
[1:59:18] and the prophet says what happened there
[1:59:20] was a a heavenly
[1:59:22] wedlock
[1:59:24] to eternal god part of him
[1:59:27] part of god
[1:59:29] in the flesh
[1:59:32] in other words in other words they
[1:59:34] became part of god
[1:59:36] now that act of god coming down and
[1:59:39] entering in them and making now this
[1:59:42] heavenly wedlock bringing that union
[1:59:49] is actually that brought the condition
[1:59:51] that we read in the book of acts chapter
[1:59:53] 4
[1:59:55] and verse 32.
[1:59:59] and the multitude of them that believed
[2:00:04] were of one
[2:00:06] heart
[2:00:10] is that correct
[2:00:12] and one word
[2:00:14] so
[2:00:17] why
[2:00:18] because
[2:00:20] a portion of god came upon each one
[2:00:23] of them
[2:00:24] and brought this union
[2:00:26] in the individual with god first
[2:00:31] when that union is there with god for us
[2:00:33] by a portion of god being in each one of
[2:00:37] them
[2:00:38] then
[2:00:40] the union with one another was automatic
[2:00:43] they became of one heart
[2:00:46] and of one soul
[2:00:52] may the name of the arabic graphics
[2:00:56] they became a unified body of the lord
[2:00:58] jesus christ
[2:01:00] because they were brought into that
[2:01:02] condition of one heart and one soul
[2:01:06] now
[2:01:06] then they were one with one another
[2:01:11] hey amen
[2:01:14] now
[2:01:15] now there's a challenge there
[2:01:18] and today in this great separation that
[2:01:20] we are living in
[2:01:22] denominational differences and things
[2:01:25] what a pity
[2:01:27] what are this grace let me not talk
[2:01:28] about illumination
[2:01:30] let me put it this way and today in this
[2:01:32] great separation
[2:01:34] that we have
[2:01:35] in the message believe us
[2:01:39] differences
[2:01:41] and things what a pity
[2:01:45] quota pity
[2:01:52] i'm not criticizing but let me say this
[2:01:56] when i was in new jersey i found
[2:01:58] here you have something you call
[2:02:00] harmony in the desert
[2:02:03] how many have heard of that
[2:02:05] okay
[2:02:07] those are meetings where believers come
[2:02:11] and they are there about i don't know
[2:02:13] much but if i get if i'm wrong
[2:02:15] maybe i didn't get the details but
[2:02:18] i heard that
[2:02:19] believers come together for about one
[2:02:21] week
[2:02:23] and all what they do is singing
[2:02:25] no preaching isn't it
[2:02:29] no preaching
[2:02:31] why no preaching
[2:02:34] because they are fearling if you preach
[2:02:36] you'll differ isn't it
[2:02:38] there'll be differences
[2:02:41] that's why we are saying blah blah blah
[2:02:43] is saying here it's a pity it's a
[2:02:46] disgrace that we can be divided
[2:02:51] as believers
[2:02:54] yeah we got to come together we fear
[2:02:56] each other in such a manner that we
[2:02:57] cannot open the bible and read to you i
[2:02:59] cannot even read the message
[2:03:01] why don't they come and just read the
[2:03:02] message
[2:03:05] read the word only if you are feeling
[2:03:08] that that if somebody preaches there
[2:03:10] will be differences
[2:03:13] that's what we have reached
[2:03:17] it's a pity the division
[2:03:24] may the name of that be gratified
[2:03:26] it is so about so bad it's too bad but
[2:03:28] these people had one heart
[2:03:31] and one soul
[2:03:34] what does it mean
[2:03:36] to me it means what they had
[2:03:39] we may not have
[2:03:42] they had something that united them
[2:03:45] they had something that put them
[2:03:47] together
[2:03:54] the name of the qualifying no look at
[2:03:56] the pentecostals
[2:03:58] pentecostals they are wrong
[2:04:00] now recently
[2:04:02] the government in our country introduced
[2:04:04] was introducing a law
[2:04:06] that you will not be registered a church
[2:04:09] will be registered if the pastor
[2:04:12] does not have the minimum qualification
[2:04:15] of a diploma in theology
[2:04:21] okay
[2:04:23] the believers i don't know any believer
[2:04:25] who has a diploma in theory
[2:04:28] that is preaching
[2:04:29] they don't
[2:04:33] so that means our churches are going to
[2:04:35] be
[2:04:36] illegal
[2:04:39] the same condition was in many
[2:04:40] pentecostal churches
[2:04:42] so what the pensacola churches did they
[2:04:45] all came together small and big church
[2:04:51] and they stormed in the attorney
[2:04:53] general's
[2:04:54] office
[2:04:56] the attorney general is the chief the
[2:04:58] chief justice or something like that
[2:05:02] and they said no we protest against that
[2:05:04] rule
[2:05:07] and they called a press conference
[2:05:11] and they said categorically if you pass
[2:05:14] that law
[2:05:16] we are going to mobilize all the
[2:05:17] christians in this country and they are
[2:05:19] going to vote this government out
[2:05:24] that rules was quietly shelved
[2:05:31] you call the believers to have a common
[2:05:33] thing today
[2:05:36] if they have a common threat may god
[2:05:37] help us that we don't have we don't get
[2:05:39] a common threat but to work together
[2:05:51] it's not something we are proud of
[2:05:53] something we are ashamed of
[2:05:55] the division the references
[2:05:58] we have the same message but you have so
[2:05:59] many differences why is it like that
[2:06:03] now
[2:06:04] i believe
[2:06:09] now let me just
[2:06:10] read this
[2:06:17] let me read this before i comment
[2:06:20] as i'm just about to finish
[2:06:40] i want to do this
[2:06:43] now
[2:06:47] yes disciples had no unity
[2:06:50] disciples had no unity
[2:06:52] they could not understand jesus
[2:06:55] they said ah who can understand these
[2:06:57] things see
[2:06:59] god wasn't in them yet
[2:07:03] amen
[2:07:05] can you believe that
[2:07:06] are you telling me these people moving
[2:07:08] with jesus hearing the word even
[2:07:11] preaching being going around and
[2:07:12] preaching and even healing the sick and
[2:07:14] everything else but here problem is
[2:07:16] saying god had not come in them yet
[2:07:22] and for that matter they had no unity
[2:07:26] about this
[2:07:27] they had no unity
[2:07:31] and that was because they had not yet
[2:07:34] obtained a portion of god in them
[2:07:38] that's why they could not have any unity
[2:07:42] now
[2:07:46] they could not understand jesus they
[2:07:47] said ah who can
[2:07:49] god wasn't to them they were just
[2:07:51] associated in fellowship
[2:07:57] could we be having association in
[2:07:59] fellowship
[2:08:01] but not a union
[2:08:05] are we only having an association of
[2:08:08] fellowship of believers
[2:08:10] all over the country all over the world
[2:08:13] but we don't have
[2:08:15] fellows we don't have
[2:08:17] the union
[2:08:20] they're walking with jesus they are
[2:08:22] preaching with jesus they are sleeping
[2:08:23] with jesus they are going around
[2:08:24] everything here and here we are told
[2:08:26] they were on having a
[2:08:28] a union of fellowship
[2:08:30] association of fellowship as was yet
[2:08:32] they were only associated in fellowship
[2:08:35] but not you united
[2:08:37] they were not one
[2:08:40] they just associated with him
[2:08:46] may god help us
[2:08:48] that it will be not yet just having
[2:08:50] associations and not union
[2:08:59] they were just as written in fellowship
[2:09:00] they just associated with him that many
[2:09:03] are good man today
[2:09:06] they didn't they didn't drink
[2:09:09] they didn't lie
[2:09:10] they didn't steal
[2:09:12] nothing
[2:09:13] but they didn't have that oneness of god
[2:09:19] didn't have it
[2:09:21] it wasn't there
[2:09:25] there were a bunch of believers they
[2:09:27] were together associated we are the
[2:09:29] japanese of christ they were persecuted
[2:09:31] executed together they were criticized
[2:09:33] together they were hated together they
[2:09:35] were they they traveled together they
[2:09:38] went everywhere together they stand
[2:09:39] together but they were not united
[2:09:44] they had only a kind of associated
[2:09:47] fellowship
[2:09:56] the union was not there
[2:10:01] okay
[2:10:03] they didn't do it they didn't lie they
[2:10:04] didn't steal
[2:10:06] they didn't have the oneness of god
[2:10:07] there wasn't one with god yet
[2:10:12] see they couldn't be
[2:10:14] or they done mila cost they cast up
[2:10:16] devils
[2:10:17] that's the earrings
[2:10:22] they didn't know that kind of things
[2:10:29] now then came pentecost
[2:10:33] god made them one again
[2:10:38] glory be to god
[2:10:40] when did they become one on the new
[2:10:43] pentecost why because a portion of god
[2:10:46] came upon each one of them
[2:10:49] and that made them one
[2:10:51] and made them united oh my then they
[2:10:54] they had oneness with god
[2:10:56] oneness of god what one was with god
[2:10:59] with them came on the day of pentacles
[2:11:02] god was in them
[2:11:08] now act if you are putting down acts 4
[2:11:10] 32 the bible says they were with one
[2:11:12] heart one soul and one might oh brother
[2:11:15] why they had become restored back to
[2:11:18] that origin again
[2:11:20] that one of adam
[2:11:22] and if
[2:11:25] that union
[2:11:29] that is the only condition
[2:11:32] that
[2:11:33] we
[2:11:34] can be
[2:11:35] one
[2:11:37] god first
[2:11:39] and then with one another amen
[2:11:44] in the name of the holy father
[2:11:46] you've got to be attached with god
[2:11:48] connected with god as an individual
[2:11:51] i am connected with god you are
[2:11:53] connected with god certain is connected
[2:11:55] with god and after we are connected with
[2:11:57] god individually then we are connected
[2:12:00] with each other
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:04] how is it going to happen let us have
[2:12:06] the portion of god in our lives
[2:12:08] thank you jesus
[2:12:10] there's that portion of the holy ghost
[2:12:12] come in within us
[2:12:13] and then we are made one now
[2:12:17] i want you to
[2:12:18] just give a little proof here a little
[2:12:21] bit and then i close now number one
[2:12:24] to see how that brought that
[2:12:27] union
[2:12:48] forgive me for my slowness
[2:12:51] power had never seen peter
[2:12:58] are you following
[2:12:59] me
[2:13:00] paul had never seen who peter
[2:13:03] but the same holy ghost
[2:13:05] in that same union
[2:13:09] in that same union glory
[2:13:11] caused him to say the same thing
[2:13:15] have you received the holy ghost since
[2:13:17] you believed
[2:13:18] he said we don't know whether there be
[2:13:20] he said how was you baptized he said
[2:13:22] unto john said you have to be baptized
[2:13:24] over again in the name of jesus christ
[2:13:26] and they received the holy ghost what
[2:13:28] was it the union
[2:13:32] saying the same thing
[2:13:35] god says
[2:13:36] and that's the confession confess means
[2:13:38] to say the same thing and he's the high
[2:13:40] priest over
[2:13:42] confession that's right there you are
[2:13:45] peter
[2:13:46] and paul
[2:13:47] let me just read another
[2:13:49] another quote here that will expound
[2:13:51] that one
[2:13:57] maybe much
[2:14:00] more
[2:14:08] praise be to god union with
[2:14:10] god and with one another
[2:14:14] i will become united with one another
[2:14:51] but when paul
[2:14:53] that is prophetic sea that received the
[2:14:55] holy ghost
[2:14:56] i received the holy spirit when ananias
[2:14:58] baptized him
[2:15:00] and he went into arabia and studied for
[2:15:03] three years
[2:15:04] come back
[2:15:06] never consulted the church about
[2:15:07] anything for 14 years
[2:15:11] and when you come and met peter the head
[2:15:14] of the church at jerusalem
[2:15:16] they were eye to eye in doctrine
[2:15:20] why can't we be eye to eye in doctrine
[2:15:23] in this message
[2:15:24] what's wrong what's the problem
[2:15:28] there's a problem
[2:15:30] there are so many teachings and
[2:15:32] doctrines and people and whatever
[2:15:37] some people come they tell you we
[2:15:38] already raptured
[2:15:42] then you ask them what are you doing
[2:15:43] here
[2:15:47] when you are eating they are also eating
[2:15:49] how can you have the rapture and you are
[2:15:51] still eating just confusion
[2:15:55] some rise up they say we are the ones
[2:15:58] that i'm going to to preach the gospel
[2:15:59] in jerusalem
[2:16:02] i'm both elijah and
[2:16:05] and moses
[2:16:07] all of them in me
[2:16:08] then you have a following
[2:16:16] doctrine and doctrine and teachings and
[2:16:19] everything else in this message
[2:16:23] as long as we have only
[2:16:26] a fellowship
[2:16:28] just something of fellowship
[2:16:30] but not union
[2:16:34] but the time has come
[2:16:36] when we got to have that union
[2:16:39] and he went to libya and study for three
[2:16:41] years come back and never consulted the
[2:16:42] church about anything for 14 years and
[2:16:44] when he come and met peter the head of
[2:16:46] the church at jerusalem they were eye to
[2:16:49] eye in doctrine
[2:16:51] why
[2:16:52] why
[2:16:53] the same holy spirit we are peter
[2:16:55] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:16:58] paul did the same without anybody
[2:16:59] telling him
[2:17:02] where peter taught the baptism of the
[2:17:04] holy ghost and sanctification and so
[2:17:05] forth power did the same thing without
[2:17:07] consorting the child because it was the
[2:17:09] same guide
[2:17:11] [Music]
[2:17:12] this is the hour when we have got to
[2:17:14] have the same guide this is when you
[2:17:17] have got to have the same holy ghost
[2:17:19] this is how we are going to have the
[2:17:20] same uniting power
[2:17:22] in each one of us
[2:17:24] that brings a union that's the
[2:17:26] real and when we have that union with
[2:17:29] god then we have a union with one
[2:17:31] another
[2:17:33] and we teach the same doctrine
[2:17:35] i'm saying this morning it is possible
[2:17:38] to have the same doctrines
[2:17:44] you supposed to have no differences
[2:17:49] now
[2:17:51] let me cut short my message and then
[2:17:54] give this quote and then
[2:17:56] we close
[2:17:59] will it ever happen
[2:18:02] shall we live with this confusion
[2:18:06] let me first of all say something here
[2:18:09] i don't believe
[2:18:11] we shall be ruptured
[2:18:13] in this confusion
[2:18:21] no
[2:18:22] we cannot disrupt
[2:18:24] all together the way we are
[2:18:26] no
[2:18:27] god cannot take a church called bright
[2:18:29] that cannot be called upright
[2:18:31] on confusion
[2:18:33] division
[2:18:35] they are not in one heart they don't
[2:18:36] have one mind
[2:18:37] i believe the church that will be taken
[2:18:40] for the rapture will have the same union
[2:18:44] with god
[2:18:45] as adam and eve
[2:18:48] like it was there on the day on
[2:18:50] pentecost
[2:18:51] and they shall have a union
[2:18:54] with one
[2:18:55] another
[2:18:57] no differences in doctrines no
[2:18:59] difference in teachings
[2:19:00] just the same
[2:19:02] so what do you mean now what about all
[2:19:04] these people in the message that i share
[2:19:05] no different
[2:19:07] i believe
[2:19:11] either before the rapture comes god will
[2:19:14] change them
[2:19:19] or
[2:19:21] they will not be in rupture
[2:19:24] that's the only hope two things before
[2:19:26] that time comes contagious them
[2:19:31] if not that men are being left here with
[2:19:34] their own doctrines and teachings around
[2:19:36] here
[2:19:37] but the church that is going
[2:19:40] will be united
[2:19:42] we'll have a union
[2:19:43] why do i say that
[2:19:45] listen
[2:19:50] i'm trying to shorten it in the
[2:19:52] headstone
[2:19:55] and she'll be the supercharged
[2:19:58] a super race
[2:20:00] as she nears him
[2:20:02] there in the bride will be so much like
[2:20:05] him
[2:20:07] that he will even be in his very image
[2:20:12] go back to genesis
[2:20:14] adam and eve created in his
[2:20:17] image
[2:20:19] they shall be in his very image
[2:20:23] this is in order to be united with him
[2:20:28] the bride that is
[2:20:29] now
[2:20:30] shall be united with him
[2:20:34] this is the ultimate of this message
[2:20:36] the ultimate of this message is a church
[2:20:40] a people
[2:20:41] that are united
[2:20:43] with christ
[2:20:45] there is a portion of my messenger have
[2:20:47] left out about the word uniting not just
[2:20:49] the holy ghost that holy ghost after the
[2:20:52] holy ghost comes guides us to the whole
[2:20:54] truth
[2:20:56] and the holocaust was to do nothing else
[2:20:58] but to guide a child to the whole truth
[2:21:02] not some truth
[2:21:04] and that's what the holy ghost did to
[2:21:05] them
[2:21:06] and that brings them into that one
[2:21:09] unity
[2:21:15] okay
[2:21:19] as far as as she nears him there i there
[2:21:22] in the bride will be so much like him
[2:21:25] that they will
[2:21:27] even be in his very image this is in
[2:21:29] order to be united
[2:21:31] with him
[2:21:33] they
[2:21:34] will be
[2:21:36] one
[2:21:38] that is the word of god
[2:21:41] there will be a very manifestation of
[2:21:43] the word of the living god
[2:21:46] amen
[2:21:49] okay another one here
[2:21:52] notice the harmony of the father and the
[2:21:54] son jesus never did anything until it
[2:21:56] was first showed him by the father
[2:21:59] john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist
[2:22:03] between the groom
[2:22:06] and his bride
[2:22:08] remember i started the harmony
[2:22:11] between the husband and
[2:22:12] the wife
[2:22:14] which is a shadow of this harmony
[2:22:17] with goddess in church
[2:22:19] he shows us his world
[2:22:21] of life she receives it she never doubts
[2:22:23] it therefore nothing can harm her
[2:22:26] not even death for if the seed be
[2:22:29] planted the word the water will raise it
[2:22:31] up again
[2:22:38] amen
[2:22:40] god is walking
[2:22:43] in a small bride towards that
[2:22:47] she will be that way
[2:22:49] the same condition like adam and eve
[2:22:52] god having a
[2:22:54] awareness
[2:22:55] with his family
[2:22:57] that is the ultimate of this message ms
[2:23:00] god bless you very much
[2:23:02] amen
[2:23:05] [Applause]
[2:23:13] let's pray
[2:23:15] heavenly father
[2:23:18] we look at your world and look at the
[2:23:20] conditions that we are living in
[2:23:24] and we find very embarrassing situations
[2:23:28] even in our people
[2:23:30] called by your name
[2:23:33] the people that have left the
[2:23:34] denominations and they have come to the
[2:23:36] message
[2:23:38] and the condition of divisions and
[2:23:40] separations that are there lord
[2:23:45] but lord we know
[2:23:47] from your world
[2:23:49] that there will be a bride
[2:23:52] that is very very united with you
[2:23:55] and united with one another
[2:23:58] that is our hope
[2:24:01] that's what we know it shall be
[2:24:04] and we believe it lord it shall be that
[2:24:06] way
[2:24:07] help us father
[2:24:10] that you may allow you to work
[2:24:12] us into that condition
[2:24:15] into that state
[2:24:17] continue to work in your church lord and
[2:24:19] bless your people
[2:24:21] have your father with us and bless us
[2:24:23] lord in every way
[2:24:25] commit ourselves to you
[2:24:27] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[2:24:30] amen amen
[2:24:32] may god bless you
[2:24:34] if i don't meet you again
[2:24:37] before i go back home
[2:24:40] i ask you to send me your greetings
[2:24:43] yes
[2:24:45] god bless you
[2:24:46] amen
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:25:09] we appreciate that
[2:25:10] [Music]
[2:25:13] we appreciate that
[2:25:14] praise the lord
[2:25:17] amen
[2:25:19] i know when the preacher started with
[2:25:20] that
[2:25:22] marriage subject is just flamed the
[2:25:23] building i could feel the heat coming
[2:25:25] from behind me
[2:25:26] all the young people were connected to
[2:25:28] death
[2:25:29] that's wonderful
[2:25:31] praise the lord
[2:25:32] amen
[2:25:34] you know let me say this
[2:25:36] [Music]
[2:25:38] you know this promise
[2:25:40] that jesus made
[2:25:43] in john chapter 17.
[2:25:47] he says father
[2:25:49] make them one
[2:25:52] there will not be a man
[2:25:55] that would be able to achieve that
[2:25:59] just like the preacher said
[2:26:01] it would have to be god
[2:26:03] that we achieve it
[2:26:04] and because god made a promise
[2:26:08] no matter what we are seeing with our
[2:26:10] natural eyes
[2:26:12] no matter what
[2:26:14] the doctrine differences might be
[2:26:17] let's keep our eyes on christ
[2:26:20] you know one of the problem is that uh
[2:26:23] you know i i can go through a lot of
[2:26:25] things this morning but i think the
[2:26:26] message has already been preached
[2:26:28] i would not want to do a tag team this
[2:26:30] morning and come behind it
[2:26:33] but i believe
[2:26:36] we have we have got stuck
[2:26:38] in different areas
[2:26:41] it's just like
[2:26:43] eleazar going out to get
[2:26:46] rebecca as a bride she never knew isaac
[2:26:50] she never met isaac in her life
[2:26:53] all she knew about isaac was what
[2:26:55] eleazar told her
[2:26:58] but you see as the chair was getting
[2:27:00] closer
[2:27:02] and she could see a man in the field
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:07] because every step of the way she will
[2:27:10] ask eliza where are we
[2:27:12] he will say we are in the efficient
[2:27:14] church age
[2:27:16] we are in the seminar church age in the
[2:27:18] philadelphia church age
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:23] as it got to the peak of loud nature
[2:27:26] and she could see a man in the field
[2:27:31] even though she have not seen his face
[2:27:34] but because of so much of what eliezer
[2:27:39] has told her
[2:27:41] about
[2:27:43] isaac
[2:27:47] the moment that eleazar identified
[2:27:50] that that was isaac
[2:27:53] rebecca's attention left eleazar
[2:27:58] she loved this man for the way he wrote
[2:28:00] the chara
[2:28:02] she loved him for all the story that he
[2:28:04] told
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:07] but
[2:28:09] when eleeza identified
[2:28:12] isaac
[2:28:14] just like john saying behold the lamb of
[2:28:16] god
[2:28:17] that takes away the sin of the word
[2:28:20] there were two disciples
[2:28:22] of john the baptist that left the
[2:28:24] revival that night and followed jesus
[2:28:27] because they got the revelation of what
[2:28:29] the message was
[2:28:31] the message was not the messenger
[2:28:34] the message was about the lamb of god
[2:28:36] that took away the sin of the world
[2:28:45] and just like i said the other day
[2:28:48] there are things that we grow out of
[2:28:51] the bride is surely going to grow out of
[2:28:54] this
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:57] there are some childhood conditions when
[2:28:59] i was a child
[2:29:00] i talked like a child
[2:29:02] i walked like a child i thought like a
[2:29:05] child
[2:29:07] science proved to us that there are
[2:29:09] medical conditions that we can grow out
[2:29:11] of
[2:29:12] this word of god proved to us that they
[2:29:14] are fbi condition
[2:29:16] we will grow out of
[2:29:18] as we eat the word and we fought in love
[2:29:21] with jesus christ and we just love him
[2:29:23] and we just love him pretty soon we will
[2:29:26] rise above all of our differences
[2:29:29] let me ask you a question
[2:29:32] have you ever been so mad so indifferent
[2:29:35] with somebody
[2:29:37] and pretty soon you hear that person has
[2:29:39] lost someone close to them
[2:29:43] and you forget the indifference oh my
[2:29:45] goodness really
[2:29:47] really
[2:29:48] oh man she was such a nice woman all
[2:29:52] mine
[2:29:54] and that's just how it's going to be one
[2:29:56] of these days
[2:29:57] [Music]
[2:30:00] everything we think i have a stain i
[2:30:02] have a stain this is what i stand for
[2:30:04] those things does not matter to god
[2:30:09] they don't matter to god
[2:30:14] i believe that as this
[2:30:16] bride just fall in love with jesus
[2:30:20] and she just love the word
[2:30:23] and doing her best
[2:30:25] to represent him in this life
[2:30:29] they are human tendencies we would grow
[2:30:32] out of
[2:30:33] natural tendencies we would grow out of
[2:30:37] and one of these days we'll realize
[2:30:40] the only thing that mattered
[2:30:43] was the love that he had for us
[2:30:46] and have affected us with that love
[2:30:50] that
[2:30:50] we on water humans
[2:30:53] can be able to love him the same
[2:30:56] let's just worship him a little bit
[2:30:58] fine
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:12] one
[2:31:21] [Music]
[2:31:25] by the world
[2:31:34] [Music]
[2:31:36] [Applause]
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:38] make us want
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:54] fine
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:32:07] that you said
[2:32:10] [Music]
[2:32:18] now i wanted to say this thing
[2:32:20] just before we prayed and be dismissed
