========================================

foreign [Music] nothing and as sincerely in My Heart Lord I know that something's fixing to take place I cannot strictly identify it I'm afraid to say anything Lauren thou Norse the heart of your servants and how many times down to the age when you set things people fail to get a man is constantly praising God for what he did and seeing what great things he's going to do but ignoring what he's doing so has it been through the age why did the Roman Church fail to see Saint Patrick as God's Prophet why did they kill Joan of Arc when she was a a prophetess burn her as a witch father it's always past you hide it from the eyes of the wise and prove it no wonder you said to them priest you garnished the tombs of their prophets and you're the one who put them in there after they're gone they see their mistake they always persecute you Lord in whatever form you come in I pray tonight God just one more time tomorrow we're scheduled to be to go to Tucson other parts of the world other cities we must preach in but dear God there might be strangers here tonight that never has they've heard words preached but never seen it made manifest as I asked you at the beginning when those disciples the opius and his friend coming from Emmaus was walking along the road and you stepped out of the Bush and began to talk to him as the resurrection preach to them well I said fool slow of heart don't you know that Christ should suffer these things then enter into his glory but still they never recognized it all day long they walked with you and still didn't know you but one night night come they constrained you to come in when they went into the little Inn and closed the doors then you did something just the way you did it before your crucifixion and they recognized that it was the Risen Christ in a few moments is behind the curtains and gone quickly they run and told the disciples the Lord is risen indeed father God I believe that you're still alive I know you are and you've proved it to us so many times could you just do it once more for us Lord if we found Grace in your sight let it happen once more I am your servant these are your servants in your lord all that I've said wouldn't Mount to just one word from you would be more and I've said in these five nights or five messages it would be more just one word from you won't you speak Lord that the people might know that I've told him the truth granted God I asked it in Jesus name this once more amen now I don't know you I know some people I know this boy's sitting here an old bill Dallas sitting right there I wanna here's brother Blair Rodney Cox it's hard to see out there on this side right to present time I can't see nobody actually that I know now how many in here that knows that I am a stranger to you raise up your hands knows that I know nothing about you raise up your hands on both sides how many in here that has something wrong or something that you know that I know nothing about would you raise up your hands now it would be totally absolutely totally impossible for me to know anything about you otherwise then have to come from some revelation of spirit and it being I've told you all these nights and tonight that he is not dead he's here and promised to do the same thing and promise that there would come a time in the last days according to Malachi 4. and according to Saint Luke that he would appear again in human form among his people and do the same things and reveal the same thing the same Messiah sign how many knows that you Bible readers knows that's the truth Say Amen let's all be Bible readers now I know it's foreign to the people today but still it's the truth that's the reason they didn't know Jesus of Nazareth they know their Church Creeds but they didn't know him but he come just the way the Bible said not a theologian not a priest he come as a prophet and his own received him not if God will keep his word if I happen to it happens to follow someone that I know then I'll get someone else see I want somebody and I don't know and I want you to pray now look there's a little woman one time had an infirmity she's spent her money for the doctors they could do her no good and she said within her heart if I can touch that man's garments I'll be made well you remember the story and so all of them tried to get her to stay back but she pressed through until she touched His Garment went back and sat down now listen close and then when he did that when she did that Jesus turned around and said who touched me why Peter the Apostle rebuked him he might have said something Lord don't say a thing like that the people believe there's something wrong with you because when you ask them to eat your flesh and drink your blood they already think there's something wrong and you say who touched me well the whole crowds are touching you he said yes but I perceive that virtue went out of me that was a different kind of touch and anybody knows that virtue is strength I got weak virtue left me and he looked around on the audience until he found the little woman and told her about her blood issue and she felt in her body that that body who she had stopped is that right and he said thy faith has saved thee now the Greek word there is Sozo which absolutely means say physically or spiritual yes to say you say he is he's your savior now if that was him yesterday and the way he acted to prove that he was among the people the Messiah promised and that's where he identified himself in promise for the Bible he'd do the same thing now wouldn't he wouldn't he have to do the same thing you say did he say it not Healing The Sick yeah the Hebrews the Bible had just read from said that Jesus Christ now is our high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities how many knows that's true the Bible said that he's a high priest now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities then if he's the same high priest that he was then how would he act now it had to act the same way you did then if he's the same high priest now you might I'm not your high priest you might touch me and just be like touching your husband or your brother or what more a man but you let your faith touch him Watch What Happens amen now if I be God's servant and I've told you the truth God will vindicate that to be the truth and that would prove that Jesus Christ is the living tonight standing here is that right now you have faith this one-sided time one side you have faith out there I better stay at the microphone here because he can't hear me somebody just look up to God and say God that man don't know me he knows nothing about me I'm a perfect stranger to him but let my faith touch you Lord and you know what's the matter with me Lord you know all about me you know who I am the same as you know who Peter was same as you know Nathaniel as you know what was wrong with the woman with the blood issue and this man tells me that you're the same yesterday and forever then Lord let my faith touch you and if he'll do that and then fallibly prove himself here how many of you will believe him with all your heart if you'll do it at least one or two or three people for a witness God bless you now father God this is totally out of the hands of any man it'd have to be Supernatural phenomenal so I pray that you'll help me now Lord I'm in your hands do with me as you see fit in Jesus name amen uh don't be nervous just humbly reverely say Lord I'll serve you and that'll be a truth that if I can touch your garment then you speak back through that man that will prove to me that what he said is the truth is that right how many ever seen a picture of that line it's all over the country everywhere science is targets examine it never worked now he's right here now same one who said about marriage and divorce same was on the mountainous shut the heels back then same one it's down here at the river in 33. the same yesterday today and forever is the same now there's a woman and she recognizes now that Something's Happened that light's hanging right over she's setting right ears green sweater on or something I don't know the woman I suppose we are strangers to one another that is right do you believe that God your your need of something and you believe that God can reveal to me what your trouble is and if he does then you know it'll have to be a supernatural power because I don't know you 'll have to come through Supernatural depends on what you think it is you can take your side with the priest part of the devil or you take the side of the believer call it God every which you believe that's where reward will come from if God will reveal to me your trouble will you accept him as your your atonement for that trouble I don't know what the trouble is but I know and you know that something's going on I'll just let me tell you how you're feeling and you know a real warm sweet comfortable feeling I'm looking right straight at it it's that line amber light hanging from the woman and the lady is suffering with a trouble in her stomach it's a kind of a gross like in her stomach she's not from here no you're from away from here aren't you that's right you're from Wisconsin is that right sure now you are healed praise the Lord your faith has made you whole now tell me who the woman touched I'm 25 yards from she touched Jesus Christ the high priest you believe that I'm looking at a woman that I talked to this woman I'm looking right at her because she's praying so hard for a man she told me she had a man she never told me nothing about it but her name is Mrs Waldorf she comes from Phoenix she was raised from the dead or a doctor come at the X-rays and showed cancer in the heart she died in the
