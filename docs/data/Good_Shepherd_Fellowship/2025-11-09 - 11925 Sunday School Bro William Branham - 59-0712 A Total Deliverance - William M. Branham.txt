========================================

[music] morning. I was sitting back there with brother Egan and I heard brother Neville was saying something there looking towards me and I said to brother Egan, "Is he calling me?" And he said, "He is." And then here I'm up here to say something this morning. I was thinking when I was the fan there where there draws a voice just seems to pull it right out when you're speaking. It seems that the fan takes a voice right away. I was hearing some testimony when I was in there to pray for the woman on the phone and the one who got the message forgot to put the city of the place where to call from Dr. Marson's wife and I just tell you what I done for your all's prayer and mine. I laid hands on the phone and pointed to the number wherever it was and asked the Holy Spirit to go to the woman. But I think you hear that just the same as it would be if we were and I just laid it down. And it might be that that's the way the Lord wanted it. See, it might be it would be better like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then I heard the testimonies while I was in there. Uh someone saying that sister Rook had I believe Brother Neville said that she'd had a a mental collapse like &gt;&gt; let's hold on to God for that. &gt;&gt; Just remembering this one thing. God knows his own. &gt;&gt; He knows all about them. &gt;&gt; Can you hear all right in the back? If you can't, there's some empty seats up here. You can change if you wish to. And let's see. Is this the main mic? This over here is the main mic. Okay, we'll see if we can get that just a teeny bit closer. How about right around here, Jean? That'll be just fine. And sometimes I get just a little horse. I've been preaching quite Is that better? Can you hear that better? And uh we certainly remember these in prayer. And we want to report a glorious meeting &gt;&gt; uh from down in um uh am I looking at Sister Rook? &gt;&gt; I thought I looked at a lady back here that looked like her. I thought surely I'm not talking double here. I looked at someone look like her towards the back. Um she's in the St. Edwards Hospital and uh so uh at Cleveland, Tennessee and also in California, we had a glorious meeting. The Lord blessed greatly and many things that he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're happy for that. happy we can come back to our own company reporting the goodness and the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way they did in the Bible. I was appreciating brother Neville or brother Beer's prayer how he prayed for the people and and asking for help and mercy. And if we'll just look along, you always everything it goes on, you'll find there's something real genuine about it. And then when brother Neville come and brought these deacons and so forth up here to the platform to to pronounce the blessings of God upon the the church offering. I heard him speaking in his prayer to God about those mans how that they prayed for one another. And that does me good to hear a pastor that can pray over his deacons and the deacons pray back for the pastor. When you see a church going into cooperation like that, well, something's fixing to move. &gt;&gt; That's the way the church has to be in order. And it gave me just an idea for a text. I was going to speak on the blessing at Kadesh and the refusal I'll be hearing of the report of the spies. But then I changed my mind to something else then. And now concerning healing, I got just a little testimony that I'd like to give. I was a hopes I'd see my boy Billy back there, but he's got it in his pocket. And Billy's getting to be better in the meetings than what he used to be. Was nervous, upset, and he kind of tell the people, "Oh, go sit down. Go sit down." So, I I'll give you a prayer card. But I've noticed recently there's get to be people in the meeting that he just feels so sorry for. If he ain't got no prayer cards left, then he'll put him in a room so I can go pray for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And such a thing happened at Chicago the last time. And I'd like to read that letter if if he does come in. I never got to see him. He didn't know I was coming this morning over here. And uh and want want the letter, but I just thought of it when I thought of so much sickness. And here's the way it is. It's a certified letter that I was reading in the paper. I never was told that where the papers was criticizing or Roberts for praying for a woman who had diabetes and died. And I not I as an American I I like to listen to the laws and and the man who's in authority, but I think that's not just. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder if they'd be willing to put in the paper all that or Robert had prayed for and got healed that the doctors turned down. I wonder just swap it right back around once. See, &gt;&gt; they wouldn't do that. And then I think maybe that the devil has just muddled them up so that and God permitting it that the day of the judgment they'll have to answer for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know of thousands of people that Or Roberts has prayed for that's been dying and they're well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, you see, they they are unfair about it. They'll deliver their side, the critical side, but won't deliver the other side. Now, the paper is supposed to keep the public uh up to date on events that happens. Then I think if human beings are concerned with one another, if somebody gets healed, really healed, every paper in the United States ought to pack the article of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you can't harm to do it. No, you take something like that there, they'll snigger and laugh at it and turn it back. But if there's anything to criticize, it just goes to show that this nation is ready for judgment. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And there's got to be judgment and there's no way to escape it and they're only heaping fire upon their heads and so forth. and such a a disunified to the principles. Uh a paper its principles is to to inform the public of anything good or bad that's happening. &gt;&gt; But they're away from their principles. And when they're keep away from their principles, then they they will not serve their purpose well. And that's the same way it is with the church. When the church is away from its principles, it can never serve the saints well. We've got to stay together. Got to be unified. We got to be one heart and one accord or we'll never serve God or the people. Unless we're one heart and one accord to stand by the principles of the Bible &gt;&gt; and the things that God has said that's right. We must always stand by them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Billy stuck into the room at Chicago. Someone come to him, a woman with her husband with cancer on the lungs dying and his wife was a polio victim in a wheelchair and her trying to take care of a man that could hardly stand up with cancer on his lungs. And Billy said to him, he said, "I I'm sorry, sir, that I'd gladly give you a prayer card. And he said, "But I I haven't got another one left." And he said, "Well, all right, Sunny." He said, "That's all right that we tried to get you, but so unhandy for us." Billy said, "Tell you what you do." He said, "I'm going to get Dad and I'm going to bring him in and I'll take him out." and said, "When I do, as soon as you hear his message," said, "then you get your h your wife and you and get into a little room there where I pass through and I'll have him pray for you." Oh, he said, "That's loyal, son. That's good enough." See, there's a there's an attitude. See, good enough. That's fine. And that night, Billy when he went back there still against what he had said that he had his brother-in-law there who was bleeding with hemorrhages from the lungs and his sister-in-law there who was bleeding from the stomach with ulcers also that they'd come in with them kind of on the side of helping them get in. You have to watch the whole room full. But going through and praying for them, we get a letter back through the mail. That that man has perfectly healed of that cancer of his lungs. &gt;&gt; The woman, the wife in the wheelchair is up going around just normally she ever was. &gt;&gt; The man with the hemorrhages of the of the lungs from tuber is completely well and his wife is well of the ulcers. Four of them healed straight. &gt;&gt; I wonder if the newspapers WOULD BE WILLING TO PRINT THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; OH, but God still is God. &gt;&gt; He just does things in his own way, you know, and &gt;&gt; he's so good. We're so happy to know that he is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We was talking the other morning about a little preacher that we know that used to go around pray for the sick and everything and he went and prayed for a person in the hospital in Louisville and a two burglar case, a lady dying. The little fella said, "Well, there's no need God ain't ain't no God and keep his word." But I just like like the Bible said, "If he don't keep his word, he's not God. It's just a book." Now, that would seem like that unless you know God. That's part of the scriptures, but it's not all of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; It's up on the basis of the faith of the individual. See, &gt;&gt; and I told my wife, I said, &gt;&gt; there's been so many things happened that I just know that there is I don't know what's going to happen to me at the end. I may go the same way. If God ever moves his hand of mercy from me, I'll go the same way. But as long as he'll keep his hand of mercy and guidance upon me, I'll go on. &gt;&gt; But I asked media, I said, "Who was it in the room that morning at the vision of me seeing my little girl Sharon?" By the way, the other day I like to fainted. I sitting on the street and you know my story, the vision of her at you and I look coming by my side and there come a young girl down the street. You're in Jeffersonville. was just exactly like that vision. I just had to grasp my hands together. Looks so much like that vision of my little Sharon. She's a young woman then. And after that vision that morning when and Gloria I hope was telling me had her arm around my shoulder saying, "Don't worry about us, Bill. We're better off. I just trying to commit suicide." And she said, "Don't worry. Promise me you won't anymore. And I said, "I can't promise it a hope because I I I'm I'm weary. I can't help it." And I come out of the vision standing in the dark room and not A VISION, NOT IMAGINATION, BUT HER ARM WAS still around me. Amen. And she was patting me. I thought, "Wait a minute. This is not I didn't know what to call it in them days, a vision." I called it a trance. I said, "This is her hand still there." I said, "Are you here, Hope?" She said, "Bill promised me that you won't worry anymore about me and Sharon because I was at the end of the road. I was ready to commit suicide." I said, "I promise you." And she hugged me and patted me with her hand. Amen. And then I I said, "Hope, where are you?" I got felt up and got a hold of the little chain on the light and pulled it. I went around, searched through every chair to see if she was sitting there. He's God. He's just as much God today as he was on Mount Transfiguration when Moses and Elijah appeared. He's still God. &gt;&gt; We may go through lots of troubles and trials. Just remember, there's someone who knows, lights the way, makes it real. &gt;&gt; I do not know what's behind the curtain, but I know one thing. I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling &gt;&gt; every day trying to live for that great event that will take place someday when I shall see him face to face &gt;&gt; AND TELL THE STORY SAVED BY grace &gt;&gt; that's the day I live for &gt;&gt; leaving those things behind which are I want to press on just keep going I want this tabernacle Now that you're on your feet, &gt;&gt; I want you to keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, cling together. &gt;&gt; Be as clanish as you can be, but always with an arm out to reach and get someone else to bring them in. &gt;&gt; But in this faith that we're now preaching and earnestly contending for, DON'T YOU MOVE ONE inch from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. or if you believe me to be his servant. This is the program of God. &gt;&gt; It'll never be in the majority. It'll always be in the minority. Always has and always will be. &gt;&gt; But remember, it is written, "Fear not, little flock. It's your father's goodwill to give to you the kingdom." Now there is a group of offices of our church deacons, trustee, Sunday school superintendent, pastors as our churches set in order. And you the people elected these officers and this pastor I'm just gentle overseer see that goes on right and to give advice and so forth. You are the one who elects your pastor. You elect your trustees. You elect your deacons. You elect every office there is in this church. You the people. And it's your duty to stand by those man. See, for they'll make mistakes. They're mortal. They're just man. And they'll make mistakes. But if the president of the United States makes a mistake, do we throw him out as president? we forget about it and move on. That's the way we want to do our church. Now, I was listening to him pray a few minutes ago for those deacons and to hear back there a testimony at the door from the trustees how that with one accord you all are. Now stay that way. Now you members stand by these trustees, deacons, and pastor. And remember when you get this together, remember that it's the devil's business to see that that's broke up. &gt;&gt; Now, it's always has been and it always will be, but you stand by your officers. That was a talk that I was going to make. And then I have here also some something for the bulletin board this morning about the meeting of the boards and their authority. And it'll be on the bulletin board. And I got a copy for brother Robersonson who is the chairman of the de of the trustees. And then I got a copy for brother Collins I think who acts as the chairman of the deacon board. And now all these offices are set according to the scripture and they must have the scriptural rules of what they must do. Therefore, the trustees has an office of their own and the deacons has an office of their own. The Sunday school superintendent has an office of his own. And the pastor is the head of the flock. Now, each one of these has things in common. And I think that your meeting should not be together, but it should be as each office because the deacons has nothing to say to the trustees unless they got some business to present to them. And vice versa, the trustees is over the finance and things of the building. They have nothing but the deacons. The deacons are the policeman of the church and the assistance to the pastor and the trustees is the holding of all the property. The trustees has nothing to do with the spiritual end of it. and the deacon has nothing to do with the financial end of it. Therefore, it must be and the Sunday school superintendent is over his Sunday school. So, I've got it all wrote typed out to be on the bulletin board. And then we are also going to get in a frame the doctrine that the church stands for and have it framed in here in the church. What we stand for, the the principles, the doctrine of the church. Now to be a church, we got to have a doctrine. We don't draw down any stakes and say we just go this far. We go out just as far with fellowship with everybody that God will let us go in his scriptures with the people. Now stick together, be of one accord, one heart, and move on for God. &gt;&gt; That's the way God wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Now let us pray and then open the word. Oh precious Lord, we are now about to approach the divine word or the reading of this word. May your Holy Spirit interpret to us that which we have need of. &gt;&gt; And let us speak, Lord, and act and live, knowing that we are all your children by grace as you have called us. May there be a fellowship in this church. Seeing that we're just about to emerge into some great move. We field of bringing up other ministers to go out into the fields of where if you shall send me into the different parts of the world there to establish the faith and to have a minister ready and willing and trained to take over. Amen. &gt;&gt; And may the faith that was once delivered to the saints that we are gallantly standing for become a circle around the world. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord. May this little weed pile as it was one day when we dedicated it to you. May there be a church rise up here Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that out of it shall go ministers and advances and teachers and missionaries to all parts of the world. &gt;&gt; We would ask this morning a special blessing for our brothers and sisters stricker who's suffering now, but we know that we're all put to these tests. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every son that cometh to God must be chasened, tried, and if we give up easy and turned back, then we are illegitimate children and not the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give brother and sisters stricter strength and power to stick to their post of duty. &gt;&gt; If they have to beg what food they eat, let thy hand of blessing be upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. For we know not, but it might be through that very effort that you'd show the native of Africa what a real Christian is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Now, let it all be done according to thy will. Bless this pastor, Brother Neville. &gt;&gt; We pray, Lord, that you'll make him a shepherd of the flock as you have in past. And we would not forget his lovely little wife who is very sick. The enemy would like to leave brother Neville that group of children with no mother. &gt;&gt; But we STAND AND PLACE BY faith the blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; between that enemy and our sister. &gt;&gt; May your spirit, Lord, be great upon her, &gt;&gt; knowing that all women are ordained to walk down through this valley of darkness of this age. We pray that you'll be with her. Bless those little children. She'll be nervous now and fretful, but may the Holy Ghost be at the door of mercy at all times for that family. &gt;&gt; Bless our trustee board, our brother Wood, and our brother Egan, brother Roersonson, and all of the others, Lord, deacons, trustees, and all that's associated in the church. We pray Lord that you'll let them serve their term with holiness and &gt;&gt; and righteousness. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Bless those Lord who has served in the times past. &gt;&gt; And we pray that you'll continue to be with all of us that we will be known as a church of unity and spirit and love of the Lord. We pray now that you'll divide to us the word as we have need as we read out of thy written word. For we asked it in Jesus' name. Amen.
