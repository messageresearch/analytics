snapped really to leave in a few brothers out it was just an emergency that came up and and because we were not ready to spend more than we have already spent so the brothers had to put a hinge to the work to be able to quickly save us so this morning a mine being kind of a growing year in there and then we were just singing their song this morning there will be no sorrow there and there will be no you know no pain no sickness no mourning no more than no more and so my mind was kind of a kind of a dwelling on something here that I wanted to speak about but I would talk on Exodus chapter 10 let's let's react Sitter chapter 10 together thank you sister now me for the music thank you brother scan for the Psalms thank you brothers and sisters for your prayers Exeter chapter 10 this really Exeter chapter taint you get it praise the Lord exeter chapter 10 let's read from verse 21 exeter chapter 10 verse 21 and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out the hand towards heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be felt I want to talk on darkness that can be felt the Moses stretched for his hands towards heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days they saw net one another need arose in him from his place for three days but all the children of Israel halite India dwelling let's pray together Heavenly Father you are the

is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness to people but the law shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen first of all we mean we may never know and understand the darkness that meaning is feeling in this hour praise the Lord and I just read about a neighbor this morning in Rosemount and very very wonderful man I mean testify about all of his neighbors and I mean he was he was now welding I mean he was in the hospital and at the time they thought he has break out of you know the the cover sickness they took him home and right when he got home he asked to sit down and I mean he just he just started struggling over his birth and kept telling his wife I can't breathe you know I can breathe better and then in a short period of time he he was gone and a meaning I mean many families Christians I mean four people are experiencing hurting in different things and just thinking about this and account for a little bit struggling my mind this morning and I mean to be able to to speak on this in a way that it would be it would be edifying to us who be able to draw strength from me praise the Lord know that brother branham rare from this as I chapter or scripture when he preached a message Shalom and he was kind of a distraction letting us to know that the day that we are living in you know that the darkness there was the gross darkness that was upon the people was a spiritual darkness and and we can see a shadow of that in the book of Exodus and I will also bring us to the place to realize that that is one of the Exeter experience when world is experiencing darkness then it's time for an accident because there was one of the play and and and if you also look at the seals I was going to do something a little bit this morning were blood Branum he was able to to to let us see there let's let's let's look at that a little bit over in Matthew chapter 24 before we look at this subject together let just go to Matthew chapter 24 and and see if we can be able to follow their together my to chapter 24 verb and indeed there are like a Bible study when he was preaching the seals and I love some things he said I dropped that in my note this morning he said this the 6u he said now let's look to match you the 24 chapter the lamb himself speaking now anyone knows that Jesus is the author of the whole book as as far as they are concerned but his species is salmon to the people all right to the Jews then he dropped down again he said now watch this name and you can find out and see what the lamb here is showing exactly in symbol what he said over year in words doing exactly now what he's talking about is that what Jesus is saying in Matthew chapter 24 it's what he's showing in Revelation chapter 6 in a symbol form so the entire Matthew chapter 24 where Branham says that was the seals Jesus in his earthly ministry was telling the disciples he was preaching the seals but in his ministry in a church ages coming back in a form of the Holy Ghost he is carrying John that is a type of the bride he's showing John the very same thing he preached in Matthew chapter 24 let's look at their together a little bit and and the reason why I want to do that is it would help me to be able to bring out my subject a little bit here he says over in Matthew chapter 24 and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciple came to him to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world now brother Branham there he said also there he said every scallop when ready to talk about the tribulation they will go over to Matthew chapter 24 because there Jesus from his own mouth talked about the great tribulation that we come but then he also helped us to understand that Jesus was addressing three questions even though he did not point out and says well your first question you asked me this is the answer the second question you asked me this is the answer because he always spoke in parables so but he was addressing the three questions that were asking about a disciple he says tell us when shall these things be because Jesus has already said there will now be one stone left upon another so when with these things be and he says also they asked him what is the sign of your coming and what is also the tare question is the end of the word so he says here if you if you compare that with Revelation chapter 6 so let's open back in for Matthew chapter 24 Revelation chapter 6 we will go back and forth with that and and hope that we can be able to just do a little Bible studies here with brother Branham out of the the six seals and now so over here in the sixth seal Revelation chapter six I mean Revelation chapter six over in Revelation chapter six not just the six you but over in Revelation chapter 6 because Revelation chapter 6 speaks of all the seals now Revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal and I heard in it word a noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see Matthew chapter 12 Jesus spoke and the tundle rode in heaven and and the disciples heard it under the people around here that under Jesus heard the voice he said this voice came because of you Moses on the mountain when God was giving him the commandments sounded out to the people they were year in lightning and thunder coming from the mountain Moses was hearing - honesty thou shalt not bear false witness and he was writing all of those things down and but down the people were hearing lightning and thunder now so we it allows a loud thunder year and and one of the four beasts saying come and see now he says here and I saw and behold a white house and he does sat on him had a board and a crown was given unto him and he went forth to come he went forth conquering and to conquer now a mighty chapter 24 verse four and five jesus said jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many so yeah Jesus here in his earthly ministry answering this question the first thing in a three question that he approached to answer was there will be many false Christ's under the seal the first horse rather was growing without you know an arrow aboard the Antichrist so brother branham here is trying to make us to understand that this seals and the revelation of the seals was Jesus Christ he was the one that interpret his word because he's saying a year in his earthly ministry compared to what he revealed to John in Revelation chapter 6 so here is the first the first seal open wave the Antichrist and Jesus answering the three question his first answer he start with is with the Antichrist praise the Lord Revelation chapter 6 and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second be saying come and see and there went out another hers that was red the red house and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and dead and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great song Matthew chapter 24 verse 6 and yes I hear of wars and rumors of war once see that he may be net trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet and one of the question was when is the end of the world praise the Lord and Jesus here he first talked about the Antichrist the next thing he talked about wars and rumors of war when the first few was open there was a white horse and the rider had a ball he never had no arrow when the second sea was open there was the the Red House was going with swore killing and there fulfill wars and Romans of war I will to get it praise the Lord early in chapter 6 verse 5 and when he had opened they tells you I heard the third beast saying come and see and behold a black house and he that sat on him had a pair of balance in his hands and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine praise the Lord now Wednesday night we were talking about seller of oil but then when we look when we look at this beast they never had the oil they were only selling Ballad of wheat praise the Lord they were not supposed to touch the oil and the wine praise the Lord they only had a ballad of wheat bourbon type that honor the church edges you know when purgatory and Catholic Church style is setting all of these things and you know keeping people places you know for internal life and all of that so back to Matthew chapter 24 now ever seven he says for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence now brother branham put that honor the tears you for me because here a ballot of wheat for a penny amen he says he placed that under the test you because I mean you see they're also on Elijah ministry when when there was famine in the land I mean there was I mean there was rushing for food and in order so he placed their honor that tells you where we have this but we have to realize here he says that the eye shall not hurt the oil and the wine and he says and when verse seven and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the four beasts saying come and see and behold and lo and behold a pale horse and his Inn and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth now if you take this and you take it back to what we read some time ago over in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 14 and the the for the force called whip that God used to deal with Israel we realize the same thing is also year applying over to the Gentile Church in in year we find a song we find hunger we find that and we find a piece of the earth now but bourbon a year would take this then I'm losing my place here okay in verse eight he says and these are just the beginning of sorrow then they shall deliver you they will deliver you up to be afflicted and they shall kill you you see that's the pure hearts death they will kill you and nehi and they shall be hurt of all nations for my name's sake and then he went on it says and and and and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another you know and many false prophet and shall rise and shall deceive many I'm going a little bit ahead of myself here but let me let me kind of a slow down so we read right here the four seal open and over in the fifth seal he says and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the for the word of God and for the testimony which they had now I was listening to her Branham this morning he says remember that the bride over in the book of Revelation had the testimony of Jesus Christ he said but this one they were slain for the testimony which they had he said so this displaced this and identify this as the Jews okay honor this fifth seal he said I blessed and identified him as the Jews so as we look here also were the scripture are speaking here and talking about and they shall deliver you up and afflict you in and kill you he says in many be offended and they shall be trade one another and they shall hate one another you know brother Brennan brought that out you know and he talked about a little bit you know during the time of the I mean Hitler Holocaust and all of their how they produce upon Jews you know you know they were some of those Jews to save the alive they had to persecute their brothers you know and some of them found favor with with the Germans and different government in the world and they were said even though they had they had the six Star of David on their hand but yet they were the one that was persecuting their brothers you know and he brought that out so he pleased that right under the fifth seal so then he goes on here you know with those ones he sees in the crime with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true they are dead Josh and avenge the blood of them dared war upon the earth and they were giving white robes he says there had to be the Jews then he come over here to the sixth seal now this will kind of a grab our attention a little bit wider you know because as I was studying on this on this darkness on this darkness that could be felt and I was trying to look through the scripture and look through the message I came directly over here into the SEC seal because that's where bourbon also talked about darkness that will come upon the earth so that's how I got into all this but that's okay so he said yet and the six you and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell onto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken wave a mighty wing and the heaven departed as a straw now under the the six-year brother Branham says this is one of the longest seal he says why he said because the sixth seal is the seal of judgment but he said the six you being a seal of judgment the bride is not supposed to be here at that time because God is not going to take his wife true judgment praise the Lord so he says the bride is not supposed to be here now the reason why I'm saying there and making emphasis is because talking about this darkness that can be failed and and in reading over here in the sixth seal I'm not saying we are in this time because this darkness that can be felt is a spiritual darkness as compared to the darkness over in Isaiah 60 verse 1 verbatim say it was a spiritual darkness we know when that when when that when the angel of the Lord came down and drew the church ages on the blackboard loud assured age was in darkness praise the Lord now let's watch another thing when we come true the sixth seal yeah in Revelation chapter six the six view is from verse 12 to verse 17 praise the Lord that's the six you now if you read over in Jesus own when he when he spoke to his disciples on this he went true and his sex you was all that he talked about that close well I mean I'm Archie chapter 24 now you can see why the Seventh Seal was selling because Matthew chapter 25 behold the bridegroom cometh is the seven seals praise the Lord so just like how John was shown the seals in the book of Revelation where Branham says Jesus spoke about that in Matthew chapter 24 he spoke by from the first seal to the six you and he left its ally he just left it like that when he came to the seven see you he brought a parable of the bridegroom that cometh are we together praise the Lord now so when we look at this this darkness that is failed let's go to Genesis chapter 1 let's get to our subject now I think I free myself a little bit by talking on this here I mean I take I think it's I think it's easy dealing dealing with the pool when the people are there than when they are pulling you through these through the through the media whatsoever device that here they are following the service wave the food I mean their fourth dimension is just going through my body it's making me more nervous Genesis chapter 1 let's go to Genesis chapter 1 I can stand you're looking I mean what are you are owning or anything I can stand it but you know you pull him in through those media is just cheap my body to sew pieces yeah praise the Lord Genesis chapter 1 let's look at this together now we did a little bit of a study on Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning and we said that beginning was the foundation because the the foundation is the beginning of anything amen so everything that God did for the elite for you and myself he did it right in their beginning now look at verse 2 praise the Lord and I will want you to to take note on this verse to do your own Bible studies on it whatever you find call me and let's fellowship together the earth was without form and Val now we're talking about darkness now look at this and darkness was upon the face of the D since almost 5 o'clock this morning I've been sitting down and just reading looking through the scripture looking through the code the face of the deep what is this darkness was upon the face of the deep what is the face of the deep do your Bible studies I will I will I will appreciate wherever you find sharing with me praise the Lord I will have the opportunity for you to preach to me into darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water praise the Lord amen the face of the waters we can be able to find it you know Jesus walk on water we can take that as a type but the face of the deep I want us to study there together let's go ahead now and God said let there be light and there was light praise the Lord a so we want to look at this darkness that could be fed we realized that there was judgment coming to to Egypt anybody but the Bible said the place was so dark that he could not even see one another praise the Lord they could not see one another everybody was in their place and the darkness could be felt praise the Lord Amen now so when you look at this subject of darkness right from Genesis chapter one that we have just read a darkness that was upon the face of the deep I'm going to take this word darkness I'm going to take deep and we will follow it through alone in in Scripture together it might be able to help us praise the Lord the word deep the next time we will find the scripture using that word was when God told Adam to a deep sleep phrase alone was where a God put Adam to a deep sleep and we know that at a time that God told Adam to a deep sleep it was under a type of redemption I am going to a deep sleep it was just like Jesus going to the cross and when he was on the cross what happened there was darkness again the earth the Sun refused to shine the moon refused to show its light it was darkness just at a time word the bride was going to be released from our Lord Jesus side there was darkness are we together amen now so and and and and we see that that was there was a place in the scripture that just that just I just caught my attention I never saw him till this morning you remember when David was running away from Saul praise the Lord and he got there on I mean hide himself in the mountain and saw running after him the occasion where David came close he came close and he caught off saw Garmin the scripture says First Samuel chapter 26 verse 12 their Lord allowed a deep sleep to come upon yeah that's a there's there's that's the Hebrew word that I saw Amy yeah this morning that's that's right praise the Lord he Allah a deep sleep once again to come on Saul and I was thinking oh my goodness what what actually was God trying to bring out of that picture because the second time to the time of Adam that God would do that was Genesis chapter 15 and Genesis chapter 15 is also about Redemption because God was sealing his promise because he there was no one greater than him and he could not swim and no one else he was swearing by himself he brought Abraham out to a place Abraham brought all the sacrifice and set everything out and and and it came to a place he had to put deep sleep on Abraham again praise the Lord amen and you will and you will realize that it always goes with darkness because there was darkness came and a deep sleep fell on Abraham which of course will read few coats were better Brannon commented on them we were try to close our or I was subject with those but as we look at that and we and we look at at Egypt and what was happening being in Egypt there's another scripture also and they lied to that kind of a caught my attention praise the Lord are we together amen amen I mean a darkness that can be fair praise the Lord even darkness which may be felt God said I'm going to put darkness and a darkness that will be felt praise the Lord you know and we we talking about base and just like I said you were we may never know you know the feelings that are in the heart of meaning that are going through this I mean beautiful crystal people and some of them we ask the question why do I ask why I have to be this time you know they will have it they will have a question that will I mean they will trouble their faith in God I mean they are going to ask question upon question and some of their question will never be answered in this life praise the Lord because this is coming I mean it's coming it's really coming home with many families most especially when people will I mean lost in the loved ones we know we know that we all might go by the weight of you know the gate of death if the Lord Jesus tarried but just not to be able I mean to give their last respect I mean to be able to gather with family and friends and celebrate the homegoing of a loved one it can be felt praise the Lord it can be felt many work in their way it's true Edea the gallery means of their loved ones in different things now just like I said we might never know the kind of a feeling that many are dealing with but beyond this also there is an inner darkness that many are also dealing with it's a spiritual darkness praise the Lord sometimes people come on the the you know the the shadow of the world why I say the shadow of the word because it takes light and darkness to project a shadow when a person is dealing with a dark path they can come in in they can come and confront the word they can come and come you know in contact with the truth of God's Word now because there is a darkness that is that is dwelling within and I mean and whether is India spear arena I mean in India to train or is India spirit room as I said and if it comes in contact with the word it going to cast a shadow and sometimes I mean looking at the shadow can give the person an idea and you can say all world I think God brought me through this because of a reason God brought me through this but you see the thing about it there is that back into Genesis when the light of God appeared darkness was upon the face of the deep but when the light of God appeared a casted darkness away praise the Lord amen in the light of God's Word the light of the Holy Spirit the light of the message of the hour the purpose of slide is to cast every darkness and when darkness of feared darkness of doubt darkness of the past this light of God must cast it away and that's what Isaiah said arise and shine because your light has come amen you cannot stay you cannot walk in this light and beholding darkness within there is no same darkness that can stop this light if a person will be hauling a darkness of the past or a darkness in their life is because you have not opened a window for the light to shine true but if you open the window of your heart and your mind and the light of God shine true is going to cast that darkness away God has not called us to walk in shadows he had called us to walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin amen praise the Lord well somebody might have pressed my body just now praise the Lord Amen glory be to God but well in common is it but one I was looking at the service you know a didn't know that we we were doing some work at the church hisses he says wow it looks like you preaching in a cloud you say your back is all while I told you were in the car that's a while but one especially he was teasing me in a little bit well praise the Lord now X to the chapter 14 so chapter 14 now Pharaoh has seen the hand of God and he have cried to Moses one time he told Moses get it from my face don't come back to mean again I don't want to hear nothing about that God you are talking about he says I don't want to see your face again Moses said okay you my face you will not see again praise the Lord after the darkness came and the Angel of Death Star to strike the lane he was the one that sent for Moses Moses was not coming to him again to say let my people go he was the one that sent for Moses now the scripture says here in exit of 14 in a time of the accident they have started moving out the Bible say verse 19 and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind him and and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind him and it came between the camp of the Egyptian and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud of Darkness unto them praise the Lord but it gave light by night to this which was the children of Israel so that the one cam that saw that the one came not now the order or the night praise the Lord men watch this now the Bible says here that the the the pillar of fire which was by night was the same pillar of cloud by day it just it just became a cloud the light went into the cloud so it became a cloud by day and by night it was a pillar of fire but what I want us to too to grab here is that a came between the camp Hebrew let's go to the book of Hebrew Hebrew chapter 4 verse 12 the scripture says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit praise the Lord now I'm taking the pillar of fire that came between the camp as the word of God that that that you know that the heart the abilities are dividing asunder that comes between the spirit and the soul like it like the scripture says here just like because we know that a pillar of fire was was God I was moving in a camp and the word that we have today the word that we're reading in the Bible the word that we listening to on Ted is God in printed form the same with a pillar of fire when between the camp of the Egyptian and the cam of Israel that is the same where the word of God is shopping a to edge of sward and it can cut right the dividing line it's able to separate us from anything of the past it's able to cut things from our spirit called things we might remember it but we don't have the effect we cannot feed an effect on us we cannot feed that effect of the darkness of the past that's what the Holy Ghost we do that's what the true Word of God will do and we cut us from the effect of the past the memory of the past will be there but the effect of the past will be gone praise the Lord amen so just like how the pillar of fire went between the Egyptian in Israel kept them in kept the Egyptian in darkness and it was projecting light to the children of Israel that is the same thing that the Word of God would do praise the Lord that's the same thing that the Word of God would do amen we have we have a promise amen we stay have the injurer of the Lord in our camp the one that discern our knees is the word of God shepherd in a two-edged wall descend our tots the intents of our heart the word knows our needs this word is not just a black and white on paper this world we are talking about is Jesus Christ that is coming out of the pages of the book and he's meeting us in a personal experience oh that's the reason why we cannot overemphasize on the baptism of the Holy Ghost touch not the oil and annoyed and and the wine in the oil its care for a group of people praise the Lord amen the Holy Spirit rebuke that Antichrist spirit in that church age and said don't touch it you know you might you might you know say a ballad for a week give a false interpretation here tell people to buy and their place in purgatory in order there but when it comes to that truth anointing don't touch it amen a darkness that can be felt praise the Lord we are not called to death that is not our promise amen God did with our darkness and that's what brother Branham said there happening over in Genesis chapter 15 he said God proved to Abraham that he was the one that had to take care of everything everything of the past he was going to take care of it everything of the future he would take care of it if we would just believe praise the Lord amen he says if we will just believe everything of the past everything of the future calling of Abraham 1955 he said yea all is marvelous he kept the bird off of it until the Sun went down notice then a deep sleep fell on Abraham the first thing Abraham I'm just going to shut you off to assure you there is now one thing you can do about it praise the Lord yes Abraham they're making this little effort and driving the birds away then driving the birds away and you know doing his little effort against my battles doing his little effort against weakness of the flesh but he came to a place were deep sleep just fell on him do you know that feeling I mean you just they're trying to read your Bible God so loved the world and deep sleep just fall and the good thing the Bible just fall right on your face my goodness that's when God moves upon the face of the water oh man praise the Lord he says and this is my coveting and it wasn't one thing brother that you could do about it it is in one thing sister that you done about it is what God did for you in Christ now because you was good now because of our mother that was good but what Christ was good and Christ did he did by calling you and what Christ did by calling you amen he says put him to sleep now he was he hasn't got anything to do with it so after he went to sleep then there came a rear deep horrible darkness praise the Lord after God has already sake you like a scripture said he gave his beloved sleep he gave his beloved Abraham put him to sleep he says then a horrible darkness what did that mean hell separation every sinner deserve it separation he says and then beyond that was a burning furnace death separation hell after death to every sinner but then beyond that when a little white light amen I hope you never disbelieve no more from this hour I hope you see there amen praise the Lord just like how the the pillar of fire or the pillar of cloud went between the camp of the Egyptian and the cam of Israel that was just how this little library Branham says in the midst of the darkness a little I just went right between the sacrifice praise the Lord Abraham asleep and in a vision showing that every man must come to this horrible darkness of separation dead there's that every man deserve to go to hell cause he's a sinner he fell he is the offspring of a sinner and then beyond there when the little white light in other word the same pillar of fire they follow Israel amen the same pillar of fire that went between the cam of the Egyptian and a cam of Israel I seen pillar of fire he says that follow Israel the same holy spirit this year tonight that is here today the symbolic spirit that is keeping us praise the Lord we Bela put value on this thing that we have received like I'm saying you don't know what is the inner feeling of many that are going through this you don't know what the feeling is we listen to the news we listened to toto whatever we listening to about the inner feeling that many are having in this time you don't know what it is why because that little light has sprung in your heart can you imagine that some needs to to to inject your body for them to feel happy some need to put themselves on some kind of a medication for them to get just just feel happy what it takes to make you happy just singing a song do you think it's just easier for everybody oh we to be grateful we have to be grateful we might not have what this world have on the outside but what God has given us inside there was nothing can replace it or you did not work for it is a free gift nothing you did about it at this LaFell all we have no idea of the darkness that many are feeling they can put their mind around it some wealthy people that have all their money stuck in in I mean in the word economy in the word investment they have all all your life I mean they plan for their family they playing all their life in one night it's all gone you don't know there is no way the children of Israel who explain what the Egyptian was feeling a darkness where you can't even see your way through you can't even see the next person standing before you nothing makes sense and that's where the word is today that's where the word is that's where the word economy is that's where the word scientist is they have invested the alive and invested all the aesthetic now one illness has come up in a world where such comma adjust it yet through all the aesthetic through the window they are feeling it oh that is the reason why we can just I mean feed our minds with the thing on the internet and just laugh and just relax and order that we can get into that can you imagine traveling with Israel they are going on feet you are hearing terrorist sounds you are seeing that dust in the end of the Cheras of the Egyptians that are coming after you you are seeing the dust in the air you are hearing the wheels on the ground you know what why make those people were crying and there no grave that we must die like this because you just thought that those Egyptian would just ride over them and that was the command that that Pharaoh gave his soldier ride over them don't grab them by the hands don't stop them run them over with the charrids here shake that cloud just came down they can hear the noise they can see the dust that is in a we can hear it on the media of the hundreds of people that I affected with this we can we can see the dust we don't have the liberty you have the Holy Ghost does not make you in and different from people that don't have the liberty you have to respect it you have to respect the law you know I was I was looking at this the other day reading the news there's a preacher there some more in a country he defy the staying home open his church and you know what happened he died from from from the illness there's another young girl when this was just coming up she went on social media and she posted that she has the cover now Dean I mean and she going around in the in in the grocery store touching people and telling them she has to cover nothing she thought she was joking what she died for me so this is not a jokey thing it's not a thing to pull every joke from the internet and just laugh about it it's not funny it's not funny the serious if God has been gracious unto us we must we must appreciate it and the evidence of the Holy Spirit the evidence of you appreciating what God has done for you you'll be on your knees praying for others it's a sign that you are real into the place word you are appreciating what God has done for you I thought about the heiress's Isis Isis what what wrong did he did what wrong he did by opening his church what was the wrong the wrong was he did not had the wisdom of God praise the Lord to know that this was not a science thing this was not a China thing this was something that that was the entire world was evolved and when the entire world is evolved and we know that a hint of God is behind it praise the Lord we know that the hand of God is behind it you never know the darkness that people are feeling on the church religion some of them this soul sees I mean they can sow a million-dollar tide and he can they can give money into all of these mega church but yet there is a darkness that is India heart there is a darkness that is India heart there is a song that rebirth sank and and when he tell his testimony he said in a song that he sang this is what the author is for he he was struggling over what once was a habit they have now become a word of life for him and he had that darkness within and he was struggling but yet he will not say to anybody he talked that was what the author for I go to the author that confess my sins and as you just go away what happened is that you just come in contact with light and the light and darkness mix will always project a shadow and sometimes we take that shadow to be salvation no salvation is light it's a for light it's a full life of Christ that is living in a believer it's not a shadow life you never know the darkness that people under the church system feeling they love the Lord they read a Bible they know they know that this is just not enough Sunday church is not enough singing in the choir is not enough there is just something more there is just something you know that there is something they can look at their own life not people that would sit down under the message and make excuses of living wrong just because the thing they have believed believe the Prophet you are just living a shadow life you have a light that is the message of the hour but there is a darkness that is in your heart that needs to go away if you are really accepting this life if you are really align this life to shine through you it will blow every form of Darkness away we can call the Prophet and sometimes our mind is so weakened give us an opportunity or somebody to step on our toes and see the kind of things that we would do see the things that would come from our mouth we are caught in a profit of the age do you know that those songs of the profits they have an idea that Elijah was going to rapture but it never had the the the the power of Elijah they only had a knowledge of the rapture they only had the knowledge of the rapture but it never had a double portion timing and knowledge of the rapture having a knowledge of the messenger it's not enough this message is the light of God and there is enough light in this thing to blow every form of Darkness away what are a darkness of tradition the darkness of creed a darkness from some kind of a familiar spirit this message of the hour this light of God is able to blow every darkness away if you are feeling the form of darkness is because you using it too high you are using it too high if you just open the window praise the Lord just open the window let the Sun let the sunlight of gosh on through your house brother Branham says how can a man deny that there is light they tell him that the sun is shining outside he goes down in his basement he close said I don't believe it he closed the window I don't believe there is light house that I saw doc he just closed all the windows praise the Lord I think I'm glad I need to stop a stud jumping or order these things so song I'm looking for windows to close better Jody but that was the thing I was thinking about brother sketch a kind of a darkness that people are feeling and we want to blame the message and we want to blame God why I'm a god we now open in the window to God's Word we now open in our heart we are so stuck in our ways we can come in contact with the light we rejoice with thank God we enjoyed our feeling and that warmness of the light and then we just slip back into our darkness slip back into our dark path dark ways Jesus's men love darkness more than light I mean with all the things he was doing raising their dead healing their sake and this is the promise of the Messiah that was given to them yet they enjoy korrina's singing a son my God my god waha God forsaken me my God my God yeah singing the psalm of David and the word is fulfilled right before their eyes they are thinking the psalm of David and the word is fulfilled right before their eyes the light that is there to set them free eliminate their mind brighten their spirit writing their spirit that's the reason why a man or the woman with the Holy Ghost no matter how things happen and you feed his courage and I mean you are trouble in your mind where Baron says something here let me just read it oh my goodness reading the prophet will help me here amen he said it in a way the message fit 1956 he said in a way that I think it said better he says and the first thing the Bible said that God caused a deep sleep to come upon Abraham a deep sleep Abraham I'm going to show you that you you are not nothing to do with this I'm I'm going to do it myself the job is going to be right when he does it when go do it the jar will be right take your hands off it let God do it praise the Lord people use I mean curse words only a children curse words on their grandchildren and he expecting any better from them take your hands up let's go to the work yes brother that's where I rest right there God says so I'm not saved tonight because I feel like it I'm not saved by feeling I'm saved because I have believed it and met the condition of the Bible what is it repent and be baptized that's what it says repent and be baptized he says that devil can beat you around the slum tomorrow morning you may get up with a headache and feel like a million miles away but God grace ho tight you might be caught in the winner confused and don't even know yesterday from tomorrow but the grace of God hold tight because there is light in the chamber amen well God grace hotel yes sir yes sir now what you feel about what you believe tell me about what you believe don't tell me about what you feel tell me about what you believe Amy oh my praise the Lord I don't know you know I don't know what the time here but I've just started preaching because I'm feeling good now amen praise the Lord break the icing and I mean you people can pull me through the through the media I'm ready to go hair body and spirit just all myself like innocent poor I mean you might find me right in your living room amen praise the Lord amen if I get through here then brother scary you just come and close the service [Laughter] praise the Lord oh my but that day I mean you just think about it what people are feeling the feeling that they are having living in fear they always fear there's a shadow there was somebody coming after them when a believer have to live every day the angel of the Lord I didn't come about them they fear Him we know that we can't even step outside we found an angel and accompanying us they all will not allow you to go anywhere without sending an angel to accompany you it's not just a talk it's a feeling we can feed it until as a believer even when your trust starts to go wrong that angel better Baron said he gave you a bomb thing right praise the Lord you ever to bring yourself in the right channel of mine because there is a light that lives in the believer that's the thing that gives us hope and people see you smiling that I even know why are you smiling about your light has just turned on that is brightening through your face when the light turn on your cheeks go up praise the Lord I think instead of telling people smile just said and turn the light on a little bit Amy while the word is feeling darkness we are feeling our light we can feel the warmness of his presence in our heart we can feel the warmness of his presence led two or three gather together we are not we are not in a church building we just down here inverted Jordan house but I can just see his presence here this hopeless just feeling his presence I'm feeling so good I have to tell myself that I'm am I'm in someone's house you know when his presence comes down whether it is on a tree or in a boat you feel so good those disciples they were so terrified that night with the storm and everything when he heard that word from Jesus it is I be not afraid you know the feeling that came to the house Wow thank you thank you thank you they could feel it as a word it's feeling darkness in your spirit darkness in your mind we are feeling his light we are feeling his light the church bright feeling inside I mean when that life starts to shine in you and brighten you I mean if there is any crush he exposes a quake you take it under the blood if there is any bitterness that light would expose it you can't keep bitterness honor this light that is what I mean John talked about over in his book you can walk in the light and in darkness at the same time you can hold the two together the prophet of God says as far as I know he says I don't have one thing against anybody that is a believer session himself aligned the light of God who goes through you as far as you know there must not be anything that should be too hard for you to let go there should be nothing that you can forgive the light of God praise the Lord God's covenant with Abraham where Bram said is lemme let's read this together we'll find a place to close here and it's hard for me to get out of this I kind of a struggle to get in this now it's hard to get out a me and he says no this the first thing that every man has nothing to do with God taking Abraham plumb out of his senses kicking out of his senses don't reason it don't think about it that's right he was asleep he mean you know what that sleeper means to the believer jesus told his disciples he says let's go over to Lazarus for his lipid there were means death to sing amen it's word we put the flesh to sleep and then yeah a horrible fear dread comes on him that's death do that every every one he says and then he looked who was the sacrifice and when he did he saw a smoking Phonics every sinner deserve to go to hell that's right and then he noticed beyond that when a little white light that's the Shekinah glory and they went right in between every piece of this animal is the light of God that pillow of fire sometimes when you
