[20:57] amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[21:00] tonight let's go right to the Word of
[21:02] God 1st Corinthians chapter 8 we just
[21:07] want to read the scripture yet remind
[21:09] ourself and go right into the convenient
[21:14] to 90 means first Corinthians chapter 8
[21:17] praise the Lord
[21:26] let's read from verse one
[21:33] first Corinthians chapter 8 let's read
[21:35] from verse 1 tonight
[21:36] now as touching things offer unto idols
[21:41] we know that we all have knowledge
[21:47] knowledge puffs up but charity edifieth
[21:52] and if any man think that he knoweth
[21:56] anything you know what nothing yet as he
[22:00] ought to know but if a man love God the
[22:07] same is known of him as concerning
[22:11] therefore the eating of those things
[22:13] that are offered in sacrifice unto idols
[22:18] we know that an idol is nothing amen
[22:26] and we just read their phrase together
[22:29] we know that we know that an idol is
[22:33] nothing in the world and that there is
[22:38] none other but one prays alone you
[22:45] believe there tonight for though there
[22:50] be that are called girls whether in
[22:54] heaven or on earth as there be girls
[22:59] many in loss meaning but to us there is
[23:05] one God praise the Lord
[23:09] now remember now one ask my finger one
[23:13] but one God as the one that filled it
[23:16] all space and time amen
[23:20] one God in your heart is the same in my
[23:24] heart
[23:26] praise the Lord but to us there is but
[23:31] one God the Father of whom are all
[23:34] things and we in him out of the oneness
[23:39] and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom all
[23:43] things by whom
[23:46] things and we by him let's pray together
[23:51] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[23:54] want to ask your blessings tonight upon
[23:56] your word and the rest of the service in
[23:59] Jesus name we pray amen
[24:01] first Corinthians chapter 10 you may
[24:05] have your seat let's read from verse 16
[24:14] the cup of blessing which we bless is it
[24:20] not the communion of the blood of Christ
[24:24] the bread which we break is it not the
[24:28] communion of the body of Christ for we
[24:33] be meaning a one bread in one body for
[24:38] we are all partakers of death one breath
[24:44] praise the Lord amen
[24:47] behold Israel after the flesh and now
[24:51] they which eat of the sacrifices
[24:54] partakers of the order was a adding that
[25:01] the idols is anything all that which is
[25:05] offered in sacrifice to idols is
[25:10] anything but I say they're the things
[25:14] which the Gentiles sacrifice they they
[25:17] sacrifice to devils and not to God and I
[25:23] who net that yes you have fellowship
[25:25] with Devils praise the Lord
[25:29] amen I want to talk a little bit about
[25:31] convenient tonight and word I want to go
[25:35] to all that I won't continue from where
[25:37] I stopped a little bit this morning I
[25:39] want to say to us tonight there we must
[25:43] not idolize this table Amen praise the
[25:50] Lord the communion is just the part of
[25:55] the world we are just coming to obey
[25:58] what the Word of God
[26:00] says praise the Lord let us not
[26:06] otherwise because thou there was the
[26:09] struggle the Church of Corinth was
[26:12] having the people were so caught up in a
[26:15] lot of idolatry worshiping moon stars
[26:18] image and and a lot of things and I
[26:21] would say tonight idolatry has always
[26:23] walked parallel with the gospel God
[26:27] called our father Abraham out of
[26:29] idolatry amen it had been to the so
[26:33] called better Branham says preached a
[26:35] message
[26:36] idolatry vs. Christianity and and and we
[26:40] will have that battle until God take us
[26:43] home until the rapture we will fight
[26:46] against idols in every way praise the
[26:51] Lord Amen I mean we will fight against
[26:54] idols there is a true revelation of God
[26:58] in our heart at the positive God but yet
[27:01] the devil he he he want to wash it will
[27:06] bring out things you know to distract us
[27:10] or to get our devotion to praise the
[27:15] Lord we traveled a little bit in the
[27:17] message of God rich in mercy land let's
[27:19] see what brother Branham say here
[27:20] tonight just for a little reading he
[27:23] said God is interesting in everything
[27:27] that's wrong everything that you
[27:33] anticipate in every walks of life God is
[27:40] interesting in you you are his child and
[27:44] he is rich in mercy praise the Lord
[27:49] now so with this thought what better
[27:52] Bannon was bringing alone is that God
[27:54] has made provision in every age in
[27:56] giving his people on a to me because
[28:01] he's interesting in our health he gave
[28:04] them a brazen serpent amen
[28:07] he interested in our deliverance he gave
[28:10] them a smitten Rock and because he
[28:14] interesting in everything that concerns
[28:16] us God always make a provision for his
[28:20] children praise the Lord
[28:22] but here is the thing here is that he
[28:25] will go ahead to let us to know that
[28:27] every time God will provide something
[28:29] for his children
[28:30] instead of the people worshiping the
[28:32] giver they they get himself attached to
[28:35] the gift and make an idol out of the
[28:38] gift praise the Lord
[28:43] amen he go ahead he says the people sing
[28:51] later by taking the same thing that God
[28:53] has made an atonement for them by the
[28:56] brazen stepping which represented seen
[29:00] already George and they idolized that
[29:03] gift and that's what I was saying God in
[29:08] saundra times he had endeavored manners
[29:13] in Diver ways and divert things God has
[29:16] used but people will analyze those
[29:20] things and miss the reality amen the
[29:27] communion is now all about the bread and
[29:29] the wine is about being obedient to the
[29:32] Word of God praise the Lord because if
[29:39] we miss that we go straight into
[29:42] idolatry
[29:52] the thing that God provided for them the
[29:55] brazen steppin yes this is the very god
[29:58] I say have no graven image but yet he
[30:01] told Moses to build a brazen serpent put
[30:05] it on the poor so if he was seeing on
[30:10] have no graven image and then tell Moses
[30:13] to build a brazen serpent and put it on
[30:15] the pole so which meant God was now so
[30:18] much interested in the brazen setting he
[30:22] was interested in what it represented
[30:28] praise the Lord he was interested in
[30:32] what it represented and God tonight is
[30:35] interested in what this bread and wine
[30:38] represent tonight that's what he's
[30:42] interested in
[30:46] praise the Lord
[30:48] maybe sometimes some of our young people
[30:51] you know there there there yeah yeah it
[30:54] has it there with the apparent citizen
[30:56] you know while we can drink there the
[30:59] bread and the wine thinking that is
[31:07] something special its fulfillment of the
[31:12] word of God are we together
[31:19] and that's what I want for us to see
[31:21] tonight we are coming in obedience to
[31:24] the Word of God it's just like when the
[31:27] Bible says if there is one sick among
[31:31] you lay here covenant for the other and
[31:33] leather or anoint him with oil is the
[31:38] obedience to the scripture that God
[31:40] moves upon is not the oil
[31:44] praise the Lord is not the oil people
[31:47] will buy or from Jerusalem oil from
[31:50] Jordan
[31:51] they will whiz it over their head is the
[31:53] obedience told the scripture it's not
[31:56] all about the oil and that's what all
[32:01] these people making paper maestro to
[32:03] Jerusalem they will come and then they
[32:05] bring or I brought water from the Jordan
[32:07] sea for your deliverance I brought rock
[32:09] from from from from the dead seed and
[32:12] and they can make money out of it
[32:17] because there is just something in in
[32:20] Amman I want to wash it the earth they
[32:25] want to wash it the creature more than
[32:28] the Creator are we together idolize the
[32:39] gift he says that seen a game God will
[32:44] now share his glory with anybody
[32:47] therefore we can have no two three four
[32:50] girls there is only one God and he will
[32:55] not share his glory with anything else
[32:58] he is God alone see so as the hidden
[33:03] that the hidden have many girls we have
[33:07] the one God and He will not share his
[33:10] glory with another neither will he let
[33:13] anything be an idol in front of him
[33:18] praise the Lord
[33:20] so when God gave the people the brazen
[33:24] seven in prayer so they started
[33:29] worshipping the seven
[33:31] go how to destroy even though he had
[33:40] made an atonement for the people and it
[33:43] was God's Word it was right amen
[33:48] he said have no graven image but he said
[33:52] Moses you brick built a presence
[33:54] happened because of what a represented
[33:58] Amen if you take the representation away
[34:01] from it it's an idol are we together
[34:17] even though he had he had made an
[34:20] atonement for the people it was God's
[34:22] Word it was right but when the people
[34:25] when they become too idolizing death
[34:27] then they got into trouble
[34:32] amen
[34:34] they got into trouble praise the Lord
[34:38] and that's what I don't want us to do
[34:44] the communion is though is the Word of
[34:48] God we are walking in line with the
[34:50] scripture but we must now adelies it Oh
[34:58] as God takes his blessing for me praise
[35:04] the Lord
[35:07] if him and him alone so Paul was dealing
[35:14] with these Corinthians and seeing the
[35:17] things that they were struggling with
[35:22] for this form of different form of
[35:25] worship and adultery that was India miss
[35:29] Paul first wanted to erase from their
[35:33] mind that there is nothing like an idol
[35:36] and Idol is just man's imagination
[35:41] that's what an idol is it's just man's
[35:45] imagination using your mind to create an
[35:51] image using your mind to create an
[35:54] understanding instead of believing the
[35:59] promised Word of God
[36:07] he says as concerning the things
[36:09] sacrificed unto a let me tell you there
[36:11] is nothing there is nothing like an idol
[36:15] because everything that a man will
[36:18] fashion to wash it will be something
[36:24] that he had me how he to get it but then
[36:35] when we come over to to chapter 10 and
[36:38] he starts talking about a communion he
[36:41] says we know that everything that
[36:44] Gentiles sacrifice is a fellowship is a
[36:48] worship unto devils now so what what
[36:55] what is right in between there is dead
[36:57] ah this this all devil Lucifer separate
[37:02] from the beginning that says that he
[37:05] were as ultis his throne above the stars
[37:07] of God and he will have the children of
[37:09] God worshipping Him praise the Lord and
[37:12] because he want to be washing so he
[37:17] always tried to take us away from the
[37:20] reality of the word and create some kind
[37:23] of understanding in our mind instead of
[37:26] believing the word and what the Word of
[37:29] God says we want to put our faith in
[37:35] electro bread and wine
[37:42] we must be looking at the word we must
[37:46] be looking at the promise that is in the
[37:47] word Amen what God says in his word
[37:57] there's nothing above the word of God if
[38:00] we take it out of the word we have given
[38:04] ourselves an idol to Washington praise
[38:12] the Lord
[38:13] so Paul bringing these people down to
[38:15] communion and getting them ready for the
[38:18] communion service he's letting them to
[38:20] know that the bread represent Christ
[38:26] amen
[38:27] it represent his body and we are part of
[38:32] their body because we are identifying
[38:37] ourselves with the word amen
[38:40] so take yourself away from it you will
[38:43] be misinterpreting God's Word and we
[38:46] must not misinterpret the world
[38:53] praise the Lord
[38:57] so he's telling them don't don't don't
[38:59] create something special in your mind
[39:03] except the word bad thing I push the
[39:09] table in obedience to God's Word in
[39:12] obedience to God's Word and to God's
[39:14] Word alone
[39:16] nothing else are we together how many
[39:28] times the church has taught us you know
[39:33] when we get we'll get into the ceremony
[39:36] of preparing ourself for communion
[39:40] amen and when it's right after the
[39:43] company we must leave a prepare life
[39:45] every day amen
[39:48] we must prepare ourself every day for
[39:50] the rapture we must prepare ourself for
[39:53] a closer walk with God prepared ourself
[39:56] with a walk alive just like enough with
[39:58] God every day
[40:10] and I've gone through all of this
[40:12] workout in and and and that the church
[40:15] world wants to give us some has left up
[40:21] the communion before the people and the
[40:26] people are so scared to death
[40:30] praise Lord they are just so scared to
[40:33] death of the lateral element when it is
[40:39] Christ that's supposed to be little
[40:41] before the people praise the Lord we
[40:46] must be looking at Christ we must be
[40:48] looking at the promised Word
[40:55] so Paul was trying to prepare these
[40:57] people don't don't create images in your
[40:59] mind he turned them a chapter fold go to
[41:02] Israel he say when I came to you on the
[41:05] mountain I never took no phone don't put
[41:09] me into a shape amen
[41:13] don't put me into a shape of a beast or
[41:16] a bird or even a man don't pull me into
[41:22] the ship of William Branham No praise
[41:28] the Lord
[41:28] don't even put God in a ship of this
[41:31] photo No
[41:38] you see and I took no form by the way I
[41:41] came to you was true the world it was
[41:46] true the word praise the Lord is true
[41:53] the word we are going down to the water
[41:59] to be baptized it must be in obedience
[42:02] to the Word of God we are coming to the
[42:06] convenient to take the convenient it
[42:07] must be in obedience to the Word of God
[42:10] Lord you say this in your word and in
[42:13] obedience to your word we partake of the
[42:15] bread and the wine tonight praise the
[42:24] Lord
[42:28] we makes the work with faith and we
[42:31] approach the world with faith and we
[42:33] stand on the world with faith that's
[42:37] trying to make something up in our mind
[42:43] are we together tonight
[42:46] amen because when we adelies that you
[42:53] know and you just read God reaching
[42:56] mercy where venom comes to the end of
[42:59] his message but by making emphasis on
[43:01] that and he even says the people idolize
[43:05] every provision that God made for them
[43:09] even talk about the utter lies the I to
[43:12] men that God made the atonement of
[43:14] divine healing the house that was the
[43:16] same thing they did to the brazen seven
[43:18] what was that that was divine healing
[43:20] and that is the same thing they have
[43:22] done to brother Branham they are
[43:24] idolizing him because of the gift of
[43:26] divine healing amen
[43:33] they are idolizing the gift and whenever
[43:37] you analyze the Cape God is not in it
[43:43] amen he's not in it he leaves it
[43:54] and when God leaves it what the people
[43:57] enter with idolatry but because he said
[44:05] God that is rich in mercy he don't for
[44:08] his hands and go he moved on he makes
[44:11] another provision he will bring
[44:13] something as in a mess of the people he
[44:18] will raise up something he will either
[44:20] raise up a man or he will you know give
[44:23] the people to give a prophetess or
[44:25] somebody with vision and I sue now they
[44:31] want to get there and start analyzing
[44:32] that person he moves on there was stay
[44:36] with that they were denominated with
[44:37] that and it will die with that but a
[44:40] living God moves on and he keeps
[44:44] confirming his word praise the Lord
[44:49] so Paul was trying to tell those people
[44:55] of Corinth don't idolize the convenient
[44:59] amen
[45:00] the word is a fulfillment of the word we
[45:07] are just coming tonight to fulfill a
[45:10] portion of the word just like when we go
[45:15] to work we fulfill a portion of the
[45:17] world amen
[45:21] when we go but our daily life we
[45:25] fulfilled a portion of the word we are
[45:29] coming to fulfill the portion of the
[45:30] world tonight and I want us to keep it
[45:34] like there praise the lord the lord
[45:37] bless you tonight that just by our house
[45:39] together
[45:55] just like I said idolatry
[45:58] has been to the call of our belief
[46:02] system and right from the beginning God
[46:08] has been pulling man out of idolatry
[46:11] every time he caught a prophet every
[46:14] time he raised a man on the scene every
[46:16] time he does something man
[46:19] we idolized I think it would get away
[46:22] from God you're looking at a book of
[46:27] kings you see you see there over and
[46:29] over God would give the people great
[46:31] victory and it would dance around the
[46:34] fire and it will worship God and it
[46:36] would bring sacrifice and pretty soon
[46:38] they would turn back and start
[46:40] worshipping the idols of the heating's
[46:49] praise the Lord God might use a preacher
[46:54] to throw a light on the Word of God and
[46:58] something inspiring my struck to you and
[47:01] God will use that thing to be with
[47:03] something in your life it's not the
[47:05] preacher is the Word of God as we come
[47:09] to the communion table too now we come
[47:11] by faith we bring different ones in our
[47:14] hearts we bring different needs to the
[47:15] Lord we bring different needs to the
[47:18] Lord and interception of his word - now
[47:21] we pray for our loved ones we pray for
[47:23] our children but it's not this bread or
[47:26] this wine will do it it's because God
[47:30] has said in his word my word will never
[47:33] go out and return back back to me
[47:50] may God your sessions tonight if there
[47:53] is any form of idolatry in us we are
[47:58] idolizing anything
[48:00] we must not even idolize our witness
[48:03] because God is greater than our witness
[48:06] like Paul says it's just it just man's
[48:10] imagination there is nothing like an
[48:14] idol for we know that there is one God
[48:18] and in him we move in him we have our
[48:24] being he's our Father in his dwelling in
[48:31] our hearts
[48:37] sometimes we can adelies fear
[48:47] we can just be so afraid to trust God we
[48:53] can be so scary to take a step of faith
[48:57] and hold on to the whole onto the Word
[49:00] of God
[49:07] - me oh and no my hobby or say
