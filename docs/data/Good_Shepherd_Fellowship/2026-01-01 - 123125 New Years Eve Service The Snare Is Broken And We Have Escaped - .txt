Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. This is something we spoke on uh uh many many years back. I was looking at my note. I think it was way back maybe 2016 or so. And uh uh but I had it on my heart uh just uh just to be able to express something to you. So, like I said, uh uh might you be able to use uh uh 30 or 45 minutes just to be able to encourage our yourself tonight. And uh uh just thinking about what David said is is enough to give us a reflection. Amen. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side. Praise the Lord. Amen. And I was I was looking at that uh uh yesterday or today and then uh I was just looking through the sim uh uh how many times he expressed a similar thought as that. But uh uh [clears throat] if there is if there is one person that knows uh uh David being a shepherd boy and uh uh he knows exactly what it what it is to experience God's protection. Praise the Lord. And uh and and is uh is uh uh the experiencing of God's protection uh that we all have experienced. And that's the reason why we are here. I was I was talking with my friend and uh u my host and during the meetings we were we were just talking and and just uh uh uh expressing how God gave every mortar every mortar you know an opportunity to have a very close encounter with him. There are things that happen in our lives that we know that it had to be God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know that it had to be God. So then he was sharing this uh uh uh he was sharing this story with me and uh uh there in South Africa, a young man uh uh work uh I think he worked all through the day, but he was trying to get back to the city. So u uh uh he he thought that okay uh he he would just you know maybe get some some red and and drink some red bold and then he will be able to to uh before it wear out of his body he will be able to drive down you know and and make it over to the city. [clears throat] So as he was as he was driving you know and uh uh I mean he was he was really driving over the speeding. He was trying to hit the road and make sure that before the tireness kick into his body, he has gone farther. And he did not know when he he I mean it probably he felt he felt you know asleep or unconscious and he went right right under the trailer. &gt;&gt; He went right under the trailer. [snorts] So uh the even the driver of the trailer just fed the impact. He didn't even see when the car went on a hitch, you know. Uh uh and then they brought the the the fireman and every one of them. Uh um and then uh you know they tried to to chase the car out of from under the trailer. And when they got the vehicle, out of the trailer, the young men just jumped out of the vehicle and everybody that was there, the five men, everybody scattered, everybody started running because nobody expect anybody to live from such an impact &gt;&gt; that they all started running. They thought he was a ghost. But uh uh it is some of those close moment you know many of us might never had one in the way of an accident. uh maybe it was by uh uh sickness or uh uh one thing or another is I mean every one of us can tell our own story but uh God gave us those kind of m kind of moment in our lives where uh it it looks like it was a close call but to see that we survive it it only had to be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It only had to be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, tonight, uh, we we just want to take a little talk tonight. Like I said, the snail is broken &gt;&gt; and we have escaped. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can tell the devil that the snail is broken &gt;&gt; and we have escaped. Whatever it was, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, never got us. Amen. whatever it was never got us because the Lord was on our side. &gt;&gt; So, we want to just take a little thought on that and and why I was just back there preparing myself and and uh looking through because I I have something else I was going to talk on tonight but I realized that there is not enough time. So, uh uh instead of starting it and not finishing it, I would just go this way. And while I was there uh uh changing my my subject, this little uh thought came to my mind. This was a dream that uh uh was told uh in the message there uh work is fit express and uh then I want to read a portion of that to you and then we will go from there. Now this this is only a dream. And uh uh and I walk over this way and I seen brother Rod B a very good friend of mine uh living in California look like there's something wrong. His eyes was half closed and a great big maybe cancer or something over his eyes. Now someone was trying to pull me away from him. I stream brother Boulder in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ snap out of debt and he just barely could speak saying brother Brandham uh it it have to take something more than this. I just can't grasp it brother Brandham I just can't grab it. I said, "Oh, brother Boulder, I love him." And and and and someone pulled me away and I look and it was a lady standing over here. When I was a little boy, I used to haul grocery from the grocery store to the people and her name uh was uh Mistress uh Finton. She lived in Jeffersonville. Yet, a personal friend of uh to the wife and I. And she said, "Brother Brandon, deliver us from this." Now, she's part of the dream now. She's saying, "Deliver us from this." Said, "This is a house of hell." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe we might not have been in the house of hell, but we have gone through something that was a hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh it's is a it's a common expression when when uh when when when when uh people are going through things that is tough they said this is hell. So uh uh uh we know uh by the teaching of the word that uh that it's a dimension. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a dimension with a descending order. Like I've said before, the Bible, we see it in the book of uh Revelation is called the bottomless pit. It does not have a bottomless. It does not have a bottom. That's what is bottomless. So it's it's it's an order where the person is continuously descending whether in their life or in their mind or in their health and and whenever it's like that naturally people will says man this is hell. Praise the Lord. Amen. So uh uh uh this lady now in this dream she's telling brother Brandham this is a house of hell and said you have been mishonto and said and you mishonto these people too. Um said these are fine people. I look over there and uh uh like a great big uh uh cellar, the big a big wall down beneath a great big cave and great iron bs eight to 10 in thick and people out of their mind twisted arms and legs beating their head against death and she was crying saying deliver the people. Brother Brandon said, "Help us. We are in trouble." She herself, I know her. She belongs to I believe the church of Christ or a Christian church called the church of the brethrens. I look around and I said now now, so as as you as you as we read and you look at it, it having a kind of a a spiritual sense. Amen. Because uh uh uh as as as we'll go over to the end, you'll realize that uh the dream was concerning his ministry, the word that would come and deliver us out of this house of hell. Amen. And uh and and that was that was that was something like that. And he was looking. I looked around and I said, "I wish I could." And go on looking around my little bitty body and and and them great big iron bars and and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them. Them iron bars were sitting close together, very close together. No way to pull people out. I look and they were beating their heads like they were out of their mind. And I and I seen some light uh uh flickering around. And I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with uh a light of rainbow around him. I was looking right straight to him. I said, "Deliver those people." And he went away. And I thought, "Well, how could I deliver them?" Okay, sorry. I saw the Lord Jesus uh uh uh a lot of a rainbow around him. He was looking right straight to me and he said to brother Brandon, "Now, deliver those people." And he went away. And I thought, "Well, how could I deliver them? I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bonds." So I said, "House of hell, give away to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; And as soon as he said it, then the the the B started breaking and uh and and the people were able to come out of there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this was uh was something that was uh uh very significant to his ministry and and and also it was describing the kind of a spiritual condition of the people. And so we can we can look at that knowing that the grace of God has been able to to to deal with us and bring us you know all through the years since our our our we gave our heart to the Lord. you know uh uh the Lord has been good to us but we can also think about it in another way with uh with lot of the things that uh you know we have we have dealt with over over this year that is finishing and some of the years that has passed the Lord has been good to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh in that sense that's uh that that came to my mind. So I just I just say well let me let me search this out and and read it to you tonight. And in that sense we can look at that and say if it had not been the Lord &gt;&gt; that have been on our side &gt;&gt; we would have been in the house of hell. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will have been in the house of hell. And uh uh uh I don't know what where's your mind tonight. I don't know where's your heart tonight. And I don't know uh what uh what might be going on in your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we have a God that is able to bring us out of our house of hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No matter what what you are going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He is a deliverer. &gt;&gt; He can bring us out of our house of hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can break the snail. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can fly away like a bird. &gt;&gt; The snail is broken and we are escaped. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So uh uh just looking at that thought tonight and uh uh just like if if you look down here, you see what David said. I would I would just like to read over it a little bit again. If you have not been the Lord who was on our side, now the Israel said, if I've not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us, then they will have swollen us up quick. The last time we we we spoke a little bit about David and his men. Amen. You just have few minutes with him. Uh those guys, they were in depth in different things as we we saw in the scripture. But uh just to see how the Lord you know uh kind of delivered them. I mean you just get few men going against the army of the nation. Saul was the king. He had the army. Praise the Lord. But yet God was able to deliver David and his few men from Saul &gt;&gt; and the mighty army of Israel because the Lord was on his side. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When men rose up against us, then they will have swollen us up quick. When their rif was scandled against us, then the waters have overwhelmed us and the uh the the stream has gone over our soul. Now, so you see here also David is not only talking about the the the the the physical struggle that he have gone through. He's also talking about a spiritual condition because now he's bringing a condition of our soul into it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's looking more he's comparing our physical struggle with the condition that our soul could have been in is go if God never came on the scene to deliver us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We will have been in the house of hell. The stream will have gone over our soul. Then the proud waters have gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was the very same young man that was able to deliver a lion from the I mean a a a sheep from the mouth of a lion and also a sheep from the paws of a bed. So he know what it is uh uh uh you know when uh when uh uh an animal is caught as a prey. The animal that that that that gets that uh that little lamb as as it prey is is is it's not just playing game. It want to really feed on that animal. Praise the Lord. Amen. I mean the lion coming out to snatch one of David little lamb or the bed. It was not just to be chunking the lion in the air or the lamb in the head and playing with it. No, it came to snatch it and to to eat on it to eat it dead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when uh when an animal fought as a prey, it's it's not just a game. It's it's a life that is on the line. And David is saying here, blessed be the Lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whether it was sickness, whatever it is &gt;&gt; that could have destroyed our life, just like how you think about it, it has to be the spirit of the Lord, which of course we believe it was the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That uh that a a young boy in uh at the age that David was to be able to take a lamb from the mouth of a lion. &gt;&gt; It has to be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same God that helped David to snatch out a lamb from the from the mouth of a lion is that same God that has snatched us out &gt;&gt; from the devil that the Bible say is a rolling lion seeking womb to destroy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snail of the father. The snail is broken and we are escape. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All of the things that could that could have been a snail to us. You think about that. All of the things that could have been a snail to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the matter of fact, we were born right in a snail because the Bible says uh uh in sin our mother conceive us. &gt;&gt; So just being born in sin, we were born in a snail. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not the grace of God, I mean we could just we could just stay under that condemnation. &gt;&gt; Then you think about it also. I mean uh the way we were brought up, I mean the the the uh uh uh things that have to do with our our family, our you know our our environment and and and some of the things that was around our upbringing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh uh our whole life and and that is the thing that brought this thought of the uh uh uh house of hell to my mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our our condition was just like in the house of hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we seeing the word today. We seeing the things that is happening around us. And uh uh uh I mean uh the the the politics and and all of that that is going on. We just realize that uh you know the word is more becoming more becoming clearer as a house of hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] I'll take a little thought here uh uh uh from this message God provided away. This this is a comparison of of the eagle uh he's talking here. And the first thing uh you know he did just beat himself till his feather was was uh all out of him nearly. And he sat down like that and uh his weary eyes roll up looking around. And I thought, "Oh God, that's a heavenly bird." He saw in the heavens above and yet he is caught. Now he went over to a zoo and an eagle was put in a cage at a zoo and he's watching this bird trying to fly and every time it fly it hits uh you know the fence and then it comes back to the ground and he's uh feeling sorry that uh you know the bird is it supposed to be up there in the heavens and as I and as I and as I said that a thought just came to my mind something that uh I thought about as I because as I was traveling and I thought that I will I will I will say there maybe it will encourage somebody and uh you know uh I had a very tight trip as as I left almost missed my flight almost missed the one that will have brought me home this evening and uh uh but uh I realized uh that it is only God that can make up time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the flight delays and the pilot says, "I'm sorry, we have a delay, but we will try to make up the time." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I and as I thought about that, I realized that uh you know uh uh on uh on on on the land, you know, if you are driving or so uh because of the human trafficking, because of of of all the construction we have sometimes, you know, when you are back, you are really back. You know, you're trying to make up time, you get into the neighborhood, sometime it's worse. Sometime you're trying to get a bad pass is worse. It's completely different than when a plane is in the air. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have their own traffic. They have their, you know, their difficulties there. But it's much easier for a plane to make up time in the air &gt;&gt; than a driver that is driving down on earth or driving on land. Let me say it that way. Because the plane is also in on earth. And uh so I I just thought about that you know I was I was really thinking about it in a way that uh I mean for us just like in our in our commune we kind of a struggle you running late you know you look at your time you say man I need to be there you try to speed too much the police might pull you over. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. the police might pull you over or uh you might get somebody that will cut before you and they are driving slow and I mean you are bumping they oh my god what this guy is doing you know when you look in all your mirrors trying to cut and go and then it it gives you some some level of frustration praise the lord &gt;&gt; but it's it's uh it's it's completely different when that pilot gets up in up there I was I took a picture of the of the speed limit as the flight was going. Uh uh it says it says uh ground speed will be 600 almost 650 miles per hour. If he was driving on the ground that is how fast the plane is going. There is no car that drives like that. We don't have roads for that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and that is the reason why if for any reason a a plane lost control and hits the ground, it just explode because the speed is too much. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's going too fast. Can you imagine just going over continent? Amen. We were supposed to have about uh a 15 hours flight from Atlanta over to Johannesburg and and and uh the the the pilot was able to make it uh about uh 14 and a half hour. He have the heavens. He can go as fast as it is. And if you just compare that with our life, it's only in heavenly places that God make up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Our lost time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, and and you find that with with us as men, you know, uh uh uh you know, we we we we try to put certain things in place, you know, so we can rebuild our fan eyes, try to put certain thing in place so we can rebuild our life and uh uh uh thinking that oh well, you know, I I I wasted my time in this, I wasted my time after this, you know, I need to do this to catch up with that. But you realize that uh sometimes in doing all of that we we we we bring some sense of uh uh encouragement to ourself but it's difficult. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You realize that you you put a whole lot into it and as you are putting a lot into it, you also realize that you you you you are also putting your resources you are spending. It's not like that uh you know is giving you uh a direct return. &gt;&gt; So if you really think about it, it's only God that can be able to redeem our wasted time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only God can be able to redeem the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, just like he's saying here is that uh he thinks about this bird and is is caught uh and put in a cage. Oh, God. That's a heavenly bird. He saws in the heaven above. Yeah, he's caught. He fell into a trap. He's absolutely helpless. He can't deliver himself. His weary eyes rolled around. I felt so sorry for him. He can't help himself. And every man that fell into the snail of the devil is worse off than that bird. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you have to think about it. down is men that have caught the bird and put the bird in there for recreation. He want to create uh uh a natural place where people can come around and see why animals. You see a lion behind a fence. You see a leper. You also see an eagle. Man has created that. Praise the Lord. But he's uh he's letting us know that every man that falls into the snare of the devil is worse off than that bird &gt;&gt; because we are God's children. We are heavenly beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be a son of God. You are free brother. You got liberty in Christ Jesus. Believing God, loving God, living free from sin, living free from death. That's right. But how the devil has caught you and case you up with smoking, drinking, all kinds of immoral living and thinking you are popular. Now, now Yari said now the man that is in the snail of the devil, he actually don't feel the he don't feel the net. He don't feel the bond &gt;&gt; to him. He's free. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; His owner cage is in him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; His cage is not around him. That bird cage is around him. Praise the Lord. If he breaks, if he find a way out of that cage, he can fly away. But for man, his owner cage is in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's in his spirit. Have you ever uh thought about it? Why science refer to our genes as cells? It pretty much have the same spelling as a cell. Somebody is in a cell. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So this man that is that is that that that is made in the image of God are supposed to live as a son of God. And here said now he he's caught and he c himself up in smoking and drinking all kinds of immoral living thinking. He's popular thinking you are you are doing something. That's the most great horrible sight there is to see that poor ego beating his brain out nearly against the case trying trying to get free. And you are hopeless. You are helpless. Just as helpless as you can be unless somebody put forth a hand and open the cage. And I tell you tonight, Jesus Christ has done that. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has done that in calling you, open a cage to let you out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we can say the snail is broken. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The snail is broken. Because uh our own cage like I said is all in our spirit. It's all in our mind. I mean uh we are caged in uh uh uh worries and fear and and uh I mean we are caged in habits and and and spirits that are all within our spirit man but we can say by the grace of God the snail is broken &gt;&gt; and we have escaped. &gt;&gt; That's the joy that we have. I think that is the reason why we we want to use this time to express our gratitude to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is it is only him that could bring us out of our own our own cage. &gt;&gt; It's only him that could break those walls in our spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Paul says the middle wall of petition. He has he has led captivity captives. He has broken every spirit and we we can we can be able to express ourself back to our maker. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the snail is broken and we have escaped. &gt;&gt; Men use different thing to to snail themsel up. Like Abraham would tell us, he says, "Even even even wealth, money is a snail to them that have it and is a snail to those that don't have it." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, we can we can read all of that tonight. Uh uh and then just I just get bunch of quotes here. But that's that's not that's not the main thing I want to get to to you tonight. It's not a reading of cult. But just to realize that how God in his mercy, we would not be here tonight if it was not because of the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Just to be able to realize some of the things that God has brought us out of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of the things that we can point to and say it was the Lord that did this. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is by the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the birth that we are breathing, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If it had not been the Lord that was on our side, amen. &gt;&gt; If it had not been the Lord that was on our side, that's what I want for us to think about today. uh tonight as we as we just reflect on everything uh things that might come to our mind that we went through this year that uh that were that were that that were difficult that were hard. I mean places that we have failed, you know, uh uh uh and I mean uh we thought we could have done better and we never did. Whatever it is, but here we are tonight. Praise the Lord. Here we are tonight about to close the book of 2025. We are about to close that book. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In few minutes, this is 11:20. In in in about 40 minutes from now, we'll be in a brand new year. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And an entire year is about to close without noise. &gt;&gt; In 40 minutes from now, we will be in a brand new year. And all I want for us to do is to just reflect on how the Lord has been on our side. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's Israel say tonight, if it had not been the Lord &gt;&gt; that was on our side, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Can we be able to say that in our heart tonight? Can we be able to say that in our mind tonight? If it have not been the Lord that was on my side when this thing happened to me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, not not not trying to use this night to to to promise God because every time we promise, we fail, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But to be able to use this night to appreciate him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. that despite of our failure, his mercy &gt;&gt; has been good to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because many times people just think that that's that's what the the you know the the the the last service of the year. Oh God, uh you know, I will serve you better. And we make all of these promises, but I think it's it's time for us to just to just be able to reflect. If it had not been the Lord &gt;&gt; that has been on our side, Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe it is not something that that that just happened in 2025. Maybe the grace of God caught you couple of years back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That if God did not deliver you at that time, your 2025 will have not been what it was. &gt;&gt; Even if you thought that it was glorious, &gt;&gt; but sometime down in your in our life, he reached down his hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he got our attention. &gt;&gt; Maybe we will have been loose. We have been on the run just you know just uh uh uh uh living our life by our own by the details of our mind and the desires of our heart. But the Lord by his mercy sometime caught our attention. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For many of us uh you know that there by by his grace that have been that have been in the service of the Lord. We can we can look back to the to the day where where grace came in our path where the Lord grace came down in our path and we can still point back to that time if it had not been the Lord that was on our side. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I had not been the Lord, like I've always said uh with with with you know few that I've said about my own personal testimony. The very night I got saved was the very night that was going to be the night where I was I was going to I was going to experience being drunk. That's where that's what my friends wanted to do.
