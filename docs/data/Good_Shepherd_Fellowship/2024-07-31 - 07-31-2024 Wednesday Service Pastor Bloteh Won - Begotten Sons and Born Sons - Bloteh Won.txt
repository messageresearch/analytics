the scripture tonight and I will I will uh introduce myself 1 John Chapter 5 Verse 18 we know that whosoever is born of God sinth n but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one touch him n and we know that we are and we know that we are of God and the whole word lie in wickedness praise the Lord amen and we know that the Son of God is come that that have given us an understanding now that's that's what I want for us to that's what we want to do tonight that's what we want to understand and we know that the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding now remember now the background of the book of first second and third John John returning from the island of pmos he has experienced Jesus in another form he have experienced Jesus and there is more understanding that that has been given to him so it's some of the understanding that he's sharing with us here so he said the Son of God is come and have given us an understanding that we may know him that is truth and we are in him that is truth even in his son Jesus Christ this is the truth God in eternal life little children keep yourself from Idols amen let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we just want to thank you Lord for another Wednesday night Lord God with the clouds gathering father and the showers coming to God yet your children were able to make it through to come

another uh uh night of of Praise night of worship as we will call it like uh like we uh uh you know try to share it it's it's not a it's not a concept like uh the word will have a coner is uh it was it was set aside just for us to be able to to to Worship the Lord amen and uh and for me it was more to once again honor the gift of our brother and uh he and his wife travel back uh uh on uh on Monday but they didn't get back home until yesterday because their flight uh there was some uh clouds there in the in the Tennessee area weather so they had to sleep in North Carolina and then fly back on uh Tuesday morning but uh uh brother Le and his wife sister Louis uh really really really appreciate the fellowship amen they really appreciate the fellowship they appreciate uh uh being with

God will you know the Lord will bless bless them the Lord will bless them wonderful people that we we came to know and uh so glad now tonight remember now we've been talking about uh uh I was actually going to go back into the power behind the the the ages that's what we were talking about on uh uh last week and uh yeah you know when we get into these things and then and then we have visitors and all of that uh um you know well I'm not a good preacher so it's half sometimes it's difficult for me to just get myself back immediately but I was I was intending to do it because I had it on my mind that we will you know we will continue in this line of thought that we were dealing with trying to show the the power behind the seals now uh uh uh Revelation I mean now last Wednesday we look at Revelation chapter 4 and and it it brought us you know uh the four living creatures and which of course is the power that is influencing the church praise the lord we we established there that the four living creatures is the power that have influenced the church throughout all the ages Amen in Revelation chapter 6 we also saw the power the way Satan has moved throughout the ages look here in joy and my preach of the restoration of the Bride tree he show us the four creatures that Jo talk about the Pama W the Cana W the locers and the calipat now that was the evil power of Satan in the Old Testament is the same as the four beast in the New Testament it's just the enemy changing form brother Brandon say it was one Beast it was one creature that came from aad P to a Locus and it change again to a conquer one and you know it just changed from one to another it's just the same evil power The Same Spirit that was working in uh that's the reason why Jesus could say as it was in the days of Noah how could it be in the days of Noah because it's the same Spirit the BS are there the BS are gone but the same spirit is the Same Spirit working among the people are we together amen are we together are we together okay let's say together praise the Lord hallelujah so that's why we wanted to go into tonight and uh but as as I was as I was just trying to gather my thoughts uh uh something came to my mind that's that's something I've looked at many years ago never really been able to put it into a context to preach on it but uh it's the difference between a begotten son and a son that is born so that's what I want to talk about tonight that's what I want to talk about tonight I want to talk the difference between a begotten son and the son that is born praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we will continue to trust the Lord to be able to help us as we will be looking into uh our our will study there on U the power because what what what actually uh I'm I was I'm trying to hear to with there is to be able to show us that this is the age of fullness this is the age the Bible talks about the men of sin amen how how the devil will will he will be able to achieve to have a man where he will fully incarnate In Praise the Lord amen he will get a man God has already got his man that was Christ Jesus where he he fully DW in Christ and now he's getting a people that he will also fully DW in so we that's that's where we going with that we just we just trying to look out of that but as we study that together I want to I want to remind you I want us to keep our mind you know keep ourself in a singleness of mind and to be able to differentiate these things uh if you if you look in Revelation chapter 5 that's where the proclamation Was Made Who wed to open the book and to lose the seals thereof amen and the Bible says no man was wanted to open the book now if no man was wed to open the book but yet in here in Revelation chapter 4 we already looking in the book for us to have the understanding of the four beasts we are looking in the book think about it this book that was sealed that no man was wed to to touch take the book loose the seals thereof when the lamb came and took the book and loosed the seals when the lamb came down with the book The Lamb descended in Revelation chapter 10 and handed the book to a messenger that was on Earth but here said in Revelation chapter 6 John was called to come and see what is in the book but the book was handed down in Revelation chapter 10 so you see God place it in such a way that it will have to take a prophet to reveal right you can never read Revelation chapter after chapter and understand the sequence you can you can the book is open in in chapter 5 is handed down to the to the eff messenger in chapter 10 but yet in chapter 7 John was called to come and see what was in the book are you seeing the picture amen another thing that I want for us to also see is that uh the difference between the seal and the information of the seals what is the seal anybody what is the seal Christ Christ is the seal Jesus Christ is the seventh seal right are we together amen but when the first seal was open the angel said unto John come and see what was open now what was open was information it was information what is the Holy Ghost Christ amen was the New Birth Christ you see what is happening is there because just like it was in the beginning the devil knows how the human mind runs we love informations and it is easy to get lot of information and yet you miss the context praise the Lord amen Paul says the mystery to be revealed is Christ in you the hope of glory but we having the three stages of Grace justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost we having the new birth we having you know all all of these things are more information that God revealed to us how he's dealing with us but his primary purpose is for Christ to be revealed in you praise the Lord God is more interested in Christ being revealed in us then how much more we knows about the seals and what we know about justification and sanctification and how we can explain it you find people says well you being in the message you don't know this I rather know him because to know him is life amen to know him is life then to know all the informations and we can explain all the informations praise the Lord watch this in Revelation chapter 6 here is the information around the seal when the first horse rider came out because it was a white HSE amen amen and he came riding and conquering it was a spirit of deception because he was conquering people thought that thou was the Holy Ghost amen why because Christ was not in the picture are we together now so uh uh uh we we are hoping in trusting there by the grace of God we will we will be able to look into there I'm trying to you know trust in the Lord to be able to find uh some of the simplest way to be able to bring it to you amen so we can all enjoy it together praise the Lord praise the Lord if we make it complicated we'll be harming you then helping you so we want to make it simple but tonight just for the few minutes that is before us I want us to look at this together that uh uh John said here we know that whosoever is born of God sinth n but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself praise the Lord amen many years back way many years back uh I got attracted to this and uh uh I would say that yeah uh the Lord was dealing with me on in the sense of uh uh in a way that like I said I couldn't put it together to to preach a message out of it but uh uh well okay let's let's go ahead it's it's hard to remember what what I was thinking 12 15 years ago praise the Lord but this is what I want us to look at tonight we we want to look at something maybe maybe if I read this uh from brother Brandon it will help us uh from the fifth seal let's read from the Fifth Fifth seal it will give us a kind of a foundation year to be able to look at the subject together brother Brandon politely said uh uh in this he says excuse me again sisters being polite uh for this plain talk before young and I I think he meant older women young and older women but look when a mother is conceived and that little bunch of muscle is is twisting and jumping you understand it is a natural body and just as nature is uh performing The Natural Body did you ever notice your wife before the little one was born she's uh always right along at the last become real kind sweet if she hasn't been all of her life she will OB then did you ever notice how Sly kind of a feeling you notice a mother you see uh some sinner out there make fun of a mother that's a pregnant woman I think that's ridiculous amen he says that's life coming to the word amen she's bringing life to the word so brother B say she must not be teased she must be pray for she must be supported amen praise the Lord he said because there's Life coming but did you notice around that mother seems to be a real sweet feeling what is it it's uh a little spiritual body spiritual life waiting to come into that little body as soon as it's born now it's only begotten but when it's born it's born so while the child is in the womb the child is begotten but that's life are we together amen while the child is in the womb the child is begotten but that that is that is a living that's that's a human that's that's life amen but in the begotten State the child is is uh is is is being kept by the mother's life are you getting the picture the child is being kept by the mother's life because if you grab the picture you will see where we're going tonight because I'm I'm going to go out of there uh I will come to us so while the child is in the wom the child is been begotten now you see John said he that is begotten is what that's what the scripture say he that is begotten is kept are we together okay so let me let me go ahead and read a little bit here he said he said now it's only begotten but when is born is Born the spiritual body unites with the Natural Body and then the Bible teaches that we are are now begotten of God we are begotten of the holy spirit that is that's in US is Christ a Son of God being formed in Us Praise the Lord and when the Earthly body be dissolved this spiritual body comes from the BS of the earth there is another body waiting to receive it if this eely Tabernacle drop there is another body to receive it this Mor body puts on immortality praise the Lord hallelujah are you ready for your body change are you ready to wear immortality but until then we are in another womb the Earth is a womb we are being kept by the laws of the Earth are you get in the picture while we are here we are in the womb of the earth we are kept by the changes of weather we have been fed by the the the plants of the earth so just like a child is in the womb of the mother are we together I'm going I'm going somewhere tonight just bear with me Ecclesiastes chap 11: 5 let's read one of verse here I love 115 Ecclesiastes he says as thou know not what is the way of the spirit KN how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with ch even so thou knoweth not the works of God who maketh all amen are we together he said as as you don't know we don't know what is the weight of the spirit Jesus said it in in St John chapter 3 he said it's just like a wind you feed it and it looks like you don't know which way is going so Solomon also here now he's bringing it in in in a way for us to understand and and and and the way a child is formed in the womb just from a sea of Life bones and and tissues and nerves are built the child is in that womb the child being kept in the womb praise the Lord and all the five fingers comes out and the the you know the 10 fingers and the T toes and the nose the eyes that the child is forming being conditioned by the Lord that governs the womb are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord now like we said that is a begotten state but in that begotten state you say all this child is is is kicking all this child is restless praise the Lord amen you you don't say this think it's a child it's a life are we together you identify it as a life that is going to be born now when the child is born what was begotten is now manifested right praise the Lord amen when a child is in a begotten State you can only see it when you do utr sign are you are we together amen you are seeing it like Paul said in in Corinthian we we look Darkly as as we are looking in the glass but when the child is born what you couldn't see clearly praise the Lord when the child is born now you see it the baby is manifested the life is manifested are we together amen are we together do I need to go over it again is someone that is someone here that didn't understand me very well praise the Lord be honest I will go over it again glory be to God let's let's read uh another quot here with bringing out a little bit clearer for us question and answer there that's just my second quot of half half of this like I said I'm trying to get away from giving you too much information than just getting to the word amen so let me give you some information here praise the Lord Brother says here do you know when a baby is begotten in this earth before its deliver it got life amen when a baby is begotten in this earth before is delivered it gots life but it hasn't been delivered and just as soon as the baby comes it begin to it's born it lungs are all close up and it's there the muscles are quivering and jacking but the first thing just a little SP or two like that but B illustrating you know the baby grapping his birth Cas cash his birth what's the matter as soon as that natural body is being formed in the mother there is a spiritual body waiting to receive it just as soon as that baby is born praise the Lord hallelujah so John year now he says this that uh he says in verse 20 we know that the the Son of God has come and have given us an understanding and is is is that understanding that we want to look into tonight because you see uh uh saints of God this is this word that we give us rapturing Fai amen praise the Lord and rapturing faith will come when we begin to understand how God is dealing with us when we begin to understand that God is the one that is in control praise the Lord there was something uh brother Jordan said when he was praying on on on Sunday and it St to my mind you know brother brother Tim G gave a very beautiful you know illustration on uh our trials and you know when when uh you know when the father is teaching us you know he he talks but when we are going through test you know he don't talk because it's testing time amen praise the Lord so if if it looks like God is not talking to us we might be going through test if it looks like the Lord is not answering your prayer it might be a test amen praise the Lord but the beautiful thing there is that brother Jordan said he don't leave the room the examiner don't leave the room even though he's not talking but he's in the room he's watching over you praise the Lord amen now so the thing here is that U uh uh uh we have to understand how God is dealing with us praise the lord we want to put his work back into his hands and begin to start appreciating what he's doing then to think that we have something to do are we together praise the Lord hallelujah amen in the message of Christ is the Myster of God revealed if you study the message you will also see brother Brown talks about two wombs he talk about the womb of our mind and the womb of our soul praise the Lord he says we first re receive the word in our mental conception in the womb of our mind and when that word becomes a revelation then it drops down in the womb of our heart then the word will live itself out if it does not become a revelation it will just be an intellectual Faith you will just be guessing and missing and you know and thinking this and thinking that but when the word becomes a revelation then it drops down and the word is now ready to live itself out through you praise the Lord let's get back to our subject John says he that is born of God sinth not praise the Lord amen that is a place and uh uh I'm I'm I'm getting excited amen I'm enjoying myself here praise the Lord Lord maybe you will catch up to but I'm enjoying myself let's let's just look at this together we can we can look through through the scripture I might be able to go through here quickly and and then just just read couple of the scriptures to you you know that will that will uh that will bring this thing out uh for us hallelujah love the Lord amen now if you look at the word begotten if you follow the the the English definition we're not speaking English yet we speaking the word amen oh yeah it's a word that is used greatly but for God so loved the word that he gave us his only begotten son praise the Lord that word is used all through the scripture referring to the Lord Jesus and there are places where also the Bible use it refer to us that God has begotten us what does the word means that's what we want to look at for us to be able to appreciate the subject tonight so that begotten you know uh uh uh it have it have a it have a meaning in the in the Greek is a word that that uh uh that is called uh monogen if I'm pronouncing it right but what it means it means that the only one of its kind praise the Lord the only one of its kind when you have something that is very unique A Unique Kind let's let's uh let's let's look at it in the scripture that we will be able to appreciate look in the Book of Revelation Revelation 1:5 the Bible says and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and their first begotten from the dead praise the Lord okay what makes it beautiful yet Jesus was not the first one that was raised from the dead was he the first one raised from the dead no he was not the first one in the Old Testament the man that he throw into Elijah grave he came back to life Elijah lay over the dead boy he came back to life Jesus was not the first one he he was the one that raised Lazarus back to life before he he even died but he became the first begotten which means the first one that came back to life that never had to die again praise the Lord amen I'm sure the man that they threw into Elijah grave he he he woke up his family was happy after s year he died again the boy that Elijah woke up he grew up to be a big he died also Lazarus have to die the second time but Jesus be he he became the first begotten from the dead that he came back to life and he never had to die again praise the Lord amen you see the Bible is is very beautiful the Bible can never attribute the first uh uh uh uh translated to Jesus because he was not Enoch was the first one amen praise the Lord Elijah was the second one but Jesus was the first begotten from the dead so which mean when he came back to life his case was unique so the word in the Bible that speaks of a begotten son it speaks of the term of being unique amen it speaks of the sense of ab would th prepare me so Jesus was a begotten son because he was not born of sex amen he was now born of a sinful nature he was begotten because his body was separated that God could step in it are you getting the picture amen hallelujah so you you have to understand the sense of begotten you are begotten because in this age God has chosen you to be his bride you are choosing you are set aside for a special purpose not just to be a church member amen praise the Lord you are begotten because God has chosen you to have a preeminence a people that he will have a preeminence a people that will put God first that's what this bride would be praise the Lord amen so that is the sense of the world begotten you are choosing for the purpose you have been called out are we together Hallelujah but when we look at when we look at it in a sense as we compare it to the place of the mother just like brother brandham said the child is begotten in the womb now you will realize in h understand that uh uh uh you know it's it's it's uh you you see this there are people uh uh uh take for example a man like FF Bosworth he was he was an evangelist on the field and uh you know he had preach and he have even retired but when he saw the the the the man estation or of the of the son of man Ministry in brother Brandon he came off of the field he got back into evangelism why God beg gotted him amen praise the Lord and I hear it said now this man that has been preaching many years is now going to sit down honor this young evangelist and and start learning what God is doing we have read it in the Bible praise the Lord the gift of discernment and Jesus talking to the woman at the word and telling her all the things that he have done here is the thing manifesting even though he prayed for the sake he was a preacher but yet he he's now being begotten he's now in a womb he's now becoming a baby to start learning again to grow in understanding praise the Lord you see that's the reason why no matter what experience a person have and and and and you know and and and what they will learning and in all of that when God gave a Grace for the man to come to the knowledge of Christ he's just like a baby that is beginning to form praise the Lord amen we are all every one of us we are all work in progress if you really want to look at the S we all have been begotten by the message and now we are in the womb of the message we are now growing and and and and the members of our body are growing praise the Lord when we come to maturity when we are born then that's when we become manifested Sons and Daughters of God just like the child that is born is no longer feeding on the mother's life amen even though that child has to suck the mother's breast but the child is not connected by an umbilical cord when a child is in the womb it's not sucking breast it's being failed directly praise the Lord are we together amen I'm bringing you to somewhere tonight and I'm I'm hoping that uh you know the grace of God will be able to to help us to grab it because because we get to this place where you know we think our many years in the message uh uh uh uh sometimes we we we we Knack ourself on the head and and say Sir well I should have known this praise the Lord and sometimes say you know what you know we we we we we we blame our husband we blame our wives and you know we we we we throw things around it's all because of our human expectation but let's look at it in the eyes of God Amen look at in the mind of God that baby that is in the womb it is it is the mother praise the Lord is the parents that are having expectation of the time that the child will be born the child that is in the womb is just is just flooring on the life that is being transmitted to the child praise the Lord all the child might have some spiritual m in the womb and kick you know here and there and say oh you you you feed the life and sometimes that's what happen when the church has a Revival and the people are rejoicing God feed the life that my children are coming to life the word is having effect in them but that does not means that we are to full manifestation praise the Lord Brother Braham says it's just like the little chick if you try to crack the egg you will kill that chick that chick has to grow and from in it starts to find its way out and that is the same way with the believer from in we will find our way out that sea word that is within us we find its way out it will bring this body to sub gestion it's now we it's now we manufacturing things and we said to this one well if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's why you are doing that you need to be born again and we get all fussy and and you know uh uh uh when when when things don't go the way we we we thought it should go we are so easy to throw words at one another praise the Lord amen are you seeing the picture tonight I hope the holy spirit will make it more clearer to you amen look at this example John the Baptist received the Holy Ghost while he was begotten amen praise the Lord but he was not born yet but yet he got a supernatural experience when the name of Jesus was mentioned the first time John live for Joy he got a supernatural experience but yet he was not born you see that's that is what is happening to people and and and that is the thing that is causing some of the disappointment that we we we are feeling because a person has been in the message 40 years 20 years and you know they pray for the sick or they been preaching the message and this I mean you are stay in the womb you are stay in the womb of the word God is waiting for your for the four member of your body to come together your understanding your discipline he's waiting for all of those things to come together and then you will be born and then there will be a short manifestation of the TPO and the bride will be taken away Lord praise the Lord you should be oh where is the manifestation the the the manifestation of the temple the manifestation of the temple praise the Lord are we together it's almost like brother Braham says that child you know in the womb enjoy the comfort of the womb and it looks like that is the best place to be but when a child is born it have no desire to go back in that small space is enjoying is enjoying a complete Liberty it can run to St Cloud and go down to Miko and run everywhere but while it was in the womb it was so confined you see that's legal Laing legalizing is a small space we can't do this our church say we can't do this our church in the Mage we can't do this your space is too small wait until you grow praise the Lord wait until you grow and when you are birth as a child you realize there is so much Liberty in this message Hallelujah then what you think is bonish oh the message just keep us in bonish it's because in the womb your space is too small that's why you think there is bonish praise the Lord amen but when a son is manifested you have you have so much Liberty you don't have to look around your shoulder you know who you are you know where you standing you are not living to please people your influence is not coming from on Facebook or Hollywood your influence is coming from the revealed word that's right brother bam says you are honor the Son and the son is beginning to re in you you are more concerned about what the scripture says what the message says about this that's that's that's a that's a son that is born because Jesus said I can do nothing but what the father shows me he was a son that was born amen he was begotten for that purpose and he was birthed to manifest the purpose are we together some people stay in a womb for 40 years and they never get the chance to be Birth s to say they die in stay breath because they never came to manifestation I was born in the message I've been in the message 20 years I've been in the message they were just in the womb are we together are you seeing the thought that I'm bringing praise the Lord because John is saying here the new birth comes open to us it comes in a different way praise the Lord Brother bam says in his Hills God birth he birthed his children by the word amen you know how Satan birth his children by the church who was the one to bring forth the first child of God Eve the woman she's the type of the church when God was bringing his son he brought him some by himself he said let's make men in in our image and the Bible said God make Men In His Image but when the devil wanted to bring his child he had to go through the woman and that is the same thing God is birthing his children by the word and the devil is birthing his children by the church does that blow your mind it confuse you no it should not confuse you it shouldn't confuse you praise the Lord it shouldn't confuse you because we have been birthed by the unadulterated word The Incorruptible seed which is the word of God that's what is bringing us forth are we together that's what is bringing us forth that's why we are here it's not just to be identified with a church or with a system praise the Lord so when you get oh this guy was in the message you were preaching the message all of these years you say I can believe it how people can do you should be able to believe it it's not every child that was in the womb that make it to life praise the Lord just like we all are in the womb of the earth not every human that is in the womb of the earth will be birthed onto the Golden Shores of Heaven they are gaining from the same Sun that we are gaining from drinking the same water the same air we all breathing it but when this F give birth is in birth pain right now when a give birth some will not make it on the Golden Shores are you getting the picture praise the Lord are we together so you see this it's it's just not enough for us to say we are in the message I was baptized in Jesus name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ sometimes you say I will baptize in Jesus name people say no no say in the name of the Lord we we get so caught up in those informations is that it's hard for us to to bring forth Christ we're supposed to be bringing forth Christ and information are you seeing the picture praise the Lord by the word by the spoken word we have been conceived we have been captured we have been drawn to this place the word has got our attention it's just like that little child in the womb who is becoming to starting to become sensitive of the environment around science tells us that even while the child is in the warm they can sense our environment praise the Lord amen when the child is in in a musical place it give them a kind of for relaxing when when a child is in a place where they are all fing fing fing fing that child becomes sensitive to death now I'm not taking your I'm not taking your new birth away from you tonight I'm not saying that you're not born again I'm trying to bring it in a more Progressive sense because just like how we were born conceived in a womb and born in the natural life we are conceived spiritually and we will be born in a new body we are conceived in the earth and we will be born into heaven so you see that's that's the reason why you you I mean that's the reason why you you need to appreciate what where the grace of God is having you and how the grace of God is dealing with you praise the Lord because you cannot expect the child that is in the womb to be running around like the child that is already birth that's the reason why Paul says them that compare themselves with one another are not wise praise the Lord when the Bible speaks about sons that are born the Bible is talking about manifest a of the sons of God that's why John spoke right there for this reason the Son of God came to manifest destroy the works of the devil and manifest God that's the purpose that's the purpose we are here for but we can't do it if we are not birth yet we are stay in the womb is the atmosphere of the world that is keeping us and we need to grow in that atmosphere we need to grow we need to appreciate it stop building false expectations praise the Lord just like the way John experienced the holy ghost in the womb in our state of being begotten we still experience the Holy Ghost we experience the manifestation of the word I mean we are touched by this we have this experience we have that experience but you see you cannot build on experience Mary called the name of of of Jesus John was moved he did not born he was not birthed immediately he still had to go through full term with all your our experiences with still need to grow up we still need to grow up because there is a manifestation there's a birth that is awaiting Us Praise the Lord there is a birth that is awaiting us you think when that child is born and that baby is crying she care for who's the doctor whether they are looking at me they you know who looking at me who is listening to me that child that is born when they are crying they don't care for who is around them that's a sense of manifestation when people become so conscious and you know and no you you are still in the womb your space is too small praise the Lord you I sure you never expected it like this tonight say something completely different praise the Lord oh yeah we all need growing up to do manifestation of the sons of God is not just imagination it's not imagination the word has to possess this body now you trying to control it the word must possess this body praise the Lord and that's the reason why when you when you feel angry bring it under the word when you think stupid bring it under the word when you say foolish bring it under the word because the word has not possessed the body yet because as long as the devil keep us in a wrong thought that we are in the manifestation of God by this time I supposed to be doing this I supposed to be doing that and you realize if you Earnest to yourself you are not doing it if you are really Earnest to yourself you are not doing it you saying where where am I oh my God I can't believe oh my my spiritual life oh my sh praise the Lord praise the Lord look at our lord Jesus he was a manifested son he was a manifested son he went down there he knew that woman was an elfing woman he didn't care what the disciples were say because he knew he was there for a purpose he knew he was there to fulfill the will of the father when you are so judgmental of people around you your space is too small you are in the womb don't get mad with yourself just tell yourself I need to grow up I need to grow up he even went to hell hell couldn't change him why because he was a manifested Son of God he manifested himself in on Earth he manifested himself in Hell praise the Lord when the Sons and Daughters of God will be Sons and Daughters of God not only in church we will be Sons and Daughters of God when we are at work we will be something when we are in a grocery store praise the lord we carry the mercy Throne of God everywhere not being judgmental and condemning see that one look that see see see see see your space is too small you stay in the womb you need a growing up to do we need to grow up we need to grow up in understanding praise the Lord job did not understand everything that was happening to him but there was one thing one thing he heard to that no matter what is happening he said I will not drag my Integrity down I keep myself as a Son of God I don't I'm not I'm not understanding all of these things that is happening but he knew that it's not because of sin that I'm going through this thing he had that understanding that no y'all can say I'm a secret sinner I don't believe it I can't argue with God but I know my life that was a manifested son that was a son that was born in the midst of Trials what are we talking tonight St John chapter 3 when Jesus Christ defined the new birth what did he said it the son of man that is on Earth and that is even in heaven praise the Lord he brought an understanding of a dual nature that we have while we are on earth we go through our Earthly Cycles our Earthly life our Earthly uh businesses our spirit is in Heavenly places praise the Lord our spirit our mind is in Heavenly places so he make us to see it and understand it is not this thing where you're just going to be oh you're going to be spiritual I mean you will just be floating over the world no evil thought will come to your mind oh my God has delivered me oh yeah the Lord has delivered me praise the lord it's just 5 minutes the devil is waiting for you when you go through that door praise the Lord oh it was a powerful service tonight praise the Lord come glory to God we give oh yeah let's give the Lord a hand of Praise we clap for the Lord Jesus you enjoy the word yet the devil is waiting for you right out there praise the Lord but I said manifest the Son of God when you step out there and he says anything to you you know exactly when the devil is speaking praise the Lord he's not going to robed me of my joy the Bible say Jesus was tempted in every way every way but because he was a manifested Son of God he knew his purpose he knew why he was here and the Bible say he learned obedience by the many things that he suffer praise the Lord it's not one week we are on fire for God and another week we throw oursel under the bus praise the Lord if God don't come to my rescue I'm going to hell oh God I need your help are you seeing the picture amen we are in this SP spiritual womb of the word and that's why we need the nourishment we need to be feeding on the word for us to grow for us to grow in God and then we going to we're going to be birthed into our places we're going to be birthed into our position we're going to be birthed into our gifts praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen praise the lord it's after nine year have to find a place here to stop but I mean there just there just bunch of uh uh wonderful scriptures here I thought I was going to go through them Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again onto a lifely hope according to his AB burant Mery once again he has begotten us praise the Lord onto a lifely hope if that child in the womb can grow into understanding to realize that there is a better life out of this place praise the Lord amen they can hear the sound when they that that full age and seven eight nine months they can hear sounds I went to a shop one time uh uh uh my wife and myself and we're talking to this lady I think she's from South Korea and all of there there uh we looking for or I think uh iron was suspecting at time we're looking for uh maternity to close and and you know and she was talking about how her her her I think her niece back home started reading English book to the baby in the womb every evening she would take a story book and read and when that child was born it was not difficult for the child to start speaking English just listening to a testimony of another musician that every evening he'll play a song for for for the little baby in the womb and when the child was was born every time he plays on the piano that little baby tend to look why because the sound is familiar the sign had an influence now the baby can recognize oh I see and that's what happened to the believer when the word comes open you say oh I can see now I see why praise the Lord looks like I'm speaking a foreign language tonight but that's okay amen praise the Lord I'm sure that the Lord will give us understanding amen praise the lord it's more birthing that we need to do more growing up we need to do because the promise of the manifestation of the sons of God will surely come to pass we are right in it you know we are right in it but we don't need to manufacture it no we need to grow up to it we need to grow up to it we need to bring our understanding it's not something we work out no is the word living itself through Us Praise the Lord is the word living itself through us look look at even our lord Jesus right at the point of death he couldn't get a hold of it he said no Lord not my will but your will let the word bring me subject because I was born for this purpose let the word get a hold of me death is looking scary but Lord get a hold of me let the word subject me let the word take the fear of death let the word he keep submitting himself keep submitting himself because he was born for that purpose and that's what Sons and Daughters of God do that's how we deal with our problems not by talking it all over the place and building Superstition and building all sorts of h h h fake story no you submit yourself to the word Lord I don't understand this identify this thing in my life I'm not happy with it I'm not happy with it I know it's not supposed to be so it's not according to your word it's somebody that is in control it's someone that is in control it's someone that is submitting something to the father not looking for who to blame well this thing is in our family this thing is in our family my my man say my P say is in our family is in our family that's the reason why you need to be born again because you need to get out of that family and be and and and be conceived in the womb of the word and then grow up and then you be born into a a Son of God we be Earnest to ourself very Earnest to ourself we realize that there are area many areas in our life that we need to grow up praise the Lord that we need to grow up and the only way we can grow up is by subjecting ourself amen I heard a story the last time uh reading to a book or listening to a book there and and uh this uh uh uh CEO came to see this new building that they were building uh uh you know for his company and uh it was about a kind of a certain amount of story building more than 10 12 and up there you know and on the top they were supposed to do something special so uh while they were building you know he wanted to get on the top and see what they were how they were designing the top and all of that and then he kept going up the stairs you know he kept going up the stairs and trying to get to the top and then the guy called him and says no come down and then he came down and then pointed him to the elevator and it went up easily the Way Up Is Down praise the Lord the Way Up Is Down if he will have tried I don't think he would make it to that 20 floor claiming those stairs and many times that's what we trying to do that's what we're trying to do but when he came down got in the elevator he was up amen he that humble himself will be exalted the Lord bless you tonight musicians you can come go home sleep on the word amen we are sleep on the word meditate upon the word amen look we must enjoy this word amen this is uh it's not yet to to to scare you or to beat you down and he says well I think I was mature now the preacher say I'm not mature anymore no that's not what I'm saying praise the Lord I'm saying God is about to to give birth he's about to give birth to Sons and Daughters of God Amen but we need to come to full term we need to grow up the Bible say he that is begotten is kept it's kept in the presence of God it's kept under the word of God it's kept under the anointing of the Holy Ghost but B say we are begotten by the Holy Ghost it's keeping us and training us and teaching us to understand that it is God it is God it is he that is that to will to deal with us is he the one he's the one dealing with us there's nothing that we are going through there's nothing we dealing with mentally internally that God cannot bring under control take it off your hands give it to God and give it to him give it to him because you want to give it to him don't just give it to him and then take it from him the next few minute no give it to him say Lord I want to grow Above This I realized this in my life I want to grow above [Music] this we all need a growing to do let's go to the Lord in prayer [Music] [Music] tonight let's sing that to the Lord now s search me oh God and know my heart today try

start to understand there and start to identify that we need to grow and realize that we are in the warm of the word we get from this place of always trying to justify ourself when you are justifying yourself is because you are afraid it's a sense of fear when you cannot quickly see that oh yeah it's trueth I'm sorry I rais my hands I'm sorry raising your hands is a sign of Freedom it's a sign of
