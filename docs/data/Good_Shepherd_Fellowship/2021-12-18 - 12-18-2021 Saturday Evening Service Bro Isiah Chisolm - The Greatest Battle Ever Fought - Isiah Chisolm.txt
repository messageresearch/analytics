presence of the one that we love amen just like paul said as we see the day closer we see our redemption drawing night let us now forsake the resembling of one another and the one that we need most is him praise the lord because we can have everyone together without his presence brother branham says just a dear cops that is dressed up ready to be buried so we want him to be to come in and honor our praise tonight we want him to come in and honor our worship the sacrifice of being here tonight the sacrifice of having brother isaiah flying from north carolina over to minnesota leaving his family and we want to greet his wife that is following the service tonight and then also uh all the saints that are now able to make it that are following the service we want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus our invisible audience invisible audience is good to be in the house of the lord praise the lord we pray that the lord will just give us a special touch tonight amen once more he will give us just a special touch tonight amen and it's good to have brother chasing with us it's been perceived as that seven years yeah i think he's been close to that maybe since he was here the last time praise the lord and but it's good to have our brother come and come and spend this weekend with us and we pray that the lord will be able to use him as a vessel to be able to speak to us something that would draw us closer to the presence of the lord amen amen that's that's what each and every one of us need we know because of the storm wednesday night we couldn't gather together and i mean the lord knew we would not be wednesday night so he make a provision for the saturday night service praise the lord so we just thank the lord amen we thank the lord and he's he's very mindful of us very very mindful of us praise the lord and [Music] good to see sister patient back there thank god for his touch on our sister life and [Music] i know i had something on my mind i wanted to share with you i was talking with brother jbs kameta from from nigeria he has been here a few times and preached for us and [Music] i think that was uh last week of zoe had a very [Music] strange experience that also turned out to be a wonderful experience i was talking with him in the week and uh there there have been a lot of uh kidnapping now now back in in nigeria this this will be the second minister in the message that have gone through that uh the first one uh uh spent a lot of plays and and and those guys who you know were keeping up these preachers and asked for ransom you know asked for money and uh and he had that experience he went back to to visit uh a little work that he was doing and you know and he got kidnapped by these guys but the thing about it there is that he said you know they drove him around for so many hours in a day but he had his his music playing in the vehicle and i think pretty soon they came to realize that he was a preacher so uh and he said he was just sitting in the back of the vehicle thinking uh you know my law delivered down here you know my law will deliver me you know and while those guys drove him around on their operation they were yeah i mean they were carrying on some horrible things but yet they had a preacher with with them praise the lord amen and then at the end of the day one of them spoke up and said let's let's not do anything to this man you know he's a preacher let's let's let him go you know and then he he drove back home almost late in the night almost about 1 00 am 2 a.m they let him go so we just thank the lord for that praise the lord amen and you know i mean god's people going through different things i think yeah cesare also shared with me and those brothers uh uh in china that were in prison uh they also have been free from praising so we want to thank the lord for that you know it's a tough time you know that we are living in but it's also a glorious time you know because he promised that he would never leave us he would never forsake us and and i think we are living in a time where you know uh the presence of god is is ever so near amen is ever so near and we can call him on the scene and he will be the writing time praise the lord amen let's just stand on our feet tonight [Music] and now we will call the preacher of the night brother brother chester he will come and he will bring us the word tonight amen praise the lord we just pray that god will meet us at the very point of our needs tonight amen let's think tonight we are together again just praising the lord while our

jesus christ amen those that have your bible amen praise the lord amen appreciate the lord appreciate his present here tonight amen amen what the spirit of the lord is there is liberty well uh the way i feel tonight i'm going to go ahead and tell you the devil is in trouble hallelujah he's in trouble amen amen the bride is having a revival hallelujah it's a word revival and it's an individual affair that's why we appreciate the lord amen genesee amen to see chapter we know there's two books in particular that satan hates we know it's genesee genesis is a c chapter that shows the beginning it shows what has been placed in the earth amen and revelation he hates revelation because revelation shows his end amen shows that he and the false prophet will be thrown into the lake of fire you ought to be happy about that tonight knowing that that old devil will be bound and thrown into the lake of fire we love the lord genesee amen in the second chapter and we agree uh two verses by the help of the lord then we go to revelation 2. you have it by saying amen amen amen again we thank god for being here we bring you greetings from uh north carolina pastor giulifoni a little small assembly there amen shalom tabernacle and and we bring our love tonight my wife greet all the saints amen pray for us tonight genesis 2 and verse 15 and it reads and the lord god commanded the man sin of every tree of the garden thou mays freely eat in other words there's no limitation but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil that shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die if that's right now let's go to revelation the second chapter revelation 2 and verse 7 and it reads he that has an ear how many thank god you got to ear tonight let him hear and we know we have to be predestinated to hear the prophet god says it's impossible for all to hear amen amen i'm not talking about the ear on the side of your face but you have a heart to hear tonight he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of paradise of god amen let us buy our heads father we thank you lord jesus for the reading of your word now sanctified to our soul this reacts in jesus name church amen amen you may be see pardon me amen thank you lord tonight uh i'm go ahead and take this off amen praise the lord god is good and he's good all the time amen oh my i feel wonderful tonight it's good when you could come to church and when you enter the threshold and you can feel the presence of the lord it's it's wonderful you ought to be happy tonight to know that the lord is with us amen and he's keeping us amen a little thought tonight by the grace of god a reward amen a promise reward a promised reward and we look at the word a reward is a thing that's that a thing that give recognition of one service effort or achievement so the promise was only given to overcomers you find in the bible that god made promise amen amen to every age and listen at some of the promise he promised the eat of the tree of life he promised that they will not be heard of the second death he promised to eat of the hidden manna and i would give you the white stone at a new name he give us he promised power over nations he promised uh we shall be closed in white remnant and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but will confess his name before my father and before his angel and he goes on to say and i will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwelleth upon the earth and we found out amen that the god that we serve tonight i'm happy to know that god is not a man that he shall lie amen can somebody say amen neither is he the son of man amen that he shall repent amen i believe it was balaam uh uh that told baylike look god is not a man that he is your life amen and when god make promise god is obligated to keep his promise and you're happy about it tonight to him that overcometh revelation two and seven to him that overcometh what i get to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of paradise of god this is a future reward to all overcomers of all ages when the last call the battle has sounded and our armor has been laid down then we arrest in paradise of god and our portion shall be the tree of life forever that's beautiful tonight yes you know i i i think of what is talking about god make all these promises to him that overcometh uh i will grant to sit with me in my throne you know we all desire to lord let me be an overcomer i desire to be an overcomer he that overcometh will eat of the hidden man god can't lie god made a promise he that overcometh will you know he made all these promises so god is obligated to keep all of his promise but it reminds me of you know when god make his promise a lot of time you know matthew i think the seventh chapter and verse 20 something like that the bible let us know that there there's going to be many that we're going to come we'll come up to him in that day and so lord did not we cast out devils did not we did many mighty works we we we we did this and we did that yeah and somebody said lord out i was paid for the church and i did this and lord i i paid my tithes and and all this but he going to say i never knew you depart from me your workers of iniquity and it's good to know the promise that god would make amen to us and it reminds me of one that is buying a home or you're buying an automobile and and you know i i could see this family you know perching sitting down uh signing the contract to to get this new home you're so happy and sometimes you so happy until you don't even realize hey man the small prince oh then you know you so happy to have this two-story house this house on the hill you know beside the lakes and little ducks you're just looking at uh the floor plan you're not really looking at the fine prints and that's the way it is a lot of people that said i'm going in the rapture but the rapture is only given to the overcomers he that overcomes that's right and first of all you in order to sit with him you have to overcome that's right and a lot of people will be disappointed you know and they would buy this home and not realizing in small prints you know with this home or will the mortgage be met when i'm sick or uh what have you or i'm out of work will will this mortgage continue to be paid well they don't read all that they just signed the contract and that's the way there's a lot of people where they come amen they grab hold to this gospel ply and they they're out in the hot field and the trials and the temptations come you gotta say lord i'm still with really to go all the way amen amen and i thank god tonight amen he that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne and we know that the prophet said that a throne amen it rules and you rang your throne is over domain that's right he that overcometh what i grant to sit with me not on my throne but in my throne i don't know about you tonight but i got a seat on the other side i just can't wait to get at that wedding sup amen praise the lord god almighty i feel the presence of the lord here tonight amen a promise reward and god made a promise i heard when apostle peter said that god is not slack concerning his promises as some men do count slack amen god don't change i don't care how situation may look god don't change amen you may fail but god doesn't change amen if god ever make a promise he's able to obligate to keep his promise i i reminded of this young boy met this beautiful girl beautiful young lady and he fell in love with her and he made all those promises to her and you know his name perhaps johnny oh you know johnny here tonight amen and and she made and he made all those promises and i'll do this and i you know i i work hard for you and i i buy that fine home and i get that nice card for you and i do this and that in the third and and i will let nothing come between you and i i'll i will be faithful he making a promise that's a man making promise that's right and he made all those promises to this beautiful girl he just sitting there and just looking at her beautiful dull eyes and he's just saying being hypnotized i'll do all this for you all this for you and all of a sudden daddy walking through the house and time is getting late and all of a sudden father go and she said johnny it's time for you to go he said i promise he said i promise i'll be faithful he said i promise i'll always be with you and so he began to leave and say he said i'll be back he said i promise i'll come back tomorrow if it don't rain [Music] now he just made a promise he won't let nothing stop him but now he's letting rain stop him and i'm afraid in this christian journey we we make all these promises but i thank god god is not basing amen his work on my promise can god know that i'm filled with faults and failure but he's basing it on what he did at calvary hallelujah glory to god hallelujah how many love the lord tonight and and god made these promises amen and the tree of life the prophet of god said isn't that a beautiful figure of speech it is mentioned three times in the book of genesis and three times in the book of revelation all six places is the same tree symbolizing exactly the same thing now in the garden there were two trees are y'all hearing me amen there was two trees now there was other trees but there's two trees in particular standing in the midst of it one was a tree of life and the other was a tree of knowledge good and evil man was to live by the tree of life but he was not to touch the other tree or he would die but man did partake of the other tree and when he did death entered into him by his sin and he became separated from god now i would like to demonstrate something tonight you know picture is a thousand words but the one would it be okay here because i don't want to damage the flower can i just can i put it over here i want to use these two objects tonight by the grace of god and and if you spiritually pretty much know where i'm going i want the deal tonight in the garden there was two trees and god uh commanded his children not which treats to eat of that's right now i want you to realize that when when god made man he put adam in the garden what was the purpose he put adam in the garden to address it and substitute it and there was to bring forth our children and we know it was not by the wound of a body but it was by the wound of his mouth because that she wants to speak children into existence that's right well the bible let us know that there was two trees in the garden and god told them now look the tree of knowledge of good and evil y'all help me out oh blue i love blue so you blue blue's my favorite color amen amen and the tree of life and the tree of knowledge good and evil now i want you to realize that when he told them uh not to eat of that tree of knowledge good and evil the day you eat the earth or the day you partake of that tree what you shall what surely die amen yeah you're gonna die so those two trees it's in the garden so i don't want you to realize this now adam and and and his wife they they were now you know first of all genesis 1 that adam was made in the very image of god right god is a spirit that's right so adam was in the image of god genesis 2 god put man to sleep made man from the dust of the ground so i want you to realize that the two trees in the garden and god sought his dear children in the garden and he signed them up on a free more age where they can make a choice he gave them a mind to thank they could make a choice of glory to god amen glory to god god want them to have the right to choose evil good well it taught him out in the garden and and and adam and his wife was in the garden and i want you to realize that the the tree of life brother brown let us know that the tree of life jesus said i am the tree of life he talked about he was the one that walked in the midst of paradise that's right i am the bread but he talked about the tree of evil that's right well now we know the two trees in the garden now they was to eat up that tree and live and have eternal life oh glory to god how many you realize that those trees two trees are here today now uh pastor do you have that up there yes can you put it up now praise the lord and i want you to realize that adam and his wife they they was made of 16 elements of the earth if that's right i know you know those things but it's good to remind us sometimes it was made of what light petroleum potash iron clay 16 elements of the earth right and and and when god made them and the first thing when god made paul talk about it in thessalonian i think four or five and he talked about the body the spirit and the soul so we realized that when god made man the first thing god made was a soul that's right and from the soul god made what a spirit then god makes a body and the bible let us know that man became a living soul that's right tonight so when god made man he gave man a choice amen just like we have a choice tonight you know if lord i'm going to do better you got a choice yeah uh the the way i come in i i'm i'm going back different i i'm i'm i'm going to live a better life i got a choice that's right that's right i i i'm going to be come this this year i'm not going away a lot of people believe in turning over new leaves resolution and they find out next year to do the same thing i ain't going to wait till the first year i want to do it tonight lord change me lord i got some attitude that i need to be worked on i know i can't go like this the lord changed me you got a choice you got a choice you could eat of the tree of life and live or you could reasoning with the tree of knowledge good and evil somebody say amen well when god made man and they made the woman and we know and now i want you to realize that uh they're in the garden this serpent brother brandon talk about this serpent now one thing about satan when he he works on us and he studies us he's trying he studies your weak point lord knows don't we have them huh and and the devil studies your weak points so you know uh i'm sure that uh uh uh satan knew that he couldn't overthrow adam so he had to get the byproduct that's right so he began to study this woman and he began to talk y'all don't let the devil talk to you now i'm not just talking about physical natural woman but we are the bride of jesus christ that's right are you with me so when you see a woman you talk about the church we are the church we are the call out we are the elected lady we're going into rapture and that's right and praise god so here's satan amen hear this beast walking in the garden brother browner talk about he was just as harmless as he could be walking through the garden just minding his business just walking through the garden the bible let us know that the serpent genesis 3 i think the bible said that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field here here's this suffering just walking through the garden you know just walking this just walking that's all you're doing just walking and all of a sudden lucifer he he lost in heaven how many know he been kicked out micah kick it kick him out of heaven and that's what we need to do sometimes kick him out so lucifer come down on earth and jesus told his disciples i beheld him as light and fall from heaven i saw him when he hit the ground so he's walking on the earth now he's trying to figure out how can i get into the human race how can i stop man he saw out of moving things around and he wanted to interrupt that so here's this woman in the garden walking and you know she had she could move things too yeah ma can you imagine can you imagine she's looking with adam and she said you know i want those flowers over there i don't think she got to say flower over there she had it she had a spoken word amen but we are word made flesh see we we have the same you have the same ability glory to god it's not coming it has been restored glory to god man i i i'm speaking to believers here tonight now i i know i'm not just speaking to anybody i'm speaking to those that come from the very mind of god and i'm speaking to those that's going back with him i'm speaking to those amen the devil can't starve you for nothing you're bound for the rapture you're going in the rapture you are certified you come from god and you're going back to god hallelujah so so satan began to this this beast is walking through the god you know how sometimes you you come to church and you you you're gonna have a good time and all of a sudden you walk in and all of a sudden you get a bad taste in your mouth anybody ever been there and and you just don't feel like worship tonight i just don't feel like it i just i did you know i had a rough day pastor just don't know what i'm going through he don't know i have had a rough day you don't know what he's going through see but that's why when we come in the house of the lord you need to zero everything out and put your mind on the lord take your troubles and bring them to the altar and leave them there look devil i'm not gonna let you steal my joy tonight i come for my healing tonight and i'm going to get my healing tonight i i got a mind battle and i'm going back i'm going to have a piece of mind the bible declared i am the god that keepeth thee amen he said i'm able to keep thee from all i'm able to keep thee and our god cannot lie so he perhaps walking into god and satan satan begins to study and i'm sure it didn't happen it took a while he studies us you know he you know he studies you and you know if you kind of slow fall you know by coming to church he'll tell you you know you tired tonight why don't you get you some rest you know you you shouldn't just wait another night you know you tired you know but if you love the lord he can't tell you that huh yeah the devil used to tell me you tired i said you alive i'm not tired i said you must be tired trying to pass me and no you can't get me so i said i'm not tired when i'm in the presence of lord your joy you know it's a saturday night it's snowing on that side it's cold but it's warm in my heart when i could just get with a tank when i get with the church the bride of jesus christ we can have a revival thank you where'd this woman walking in the garden and saint began to study her he began to watch this woman and i'm sure you know he just couldn't approach adam will y'all let me preach this tonight he just couldn't walk up on adam any kind of way i mean he knew adam was made in the very image of god out of moving things around he said i can't mess with him so he had to watch the buy product y'all helped me tonight and and so so here's here's satan all of a sudden uh brother the serpent just walking through the garden you know just walking upright handsome looking fella uh between a chimpanzee and a man close to a man i think the prophet said he walking through

let me give a little testimony here tonight before we pray we when that in services go on wednesday but the wednesday before this go on wednesday we came from church preached at night and we got home and i was so tired when i when i get home i like to take a little bit of sleep before i do anything just to get myself together so i just got myself ready and i just slipped into bed and and and my wife was there trying to get ready for bed we talked and everything and as soon as i slept off she was almost getting into a heart attack brother jason she was not breathing and she looked at me dead i was i was tired i was gone you know when and i was just between sleep and awake [Music] and she she said no he's tired i'm going to leave him to sleep and then [Music] she said her chest just started getting a little bit tight she just couldn't breathe and i think she was she was texting a little bit with sister joy and text her and actually if her mama was up she said no mama just gone to bed she said well okay just leave mama and and joy said why she said i can't breathe and so joy went and got her mother up and uh and sister alice just told my wife sister irene said just lay your hand on your chest and they both went into praying you know [Music] and she said as soon as sister ali says amen the burden just left her chest she passed she felt so afraid and then the strange thing there is that she went in her mama's room she went in obama's room to sleep and then i i got up i said where she's where she's not sleeping and i went down all the light is off in the house well when my wife's sleeping i know how to find her when she's sleeping praise the lord because i know her sleeping sound but i couldn't hear her sleeping sound so i was wondering where did she go to i opened the kid's window i saw a vehicle he's outside i says where has she gone to this girl she won't even find time to sleep where's she going to i look in her mother room i just i just glanced in the room and i didn't even know she was sleeping there so i said well okay whatever she went over i think she okay i went back in the room and i i sat on my table a little bit my study table i prayed and i spent some time with the lord and i did my regular devotion i would do and then i slid back into bed almost about three a.m in the morning [Music] and then uh early in the morning we wake up for devotion and after we got through praying and then she was telling me i actually said where were you she says well i was i was i was over in mama's room sleeping i said wow you really had a good sleep because i couldn't hear your sound and then she started telling me you know after after sister alice prayed for her she slept so well until she did not snow well i just said that to say tonight [Music] you know just like the preacher said on a cold saturday night you walk into the building two or three person comes into the building and the song leader starts to leave songs and everybody trying to break out of the call but let me tell you god is entrusting us with something that our human mind can never comprehend praise the lord i mean we are coming to the place where just a phone call and says well brothers let's let's meet to the church no plain service and we can just send a text message and say let everybody meet to the church at 7 pm and we can come together with no musicians and still have a great service why because it does not take our human preparation our human effort and just take the right attitude it just takes the right attitude nor in death we are not coming to play religion we are just coming to fall in love with the one that we love we are just coming to fellowship around his word you might not even know the preacher you might not even understand what he preached it's because you love the word that's why you are here tonight praise the lord and i believe that god honored your sinful faith of being here tonight and he blessed us with a wonderful service let's stand on our feet and just worship him a little bit i go away in truth the [Applause] [Music] me i go with him with it all the way [Music] steve cassidy you want to come close to service tonight [Music] all right let's borrow heads heavenly father we just thank you lord for this evening and lord just appreciate father the words that were spoken words of life lord god and that's what you have given us is life and we thank you for that lord just lord so much was shared so much was spoken so much for god that i know even personally lord god that things i need to hear and

father i pray lord jesus we are here because of you lord it's because of you lord god it is because of you and we thank you lord god for what you are doing in our lives we thank you lord god for the trials that we go through we thank you lord god for the mistakes that we make lord god because we learn lord god from the things that we do wrong we learn lord god from the mistakes that we we go through father lord god because you're calling us lord god to a higher walk you're calling this lord god to a higher place oh god we can't get there lord god if we don't lord god go forward if we

we adore you [Music] it's you praise the lord you know church i will say that i'm i'm i kind myself privileged to be part of this little body here and what god is doing right here there have never been a time that we come even sometimes when when we come here as brothers to pray maybe two or three persons there's never been a time that the lord has not met us here you know sometimes people get angry and says oh i didn't yet about a service you know one of my the glorious meetings i ever had was 2004 in nairobi kenya we we just we just we were just we just went on a transit visa but the brother kind of trapped us into an entire week program [Music] my brother and my sibling daily five days we have over 24 services they were not playing meetings from one service it was just a phone call to the next village [Music] it was three services everywhere we went i started the service i preached the second service he come preach the terror service i moved to the next village where i got the strength from i still asked myself where did i got that strength from praise the lord i can't even preach two servants i almost want to die you know but all the law asks us is just to be available praise the lord god knows that you can never be prepared he just want you to be available that that scriptural word yell yourself it means be available that all just be available just be willing that's all you want just be willing to worship just be willing to receive just make yourself available we come with all this technicality in our mind we got to make ourselves ready and sometimes the strange thing people take those thoughts and when it's communion service they say well i'm not prepared how prepared can you get [Music] how prepared can you get you see that's the reason why he never even tell us what would be the day of the rapture because you will wait for that day to get prepared how prepared can you get god just want you to be available come with a truthful heart he knows exactly where you are he knows exactly what you need the lord bless you tonight let's go in the peace of the lord and we'll be back tomorrow come with your shouting shoes let's think let's sing the song [Music] i don't know we sang it here before we are the children of god we came from god [Music] we are the children of god we came from god we go to god hallelujah [Music] oh we are the children
