========================================

our leaf or this meeting is to be a little you as far as we know here and now we have give out the meeting Wednesday through Sunday but then it's Sunday is closing into Christmas holidays but it whenever the Lord tells us to stop that'll be the time we don't know just what the results will be but believing that the folks here at the Tabernacle and our sister churches which is one of them is is the holiness tabernacle at Utica which brother Grimm Snelling is a pastor and in New Albany where brother juni Jackson is pastor and also out on the highway where brother rattle is pastor we are and their sister churches of this Tabernacle we are trying to bring the our people into a better fellowship with Christ that's our purpose so I have chosen to read and to teach on for the next few nights tonight I want to speak on the subject of what is the Holy Ghost and tomorrow night I want to preach on what was it given far and on Friday night and to the recorders I don't want this recorded Friday night how do I get the Holy Ghost and how do I know when I have it then we will just let then see what the Lord will lead us for Saturday and Sunday and Sunday morning a healing service and another evangelistic service for Sunday night and now we want everyone to know that and I know the recorders is running in the backroom and we wish to say this because in these meetings like this on the evangelistic type we have people from different denominations of churches which has been taught in their own sphere our belief each one and that's alright I have never wanted to be guilty of sowing discord among brethren and out in the meetings I just preach on the great evangelical truths of the scripture on what brethren who sponsor my meeting believe in but in the tabernacle here I want to speak on what we believe therefore if you if you do not understand it I would be very happy to have a little letter or note from you to ask me a question of why that we believe it thus and I would be glad to try to explain it the best that I can you know every church if you don't have a doctrine you're not a church you've got to have something that you stand for some principles that you're holding up and regardless of what a person's affiliation our denomination might be if that person has burned all the spirit of God that's my brother or my sister regardless of we might different in other things as far as East from the West but we are still brothers and I would not do nothing but try to help that brother for a closer better walk to Christ and I believe any real true Christian would do the same for me now I've asked this Tabernacle now we're not entering into this just far up attractive meeting I want to enter into this and I want you and have asked you to burn every Bridge that's behind you and make every sin right that we're coming into this with all debts in our hearts and lives we must come here for the sole purpose of getting our souls ready for the coming of the Lord and for no other purpose and as I have spoken and said that maybe sometime I might teach or say something that might be a little contrary to what someone else will weigh they believe that idea did not comfort controversy I can't we're here to make ready the coming of the Lord and I think that this little group I've got some visiting brethren with me here I know from different places and we're happy to have him and no doubt the walk out to the audience there there's others from out of town from out from around our little joining cities here we're happy to have you and so appreciative of you if you love us well enough to come be here these things God may you take home with you my brother's sister the richest treasures God can pour in your heart is my prayer and to this little Tabernacle seeing I believe that it is one of the finest people that I believe its own earth goes to this tabernacle I never said all the finest people I said some of the finest people on earth go to this tabernacle but as day by day entering back from meeting to meeting I see a great need of this tabernacle a great need in it and that's far appealing our consecration a deeper life a closer walk with God and I have promised them to do this to have this message is for them and we're glad to bring you in and fellowship with us around the Word of God as we teach and try to bring out now the first three nights we will not be taken a subject of preach on but a message to teach from the Word of God and now for I would not ask anyone to do anything that I would not do myself and this week has been a complete Calvary for me I've been so close to to the blacking out as I would place it till I was almost beside myself but I have completely surrendered every will and everything that I know of to the Lord the other night at around little after midnight wife and I after setting up and praying and talking to the Lord across the little footstool in our front room with to open Bibles we consecrated ourselves anew to God for complete service that we would surrender our own will that everything and every negative thought and to serve the Lord Jesus not trusted that's been your attitude to that you've done the same thing then when we are coming tonight we're coming up on holy ground among a people who's been praying and fasting and making restitutions and getting ready to receive something from God and I know that he that will come we will not go away hungry but God will feed with the bread of life now before we read from his sacred book let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer Lord there has already been prayer offered in this place tonight there has been the songs of Zion has been sung by your children their hearts has been lifted up and we have come here to consecrate ourselves to thee and to worship thee from the depths of our soul and we are calling this to your remembrance Lord that you said when you set up on the mouth and taught your disciples blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled you promised at large we are coming tonight with open hearts we are coming hungry and thirsty and we know you keep your promise as we endeavor to open up these sacred pages of the Bible to read from it the contents may the Holy Spirit just take it to every heart may that seed fall down into deep rich faith that will bring forth every promise that the word has made hear us Lord and cleanse us in trials and if there be any unclean thing about us Lord any unconfessed saying any thing that's not right reveal it just now or we'll walk right straight and do it far we realize we're living in the chapters of the coming of the Lord Jesus and we have our holy God come into the shadows of that justice tonight and we are pleading for a new dedication and consecration and feeling of the Holy Spirit in our lives seeing the revival fires begin to dim let us throw on wood of the word that it might Kindle a new fire that our hearts would be full of zeal sanctify us Lord to thy precious word and our blood and I Grace we plead and all thanks and praise will be done take all prejudice from our hearts cleanse us O Lord give us pure hearts and clean hands and clean minds that we might come into the sanctuary night after night rejoicing and filled with your spirit we ask this in Jesus name and for his sake amen I wish to read the word just now while I asked you to bring your Bibles your pencils your papers for scriptures if you so desire so it would be very fine and I while you're getting to the seventh chapter of Acts to begin with the answer the question are to start in answering the question what is the holy spirit there is nothing that will defeat Satan there's never been nothing on the earth yet that would ever defeat Satan like the Word of God Jesus used it in his great battle he said it is written and this morning while I've been listening a few days ago to a broadcast that seemed to want to tell that creation just come from some ashes blowing together and some phosphate and a few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine created the germ of life and brought out life how ridiculous when the sunshine will kill any germ of life lay a germ out in the sunshine it'll kill it immediately and there is no such thing but Satan trying to punch that at me now I've tried take him out a little Rebecca to school this morning and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I'd get into that stuff again so I just turned it back off and as I going on up the street Satan said to me he said do you know that this man that you call Jesus was just a man like one day in his day like the Billy Graham Oral Roberts he was just a man that they began to have a few people to gather around me and say he's a great man a natural Holly become greater and then he become a god to them and now it's scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all I thought of how to liar you are and then I turned just as I was crossing grim Street I said Satan you this talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was that the Hebrew prophet spoke of that would come who was the Anointed Messiah what was up on those men who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who wasn't it foretold it just to the letter and when he come they said he was numbered with the transgressors and he was he was wounded for our transgressions and he was he made his grave with the rich but he would rise up the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that does it he can't stand that word for it's inspired let's start reading tonight in the 7th chapter of the book of Acts then said the high priest are these things so and he said man and brethren and fathers hearken the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Massa poni ax before he dwelt in Charen and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and common to a land which I'll show thee then que me out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charen and front fence when his father was dead he removed him into this land whirring you now dwell and he gave him not inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child God spake on this wise that his seeds his sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will our judge saith God and add to that shall they come forth and serve me in this country and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcising the eighth day and I think they got Jacob and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today of the what is the holy spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken these subject in line like this you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you get it see that just would settle it just like I was talking to our brother Jeffrey's today and he said I would like to be at the meeting tonight but I'll be there tomorrow night he didn't know the meeting was going on because we didn't announce it just right here some of the brother Leo and them wrote to some of our friends and told him out of town well because we didn't have room now I said brother Jeffries if you sent me down to turn on one of your aura wells and I didn't know nothing about it I'd probably blow it up I might turn the wrong key or start the wrong motor I'd have to know how to do it before I did it and that's the way with receiving the Holy Ghost you've got to know what you are coming for and how to receive it and what it is now the first place the Holy Spirit has been promised we could take ten weeks and never just skip the age of this subject what the Holy Spirit is but the first thing I want to approach it just enough to give an outline each night then see the following night if there's any questions how many in here has not received the Holy Ghost been baptized with the Holy Ghost raise your hands you know the admin just look at the hand now I want to talk on it as a Holy Spirit being a sign [Music] for it is a sign we realize that that all promises is given to us by Abraham was a father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after him the promises made to Abraham and to his seed and this sign is to a covenant people now there is a vast difference between just a Christian and a Holy Ghost filled Christian and now we're going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scripture the first place there is a Christian professed to be a Christian but if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in process of being a Christian see he is professed to believe it he's working to it but God has not yet given him this spirit of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached that goal with God that God's recognized it because that God made a covenant with Abraham after he had called Abraham which is a type of calling sick believer today he called Abraham and Abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land to dwell among strange people and that was a type of when God called the man the stop is meanest repent of his sins he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd among new types of people and then after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise that God gave him that he would have the child and through this child all the earth would be blessed then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit just the very next verses of this chapter that we have just read if you want to take it down and the Stephen said in the 51st burst ye stiff necks uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so to you the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham this the circumcision sign after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country it was a son and all his children and his seat after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction it was to separate them from all other peoples this sign of circumcision and that's what God uses today it's the sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's church a separated church from all other Creed's days and denominations [Music] they're in all kinds of denominations but yet they are a separated people you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether you see the Holy Ghost or not so can you it separates them it's a mark it's a sign and the Holy Spirit is a sign and it's any child that refused circumcision in the Old Testament which was a foreshadow of the Holy Ghost was cut off from amongst the people he could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised now pattern that to today a person that would refuse to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no fellowship among those that has the Holy Ghost you just can't do it you have to be a nature like it's my mother there used to say birds of a feather flock together well it's an old proverb but it's a true one you don't see doves and crows fellowshipping their diets are different their habits are different their desires are different that's the way it is with the world and with the Christian when you have been circumcised by the Holy Spirit which means to cut off a flesh circumcision could only be in the male but if the woman was married to a man she was part of him she was circumcised with him you remember and Timothy word said never notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continues in faith and holiness with all sobriety now circumcision you know when the Sarah laughed in the tent behind her at the message of the angel when he said Abe ham not knowing who he was a stranger where is thy wife Sarah how did he know that he had a wife as Jesus said as it was in the days of love so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man remember those signs wasn't committed down to Sodom and Gomorrah in the world amongst the religionists but it was to the elect that called out and Abraham was called out and the word church means called out the separated like Abraham separate himself and then when Sarah left at the very message of the angel God would have killed her on the spot but he could not bother Sarah without bothering Abraham because they were one she was part of him you're no longer Twain but one so circumcision the holy spirit today circumcised is the heart and it's a sign a given side someone said the other day I just repeat this not as a joke because it's the truth but it sounds like a joke as I've often said this is no place for jokes but there was a little German out on the west coast where we were just add he received the Holy Ghost and he went down the street and he would walk a little piece and he'd raise up his hands and speak in tongues and he would run and he would jump and he would shout and he was at work carrying all I got and his boss said to him where have you been I like those places where you have been he said you must have been down amongst that bunch of nuts he said then you think they are nuts he said surely are he said well praise the Lord for the nuts [Music] [Music]
