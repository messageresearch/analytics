[35:02] Let's sing there tonight.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:21] &gt;&gt; I'm a [singing]
[35:26] he
[35:37] pom. [music and singing]
[35:42] And my sins
[35:44] I watch,
[35:46] they [singing and music] are all watch
[35:49] away.
[35:51] Oh my sins
[35:54] I watch [music]
[35:56] away.
[36:00] [music]
[36:01] I'm amazed
[36:05] that you love [music and singing] me.
[36:11] I'm amazed,
[36:13] oh [singing] Lord, that you care.
[36:18] [music]
[36:19] And through [singing] your preious
[36:23] blood [music]
[36:25] I found father
[36:30] and [music] my [singing] sins
[36:33] I watch
[36:35] [music]
[36:36] all [singing]
[36:37] watch away.
[36:40] Oh my sins
[36:42] I wash [music]
[36:45] away.
[36:48] Now [music] when you think about that
[36:49] chorus,
[36:51] I don't know how much of us is retold
[36:55] that you can be [music] earnest to say
[36:57] you are amazed that God love you. Praise
[37:00] [music] the Lord. It's not really just
[37:03] only a song. I believe it came from a
[37:05] deep inspiration [music]
[37:07] from the writer. But when you think
[37:09] about it yourself,
[37:12] does it amaze you that he love you?
[37:14] [music]
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:17] Do you really feel that it amaze [music]
[37:21] you
[37:23] that God love you? We want to talk a
[37:26] [music] little bit about the love of God
[37:28] tonight. Let's just sing that one more
[37:30] time.
[37:41] [music]
[37:42] Yes, I'm on this.
[37:46] Oh [singing] that [music] you love me.
[37:53] I'm amazed [singing]
[37:54] [music]
[37:57] that you care [singing]
[38:01] through [music] your preious [singing]
[38:05] blood
[38:11] and my [music and singing] sins
[38:14] I watch. Oh, they are all [singing]
[38:18] watch away.
[38:20] Oh, my sins. [music]
[38:23] I watch
[38:26] away. [music and singing]
[38:29] Praise the Lord. You know, I Andrew
[38:32] Crutch sank a song, I don't know why
[38:34] Jesus loved me.
[38:37] And I've I've I've heard
[38:41] uh a lot of religious [music] people
[38:44] around the message uh that things that
[38:47] we must not sing that song because the
[38:50] seals are open. We must not ask the
[38:53] question I don't know why Jesus love me.
[38:56] But I would tell you that uh
[39:00] even in eternity we will still be
[39:02] learning why he love us.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music]
[39:13] I don't know [music] why
[39:17] Jesus [singing]
[39:18] loved me.
[39:24] I [music] don't know why
[39:27] he cares.
[39:33] I don't know why
[39:36] he [singing and music] sacrifice his
[39:38] life. Oh, but I'm glad. [singing]
[39:49] [music]
[39:51] I don't know why [singing]
[39:54] Jesus loved me.
[39:59] I don't know [singing] why [music]
[40:02] he cares.
[40:08] I don't [singing] know [music] why
[40:11] he sacrificed his life. Oh, [music] but
[40:15] I'm glad
[40:18] when he [singing] did.
[40:22] Oh, sing more of the earth. Amen. The
[40:25] Lord bless you tonight. Let's take our
[40:27] [music] Bibles.
[40:29] Praise the Lord.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Because I think for many of us or for
[40:40] some of us
[40:54] the way we understand the grace of God
[40:58] is a little bit different. Luke chapter
[41:00] 10 tonight. Luke chapter 10, Sunday. We
[41:04] read a little bit from Matthew chapter
[41:06] 23. Let's look at another conversation
[41:09] with Jesus and another lawyer,
[41:13] another student of the word, J uh uh uh
[41:17] uh Luke chapter 10-9.
[41:24] after service uh on Sunday. I couldn't
[41:28] get out of my mind loving the Lord with
[41:31] all of your heart and all of your soul
[41:35] and all of your strength. I couldn't get
[41:36] that out of my mind.
[41:39] I I lay there I think about it. I says,
[41:42] "How do we love God
[41:44] with all of our heart?" Think about that
[41:47] tonight.
[41:51] When Jeremiah the prophet of God says
[41:54] the heart is desperately wicked,
[41:57] meaning the heart is unconvertible.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Then how can we love God with all of our
[42:06] heart? That's why we want to look into a
[42:08] little bit tonight. Just ask that the
[42:10] Lord will bless it. Amen.
[42:15] Luke chapter 10, we read from verse 25.
[42:19] Luke chapter 10.
[42:21] We'll read from verse 25.
[42:24] Praise the Lord.
[42:30] Luke chapter 10. I mean Luke chapter 9.
[42:34] Come on. Put it together there. Luke
[42:37] chapter 10 verse 25. And behold, a
[42:40] certain lawyer stood up to tempt him.
[42:45] This is not the same case. Uh Matthew
[42:47] chapter 22 was a different case. This is
[42:49] different. You will see that the setting
[42:51] year is different.
[42:55] Stood up to tempt him. Master, what
[42:57] shall I do to inherit eternal life?
[43:03] Praise the Lord.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; What shall I do to inherit eternal life?
[43:07] This was the same question of the young
[43:09] rich ruler.
[43:12] He said unto him, Jesus said unto this
[43:15] gentleman,
[43:17] what is written in the Lord,
[43:21] how readth down? Praise the Lord.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; What is written in the Lord and how
[43:28] readth down? Two different things. What
[43:32] is written and how you read it
[43:34] &gt;&gt; is two different things. You could be
[43:37] reading it completely
[43:40] different contrary from what is written.
[43:43] what is written and how readth. And and
[43:47] he answering said,
[43:50] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[43:54] all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
[43:58] and with all thy strength, and with all
[44:01] thy mind,
[44:03] and thy neighbor as thyself.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; That's the lawyer answering Jesus this.
[44:10] And he said unto him, Jesus said unto
[44:12] him, "Thou hath answered right.
[44:17] This do and thou shall live."
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading
[44:25] of his word. You can have the comfort of
[44:27] your seat
[44:28] &gt;&gt; while I remain standing
[44:30] &gt;&gt; and the fellowship continue. Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And the fellowship continue. Praise the
[44:37] Lord.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] Amen.
[44:45] Now, so tonight
[44:48] I want us to look at this a little bit.
[44:50] We will just uh do couple of review here
[44:54] and there, but uh I want us to look at
[44:58] this thought tonight and just and just
[45:00] study it together.
[45:04] Jesus, this Lord again is saying to
[45:06] Jesus, "Thou shalt love the Lord with
[45:08] all of thy heart and all of your soul
[45:11] and all of your strength and all of your
[45:14] mind and uh and your neighbor as
[45:16] yourself." Now, in in over in Matthew
[45:19] chapter 22, when we read that, we saw
[45:22] how Jesus uh broke the ten commandments
[45:26] into two. We we we deal with that a
[45:28] little bit on uh uh
[45:32] on Sunday. Today I want for us to look
[45:35] at uh uh a kind of a progression. If you
[45:41] follow me a little bit, you will see it.
[45:43] Okay. Exodus chapter 20. That's where
[45:46] the ten command means.
[45:49] We're reading. Let's go to Exodus
[45:51] chapter 20.
[45:54] Praise the Lord.
[45:57] Exodus chapter 20.
[46:08] And then we read reading from verse one.
[46:17] And God speak unto God speak all these
[46:20] words saying and God speak all these
[46:23] words saying
[46:26] I am the Lord thy God which have brought
[46:30] thee out of the land of Egypt and out of
[46:34] the house of bondage.
[46:37] Thou shalt have no other god before me.
[46:41] Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:43] Thou shalt not make any
[46:47] thou shall not make unto thee any graven
[46:49] image or any likeness
[46:53] of anything that is in heaven above or
[46:57] that is in the earth beneath or that is
[47:00] in the waters under the earth. Thou
[47:04] shalt not bow down thyself to them.
[47:10] Don't serve them.
[47:12] For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous
[47:16] God, visiting their iniquities
[47:20] of the fathers upon the children, unto
[47:23] the dead and the fourth generation, to
[47:25] them that hate me, and showing mercy
[47:29] unto thousands of them that love me, and
[47:32] keep my commandments.
[47:34] Praise the Lord.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not
[47:40] take the name of the Lord thy God in
[47:43] vain. That's that's that's the third
[47:45] commandment now. Thou shall not take the
[47:47] name of the Lord thy God in vain.
[47:51] But if you look at let's let's go back a
[47:54] little bit. If you look at uh uh the
[47:57] first
[47:59] and the second,
[48:03] if you don't read it closely, it will be
[48:06] difficult for you to be able to tell
[48:08] which was the first and which was the
[48:10] second.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Because he's telling them, you must not
[48:16] have no other god before me. You must
[48:18] not have no graven image. You must not
[48:20] bow down before them. Praise the Lord.
[48:23] So which mean uh uh uh he repeats it.
[48:27] [snorts] He repeats the first
[48:29] commandment. You must have no other god
[48:31] before me. That is the first
[48:33] commandment. The second commandment is
[48:36] that you should not have no grave in
[48:38] image. It's almost like the first. Am I
[48:40] right? Are we together?
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like the first. So
[48:46] he's uh is is is it's more like he's uh
[48:50] he's he's making emphasis.
[48:52] Praise the Lord.
[48:55] You must not have no other god before
[48:57] me. Now, they are coming from the land
[48:59] of Egypt. You have to grab the setting.
[49:02] They're coming from out of the land of
[49:03] Egypt where there were uh hundreds
[49:06] different gods. God of fatality, God of
[49:10] harvest, God of uh the flies, and God of
[49:13] of uh you know, God of everything.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's uh he's he's not only
[49:21] telling them that uh you know uh he's
[49:24] trying to grab grab them from within.
[49:28] It's not just only don't have no other
[49:30] god beside me. But don't also have no
[49:34] graving image.
[49:37] It must not be of the heavens because uh
[49:40] the Egyptian had god of the heavens. Uh
[49:42] what that worship for for for rain and
[49:45] for for whatever they want. You must not
[49:48] have no god of the earth because they
[49:50] have different god. No god of the waters
[49:52] because uh they are god of fatality and
[49:55] everything you know. So he's he's just
[49:58] trying to get this to them.
[50:01] But if you actually look at it, it's the
[50:03] same thing. If you say don't have no
[50:06] other god before me is the same as don't
[50:08] have grading image, don't have water
[50:10] god, don't have heaven god, whatever it
[50:12] is. But he's making emphasis. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Then the third commandment
[50:23] uh verse seven is thou shalt now take
[50:25] the name of the Lord thy God in vain for
[50:28] the Lord will now hold him guiltless
[50:32] that take his name in vain. Praise the
[50:34] Lord.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth commandment is remember
[50:38] the Sabbath vain and keep it holy. Then
[50:42] he make emphasis here. Six days thou
[50:45] shalt labor and do thy work, but the
[50:47] seventh day, you know, he's he's trying
[50:49] to explain it to them. He's trying to
[50:52] make them to see what he's talking
[50:54] about.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when we spoke on Sunday, we
[51:00] put these first four commandments
[51:03] together as the great commandment that
[51:05] Jesus talked about.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Matthew chapter 22, uh, uh, he
[51:12] says, uh, uh, uh, the first commandment,
[51:14] and this is the great commandment, thou
[51:17] shalt love the Lord thy God with all of
[51:20] your heart,
[51:22] all of your soul, all of your strength.
[51:26] Praise the Lord.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[51:32] Let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[51:43] Are we together?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Now the setting of Deuteronomy here, the
[51:48] setting of Exodus is that the people
[51:50] have just come out of Egypt.
[51:53] Praise the Lord.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; The people have come out of Egypt. They
[51:58] are setting on their journey to the
[51:59] promised land. The setting of
[52:01] Deuteronomy is that Moses is about to
[52:05] leave the people. Between Exod and
[52:09] Deuteronomy, they have 40 years
[52:12] of traveling in the wilderness.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; They have 40 years between Exod and
[52:21] Deuteronomy. And what is happening here
[52:24] in the book of Deuteronomy is that Moses
[52:28] is uh uh uh he revi he he revising or or
[52:33] rehearsing the commandment. He he's
[52:36] bringing the entire history of the
[52:38] people trying to remind them the
[52:40] children that were born in the
[52:42] wilderness, those that were not in Egypt
[52:44] that did not experience the red seed.
[52:46] He's bringing everybody up to date.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now
[52:50] &gt;&gt; amen.
[52:52] from uh from the first chapter. He's
[52:54] he's he's bringing the people how God
[52:56] brought them out uh through the Red Sea
[52:59] and everything. He's he's he's uh you
[53:01] know trying to do a review with the
[53:04] people.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring them up today because he
[53:10] he's he's not having much time to be
[53:12] with the people. He will soon be taken
[53:14] away. He know that his time is up. He
[53:17] will soon be leaving. and uh uh uh um
[53:21] and and and and they have the the the
[53:24] the promised land ahead of him. But look
[53:27] at this now. 40 years between um Exodus
[53:32] and Deuteronomy. Look at this.
[53:34] Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[53:39] Praise the Lord.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Let's read from verse one. Now these are
[53:50] the commandments and statutes and
[53:52] judgment which the Lord your God
[53:54] commanded to teach to teach you that ye
[53:57] might do them in the land where ye go to
[54:02] possess it. possess it that that thou
[54:06] may fear the Lord thy God to keep all
[54:09] his statutes and his commandment which I
[54:12] command thee thou and thy sons and your
[54:15] son songs sons all the days of thy life
[54:19] and that the days may be prolonged
[54:25] praise the Lord
[54:26] &gt;&gt; year therefore oh Israel
[54:30] and observe to do this that it may be
[54:33] well with thee, that thou may increase
[54:38] mightily, as the Lord
[54:41] God of thy fathers have promised thee in
[54:44] the land that flowth with milk and
[54:47] honey.
[54:49] Here, oh Israel,
[54:52] the Lord our God is one.
[54:57] Praise the Lord. Now, Moses right here,
[55:02] he's about to rehearse
[55:04] the Ten Commandments to them,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; but he's not going to say it to them the
[55:10] way he said it in Exodus.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Now, in Exod, MOSES HAD the Ten
[55:20] Commandments written on plate.
[55:24] He was reading
[55:26] the plate to the people.
[55:28] Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Thou shall not have no other grave in
[55:32] image, not the God, not of the heavens,
[55:34] not the earth. Just like we read in
[55:36] Exodus, he was reading from the two
[55:38] plates that he had in HIS HANDS. NOW,
[55:41] HERE HE'S NOT READING from the plates.
[55:44] He's reading from his experience.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; AFTER WALKING FOR 40 YEARS, he have
[55:56] really understood what God said on those
[55:59] plates. [snorts]
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Are you are you getting the picture?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; AFTER WALKING FOR 40 YEARS,
[56:10] he has really understood what God has
[56:13] said, the word that was given to him. So
[56:16] he's not coming back again to to to to
[56:20] uh repeat
[56:22] what uh uh uh he told the people 40
[56:26] years ago.
[56:28] NOW HE'S TELLING THEM referring back to
[56:31] the same commandment that Yeah. O Israel
[56:35] the Lord your God is one.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LORD YOUR GOD IS ONE is the
[56:42] same as
[56:44] don't have no other god beside me.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Are you grabbing the picture?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; But he's he's now he's he's speaking in
[56:57] a in in in a more progressive way. He
[57:01] have had progress with the Lord. HE HAVE
[57:04] UNDERSTOOD HOW GOD HAS BEEN dealing with
[57:07] the people.
[57:09] Now everything we read in Exodus, you
[57:12] must not have no other uh graven in
[57:14] image, not of the heavens, now of the
[57:17] earth, now under the sea. H
[57:21] uh you must NOW BOW BEFORE THEM.
[57:23] EVERYTHING THAT he said right there,
[57:26] he's going to just put them together.
[57:30] When he said, "Yeah, O Israel, THE LORD
[57:33] OUR GOD IS ONE LORD. THOU AND THOU SHALT
[57:38] LOVE THE LORD THY God with all of thine
[57:43] heart and all of thy soul and all of thy
[57:48] might.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And see what he says in
[57:52] verse six. And these words which I
[57:56] command thee this day shall be in thine
[58:00] heart.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:03] So when Jesus was telling the Pharisees
[58:07] in Matthew chapter 22, he was quoting
[58:10] exactly what Moses said word for word.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; He was not going back to to uh uh the
[58:22] the the written word. Now he was quoting
[58:25] the spoken word.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 20 was the written word.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:32] Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 6 is now the spoken
[58:36] word.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; If I can if I can compare it like that
[58:42] just to be able to to give us a picture.
[58:44] So now we so we we what what what we
[58:47] want to look at here is to see uh uh uh
[58:51] all of these years just like I said that
[58:54] Moses uh this is like 40 years he have
[58:57] seen how the people had tempted God.
[59:00] This was the same man that said, "Lord,
[59:02] oh, what what what a people is this?"
[59:04] And and the man that went in the breach
[59:07] between God and the people when God was
[59:10] about to wipe the people out just
[59:12] because of their stubbornness and uh and
[59:15] because of their complaining and
[59:16] everything, he said, "God, what were the
[59:18] nations about about you that you were
[59:21] not able to keep the people that you
[59:23] brought out of Egypt?"
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:25] He have seen all of these things dealing
[59:29] with the people speaking to God. It have
[59:32] given him
[59:34] a lot of experience.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Therefore, for Moses, IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO
[59:41] SAY THE PROPHECY.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO QUOTE FROM THE
[59:48] TABLETS.
[59:52] The word has become an inspiration now
[59:55] to Moses.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He honest to it.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where we going?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Now think about this also. These people
[1:00:08] that their heart was after the garlic of
[1:00:11] of Egypt
[1:00:14] and WHENEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING that
[1:00:16] came up, they were ready to tell Moses
[1:00:18] they want to go back. How could God ask
[1:00:22] them to love him with all of their
[1:00:26] heart?
[1:00:29] How how
[1:00:31] praise the Lord.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; How could God ask them to love him with
[1:00:39] all of their heart when their heart was
[1:00:41] not really after following the Lord
[1:00:44] their heart was back in Egypt?
[1:00:48] How could he ask him?
[1:00:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; The same question will be for you and
[1:00:55] myself tonight. How could how can the
[1:00:57] Lord ask us
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; to love him with all of our heart?
[1:01:02] How do we do it? How do we love him with
[1:01:06] our soul and with our mind and and and
[1:01:08] with our strength? How do you love the
[1:01:10] Lord with your strength?
[1:01:13] How do you love him with your strength?
[1:01:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you,
[1:01:25] I sleep in sleep and wake up in the
[1:01:27] middle of the night and keep thinking on
[1:01:29] this.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we just we just want to
[1:01:34] fellowship around that tonight. Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; We want to fellowship around that
[1:01:43] tonight and see how how the Lord
[1:01:48] uh will be able to help us tonight.
[1:01:53] Let's look at Hebrew chapter 4.
[1:01:58] Let's look at Hebrew chapter 4. One of
[1:02:00] our familiar
[1:02:02] scripture, Hebrew 4:12, the word is
[1:02:04] sharper than the two edges sword.
[1:02:07] Let's let's look at that.
[1:02:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:17] Amen.
[1:02:27] Hebrews chapter 4:12.
[1:02:30] For the word of God is quick and
[1:02:33] powerful
[1:02:35] and sharper
[1:02:37] than any two edges who are piercing even
[1:02:40] to the dividing the sun of the soul and
[1:02:43] the spirit. Praise the Lord. So right
[1:02:46] here Paul is giving us an idea that our
[1:02:49] soul and our spirit has a dividing
[1:02:51] aunder. They are not the same.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your soul and your spirit are not
[1:02:59] the same.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So he said the word of God is sharper.
[1:03:04] The word can go right in between and
[1:03:06] help you to know what reality is your
[1:03:09] soul and your your your the real you.
[1:03:12] And also to help you to know what is
[1:03:13] your spirit. The things uh uh that make
[1:03:16] up your attitude, your behavior, your
[1:03:19] like and your dislike.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; It's all in your spirit.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and see what he says again.
[1:03:30] And he says the word dividing the sun is
[1:03:35] piercing even to the dividing the sun of
[1:03:37] your soul and your spirit. And it goes
[1:03:40] to
[1:03:42] and of your joints
[1:03:45] and marrow.
[1:03:47] Amen.
[1:03:49] and is a descender of your thoughts and
[1:03:54] the intents of your heart.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Now, when you look at this,
[1:04:05] you see here what I want us to see right
[1:04:08] in Hebrew 4:12 is that your soul, your
[1:04:13] spirit, your mind a descender of your
[1:04:16] thought. Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Your mind and and and uh and and and
[1:04:21] what again is there your uh uh your
[1:04:24] maron
[1:04:26] uh your joints and your maron. Now I was
[1:04:29] looking at this today if uh if uh if if
[1:04:33] I don't know if I attach it to my notes
[1:04:35] but let me read this to you. This is uh
[1:04:39] something I was searching on how how is
[1:04:42] the maron connected to our strength.
[1:04:48] because I'm looking at Hebrew 4 to be
[1:04:51] able to understand how can I love the
[1:04:54] Lord with all of my strength.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I see my soul. I see my spirit. I see my
[1:05:03] mind which is my thoughts, my intent.
[1:05:06] Now, so I was also looking at it. See,
[1:05:08] see what it says here. The phrase the
[1:05:12] human strength from the marrow can refer
[1:05:15] to a several concept
[1:05:19] nutritionally or nutrition strength
[1:05:23] where bones marrow uh provide fats and
[1:05:27] nutrients that contribute to the human
[1:05:31] evolution.
[1:05:32] physical and structural strength where
[1:05:35] bones marrow can help distribute
[1:05:39] impart energy to joints
[1:05:42] and uh spiritual
[1:05:45] or symbolic strength where maron refer
[1:05:49] to the very cord of one being
[1:05:55] and is used in the phrase like the mar
[1:05:59] of the bone.
[1:06:02] to denote deep core strength
[1:06:07] and I also look at this one too. The
[1:06:10] saying there the he strain comes from
[1:06:12] the mara is is uh is partly uh a kind of
[1:06:17] a manifold referring to the inner cord
[1:06:20] of the strength but it it also has
[1:06:24] a base a basis in the in the the the
[1:06:29] functional strength that bone marrow
[1:06:32] provides for the entire body.
[1:06:36] The bone marrow create nearly all our
[1:06:40] blood cells which which are uh crucial
[1:06:46] for carrying oxygen and fighting disease
[1:06:50] and clocking blood. Why is stem cells is
[1:06:55] v for the repair and regeneration of
[1:06:59] tissues and bones.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, those are all scientific uh
[1:07:07] uh uh knowledge and idea. But what I was
[1:07:11] what I was actually looking at is the
[1:07:13] just like I said to you how how that's
[1:07:17] God is telling us to love him with all
[1:07:20] of our heart, all of our mind. Is it is
[1:07:24] it just keeping your mind on God? That's
[1:07:26] the law. That that's the way we should
[1:07:28] love him. That the whole day our mind
[1:07:30] should just be on him.
[1:07:33] Or is it just uh uh you know we wake up
[1:07:35] in the morning and all we do we read our
[1:07:38] Bible, we pray, we I mean we just do
[1:07:40] things uh uh religious things. Is is it
[1:07:43] what is required of us to love the Lord
[1:07:46] with all of our strength? What actually
[1:07:48] it is?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:03] Oh, it's beautiful.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; It's very beautiful. Now, so look at
[1:08:09] Hebrew chapter 4. As as we look at the
[1:08:12] thought together, the Bible is letting
[1:08:14] us know that the word is shephering the
[1:08:17] two edges sw
[1:08:20] and and generally we uh this is referred
[1:08:22] to as the preaching of the word. But go
[1:08:25] back to St. John chapter one. In the
[1:08:27] beginning was the word.
[1:08:29] Are we together?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and that was what we said
[1:08:33] on Sunday that that was the first form
[1:08:36] that God took when he left the form of
[1:08:39] being an eternal spirit.
[1:08:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; His first expression was the word.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He expressed himself and and and what
[1:08:53] was he doing? He was condescending.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. He was coming down.
[1:09:00] Are we together?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE A FORM WHERE he can relate to
[1:09:05] us.
[1:09:07] Are we together?
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He was taking a form. He was
[1:09:10] condescending to take a form where he
[1:09:14] can relate to us. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Now look, look here. Let's let's just uh
[1:09:25] read this little thought here in statute
[1:09:27] of a perfect man. We took a quote here
[1:09:29] that we want to uh uh just use that and
[1:09:33] and relax our mind a little bit. What is
[1:09:35] it? God condescending to his creation.
[1:09:39] God want to be worshiped. The word God
[1:09:42] means an object of worship.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is God trying to condition
[1:09:48] his people so he can get
[1:09:53] from them
[1:09:55] what he created them for.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Think about it now. You just think about
[1:10:01] those words. God conditioning us so he
[1:10:05] can get from us
[1:10:08] what he created us for. Are we together?
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] Now when you think on that, he never
[1:10:18] made you to be something else beside a
[1:10:22] son and a daughter of God.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says and and uh if you have
[1:10:31] missed that or being a son of God or
[1:10:34] being a daughter of God, you just enjoy
[1:10:36] being a church member, you just enjoy
[1:10:39] being an American, you just enjoy being
[1:10:42] whatever you think you are. If you miss
[1:10:44] that being a son of God or a daughter of
[1:10:47] God, then you have missed the mark.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You have missed the mark. You have
[1:10:54] missed your purpose.
[1:10:57] You have missed your purpose for being
[1:10:59] here.
[1:11:00] Now, so here is he conditioning us now.
[1:11:03] How is he conditioning us? That's what
[1:11:06] we want to look into a little bit.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; So, here is the great internal spirit.
[1:11:12] Now
[1:11:15] condescending
[1:11:18] he's coming down to be able to relate to
[1:11:21] us and he TOOK THIS FORM CALLED THE
[1:11:24] logus which of course is that's what is
[1:11:28] called the word.
[1:11:30] So this word now this this this word uh
[1:11:34] uh uh that uh this FORM THAT GOD HAS
[1:11:37] TOOK BY THIS FORM HE'S GOING TO create
[1:11:40] everything. That's what the book of
[1:11:42] pollution says. He created everything by
[1:11:44] his word. Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hebrew also testify by that
[1:11:48] by the word of God everything was
[1:11:50] created.
[1:11:52] And that's the that's the very same word
[1:11:54] now that Paul is saying here. The very
[1:11:57] same word that created everything is the
[1:11:59] same word he says is sharper than the
[1:12:02] two edges swall and and tears into the
[1:12:04] dividing the sun of our spirit and our
[1:12:07] our soul our uh the mars of our bone.
[1:12:10] the descenders of our thoughts and the
[1:12:12] desenter of the thoughts and the intents
[1:12:14] of our heart.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, God is so good.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; When you really think about it.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; When you really think about it,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; think about this phrase. When love
[1:12:29] projects.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; When love projects. Now you think about
[1:12:35] it. The Bible says, "For God so loved
[1:12:37] the word that he gave his only son." It
[1:12:41] was not just through the virgin birth.
[1:12:45] For God so loved the word that he gave
[1:12:47] his son. Goes back to Genesis when God
[1:12:50] condescended and took the form of the
[1:12:53] logos. It was God giving his son.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the beginning of the son.
[1:13:02] But see what is associ ASSOCIATED TO FOR
[1:13:06] GOD SO LOVETH THE WORD.
[1:13:10] AMEN. For God SO LOVED THE WORD THAT UH
[1:13:14] HE SENT HIS word like like like the
[1:13:17] psalmist WOULD SAY HE SENT his word and
[1:13:19] his word heal us.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He sent his word.
[1:13:26] THAT WORD THAT GOES OUT and and and and
[1:13:29] and and starts to identify your soul and
[1:13:33] starts to, you know, capture your spirit
[1:13:36] AND HEAL YOUR BODY AND DISCERN YOUR
[1:13:39] THOUGHTS AND TELL YOU THE INTENTS OF
[1:13:41] YOUR HEART. THAT VERY WORD IS GOD'S LOVE
[1:13:45] EXPRESSED.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you Are you grabbing the
[1:13:53] picture? is God's LOVE FOR GOD SO LOVE
[1:13:56] THE WORD.
[1:13:58] He love the word that he's he's coming
[1:14:01] down. HE HE'S TAKING A FORM uh uh to be
[1:14:05] able to associate with us.
[1:14:09] Not just to BE A A GOD OF DEAD and and
[1:14:12] we just as people down on earth, but
[1:14:14] he's coming down to fellowship with us,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; to commune with us.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] And if HE'S TELLING US THAT WE MUST LOVE
[1:14:27] HIM WITH ALL OF OUR HEART AND ALL OF OUR
[1:14:30] SOUL AND ALL OF OUR MIND AND ALL OF OUR
[1:14:33] STRENGTH,
[1:14:36] which of course he knows that we don't
[1:14:38] have the ability to do it.
[1:14:42] So you see, IT'S THAT VERY SAME LOVE,
[1:14:45] THAT VERY SAME WORD that is coming down,
[1:14:48] that very same word that is discerning
[1:14:51] your heart, that very same word that is
[1:14:54] that is uh going IN BETWEEN THE DIVIDING
[1:14:57] THE SUN of your soul AND YOUR SPIRIT.
[1:15:00] THAT IS THE VERY SAME WORD. AND THAT
[1:15:02] WORD IS THE love of God expressed to
[1:15:06] you.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; So are you seeing the picture? not clear
[1:15:13] yet. The picture here is that uh UH UH
[1:15:17] GOD IS WAS NOT relying on the ability of
[1:15:21] THE PEOPLE. HE KNOWS THAT BY NO WAY THE
[1:15:24] PEOPLE WILL KEEP THIS COMMANDMENT.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE
[1:15:32] WERE UNCONVERTED. THE HEARTS OF THE
[1:15:34] PEOPLE WERE BACK IN EGYPT. They had NOT
[1:15:37] THEY HAD REALLY NOT UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE
[1:15:40] WAS DOING.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:15:44] Praise the Lord. HE'S MAKING ALL OF
[1:15:46] THESE EMPHASIS TO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
[1:15:49] NO GRAVE IN IMAGE and and BECAUSE HE
[1:15:51] KNOW A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE GOT INTO
[1:15:54] THE EGYPTIAN WORSHIP. THEY HAVE THEIR
[1:15:56] LITTLE IMAGES UNDER THEIR BLANKETS and
[1:15:58] whatsoever.
[1:16:00] Are we together?
[1:16:02] BUT YOU SEE, GOD WAS GOING TO USE HIS
[1:16:06] WORD.
[1:16:08] He was going to use his word as he keeps
[1:16:11] speaking to the people. Take it take it
[1:16:14] in. Take the picture of Eliza and
[1:16:18] Rebecca and you will you will you will
[1:16:20] grab it. Amen. Yeah. Eric Elea here is
[1:16:24] speaking to this WOMAN ABOUT A MAN
[1:16:26] CALLED ISAAC THAT she have not seen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE MORE THAT ELA TALKED TO
[1:16:33] HER, THE MORE AN EMOTION IS creating in
[1:16:37] HER HEART TO LOVE THIS MAN THAT SHE HAVE
[1:16:41] NOT SEEN.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE IT IS GOING TO BE THE WORD
[1:16:46] THE WORD THAT COMES TO TO DIVIDE YOUR
[1:16:49] THE YOUR YOUR SOUL AND SPIRIT AND YOUR
[1:16:52] MARANCE AND YOUR THE INTENSE OF YOUR
[1:16:54] HEART IS GOING TO BE THIS VERY SAME word
[1:16:58] that is going to create the love of God
[1:17:00] in you.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the principle of when love
[1:17:07] projects.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; We have a projector here. We have our
[1:17:11] team back there.
[1:17:14] When we sing in a song, we call the song
[1:17:17] and they they tap it on their keyboard
[1:17:22] through the main electronic.
[1:17:25] It gets from the keyboard and hit the
[1:17:27] projector and then the the projector
[1:17:30] send it on this wall.
[1:17:33] Are we together?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] When love projects, you have to you you
[1:17:39] have to you have to pay attention now
[1:17:41] and see how this whole thing is working.
[1:17:44] Now when when the projector project the
[1:17:46] words this word h this this wall has to
[1:17:50] be fashioned in a way painted in a way
[1:17:53] that the letters can be able to express
[1:17:56] just like they did just now when love
[1:17:57] projects.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:18:03] This do not have these letters in it.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. UNTIL THE PROJECTOR
[1:18:11] sent it, there is no way this war can
[1:18:14] produce when love projects.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; He's giving US HIS WORD. LOVE ME WITH
[1:18:23] ALL OF YOUR HEART AND ALL OF YOUR SOUL
[1:18:26] AND ALL OF YOUR MIND. HOW CAN WE DO IT?
[1:18:29] love will project it.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; GOD PROJECTING HIS LOVE
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU AND MYSELF. WE SEE IT AS A
[1:18:44] REQUIREMENT.
[1:18:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; FOR GOD, HE WANTS YOU TO BE AVAILABLE.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; He wants YOU TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE
[1:18:58] WHAT? HE'S GOING TO CONDITION YOU.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; God conditioning us
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; to be ABLE TO GET FROM US what he made
[1:19:08] us for.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the principle?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; When love projects. So, I mean, uh, if
[1:19:19] we if we didn't had a wall year or maybe
[1:19:22] we had uh uh uh uh I I I don't know what
[1:19:26] how to how to say, but uh uh uh uh just
[1:19:30] just an airspace year and the projector
[1:19:32] will project whatever they want to
[1:19:34] project. You will never see what is
[1:19:36] projecting.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Because there is there is not a a a
[1:19:43] substance here to receive it.
[1:19:47] Are we together?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; There is not a substance here to be able
[1:19:52] to receive it. The wall is here. It's
[1:19:54] painted right. The the change the
[1:19:57] letters there. Take for example if the
[1:19:59] if they make the letters in gray color
[1:20:03] just like the color of this wall. It's
[1:20:06] going to be hard for us to see it.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; It's just going to blend in with the
[1:20:12] wall. You might just think it's a pin on
[1:20:14] the wall until you come. Oh yeah. Well,
[1:20:16] that it's a writing day.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Because for many, we see it like a
[1:20:28] requirement.
[1:20:31] And because we see it as a requirement,
[1:20:35] we work ourself towards loving God with
[1:20:38] all of our heart.
[1:20:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And we think it's something that we have
[1:20:44] to do
[1:20:48] and we work oursel with loving God with
[1:20:51] all of our mind
[1:20:53] and we think that is SOMETHING THAT WE
[1:20:56] HAVE TO work our mind.
[1:21:00] And what's about loving God with all of
[1:21:02] our strength,
[1:21:05] loving God with our spirit,
[1:21:08] which of course what you want to see,
[1:21:10] you look at the five senses of the
[1:21:12] spirit.
[1:21:15] And we think that we have to work
[1:21:17] ourself in all of these things to be
[1:21:20] able to keep that commandment because
[1:21:22] that is the great commandment. Love the
[1:21:23] Lord with all of your heart, with all of
[1:21:25] your mind, with all of your strength.
[1:21:28] How are we going to do it?
[1:21:31] WHEN WE ARE NOT BORN WITH the love of
[1:21:33] God, we not born with the love of God.
[1:21:36] WE ARE BORN WITH HIM A LOVE. Praise the
[1:21:39] Lord.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; GIVE US THE CHANCE. YOU just give us the
[1:21:44] chance. Let's grace just give us the
[1:21:46] chance.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And what what is in us is ready to run
[1:21:50] to sin.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The thing that is in us is ready
[1:21:57] to love something that hit God.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; That's what THAT'S WHAT THE SEX BIRTH
[1:22:04] produce
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; that that that law that is within us.
[1:22:11] IT'S READY TO LOVE something that that
[1:22:14] that is against the LAW OF GOD. WELL, WE
[1:22:16] NOT we are not born with THE LOVE OF
[1:22:18] GOD. HOW CAN WE THEN LOVE HIM WITH ALL
[1:22:20] OF OUR HEART?
[1:22:25] Love projects.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; God projects his love and your heart is
[1:22:34] just like a ball that is able to receive
[1:22:40] from the projector.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:46] [clears throat]
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; This Bible is the projector.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And as the word as the word as the love
[1:22:52] for God is being preached from this
[1:22:54] Bible.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Your heart is like the projector string.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And your AND AND AND YOUR HEART IS
[1:23:05] receiving
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; and reflecting and you look here and IT
[1:23:08] SAYS, "OH WOW, GOD LOVES ME. OH WOW.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; That's why the songwriter says, "I'm
[1:23:16] amazed.
[1:23:18] I'm amazed.
[1:23:20] Oh wow.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT
[1:23:26] uh we reduce his love to substance.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF GOD'S LAW WAS
[1:23:34] HIS WORD. YEAH.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; When he condemn when he when he uh was
[1:23:40] condescending when he condensed himself
[1:23:44] he condensed himself into the word that
[1:23:47] is called the logos. That is God's first
[1:23:50] expression.
[1:23:52] HIS FIRST EXPRESSION TO YOU IS NOT
[1:23:55] GIFTS. It's not what he gave you.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not what he GIVES YOU. HIS
[1:24:03] FIRST expression to you is his word.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; He sent forth his word.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And something IN YOUR HEART WAS ABLE TO
[1:24:13] receive it.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand it.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; You keep asking yourself, well, if if if
[1:24:20] you love me, he say, I love you. It's
[1:24:22] written on your heart. I love you. If
[1:24:25] you really love me, why am I wearing
[1:24:27] this clothes?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Why I don't have money? That's that's
[1:24:30] what your mind is thinking.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:33] Praise the Lord. That's what your mind
[1:24:35] is THINKING BECAUSE THE MIND THAT THAT
[1:24:38] IS THE IDOLATRY THAT GOD WAS TELLING THE
[1:24:41] PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE NO OTHER FORM OF
[1:24:44] IDOLATRY IS THE THINGS THAT WERE IN
[1:24:45] THEIR MIND BECAUSE GOD HAS BEEN REVEAL
[1:24:49] REDUCED to substance.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS A PROOF THAT
[1:24:54] GOD LOVE YOU. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS A
[1:24:56] PROOF THAT GOD LOVE YOU.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:04] Are we together?
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Have you cropped the picture?
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; If not, I I'm going to labor a little
[1:25:11] bit.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; If it's not clear to you, let me labor a
[1:25:15] little bit. If it's clear to you, then
[1:25:17] let's pray and go home. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] HOW WE HOW WE GOING to How do we love
[1:25:26] him with our strength?
[1:25:29] How?
[1:25:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Look at this principle again.
[1:25:40] [clears throat]
[1:25:42] The same principle works in this way.
[1:25:46] The principle of a pattern is not a
[1:25:48] pattern
[1:25:49] until it has been accepted.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; As a pattern. That's right.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Like I said many times, the difference
[1:25:56] between God DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL LOVE
[1:25:59] for you because you in church Wednesday
[1:26:01] night
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; and he have a different love for the man
[1:26:04] that is on the street uh uh uh on the
[1:26:06] drugs. No, no.
[1:26:09] God love is not passure.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; There is no partiality in his love.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; But you SEE THE DIFFERENT HERE is that
[1:26:22] uh grace has been given to you
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; to receive.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Grace has been given to you for FOR FOR
[1:26:32] THE LOVE THAT IS PROJECTED TO YOU for it
[1:26:35] to reflect on you and YOU CAN SAY OH WOW
[1:26:37] GOD LOVED ME.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has not he has not THE THE
[1:26:45] SAME LOVE IS PROJECTED to him because h
[1:26:49] the Bible says his blessing fall upon
[1:26:51] the just and the unjust.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; The same grace that woke you up this
[1:26:55] morning is the same grace that woke the
[1:26:58] the the homeless men on the street.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME GRACE THAT WOKE THE GUY
[1:27:06] THAT STONED HIMSELF UP WITH DRUGS AND he
[1:27:08] he didn't even know where he WAS
[1:27:10] SLEEPING. HE WOKE UP IN the morning. He
[1:27:12] just realized that he's up. He can't
[1:27:14] even get up straight.
[1:27:18] It's the same grace.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] When Moses told the people don't not to
[1:27:39] have any graven image. Why? Because
[1:27:43] their God was re was reduced to
[1:27:46] substance.
[1:27:47] They have to have a certain image before
[1:27:49] them for them to realize that this is
[1:27:52] their God.
[1:27:54] Amen.
[1:27:57] And that's WHAT GOD DON'T WANT US TO DO.
[1:27:59] He don't want us to reduce him to
[1:28:01] substance.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; He want US TO SEE HOW HE'S PROJECTING
[1:28:06] his love to us.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Projecting it in our strength and
[1:28:12] projecting it in our mind that we can
[1:28:14] have our right mind. We can have our
[1:28:16] mind on the right things. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And not on the things of of of the word,
[1:28:21] not on perverted things, not on uh uh uh
[1:28:24] things of jealousy and envy.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord tonight.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; The word is shepherd in the two-edged
[1:28:41] sword.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's what the word does.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:46] When the word is preached, when the word
[1:28:48] goes out, it express itself.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; It express itself. The grace
[1:29:01] when love is projected, brother Bannam
[1:29:05] says, then sovereign grace takes over.
[1:29:08] Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; That love of God was projected to the
[1:29:15] word
[1:29:17] just like God so loved the word that he
[1:29:19] gave his only begotten son. This time
[1:29:22] was in a being was in a child that was
[1:29:25] born in the manger.
[1:29:27] THAT WAS GOD'S LOVE THAT WAS EXPRESSED.
[1:29:29] IT WAS PROJECTED TO the world.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; But the people that he was sent on, they
[1:29:34] rejected him. Yes,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; they couldn't see him as the love of
[1:29:38] God.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY ASSOCIATE HIM TO A
[1:29:42] GIRL THAT SAYS SHE WAS MARRIED,
[1:29:45] THE GIRL THAT WAS EXPOSED TO A MAN.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; That's the So, they associate THIS LOVE
[1:29:53] OF GOD, THIS GIFT THAT WAS BORN, THIS
[1:29:56] GIFT THAT WAS ANNOUNCED TO ANGELS ON THE
[1:29:58] HILL. The angels was in the field. I
[1:30:01] mean the shepherds was in the field and
[1:30:03] the angels told them YOUR KING IS BORN
[1:30:06] THERE IN Bethlehem
[1:30:08] and they came and THEY THEY FOUND THE
[1:30:10] PLACE.
[1:30:12] AMEN. And and and and uh and and and and
[1:30:14] THE WORSHIP THE WHOLE NIGHT THEY WERE
[1:30:16] SINGING SONGS. They could see it. WHY?
[1:30:20] BECAUSE THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECTED TO
[1:30:22] THEM AND AND AND HELPED THEM TO SEE THAT
[1:30:25] THIS is the gift of God. Amen.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So they could accept it.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; THE THREE THE THREE WISE MEN THAT WERE
[1:30:35] TRAVELING HAD TO TRAVEL FOR THREE YEARS.
[1:30:38] THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECTED TO THEM
[1:30:40] THROUGH A STAR THAT WAS SHINING.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; THEY COULD ASSOCIATE THAT STAR WITH THE
[1:30:45] WORD OF GOD. A STAR WILL RISE OUT OF
[1:30:48] JACOB.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THE LOVE OF GOD. THEY FOLLOW
[1:30:51] IT. THEY CAME. THEY SAW THE BABY. THEY
[1:30:54] WORSHIP HIM. THEY GIVE HIM GIFTS.
[1:30:58] But all the religious men that were in
[1:31:00] the time says he's an illegitimate
[1:31:02] child.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; With with WITH THE WORD OF GOD OPEN,
[1:31:11] WITH THE TORAH OPEN BEFORE THEM, they
[1:31:14] are reading day and night LOOKING FOR
[1:31:17] THE MESSIAH. HE'S BORN RIGHT BEFORE
[1:31:19] THEM.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And they said he's an illegitimate
[1:31:22] child.
[1:31:28] Praise [clears throat] the Lord.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And yet these guys are trying to love
[1:31:35] God with all of their heart.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] And for them to prove that they are
[1:31:43] loving God WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART, they
[1:31:46] have to wear white garments.
[1:31:49] They have to wash their hands. They have
[1:31:52] to don't do this, do this. They are
[1:31:55] trying to prove. They are trying to keep
[1:31:57] the word.
[1:32:01] AMEN. BUT THE PROMISED BIAH IS BIRTHED
[1:32:05] RIGHT BEFORE THEM.
[1:32:10] And he said he's an illegitimate child.
[1:32:13] How do we love God with all of our
[1:32:15] heart?
[1:32:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:20] How do we
[1:32:24] Is it in our dos and our done? No.
[1:32:29] No. When you really start to
[1:32:33] appreciate
[1:32:35] the love of God.
[1:32:37] Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; When you really start to appreciate the
[1:32:41] love of God, that is not just a word to
[1:32:44] you that God love you, but it's
[1:32:48] something that you feel.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] is something that you feel.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Have you ever got a
[1:32:58] feeling of love?
[1:33:02] Have you ever got a feeling h I just
[1:33:04] listened to brother Brown? You was you
[1:33:06] was uh talking there story about uh uh
[1:33:10] uh
[1:33:12] uh what's the fellow name? Forgetting
[1:33:14] his name here. Just on top of my mind
[1:33:16] here. And uh uh uh you remember the
[1:33:18] story. He you know uh
[1:33:21] his name is just on my mind. Uh he was
[1:33:24] going to work and then uh uh you know he
[1:33:28] and his wife were just talking some
[1:33:30] things in the house and he kissed her
[1:33:31] bad and he left
[1:33:33] and he turned around and came back again
[1:33:35] and you know uh and then he had to kiss
[1:33:38] her for the second time. He said the
[1:33:40] second one high feeling in it.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because as he was going to work, he
[1:33:43] was thinking, "Oh my she's sad. Why is
[1:33:48] something happen and I don't come back?"
[1:33:51] Or why is something happen to her when
[1:33:53] I'm gone?
[1:33:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of those thoughts in his
[1:33:59] mind make him to turn around and he went
[1:34:02] back home. He never said nothing to her
[1:34:04] that, "Oh, I'm sorry." He didn't settle
[1:34:06] nothing. He just kissed her for the
[1:34:08] second time and then he left.
[1:34:10] But this time she was not behind the
[1:34:12] door crying. She came outside and she
[1:34:14] never say anything. She just wave by
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and he says that one had feelings in it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; You see because we because uh we have
[1:34:28] associated the love of God with with
[1:34:31] with with substance with things
[1:34:34] we go many times not feeling the love of
[1:34:38] God.
[1:34:40] not feeling his love that is projected
[1:34:42] towards us.
[1:34:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Have you Have you ever got to that place
[1:34:48] where you you you really feel?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; To feel his love.
[1:35:06] to really feel his love and think
[1:35:11] what did I do that I deserve his love?
[1:35:15] Why among the millions of people on
[1:35:17] earth
[1:35:24] praise the Lord?
[1:35:33] Do we ever get to that place?
[1:35:38] You see, because love
[1:35:41] has been has has lost its meaning and it
[1:35:45] has been put into substance. The very
[1:35:48] same thing. Our children don't feel that
[1:35:51] we love them until we buy something for
[1:35:53] them. They always have to be something.
[1:35:55] Some kind of a thing has to be given for
[1:35:57] a person to feel that they are love.
[1:36:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:05] Love must always be associated to some
[1:36:07] kind of an act.
[1:36:10] But just think about the thought of it.
[1:36:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:22] Are you with me tonight or I've lost
[1:36:24] you?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; I hope I didn't do that because uh it
[1:36:30] won't be a good thing. And then we have
[1:36:31] to preach this for the second time
[1:36:32] again. Amen.
[1:36:34] And I will have problem doing it because
[1:36:36] uh uh I I really wanted to go home.
[1:36:40] God projected us. Lord, the Bible says
[1:36:43] while we were yet sinners,
[1:36:46] while we were yet sinners, not one good
[1:36:49] work has come out of us.
[1:36:53] While we were yet sinners,
[1:36:57] he love us.
[1:36:59] He love us.
[1:37:03] Do we feel the love that is projected
[1:37:06] towards us?
[1:37:09] Do we feel it?
[1:37:13] Do we feel God love that is projected
[1:37:15] towards us? When we look around us, we
[1:37:18] look at the people he he puts in our
[1:37:20] life. We look at the things that he has
[1:37:22] brought us out of. Do we feel it?
[1:37:26] Praise the Lord. Have you ever got to
[1:37:28] that place where I mean you are just hit
[1:37:31] with the love of God? You feel like you
[1:37:33] don't deserve it and it it just it just
[1:37:35] break you down and and you just say the
[1:37:38] Lord why why you love me like this.
[1:37:45] Praise the Lord. You see because uh uh
[1:37:49] uh uh the love for God has been has been
[1:37:51] reduced to substance. NO MATTER HOW MUCH
[1:37:55] GOD GAVE US,
[1:37:58] we just appreciate it for a little while
[1:38:00] and yet we want more
[1:38:05] and then we looking we're looking
[1:38:07] through the the looking to the next door
[1:38:09] where the next gift is coming from.
[1:38:10] We're looking for where where is the
[1:38:12] next thing is coming from.
[1:38:14] But the first expression of his love was
[1:38:18] a word. That's why brother Brandon says
[1:38:20] that they will never know until you say
[1:38:22] it to them. I love you. It's gone from
[1:38:25] our society.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it must always be it must
[1:38:30] either be a flower or it must be a
[1:38:32] bottle of water or it must be something
[1:38:34] uh you know uh uh UH AND JUST THAT
[1:38:38] EXPRESSION OF I love you
[1:38:43] to say it and mean it and feel it.
[1:38:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:51] And that is the same way WE HAVE TO PUT
[1:38:54] SOME KIND OF A religious act or give
[1:38:57] SOME SOME SOME MONEY INTO THE CHURCH or
[1:39:00] or DO SOMETHING IN THE SERVICE OF GOD to
[1:39:03] really prove that we love God. Can you
[1:39:06] get down and just tell him I love you?
[1:39:10] Say it to him, I love you. And really
[1:39:13] mean it and feel it.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And feel it.
[1:39:20] Tell him you love him without
[1:39:22] associating anything to it.
[1:39:26] BECAUSE WHEN HE EXPRESS HIS LOVE TO YOU,
[1:39:29] WHEN HE SAID HE LOVE YOU, HE NEVER
[1:39:32] THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING ELSE. He just love
[1:39:34] you.
[1:39:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:55] When love is projected,
[1:40:04] can you really be able to project? Can
[1:40:07] we be able to project love from our
[1:40:09] heart by just expressing it?
[1:40:13] Not taking on anything because the devil
[1:40:15] is going to blow your mind and and he's
[1:40:18] going to bring all the nasty thing you
[1:40:20] have done and and and and and how uh uh
[1:40:23] uh ungrateful you are and your mind will
[1:40:25] just go that it even becomes heavy to
[1:40:29] say I love you.
[1:40:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:36] It's almost like it becomes heavy for
[1:40:38] the man to tell his wife, I love you.
[1:40:45] Even if there is no flower, there is no
[1:40:47] candy, there is nothing,
[1:40:49] it must be our first expression.
[1:40:54] It must be something that that that that
[1:40:57] projects out of us that even if you
[1:41:00] don't say it, the feeling the mutual
[1:41:03] feeling can be there. You can feel it.
[1:41:09] A child must be able to feel that from
[1:41:12] from from their parents. [snorts]
[1:41:14] It must not always be in gifts
[1:41:19] or something done. The feeling just that
[1:41:22] feeling
[1:41:27] what a parent can look in the eye of the
[1:41:29] child and and and both hearts is beating
[1:41:32] together. love is being projected.
[1:41:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:39] Because sometimes that's what God does
[1:41:42] in the midst of everything that we are
[1:41:44] going through. We you see it as a
[1:41:46] problem. You see it as a struggle. But
[1:41:49] he he's just his heart is just beating
[1:41:52] towards you. I love you. Can you see
[1:41:54] that? I love you.
[1:41:57] Malachi chapter 1, Israel struggle with
[1:41:59] that.
[1:42:01] God came and told them how he loved
[1:42:02] them. They says, "How can you love? ARE
[1:42:04] WE JUST FROM CAPTIVITY? HOW CAN A GOD
[1:42:07] THAT LOVE HIS PEOPLE ALLOW them to go
[1:42:09] into captivity?
[1:42:12] They could not wrap their mind around it
[1:42:15] BECAUSE THE HUMAN MIND, THE WAY THE
[1:42:17] HUMAN MIND UNDERSTAND LOVE, it must
[1:42:20] always be wrapped in some kind of a
[1:42:23] paper with shiny stuff on it.
[1:42:26] Even if it is from dollar tree, just
[1:42:28] wrap it with some kind of a shiny thing
[1:42:31] on it.
[1:42:33] That's how the human mind understand
[1:42:34] love.
[1:42:37] But with God
[1:42:40] is an expression.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; It's an expression.
[1:42:46] It's an expression. Sometimes he said he
[1:42:49] says it in a way. He says it in a
[1:42:52] silence. I love you all.
[1:42:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; It's just like you you you you behind
[1:43:02] the the the the the the glass door or
[1:43:04] the glass window and you just I love
[1:43:07] you. I love you.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; The kids will blow kisses. I love you.
[1:43:15] Let the love go.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Sometime that's what GOD IS DOING. HE'S
[1:43:20] JUST BLOWING his love, blowing kisses to
[1:43:23] you. And we just looking at things
[1:43:26] around us. Everything looks oh,
[1:43:28] everything looks the same and everything
[1:43:30] looks
[1:43:32] how how is God love me
[1:43:36] because we have reduced the love of God
[1:43:39] to perishable things.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; But when God love you, he send you his
[1:43:48] word.
[1:43:50] And that word goes there and it restore
[1:43:53] your soul.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; It goes and gets your mind straight.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; It starts to identify your
[1:44:02] characteristics
[1:44:04] as he exposes his characteristics to
[1:44:06] you. HE TRIED TO IDENTIFY YOUR OWN
[1:44:09] CHARACTERISTICS, SHOW YOU YOUR
[1:44:11] ABILITIES, SHOW YOU YOUR PURPOSE.
[1:44:19] When love is projected,
[1:44:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:26] When love is projected,
[1:44:32] if you really think about it, if you
[1:44:34] think about it, you find bunch of
[1:44:36] Christians, it's something that they
[1:44:39] they they they can't remember the last
[1:44:41] time where they said it in their prayer,
[1:44:43] Lord, I love you.
[1:44:46] We can call all his great name. You are
[1:44:48] Jehovah Jara. You are the alpha and
[1:44:50] omega. YOU ARE THE ALMIGHTY GOD. You you
[1:44:52] can we can say all of that. Give him all
[1:44:54] the praises and he will never still feel
[1:44:57] love. Why? Because you don't say it.
[1:45:03] We can show GOD ALL THE GREAT ARTS.
[1:45:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:14] It's a beautiful thing.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing.
[1:45:19] Even when God takes us through trials,
[1:45:22] what he want us to hear is I love you.
[1:45:28] When you hear that, when you hear that
[1:45:31] in difficulties, if you can be able TO
[1:45:33] HEAR THE VOICE OF God saying I love you
[1:45:36] in difficult, no matter what you are
[1:45:38] going through, it will not stand to your
[1:45:41] face. because you begin to feel his
[1:45:43] love. Now you have a purpose attached to
[1:45:48] your trial. You see it not as a trial
[1:45:51] but you see it as God love expressed to
[1:45:54] you
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; because you hear it in a way. I love you
[1:46:07] project
[1:46:08] will continue another time. Amen.
[1:46:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; How do we love him with all of our
[1:46:16] heart?
[1:46:18] It's not you loving him with all of your
[1:46:20] heart. Is you receiving
[1:46:22] the love that he has projected to you.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; It's you receiving it. It's you
[1:46:28] embracing it.
[1:46:31] It's you embracing it. Having an inner
[1:46:35] feeling
[1:46:36] that is not associated to church. It's
[1:46:39] not associated to certain belief. But
[1:46:41] you know that God loved me.
[1:46:44] I know he loved me.
[1:46:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:50] I know he loved me. I can feel it. It's
[1:46:53] becoming real to me.
[1:46:56] It's now in substance.
[1:46:58] Praise the Lord. That's why those people
[1:47:00] who go they could go to the to the death
[1:47:03] port
[1:47:04] singing song to God. They are going to
[1:47:06] their death.
[1:47:09] Why? Because they fear his love.
[1:47:14] They fear that it was an honorable
[1:47:15] thing. It was a love of God. There was a
[1:47:17] way of themh expressing their love back
[1:47:20] to him. Having a fellowship of his
[1:47:23] death.
[1:47:26] And if there is one thing that we need
[1:47:30] is the love of God.
[1:47:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:35] Is the love of God. Not just as a
[1:47:38] subject, the love of God where we can be
[1:47:42] able to express it to him.
[1:47:44] You express it, you feel it, and you say
[1:47:47] to him, "Lord, I love you. I love you. I
[1:47:50] love you. I love [clears throat] you."
[1:47:53] It's is it's tangible.
[1:47:56] Thank you for loving me.
[1:48:03] Lord bless you tonight. Let the
[1:48:04] musicians come forward. Let's pray.
[1:48:05] Let's bow our heads and pray tonight.
[1:48:07] [snorts]
[1:48:10] Heavenly Father, dear Lord, and just
[1:48:14] thank Sunday Lord that just just had
[1:48:16] this thought on my mind and just been
[1:48:18] laboring with it. Father, oh God,
[1:48:28] just like that song says, Lord,
[1:48:32] we never really never get to know.
[1:48:34] Sometimes we become so so religious in
[1:48:37] our mind because I'm the bride of
[1:48:39] Christ, because I'm predestinated. Those
[1:48:42] are just those are just things that we
[1:48:44] are repeating that we have heard.
[1:48:49] Father, I can say tonight, boy, many of
[1:48:52] us can say,
[1:48:57] we really don't know why you love us.
[1:49:02] Brother Bannon said, if a man find a
[1:49:04] wife that he love and he don't know why,
[1:49:07] and she found a husband that she love
[1:49:11] and she don't know why,
[1:49:15] he says, uh, he says that's that's
[1:49:18] internal. He said that's internate. Now
[1:49:21] you think about it. If that is in the
[1:49:24] natural, how much more
[1:49:27] about inner spiritual
[1:49:35] heavenly father
[1:49:38] Lord you said in your word that God
[1:49:42] iniquity would abound and the love of
[1:49:44] God will wise cold.
[1:49:46] We living in such a time Lord where
[1:49:48] people are gone away from the love of
[1:49:50] God. We love church. We love our pastor.
[1:49:55] We love our friends. We love our family.
[1:49:59] But father God,
[1:50:04] we need to get back Lord God to loving
[1:50:06] you.
[1:50:17] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:25] Father, teach us, Lord. Teach us, oh
[1:50:28] God,
[1:50:31] to learn to tell you that we love you.
[1:50:35] Teach us, Lord, to learn to [music] tell
[1:50:37] the people around us that we love them.
[1:50:41] It must not be difficult for us to tell
[1:50:43] our wives, our husband. It must not be
[1:50:45] difficult for us to tell our parents. It
[1:50:48] must not be a ceremonious thing.
[1:50:50] It must be a half a thing.
[1:50:54] When you tell your children, I love you,
[1:51:03] Father. Lord I pray tonight [music]
[1:51:06] may we feel the love of God that's being
[1:51:08] projected to us Lord
[1:51:12] by sending your word by sending your
[1:51:14] word the message of the hour many time
[1:51:17] we don't see that as the love of God we
[1:51:19] [music] see that as rules we see that
[1:51:22] Lord Father as rules as as as uh
[1:51:25] commandments Lord [music] Father glory
[1:51:35] Every day my heart [music and singing]
[1:51:37] will praise him.
[1:51:40] Oh, I know
[1:51:43] I will [music] never be for
[1:51:50] all I want to do [music]
[1:51:53] is love.

[1:51:56] is all [music]
[1:51:59] lately.
[1:52:03] Oh, [singing]
[1:52:04] all I want to do [music]
[1:52:07] is just love.
[1:52:12] I'm so glad I feel [singing and music]
[1:52:14] your love for me.
[1:52:19] Jesus, [music]
[1:52:20] paid the price of my redemption.

[1:53:20] Thank you, Father.
[1:53:22] Thank you for your love.

[1:53:27] over us, that protect us. The love of
[1:53:29] God that provide for us.
[1:53:33] Thank you, [music] Father. Lord,

[1:54:01] religious [music] ideas, Lord Father

[1:54:36] [music]
[1:54:38] I'm so glad I feel his [singing] glory.
[1:54:45] Jesus paid the price [music]
[1:54:48] of my redemption [singing]
[1:54:52] on the [music] cross of Calary.
[1:54:58] Oh, every day my heart will praise him.
[1:55:04] [singing]
[1:55:06] I know I will never [music] be the same.
[1:55:14] All I want to [singing] do [music]
[1:55:16] is lovely.
[1:55:22] [singing]
[1:55:24] [music]
[1:55:26] Oh, all I want to [singing and music] do
[1:55:30] is just love me.
[1:55:34] I'm so glad [singing] I feel your love
[1:55:37] [music] for me.
[1:55:41] Jesus [singing]
[1:55:42] paid the price of redemption [music]
[1:55:48] on the cross of Calary.
[1:55:55] So [singing and music] every day my
[1:55:57] heart will praise him.
[1:56:01] [music] I know I will never [singing] be
[1:56:05] the same.
[1:56:09] All I [singing] want to [music] do is

[1:56:47] Lord God, our abilities, Lord, our
[1:56:50] failures, Lord Jesus, we want to love
[1:56:53] you.
[1:56:55] While we were yet sinners, [music] you
[1:56:56] love us,
[1:56:59] oh God. We thank you tonight.
[1:57:03] We thank [music] you tonight.
[1:57:05] A moment like this.
[1:57:09] A moment [music]
[1:57:11] like this.
[1:57:15] I will [music and singing] sing out a
[1:57:19] song.
[1:57:21] Oh, I will sing [singing and music]
[1:57:24] out
[1:57:25] a long song to Jesus.
[1:57:32] [music]
[1:57:34] Oh, [singing]
[1:57:36] moment
[1:57:37] [music]
[1:57:38] like this.
[1:57:41] I will be for
[1:57:44] [singing and music] my hands.
[1:57:48] I will lift up [music] my hands
[1:57:52] [singing] to
[1:57:55] the Lord.
[1:57:57] Singing I love you.
[1:58:00] Singing
[1:58:02] I [music]
[1:58:05] love [singing]
[1:58:07] [music]
[1:58:08] you Lord.
[1:58:10] Oh hallelujah.
[1:58:14] Sing [singing and music]
[1:58:19] Lord
[1:58:20] [music and singing]
[1:58:21] you Lord.
[1:58:26] Oh, [music] sing it th
[1:58:35] [singing] you
[1:58:39] love [music]
[1:58:40] [singing]
[1:58:42] I
[1:58:45] love
[1:58:49] you.
[1:58:50] I listen to a [music] story of a
[1:58:53] Japanese girl that was testifying.
[1:58:56] You know, their culture is just [music]
[1:58:58] it's full of discipline, full of
[1:59:00] respect. You bow your heads down.
[1:59:03] But she said [music]
[1:59:07] they could never say I love you. She
[1:59:10] never saw her father telling the mother
[1:59:12] I love you or the father telling [music]
[1:59:14] the children I love you. It was
[1:59:16] something that was not in their culture.
[1:59:19] So she was always shocked when [music]
[1:59:22] she saw people saying I love you.
[1:59:27] And the first time that she told her dad
[1:59:29] that I love you,
[1:59:32] they went [music] silent on on the phone
[1:59:35] for the long time dead silent when he
[1:59:38] when she [music] just told her, "Dad, I
[1:59:41] love you." He couldn't say a word to
[1:59:44] her. [music] She didn't know what to say
[1:59:46] next.
[1:59:52] And then after a while the silence broke
[1:59:54] and they [music] started talking. The
[1:59:56] dad did not really responded I love you
[1:59:58] too because he had never done it in this
[2:00:01] life
[2:00:07] to him. The daughter don't need to say I
[2:00:09] love you because she [music] can kneel
[2:00:11] down, she can bow her heads. She's
[2:00:13] respectful.
[2:00:16] But then after the period of time,
[2:00:17] [music]
[2:00:19] she realized how
[2:00:21] that simple expression of I love you
[2:00:24] changed their family [music] dynamics
[2:00:27] tremendously.
[2:00:30] Every time she talked to her dad, she
[2:00:32] was says I love you dad.
[2:00:35] And then he started beginning to say I
[2:00:36] love you [music] too. And it just
[2:00:39] changed their family dynamics.
[2:00:44] things that they will fuss about started
[2:00:47] becoming [music] easy to understand.
[2:00:51] And that's how we understand the love of
[2:00:53] God. That's how we understand the word
[2:00:54] of God. The things that God required us
[2:00:57] when we see it through the eyes of love.
[2:01:04] [music] It changed the picture. It
[2:01:06] changed the relationship.
[2:01:09] [music]
[2:01:12] The Lord bless you. I'll see you on
[2:01:14] Sunday.
[2:01:23] Oh [music and singing] yes, I
[2:01:28] love [singing]
[2:01:31] you.
[2:01:33] [music]
[2:01:34] Oh, [singing]
[2:01:35] sing it. I
[2:01:41] [singing and music] love
[2:01:43] you all.
[2:01:47] [music]
[2:01:48] Oh, sing [singing] it. I
[2:01:54] love
[2:01:57] you, Lord.
