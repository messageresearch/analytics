[21:45] perished
[21:48] like you.
[21:54] Lord, who [singing] else can [music]
[21:57] touch my heart like you do?
[22:04] I could search throughout
[22:08] eternality, [singing and music]
[22:09] Lord,
[22:11] and find [music and singing]
[22:14] there is no
[22:16] like. Let's sing that one more time.
[22:18] There's none like you.
[22:21] [music]
[22:23] There is no like [singing]
[22:26] you,
[22:29] oh Jesus. [music]
[22:32] No [singing] one else can touch my heart
[22:36] like you [music] do.
[22:41] I could search [singing]
[22:43] for all eternal deep
[22:48] [music]
[22:49] and find
[22:51] there is no [music] like you.
[22:56] Just before we pray, I just want to read
[22:59] this and uh [music]
[23:00] uh get it get it off my note. That will
[23:04] be the first code there in second
[23:06] coming. Brother [music] Brandon shared
[23:07] this. Now when we used to have our
[23:09] meetings, this was uh this was the team
[23:13] of our meeting. That's why we were using
[23:15] you can put it up. That's we were using
[23:17] that code [music] for the team of our
[23:19] meeting. But Ram says
[23:22] when that time comes, [music] when the
[23:24] church find its brother involved, when
[23:27] the church find its holy decency, when
[23:31] the church find its place in Christ, it
[23:34] will call to the other members of the
[23:36] body, come and rejoice with us. God want
[23:41] his church to love him. Amen. [music]
[23:45] Praise the Lord. So uh this gone Sunday
[23:48] we were talking a little bit on uh uh
[23:50] church church church [music] discipline
[23:52] and uh we we will continue if as the
[23:55] Lord will continue to inspire us. But
[23:57] just like we were trying to [music] say
[23:59] that you know uh we we brought that
[24:02] thought just to be able to remind us
[24:04] [music]
[24:05] we're living in such a time where there
[24:07] is just a great pressure uh uh on on
[24:10] God's people and uh uh not not only only
[24:15] us as an assembly is is [music] with the
[24:17] the bride of Jesus Christ around the
[24:19] world God's people everywhere dealing
[24:21] with one thing or another is either
[24:23] family thing or the financial thing or a
[24:27] health thing. I mean, the devil knowing
[24:29] that his time is out. He's throwing
[24:31] everything that [music] he can at God's
[24:33] people. Praise the Lord. But you see, we
[24:36] have a commission uh uh from the Lord uh
[24:38] that we we have to brother Brandon in
[24:41] talking here, he was talking about that
[24:43] woman that lost her queen. She was
[24:45] sweeping all [music] over the place to
[24:46] try to find it. And that is the place
[24:49] you have to realize that brotherly
[24:50] kindness, it is [music] it is the call
[24:53] for our age. That is our place in the
[24:55] capstone. Amen. That brotherly kindness,
[24:58] we know that we gone into the eth. We
[25:00] can talk about all of that. But uh uh we
[25:03] also see that [music] uh we we we we
[25:07] have to find our holy decency. We have
[25:10] to get back to that place where the
[25:12] house of God [music] is a decent place
[25:14] where our thoughts and our our motives
[25:17] and and our objectives of coming to
[25:19] [music] church is just purely on the
[25:21] word and also the church finding its
[25:25] place in Christ. And brother Benam says
[25:28] and [music] then the rapture we go when

[38:00] Hebrews chapter 4. Let's read from verse
[38:02] 14. And then we will go just roll down
[38:06] into chapter 5.
[38:08] Chapter 14. Seeing then that we have a
[38:11] great high priest that is passed into
[38:15] the heaven. Jesus the son of God. Let us
[38:20] hold fast our profession. Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben said is the same word
[38:25] confession. Yeah. Hold fast our
[38:27] confession. Hold fast our profession.
[38:30] For we have not an high priest which
[38:33] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[38:36] our infirmities. Amen. But was in all
[38:40] point tempted like as we are yet without
[38:45] sin. Amen.
[38:46] He can be touched by the feelings of our
[38:49] infirmities
[38:50] and also he was tempted in every way.
[38:55] Whatever we are going through, he was in
[38:57] a body system elements,
[39:01] he could feel it. Amen.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; He could feed it. He felt hungry.
[39:09] He felt sick. He felt lonely. He felt uh
[39:13] forsaking. Verse
[39:17] 16. Let us therefore come boldly
[39:20] &gt;&gt; unto the throne of grace that we may
[39:23] obtain mercy and find grace in help.
[39:28] Grace to help in time of need.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight. Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; This is a time of need and we need that
[39:37] grace to help us. Chapter 5 verse one.
[39:40] For every high priest taken from among
[39:44] men is ordained for man in things
[39:48] pertaining to God, that he may offer
[39:51] both gifts and sacrifices for sin. Who
[39:55] who can have compassion on the ignorant,
[39:58] the high priest can, and on them that
[40:01] are out of the way, for that he himself
[40:04] also is compassed with infirmities.
[40:09] Praise the Lord.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; And by reason of he ought as for the
[40:15] people, so also for himself to offer
[40:21] for sin.
[40:23] Praise the Lord.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And no man taketh this honor unto
[40:28] himself,
[40:30] but he that is called of God
[40:34] as also Aaron. Father, bless your word.
[40:38] is your internal word. May you just drop
[40:41] thoughts in our hearts tonight.
[40:43] Something that will comfort us, that
[40:44] will strengthen us, talks that will draw
[40:47] us closer to you. In Jesus name we pray.
[40:51] Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[40:53] your seat. You know when uh like we have
[40:56] said before, when Jesus said to the
[40:58] woman, you know, uh uh uh go and sin no
[41:02] more. When he says, neither do I condemn
[41:05] thee. go and sin no more. Jesus was not
[41:08] just telling the woman uh uh uh don't
[41:12] what you did don't do it again. No,
[41:13] that's not what he was telling her. But
[41:16] he was giving uh divine command in her
[41:18] life that uh you have just been released
[41:22] from guilt.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; You have also been released from the
[41:25] thing that was holding you that was
[41:27] bounding you. Praise the Lord. So I
[41:29] believe that this word have enough power
[41:32] that it can be preached to us and it can
[41:34] free us from whatever that is bothering
[41:37] us. Amen.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; It has enough power you know to uh to
[41:41] come right to that dividing that sunder
[41:44] of our soul and spirit our mind and and
[41:47] and and our entire inner being and and
[41:50] and be able to help us. That's that's
[41:52] how much power I believe that is in the
[41:55] word. Praise the Lord. Tonight we want
[41:57] to look at uh a little thought that we
[41:59] want to we we want to call the high
[42:02] priest of our confession.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; We want to look at the high priest of
[42:05] our confession. But uh what I want to do
[42:09] uh because I don't want to I don't want
[42:11] to be too far away from what we were
[42:13] talking about. Uh, I want to I want to I
[42:16] want to bring uh us back to to uh uh
[42:20] just just keep us in the cycles of what
[42:23] we we we've been speaking about uh of
[42:26] the anointing and the riders and the
[42:29] seven spirits and the seven eyes. I I
[42:32] want to just keep us right in there. But
[42:34] there's something that I want to share
[42:35] with you tonight. And and the reason why
[42:38] I want to I'm speaking on this trying to
[42:41] bring it, you know, from u uh Sunday
[42:44] service talking about church discipline
[42:47] [clears throat]
[42:48] and uh uh we just found that way to be
[42:51] able to to uh uh uh you know give
[42:55] ourself a title and just to be able to
[42:57] talk to ourself a little bit. You know
[42:59] when we had that church meeting where we
[43:01] shut down from service there were just a
[43:04] whole lot that was on my mind. I was I
[43:06] was really burning and there were things
[43:08] that I wanted to talk about but uh again
[43:11] I I I was I was just I was just saying
[43:14] Lord uh uh uh you know help me and I
[43:17] want to bring these things so the people
[43:19] can get under it. They can they can be
[43:21] able to get under the burden of what is
[43:24] on my heart to see to be able to
[43:26] understand that the I mean uh this is
[43:29] not just a social gathering. Amen. We
[43:31] have a responsibility. We have a divine
[43:35] commission from God. Amen. Praise the
[43:37] Lord. We have a divine commission from
[43:40] God. I don't know what about other
[43:42] assembly in Minneapolis, but I believe
[43:45] this little assembly on this corner of
[43:48] the street 6900
[43:50] uh Humble Avenue have a divine
[43:53] commission. Amen. And and and our
[43:56] responsibility here is to quiet the
[43:58] spirit in Minneapolis. Amen.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; It's our responsibility. Praise the
[44:02] Lord. Like I said, I'm not responsible
[44:04] for other groups and you know and what
[44:06] they are doing and what they are
[44:07] preaching, but I believe that we have a
[44:10] divine responsibility to stand in the
[44:13] gap to pray for our city, pray for our
[44:15] people, pray for the the believers that
[44:18] are everywhere around the city,
[44:19] everywhere around the the country, you
[44:22] know, and uh uh you know uh that's
[44:25] that's our commission. Praise the Lord.
[44:27] And for us to do that, we have to equip
[44:31] ourself. Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; We have to fortify ourself.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Because if we take on that
[44:37] responsibility, if we as a church say we
[44:40] are responsible for this city, praise
[44:43] the Lord, to be able to lift up the name
[44:45] of Jesus Christ just from this little
[44:47] corner. If we take on that
[44:49] responsibility, I'm telling you, every
[44:52] devil in this city is going to turn
[44:54] against us. Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They say they have a
[44:58] Buddhist temple. It has a haricrishna
[45:01] temple. You if you if you you really
[45:03] don't know about Minneapolis. Amen. You
[45:06] really don't know about Minneapolis. I
[45:08] mean you have mean bunch of adult places
[45:11] all around this place. All around this
[45:13] city. Praise the Lord. And uh uh you
[45:17] know uh uh uh and and just just a whole
[45:19] lot. Praise the Lord. Just a whole lot.
[45:21] I mean you go you drive downtown in some
[45:23] of these places you just see you see you
[45:26] just see the spirits in all of his
[45:27] colors.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; So if we are taking on that
[45:31] responsibility which of course we are
[45:33] taking on it.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't want to be part of it
[45:37] then you you can draw your lines but we
[45:39] are taking on Amen. And uh uh uh because
[45:42] because you see you just you just cannot
[45:46] play a fair neighbor with the devil.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; If if Satan is your neighbor, you cannot
[45:54] play fair neighbor with him.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because every morning
[45:58] when you get up, he move he move his f
[46:01] closer to your house.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, you know, I'm just
[46:08] planting some flowers. It's just the
[46:10] flowers that is crossing over. You You
[46:12] cannot play the fair neighbor. You got
[46:14] to cut those flowers down." Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; You got to cut it down. Cut it down from
[46:18] the root.
[46:20] and push him back to his boundaries.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; So you I mean you we we cannot play
[46:29] niceness in this age.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; And I think that is the thing that we've
[46:32] been trying to do.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean we've been know you
[46:36] know uh you know just just a kind of a
[46:39] church of uh uh uh you know an inclusive
[46:42] group and uh and we start allowing all
[46:45] our young people to start misbehaving.
[46:48] Watch boys here coming with their hairs
[46:50] all flying in the air and we see them
[46:53] and they are sitting there and it's not
[46:55] even helping them. It's not like they
[46:57] are doing those things asking for help.
[46:59] They are doing it and gradually growing
[47:02] away from God,
[47:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; They grow their hair wide. They pierce
[47:06] their ears and and and all and they are
[47:08] gradually going away from the Lord.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; And I mean we just want to be nice to
[47:13] them and and and it is not it is not
[47:16] helping us,
[47:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:18] is not helping them either.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; It's not helping them.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; We must tell them that it's not right.
[47:27] We love them, but it's not right.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh let's let's talk about the
[47:39] high priest tonight. Our high priest.
[47:42] and and and I my my I'm actually taking
[47:44] this from Zach uh uh Zechariah chapter
[47:47] 3. Let's go to Zechariah chapter 3.
[47:50] That's where we want to read from
[47:51] tonight. We just read uh uh uh Hebrew as
[47:56] our scripture reading. But actually in
[47:58] Zechariah chapter 3, the the Lord used
[48:03] Zachchariah to be able to to show
[48:06] something to the house of Israel.
[48:10] the uh uh uh and and and because if you
[48:12] study the book of Zacharias, Zachcharias
[48:16] had eight vision. Eight successive
[48:19] vision in one night. The whole book of
[48:22] of Zachariah he's telling us those
[48:25] visions he had. It was eight successive
[48:28] vision he had in one night.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says one vision
[48:32] will kill you.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you think about a man having
[48:36] eight visions
[48:38] &gt;&gt; in one night. Now, but uh uh uh uh now
[48:43] so so watch this now as as we go along
[48:46] here. If you remember from our our study
[48:48] last week, we were talking on the seven
[48:51] spirits. Uh we read in Revelation
[48:53] chapter 5, Revelation chapter 4,
[48:55] Revelation chapter 3. We you know we we
[48:58] kind of trace that. But something we
[49:00] read from the church ages a single copy
[49:02] book says now the seven spirits that are
[49:05] before God. These seven spirit was
[49:08] represented
[49:10] as the seven spirit that went that will
[49:14] be sent forth for the church ages. Seven
[49:19] spirit before God. We could pick up we
[49:23] could we could pick up from the Old
[49:26] Testament and pick it out there if we
[49:30] just had time. Praise the Lord. So he's
[49:33] telling us there is a representation of
[49:36] the seven spirit over in the in the new
[49:39] in the Old Testament if we have time.
[49:41] Last Wednesday we went back. We read
[49:44] from Chronicles where the Bible talks
[49:46] about the eyes of God moving to and
[49:48] forth, you know, uh uh uh uh the prophet
[49:50] was warning that king. You are relying
[49:53] on the armor of flesh. You are taking
[49:55] you know uh uh uh your eyes from on the
[49:58] Lord. So uh uh uh that's what we want to
[50:01] stay in that thought. Oh, I just I pray
[50:04] that the Lord will be able to help me
[50:06] tonight to be able to bring this to you.
[50:09] Praise the Lord.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so let's go to to to uh
[50:12] Zachcharias chapter 3 and we read from
[50:15] there. And he's showing Joshua. Now,
[50:18] Zachcharias is having a vision and he's
[50:22] in this vision, he's seeing Joshua the
[50:25] high priest. This is not Joshua the son
[50:27] of Noah.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; No, not the Joshua that was with Moses.
[50:30] This is a different Joshua. Now, this
[50:33] time in Israel history, they they have
[50:36] come from Babylon.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. they have come from Babylon. Uh uh
[50:41] uh at this time the Joshua with Moses
[50:43] was from Egypt. This Joshua is from
[50:45] Babylon. So he showed me Joshua the high
[50:48] priest standing before the angel of the
[50:51] Lord and Satan standing at his right
[50:56] hand to resist him. Joshua I mean
[51:00] Zachcharias is having this vision. He's
[51:02] seeing uh Joshua the high priest
[51:05] standing before the Lord as a high
[51:07] priest. That is his position. He had to
[51:10] stand before the Lord, pray for the
[51:12] people, stand before the Lord confess
[51:15] the people's sin in order of them. Now
[51:18] look at this picture carefully. Joshua
[51:21] means Jehovah savior.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; So in another sense, Jesus
[51:29] means Joshua.
[51:32] Okay.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's the reason why we we
[51:38] rar account to talk about our high
[51:40] priest, Jesus, the son of God. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because that is what is
[51:45] being represented here. But uh uh as we
[51:49] go along, you'll be able to see it
[51:50] because it shows our high priest Jesus
[51:54] Christ. It also show sometimes
[51:59] what the ministry goes through.
[52:04] Praise the Lord.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Because the fight for ministry, the
[52:08] pastor of the local church
[52:11] works closely in the office of the high
[52:13] priest.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; He works closely in the office of the
[52:21] Old Testament high priest.
[52:24] He's supposed to be he's supposed to be
[52:26] uh uh at the altar, you know, standing
[52:28] and and and uh uh uh for the people, you
[52:31] know, uh praying and and consecrating
[52:33] himself. You see, uh uh uh the the the
[52:37] New Testament church is uh is uh is
[52:42] structure a little bit different and you
[52:44] know and God deals with with people in
[52:47] their calling very different ways. But
[52:51] you know uh uh when when it comes over
[52:54] to the things of God, let me tell you
[52:58] there is no there is no h a a part-time
[53:01] service in God. It has to be a full-time
[53:05] service.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It has to be a full-time service. I
[53:10] believe that every man of God supposed
[53:12] to be fulltime dedicated to the word of
[53:16] God, dedicated to the service of God.
[53:18] Not only the word, giving himself to the
[53:20] word, giving himself to prayers, and
[53:23] also standing in the gap of the people.
[53:25] I will show you a picture here as as we
[53:27] go along. Now, here is Joshua the high
[53:30] priest standing before the angel of the
[53:32] Lord
[53:34] &gt;&gt; and Satan standing at his right hand to
[53:37] resist him. And the Lord said unto
[53:39] Satan,
[53:41] And the Lord said unto Satan, the Lord
[53:44] rebuked thee, oh Satan.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Even the Lord that have chosen
[53:50] Jerusalem. Now Jerusalem, choosing
[53:53] Jerusalem, a city that is choosing is a
[53:56] is a type of a choosing woman. Is a type
[53:59] of a choosing bride.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; So Jerusalem here is typing the bride.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; So, uh, uh, Joshua, I mean, uh,
[54:12] Zachariah is in this vision and in his
[54:15] vision, he's seeing the high priest
[54:17] standing before the Lord. He's in his
[54:20] position of service.
[54:23] But also in the vision, he's also seeing
[54:27] the enemy trying to resist him,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; trying to attack him.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Now, it is not Joshua that is saying the
[54:41] Lord rebuked thee.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; No, he's not the one saying it, but it
[54:47] is the law that is rebuking the devil.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Now, this man, he's in his post of duty.
[54:54] He's doing his work.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And the enemy, it's not like he's seeing
[55:00] the enemy. Zachariah in his vision is
[55:03] seeing this but Joshua is not seeing
[55:05] what is happening.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can only identify the devil by
[55:13] the by his characteristics.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; The Lord [clears throat] said unto
[55:21] Satan, the Lord rebuked thee. Oh Satan,
[55:24] even even the Lord that that have chosen
[55:27] Jerusalem rebuked thee.
[55:29] Is not this
[55:32] the the Ben plug out of the fire?
[55:36] Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garment
[55:42] and stood
[55:44] before the angel.
[55:47] Praise the Lord. You have to bear with
[55:49] me a little bit here. Amen. Now, if you
[55:53] read uh uh uh what we read from uh uh
[55:57] Hebrew uh chapter 4,
[56:00] uh if you did not pay attention to that,
[56:02] let's go back to that a little bit.
[56:06] Let's just let's just skip back to
[56:08] Hebrew chapter 4 a little bit quickly
[56:10] and then we will come back here.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when we read in Hebrew chapter
[56:18] 4,
[56:20] Paul is saying here Jesus Christ is our
[56:24] high priest. What is he saying? That our
[56:28] high priest, he is touched by the
[56:31] feelings of our infirmities.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In another sense,
[56:39] we our weaknesses,
[56:42] our our our sin
[56:46] uh uh becomes the garment that our high
[56:50] priest wear.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; So, if Joshua is wearing a filthy
[56:59] garment,
[57:01] &gt;&gt; let let me let me not go ahead of
[57:03] myself. Let's let's let's let's continue
[57:05] to look there in Hebrew. I throw the
[57:08] page away.
[57:10] Let me not go ahead of myself. Let me
[57:12] let me just establish what I want to say
[57:14] here. He said he's touched by the
[57:15] feelings of our infirmities. And then
[57:18] when you come down
[57:20] to chapter five,
[57:28] &gt;&gt; verse three, it says, "And by reason
[57:31] hereof, he ought as for the people,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; so also for himself,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord,
[57:41] &gt;&gt; to offer sin." So the high priest is
[57:45] wearing his own burden.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And he's wearing the people own burden.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you when you are dealing
[57:56] with something. Okay. And I I don't care
[57:59] what it is. Even if it is sickness,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. And uh and and uh and
[58:05] and and and you you you tell your pastor
[58:08] about it. He talks about it and uh and
[58:11] and and he's standing in that place to
[58:13] anoint you with oil to pray for you and
[58:16] all of that. You know, brother Brandon
[58:18] will explain that, you know, how all of
[58:20] those spirits that are cast out of the
[58:21] meeting come back to attack you.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] Now you see that is the reason why the
[58:32] Old Testament uh uh priest had to be
[58:36] completely separated from the people he
[58:38] he just still in the in in the
[58:40] tabernacle.
[58:43] Praise the Lord.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he needs to avail himself
[58:50] whenever the people comes with their
[58:52] need. He needs to be light enough.
[58:58] Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; He don't need to be heavy and
[59:02] overburdened with his own thing
[59:04] &gt;&gt; and then to charge the people think on
[59:06] himself then he's going to die.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; So he needs to be light enough.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; What about prayer? What about fasting?
[59:16] And he just he need to be light enough
[59:18] so when the people bring their knees, he
[59:21] can be able to jump into the fight. He
[59:23] can stay on his face and pray for them.
[59:26] He can be there to counsel them. Cry to
[59:28] God and say just like David knowh this
[59:32] bed or this lion is not going to take
[59:34] the sheep of God.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; But when we get so busy where we we we
[59:43] you know we have to be running after
[59:44] this and we running after that and
[59:46] there's no time to pray and and you know
[59:49] and we just pass the sheet and look for
[59:50] one quote. You know, brother Brandham
[59:52] says in in in this message, Brother
[59:54] Brandham says this is the way to handle
[59:56] this. That does not solve problems.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] Here is in this vision, Zachariah is
[1:00:09] seeing Joshua the high priest.
[1:00:13] Satan trying to resist him. But then
[1:00:16] moreover, he's close with filthy garment
[1:00:20] as he stood before the angel.
[1:00:24] This word filthy garment really don't
[1:00:26] explain what is happening here.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] It does not explain what is happening,
[1:00:35] but you will grab the concept just now.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] This word filter g
[1:00:44] from the Greek is is is very foul is is
[1:00:49] ugly
[1:00:51] because what what h
[1:00:55] uh what Joshua is covering your way if I
[1:00:59] was looking at that today or or the
[1:01:03] other day. [clears throat]
[1:01:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:14] Are we together?
[1:01:29] When you look in here, you will see that
[1:01:31] the word
[1:01:34] the word filter G in here is is uh is is
[1:01:37] very gross because
[1:01:40] just just using the word filter, it does
[1:01:43] not really explain what it is, but uh
[1:01:47] let me let me just let me just help you
[1:01:50] here.
[1:01:56] It says that it's from a it's it's from
[1:01:58] a root word that means
[1:02:00] a soul and uh
[1:02:06] uh as if
[1:02:09] a street man which mean he's covered in
[1:02:12] his own mess.
[1:02:15] Okay. So then if you look here it does
[1:02:17] not say filthy it says stinky.
[1:02:25] It it say stinking garment
[1:02:28] in in the Hebrew that does not say
[1:02:30] filthy. It say stinking garment because
[1:02:32] filter really do not describe what is
[1:02:36] happening here.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] It's almost like
[1:02:42] when Isaiah says,
[1:02:45] Praise the Lord. When Isaiah says in
[1:02:48] Isaiah chapter 64:6,
[1:02:51] "But we all we are all as unclean things
[1:02:56] and all our unrighteousness
[1:02:59] is as filthy rag."
[1:03:03] It's the same word. Now, this is where I
[1:03:06] want to go tonight. I want to I I want
[1:03:09] to dive in the place of why our high
[1:03:12] priests have to stand before God because
[1:03:16] it's so easy for us to take on a
[1:03:20] selfrighteous spirit.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And a self-righteous spirit is stinking
[1:03:28] before God.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; A self-righteous spirit smells.
[1:03:37] Hallelujah.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Except righteous spirit do not help us
[1:03:42] to appreciate the grace of God every day
[1:03:45] of our life
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; because it gave us the sense that we
[1:03:50] have achieved something and it looks
[1:03:52] like we are better than them.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; When we don't realize that the only
[1:03:59] thing that hangs over you is the grace
[1:04:02] of God.
[1:04:04] That's the only thing that hangs over
[1:04:05] you because evil thought goes through
[1:04:08] your mind. Evil desire goes through your
[1:04:10] your your mind. That's right.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; But there is the grace of God that hangs
[1:04:14] over you
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; that keeps you away from it.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see this man, this priest
[1:04:26] here standing before the Lord. You think
[1:04:29] about it. Standing before the Lord.
[1:04:31] Brother Brandham, brother uh uh uh Don
[1:04:35] uh he used to help brother Brandham in
[1:04:36] the prayer line. One time he quit. He
[1:04:39] told Brother Brandham, "I can't do this
[1:04:40] anymore." Brother Brandon says, "Why,
[1:04:43] dog?" He says uh he said, "Brother," he
[1:04:45] says, he said, "Belly, I can't believe
[1:04:47] I'm standing right there where the angel
[1:04:49] of the Lord comes down and heal these
[1:04:52] people, yet I have evil thought going
[1:04:54] through my mind.
[1:05:01] The angel of the Lord, the pillar of
[1:05:03] fire is there descending the people
[1:05:07] and he's having brother but Brandon told
[1:05:10] him
[1:05:12] whatever you are going through time say
[1:05:14] by 100
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; that's what I go through.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through,
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; if you think it's so bad for you, times
[1:05:27] it by 100. That's what I go through.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Because he's not only thinking it,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; he's looking right in the people life
[1:05:38] and see them committing adultery and see
[1:05:40] them commit. He's seeing it on a vision.
[1:05:56] Are we together
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; now? So
[1:06:01] this this high priest standing in the
[1:06:04] presence of God,
[1:06:06] Satan here trying to resist him.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Another word says Satan is trying to
[1:06:11] accuse him. Right?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; As he's standing in the presence of God,
[1:06:15] Satan is trying to accuse him. See how
[1:06:18] filthy he is. See the thoughts that is
[1:06:20] going through his mind.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; But he's standing in the presence of
[1:06:25] God. Standing on behalf of the people,
[1:06:28] confessing his sins and confessing the
[1:06:31] sin of the people. And yet Satan is
[1:06:34] trying to accuse him before God.
[1:06:42] And Joshua was clothed in filthy garment
[1:06:47] and stood before the angel.
[1:06:53] That's the reason why the Bible says uh
[1:06:55] God says come and let us reason
[1:06:57] together. Your sin may be as scal.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; There is no foul sin.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:07] of our unbelief and misbehavior that is
[1:07:10] so stink that God cannot come closer.
[1:07:14] There is no mess that we find oursself
[1:07:16] in that he cannot come closer.
[1:07:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] If God was just like like man with our
[1:07:35] self-righteousness,
[1:07:37] he would not take filthiness in his
[1:07:39] presence.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; He would tell the angel, "Pack this man
[1:07:43] away. He smells so stink."
[1:07:53] And he answered and spake unto those
[1:07:55] that stood before him, saying, "Take
[1:07:58] away the filthy garment from him."
[1:08:02] All of this is happening in vision.
[1:08:05] The priest comes and he's he's laboring
[1:08:08] for the people. He's offering the people
[1:08:10] needs before God. Oh God, help this
[1:08:12] family. Lord, help this young man. Yeah.
[1:08:15] Lord, help this young woman. Let her
[1:08:17] come to conviction. let her understand
[1:08:19] that uh you know let let this word be so
[1:08:22] real to her. He's doing all of that and
[1:08:24] yet the devil standing right there and
[1:08:25] accusing him.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's just not he's not like
[1:08:32] a Catholic priest that stay be behind
[1:08:34] the backs. No, he's identified with the
[1:08:37] weaknesses of the people. He's
[1:08:39] identified with the failures of the
[1:08:41] people.
[1:08:48] That's the work of a prince.
[1:08:52] That's the reason why Paul says, "No man
[1:08:54] take this to himself." God has to call a
[1:08:58] man into it.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Just like Aaron was called into the
[1:09:03] priesthood.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Because if you are not called to it,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; you will spend your whole day on the
[1:09:10] phone talking people problem from one
[1:09:13] person to another. You know what is
[1:09:14] happening? I can't I can't imagine this
[1:09:16] other person is going through. Oh my
[1:09:17] god. Oh, I can't that that just all you
[1:09:20] do
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; and that is the thing that people have
[1:09:33] seen and have experienced.
[1:09:35] They have destroyed the confidence
[1:09:39] between the the service the confidence
[1:09:41] in the service.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:44] We having the confidence in the man
[1:09:45] because we have a pastor. But the
[1:09:47] confidence in the service,
[1:09:52] the way the preacher should labor with
[1:09:54] the people, they have destroyed that.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Because of some of the things we have
[1:10:00] experienced
[1:10:01] and some of the things that people have
[1:10:03] experienced.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:09] And he said, the Lord said, "And speak
[1:10:11] unto those that stood before him, those
[1:10:13] angels, saying, take away the filthy
[1:10:16] garment from him, and and onto him he
[1:10:20] said, behold, I have caused that
[1:10:23] iniquity." So in the vision, the Lord is
[1:10:25] speaking to the angels to take the
[1:10:28] filthy garment off of of Joshua. And
[1:10:31] he's speaking to Joshua, and he say,
[1:10:33] "Behold, I have taken away your
[1:10:35] iniquity."
[1:10:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; This is all happening in a vision.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Visions should be wonderful things.
[1:10:48] Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And also terrifying things.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Terrifying experience.
[1:10:55] Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to
[1:10:58] pass from thee, and I will clothe thee
[1:11:02] with change of remaining.
[1:11:06] Praise the Lord. I will close thee with
[1:11:08] change of rem. Let's let's go quickly as
[1:11:11] time is getting off our hand. And and
[1:11:13] and
[1:11:14] I said, let them set the pharaoh
[1:11:18] merchant upon his head. So they set a
[1:11:21] fertile upon his head and clothed him
[1:11:24] with garments,
[1:11:26] and the angel of the Lord stood by, and
[1:11:30] the angel of the Lord protested unto
[1:11:34] Joshua, saying, Thus say the Lord of
[1:11:38] hosts, if thou will walk in my ways, and
[1:11:43] if thou will keep my charge, then thou
[1:11:47] shalt also judge my house and shall also
[1:11:51] keep my courts and I will give thee
[1:11:55] places to walk among these that stand
[1:11:58] by.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And who were standing by those angels?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will give you a place among
[1:12:03] them. Are we together?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] Here now, oh Joshua the high priest,
[1:12:11] thou and thy fellows that sit before
[1:12:14] thee, for they are men uh h wonder at
[1:12:20] for behold I will bring forth my servant
[1:12:23] the branch.
[1:12:25] Now we know that in the Old Testament
[1:12:27] this branch represent Jesus Christ.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament he was called the
[1:12:33] branch. But when he came, he said, "I am
[1:12:35] the vine, you are the branch."
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I am the vine, you are
[1:12:42] the branch." In the Old Testament,
[1:12:44] Isaiah call him the branch. And uh and
[1:12:46] yet Zechariah is calling him the branch.
[1:12:49] So uh uh uh the angel says, "Behold, I
[1:12:52] will bring for myself the branch." Now,
[1:12:54] watch carefully. Now, this is where I
[1:12:56] want to get to. For behold, the stone
[1:13:00] that I have laid before Joshua the high
[1:13:03] priest,
[1:13:05] upon one stone
[1:13:08] shall be seven eyes.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we go back
[1:13:16] to what we were looking at
[1:13:19] uh uh last week from Revelation. the
[1:13:22] seven eyes, the seven spirit which are
[1:13:25] the seven horns and the seven eyes that
[1:13:28] are before the Lord. Now here we seeing
[1:13:31] also here in this type God now is
[1:13:34] showing Joshua that after he has gone
[1:13:38] through all of this experience in a
[1:13:40] vision he has gone through all of this
[1:13:42] experience God is also now introducing
[1:13:45] him to something that's where I want to
[1:13:47] bring bring us tonight and behold the
[1:13:49] stone that I lay before Joshua upon one
[1:13:52] stone shall be seven eyes behold I will
[1:13:55] in engrave the engraving thereof of say
[1:13:59] the Lord of hosts and I will remove the
[1:14:03] iniquity of the land in one day. Praise
[1:14:07] the Lord.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And in that day said the Lord of hosts
[1:14:14] shall call every man his neighbor on on
[1:14:18] the vine and on the fig tree. Praise the
[1:14:21] Lord.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] Now, so we see just like Joshua, so our
[1:14:30] high priest is and also we bring in it
[1:14:33] as a little type of what our ministry is
[1:14:36] supposed to be, what what the pastoral
[1:14:38] ministry is supposed to be, the man that
[1:14:40] stands between the people and uh uh uh
[1:14:44] uh uh and the mercy seat. Now, so we see
[1:14:47] here that uh uh [clears throat]
[1:14:51] Joshua is now being introduced to
[1:14:54] something different here after this
[1:14:58] accusation of the devil trying to resist
[1:15:01] him. Now we also see here the Bible says
[1:15:04] and the angel of the Lord protested
[1:15:07] for Joshua. Amen.
[1:15:10] That word means that the angel of the
[1:15:13] Lord witnessed to him. Amen.
[1:15:16] The angel witness in his defense.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, oh Joshua the high priest,
[1:15:26] thou and thy fellows that sit before
[1:15:28] thee. Behold, I behold I will bring
[1:15:32] forth my servant the branch. Now there
[1:15:34] the whole thing down. Our Lord Jesus is
[1:15:37] introduced into it in another way. For
[1:15:40] for
[1:15:41] behold, the stone that I I I I lay
[1:15:45] before Joshua upon one stone shall have
[1:15:48] seven eyes. Now, so we see here, we see
[1:15:51] and and that and and those seven eyes,
[1:15:54] the scripture says, I will engrave the
[1:15:56] engraving therefore, say the Lord of
[1:15:58] hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of
[1:16:01] the land in one day. [clears throat]
[1:16:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon will use this here
[1:16:10] in in in the bridge 1963. He says here,
[1:16:14] now I want to read Zechariah chapter 3.
[1:16:17] We we we are just going to get this
[1:16:21] symbol here. Now, he's teaching on the
[1:16:23] seven spirit. Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And then he's going to link it to to
[1:16:28] Zechariah chapter 3. The seven spirit we
[1:16:31] talk about that is the seven horns and
[1:16:33] the seven eyes. He's he's now going to
[1:16:36] link it now. And what did we say? Those
[1:16:39] four beasts have seven eyes. This is
[1:16:43] this is the eye of the Lord that run two
[1:16:45] and four. You will see it also here in
[1:16:47] Zechariah chapter 4. But what what
[1:16:49] actually it is is that that's that is
[1:16:52] the place where I want to bring you like
[1:16:54] I said on Sunday. You know, we we must
[1:16:57] realize that uh when God call us into
[1:17:01] his covenant, when he call us as his
[1:17:04] children, he's not looking at at uh at
[1:17:07] your ability. Amen. He's looking at his
[1:17:10] ability.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; He's the one that is making provision
[1:17:14] here, giving you seven eyes to watch
[1:17:16] over you. Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you see Joshua is
[1:17:21] coming through this vision where the
[1:17:23] enemy is is accusing him. Praise the
[1:17:25] Lord. And and and and and the enemy is
[1:17:29] accusing him of the filthiness that he
[1:17:31] have, the filthiness of the people. Just
[1:17:33] like Bam Balak tried to to bring Bam
[1:17:36] into to accuse the people before God.
[1:17:39] Now the enemy tried to accuse him. But
[1:17:41] then we see on the other side there is a
[1:17:44] stone that has seven eyes. Amen. That's
[1:17:47] been watching the whole scene. Joshua
[1:17:50] has to come through all of that trial of
[1:17:53] filthiness. He has to come to the place
[1:17:55] where the the angel was commanded take
[1:17:58] the filthy garment from on him. You
[1:18:00] change his garment. Put a clean. Why?
[1:18:03] Because there is an eye that was
[1:18:05] watching.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The very eye that gave Zachariah the
[1:18:09] vision.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Because what? H Joshua the high priest
[1:18:16] was representing the people of Israel.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no matter what the people has
[1:18:24] gone through, no matter [screaming]
[1:18:26] their backsliding and how they have
[1:18:28] filled God, but God got a man in his
[1:18:32] presence.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And he's going to use that man life on a
[1:18:38] vision
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; to tell them that I've been watching you
[1:18:42] all of this. There is nothing of your
[1:18:44] life that is hid from me.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you will walk in my ways,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; If thou will walk in my ways and keep my
[1:18:56] charge,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; praise, then I will give you a place.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; The moon,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; these angels, are we together? Oh, it is
[1:19:06] getting beautiful here. Chapter four,
[1:19:07] let's go. Let's go ahead here.
[1:19:10] [clears throat]
[1:19:11] Chapter 4. And the angel that talked
[1:19:13] with me came and wake me as a man that
[1:19:17] is waking out of his sleep. And he said
[1:19:20] unto me, was here that another vision
[1:19:22] broke up. Now Joshua came from one
[1:19:24] vision. Another vision broke out. The
[1:19:26] angel wake him up. Now remember, he's
[1:19:29] not dreaming. Daniel was the one that
[1:19:32] had dream that trouble him. This man is
[1:19:34] having vision. The angel woke him up as
[1:19:37] a man waking out of his sleep and said,
[1:19:39] "What see there?" He said, "I look, and
[1:19:42] behold, a candlestick
[1:19:45] all of gold with a bowl upon the top of
[1:19:49] it, and his seven lambs thereof, and
[1:19:53] seven pipes to the seven lambs,
[1:19:57] which are upon the top thereof." Praise
[1:20:01] the Lord.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] Now, last week when we were talking
[1:20:06] about the seven eyes that represent the
[1:20:08] seven horns, the I mean the seven spirit
[1:20:11] that represent the seven horns and and
[1:20:13] the seven eyes, we trace it back to the
[1:20:15] church ages and it was also representing
[1:20:19] the seven golden candlestick.
[1:20:23] Now remember now, brother Brandham told
[1:20:25] us we can pick these things up in the
[1:20:27] Old Testament,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It's not only unique to the New
[1:20:31] Testament. is not only unique to the
[1:20:34] church ages.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; All through the ages, God's people has
[1:20:40] been candlestick in his hands.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; God has raised up prophets and messenger
[1:20:48] as a lightbearer to lead his people from
[1:20:51] darkness to light.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; When do we use candle? In the night.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't need to use
[1:21:00] candle when the daylight is off. You use
[1:21:02] candle in the in the night. That's the
[1:21:04] reason why brother Brandham say all the
[1:21:06] messenger came in the evening time.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; To be able to lead the people through
[1:21:11] the darkness to the break of the
[1:21:12] morning.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; So you see even from the Old Testament
[1:21:20] God eyes has been watching his people.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reason why in Jeremiah
[1:21:27] he told Israel, I took you like a young
[1:21:29] lady. I saw you when you committed harot
[1:21:32] on all the tree. My eyes were upon you,
[1:21:34] but yet I pick you up out of your mess.
[1:21:37] I wash you. I dress you and I brought
[1:21:39] you to myself and call you my wife.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] right from the beginning. That is the
[1:21:58] reason why what took place in Eden never
[1:22:01] took God by surprise. His eyes were
[1:22:04] open.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; His eyes was looking down.
[1:22:12] When the Hebrew babies were slaughtered,
[1:22:14] God was not sleeping. His eyes were
[1:22:17] open.
[1:22:20] Are we together?
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:24] He's touched by the feelings of your
[1:22:27] infirmities.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; He knows what you are going through. He
[1:22:30] feel it.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Abraham says our God is not an a a a
[1:22:37] h an imperson God. A one that is not
[1:22:41] that is not real. He say he's a god that
[1:22:43] is identified.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. He says uh uh uh uh God
[1:22:49] rich in mercy. Every little thing that
[1:22:51] concern you matters to God.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; That's why he's here.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; The problem there is that is it real to
[1:23:01] us?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Is it real to us? Is is that is it the
[1:23:06] way we see it?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Do we see that just like his eyes are on
[1:23:13] the spirals, his eyes is on us?
[1:23:16] Are we seeing it like that? Is it real
[1:23:18] to you?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Is it real to us or it's just a lecture?
[1:23:32] Are we able to trust God
[1:23:35] to know that he knows our emotion? He
[1:23:39] knows our disappointment. He knows our
[1:23:42] hurt.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; He knows. Are we able to trust God like
[1:23:46] that? Do we really see him like that?
[1:23:52] Or is something we are considering in
[1:23:54] our mind? It could be truth. It could
[1:23:56] not be truth. No, no, no, no, no. It's
[1:23:59] truth.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Because he's he's showing right here
[1:24:05] that all through the ages.
[1:24:09] Now, we read this. There's no time for
[1:24:11] us to read the entire thing. Let's drop
[1:24:13] down. Let's drop down a little bit here.
[1:24:19] Let's let's drop down a little bit.
[1:24:20] Let's let's go over to to verse 8 of
[1:24:23] chapter 4. Moreover, the word of the
[1:24:26] Lord came unto me, saying, the hand of
[1:24:28] Zarab has laid the foundation of this
[1:24:31] house. His hand shall finish it. Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; The alpha and omega principle. God is
[1:24:38] showing in a vision. I started this, I
[1:24:40] will finish it.
[1:24:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Everything that concern your salvation,
[1:24:45] your redemption, I started it and I will
[1:24:48] finish it.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; If I have to drag you into heaven, I
[1:24:52] will drag you.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; And thou shall know that the Lord of
[1:25:02] hosts have sent me unto you. Verse 10.
[1:25:08] For who have despised
[1:25:10] the days of small things?
[1:25:14] For they shall rejoice
[1:25:17] and see the plummet in the hands of
[1:25:20] Zarabel.
[1:25:22] With those seven, which seven? Now he's
[1:25:26] pointing back to the seven in verse two.
[1:25:30] With those seven.
[1:25:33] Amen.
[1:25:38] They shall rejoice and see the plummet
[1:25:40] in the hands of Zarubel with those
[1:25:42] seven. They are the eyes of the Lord
[1:25:46] which run to and forth through the whole
[1:25:49] earth. In Revelation chapter 5, that was
[1:25:52] the same way it was identified the seven
[1:25:54] out of the Lord which cover the whole
[1:25:56] earth. So it's not only concerning the
[1:25:59] seven church ages.
[1:26:02] It's been there right from time
[1:26:05] when it looks like the people of God
[1:26:07] were abandoned in in in Babylon and and
[1:26:10] it looks like Nebuchinnezar just had
[1:26:13] charge of these people and and you know
[1:26:15] and and and and I mean the slaughter and
[1:26:17] the the the rape and all the evil that
[1:26:20] was going on. His eyes was there. He
[1:26:24] kept his eyes on Shedra, Mishad, and
[1:26:26] Abednego.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He kept his eyes on the Daniel. He kept
[1:26:30] his eyes on a little group of people
[1:26:32] that was standing for his word.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; And he will bring he will bring judgment
[1:26:43] against Babylon for what Nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:46] did to his people. He said, "I gave them
[1:26:49] to you and then after I will judge you,
[1:26:52] I will punish you."
[1:26:58] Are we together?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; He took and and and that is what our
[1:27:08] high priest does. That is what our high
[1:27:11] priest does. Okay, we're right here on
[1:27:13] time. [clears throat]
[1:27:15] Glory be to God.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand says something and it was
[1:27:22] it was wonderful when I read it. He says
[1:27:24] uh he said this. He said uh oh Joshua
[1:27:27] the high priest and his fellow he says
[1:27:31] uh
[1:27:35] okay he read the very same scripture. I
[1:27:38] would bring for myself the branch which
[1:27:39] is Christ. For behold the stone that lay
[1:27:43] before Joshua. seven eyes. He gets he
[1:27:45] gets here
[1:27:48] okay up there he says
[1:27:51] uh we're just going to see the symbol of
[1:27:54] this he says if I got my scripture wrote
[1:27:56] in there I just he says I was I I was
[1:27:59] just shouting all over the place this
[1:28:01] afternoon when I hit this. Amen. He says
[1:28:04] when I when I came to realize that what
[1:28:07] is in revelation is also here. He said
[1:28:10] man it just broke a revival in my heart.
[1:28:12] Amen. I was just shouting all over the
[1:28:14] place and yeah that's exactly what
[1:28:16] happened when the word opened to you.
[1:28:18] Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Now so sees your brother Brandon who
[1:28:22] says what do thou give Elijah he's uh uh
[1:28:26] what do thou give? He says that's what
[1:28:28] the church need is a revival to shake
[1:28:32] shake from all of its worldliness and
[1:28:35] the things of the word. You see because
[1:28:37] because uh we are losing our grip on the
[1:28:41] confidence of the word.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When people start
[1:28:47] backsliding is because they are losing
[1:28:50] their grip. It looks like the word is
[1:28:53] not doing it for me. It looks like these
[1:28:56] promises that that is said is truth is
[1:28:59] not coming to pass.
[1:29:02] and we start losing our grip
[1:29:05] and all that is left with us is just a
[1:29:07] form. We just have a form but we don't
[1:29:10] trust the word. We don't believe the
[1:29:13] word.
[1:29:15] If we believe the word it will affect
[1:29:17] our attitude.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; We will have the attitude that says even
[1:29:23] though he's slaying I will trust him.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. People start losing
[1:29:31] their their concentration. They start
[1:29:33] losing their consciousness of right and
[1:29:36] wrong.
[1:29:39] And when we start indulging ourself in
[1:29:41] things,
[1:29:43] no time to pray, no time to read the
[1:29:46] word, no time for meditation, no time,
[1:29:48] no quiet time, no time to listen to the
[1:29:51] still small voice.
[1:29:55] It's just lost.
[1:30:03] shake off the wateriness and the things
[1:30:05] of the word and bring back purity and
[1:30:08] holiness of God in the hearts of the
[1:30:10] believer. That's what we need. A feeling
[1:30:13] where we we hate what is wrong.
[1:30:19] You'll realize that when people talk
[1:30:21] about hatred today, it's not against
[1:30:24] things. It's against people. I hate
[1:30:26] them. I hate them.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; They are not hating what is supposed to
[1:30:30] hate.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Bring back the purity and holiness of
[1:30:41] God in the hearts of the believer.
[1:30:45] They don't get revival once in a while
[1:30:47] in the spirit. They become so connorant
[1:30:50] and so indifferent till till they get
[1:30:55] self tied and starch is self-righteous.
[1:30:59] That's that's that it was God is God way
[1:31:02] of describing self-righteousness
[1:31:06] because just like us that's how the the
[1:31:09] the the the Jewish people were that's
[1:31:11] how the the the the the the Israelites
[1:31:15] were right here. They fear that they
[1:31:17] were the people of God. They just took
[1:31:19] the name of the people of God. We are
[1:31:21] the children of Abraham. But they were
[1:31:23] indulging in all the things. So when God
[1:31:27] want to show our self-righteousness, he
[1:31:29] says, "What is in you? What is in your
[1:31:32] stomach?"
[1:31:37] Praise the Lord. Our self-righteousness
[1:31:40] is like you taking the dirt from your
[1:31:43] stomach and covering your entire body
[1:31:45] with it.
[1:31:46] That's how God sees self-righteousness
[1:31:49] is stink in his nose.
[1:31:55] That is the beginning of the backsliding
[1:31:57] of the church. When a person starts to
[1:31:59] backslide,
[1:32:01] they start to become self-righteous.
[1:32:09] It just put them to that place where
[1:32:10] they they know how to condemn all of
[1:32:12] you. See the other one. See the other
[1:32:13] one. See the other one.
[1:32:17] No, it's supposed to be at a place where
[1:32:20] your heart becomes the mercy seat of
[1:32:22] God. You say, "Oh God, have mercy. Help
[1:32:25] these children. Help this my neighbor.
[1:32:26] Help these people." If they just only
[1:32:28] knew the grace of God that has come to
[1:32:30] us. If they knew the judgment that is
[1:32:32] coming upon this world,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; we only know that we are doing well.
[1:32:44] Me and my family we serving the Lord. Me
[1:32:46] and my children
[1:32:49] started self-righteous
[1:32:51] reinstating that's good but that's the
[1:32:54] thing we are talking about.
[1:32:57] You know more about the word. It's good
[1:33:00] to know the word but it is better to
[1:33:03] know the altar of the word.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; See that little something that you leave
[1:33:09] out. That little thing that you leave
[1:33:11] out,
[1:33:14] we get on our knees to pray. It just it
[1:33:16] just oh God help me. God help it. Just
[1:33:18] you and you and you.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Who's the next person you are burdening
[1:33:22] for?
[1:33:33] That little something you leave out that
[1:33:36] that's something in your heart that
[1:33:38] makes you what you are. That is the
[1:33:41] think.
[1:33:43] Praise the Lord. That is the think. See
[1:33:46] what he says up here
[1:33:49] in the message on this. He says, "If ye
[1:33:53] abide in me, my word abide in you, ask
[1:33:55] what you will, and it shall be done unto
[1:33:57] you. If ye abide in me and my word abide
[1:34:00] in you," what is it?
[1:34:03] You have got to get the word. Get
[1:34:06] yourself killed out. Die to yourself.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Die to yourself. Let Christ live in us.
[1:34:22] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[1:34:24] have received the Holy Ghost. But just
[1:34:28] we just received enough Holy Ghost to
[1:34:30] make to make us to be to make us to the
[1:34:34] place where we don't want to lie. We
[1:34:37] don't want to steal. We don't want to do
[1:34:39] so. I mean we don't dress because we
[1:34:41] don't smoke. We don't drink. We just
[1:34:43] think that we have we have made it.
[1:34:46] We think that we have achieved
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Christ in us.
[1:34:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:55] We think we have achieved it.
[1:35:05] We have enough just not to make us lie.
[1:35:07] And still we don't want to do anything.
[1:35:10] But God want to fill every fiber of his
[1:35:12] church.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; He want to fill our thinking. He want to
[1:35:18] fill our mind and and feel every bit of
[1:35:21] you.
[1:35:23] Just make you completely totally dead to
[1:35:26] yourself
[1:35:27] or to your thinking. Just so surrender
[1:35:30] to God till the word of God just living
[1:35:33] right through you.
[1:35:37] Having the burden in your heart.
[1:35:41] What next Lord?
[1:35:44] How can I How can I share this this hope
[1:35:47] that I have in me
[1:35:50] with this young lady?
[1:35:53] How can I have share this hope that I
[1:35:56] have in me?
[1:35:58] Self-righteousness has just it make us
[1:36:01] so proud that we can't even talk about
[1:36:02] the Jesus we love.
[1:36:05] We so we so proud that it is only our
[1:36:08] Jesus.
[1:36:13] There's one thing that is killing the
[1:36:14] church, especially around the message.
[1:36:17] Bunch of self-righteous people.
[1:36:20] We spend all our time blasting
[1:36:22] denomination and blasting and blasting
[1:36:23] and blasting when it's just hitting the
[1:36:26] word and coming right back to us.
[1:36:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; God was was was through a vision here to
[1:36:36] Zachariah. He was trying to show the
[1:36:38] condition of the people
[1:36:41] how their self-righteousness is so
[1:36:44] burdened by this by this by this priest
[1:36:47] and the devil is there. They are trying
[1:36:48] to accuse him and and and and seeing
[1:36:51] condemn the people. Oh, see what has
[1:36:53] happened again. See what is going on in
[1:36:54] this other person life. See what is
[1:36:56] going on in this other person life.
[1:37:01] But he stay right there before God.
[1:37:09] confessing his sin and confessing the
[1:37:10] sins of the people and saying, "Oh God,
[1:37:13] have mercy upon us.
[1:37:19] Bring us a decent church once again
[1:37:21] where the people have decent spirit. It
[1:37:24] it does not become difficult to
[1:37:26] apologize. Oh brother, I'm sorry.
[1:37:28] Sister, I'm very sorry.
[1:37:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:37] Are we together? [snorts]
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Second hand galvan musicians, you can
[1:37:46] come. I want to wrap myself in his
[1:37:49] righteousness.
[1:37:50] I know there's a great shadow sitting
[1:37:53] before us. Every one of us is coming to
[1:37:55] death tonight, friends.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Every every time your heartbeat, you are
[1:38:01] one step closer to that big door called
[1:38:05] death.
[1:38:07] One day you are going to make your last
[1:38:09] beat and you are going in.
[1:38:13] And I realize as
[1:38:16] as your evangelist in seven, I too I
[1:38:19] have to I have to go there. go to death.
[1:38:22] I have got to come down. No matter how
[1:38:26] much I have preached about it, I've got
[1:38:28] to come down to it. But what I do,
[1:38:32] I don't want to come in my own
[1:38:35] self-righteous rag.
[1:38:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:40] When I see that my last beat coming up
[1:38:44] and I'm entering the door, I want to
[1:38:46] wrap myself in the robe of his
[1:38:49] righteousness.
[1:38:51] Knowing this that I [snorts] know him in
[1:38:53] the power of his resurrection. You
[1:38:56] cannot know him in the power of the
[1:38:59] resurrection until you first know him in
[1:39:01] the forgiveness of your sin.
[1:39:05] You first know him as the God
[1:39:11] that stands between you and all of your
[1:39:13] wrong.
[1:39:21] You see, when you when when you come to
[1:39:23] that place
[1:39:25] and you get off that you get that
[1:39:27] self-righteous garment from on you,
[1:39:31] the things that you are struggling with,
[1:39:33] it does not condemn you because you know
[1:39:35] there is a there is one there that has a
[1:39:38] garment in his hands and is ready to
[1:39:40] take your filter garment off and put his
[1:39:43] robe upon you.
[1:39:47] That's what he did to our our father
[1:39:49] Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden when
[1:39:52] they took a fake a a a fake leave and
[1:39:55] covered their shame. He what what did he
[1:39:58] do? He came down and took a bloody sheep
[1:40:00] skin representing his word. Wrapped them
[1:40:03] in a bleeding skin. [music]
[1:40:05] And that's what God want to do to us.
[1:40:07] Wrap us in his word.
[1:40:12] Wrap us in his word.
[1:40:16] That is the thing that make us to
[1:40:17] appreciate the grace that we have.
[1:40:20] We don't walk like we have everything
[1:40:22] under control.
[1:40:25] Oh, I know my life. I know my life. You
[1:40:27] don't know your life. You don't know
[1:40:29] your life. You don't know what is
[1:40:30] against you.
[1:40:35] But you walk under the grace of God.
[1:40:37] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, thank you for
[1:40:39] your grace.
[1:40:42] If it was not because of your grace, I
[1:40:44] would have been like that man. I would
[1:40:45] have been like that woman. Thank you for
[1:40:47] your [music] grace. Lord, I pray if
[1:40:50] there is just grace that can be able to
[1:40:51] meet them in their condition.
[1:41:01] As soon as the Lord can get
[1:41:03] self-righteousness from in our mind and
[1:41:05] and take us out of that filthy garment
[1:41:07] of self-righteousness, you will see how
[1:41:10] your heart will warm towards people.
[1:41:12] Even when you greeting the brother, you
[1:41:14] will see you will be so glad to be able
[1:41:16] to greet appreciating that the same
[1:41:18] grace that saved you is the same grace
[1:41:20] that saved this person.
[1:41:26] Let's
[1:41:35] bow our [music] heads tonight.
[1:41:47] And I be wor [singing]
[1:41:49] Oh.
[1:41:52] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:41:54] I [music] never fail.
[1:41:57] Teach [singing] me Lord. Oh, teach me
[1:42:01] [music] Jesus
[1:42:04] how to wait. [music]
[1:42:09] Oh [singing]
[1:42:10] yes, they that wait
[1:42:15] upon the wall
[1:42:18] shall [singing]
[1:42:19] renew [music]
[1:42:22] their strength.
[1:42:25] They [singing and music] shall bound up
[1:42:29] with way
[1:42:32] as a [singing] eagle. [music]
[1:42:36] Oh,
[1:42:38] they [singing and music] shall run
[1:42:41] and I be all they. Yes, Lord. Yes,
[1:42:47] Jesus. [music]
[1:42:50] Oh, [singing]
[1:42:51] teach me Lord.
[1:42:54] Oh, teach [singing and music] me Jesus
[1:42:59] how to pray. Let's just speak to the
[1:43:01] Lord while the musician play softly now.
[1:43:04] Let's just pray together [music]
[1:43:05] tonight. Speak to the Lord yourself
[1:43:07] tonight and let's just thank him. Let's
[1:43:10] just [music] thank him that he is our
[1:43:11] high priest. He's touched by the
[1:43:14] feelings of our infrequities. [music] He
[1:43:16] became sin for us that we might become
[1:43:18] his very righteousness. He [music] was
[1:43:21] identified with all of our mess and he
[1:43:24] still identified with all of our
[1:43:26] failures, all of our weaknesses, [music]
[1:43:29] but he has come with a with a clean
[1:43:31] garment in his hands. He has come with
[1:43:34] his own righteousness. Oh, sin [music]
[1:43:36] is is an experience. When you experience
[1:43:39] that, you thank God every day. You lift
[1:43:42] up your hands in thanksgiving. You say,
[1:43:45] "Lord, it is your grace. Lord, I thank
[1:43:48] you for the grace that is still dealing
[1:43:50] with my heart. I thank you for the grace
[1:43:52] that is giving me strength every [music]
[1:43:54] day. Lord, I know it's not by power,
[1:43:57] it's not by might,
[1:44:00] [music] but it's by the spirit of the
[1:44:02] Lord. Heavenly Father, we just want to
[1:44:03] thank you tonight, Lord. Father, in the
[1:44:06] name of Jesus [music]
[1:44:07] Christ, oh God, precious Lord, we see
[1:44:11] the evil Lord. Father God, Lord Jesus,
[1:44:14] oh precious Lord, all of these
[1:44:16] self-righteousness and [music]
