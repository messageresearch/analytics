foreign [Music] and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not Maple that has neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back it picks up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died it preached to the souls that were in prison turn back into that theophany oh marbles thank God II Corinthians 5 1. if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one see we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and trusted by sin like Adam did but when tested obvious word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip to come right around here to be tempted and tested if we to come through that there have been no temptation we had note all things that's reason Jesus note all things because he was worried before he was flesh then we become the word here we are Farm to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you joined this church and joined that church and try this and that nothing's satisfying right but one day you just recognized it right the other night I was teaching somewhere are things out in California or Arizona about I believe I've told a little story here about the man setting to him had an eagle 800. and when that eagle passed out he's the funniest looking bird them chicken's ever seen but he walked around he was the he was the ugly one among them because he just couldn't understand how that hand will cluck and scratch on that manure pile and eat he couldn't get the idea she'd say come on over and feast honey but he was the eagle you just didn't eat like that it wasn't his food so she gets grasshopper some a lot more you know and call the little chickens and all them little chickens that go along clock along and eat but the little Eagle just couldn't do it it didn't didn't look right to him so one day is mammy come hunting and he's near that hand Club he tries best to cook but he couldn't do it he tried to cheat like a chicken but he couldn't do it see he was an eagle he to start with he was the eagle he was just hatched under a hen that's like some church member ever that's about the way it is about when I was setting is right but one day his man he flew over and she screamed he recognized it why was the eagle to begin with amen that's the way it is with the gospel of the word the power of Jesus Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears that true ring Scream Of God nothing can keep him from it the church if I say days of Miracles just passed stand here to eat this and stand here and eat that that barnyard stuff won't do for him anymore he's gone all things are possible he gets off the ground that's why I imagine any Christians in any King get their feet off the ground the old man he said Son jump you're an eagle come up here where I am he said Mom I never jumped in my life she said when you jump your ego to begin with you're not a chicken so he made his first jump and flopped his wings didn't do too good but he got off the ground that's why we do we accept God by Faith by the written word there's something in there is that eternal life you were predestinated to it his Grandpa and Grandma were Eagles he was the eagle all the way back Eagle don't mix with other things he's not a hybrid at all he's an eagle then after you recognize the very word of God was evil food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting say is that right brother Branham all right let's take a couple of eagles and look at him for a few minutes that was the name man named Moses everyone knows that a prophets called The Eagle in the Bible there was a prophet named Moses and one day God called him and what let him go over the land and he died on a rock the Angels took him away and buried him that was another man an eagle didn't even have to die he's walked across Jordan God sent a chair down and this robe of Flesh he dropped and rise and caught the Everlasting prize 800 years later 800 years later on my Transfiguration here stood those two men Moses body had been rotten for hundreds of years but yeah he was in such a form to even Peter James and John recognized it Amen to this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of God express your own Earth you've got a body weight and if you leave this world the only one standing on Mount Transfiguration in their theophany for they were prophets to whom the word came to also let us notice another prophet one time by the name of Samuel he was a great man he taught Israel told him he shouldn't have a king he said if I ever said one thing to you in the name of the Lord will I come to pass they said no everything you've always said in the name of the Lord come to pass he was a prophet and he died about three or four years later the king got in trouble that before the blood of Jesus Christ was ever shed he was in Paradise and a witch of hindrance Paul for somebody to come and console Saul and when the witch saw him standing up she said I see God raising up out of the Earth and after the man had been dead buried and rotted in the grave here he was standing there in that cave with his prophet's robes on I'm still a prophet or he said why did you call me out of my rest see you become an enemy to God once you prophesy tomorrow night but this time you will be with me he was still a prophet though he was gone from this body see if he come here and was part of that word and he entered from the Fleshlight back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world he entered into the theophany which was the word you get it that's where all believers go when we turn from here then in that form the bail ban is lifted you see you are the word also when you enter into there as a little babies I said a while ago now I noticed praise God for these opening seals in my prayer then know these things now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view was he was God the word before he became flesh God the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I had father and mother you did too Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was alive it's a self-same man all the time I hope God reveals it to you the self-sane person all the time notice his title king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 2 King of righteousness and King now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view well he was God the word before he became flesh God the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I had father and mother you did too Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was alive it's a self-same man all the time I hope God reveals it to you the self-sane person all the time notice his title king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 2 King of righteousness and King a peace these two kings a what Hebrews 7 2 of righteousness also the king of Peace he's two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received his body up in Revelations 21 16 he's called the king of kings he's all three of them together see King God King theophany King Jesus he's the king of kings it's all matches like soul body and spirit all comes to make one also he is the Father which was the first Son and Holy Ghost the spirit king of righteousness the spirit attribute theophany king of of um Peace theophany and in flesh he was King of Kings when the theophany Moses seen him Exodus 33 2 he was a theophany Moses wanted to see God he'd heard his voice heard him talk to him see him in a bush there it was a big Pillar of Fire and he said who are you I want to know who you are Moses said if you let me see you I would like to see your face he said no man can't see my face he said I'll put my hand over your eyes and I'll pass by and you can see my back but not my face see and when he did it was the back of a man it was theophany then the word that come to Moses I am that was the word the word came to Moses in the form of a pillar firing of burning bush the I am as the word from the theology from the theophany rather excuse me he came to Abraham as a man under the oak tree now look at there there came a man to Abraham three of them and sat down under an oak tree three of them I noticed after he talked to Abraham why did he come Abraham being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son and also he was God's word prophet that was trusting God's word calling anything contrary as though it wasn't see how perfect the word is the word came to the prophet see there was God in a theophany and the Bible said the word comes to the prophet and here was the the word in the theophany now you say was that God Abraham said it was he said his name was he called him Elohim now Genesis 1 you find out in the beginning Elohim create the heavens Earth and Genesis 18 we find out that Abraham called this person that sat there and talked to him and could tell him the secrets of his heart tell him what Sarah was thinking behind him Abraham said it is Elohim is in a theophany form you get it notice after how we find out that he was then in the theophany for him he called him Lord God Elohim now in Genesis 18 we find that that is truth now notice Abraham there was three of them together but when Abraham met the three he said my Lord but when locked down in Sodom two of them went down there and lot saw two of them coming and he said my lords see what was the matter the first place lot was not a prophet right or neither was it the messenger of the hour so he didn't have any revelation of him it's exactly right lot to call him Lords a dozen of him he could still set large but no matter how many Abraham saw it was still one Lord there is God this is an El Cassidy notice after the battle was over Melchizedek served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here and type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out that's when you for take of Christ become part of this being you get it Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him right battle for life and after the battle is over then God gives you of himself that is this true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become part of God remember at this time the communion had never been instituted not until before the death of Jesus Christ hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later amen but Melchizedek after his child Abraham had won the victory Melchizedek met him and gave him wine and bread amen showing that after this Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the community together it'll be the wedding supper amen amen I will not preach them or the vine or eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you and knew in my father's Kingdom is that right notice again Melchizedek went to meet Abraham before he got back home what a beautiful type here we have Melchizedek meaning Abraham before he got back home after the battle we meet Jesus in the air before we get home that's right II Thessalonians tells us that for we meeting in the air a beautiful type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in the cool of the day we meet him in the air II Thessalonians tells us so far we wish alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first we wish alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air Perfect all these times therefore the theophany if you have died and enter into that theophany what happens the theophany comes to the Earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you're here in the air you take the body to meet the theophany their yarn caught up and go to meet the Lord in the air who is this Melchizedek but God now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in Journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here at least as we teach this closely the stages of are the Eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed notice there is still three stages to Perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages now look first is justification like Luther preach second sanctification like Wesley preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right then comes the rapture now the world how do you redeem the world the first what he did when it's sin he washed it off and water baptism that's right then he dropped his blood up on it from the cross and Sanctified it and called it his own then what does he do as he tore all the world out of you and renovated the whole thing by the fiery baptism the Holy Ghost he also will renovate the world and it'll be burnt over with fire ain't plans ever germ from millions of miles high everything will be cleaned off and then there is a new Heaven and a new Earth just like you are a new creature in Christ Jesus when the Holy Spirit takes a hold of you there you are the whole thing's just as plain as it can be everything's in three the natural verse in three what's the first thing that happens to the woman having a baby what breaks first water what breaks next blood what's the next process like water blood spirit what happens to the plane rocks what's the first thing stop what's the next possible what's the next shove then the green comes out of that just the three stages of it till it gets to the green that's exactly God vindicates that's always been right God vindicates it to be the truth show plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem needs to bring back man amen is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place Hallelujah so it's only the predestinate it will be brought back because others didn't come from there see bring back being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had is thought of what you was only he wanted you to he wanted me to stand the pulpit say he wants you to set the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified State it's mature and brought back again no wonder Paul could say when there is still in the block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your sting amen oh great worries your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory okay he said death tell me where you can make me harder breathe Tell Me How You Gonna Hold Me for I am a possessor of eternal life amen hallelujah you recognize it death hell grave nothing could hold you and nothing can hurt us God eternal life he realized he was blessed with eternal life just like a little Dew Drop if I understand it I don't know too much about chemistry but it must be that it's uh the congelling of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere but the next morning before the sun comes up it's laying there the little fellas shivering but just let the sun come up once you go to shine it's happy why the Sun is going to call it right back to where it come from and that's the way with a Christian Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back to the power that's a police the little dewdrop he glistens and shines and shouts because he knows he come from up there and that son's going to draw him right back up again and a man that's an attribute of God lord of God Amen knows Hallelujah honey come in contact with the Son of God he's going to be brought up from here someday or if I'll be lifted up from the earth I'll draw home remain unto me amen now notice now we see Melchizedek and why that Mary wasn't his mother that's reason he called her woman not mother he had no father for he was the father the Everlasting father the three and the one yeah no mother certainly not he had no father or he was a father as the poet said one time speaking a great compliment unto Jesus he said I am the spoke to Moses in a burning bush of Fire I am the god of Abraham the Bright Morning Star I'm Alpha Omega that they're getting from the end I am the whole creation and Jesus is the name that's right oh who do you say that I am and which do they say that I came do you know my father or can you tell his name Hallelujah it's the father's name yeah come in my father's fathers that have you received me now amen praise the Lord sure he's the same yesterday and forever and this [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
