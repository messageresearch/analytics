TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] to meet our enemy, your enemy out here on the field of battle with the word to drive him away from the midst of your people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they might see tonight, Lord, the gospel light. I pray that you'll anoint our eyes with the Isab. &gt;&gt; Amen. that it might be open to the truth that we might leave here saying within our hearts, "Did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the road? &gt;&gt; Heal the sick and the afflicted. Encourage the discouraged. Lift up the feeble hands that once hung down. May we look to the coming of the Lord Jesus which we believe is at hand." We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Seated. I will try to be briefly tonight because I know many has come from different uh sections of the country to for the service or stayed over some of you and have to go back or maybe a way to get back. I thank you this morning. I want to hear brother Neville myself and I heard him many times and never heard him anytime but what I appreciate him. But this morning, that timely message, I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning. Very fine. And I see why you people like to come and listen to him also. And he'll always do you good, I'm sure, to listen to him. I was trying to catch up on some of my interviews today, this morning, and this afternoon. I still have many, many, many to go. And uh, as I believe it's Jethro told Moses one time said, "It's just too much for you." So, we've got plenty of brothers here on your problems and every one of them has been legitimate and they are fine things that has to be taken care of. And I would recommend our pastor or brother man and other ministers of our faith here. You can go to them. They tell you just exactly the thing to do. Some people their children intermaring or things that's wrong. these men could help you just the same as as anyone else because they're servants of Christ. And go to them and I'm sure they will they will give you the help that you need. I can't get to all of them. There just so many everywhere you go. They just keep accumulating higher and higher. You see, and you want to get to every one of them, but you can't do it. But I'm constantly praying that God in somehow will work it out all right for you. Now, uh, tonight we want to go to the scripture and read a portion of the scripture out of Genesis the 3 chapter and just refer back a little bit to some things that we've been talking about in times past and um, see if the Lord Jesus will give us a little uh, bit more to what we will know when we go out. I pray pray that he will. Now the serpent was more substal than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Yay, God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden." And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden." God has said, "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest you die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God does know that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as God's, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were open, and they knew that they were naked. and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. May the Lord add the his blessings to the reading of his word. Now, I would like to take a text tonight out of that and call Satan's Eden. Very crude little thing to say of Satan's Eden. It kind of matches in the other Sunday night, I believe, when I was speaking to you here about a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste. And sometimes these little crude expressions brings us to something. It gets us to study and put you to reading the word. And that's what I want all my congregation to do. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. So read the word, study it and study it with the eyes uh of God to give your intellectuals understanding of how that we should live in this present day. &gt;&gt; Now to come down tonight just to speak to you to say, "Well, I could do this or that." I'd like to speak with the people as much as I'd like to even go home with each one of you tonight. Uh God knows that's truth. I'd like to go home with each one of you and and eat eat breakfast with you in the morning and and and go out and squirrel hunt with you tomorrow afternoon. See, I I'd like to do that, but I I can't do that. And I would like to go home and just sit down and talk with you, sit on a porch at the service and speak with you a while, talk to you about your welfare and about God. I would love to do that. Men and women in here, God knows I'd like to do that, but I can't do it. is just such a pull and a string and and in this nervous age that we're living in. And I'm a nervous person myself. Today I got my mind made up to something. I've just got to do it and tomorrow it's a million miles from me. Something's done cut in and done this and that. And you have a time trying to keep your wits together. But my main achievement is to preach the gospel &gt;&gt; to the church and do all that I can to bring honor to Jesus Christ in this day while I'm here on earth. and what time I have left on earth. I come to to try to say something to you that would help you. Something I studied after I went home this morning. What could I say tonight, Lord, that would help those people? Listen to that mighty message this morning on brother Neville brought us about I thought it was so wonderful how he said there, a doctor will diagnose a case, but the man that comes with a handful of needles, he gives the injection. So, I thought that was really a a real cute little expression. I thought about that. The serum after the case is diagnosed. And so, that's a very good thing. Uh, I want to speak to you something or bring something to enlighten to you the promise of God for this age. See, something not something that somebody else was in some other day, but something them things are all right. We all refer to those things. But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written here that would enlighten you to know make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before he gets to you. See, that's the main thing is to learn to keep the the punches off of you as much as you can. Now, let us look now to this great for a few minutes, this great sinful day that we're now living in. I don't believe there ever was a day that I've ever read in history. There's been greater days of persecution when the children of God was put to death on ever hand. But to see the deceitfulness of the enemy, we've never had a day like this we're now living. &gt;&gt; It's the most cunning, deceitful day. And when I see that, it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he ever was in any age. &gt;&gt; Now, back in the days of the persecution of Rome to the church, a Christian make a mistake. He went into the arena and was fed to the lions or something like that when they found him being a Christian for his testimony. But his soul was saved because he was a purely unadulterated believer in God and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood as a veins let loose holes in his body and a blood bleed out. He scream up the real loyal faith and say receive my spirit Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; But now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe that they are a Christian when they're not. &gt;&gt; There's the thing you don't have to seal. It's it's a more cunning day than it would be the one you had to seal your your life away with your testimony. The devil has set every cunning trap that he can to He's a deceiver. And Jesus told us in Matthew 24 how this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day that ever lived. So close that would deceive the very elected of God if it were possible for him to deceive. Now, let's compare some scriptures or prophecies spoken of in the Bible for today and compare it with the day that we're now living in. In second Timothy um 3, we learn this that the prophet said that it would come to pass in these days that man would be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Compare that now just for a moment. We won't we'll just brief it because we haven't that much time to go through it all uh like we should duly take it but just to highlight it so that you can see when you get home and study it. Heading, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent and despisers of those that are good. Now the spirit spoke expressingly that these things would be in the latter days. That's these days. The prophecy is speaking to it. Now we read also in Revelations 14 uh Revelations 3:14 rather the lady of see church age that how the church would be in this last age and it would be it says it was set as a widow and had need of nothing. it. It was rich and increased in goods. And know it not that they were poor, miserable, wretched, blind, and naked, and didn't know it. &gt;&gt; That now remember, he's speaking to the church &gt;&gt; of this age, wretched, blind, naked, and don't know it. That last phrase, that last word is what makes it so striking. They think that they are well filled with the spirit. They're already the lady of sin church age is the Pentecostal church age &gt;&gt; because it's the last church age. Luther had his message. Wesley had his message and Pentecost had their message. Also, it said that because you are lukewarm, neither hot or cold, the emotions of the outside, the mental conception of the gospel, and because he said, "You're that way, I'll spew you out of my mouth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, it made him sick uh to see the church in that condition. And remember, they spewed him out and he was on the outside of the church trying to get back on the inside. in that awful lady of Canting. The god of this world today, the worship person of this world today is Satan. &gt;&gt; And the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's Satan impersonating himself as the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the church. They worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church. My Lord. &gt;&gt; But it's the way Satan has done it. Oh, you say, "But wait a minute. We preached the word." Look back here at my text tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For Satan was the one preached the word to Eve first. God has said, &gt;&gt; see, &gt;&gt; it's that miscon &gt;&gt; that applies to the day. He let you know all Jesus did was perfectly well. He let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well. But when you take the promises that they gave for this day, then that was applied to another age. That's just all he has to do. See, is to get the people to believe it that way. And that's that's all. For you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it. But that's what he does. People ignorantly worshiping Satan thinking they are worshiping God. My Lord, &gt;&gt; as we're warned by prophecy in 2 Thessalonians that let's just read that 2 Thessalonians the 2 chapter. Let's just get it a moment if I can right away. I'd like to read that just I believe second Thessalonians I got the scripture here and say now we beseech you brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus and by the gathering together unto him. I see the coming of the Lord and the gathering to him as God will gather his people to him in the last days. &gt;&gt; The gathering of the people to the Lord, not to the church, to the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in your mind or troubled troubled neither by spirit or word of letter as from us as the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come except there come a falling away first. And that man of sin. Man of sin. Watch what he is now. A man of sin be revealed the son of predition. That was Judas. &gt;&gt; See who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped. know that he as God siteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That deceitfulness of the church of the day. See the son of predition, the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of predition, the devil. Then people worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God. But they're worshiping him through a creed of man-made denominations and creeds that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known of. &gt;&gt; No matter how much the word of God of promise for this day is preached and vindicated, they still won't believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They won't believe it. Then why? We wonder why why doesn't it why won't they believe it when God said he'd do a certain thing and he doesn't? And still they turned their back from it and turned away from it just as Eve knew that what God said God would do. But she turned her back on it to listen to what he had to say. Just remember in other ages it's always been the same thing. In every age it's always been that Satan tries to pervert that word to them making them see some other age. Look, when Jesus come, see, Satan was in that bunch of Jewish teachers and rabbis and priests trying to tell them to keep the law of Moses when their very word said that in that day the son of man would be revealed. See, that he would reveal himself. So, they was trying as long as they kept him religious and on the law of Moses, see what he did? He was trying to tell them that part of the word is just exactly right, but this man isn't that person. &gt;&gt; See how deceiving he is? That's that real day of deception. It's been and now is Satan establishing his kingdom in the earth. That's exactly why he's doing it. For he wants to establish his own kingdom &gt;&gt; as a businessman that's not a Christian. He'll work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way. If he's got a a purpose and a personal gain in making you doing that, making you see it that way, he'll show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's got a feeling only for himself. No matter how much he lies and cheats and whatever more, he's got personal gain. And that's why Satan's done this. And he's worked through the ministry to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As God promised he would do. Now, he began by a religious deceit in Eden and has continued ever since. Not by setting up a bunch of communist. Communist has nothing to do with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the church that's where you have to watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it's not the It's not the communist that would deceive the very elected. It's the church that'll deceive the very elected. &gt;&gt; See, it isn't communist. We know they deny God. They're an antichrist. Sure, they are in principle, but they are not the antichrist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The antichrist is religious, &gt;&gt; very religious, &gt;&gt; and can quote the scripture and make it look so plain as Satan did back there in the beginning. He quoted everything right now. God has said, "Thou shalt not eat every tree of the garden." See, quote her. She said, "Yes, we may eat of all the trees of the garden, but there is a tree in the midst of the garden that God said not to eat, for not even touch it, cause the day we did, that day we die." He said, "Oh, surely you'll not die." But let me give you the reason why God said this is because, see, he now what he quoted this truth. You see, he said, "It'll open your eyes and it'll make you know good and wrong. You'll be like God then if you can do it." That's just what he wants to do. And that's just the same thing he's trying to do today. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's been a religious deceit since the very beginning of Eden and has been ever since. In Adam's time, it was a deceit. In Noah's time, it was a deceit. In Jesus' time was the same and now is the same. The same way of religious deceitfulness. &gt;&gt; Now, we will notice the earth when God had it under control. Now when God had it had it under his control then when Satan took over by uh rejecting the word of God, God one time had the earth under his control. &gt;&gt; He set it in this orbit. He put it make it work. He done everything. Had it in his control. Now we'll compare that with after Satan took it in his control. Now it took God 6,000 years. It didn't take him that long, but he took that long. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
