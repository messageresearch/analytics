[0:00] this is the last warning
[0:02] there will not be another
[0:04] the throne room has been set up
[0:06] the 12 foundations have been laid the
[0:09] streets of gold have been paved the
[0:12] gates of gigantic pearls are raised and
[0:14] hinged
[0:15] like a pyramid she stands so fair and
[0:17] glorious
[0:18] the heavenly beings who have prepared
[0:20] her watch breathlessly for she glistens
[0:23] and shines with the glory that is
[0:24] unearthly
[0:26] every facet of her beauty tells a story
[0:28] of amazing grace and jesus love
[0:31] she is a city prepared for a prepared
[0:33] people
[0:34] she awaits only for her inhabitants and
[0:36] soon they will throng her streets with
[0:38] joy
[0:39] yes it is the last call
[0:42] the spirit will not speak in another age
[0:45] the ages are over
[0:47] but thank god at this moment this age is
[0:49] not over
[0:50] he is yet crying
[0:52] and his cry is not only in the spiritual
[0:54] ears of men by his spirit but once again
[0:57] a prophet is in the land
[0:59] once more god will reveal the truth as
[1:01] he did to paul
[1:03] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[1:05] the days of the laodicean age its
[1:07] messenger will reveal the mysteries of
[1:09] god as revealed to paul he will speak
[1:12] out and those who receive that prophet
[1:15] in his own name will receive the
[1:16] beneficent effect of that prophet's
[1:18] ministry
[1:20] and they that hear him will be blessed
[1:21] and become part of that bride of the
[1:23] last day who are mentioned in revelation
[1:25] 22 17.
[1:27] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:30] the corn of wheat the bride wheat that
[1:32] fell into the ground at nicea has come
[1:35] back to original word grain again
[1:38] praise god forever yes listen to the
[1:40] authenticated prophet of god who appears
[1:42] in this last age
[1:44] what he says from god the bride will say
[1:47] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:49] will be saying the same thing
[1:52] and what they will say will have already
[1:53] been said in the word
[1:55] they are saying it now
[1:57] come out from among her now and be ye
[2:00] separate
[2:01] the cry has gone out the cry is going
[2:03] out
[2:04] how long will the voice cry
[2:07] we do not know but one thing we do know
[2:09] it won't be long for this is the last
[2:11] age
[2:13] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:15] the spirit saith to the churches
[2:17] the spirit has spoken
[2:19] the setting sun is about to fade into
[2:21] eternity for the church ages
[2:24] then it will be all over
[2:25] then it will be too late to come
[2:28] but if somewhere in this series god has
[2:30] dealt with you by his spirit
[2:32] may you even now turn to him in
[2:34] repentance and give your life to him
[2:37] that by his spirit he may give you
[2:39] eternal life
[2:42] chapter 10
[2:43] [Music]
[2:46] a resume of the ages
[2:48] due to the fact that our studies have
[2:50] been aversed by verse exposition of
[2:52] those scriptures that deal with the
[2:53] seven ages we have not set forth a
[2:55] continuous historical pattern of the
[2:57] church as much as we ought to have done
[3:00] it is therefore our purpose now to take
[3:02] this chapter and beginning with the
[3:04] ephesian age traced through all ages the
[3:07] church and her history as given to john
[3:09] by the spirit of god
[3:11] we will not be adding new material as
[3:13] much as correlating what we already have
[3:16] from our studies we have already learned
[3:18] that much of the revelation is totally
[3:20] misunderstood because we have not
[3:22] formally known that the church spoken of
[3:24] and spoken to in this book does not
[3:27] refer to the pure ecclesia the elect the
[3:30] body of christ
[3:31] the bride but it speaks to the entire
[3:34] body of people who are called christians
[3:36] whether they be true or merely nominal
[3:39] as all israel is not israel so all
[3:41] christians are not christians
[3:44] thus we learned that the church is made
[3:45] up of two vines the true and the false
[3:49] the two vines are motivated by two kinds
[3:51] of spirits
[3:52] one has the holy spirit while the other
[3:54] is endued with the spirit of antichrist
[3:57] both claim to know and be known of god
[4:00] both purport to speak for god
[4:02] both believe certain very basic truths
[4:04] and differ on others
[4:06] but since both bear the name of the lord
[4:08] being called christians
[4:10] and by such name-bearing obviously claim
[4:13] a relationship to him god calls it
[4:15] marriage god now holds them both
[4:17] responsible to him and therefore speaks
[4:19] to each
[4:20] we further learned that these two vines
[4:22] would grow side by side until the end of
[4:25] the ages when both would come to
[4:26] maturity and both be harvested
[4:29] the false vine would not overcome and
[4:31] destroy the true vine but then neither
[4:33] would the true vine be able to bring the
[4:35] false vine into a saving relationship
[4:37] with jesus christ
[4:40] we learned the most amazing truth that
[4:42] the holy spirit could and would fall
[4:44] upon the unregenerate false vine
[4:46] christians and manifest powerfully in
[4:48] various signs and wonders even as judas
[4:51] had a definite ministry in the holy
[4:52] ghost though he himself was pronounced
[4:55] to be a devil
[4:57] with these principles in mind we start
[4:59] to trace the church through the various
[5:00] seven ages
[5:03] the birth of the church was at pentecost
[5:05] as the first adam was given a bride
[5:07] fresh from the hand of god and was
[5:08] undefiled for a brief span so was christ
[5:11] the last adam given a bride pure and
[5:13] fresh at pentecost and she remained
[5:16] separate and undefiled for some time
[5:19] and of the rest there's no man join
[5:21] himself to them
[5:23] acts 5 13 and
[5:25] the lord added daily such as should be
[5:27] saved acts 2 47
[5:30] how long this continued we do not know
[5:33] but one day even as he was tempted and
[5:35] seduced by satan so the church was
[5:37] contaminated by the entrance of an
[5:39] antichrist spirit
[5:41] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[5:43] whereof ye have heard that it should
[5:44] come and even now already is it in the
[5:46] world
[5:47] first john 4 3
[5:50] and jesus said concerning his bride in
[5:52] that first age
[5:54] i have somewhat against thee because
[5:56] thou hast left thy first love
[5:58] remember therefore from whence thou art
[6:00] fallen and repent
[6:02] revelation 2 4-5
[6:06] the church was in that first age already
[6:08] a fallen woman
[6:09] as satan had gotten to weave before adam
[6:11] even now had satan seduced the church
[6:14] the bride of christ before the marriage
[6:16] supper of the lamb
[6:17] and what specifically was in her midst
[6:19] that caused the fall
[6:21] what but revelation 2 6
[6:23] the deeds of the nicolaitans
[6:26] already that first age had turned from
[6:28] following the pure word of god
[6:30] they turned from god's demand of a
[6:32] church absolutely dependent upon him
[6:34] depending entirely upon god to fulfill
[6:37] his word from start to finish apart from
[6:39] human government to nicolaitanism which
[6:42] is organizing a human government within
[6:44] the church which as all governments do
[6:46] legislate for the people
[6:48] they did exactly what israel did
[6:50] they took the expediency of human
[6:52] government instead of the word and the
[6:54] spirit
[6:56] death had entered
[6:57] how do we know
[6:58] do we not hear the voice of the spirit
[7:00] raised in that first age for all who
[7:02] will hear as he is calling to him that
[7:05] overcometh will i give to eat of the
[7:07] tree of life in the paradise of god
[7:10] the church had already imbibed too
[7:12] deeply of the tree of death or the
[7:14] denominational false vine whose end is
[7:17] the lake of fire
[7:19] but there are no cherubim with flaming
[7:20] swords to guard the tree of life now
[7:23] god does not now depart from the midst
[7:25] of the church as he departed from eden
[7:27] oh no he will ever be in the midst of
[7:30] his church until the final age and until
[7:32] that time he calls to all to come
[7:35] now please let us be careful here
[7:38] this message to the angel of the church
[7:40] which is at ephesus is not a message to
[7:42] the actual local ephesian church
[7:44] it is a message to the age
[7:47] and that age had in it the seed of truth
[7:49] and the seed of error exactly is set
[7:51] forth according to the parable of the
[7:53] wheat and the tares
[7:54] the church ages is the field and in it
[7:57] are wheat and tares
[7:59] the false church organized humanized the
[8:01] government and the word and fought the
[8:03] true christian
[8:05] tears always flourish mightier than
[8:07] wheat or any other cultivated plant the
[8:09] tare church grew rapidly in this first
[8:11] age
[8:12] but the wheat church was flourishing
[8:14] also by the end of the first age the
[8:16] deeds of the nicolaitans were
[8:18] flourishing in the local false vine
[8:20] churches with increasing attempts to
[8:22] spread their influence further than
[8:23] their own body
[8:24] its influence was felt upon the true
[8:26] church for men like the venerable
[8:28] polycarp were calling themselves bishops
[8:30] with a reference to that title which was
[8:32] not inherent in it according to the word
[8:35] also in that age the true church had
[8:37] lost its first love
[8:39] that love was typified as the love of
[8:41] bride and groom at their marriage and
[8:43] early years of wedded life
[8:45] there was a cooling of that complete
[8:47] love and abandonment to god
[8:49] but notice
[8:50] revelation 2 1 describes the lord jesus
[8:53] as in the midst of his church and
[8:55] holding the messengers in his right hand
[8:57] because this bride has fallen because
[9:00] the church corporate is now an admixture
[9:02] of true and false he does not leave it
[9:05] it is his
[9:06] and according to romans 14 7-9 that is
[9:09] exactly right
[9:11] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[9:13] man dieth to himself
[9:15] for whether we live we live unto the
[9:17] lord and whether we die we die unto the
[9:19] lord whether we live therefore or die we
[9:23] are the lords
[9:24] for to this end christ both died and
[9:27] rose and revived that he might be lord
[9:29] both of the dead and living
[9:32] on the cross he bought the whole world
[9:34] of people they are his
[9:36] he is the lord of the living and dead
[9:38] as pertaining to ownership not
[9:40] relationship
[9:42] and he walks in the midst of that body
[9:43] that has within it life and death
[9:47] what was planted in the first age will
[9:48] develop in the second age and in all
[9:51] other ages until it comes to maturity
[9:53] and harvest
[9:54] thus in the smyrnian age we expect an
[9:56] enlargement and enlightenment of the
[9:58] church corporates history through a
[10:00] revelation of the spirit
[10:02] in this age the hatred of the false vine
[10:04] increases
[10:06] see they have verse 9 separated
[10:09] themselves from the company of the true
[10:11] they went out from them they were liars
[10:14] they called themselves what they are not
[10:16] but did god destroy them
[10:18] no
[10:19] let them alone and both will go to the
[10:21] harvest
[10:22] but lord they should be destroyed for
[10:24] they are destroying thy people they are
[10:26] killing them
[10:27] no let them alone
[10:29] but to my bride i say be thou faithful
[10:32] unto death
[10:33] love me even more
[10:35] we learn in no uncertain terms that this
[10:38] false vine is the vine of satan
[10:40] their gathering is of him
[10:42] satan
[10:43] they meet in the name of god and lie
[10:45] that they are christ's
[10:46] they preach they teach they baptize they
[10:49] worship they partake of various rites
[10:51] given by christ to the church yet they
[10:53] are not of god
[10:55] but since they say they are god will
[10:57] hold them responsible and in each age he
[11:00] speaks of them and to them they remind
[11:02] us exactly of balaam
[11:04] he had the prophetic office
[11:06] he knew the proper approach unto god as
[11:08] demonstrated in the sacrifice of the
[11:10] clean beasts
[11:11] yet he was not a true word prophet for
[11:14] when god told him not to go to honor
[11:16] balak with his presence he sought to go
[11:18] anyway for he was motivated by his lust
[11:21] for gold and prestige
[11:23] so god let him go
[11:25] the perfect will of god gave way to the
[11:27] permissive will of god because of the
[11:29] heart desire of balaam
[11:31] god actually said
[11:33] go ahead
[11:34] did god change his mind
[11:36] no sir
[11:38] god had his way regardless of balaam
[11:40] going balaam did not know the will of
[11:42] god
[11:43] god had his way regardless
[11:45] it was balaam who was the loser for he
[11:48] bypassed the word
[11:49] and today we have that very same thing
[11:52] women preachers organization false
[11:55] doctrine etc and people worshiping god
[11:58] manifesting in the spirit and going
[12:00] right on as did balaam
[12:02] claiming that god has spoken to them
[12:04] even when the commission received his
[12:05] opposite to the revealed word
[12:08] and i will not deny that god spoke to
[12:10] them
[12:10] but it was just like when he spoke to
[12:12] balaam that second time
[12:14] as he knew that balaam wanted his own
[12:16] heart desire above the word and he gave
[12:18] it to him yet all the while in the end
[12:21] having his own way
[12:23] even so today god tells folks to go
[12:25] ahead in their own hearts desires for
[12:27] they have already rejected the word
[12:30] but the will of god will be done
[12:32] regardless
[12:33] amen
[12:34] i hope you see this
[12:36] it will not only clear up much of what
[12:38] is seen in all ages but it will
[12:40] especially help in this last age which
[12:43] has so much manifestation and external
[12:45] blessings when the whole period is so
[12:47] against the word revealed will of god
[12:51] if ever an age received a message loud
[12:53] and clear this age did
[12:55] it was and is that old testament truth
[12:58] the son of the bond woman will distress
[13:00] the son of the free woman until the son
[13:02] of the bond woman be cast out
[13:05] that lets us know that the hatred and
[13:06] blasphemy of satan against the true
[13:08] christian will be vented through a group
[13:10] who are nominal false christians and
[13:13] this will increase until god uproots
[13:15] that false vine at the end of the
[13:16] laodicean age
[13:18] the third age revealed by the spirit of
[13:20] prophecy that the worldly church would
[13:22] adopt nicolaitanism as a doctrine
[13:25] the separation of the clergy from the
[13:26] laity grew from the biblical truth of
[13:28] the elders shepherds of local flocks
[13:32] ruling the flock by the word to the
[13:34] deeds of nicolaitans wherein the clergy
[13:36] set themselves in ranks one over the
[13:38] other which unscriptural formula then
[13:40] evolved into a priesthood that placed
[13:43] the clergy between man and god
[13:45] giving the clergy certain rights all the
[13:47] while denying the laity their god-given
[13:49] rights
[13:50] this was usurpation
[13:52] in this age it became a doctrine
[13:54] it was established in the church as the
[13:56] assured word of god which indeed it was
[13:58] not
[13:59] but the clergy called it the word of god
[14:01] and therefore the doctrine was
[14:02] antichrist
[14:05] because human government is politics
[14:07] pure and simple the church became
[14:09] involved in politics
[14:11] this involvement was welcomed by a
[14:12] dictator emperor who joined church
[14:14] politics with state politics and by
[14:17] force established a false church satan's
[14:20] false religion as the true religion
[14:23] and through various edicts by various
[14:24] emperors we find the false church with
[14:27] state power destroying the true vine
[14:29] even more avidly
[14:31] sad to say the true vine was not exactly
[14:33] immune to this doctrine
[14:35] by that i do not mean that the true vine
[14:38] ever did establish the nicolaitan ideas
[14:40] as a doctrine far from it
[14:42] but that little worm of death kept
[14:44] sucking at the true vine hoping that it
[14:46] might fall
[14:48] even within the true church men whom god
[14:50] had called as overseers were holding
[14:52] that title to mean a little more than
[14:54] just a local responsibility
[14:56] it was not the clear understanding of
[14:58] paul that existed in the church at this
[15:00] time
[15:01] for paul had said
[15:02] and they glorified god in me
[15:05] no matter what authority paul had he
[15:07] kept the people looking to god from whom
[15:09] is all authority
[15:11] but the clergy was always looking to
[15:12] divine leadership plus human
[15:15] and thus in giving honor where honor was
[15:17] not due
[15:18] we find that the true church was spotted
[15:20] with humanism
[15:21] with nicolaitanism established apostolic
[15:24] succession placed ministers pastors
[15:27] voted in etc it was only one step for
[15:30] the false church to proceed to balaamism
[15:33] the second step to the depth of satan
[15:35] was now in full progress
[15:38] this second step was the doctrine of
[15:40] balaam described in revelation 2 14
[15:43] wherein balaam taught balak to stumble
[15:45] the children of israel by a united
[15:47] meeting
[15:48] there the guests would do two more
[15:50] things contrary to the word of god
[15:52] you will recall that balak needed help
[15:54] to keep his kingdom he called on the
[15:57] most dominant spiritual figure of his
[15:58] day balaam
[16:00] balaam gave the advice that trapped and
[16:02] destroyed israel
[16:04] it was first of all to suggest that they
[16:07] all get together and talk things over
[16:09] and eat together and get things ironed
[16:11] out
[16:12] after all understanding each other goes
[16:14] a long way
[16:15] once you accomplish that you can go from
[16:17] there the next step would be worshiping
[16:20] together and of course a little pressure
[16:22] from the host usually makes the guests
[16:24] go a lot further than they intended
[16:27] now that didn't only happen back there
[16:29] to god's church of the old testament but
[16:31] it happened to the church of the new
[16:32] testament for there was an emperor who
[16:35] like balak needed help to secure his
[16:37] kingdom so constantine invited the
[16:39] nominal christian first christian church
[16:41] of rome to help him get the christians
[16:43] behind him as they were a very large
[16:45] body
[16:46] the outcome was the nicene council of
[16:48] 325.
[16:50] there the christians both true and
[16:52] nominal came together at the invitation
[16:54] of constantine
[16:55] the true christians had no business even
[16:58] going up to the meeting
[16:59] in spite of all constantine could do to
[17:01] unite them all the real believers knew
[17:04] they were out of place and left
[17:06] but to those who remained constantine
[17:08] gave of the state's treasury along with
[17:10] political and physical force
[17:12] the people were introduced to idol
[17:14] worship and spiritism for statues with
[17:17] names of saints were placed in the
[17:18] buildings and the people were taught to
[17:20] commune with the dead or pray to saints
[17:23] which is nothing more or less than
[17:24] spiritism
[17:26] for the food that man truly needs even
[17:28] the word of god they were given creeds
[17:31] and dogmas and rituals which were also
[17:34] enforced by the state and above all they
[17:36] were given three gods with the triple
[17:38] compound name of the one true god and
[17:41] water baptism in the name of the lord
[17:43] jesus christ gave way to the pagan
[17:45] baptism of three titles
[17:48] the real believers ought not to have
[17:49] gone there
[17:50] they had already lost much truth and now
[17:53] they too would lose the understanding of
[17:55] godhead and forfeit names for titles in
[17:57] water baptism
[17:59] now watch this doctrine of balaam most
[18:01] carefully
[18:02] notice above all
[18:03] that it is the deliberate maneuver of a
[18:05] corrupt clergy to bind the people to
[18:07] them
[18:08] by leading the people deliberately into
[18:09] the sin of unbelief
[18:11] the nicolaitan doctrine was the
[18:13] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[18:14] political power amongst themselves
[18:17] while balaamism is the subjection of the
[18:19] people to their system of creed and
[18:21] worship in order to hold them
[18:23] now watch this carefully
[18:25] what was it that bound the people to the
[18:27] nominal church and thereby destroyed
[18:29] them
[18:30] it was the creeds and dogmas formed into
[18:32] church tenets it was the doctrine of the
[18:34] roman catholic church
[18:36] they were not given the true food the
[18:38] word
[18:39] they were given the food that came from
[18:41] idol worship
[18:42] babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[18:44] christian terminology
[18:46] and that very same spirit and doctrine
[18:48] is right amongst all protestants and it
[18:51] is called denomination
[18:53] nicolaitanism is organization humanizing
[18:56] the leadership of the church and thereby
[18:58] deposing the spirit
[19:00] balaamism is denominationalism which
[19:02] takes the church manual instead of the
[19:04] bible
[19:05] and right to this hour many of god's
[19:07] people are caught in the snare of
[19:08] denominationalism and god is crying to
[19:10] them
[19:11] come out of her my people lest ye be
[19:13] partakers of her sins and that you
[19:15] receive not her plagues
[19:18] you see they are ignorant
[19:20] but if the rapture should take place at
[19:21] this moment ignorance would be no court
[19:24] of appeal from the judgment of god for
[19:26] being in the wrong ranks
[19:29] for the clergy to organize themselves
[19:30] with one rank over another until they
[19:32] are finally headed up by a president is
[19:35] a manifestation of the antichrist spirit
[19:37] regardless of how wonderful and
[19:39] necessary it may seem
[19:41] it is nothing but human reasoning taking
[19:43] the place of the word
[19:45] and any person who is in the organized
[19:47] denominations is right in the midst of
[19:49] an antichrist system
[19:51] now let me say this and make it very
[19:53] plain
[19:54] i am not against the people
[19:56] i am against the system
[19:59] with a state and church union the stage
[20:01] has been set for the dark ages
[20:04] and indeed for about 1 000 years the
[20:06] church went into the depth of blackness
[20:08] knowing the depths of satan
[20:10] when any religious people embrace both
[20:12] nicolaitanism and balaamism and have the
[20:15] political financial and physical power
[20:17] to back it up there is only one
[20:19] direction they can go
[20:20] that direction is right into the jezebel
[20:23] doctrine
[20:24] now why do we say this
[20:26] because as we pointed out in this study
[20:28] of the fourth age that jezebel was a
[20:30] sidonian the daughter of ethbale who was
[20:32] king priest to astarte
[20:34] he was a murderer
[20:36] this woman married ahab king of israel
[20:39] for political expediency
[20:41] she then took over the religion of the
[20:43] people and murdered the levites and
[20:45] erected temples wherein she caused the
[20:47] people to worship astarte
[20:49] venus and bale
[20:50] sun god
[20:52] she formulated the teaching and made her
[20:54] priests teach it and they in turn made
[20:56] the people accept it
[20:58] there you can see exactly what the
[20:59] nominal church was in the dark ages
[21:02] they left the word of god entirely
[21:04] except for names and titles of godhead
[21:06] and a few scriptural principles
[21:09] they twisted what they did take out of
[21:10] the bible by changing its meaning
[21:13] their college of bishops etc wrote vast
[21:15] treatises
[21:16] their popes declared themselves
[21:18] infallible and said they received
[21:20] revelation from god and spoke as god to
[21:22] the people
[21:24] all this was taught to the priests who
[21:26] through fear made the people believe it
[21:28] to dissent was death or excommunication
[21:30] which might be worse than death
[21:32] it was now the church with the assured
[21:34] voice that took over and wild with power
[21:37] they drank the blood of the martyrs
[21:39] until the true christians were all but
[21:40] exterminated and there was hardly any
[21:43] word left
[21:44] and little manifestation of the holy
[21:46] ghost
[21:47] but the true vine struggled and survived
[21:50] god was faithful to the little flock and
[21:52] in spite of what rome might do to their
[21:53] bodies rome could not kill the spirit
[21:56] within them and the light of the truth
[21:58] shone on backed by the holy ghost and
[22:00] power
[22:02] this is a good place to make an
[22:03] illuminating observation
[22:05] look
[22:06] the deeds and doctrines of the
[22:08] nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam and
[22:10] the teaching of the false prophetess
[22:12] jezebel do not constitute three spirits
[22:14] or make three spiritual principles
[22:17] these three are but the various
[22:18] manifestations of the same spirit as it
[22:20] goes from depth to depth
[22:23] what it all is is the antichrist spirit
[22:25] of organization in its three various
[22:27] stages
[22:28] once the clergy separated themselves and
[22:31] organized themselves they oppressed the
[22:33] people by leading them into and binding
[22:35] them to organization also
[22:37] this organization was based upon the
[22:40] creeds and dogma which they taught the
[22:42] people instead of the pure word of god
[22:44] ritual and ceremony was given an
[22:46] increasing part in worship
[22:48] and soon this whole system was a
[22:50] militant and diabolical power that did
[22:52] its best to control all through the
[22:54] persuasion of discourse or literal force
[22:57] it received its energy from its own
[22:59] false prophecies and not the word of god
[23:02] it was now absolutely antichrist though
[23:04] it came in christ's name
[23:07] after what seemed an interminable time
[23:09] wherein truth must surely die
[23:12] men began to protest the vileness of the
[23:14] roman catholic church because by no
[23:16] stretch of the imagination could god be
[23:18] in such teaching and such conduct
[23:20] these protests were either disregarded
[23:23] and died from failure to arouse
[23:24] attention or were quashed by rome
[23:27] but then god in his sovereign grace sent
[23:30] a messenger by the name of martin luther
[23:32] to start a reformation
[23:33] he worked in a climate where the roman
[23:35] catholic church had been given so much
[23:37] rope that she was about to hang herself
[23:40] so when luther preached justification by
[23:42] faith the true vine for the first time
[23:45] in many centuries began to grow in a
[23:46] bountiful manner
[23:48] as the nominal church had used state
[23:50] power to back it up now state power
[23:52] began to flow against it
[23:54] and this is where luther made his
[23:56] mistake and the true believers made
[23:58] their mistake
[23:59] they allowed the state to subsidize them
[24:02] so this age did not launch out very far
[24:04] on the word
[24:05] thank god that it did go as far as it
[24:07] did but because it leaned on political
[24:10] power to a great extent this age ended
[24:12] in organization and this very group that
[24:15] in luther's generation had broken from
[24:17] the false vine now turned back to become
[24:19] a daughter of the harlot for she went
[24:21] right into nicolaitanism and balaamism
[24:24] this era had scores of factions within
[24:26] it and to prove how far they were from
[24:29] true seed is to merely read history and
[24:31] see how they persecuted each other even
[24:33] unto death in some cases
[24:36] but there were a few names amongst them
[24:38] even as there always are in every age
[24:42] we rejoice in this age for this one
[24:45] thing reformation had started it was not
[24:48] a resurrection but a reformation
[24:50] neither was it a restoration
[24:52] but the corn of wheat that had died at
[24:54] nicaea and had rotted in the dark ages
[24:57] now sent up a shoot of truth signifying
[25:00] that at some future date at the end of
[25:02] the laodicean age just before jesus came
[25:05] the church would go back to being a
[25:06] wheat seed bride again while the tares
[25:09] would be harvested and burned in the
[25:10] lake of fire
[25:13] since the fifth age had brought a great
[25:15] dissemination of the word through
[25:16] printing the sixth stage was quick to
[25:18] take advantage of it
[25:20] this age was the second stage of the
[25:22] restoration and as we have stated
[25:24] previously was the tassel age
[25:26] education abounded
[25:28] this was the age of intellectual men who
[25:30] loved god and served him
[25:32] missionaries abounded and the word
[25:34] spread over the world
[25:35] it was an age of brotherly love
[25:38] it was an age of the open door it was
[25:40] the last age of long duration and after
[25:42] it the laodicean age would come which
[25:45] would be a short one
[25:47] the true vine flourished in this age as
[25:49] in no other when one thinks of numbers
[25:51] at home and abroad
[25:52] this age brought holy men to the
[25:54] forefront the true vine spread and the
[25:57] false vine receded
[25:58] everywhere the true vine went god gave
[26:01] light and life and happiness the false
[26:03] vine was shown up for what it was
[26:06] darkness misery poverty illiteracy and
[26:09] death and as the false vine in its day
[26:11] of power could not kill the true vine
[26:14] neither could the true vine now bring
[26:15] back the false vine to jesus christ
[26:18] but the false vine entrenched itself
[26:21] waiting for the last part of the last
[26:22] age when it would win all back to itself
[26:25] except that small flock that were the
[26:27] elect true vine of god
[26:30] but how sad does this age make us feel
[26:32] as we realize that every great move of
[26:34] god and there were many neglected to
[26:37] throw off the nicolaitan doctrine for
[26:39] they all organized and died
[26:42] then they moved into denominations to
[26:43] hold the spiritually dead in foodless
[26:45] pastures
[26:46] little did they know it but each group
[26:49] was tainted with that same error and
[26:51] when the revival fire burned low
[26:53] organization took over and people became
[26:55] denominations
[26:57] they were only nominal christians though
[26:59] each group claimed with the very same
[27:00] assurance as the roman catholic church
[27:02] that they were right and all others
[27:04] wrong
[27:05] the stage was truly set for the
[27:07] daughters to go back home in the last
[27:09] age back to rome under the mother hen
[27:13] and so we come to the last age the
[27:15] laodicean age
[27:17] that is our age
[27:19] we know it is the last age for the jews
[27:21] are back in palestine
[27:23] no matter how they got there they are
[27:25] there
[27:26] and this is harvest time but before
[27:28] there can be a harvest there has to be a
[27:30] ripening a maturing of both the vines
[27:34] the lutheran age was the springtime
[27:37] the wesleyan age was the summer of
[27:39] growth
[27:40] the laodicea
[28:14] you
