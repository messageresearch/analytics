just so grateful to be here father lord with saints of like faith lord and or despite the chaos the world is in father despite the fear and the uncertainty all around father every time they they think they've come up with a solution to a problem father then then it changes and the problem becomes worse than ever was before and they they they run in fear again father lord and scripture tells us that it ends the end times that they would run in fear to hide under the rocks in the caves and the hills of and and ask them to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of the lamb father and lord we know we aren't yet in that extreme position but knowing that we're in an overlapping period we see these plagues coming upon the earth father and lord it's not a thing for us to fear father but the thing for us to rejoice and know that your word is true father and the time is near and all we have to do is get ourselves ready we don't have to worry we don't have to worry about the disease the plague the wars the famine father for you said you would care for us father you said by your stripes we are healed you said that lord if you cared for even the sparrow that would fall from the sky how much more would you care for us if you dress the lily in the field how much more your children lord and so we don't need to do anything but just believe believe by faith stop stop worrying stop doubting and watch you work on the scene father lord oh it's true sickness may strike but that's still just another chance for us to raise up in faith and believe that you're still a healer lord and even if the world would look and see circumstances and things happen that can't be explained we can still look to you knowing that you are in control father knowing that not one thing is out of control lord the devil would like to try and say show us how he's thrown a monkey wrench in god's plan and how maybe maybe you're not a son or you're not a daughter because look at what's going on in your life and yet lord that's what he tried to convince the disciples of at the crucifixion that maybe this wasn't the messiah maybe this wasn't what was meant to be but all they had to do is wait for that resurrection morning father lord we know there's a great resurrection coming and we'll just keep holding on father to your hand as you hold on to us and lord we know we'll see that bright resurrection day dawn we'll see you coming in the clouds as we rise up to meet you father we're so looking forward to that day and that time or we just ask for your presence to come on by this evening father lord you had worked through the minister father lord that you would come and speak to your people father lift to ear father not maybe even the the actual word that is traveling from the minister's mouth father but lord your word father would travel to the heart of the believer and touch them in their need father so we just dedicate ourselves back to you once again this evening lord knowing that you are in control give you all the honor the glory and the praise in jesus most wonderful and precious name amen [Music] the lord praise the lord amen amen we can look to the resurrection but just like paul said if the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body amen so we have a resurrection year there's a resurrection coming but we have a resurrection year which is the quickening power praise the lord let's just sing that for us the same old spirit i raised jesus from the dead [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] you [Music] let's just praise the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] you hallelujah we have a promise amen we have a promise amen we want to thank the lord [Music] praise the lord [Music] amen amen [Music] we also want to greet the different families at home that are streaming the service tonight we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus praise the lord [Music] [Music] amen [Music] i'm trying to look further the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord that's what happened when you are nervous you have too many things going through your head and there is uh there's a song that a brother sunk uh i believe jesus save i i think i sent it over to praise the lord and uh that's uh uh one of believer wrote this song i can't remember remember the brother name now i believe [Music] okay let me do something here let me start from the stand sir i always are always wanted to uh us to learn in this age of confusion there's dissolution everywhere it's hard to find a peace of mind or someone who really cares aha i have pulled my trust in jesus he's like no other friend i know his word is truth he will see me true i believe jesus i believe jesus say i believe the crown of life ways beyond the grace believe the path of say i've told and prayed i can touch the heart of god i believe the old time way i

the old-time way i believe jesus okay i'm not getting the right [Music] i confess i'm not getting the right praise the lord amen let's stand to our feet amen i'm covered i'm covered by the blood let's sing that chorus and then we'll turn the service around tonight for what we want to share with you we'll do more practice on that i'm covered i'm covered by the blood i'm walking by faith living in love [Music] i am covered [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] oh yes i am jesus has rescued me [Music] covered by his jesus [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you tonight let's take our bibles amen last week we were talking a little bit about possessing our vessel praise the lord amen let's go over to the book of james praise the lord what a time we hope that uh the fellowship of the world has been a blessing to you praise the lord amen you pray for me tonight and we just want to trust that the lord will be able to take a portion here and speak to our hearts james chapter 3. let's read from verse one my brethrens being that many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we will offend all if any man offend not in word the sin is a perfect man able also to brother the whole body behold we put a bed in the hurst mouth the hearse's mouth that they may obey us and we can turn their whole body the lord bless you have your seat i know you know where i'm going with this tonight uh we're going back a little bit on the on the subject of possessing the least member of the body praise the lord as we talk about possessing our inheritance and [Music] is striking that the world will make us to see here that if we can bring our tongue under control we can step into perfection very quickly praise the lord then practicing all the rules uh and then and all the regulation and you know when being all the commandment if we can bring our tongue under control we can be able to step into godly perfection now seamless perfection but the righteousness that comes back by grace by the by the lord by the love of god and now so james continued down here [Music] and you know i had i had a subject on my mind uh from james chapter three and then i'm kind of for interfering because that is not what i want to talk about but i had a subject and because i was looking at something one day and that i was going to entitle timing the beast and what i was looking at actually uh when uh uh and i broke into something that that talks about you know when a person has is dealing with severe pain in their body and how you know this this body being the beast and how you can tame you know uh uh your body in in in in that kind of a circumstance and it was it was amazing because this was actually a medical report you know that that that was you know gathered from many people that had to deal with severe pain in their body and while i was i was looking into that it became very interesting to me you know uh and and different thoughts were going through my mind how you know god has given grace to man to be able to to tame different uh animals you know and and you know and and many of those men you notice is not that they are doing that you know uh uh by the holy ghost they are not they are not doing that by the holy ghost they are just they are just uh uh learning you know how to be able to understand the animal you know and and work and work with uh with the animal and it's amazing when you when you think about that you know it kind of obstructs my mind when i was thinking about all of that the bible says you know jesus said we must preach the gospel to every creature you know he actually said we should preach the gospel to every creature then all of these thoughts is going through my mind you know uh you know how uh [Music] you know uh we we only think about you know the the human creature and don't think about you know all the creatures other animals that can also experience the love of god we have to realize that brother branham talks about conquering the board by the love of god amen he was able to witness god's god's love you know to the animal sorry that i've entered your zone you know i'm a preacher i'm going there to pray for the sake you know and and and he talks about how you know animals uh they they have an instinct that sense our fear and when the animal realized that you are you are afraid of it it gets aggressive it pulls on its defense because your sense of fear makes the animal to think that you're going to do something to it so it becomes you know very defensive but if the animal sends no fear in you it will it will it will not harm you sure praise the lord so you realize that fear came from the fall it's a sense of the fall praise the lord if real you see men that have been able to tame lions you know they go to go to the lion park and they can they can they can play with them and you know and all of that and and and i can stand on the other side and say my friend that is very dangerous amen because i'm so packed up with fiery meaning i said my friend that is very dangerous you are risking your life but to him he enjoys it praise the lord he's in he enjoys it and uh and and and different people and i mean people have different ideas of what they think about pets but uh you know just just thinking about the subject uh i realized that people that are able to to uh uh you know that are able to tame pets they have something that we that are not able don't have praise the lord because their pet is is a creature they always they always uh you know it always that scripture always baffled my mind preach the gospel to every creature you know we know that the creatures don't have to they don't have to repaint it was men that fell before they failed and stopped being aggressive to men praise the lord now where i'm going with this thought is is actually today with uh uh you know the sense of fear to deal with uh the sense of fear that uh you know uh sometimes we have that hidden within us and it would it would sometimes bring uh uh you know it will take a situation to to to make us to realize that oh my goodness uh you know it's a sense of the fault as long as we are in this body we will we will there there are things that will make us afraid you know you can come out of it a terrible dream dream being afraid oh my goodness wow thank god it was just a dream praise the lord you know is is uh is the falling nature in this body that is that is that is reacting but what the grace of god don't want you to do is for their fallen nature to control you it's for that falling sense of fear to detect to you because sometimes when people feed into fear then now they become suspicious amen they become suspicious and and when that and when that antenna goes up then oh man you start reading you start putting right into everything you see and brother branham says it destroys faith are we together they destroy faith sons of god are led by the spirit of god amen jesus said if the son of man come where he find faith so uh we want to we want to look at this a little bit here just for the few minutes that is that is before us on this uh wednesday night this prayer meeting night james speaking here and uh i mean what a what a subject you know that that he's talking talking about here and uh last week when we when we spoke about this you know you see when when the apostle paul addressed that uh let me get back a little bit here uh uh to to the saints in uh thessalonica when he when he addressed that subject uh uh about possessing your the vessel your body in sanctification there were some things that were going on you know i've always thought about uh looking into what what bring paul to the place of writing the church about the rapture let me let me compare it to our time because just like we talked about the cycle of nations i mean projected a cycle of nations on sunday talking about the cycle of revival we realized that there is nothing new under the sun now what was happening just just in a brief uh thought here what was happening there with the believers in [Music] uh thessalonica because we realized that there was one of the first place where the church started going on a persecution so the roman governor was trying to bring uh you know uh uh there were a lot of pressure coming on the church at that time and the way that they were picking these disciples up they were doing different things you know we talked a little bit about uh house churches on sunday and uh they would do they will they will they will make uh uh a sacrifice to idols and they would take they would take the blood of their sacrifice and and go down into the marketplace and and and sprinkle it on the on the vegetables or on the fruits and now the disciples knew that you know by the word of the law they were not supposed to partake of anything they were giving to idols praise the lord so pretty soon uh you know they were they would evolve those things and and by that way there will will also be identified but what was happening here is because of the pressure that was coming on the church in thessalonica these believers started seeing these things and comparing it with the scripture to start believing that maybe they missed the rapture so you see that was why paul had to write them that letter sure just like our time with everything that is going on now people you know uh uh you know everybody minds is running you know is it is this is this the persecution is this the squeeze is this the tribulation that is coming because it has always been like that right amen because when when that when that when the when the uh uh believers at that time look at you know what the promises in the scripture and see the persecution that was coming on the church they starts to realize that oh my goodness have we missed the rapture sure because the church is not supposed to go through the tribulation the tribulation is different from persecution because paul says all that there the name of christ will suffer persecution praise the lord so now the apostle paul now how to write them and and and instruct them what is going to happen that this is this is the process of the rapture this is the stages of the rapture the lord himself shall descend with a shout out he says let no mail until you let no man bother you are you grabbing the picture now now you see so that is the place where he was driving them toward and encouraging them their look you have to possess your vessel amen realizing that if you bring yourself under the talking the deaf angel will pass amen realizing that if you have the holy ghost the fear of missing the rapture the the very fear of missing the rapture must be able to tell you that uh i mean you need you need to build your relationship with the lord are you seeing where i'm going with this thought the fear of missing the rapture needs to tell you that you are holding on to the church you need to leave the church and go father and meet the lord praise the lord amen and uh uh you know in even in uh uh athlete relationship when when when when when the woman or the other partner in a relationship started start becoming insecure it means that there is problem amen it means that there is problem it means that they have they have got themselves into this relationship basing on something and they are the their love the love of that person is not solid yet so the same thing to the church if the church started becoming insecure oh my goodness this thing that is happening oh my goodness see what is happening praise the lord the more these things are happening the more the believer come to rest the more the believer come to rest we live for our eyes because we know our redemption is night we even get excited and say come lord jesus the fear of missing the rapture i say that again it means that there's a problem in the foundation of your relationship with jesus christ praise the lord it's almost like brother branham says if he's empowered like joshua he says paul how to teach the efficient church to de-wave the problem of sin the problem of seeing innocence the other that as a child of god you cannot be lost he says that's why he had to that's why he taught the ephesian church his very letter he brought them from the mind of god blessed is the lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in christ jesus he started the very letter to show you that god choose you even before we came to the earth our election is now what you did or what you would do or what you have done he elected us in his mind before the foundation of the word amen that's the very introduction that he brought to us in the book of ephesians brother branham says it was to take that fear out of the church of losing their salvation it's the same thing that takes away the fear of missing the rapture praise the lord and if you're not living right definitely you'll have the fear you cannot be living contrary to the word of god and bear faith that you were going in the rapture a contrary life do not bear faith praise the lord a person can live a contrary life a hypocritical life and and on the out wall they can they can show us like they are on fire for god they are just on a sinking sin they're just on the sinking sin praise the lord so you see paul was bringing there to the church to you know to to deal with the sense of fear that this is the other this this is what is going to take place this is the sequence of the rapture the lord himself shall descend with a shout and the voice of the archangel praise the lord amen have we heard the shout out have we received a shout out amen then we are already in the process of the rapture we are already in the rapture process because the shot has already sounded which is the gospel message of the age are we together that's the reason why the scriptures say in a moment a period of time the rapture is a period of time it's not just a one day even it's a period of time with a sequence praise the lord the same thing that happens to the believer we in the we we in a fragile body we're in a fil filling body a body that will not be redeemed your redemption is for your soul bringing you back to the place of a son of god a daughter of god not for this body but often times when we get sick then we start to question what god is doing in our life do i really have the holy ghost praise the lord if you think you don't if you think you have the holy ghost you shouldn't get sick you have the holy ghost you must never take a bath praise the lord for as much as you will need to wash this body physically this body will go through struggle physically this body will continue to fail and continue to struggle praise the lord praise the lord so that's the reason why we warn ourselves in this assembly don't apply faith to what is happening coronavirus we uh we got to go to work we children got to go to school and you got to go into the shopping mall we just keep ourself under the blood and do the things that are necessary to be done praise the lord now i knew i've gone thousand miles from where i was now so it's okay it's a it's a prayer meeting night nassau praise the lord we are just trying to uh encourage your faith tonight and then you know uh bring you to that place so we have to possess this body you know we have to possess it in every way but yet james is letting us to know you that uh uh uh you know for in many things we do uh for in many things we offend all if if any man offend not in word praise the lord the same is a perfect man that word perfect does not mean sinless that word perfect means mencho is speaking about maturity you you are finally come now to maturity where your yet is yet and your nade is named because jesus said let your year be yang and your name and brother branham also said he says the apostles were men of few words when a person comes to a mature life you choose your words you choose your words you just all your energy is just not for you to talk you talk things that are necessary you talk things that are edifying you grow to such a such a maturity word when something comes of negative you stop it right there that's what james is talking here you you are grown so much until you are so sensitive that you don't want any negative thing to affect your spirit man or or sow a seed in you for somebody you are grown to that maturity and you can you can stop yourself he says that's what we do to the hearse we hold it back praise the lord it's a mature man see he puts our maturity in the listing and then now it makes sense what brother branham said a chain is only strong at its weaker length praise the lord we can show ourselves smart we can you know uh you know and do everything and quote the word and all of that just watch the things we are talking about praise the lord stricture of things scriptural testimony the word does it pull you does it draw you or when the word starts to talk about the scripture you just start to shrink back it's almost like you want to disappear praise the lord that's where our maturity is seen in the world praise the lord amen the bible says there is no weapon form against you will prosper amen and the and the prophet isaiah went on to say not even a tongue that rise against you in judgment so you see the whole thing there is there the the holy spirit is tracing us back to the beginning that it took one word it took one lying word from the devil to ruin god's eden you don't need all the proof you just need one line to ruin your life so that's where the holy ghost has taken us back to the first weapon that was used explosive weapon was a line from a lying tongue of a lying devil praise the lord think about this the bible says ephesians chapter 1 how satan is the prince of the power of the earth we are talking about lies and thinking about the prince of the power of the air that's the reason why the media is just filled with lies everything on air is lies if you want to see it on on on air facebook youtube before you believe it you just feeling into lies the things the whole truth the angers that come about you you don't see them the guardian angels that god gave to protect you you don't see them how we together that's how to possess this vessel is to breathe our tongue train our tongue to speak the things that are edifying that are seizing with grace something that we encourage somebody praise the lord you know one of the common ones god bless you praise the lord tell somebody god bless you in the grocery they will turn around thank you they will turn around oh thank you so if we are if we're going to possess our inheritance we want spiritual gifts and we want to grow in the in the understanding of the word the wisdom of the world we want to understand the message and understand the scripture and all of that all of that is around the world praise the lord we will get to that we'll look at here a little bit where jesus did says let your year be yeah and your net ned we would talk about it we're almost out of time here tonight so i mean we're just encouraging ourselves we are the place since young people were god is bringing us up in that statue of a perfect man amen god is bringing his church because we're slowly coming to death we are slowly coming to death you know if we if we don't possess our vessel if uh if we should have any more pressure then coronavirus that will come on us we will blow up amen if we don't bring this vessel subject to the word and fall in love with christ amen if we get any more pressure than coronavirus which of course there are more to come you see well but if we are in the world and we have we are thinking about the promises of god of what god has promised us all of these things will rejoice our heart for you to for you to i mean to be the generation that will see these things amen you see scripture fulfilling praise the lord is not because we are not we we we are not experiencing a physical darkness but you can see the spiritual darkness so you are you are right back into gushing in the land of egypt there is spiritual darkness on the word praise the lord you are right back into bible days it's a time of an exeter [Music] we have a message we have a messenger that is taking us to our inheritance praise the lord see the gross darkness that is upon us you see the children of ezra i mean what a privilege you know how how how did they express their gratefulness they have heard about jehovah they have heard about the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob they have heard they have stories about you know uh uh abraham uh uh proving his love to god and brain and god stopping his hands they have out of those account but now they were experiencing the god of abraham isaac and jacob right in their camp and
