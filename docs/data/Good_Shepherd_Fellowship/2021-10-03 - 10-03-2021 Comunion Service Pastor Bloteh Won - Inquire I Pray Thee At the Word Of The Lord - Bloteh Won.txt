chronicles chapter 18 ii chronicles chapter 18. but jordan i will use the second portion of my uh notes this morning under the paganos church age so we will go back to dad again and i would like to use that tonight praise the lord second chronicles chapter 18 let's read from verse 4. maybe verse 3 will be able to grab our mind and we will remember the context here we are reading on in ahab king of israel said unto jerusha king of judah will that go with me to raymond gillard and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thou people and we will be with thee in the war and jerusalem said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today think about that inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets 400 men and said unto them shall we go to roman gila to battle or shall i forbid and they said go up for god will deliver it into the king's hand but joseph said is there not yet a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him now remember the question he asked in verse 4 inquired i prayed thee at the word of the lord today but then he's saying is there not a prophet we have to know the word of the lord today for this day but to know the word of the lord is there not a prophet let's pray heavenly father almighty god we just want to thank you lord that we can come together this evening lord to bring evening sacrifices unto you the first son that who god fathered of this month lord jesus the 10th month of the year oh god you have been so good to us you have been so gracious lord jesus father here we are lord god and we have just read your sacred word only you can break the word father we pray come now lord break your word father to our hearts to god fear us tonight lord jesus may something be said of internal value that will draw us closer to you bless the word of father those on their way coming lord we ask that you bring them safely father those that wouldn't that are not able to be with us tonight lord we pray oh god that you will keep them in your presence lord keep their hearts lord and their mind closer to you oh father and help them lord we just love you tonight we appreciate you what an awesome god you are what a wonderful father to you be the praise to you be the glory and honor in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen as this is what i was actually thinking on speaking this morning inquiring inquired i pray thee are the word of the lord today praise the lord inquired i pray thee at the word of the lord today so the few meanings that is left before us said the lord will help us uh uh we we want to take their little thought tonight uh and maybe by the grace of god we will we will continue sometime long but just let's just take a little talk here and uh when you go back in and begin to read from the beginning of the reign of uh the jehoshapha you appreciate there was something that that he did you have to remember just like we said a little bit about solomon how god blessed solomon with wisdom solomon uh time was called the golden age because they didn't that they never fought a war but you would realize that solomon in his reign he was blessed naturally praise the lord his gift brought a natural blessing to the people but in jehoshaphat time a judah was blessed spiritually praise the lord we know we know the things that happened to solomon and uh and and all of that but i i i'm trying to say this so i can be able to uh uh uh help us see something tonight that i just want for us to go over and and and and the reason why joshua was blessed greatly spiritually in his dream it was because there was something that he did there was something that he made principle in the time of his ruling there was something that he made principle in the time of his ruling and that's what i want for us to look at let's go back a chapter and that will be in chapter 17. let's go back in chapter 17 and and we will be able to take a principle here you have to remember this honor joshua he was the one that says believe the lord you know you shall be established believe his prophets and you will prosper and uh you know and and all of that but let's look at something here that uh uh we trust that the holy spirit will be able to help us here and as we look at this together uh uh ii chronicle chapter 17 and job shepherd his son reign in his faith and strengthen himself against israel and he placed forces in all the faint city of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the city of ephraim which also his father have taken and the lord was with jerusha because he walked in the first ways of his father david it's strange that the holy spirit will help us to realize that there was a way that david walked before the lord that was called his first ways praise the lord we know that after david started gaining territories he started winning walls and different things he became relaxed and there were his problem came with del shiver but before then david had a walk before god that is referred to here in the scripture as his first ways praise the lord and it was honored that he was called a man after god's own heart so joshua for a year he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought net on to belem but sought to the lord god his father and walk in his commandment and not after the doing of israel therefore the lord established the kingdom in his hands and all judah brought to joseph her presence and he and he had riches and honor in abundance and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord that does not mean proud his heart being lifted up that's that does not take the sense of pride which means uh i mean he he had the zero of the lord he you know his heart was encouraged he had the encouragement to do the things of the lord moreover he took away the high places and the grove out of judah also in the third year of his reign his son told his princes even unto bear health and to obedience to zechariahs and and to nata hill and uh michelle to teach in the cities of judah now see what what is going to attract god to this man he's going to send this man to all the provinces and actually what they're going to do is that they're going to start a bible study he's going to send them to go and start teaching the people in the laws of god in the word of god praise the lord he sent to the princes and and and all of these men that the scripture called you and with them he sent levites and chimel and now to heal and you know all of these names down here let's get down to verse nine and they taught in judah and had the book of the of the lord the book of the lord of the lord in them and went about throughout all the cities in judah and taught the people praise the lord amen he called these men and called the sons of the levites and says let's go down to the princess let's i mean the province and and you know and all the the all of our territory and let's instruct the people in the word of god praise the lord and the fear of the law fell upon all the kingdom of the land that were round about judah saw that they made no war against joe shepherd now this was the same thing that happened in the time of solomon they never made war with solomon but it was not because of what solomon did it was because of what david did praise the lord it was because of what david that's the reason why all the nations that was around israel at a time when solomon came to power i mean i mean he he he just had peace with all the nations praise the lord amen but here we are seeing that when jerusha came he started to establish the word of the lord in the hearts of the people and that's what solomon said when a man is at peace with the lord amen if a man waves pleases the lord he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him praise the lord that one god what jerusalem in a way that he instructed the people a broad peace even to the nations around the tempting net to go and fight against joshua to fight against judah praise the lord amen so there they had they have made no wars against jerusha also some of the philistines brought jerusalem for presence and tributes and silver and all of that he just speak of the peace that was ruling at that time and the way that he was able to achieve this is now by setting up great things and putting down it if you come i will blow your head off the way he was able to achieve peace with his neighbor was turning his heart in the heart of his household to the lord praise the lord establishing the word of god in his home he have he had a principle of family altar that in every home the word of the law must be read and it brought the fear of the lord on the hearts of the people that's how he was able to rule his house and rule his land in peace because he established the word of the lord praise the lord amen now so we got a little background here of this man of this king that was very conscious of the word of the lord so you see why when when he joined himself onto ahab and they have asked him for them to go down and take reimagine he asked ahab that question let us inquire of the word of the lord for today praise the lord amen and i believe that as as children of god and us as people of god that have had an understanding of what god is doing in our day people that knows that we are in the laodicea church age and there in the book of revelation the bible says unto the angel of the loud jesus church age which is the messenger of the laodicea church age if you believe that you are in the laodicea church a then there should be a messenger for this age praise the lord amen out of these people struggling with brother branham they better find their messenger or s they have to tell us which age we are living in praise the lord so we realize here that uh gerald sheriff is now saying to uh uh this this king here i don't mind your people are my people we are ready to go to war with you but he said let's inquire i prayed in at the word of the lord today now it's so easy for you to think or understand that well today let's let's let's set the word or let's look at the word and you and and that was the kind of a mind that ahab had so for ahab it's easy is that why you won i bring all my guys 400 men you'll come together here come praise the lord and you want a word from the lord come gentlemen you come there are 400. should we go on that go on king is that okay no because he knows that the word of the law don't come stole 400 men the word of the lord is now popular opinion praise the lord and i'm saying there to say that there are many times word things that sound reasonable we take it to be the word of the lord it might be reasonable but it's not the word of the lord praise the lord it might not be harmful but yet it is not the word of the lord are we together praise the lord and you'll find people doing that and you you find them uh you know somebody put something on facebook say amen you just go amen praise the lord because you want to show that you you are you are a christian you can say amen you just go amen and what they are saying it might sound reasonable but it is it could not be the word of the lord are we to are we together now so he brought all of these uh 400 men and said shall we gold and what do you expect he's the one housing them he's the one feeding them he's the one doing everything for them what do you expect praise the lord god king the lord be with you and sometimes i should think our our generation struggle on that especially the young people the struggle with that because if it is not a popular opinion i don't know if it is right and because everybody's doing it okay i can jump inside and do it too because everybody's doing it i went down there i saw everybody doing this so i can jump also inside and do it praise the lord i pray thee let's inquire from the word of the lord today the word of the lord in our time we would says let inquire from the word of the lord for the hour the word of the lord for the age and the scripture prove it right here because joshua said no is there not a prophet because the word of the lord comes to a prophet praise the lord he said is there not a prophet beside that we might inquire of him or they can't say yeah there is one crazy guy there he's he's a little croc-headed praise the lord because he's he he he's always different praise the lord he's always different he never said nothing good about me praise the lord that's the kind of a church member that like praises like the pastor to just praise him all the time glory be to god and we know the story that went to uh fascia nikaya the prophet and when he came he told him praise the lord the scripture says he said unto them go and the and the way he said it ahab knew that no his goal is not like the goal that those 400 people said praise the lord he said didn't i tell you he never said anything good about me that's the age that's the time that we are living in i would say just like joe shepherd to you church let's learn to inquire of the word for our day let's learn to inquire of the word of the lord amen let's learn to say what what did the scripture say what the scriptures say concerning this because there was a word of the lord concerning that there was a word of the law that was already spoken by the prophet elijah that says the dogs will lake aha blood amen there was a word of the lord that was in the land there was a prophet that was in the land if we would take the habit to inquire that word means to seek to search make a search let me search out and say what the scripture says because i just what jesus said search the scripture for in them you will have eternal life praise the lord let's just read this thought here in in the cameras church age i let it out this morning and if the church way back if the church way back there in that third age have only hail untold the revelation of the living word in the ames praise the lord they could not have head onto it until they have got the revelation that the living word was in the amaze for you to take a stand for the word it has to be revealed to you that yeah this is true this is what god's required if they were only head on toe the revelation of the living word in their midst you realize that i keep making emphasis on it because the word that is in our midst is a person it's christ jesus and we must have a revelation that he is in our midst the service is not glorious because the music is great the service is not glorious because we sunk and dance the service is glorious because the word is in our minds amen the service is glorious because the world is open to us if they would have got the revelation of the living word in their midst praise the lord don't miss that church don't miss that let's inquire of the word not because it makes sense all they say it you know it makes sense and and uh go to the word of god and see what the word says praise the lord i was conversing with my wife last night and and we were talking in the same line of taught in and and i i shared something to her and i said if you think about this think about this the scripture says if you love your brother that love you is it not easy to do amen it's easy to do now so the thought of challenging the love of god is to love somebody you know is to love the sinners praise the lord but look at this thought look at this and you will you kind of appreciate a little bit here we together it's over in the book of uh hebrews amen uh i was not thinking about it here so uh it should be uh are we together praise the lord now paul says something here over in the book of hebrew and uh [Music] that's in hebrew chapter 11 uh no no no don't go there don't go there let's stay to where we are praise the lord yeah he's talking about brotherly love continue and be not forgetful to entertain strangers whereabouts somehow entertain angels on the way and he keeps talking about that but there is there is there is a place he comes down here too and uh and actually what he's what he's addressing here is he's he's he's encouraging the saints and says you know let brother love continue love everybody but he comes to a place where he makes it particular he says especially them of the house of faith are we together amen now so he uh uh uh he's driving this concept of uh uh you know uh loving and taking care of the people but he's also bringing in a concept where he wants you to realize that uh you know you also have to remember to be kind to god's people to be kind to the saints to hold them in in a place that is special to realize that these are sons and daughters of god are we together amen that our our kindness to them is not it's not it's not like an obligation order or you know other service that we're doing to them we must realize that jesus said the least that you have done unto my little ones you have done it also unto me are you grabbing the concept now are you seeing what i'm going with this amen even though in my looks like well yeah i mean we are in the fade you do me good i do you gold now if you only take it in that light then jesus said you are just like the the publicans because that's what seen us we do okay i think i got you in the wrong chapter that's why that's gallatin chapter 6 verse 10. i got you in the wrong place i was trying to bring out a verse that is not there in verse 9 he says and let us not be wary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we think not so let's not be wary discouraged in doing good or helping people now this goes across the ball don't be wary to give give someone a hand and help them out but then he also lena he says as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially now so that especially bring us to the place where we put god's people in a special class because we realize that these are the royal seed these are the promised people these are the people who's doing good jesus said even a cup of water given to them will not go on repay so you see you see what i'm coming from amen so if we are inquiring off if we are inquiring all the word of the lord and we are we we are judging our actions then we realize here that yet in the scripture it says especially to them who are of the household of faith if you have opportunity let us be good to all men but then we also have to realize that there are people that are holding this earth together they are people that are representing the blood of jesus christ are you grabbing the concept of where i'm going so jerusha said let's inquire of the word of the lord today is there not a prophet in the land and surely there was one when mikhail come he gave him definitely what the word of the lord is i saw ezra scatter like sheeps without shepherd praise the lord that even god had to reveal to me kyle the night before that all of those prophets were honored a wrong influence they were on a wrong influence of a lying spirit and he was not afraid to tell them the vision i saw the spirit coming before the lord and the law is saying who will go down and deceive aha because the word of elijah must come to pass praise the lord so all of these things are happening in the spiritual reign ahab now getting desire he thinks that in his heart now he's he's trying to do uh give israel the land thinking that he can appease god the god that we serve is not a god to a peace it's a god to obey we must obey god's word it's not do wrong and then you know do penance to appease god so he can be sorrowful no no you cannot appease god god must be obey he must be reverent he must be feared so if the church way back there in that age her only head told the revelation of the living word in the amaze the power of god would not have failed as it did in the dark age and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of god and the wonderful acts of god will be in her midst again praise the lord what will bring the acts of god when the church gets back to the world when the people start taking the word just like joseph day he established the teaching of the word in all the cities called these levites go down and let's teach these people the word let's bring the heart that bring the fear of the law back to the heart of the people and the way it comes is in the instruction of the word and and those simple things those simple things it's not the duels or done this word has the power to transform our life when you wake up and you read the scripture and read one chapter read one verse over your family and the next morning you read you get in the habit of a a family altar and lifting the world up it's not you trying to be a preacher when you are not don't start saying things and connecting it's all of those connection that can burn houses down if you are not on here look for an electrician to do the work and stop connecting just read just read the word just read the word and that word will start having influence and the word will start having influence you will know that it starts catching the hearts of the young one when you stop doing it and it says why are we not reading the bible these days [Laughter] then you know that that word it's only a heart he got favor with the lord and god peace with all his enemies around him because he established the word of the lord in his house he was not looking through the window and said the philistine girls there they are just uh uh uh jesse bell said and and and and the boy said uh did you get tattoo on there but no no no he was establishing his house in the world establishing his home in the world this is our portion leave them with their portion focus on your portion if the church today will return back to the word return back to the word let's not argue let not paraphrase but the bible say the bible say even the bible says help yourself and god will help you then you say amen where did the bible say that where did the bible say that can you help yourself so sometimes those things that sound reasonable you just hear it it sounds so reasonable oh yeah that's true no inquired of the word even though it sounds reasonable let me see what the scripture says praise the lord that's what our problem is people come says brother branham says that's not and said brother brown say our ears stretch up but are we inquiring are we going back to search praise the lord amen because if that thing is not a spoken word if that thing is not a spoken word it's going to hang in your reasoning to allow you to compromise because a preacher now has given you a window to pass through the preacher said brother branham said you now have a window of escape because it's not a spoken word it will not transform you back to the word it will just create problems for you let's inquire of the word for our day let's inquire for the word of our day the lord bless you musicians you can come and right today when the church will return to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of the of of god and his wonderful arts the wonderful eyes of god will be in the mess again praise the lord amen amen through the blood through the blood we have come into his presence let's sing that chorus through the love [Music] into his presence [Music] just blood we can come into god's presence through his blood into his presence through the blood yet [Music] has made our way and we can come into god's presence [Music] [Applause] yes truth through the blood [Music] into his presence through the blood jesus blood [Music] into god's

presence true all now with the music hallelujah jesus yes he's into his presence blood yes excuse me an entrance thank you jesus into god's presence to what a musicians play let's put our hearts
