voicing like you were doing this morning worshiping the Lord you have a man a have a person like me coming with uh with my own attitude quiet and cold and so many things going through my mind I'm saying Lord why should I be the one to preach this morning I'm just going to ruin that atmosphere for the people but I pray that the Lord will come behind they praise the Lord the Lord will be merciful to me and he will and that your atmosphere will not be wrong praise the Lord amen well we thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to come in the house of the Lord and again we want to be grateful for the services last weekend praise the Lord you enjoyed those meetings like Give the Lord a hand of praise the Lord it was a blessing having brother brother Crosby with us and uh and and I don't I don't need to tell you now you know he's a different character amen it's a very different character praise the Lord amen uh he was preaching one time back home and you're having some meetings the first time I saw him was that brother dearly Sons wedding so uh they asked me if I want to if I want to be the one to come in and the sister that baked the cake didn't wanted to talk about the cake so they asked me if I should be the one to talk about the cake I said what do I know about cake you know so the pastor says I want for all the ministers to do something so I went and called the sister and I'm asking her she said this color you know represent this in this color represent this and now mind you I'm dealing with my jacket I'm having headache as such a headache on my on my head I'm supposed to preach the next morning and uh I'm listening to her and it's just it's just everything just going over my head nothing is staying and when I sat down I call the pastor I says can you please find somebody else to do this so they called brother Crosby he was the one and he took it in a completely different dimension he he was so easy as if to say he baked the cake I'm saying damn lawyer I said oh wow wow I think that's the man for the job I'm not a guy for the job you know so then uh I have to drive with another brother and another brother was coming to pick me up so we had to meet at brother Crosby house so we got there and we Fellowship that was the first time I got to meet him and then uh he asked brother Deli to come and do some meetings for him so brother Daley wanted for us to visit together because uh we were we were having our trip to Liberia so he asked me better one if you want me to go to Liberia with you will you also be willing to preach along with me in the UK so I say well I want you to go to Liberia so uh then I will be able to make your way we meet in the UK so but I really enjoy those meetings amen I really enjoyed those meetings it was good to sit there and be Christian but moreover to see uh you know administrator would come in and just labor with the people praise the Lord live up with the people meet us just where we are and uh we were we took a request for our brother Church our sister and back in in Kenya but then uh it was it was also in line with what brother Crosby was preaching you know dealing with uh a backslider in a state of cancer because Lord Branham says a council said it's a backsliding sale sell the house that has backslides so so uh that's that's where he was taking that uh that approach from to be able to show when the person goes away from the Lord they are dealing with spiritual cancer but I also believe that there is net I'm going to read a quote to you now there is not a cancer that is small dangerous as you know spiritually you know just like backslading is a cancer you know in the house of the Lord there is not a cancer that is more dangerous than uh than uh uh then gossip praise the Lord gossip and murmuring in the body is more dangerous it's a daily cancer it kills family yes yes it kills Church even destroy you as an individual praise the Lord Amen brother Branham says yeah God's provide a way for healing he says that's what happened in the church when they get someone failing to cooperate with the church a person just being their own amen praise the Lord they are just their own there is nothing that is done in the church that is right you know everything they are the only person that is right they don't love the music they don't love the preaching you don't even like that other brother the way he likes smiling the other sister she thinks she's the only one that is spiritual that's a more dangerous cancer someone failing and pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church is a devil in that person that's right and that causes the whole church to be sick over it because the the they bring their atmosphere their own satisfied atmosphere into the body and then pretty soon it's it just starts spreading all over amen you will see that I was kind of laboring on these things last night you see it in the scripture where the Bible says provoke one another to God in love pray for one another love one another there is nowhere where it says talk about one another [Music] come on come on praise the Lord because that is something that we must not do right and that is something that we always do we always do praise the Lord but you see this is it's just the reverse of our responsibility amen that you in the position of of talking about people in a negative way you can never pray for them that's right so people will talk talk to us but I'm just praying for them no you are not praying for them if you are really burning for someone you are praying for them you always your thoughts is always revolving to be positive because you are hoping for the best praise the Lord so it was good that our brother was was dealing with that and showing us all the different uh um uh the effect that uh a cancer cells we have on uh on the physical body of of an animal how much more about each and every one of us may God give us Grace praise the Lord may God give each and every one of us Grace to be able to to rightly behave ourselves in the house of the Lord amen and and he started talking about uh the you know the the shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and the restoration of our souls I will I want to go in that direction this morning but before then I will I would like to say so after after the the service if appearance of little little children can stay and then also sisters if you are interested you can stay I will be going into the spring season soon and we have got away from the children's Chapel for a while so we want to address that after after service so if parents of little ones want to stay or if if it works for you to stay and also sisters that are that are also interested if you can stay after the service you know just just for the very very short meeting to tell you what we want to do and how much we need your help and so and then what I want us to look at and deal with this morning by the help of the Lord is to realize the other uh uh Bert Crosby was talking about the restoration of our souls okay the restoration of our souls how is our souls that are being restored now we we have shared this over and over we we we have got so used to the identity of uh of this body that we have but you see a lot of work that Grace is doing in our life is dealing with our soul amen is dealing with our soul that is a lot of work that Grace is doing now because the soul is the powerhouse the soul is the ancient room it controls the body the soul is the nature of the spirit it controls the body so if the soul is back in line there are a lot of things that we deal with in our body until the Redemption of our body we will continue to deal with it but when the sword is lined up with the word then it brings the body in suggestion to the word praise the Lord now that is the part of redemption that we have to do his part of redemption is to restore our soul back by the word our part of redemption is to identify that and bring this body on the suggestion praise the Lord so we we we want to pray that and trust that this morning I want to talk on on something a quote that I got out of the message uh uh reproach for the word but I want to speak on uh in that same sense the reproach of the word the reproach of the word that's that's what I want to talk on this uh this uh this morning by the help of the Lord but we there are few places we're going to go so let's stand on our feet and uh and go quick link uh Psalm chapter 80. Psalm chapter 18. oh okay sorry Psalm chapter 89. Psalm chapter 89 I was looking for verse 50 but Psalm 80 don't have verse 15. so Psalm 89 Psalm 89 verse 50. Psalm 89 verse 50. the psalm reads remember Lord the reproach of thy seven how I do bad in my bosom their reproach of all the mighty people where will the enemy have reproached oh Lord where will they have reproached the footsteps of dying anointed blessed be the Lord forevermore amen and amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the Lord bless you you may have your seat David over and over he spoke uh in uh in the psalm in this light uh Psalm chapter 69 he says verse 19 thou thou have no my reproach and my shame and my dishonor and uh Psalm chapter 69 verse 7 he said because for thy sake that was one of the the verses there on reproach that caught my attention because for that sake I have borne reproach shame has covered my face praise the Lord amen so we want to we want to talk about the reproach of the world we the reproach of the word and as as we as we start the The Talk this morning I want us to realize that uh uh if you are a c if you are a son or a daughter of God everything uh that concerning the coming foot of your life and all the things that we will go through if we would just realize that uh uh is for his sake praise the Lord amen just like the Bible says that there is not one thought of this word the word do not go out and return back vow it will accomplish and that is the same thing with every child of God because your life is coming directly from God's internal thoughts praise the Lord it just have to pass the way of our our parents our ancestors and in uh genetics and all of that but that seed in your heart is right from God's internal thought and it can never fail and if God's word can never fail you can never feel right amen amen amen you can never feel you can never feel does not means that you would not make mistakes you will make mistakes because you are carrying a word that cannot fail right but the carrier can feel amen the word cannot perish but you may perish you may pass away amen but that word will not pass away and because the word cannot fail it won't pass away thy very world will come and resurrect your body again to live on antenna praise the Lord so that is the thought that I want for us to start with this morning that you are God's internal talks and God's internal talk can fail there is a principle that we will see it in the book of Acts Stephen brought that a very beautifully that uh many times in a way that God deal with us we don't grab it the first time we have to come around the block that's the reason why he's a god of Second Chances because we don't grab it the first time many times we think we grab it we think we understand it we think we know it praise the Lord and many of the times that level of understanding and we we we attribute it so much to ourself when it's not about you that's right it's not about me it's about him so he has to bring us around the block then we realize oh wow it's about him so those are some of the few things that we will be looking at uh we'll be looking at this warning as we as we trust the Lord here and uh so let's just start off here the reproach for the cause of the word but random status to say I just want to use that to build uh a foundation there is something that I needed to share also and just give me one minute here I was going to take a portion of this and share with you but uh is something I was standing in I came across that are we together okay sorry sister fader I've just seen you uh two additional notes okay so let's start here with the reproach of the word and then uh he starts off and said God has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill his word God knows just exactly what he's going to do we done he knows what he's going to do but we don't we just have to receive it as he gave it to us praise the Lord amen he has planned to do is is all has to come about there has to be sometimes rugged in high things to only bring out the real truth nature of the object praise the Lord so God he knows exactly what he's doing we don't know praise the Lord and because here he said we came right into whatever time that we were born and uh if we want to take it in the dispensation since we came right into loudish but there has been ages before audition amen and then uh but he brings us right there we find ourselves we see all of these things happening and then uh but yet God will Design some rough and high things only to be able to bring out the real thing the truth nature of the object you know rain is born from a rugged lightning storm thunder skies and if we don't have rain we wouldn't live but you see what it takes to bring rain turn the lightning flashing anger out and out of there comes rain a seed Must Die rot corrupt smell and go back to the dust of the Earth in order to bring forth New Life but there is an intelligence that carried the sea through that process praise the Lord there is an intelligence that have ordained the path of life for the seed if a seed we bring for life it must go through that path praise the Lord I would think they are the uh as as a human and seeing a pretty seed I don't think the sea will make the choice to be able to go through all of their stages if you left with the seed it should just stay pretty just as it is but if it's you break be able to break for Life the one that have ordained it to live ordained that path for the seed praise the Lord it takes the pounding of gold turning over and over back and forth and pounding until all the drugs is taken out of it now because it's shining cause uh what is known as full gold shine like real gold but you put the two together you will see them out to one side and God set a time and he has a purpose for everything he does there is nothing happening just accidentally to those who love the Lord and I called I call him to his calling see we are predestinated and everything worked just right for that because he cannot lie so even the things and times that we don't like in our life is just working right on God's clock praise the lord we don't like it it's not the best time of our life but to God that's just the way he wanted to be are we together you have to know it's all about him it's all about him and less about us and he said that was so in everything has its Time season and it has its way and God is behind every move every move every move even the move of the devil God is behind it because the devil needs his permission to move God is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put Upon Us trials in in wondering is testing to see how we will react to an action now this is where it gets interesting now I remember that the reproach of the word the word has always bold a reproach it is not your reproach it is his reproach amen Paul understood it when he said I'm partaking of his suffering praise the Lord amen we must know that he took the the greater shear and we have the lessorship praise the Lord you read Deuteronomy you will realize that uh I would just I would just uh uh uh studying there determine chapter 25 uh you will you you realize that the Bible says that uh uh uh a man should take for this tribe let's read that foreign it was not part of my nose so my mind is going in and out of thoughts here that's chapter 25 verse 23 . 25 3 sorry 25 3. 40 stripes and it shall be verse 2. if the if the weekend man be wanted to be beating then the Jewish shall cause him to to lay down and to be beaten before his face I call him to his fault by a setting number 40 Stripes he may give him and not a seed at least if he issue a seed and beat him above this with many stripes then thy brother should sing vow unto thee fought his tribe Moses said that said that as an as an instruction as an ordinance to the people but uh uh uh yeah this this is just completely different but it's fine but you will realize that you realize think about this Isaiah said by his stripes we are healed amen if a man I've done wrong he must take 40 strives and answer your place on the prophecy he place our healing on Jesus's stripes what is beautiful there is that I'm completely the way that was another thing I will talk about but when we get there you will see and you will realize that medical science they have put all the diseases in the world on the 40 groups all all the diseases in the world not 40 diseases but all the diseases are under 40 groups so whatever disease a person has it can be placed on a one group or another now Jesus in the heart of palate he will be whipped and I calling to this law he must not be raped more than 40 stripes praise the Lord amen and how many stripes did they whip him oh no 39 they gave him 39 stripes and kept one so no whatever you are dealing with is just one he took 39. [Music] whatever you are dealing with it's just one so he took the greater portion he took the greatest portion that the word of the Lord will not be broken give him 39 stripes and head back one are we together so by his tribes we are healed amen you believe that this morning in stripes we are here so the word has always bowled a reproach All Through the Ages this is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the world was God so you see God made man to be an agent that would carry the word that's what man was made to be an agent because you see the reproach of the word in every ages it really never seems like it was the word it seems like it was God people that were reproach but why were they reproached because they were the carrier of the word so we are made to be the agent to carry the word the word must have a vehicle that's what the prophet of God will say is that he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but our feet praise the Lord the word must have a body that was God's desire for making man it was to express himself from thought form to a body form the higher form of expression is to be made flesh that's God's highest form of expression God can deal with you through dreams he can deal with you through different gifts but the highest form that he can express himself is to make his Word Flesh in you that's God's highest form of expression that's the reason why you can understand all the Mysteries but when you have not come to birth where your body is subject to the word you can just speak those things and live different yes yes you have not hit the climax yet right because that's the highest form of expression is for God's word to be made flesh in you and amen praise the Lord so All Through the Ages God's anointed word has always been reproached praise the Lord God has no other word has always been reproached when Abraham was laugh out oh father of nation where is the children was it Abraham no it was God that gave him a promise so it was God's word that was being reprenched praise the Lord well they can see God they see Abraham he was the one that said God spoke to him so it was Abraham that they were laughing at but it was the word of God for that age when the children of Israel in in Egypt they were taking the waves and their burden were increased it was the word of God when God told Abraham your sins are so John in a Strange Land and I will come down with a mighty hand that was that word that was being reproached amen praise the Lord amen so you see and those people they never if if they could have make a choice and say God promised Abraham I don't want to be there I want to be something different praise the Lord they never made that choice God choose them that they will be the one that will bear the reproach of Thy word they have to be a people in Egypt they have to be a pharaoh that their man know Joseph they are burning hard to be increased for Thy word to be reproached pain praise the Lord amen you know why our trials are so tough for us is because we make it our trials if it's your trial it will become so tough for you if it is his reproach he said my burden a light if it is his reproach if you can identify it and place yourself under that it will become lighter because you know it's his reproach you know it's his word that is at stake but most of the time we put our personality at stake reason why it becomes tough because that's where the rubber meets the road God's anointed word has always been reproached listen to this now it gets so beautiful and sweet and that's the reason is so hard for people who doesn't understand he says that's the reason it's so hard for people so you see what is happening here is that through the preaching of the word God is breaking us to this place of understanding that's all he wants to bring to us amen it's not to change your trials but to understand why you are going through it praise the Lord amen the Bible says Luke chapter 24 when Jesus appeared to this man the Bible says their eyes were open and they understood that's what happened with the new birth the new birth bring us to an understanding we see things different amen we always bring it back to God's word and that is the reason it's so hard for people who don't understand who know how to accept that reproach he says it's so hard for people who don't understand to know how to accept the reproach of the word that's what you know they would say so I mean all of these things were not happening to me when I was a Christian it's so hard for them to understand how can I be saving God and be going through all of this are we together Jesus says I mean Broadband says here he's speaking of Jesus can you in can you remember the disciples returning back and rejoicing because they figure that they were counter wanted to stand their reproach amen amen they came back rejoicing because there was there were they were awarded to stand the reproach he says all that live Galilean in Christ shall be it a persecution a reproach of the word praise the Lord you always have to stand this reproach in others to give a testing every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained and that's why we go through the different things that we go through it's our child training to be able to understand that we are bearing a reproach for his namesake amen every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet that's the part that is difficult that is the part that is very difficult to keep quiet stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that is the path that the human nature cannot bear to just stand still it is either we talk too fast praise the lord we run ahead of ourselves and and uh the thing about it yet is that uh whether you talk too fast you run ahead of yourself it don't bother God because to him it's all part of his program praise the Lord he's going to use that and bring you around the block the second time it don't bother him he's not saying oh man you were just supposed to be patient man he miss it no no God is not like that praise the Lord it is not like that mm-hmm remember if he has called you for this that's where we want to Center on here then we get into our message now if he has called you for this for what to be a son of God to be a daughter of God if he had called you to be a bride if he have called you for this if you're in that Court just just bear with us a little bit you will soon leave but if you were called for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening right look at the teeth on the cross amen he was ordained to be safe nothing could stop it in the last minute that sea was quicking praise the Lord [Music] but you know what happened to him was that he lived a big part of his life in regret in stealing and whipping praising and all of that so a big portion of his life he lived he lived on a privilege but because he was ordained of God in the last minute nothing could stop it amen nothing could stop it and nothing will stop the word for coming to pass in your life praise the Lord nothing will stop the word nothing will stop the world from coming to pass in your life God we have to use everything to drag Us by the feet he will do it but nothing will stop the world from coming to pass in your life you didn't choose him he choose us there is not enough devil in Thomas but what God's will word will be May manifest so there is no devil in hell no matter what he trusts upon us what confusion that happened nothing is going to stop it all God is doing allowing those things to break us away from our uh that the mixture just the mixture that make me this the mixture that make me this just the mixture that make me dead praise the Lord it's not in no enough devil in Thomas but what God will be May manifest you are born for a purpose and nobody nobody can take your place nobody can play out that road praise the Lord you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place praise the Lord amen nobody can take your place that is that is uh that is one of the place we want to underline as we as we will look into what we want to to study today to realize that we are all unique amen I was I was studying yesterday and then I I I saw brother Branham uh [Music] I saw brother Branham identifying himself uh praise the Lord he identified himself on the one of the full temperament they are full temperament that every one of us in this building every human is is on the one of their temperament and and uh I saw a brother Branham uh identified himself brother Branham says I'm off a Melancholy nature he says I'm born that way so then I went back and started looking into the full uh uh temperament and it just it just it just blew another page for me I got so distracted I guess got so consuming it praise the Lord and and we will look at that a little bit let's continue to go here as we try to close uh um this quote he says you are born for the purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but you will never but they will never take your place amen why why would they never take your place God's world word will Triumph amen it cannot fail so it's not about you it's about the word you were not predestinated it was the word that was predestinated God predestinated a word to have sons and daughters in this age [Music] praise the Lord and that word I shall see was hanging and it dropped God by choosing dropped that word into your soul praise the Lord there are millions with their religious zeal that if they could have the right word they could do better than we but God by his choosing and his Mercy he placed Thy Word in you so nobody can take your place nobody God's word would Triumph it can never fail there is where every Christian ought to stand if we can just place our faith we can place our attitude on this that God's word concerning my life will never fail praise the Lord so as we look at that and then we can we can we can look at different things and uh realizing that it is it is all about the word I want us to take a thought a little bit on reflections because it takes two different objects to reflect and and and and when I was looking at it is the other we we we we misunderstand we take we take uh uh uh uh resemblance for reflection resemblance are two things that looks alike amen reflection is two things that one reflects the other and what God did in the beginning when he made Man In His Image it was not a resemblance he made man to reflect him praise the Lord now in reflecting in in reflection always one one object has to be lesser let me say it that way amen to create an image a shadow on the wall there has to be a mixture of light and darkness so you will realize here that Darkness will be a lesser object and the coming in of that light that is the greater object will cause the reflection so you see God can reflect his love that's the reason why he met us in His image and put us on free moral agents saying because he had all of these attributes in him that he will not be able to reflect if you have made a resemblance of himself right right so for us to be able to reflect his love his Mercy his grace he had support us in a place where we become a little lesser than him so we became lesser than him when men fail right and now with that condition he can reflect reflect flesh his Mercy he can reflect healing praise the Lord because we fail we can get sick and he reflects healing we get wealth they say oh God is good praise the Lord Jesus said that man will see your good work and glorify you praise the Lord oh yeah that's why we want all the time man should see the good work embrace me nor they might see the good work and Glory father father they don't see the fathom but when his love is reflected on us when they see it they realize I know it can be you there have to be something greater than you and that thing is the father [Music] praise the Lord the moon and the sun the sun is a greater light the Moon is a lesser light praise the Lord it's not a resemblance God has caught us to resemble one another praise the Lord where we want everybody to wear the black trouser white shirt black tie every other sisters must be in black dresses so everybody can know that we are all a lot of their sins hmm praise the Lord is taking a uniform and people think that's what makes us one no praise the Lord and you and you will see it and understand that most especially in family life sometimes we strive for the children to resemble us instead of reflecting the character of the home we want to bring them to resemblance no it does not work like that praise the Lord our resemblance of the father is a reflection of him when we reflect the fact the character of the father then they say you look just like your father it's not wearing the same haircut praise the Lord are we together and a big part of that is is like I said it's in family life it's in marriage life praise the Lord if God will give you somebody just like yourself you will hate yourself you will hate yourself praise the Lord and and I don't know what about you but that's what I learned about myself most of the things that I I don't like about my children is things that I know I don't like about myself if you look at it good you get mad just think about your own ways if you are sincere you will say God Jesus Christ my goodness you really did some work on me [Music] because God works with reflection that his way of resemblance praise the Lord God is a spirit he took a body and reflect his fullness and Jesus can say I am the father are one if you see me and you have seen the father it was by reflection God reflecting all of his love his fullness in that body praise the Lord so you see it and and and and and that is the way it works in family life and uh uh uh uh the the man reflecting the woman the woman reflecting the man is not resemblance most of the time we struggle to make this person just like me I don't know why they don't understand things like me no the moment we start learning to appreciate one another the way they are and knowing that God make them their way for his purpose praise the Lord if the creative power was given for us to be able to make one another we try to make someone just like ourself and will make the worst one most of the time that's where our struggle is praise the Lord Branham says here he says Joseph another believer he could he couldn't help being what he was he was a prophet God made him a prophet he didn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different God made him what he is nobody else could take his place nobody can take your place no matter how he says if you said I'm just a housewife nobody can take your place God in his great economy has to set you the body of Christ in order he sets you in the body of Christ to get everything in order Till There is no one can take your place that's the reason why we we say we are waiting for the last one to come in amen because nobody can take the last one place whoever is the last one nobody can take their place are we together now so let's let's go back here and uh and and and and look at some few things let's let's go to the book of uh uh acts as chapter seven let's go back to the book of ask chapter seven oh my God oh my God I don't know why I'm not a fast speaker turned is normal time is normal praise the Lord now as chapter 7 brings us to a place where Stephen yet if you read ask chapter seven you you have to read it in a way or as you will not see it but in a way that Stephen starts to speak to the the others he starts to speak to them he brought in the picture that he took it all the way from Abraham amen he took it from Abraham let's let's Dash in there quickly and see if we can we can we can uh uh [Music] um verse 1 then the high priest and and uh then send the high priest what these things are these things so sorry and he said man in brethrens and father second Our God the god of Glory to appeared to Our Father Abraham need to rest my mind amen the god of Glory appeared to Our Father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelled in Sharon and said unto him get thee out of that country and from that Kindred and come to a land which I will show Thee the Abraham did that no he never did it the first time that's what Stephen will be showing slowly here when you read Abraham moved to a certain place to shush him until his father died praise the Lord amen so slowly Steven is going to show this but there is somewhere where he will where he will he will break he will he will he will take the lead out and you will see it that is always the second time before the people can grab it now because what Stephen was trying to drive to them is their job Jesus came because that's where his message was driving told about the Messiah he came and we rejected him we killed him because we were not to see it the first time follow me in a little baby you'll see amen I will give you much of the reading you go home and you do that because if I do it now and I'm out of time here praise the Lord amen verse 9 the Patriot move oh let me okay verse 9 the Patriot move within their soul Joseph into Egypt but God was with him and deliver him out of all his Affliction and give him favor and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of Egypt and he made him Governor over Egypt in all of his house praise the Lord he goes ahead and verse 13. verse 12 when but when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt he sent our fathers first he sent our fathers what first but what the next verse says let's read it together and at the second time so the first time they never got it the first time Joseph never showed himself to his brothers he sent our fathers first and at the second time Joseph was made new so that is the picture that Stephen is bringing out that every time when God is dealing with his people when Moses came the first time to deliver them they said we'll make you ruler and Josh over us praise the Lord he had to go back in the desert hmm praise the Lord so every time when God is is is dealing with us we don't we don't we don't grab it the first time you think you do are we together at that 10 times in in some people's life yeah even the god might give you the full time praise the Lord he might give you even the fifth time whatever no more of time he might give you he will give it to you because his word will never fail and at the second time Joseph was known to his Brethren's and uh Joseph Kendra was known unto Egypt so he goes about with this he goes about dealing with this uh uh uh uh thing about Joseph there's another thing here I want to show you uh uh verse praise the Lord are we together okay and then he goes about and he says he talks about Joseph there trying to give them that picture and he sees uh uh uh okay what I wanted to get you is verse 18. Verse 18 let's go there quickly let's go there quickly I already wanted to to make this a kind of a standard but after too much talking verse 18. he talks about uh verse 17 but when the time of the promise Drew night which God's sold to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt tell another king arose tell another because they will help us to understand here over there in Genesis the Bible says There Rose of a king that did not know Joseph There are rules of a pharaoh that did not know Joseph but here Stephen is taking us very deep to be able to see why this Pharaoh that rose up why he was rough with the children of Israel because he was another Thy word another is coming from two Greek words one is Alice and the other one is uh heterus now is is one of them is uh I'm using a black pen I thought I was going to bring Pen up I didn't bring them okay yeah I get two so I'm using a black pen to write and I want another pain it could be another black pen or I want another pen but a blue pin so uh uh alas is another of the same kind where heteras is another it's another thing but of a different kind are we together Isaiah 52 let's go there quickly now you have to realize now if there will be any delay you will be the one responsible foreign there's another place I want for us to go but time is now too much on our hand Isaiah chapter 52 let's look at verse 4. Isaiah 52 verse 4. for thus said the Lord God my people went down full time into Egypt so John there and the Assyrians oppressed him without curse praise the Lord so Stephen is identifying that pharaoh because Pharaoh was just a title so Stephen is identifying that Pharaoh with this verse that he was not an Egyptian he was an Assyrian so he was another kind praise the Lord amen now you have to realize that Egypt at a time was a superpower amen and and and and and people migrated to Egypt and they took on uh Egyptians identity and just like Moses he was held by the the the the the the daughter of of a pharah adopted he became an Egyptian but he choose to reject that and identify himself with his origin praise the Lord amen so now you think about it two adopted kids in the Kingdom and you have to realize that the next to the throne praise the Lord amen and uh you know the nature of man has never has never changed praise the Lord foreign both of them are immigrant but one thing he's a better immigrant than the other are we together amen and now realizing that Moses forfeited go back and re-exit it go back and re-exit her and just put your mind into the human nature when Moses came through the Pharaoh knew him because they grew up together they grew up together praise the Lord now you can see why thy Pharaoh increase his hatred why nothing there was presented before him with all the supernatural he was seen he just could not hold back [Music] because he was another a different kind are we together but for you to appreciate that let's go back to the scripture you are First Corinthians chapter 15. for you to appreciate another let's just run through here first Corinthians chapter 15 just like I said we will we just go through this and find a place to close and then we will continue another time praise the Lord First Corinthians 15 39 the Bible says the Bible says here verse 38 but God gave us a body as it have pleased him and to every seed his own body every seed has their own body amen praise the Lord All Flesh is not the same but there is one kind of Flesh of a man another that's the same thing it's all flesh but they are not of the same kind right some we can eat some weekend right right but it's a flesh praise the Lord amen some flesh we can eat some flesh we can but they are all flesh are we together second Corinthians chapter 11. another kind another kind just just so we can be able to appreciate the thought 11 verse 4 the Bible says here for if he cometh and preach another Jesus praise the Lord so you see here he's taking uh the Apostle Paul is saying that uh they will come using Jesus cardboard building another image preaching another Jesus either tie him back to the Lord want to make him a Jews because that's why the Jewish church was doing they wanted to make Jesus a Jew they wanted to identify him so why were they doing trying to force the Gentiles to be circumcised are we together they are using the court but preaching another gospel praise the Lord Hebrew chapter 7 Paul speaks above that when he talks about the Melchizedek priesthood that this priesthood is a mother it's not it's not the same kind with the Leviticus this is another it goes beyond the laws it was the priesthood that was with God before the erotic priesthood before the levitical priesthood so he says he has promised us another priesthood praise the Lord Jesus is in John chapter 14 he says another comforter true he says another comforter which means is you will get the scene you will get the same kind of comfort just in another way I will not be with you in flesh now I will be dwelling in you so it's not a pharaoh of a different kind but this one is the same it's it's a it's a it's a black pen just this one is not writing I want to use a black pen it's another pain but stay black another comforter not dwelling with you but not dwelling in you right right praise the Lord Saint John chapter 3 Jesus speak about another birth praise the Lord amen this time is not a black pen no I'm using the black pen I want another black man no no this new birth is different from the first birth praise the Lord that's what makes it it's another birth is different Jesus said to Nicodemus you don't have to go back in your mother's womb it's a birth that comes by the word praise the Lord so you see when you look there in in Acts chapter 7 there there there are some tremendous things that that Stephen brought out just to make us to realize that every time God there with his people they really did not drop it the first time Abraham did not move the first time he moved out he did not went completely into the promise why because as humans we always think we have a better way to bring this thing to pass we have a better way to bring God's word to pass we always think that we are smarter praise the Lord but if we were resolved to understand I would have gone into the forward uh uh thing I was talking about here the four temperament that's the next place I wanted to go but I will take I'll take that off another time and then you will see how each one of us we have we we are in one of these temperament and the temperaments changes it depends on the mood that you are in praise the Lord and and we we have these temperaments and this attitude in this flesh but here there is a promised word that is down in our heart praise the Lord as most of the things that that we deal with in the flesh and and and and and and and and and and and sometimes we think that uh you know we we you know we we understand it and nobody can understand what we are going praise the Lord Hallelujah most especially in our teenage young people like I've always says that age is the age where we start to look for our personal identity the struggle of trying to find ourself praise the Lord [Music] all the the chains and cells in our body is running so fast and we're trying to find ourselves We compare ourselves with movie stars We compare ourselves with with sports stars we're trying to find we want to find our identity we don't want to be like Mama and Daddy they are too boring praise the lord we want to be ourself and sometimes we think we know what we are doing they don't understand us and we don't understand ourselves either that's the truth because this time you flip I mean uh you you you you you see one music style you like you grow your hair just like him and then you guys you see another basketball style you go you cut it off and then you dress like like that you you we don't know what we are doing there is a lot of things that is that is going on and and and and and and and and and and sometimes even we as parents if we were if we would just step back a little bit and realize that we don't understand what we are going through true you might say is that well I went through that all the experience is not the same the reason why is because you and your children don't have the same temperament you don't have the same temperament so when you are going through your eyes the way you would deal with it and you expecting them to deal with it when they are going through theirs praise the Lord what are you doing you are not using the principle of reflection you are using the principle of resemblance you want them to look like you when I was like you this is what I did when I was like you you are trying to bring resemblance you are holding the whole picture in your mind and you're trying to draw them to that praise the lord we don't have time to go into that we're out of time here but that's they'll say that the the foundation thing here is that nobody can take your place amen nobody can take your place that is the foundation think of it here let me read something here to you and then we close this thing to think identify Masterpiece of God brother Ben says to think that a man that was made in the image of his creator and was giving a war to stand behind that's where the beautiful thing comes out a beautiful picture that God gave us the world to stand behind that that word could never fail that the Christian hope the Christian hope his shed his armor is his Rock today to stay behind their word praise the Lord it's his protection is his defense that's his City of Refuge that he can run to the word praise the Lord every believer he says now you must never get from behind that when you do you are opening the doors to the enemy when you say oh well well you you can do a little this and a little debt praise the Lord God wants you to separate yourself from everything that's cause sin praise the Lord everything that caused sin when we start making our own choices that's that's where that's where the struggle comes from that's where the struggle comes from because he's reflecting his love down in our soul for us to be able to bring forth a life to his praise and to his glory but we are so capture on the outside praise the Lord and we we always have a smart way to introduce our things always have a smart way I can wear the pink hair but I can just put one line of pink coming down I'm not just like them praise the lord it's just a flesh appealing yes it's just the flesh appealing this word is not able to to produce a perfect reflection praise the Lord amen nobody goes and look for their picture look at your picture whether it's a snapshot or whatever you don't look at that picture to know what you are now you don't look at your picture you look in the mirror before you go and take a picture you want to produce yourself but you look in a reflecting glass that is not you why are you not looking at your picture to take a selfie you won't face your hair just take the picture take a picture and then look at that picture and fix your head you got to look in the mirror you got to look in a reflecting glass that is something completely different from you praise the Lord you see so that the whole thing here is that God is determined that his word his thought his purpose concerning your life will not fail do whatever you want praise the Lord do whatever you want you're just going to carry yourself when those men in the wilderness they talk that they can challenge Moses they just took themselves around the Wilderness until every one of the murmuring group they're complaining group The challenging group they die right in the wilderness but God's purpose to take his people to the promised land he still brought it to pass you would just be creating a deaf walk for yourself because you are so stuck in your skin but God's purpose concerning your life will not fail praise the Lord it will not fail there was something in that board on the cross there was something in him that knew how to represent I mean recognize a man of God there was something in him that knew how to recognize a one that was innocent there was something in him that knew how to recognize truth yes sir and what he did all of his years was he struggle with that thing yes look it into the wrong places he used that thing to make the wrong choices but God's purpose for his life did not fail a caught up with him the last minute praise the Lord amen we are dealing with seed God started the entire world with a seed principle every seed must bring forth of his kind seeds are very powerful praise the Lord amen amen seeds are very powerful there is just one seed that was dropped down there now it has a big old tree standing by this house we are afraid that it should not fall this way but that's the power of seed praise the Lord and every seed has a skin every seed has a flesh and for their seed to bring forth it must be able to die they must be able to break out of that flesh for it to be able to bring forth another life a same kind of its own but another sea we bring forth of his kind musicians you can come musicians you can come we don't have enough time to be able to look into this eat and as the Lord will give us Grace we will we will look right into it praise the Lord amen amen the thing there is the other most of the time we think that we have a better understanding of what other people are going through you know we look at other people yeah I know that's what they mean yeah that's that's the way they can do it you know you you are just you are just dwelling on a false assumption and what is happening there is that it's also denying you the privilege praise the Lord because it will have been better to just go meet the brother give him a handshake I said bro I don't understand you know I just wanted to talk to you you know I just see this and it it create more Fellowship you become more free when you come out of there they're just going with an assumption and you keep feeding it and keep feeding you you keep feeding it it keep feeding you it creates social Council in you that you don't even have a strength to mention that person in prayer you know what the devil will do is that as soon as you gather in prayer he just Cloud your mind it's a cancer he just Cloud your mind with that thing you can't go above it you are just mumbling words but your mind is just stuck on an image [Music] you see that I was I was looking at this thought and because foreign as a pastor you you sit down you think you think about the the church you look at the growth you look at the movement you look at the things that is happening and then you sit right there you say it you say Lord [Music] this is your c word this work is a seed of you that was planted because you see the as a church you will always have people coming and people Glory people comes from different places and you know different environment different upbringing different way of believing different way of doing things and as as they come into the body [Music] they appreciate the worship they appreciate the place they want to make it home but yet sometimes we are caught up in a way things were done so we expect that and if it does not happen you just shrinking you close up you can either close up or you just criticize everything it's not that's not the way we used to do it that's that's not the way it's supposed to be done that's it you know you you just go back and forth in all of that and then but it's about it this is a body this body is designed to serve its purpose and that's what I believe even being in this neighborhood we have a purpose to serve and when that purpose is over God's going to move us or wherever he want us to be the Lord we have a body this group was ordained for a purpose this group was ordained to to get a work done for many it will be a place of transit for some it will be a long time that it will stay here you know you you think about that you you see the different things that is happening it looks like different changes it looks like different challenges but I rest my faith on God's purpose for this church we never fail praise the Lord they will never fail foreign [Music] we have to realize it's not all about you this is a body this is a group and just like you are dealing with different things everybody is dealing with different things I just went through a very tough time never experienced that before but uh the Lord was gracious very gracious precious talk about it sometime in the future but you see that's that's that's what it is you know I was just praying about all of these things praying about all of these things Lord our young people father even our men you know we're brothers will come together and says let's find a time to pray thank you let's take up responsibility sisters who just uh it don't have to be a big group who visit with one another we'll find a little time where we can just take small knees I see this sister let's pray for her I see this person let's pray for them but if we go back in the reverse we expect to experience the supernatural we expect for God to be in our midst but we stay in our home and destroy what we expect we'll talk about this person talk about this person bring this one down send this one out we do all of that but yeah we come together we are expecting from God you have a place nobody can take your place you have a work to do you have a position in the body have a gift that you brings to this body this body can benefit from your gift you don't have to be singing you don't have to be preaching it don't have to be but you you are unique in a way that we need you to survive foreign purpose to bear his reproach do not bearing my reproach I'm not bearing your reproach we are bearing his report and told that Old Testaments hates when they grab those men in the book of arts and the whip then they came by rejoicing why were they rejoicing they were rejoicing because they felt grateful that we are partakers of your suffering we were not able to stand for you in Palace heart we deny you empower this man so when they call Stephen and John and all of those men and they whipped them they were glad they were they came by rejoicing because he has he has counted them worth it to partake of his suffering your suffering will not benefit us my suffering will not benefit you but it's when we are partaking of his suffering then it benefits the body of Christ Heaven Rejoice over it that clean heart oh God [Music] and renew the right Spirit Within Me [Music] creating [Music] and renew the right Spirit [Music] Within Me cast midnight presence [Music] salvation [Music] cast me not away [Music] thank you restore one two three [Music] Jesus talk about the parable of the ones that were giving talents talents are the different gifts that God gave in his body the different gifts that he placed in US different things that he want to do the way you want to use you to be a benefit to his body he gave us the hands of a gift that the feet does not have the feet have a gift that the haze does not have and the different parts of the body has a gift very very very very important in whatever is our place that God will have can you imagine been in the body and feeling or useful you are in a bother you feel that you are not useful or you are in a body and we don't feel your impact it's all because you make yourself a strange make yourself a strange in a way you think in a way you Worship in a way you respond to the word you might have a unique way to respond to the word in a way that you you you just your heart is just there is God that identified those different things if a person sits here and feel like I'm a stranger I don't belong here it's because you make yourself that way you make yourself that way the thoughts that are going through your mind the things that you are dealing with you making yourself that way and if you even feel that this is not the right body for you my prayer your Mighty couragement to you is that wherever you go find your place in that body be part of it because it's the body of Christ whose life we will lose all our interview individuality is going to be one body he's going to be the center of everything Jesus is the center of everything [Music] dear father Lord I pray that you would just help each and every one of us Lord dear Lord I serve as as a pastor of this local group This Is My Heart Lord father I know that God your purpose concerning every life that sits on our preaching will not be defeated Lord your people goes through different things father how I wish Lord we have the the the natural ability to help them in the area of their need but you design it that way for them and Lord you also put us in a place where we are
