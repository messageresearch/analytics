[17:02] we're just gonna invite brother jordan
[17:03] to come on
[17:20] man it's wonderful to be here in service
[17:23] this evening
[17:25] you know saints sometimes things aren't
[17:28] conventional sometimes
[17:31] it's not just the way you would expect
[17:34] it to be
[17:34] but nonetheless god honors
[17:38] when we come together two or three you
[17:41] can feel his presence here now
[17:42] you know maybe our song leader your
[17:44] typical typically would see is not here
[17:47] he's unable to lead but you know god's
[17:50] able to use
[17:51] each one of us as we enter into worship
[17:54] you can just feel his presence come down
[17:57] so i can see here we have a prayer
[17:59] request from our brother juan hernandez
[18:01] i want to bring that before you
[18:03] he's asking prayer for a neighbor friend
[18:05] who has spinal cord degeneration disease
[18:08] he's in a wheelchair now and been like
[18:12] that for a year today
[18:14] i visited with him and prayed for him i
[18:17] witnessed to him
[18:18] about christ our lord his name is tom
[18:22] thomas and he just quotes here
[18:25] he wrote down hebrews 13 and 8.
[18:28] you know he's the same yesterday today
[18:32] and forever
[18:33] and no matter how far gone medical
[18:35] science would look and see
[18:36] and say it's too late it's never too
[18:39] late with our god
[18:41] let's remember this neighbor of our
[18:42] brother juan hernandez
[18:44] thomas that god could still do something
[18:48] here
[18:49] if not a physical healing although he's
[18:51] more incapable of that
[18:53] maybe a spiritual healing would be far
[18:55] greater
[18:56] so let's just take him and lift him
[18:57] before the lord each one of you would
[18:59] have a need on your heart just lift your
[19:01] hand
[19:01] before the lord tonight he knows that
[19:03] need he can come down and meet that need

[19:42] lord that
[19:43] you would come down and lord touch him

[20:11] father lord that you would move on the
[20:12] scene for your people
[20:14] or we ask you to bless the minister

[21:39] [Music]
[21:41] you know god has really been working in
[21:43] my life this past
[21:45] month and it actually started
[21:48] this easter when
[21:51] thank you it actually started this
[21:54] easter when uh
[21:56] i believe it was brother ben that came
[21:59] to preach
[22:00] and you know i kind of came here with my
[22:02] cousin emmanuel
[22:04] and we sat down and i'm not sure if we
[22:06] came kind of late
[22:08] or during the song service or the
[22:11] preaching but when i started hearing it
[22:13] was like
[22:14] i was kind of getting rebuked and i know
[22:15] that was the spirit you know
[22:17] you know he just was talking about how
[22:19] people would come and sit down in church
[22:20] and be statues
[22:21] or you know well see the holy spirit
[22:25] moving and just be quiet
[22:26] you know love the world so much to the
[22:29] point where they were dressed like him
[22:30] and look like them you know
[22:31] and at first i was getting kind of mad
[22:34] and when he was saying that he kind of
[22:36] pointed at me he was like people say
[22:37] that hey when we point at them
[22:39] but who else am i supposed to point at
[22:41] you know
[22:42] i still remember that you know and i
[22:44] when he said that i'm like oh yeah
[22:45] that's god talking to me right there you
[22:47] know
[22:48] and i got kind of i got kind of humble
[22:50] inside and i just really listened to him
[22:52] you know
[22:54] came back sunday you know and it was a
[22:56] blessing after that day i just
[22:58] i wasn't the same i could feel it you
[23:00] know even though i was still hanging
[23:01] around the same people i just didn't
[23:03] feel the same
[23:04] you know and that sunday
[23:07] my god's grace is when i really gave my
[23:09] life to god you know when i really made
[23:11] the decision you know because we have to
[23:13] make a decision you know
[23:14] to actually walk and serve him and i
[23:16] believe that sunday
[23:18] is when i really made that decision to
[23:20] walk and serve him so i give him
[23:22] glory for that you know so
[23:25] i moved back home i had to stop hanging
[23:27] out with certain people

[48:45] name we pray
[48:47] amen amen the lord bless you tonight
[48:51] you may have your seed praise the lord
[48:56] i was i was speaking on the uh on the
[48:58] message on
[48:59] on sunday and i just took a portion of
[49:02] it
[49:03] to use for
[49:10] to use for our mother's day
[49:13] uh team
[49:16] we just took a portion of it to use
[49:20] and uh
[49:26] and that portion that we took
[49:30] out of uh what we wanted to talk about
[49:32] was uh
[49:33] and so a good praying wife or mother
[49:37] can do more for the kingdom of god on
[49:40] her knees
[49:41] at home than some sometime the preacher
[49:45] can do on the platform
[49:48] praise the lord now we we use that
[49:52] to be able to show uh the
[49:55] the virtue that god
[49:59] bestowed upon the woman even though we
[50:02] are living in an
[50:03] age where people think that
[50:06] i mean the women have have to rise to
[50:09] the highest of power
[50:11] you know and and we see the we see the
[50:14] saints
[50:15] you know we see the the cry for equality
[50:18] and all of that and and and they cannot
[50:22] be doing it in the natural
[50:24] uh uh if god has now already fulfilled
[50:27] it in the spiritual
[50:29] praise the lord is because god has
[50:32] brought
[50:33] his church his bride uh to that place
[50:37] you know where it is christ in bright
[50:40] form
[50:42] amen christ in bright form it is at a
[50:45] place where the bride
[50:47] is is is at the same place you know like
[50:50] brother branham shared the same spirit
[50:52] you know the same the same word the same
[50:55] anointing same flesh
[50:56] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit
[50:59] of my spirit
[51:00] and he said word of my word now so
[51:03] so we we see all of that but
[51:06] you know god held hear the power
[51:10] of the woman you know in her virtue
[51:14] in those three sacred vectors that god
[51:17] gave the woman
[51:19] that's where he hate her power now re
[51:22] recognize now that also has
[51:26] is comparison to the church as
[51:29] god gave the woman three sacred vets you
[51:32] he gave
[51:33] also to the church three sacrifices so
[51:36] the power
[51:37] of the church the power to raise the
[51:40] dead
[51:41] the power to speak to nature the power
[51:44] to bring our body
[51:45] to obedience is in those three
[51:49] sacrificed you
[51:53] the power of the woman was hid in her
[51:56] virtue
[51:57] what did the serpent attack her virtue
[52:02] when said when when when when when uh
[52:04] when the second
[52:06] attack her vets you then she lost her
[52:09] power
[52:12] when the devil can take prayer out of
[52:14] the church
[52:15] when the devil can take the pure word
[52:18] away from the church
[52:20] then we just left with form and
[52:22] formality
[52:23] that's right that's right
[52:26] we just we just make drama and just make
[52:28] fun and make everybody laugh and
[52:30] you know and tell some funny story then
[52:33] and and and just just amuse the people
[52:38] are we together so the power of the
[52:42] church
[52:43] just like the woman like i said and and
[52:46] and uh uh uh god
[52:49] had to pull the entire creation to sleep
[52:56] praise the lord now you see he even
[53:00] repeated the very thing under the
[53:04] covenant of redeeming israel
[53:06] honor the covenant of redemption when he
[53:09] told
[53:09] abraham to make a a
[53:12] a a covenant with him that you will have
[53:15] a seed it will be your seed
[53:19] and through sarah you will become the
[53:22] father
[53:22] when abraham was crying and abraham
[53:25] wanted to make eliza
[53:27] to be the one that will inherit his
[53:29] inheritance god said not
[53:31] not nassau is not going to be you will
[53:34] have a son
[53:35] by the matter of fact he brought abraham
[53:38] out in the evening time
[53:40] and what he did he repeated the very
[53:43] same thing that took place in genesis
[53:46] that's right at the forming of the woman
[53:50] he repeated because why like that's why
[53:54] that's why the prophet of god said in
[53:56] invisible union
[53:57] that virtue was given to her for
[53:59] redemption
[54:03] so god here repeated the very same thing
[54:06] when it came to the covenant
[54:08] of redemption he put
[54:12] army abraham to a deep sleep
[54:19] he pulled the entire creation to a deep
[54:21] sleep
[54:22] because there was darkness
[54:27] and it was god alone that was left
[54:31] to to to to uh uh drive the flowers away
[54:35] from the sacrifice
[54:39] praise the lord amen the power
[54:43] of the woman is in a virtue
[54:48] it's not in knowledge praise the lord
[54:53] the power of the church is in
[54:56] her virtue yeah
[55:00] praise the lord but branson is the
[55:04] beauty of the church
[55:06] is the character of the people
[55:12] the beauty of the church
[55:16] is the character of the people how the
[55:18] people
[55:19] submit themselves to the word how they
[55:22] respect
[55:23] and reference the word of god now how
[55:26] they ride on the word of god
[55:28] for their own selfish gain
[55:37] are we together
[55:41] praise the lord
[55:45] so we realize that the ministry of
[55:48] intercession is one of the greatest
[55:51] ministry
[55:54] in the church one of the greatest
[55:56] ministry in
[55:57] in in the scripture in in i mean in the
[56:00] bible one of the greatest ministry in
[56:02] the world
[56:04] praise the lord uh
[56:07] amen i'm looking for a better word to
[56:10] use
[56:12] amen now so we use their code
[56:17] to be able to uh uh
[56:23] speak on the gift of mother that was
[56:27] that was one of the greatest gift
[56:29] that god gave to the word when he gave
[56:32] us mothers praise the lord
[56:36] but there was another
[56:39] portion there was another quote that i
[56:42] read
[56:44] amen and
[56:47] [Music]
[56:49] that was from the mighty conqueror and
[56:52] brother dear brother branham says
[56:55] if there is any credit to be giving
[56:59] to the brandon family is to my wife
[57:03] she is the one who stands between me and
[57:06] the public
[57:09] now so uh uh
[57:12] uh that quote related to the scripture
[57:16] that we read i want us to go back to the
[57:18] book of numbers chapter 16.
[57:27] because on sunday i felt like i was
[57:30] caught between
[57:31] two tops you know i wanted to i want to
[57:35] go on and preach
[57:37] on the uh the ministry of intercession
[57:40] and and then i wanted to keep the
[57:43] thought of
[57:44] of the gift of motherhood
[57:48] praise the lord amen and to be able to
[57:52] show the gift of motherhood
[57:57] i needed to stay in in line of
[58:00] of trying to do my best like i did on
[58:03] sunday
[58:04] praise the lord
[58:08] so i won't ruin the whole thing
[58:12] glory be to god but we we read this
[58:15] scripture
[58:16] on sunday numbers chapter 16 and it was
[58:20] there from verse 44
[58:21] and the lord speaks unto moses saying
[58:23] get you up
[58:25] from among this congregation that i may
[58:28] consume them
[58:30] as in a moment and they fell
[58:34] upon their faces that's moses and aaron
[58:38] and moses said unto aaron take a sensor
[58:40] and put a fire
[58:42] there in from of the altar
[58:46] and put on incense and go quickly
[58:50] onto
[58:54] the congregation and make an attorney
[58:58] for them
[59:01] praise the lord
[59:06] for there is raft gone out from the lord
[59:11] and the plague is begun and aaron
[59:14] talk as moses commanded and ran into the
[59:17] midst
[59:18] of the congregation and behold the
[59:19] plague was big
[59:21] was big uh the plague was begun among
[59:24] the people
[59:26] and he put on incense and made an
[59:28] atonement
[59:29] for the people in his tool between
[59:33] the living and the dead
[59:36] and the plague will still
[59:39] praise the lord amen
[59:43] you will find that
[59:48] you will find that that became
[59:52] as that became a that became a statement
[59:55] that became
[59:56] a statement that brother branham use
[1:00:00] in few cases i really want to you
[1:00:04] tonight
[1:00:06] it wouldn't it would not be up there so
[1:00:08] just follow me
[1:00:10] he says i come as
[1:00:14] a priest standing between the living and
[1:00:17] the dead
[1:00:18] and i offer to you lord these prophets
[1:00:22] of this meeting tonight
[1:00:25] these ones who have come and hear the
[1:00:29] word flat
[1:00:30] hi staying preaching but the truth
[1:00:35] and they have accepted you upon the
[1:00:38] basis
[1:00:38] of your sheer blood the reconciliation
[1:00:43] the reconciliation work
[1:00:45] of the holy spirit bringing them through
[1:00:47] the blood
[1:00:48] to their savior the lord jesus christ
[1:00:59] jairus daughter brother branham said as
[1:01:01] he prayed he says
[1:01:03] he says we pray that your
[1:01:07] that your great grace will reach down
[1:01:10] and and and forgive us
[1:01:14] forgive every sin that's honored the
[1:01:17] tent tonight
[1:01:18] i prayed are standing between the living
[1:01:21] and the dead
[1:01:23] that you will forgive every trespass
[1:01:26] now so you see just like how it was
[1:01:30] in the in in the ministry of moses
[1:01:33] you know because you have to realize god
[1:01:36] called moses
[1:01:37] you know to be the prophet of the exit
[1:01:40] and uh and and and and
[1:01:44] uh because of moses uh
[1:01:47] uh uh humbleness
[1:01:51] and uh and you know like brother branham
[1:01:54] says
[1:01:55] after his experience uh with the burning
[1:01:58] bush
[1:01:58] he became one of the most meekest man
[1:02:01] and and he even started yeah he he
[1:02:05] struggled to speech
[1:02:06] to speak and and based on that
[1:02:09] god told moses to call his brother
[1:02:13] brother aaron so it was the prophet
[1:02:16] that was calling the fifo ministry
[1:02:20] because the priest in the old testament
[1:02:22] was a type of the fight for ministry
[1:02:25] and if you if you if you read the book
[1:02:27] of leviticus you will
[1:02:28] you will realize that moses
[1:02:31] had to even watch his brother aaron
[1:02:34] and his sons he has to wash them he had
[1:02:36] to anoint them he had to address them
[1:02:39] so that's the work that the prophetic
[1:02:42] ministry do
[1:02:43] told the fightful ministry and
[1:02:47] but you will see here that uh
[1:02:50] uh moses
[1:02:53] we know the first time uh uh the people
[1:02:57] rebelled against god and god got so
[1:03:00] angry
[1:03:01] you know with the people we saw that
[1:03:03] moses
[1:03:04] threw himself in the gap right praise
[1:03:07] the lord
[1:03:08] he said lord you have to kill me before
[1:03:11] you get to these people
[1:03:14] praise the lord and uh and and
[1:03:17] that was a perfect type of christ now so
[1:03:20] you can see
[1:03:21] that there is something there
[1:03:25] is something the the minister of
[1:03:28] intercession
[1:03:30] is right to the heart of god
[1:03:35] praise the lord
[1:03:38] that ministry is right to the heart of
[1:03:40] god
[1:03:41] because the bible says
[1:03:45] to wait it was god in christ reconciling
[1:03:48] the word back to himself
[1:03:50] praise the lord so it's always the
[1:03:53] ministry of jesus christ
[1:03:56] the ministry of intercession is the
[1:03:57] ministry of jesus christ
[1:03:59] we realized that back in in eden
[1:04:03] when uh uh uh when when he fell
[1:04:08] and uh we we we saw
[1:04:11] adam in uh in one sense
[1:04:16] taking the ministry of intercession
[1:04:19] why because uh paul would let us
[1:04:22] know that adam was not deceived
[1:04:26] that's right amen
[1:04:29] adam was not deceived it was the woman
[1:04:32] that was
[1:04:33] in the transgression so which means adam
[1:04:36] with an eye open he stood
[1:04:40] in the gap to be able to redeem his wife
[1:04:48] praise the lord amen
[1:04:51] he's still in a gap to redeem his wife
[1:04:56] because he knew that the lord of god
[1:05:00] was broken
[1:05:04] praise the lord amen
[1:05:08] now it was not like eve tried to
[1:05:12] to to seduce him
[1:05:16] praise the lord
[1:05:20] or he tried to convince him i i can see
[1:05:23] better than you
[1:05:27] no it was adam there was there was not
[1:05:30] much
[1:05:30] of a conversation right
[1:05:36] he knew what has happened
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:43] you see when when when we make that
[1:05:45] wrong
[1:05:46] for conversation that's where all the
[1:05:50] reasoning power comes in
[1:05:55] he realized what has happened and he
[1:05:57] stepped right in the gap
[1:06:01] he stood between the living and the dead
[1:06:07] so we see that it's a ministry
[1:06:10] right from the heart of god
[1:06:14] if god not if god
[1:06:17] god had a plan of redemption
[1:06:21] at the back part of his mind
[1:06:26] amen amen so with that plan of
[1:06:29] redemption
[1:06:31] he had an interceding heart
[1:06:35] ignoring that for him to
[1:06:38] display his attributes
[1:06:41] that's right
[1:06:44] there will come this order there will
[1:06:46] come chaos that will come
[1:06:48] seen praise the lord
[1:06:55] so intercession
[1:06:58] is right from the heart of god
[1:07:05] are we together praise the lord
[1:07:10] now so when you take this language
[1:07:14] year where the the the the scripture
[1:07:17] says
[1:07:20] verse 48 and he stood between the living
[1:07:23] and the dead
[1:07:24] and the bible says and the plague
[1:07:27] still
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:36] when jesus was on the cross
[1:07:42] he was between the living and the dead
[1:07:45] and he said it is finished
[1:07:50] the same question was answer
[1:07:54] right just like how
[1:07:57] when aaron stood between the living and
[1:08:00] the dead
[1:08:00] the plague still when
[1:08:03] jesus said it is finished the same
[1:08:07] question was answered right
[1:08:13] praise the lord amen
[1:08:17] now so then and then and then
[1:08:21] brother brandon brings this right into
[1:08:24] the family life
[1:08:28] praise the lord he brings this right
[1:08:32] into the family life
[1:08:35] which of course the man is a type of
[1:08:38] christ
[1:08:40] and the woman is a type of the church
[1:08:43] i call into efficiency
[1:08:46] are we together
[1:08:51] praise the lord now this is not just
[1:08:55] a complimentary statement
[1:08:58] he's complimenting his wife but it's
[1:09:01] more than a complimentary statement
[1:09:07] it's a calling
[1:09:12] it's a calling
[1:09:18] i praise the lord you see that's the
[1:09:21] reason why
[1:09:22] on sunday we try to we we we made a
[1:09:25] little bit of emphasis on
[1:09:27] on the victory that is given to the
[1:09:28] church as to the woman
[1:09:30] and the purpose of it
[1:09:34] god had a purpose
[1:09:37] he had a design in his mind
[1:09:44] praise the lord
[1:09:49] are we together amen
[1:09:56] she's the one who stands between
[1:10:00] me and the public praise the lord
[1:10:05] hallelujah we can go
[1:10:08] in a way of of family life
[1:10:13] and talk on uh
[1:10:16] you know how
[1:10:20] their their the responsibility
[1:10:24] you know uh of uh
[1:10:27] of the woman or how the woman carried
[1:10:30] this
[1:10:30] out but we we
[1:10:35] kind of trying to focus merely on the
[1:10:37] church on the spiritual life
[1:10:39] i think
[1:10:42] we can learn from this i think all of
[1:10:44] our sisters must learn from this
[1:10:47] praise the lord and if you want to know
[1:10:50] how
[1:10:50] it is i mean uh
[1:10:55] it's in a way that uh you reference and
[1:10:59] appreciate your husband praise the lord
[1:11:03] amen there's a way that you reference
[1:11:05] and appreciate your husband
[1:11:07] because we have to realize that's the
[1:11:09] position of the church
[1:11:10] the church is representing christ
[1:11:14] because of the failure of the church
[1:11:17] and and the poor example of christian
[1:11:21] life
[1:11:22] that's the reason why the name of jesus
[1:11:27] is is almost like uh uh
[1:11:30] it has it has become uh you know
[1:11:36] very loyal to to the world today
[1:11:42] praise the lord it's not because of
[1:11:46] our lord is because of the church
[1:11:52] praise the lord
[1:11:56] the church that is the wife of jesus
[1:11:58] that is the bride of jesus christ
[1:12:00] that's supposed to be standing between
[1:12:02] the public
[1:12:03] and our lord she's becoming worse than
[1:12:08] the public
[1:12:10] amen she sits with the public and she
[1:12:13] laughed at her husband
[1:12:16] you know and she said things
[1:12:20] you know are that are that are complete
[1:12:22] contrary so you see
[1:12:23] you see why the word is the way it is
[1:12:26] today
[1:12:28] is because the church has lost her
[1:12:30] position
[1:12:32] right right that's right praise the lord
[1:12:42] now so as we as we as we as we go along
[1:12:45] with this
[1:12:47] we see here that uh
[1:12:51] it's a ministry that is right right at
[1:12:53] the heart of god
[1:12:56] a ministry of intercession
[1:13:02] that's the reason why the prophet
[1:13:04] prophet of god could say that
[1:13:06] a praying woman can do more on her knees
[1:13:12] than the poop there the preacher in the
[1:13:14] pulpit
[1:13:15] we know the preachers are doing a lot
[1:13:18] for the lord
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:36] are we together tonight
[1:13:43] brother branham speaks this again year
[1:13:50] as he's praying over here in this
[1:13:53] mighty conqueror message that he
[1:13:58] preached
[1:14:08] he says in god we pray that as these
[1:14:11] handkerchiefs lay
[1:14:13] upon the bodies of sick may christ look
[1:14:16] through
[1:14:16] his own sheer blood and ah
[1:14:20] the faith that these people had and made
[1:14:23] the devil get scared
[1:14:25] and leave the people and may they pass
[1:14:28] tall the good land of health and
[1:14:31] strength
[1:14:33] as god has promised them bless
[1:14:36] these who are present here these who are
[1:14:39] sick and afflicted
[1:14:41] this wave their hands on each other
[1:14:45] i ask in their behalf as
[1:14:48] standing between the living and the dead
[1:14:53] that i challenge the devil
[1:14:57] you are nothing but a bluff satan
[1:15:01] you bluff the people but jesus christ
[1:15:06] hide the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:15:09] and
[1:15:10] gave them to the church he
[1:15:13] took the keys of death and health away
[1:15:16] from you
[1:15:18] he's the mighty conqueror
[1:15:22] and you are stripped of everything
[1:15:25] that you ever possess you are nothing
[1:15:29] but a bluff
[1:15:30] and we are calling your hands
[1:15:34] in in the faith and and uh the faith
[1:15:38] of our lord jesus christ the faith of
[1:15:40] the son of god
[1:15:42] praise the lord amen
[1:15:46] now so we see the other uh
[1:15:49] and as you will look every time that
[1:15:51] brother branham used this statement
[1:15:53] it was always uh uh and in most times as
[1:15:57] you
[1:15:58] you you can go and make your session on
[1:16:00] it
[1:16:01] you will see that it was always in a
[1:16:03] time of praying
[1:16:04] and it was always when he was standing
[1:16:07] for the people of god
[1:16:10] praise the lord now you think about this
[1:16:19] we have this uh
[1:16:21] uh uh uh uh
[1:16:25] situation word
[1:16:32] brother brandon master prophet
[1:16:37] and he came uh you know when and uh you
[1:16:40] know
[1:16:40] just just as a a young preacher
[1:16:44] god dealing with him and taking him
[1:16:46] through the different stages of his
[1:16:48] ministry
[1:16:49] and and also
[1:16:52] he's learning the word of god and he's
[1:16:54] even learning to understand what vision
[1:16:56] is and learning to understand what you
[1:16:59] know what what his gift
[1:17:00] is you know brother branham talks about
[1:17:03] the first time he preached and he
[1:17:05] preached the message
[1:17:06] you know talking about uh uh abraham
[1:17:09] and lots you know and then he left for
[1:17:11] his head and he cried you know
[1:17:13] and brother barum said he preached and
[1:17:15] he says he left what he said and he
[1:17:17] cried
[1:17:17] he says and i cried and he says and the
[1:17:20] people cried
[1:17:22] praise the lord then
[1:17:26] he says after the service
[1:17:30] her pastor told him and says billy
[1:17:33] that was one of the most
[1:17:37] sign preaching i've ever heard
[1:17:41] praise the lord he says
[1:17:45] he says because you know barely
[1:17:48] preaching is not appealing to the to the
[1:17:51] sympathy of the people
[1:17:56] praise the lord brother branham says
[1:17:59] jesus did not die
[1:18:01] for you to feel sorry for him
[1:18:04] so you can feel sorry that he died or
[1:18:07] because he died for me i gave my life to
[1:18:09] him
[1:18:10] that's not the reason why he died
[1:18:15] praise the lord amen
[1:18:18] he did not die for you to feel sorry for
[1:18:24] him
[1:18:29] are we together so preaching is not
[1:18:32] to appeal
[1:18:37] for your sympathy
[1:18:41] amen oh for you
[1:18:45] or for me to convince you
[1:18:50] no my work is for me to preach this word
[1:18:56] and the holy ghost do the convicting
[1:18:59] is god that do the convicting he
[1:19:02] convicts the people heart
[1:19:05] and what what what he used to convict
[1:19:08] people
[1:19:08] i don't know anything about it that's
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:12] praise the lord
[1:19:22] be to god
[1:19:28] so he said he said that was one of the
[1:19:31] most sad preaching
[1:19:33] that i've ever heard billy
[1:19:36] he says because you were just appealing
[1:19:38] to the sympathy of the people
[1:19:40] he says he said think about a lawyer
[1:19:45] go into a court to go and stand
[1:19:49] on behalf of someone
[1:19:52] that have done wrong praise the lord
[1:19:56] he has he don't go and tell the people
[1:20:00] in the court or tell the jury
[1:20:02] see this boy he's just a little boy
[1:20:06] he didn't know what he was doing you
[1:20:08] feel sorry for him can you see that he's
[1:20:10] a little boy
[1:20:13] you don't win a case like that
[1:20:18] you have to bring a convincing
[1:20:21] argument praise the lord
[1:20:25] why he's not guilty
[1:20:30] praise the lord amen the preaching of
[1:20:33] the gospel
[1:20:34] is to bring a convincing argument
[1:20:38] why your sin is forgiven
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:42] yes sir amen we have the evidence here
[1:20:47] that's what the preaching of the gospel
[1:20:49] is is to bring
[1:20:51] a convincing argument that before the
[1:20:53] foundation of the word
[1:20:55] the father knew you he hired you
[1:20:58] in his plan come on
[1:21:02] come on
[1:21:06] yes sir it's not to kind of
[1:21:09] make a story to make you a church member
[1:21:18] or just a convincing story just to show
[1:21:21] that
[1:21:21] you know i uh you know what uh you know
[1:21:24] our preacher our pastor know the message
[1:21:30] the preaching of the gospel i was
[1:21:33] looking at the scripture today
[1:21:35] my goodness
[1:21:39] i remember i read it year one one either
[1:21:42] wednesday night
[1:21:43] or on a convenience service let's let's
[1:21:45] go to
[1:21:46] uh uh corinthians 15.
[1:21:51] glory be to god are we together tonight
[1:21:57] amen
[1:22:01] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:22:02] says no man has the right
[1:22:06] to preach the gospel until he has met
[1:22:08] god amen
[1:22:12] because you are going between the living
[1:22:15] and the dead
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:25] oh praise the lord tonight
[1:22:35] are we together first corinthians
[1:22:37] chapter 15.
[1:22:39] is that what i said
[1:23:01] see what paul says here
[1:23:04] and when i read this this morning i read
[1:23:07] this early this morning i was
[1:23:08] kind of meditating praying
[1:23:12] and uh i read it
[1:23:16] i started thinking about it see what the
[1:23:18] apostle paul said verse
[1:23:20] one see moreover brethren i declared
[1:23:22] unto you the
[1:23:24] gospel which i preached unto you
[1:23:28] which also you have received
[1:23:32] and we're in year 10 praise the lord
[1:23:37] amen by which also ye are saved
[1:23:40] you are saved by the gospel
[1:23:46] if you keep in memory what i preach unto
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:49] unless ye have believed in vain
[1:23:52] listen now he says for i i deliver unto
[1:23:56] you
[1:23:56] first of all that which
[1:24:00] i also received
[1:24:03] how that christ died for our sin
[1:24:07] i calling to the scripture
[1:24:13] listen carefully now
[1:24:17] and that he was buried
[1:24:21] and that he rose again the teddy
[1:24:26] a calling to the scripture
[1:24:31] that's what the gospel is
[1:24:35] praise the lord you remember jesus said
[1:24:38] it's in john chapter five sess the
[1:24:42] scripture
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:49] so what paul is saying the gospel
[1:24:53] is what
[1:24:57] god has already spoken by the prophets
[1:25:03] being fulfilled amen
[1:25:07] are we together amen
[1:25:13] how jesus was born according to the
[1:25:16] scripture
[1:25:17] it has to be a calling to the scripture
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:23] yes praise the lord that's what
[1:25:26] makes it the good news yes
[1:25:30] amen that whatever we are believing that
[1:25:34] we call the message
[1:25:35] we can prove it by the scripture
[1:25:42] which means god have said it amen
[1:25:45] amen god has prophesied god
[1:25:49] has spoken by the prophets of all
[1:25:53] hundred years or two thousand years ago
[1:25:56] and hear that very word being fulfilled
[1:26:03] amen he said i would call a people
[1:26:08] from the gentiles by my name so you are
[1:26:11] here tonight
[1:26:12] according to the scripture
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:17] that's the gospel no coincidence
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:29] praise the lord so you see
[1:26:33] we have a defense that's why john could
[1:26:36] say we have an
[1:26:36] advocate we have a defense we can make
[1:26:40] our argument
[1:26:43] because we have the scripture right
[1:26:46] praise the lord we have the word we can
[1:26:49] bring it back to the word
[1:26:52] the word speaks about the dead and the
[1:26:55] time that we are living in
[1:26:59] amen it speaks about the grace that will
[1:27:02] come
[1:27:02] to a people in this age
[1:27:07] he speaks uh last wednesday we were
[1:27:09] talking a little bit
[1:27:10] about uh uh death cannot change your
[1:27:13] nature
[1:27:14] and and uh you know talking about after
[1:27:16] after the you know the
[1:27:18] the the the the millennium
[1:27:22] and and all of that and i you know as i
[1:27:25] was studying
[1:27:26] on that i mean there were other things
[1:27:28] that that i was looking into
[1:27:31] i was saying to myself oh my goodness
[1:27:34] oh my goodness
[1:27:37] praise the lord amen
[1:27:42] praise the lord
[1:27:45] even the prophet of god
[1:27:50] over and over brother branham talk
[1:27:53] uh uh as in john chapter five that jesus
[1:27:56] statement says the scripture
[1:27:59] he took it he ran with it in his
[1:28:01] ministry
[1:28:02] what was he doing because everything
[1:28:05] that is was fulfilling in his ministry
[1:28:08] had to be a calling to the scripture
[1:28:11] that's right
[1:28:12] yes sir praise the lord
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:22] now sometimes we get this thing a little
[1:28:25] bit mix-up
[1:28:26] as i was thinking about it this morning
[1:28:29] we get it a little bit mix-up
[1:28:31] brother branham said a prophet
[1:28:35] is a divine interpreter
[1:28:40] of the word amen
[1:28:43] a prophet is a divine interpreter
[1:28:48] of the scripture
[1:28:53] praise the lord on the basis of that
[1:28:56] statement
[1:28:57] many people think the message has
[1:29:01] the interpretation for the bible
[1:29:04] sure no that's not what brother branham
[1:29:08] meant
[1:29:13] a prophet is a divine interpreter of the
[1:29:16] scripture
[1:29:17] and the scripture
[1:29:21] is of nose man's interpretation
[1:29:24] right you can add to it
[1:29:27] you can subtract from it so what a
[1:29:30] prophet ministry does
[1:29:32] a prophet ministry comes and place the
[1:29:36] people
[1:29:37] rightly in the scripture
[1:29:42] it show us in the scripture our
[1:29:45] dispensation
[1:29:46] right amen it show us in the scripture
[1:29:50] the types and shadow
[1:29:54] that was speaking of our day and that's
[1:29:57] how the prophet divinely
[1:29:59] interpret the scripture he does not
[1:30:01] divinely interpret the scripture out of
[1:30:03] the scripture
[1:30:05] no he divinely interpreted scripture by
[1:30:08] taking us back to the scripture
[1:30:13] look at jesus ministry he came and he
[1:30:16] says
[1:30:16] i said it's written in the scripture
[1:30:19] read the gospel and see how many times
[1:30:22] jesus referred back to the scripture
[1:30:24] because that
[1:30:25] is the gospel
[1:30:31] what is it all about is showing that god
[1:30:34] talked about that time right he said it
[1:30:38] by a man isaiah or a man jonas or a man
[1:30:42] you know he even played in the life
[1:30:49] praise the lord
[1:30:56] he played things concerning us in the
[1:30:59] life of man
[1:31:01] that that did not even know they were
[1:31:03] fulfilling scripture
[1:31:04] or they were plain types that would be
[1:31:06] fulfilled in our day
[1:31:14] praise the lord
[1:31:28] that's why when brother branham talks
[1:31:30] about the opening of the seals
[1:31:32] and the mystery on the back of the book
[1:31:38] some people thought brother brown was
[1:31:39] going to bring something extraordinary
[1:31:41] he said no it has to be there
[1:31:43] right it has to be in a scripture
[1:31:46] so the work of a prophet is to come
[1:31:50] and take this very same scripture
[1:31:54] and open it and say this prophecy
[1:31:58] this day this scripture
[1:32:01] is fulfilled right that's the work that
[1:32:05] that is the divine interpretation work
[1:32:07] he's doing
[1:32:09] it's not interpreting something that is
[1:32:11] not in the scripture
[1:32:28] he preached what paul preached and we
[1:32:30] believe that he preached what paul
[1:32:32] preached
[1:32:33] paul says everything that i've preached
[1:32:35] all that was given to me
[1:32:37] this this um uh corinthian chapter 15
[1:32:41] when he says the things that were given
[1:32:44] to me
[1:32:45] we know what paul was those things were
[1:32:48] given to him by divine
[1:32:49] revelation
[1:32:52] he never lend those things from uh from
[1:32:55] gamalia
[1:32:56] right those things were given to him
[1:32:58] when paul says
[1:33:00] what i have received
[1:33:04] praise the lord the lord
[1:33:08] the night that he was crucified
[1:33:12] paul was living at that time but he was
[1:33:15] not among the apostles
[1:33:18] he was not there that night when he was
[1:33:20] crucified
[1:33:24] praise the lord
[1:33:29] even all the apostles marty mcluhan even
[1:33:33] peter that the king was giving talk none
[1:33:35] of them
[1:33:37] could have bring us
[1:33:40] a teaching and order they could not
[1:33:43] bring to us
[1:33:44] what the significance of the communion
[1:33:47] they had that night
[1:33:48] the night that he was crucified
[1:33:51] paul was the only one that could teach
[1:33:53] it how did he taught it
[1:33:55] because it was revealed to him
[1:33:58] he said that wish i have received
[1:34:04] i gave unto you
[1:34:09] now you think about it a man being
[1:34:12] taught
[1:34:13] in the scripture
[1:34:16] as he was right
[1:34:19] do you think he would just take anything
[1:34:24] you think he would take anything
[1:34:30] just because peter said it or james said
[1:34:32] it
[1:34:33] oh he's the brother he's the brother of
[1:34:35] jesus so you know i believe it
[1:34:38] no that was my paul no no no no no no no
[1:34:41] that was not paul that was not paul
[1:34:47] it has to be a calling to the scriptures
[1:34:53] that's what the gospel is if it is not a
[1:34:56] calling to this
[1:34:57] scripture it's garbage it's not a gospel
[1:35:00] because it's only the spoken word only
[1:35:03] the spoken word
[1:35:05] has the power to reproduce itself
[1:35:18] i mean we can we can we can be we can be
[1:35:21] smart
[1:35:22] to connect the prophet said the prophet
[1:35:24] said so it means this this this
[1:35:26] if it is not calling to the scripture
[1:35:28] it's just
[1:35:29] it's just going to make the people laugh
[1:35:31] or happy wow wow wow
[1:35:34] it does not have the power to produce
[1:35:37] itself until it's according to the
[1:35:40] scripture
[1:35:48] praise the lord
[1:35:52] the ministry of intercession
[1:35:56] it's the ministry that has been given to
[1:35:58] us
[1:36:00] just like brother branham said
[1:36:04] if there will be any
[1:36:08] credit that will be given to christ
[1:36:14] after he died and resurrected
[1:36:19] praise the lord do you see that's the
[1:36:22] reason why
[1:36:23] throughout all the ages will be rewarded
[1:36:29] brother branham talks about that story
[1:36:32] about that
[1:36:32] evangelist after my call
[1:36:38] they had a dream when he died and got to
[1:36:42] the
[1:36:42] to the gate of heaven his name was not
[1:36:44] in the book
[1:36:47] he said no you're making a mistake
[1:36:51] he says he says i'm evangelist my call
[1:36:57] you're making a big mistake praise the
[1:37:00] lord
[1:37:01] say well you want to go and play your
[1:37:02] case he said yeah
[1:37:05] he went there and brother branham says
[1:37:07] before that great light
[1:37:10] the simplest thing was made so
[1:37:14] great that's why no man can stand
[1:37:18] justified
[1:37:20] praise the lord
[1:37:24] but the prophet of god says
[1:37:27] he feeling that condemnation in his
[1:37:29] heart
[1:37:31] and realizing there was
[1:37:34] there was every reason why his name was
[1:37:36] not in the book
[1:37:39] but there came the sweetest voice
[1:37:44] father he's two for me he's too
[1:37:48] between me and the public
[1:37:53] he's two for me on earth
[1:38:05] that's the reason that's the reason why
[1:38:07] before
[1:38:09] we go into our internal inheritance
[1:38:13] god we have to give rewards
[1:38:18] says you stood for me is too
[1:38:21] between me and the public your little
[1:38:25] christian life you live
[1:38:30] praise the lord
[1:38:42] standing between the living and the dead
[1:38:49] is a ministry right from the heart of
[1:38:53] god
[1:38:55] praise the lord
[1:38:58] the scripture says
[1:39:02] the king of sodom came
[1:39:08] and all the nations around came and
[1:39:10] fought
[1:39:11] against sodom and captured the king and
[1:39:13] lot and you know and took every one of
[1:39:15] them
[1:39:17] and the bible says and abraham heard
[1:39:20] about it
[1:39:22] praise the lord
[1:39:26] he was not a king he never had a kid um
[1:39:29] he never had an organized army all he
[1:39:31] had
[1:39:32] was just children that were born in his
[1:39:33] house that was seven
[1:39:37] praise the lord he took what he had
[1:39:42] yes sir he did he took what he had
[1:39:49] to go and rescue his brother
[1:39:54] and bring back lot
[1:39:58] and because that was right to the heart
[1:40:01] of god
[1:40:04] god came down maggie said it came down
[1:40:17] and gave him a convenient service
[1:40:22] praise the lord
[1:40:26] so you see that ev every time every time
[1:40:30] every time you pray for somebody the
[1:40:34] bible says
[1:40:35] over here in the book of john you know
[1:40:37] that he that restored
[1:40:38] a brother
[1:40:49] it's a ministry of intercession
[1:40:52] it has to be god
[1:40:56] because that's the ministry of god
[1:40:58] that's the purpose of the gospel
[1:41:01] is to reconcile people with god
[1:41:10] praise the lord
[1:41:15] like jesus said greater love have no man
[1:41:19] than for the man to lay down his life
[1:41:23] for his friend amen
[1:41:26] as a ministry of intercession
[1:41:33] and we have to be god in your heart
[1:41:39] crying out for another soul
[1:41:44] i mean where you are crying crying out
[1:41:47] lord
[1:41:48] save this person lord help this person
[1:41:52] it will have to be god
[1:41:56] because it's the ministry of
[1:41:57] intercession
[1:41:59] to wait that god was in christ
[1:42:03] reconciling the word
[1:42:14] praise the lord amen
[1:42:18] and that's the reason why you know when
[1:42:20] you get down and you just selfishly pray
[1:42:22] for somebody you know how you feel
[1:42:25] praise the lord amen you know how you
[1:42:28] feel you know you just don't feel right
[1:42:32] amen and then and and and i mean you can
[1:42:36] brag on it
[1:42:38] well i've been praying for you you know
[1:42:40] i've been praying for her you know i i
[1:42:42] do pray for her yeah yeah i do pray for
[1:42:44] her
[1:42:45] those kind of a statement people say
[1:42:48] shoving their shoulder yeah i do pray
[1:42:49] for her
[1:43:01] that's what the church is called for
[1:43:04] remember like i said the power of the
[1:43:07] church
[1:43:08] is in her venue that's the reason why
[1:43:12] when the church starts becoming wally
[1:43:16] amen start dressing like the wall and
[1:43:18] start doing like the world
[1:43:20] she robbed herself just like
[1:43:23] just like i said on sunday you see the
[1:43:25] the entertainment world
[1:43:28] they go to look for that virtue
[1:43:34] and a woman to make her a star
[1:43:39] you go and see a pretty young girl
[1:43:44] a virgin young girl very pretty
[1:43:48] and he says do you know that you can be
[1:43:49] you can be a uh
[1:43:51] you know uh you can be a mother she can
[1:43:54] be you know
[1:43:54] whatever way they call it and then they
[1:43:58] go and take her then
[1:43:59] and you know this the spray her face and
[1:44:03] paint her head and do whatever they want
[1:44:05] to do to her
[1:44:06] and set her up praise the lord
[1:44:11] and pretty soon that innocence
[1:44:15] flies away and now she thinks she's
[1:44:19] somebody she's on a magazine
[1:44:24] praise the lord then she's right in the
[1:44:27] trap of the devil
[1:44:33] and just like jesus said he comes to
[1:44:35] stay killed and destroyed
[1:44:37] he will rob her of everything
[1:44:42] her vets you her woman who her mother
[1:44:44] who
[1:44:45] rubber of everything
[1:44:49] just because of pride and because of
[1:44:51] money
[1:44:57] it ever came true the channel of
[1:45:00] reasoning
[1:45:02] but what he affected was the virtual
[1:45:05] that eve had
[1:45:15] and that's the same thing he would do
[1:45:17] when he take praying from our home
[1:45:21] and take praying from our life
[1:45:24] we are going in the rapture because
[1:45:26] we're in the message
[1:45:28] no prayer life no time with the word
[1:45:32] no intimacy with the word
[1:45:36] where you can read your bible and see it
[1:45:38] speaking back to you
[1:45:40] you can get down on your knees and speak
[1:45:42] to the father
[1:45:43] like he's right there
[1:45:50] praise the lord
[1:45:53] the devil can rob the church of dead and
[1:45:57] just give
[1:45:57] us a name
[1:46:01] in that name he knows that is a
[1:46:03] blasphemous name
[1:46:11] that is the greatest ministry praise the
[1:46:14] lord
[1:46:16] you see it is a ministry for all of
[1:46:18] god's children
[1:46:20] because it's god's ministry when he
[1:46:22] birth you by his word
[1:46:25] you start praying and reading that's
[1:46:27] what brother branham said
[1:46:31] when he was asked
[1:46:35] how can i get closer to the lord pray
[1:46:37] and read your bible every day
[1:46:44] it's a sign that you are breathed by the
[1:46:46] word the word has break you
[1:46:48] right because you are having the desire
[1:46:51] of the father
[1:46:56] you think about somebody to pray about
[1:46:58] pray for
[1:47:01] you pray for your parents you pray for
[1:47:03] your friends
[1:47:05] and that word is closing you up and
[1:47:09] and and and it's burning on your heart
[1:47:11] like jeremiah said
[1:47:13] young jeremiah the world like a fire
[1:47:16] burning in my bones
[1:47:21] you want to tell somebody about jesus
[1:47:26] praise the lord you don't feel ashamed
[1:47:28] to invite somebody to church
[1:47:34] that thing is burning in your heart you
[1:47:35] say oh god
[1:47:39] can you give me just one soul to my name
[1:47:45] someone i can encourage to the kingdom
[1:47:47] of god
[1:47:56] the ministry of intercession
[1:48:00] right from the heart of god
[1:48:09] god will give the credit to his bride
[1:48:13] when he reward her for the things
[1:48:19] i read that quote to you our time is
[1:48:22] late here
[1:48:23] and brett brown says you know
[1:48:26] media hair turning white on her head she
[1:48:30] got to deal with the children and all
[1:48:32] the guests and people
[1:48:33] all filled in the house she got to keep
[1:48:35] the children quiet
[1:48:38] she got to entertain the people when
[1:48:39] they come
[1:48:42] give them a place for their sake to
[1:48:44] sleep
[1:48:45] give them a little space for them to
[1:48:46] sleep
[1:48:51] and they have to stay there cup days to
[1:48:54] wait for brother branham to return back
[1:49:05] standing between me and the public
[1:49:10] that's why he said that's a godly wife
[1:49:17] praise the lord you know that's that's
[1:49:21] all
[1:49:21] god desired from us
[1:49:26] what he desired praise
[1:49:29] we must just praise him just praise him
[1:49:32] just worship him
[1:49:34] praise the lord that's all he desired
[1:49:36] for us
[1:49:37] praise god and see how he moved on your
[1:49:40] behalf
[1:49:46] and that's the same thing in the
[1:49:47] families in in in the family cycle
[1:49:53] when the wife can praise the husband
[1:49:56] you know he's a good man
[1:50:00] praise the lord sometimes he says well
[1:50:03] yeah
[1:50:04] i'm just telling the truth you are
[1:50:06] telling the truth but you're just out of
[1:50:08] place

[1:50:10] is on your knees
[1:50:12] go to god and tell the truth i must tell
[1:50:15] jesus
[1:50:16] that way you should tell the truth
[1:50:19] it's not standing on the street and

[2:10:51] brother branham said he said it in
[2:10:53] stories
[2:10:54] he said in statement he said it
[2:10:58] you know sometimes you don't pick up
[2:11:01] those deep things in deep things
[2:11:05] you pick up the deep things in simple
[2:11:07] things
[2:11:09] very simple things that he says right
[2:11:12] you have to know that his ministry was
[2:11:15] to bring
[2:11:16] the loose ends together that's right it
[2:11:18] was the climax the calling of the brine
[2:11:22] so his the the minister of better brand
[2:11:24] was was
[2:11:25] featuring on the brine right you know
[2:11:28] was calling
[2:11:29] the fullness of the bride and uh so
[2:11:32] i mean there are things that that are
[2:11:34] there
[2:11:35] and we can see the type the pattern in
[2:11:38] the word
[2:11:39] you know and uh i was i was
[2:11:42] i was studying something to that and and
[2:11:45] i thought i could speak on it
[2:11:47] but it's amazing you think about boaz
[2:11:50] and ruth
[2:11:51] you think about the many gentile women
[2:11:56] that we use in the scripture yes
[2:11:59] listen to this now do you know that the
[2:12:03] scripture
[2:12:03] did not recall the death
[2:12:07] of any of those gentile women
[2:12:14] the scripture not that they did not die
[2:12:17] they died
[2:12:18] but the scripture did not record it
