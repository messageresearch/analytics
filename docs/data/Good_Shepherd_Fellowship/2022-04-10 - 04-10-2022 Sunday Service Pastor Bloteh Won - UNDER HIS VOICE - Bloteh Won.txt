his face and he wasted it on his head good to see you willie amen praise the lord i almost asked the deacon take that man in the bathroom and let him clean the powder from his head i didn't know that his father came in with gray hair all over him but it's good to be in the house of the lord and uh that won't be service wednesday night uh because of the the meetings on the weekend uh we having our brother brother robert wilson a missionary brother uh uh he will be with us this coming or uh yeah the coming weekend from from illinois chicago uh he's a friend that we have known for for a while praise the lord amen he says he says you know he's he says he says brother one everywhere i go i i meet people that knows you now you have come to america and uh you're a pastor in the church and you don't want to do missionary work so he's on my case all the time but i i just tell him i'm i'm trying to look for the word of the lord so but he will be here with us and uh he and his wife will be flying in on friday so we look forward to have a wonderful time with him friday evening we will have a convenience service and then he will have saturday evening and sunday morning to preach to us and uh uh so actually this week i was thinking that we can we can go back to our prayer chain thing you know prayer chain that we normally do uh 6 9 12 3 and 6 p.m if you want to pick one of those time in a day to to to to go into prayer and it would be a beautiful thing i think uh i was looking at something over in [Music] first timothy chapter 2 and i want us to just look at that together a little bit before we get into preaching here paul uh the apostle paul was was talking to uh his son timothy instructing him and he said something that caught my attention praise the lord you know you read the episode of of of paul you realize that he had he had an amazing way where he he ministered in praying you know the apostle paul uh uh prayers uh a minister i mean i recall it you know the burden the way he expressed uh prayers and needs that's that's first timing chapter two verse one he says i absorb thee therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercession and giving of things be made for all men that he go to talking about and when when i read this it kind of forgot my attention because you see that we we put everything into into praying praise the lord and sometimes is is difficult for us to know when we are when we are supplicating before the lord or we are interceding before the lord or we are just we are just giving thanks and uh uh you know and then if you you look at all of these yeah i mean we can take the time to be able to go through each and every one of them and uh you know it will take a whole service for us to do that but uh you know i just i just want to share that with you uh uh as we as we want to just take this week before we get here the friday evening for our communion service and if you can make it i mean come over there's no need to to escape the communion don't be afraid of the community man praise the lord that's that's a way to identify with the word by faith and even though the word of god requires us to be faith to do it amen praise the lord so uh that's what we want to do this week and and then since we ended uh having service on wednesday night i would want for i want to meet with the young people after service today so we can see if it's possible for us to do a little bit of practice on on wednesday evening for those that will be able to make it because uh we've been we've been thinking about kind uh you know uh uh encouraging the few ones that want to sink and then you know come up with uh a kind of a sinking group so we want to we want to see if this easter can be our deliverance amen so uh let's let's meet after church and we will talk talk a little bit and see how the grace of god will be able to help us to do that so what as we as we will just spend time before the lord uh i want us to you know trust the law to approach this earnestly believing that god will you know will bring us uh a great blessing it's not only for the meetings it's for the time that we are living in in the things that we need god to move on our behalf for as a church as a family and as an individual praise the lord let's use this time to sit you know as family you know have a husband and wife talk you know let's uh parents and children talk let's deal with the little foxes that's paul divine amen amen let's let's uh let's get all all things off of our hearts you know when and uh i mean that uh that healing can be able to flow in our maze like a mighty stream and and the word of god you know i was i was studying this this weekend and there was something that struck me that i've not seen and uh uh it's i mean it really struck me and i was actually uh studying a little bit on the book of hebrew and and looking at the comparison between the mercury priesthood and the levitical priesthood and there was something that that you know that just that just struck me that that i never saw i always know that uh the priests who bear the people you know that's that's what the priest does he when he goes into the tabernacle he goes in and and confesses sin and go and confess the sin of the people but you see we have always thought that you know just like the prophet is the mouthpiece of god we have always thought that the the pastor or the the ministers you know come from the mess you know come with a message from you know from the presence of the lord like brother branham says you stay behind that sacred death until god speaks to you and all that so we have we have this mindset that you know we have a message to give to the people but if you study the scriptural pattern you will realize that the prophet the office of the prophet he comes and speaks for god unto the people but in reverse the priests speak for the people unto god praise the lord amen so as the priest is ministering to the people he's not bringing the message from god to the people actually as he's ministering to the people he's taking the promises of god amen identifying the needs of the people and speaking to god and say lord your word says this is your people we have these knees we have people that are backsliding we have people that are sick so if he's rebuking sin you see that's the reason why it's a wrong attitude for you to get angry with the preacher because he's dealing with spirits interceding on your behalf and then you sit there in front of your face and say god i don't want to be delivered what is this man just talking about my sin to you i praise the lord the holy spirit is actually identifying our need and presenting it to god you see so the attitude of the believer is when the promise is read even though we don't see that promise being fulfilled in our life but we can say god that's your word i take you at your word you said this will happen praise the lord i don't see it in my life yet but i believe it's your word and i believe your word do not fail amen praise the lord you see but but all of these years we have taken a court saying and my goodness i will blast those people when i get down there i'm just going to blast them that's a complete reverse and that has been the failure of the church praise the lord because a man comes behind the pulpit and he presents himself to be sinless he presents himself to be sinless on fire to burn all the people praise the lord amen when he cannot have one dream straight people trust him with things in your life then he he find a cult in a few bible verses then he comments says oh my goodness praise the lord well may god help every one of us [Laughter] oh my god please help me lord amen please help me lord but that was that was a beautiful teaching for me i says oh my god oh my god so let's just uh i just you know make the best use of this week you know it's uh we're not trying to you know uh create any kind of i mean there is no difference between the coming week and any week we must we must live constantly before god in prayers and obedience to his word but since we will be having special meeting around the resurrection of jesus christ this coming week i i think that we must be able to just spend some time in praying if the lord will be able to give you a window to spend some time before him in fasting go ahead we'll be praying for you and uh you know let's let's just uh uh keep one another in prayer praise the lord i have had a friend of mine a good friend of ours uh brother joseph chicosi that asked me to bring greetings to you while he had to be in california for the barrier i wish i got a hold of him early that would have flew him down yesterday to preach for us today and [Music] and then but we hope to having come some time very good friend praise the lord and he wanted me to do some services for him in the uk so we're looking to see how we can we can fulfill that it's been it's been uh a little bit overdue so we just we just trust in the law to see how we can be able to make all of that work but uh uh greetings also from uh brother simon peter over in the new york area he asked that we we agreed to you praise the lord and most of uh the other minister's brothers that we spoke with through the week yeah no i remember forget also a prayer request for brother bill youngs uh talked to him yesterday he's in the hospital from pneumonia and saw the service down in tennessee they shut down today because he's not feeling well so we'll keep him in our heart praise the lord amen amen amen i'm hoping that we can i can be able to catch up with some few things i know uh uh there's a young sister that texts me and says uh it's been a long time since the young people have had a prayer meeting i've been thinking about that i didn't have forget about your text though uh i just been thinking how to fit it in so as uh as the weather is getting warmer we will see we can be able to make some time here and and then spend some time with you young people praise the lord and then with all the wedding plans coming up i'm hoping to to be able to take uh a subject and uh uh on the on on there to be able to just you know uh uh talk about uh uh how do we we uh approach uh you know all of those marriage things here from this assembly really never take any form of teaching on it but uh i hope to be able to do that praise the lord so uh uh this morning uh i'm trying to do my best not to forget anything i taught uh for for this coming easter i will i will have uh i love to to speak on the on the message i spoke long time ago under his voice so i want to talk about on his voice uh to dating and just and just uh trust that the lord will will help us to to be able to bring something out uh on this how to go back in and and study a little bit because uh uh i had my notes stored on an app and it froze and i taught her i could i could have you know delete it and then uh reinstall it and then it would appear but it disappeared so thank god the holy ghost don't disappear amen because the holy ghost disappear praise the lord we will be done let's just stand on our feet and uh and and then uh praise the lord once again it's good to have you sister grace praise the lord i hear you've been having uh snorting rough weather in tennessee amen praise the lord matthew chapter 27 matthew chapter 27. matthew chapter 27 talking on this subject normally we will look at a lot of things around uh the opening of the seals but i will not go in that direction this morning i would trust the law to be able to stay in a place where i won't get more complicated since i won't have uh series of other services right after this i would not want to start something and then uh so let's read from verse 45 matthew 27 reading from verse 45 praise the lord now from the sixth hour there there was darkness over all the land onto the ninth hour and about the ninth our jesus crowd with a loud voice i want you to underline that a loud voice he cried with a loud voice because we are talking about honor his voice the thing that happens under his voice he cried with a loud voice saying eli ila lama sebastian that is to say my god my god why have thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man called for elias and straightway one of them ran and took uh a sponge and then filled it with vinegar and put and put it on the reed and give it to to him to drink the rest said let me let us see whether elias will come and save him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yield up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rained in twins from top to bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rained and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose so there were three things that happened under his cry the veil rented there was an earthquake and there was a resurrection praise the lord amen and the graves the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many praise the lord this is this is this is an eyewitness account there was a resurrection many of the sins arose and and like the scripture says they went into the city they actually went into jerusalem and people saw them praise the lord revelation 10 7 or revelation chapter 10. revelation chapter 10 i pray that the lord will we'll just early john chapter 10 reading from verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillows of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the seat in his left foot upon the earth and crown with a loud voice yes another crowd again with a loud voice praise the lord as when a lion rolith and when he had cry seven thunders alter their voices praise the lord let us pray heavenly father lord jesus we approach this subject lord god with humbleness of heart believe in the lord god until you come and bring your context out of your word we will just be your lord like a sounding bronze and a twinkling chamber father lord but we pray that god you will be able to bring something out of your word this morning instruct us in righteousness lord i'm just so god relying depending upon your father i pray that lord god you will just come in and bless the service bless your children lord bless the sacrifice of your people being here this morning and those who father god that are streaming into this service lord we love you and we appreciate your father in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat based on how the weather will be i forget to save that one and uh we will uh check with uh uh the deal comes checked with uh uh brother jordan but based on what the weather will be we might put up the tenta uh at the back there so uh we might just need the help of one or two brothers that can be able to come and help based on how the weather will be praise the lord amen so uh we want to look at this uh subject closely spoken a couple of times in different places i spoke on a year in this church but it was years ago so um praise the lord amen so what uh let me stats with something here uh the church in his condition verb talking about uh sacrifice he says here he says and that's the way salvation is is a complete sacrifice now he was talking about whether where the thought came from is that he was talking about how do we get something from out of the service you know he says it's the sacrifice that we make that's that's how we we are able to get something out of the service and something from god you know is the sacrifice that we made so then he goes on with this thought and that's and that's the way that salvation is it's a complete sacrifice it is but wrong he says it's a sacrifice that you have to do every day amen something to get closer to god and to do something and i know it's a sacrifice uh to you all this morning uh sit in this hot building of course it's not hard praise the lord amen but it's a sacrifice for you to be able to wake up this early morning when you could have just taken the rest and stay in bed and and but you were able to get yourself ready and pray for the service to be here as we sit here let's keep our minds on the greatest sacrifice that mankind ever was given to do that was jesus christ when he was charged to come to earth to dine in our state not only that but his soul descended into hell and was there for three days and night and on the third day he arose and now ascended on high sitting at the right hand of god in heaven making intercession upon our confession of his atonement and his grace that has been provided for us praise the lord what a sacrifice amen water sacrifice they'll let us not uh never allow there to leave our mind there is no amount of sacrifice that we can do in this life that will ever amount to that kind of a sacrifice praise the lord amen so we we just uh love the lord and and pray that the lord will will just uh bless our hearts as we fellowship together this morning i'm solely trusting on the lord now so as we look at this we are coming from the place where we want to see we want to look at these three elements and realized that as jesus was in his ethnic ministry as he come to the end of his ethnic ministry there were three things that happened under his last voice praise the lord so where we want to go with this thought is to is to see that in the book of revelation it is the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ amen praise the lord he had a three year three and a half year ministry on earth but in the book of revelation we realized that it was the continuation of his ministry so just like how it was in his ethnic ministry when he came to the end of his ministry there were there were elements of things that happened under the voice on the voice of god or under the voice of our lord jesus christ and uh and we know that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord so we can look on the dead and says well okay if this is uh the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ in the book of revelation and the laodicean church age is the last church age and there is the voice of god in that age and then we can also realize that uh uh uh those three things uh uh will also be under his voice so that's what we want to go with this talk this morning praise the lord amen are we together oh yeah we got to stay together glory be to god so the scripture says they are they're you know dead on the cross we we we know everything you know that that did happen but while jesus was in this uh this this last moment of his life uh uh he lifts up his head and he cry with a live voice you know and then he yield up the ghost but then we want we also want to see this because we are living in such a time people we are living in such a time just like i said you know we can only pray and say god hold back the wings of war because i mean what is what is happening in europe in europe now is is big is is uh beginning to draw a lot of concern praise the lord and uh but uh i mean we're not going to use that to create any kind of a scarecrow for anybody praise the lord because we know that it's going to happen it's just a matter of time amen praise the lord a man just need to get a cruel anointing on him and release the first nuclear bomb and then i mean the whole world will just be aflame just like the scripture says praise the lord amen so uh uh i mean uh it's it's it's just a time and you know and and when josh man is is in the land like this you know like the like the the the book of ezekiel show us there is always the ceiling injured around and i believe that the ceiling injury is around you know if you need the holy ghost he can give it to you praise the lord hallelujah so we want to see you but just before this happened we realized that between the six hour to the ninth hour there was darkness over the land amen which of course we know that uh uh isaiah make us to know there will be there will be darkness on the land and gross darkness upon the people we know that that is a spiritual form of darkness praise the lord the bible recalled there in egypt that there the darkness there was such a tech darkness the bible says it was so tech you know uh uh i mean that people couldn't even see the shadow of their hands and we know that darkness and uh is is uh uh in a spiritual sense is one major sign of an exeter praise the lord is one major sign of an exeter praise the lord so we see there was darkness you know and and and between the sixth and the ninth hour and jesus cried at the first time where he says my god my god what had that forsaken me that also was a kind of a language of the rejection that he fell praise the lord and the rejection of the word is the same as the crucification of the word praise the lord so the word was crucified the lamb was crucified so just like in egypt there was darkness over egypt but then in goshen elam was crucified praise the lord amen and we trust and see if the law will be able to help us to bring out those type uh uh for us uh this this morning so uh and then our lord jesus you know uh again let out a cry with a loud voice in the year of the ghost and we realized the scriptures say and behold the veil in the temple rented and we know that the veil in the temple was the place was the veil that was keeping uh the congregation away from the holy place amen and the veil the scripture says was rented from top to bottom so it means it was there it was the almighty god himself that did it when in one sense god was bringing to end that religious system amen he was bringing to end that religious system he was also bringing to end the the the aaronic priesthood praise the lord amen he was bringing to end that religious system it was it was god's way of letting the the the religious people know because that that veil was was such a consecrated veil that it was only the high priest alone that could go beyond that veil praise the lord and it was always kept close and yeah almighty god came down and just told it from top to bottom praise the lord so it was a sign that under his voice amen honor his voice in this last day will also bring an end to a denominational system and the voice of revelation 18 4 will cry out come out of her my people are we together praise the lord amen you see because uh on until we understand uh uh uh the uh understand the pattern of god and and uh i mean uh uh uh there are a lot of things around the the message that will not make sense to you praise the lord now let's let's let's go ahead i want to get ahead of myself and then we realized also that there the bible says in the the veil rented top to bottom and the f did quake so there was an earthquake praise the lord that was an earthquake and uh if you have time and you you you study the message a shame and brother branham deal with uh uh uh the the alaska earthquake he there with that vision of where he was out with those brothers you know and they were picking those things from you know from the uh from the uh from their their their paints and then he throw a stone in the air and you know and every one of them started you know and he uh says will hit the west coast praise the lord and that was that was when alaska had uh uh a terrible uh earthquake and uh and then if you if you look at biblical or scripture uh a principle you will realize that that also introduced uh uh uh it was a sign of joshua praise the lord it was a sign of joshua so there are three things taking place here so god comes on the scene under his voice when jesus cried with with a loud voice he dared with the religious system amen he condemned that religious system the veil was rented the next thing was he did wave uh uh uh i i i want to place it in as uh as the the the political system but it was a judgment on the earth because it was an earthquake praise the lord and and and the next thing that happened was there was a resurrection which was a spiritual thing are we together now he first did with the religious system amen and uh uh if you go down and read you will realize that the scripture said let me let me drop down a little bit the scripture said verse 54 now when the centurion and they there were with him washed jesus saw the earthquake praise the lord now they never saw the veil rent in the temple because this was these were these were gentiles amen they never saw the villain in the temple i believe that clarifies the high priest when he went to the temple and saw what happened there it drew his concern praise the lord so the religious people can see what is happening in the religious reign they can see how the church is detolerating praise the lord they can see it now the natural people also can see the system around them it's feeling praise the lord so these centurions the bible says and they were they saw the earthquake and those things that were done they fear greatly saying truthfully this was the son of god praise the lord so they might not know what is happening in the religious reign amen praise the lord but they can look at the word economy and look at things that is happening seeing the change in the generation and the the things that it says my goodness this word i don't know what is becoming they can see it they just don't have uh a structural interpretation praise the lord they don't have a scriptural view to be able to look in the direction that you and myself supposed to be looking but i can look around and see that you know things the school system is becoming bad and the medical system is not even reliable you can you can depend on the politician they can see all of these things as they look at it and say wow what a world we are living in what is it going to be for our grandchildren praise the lord so the natural people can see it now there was another thing that happened that a natural man can see even the priests in the temple had no idea about was there was a resurrection praise the lord and for 40 days old testament saints walk in the city of jerusalem jerusalem praise the lord amen for 40 days old testament saints visited the city of jerusalem like brother branham would demonstrate and says abraham and sarah say ma is this the city who's medical and bitter is god praise the lord and it will be walking and says sarah come here there's people coming first i just like to get in that prophet mind amen praise the lord so there was another thing that took place there was a resurrection there was a quickening power a seal was broken and there was there were a group of people that came to life amen so we see that these were the three things that took place under his voice now but but watch this now wash this you you just washed it let's go back here the bible says uh verse 52 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and they came out of the grave after his resurrection so you see there was there was something that took place there it's not immediately when he cry out that it just came out of the grave no he brought him he led captivity cutting praise the lord now so this will drop us to the place to realize uh what peter said over in uh uh first peter chapter three let's drop down that a little bit first peter chapter 3 amen oh glory be to god are we together first peter chapter 3. praise the lord let's look over here in uh in uh around verse 18 where he talks about for christ also have once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quaking by the spirit by which also he went and preached onto the spirits in praising praise the lord now so we we seen here that uh all of these things are taking place under his voice i'm trying to you know i'm trying to uh not to go ahead of myself i'm trying to to hold this thing together praise the lord now we know that we know that uh uh david in the psalm you know he prophesied you know open uh all he gets he everlasting doors let the king of glory enter now so uh peter now is is making us to see that after jesus yelled the gus amen after he yelled the ghost i love the way that peter said it here he says that being put to death in the flesh but quicken praise the lord so as soon as he gathered the ghost and gave his birth his spirit left and went right into action praise the lord put to death in the flesh but his spirit was quaking and went straight into action and brother branham says he went he went straight down to the lower region he was going for the keys of death and hell praise the lord amen like he would demonstrate in many messenger doors and those where he says he got down there and he knocked the door praise the lord and one maybe one security demon came over and saw that and says oh my goodness it's the one that they just crucified praise the lord walk right to thy devil and say give me the keys praise the lord and all those old testament that were kept in that region they were kept in a place where they have not been able to break into mortal immortality so he opened so we realized here that the uh uh this this is between the night that he was killed and the resurrection morning praise the lord you know it's it's it's the thing that brings the hope to the believer that there is no dull moment for the believer amen the moment that our eyes close in this life your spirit get out of this body then you praising god and you you worshipping the lord and you're greeting the saints and and i mean you just got into business there is no door moving praise the lord no there is no door woman when this afflict tabernacle shall be dissolved there is another one that we step into praise the lord ali i tell you you get more busy than you are busy here amen glory be to god because there is more wonderful things to see than there is more precious things to hear hallelujah glory be to god amen so we realized that uh that's that's what was happening there and uh so uh i've been dead in the flesh and quaking by the spirit and he went to and and preached to those spirits in praising now keep in mind now we're talking about honor his voice and yeri said honor the voice of the seven injured he also preached us a message about souls in prison praise the lord amen because that's the alpha and omega principle what happens at the beginning it finishes up at the end are we together praise the lord so we see here now that uh he went and preached to to spirits in praising and then paul led us to know over there in ephesians chapter four that he led captivity captives amen praise the lord so he was able to bring all those old testament scenes so we see all of those things are happening under his voice glory be to god amen that's the reason why uh the scripture says uh they that have you know that that uh that are dead in christ you know uh uh uh you know we that are alive will be caught up to meet them in the air praise the lord amen i'm kind of for thinking on on on my mind is caught up in somewhere thinking about the final voice to the final age praise the lord amen and so uh it's it's all in the place of word where we are coming to where where the bride is coming to where god is bringing his people to not just church members but our life amen our life you see when we when we spoke on the inspiration of the almighty and we were talking about a shimini woman we saw the kind of a life and attitude that she had it provoked the resurrection of her son and we take the attitude of these living sins to bring the resurrection praise the lord uh uh uh uh we we we are moving into the place where the the the bride is becoming the the final voice the bride life is becoming a voice praise the lord because brother branham says actually that is the thunder that the devil is afraid of not not just the literal explanation of the thunder but the thunder that turned out of a believer's life praise the lord are we together so we just i just want to run this in parallel for us uh uh this morning so we can be able to see some of these things i trust that the grace of god will be able to help us amen now so we see that uh uh uh uh we we talk about the religious system we will get back to death we talk about the the earthquake and uh let's deal with with with this resurrection praise the lord amen let's deal with this resurrection let's take uh let's go in the bulk of uh efficient let's go in the bulk of your fishing [Music] praise the lord let's go in the book of ephesians let's take ephesians chapter 2. let's take ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 will give us an idea here and you have heat quaking who were dead in trespass and sins amen wherein in time past your walk are calling to the cause of this word i call into the prince of the power of the earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience praise the lord i call in among whom also you all have your conversation your behaviors in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and and where by nature children of life even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love where will he love us amen even when we were dead in sin have he quickened us praise praise the lord quaking us together with christ praise the lord so you see a symbol there that the old testament sins when the earthquake took place they never came out alone they came out at his resurrection praise the lord now so the principle that i want us to see it is that uh uh there is a word that comes in every age amen there is a word that comes in every age john said it in a beautiful way i will keep my page right here i'll go go over again to first john no not first john john chapter one i'll go over to sin john chapter one because this this will this will turn out to be very very very important praise the lord amen see john chapter one it's it's it speaks right here uh he was in the word that's from verse 10 and in the word knew him that and the word was made by him and the word knew him that i'm sorry he came unto his own and his own received him that but as many as receive him to them give he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name now when you look at this then that belief on his name which were born not of blood is not your blood relationship none of the flesh none of the will of man the will of men but of god praise the lord which of course john over in his uh first and second episode he speaks about being born about of the incorruptible seed now so what is important here for us to realize his death and many that have received him give he the power is that power we want to look at to become sons of god it is now when we receive him that we become sons of god praise the lord amen no we we were always sons of god but what what happens right here is dead there is something that comes and quicken the believer praise the lord there is something that comes and and quicken him it wakes up that predestinated sea in every age for them to be able to identify the voice of god in their age [Applause] praise praise the lord amen wake up that young sister sitting there behind you you consider better than that praise the lord and so we realize here that uh that's that's what the power is is the thing that comes and quicken the believer bring you to a realization that oh wow you mean i just been wasting my life i'm a daughter of god praise the lord and that is the same thing that paul is identifying here we walk in the loss of the people of the world but god that is rich in mercy came down on the scene and quicken us praise the lord he quaking us which means something something became real amen something became real in another sense our graves were open and spiritually we resurrected because we know that this earth this is the earth and when a man died he's buried in the earth and we take up sand and said bluster dots and flesh the flesh amen amen praise the lord amen so you see that's where the quickening power comes it comes to wake us up to the reality of our age glory be to god amen and and and it's the same you have a lot of sons of god children of god out there they are children of god they love the law that takes their their bible to go to church they try to serve god in the best sincerity praise the lord i mean they contribute to the churches support the ministry but there is just a long game that just a longing inside that there is something i'm missing something has not come together yet [Music] amen oh you don't come to the message before you become a child of god no you are always a child of god but the word of every age just like genesis chapter 1 every day god had a word for that day let there be he did not get the creation in one day every day he spoke a word to the earth and the f brought forth that's the same thing in every age there is a word there is a message for that age and the message comes to waking the elect to the reality of the dead and the age that they are living praise the lord and until thy word quicken you you will love the lord you will love the church like jesus said except a corn of wheat fall to the ground and die he abarth alone he says but when he dies are we together praise the lord oh man this is not about putting the man on the pedestal amen this is not a cunning device people this is not a cut this is god's program that has been in all ages just like luther he was a catholic priest amen but when that word that just shall live by faith when that word was quickened to him that was the seed of god for that age when that word was quickened to him that it is not about me knocking my head and making my knees to bleed and and impenetrating and trying to please god but the judge shall live by faith believing on god's word when that word was quickened to him the catholic church couldn't hold him down because that was the word of god for that age just like paul the apostle that took an ought to to stop the name of christ he took a letter from the sanhedrin's council amen and he was going to jail those people hold their coat and let them stone stephen to death but on the road of damascus [Applause] a world was quick to him the jehovah that he knew of the old testament he said who are thou lord he says i'm jesus [Music] it's not belonging to the church people it's the effect of the quickening power there is enough word and promise in this book to wake you up from your grave and wake you up from your slaughterness to be able to break chains around your life there is enough power we serving the god that created the heavenly earth praise the lord amen we are presenting god's word back to him and lord it says lord you said in the evening time there shall be light your word said it amen you said there will be your bride your word promising the people with us put a wrinkle and we believe that you can bring that word to pass in our lives that's where we are this morning amen glory be to god hallelujah but god always have an avenue he always have a channel that he use glory be to god amen so we that were once dead in sin and trespass have he quit him thank you jesus amen have he quit him god reach in mercy amen there was an easter seal that was broken that's what easter means to the believer it's all about erasing christ a resurrect of christ that is living in us now pointing back to history he's the same yesterday today and forever are we together oh praise the lord i'm sure we can work with what we have amen glory be to god there are just tons of things that is floating through my mind now and uh but we can work with what we have glory be to god amen so we see that god always work with this kind of uh uh succession of things you always work in this china where he have uh either a tree for purpose and and you know and things happening so we see that under his voice it affected the religious system it affected the natural people that are on the earth and they also affected the world beyond are we together amen honor his voice it brought an end to a religious system that was stopping the people from getting to god he was bringing an end that no more one man will go in the presence of god for the people praise the lord no more one man you cannot go on your father or your mother experience the temple the villa is rented praise the lord amen and now we can all have access to god hallelujah we can go bowling onto the throne of grace no more a system of just raising one man before the people but this is the time where god want to have access to all of his children glory be to god amen that system is destroyed this morning we were playing uh on on uh uh we were playing the laodicea church age and brother branham was going over the seventh vision and he was talking about there where he he talked about his 1977 prediction now you see if you go back go back and read that again you will realize that brother branham was was was dealing with the system i mean he says with everything that i've seen happen i predict that by 1977 this system will come to an end praise the lord and out of the message you will even realize that it's recorded 1963 1954 was when america rejected her revival amen that was when america rejected our revival there was there was uh i mean all of these uh uh pioneer of revival was running all over the country now so 1963 i was just i was listening to to uh an episode from from from one from one good uh a bible teacher and he says it was it was when they throw the bible out of the school he says our problem actually started from 1963. he says that's when america started going down he said because that was a public rejection of god from out of our system praise the lord are we together so you see it's it's 1977 is always tied to the end of the word it was not to the end of the word the reason why is tied to the end of the word is because we tried to link the last vision praise the lord amen because if love is if in the last vision it shows that there was an explosion amen and america became a debris it's easy for you to link that to the end of the world praise the lord and it was in 1970 when david depleted there in south africa that is called mr pentecost that was when he took the pentecostal church back to rome praise the lord where finally catholic received all of our children back praise the lord so just like how those roman centurions were standing there and the only thing that affected them was the earthquake the shaking of the earth they they not even had an idea that there was a resurrection taking place they never had an idea that there was something that was taking place in the temple praise the lord that's the same way many people don't know what is happening behind a religious saying based on god's word praise the lord why is the church feeling the church that's supposed to be the harvard for souls the church has become the place where people are exploiting souls praise the lord are we together i know his voice amen let me take something here before i run out of my time praise the lord now we we we we also want to look at something here this will bring us to christ is the minister of god reveal wherever branham talks about god won gold with three full purpose praise the lord he had one goal but under that one goal there were three four purples that he was going to achieve hallelujah just like under his his voice one cried there were three things that took place so i want to look at this i'm trying to bring this in there's a reason why i will let you know if if i can get it together now he talks here he says now god god hard god has had free for purpose in his in in this great mystery secret in this great mystery secret that he had before the world begin he got a threefold purpose in it the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god amen who cover all space-time eternity he could not he too great he's too great to ever be revealed to his people because it will be too mysterious praise the lord hallelujah now you see sometimes if if if if we don't if we don't look at it carefully we will think that the manifestation of of of of god the father in the fatherhood traveling in a pillow of fire we we sometimes we might think there is part of the tree for purpose no it's not part of the tree for purpose praise the lord amen it's a 3-4 manifestation but it's not part of the tree for purpose because the tree for purpose is specifically to the redeem amen god above us god with us and god in us praise the lord is his is his uh uh a tree manifestation now if you follow me in a little bit you you it will settle down with you because i've taught i have taught that way too so uh uh so he said first thing god the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people and he couldn't do it that way because he's such so great too great to be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was he was talking about many of them but now you get it he wanted to express himself now that's that's that was word uh uh you know when we when we spoke on the uh the great time keeper god being the great time keeper god's purpose for time is to express himself amen so so uh uh uh no matter how many years that god gave us on this earth the reason why he number our days is for him to express himself in those number of days that's god's purpose for our life and for our age his purpose is to express himself he wants to express himself through us as a healer so in those normal days that we have we will get sick he wants to express himself as a provider we will go through things where we need him to provide we will express himself as a savior we need a savior to come to to be safe the purpose for our number of days is not to make our plans and and our it's all part of it you know it's not to just be so focused that's the reason why brother branham kept using that statement when he said it's only the thing that said god's purpose will rise again praise the lord and that's the reason why the child of god becomes so grateful when you look through all of the ideas and see all the the the you know what what my same as wasted years and the things that they have gone through that looks like oh god while my life was like this why did i go this and then they come to the place and realize praise the lord we come to the understanding to realize that god allowed us to go through all of that because he wanted to express himself and we can we will now understand the expression of god until we have come to be safe oh wow that's right lord that's why you allow this that's why you allow this thank you jesus praise the lord amen that was his purpose and the only way that he could express it was to become the son of man that's the reason why jesus kept talking about the son of man and they didn't know what he was talking about he wanted to express himself this that was his one of his greatest one of his great threefold purpose was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ praise the lord amen now the second secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers praise the lord so god was going to express himself hebrew 1 make us to understand that jesus was the express image it was god expressing himself identifying himself with the human race that he can come as little as in a blood cell to be conceived in the womb to be touched by the feelings of our infringes he never came on the corridor of heaven he took to come in the form of a seed when mary said be it unto me according to thy word god pregnanted himself in that womb praise the lord amen and he grew there through the nine months god expressing himself as a baby and he was born god expressing himself that's why the prophet god said jehovah crying jehovah nursing on his mother it was god expressing himself that's what he knows what happened with a baby in the womb he knows what happened that's why when ishmael cried ishmael cried jehovah sent an angel to dig a well for that baby to be fair [Applause] it was almighty god expressing himself to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he knows what an eight-year-old goes through he knows what a 10 year old goes through what a 12 what a 14 year old goes through because the scriptures say he was tempted in every way amen because he was he was dwelling in a feeling body he was tempted in everywhere praise the lord are we together but is god expressing himself so he got a one man body called jesus that all that god was he poured in that body he was able to achieve to have one man that was born without sex he was able to achieve to have a birth on earth a body would that prepare me are we together and he used that body as a way of chief praise the lord that if i was able to get one there are many sons and daughters that will come praise the lord so he achieved there then his second purpose secondly to have the preeminence in his in his body of believers that is his bride praise the lord you know you sit there you think about things saying and sometimes some things hate you and you say wow you know i was thinking about this and then adam and eve and through the weekend and it's it's it's just it just hit me now i was i was uh i think i was listening to a message or so and it just hit me and thinking about any the bible says that adam was not deceived amen watch a cutting place right there we we we talked about it how adam you know never took a second thought he never came home and says because adam was not home when eve was deceived adam never got home before he saw the disorder he knew that something has went wrong because he could hear the lion fighting and rolling he started to see disorder all over the garden of eden that he had never seen a place of peace and order he saw the animals running away from one another he knew that something has went wrong praise the lord but you see he never got home and says man you blew it today praise the lord you are in big trouble glory be to god i believe he got home and saw her all all mess up in blood and just went and embraced embrace her to his heart there was no second thought praise the lord amen why because he was still standing in perfection he took the place of his wife he did not judge her but when he fell he said the woman you gave me praise the lord so you know where you standing brother when you blame your wife when you are ready to identify yourself then you're going back to your original state when you start to cast blame then you're just falling from grace oh my goodness oh praise the lord are we together that was a beautiful thought that crossed my mind during the week i said oh man i've not seen that i've now seen there praise the lord the very woman that he stood for that he was willing to give give up everything that god has given him to identify himself with her now realizing that when he do that he will fall from grace and when he fell from grace he could no longer stand up for her he said it's the woman that you gave me are we together now why did why why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that imperfection why didn't he then he would have never been able to express his fullness so it was all about expressing himself why god don't always keep you in good health why he don't always keep you on fire and on top of the mountain because he will not be able to express himself you will come up to be a crippled son of god or a crippled daughter of god because you only have one idea on god and that is the thing that is killing the church today because the people have only they have a crippled idea of god they always think it's a god that must bless them prosperity amen and all know that god used the wheels of trials to build character into you because that's what he wants the church has been so crippled today because of this kind of a teachings praise the lord we have turned the church to casinos nobody go to a casino to lose their money when they leave their house to gamble in their mind they are thinking when i'm coming back i'm buying the newest tesla now what are they thinking in your mind if a person was not thinking like that they will not take their house savings so go gamble with hate and that's why people want to make the church is they want to the thing is it's a gambling place why didn't he just kept adam and eve like that he would have never been able to express himself his full attribute he he could be a father there that's true but also he's a savior and for them to be saved they have to be lost because he had the attribute in him he's a healer if they were kept in perfection where they never got sick they would never be able to experience healing praise the lord i will tell you that i will tell you by the grace of god by the grace of god i've always been a kind of a uh adventurous person and i think one place that the grace of god helps because not many people are called to do that if you really has not got a tinkies man filter that is given to you by the holy ghost don't read some of the materials that are out there [Music] amen you have to get a thinking man fitter i've always been an adventurous person i like i like looking into things but you will realize that they have that there have not been the grace of many men that will be able to see this the reason why god allowed the fall many of the teachers out there blame they just blame adam and eve and never can come to the understanding why a holy god will sit back and allow his creature to fall you won't find it out there so easily that's the reason why better balance is making us so understand this was a mystery it was a secret that god had in the back of his mind praise the lord [Music] because if net we will not look at our fault we will want to blame adam and eve for our present day sin if they were not coming to sin we are not going to be doing all of this adam they were living perfect they're supposed to obey god's word then we now will not come to be suffering a way of escape always looking for somebody to blame we can never hold ourselves accountable for our fighting failures [Music] but this was god's mystery praise the lord he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it on a true christ how could how could he be a son only true christ how could he be a healer only through christ see all things i wind up aim thou one person praise the lord amen so god one of everything that he heard that his deep mystery deep attributes that was in him now he was able to get the man christ the second was to be able to get an eve he was able to get a man that can represent adam the second noun is to be able to get an eve praise the lord amen glory be to god glory be to god and you know what save eve when god came down the thing that saved eve was a seed it was a seed that saved eve first lord because in hers now she had a seed of a man that was made in the image of god it's not because she was there in eating with adam praise the lord it's not because she could call her i i mean herself his wife if eve did not hide a seed if she was only carrying the serpent seed she would have had no place before god you know why god didn't wept you long time ago praise the lord you know why god did not just flush our lives allow us to die in situations when we came so close to death is because somewhere in there there was a seed of god oh praise the lord thank you jesus [Music] oh my somewhere in there there was a seed of god that god was not depending on the ability of your parents or depending on the ability of the school that you would go to he was depending on the ability of his word that would be able to grab that seed and bring it to life he didn't care what family you were born in [Music] he knew that his word has the magnetarian power to be able to draw that seed to bring you to life for you to be a son of god or the daughter of god praise the lord never think is because of your ability because no man has such god praise the lord is god that is rich in mercy it was a seed that saved her because she was carrying a seed and that's the reason why when god came down he told the serpent he said the seed of the woman the seed of the woman will bruise your head praise the lord it's because of that seed that we are here this morning is because of a seed the time says i have one minute to finish what can i do in one minute let me remove this necktie glory be to god i gotta run down the eye people you love the lord this morning oh praise the lord what almighty god we serve [Music] what almighty god we serve bless you lord jesus in all of this is happening under his voice honor the voice of god of every age that voice went out to look for the predestinated seed the voice of god in every age went out and hunted for the predestinated seed praise the lord amen some came by friendship some came by whatever way but the voice of god was able to hunt us in now you think about it if god if god could be so mindful so gracious what kind of appreciation are we bringing to him what a way to appreciate the grace that god has given to us to live a self selfish life it's not a way to appreciate god's grace to ever think in your mind that you are better than someone else is never the way to appreciate this grace of god praise the lord when i heard of the musicians playing and and and and uh and the song leader opening the service with i'm a mess that he loved me i just couldn't help my whole my head over my study i just got to lift up my hands and say lord that's how i feel this morning i'm amazed that you love me praise the lord so that was the second second for purpose there and the god getting the bride getting again the second adam detered and the tear to restore the kingdom to his right position that fell by sin unbelief by the first adam back to work he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them praise the lord but the threefold purpose of of god great mystery revealed god manifested in christ amen christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the tour the original condition again so you see it's all that god wants he put into christ and all that christ was he pulled into his church why to go back to eden condition amen praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why like i've said before this scripture has always been uh a misunderstood i have to find a place to stop him uh just just forgive me praise the lord amen oh my goodness man i just have to find a place to stop here hallelujah you love the lord that's first john chapter four first john chapter four let's just read the first john chapter four verse one i have to find a place to close it i was actually going to go into the rapture message and talk about the three the three order the rapture the voice shouting and and trauma of god and all that but we'll find time to do it amen but what i want to encourage you on this morning if the voice of god in in his ethnic ministry could bring an end to a religious system that's what the voice of god wants to do to you amen amen they want to bring an end to every playing church in plain religion the voice of god wants to open the curtain for you to be able to go in and have fellowship with god praise the lord not resting on the arm of church membership the voice of god want to bring a resurrection the quickening of the word in you amen it's also one to george you remember we were reading there in john chapter chapter 16 where we were talking about jesus said uh when he said uh you be george because you believe ned he talks about jesus there with the same three things there uh in in in in john chapter 16. now so uh and that's what the voice of god in this age wants to do to the believer they want to bring an end of religion they want to open the veil and be able to take us into the presence of god amen the voice of god want to bring an earthquake that everything of god that is that is not of god everything that is not of god that is hanging on you will fall off praise the lord when an earthquake comes everything that is hanging falls all the picture falls off the wall so the voice of god wants shake everything around you that is not of god let me tell you the only thing that is going to stain is his word now your age now your wealth not your degree either and the voice of god want to bring a resurrection in you amen a quickening in you john says this let me let me close this let me not be tempted john says this first john chapter 4 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world praise the lord yeah by knowing the spirit of god every spirit that confess that jesus is come in the flesh is of god now you see many people take this and the way they understand it is god became flesh but that's not what the bible says the bible did not say that every spirit that confessed god god coming in the flesh is different from jesus may flesh are we together oh is my strip is my bible reading something different amen yeah i know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confessed that jesus christ is come in the flesh when god came in the flesh he was called jesus christ praise the lord when god came in flesh he was called jesus christ but what john is talking about here you have to remember that john was the one that wrote the book of revelation and he saw jesus in the midst of the seven goalie candlestick he never saw god he saw jesus in the midst of the goal in seven golden kindness sake praise the lord so this is christ in bright form this is the this is the the the second four purpose every spirit that confess christ praise the lord because when this scripture is preached on a denominational system you know what they do they point you to the past that god came in flesh in nazareth but john was not talking about the past he was talking about the future what is happening in our age because this is the age where christ has come in flesh dwelling in the bride god bless you let's stay together musicians you can come you deserve the glory [Music] thank you jesus oh let just worship him now let us appreciate him
