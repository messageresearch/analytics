[54:10] seat thank you musicians that will be
[54:13] all for the music
[54:16] and before we go into what we want to
[54:19] speak on this morning as we would trust
[54:22] the Lord to help us uh uh I have a short
[54:26] uh
[54:26] video that I want to share with you you
[54:30] know I've been I've been picking things
[54:32] on on design uh so uh if the if they
[54:38] would just switch this light off and and
[54:41] share their video with with us
[54:44] uh this morning it's just it's just few
[54:47] few minutes
[54:49] and then we can go into what we want to
[54:52] talk talk about this morning
[55:36] open your eyes and let the world in
[55:39] follow me on a journey into your body's
[55:42] second most complex organ after the
[55:44] brain but pay attention now all of this
[55:47] will happen in the blink of an eye
[55:50] first job at hand get inside let's
[55:53] follow this dust particle it floats up
[55:55] and lands on the cornea that's the outer
[55:58] Dome covering your eye you can feel its
[56:00] shape right now close your Lids put your
[56:03] index finger over them wash your hands
[56:05] first and move your eyes side to side
[56:08] feel that bump that's it no blood
[56:12] vessels here your corneas get oxygen
[56:14] directly from the air so your eyes
[56:16] breathe but it's full of super sensitive
[56:19] nerves they sense something foreign and
[56:22] the fastest muscles in your body get to
[56:24] work your eye blinks that dust particle
[56:27] gets washed away
[56:29] let's try this again
[56:31] the only way to get into the eye is with
[56:33] light that's how your Vision Works and
[56:36] it's why you can't see in the dark duh
[56:39] but how do we see objects that don't
[56:41] emit light themselves the light coming
[56:44] from the source be it a light bulb or
[56:46] the Sun hits the object some of it gets
[56:49] absorbed and some of it bounces off and
[56:52] enters our eye it's a nice reflection on
[56:54] you more on that a bit later for now
[56:58] it's way too dark in this room somebody
[57:00] flip a switch Ah that's better we Zoom
[57:03] along going the speed of light and pass
[57:06] through the cornea it Dome shape to help
[57:08] focus light where it goes next the lens
[57:11] but before we get there we pass through
[57:14] the pupil it's not a black circle in
[57:16] your eyeball it's a hole black because
[57:19] there's no light inside your eye red eye
[57:22] and flash photos is because the light
[57:24] from the camera is passing through and
[57:26] bouncing off the back of your eye it's
[57:28] full of blood vessels in there so your
[57:30] pupils glow red but this pupil is too
[57:34] small I can barely squeeze through oh
[57:37] the light's too bright the tiny muscles
[57:39] in your irises that's the color part of
[57:41] your eye we know and Admire have relaxed
[57:44] to make the pupil smaller this doesn't
[57:46] let too much light in and protect your
[57:48] eyes from excessive brightness
[57:51] turn the lights down a little and the
[57:53] iris muscles contract the pupil gets
[57:56] bigger as the eye demands more light to
[57:58] be let through there we go we pass
[58:01] through and come upon the aspirin-sized
[58:03] lens
[58:04] like your ears and nose your lens
[58:07] continues to grow throughout your whole
[58:09] life and just like in a camera it
[58:11] focuses the light even more that way it
[58:14] hits exactly where it needs to be on the
[58:17] retina that's the back of the eye I can
[58:20] see our human here is nearsighted things
[58:22] far away are blurry look at where the
[58:25] lens is focusing the light into a single
[58:27] point it's not on the retina but a
[58:30] little before it this happens when your
[58:32] eye is slightly too long if you're
[58:34] far-sighted things up close are blurry
[58:36] that focal point goes behind the eye
[58:39] because your eyeball is too short don't
[58:41] worry it's nothing a pair of glasses
[58:44] can't fix
[58:45] oh it's roomy in here that I thought
[58:47] hello hello
[58:51] well it's because you only see about 1 6
[58:53] of your eye when you look in the mirror
[58:55] the rest of it is inside your head your
[58:58] eyes themselves are about the size of
[59:00] ping pong balls and just within this
[59:03] seemingly small little organ there are
[59:05] over two million working parts well hold
[59:09] on everything's shifting to the right
[59:10] whoa now to the left our human must be
[59:14] looking for something your eyes move
[59:16] thanks to six muscles holding them in
[59:18] the socket certain ones contract and
[59:20] your glance changes Direction up down
[59:23] left right all around okay things have
[59:27] calmed down so let's continue following
[59:29] the light projection say you're looking
[59:31] at a big bright Apple sitting on a blue
[59:34] table a yellow light bulb hangs above if
[59:37] you could see the image in here it'd be
[59:39] upside down on the back screen of your
[59:41] eye it's because the lens bent the beam
[59:44] but you can't see this picture on the
[59:46] retina because eyes aren't projectors
[59:48] it's just light hitting some tissue on
[59:51] the back wall of your eyeball there are
[59:53] nerves and special receptors back there
[59:55] they turn the light coming into your eye
[59:58] into nerve impulses the brain then
[1:00:00] decodes and makes sense of so we journey
[1:00:03] further here are those receptors they
[1:00:06] can be cones or rods cones are the
[1:00:09] reason your incredible eye can detect up
[1:00:11] to 7 million colors surprisingly though
[1:00:14] your cones come in only three types red
[1:00:17] green and blue it's the combination of
[1:00:20] their work that allows you to see
[1:00:21] magenta chartreuse or cyan except for
[1:00:25] colorblind people they might be missing
[1:00:27] one of those types or they don't work as
[1:00:29] they should so these people don't see
[1:00:31] certain colors at all or things aren't
[1:00:34] true to their color for example if
[1:00:36] there's something wrong with your green
[1:00:38] sensitive cones green and yellow look
[1:00:40] reddish brown
[1:00:42] there are also your rods they pick up
[1:00:45] black white and over 500 Shades of Gray
[1:00:47] in between way more than 50 Shades of
[1:00:50] Gray you also have more of them than
[1:00:52] cones and the rods are mostly in charge
[1:00:55] of your peripherals yep everything
[1:00:58] outside your direct field of vision
[1:00:59] looks like old black and white TV rods
[1:01:03] also help you see in low light
[1:01:05] the photoreceptors in your eyes are so
[1:01:08] sensitive they can even project an image
[1:01:10] when it's not even there ever looked at
[1:01:12] a bright light closed your eyes or turn
[1:01:15] off the light and you can still see the
[1:01:17] shape of that light bulb floating before
[1:01:19] your eyes that's your photoreceptors
[1:01:21] continuing to send visual information to
[1:01:24] your brain
[1:01:25] your rods and cones are connected to
[1:01:27] neurons so the data gets passed there
[1:01:30] and makes its way to your optic nerve
[1:01:32] this is where blood vessels and the main
[1:01:35] path to the brain enter and exit the
[1:01:37] eyeball this is also where your blind
[1:01:39] spot is there are no rods or cones here
[1:01:42] you can test it too grab a piece of
[1:01:45] paper in a pen I'll wait okay make a DOT
[1:01:49] on the left side
[1:01:52] praise the Lord
[1:01:59] it's going to use the allies of bit to
[1:02:01] get your attention this morning
[1:02:03] and
[1:02:07] Jesus said I read some few things here
[1:02:10] before we we get into what we want to
[1:02:13] deal with this morning
[1:02:16] and that is just uh
[1:02:20] uh a science report
[1:02:22] a little bit of of
[1:02:25] the second
[1:02:27] the second most
[1:02:32] uh
[1:02:34] complicated part of our body
[1:02:41] over in Matthew chapter 13.
[1:02:45] over in Matthew chapter 13.
[1:02:48] Jesus after dealing with The Parables of
[1:02:52] the Soul
[1:02:55] he
[1:03:03] he said these words
[1:03:14] Matthew 13 verse 13 therefore I speak to
[1:03:17] them in Parables because
[1:03:20] they're seeing seeing that and hearing
[1:03:23] the year net
[1:03:25] neither do they understand
[1:03:28] for in them
[1:03:30] is fulfill the prophesied of his eyes
[1:03:33] which said by hearing years a year and
[1:03:38] shall not understand and seeing here
[1:03:42] shall I see and shall not perceive
[1:03:46] for this people heart his Works grows
[1:03:49] and their ears are thought of hearing
[1:03:52] and their eyes
[1:03:54] they have clothes least at any time they
[1:03:59] should see with your eyes and year with
[1:04:02] their ears and you understand with your
[1:04:06] heart and she'll be converted and as you
[1:04:10] heal them
[1:04:11] but blessed are your eyes
[1:04:14] for they see
[1:04:17] in your ears for the year if you have
[1:04:21] followed that documentary a little bit
[1:04:23] you will realize that your ears are
[1:04:26] given to you for balance
[1:04:30] it helps to balance you
[1:04:32] or as you will be leaning on one side as
[1:04:35] small as they are they stick on your
[1:04:37] head they are given to you to keep your
[1:04:40] body imbalance
[1:04:43] praise the Lord
[1:04:45] so Jesus said but but blessed are your
[1:04:48] eyes for the sea
[1:04:51] in your ears for the year for verily I
[1:04:54] said unto you there are many prophets
[1:04:58] and righteous men
[1:05:00] have desire to see
[1:05:03] those things which yes it
[1:05:07] praise the Lord let's stand on our feet
[1:05:10] Genesis chapter 15.
[1:05:13] we trust the Lord to be able to help us
[1:05:15] this morning I will come back to death
[1:05:18] I will come back to that
[1:05:30] to show how the the eyes is very
[1:05:34] important we are living in a word
[1:05:37] uh never at time were pictures
[1:05:43] you have
[1:05:45] cameras everywhere I mean people
[1:05:48] are so smart that they're listening they
[1:05:51] are able to grab it on their phone
[1:05:54] and uh
[1:05:57] and all of those things they all looks
[1:06:00] like uh you know
[1:06:03] technology age and the advancing of
[1:06:05] Technology but all is signaling to us is
[1:06:09] to show how our eyes are important
[1:06:15] praise the Lord
[1:06:17] but yet we don't we don't uh
[1:06:20] realize it and uh
[1:06:25] well let's read Genesis 15 that's where
[1:06:28] we read last week we are just going back
[1:06:31] uh again
[1:06:35] to look at this subject we've been
[1:06:37] dealing with after these things
[1:06:40] Genesis 14 where God uh chasing the neck
[1:06:44] met Abraham after those things the word
[1:06:48] of the Lord came unto Abraham in a
[1:06:52] vision
[1:06:53] the word of the Lord came unto Abraham
[1:06:56] in a vision we're dealing with the eyes
[1:06:59] this morning pay attention saying fear
[1:07:02] not Abraham
[1:07:04] I am
[1:07:06] the shade and the exceeding great reward
[1:07:13] and Abraham said Lord God what shall thy
[1:07:18] give me
[1:07:19] sin I go childish
[1:07:23] it looks like sea ice Vision they're all
[1:07:26] popping up all over the scripture now
[1:07:28] since we have looked at the eyes
[1:07:33] and Abraham said Lord God what shall
[1:07:36] thou give me sin I go childless
[1:07:39] in the Seal of my house is Eleazar of
[1:07:43] Damascus and Abraham said behold to mean
[1:07:48] they all have not given no seed and load
[1:07:52] one born in my house
[1:07:54] is manheared and behold the word of the
[1:07:56] Lord came unto him saying they shall not
[1:08:00] be done here but he that shall come
[1:08:03] forth out of thou own ball shall be than
[1:08:06] his and he brought him forth abroad and
[1:08:09] said look
[1:08:11] open your eyes look
[1:08:15] use your eyes look
[1:08:19] look now towards heaven
[1:08:23] and tell the Stars if thou be able to
[1:08:27] number them
[1:08:29] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[1:08:33] be let's pray together father we are so
[1:08:37] grateful Lord we are so grateful
[1:08:42] we wake up in the morning by your grace
[1:08:46] and our eyes comes open
[1:08:50] we are able to identify
[1:08:54] our dwelling we can come from the room
[1:08:56] we can do things
[1:08:58] and father all of these years Lord since
[1:09:01] we were birthing since we came to
[1:09:03] consciousness of saying we have used our
[1:09:06] eyes for different things Lord
[1:09:09] but
[1:09:10] do we really
[1:09:12] appreciate it do we really
[1:09:16] ow
[1:09:18] look at the designer
[1:09:21] and a great design
[1:09:23] that father you have given to us
[1:09:25] there's a place where in your word you
[1:09:27] said that I those eyes are the light of
[1:09:30] the body
[1:09:32] father I'm just trusting you this
[1:09:34] morning as we look into this subject
[1:09:37] father I pray that God you will just
[1:09:39] can't break your word now into our
[1:09:41] hearts Lord
[1:09:43] I pray to God you will take the burden
[1:09:46] the inspiration of my heart and minister
[1:09:50] to the needs of your children this
[1:09:52] morning we thank you we appreciate you
[1:09:55] father
[1:09:56] in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless
[1:10:01] you you may have your seat
[1:10:05] so we see dwelling on our subject of uh
[1:10:12] exceed in faith
[1:10:14] and see it in righteousness actually is
[1:10:17] exceeding righteousness Jesus said
[1:10:19] except your righteousness exceed the
[1:10:22] righteousness of the stripe and
[1:10:24] Pharisees
[1:10:25] you will know what
[1:10:27] into the kingdom of heaven so we've been
[1:10:30] looking at seating righteousness and
[1:10:31] looking at the different types that are
[1:10:35] in the scripture
[1:10:37] but before I go to there let me read a
[1:10:41] quote here from crisis reveal in his own
[1:10:44] world getting back on that uh
[1:10:47] subject of our video
[1:10:50] see down through the age we started off
[1:10:57] from the foundation
[1:10:59] from the first church age when the seed
[1:11:03] went in the ground
[1:11:05] the complete sea
[1:11:08] and it comes out through the feet Luther
[1:11:15] comes back out through Wesley
[1:11:19] then
[1:11:21] into Pentecost
[1:11:23] the tongue
[1:11:26] in the lips see now is
[1:11:30] the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. now
[1:11:34] what he's dealing here with is that if
[1:11:36] we want to take this back to the Bible
[1:11:38] you will realize that when God give
[1:11:41] Daniel that great vision that Daniel had
[1:11:47] actually he interpreted uh came
[1:11:50] Nebuchadnezzar dream of the great image
[1:11:54] now that image was representing the the
[1:11:58] gentai kingdom how God will deal with
[1:12:01] the Gentile Kingdom coming from the time
[1:12:03] of Babylon to our time which now we are
[1:12:07] in uh biblically we are under the Roman
[1:12:10] Empire
[1:12:13] that is represented by the Catholic
[1:12:15] church that is ruling the word whether
[1:12:17] you believe it or not is the truth
[1:12:19] praise the Lord
[1:12:21] amen so uh uh so their Vision that God
[1:12:25] gave Daniel you have to realize that God
[1:12:29] was giving Danny their Vision concerning
[1:12:32] the time of the end
[1:12:34] praise the Lord so
[1:12:38] you will see that
[1:12:41] the vision represented the the the
[1:12:45] political powers that that will mix with
[1:12:49] religious powers that will have ruled
[1:12:53] the Gentile Kingdom like I said even
[1:12:55] till our time
[1:12:57] so it came from the head of gold to the
[1:13:01] feet of clay and iron
[1:13:04] now so brother Branham took that in
[1:13:07] crisis reveal in his own word and says
[1:13:10] when God showed Daniel that Vision
[1:13:13] interpreting Nebuchadnezzar dream
[1:13:17] there was something also that was ended
[1:13:20] in a vision there was a rock that was
[1:13:23] caught out of the mountain
[1:13:25] and it smashed the image on the feet
[1:13:30] pray to praise the Lord amen
[1:13:34] and when he smashed the image on the
[1:13:36] feet a uh uh uh the image trauma the
[1:13:40] image failed so now brother Branham is
[1:13:43] making us to realize that after God
[1:13:47] struck that image on the feet he started
[1:13:51] now building a a a spiritual Kingdom now
[1:13:54] because it was hit on the feet he now
[1:13:57] started building from the feet up
[1:14:01] praise the Lord
[1:14:03] amen he started building from the feet
[1:14:05] up so that's what now he's he's now
[1:14:09] applying to the church ages the time of
[1:14:12] the Reformation what God was doing when
[1:14:15] God brought Luther to take those Theses
[1:14:18] over to the church there then uh you
[1:14:21] know call the people out of capitalism
[1:14:23] when God brought Westlake and he brought
[1:14:26] a Revival uh uh uh uh there in England
[1:14:29] and and Azusa Street the Pentecostal
[1:14:33] what was God doing
[1:14:34] all of this move of God that was taking
[1:14:37] place Through the Ages what was he doing
[1:14:39] he was rebuilding that image right but
[1:14:42] now it's a spiritual Kingdom
[1:14:46] are we together
[1:14:48] now so he's he's making us succeed in
[1:14:51] understand that uh right from the first
[1:14:54] church age which would be the time of
[1:14:56] Paul
[1:14:58] amen we should be the time of Paul where
[1:15:02] there was there was uh uh uh you know
[1:15:05] one of the the the greatest missionary
[1:15:07] work the spreading of the Gospel all of
[1:15:10] those uh Apostles in the All Saints in
[1:15:13] the book of us the Bible says that they
[1:15:16] saw what they have they laid it down at
[1:15:18] the Apostle Faith because God at that
[1:15:22] time was staring The House of the people
[1:15:24] to carry the gospel around the word amen
[1:15:27] so that was a great missionary age we we
[1:15:30] can see that they were they were there
[1:15:32] in the feet now so he he's bringing us
[1:15:36] to this place to realize now where we
[1:15:39] are where we are in our age and to be
[1:15:43] able to see the things that has been
[1:15:46] revealed to us the word that has been
[1:15:49] preached to us it is because we are in
[1:15:53] the eye age
[1:15:56] like the scripture who says the art of
[1:15:59] the Lord move your toe and fold
[1:16:01] throughout the Earth
[1:16:03] what was that God was raising up man His
[1:16:06] prophets Through the Ages
[1:16:11] like the Bible which says over there in
[1:16:13] in the book of First Samuel
[1:16:16] that in that time
[1:16:19] the word of God was precious
[1:16:24] because there was no prophet
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] in a time of the judges the Bible says
[1:16:33] every man did what was right in their
[1:16:36] eyes
[1:16:37] because there was no prophet
[1:16:41] are we together
[1:16:43] so he's making us to see here with God's
[1:16:46] promise
[1:16:47] of sinning in Malachi for behold I send
[1:16:51] you Elijah the prophet before the Great
[1:16:55] and the Dreadful dead of the law with
[1:16:57] that promise of God he's making us to
[1:17:00] understand yeah God is prop he have
[1:17:03] promised us to send a prophet back uh a
[1:17:08] prophetic Ministry so that prophetic
[1:17:11] Ministry now is once again going to be
[1:17:14] the eye of God
[1:17:16] yeah
[1:17:17] so he's making us to see that where we
[1:17:20] are now
[1:17:21] back in that I'm uh in that image of God
[1:17:25] we are in the high age
[1:17:27] then he will say the next thing after
[1:17:29] the eye is the brain the intelligence
[1:17:35] praise the Lord
[1:17:38] and if you follow that documentary
[1:17:40] that's what he said that the next
[1:17:42] complicated
[1:17:43] part of the body next to the brain is
[1:17:45] the eye
[1:17:49] hmm
[1:17:50] now so while uh
[1:17:53] he says here
[1:17:56] then to the Pentecostal uh uh the Tonk
[1:18:00] you know Birdman says that because
[1:18:02] that's that's what God did in the
[1:18:04] Pentecostal age he gave them the gifts
[1:18:06] of speaking in tongues they live see
[1:18:08] noun is the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4.
[1:18:13] and so forth and now there is nothing
[1:18:17] else left
[1:18:19] for it to come but him himself
[1:18:23] to step into that
[1:18:25] because there's the last thing there is
[1:18:29] the next is the intelligence
[1:18:34] and we have no intelligence of Our Own
[1:18:39] is his we have no sight of Our Own
[1:18:44] praise the Lord
[1:18:46] you see that's why Jesus could tell
[1:18:50] nicodemon says a Scarlet of the Lord and
[1:18:53] that unless you are born again you will
[1:18:57] not see the kingdom of heaven
[1:19:03] praise the Lord
[1:19:08] the next is the intelligence and we have
[1:19:10] no intelligence of our own is his we
[1:19:14] have no sight of our own how can a man
[1:19:18] foresee those things
[1:19:20] praise the Lord
[1:19:22] he can do it
[1:19:24] is God himself is is becoming to a place
[1:19:29] and and he's governed the body all the
[1:19:33] way true
[1:19:35] then the complete body of Christ is
[1:19:39] revealed in the form of a bride
[1:19:43] that was taken out of his side praise
[1:19:47] the Lord let's take another thought here
[1:19:50] from Exposition of the church AJ she
[1:19:53] says let me show you another reason why
[1:19:56] Satan hit this book that's Book of
[1:19:58] Revelation
[1:19:59] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:20:02] church he knows that Jesus is the same
[1:20:06] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:09] and he changed that he knows that a
[1:20:12] whole lot more than do 90 percent of the
[1:20:16] theologians he knows their sins God is
[1:20:20] immutable in his nature then he is just
[1:20:24] as immutable in his ways the Satan knows
[1:20:29] assured that the original church at
[1:20:33] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:20:36] in action is the true church that Jesus
[1:20:41] claimed as his own
[1:20:43] or else is false it has to be and
[1:20:48] remember this Christ in the truth church
[1:20:51] is the continuation of the book of Acts
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:57] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[1:21:01] that the Antichrist spirit will come
[1:21:04] into the church and defy it making it
[1:21:07] lukewarm former powerless a exposes
[1:21:10] Satan revealing his works
[1:21:15] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:21:19] and the discrediting of God's word Jesus
[1:21:24] said the enemy comes to Steed kill and
[1:21:28] destroy praise the Lord amen that's what
[1:21:32] Jesus says now brother bear is now
[1:21:35] bringing that that uh saying of Saint
[1:21:38] John 10 into context here the enemy
[1:21:41] comes to destroy
[1:21:43] or to discredit
[1:21:46] amen when the word is discredited it
[1:21:50] reduce its effect in our lives
[1:21:55] we think that it is no longer important
[1:21:58] again
[1:21:59] it was only an Old Testament thing
[1:22:02] praise the Lord amen he discredit now so
[1:22:09] let's read a little bit here
[1:22:14] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:22:16] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:22:20] down to the time
[1:22:22] he is cast into the Lake of Fire he's
[1:22:25] going to do it
[1:22:27] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:22:30] knows that if the people get the
[1:22:33] revelation
[1:22:35] of the truth church and what she stands
[1:22:39] for
[1:22:40] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:22:44] the Greater Works now as as we read that
[1:22:48] and and brother Branham is talking about
[1:22:50] the revelation of the true church and
[1:22:52] what she stands for I would go back to
[1:22:55] uh uh uh the tape the the marriage and
[1:22:58] divorce tip that was playing this
[1:23:00] morning and I will I will want us to pay
[1:23:03] attention to to as we go through that
[1:23:06] we've been we've been looking at the
[1:23:08] entire series
[1:23:09] you have to pay attention because
[1:23:11] brother Branham brings their subject
[1:23:15] with a lot of types
[1:23:18] amen you will see it as he was talking
[1:23:21] this morning he's making emphasis on the
[1:23:24] woman and he's bringing the church in
[1:23:28] now the danger there is that over the
[1:23:31] years we kept our mind on the physical
[1:23:34] woman
[1:23:36] and never understand that it was a
[1:23:38] message for the church
[1:23:41] praise the Lord so yeah he's saying if
[1:23:45] that if the church if if the church
[1:23:48] would get the Revelation for what she
[1:23:51] stands for
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] what she stands for
[1:23:58] so let's go back there let's read that
[1:24:00] again
[1:24:02] I just I just thought I should I should
[1:24:04] make an emphasis on that
[1:24:06] because sometimes it throws people off
[1:24:10] amen praise the Lord and and then you
[1:24:14] are hearing all of those things that
[1:24:16] brother Brandon was saying and it looks
[1:24:18] like uh uh uh uh and and if if if the
[1:24:22] devil can just get your mind on the
[1:24:25] physical woman you will never see the
[1:24:27] message that is coming to the church
[1:24:30] praise the Lord
[1:24:32] because what he's showing us there is
[1:24:34] that how did the devil break the
[1:24:38] continuity of God
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:43] because the same thing that happened in
[1:24:46] Eden is the same thing that is happening
[1:24:48] to the church today
[1:24:49] how come we have all of these
[1:24:51] denominations
[1:24:54] praise the Lord the more increasing that
[1:24:57] we have in churches the less we are
[1:24:59] seeing the Life of Christ
[1:25:01] and we're seeing all I mean all the
[1:25:04] scandals you can you can think about
[1:25:08] all the scandals from woman women
[1:25:10] filthiness everything in the church how
[1:25:13] did we go to this place why because that
[1:25:16] contributed from the book of Arts the
[1:25:19] church in power was broken
[1:25:21] is showing us immersion divorce the same
[1:25:25] way God the devil took Eve from the word
[1:25:28] to break the continuity of God that's
[1:25:31] the same way he took the church from the
[1:25:33] word that's why we don't see the effect
[1:25:35] of Christ we are just stuck with
[1:25:38] denomination in our mind
[1:25:42] so let's look at the word let's read
[1:25:45] between the line let's understand the
[1:25:47] types
[1:25:55] are we together
[1:26:02] he fights it the devil fights
[1:26:05] revelation
[1:26:08] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:26:11] people
[1:26:13] if the people if we the people
[1:26:18] can get the revelation of the true
[1:26:21] church
[1:26:22] and what she is
[1:26:25] what she stands for
[1:26:28] and that she can do the Greater Works
[1:26:32] praise the lord we will now say that
[1:26:34] base or Miracles it's past when I said
[1:26:37] it's only for the apostles
[1:26:40] because we know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:26:44] same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:50] are we together
[1:26:54] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:26:57] the Greater Works she will be an
[1:27:00] invincible Army
[1:27:02] if they
[1:27:05] get the true revelation of the two
[1:27:09] spirit
[1:27:11] within the framework
[1:27:14] of the Christian church
[1:27:16] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:27:20] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:27:22] will be powerless before her
[1:27:26] praise the Lord
[1:27:28] amen because that was that was that was
[1:27:31] where he fell she did not descended that
[1:27:36] but now
[1:27:38] we have been empowered by the word to
[1:27:41] wash the two spirits
[1:27:44] that is working not just following the
[1:27:46] sensation but bringing everything back
[1:27:49] to the world it must match with the word
[1:28:00] Satan will be powerless before her he
[1:28:03] will be
[1:28:10] miss my spot here now
[1:28:12] and by God's spirit discern and
[1:28:14] withstand the Antichrist spirit
[1:28:17] will be powerless before her he will be
[1:28:20] definitely strong today as when Christ
[1:28:23] was withstool his every effort to gain
[1:28:27] power over him in the desert yes Satan
[1:28:30] hits Revelation but we love it
[1:28:33] wave the true Revelation in our lives
[1:28:37] the gifts of hell what is the true
[1:28:40] Revelation in our life Christ in you
[1:28:44] the hope of glory
[1:28:47] praise the Lord
[1:28:50] it is that true Revelation Christ in you
[1:28:56] the hope of glory
[1:28:59] that's where we find Grace
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:04] to trust the Lord
[1:29:07] for the things that are beyond our reach
[1:29:09] yes Satan is there but we love it with
[1:29:12] true Revelation in our lives not in our
[1:29:16] head but in our lives
[1:29:18] the gifts of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:29:21] us but we will prevail we will prevail
[1:29:24] over them
[1:29:25] you will recall that I mentioned at the
[1:29:28] beginning of this message uh this uh and
[1:29:32] and in this book that we are studying is
[1:29:34] actually the revelation of Jesus himself
[1:29:37] in the church and his work
[1:29:41] in the future ages
[1:29:43] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:29:47] Spirit to give us Revelation or we will
[1:29:50] fail to get it
[1:29:52] bringing these two tasks together you
[1:29:56] will see that it won't take just
[1:29:58] ordinary steady and thinking to make
[1:30:02] this book real is going to take an
[1:30:05] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[1:30:08] this book can be revealed to anyone by a
[1:30:12] special class of people
[1:30:14] it will take one with prophetic insight
[1:30:20] now so we will go back to that image of
[1:30:23] the eyes that we just we just look at
[1:30:26] praise the Lord amen
[1:30:29] we you see things you know uh and how
[1:30:34] the colors come together you know you
[1:30:36] you just you know uh and and and and and
[1:30:39] how beautiful I just didn't want to take
[1:30:41] a lot of the time on on the documentary
[1:30:44] but uh it's very beautiful when you when
[1:30:46] you follow it you just you just said uh
[1:30:50] what an awesome God
[1:30:52] that we sell amen his great design
[1:30:56] that he would give us eyes to see
[1:31:00] praise the Lord
[1:31:01] amen
[1:31:03] now so uh and that is the same thing
[1:31:06] with God's word
[1:31:10] that's what I want for us to realize
[1:31:12] here because we are talking to everybody
[1:31:14] we are talking about Abraham sorry
[1:31:17] and uh looking at God promising him
[1:31:22] that I am your great and exceeding
[1:31:25] reward
[1:31:27] last week we look at how he went out
[1:31:30] there and and helped to redeem his
[1:31:32] brother a lot
[1:31:34] and after the king of Sodom was was
[1:31:36] thinking to reward him and Abraham said
[1:31:39] no I won't take anything
[1:31:41] and and he refused and right after that
[1:31:44] the Bible says after that after these
[1:31:47] things
[1:31:48] God appeared unto Abraham in a vision
[1:31:51] and says I am your great and you're
[1:31:54] exceeding
[1:31:56] reward
[1:31:57] I am your reward
[1:32:00] praise the Lord Hallelujah
[1:32:03] and Abraham is asking God and a lot
[1:32:06] seeing that I go challenge
[1:32:09] I have this promise of having a son
[1:32:13] amen but all around me not just my
[1:32:17] servants
[1:32:18] I love them they love me but they are
[1:32:21] not my sons they are not my children
[1:32:23] it's not one from me
[1:32:26] praise the Lord now so God now is going
[1:32:29] to ask Abraham how are you looking
[1:32:33] how are you looking what are you looking
[1:32:36] at
[1:32:37] yeah
[1:32:39] praise the Lord
[1:32:41] amen and the scripture said he brings
[1:32:44] Abraham outside and he said look at the
[1:32:46] heavens
[1:32:48] look at the heavens if you can Number
[1:32:51] the Stars up there
[1:32:53] my promise to you I'll make you a father
[1:32:57] of Nations
[1:33:02] praise the Lord
[1:33:14] sister Catherine if you go to mine
[1:33:20] my images
[1:33:26] that I wanted to
[1:33:29] for us to look at
[1:33:32] take the one that has
[1:33:34] resolving power
[1:33:37] resolving power
[1:33:49] now this this resolving power
[1:33:54] it is uh our eyes have the ability to do
[1:33:58] this
[1:34:00] but
[1:34:01] you can
[1:34:04] in great battle ever father bam talks
[1:34:07] about uh people that study the the Stars
[1:34:11] he says you can you can look get out
[1:34:14] look at the heavens look at the stash
[1:34:16] you know if you are not in a line of
[1:34:19] steady but what what this is is the
[1:34:21] other you might look at look at the
[1:34:24] heavens and you are looking at a setting
[1:34:26] star and uh maybe you take a telescope
[1:34:30] based on how expensive and how effective
[1:34:33] your telescope is
[1:34:35] you might look at a star and then uh it
[1:34:40] might look like won't start to you
[1:34:43] but then if you take a better telescope
[1:34:47] and then you look at that very same
[1:34:49] style you will realize that uh
[1:34:54] it's two different styles
[1:34:58] amen and uh uh the people that do their
[1:35:04] work you know they can be able to like
[1:35:07] but bam says you know they can be able
[1:35:09] to explain the zodiacs explain they have
[1:35:12] on their bodies to you if you are not in
[1:35:14] that line of working you don't have the
[1:35:16] right equipment you will not understand
[1:35:18] anything about it
[1:35:20] and you see God's promises in his word
[1:35:23] just like he did to Abraham
[1:35:26] his promises in his word are just like
[1:35:29] the stars in the heavens
[1:35:34] praise the Lord
[1:35:35] amen
[1:35:37] I mean try try to do it and you get out
[1:35:40] there and pretty soon you are counting
[1:35:42] and you don't know if you have counted
[1:35:44] this one
[1:35:45] oh man let me go back again
[1:35:50] and then pretty soon you lost
[1:35:52] you don't know which one you have
[1:35:54] counted and you can get the number right
[1:35:58] are we together
[1:36:00] praise the Lord
[1:36:02] so you see this it's uh it's it's just
[1:36:04] like that when you are looking into the
[1:36:06] word of God
[1:36:07] now there there are some things that we
[1:36:09] share with you on this revolving power
[1:36:11] but it will take me it would take me out
[1:36:13] of my my trench of top this morning so
[1:36:17] let's just let's just go back thank you
[1:36:19] thank you for that you can put the light
[1:36:20] back on
[1:36:22] and uh so you see that's that just how
[1:36:25] uh uh uh you know uh the the promises of
[1:36:29] God is now he gave Abraham this promise
[1:36:32] it was God that called Abraham Genesis
[1:36:34] chapter 12. I make thee a father of
[1:36:38] Nations now with that called you know
[1:36:41] the way we process things in our mind
[1:36:43] sometimes I I'm sure believe that
[1:36:46] Abraham thinks in no time that's why
[1:36:48] brother Brandon would will demonstrate
[1:36:50] that he went and shopping he got baby
[1:36:53] things he bought he bought all of those
[1:36:55] things because in his mind he thinking
[1:36:58] that you know God is going to do this
[1:37:00] thing but how many years is talked 25
[1:37:02] years
[1:37:05] praise the Lord
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:08] but God's word
[1:37:10] will stay true like the very day he said
[1:37:14] it to Abraham
[1:37:18] praise the Lord the promise he made to
[1:37:21] Abraham was true from the very day he
[1:37:23] left out of the lips of God that word
[1:37:26] was truth
[1:37:27] and it still remain truth because God
[1:37:30] brought his word to pass
[1:37:33] but here God is going to uh make Abraham
[1:37:37] to realize what are you looking at are
[1:37:41] you looking at your physical body you're
[1:37:43] looking at your age are you looking at
[1:37:45] your strength or are you looking at my
[1:37:48] promise
[1:37:51] praise the Lord why he made Abraham to
[1:37:54] look at the stars
[1:37:55] and so tell Abraham the same word that I
[1:37:59] spoke to you about a promise is the same
[1:38:02] word that created those ties
[1:38:04] I spoke those Stars into existence
[1:38:08] the same way I spoke to you concerning a
[1:38:11] son

[1:38:20] that's the same word my word is hanging
[1:38:23] my promise over you
[1:38:24] no matter what your body goes through
[1:38:26] while your mind goes through the word of
[1:38:29] God will come to pass because God said
[1:38:32] so

[1:41:46] that I've come to destroy the Lord or
[1:41:49] the prophets are not come to destroy but
[1:41:51] to fulfill
[1:41:52] for verily I said unto you till Heaven
[1:41:55] is passed now one jot
[1:41:58] it means that uh
[1:42:00] a yuck in the in the Hebrew is a York
[1:42:03] so it is just this apostrophe that is
[1:42:07] that is attached to that word
[1:42:09] and and also at tether also it's an
[1:42:12] apostrophe it means just like I said in
[1:42:15] the English we would say the crossing of
[1:42:18] the eye the crossing of a t and the
[1:42:20] dotting of the eye
[1:42:22] amen God is saying not one Crossing of a
[1:42:26] t
[1:42:27] or the dotting of the eye
[1:42:30] in my word is going to
[1:42:33] to fill
[1:42:35] amen I'm going to cross every T and Dot
[1:42:40] every eye
[1:42:41] that concerns your life
[1:42:46] praise the Lord
[1:42:48] you will you will appreciate this
[1:42:50] when you go in a scripture where Jesus
[1:42:53] was telling the the Pharisees asked him
[1:42:57] and said
[1:42:58] when David said this who was he talking
[1:43:01] about
[1:43:02] my law said unto my Lord
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:07] the answer that Jesus gave them and the
[1:43:11] Bible says the the Pharisees never said
[1:43:14] a word to him the word he used won't
[1:43:17] change it was a York
[1:43:20] it was just under pressure
[1:43:26] and when and when Jesus used that they
[1:43:30] honest to immediately
[1:43:32] that the son of David was going to be
[1:43:35] the Messiah
[1:43:40] praise the Lord
[1:43:42] so you see every part of God's word
[1:43:50] it's a complete design
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] it's a complete design every story in
[1:43:58] the Bible
[1:44:02] is from the great mind of God
[1:44:07] so Jesus saying the other you know every
[1:44:12] every portion of God's world will be
[1:44:14] fulfilled
[1:44:18] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[1:44:21] the least of the commandment and shall
[1:44:23] teach men so he shall be called the
[1:44:26] lease in the Kingdom of Heaven but
[1:44:28] whosoever shall do and teach men the
[1:44:31] same Shall be Called great in the
[1:44:33] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:44:34] for I say it unto you that accept your
[1:44:39] righteousness shall exceed that was
[1:44:42] where this whole subject began now since
[1:44:45] the month we've been dwelling on it
[1:44:47] except your righteousness and see the
[1:44:50] righteousness of the stripe and the
[1:44:52] Pharisees yesha in no case enter into
[1:44:56] the kingdom of heaven so we've been
[1:44:58] looking at exceeding righteousness now
[1:45:01] you will you will you will appreciate
[1:45:04] the context of that when you when we
[1:45:06] look into the scripture and you realize
[1:45:09] that it is not only righteousness that
[1:45:13] God have expressed uh that sense of
[1:45:16] exceeding righteousness but you will see
[1:45:18] that God talks about the exceeding of
[1:45:22] Grace he talks about the exceeding of
[1:45:26] Faith he talks about the exceeding of
[1:45:29] power now first Timothy chapter one like
[1:45:32] I said let's look at that
[1:45:48] because what there what did God tell
[1:45:50] Abraham years I am your great
[1:45:53] and exceeding
[1:45:55] reward
[1:45:58] amen
[1:45:59] and he's the one Abraham is the one that
[1:46:02] God impute righteousness to
[1:46:07] praise the Lord so we realize here that
[1:46:10] this exceeding righteousness is what God
[1:46:13] rewarded Our Father Abraham wave
[1:46:20] and if God rewarded Our Father Abraham
[1:46:23] with a seed in righteousness is now
[1:46:25] something that is going to be difficult
[1:46:27] for him to do for you and myself
[1:46:29] that righteousness is not after our
[1:46:32] works and how good we are now
[1:46:37] because our Father Abraham was in Eden
[1:46:43] First Timothy chapter one
[1:46:55] let's read from verse 12. he says I
[1:46:58] thank Christ Jesus our lord who have
[1:47:01] enabled me
[1:47:02] for that he counted me faithful
[1:47:06] put him in into the ministry
[1:47:09] praise the Lord
[1:47:11] look at the background of this Paul was
[1:47:13] from the trap of Benjamin
[1:47:16] I call him to the Leviticus Lord he
[1:47:19] could never be a priest
[1:47:23] because the priest was from the tribe of
[1:47:26] Levi
[1:47:28] are we together
[1:47:30] amen
[1:47:32] so Paul yeah now he's after his
[1:47:35] experience on the road of Damascus
[1:47:39] he's looking into the word and he's
[1:47:42] seeing all of these things you know he's
[1:47:44] the one talking about uh uh melchized
[1:47:47] there in Hebrew and he's you know the
[1:47:49] Lord is dealing with him opening his
[1:47:51] eyes to the things that align in the
[1:47:53] Lord
[1:47:54] and he's being grateful
[1:47:57] amen
[1:48:02] who have come to me
[1:48:04] or enable me that I encountered to be
[1:48:07] faithful putting me into the ministry
[1:48:10] for who was before
[1:48:15] a blasphemer a persecutor
[1:48:18] amen Paul now talking about himself now
[1:48:20] I persecute the church
[1:48:23] I blasphemed this very thing that I'm
[1:48:25] that I'm that I'm I'm preaching to you
[1:48:30] praise the Lord
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] amen but our team Mercy
[1:48:37] because I did it ignorantly in unbelief
[1:48:42] and the grace of our Lord was exceeding
[1:48:48] abundant
[1:48:50] with faith and love
[1:48:53] which is in Christ Jesus
[1:48:58] praise the Lord
[1:49:00] now there is the same exceeding except
[1:49:04] your righteousness exceed the
[1:49:06] righteousness of the strap in Pharisees
[1:49:08] can you imagine all the people there on
[1:49:12] the mountain listening to Jesus when
[1:49:14] when these men they have they have they
[1:49:16] have great regard and respect for them
[1:49:19] in the way they dress and the way they
[1:49:21] conduct themselves you know being
[1:49:23] they've been taught the law since the
[1:49:25] age of 12 and and uh and in your mind
[1:49:28] they're thinking
[1:49:30] whoa righteousness can they see these
[1:49:32] people these are the men that we know to
[1:49:34] be righteous men
[1:49:36] praise the Lord but we realize that
[1:49:39] Jesus was talking about something that
[1:49:42] that God was going to put upon the
[1:49:44] church he was going apart upon the ones
[1:49:47] that were now walking
[1:49:49] amen the ones that were not good he was
[1:49:52] going to he was going to take us down
[1:49:54] from our law state and bring us into the
[1:49:58] boson of the father
[1:50:00] praise the Lord
[1:50:01] now Paul is expressing the same year I
[1:50:05] persecute this very thing
[1:50:08] I was up I was I I've blasphemed the
[1:50:11] name of the Lord Jesus because because
[1:50:13] of thy name that was the thing that
[1:50:15] passed through the games
[1:50:17] who is this man Jesus
[1:50:20] because of that he persecuted the church
[1:50:22] but yet he's realizing that God was
[1:50:26] exceedingly abundantly in Grace love and
[1:50:30] faith to him
[1:50:34] second Thessalonians chapter 1.
[1:50:57] realizing the way that God there with
[1:50:59] the Apostle Paul he was grateful
[1:51:03] praise the Lord
[1:51:05] he was very grateful
[1:51:07] for the many things that he did
[1:51:09] experience
[1:51:14] second Thessalonians chapter one
[1:51:18] verse 2 Grace unto you and peace from
[1:51:22] our Our God peace from God our Father
[1:51:25] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:29] we are bound to thank God always for you
[1:51:34] brethrens as it is meat because of your
[1:51:39] faith
[1:51:40] because that's your faith sorry because
[1:51:43] that your faith growth exceedingly
[1:51:47] and the charity of every one of you
[1:51:53] All To Us each other abundant abundant
[1:51:58] praise the Lord so here also Paul is
[1:52:01] expressing
[1:52:04] Faith That Glory exceedingly
[1:52:08] praise the Lord
[1:52:10] you see because this word holds a
[1:52:14] whole's uh a meaning you have to realize
[1:52:16] that the translation is from Greek to
[1:52:19] English
[1:52:20] and this word is the same word where we
[1:52:24] get
[1:52:24] our word supermarket
[1:52:28] or sometimes they will say a hypermarket
[1:52:33] that word exceedingly
[1:52:37] praise the Lord
[1:52:40] let's take Ephesians chapter one also
[1:53:04] Ephesians chapter 1
[1:53:13] let's read from verse 17.
[1:53:16] they are the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:53:19] Christ the father of Glory
[1:53:22] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:53:25] in Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:53:28] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:53:30] enlightened they are yea may know what
[1:53:33] is the hope of his calling what is the
[1:53:36] riches of his glory all the inheritance
[1:53:40] in the sins and what is the exceeding
[1:53:45] greatness
[1:53:46] of his power
[1:53:49] to us word who believe
[1:53:52] praise the Lord now so Paul is is
[1:53:56] talking here also almost like God
[1:53:59] telling Abraham come and look at the
[1:54:01] stars he's saying that God will
[1:54:05] Enlighten your eyes of understanding
[1:54:07] so you can be able to see that there is
[1:54:11] an exceeding power
[1:54:13] now the thing that will walk through you
[1:54:16] will not be your effort
[1:54:21] but God needs to open your understanding
[1:54:24] to that or else you will just be
[1:54:26] struggling to make things happen
[1:54:31] so what are you looking at
[1:54:35] what are you looking at Abraham
[1:54:39] Abraham counting his age I'm getting old
[1:54:42] I don't have no child what are you
[1:54:45] looking at
[1:54:47] God says okay come on come outside come
[1:54:49] come
[1:54:50] look at the heavens
[1:54:53] praise the Lord
[1:54:54] amen
[1:54:59] amen let's take one more year Romans
[1:55:02] Romans chapter
[1:55:04] 8.
[1:55:06] let's take one more year we'll find a
[1:55:08] place to
[1:55:09] to close this thing
[1:55:21] so we see we realize that the same God
[1:55:24] that that uh that uh
[1:55:27] that that that
[1:55:30] produce the exceeding righteousness is
[1:55:34] the same God that is going to bring uh
[1:55:37] exceeding Faith to the church this is
[1:55:39] the same God that is going to bring
[1:55:40] exceeding power to the church this is
[1:55:43] the same God that has given us exceeding
[1:55:46] Grace
[1:55:48] to be able to live in the hour and the
[1:55:51] day that we are living in he is a God
[1:55:53] that gave us exceeding strength he says
[1:55:56] Abraham I am your great and you are
[1:56:00] exceeding reward
[1:56:03] I'm going to bless you with things that
[1:56:06] will overpass your strength is going to
[1:56:08] overpass your age it's going to overpass
[1:56:11] your ability
[1:56:17] what are you looking at
[1:56:27] praise the Lord
[1:56:34] Romans chapter 8.
[1:56:58] this wonderful wonderful
[1:57:01] book of Paul year
[1:57:07] let's read from verse 31.
[1:57:10] so hard to find where to stand because
[1:57:12] everything is good
[1:57:16] what shall we say then
[1:57:18] what shall we say what shall we then say
[1:57:21] to these things if God be for us who can
[1:57:24] be against us
[1:57:27] he that spare near his own son but
[1:57:30] deliver him up
[1:57:32] for us all
[1:57:34] how shall he met with him also freely
[1:57:38] gave us all things
[1:57:43] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:57:46] God's elect
[1:57:48] praise the Lord
[1:57:50] who is the man
[1:57:52] that is able to condemn
[1:57:55] praise the Lord what right do you have
[1:57:59] what do what do you know about this
[1:58:01] person
[1:58:03] praise the Lord
[1:58:05] amen the app that you see the person is
[1:58:08] not all about their life
[1:58:15] are we together
[1:58:17] who shall LED anything to the Church of
[1:58:20] God's elect
[1:58:21] it is God that justify it
[1:58:26] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:58:28] that died
[1:58:30] yeah rather that is Raising again who is
[1:58:34] even at the right hand of God who also
[1:58:38] make an intercession for us
[1:58:42] who shall separate us
[1:58:45] from the love of Christ
[1:58:47] praise the Lord who shall separate us I
[1:58:51] love this I love this I've I've Loved
[1:58:54] this from
[1:58:57] from the time that God started opening
[1:58:59] my eyes to understand the scripture uh
[1:59:02] many years back I have loved this
[1:59:05] because there has really been comforting
[1:59:07] to me that Paul who says who shall
[1:59:10] separate us then he says shall
[1:59:12] tribulation shall distress
[1:59:16] praise the Lord
[1:59:19] Hallelujah
[1:59:21] you understand what I'm good now
[1:59:24] amen
[1:59:25] because if it was just our trials and
[1:59:29] our trouble
[1:59:31] the right way to phrase it is what shall
[1:59:34] separate us
[1:59:37] but the Apostle Paul want us to realize
[1:59:40] and identify that there is a personality
[1:59:42] behind whatever we are dealing with
[1:59:46] it's a sickness whether it is financial
[1:59:49] problem who is the one is the cause of
[1:59:51] that
[1:59:53] who shall separate us shall tribulation
[1:59:56] distress persecution farming making this
[2:00:00] prepared or swamp as it is reaching for
[2:00:03] that sake we are killed all day long we
[2:00:07] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[2:00:10] made in all these things
[2:00:14] we are more than conquerors
[2:00:19] praise the lord we are more than
[2:00:23] conquerors through him that love us now
[2:00:27] do you do you see
[2:00:29] the word exceeding year
[2:00:31] Thy word more than conquerors
[2:00:37] praise the Lord
[2:00:39] amen
[2:00:41] be more than more than the Conqueror
[2:00:44] means that you did not conquer it
[2:00:48] you are only rejoicing in the victory
[2:00:52] amen you have been rewarded for the
[2:00:55] battle that you did not fight
[2:00:58] you are more than the Conqueror
[2:01:03] praise the Lord someone conquer it and
[2:01:06] then you you are giving the reward
[2:01:12] that's the exceeding righteousness
[2:01:16] amen you have been rewarded for
[2:01:19] accepting the righteous one
[2:01:22] not rewarded for your righteousness but
[2:01:25] you are rewarded because you have
[2:01:28] embraced the righteous one
[2:01:32] praise the Lord you can confess your
[2:01:35] weakness
[2:01:38] amen
[2:01:40] and then you can embrace the strong one
[2:01:44] you are more
[2:01:46] than conquerors
[2:01:50] praise the Lord
[2:01:52] are you grabbing the picture
[2:01:54] do you see why Jacob uh uh uh Judah has
[2:01:59] to say Tema is more righteous than me
[2:02:04] amen
[2:02:06] why he had to say that because Judah
[2:02:10] realized that she was looking to the
[2:02:12] promise she wanted to be identified
[2:02:15] in the lameness of Abraham
[2:02:19] praise the Lord
[2:02:21] he promised this young woman okay when
[2:02:23] my when my little boy get older you will
[2:02:25] marry him and he kept him away
[2:02:28] now let's think now this is a common
[2:02:30] common human mind well my first son died
[2:02:33] you didn't have a child the second one I
[2:02:35] don't know what's going on here
[2:02:37] praise the Lord
[2:02:39] amen
[2:02:40] and she's realizing the other I I don't
[2:02:44] know what is going on I mean the bodies
[2:02:45] of Ash now we should be married
[2:02:49] she said okay I'm not going to fight for
[2:02:52] him I'm going for the father himself
[2:02:55] praise the Lord
[2:02:57] I'm going for the father himself he will
[2:02:59] just set to the case
[2:03:02] glory be to God
[2:03:03] amen
[2:03:08] so it was not it was not the art of tema
[2:03:12] that Judah called righteousness
[2:03:16] it was the thought
[2:03:19] amen it was the desire that she had in
[2:03:22] her heart to be identified with this
[2:03:25] group of people
[2:03:28] praise the Lord it was not her eyes
[2:03:30] because the art was filthy the ad was
[2:03:33] wrong
[2:03:36] but the desire that she had
[2:03:39] of wanted or wanting to be counted in
[2:03:43] The Blessing of Abraham
[2:03:48] should I say she's more righteous than
[2:03:51] her
[2:03:52] amen
[2:03:55] he said what can I give you he said
[2:03:58] bring me in a cake she knew there was no
[2:04:00] kid around
[2:04:02] give me the god
[2:04:04] okay let me go and get okay now if you
[2:04:07] want to go and get it give me your staff
[2:04:09] give me your bracelets
[2:04:11] and as soon as he was gone she went away
[2:04:17] praise the Lord
[2:04:27] we are more than conquerors
[2:04:30] through him they love us
[2:04:34] praise the Lord
[2:04:35] you see many times when we when we read
[2:04:38] the word of God
[2:04:40] sometimes God is just expressing what is
[2:04:44] his desire
[2:04:46] what what he wants to achieve in our
[2:04:49] life
[2:04:49] he's telling us what he wants to achieve
[2:04:52] but we are receiving it as what he want
[2:04:56] us to do
[2:04:58] amen
[2:05:02] he's speaking to you when he says uh I I
[2:05:04] love you just that there in in Exodus
[2:05:07] chapter 19 he said I brought you out
[2:05:10] I brought you out uh on on Eagle wings
[2:05:14] amen speaking to Moses in the group if
[2:05:17] you will love me with all of your heart
[2:05:19] and keep all of my Commandments now God
[2:05:22] is expressing to them I I brought you
[2:05:26] out I want to keep you ass a treasure to
[2:05:30] me
[2:05:31] amen
[2:05:33] but the way they're understanding us if
[2:05:36] God is giving them a law then the Bible
[2:05:39] said they said all that the Lord has
[2:05:42] required we will do
[2:05:46] amen it depends on what you are looking
[2:05:50] at
[2:05:52] how are you listening what are you
[2:05:54] hearing when the word is preached
[2:05:59] are you hearing condemnation
[2:06:02] amen what are you hearing or are you
[2:06:05] hearing the voice of a father that is
[2:06:07] saying come up Heather amen
[2:06:12] are you hearing the voice of a father
[2:06:14] that is saying I have loved you with an
[2:06:17] everlasting love are you hearing the
[2:06:19] voice of a father that is saying that I
[2:06:22] took a picture of you
[2:06:24] I'm going back to that picture thing
[2:06:26] amen
[2:06:31] praise the Lord
[2:06:36] I took a picture of you right from the
[2:06:38] beginning
[2:06:41] the Bible says he he has predestinated
[2:06:44] us that we should walk before him holy
[2:06:49] in love with our blame
[2:06:52] amen
[2:06:55] how can you do that
[2:06:57] when we are all born the same shape like
[2:06:59] in iniquity
[2:07:00] so you see that's the reason why the
[2:07:03] prophet will come and let us know that
[2:07:05] he took a picture of you
[2:07:08] right from his mind and it's that image
[2:07:11] that he has kept before him
[2:07:17] praise the Lord
[2:07:21] that's the image that he have kept
[2:07:23] before him
[2:07:24] that's the reason why he have he had the
[2:07:28] heart to take on flesh and come and pay
[2:07:31] for our sin
[2:07:33] because he has kept a perfect picture
[2:07:35] before him
[2:07:37] and he want to bring us back to that
[2:07:39] state
[2:07:44] praise the Lord
[2:07:47] so the people there uh uh uh uh the man
[2:07:51] of olive all the way hearing Jesus
[2:07:53] saying wow
[2:07:56] who can live holy
[2:07:59] amen
[2:08:01] who can live holy then then but he's he
[2:08:04] already told I never came to destroy the
[2:08:06] Lord I came to fulfill it I came to do
[2:08:10] what the Lord could not do
[2:08:12] because no man was justified by the Lord
[2:08:17] I'm here to lift you out of the
[2:08:19] condemnation of the Lord and to express
[2:08:22] my love and my life through you
[2:08:28] praise the Lord
[2:08:33] what are we looking at sometimes we get
[2:08:35] so stuck you know uh uh our challenges
[2:08:40] and uh our failures and our weakness
[2:08:42] that they are so imprinted on our mind
[2:08:48] that it's difficult to see another
[2:08:50] picture
[2:08:52] to even see how can we get out of this
[2:08:59] but look at the stars
[2:09:02] amen look at the stars look at the
[2:09:05] promises in this book
[2:09:10] just like Paul said we just read if
[2:09:13] God's paying that his his his uh uh on a
[2:09:17] beloved Son
[2:09:19] how much more will he and I give us all
[2:09:22] things
[2:09:29] are we together
[2:09:31] so you see expressing that uh exceeding
[2:09:36] faith
[2:09:38] we have to go beyond ourselves
[2:09:41] you have to look to the word
[2:09:43] amen
[2:09:46] even expressing exceeding Joy
[2:09:51] it is because of what the word has
[2:09:53] promised
[2:09:55] Hallelujah
[2:09:56] sometimes we look at our symptoms and
[2:09:59] the things that we're going through it's
[2:10:01] very difficult to rejoice
[2:10:05] our spirit is so battered and I mean
[2:10:07] just worrying and thinking about things
[2:10:10] on our mind
[2:10:13] but we have a lot of promises
[2:10:16] praise the Lord
[2:10:19] knowing very well that God knows that we
[2:10:22] will go through all of these things
[2:10:25] and that's the reason why he he's uh uh
[2:10:28] he gave us these promises just like the
[2:10:30] children of Israel God knew that the
[2:10:33] Giants will be in the land
[2:10:35] but he never mentioned the Giants
[2:10:38] he said the land is Flowing with milk
[2:10:41] and honey
[2:10:44] praise the Lord because what he wanted
[2:10:47] them to do is to go look for milk and
[2:10:49] honey not look for Giants
[2:10:53] go and look for milk and honey
[2:10:56] he knew that the Giants were there
[2:10:58] but when they got to the Guild of the
[2:11:00] city the first thing they saw they saw
[2:11:02] the Giants
[2:11:04] praise the Lord
[2:11:06] I said wow
[2:11:09] they even forgot that there was milk and
[2:11:11] honey
[2:11:13] they forgot that there was milk and
[2:11:15] honey
[2:11:16] it depends on what you are looking at
[2:11:22] what you are looking at
[2:11:24] will increase your faith if you are
[2:11:27] looking at God promises if you are
[2:11:30] taking God's word every morning to look
[2:11:33] for a promise love for a word that will
[2:11:36] edify your heart it's going to increase
[2:11:38] your faith give you strength even make
[2:11:41] you healthier
[2:11:45] praise the Lord
[2:11:51] but if you are looking at your next
[2:11:53] appointment with the doctor
[2:11:55] and the prescription and the Assad
[2:11:58] effects
[2:12:01] praise the Lord
[2:12:04] amen if you are looking at the next
[2:12:07] appointment with the doctor the
[2:12:08] prescription I got to change this matter
[2:12:10] I can deal with these side effects and
[2:12:12] and then when you go the next one they
[2:12:14] will give you the outside effects
[2:12:17] praise the Lord much more when you are
[2:12:19] looking at the news and everything that
[2:12:21] is happening since six years old taking
[2:12:24] gun and father putting his gun in the
[2:12:26] chart in a kindergarten backpack

[2:12:40] amen
[2:12:44] Hallelujah
[2:12:46] amen
[2:12:48] glory be to God
[2:12:52] I am your great and your exceeding
[2:12:55] reward

[2:12:59] Abraham I will reward you with myself
[2:13:02] he's the father of faith
[2:13:06] the way that God there with the father
[2:13:08] of Faith that's the way he would deal
[2:13:10] with every Seed of Abraham
[2:13:13] he says I will reward you with myself I
[2:13:16] am your great and your exceeding reward
[2:13:24] are we together

[2:13:45] speaking this uh uh over in the UK
[2:13:50] uh sometime last year taking this same
[2:13:54] subject about exceeding reward in the
[2:13:56] city faith
[2:13:57] and uh uh we read this spoken word is
[2:14:01] the original see the Lord
[2:14:03] of reproduction bring forth of his kind
[2:14:08] this last day the truth Church Bride
[2:14:11] Comes to the hair Stone
[2:14:13] will be the Super Church
[2:14:17] man if you take that word super Church
[2:14:24] and he talks about the super Church a
[2:14:27] super race
[2:14:28] if you take that word and you just you
[2:14:31] just stick it in their sense or in that
[2:14:33] in a way that brother Brandon take it
[2:14:36] you would think that
[2:14:39] this message has come to start another
[2:14:41] race of people no
[2:14:44] better Brandon was just using the very
[2:14:47] same language that Paul is using here
[2:14:54] exceeding faith
[2:14:57] that's what that word super is
[2:15:00] praise the Lord
[2:15:02] he says there have been men Through the
[2:15:05] Ages
[2:15:07] they have tried to start some kind of a
[2:15:09] super race he said Hitler trying it
[2:15:12] never worked for him messaloon and try
[2:15:14] it never worked for him
[2:15:16] praise the Lord
[2:15:21] and you see people will just get honored
[2:15:23] they are taught you know we are the
[2:15:25] super race because you believe Malachi 4
[2:15:27] because you believe God sent a prophet
[2:15:29] that's not what he was talking about
[2:15:31] [Music]
[2:15:32] is to allow the exceeding grace of God
[2:15:35] to be expressed through your life
[2:15:39] that when you realize that God was
[2:15:41] merciful to you you can be merciful to
[2:15:44] somebody else when you realize that by
[2:15:47] Grace you were safe
[2:15:48] you can give somebody else a chance but
[2:15:51] what have we done we have taken the
[2:15:53] sense that because we are the super race
[2:15:55] we condemn every other group of people
[2:15:57] that is only the only library in the
[2:16:00] Rapture you get the whole picture wrong
[2:16:02] [Music]

[2:17:29] desire they will meditate upon the world
[2:17:32] day and night

[2:17:39] about
[2:17:41] people that we have exceeding Grace
[2:17:44] exceeding understanding
[2:17:48] they will have such a knowledge to be
[2:17:50] able to deal with things in such a
[2:17:53] complex age

[2:17:59] make you judgmenter
