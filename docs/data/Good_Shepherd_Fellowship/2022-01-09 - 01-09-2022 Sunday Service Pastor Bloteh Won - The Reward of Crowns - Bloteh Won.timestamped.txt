[40:54] sons and daughters stay pressing onto
[40:56] the mark of the high calling
[40:58] and we just want to
[41:00] continue to encourage ourselves
[41:04] believing that the lord is faithful
[41:07] and his grace is going to be with each
[41:08] and every one of us
[41:10] praise the lord
[41:11] god bless you brother one good to see
[41:13] you
[41:14] amen
[41:15] and uh uh
[41:18] i would like to address this uh
[41:21] first uh
[41:22] we will uh
[41:24] uh just go over
[41:26] our time again is uh
[41:29] we know that the doors open at ten
[41:31] o'clock
[41:32] and uh that they can saw some of the
[41:35] usher's brothers try to be here
[41:38] or some of our sisters that helped with
[41:40] the sound try to be here at ten o'clock
[41:43] but i i i kind of noticed we were
[41:46] we were the
[41:49] trying to do from 10 o'clock to 10 15
[41:53] a time of prayer
[41:54] and then we go on
[41:56] playing the tape
[42:00] just before we get into the service
[42:03] and
[42:04] i also realized that
[42:07] uh
[42:09] some are able to make it some are not
[42:11] able to make it here at ten o'clock
[42:13] and that's okay
[42:15] and one good thing there is that
[42:18] if you uh either on the youtube facebook
[42:21] channel you can be able to follow
[42:22] whatever is being played
[42:25] and
[42:26] one of the reason why
[42:28] we did that
[42:31] was
[42:34] one of the major reason was to encourage
[42:36] ourselves to
[42:38] to
[42:40] continue to play and listen to the voice
[42:42] of the messenger
[42:44] that's one reason
[42:45] and the second reason there is that
[42:48] you know when you talk about melee
[42:50] meditation time
[42:52] you realize that
[42:53] when the prelude of the music is playing
[42:56] if you don't have anything to set your
[42:57] mind on the devil is going to give you
[43:00] something to put your mind on
[43:02] so that is that is all part of our
[43:04] meditation time
[43:06] but i realized a couple of few times
[43:09] being in l.a i will see
[43:13] the
[43:14] the sound
[43:16] people will come and they go right back
[43:18] there trying to to get the tip on get
[43:22] the music going get the tape on
[43:24] and it's just they are just there from
[43:27] that time to the end of the service
[43:30] and then right right after the service
[43:32] uh i saw some of the sisters trying to
[43:35] get a little time to sit down and and
[43:38] meditating you know trying to be able to
[43:42] get something
[43:43] that they might have heard during the
[43:45] service
[43:46] so i thought okay we might uh approach
[43:49] this a little bit different we will go
[43:52] uh those will be opened at 10 o'clock
[43:55] and we will have a time of prayer from
[43:57] 10
[43:58] to
[43:59] about 10 25 or
[44:02] 10 30 if you can be in prayer for that
[44:05] long but what will happen is they had a
[44:07] right in the midst of that time
[44:09] around 10 25 or so
[44:12] uh the sound team we will return on
[44:15] whatever we are playing
[44:17] that that morning
[44:19] i'm hoping the other
[44:21] you know uh
[44:23] you know i mean just playing the message
[44:25] of the prophet or maybe plain we might
[44:27] choose to play the book of the bible
[44:30] maybe the book of genesis or any book of
[44:32] the bible that we choose to play
[44:36] and it would just be
[44:38] you know to be able to remind us i mean
[44:40] if a person does not play the tip of the
[44:42] prophet you might have the privilege to
[44:44] listen to one when you come here on time
[44:47] and
[44:48] so in that way
[44:51] uh when the sound team comes in they can
[44:54] be able to turn the prelude music on
[44:57] and and they themselves can be able to
[44:58] find some time to sit pray
[45:01] and uh
[45:03] you know uh if you have to do some
[45:05] technical things you will never know how
[45:07] stressful sometimes it is for them
[45:10] when things are not working back there
[45:13] we sit you know we listen to the sound
[45:15] or sometimes we complain when the when
[45:17] the speakers go wow
[45:19] hold your ears
[45:21] and and but you really don't know what
[45:23] all they have to go through back then
[45:25] so uh
[45:27] i will
[45:28] love that we come in and we all can use
[45:32] that time to come and pray
[45:34] and by writing between 10 20 10 25 they
[45:38] will turn the message on and and all of
[45:41] that is just to help set our mind on
[45:44] positive things set our mind on the lord
[45:47] set out our mind on something that the
[45:49] prophet of god myself said before we
[45:52] just go right into the service
[45:54] so uh uh that that would be the order
[45:56] that we will we will try to follow as
[46:00] the law would give us grace
[46:02] and uh around
[46:05] 10 50 or so
[46:08] they will be able to change because
[46:10] actually they have to do some change
[46:13] changes to be able to put us right
[46:16] into the service for the day
[46:18] so uh
[46:21] they will know how to
[46:23] uh whatever they do back there
[46:25] just to be able to give them some room
[46:27] for them to be able to change that so we
[46:30] will come again the doors will be
[46:31] opening at 10 o'clock we will have our
[46:34] time of praying and we will also want to
[46:36] encourage the musicians
[46:38] and and every one of us to come come and
[46:41] you know find a place uh uh if you want
[46:44] knee down and pray sit down and pray one
[46:47] thing i would not i would not want us to
[46:49] do
[46:50] is to use that time to browse on your
[46:53] phone
[46:54] uh i mean you will be invading our space
[46:58] if you do that because you will be
[47:00] trying to bring some kind of a fourth
[47:02] dimension
[47:03] atmosphere we already have a lot to deal
[47:05] with when we come in here
[47:07] so uh uh if you will not be praying or
[47:10] you would not be reading your bible just
[47:13] sit in your car
[47:14] and wait for the music to be playing and
[47:16] then you can come and dance
[47:18] but i would not want uh you know anyone
[47:21] to use that time to be browsing on their
[47:23] phone doing what they are not supposed
[47:26] to be doing
[47:27] and so uh uh that would be uh you know
[47:31] our our time the way we would love to
[47:34] approach it as the lord will give us
[47:35] grace and then the next thing that we we
[47:38] would like to talk about is uh
[47:41] [Music]
[47:43] what was supposed to be the cry room
[47:45] that is now like a multi-purpose room
[47:49] we have a few young
[47:52] ones in church babies and mothers and
[47:56] i fed i felt a little bit
[48:00] i felt bad when
[48:01] you know the deacons told me
[48:04] have some talks with the sisters and
[48:05] they feel like
[48:07] uh they don't have some privacy to be
[48:10] able to take care of their babies
[48:12] so uh for that reason we will go back to
[48:15] using that room
[48:17] only for the mothers
[48:19] and
[48:20] and
[48:21] you know and the young ones
[48:23] you know uh
[48:24] when when it's service time when we come
[48:27] in here unless you come early uh
[48:31] brothers deacons usher and you want to
[48:34] get water from in there when it is time
[48:36] from service 10 o'clock either get a
[48:39] sister to go in that room no brother
[48:42] should go there
[48:44] either get one of your sister ask your
[48:46] wife to go and get something
[48:50] water or whatever but let it roam solely
[48:53] be used for the sisters
[48:55] that's the reason why musicians when we
[48:57] come if you come during the time of
[49:00] prayer on that we would just meet right
[49:02] in the foyer there and we would pray and
[49:05] then we would come into the building
[49:08] uh coming early and during the prayer
[49:10] time or so you you you prayed and you
[49:13] think that
[49:14] you know uh uh
[49:16] uh you want to talk to one of your uh uh
[49:20] you know teammate on you know music or
[49:23] different things that we can do there
[49:25] right in the foyer there but let that
[49:26] room be used for
[49:29] the mothers and their babies
[49:31] and
[49:33] also
[49:34] the hallway there
[49:36] now
[49:39] you know the law would turn our
[49:40] captivity around that's why he promised
[49:43] that he would do amen
[49:45] and we will be like zion one of these
[49:47] days
[49:48] but until that time we have to manage
[49:51] the space that we have
[49:53] the room down there i mean they're right
[49:55] in the all the hallway there uh
[49:58] you know uh asks uh you know unless a
[50:01] brother you're going right directly to
[50:03] use the men's room
[50:05] and uh uh
[50:07] you know let's let's not stand and hover
[50:10] back there because
[50:12] you know
[50:13] it also split the way there to the the
[50:16] sisters you know roma as well
[50:19] so
[50:20] [Music]
[50:23] we want to manage our space that we have
[50:25] and we also want to do it with a lot of
[50:27] decency
[50:29] and respect to one another
[50:31] praise the lord
[50:33] so uh i pray that the lord will
[50:36] you know will be able to help us
[50:38] and uh
[50:40] we will do the best that we can to be
[50:43] able to sell you in the best way
[50:45] that
[50:47] the lord will be able to help us
[50:49] and
[50:51] we got prayer requests yesterday the
[50:54] young joshua ali not feeling well
[50:58] he having a lot of pain in his stomach
[51:02] and so we want to
[51:04] lift him up in prayer this morning
[51:06] and and uh
[51:10] our sister also says to mary that you
[51:14] come here
[51:15] uh her
[51:17] husband went to be with the lord
[51:20] back in liberia uh so we also want to
[51:23] leave that family uh in pray
[51:26] you know when she called me and i was i
[51:28] was talking actually she spoke to
[51:30] brother johnny brother johnny called me
[51:32] and then uh
[51:34] i called her back and you know we were
[51:36] talking and she was telling me
[51:38] now she could not remember but i know i
[51:41] know her husband
[51:42] because uh uh
[51:45] many years back
[51:47] where we were having service was very
[51:49] adjacent to his church very close to his
[51:52] church
[51:53] you know and then sometimes we will
[51:55] borrow the benches from his church
[51:58] for service and or death so
[52:01] uh
[52:02] yeah it kind of brought a lot of memory
[52:04] too so we want to keep our sister in
[52:06] prayer that the law will be able to
[52:08] comfort her and the family and uh it's
[52:11] also good to see british and bibi some
[52:14] back there
[52:15] and uh
[52:17] we see uh uh
[52:19] some of the young people went down to
[52:22] arizona for the youth banquet uh spoke
[52:24] to brother israel i think they had a
[52:26] good time there
[52:27] and they should be back tomorrow so we
[52:29] also keep them in prayer let's buy our

[1:04:40] the rewards of crowns in the bible it
[1:04:43] talks about different crowns and and
[1:04:46] that's what we want to talk about a

[1:04:51] crowns that's why we want to talk you
[1:04:53] see because
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:59] i think i would do better if i have you
[1:05:02] read the scripture and sit down because
[1:05:05] it looks like i'm i'm already ready to
[1:05:07] preach now
[1:05:09] first corinthians chapter nine
[1:05:11] let's read first corinthians chapter
[1:05:13] nine
[1:05:15] praise the lord
[1:05:23] let's go first corinthians chapter nine
[1:05:32] and i think uh some of the brothers
[1:05:34] brought it up on the
[1:05:36] on the terry first night
[1:05:38] uh
[1:05:39] i think it was it was an amazing night
[1:05:41] having all of the brothers uh speaking
[1:05:44] but then started with running the race
[1:05:46] uh brother jose i mean he comes there
[1:05:49] and say if you really want to run this
[1:05:50] raid you got to start with repentance
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:57] and i mean it was just beautiful
[1:06:00] and virgil came and brought jordan
[1:06:03] taking us right into the seven seals oh
[1:06:05] my goodness
[1:06:07] amen let's just read here uh first
[1:06:09] corinthians chapter nine
[1:06:13] we read from verse 24 and paul
[1:06:16] speak to the corinthians here and say no
[1:06:19] ye net that they wish run in a race
[1:06:22] run all
[1:06:24] but won't receive the prize
[1:06:27] so wrong
[1:06:29] that ye may
[1:06:31] obtain
[1:06:33] and every man that strived for the
[1:06:36] master it is temperate in all things
[1:06:39] now they do it to obtain a
[1:06:42] corruptable
[1:06:44] crown but
[1:06:46] we are incorruptible
[1:06:50] and therefore
[1:06:51] so wrong
[1:06:53] net
[1:06:54] as uncertainly sulfite are
[1:06:58] not as one that beated the air but
[1:07:03] but i keep my body now listening to this
[1:07:06] is the apost the apostle paul this is
[1:07:08] the prophet to the gentiles
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:14] he says but i keep my body
[1:07:17] and bring it into suggestion suggestion
[1:07:20] to what to the word
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:25] i keep my body and bring it
[1:07:28] into suggestion
[1:07:30] least that by any means
[1:07:33] when i have preached to other
[1:07:36] others i myself
[1:07:39] should be a castaway
[1:07:43] praise the lord
[1:07:44] now so it gives you an idea to to let
[1:07:48] you to see where those apostles where
[1:07:50] those great men
[1:07:52] that experience the supernatural where
[1:07:54] they stand they never felt that they did
[1:07:58] arrive
[1:07:59] because they pray for the sake or they
[1:08:01] got one miracle or the god won spiritual
[1:08:03] dreams they never felt that they have
[1:08:05] arrived
[1:08:07] they always fear there was a fighting to
[1:08:09] do
[1:08:15] praise the lord they always felt there
[1:08:18] was a fighting
[1:08:20] to do
[1:08:25] i keep my body and bring it
[1:08:28] into subjection leads by any means
[1:08:31] when i have preached to others
[1:08:34] i myself should be a castaway
[1:08:38] let us pray heavenly father
[1:08:40] lord we want to just ask your grace to
[1:08:42] come in and speak to us this morning
[1:08:45] come break your word
[1:08:47] come father lord o god and
[1:08:50] as we will pray until we get through
[1:08:52] this year we don't know what it holds
[1:08:54] lord
[1:08:55] but we know you the whole time in
[1:08:57] eternity but father we know the times
[1:09:00] are challenging
[1:09:02] father the times are perilous times
[1:09:05] the times are dark times of god
[1:09:08] where men are falling away from the
[1:09:11] faith
[1:09:12] and some are growing cold the love of
[1:09:15] god is growing cold some have sealed
[1:09:18] their mind with hot iron so god somehow
[1:09:22] make a shipwreck
[1:09:24] father lord god and we we see all of
[1:09:27] these things happening around us
[1:09:29] and we want to come to you like the
[1:09:31] apostle paul this morning
[1:09:33] to bring our mind our body
[1:09:36] in suggestion to your word
[1:09:39] father god the lord we will not run a
[1:09:42] vain raise lord we will not run a church
[1:09:45] race
[1:09:46] we will not run a religious race when i
[1:09:48] run the proud race of god
[1:09:51] but we will run the race of father lord
[1:09:54] a race of god where we are striving we
[1:09:56] are fighting lord

[1:11:55] them as well in jesus name amen
[1:11:58] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:12:00] your seed
[1:12:03] praise the lord
[1:12:04] amen now i want to start up like this
[1:12:08] you know wha uh we you uh
[1:12:12] you know uh brother branham said in
[1:12:14] question that answered on genesis he
[1:12:16] said god had to
[1:12:19] uh he he had to condescend himself god
[1:12:24] in the way that god does things he have
[1:12:27] god have to use the most
[1:12:29] simplest
[1:12:32] means
[1:12:33] to give us an idea of what he want to do
[1:12:38] because you see in a way our human
[1:12:41] nature is made
[1:12:43] praise the lord
[1:12:45] sometimes this this this life that we
[1:12:48] boast off and and become so proud of if
[1:12:52] you realize how reverse it is
[1:12:56] praise the lord
[1:12:58] if you realize
[1:13:00] how reverse
[1:13:02] we might think that we are walking
[1:13:04] forward but i mean it's a complete
[1:13:06] reverse
[1:13:08] we might even be walking upside down
[1:13:12] praise the lord
[1:13:18] praise the lord so you see god
[1:13:21] god will have to break things down and
[1:13:24] you will have to do things and and do
[1:13:26] things and make it simple and and make
[1:13:29] things to happen just to be able to grab
[1:13:33] our attention and give us an idea
[1:13:36] of what
[1:13:39] he's doing
[1:13:42] that's what the apostle paul can say his
[1:13:44] eyes have not seen ears have not heard
[1:13:48] neither have it come to the heart of man
[1:13:50] what god having installed now i want to
[1:13:52] talk on the rewards of crowns the reason
[1:13:55] why i said it is because when you read
[1:13:57] through the scripture and you and you
[1:13:59] you think about the the crown of life
[1:14:02] the crown of glory and the different
[1:14:04] crowns that the bible talk about all we
[1:14:07] imagine in our mind heaven they're going
[1:14:10] to set something on our heads
[1:14:14] now all we think about
[1:14:16] i'm going to have a crown
[1:14:21] praise the lord
[1:14:24] we just think about wearing some kind of
[1:14:27] a gold
[1:14:28] thing on our head
[1:14:32] you see that's that is the that is the
[1:14:34] reason why
[1:14:36] the devil knows that that's the reason
[1:14:38] why he used
[1:14:39] the the prosperity preachers and the
[1:14:42] prosperity gospel to
[1:14:45] to you know to kind of
[1:14:46] push those things in the mind of the
[1:14:48] people
[1:14:50] you know that if you are if you don't if
[1:14:52] you are not wearing a gold ring and a
[1:14:54] big gold chain around your neck and and
[1:14:57] it means that you you're not getting
[1:14:59] close to your internal reward
[1:15:03] when that does not have anything to do
[1:15:06] with eternity
[1:15:13] now you see it takes a prophet to come
[1:15:14] on the scene again and let us to know
[1:15:17] what jesus said uh in my father's house
[1:15:19] are many mansions you know uh i go and
[1:15:22] prepare your a place for you paul have
[1:15:25] already said it that uh you know uh
[1:15:29] uh uh mortal cannot inherit immortality
[1:15:33] but yeah in our mind we look at mention
[1:15:36] we are thinking about beverly hills we
[1:15:38] are thinking about out of this 10
[1:15:40] bedroom house
[1:15:45] praise the lord
[1:15:49] so we think that we're going to heaven
[1:15:50] we're going to get a 10 bearing house 20
[1:15:53] bearing house you know
[1:15:55] all my children will get their own room
[1:16:02] praise the lord
[1:16:07] and the prophet says no i don't think it
[1:16:09] would be a malta house
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:15] i don't think it would be a malta house
[1:16:19] it will be a dwelling place
[1:16:24] a dwelling place that do not perish
[1:16:30] so we want to look at there this morning
[1:16:32] we want to look at that
[1:16:34] uh
[1:16:35] we want to look at that in and i will i
[1:16:38] will i want you to bear with me because
[1:16:40] uh we i i don't think i can be able to
[1:16:43] do this in one service
[1:16:45] but i will try to do my best and then
[1:16:50] we we can pick it up
[1:16:52] wednesday night i i i wanted to speak on
[1:16:55] something but i was i was looking at the
[1:16:57] weather and uh and never wanted for us
[1:17:00] to be trapped here so i kind of was uh
[1:17:03] uh
[1:17:04] i
[1:17:05] strayed a little bit from what i was
[1:17:07] going to talk about
[1:17:10] but uh
[1:17:11] i hope we we were able to grab
[1:17:14] you know a little bit of uh
[1:17:16] of the concept we read isaiah chapter 14
[1:17:20] where uh
[1:17:22] david has already said in the psalm
[1:17:25] you know uh uh
[1:17:27] talking about the law dwelling on the in
[1:17:30] this on the side of the mountain you
[1:17:32] know mount zion the city of the lord of
[1:17:34] the great king
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] and uh uh
[1:17:41] let's let's let's look at that uh
[1:17:44] because we we read that a little bit i
[1:17:46] want to i want to use that
[1:17:48] as uh
[1:17:50] as a stepping stone here that was psalm
[1:17:52] chapter 48
[1:17:54] we read psalm chapter 48.
[1:17:57] psalm chapter 48 reading from uh
[1:18:00] verse 1
[1:18:02] great is the lord and greatly to be
[1:18:04] praised in the city of our god
[1:18:07] in the mountain of his holiness great is
[1:18:09] the lord and greatly to be praised amen
[1:18:13] beautiful situation
[1:18:16] the joy of the whole earth is mount zion
[1:18:21] on the side of the north
[1:18:24] the city of the great king
[1:18:27] praise the lord
[1:18:29] the side of the another city of the
[1:18:30] great king isaiah chapter 14 reading
[1:18:33] verse 12. now satan noun is going to
[1:18:36] express how he wants to take that place
[1:18:40] he's now going to say i'm going to do
[1:18:42] her in that place now the talk behind
[1:18:45] that is that
[1:18:47] your your your your greatest battle is
[1:18:50] where your blessings lays
[1:18:55] praise the lord
[1:18:57] your greatest weakness is where your
[1:19:00] strength lays
[1:19:03] why because a chain is only strong at
[1:19:06] its weaker length
[1:19:10] you see that's the reason why the enemy
[1:19:12] will always he want to do or he want to
[1:19:14] possess that place because he knows if
[1:19:16] he can possess that place
[1:19:19] he can he can keep you as his slave
[1:19:23] satan don't keep people as children he
[1:19:25] keep them as slaves
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:31] because he can give birth
[1:19:36] isaiah chapter 14 we read that in verse
[1:19:39] 12 how are thou falling all lucifer son
[1:19:41] of the morning how are that cut down to
[1:19:44] the ground which did weaken the nations
[1:19:47] for thou have said in their heart i will
[1:19:49] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:19:52] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[1:19:55] also
[1:19:57] upon the mount of the congregation in
[1:19:59] the side of the north
[1:20:02] the very same place where the sami
[1:20:04] declared is the city of the great king
[1:20:09] said don't say i will make that city my
[1:20:11] my throne i will make it my sitting
[1:20:13] place
[1:20:19] praise the lord
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:22] that's the reason why he comes to church
[1:20:25] and then if he can just get us
[1:20:26] distracted and just get us into
[1:20:29] amusement get us away from the word he's
[1:20:31] i mean he has he has he has taken over
[1:20:34] the service
[1:20:37] all he needs is just to just throw one
[1:20:40] human element into it
[1:20:42] make a showmanship
[1:20:53] no longer he keeps repeating those
[1:20:55] things in our lives and keep bringing
[1:20:57] those things up again and keep bringing
[1:20:59] it up keep bringing it up because he
[1:21:01] knows that's what your strength is
[1:21:04] if you can just bring that thing on a
[1:21:06] subjection every other thing will fall
[1:21:08] in place
[1:21:11] whether it's a little temple whether
[1:21:13] it's a little lost whatever it is if you
[1:21:16] can just subject that thing to the world
[1:21:18] every other thing will line up
[1:21:25] he knows
[1:21:26] that he knows that
[1:21:30] he has studied man since the garden of
[1:21:33] eden
[1:21:35] now so we we that so talking about that
[1:21:38] and talking about crossing over going
[1:21:41] into the inheritance and talking about
[1:21:44] we started there with rebecca and and uh
[1:21:47] i mean uh richard and leah
[1:21:50] uh uh we we talked about the birthstones
[1:21:53] then we went and talked about uh you
[1:21:55] know jacob also prophesying in his last
[1:21:58] day genesis 49 because in one of in
[1:22:00] jacob's uh a prophecy he said this about
[1:22:04] joseph let's read
[1:22:06] genesis 49
[1:22:08] we start like this
[1:22:11] on the max go
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:23] verse 26 the blessings of the father
[1:22:28] have
[1:22:30] prevailed above the blessings
[1:22:33] of my prayer janitors onto the uttermost
[1:22:36] bound
[1:22:37] all the everlasting hills
[1:22:42] they shall be
[1:22:44] on that on the head of joseph
[1:22:48] and on the crown of his head
[1:22:53] a crown of the head of him
[1:22:55] that was separated from his brethren now
[1:22:58] so see here in in the many blessings
[1:23:01] that he's putting on joseph he's telling
[1:23:04] joseph that you know uh uh uh the
[1:23:08] blessings
[1:23:09] you know of how god all the blessings of
[1:23:12] abraham isaac and joseph i mean abraham
[1:23:15] isaac and jacob
[1:23:17] has come on the head of joseph
[1:23:20] as a crown
[1:23:24] he's not talking about wearing a
[1:23:27] physical crown he's talking about
[1:23:30] the blessings that were that were that
[1:23:32] will overwhelm you that would crown your
[1:23:35] life
[1:23:39] praise the lord but you think about it
[1:23:43] think about it
[1:23:45] if if all of those 12 boss knew
[1:23:48] that there was there was a blessing of
[1:23:51] abraham isaac and
[1:23:53] and jacob that was going to pull down to
[1:23:55] be a crown do you think that they were
[1:23:58] going to give
[1:23:59] joseph out to be slave
[1:24:03] joseph himself did not even know that
[1:24:06] that that was going to be his end
[1:24:11] he's he keep thinking
[1:24:13] what have i done to my brothers that is
[1:24:15] so mean to me
[1:24:19] that's that's why he's thinking in his
[1:24:21] mind
[1:24:25] but you see then and and he goes through
[1:24:28] that and he goes through everything in
[1:24:30] potiphar house and he goes through
[1:24:32] everything in the prison and in all of
[1:24:35] that
[1:24:36] he keeps thinking oh my god
[1:24:39] what a life is this
[1:24:42] praise the lord
[1:24:48] but all of those things were preparing
[1:24:50] him for the crown
[1:24:53] what he would receive as a reward
[1:25:01] praise the lord
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:07] and god actually crowned his life
[1:25:11] because until joseph died
[1:25:17] there was no man higher in egypt
[1:25:23] god crowned his life until the name
[1:25:27] joseph
[1:25:30] the name joseph
[1:25:34] a stranger a hebrew name
[1:25:37] will those egyptians in their boats
[1:25:43] god crowned him with honor respect glory
[1:25:48] but it never came on the flanks of life
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] praise the lord
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:02] do you know why you know why
[1:26:05] podify
[1:26:07] put joseph in praising
[1:26:09] the reason is because potiphar never
[1:26:12] believed his wife
[1:26:15] it was a capital punishment
[1:26:19] if it was truth
[1:26:21] joseph would have been beheaded
[1:26:23] it was a capital punishment for him
[1:26:26] being a slave
[1:26:28] yes
[1:26:30] sir
[1:26:31] he did not believe his wife
[1:26:41] praise the lord
[1:26:43] for him not to believe his wife means
[1:26:45] that joseph
[1:26:47] has lived such a life
[1:26:54] he has lived such a life
[1:26:59] praise the lord
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:04] that it was never i mean it did not
[1:27:08] bother
[1:27:10] qualifying
[1:27:13] now he will entrust in the hands of a
[1:27:16] stranger everything
[1:27:19] that is in his house
[1:27:28] praise the lord
[1:27:34] the bible says
[1:27:39] when god
[1:27:42] was about to be made flesh
[1:27:47] and with his promise
[1:27:51] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:27:54] he was going to take a young innocent
[1:27:57] girl
[1:28:00] to fulfill his word
[1:28:02] but yet he needed a man of character
[1:28:06] to be able to protect that gift
[1:28:09] so the bible say he got a man
[1:28:13] joseph
[1:28:14] and he was a just man
[1:28:17] the bible used that word for a reason
[1:28:21] he was a just man
[1:28:24] means that he will respect every lord
[1:28:29] of course shape
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:33] he will respect every law of courtship
[1:28:40] he will not be making up cuts
[1:28:45] i said the prophet said you know the
[1:28:47] prophet said no
[1:28:51] that even when the angel told him don't
[1:28:56] put merit away he was ready to race his
[1:28:59] life
[1:29:04] the only reason why he was thinking
[1:29:06] about putting out a white is is all
[1:29:08] because
[1:29:11] he was confused
[1:29:16] he was confused
[1:29:18] but
[1:29:19] even in the midst of that the bible says
[1:29:22] he was thinking not even to make it a
[1:29:24] public thing
[1:29:26] which means he was not going around
[1:29:28] running his mouth you see how a lot of
[1:29:31] these young girls can behave you see
[1:29:32] that
[1:29:33] the bible says he was a just man
[1:29:44] and because of that god crowned him by
[1:29:47] sending the same angel
[1:29:53] to speak to him
[1:30:03] praise the lord
[1:30:17] you see people
[1:30:19] they get so careless
[1:30:23] and it gets so
[1:30:24] trying to be funny when it's not
[1:30:26] supposed to be funny
[1:30:29] well i mean
[1:30:30] you know me i don't mind i mean if i can
[1:30:33] just get to heaven whatever way i get
[1:30:35] that there is no other way to get there
[1:30:38] there is one way to get there
[1:30:41] there is no other way to get there
[1:30:44] even if i have a brass crown or i mean
[1:30:47] if you want to cry if i can just be
[1:30:49] there
[1:30:50] those kind of a careless way of speaking
[1:30:52] and the thing is funny
[1:30:54] it's all because there is nothing there
[1:30:57] is no fighting in them
[1:30:59] they want to linger lay and sleep in sin
[1:31:03] and expect to see themselves in glory
[1:31:06] i get a news for you
[1:31:09] the bible says no idolater no drunkard
[1:31:11] no smoker
[1:31:23] so you better start fighting
[1:31:25] you better find the ground to stand and
[1:31:27] stop fighting
[1:31:38] so the bible speaks about joseph having
[1:31:40] this crown how god will crown him with
[1:31:43] the blessings
[1:31:45] of his prejudice
[1:31:47] all of jacob's fathers and all the
[1:31:50] blessings of abraham would come on this
[1:31:53] boy
[1:31:54] because
[1:31:55] he was separated
[1:31:57] god set you aside
[1:32:00] for the promise that he gave abraham
[1:32:02] after 400 years i would come down
[1:32:05] and deliver them you were the one that
[1:32:08] god set aside
[1:32:10] in your youthful age
[1:32:13] you never enjoy youthfulness
[1:32:16] as a little boy you were captured put
[1:32:18] into a a a stranger but sent across to
[1:32:22] egypt used as a slave and all of that
[1:32:24] god set you aside that way
[1:32:28] because of that he will crown you
[1:32:42] praise the lord
[1:32:56] the bathroom is getting bloody
[1:33:01] i might have bought my lady
[1:33:04] but it's okay
[1:33:06] now brother branham said this
[1:33:08] philadelphia church age
[1:33:10] let's start with the definition here
[1:33:15] he said
[1:33:17] what is a crown
[1:33:20] what is a crown we know their age was
[1:33:22] promised the crown of life
[1:33:24] he says what is a crown
[1:33:27] he says a crown means
[1:33:29] you have a domain
[1:33:36] you have
[1:33:37] a domain things have been placed on you
[1:33:47] you are a king
[1:33:49] if you are crowned
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:58] that's the reason why the prophet of god
[1:34:00] in the book of revelation
[1:34:02] could find those
[1:34:04] 10 detectors
[1:34:06] the bible says only one hour with the
[1:34:09] beast
[1:34:11] they were crowned kings
[1:34:14] or they were makings they never said
[1:34:17] they were crowned one hour with the
[1:34:18] beast they were making but brown says
[1:34:21] they could not be made
[1:34:23] they could not be makings
[1:34:26] he says in that way they were detectors
[1:34:29] because king is not they are crown kings
[1:34:33] kings are crowned so they were they were
[1:34:35] kings without crown
[1:34:40] praise the lord
[1:34:42] so their influence with the beast
[1:34:46] they are influenced with the beast
[1:34:49] give them uh
[1:34:50] give them that power
[1:34:54] and all in all of those territories that
[1:34:56] are out there pulling you know uh uh
[1:34:59] spinning in the rest of that but
[1:35:02] let's let's just stay right here so you
[1:35:04] are a king
[1:35:06] if you are crowned see
[1:35:08] and we are sons of god
[1:35:11] sons and daughters of god when we are
[1:35:14] crowned
[1:35:16] with internal life
[1:35:19] how are you crowned with eternal life
[1:35:23] jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:28] has passed from death onto life
[1:35:35] so by faith when we reach out by faith
[1:35:39] and accept the lord jesus
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:43] as our lord and savior
[1:35:48] he crowned us with internal life
[1:35:52] it's not what we are wearing on our head
[1:35:58] but our faith declares
[1:36:01] that we have internal life
[1:36:04] we don't get there before we have
[1:36:06] internal life
[1:36:08] we have a year
[1:36:13] that's what influenced our life in the
[1:36:15] path that we go
[1:36:17] yes sir
[1:36:19] are we together
[1:36:21] you see
[1:36:23] you are a son of god when you are
[1:36:25] crowned with internal life and our
[1:36:28] domain
[1:36:29] is
[1:36:31] the earth
[1:36:37] praise the lord
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:41] our domain is the earth
[1:36:44] so while we are here
[1:36:48] as a son of god as a daughter of god
[1:36:50] that is crowned the son of god crown the
[1:36:53] daughter of god we have a domain that
[1:36:56] we we there they are things that we have
[1:36:58] to bring under control
[1:37:03] there are things that we have to bring
[1:37:05] honor control
[1:37:07] we can do it ourselves that's the reason
[1:37:09] why the holy spirit is offered to you
[1:37:16] that's why the holy spirit god offered
[1:37:18] you his spirit
[1:37:24] are we together
[1:37:26] the earth is our domain
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:30] make you priests and kings unto
[1:37:33] god is that right
[1:37:36] now so you see the whole subject about
[1:37:39] crowns you read in the scripture you
[1:37:42] will see the uh the whole subject about
[1:37:45] crowns
[1:37:46] different crowns we will look at as we
[1:37:47] look at the subject together but the the
[1:37:50] thing about it there is that uh in the
[1:37:52] way that the bible speak about this
[1:37:55] crown like i said there are rewards
[1:37:58] that are given to the faithful
[1:38:01] the crown of righteousness
[1:38:03] the crown of life
[1:38:06] the crown of joy
[1:38:08] now so you see
[1:38:09] god has crowned an individual life
[1:38:15] amen
[1:38:18] that's why sometimes you don't
[1:38:20] understand it it looks like other people
[1:38:22] try to be i mean what what is the guy
[1:38:24] god has crowned a male life with with
[1:38:27] truth
[1:38:28] with righteousness
[1:38:30] amen
[1:38:32] he just i mean he just frown at any
[1:38:35] shitty thing anything that that is
[1:38:38] questionable he frowns i ate
[1:38:43] he can lose sleep he can lose weight
[1:38:51] praise the lord
[1:38:54] because that man has walked with god in
[1:38:57] such a way he has trusted god he has
[1:39:00] proven god
[1:39:02] in different ways and he knows that god
[1:39:04] is his provider he's resting on the word
[1:39:06] of god until god comes around and crown
[1:39:10] his life
[1:39:15] some people are crowned with hospitality
[1:39:19] they can take their lives
[1:39:22] and give it
[1:39:24] they enjoy doing it it's part of their
[1:39:26] life
[1:39:30] god crowns
[1:39:35] joseph received his crown in this life
[1:39:44] praise the lord
[1:39:55] it's after the man has crossed over
[1:39:58] he has now entered the promised lane he
[1:40:01] has entered the territory where he's
[1:40:04] taking his position he knows now that
[1:40:06] he's the son of god man i got to stop
[1:40:08] all of this nonsense stop playing church
[1:40:10] i mean i got to possess something of god
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:18] and then god comes down and crowned his
[1:40:20] life
[1:40:24] god comes down and crown his life
[1:40:31] praise the lord
[1:40:35] some people
[1:40:36] are wearing their crowns
[1:40:39] amen
[1:40:45] and maybe you think their crown looks
[1:40:47] funny on their head
[1:40:49] that guy you just he just me i can do
[1:40:51] that
[1:40:53] i can take that nonsense
[1:40:56] but don't worry
[1:40:58] it's not your call
[1:41:02] god has crowned a man life
[1:41:06] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:41:11] there is nothing that you can do about
[1:41:14] it
[1:41:15] paul says they are not perishable crowns
[1:41:20] so god
[1:41:22] do not crown us
[1:41:25] with substance he crying us with
[1:41:27] character
[1:41:29] because substance are perishable
[1:41:32] characters are not perishable
[1:41:35] that character will always
[1:41:37] bring substance around you
[1:41:45] oh praise the lord
[1:41:47] are we together
[1:41:49] leviticus chapter 21.
[1:41:53] let's run a little bit now
[1:41:55] amen
[1:42:00] i don't want to put you to sleep so
[1:42:01] don't sleep on me
[1:42:04] leviticus 21.
[1:42:06] let's let's just look at another
[1:42:08] biblical uh uh approach here 21 verse 12
[1:42:13] neither shall he go in
[1:42:16] to any dead body that's the priest now
[1:42:19] none defied himself
[1:42:24] what what am i reading
[1:42:26] okay define himself
[1:42:29] for his father or for his mother that's
[1:42:31] supposed to be reading twelve i'm
[1:42:33] reading eleven
[1:42:34] miracha he go out
[1:42:38] of the century non-profane the century
[1:42:41] of his god
[1:42:43] for the crown
[1:42:45] of the anointing oil
[1:42:48] so you see when the priest
[1:42:51] is pulled when that's that's why all was
[1:42:54] used to to anoint the priest or anoint
[1:42:57] the king
[1:42:58] it becomes a crown
[1:43:01] when a man is anointed
[1:43:05] praise the lord
[1:43:06] if there is any sacred morning who says
[1:43:08] the book of james call the other and let
[1:43:10] them be anointed with oil
[1:43:13] when that order is anointed that's
[1:43:14] that's the reason why we put it right on
[1:43:16] your forehead amen
[1:43:19] we don't want to waste a whole bottle of
[1:43:20] oil
[1:43:22] praise the lord
[1:43:24] the preacher just put a tongue on your
[1:43:26] forehead what happened is that he have
[1:43:29] crowned you
[1:43:31] to be able to bring that sickness on a
[1:43:33] possession
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:38] it's just a symbol
[1:43:40] the oil do not the oil do not heal it's
[1:43:44] the word of god that heal
[1:43:46] the word of god says the sick must be
[1:43:48] anointed with oil
[1:43:52] amen
[1:43:53] the kings were anointed with oil so when
[1:43:56] the oil is pulled upon the king he has a
[1:43:59] crown
[1:44:00] he's been put into office
[1:44:04] all the other one they would do uh uh
[1:44:06] other out of those one they are just
[1:44:07] ceremony they have formality
[1:44:10] going to find a special crime and put on
[1:44:12] it is when the when the prophet has
[1:44:15] already come
[1:44:17] and he has turned down that
[1:44:20] horn of oil over your head
[1:44:22] that's all
[1:44:25] you have been crowned
[1:44:27] you have an anointing on you
[1:44:32] a positionally place you into that
[1:44:34] office
[1:44:37] praise the lord
[1:44:41] when samuel anointed david
[1:44:45] he didn't have to wait for a ceremony
[1:44:49] for them to be bringing him down it took
[1:44:51] 30 years
[1:44:53] before david would wear a crown on his
[1:44:55] head
[1:44:59] but yet he was already positionally
[1:45:02] placed as a prophet
[1:45:04] that's the reason why he could go to the
[1:45:07] battlefront and defend ezra
[1:45:09] because that was the position of the
[1:45:11] king
[1:45:12] when saul and his men were hiding under
[1:45:14] their beds
[1:45:22] for the crown of the anointing oil of
[1:45:25] his god
[1:45:26] is upon him
[1:45:30] for the crown of the anointing lord of
[1:45:33] his god
[1:45:34] is upon him
[1:45:41] toshna man
[1:45:42] anointed and do my profit
[1:45:46] no harm
[1:45:51] are we together
[1:45:55] proverb 12.
[1:46:00] i just run through some few scriptures
[1:46:01] here i already told you that i won't
[1:46:03] finish this in one day so
[1:46:08] now that i've told you i don't have to
[1:46:10] hurry up
[1:46:14] oh let's look in the book of job first
[1:46:21] job chapter 2.
[1:46:32] but i'm bringing it to a place
[1:46:36] i want for us to watch up here people
[1:46:40] praise the lord
[1:46:43] all that god will help us
[1:46:47] amen
[1:46:49] that the lord god will help us
[1:46:57] now this is this is where the bible
[1:46:59] speaks about job being crowned with
[1:47:02] bob's
[1:47:03] sickness all over his body from the
[1:47:05] sword of his foot to the crown of his
[1:47:07] head
[1:47:08] chapter 19 verse 9.
[1:47:17] the bible says he
[1:47:21] you have stripped me off my glory and
[1:47:23] taking the crown from my head
[1:47:26] because of the illness now because it's
[1:47:28] covered with sickness all over his body
[1:47:32] a familiar psalm in psalm 103
[1:47:37] so i'm just all reading all of this
[1:47:38] scripture to you to show us that there
[1:47:41] are different things in in in our lives
[1:47:43] that crown
[1:47:45] you see in the scripture how people are
[1:47:47] crowned with pride
[1:47:51] amen
[1:47:53] when people just take wickedness
[1:47:56] to be their identity
[1:48:02] psalm 103
[1:48:12] let's read this up it's a sign we can
[1:48:14] read the blessing there
[1:48:17] bless the lord o my soul and all that is
[1:48:19] with amen bless his holy name bless the
[1:48:21] lord o my soul and forget not his
[1:48:23] benefits
[1:48:25] who has forgiven all thine iniquity who
[1:48:28] have healeth all thy diseases
[1:48:31] praise the lord
[1:48:34] amen
[1:48:38] who redeemeth
[1:48:40] the life from destruction
[1:48:43] and he crowned thee
[1:48:45] with loving kindness
[1:48:48] intent of mercy
[1:48:51] he redeemed you from destruction
[1:48:54] and he he have crowned you he have
[1:48:57] rewarded us more than we have been good
[1:49:00] to him
[1:49:03] god has crowned us
[1:49:05] with loving kindness
[1:49:08] that no matter what you do he still
[1:49:10] loves you
[1:49:17] he have also crowned you with ten of
[1:49:19] mercy that he's ready to forgive your
[1:49:21] sin
[1:49:28] praise the lord
[1:49:30] what a crown to wear every day
[1:49:33] lord thank you for your loving kindness
[1:49:36] and your turn of mercy
[1:49:44] and no matter what you do he still loves
[1:49:46] you
[1:49:48] he wants you to realize that
[1:49:51] and stop what you're doing he don't love
[1:49:53] what you're doing but he loves you amen
[1:49:59] and that's the reason why his tent
[1:50:00] immersion never fell
[1:50:02] because when you're ready to repent he's
[1:50:04] ready to forgive you
[1:50:10] praise the lord
[1:50:11] the only time he would take that crown
[1:50:13] from your head
[1:50:15] when you refuse to repent and you die
[1:50:18] then he would take that crown off your
[1:50:20] head
[1:50:21] and he would crown you with joshua
[1:50:26] but as long as you are in this life
[1:50:30] you have the crown
[1:50:32] of tender mercy
[1:50:36] on your head
[1:50:44] proverb chapter 12.
[1:50:52] oh glory be to god
[1:50:56] amen
[1:51:03] proverbs 12. i'm still laying foundation
[1:51:05] i'm digging grounds people
[1:51:12] proverbs chapter 2 verse 4 a virtuous
[1:51:14] woman is a crown to her husband
[1:51:19] but she that make it ashamed
[1:51:22] is as rotiness
[1:51:25] in his bones
[1:51:26] a virtuous woman
[1:51:29] is a crown
[1:51:30] to her husband
[1:51:32] you think about abigail
[1:51:34] the bible says never he was just like
[1:51:36] his name a fool
[1:51:40] but abigail was a woman of wisdom
[1:51:45] she was a virtuous woman that was the
[1:51:47] thing that caught david hot
[1:51:49] whenever died to choose abigail just to
[1:51:52] see
[1:51:53] how so much wisdom adventurous woman she
[1:51:56] was
[1:52:00] she stood between her husband and the
[1:52:02] public
[1:52:06] praise the lord
[1:52:08] she ran to david don't mind my husband
[1:52:10] you'll be you and your man has been so
[1:52:12] nice to us
[1:52:15] i brought bread i brought wine and and
[1:52:17] and and
[1:52:19] she stole between her husband and the
[1:52:20] public
[1:52:26] she never said david you need to kill
[1:52:28] that man he's too stupid
[1:52:31] you need to cut his head off
[1:52:33] that's why he does around here
[1:52:39] no she never did that
[1:52:42] because she was a virtuous woman
[1:52:45] that's the reason why the prophet of god
[1:52:47] says your power woman is in your vector
[1:52:51] it's not in your mouth
[1:52:54] it's in your virtue
[1:53:00] praise the lord
[1:53:01] and then i throw something in here first
[1:53:04] timothy 5 8.
[1:53:05] [Laughter]
[1:53:07] a hard working man
[1:53:09] is a crown to his wife
[1:53:15] because the scripture said if a man
[1:53:17] cannot take care of his house he's worse
[1:53:19] than any feeder
[1:53:23] he has to be a provider
[1:53:26] he has to be visionary
[1:53:30] that word provide
[1:53:32] is like a seer
[1:53:37] so a hard working man
[1:53:39] is a crown
[1:53:42] because she can rest and knows that
[1:53:45] he have things under control
[1:53:48] he have things covered
[1:54:07] where are we going
[1:54:12] we are talking about the reward of
[1:54:14] crowns
[1:54:17] and some of those crowns that we were in
[1:54:19] this life
[1:54:24] praise the lord
[1:54:29] some of the crowns and most of them we
[1:54:32] were in this life it was it was it was
[1:54:34] so amazing to me i was telling last
[1:54:36] night
[1:54:37] to just there was something that came
[1:54:40] open
[1:54:42] in the scripture when you read it talks
[1:54:44] about the crown of glory
[1:54:48] praise the lord
[1:54:49] it talks about the crown of glory
[1:54:51] and uh
[1:54:53] uh thank you for joining it talks about
[1:54:55] the crown of glory
[1:54:57] but if you if you watch in the scripture
[1:55:00] you will realize that the bible never
[1:55:03] promised us a crown of glory
[1:55:06] until
[1:55:08] the chief shepherd appeared
[1:55:12] it blew my mind last night i was
[1:55:14] studying i was looking at this i was
[1:55:16] looking at this subject for over a year
[1:55:18] now
[1:55:19] you know just just looking at different
[1:55:21] things and
[1:55:24] but it's okay
[1:55:26] praise the lord
[1:55:30] amen and uh
[1:55:33] i got a little bit distracted in my mind
[1:55:35] but it's fine
[1:55:36] praise the lord
[1:55:44] you see because
[1:55:45] out of the you know this whole
[1:55:46] coronavirus thing and people loca you
[1:55:49] know corona in spanish in the latin and
[1:55:51] all of that and how it means crown and
[1:55:54] it's just like crown and you know and
[1:55:56] all of that
[1:55:57] as much as i appreciate all of those
[1:56:00] things
[1:56:01] i'm not the person that just goes into
[1:56:03] those things
[1:56:06] amen
[1:56:07] uh yeah you know i don't i don't i don't
[1:56:10] fight against it i don't doubt it
[1:56:12] you know
[1:56:13] it's just that uh i'm i'm dead with a
[1:56:16] completely different way
[1:56:18] i you know a person can preach on
[1:56:20] coronavirus and show all the crowns and
[1:56:22] show uh you know is the crown of
[1:56:24] diseases that have come upon the word
[1:56:26] and you see the whole world is affected
[1:56:28] by it and and all of that you know uh it
[1:56:32] it can be beautiful you can be able to
[1:56:33] take it out of the scripture you know uh
[1:56:36] uh
[1:56:37] there are there are men that are caught
[1:56:39] like that
[1:56:40] i mean give it to george martins
[1:56:43] he would break every letter
[1:56:46] in coronavirus and show it to you in the
[1:56:48] scripture he caught like that
[1:56:52] that's the way he is
[1:56:54] a very gifted man in topology
[1:56:57] you know i mean uh i mean uh uh
[1:57:00] sometimes i don't know how brother
[1:57:02] george does that but i'm not that way
[1:57:05] hey man i don't like to venture with our
[1:57:07] authority even though sometimes i do it
[1:57:09] [Laughter]
[1:57:13] but so i i kept i just kept trying to to
[1:57:16] hold this back and you know and look at
[1:57:19] it in a different way
[1:57:20] to be able to bring it more
[1:57:22] in a way that it will apply to us than
[1:57:25] to just talk about coronavirus amen
[1:57:28] coronavirus is now my message
[1:57:31] praise the lord
[1:57:34] so uh
[1:57:35] you know but when i was looking at this
[1:57:38] it was so beautiful and it gets right in
[1:57:41] where my my god caught i said oh god see
[1:57:44] the bible says in in isaiah 42
[1:57:47] 8 uh god says i will not share my glory
[1:57:51] with no one
[1:57:55] and when the bible talks about the crown
[1:57:57] of glory hebrew chapter uh uh
[1:58:01] a tool what the bible says you know
[1:58:05] uh uh what is man
[1:58:07] you know what is man that thou are
[1:58:09] mindful of him what the psalmist said
[1:58:13] paul picked that up in hebrew chapter 2
[1:58:16] to show that when david spoke of that in
[1:58:19] the sand he was thinking about god
[1:58:22] becoming man
[1:58:26] the bible says what is man that that was
[1:58:28] so mindful of him and that thou have
[1:58:30] crowned him with glory
[1:58:35] praise the lord
[1:58:39] but but you you see it as as a reward to
[1:58:43] the believers it's not promised
[1:58:48] is not promised until
[1:58:51] when the chief shepherd appeared
[1:58:53] that's what peter said in first peter 5
[1:58:55] 4
[1:58:57] when the chief shepherd appeared then
[1:58:59] now he would take his glory and crown us
[1:59:02] with faith
[1:59:07] god will crown us with different things
[1:59:09] in this life
[1:59:11] but now with glory because his glory he
[1:59:14] will share with no man
[1:59:25] praise the lord
[1:59:35] yeah man that god has given
[1:59:41] authoritative domain in a certain area
[1:59:45] and every child of god must be able to
[1:59:46] identify places that god has given you
[1:59:49] control over
[1:59:51] praise the lord
[1:59:53] amen
[1:59:55] now a lot of these wish hunter churches
[1:59:57] witchcraft and
[1:59:58] you know all of that
[2:00:08] we having
[2:00:12] self
[2:00:14] sin
[2:00:15] and the devil
[2:00:18] to get under control
[2:00:21] and before we leave from here all three
[2:00:23] of them
[2:00:24] will be on our feet
[2:00:27] the last enemy to get on our feet will
[2:00:30] be the devil
[2:00:32] praise the lord
[2:00:34] jesus settle the same question
[2:00:38] you have to deal with the safe question
[2:00:49] all glory be to god
[2:00:52] when the battle over we shall wear the
[2:00:54] crown
[2:00:56] amen
[2:00:58] and when we sing about that we think
[2:00:59] about they're in heaven we're talking
[2:01:01] about every battle you overcome here god
[2:01:04] crown you with grace
[2:01:07] for the next battle
[2:01:09] he crowned you with grace
[2:01:21] let's look at isaiah chapter 28 verse
[2:01:24] one then i can get into what i want to
[2:01:26] speak here now and start looking at some
[2:01:29] few things i'm just going to read
[2:01:30] scriptures quote to you this morning
[2:01:33] yeah we talk about easter you know what
[2:01:36] the bible
[2:01:37] said last week we spoke about that how
[2:01:41] how uh
[2:01:43] down in easter
[2:01:45] down in ephraim
[2:01:47] you know the two places that jeroboam
[2:01:50] built an altar
[2:01:52] you know was down in ephraim ephraim is
[2:01:54] is delta
[2:01:55] you know uh and and because of that
[2:01:58] because they took in idolatry and that's
[2:02:01] the reason why you know that the reward
[2:02:04] was taken from them
[2:02:07] amen
[2:02:08] the athlete reward was taken from them
[2:02:10] that's why in revelation chapter seven
[2:02:12] they were not counted in the tribes
[2:02:16] yeah i read a quote to you where brother
[2:02:17] braham says your crown can be taken from
[2:02:19] you
[2:02:31] the attitude how you deal with things
[2:02:36] how you deal with things especially when
[2:02:38] god lays something on your path
[2:02:45] trusting and believing that you have
[2:02:47] come to a maturity to be a son of god
[2:02:49] and to be able to look at that thing as
[2:02:52] a child of god will look at it you allow
[2:02:55] it to get under the sleeves of your
[2:02:56] flesh and you deal with it fleshly
[2:03:08] well
[2:03:09] this message
[2:03:11] is not to make church members is to
[2:03:14] prepare the people
[2:03:16] for glory land
[2:03:27] isaiah 28 verse 1
[2:03:30] let's read that
[2:03:34] amen
[2:03:36] woe to the crown of pride
[2:03:41] to the drunkard of ephraim
[2:03:45] you see in the old testament time right
[2:03:47] under there after that period of time
[2:03:49] how ephraim went into idolatry
[2:03:54] how how the broad idols into into their
[2:03:58] land
[2:04:07] and they were crowned with pride
[2:04:11] the beginning
[2:04:13] of every fall
[2:04:16] is pride
[2:04:18] the beginning of every fall
[2:04:24] it's proud
[2:04:25] when a man or a woman
[2:04:28] is crowned with pride
[2:04:31] you have just docked your grave
[2:04:34] with your teeth
[2:04:36] because your life is going to go in
[2:04:38] constant descending order
[2:04:41] no matter how much you try
[2:04:44] because pride
[2:04:46] is the beginning of every fall
[2:04:57] so people life can be crowned with pride
[2:05:02] some people are crowned with wickedness
[2:05:05] weakness
[2:05:07] and we've seen the oil around us
[2:05:14] weakness
[2:05:24] all the shooting spreading all the evil
[2:05:26] that is going on
[2:05:28] and that's the crowning of this age
[2:05:32] the crowning of this age
[2:05:36] is a grounding of wickedness
[2:05:47] people can be crowned with pride
[2:05:52] amen
[2:05:55] they can be crowned i mean that just all
[2:05:57] sorts of things this
[2:06:05] let's read the united not entitlement
[2:06:07] sign
[2:06:09] one of the the the harmless things
[2:06:12] to see
[2:06:13] is a man or a woman constantly
[2:06:16] complaining
[2:06:19] constantly complaining complaining about
[2:06:22] everything
[2:06:25] everything
[2:06:28] the sun is too hot
[2:06:32] the wind is blowing too fast
[2:06:35] complain about everything
[2:06:40] the gear in the eye
[2:06:42] warmer they are complaining
[2:06:45] how did they pack this thing what does
[2:06:46] that concern you pick your thing and go
[2:07:00] i've always thought god keep me from it
[2:07:06] thou weakens faith
[2:07:08] complaining weakens
[2:07:11] fate
[2:07:14] awakens fate
[2:07:18] when we complain
[2:07:22] we are not giving we are not giving
[2:07:24] ourselves an opportunity to see the
[2:07:26] supernatural
[2:07:33] that we can face all the time you know
[2:07:37] i know
[2:07:38] as as uh the guests order each one of us
[2:07:42] we are going to we are going to get uh
[2:07:46] something happening
[2:07:48] and something happened
[2:07:50] now watch this now watch this you got
[2:07:52] you got to watch this
[2:07:55] as you get older
[2:08:05] i lied because the older one other guy
[2:08:07] says
[2:08:08] he says he says life is just like
[2:08:12] you know uh
[2:08:14] it is just like uh
[2:08:16] uh you know tissue paper
[2:08:19] he says when it gets to the end of the
[2:08:21] road it rolls faster
[2:08:26] that's an older guy told me like that
[2:08:28] he said son that's how life is
[2:08:32] you gotta wash up he says you know as as
[2:08:35] as we get older we are going to have
[2:08:38] something
[2:08:39] happening
[2:08:43] because you are getting to the weakness
[2:08:46] of your strength
[2:08:48] even spiritually
[2:08:50] you are strong in the spirit but in this
[2:08:53] body
[2:08:54] something will happen
[2:08:57] and something will happen
[2:09:02] that's the reason why you have to guide
[2:09:04] your heart
[2:09:07] and don't let those things happening
[2:09:10] to crush your spirit
[2:09:12] because a wounded spirit who can heal
[2:09:24] something happened and something
[2:09:26] happened and i know
[2:09:28] those little things are going to keep
[2:09:31] accumulating
[2:09:34] all the digits
[2:09:37] and it just it just throws you off
[2:09:41] throw you off yeah i used to be in that
[2:09:44] church and it did it and and this other
[2:09:46] and they did i mean and all of those
[2:09:48] things would just throw you off
[2:09:52] you got to take your eyes from all men
[2:09:56] keep your eyes on the lord jesus christ
[2:10:05] because things are going to happen
[2:10:09] things will keep happening
[2:10:14] praise the lord
[2:10:16] amen
[2:10:18] oh
[2:10:19] it looks like when when when that when
[2:10:22] when when that when the when the lord is
[2:10:23] blessing the assembly it looks like you
[2:10:25] see all of these things and you feel
[2:10:27] happy about it but i don't feel happy
[2:10:30] i thank the lord
[2:10:32] but then i have to keep watching because
[2:10:34] i know things will happen
[2:10:39] people come from different places
[2:10:42] different way things were done
[2:10:48] things will happen
[2:10:50] and those little things will keep
[2:10:52] accumulating
[2:10:58] that as you get older
[2:11:03] they just got tall
[2:11:05] but i think one of the most
[2:11:08] horrible things it's for satan to crown
[2:11:13] some person's life
[2:11:17] to be crabby
[2:11:20] to be crabby
[2:11:24] all the building is too hot
[2:11:26] all the building is too cold all the
[2:11:28] sound is too loud all the sound is all
[2:11:31] there
[2:11:35] praise the lord
[2:11:42] he says for satan to crown some person's
[2:11:46] life a crowded old man or the krabble or
[2:11:49] woman
[2:11:50] i hope i don't get to that place
[2:11:54] i hope that i can bear it
[2:11:58] as my burden
[2:12:00] and get to the spot where uh i i i i
[2:12:04] want my life crowned
[2:12:07] with the glory of god
[2:12:09] no matter what is happening i hope i can
[2:12:12] bear it
[2:12:15] i hope i can be patient with people
[2:12:19] because if you don't take time
[2:12:21] the devil will crown your life
[2:12:24] with unforgiving spirits
[2:12:29] i don't want to even see the ground they
[2:12:31] walk on you make the ground
[2:12:35] you made a ground you are walking on
[2:12:49] you don't want to sit on crown in your
[2:12:50] life
[2:12:54] you don't want him crowning your life
[2:12:59] praise the lord
[2:13:03] with all with all this
[2:13:05] uh uh uh uh uh a word you know
[2:13:10] uh social reality
[2:13:14] making things making on saying things
[2:13:16] real to you
[2:13:22] you don't want the devil crown in your
[2:13:24] life
[2:13:26] where you can have more fun on your
[2:13:28] phone
[2:13:30] then to actually have fun with real
[2:13:32] people
[2:13:33] you get more laughter on your phone
[2:13:39] and they set you among people you sit
[2:13:41] down like a stonewalled
[2:13:50] you don't want the devil crown in your
[2:13:52] life
[2:13:59] where you are so crabbit you complain
[2:14:01] about everything can never be satisfied
[2:14:13] oh
[2:14:15] this make us to watch ourself
[2:14:18] i would rather be crowned in this life
[2:14:20] with patience than to wait for a gold
[2:14:23] crown
[2:14:24] on the other side i'd rather be crowned
[2:14:27] in this life
[2:14:29] with the grace of god i would rather
[2:14:31] look for that crown
[2:14:44] flashing red light he went into the same
[2:14:46] line of touch here
[2:14:48] one of the most
[2:14:50] miserable thing is to see a man or a
[2:14:52] woman
[2:14:54] who's never accepted
[2:14:57] christ
[2:14:58] and just laid
[2:15:01] an old
[2:15:03] most back church member i don't even
[2:15:05] know where he get this voice from
[2:15:14] steve you from kentucky
[2:15:20] okay you have to tell me even if
[2:15:23] pronouncing i don't know what it is
[2:15:28] oh stagnant
[2:15:31] okay
[2:15:41] a morse back church member
[2:15:43] meaner than satan
[2:15:52] oh my goodness
[2:16:01] the bible says he's the father of all
[2:16:03] lives i don't know how can you lie more
[2:16:05] than satan
[2:16:08] he's supposed to be the most meanest man
[2:16:10] i don't know how can you be more meaner
[2:16:12] than satan
[2:16:13] but let's go right ahead here it's just
[2:16:15] dragging the taut amen
[2:16:17] it's just for us to be able to grab a
[2:16:18] thought here may not then sit on himself
[2:16:24] and see how the
[2:16:27] crab
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:29] at
[2:16:30] all something well i tell you i don't
[2:16:32] believe in this
[2:16:34] you know and and uh
[2:16:36] there's there's
[2:16:38] uh
[2:16:39] the horrible crown that satan can crown
[2:16:42] a life wave
[2:16:46] it's a groundcheek old woman
[2:16:48] after 60 or 70 years old
[2:16:55] with fats hanging on her arm
[2:16:58] and wrinkle all over her face
[2:17:02] and her head
[2:17:06] bump up in four or five different colors
[2:17:10] praise the lord
[2:17:14] amen
[2:17:17] glory be to god
[2:17:22] now it is it sounds funny
[2:17:25] as we all can you know uh
[2:17:28] you know laugh but
[2:17:30] he's he's dragging to a point
[2:17:32] right he's trying to make a point
[2:17:35] he's not really trying to be rude
[2:17:38] but he's just trying to create a scene
[2:17:43] for us to be able to grab a point
[2:17:50] amen
[2:17:53] you find people
[2:17:57] in that place
[2:18:00] i have to have a quote here where
[2:18:01] brother graham talks about people
[2:18:04] that are crowned
[2:18:07] with denominational creeds
[2:18:11] that hotel
[2:18:14] they just hold to that denomination of
[2:18:16] greed
[2:18:20] as long as i believe the message
[2:18:26] it's more than their people
[2:18:31] it's more than that
[2:18:33] what do you want you want to believe it
[2:18:35] or not we have made creeds for ourselves
[2:18:39] that people watch what you say
[2:18:42] when you speak their language that's my
[2:18:44] guide
[2:18:50] but let's get into this a little bit
[2:18:52] yeah brother branham talking about this
[2:18:54] and he's describing this scene and
[2:18:56] talking about this person
[2:18:59] you know that uh that is having you know
[2:19:02] just this stagnant
[2:19:04] uh church member life
[2:19:07] and uh and it just mean and now you know
[2:19:11] and yeah
[2:19:12] crap at everything
[2:19:14] you know it's it's not a problem for
[2:19:16] them to swear
[2:19:18] you know say curse word when they get
[2:19:20] angry
[2:19:22] you know just a grouchy old person and
[2:19:25] uh you get grungy young people too
[2:19:28] praise the lord
[2:19:30] you know then they are just like that
[2:19:32] you know well uh i mean
[2:19:35] and uh you know he gets down to this
[2:19:37] place and and you know about their head
[2:19:39] and and four different different colors
[2:19:42] you know i thought about basing and uh
[2:19:45] you know when and you know i know it is
[2:19:49] kind of
[2:19:50] sensitive to our our sisters and all of
[2:19:53] that you know but like brother branham
[2:19:55] says you know uh i mean uh
[2:19:58] uh
[2:19:59] be decent
[2:20:00] praise the lord
[2:20:02] amen
[2:20:03] be decent
[2:20:06] but all of these things were
[2:20:08] i mean
[2:20:10] today you look like a japanese
[2:20:14] and tomorrow you look korean
[2:20:18] praise the lord
[2:20:21] and then you just want a purple hair to
[2:20:23] just roll in the midst of that
[2:20:25] i mean it's it's just crazy
[2:20:29] just be decent so we can be able to
[2:20:31] identify you all the time
[2:20:35] don't come to church and i think it's a
[2:20:37] stranger i'm i'm trying to introduce a
[2:20:39] stranger

[2:20:42] is part of this church
[2:20:46] just be decent
[2:20:48] that we can identify you
[2:20:51] i leave it just as that
[2:21:01] he says in four different colors
[2:21:04] and and and wearing a pair of shots if
[2:21:07] that earned the crowning of satan
[2:21:10] why would a person want to dress like
[2:21:12] that

[2:24:30] service and he crowned you that way
[2:24:39] you have people that are just generous
[2:24:48] god crowned then god blessed him that
[2:24:50] way
[2:24:51] because he knows that he can always use
[2:24:54] them
[2:24:56] to be able to minister to others
[2:25:03] while some i keep looking and i mean
[2:25:05] they are trying to gather every penny in
[2:25:07] the dust
[2:25:12] and this man that god has blessed
[2:25:14] and crowned with this life does not even
[2:25:16] have the money
[2:25:20] it's not the money that god looks for to
[2:25:22] use is the heart
[2:25:25] he looks for the heart
[2:25:27] the man or the woman that has the heart
[2:25:33] he don't look at your bank account
[2:25:34] before he use you
[2:25:36] you look at how much your heart is
[2:25:38] before the altar
[2:25:41] how much your heart is giving to him
[2:25:44] lord i want you i want more of you
[2:25:47] that's what he looks at
[2:25:55] oh my satan
[2:25:57] don't crown our life
[2:25:59] especially in this time that we are
[2:26:01] living
[2:26:03] some people are so crowned they're

[2:30:19] soul to save
[2:30:22] oh i feel ashamed of but i like to talk

[2:30:25] he he sparked me up

[2:30:39] some of the things that god
[2:30:41] will cry in the man life is now the
[2:30:42] things that are then done in the public
[2:30:45] is now the things that is done before
[2:30:47] everybody
[2:30:49] it's not when you are looking for name
[2:30:51] when you're looking for name god can i
[2:30:53] associate his name with you but if you
[2:30:55] don't have a name then he can give you a
[2:30:57] name
[2:31:11] praise the
[2:31:12] lord
[2:31:14] amen
[2:31:28] i have four minutes to one teddy
[2:31:31] i don't feel like stopping
[2:31:36] but i have to give give you
[2:31:39] time to think over this because just
[2:31:42] like i said we can get through this
[2:31:45] today
[2:31:47] amen
[2:31:50] we can get through this today
[2:31:56] but let me read this present stage of my
[2:31:58] ministry
[2:32:00] now
[2:32:01] is usually such a time
[2:32:05] as this
[2:32:06] when man has stayed true to the word and
[2:32:10] all men has forsaken him
[2:32:12] until god steps in his defense
[2:32:17] in defense of that person and crown his
[2:32:20] ministry
[2:32:22] praise the lord
[2:32:24] amen
[2:32:30] sometimes it's not
[2:32:32] in the heat of it
[2:32:36] sometimes it looks like
[2:32:39] when the person is not even doing
[2:32:40] nothing
[2:32:46] god comes back and crown you because of
[2:32:49] what you did that day
[2:33:06] that's right what a consolation
[2:33:11] a consolation is built
[2:33:14] in the promise of god you know when paul
[2:33:18] wrote to timothy that was his last
[2:33:20] letter that he ever wrote
[2:33:22] that a crown of life awaits me he was in
[2:33:25] prison
[2:33:27] waiting to be beheaded
[2:33:32] i found a good fight when he said that
[2:33:34] statement i have fought a good fight
[2:33:38] and the crown of life awaits me he was
[2:33:40] imprisoned
[2:33:42] waiting to be beheaded
[2:33:50] praise the lord
[2:33:53] but yet
[2:33:54] you will see the courage he had
[2:33:57] to be able
[2:33:59] to encourage the saints and tell timothy
[2:34:01] let no man despise your youth
[2:34:04] and then he kept he kept teaching him
[2:34:06] and and telling him the things that he
[2:34:08] that he that he's supposed to do to be a
[2:34:10] good stealer
[2:34:15] he was comforting the saints
[2:34:20] praise the lord
[2:34:21] he was comforting the saints
[2:34:25] but yet he was waiting to be beheaded
[2:34:31] he was still right there and says well
[2:34:34] i've i've i've been here and nope too
[2:34:36] many times you have not even called me i
[2:34:38] need your comfort you know so i would
[2:34:40] die that would soon kill me
[2:34:43] a lever for you people i preach and
[2:34:45] nobody send me even an email no text
[2:34:48] message oh my goodness
[2:34:51] no that was not paul
[2:34:53] hey
[2:34:54] he was not a crabbit old
[2:34:56] man he was a man that stick to his
[2:34:59] calling he stick with the words
[2:35:13] praise the lord
[2:35:19] an age where
[2:35:22] it's so hard to find
[2:35:24] people that want to do things for the
[2:35:26] lord
[2:35:27] we only look for things
[2:35:30] that will be done for us
[2:35:40] encourage a man to church he gets angry
[2:35:42] with you
[2:35:50] praise the lord
[2:36:00] clearly be to god
[2:36:04] but you think about it
[2:36:06] we'll close with this
[2:36:09] i'll pick it up another time
[2:36:14] water consolation
[2:36:16] is built
[2:36:17] in the promise of god's word no matter
[2:36:19] what the word says
[2:36:22] what the word does
[2:36:27] this
[2:36:29] net our hope but is built in what
[2:36:34] is not built in what the world does
[2:36:38] then i just i just i just pick out these
[2:36:40] cults and intrude them in like this
[2:36:43] jesus
[2:36:46] he was crowned it
[2:36:49] he crowned it on easter morning on the
[2:36:52] resurrection
[2:36:55] that was where his ministry was crowned
[2:36:57] why because he says i had the power to
[2:36:59] live my life down
[2:37:01] and to pick it up again
[2:37:06] praise the lord
[2:37:07] it was not a crown where he was sitting
[2:37:09] and and praised before everybody
[2:37:14] no it was when he went through his
[2:37:16] darkest hour
[2:37:28] elijah
[2:37:30] he crowned his ministry with a cherish
[2:37:33] that took him to heaven
[2:37:38] that was the crown of his ministry
[2:37:41] that he got angelic ascot
[2:37:44] [Laughter]
[2:37:46] there brother branham said i will not
[2:37:47] allow you to walk like in elijah
[2:37:50] i will send an escort for you
[2:37:52] [Laughter]
[2:37:56] praise the lord
[2:37:58] the way we think about crown
[2:38:02] for every eyes to be on us
[2:38:06] our cheeks up
[2:38:15] that's not how god thinks about crowning
[2:38:17] his people
[2:38:24] daniel god sealed his ministry
[2:38:27] in the lion's den
[2:38:32] his ministry was sealed in the lion's
[2:38:34] den
[2:38:37] when he came out
[2:38:39] the king charged the whole world to
[2:38:42] worship the god of daniel
[2:38:45] that was the crowning of his ministry
[2:38:52] your life reaching to the place where is
[2:38:54] affecting people positively
[2:39:02] you're talking about the lord and
[2:39:03] encouraging them to church you're giving
[2:39:04] them an invitation
[2:39:06] you don't want to make a church memo out
[2:39:07] of them you just you're just telling
[2:39:09] them
[2:39:17] that's why we can be a witness because i
[2:39:18] mean we we are so consumed and involved
[2:39:23] about ourselves
[2:39:33] jacob from us
[2:39:35] as a planter
[2:39:36] a
[2:39:37] her
[2:39:38] to the prince of god when he walked out
[2:39:40] the next morning
[2:39:42] with his ministry crown
[2:39:46] he was crowned as a prince but yet he
[2:39:48] was sleeping
[2:39:51] but god has crowned his ministry
[2:39:55] by breaking his legs
[2:40:06] god's servants that stay true to the
[2:40:08] word
[2:40:10] that god sealed their ministry
[2:40:13] with a crown in time
[2:40:15] that would be this time
[2:40:17] in our life
[2:40:21] where god
[2:40:22] will do something special
[2:40:25] and see i've seen the longing of my son
[2:40:31] see the love he had for me and i see the
[2:40:33] sacrifice
[2:40:36] i see the way that he have supported
[2:40:39] the work of god
[2:40:40] the ministry
[2:40:42] i've seen
[2:40:43] the life of dedication
[2:40:48] that he thought a time of devotion
[2:40:53] thou come and crown him
[2:40:56] with grace
[2:40:58] that the things
[2:41:00] that we're looking so big
[2:41:03] and it looks like the soul matter
[2:41:05] you realize oh my goodness thank you
[2:41:07] jesus
[2:41:10] the devil can come and throw things in
[2:41:12] and break everything around he said
[2:41:14] glory be to god you give it and you take
[2:41:17] it away blessed be the name of the lord
[2:41:20] he can come and start throwing
[2:41:21] everything down making this to happen
[2:41:23] you say thank you jesus
[2:41:25] you are in control
[2:41:28] praise the lord that's why brother
[2:41:29] branham says god can get a man to a
[2:41:31] place that the devil can look for him
[2:41:34] and can never find him
[2:41:38] because he saw hate in god
[2:41:42] that everything that the devil destroys
[2:41:44] his way
[2:41:45] just make him to sin much louder
[2:41:49] he just go another key higher glory
[2:41:52] thank you jesus
[2:41:58] not just the devil just oh my goodness
[2:42:04] it's time to possess
[2:42:07] paul says i bring this body on a
[2:42:09] subjection
[2:42:14] at least i preach and become a castaway
[2:42:21] i subject myself to the word
[2:42:25] be it unto me according to your word
[2:42:27] lord
[2:42:34] i rather have the crown of grace in this
[2:42:37] life

[2:43:04] musicians you can come
[2:43:12] verb i'm talking here then saying i hope
[2:43:15] he will crown my ministry with this
[2:43:18] of letting me to take the cloth of the
[2:43:20] word and to dress his bride
[2:43:24] in the clothes of the word
[2:43:27] for his righteousness i hope he will
[2:43:29] crown me
[2:43:30] and let me stand there on that day
[2:43:32] saying behold the lamb of god
