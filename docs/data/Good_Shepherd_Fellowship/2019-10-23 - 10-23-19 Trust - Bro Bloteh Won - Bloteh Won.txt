we had a good service and brother brother Ben and here all preached the first service the first night and then brother clay took the second service and then brother brother Brooks closed the meeting on Sunday praise the Lord so it was a wonderful meeting and we were glad to be part to be there to support the brothers amen praise the Lord so it's good to be home we heard that you had a blast on Sunday praise the Lord and we thank the Lord for bringing the blast him in praise the Lord hallelujah you know Burroughs was preaching on Sunday and he was talking a little bit there on creation and then he was talking about he make mention about a big The Big Bang Theory and then he mentioned brother Branham on Bourbon MCS you know when one of those times went out in the beginning and and and God says stopped and a stopped right there and why he was saying that in my mind I was saying when it's when when the start stop or the planet or whatever it was that came out when it stopped right there it might have made a sound maybe that was the sound that Einstein heard and called it a Big Bang it surely make a bang amen praise the Lord but we want to also remind you we spoke about finding the dead to visit with sister Jackie I think the last time she came many of her folks were very concerned you know what kind of a church in Minneapolis that would send a driver to come and pick you up and drive you to Minneapolis and bring you back you know I don't know what other thing we are aliens we are human beings say man we just love the Lord and we love the people that love the Lord so she sent us she sent a report that you know there are some loved ones I want to see these kind of a people and so I think is the second of November there should be the first Saturday and for a few of us that can be able to make it we will confirm the date again on Sunday as we try to talk to her in a week and we've been sending our most of our communication through system now I mean she's been happiness and so we will confirm that but we just want to get down there you know and just and just support our sister you know you know she's she loved the Lord and in the age where she is and you know and she been going to you know a Baptist Church to everybody know her in in the little town and Jackie that just have the call her amen the elderly woman that refused to wear paints you know then she having social repetition amen amen so we just want to get out there you know the little weekend and and last Wednesday brother Lord share his testimony of meeting those people you know and and then right after that Thursday brother Wesley called me you know one of the eye appliances went down in the house I guess the dish wash or something like that and they brought someone to come in and we you know help them repair it and it turned out the same experience but Aloha they had the same experience you know talking about the Lord and these people have had you know miracles and different things you know so it was it was such a blessing now in my mind what I'm thinking about is there there's there's just a feeling in the air you know that's what I'm thinking in my mind you know something is happening I don't know what it is you know I'm not going to port on interpretation to it but I just believe that in this in this Glenny time you know because the harvest is over we are in the Glenny time in this cleaning time there is one more seed that can be pick up from somewhere Amen praise the Lord every day that that roof went over to borås field she just believed that she's going to get a handful before she come home amen even though Boris come Anna he's meant to surprise her but she didn't know where the surprise would be you know it could be up the hill it could be down here it could be on the side way but the thing about it is that when she was leaving the house she knew that she will not come back with empty hand amen she's going to get something and that's and that is the faith we want to hold in this hour praise the Lord we're now reaching out with great campaigns healing campaigns and and we don't we don't doubt that God can net he lo hiciste in the healing business because healing is his attribute and because it's his attribute is the children's bread amen and but we still believe that God can use your life for the witness amen he can use you know whatever it pleases him to use praise the Lord so like I said we will remind you on Sunday again and actually as we kind of all confirmed with our sister you know those of you that can make it just pray for we that would be there we just want to get out there to be able to encourage her amen praise the Lord and we would do that for any of the any of the believers that we want us to do that for them so the Lord bless you tonight thank you musicians like I said I've been having this little thought on my mind I want to take tonight on trust praise the Lord now this message I'm coming to preach tonight it's not more of a message it's a prayer request and in the person I want you to pray for it's me praise the Lord I'm at a place were I'm you know I'm I I want to trust the Lord amen yeah there are a lot of things that are coming on my on my mind on my heartin and I need to trust God you know to be able to step out by faith so I want to talk a little bit on trust tonight and let's just stand on our feet I will use brother branham message laying that onto your own understanding as as as an inspiration and and also we will read from the scripture so let's get in the bulk of proverb praise the law let's get in the book of Proverbs I have a chapter over in the book of of Sam but let's let's take the book of proverbs praise the Lord Amy in proverbs chapter 3 praise the Lord and as I was thinking on the subject tonight coming on my way coming - to church law started helping me to kind of a look I hear a little bit different so proverbs chapter 3 and let's just take verse 5 we can read from verse 1 you know to verse 5 my son forget now the Lord but let the heart keep his combining for length of days and long life in peace shall be r2d let not mercy and truth forsake being bound them about that neck you remember the bounding power he meant bounded about a night write write them upon the table of the heart so shod I found favor and good understanding in the sight of in the sight of God amen praise the Lord trust in the Lord with all thine heart amen can we just read there together to nine verse five and six trust in the Lord with all thine heart and laying that on to thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct that path let's pray together father that's what we want to do Lord that's what we want to do Oh God we can just pause like David's a seller trust in the Lord with all thine heart we just actually blessing upon you tonight father it's not a message that we can preach it's an experience that we want you to bring us to the days are getting darker Lord the word is no longer like it used to be teach us to trust you even when there is nothing to hold on we want to trust you even when there is no answer we want to trust you coming bless us tonight father you know where my heart is I pray the Lord you just get us out of the way to night in and bring your word for the few minutes that is before us bless us in your presence in Jesus name Amen Allah bless you you may have you see praise the Lord years ago I remember one of the time I might have preached it when I was a you know pastor in our little group there in the Ivory Coast but I remember one time I was over in Algeria and then you know I was taking a couple of services but then I used someone 18 verse 8 and and I've always believed with lot of the research that I did that that was the center verse of the Bible but recently I went back to check on it again and I've seen a lot of different information that that is not the center of verse of the Bible but I'm not going to go into into argument and research and all that but why we said tonight is that that mind central verse of the Bible amen praise the Lord it is my central verse of the Bible so let's just read that there's some 118 some one one eight you know I had all of this thing I just wrote it down one that I was going to preach you know and I just said what I've just found something to speak to the people on and I was just trying to use that as a saint a thing but that's that's what I want to just read tonight like I did like Davis said the sam says here it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes praise the Lord amen I don't know about you but that's how I feel I feel I was talking to brother Ezekiel had time to spend with him as we drive you know we had a good fellowship we really had a good time together and so as we will go in a lawn I told me I said Tony my sis I said brother I want you to pray for me to have a prayer request you know I just feeling in my heart that I need to trust the Lord praise Lord amen so like I said tonight if you if you want to get there with me let's get there together praise the Lord but let's let's preciate a little bit I mean and and broadband and precious message laying there unto your own understanding and and there are a few things that he spoke about thee I want to go back a little bit but why why I took that message as as as as an inspiration to bring this thing out to us tonight is because as I was as I was studying I realized that there is a there is a Hebrew word there for trust that also means to lean amen it means to lean so then I told on a tour analysis world here Solomon year saying you know trust in the Lord with all your heart don't trust your own understanding amen praise the Lord now washing now he didn't I said don't trust your understanding he said don't trust your own understanding praise the Lord because there are a lot of things we understand by revelation we understand and by experience praise the Lord but when it comes to a being our all understanding then is when we are trying to interpret the situation I think that's what Solomon was warning us against amen let's wait let God interpret the situation remember we were talking about the three things that we must not do we must not you know misinterpret the word we must not misinterpret what God is doing in our lives around our lives let's just wait this vision we speak for itself praise the Lord God has bear with us let's bear with him a little bit are we together now so there are some few things that that brother Branham said in in introduction of this message and I want to I want to use their tonight I never even Acts if if if I were not go back to you a little bit but I sure we did so Lynette unto thine own understanding he said here written by Solomon one of the wisest man in the world outside of our Lord Jesus but he wasn't exactly like Solomon and so much that Solomon was a man born of a woman praise the Lord and was begotten by an earthly father David but Jesus was a virgin born son and was not altogether a man but he was God he was the god man and he was more than a man he he was a man plus E but Solomon was just a man like you and I and he asked God for wisdom now this is the thing that kind of a struck me and I was trade a little bit here but let's just let just stay together and I will leave this and then I will go back to crisis the mystery of God revealed because this thing hit me and what it is is their brother Brennan said in crisis the mystery of God revealed a scroll was bringing out his great mystery he wrote some in the heavens amen he wrote some in times in shadow and he also wrote some in the lives of the prophets their very lives of the prophets amen they were living their lives but yet they were clearing a mystery now as I thought about that I thought in my mind what mystery was Solomon carrying because we know that Solomon is a mystery look at his birth amen and and according to Scripture Solomon was not the favorite oh yeah let's look at some scriptures here tonight praise the Lord 2nd Kings chapter 13 are we together settle came chapter 13 praise the Lord in any and you and you know with all the disgrace that's the absolute broad on David David still not that boy if you look at it naturally naturally with the way that David has Solomon his heart whenever to Solomon to sit on his throne summer birth was a disgrace to David in every way yes Solomon himself was innocent amen praise the Lord does that not happen sometimes with some parents they go through some things and have a child and at the time they are going through their struggle or that difficulty and this child is coming along and at some times after they have the tribe this starts to hit the child because they suffer during having the child o when we are we were having this child I mean we never have so no food to eat I mean it's almost like the child brought bad luck when the child is innocent praise Allah the child is innocent so if you just look at you just just look at it a little bit you realize that if God only have spoken to David it would have never been David choice praise the Lord when job I killed Absalom David was greedy Davey was angry this is the son Absalom that kick him off the throne this is the very son was not in mind in our salon he got I thought fair he was he were gathering David counselor he was grabbing all the men they knew how to get David because he knew if he could get Debbie he will reign now let's go here a little bit second Kings chapter 13 it's not what I said okay I have to find out whether that's what I mean I mean I said a lot of things I don't mean it and you have been gracious to bear with me Amen praise the Lord amen second Kings chapter tithing let's read verse 37 a little bit here and Absalom fled and went to to Telma the son of a mean whole king of Joseph and Devi mourn for his son everything praise the Lord what did I say I said second king oh praise the Lord it was good that I confess I mean second Samuel Amy I mean second Samuel I told you I always say things I don't mean it second Samuel amen second Samuel 13 verse 37 it speaks here of how David mourn for his son amen are you in second Samuel okay this speaks of how David moon for his son let's go to chapter 15 chapter 15 verse 6 they that's a second Samia I mean second Samuel okay praise the Lord verse 6 he said and and all the manner did Absalom and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so Absalon stole the heart of the men of Israel I mean Absalon stole the heart of the men of Israel then I was kind of checking in because I this was just right on my mind before I came out of the office and so I started looking because there's a place where the Bible speaks of the heart of the people being after Absalom I mean he won the heart of the people praise the Lord and it was it was just for the very fact that there was a big question mark on the birth of Solomon praise the Lord are we together verse 13 of the same chapter 15 verse 13 and there came a messenger to David saying the heart of the men of Israel after Absalom this is net this is net before a Solomon it was right there from from from you know from the beginning the Lord has already started dealing with David and letting even know that you know Solomon will be the one that would that will build him a house and you know in all of this the law started dealing with with David already praise the Lord but you see here is a conflict now I want to see this conflict in the life of David and if you can see it with me tonight here is David there he loved his boys Absalon if I were even speaks all the appearance of Absalom he was this boy with with with a big afro amen because his hair got caught in the tree he was a ham song God his very appearance was appealing praise the Lord now you have to realize there David birth I mean Solomon birth was a mistake amen and by the order of the children arsalan was there before Solomon are we together so you can reseed they're all alone as David was traveling in his journey his mind was on absolute his heart was on Absalom this is a this is a man that can be able to command that split the army off of his father he has some leadership ability in him I mean you mean if he could appeal to the heart of the men of Israel there was something in this boy maybe that was what David saw in his and he loved actually I mean he grieved he grieved agreed on tell draw up how to go and take an old woman to come and win the heart of David she disguised herself and she came and she started crying - David all kings saved my son King saved my son she should just bill all the story until she was able to draw David out of mourning with a concern for her son when didn't realize that he was caught in a trap he said to me Joe up for you to do this are we together tonight but what am I trying to bring here is that there was something the entire birth of Solomon was holding a mystery some of those mystery that was written in the lives of the prophets that would benefit you and myself I mean some of God's children will now be born in holy wedlock some of God's children God predestinated seed will be I just I was just listening to so a brother that was talking telling the testimony and you know let me go ahead at because my mind is trying to run into that but what am I trying to say that is that there will be there will be a lot of situation around God's people life and as the Old Testament it's a shadow the types and shadows are there the lives of the prophets and the different people that God used God will put something in their life to be able to show and one of the things that was aimed Solomon life was the hidden wisdom of God and that was the reason why when Solomon asked God for wisdom it pleased him because that was the thing that was hidden in his life the hidden wisdom of God you might not find it in the Bible maybe the Prophet said nothing about it but God had a Haiti wisdom praise the Lord you know every good teacher there is a little piece that they don't give out amen they can teach this they can teach this they can teach this but they would keep a little piece a little recipe just to be able to show that they are and God has a hidden wisdom amen when we think that we have come to know all there is there's something yet that we don't know there is there's something here that we don't know and that's what God hid in the life of Solomon hidden wisdom praise the Lord his his wisdom that confound the wise his wisdom that were pulled all the the Pharisee describes the man knows the Lord rather the Lord of Moses backside and they be ready I'm sat down but when they stand before Solomon becoming a king how can we reconcile that with the Lord how can we reconcile that with the Lord of Moses praise the Lord God never only told David God back it up he never only told David he back it up even at the dedication of the temple a I've never been it was not in the tabernacle of Moses God came down the people who see it they could read it it was in a class it was visible everybody can hit a man but when God is with that man God will back him up God will always back his children all we're always back the things that he himself has designed in our lives praise the Lord God will allow David to go into one of the the the I mean the most shameful part of his life just to use their to be able to bring out his hidden wisdom praise the Lord how I could miss me somebody would mean tonight praise the Lord we can just stop right here and just think about their all night long that God will allow you to go in some of the most shameful behavior just to show he's hating wisdom to you praise the Lord what Branham say a year in crisis the minister of God revealed I realized I'm dealing with time year I would together man he said this he I mean he talks about the the life of the prophets he says here he said yeah he says all those things tied him but yet the mistress the mystery was here there men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now hold it back in the in in the last day for the great revelation which means God held back the understanding of their very life their wish of course which mean we understand their lives better than they did are we together now and and this is the man Solomon he could feed it and Solomon was making what honor his brother tried to do he tried to talk to Bell Sheba because she was a stranger she was a stranger look at her birth line she was not a daughter of Israel she was a stranger she was a Gentile woman so you can just you think about the complex that was around that is the reason why when I saw my brother came to him and was making a request he went to he went to the mother because what she knows her life story everybody talked about her she want to gain some favor she went to Solomon okay can't you please do this for your brother Solomon had to stand as a man and say mama you wait you wait I know you you are everybody mother but right now I'm the king I'm the one have to run decision yeah but all of those things is because of some of the complex the life present us but when a man has found when he has fine himself in the plan of God when he have high grades to understand that God has brought him through what he were brought through for a reason amen you can never take stand for God's Word until you understand what God is doing if you shall paralyze Joshua verbatim says you can never have faith in a situation I'll tell you honesty praise the Lord so you just think about it the complex situation I live present him in the things that he have to deal with and everybody talking about his mother everybody they're getting us on story about his birthing and you know I mean she they went down she pressed her to her said they said that about her that since there's about and said it's about how and yeah this is the man they have to be sitting on the throne no wonder I'm so uncle Wayne an easy campaign he could just use all of my birth and run around the town and win the hearts of the people can't you see can't you see this is injustice can't you see I've been in the house go back to the prodigal son go back to the prodigal son I'm the senior brother I've been in the house before this one was born out of a dart tray to come here and become king can't you see how he could win the House of the People praise the Lord in time like that when you don't have nothing enough that we appear to people mind to win your case you need to trust them and you need to trust the Lord let's get into trust in the Lord and you understand what it is praise the Lord we trust the law because most of the time it's because but when it comes to trusting God there is no because trusting God does not have a handle on the cop amen there is nothing that come as a handle for you to trust God you have to trust him not through anything Priscilla yeah that's the man I wrote this brother branham said we get back to death written by Solomon one of the wisest man in the world in the word but Jesus was a virgin birth he when we went through there he says but Solomon was just a man like you and I and he asked God for wisdom that was where he brought the China that was were he pleased God because the very thing that that was on God concerning his life he broke the China he broke the China there is one word for every one of us praise the Lord in seven God Christianity I support a lot of things before us and it just lost like it's all down to the rules and the regulation and the laws and the commandment in the church order and the doctrines all of those things it's just for us here the Heavenly Father don't look at that what he looks at is what he has highlighted under your name what he has ordained for you that he have highlighted and that's when you missed him it's when you miss that then you have missed the mark for the Lord that's the missing of the mark that mark was not a Mack of a man it's not a Mack of our parents it's not a Mack of the church it's God's mark for your life and when a man we can hit that the sky is your limit for and rise God is just pleased and happy with you that's the thing that we're supposed to be looking for that is the reason why we pray that's the reason why we consecrate our live because being finit being we don't understand those things we don't know Amen we don't know the full purpose of God for our life we don't know that one thing that God want us to do every man have a job praise the Lord what that won't think let's Oliver went down there and he's praying just went down there to the chopper and near down he's praying Oh God lord help being father your people are such a great people their greatness is not because of the multitude that greatness is because you are seen in your people and you cherish your people your people are the very strain of your heart now even if they're very rebellious people when Moses would tell them that they are rebellious you kick him from seeing the promised land he honors to how God's people were very precious to God's heart how can I leave social people the people that you have written your ways in their life that's what we don't understand about the people of God God ways are written in their life praise the Lord so most social people social people after reeling reading all Moses testimony praise the Lord why they were gossiping about Solomon he was spending time to read he was spending time in the word praise the Lord Amen those are those are the kind of a situation where when the pressure comes on and woman just take her child and run out of the run out of the place because what will you do to ever please the people you not be a daughter you're not born in the ceiling but then you don't speak the same what will you do to ever please them the hidden wisdom god Priscilla now you see when you read a book of Solomon and eat ecclesiastic then you understand praise the Lord then you understand that God hate wisdom in Solomon life he never had nothing to do with his ten thousand why we never have nothing to do with his heart being stolen that was just a flesh but God propose remember that God's purpose is never defeated praise the Lord and God's purpose in your life will never be defeated that's the God that we serve he has spread out his ways in the life of his people about Jesus consist except you become like a little child never enter the kingdom of heaven you stop a little bit except a man be born again Nicodemus says do I go back in my mother womb God has just distributorship I said that last Wednesday and I'm just praying him and asking the Lord to help me Dona study on that a little bit but there is just something about creation that is just that is just if you can be able to see it if you can be able to grab it man is beautiful it's beautiful God is he's just he spray himself out in his creation you remember the old man on the sea brother Branham says the ball when I asked his Sunday school teacher where is God he said are you crazy young boy we're going to be questioning you asking you know even ask about what it means to be born again or but what kind of baptism you asking where is God but when he went to the old man on the sea he said son I spend most of my life on the sea and all that I see is going because God spray himself out in the universe when God reveal himself Genesis chapter one in the beginning what did the scripture says God created he Revere himself as the Creator as the Creator Polybius for you tonight while we pray and go home he Revere himself as their creator one of the easier way to be able to deal with your situation look for the Creator because creator creation is an ongoing work it's an ongoing work every day God is creating every day there's a creation that is growing on you see the doctors in the hospital they are doing a hip surgery creation the mother bringing babies creation praise the Lord you see the policeman on the road he stopped one traffic beautiful creation you love the law tonight Amy let's just bow our heads together trust in the Lord with all your heart trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on to your own understanding but before we sing there let us bow our hearts together tonight let's go to the Lord in prayer let's go to the Lord in prayer this is not yours to bring a good message to you but it's for you to realize just like how God wrote his ways in the life of the Prophet there was a portion that was left for you in your birth in your rising and your falling he has laid out his ways and until you can see God life will become so confusing for you it will become unbearable I have

look at him he will walk on the line and balance himself and the people would cheer him out and he told them I can ride a wheelbarrow over this line and the people believed him but when it came to a time where he asks if there is anyone that want to sit in a wheelbarrow for him to go across there was no one that could trust him with your life a father sometimes does it is law we want to we try to look how you from a fine we can look at you Lord in the Bible in the life of the Prophet in the life of Sarah in the life of Hannah laws can we step on the scene and say that god of Rebecca is going to be my god can we step on the same law and trust ourself to be able to sit in a wheelbarrow and go across the line if we believe that you can do it why is it difficult for us to commit ourselves [Music] father we pray tonight Lord you notice it's my hat you know all of the things that are going through my mind and all of the things that are going through my heart Lord sometimes we get so

healing but if you don't trust yourself to the law pretty soon what you are trusting a law for is going to fail out because if he don't have you if you have not fully committed yourself committed your ways Davis I mean Solomon said trust the Lord with all your heart he realized that's where he was seeing all the complex situation around his life he wanted to get to the place to trust you with all of his heart lord I will understand things but I don't want to lean to my own understanding I don't want to make conclusion I don't want to make I don't want to I don't want to make a false top and
